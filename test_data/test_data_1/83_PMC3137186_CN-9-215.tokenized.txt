methamphetamine is a potent addictive stimulant drug that activates certain systems in the brain .
it is a member of the amphetamine family , but the effects of methamphetamine are much more potent , longer lasting , and more harmful to the central nervous system .
repeated administration of methamphetamine induces behavioral sensitization , which is considered to be related to compulsive drug - seeking behavior .
although the mechanism responsible for methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization remains unclear , it is believed that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the central nervous system plays a critical role in the development of behavioral sensitization .
our previous studies indicate that the involvement of the mu - opioid receptor system underlies the development of methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization .
understanding the mechanisms of behavioral sensitization that are regulated by the mu - opioid receptor system would be helpful in developing therapeutic programs against methamphetamine addiction .
this review briefly discusses the neural circuitry and cellular mechanisms that are known to play a central role in methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization and outlines the role of the mu - opioid receptor system in the development of methamphetamine - induced sensitization .
keywords : psychostimulants meth - induced sensitization mu - opioid receptor locomotor activity .
background methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant drug that is similar in structure to amphetamine but has a higher potential for abuse , resulting in behavioral changes including sensitization , tolerance , and dependence [ 1 ] .
it has been suggested that sensitization contributes to both initiation and maintenance of drug addiction [ 2 ] .
drug addiction is mediated by multiple brain regions and neurotransmitter systems .
the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the central nerve system is thought to play a critical role in the development of addictive behavior [ 3 , 4 ] and is strongly modulated by other neurotransmitter systems , including the opioidergic [ 5 ] , glutamatergic [ 6 ] , and gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gabaergic ) systems [ 7 ] .
many studies have shown that the dopaminergic and opioidergic systems interact in the mesolimbic brain areas .
for example , microinjection of [ d - ala2 , n - me - phe4 - gly5 - ol ] - enkephalin ( damgo ; a micro - opioid receptor agonist ) caused an increase in the ventral striatal da and da - metabolite concentrations in rats [ 8 ] .
pharmacological evidence also indicates that acute administration of morphine increases the level of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of mice [ 9 , 10 ] .
lesions of dopaminergic neurons [ 11 , 12 ] or neuroleptic blockade [ 13 ] of dopamine receptors attenuated opiatereward , as measured by intracranial electrical self - stimulation,conditioned place preference ( cpp ) , and intravenous self - administration .
moreover , our previous studies have shown that blockade of the mu - opioid receptor caused reduced development of methamphetamine - induced sensitization [ 14 - 16 ] and that these results were related to the changes in the levels of dopamine and its metabolites [ 17 ] , as well as to the binding of dopamine receptors [ 18 ] .
therefore , understanding the role the mu - opioid receptor plays in dopaminergic neurotransmission underlying methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization would facilitate the discovery of a new therapy program against addiction to psychostimulants .
this review briefly outlines the investigation on the role of the mu - opioid receptor in the development of methamphetamine - induced sensitization .
development of an animal model for methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization repeated administration of methamphetamine has been known to produce a progressively enhanced and persistent behavioral response in rodents , a phenomenon called " behavioral sensitization " [ 14 , 19 ] .
behavioral sensitization has been used as an animal model for studying the development of craving in addicts and psychosis that arises from repeated exposure to psychostimulants [ 19 , 20 ] .
previous studies have indicated that once sensitization has developed , a challenge dose ( low dose ) of methamphetamine resulted in behavioral hyperactivity , characterized by increase in locomotor activity and stereotyped behaviors in mice [ 14 , 21 ] .
for example , mice injected with 2.5 mg / kg of methamphetamine once a day for 7 consecutive days showed behavioral hyperactivity after challenge with 0.3125 mg / kg of methamphetamine on day 11 [ 14 ] .
for the initiation of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine , mice were usually given a single daily i.p. injection of methamphetamine or saline ( control ) for 5 to 7 consecutive days .
for the evaluation of the expression of behavioral sensitization , the sensitized mice received one injection of methamphetamine ( the same dose or lower as for initiation ) or saline challenge on day 11 ( with 4 abstinent days ) or day 21 ( with 14 abstinent days ) .
although the mechanism responsible for methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization remains unclear , it is believed that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the central nervous system plays a critical role in the development of behavioral sensitization [ 4 , 22 , 23 ] .
it has been reported that a challenge dose of methamphetamine ( 2 mg / kg ) markedly increased dopamine turnover ( lower dopamine and higher 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ( dopac ) levels , higher ratios of dopac over dopamine ) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the sensitized animals on day 15 of withdrawal from daily treatment with the drug , 6 mg / kg , for 14 days [ 3 ] .
these findings demonstrate that behavioral sensitization induced by methamphetamine is accompanied by increased central dopaminergic transmission [ 3 , 4 , 23 ] .
role of micro - opioid receptor in methamphetamine - induced sensitization topographic overlaps between the mu - opioid receptor and dopamine neurons were found in the central nervous system , suggesting that there are interactions between these two systems [ 24 , 25 ] .
mu opioid receptor activation has been shown to play a role in psychostimulant - induced gene expression and behavior .
for example , pretreatment with the mu - opioid receptor antagonist clocinnamox blocked methamphetamine - induced increases in zif268 messenger rna expression in the dorsal striatum of the rat [ 26 ] .
intrastriatal administration of morphine given with a low dose of amphetamine that did not induce stereotypy resulted in a level of stereotypic behavior usually seen with a high dose of amphetamine [ 27 ] .
our previous studies found that naltrexone , a long - lasting universal opioid receptor antagonist , could attenuate the induction and expression of methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization in nih swiss mice [ 14 , 15 ] .
these results show that the expressions of behavioral sensitization were attenuated by pretreatment with 10 or 20 mg / kg of naltrexone either during the induction period or before methamphetamine challenge when they were tested on days 11 and 21 [ 14 ] .
in addition , radioligand binding revealed that the maximal binding of the mu - opioid receptor , not the binding of delta - and kappa - opioid receptors , was down - regulated on day 8 after 7 daily consecutive administrations of methamphetamine .
after cessation of drug treatment , the maximal binding of the mu - opioid receptor gradually and time - dependently returned to normal level on day 11 and up - regulated on day 21 .
these findings indicate enhanced responsiveness and elevated constitutive activity of the mu - opioid receptor in nih swiss mice [ 15 ] .
recent evidence also demonstrated that the mu - opioid receptor agonist morphine increased methamphetamine - induced reinforcing behavior and its association with dopamine release in the striatum of mice [ 28 ] .
in the study , mice were i.p. injected with 0.75 mg / kg methamphetamine and 5 mg / kg morphine alone or in combination to examine the effects of acute ( i.e. once ) , repeated ( i.e. once daily for five consecutive days ) , or challenge administration ( i.e. injection of drugs again after 7 - day abstinence period ) on behaviors including cpp , locomotor activity , and stereotyped behavior , as well as on the levels of dopamine and its metabolites .
the results show that the combined administration of methamphetamine and morphine resulted in a greater cpp value than treatment with either methamphetamine or morphine alone .
treatment with methamphetamine resulted in a progressive increase in ambulatory distance , suggesting the development of locomotor sensitization in response to methamphetamine challenge ; but there were no significant changes in ambulatory distance for the group of mice injected with morphine during the course of acute , repeated , or challenge administration [ 28 ] .
neither the single nor combined regimens of drugs had effects on stereotyped behavior during five consecutive days of repeated administration [ 28 ] .
in addition , the results revealed that challenge with the combination of methamphetamine and morphine significantly increased striatal dopamine levels compared with challenge with methamphetamine and morphine alone .
challenge with methamphetamine led to a progressive and time - dependent decrease in striatal levels of dopac and homovanillic acid ( hva ) .
neither challenge with morphine nor methamphetamine plus morphine produced significant differences in the dopac and hva levels as compared with saline controls [ 28 ] .
these findings provide insight into the behavioral and neurochemical basis responsible for the combined abuse liability of methamphetamine and morphine .
alternations of neurochemical change in methamphetamine - induced sensitization in wild - type and micro - opioid receptor knockout mice mu - opioid receptor knockout mice have also shown less behavioral sensitization than wild - type mice after repeated administration of methamphetamine [ 16 ] .
the effects of behaviors and biochemical factors after blockade or lack of the mu - opioid receptor in methamphetamine sensitization are summarized in table 1 .
mu - opioid receptor knockout mice injected with 0.625 mg / kg of methamphetamine once a day for 7 consecutive days showed less behavioral hyperactivity as compared with that of the wild - type mice after challenge with 0.625 mg / kg of methamphetamine on day 11 and day 21 [ 16 ] .
in addition , the levels of dopamine metabolites , dopac and hva , were decreased in the striatum of the wild - type mice - - but not in the mu - opioid receptor knockout mice - - after 7 consecutive days of treatment followed by 4 days of drug abstinence ( on day 11 ) , as measured by in vivo microdialysis [ 17 ] .
these findings suggest that the mu - opioid receptor plays a modulatory role in methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization that is related to dopamine metabolism in the mouse striatum .
in autoradiographic study , our data showed that there was a decreased binding in the d1 but not the d2 dopamine receptor in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of mu - opioid receptor knockout mice , but not wild - type mice , after repeated administration of methamphetamine [ 18 ] .
it seems that downregulation of the d1 dopamine receptor is the main factor behind attenuation of behavioral sensitization in mu - opioid receptor knockout mice following administration of methamphetamine .
however , another set of experiments showed that the antagonistic effect of haloperidol ( a potent d2 dopamine receptor antagonist with a lower affinity for the d1 dopamine receptor ) on methamphetamine - induced stereotyped sensitization was more potent in mu - opioid receptor knockout mice than in the wild - type controls [ 16 ] .
these results reveal that the function of d2 dopamine receptor may turn to be more predominant in mu - opioid receptor knockout mice as compared with that of wild - type controls .
earlier studies have reported that both selective d1 and d2 dopamine receptor antagonists not only reversed methamphetamine - induced motor effects at each injection but also prevented the development of behavioral sensitization induced by repeated methamphetamine administration [ 22 , 29 ] .
this means that both d1 and d2 dopamine receptor systems are involved in the development of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine [ 22 , 29 ] .
the d1 and d2 dopamine receptors have opposing actions on the activity of adenylyl cyclase in dopaminergic neurons of the striatum and nucleus accumbens .
activation of the d2 dopamine receptor inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity [ 30 ] , whereas activation of the d1 dopamine receptor increased adenylyl cyclase activity [ 31 ] .
these actions resulted in a decrease in the level of camp and protein kinase a signal , which caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of darpp - 32 ( dopamine - and camp - regulated phosphoprotein of mr 32 kda ) - dependent signaling pathway [ 32 , 33 ] .
moreover , through the camp / pka , activation of d2 dopamine receptor inactivated phosphorylation of darpp - 32 through increasing calcium levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens [ 32 ] .
this means that activation of the d2 dopamine receptor can inactivate phosphorylation of darpp - 32 through camp / pka or ca2 +/ calcineurin .
it has also been reported that phosphorylation of darpp - 32 may be involved in acute administration of cocaine or amphetamine that leads to an increase in locomotor activity [ 34 ] .
these responses were severely attenuated in darpp - 32 - deficient mice [ 34 , 35 ] .
these data reveal that phosphorylation of darpp - 32 may play an important role in the mechanism of behavioral sensitization induced by psychostimulants such as methamphetamine in animals .
summary the findings summarily indicate that the mu - opioid receptor plays an important role in modulating the development of methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization through dopaminergic neurotransmission .
understanding the regulatory mechanism of the mu - opioid receptor on cellular signaling pathways and nuclear gene expression of dopaminergic system during the development of methamphetamine - induced behavioral sensitization would help us to develop therapeutic programs against drug addiction .
thus , further studies are necessary .

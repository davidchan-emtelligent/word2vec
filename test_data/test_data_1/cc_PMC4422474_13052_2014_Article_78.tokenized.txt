background primary adrenal insufficiency is relatively rare in children and , if unrecognized , may present with cardiovascular collapse , making it a potentially life - threatening entity .
case presentation the proposita , 11 months old of age , was admitted for lethargy and severe dehydration .
blood pressure was 62 / 38 mm hg , and biochemical measurements showed hyponatraemia , hypochloraemia , hyperkalaemia , and metabolic acidaemia .
renin activity was 1484 muu / ml ; cortisol , 1.03 mug / dl ( normal , 5 - 25 mug / dl ) ; and corticotropin ( acth ) , 4832 ng / l ( normal , 9 - 52 ng / l ) .
adrenal deficiency was diagnosed , and replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids was initiated .
after 40 days , acth was 797 ng / l. during follow - up , the patient started taking macrogol twice daily for constipation and experienced a significant increase in acth ( 3262 ng / l ) , which dropped to 648 ng / l when macrogol was stopped .
after arbitrary reintroduction of macrogol , the child presented with hypoglycaemia , lethargy , weakness , and hypotonia ; acth was 3145 ng / l. after again stopping macrogol , her acth was near normalized ( 323 ng / l ) .
conclusion hydrocortisone malabsorption may be caused by macrogol use .
because chronic constipation is frequently reported in children , the possibility that macrogol contributes to adrenal crisis should be taken in account .
keywords macrogol hydrocortisone adrenal insufficiency malabsorption polyethylene glycol constipation issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction adrenal insufficiency is relatively rare in children and may be categorized as primary or secondary and congenital or acquired [ 1 ] .
primary adrenal insufficiency can be caused by a deficiency in steroid biosynthesis or abnormal adrenal gland development .
it is a life - threatening disorder that can result from primary adrenal failure or secondary adrenal disease resulting in impairment of the hypothalamic - pituitary axis .
prompt diagnosis and urgent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid replacement is mandatory [ 2 ] ; however , correct management is also essential [ 3 ] .
chronic idiopathic constipation is frequently reported and reduces patient quality of life [ 4,5 ] .
in fact , chronic constipation is associated with long - term problems including megarectum , reduced sensitivity of the rectum to the presence of faeces , and abnormal gut motility [ 4 ] .
in many children , constipation is triggered by painful bowel movements caused by factors such as toilet training , changes in routine or diet , stressful events , intercurrent illness , or delaying defecation [ 4 ] .
therefore , managing chronic constipation in children effectively and early in its course is important in preventing long - term defecation disorders [ 4 ] .
polyethylene glycols ( pegs , or macrogols ) are hydrophilic polymers of ethylene oxide [ 6 ] used in many drugs such as bowel preparations , dispersing agents , and excipients , and in cosmetics [ 7 ] .
water makes up 75 - 80 % ( wt / wt ) of the normal stool , and a difference of only 10 % in hydration results in marked changes in stool consistency [ 8 ] .
because peg is a large molecular weight water - soluble polymer , it has the capacity to form hydrogen bonds with 100 molecules of water per molecule of peg [ 9 ] .
when peg is administered orally , the resulting hydration of the colonic content facilitates transit and painless defecation in a linear dose - dependent fashion [ 10 ] .
therefore , peg - based laxatives , when used in escalating doses , can also be used to completely remove faecal loading in preference to rectally - administered treatments .
standard management of chronic constipation tends to begin with correction of dietary and lifestyle factors that predispose to the condition and focus on increasing dietary fibre and fluid intake [ 11 ] .
dietary manipulation alone , including the use of corn syrup , was successful in resolving all symptoms of constipation in 25 % of children aged up to 2 years in one us study [ 5 ] .
we describe a girl with adrenal insufficiency managed with hydrocortisone and fluorocortisone who showed an adrenal crisis after administration of macrogol 3350 , and we discuss this aspect , focusing on the aetiology of adrenal insufficiency in childhood .
case report the proposita , 11 months old of age , was admitted to anna meyer children 's university hospital for lethargy and severe dehydration without history of vomiting or diarrhoea .

replacement therapy with standard doses of glucocorticoid ( hydrocortisone , 15 mg / m2 / day ) , mineralocorticoid ( fluorocortisone , 0.2 mg / day ) , and sodium chloride ( nacl , 1 g / day ) was initiated .
routine cytogenetic investigations revealed an apparently normal female karyotype ( 46 , xx ) .
molecular karyotyping was performed using an array comparative genomic hybridization analysis using proband 's dna and a 44 k array platform ( agilent technologies ) with a resolution of approximately 100 kilobase .
this examination yielded normal results .
after replacement therapy , electrolyte abnormalities were corrected during the first week , and the patient was discharged in good clinical condition .
during follow - up , she maintained good condition , good appetite , weight gain , and normal laboratory results with reduced acth ( figure 2 ) .
after 10 days , acth was 3214 ng / l ; renin activity , 165.3 muu / ml ; na , 139 meq / l ; k , 4.4 meq / l ; and cl , 96 meq / l , and after 40 days acth was 797 ng / l. figure 2 corticotropin ( acth ) serum levels ( ng / l ) at diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the start of hydrocortisone ( 10 months , 20 days of age ) , after the start of macrogol ( 14 and 18 months of age ) , and after the termination of macrogol ( 17 and 19 months of age ) .
at 14 months of age , the patient started taking macrogol twice daily for constipation , about 30 to 60 minutes after taking hydrocortisone and fluorocortisone .
testing revealed that acth was 300 ng / l , and renin activity was 24.2 muu / ml. analysis of the sf1 gene was normal with the exception of a c.437g > c polymorphism .
after 3 months of macrogol therapy , na was 135 meq / l ; cl , 106 meq / l ; k , 5.3 meq / l ; renin activity , 124.2 muu / ml ; aldosterone , 0.13 nmol / l ; cortisol , 1.78 mug / dl ; and acth , 3262 ng / l. the macrogol was stopped , resulting in a rapid reduction of corticotropin ; after 28 days it was 648 ng / l. at this time , faecal elastase was 548 mug / g ( normal , > 200 mug / g ) , and steatocrit was 0 % ( normal , < 3 %) .
screening for celiac disease was negative ( iga , 38 mg / dl ; ttg , 1.0 u / ml ) .
unfortunately , the family arbitrarily reintroduced macrogol ( once daily , more than 2 hours after taking hydrocortisone and fluorocortisone ) for chronic constipation .
after 1 month , during a respiratory tract infection , the child presented with hypoglycaemia , lethargy , weakness , and hypotonia .
vitals were measured : pulse , 134 / min ; blood pressure , 65 / 42 mm hg ; and respiration , 38 / min .
glucose was 36 mg / dl ; na , 132 neq / l ; cl , 92 meq / l ; k , 5.4 meq / l ; and acth , 3145 ng / l. during recovery , we treated the adrenal deficiency and stopped the macrogol with near normalization of corticotropin ( 323 ng / l ) after 23 days ( figure 2 ) .
neuro - metabolic tests ( plasma aminoacidogram , urine aminoacidogram , acylcarnitine profile analysis , and redox state ) were again normal .
discussion a variety of laxatives are available for treating constipation : bulk forming , osmotic , and stimulant laxatives .
osmotic laxatives , particularly peg preparations , are popular because they are relatively safe , inexpensive , and better than lactulose in improving stool frequency and consistency [ 12 - 14 ] .
hydrocortisone is a hydrophilic drug used to treat many conditions , such as primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency , hypopituitarism , and adrenogenital syndrome .
nevertheless , treatment of children suffering from adrenal insufficiency is frequently problematic for a number of reasons .
for example , it requires use of pharmaceutical formulations that do not fully address the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic problems of dosing infants .
therefore , children require careful monitoring of dose and dosage regimen .
in fact , patients with adrenal insufficiency continue to have increased mortality and morbidity despite treatment and monitoring [ 15 ] .
however , many drugs , for example , anticonvulsants such as phenytoin , phenobarbital , and carbamazepine , stimulate cytochrome p450 3a4 , induce hepatic enzymes , and lead to accelerated glucocorticoid metabolism and reduced glucocorticoid effect , possibly causing acute adrenal insufficiency [ 16 ] .
hydrocortisone preparations are commonly combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers , typically inert , to facilitate their administration .
polyethylene glycol contains a mixture of inert water - soluble molecules of different sizes , whose absorption is independent of dosage , displaying decreasing mucosal transport with increasing molecular size .
macrogol solutions are commonly used for their efficacy and low rate of absorption ( 0.2 %) after oral administration [ 17 ] and typically have a safe profile with minimal reported side effects .
a drug 's solubility in water is an important factor influencing its release into the body .
in addition , macrogol softens the faecal mass by osmotically drawing water into the gi tract .
as our case showed , it is possible that macrogol reduces the absorption of hydrocortisone , facilitating the appearance of adrenal insufficiency .
the case seems to support our hypothesis , considering the significant changes in corticotropin after starting and stopping macrogol .
furthermore , we could also speculate that the introduction of macrogol close to that of hydrocortisone or fluorocortisone could cause or contribute to the reduced absorption of these drugs , triggering the adrenal crisis .
in fact , it is recognised that many physiological gastrointestinal factors may strongly influence the plasma concentration - time profile of hydrocortisone [ 18 ] .
however , hydrocortisone has a high permeability in both the small and large intestines , and the short elimination half - life ( near 1.5 h ) requires two or more dose administrations per day [ 18 ] .
this aspect is of great concern because patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency have more than twofold increased mortality than the general population .
however , recent data have demonstrated that the metabolic cardiovascular risk in hypopituitarism is related to the daily dose of hydrocortisone [ 15 ] .
our case report , while not demonstrating a genetic aetiology ( polymorphism of sf1 was the only abnormality ) , gives evidence of a possible genetic primary cause of adrenal insufficiency , based on clinical and laboratory examinations and the age of onset .
in children , congenital primary adrenal insufficiency is very rare , accounting for about 1 % of all cases .
the importance of elucidating a genetic basis is emphasised by the ever - increasing number of genetic causes of adrenal insufficiency ( table 1 ) [ 16 ] .
in fact , in a series of 103 children with addison 's disease , genetic forms were very frequent , accounting for 72 % of congenital adrenal hyperplasia ; other genetic causes accounted for 6 % , whereas autoimmune disease was diagnosed in only 13 % [ 19 ] .
as stressed by this case , prompt diagnosis is also important because acute adrenal insufficiency is a life threatening disease .
typically , patients with this disease present with severe hypotension to hypovolaemic shock , vomiting , acute abdominal pain , and often fever .
however , children often present with hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemic seizures .
on the other hand , the primary non - specific symptoms of chronic adrenal insufficiency in children are fatigue , reduced muscle strength , weight loss , anorexia , or failure to thrive [ 20 ] .
conclusions this case report suggests that macrogol 3350 could interfere with the absorption of hydrocortisone .
it is of particular importance considering the risk of adrenal insufficiency in these patients , and careful attention should be paid to the concomitant use of macrogol and hydrocortisone in subjects with primary or secondary glucocorticoid deficiencies .

traditional genetic studies of single traits may be unable to detect the pleiotropic effects involved in complex diseases .
to detect the correlation that exists between several phenotypes involved in the same biological process , we introduce an original methodology to analyze sets of correlated phenotypes involved in the coagulation cascade in genome - wide association studies .
the methodology consists of a two - stage process .
first , we define new phenotypic meta - variables ( linear combinations of the original phenotypes ) , named metaphenotypes , by applying independent component analysis for the multivariate analysis of correlated phenotypes ( i.e. the levels of coagulation pathway - related proteins ) .
the resulting metaphenotypes integrate the information regarding the underlying biological process ( i.e. thrombus / clot formation ) .
secondly , we take advantage of a family based genome wide association study to identify genetic elements influencing these metaphenotypes and consequently thrombosis risk .
our study utilized data from the gait project ( genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia ) .
we obtained 15 metaphenotypes , which showed significant heritabilities , ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 .
these results indicate the importance of genetic factors in the variability of these traits .
we found 4 metaphenotypes that showed significant associations with snps .
the most relevant were those mapped in a region near the hrg , fetub and kng1 genes .
our results are provocative since they show that the kng1 locus plays a central role as a genetic determinant of the entire coagulation pathway and thrombus / clot formation .
integrating data from multiple correlated measurements through metaphenotypes is a promising approach to elucidate the hidden genetic mechanisms underlying complex diseases .

introduction considerable efforts have been invested to evaluate hundreds of genetic variants associated with human traits .
despite these efforts , the loci that have been identified only explain a small proportion of the total phenotypic variance .
thus , there is the question of where the remaining heritability resides .
for a complex disease , such as thrombosis , traditional single - trait genetic studies may be unable to detect the pleiotropic effect that a given genetic variant could have on the intermediate phenotypes involved with the disease .
in particular , the normal physiological process underlying thrombosis is complex and many of its components are involved in the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways .
these components form a collection of intermediate phenotypes that are generally measured in the study of thrombosis .
these intermediate phenotypes may reflect more directly the effects from causal genes than disease status .
they are also less genetically complex and more strongly associated with susceptibility loci .
so far , the genetic analyses of thrombosis have been carried out using one or more intermediate traits separately [ 1 - 7 ] .
however , if a locus is associated with two or more traits , i.e. it is pleiotropic , a single - trait study may lose the power to detect this pleiotropic effect .
however , finding disease risk indexes would contribute to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of disease , and ultimately will develop better diagnostic , prevention and treatment strategies .
in addition , the simultaneous analyses of multiple traits may uncover regulating elements such as master regulators or variants belonging to transcription factor binding sites .
genetic analyses have been performed using aptt ( activated partial thromboplastin time ) as a phenotype to improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying thrombotic disease [ 8,9 ] .
although aptt measures the combined activity of several clotting factors in the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways [ 10 ] ( including factors fii , fv , fviii , fix , fx , fxi and fxii ) , the present genetic studies on aptt consider it as an univariate model without considering pleiotropic effects [ 11 ] .
another example of exploiting the genetic information of different traits comes from the gait ( genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia ) project , where we demonstrated that coagulation factors fviii and vwf are genetically correlated with thrombotic disease [ 12 ] .
also , in a previous study , we identified common variants associated with the plasma levels of several proteins and consequently the risk of thrombosis [ 13 ] .
however , the pleiotropic effects of loci in the coagulation cascade have not been explored fully .
both genetic association and linkage research have focused on statistical and computational techniques to investigate the genetic effects between one genotype and one phenotype including polygenic and multiphenotypic approaches .
several strategies have been applied for the analysis of multiple and correlated traits .
these can be divided into three categories : p - value correction methods , regression models and data reduction methods .
p - value correction methods consist on combining several univariate tests , one for each trait , accounting for the observed correlational structure of the traits [ 14,15 ] .
regression models make use of mixed effects models for modelling the covariance structure of the phenotypes , as well as population structure [ 16 ] .
these two approaches have a limited practical use since with a large number of correlated traits , they require the simultaneous estimation of too many parameters [ 17 ] .
as an alternative , data reduction methods based on the transformation of the original traits to a reduced number of canonical traits have been proposed [ 18 - 20 ] with the intent of applying the traditional single trait analyses to these new variables .
generally , the canonical variables are obtained through a given mathematical model that transforms the original phenotypic data in a new space of reduced dimensionality where the new coordinate axes ( also called components ) define new phenotypic quantities obtained synthetically .
in particular , principal components analysis ( pca ) has been applied for this purpose [ 17 , 21 , 22 ] .
in this study , we explore an original methodology to determine the inner correlation within a set of related traits involved in the coagulation cascade , to help understanding the genetic bases of the coagulation cascade consequently of thrombosis risk .
we apply independent component analysis , a data reduction method , original in this field , to derive new phenotypic variables , called metaphenotypes , which integrate information regarding the underlying biological variability on the thrombus / clot formation .
then , we take advantage of our gwas to identify genetic elements influencing these metaphenotypes and their relationship with thrombosis risk .
materials and methods the gait project the gait ( genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia ) project has been described in souto et al 2000 [ 13 ] .
briefly , the gait project included 398 individuals from 21 extended spanish families ( mean pedigree size = 19 ) [ 12 ] .
twelve of these families were selected on the basis of a proband with idiopathic thrombophilia , whereas the remaining nine families were unaffected and selected randomly .
the ages of the subjects ranged from < 1 to 88 years ( mean = 37.7 years ) and the male to female sex ratio was 0.85 .
the study was performed according to the declaration of helsinki .
all procedures were reviewed by the institutional review board of the hospital de la santa creu i sant pau , barcelona , spain .
adult subjects gave written consent for themselves and for their minor children .
genotypes and data cleaning a genome - wide set of 307,984 snps was typed for all of the participants using the infinium ( r ) 317k beadchip on the illumina platform ( san diego , ca , usa ) .
individuals with a low call rate (< 0.5 %) , a too high ibs (> 0.95 %) and a too high heterozygosity ( fdr < 1 %) were removed from the sample .
in addition , markers with a low call rate (< 0.95 %) and a low maf (< 0.0064 %) were discarded also .
a total of 34 individuals and 30,793 snps were removed from the study .
a clean dataset containing n = 364 individuals and 277,191 snps was obtained for further analyses .
this procedure was implemented in r using the genabel package [ 23 ] .
phenotypes among the 80 phenotypes in the gait sample , m = 27 phenotypes involved in the coagulation pathway were selected to study their joint biological activity within this metabolic process .
these phenotypes were selected as they are defined in the literature [ 24 ] .
the original phenotypes are described in s1 table .
to properly apply the mathematical methods that we used , phenotypic data were freed of missing values .
to guarantee this condition , the phenotypic dataset was imputed using a bpca , a bayesian method for missing value imputation [ 25 ] .
" metaphenotypes " as a concept a metaphenotype is defined as a new phenotypic variable obtained synthetically from a set of traits ( phenotypes ) using a given mathematical model of dimensionality reduction .
metaphenotypes should be able to capture the original structure of the data to describe them as a whole .
therefore , identifying genetic variants related to these metaphenotypes may help to ascertain the genetic bases of the observed variability of the set of phenotypes , here the coagulation pathway .
the coagulation factors in the coagulation cascade show related patterns of activity .
it is known that the genes coding for the different coagulation factors share a joint ancestry [ 13 ] , so there may exist also some regulatory elements jointly regulating their activity .
we consider analyzing the 27 coagulation pathway - related phenotypes measured in the gait project under the concept of metaphenotypes .
metaphenotypes are computed from the correlation among factors .
there are several algorithms in the literature that are able to decompose the variability under different criteria .
we applied an ica ( independent component analysis ) , an algorithm based on a criterion of minimum shared information .
ica was compared to pca ( principal component analysis ) a reference method for studying the genetic association of correlated phenotypes [ 18 , 21 ] .
statistical analyses both pca and ica methods apply a linear transformation to the original phenotypic data and obtain a new system of coordinates of reduced dimensionality , following the expression in eq 1 .
x = m . w + e ( 1 ) where x ( n x m ) are the original phenotypes , m ( n x m ) are the metaphenotypes and w ( m x m ) are the weights of the model and e is the error of the model .
note that the metaphenotypes correspond to the axes of the new system of coordinates , and are called " components " .
the maximum number of components obtained is the same as the original phenotypes but generally , only a few of them are informative and therefore are taken into account .
the metaphenotypes are determined by the characterization of the weights of this linear transformation , either using pca or using ica .
independent component analysis in ica , the weights w are optimized to guarantee the statistical independence of the metaphenotypes .
the independence of the components is guaranteed by finding w that maximizes the non - gaussianity of the metaphenotypes ( m ) .
among the several ica algorithms , the fastica procedure was applied , using a particular approximation of the negentropy measure for maximizing the nongaussianity [ 26 ] .
in particular , this method was applied with an optimal number of metaphenotypes ( components ) of k = 15 , according to a criterion based on cross - validation approximations [ 27 ] .
as other ica implementations , fastica previously applies a pca to the data in order to ensure that the components are uncorrelated .
the number of components to be used are then determined from the pca procedure using a cross - validation model .
principal component analysis in pca , the weights w are optimized so that the metaphenotypes capture the maximum covariance existing between the original phenotypes .
in this case , the metaphenotypes explore the correlation that exists among the original traits to capture the variability shared by the collection of original phenotypes .
pca was used as a reference method. by default , pca obtained as many components as original variables ( k = 27 ) .
differences between pca and ica as the structure of the interrelations among phenotypes is hidden and unknown , both techniques are complementary to unravel the cascade of physiological relationships .
pca and ica answer different biological questions .
pca obtains metaphenotypes that explain the greatest overall variability or correlation between the original phenotypes .
in other words , metaphenotypes built with pca are a new set of indexes of jointly altered levels of the original phenotypes , capturing the common activity of the original phenotypes .
in contrast , ica was chosen because it obtains metaphenotypes that are statistically independent .
thus , ica is able to separate the different ( independent ) sources of variability captured by the original phenotypes .
let us consider the original traits as statistical mixtures of different sources of variability ( genetic , environmental , or experimental ) .
if there was a genetic source of variability captured by the set of phenotypes ( pleiotropy ) , the metaphenotypes obtained using ica will capture it. in other words , ica is especially useful to detect pleiotropic effects .
heritability estimation the heritabilities of the metaphenotypes were estimated using the variance component method implemented in solar [ 28 ] .
this method partitions the total phenotypic variance into a proportion due to polygenic ( additive ) effects and a proportion due to environmental effects .
the heritability ( h2r ) estimates the total variance of a trait due to additive genetic effects .
genetic association genome - wide association analyses with the snps of the gait project were performed using a likelihood ratio test based on a linear mixed effects ( variance components ) model described in eq 2 .
the model provides a vector of fitted values of the phenotype and an estimate of the variance - covariance matrix for each family [ 28 , 29 , 30 ] .
the polygenic mixed model defined in eq 2 was applied for each metaphenotype mi with the age and gender co - variables for testing the association as they present a significant correlation with almost all of the metaphenotypes .
mi ~ mu + sigmajbetajcji + gi + epsilonj ( 2 ) where i is the individual index , mi is the metaphenotype , mu is the overall mean , betaj is the regression coefficient of the j - th covariate , cji is the j - th covariate , gi is the random additive polygenic effect ( breeding value ) which variance is defined as phisigmag where phi is the kinship matrix and sigmag is the additive genetic variance due to polygenes .
finally epsiloni are the residuals of the model. with a comparative purpose , gwas of the original phenotypes were also computed .
all the p - values where corrected using the bonferroni critertion , with a significance criterion set at alpha = 0.05 after adjustment .
results a total of 15 metaphenotypes were obtained with our methodology .
all of the metaphenotypes showed a significant heritability ranging from 0.15 to 0.7 ( table 1 ) .
significant findings obtained in gwas are shown in table 2 .
to illustrate the relevance of these findings , they were compared with metaphenotypes obtained with a pca - based approach and with univariate gwas applied to the original phenotypes .
heritabilities of pca - based metaphenotypes are shown in s2 table .
table 2 presents snps significantly associated with ica - based metaphenotypes in comparison with pca - based metaphenotypes and univariate phenotypes .
for two particular snps ( rs9898 and rs27311672 ) , concordant results were found among the three gwas approaches .
both snps were significantly associated with both an ica - based and a pca - based metaphenotype as well as with the univariate phenotypes corresponding to the proteins coded by their respective closest gene ( hrg and f12 ) .
concordant ica - based and pca - based metaphenotypes were compared as follows .
associations p - values with all the original phenotypes with the snps reported in table 2 are presented in s3 table .

non - directed graphs were used to express the existing interaction among the 27 original phenotypes , represented by nodes whose colors represent their weights in the resulting metaphenotype .
this is interpretable as the contribution of the original phenotype to the corresponding metaphenotype .
numerical values for the weights are included in s4 and s5 tables .

( a ) ica - based metaphenotype corresponding to the 3rd component ( ica - c3 ) , ( b ) ica - c10 , ( c ) pca - c9 ( d ) pca - c10 .
it is observed in table 2 that ica and pca obtained concordant in two cases .
for instance , snps rs2731672 and rs9898 were significantly associated with metaphenotypes coming from different methodologies .
it is observed that the two metaphenotypes significantly associated with snp rs2731672 ( ica - c10 and pca - c10 ) are influenced clearly by the trait corresponding to the fxii levels ( dark nodes in fig 1.b and 1.d ) .
this snp is an intergenic variant ~ 5.8kb upstream of the f12 gene .
in both cases the fxii levels have an important loading in the metaphenotypes indicating the variability captured by the metaphenotype is due highly to the variability in the fxii levels .
as expected , this snp was also significantly associated with the fxii levels with the univariate gwas approach .
the metaphenotypes ica - c3 and pca - c9 , significantly associated with snp rs9898 are shown in fig 1.a and 1.c. snp rs9898 is a nonsynonymous snp in exon 5 of the hrg gene .
while the pca - based metaphenotype is oriented clearly to the hrg trait due to the weight of hrg levels in the metaphenotype ( dark red hrg node in fig 1.c ) , this specific trait does not present a high weighting value in the ica - based metaphenotype ( fig 1.a ) .
in addition , fig 2 compares directly both metaphenotypes in terms of their loadings ( the weight of each trait on the metaphenotypes ) and their scorings ( the projection of each individual on the metaphenotypes ) .
for the metaphenotypes associated with snp rs2731672 ( ica - c10 and pca - c10 ) ( fig 2.a ) , a clear correlation between both loadings and scorings from both metaphenotypes was observed .
this confirms that the common variability captured by both metaphenotypes is the same in both cases and is due highly to the variability of the fxii. by contrast , as shown in fig 2.b , no correlation was observed between the loadings or the scoring of the metaphenotypes associated with snp rs9898 ( ica - c3 and pca - c9 ) .
this indicates that both metaphenotypes capture different information from the original phenotypes .

( a ) metaphenotype associated with the snp rs2731672 at the f12 locus and ( b ) metaphenotypes associated with the snp rs9898 at the hrg locus .
in addition , the ica - c3 metaphenotype was significantly associated with three other snps ( rs3733159 , rs1621816 and rs1403694 ) on chromosome 3 .
the former one corresponds to an intronic snp in the fetub gene , whereas the latter two are intronic snps in the kng1 gene .
it is important to note that kng1 is located at a distance of around 40kb from hrg .
however , the snps rs1621816 and rs1403694 in the kng1 gene showed a low amount of linkage disequilibrium with the snp rs9898 in the hrg gene ( r2 = 0.22 and r2 = 0.21 ) .
these four snps showed a significant association with the hrg trait with the univariate gwas approach .
for the metaphenotypes associated with snp rs2731672 ( fig 2.a ) , a clear correlation between both loadings and scorings from both metaphenotypes was observed .
this confirms that the common variability captured by both metaphenotypes is the same in both cases and is due highly to the variability of the fxii. by contrast , as shown in fig 2.b , no correlation was observed between the loadings or the scoring indicating that both metaphenotypes capture different information from the original phenotypes .
discussion to date , there are no genetic studies of the coagulation pathway as a whole .
since single - trait genetic studies explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variability of thrombotic disease , it is prudent to explore other sources of heritability , such as pleiotropy .
in our study , we propose a methodology to capture the correlation that exists between a set of intermediate phenotypes involved in the coagulation cascade to elucidate the hidden genetic causes of thrombosis .
for doing that , we introduced the concept of metaphenotype consisting on new phenotypic indices that gather the observed variability of a collection of related phenotypes .
metaphenotypes are obtained through mathematical models of data dimensionality reduction .
in this study , we applied ica for the metaphenotype construction .
this method is original in this field and was compared to pca , a reference method for the combined analysis of correlated traits in genetic linkage and association studies18 , 19 , 22 .
ica was chosen because it is especially useful to detect pleiotropy. by contrast , pca is characterized by being able to capture the common variability existing among the phenotypes .
because they answer different biological questions , both methodologies may be complementary .
metaphenotypes were obtained from a collection of coagulation - related phenotypes from the gait project12 with the aim of identifying genetic variants underlying the whole biological process of blood coagulation .
the final goal was to propose genetic markers as candidate regulators of the coagulation cascade and consequently of thrombosis risk .
even if metaphenotypes are not intuitively informative , biologically speaking , they may enable the identification of possibly important loci for a more integrated coagulation index and thus be able to characterize the genetic baseline of coagulation function or thrombosis risk .
metaphenotypes can be graphically represented by use of simple graphs ( fig 1 ) where the original phenotypes involved in their construction are represented by nodes whose colors represent their weights in the resulting metaphenotype .
this is interpretable as the contribution of the original phenotypes to the corresponding metaphenotype .
in addition , obtaining metaphenotypes with a heritability greater than 50 % ( table 1 ) , allows to assume that the variability of these new phenotypic entities may be highly due to genetic variants .
this justifies performing gwas to metaphenotypes .
results from gwas with both ica - based and pca - based metaphenotypes were concordant in two cases .
for instance , snps rs2731672 and rs9898 were significantly associated with metaphenotypes coming from different methodologies .
in both cases , we compared graphically the metaphenotype obtained with ica and the one obtained with pca ( fig 2 ) .
as shown in table 2 , the snp rs2731672 in the f12 locus on chromosome 5 was significantly associated with an ica - based metaphenotype ( p - value of 1.1e - 14 ) and with a pca - based metaphenotype ( p - value : 1.48x10 - 11 ) .
it is observed in fig 1 that both the pca - based metaphenotype ( fig 1.b ) and the ica - based metaphenotype ( fig 1.d ) are influenced clearly by the fxii levels in blood .
in addition , fig 2.a shows a clear correlation between both loadings and scorings of both metaphenotypes .
this suggests that the common variability captured by both metaphenotypes is the same in both cases and is due highly to the variability of the fxii .
this observation is in agreement with the univariate association between this particular locus ( encoding the structural f12 gene ) and fxii levels [ 1 ] .
this result confirms that the ica method also captures non - pleiotropic effects .
secondly , snp rs9898 at the hrg locus at chromosome 3 was significantly associated with an ica - based ( p - value : 9e - 18 ) and two pca - based ( pvalues : 1e - 07 and 4.3e - 08 ) metaphenotypes .
comparisons were carried out with the metaphenotype showing a lower p - value .
in this case , no correlation was observed between the loadings or the scoring ( fig 2.b ) .
this suggests that both metaphenotypes capture different information of the original traits .
thus , the biological interpretation of the results may be done separately .
the univariate gwas confirmed that snp rs9898 is associated with histidine rich glycoprotein ( hrg ) levels , but previous results also reported that it was associated with activated prothrombin time ( aptt ) trait and consequently with thrombosis risk [ 8 , 31 ] .
this explains why , as observed in fig 1.c , the metaphenotype obtained with pca is oriented clearly to the hrg trait .
however , the hrg levels do not have a high weighting value in the metaphenotype obtained using ica ( fig 1.a ) .
in other words , whereas the metaphenotype obtained with pca captures the variance due to the more weighted trait ( that is hrg ) , the result obtained through ica extend our knowledge about the implication of this genetic variant , indicating that this locus has a pleiotropic effect on the set of coagulation - related traits involved with this metaphenotype .
in addition , the same ica - based metaphenotype , showed a significant association with three other snps located in the same genomic region of hrg on chromosome 3 ( rs3733159 at the fetub locus and rs1621816 and rs1403694 at the kng1 locus ) .
these 3 snps were also associated with hrg levels in univariate analyses .
the proteins coded by these three genes are histidine rich glycoprotein ( hrg ) , fetuin - b ( fb ) and the high molecular weight kininogen ( hmwk ) .
all of these proteins are structurally related to a fourth protein , the fetuin a - heremams schmide - glycoprotein [ 32 ] .
together , they form a subgroup ( denoted type 3 ) within the cystatin superfamily of cysteine inhibitors .
among the several physiological roles associated to type 3 cystatins , the most relevant is the regulation of coagulation and platelet functions , controlled mainly by hrg and kininogen proteins .
furthermore , high - molecular - weight kininogen ( hmwk ) ( encoded by kng1 ) , as well as coagulation factor fxii ( encoded by f12 ) are , together with prekallikrein ( pk ) , important constituents of the plasma contact - kinin system .
this system was first recognized as a surface - activated coagulation system , also known as the coagulation intrinsic pathway ( cip ) .
cip is activated when blood or plasma interacts with artificial surfaces .
a better understanding of this system may lead to insight into mechanisms for thrombosis and , therefore , the contact - kinin system represents a promising multifunctional target for potential thromboembolic therapies , since blocking of distinct members of the kallikrein - kinin system has the potential to become an effective and safe strategy to combat cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction .
focusing on snps located at the kng1 locus we observed that snps rs1621816 and rs1403694 showed a low degree of linkage disequilibrium with the snp rs9898 at the hrg locus ( r2 = 0.22 and r2 = 0.21 ) .
this indicates that they represent an distinct genetic signal .
thus , it is reasonable to suggest that among the results obtained , the association between snps located at the kng1 locus and an ica - based metaphenotype may have more relevant biological and clinical implications .
our results indicate that kng1 plays a relevant role in the cip not only at a molecular level , but also at a genetic level .
this result is particularly interesting since allelic variants in kng1 were previously associated with risk of thrombosis [ 33 ] .
our result strengthens previous conclusions concerning the association of kng1 with thrombosis suggesting that kng1 plays a role in the regulation of cip , even without the influence of the fxi or the fxii levels , since neither fxi nor fxii levels show a specific weight within this metaphenotype ( fig 1.c ) .
in conclusion , the methodology proposed in this study complemented existing tools for detecting genetic associations in correlated phenotypes .
this strategy explores the potential mechanisms and pathways underlying complex diseases and helps to interpret how they are associated with genetic variants .
our approach is based on the assumption that pleiotropy may occur in many complex diseases and more particularly in thrombosis diseases .
the proposed mathematical approach is especially addressed to capture several aspects of the correlated activity of a set of original traits , here blood levels of the proteins involved in the coagulation cascade .
applying this original concept helped to identify two candidate snps in the kng1 gene susceptible to have an important role in the genetic regulation of the coagulation pathway as a whole and consequently of thrombosis disease .

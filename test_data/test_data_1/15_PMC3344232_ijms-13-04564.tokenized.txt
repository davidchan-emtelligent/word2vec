cell migration is a crucial event for tissue organization during development , and its dysregulation leads to several diseases , including cancer .
cells exhibit various types of migration , such as single mesenchymal or amoeboid migration , collective migration and scaffold cell - dependent migration .
the migration properties are partly dictated by cell adhesion and its endocytic regulation .
while an epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) - mediated mesenchymal cell migration requires the endocytic recycling of integrin - mediated adhesions after the disruption of cell - cell adhesions , an amoeboid migration is not dependent on any adhesions to extracellular matrix ( ecm ) or neighboring cells .
in contrast , a collective migration is mediated by both cell - cell and cell - ecm adhesions , and a scaffold cell - dependent migration is regulated by the endocytosis and recycling of cell - cell adhesion molecules .
although some invasive carcinoma cells exhibit an emt - mediated mesenchymal or amoeboid migration , other cancer cells are known to maintain cadherin - based cell - cell adhesions and epithelial morphology during metastasis .
on the other hand , a scaffold cell - dependent migration is mainly utilized by migrating neurons in normal developing brains .
this review will summarize the structures of cell adhesions , including adherens junctions and focal adhesions , and discuss the regulatory mechanisms for the dynamic behavior of cell adhesions by endocytic pathways in cell migration in physiological and pathological conditions , focusing particularly on neural development and cancer metastasis .

introduction cell adhesion is essential for the organization and various biological functions of multicellular organisms .
there are two major types of cell adhesions ; cell - to - cell and cell - to - extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , both of which consist of transmembrane cell adhesion molecules , intracellular scaffold or signaling proteins and cytoskeletons ( figure 1 ) .
cadherin family cell adhesion molecules and their associated scaffold proteins , catenins , play important roles in the formation and functions of cell - cell adhesions , adherens junctions and desmosomes [ 1 ] .
in contrast , the major transmembrane proteins at cell - ecm adhesions are integrin heterodimers [ 2 ] .
these cell - cell and cell - ecm adhesion complexes are stabilized by actin cytoskeleton or intermediate filaments , but dynamically rearranged under some circumstances , such as cell migration and cancer metastasis [ 3,4 ] .
in the initial step of cancer metastasis , tumor cells sometimes undergo epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , which requires the disruption of cell - cell adhesions .
subsequently , the mesenchymal cancer cells begin migration and invade into the basement membranes and surrounding stromal tissues .
the migrating mesenchymal cells constantly form new adhesions to ecm at the cell front , whereas a portion of the cell - ecm adhesions are disrupted by endocytosis at the rear .
in contrast , recent reports indicate that some cancer cells maintain cell - cell adhesions and epithelial morphology during metastasis .
this type of migration , called a collective cell migration , requires both cell - cell and cell - ecm adhesions .
furthermore , other cancer cells migrate in the absence of formation of any adhesions to neighboring cells or ecms ( an amoeboid migration ) .
thus , cancer cells exhibit various types of migration , which can be classified according to the cell adhesion properties [ 5 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in addition to the various migration patterns of cancer cells , there is another type of migration , a scaffold cell - dependent migration , which only depends on cell - cell adhesions ( figure 1 ) .
this type of migration is rarely observed in cancer metastasis but occurs mainly in normal brain development .
during the development of the cerebral cortex , immature neurons exhibit multi - step migration to form a functional brain [ 6 ] .
the major migration mode of neurons is a radial glial cell - dependent migration , which is mediated by the endocytic recycling of cadherins , rather than integrins [ 7 ] .
in this review , i summarize the structures of cell adhesions and their dynamic regulation by endocytosis and membrane trafficking .
i also introduce the physiological and pathological roles of the regulation of cell adhesions in various types of cell migration in neural development and cancer metastasis .
2. structures and functions of cell adhesion complexes 2.1 .
adherens junctions adherens junctions are observed in many cell types , including epithelial cells and fibroblasts ( figure 2a ) .
the adherens junctions are required for the formation and maintenance of physical association of cells in a calcium - dependent manner [ 1 ] .
cadherin is a key molecule in calcium - dependent cell adhesion , whereas nectins and nectin - like proteins , which are calcium - independent cell adhesion molecules , also have important roles in adherens junctions ; nectin and its associated intracellular molecule , afadin , initiate the formation of adherens junctions by the recruitment of a cadherin - catenin complex to the adherens junctions [ 8,9 ] ( figure 2b ) .
while a cadherin superfamily consists of more than a hundred members , classic cadherins , including e - cadherin ( cdh1 ) and n - cadherin ( cdh2 ) , comprise about 20 molecules .
the extracellular domains of classic cadherins provide trans - homophilic binding to other cadherins on neighboring cells , and their intracellular domains directly interact with beta - catenin and p120 - catenin ( p120ctn ) [ 1,10 ] .
alpha - catenin binds both beta - catenin and actin filaments ( f - actin ) , suggesting that beta - and alpha - catenins link cadherin with actin cytoskeleton .
however , it has been reported that the alpha - catenin , complexed with beta - catenin and cadherin , rarely interacts with f - actin [ 11,12 ] .
alpha - catenin binds to several actin - binding proteins , such as vinculin and eplin , and eplin concurrently forms a complex with cadherin , alpha - catenin , beta - catenin and f - actin , suggesting that eplin and some other actin - binding proteins regulate the interaction between cadherins and f - actin cooperatively with alpha - and beta - catenins [ 13,14 ] ( figure 2b ) .
2.2 .
desmosomes desmosomes are patch - like intercellular junctions , and abundantly observed in skin and myocardium , both of which bear mechanical stress ( figure 2a ) .
the desmosomes are composed of non - classic cadherins , desmogleins and desmocollins , and provide a strong intercellular connection [ 15,16 ] .
desmoglein and desmocollin are directly or indirectly associated with plakoglobin , plakophilin , desmoplakin and intermediate filaments ( figure 2c ) .
four and three isoforms of desmogleins and desmocollins have been identified in humans , respectively .
mutations or abnormal expression of desmosomal proteins are associated with several diseases , including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvc ) , skin diseases and cancer [ 17 - 19 ] .
mutations in desmoglein - 2 , desmocollin - 2 , desmoplakin and plakoglobin have been identified in arvc patients , whereas n - terminal deletion in desmoglein - 1 leads to striate palmoplantar keratoderma [ 20,21 ] .
in addition , desmogleins are targets of autoimmune diseases , pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris [ 17,19,22 ] .
2.3 .
tight junctions and gap junctions tight junctions and gap junctions are cadherin - independent adhesions , although some crosstalk has been reported between cadherins and the components of tight junctions or gap junctions .
tight junctions are located at the most apical part of the lateral membranes in epithelial and endothelial cells ( figure 2a ) .
two major roles of tight junctions are " barrier " and " fence " functions [ 23,24 ] .
at the tight junction strands , composed of claudin family and occludin , the intercellular distance between two neighboring cells is nearly zero , so that the tight junction restricts paracellular diffusion of substances and ions .
in addition to the selective paracellular barrier function , tight junctions separate the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains to confine the diffusion of transmembrane proteins and lipids to the specific membrane domain as a fence .
both claudins and occludin bind to intracellular pdz domain - containing proteins , zo - 1 ( figure 2d ) .
junctional adhesion molecule ( jam ) family proteins are also associated with zo - 1 and localized at tight junctions [ 25 ] .
gap junctions consist of homo - or hetero - hexamers of connexin ( cx ) proteins , such as cx43 , cx26 and cx32 .
connexin hexamers , called connexons , form intercellular channels , which allow the diffusion of small molecules and electrical signals [ 26 ] .
some connexins are reported to interact with zo - 1 , and cx43 can be co - immunoprecipitated with n - cadherin and its associated catenins , suggesting that there is crosstalk between gap junctions and other junctional complexes [ 26,27 ] .
furthermore , components of gap junctions and tight junctions as well as cadherin - based adhesions have been associated with cancer [ 28 - 31 ] .
2.4 .
focal adhesions in addition to these cell - cell adhesions , cells also attach to ecms , such as fibronectin , laminin , collagen and vitronectin .
a major receptor for ecm is integrins .
in humans , 18 alpha and 8 beta subunits form at least 24 alpha - beta heterodimers of integrins [ 2,32 - 36 ] ( table 1 ) .
integrin heterodimers are localized at focal adhesions or hemidesmosomes , which are f - actin - or intermediate filament - based cell - ecm adhesion sites , respectively ( figure 2a ) , although some integrins serve cell - cell adhesion ( table 1 ) .
it has been reported that many scaffold or signaling proteins , including talin , vinculin , zyxin , focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) , src , paxillin and p130cas , are localized at focal adhesions [ 37 - 39 ] ( figure 2e ) .
talin directly binds to beta1 - integrin and an actin - binding protein , vinculin .
in addition to the role linking integrins and f - actin , talin is also required for integrin activation [ 40,41 ] .
the binding of talin induces the switching of integrins from inactive to active conformations .
therefore , talin plays important roles in both an inside - out activation of integrin and outside - in signal for the maturation of focal adhesion .
a recent report shows that sharpin perturbs the recruitment of talin to integrins and thereby inhibits the integrin activation [ 42 ] .
vinculin exhibits an intra - molecular interaction , which inactivates the scaffold function .
in contrast , an active open form of vinculin interacts with many molecules , such as alpha - actinin , paxillin , vinexin and vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( vasp ) [ 43,44 ] ( figure 2e ) .
while alpha - actinin , as well as vinculin , directly binds to f - actin , paxillin and vinexin interact with fak and sos , an activator for ras , respectively [ 37,45,46 ] .
fak forms a complex with a src kinase and grb2 , an adaptor protein that activates the ras - map kinase pathway .
vinexin is reported to promote the activation of c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) [ 47 ] .
thus , focal adhesions function as not only a cell - ecm adhesion but also a signaling center to regulate cell migration , morphological changes , survival and proliferation .
3. intracellular trafficking pathways membrane trafficking pathways are roughly classified according to their origins ; secretory pathways originated from er - golgi , endocytic pathways from plasma membranes and autophagy pathways from cytoplasm [ 48 - 52 ] ( figure 3 ) .
newly synthesized cell adhesion molecules are transported into the plasma membrane via secretory pathways .
a recent report shows that two desmosomal cadherins , desmoglein - 2 and desmocollin - 2 , are transported by the use of different plus - end motor proteins , kinesin - 1 and kinesin - 2 , respectively [ 53 ] .
furthermore , the endocytic recycling and tight junction targeting of claudin and occludin are dependent on rab13 , whereas the transport of e - cadherin to the adherens junctions requires rab8 in epithelial cell lines [ 54,55 ] .
therefore , the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules in distinct adhesion complex utilizes different transport machinery .
cell adhesion molecules , engaged in adhesion complexes , are relatively stable , but they also undergo constant or stimuli - mediated remodeling by endocytosis and the recycling system .
endocytosis can be classified into several types , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis [ 56 ] .
endocytosis and its downstream endocytic pathways are mainly regulated by rab family small gtpases [ 52,57 - 59 ] ( figure 3 ) .
many types of endocytosis are mediated by the activities of dynamin , an atypical gtpase , and rab5 .
rab5 and its subfamily proteins , such as rab21 , rab22 and rab31 , promote the internalization of transmembrane proteins and their transport into early endosomes .
as early endosomes are also called " sorting endosomes " , there are many trafficking pathways from early endosomes ; recycling pathway to plasma membrane , degradation pathway to lysosomes and retrograde transport to trans - golgi network ( tgn ) ( figure 3 ) .
whereas direct and indirect recycling pathways require rab4 and rab11 , respectively , the lysosomal degradation pathway is dependent on rab7 .
in contrast , the retrograde transports from early and late endosomes are regulated by the retromer complex and rab9 , respectively .
4. cadherin endocytosis and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition the cytoplasmic domain of e - cadherin contains a dileucine motif followed by a nvyyy motif at the membrane - proximal region and a beta - catenin - binding site at the membrane - distal region ( figure 4 ) .
a dileucine motif is a binding site for clathrin adaptor complexes , such as ap - 2 , [ 60 ] and mutation in the dileucine motif in e - cadherin inhibits its endocytosis [ 61 ] .
the dileucine motif in e - cadherin also binds to p120ctn , which masks the dileucine motif to prevent the endocytosis of e - cadherin [ 62 - 64 ] .
knockdown of p120ctn results in the internalization of cadherins and loss of cell - cell contacts .
however , the binding of numb , a cytoplasmic adaptor , to p120ctn cancels the p120ctn - mediated suppression of e - cadherin endocytosis , because numb recruits an ap - 2 clathrin adaptor complex [ 65 ] .
numb also interacts with the nvyyy motif on e - cadherin , which may prevent the binding of p120ctn to ecadherin [ 66 ] .
thus , numb promotes e - cadherin endocytosis through two different mechanisms .
a recent structural and nmr study shows that the dileucine motif in e - cadherin serves a moderate and dynamic interaction with p120ctn , whereas the nvyyy motif , including the tyrosine phosphorylation site by a src kinase , are required for a strong and static binding to p120ctn [ 67 ] .
src - mediated phosphorylation of the nvyyy motif on e - cadherin induces the dissociation of p120ctn and recruits a c - cbl - related e3 ubiquitin ligase , hakai .
hakai induces the ubiquitination of e - cadherin and subsequently its endocytosis and degradation [ 68 ] .
in addition , src and receptor tyrosine kinases , such as epidermal growth factor ( egf ) receptor and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) receptor , phosphorylate tyr654 on beta - catenin , resulting in the disruption of the cadherin beta - catenin complex .
in contrast , a cytoplasmic kinase , fer , and hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor phosphorylate tyr142 on beta - catenin , leading to the perturbation of the interaction between beta - catenin and alpha - catenin [ 69,70 ] .
increased tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in growth factor - treated cells or oncogenic environments .
various growth factors , such as transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) , hgf , fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) and egf , and oncogenic v - src are known to induce an epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ 71 - 73 ] .
emt progression involves the reduction in cell - cell adhesion , apico - basal polarity and epithelial markers , including e - cadherin , and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers , including n - cadherin , vimentin and alpha - smooth muscle actin .
although transcriptional regulation has crucial roles in the induction of emt [ 74 ] , the tyrosine phosphorylation of e - cadherin and catenins are also important events for emt [ 75 ] .
hgf treatment or v - src expression activates arf6 , an arf family small gtpase , which enhances e - cadherin endocytosis partly through the recruitment of nm23 - h1 , an activator for dynamin [ 76,77 ] .
hgf also induces ras - mediated activation of rin2 , an activator for rab5 , increasing rab5 - dependent endocytosis of e - cadherin [ 78 ] .
in addition to the clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis are involved in e - cadherin internalization [ 79,80 ] .
egf treatment promotes e - cadherin macropinocytosis into endosomes , in which e - cadherin still colocalizes with p120ctn , in mcf - 7 cells [ 81 ] .
interestingly , e - cadherin and n - cadherin enhance macropinocytosis [ 82 ] , implicating the positive feedback loop .
5. integrin endocytosis and cell migration integrin endocytosis and recycling are known to regulate the migration of many cell types , including neutrophils , fibroblasts and several cancer cell lines [ 83 - 85 ] .
the endocytosis of integrins promotes the disassembly of focal adhesion and detachment from ecm at the rear of the cell , and thereby directs cell migration [ 86 ] .
beta5 - integrin , which forms a heterodimer only with alphav - integrin as a vitronectin receptor ( table 1 ) , is observed at clathrin - coated membrane domains in cultured myotubes [ 87 ] .
furthermore , numb , an endocytic adaptor for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , binds to beta1 - integrin , but not intracellular focal adhesion components , such as talin , vinculin , paxillin and fak , and enhances integrin endocytosis and cell migration on fibrocentin or collagen [ 88 ] .
dab2 and autosomal recessive hypercholesteremia ( arh ) , another endocytic adaptor proteins , are also involved in integrin endocytosis and cell migration [ 89,90 ] .
suppression of dab2 increases the cell surface levels of beta1 - , alpha1 - , alpha2 - , alpha3 - , but not alpha5 - or alphav - integrins .
considering the binding specificity of integrins to ecm proteins ( table 1 ) , dab2 prefers to control the endocytosis of receptors for collagen and laminin , rather than fibronectin and vitronectin .
interestingly , dab2 - mediated endocytosis occurs evenly over the cell surface , suggesting that dab2 increases the intracellular integrin pool that is recycled to create new focal adhesions [ 89 ] .
rab family small gtpases and arf6 are known to regulate integrin endocytosis and intracellular trafficking [ 85,91 ] .
rab21 and rab5 are co - immunoprecipitated with beta1 - integrin and control its endosomal trafficking in mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells [ 92 ] .
internalized integrins are recycled back to the plasma membrane through rab4 - dependent direct recycling pathway or rab11 - dependent indirect recycling pathway via recycling endosomes ( figure 3 ) .
while phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) and akt regulate the trafficking of alphavbeta3 - and alpha5beta1 - integrins from rab11 - positive recycling endosomes to the plasma membranes , platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) treatment promotes the rab4 - dependent fast recycling of alphavbeta3 - integrin from early endosomes without the involvement of rab11 [ 93,94 ] .
interestingly , beta1 - integrin also enhances pdgf receptor trafficking and directed cell migration [ 95 ] .
whereas a major fibronectin receptor is alpha5beta1 - integrin ( table 1 ) , syndecan - 4 , a membrane - intercalated heparan sulfate proteoglycan , acts as a co - receptor for fibronectin [ 96 ] .
a recent study shows that the binding of fibronectin to syndecan - 4 induces alpha5beta1 - integrin endocytosis in a dynamin - and caveolin - dependent manner [ 97 ] .
syndecan - 4 is associated with protein kinase calpha ( pkcalpha ) , and this interaction is required for rhog - regulated alpha5beta1 - integrin endocytosis and cell migration during wound healing .
pkcalpha is also reported to interact with beta1 - integrin and to promote its endocytosis [ 98 ] .
a portion of the internalized beta1 - integrin is recycled to the plasma membrane via pkcepsilon activity , which promotes cell migration [ 99,100 ] .
thus , integrin trafficking , regulated by rab family small gtpases and several kinases , has important roles in cell migration .
integrin endocytosis is also required for the internalization of ecm proteins , such as vitronectin and fibronectin .
in human skin fibroblasts , beta5 - integrin and vitronectin are co - localized at intracellular vesicles and transported into lysosomes [ 101 ] .
another report shows that caveolin - mediated endocytosis of beta1 - integrin is involved in the turnover of fibronectin [ 102 ] .
the engagement of fibronectin causes the ubiquitination of alpha5 - integrin , which is transported into lysosomes via the escrt pathway [ 103 ] .
interestingly , this selective sorting and degradation of fibronectin - bound alpha5beta1 - integrin is required for fibroblast migration [ 103 ] .
many reports have indicated that integrin trafficking is associated with cancer metastasis [ 91,104 ] .
increased expression of alphavbeta6 - integrin is found in many cancers , including oral carcinoma .
hs1 - associated protein x - 1 ( hax - 1 ) directly binds to the cytoplasmic domain of beta6 - integrin and this interaction enhances the migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines through promotion of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis of alphavbeta6 - integrin [ 105 ] .
in addition , enhanced expression of arf6 is observed in breast cancer cells , and gep100 ( also known as brag2 ) , an activator for arf6 , is responsible for the invasive activity of mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells [ 106 ] .
since it is known that gep100 regulates the endocytosis of beta1 - integrin [ 107 ] , arf6 - mediated trafficking of beta1 - integrin may contribute to the acquisition of invasive phenotypes in breast cancer cells .
furthermore , recent reports have revealed that oncogenic mutant forms of p53 , a major tumor suppressor , enhance rab11 - dependent recycling of alpha5beta1 - integrin to promote invasive migration [ 108,109 ] .
these observations strongly suggest that integrin trafficking is closely associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis .
6. roles of cell adhesion dynamics in cancer 6.1 .
cancer metastasis precise regulation of cell adhesion is important for various physiological events , such as normal development , immune system and wound healing , and its dysregulation is associated with many pathological states , including cancer metastasis .
the metastasis of carcinomas consists of several steps [ 73,110 ] ( figure 5 ) .
( i ) following the formation of a primary tumor , some tumor cells detach from the primary tumor ; ( ii ) these tumor cells invade the basement membranes and local mesenchymal tissues ; ( iii ) they undergo transendothelial migration into blood or lymphatic vessels ( intravasation ) ; ( iv ) escaping from the immune system , they survive in the circulation ; ( v ) the cancer cells attach to the vessel wall in the distant organ and migrate out of the vessel ( extravasation ) ; ( vi ) they proliferate to establish colonies at the secondary sites .
these complicated processes require the dynamic regulation of cell adhesions through endocytic machinery as well as transcriptional regulation .
6.2 .
emt in cancer several studies pointed out the significance of emt in cancer invasion [ 73,111,112 ] , although it remains controversial because many metastatic tumors still retain epithelial properties and histopathological similarities to the primary tumors [ 113,114 ] .
furthermore , it is also unclear when metastasis comes into existence during tumor progression .
a classical belief is that the invasion and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells occur after primary tumors have considerably expanded and have acquired high - motility properties through emt .
however , recent accumulating evidence indicates that the metastatic spread of tumor cells is an early step of cancer progression [ 115,116 ] .
the disseminated tumor cells from her - 2 transgenic mammary glands are observed in lymph nodes or bone marrow at the premalignant phase , and early - disseminated cancer cells have the competency to induce lethal carcinosis [ 117 ] .
furthermore , there is no association between the tumor stage of human breast cancer and the number of disseminated cells in the bone marrow .
regardless of whether it is an early or late event in cancer progression , the invasive migration of tumor cells is an initial important step for cancer metastasis .
although emt has a limited role in cancer metastasis , many reports indicate that complete or incomplete emt is associated with the metastasis of tumors , including breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer [ 118 - 124 ] ( figure 5 ) .
as described above , emt is accompanied with downregulation of e - cadherin and upregulation of n - cadherin , the so - called " cadherin switch " .
transcriptional repression of e - cadherin is mediated by transcriptional repressors , snail family zinc finger proteins , snail ( snai1 ) and slug ( snai2 ) , zeb family transcriptional factors , zeb1 and zeb2 ( also known sip1 ) , and basic helix - loop - helix proteins , twist1 and twist2 .
snail and slug also suppress the transcription of occludin and claudin - 1 , whereas zeb2 targets cx26 and plakophilin - 2 [ 74 ] .
tgfbeta , a major emt inducer , upregulates snail and zeb2 [ 125 - 127 ] .
furthermore , p12 ( also known cdk2ap ) , a downstream effector of tgfbeta , induces emt through twist2 upregulation [ 128 ] .
in addition to transcriptional regulators , the type ii receptor of tgfbeta phosphorylates par6 , a polarity protein , and the phosphorylated par6 recruits an e3 ubiquitin ligase , smurf1 , leading to the degradation of rhoa [ 129 ] .
also , cooperatively with raf - 1 , tgfbeta promotes the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of e - cadherin [ 130 ] .
therefore , tgfbeta signaling is integral in emt through the regulation of transcription , rhoa - dependent cytoskeletal remodeling and endocytosis , even though the downstream effect of tgfbeta is cell type - specific [ 114 ] .
it has been reported that micrornas and alternative splicing regulators , esrp1 and esrp2 , are involved in tumor cell migration and emt [ 122,131 - 135 ] .
a microrna , mir - 9 directly targets e - cadherin mrna , resulting in an increase of cell migration and invasiveness [ 131,136 ] .
consistently , mir - 9 is upregulated in breast cancer cells .
in contrast , mir - 200 and its related micrornas , repress zeb1 , leading to the inhibition of emt [ 122,132,133 ] .
interestingly , recent studies indicate that emt is associated with the maintenance of stem cell properties , and the mir - 200 family suppresses the " stemness " through the repression of bmi1 , klf4 as well as zeb1 , suggesting that emt may induce cancer stem cells [ 122,137 - 139 ] .
6.3 .
collective invasion in several cancers , including melanoma , breast cancer and colorectal cancer , cancer cells collectively migrate and invade other tissues without incurring emt [ 113,140 - 143 ] ( figure 5 ) .
collective migrating cells form multicellular strands ( epithelial sheets ) or coherent clusters detached from the primary tumors [ 5 ] .
in either case , their cell - cell and cell - ecm adhesions are maintained , so that they can interact with neighboring cells and ecm during migration ( figure 1 ) .
in the collective migration of l - 10 human rectal adenocarcinoma cells , ht - 1080 fibroblastoma cells and mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells , a leading cell ( or a tip cell ) in the front expresses mt1 - mmp , a membrane - type matrix metalloproteinase , while the following cells at the back do not [ 142,144 ] .
the activity of mt1 - mmp is required for the transition from individual to collective cell invasion .
furthermore , in the co - cultures of carcinoma cells and stromal fibroblasts , the leading fibroblasts invade in an mmp - dependent manner and form tracks through alpha5 - integrin - mediated rhoa activation and subsequent activation of myosin light chain ( mlc ) , whereas carcinoma cells follow the tracks generated by the leading fibroblasts via cdc42 - mediated regulation of mlc [ 145 ] .
these findings suggest that during collective cell migration , the leading and the following cells exhibit different properties and that the multicellular coordination of cell polarity and cytoskeletal regulation has important roles .
at the cell - cell adhesions in collective migrating cells , actomyosin contractility is kept at low levels to maintain cell - cell cohesion [ 146,147 ] .
discoidin domain receptor 1 ( ddr1 ) interacts with polarity proteins , par3 and par6 , which suppress rho kinase / rock - mediated actomyosin contractility through the recruitment of rhoe [ 146 ] .
furthermore , ddr1 induces the upregulation of n - cadherin [ 148 ] , and in collective migrating neural crest cells , n - cadherin inhibits membrane protrusion and rac1 activity at cell - cell contacts [ 149,150 ] .
thus , cell adhesion molecules not only maintain cell - cell and cell - ecm contacts but also regulate intracellular signals to control collective cell migration .
interestingly , a recent report has indicated the cooperative roles of emt - mediated mesenchymal cells ( emt - cancer cells ) and collective invading cells ( non - emt - cancer cells ) [ 151,152 ] .
emt - cancer cells , but not non - emt cancer cells , can invade and intravasate into the blood vessels , although they cannot establish metastasis in the distal organs .
on the other hand , non - emt - cancer cells can survive in the circulation and form the secondary tumors only if they are injected into the blood vessels , but not below the skin .
when both emt - and non - emt cancer cells are inoculated subcutaneously , emt cancer cells are located at the invasive front and the following non - emt cancer cells can intravasate into the blood circulation .
furthermore , non - emt cells extravasate and establish metastasis , suggesting that completing the entire metastatic process requires the cooperation between emt - and non - emt - cancer cells .
6.4 .
amoeboid migration while tgfbeta regulates the switch from collective to individual migration of breast cancer cells in a smad - dependent manner [ 143 ] , suppression of integrin causes the transition from collective to amoeboid migration .
amoeboid cell migration is independent of ecm attachment and protease activity ; it requires actin cytoskeletal regulation to move forward [ 153 ] ( figures 1,5 ) .
it has been reported that the suppression of cofilin , an actin - binding protein , leads to the transition from amoeboid tumor cells to mesenchyme - like cells [ 154 ] .
p27kip1 , a cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor protein that negatively regulates cell cycle progression , has also been reported to control mesenchymal - amoeboid transition ( mat ) [ 155 ] .
interestingly , p27kip1 promotes cofilin - mediated actin reorganization as a downstream pathway of cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) in neurons [ 156 ] .
since cdk5 - mediated regulation of p27kip1 is associated with several cancers [ 157,158 ] , a cdk5 - p27kip1 pathway might determine an amoeboid morphology through the regulation of cofilin in cancer .
7. endocytic regulation of cell adhesion in neural development 7.1 .
cell adhesion and cerebral cortical development neural tissues , including cerebral cortex , are constructed from an epithelium - derived neural tube [ 159 ] .
in the developing cerebral cortex , neural progenitors comprise a pseudostratified neuroepithelium ( or ventricular zone ) , in which e - and n - cadherin - mediated adherens junctions and gap junctions , but not desmosomes , are observed [ 160 - 162 ] .
zo - 1 is also localized at the apical parts of neuroepithelium , but tight junction structures are not observed after neural tube closure [ 161 ] .
in the neuroepithelium , n - cadherin is transported by kif3 - mediated microtubule plus - end - directed motor complexes , composed of kif3a , kif3b and kap3 [ 163 ] , and knockout of n - cadherin or kap3 results in the disruption of neuroepithelial structures [ 163,164 ] .
furthermore , n - cadherin - mediated adherens junctions may play an important role in proper neuronal differentiation because suppression of n - cadherin causes premature neuronal differentiation [ 165 ] .
differentiated immature neurons , generated from neural progenitors , migrate out of the neuroepithelium .
these migrating immature neurons exhibit various morphological changes , and subsequently attach to radial glial fibers , pia - directed long processes derived from neural progenitors , in the developing cerebral cortex [ 6 ] ( figure 6 ) .
the morphological changes at the early phase of migration require the proper regulation of microtubule dynamics and actin cytoskeletal reorganization , mediated by rac1 - jnk - map1b and cdk5 - p27kip1 - cofilin pathways , respectively [ 156,166 - 168 ] .
since p27kip1 controls the g1 length of neural progenitors and cell cycle exit through the inhibition of cdk activities [ 169,170 ] , p27kip1 has dual functions in neural progenitors and migrating neurons , and therefore provides a molecular link between the cell cycle exit and migration start .
interestingly , mutations in arfgef2 / big2 cause periventricular heterotopia ( caused by the migration defect in neurons ) and microcephaly ( caused by the proliferation defect in neural progenitors ) in humans , suggesting that arfgef2 / big2 and its downstream arf family small gtpases are also involved in both neural progenitor proliferation and migration start , likely through the regulation of membrane trafficking [ 171 ] .
7.2 .
scaffold cell - dependent migration in neural development after complex morphological changes , immature neurons begin a long - distance migration along radial glial fibers , called the locomotion mode of neuronal migration [ 172 ] , which covers most of the neuronal migration route and is therefore a main contributor to neuronal migration and cortical layer formation [ 173 ] .
this migration is a typical example of a scaffold cell - dependent migration ( figure 1 ) .
n - cadherin is required for the attachment of the locomoting neurons to the radial glial fibers [ 7,174 ] ( figure 6 ) .
a portion of this n - cadherin is internalized by a rab5 - dependent endocytosis and recycled to the plasma membrane via a rab11 - dependent indirect recycling pathway , suggesting that the intracellular trafficking of n - cadherin is essential for neuronal migration along radial glial fibers [ 7,52 ] .
although rab5 is involved in not only clathrin - mediated endocytosis but also some caveolin - mediated endocytosis , it is known that at least clathrin function is required for cortical neuronal migration [ 175 ] .
recent reports reveal that a small gtpase , rap1 , regulates n - cadherin in migrating neurons as a downstream pathway of reelin , whose mutation in mice results in the disruption of cortical layer structures , probably due to the neuronal migration defect [ 176,177 ] .
in addition , cx43 and cx26 , gap junction components are reported to regulate neuronal adhesion to radial glial fibers [ 178 - 180 ] .
on the other hand , several reports indicate that beta1 - integrin is less important for the locomotion mode of migration [ 181,182 ] , suggesting that a scaffold cell - dependent migration largely depends on cell - cell adhesions , but not cell - ecm adhesions ( figure 1 ) .
similar to the developing cerebral cortex in mice , n - cadherin is required for the migration of cerebellar granule neurons in zebrafish .
this , however , is not a scaffold cell - dependent migration but a chain migration , an atypical mode of collective migration , which forms cell - cell contacts between migrating neurons [ 183 ] .
in mice , cerebellar granule neurons exhibit a scaffold cell - dependent migration at the late phase of neuronal migration , and forms " interstitial junctions " and desmosome - like adhesions with bergmann glial fibers [ 184 ] .
a major component of interstitial junctions is astrotactin ( astn1 ) [ 185 ] .
astrotactin is transported during neuronal migration and the trafficking is regulated by astn2 [ 186 ] .
thus , a scaffold cell - dependent migration requires the intracellular trafficking of cell - cell adhesion molecules , such as astrotactin and n - cadherin .
8. conclusion remarks in physiological and pathological conditions , cell migration plays various important roles .
cell migration patterns are classified according to the cell adhesion properties ( figure 1 ) .
emt - mediated single cell migration , amoeboid migration , collective migration and scaffold cell - dependent migration are differentially used during normal development and regeneration , suggesting that proper regulation of cell adhesion in migration is essential for tissue organization and maintenance .
it is consistent with the fact that abnormal emt and / or collective migration are closely associated with cancer metastasis .
as described above , recent studies have uncovered the fact that endocytic trafficking is essentially required for several types of cell migration .
however , research into the in vivo roles of endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking is just beginning .
better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of membrane trafficking may uncover yet unknown critical roles in various biological fields , including developmental biology , neuroscience and cancer therapy .

figure 3 intracellular trafficking pathways .
three major trafficking pathways are endocytic pathways ( blue arrows ) , secretory pathways ( green arrows ) and autophagy pathways ( orange arrows ) .
some cargo molecules are transported from endosomes to trans - golgi network via retrograde pathways .
figure 4 dileucine and nvyyy motifs in e - cadherin intracellular region .
a dileucine motif ( shown in red characters ) binds to endocytic adaptor proteins , such as ap - 2 , whereas a nvyyy motif ( shown in blue characters ) , including the tyrosine phosphorylation site by a src kinase , are required for a strong binding to p120ctn .
a triple glycine ( ggg ) motif is also involved in the strong and static binding to p120ctn .

the journal of hip preservation surgery ( jhps ) is not the only place where work in the field of hip preservation may be published .
although our aim is to offer the best of the best , we continue to be fascinated by work that finds it way into journals other than our own .
there is much to learn from it , so jhps has selected six recent and topical articles for those who seek a brief summary of what is taking place in our ever - fascinating world of hip preservation .
what you see here are the mildly edited abstracts of the original articles , to give them what jhps hopes is a more readable feel .
if you are pushed for time , what follows should take you no more than 10 min to read .
so here goes ...
what are the risk factors for conversion to total hip replacement after hip arthroscopic surgery ?
in a population - based analysis , schairer et al [ 1 ] from hospital for special surgery , new york , evaluated the conversion rate to total hip replacement ( thr ) within 2 years of hip arthroscopy and the influence of age , arthritis and obesity on the rate of conversion .
the data were obtained from the state ambulatory surgery databases and state inpatient databases for california and florida from 2005 to 2012 , which contain 100 % of patient visits .
hip arthroscopy patients were tracked for subsequent primary thr within 2 years .
out - of - state patients and patients with < 2 - year follow - up were excluded .
multivariate analysis identified risks for subsequent hip replacement after arthroscopy .
the authors identified 7351 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy with 2 - year follow - up. the mean age was 43.9 +/ - 13.7 years , and 58.8 % were female patients .
overall , 11.7 % of patients underwent thr conversion within 2 years .
the conversion rate was lowest in patients aged < 40 years ( 3.0 %) and highest in the 60 - to 69 - year - old group ( 35.0 %) ( p < 0.001 ) .
an increased risk of conversion to thr was noted in older patients and in patients with osteoarthritis or obesity at the time of hip arthroscopy .
patients treated at high - volume hip arthroscopy centers had a lower thr conversion rate than those treated at low - volume centers ( 15.1 % versus 9.7 % , p < 0.001 ) .
in this retrospective comparative ( level iii ) study the authors concluded that older patients have a higher rate of conversion to thr , as do patients with osteoarthritis or obesity .
radiological markers for identifying cam lesions - - the concept of omega angle ?
portugese and spanish researchers [ 2 ] have looked at the limitations of using alpha angle in quantifying cam - type pathology , which measures the deformity in a single plane .
however , when the deformity overlaps the superior retinaculum , femoral head osteoplasty in this area can jeopardize intra - articular vascular structures .
this study proposes a new angular measure of the linear radial extension of cam deformity as a planning tool for bone resection and compares the accuracy of femoral head osteoplasty using open and arthroscopic surgery .
twenty - five symptomatic patients operated on for femoroacetabular impingement ( fai ) were included in this study .
radial magnetic resonance imaging was done before and after surgery .
bi - dimensional coordinates of the vascular foramina and radial extension of the deformity ( omega angle ) were measured .
this extension was correlated with the vascular foramina location and alpha - angle value .
accuracy of resection and hip function was evaluated before and after surgery .
the cam lesion frequently extended posteriorly .
no relationship between values of alpha and omega angles was found .
cam resection was complete in 88 % of cases ; there was a significant improvement in outcome score after surgery .
this study showed that alpha angle , measured in one plane , was not a predictor of the radial extension of cam deformity .
to achieve a full resection , it was frequently necessary to extend the femoral head osteoplasty over the retinacular area .
pre - operative determination of the omega angle and location of the vascular foramina helped improve cam resection safety and accuracy .
does periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia restrict hip range of motion ?
simulated range of motion ( rom ) analysis performed in osaka university , japan , [ 3 ] attempted to identify the optimal reorientation of the acetabulum for developmental dysplasia ( ddh ) of the hip .
the simulated roms of 52 ddhs after rotational acetabular osteotomy ( rao ) with several patterns of femoral head coverage and those of 73 normal hips were analysed using computer models reconstructed from computed tomographic images .
after rao with a lateral center edge angle ( lcea ) of 30degrees and an anterior center edge angle ( acea ) of 55degrees producing coverage similar to that of normal hips , the maximal flexion and maximal internal rotation at 110degrees flexion with 20degrees adduction were significantly smaller than those of the normal group .
to achieve roms after rao similar to those of the normal group , an lcea of 30degrees with an acea of 45degrees , an lcea of 25degrees with an acea of 45degrees to 50degrees and an lcea of 20degrees with an acea of 50degrees could be preferred angles to target , even though they provided smaller coverage than that of normal hips .
the authors concluded that after rao producing femoral head coverage similar to that of normal hips , the maximal flexion and the maximal internal rotation at 110degrees flexion with 20degrees adduction were significantly smaller than those of the normal group .
results of anteverting periacetabular osteotomy for acetabular retroversion while the role of periacetabular osteotomy ( pao ) in correcting acetabular retroversion is well described , there is very little published literature on this particular indication of pao .
a retrospective review performed in mayo clinic [ 4 ] identified a cohort of patients who underwent rpao for acetabular retroversion in isolation or in the setting of dysplasia ( lcea <= 19degrees ) .
the acetabular retroversion with fai was diagnosed clinically and radiographically , with a positive crossover and posterior wall signs on pelvic radiographs .
twenty - three patients ( 30 hips ) met the inclusion criteria : 20 hips with isolated retroversion and 10 hips with retroversion and hip dysplasia .
the average age at the time of the procedure was 26 years ( range , 13 - 45 years ) .
the average length of follow - up was 5 years ( range , 2 - 19 years ) .
harris hip score ( hhs ) and radiographs were evaluated preoperatively and at last follow - up. the mean preoperative lcea was 31degrees ( range , 22degrees - 49degrees ) in the isolated retroversion group and 9degrees ( range , - 4degrees to 17degrees ) in the dysplastic group .
postoperatively , the lcea in the dysplastic group increased to 35degrees ( range , 15degrees - 46degrees ) ( p = 0.0001 ) .
the crossover sign corrected in 55 % ( 11 / 20 ) of the isolated retroversion group and 80 % ( 8 / 10 ) of the dysplastic group .
the acetabular index ( mean +/ - sd ) improved from 1.3 +/ - 0.3 to 1.7 +/ - 0.6 ( p = 0.0001 ) , indicating improved anteversion .
at the latest follow - up , the average hhs in the isolated retroversion group increased from 58 ( range , 23 - 77 ) preoperatively to 93 ( range , 68 - 100 ) ( p = 0.0001 ) ; the hhs in the dysplastic group improved from 49 ( range , 20 - 74 ) to 92 ( range , 77 - 100 ) ( p < 0.0001 ) .
complication rates were similar in both groups .
excluding hardware removal , additional surgeries were performed in 13 % ( 4 / 30 ) .
rpao performed for fai in the young patient with isolated acetabular retroversion or retroversion in the setting of dysplasia successfully improved clinical and radiographic results at mid - to long - term follow - up. is cam deformity a primary malformation or secondary to a degenerative process or repetitive impingement ?
morphological deformities of the hip , such as femoroacetabular impingement , may be responsible for up to 80 % of hip osteoarthritis .
in cam - type fai , the pathomechanism has been attributed to repeated abnormal contact between the femur and the antero - superior acetabular rim , resulting in cartilage and labrum degeneration .
subchondral bone stiffness likely plays a major role in the process , but little is known of the mechanical properties of the cam deformity .
haider et al .
[ 5 ] from ottawa , therefore , set out to look at the femoral subchondral bone properties of patients with cam - type femoroacetabular impingement .
the purpose of this study was to determine tissue modulus and the trabecular micro - architecture of the subchondral bone of the cam deformity of patients undergoing resection surgery as well as comparing these parameters to healthy age - matched controls .
twelve osteochondral bone biopsies were obtained from symptomatic fai patients and 10 osteochondral control specimens were harvested from cadaveric femurs .
a combination of mechanical testing , micro - computed tomographic and finite element analysis was used to determine tissue modulus , bone volume fraction , trabecular thickness , trabecular and spacing and trabecular number .
the mean tissue modulus of the cam - type fai deformities ( e = 5.4 gpa ) was significantly higher than normal controls ( e = 2.75 gpa , p = 0.038 ) , but no statistically significant differences were found in bone micro - architectural parameters .
these data suggest that subchondral bone of the cam deformity consists of older secondary mineralized bone .
this would support the theory that the cam deformity is a primary malformation with intrinsic biomechanical abnormalities , rather than a secondary deformity as a part of the degenerative process of the covering cartilage or remodeling due to repeated impingement .
strategies to prevent heterotopic ossification after hip arthroscopy : role of naproxen in a double - blind randomized control trial beckmann et al [ 6 ] sought to determine the effect of postoperative naproxen therapy on the development of heterotopic ossification ( ho ) following arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement. between august 2011 and april 2013 , 108 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized to take naproxen or a placebo for 3 weeks postoperatively .
radiographs were made at routine follow - up visits for 1 year following surgery .
the primary outcome measure was the development of ho , as classified with the brooker criteria and two - dimensional measurements on radiographs made at least 75 days postoperatively ( average , 322 days ) .
the primary analysis , performed with a fisher exact test , compared the proportion of subjects with ho between the treatment and control groups .
a single a priori interim analysis was planned at the midpoint of the study .
the local safety and monitoring board stopped this study when the interim analysis showed that the stopping criterion had been met for demonstration of efficacy of the naproxen intervention .
the prevalence of ho was 46 % ( 22 of the 48 in the final analysis ) in the placebo group versus 4 % ( 2 of 48 ) in the naproxen group ( p < 0.001 ) .
medication compliance was 69 % overall , but it did not differ between the naproxen and the placebo groups .
minor adverse reactions to the study medications were reported in 42 % of the patients taking naproxen versus 35 % of those taking the placebo ( p = 0.45 ) .
the authors therefore concluded that prophylaxis with naproxen was effective in reducing the prevalence of ho without medication - related morbidity .
conflict of interest statement none declared .

abstract sterically large substituents can provide kinetic stabilization to various types of low - coordinate compounds .
for example , regarding the chemistry of the group 14 elements , since west et al. introduced the concept of kinetic protection of the otherwise highly reactive si = si double bond by bulky mesityl ( 2,4,6 - trimethylphenyl ) groups in 1981 , a number of unsaturated compounds of silicon and its group homologs have been successfully isolated by steric effects using the appropriate large substituents .
however , the functions and applications of the si - si pi - bonds consisting of the 3ppi electrons on the formally sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms have rarely been explored until 10 years ago , when scheschkewitz and tamao independently reported the model systems of the oligo ( p - phenylenedisilenylene ) s ( si - opvs ) in 2007 .
this review focuses on the recent advances in the chemistry of pi - electron systems containing si = si double bonds , mainly published in the last decade .
the synthesis , characterization , and potential application of a variety of donor - free pi - conjugated disilene compounds are described .

introduction in the periodic table , silicon is located just below carbon in the group 14 elements , but carbon and silicon have different roles and functions in nature .
while carbon is a central element in the organic substances that constitute the body of all living things , silicon is a key element of inorganic substances that constitute the earth ' s crust and is widely used in glass , semiconductors , concrete , ceramics , etc .
strangely , there is no organosilicon material containing c - si bonds in nature except for silicon carbide in meteorites .
therefore , every organosilicon compound is an artificial substance created by human technology .
while a variety of allotropes of carbon , such as diamond , graphite , fullerenes , and carbon nanotubes , are known as a stable material mainly consisting of the sp 3 - or sp 2 - hybridized carbon atoms , the stable form of silicon only possesses a diamond - type structure based on the formally sp 3 - hybridized silicon atoms .
can sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms exist as a stable substance ?
in recent years , silicene , the silicon analog of graphene , has attracted much attention , from both experimentalists and theoreticians , as a new two - dimensional allotrope of silicon [ 1 - 3 ] .
theoretical studies predict that repeating units in pure silicon nanosheets do not exhibit a planar hexagonal geometry like graphene but a non - classical propellane motif , presumably due to the instability associated with sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms [ 4 ] .
in general , the si - si pi - bond is much weaker than the c - c pi - bond essentially due to the less effective overlap of the two adjacent 3p orbitals relative to that of the 2p orbitals , corresponding to the greater covalent atomic radius of silicon ( 1.11 ( 2 ) a ) than that of carbon ( sp 3 - c ; 0.76 ( 1 ) , sp 2 - c ; 0.73 ( 2 ) , and sp - c ; 0.69 ( 1 ) a ) [ 5 ] .
in 1981 , west , fink , and michl demonstrated for the first time that disilene ( r2si = sir2 ) ( 1 ) , the silicon analog of alkene , can be created based on the concept of kinetic stabilization using sterically demanding substituents , protecting the highly reactive si = si double bond , as shown in figure 1 , which produced a significant change in the main group chemistry [ 6 - 11 ] .
in fact , after the finding of this isolatable disilene 1 , many kinds of unsaturated compounds of silicon have been successfully obtained by virtue of the steric effects of the bulky protecting groups [ 12 - 22 ] .
for recent representative examples , since 2000 , silaaromatics ( 2 ) [ 23 - 25 ] , trisilaallenes ( r2si = si = sir2 ) ( 3 ) [ 26,27 ] , and disilynes ( rsi = sir ) ( 4 ) [ 28 - 31 ] have been isolated using the appropriately designed bulky aryl , alkyl , and silyl substituents , respectively .
also , a tricyclic aromatic isomer of hexasilabenzene ( 5 ) [ 32 ] and a disilicon ( 0 ) fragment coordinated by the n - heterocyclic carbenes ( nhcs ) ( 6 ) [ 33 ] were synthesized as stable crystalline compounds .
in 2011 , we reported the synthesis of a cyclobutadiene ( cbd ) silicon analog , i.e. tetrasilacyclobutadiene ( 7 ) , with a planar rhombic charge - separated structure originating from the polar jahn - teller distortion [ 34 ] .
this is the first persila [ n ] annulene compound , ( sir ) n ( n is an even number equal to or greater than 4 ) , with a cyclic structure consisting of formally sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms , which will open a new facet of silicon pi - science .

examples of stable unsaturated silicon compounds .
although the fundamental chemistry of the low - coordinated compounds of silicon has been steadily established year - by - year , the functions and applications of the si - si pi - bonds consisting of the 3ppi electrons on the formally sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms have rarely been explored .
in main group element chemistry , recent synthetic efforts have been directed toward investigating the combination of the multiple bonds of the heavier main group elements and the carbon pi - electron systems due to their unique electronic properties and potentially useful technological applications for organic electronics , which would offer a new avenue to functional organoelement materials [ 35 - 45 ] .
however , this chemistry always faces a formidable challenge .
while the sufficient steric effects of the bulky substituents are crucial in protecting the highly reactive heavier multiple bonds , it may cause twisting of the pi - framework , which prevents the preferred extension of the pi - conjugation over the skeleton .
in order to further develop this chemistry toward advanced materials science and technology , we have designed a series of fused - ring bulky 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7 - octa - r - substituted s - hydrindacen - 4 - yl groups , called the ' rind ' groups , as shown in figure 2 , where r denotes the initial of the substituents on the benzylic positions of the hydrindacene skeleton [ 46 ] .
the rind groups are actually giant aryl hydrocarbon substituents .
nevertheless , they can be easily prepared by organic synthetic methods , including the intramolecular friedel - crafts double cyclization [ 47 ] .
in addition , various r groups ( r1 , r2 , r3 , and r4 groups ) can be introduced at the four benzylic positions of the hydrindacene skeleton .
while the peripheral r1 and r2 groups can control their physical properties such as crystallinity and solubility , the proximal r3 and r4 groups can directly change the steric ( size and shape ) effects of the rind groups .
also , the rind groups have a rigid structure based on the fused - ring system and show a high chemical stability due to the full substitution at all the benzylic positions , whose c - h bonds are generally more reactive than other c - h bonds .
the term ' rind ' in english describes the thick outer skin of some types of fruits such as an orange and melon , which is fully in accordance with our research idea , i.e. rind can keep the inside fresh .
actually , the rind groups provide us great opportunities to study a variety of low - coordinate compounds of the main group elements [ 34,48 - 62 ] and coordinatively unsaturated transition metal complexes [ 63 - 71 ] .

in this review , we describe the recent progress in developing organic pi - electron architectures featuring si = si double bonds , mainly focusing on the following four topics : ( 1 ) oligo ( p - phenylenedisilenylene ) s ; pi - conjugation between benzene rings and si = si units , ( 2 ) air - stable emissive disilenes with naphthyl groups ; potential applicability in electroluminescence devices , ( 3 ) disilene pi - system with pyrenyl groups ; evidence for intramolecular charge - transfer emission , and ( 4 ) disilene - thiophene pi - systems ; future organosilicon chemistry for developing advanced materials .
2. oligo ( p - phenylenedisilenylene ) s ; pi - conjugation between benzene rings and si = si units poly ( p - phenylenevinylene ) s ( ppvs ) with alternating benzene rings and c = c double bonds are some of the most attractive conducting polymers due to their excellent stability and processability and unique electronic and optical properties , which can be used for various applications in modern electrochemistry [ 72,73 ] .
oligo ( p - phenylenevinylene ) s ( opvs ) have also received extensive attention as linear monodispersed pi - conjugated oligomers with well - defined molecular structures and tunable optoelectronic properties [ 74 - 76 ] .
since the si = si units possess a narrower energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( homo - lumo ) relative to the c = c units [ 12 - 22 ] , the disilene analogs of opvs , oligo ( p - phenylenedisilenylene ) s ( si - opvs ) , would provide new opportunities for application to a range of organic electronic devices .
in 2007 , model systems of the si - opvs ( 8a and 9 - 11 ) were synthesized by the groups of scheschkewitz and tamao employing the bulky tip ( 2,4,6 - triisopropylphenyl ) and eind ( r1 = r2 = r3 = r4 = et ) groups [ 77,78 ] .
as shown in scheme 1 , the phenyl - substituted disilene , ( tip ) 2si = si ( tip ) ph ( 8a ) , and the para - phenylene - bridged tetrasiladiene 9 can be obtained as yellow and red crystals in 58 % and 72 % yields by the reaction of the isolatable disilenyllithium , ( tip ) 2si = si ( tip ) li ( dme ) 2 ( dme = 1,2 - dimethoxyethane ) ( 12 ) [ 79 ] , which is a silicon analog of vinyllithium , with iodobenzene and 1,4 - diiodobenzene .
in contrast , compounds 10 and 11 have been prepared by the reductive co - condensation of the two kinds of dibromosilanes , ( eind ) phsibr2 ( 13 ) and [( eind ) sibr2 ] 2 ( 1,4 - c6h4 ) ( 14 ) , with a 5:1 molar ratio using lithium naphthalenide ( linaph ) as a homogeneous reducing agent ( scheme 2 ) , in which 13 and 14 serve as the end - capping unit and central building unit for the si - opvs , respectively .
the resulting monomer 10 and dimer 11 can be separated by silica gel column chromatography in a glove box using hexane and toluene as the eluents , leading to the isolation of yellow - orange crystals of 10 in 35 % yield and red crystals of 11 in 15 % yield .
however , the higher oligomers , such as the trimer and tetramer , could not be obtained in a pure form mainly due to their poor solubility in common organic solvents .

in addition to the initial achievements , scheschkewitz et al. prepared a series of para - functionalized - phenyl - substituted disilenes , ( tip ) 2si = si ( tip )( 4 - x - ph ) ( x = f ( 8b ) , cl ( 8c ) , br ( 8d ) , i ( 8e ) , sime3 ( 8f )) [ 80 ] , which are shown in figure 3 .
the laterally functionalized disilenes 8b - e can be synthesized by a similar reaction between the disilenyllithium 12 and the para - functionalized - phenyl iodides ( 4 - x - phi ) .
in addition , the para - trimethylsilylphenyldisilene 8f has been obtained as a major product by the reaction of the para - bromophenyldisilene 8d with 2 equiv of tert - butyllithium ( tbuli ) followed by the addition of trimethylchlorosilane ( me3sicl ) .
the disilenes 8a - d exhibit a good correlation of the ultraviolet - visible ( uv - vis ) absorptions with the electronic hammett parameters .
as shown in figure 3 , the meta - phenylene - bridged tetrasiladiene ( 15 ) , which is a regioisomer of 9 , has also been isolated as orange crystals in 85 % yield by the reaction of 12 with 1,3 - diiodobenzene [ 80 ] .
as shown in scheme 3 , we have recently obtained the new si - opvs ( 16 - 19 ) having the modified rind group , ( hexo ) meind group , with a hexyloxy chain at the para position of the meind ( r1 = r2 = me , r3 = r4 = et ) group for improving their solubility [ 81 ] .
a similar one - pot reductive co - condensation reaction of [( hexo ) meind ] - phsibr2 ( 20 ) and [{( hexo ) meind } sibr2 ] 2 ( 1,4 - c6h4 ) ( 21 ) in a 2:1 molar ratio has led to the successful isolation of the yellow crystals of the monomer 16 in 10 % yield , deep red crystals of the dimer 17 in 39 % , a purple powder of the trimer 18 in 7 % yield , and a deep purple powder of the tetramer 19 in 5 % yield , which can be separated by silica gel column chromatography in a glove box using toluene and tetrahydrofuran ( thf ) as the eluents .

figure 4 shows the molecular structures of 16 and 17 based on the single - crystal x - ray diffraction analysis .
the bulky ( hexo ) meind groups effectively encapsulate the reactive si = si units and produce the highly coplanar si - opvs pi - frameworks .
the selected structural parameters of 16 and 17 are summarized in table 1 , together with those of 8a - d , 9 - 11 , and 15 for comparison .
the disilene cores of 16 and 17 display an almost planar geometry .
the trans - bent angles ( theta ) between the si - si vector and the c - si - c plane are estimated to be 1.65 ( 8 ) degrees for 16 and 0.62 ( 12 ) and 3.38 ( 13 ) degrees for 17 , which are comparable to those of 10 ( theta = 2.72 ( 14 ) degrees ) and 11 ( theta = 0.7 ( 3 ) and 2.7 ( 3 ) degrees ) and much smaller than those of 8a ( theta = 22.8 and 22.0degrees ) , 9 ( theta = 16.45 ( 10 ) and 19.31 ( 10 ) degrees ) , and 15 ( theta = 20.3 and 26.7degrees ) .
these x - ray data show the excellent structural controllability of the rind groups , where the proximate ethyl side chains on the s - hydrindacene skeletons can interlock with one another above and below the si = si moieties to enforce the planar structure .

the absorption color gradually changes from yellow for 16 to blue for 19 , as shown in figure 5 ( a ) .
the uv - vis spectra in thf exhibit absorption maxima ( lambda max ( abs )) at 465 nm for 16 , 546 nm for 17 , 581 nm for 18 , and 610 nm for 19 , some of which are comparable to those of the eind - based si - opvs ( 461 nm for 10 and 543 nm for 11 in hexane ) .
the high molar extinction coefficients of 16 - 19 ( epsilon = 2.8 - 7.1 x 104 cm - 1 m - 1 ) are assignable to the allowed homo - - > lumo ( pi - - > pi *) transitions , which are supported by the theoretical calculations using time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) [ 82 ] .
it should be noted that the lambda max ( abs ) values of 10 ( 461 nm ) and 16 ( 465 nm ) are more than 40 nm red - shifted from that of tetramesityldisilene 1 ( 420 nm ) [ 6 ] , indicating the pi - conjugation over the 1,2 - diphenyldisilene ( disilastilbene ) skeleton .
in addition , the considerable bathochromic shifts with the increasing si = si units are most likely interpreted in terms of the extended pi - conjugation over the entire si - opvs skeleton , thus providing clear evidence for the efficient pi - conjugation between the benzene rings and si = si double bonds .
the lambda max ( abs ) values provide a good fit to meier 's equation [ 83 ] , which enables the estimation of an effective conjugation length ( ecl ) of nine repeat units ( n ecl = 9 ) and the absorption maximum of 635 nm for the infinite chain ( lambda infinity ( abs ) = 635 nm ) .
these estimated values ( n ecl = 9 and lambda infinity ( abs ) = 635 nm ) for the si - opvs are lower and longer than those of the carbon counterpart , opvs ( n ecl = 11 and lambda infinity ( abs ) = 481 nm ) , respectively [ 84 ] .
thus , the inclusion of the si = si double bonds into the carbon pi - conjugated systems may cause a significant change in the electronic and absorption properties .

while the monomer 16 does not show any emission like 10 , the dimer 17 , trimer 18 , and tetramer 19 exhibit an intense fluorescence in thf at room temperature ( figure 5 ( b )) .
the emission maxima ( lambda max ( ex )) are observed at 613 nm for 17 , 643 nm for 18 , and 668 nm for 19 , one of which is similar to that of 11 ( 612 nm ) .
the quantum yields ( phif ) increased from 0.11 to 0.48 with the increasing number of repeated units .
in contrast , the stokes shifts ( deltanu stokes ) decreased from 2000 cm - 1 for 17 to 1420 cm - 1 for 19 , which are lower than those of the flexible carbon - based opvs ( 3199 - 3029 cm - 1 ) [ 83 ] and higher than those of the rigid carbon - bridged opvs ( 772 - 583 cm - 1 ) [ 85 ] , suggesting the moderate rigidity of the si - opvs frameworks supported by the perpendicularly - fixed ( hexo ) meind groups .
these studies reveal the possibility of constructing the pi - conjugated disilene systems alternating the carbon - based 2ppi and silicon - based 3ppi - electrons , where the si = si double bonds would be promising building blocks .
we hope that the present studies would provide a further challenge for the pure and applied chemistry of disilene copolymers containing various carbon pi - electron systems .
actually , we very recently succeeded in obtaining some disilene - thiophene pi - systems as model compounds for the disilene - thiophene copolymers [ 86 ] , which are described in the latter part of this review .
3. air - stable emissive disilenes with naphthyl groups ; potential applicability in electroluminescence devices after the initial findings of the model compounds of the si - opvs , the pi - electron systems containing a si = si chromophore attracted much attention from the viewpoint of their potentially useful properties and unique functions .
for example , as shown in figure 6 , a new type of disilene bearing metallocenyl groups has been synthesized by sasamori , tokitoh , and co - workers [ 87,88 ] .
the 1,2 - bis ( metallocenyl ) disilenes ( 22 ) exhibit a multistep redox process in the cyclic voltammograms , thus indicating the potential application of the disilene pi - system as electrochemical materials .
tokitoh et al. have also shown that the 1,2 - dialkynyldisilenes ( 23 ) can be obtained as a stable crystalline compound by taking advantage of the steric protection using the bulky bbt groups ( bbt = 2,6 - bis [ bis ( trimethylsilyl ) methyl ] - 4 - [ tris ( trimethylsilyl ) methyl ] phenyl ) ( figure 6 ) [ 89 ] .
the uv - vis spectrum of 23b in hexane exhibits an absorption maximum ( lambda max ( abs )) at 469 nm , which is 32 nm red - shifted compared with that of 23a ( 437 nm ) , indicating the effective pi - conjugation between the central si = si unit and two terminal phenyl groups via the c = c triple bonds .
we have set out to investigate the other types of disilene pi - systems with two polycyclic aromatic groups on the si = si core incorporating the two bulky rind groups .
as the first target molecules , we designed two kinds of 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilene regioisomers , ( e ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - naphthyl ) disilene ( 24 ) and ( e ) - 1,2 - di ( 2 - naphthyl ) - disilene ( 25 ) , as shown in schemes 4 and 5 [ 90,91 ] .
the disilenes 24 and 25 were obtained as red crystals in 59 % and 57 % yields , respectively , by the reductive coupling of ( eind )( 1 - naphthyl ) sibr2 ( 26 ) and ( eind )( 2 - naphthyl ) sibr2 ( 27 ) .
the disilenes 24 and 25 are extraordinarily air - stable in the solid state of more than several years with no detectable change as confirmed by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1h nmr ) spectra , which indicates the excellent protection abilities of the eind group .
the disilenes 24 and 25 decompose in a dilute solution ( ca .
10 - 5 mol l - 1 ) upon exposure to air with a half - lifetime of 2 - 4 h , which is rather longer than that previously reported for ( tip ) 2si = si ( tip ) 2 ( 17 min ) [ 92 ] , as monitored by the uv - vis absorption spectroscopy .

figure 7 shows the molecular structures of 24 and 25 confirmed by x - ray crystallography .
both molecules have an inversion center at the midpoint of the si = si double bond with an e - configuration .
in the crystal of 24 , the hydrogen atoms at the peri - position on the 1 - naphthyl groups participate in the ch - pi interaction with the benzene ring of the perpendicularly - oriented eind groups , producing the highly coplanar di ( 1 - naphthyl ) disilene skeleton , favorable for the efficient pi - conjugation involving the si = si unit .
in the crystal of 25 , the si atoms and the 2 - naphthyl groups are disordered over the two positions , which corresponds to a mixture of two rotational isomers , s - cis , s - cis ( 25a ) and s - trans , s - trans ( 25b ) , with the occupancy factors of ca .
0.40 / 0.60 .
each rotational isomer has an essentially coplanar di ( 2 - naphthyl ) disilene framework .
the selected structural parameters of 24 , 25a , and 25b are summarized in table 1 .
the trans - bent angles ( theta ) are estimated to be 4.93 ( 12 ) degrees for 24 , 2.25 ( 14 ) degrees for 25a , and 9.57 ( 11 ) degrees for 25b .
the si = si bond distance is 2.1688 ( 7 ) a for 24 , 2.1623 ( 18 ) a for 25a , and 2.1667 ( 12 ) a for 25b , which are comparable to those of 10 ( 2.1593 ( 16 ) a ) , 11 ( 2.156 ( 2 ) a ) , 16 ( 2.1626 ( 8 ) a ) , and 17 ( 2.1642 ( 8 ) a ) and in the standard range of those reported for disilenes [ 15 ] .
as shown in figure 8 , the disilenes 24 and 25 exhibit a strong absorption and emission at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state mainly due to the highly coplanar 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilene pi - frameworks .
the photophysical data of 24 and 25 are summarized in table 2 .
in the uv - vis spectra in thf , the absorption maxima ( lambda max ( abs )) appear at 521 nm for 24 and 504 nm for 25 , which are red - shifted from that of 10 ( 461 nm ) , indicative of the effective pi - conjugation over the dinaphthyldisilene skeletons .
the emission maxima ( lambda max ( ex )) are found at 614 nm for 24 and at 586 nm for 25 .
the stokes shift ( deltanu stokes ) values are estimated to be 2910 cm - 1 for 24 and 2780 cm - 1 for 25 , which are higher than that of 11 ( 2080 cm - 1 ) but much lower than those of the tetramesityldisilene 1 ( 4000 cm - 1 ) [ 8 ] and tetraneopentyldisilene ( 7300 cm - 1 ) [ 93 ] , thus indicating the structural rigidity of the dinaphthyldisilene skeletons .
each of the disilenes 24 and 25 shows a weaker emission in solution relative to that in the solid state mainly ascribed to the free - rotation of the naphthyl groups around the si - c bonds in solution .
figure 9 shows the frontier molecular orbitals of 24 , 25a , and 25b afforded by the dft computations at the b3lyp / 6 - 31g ** level [ 82 ] .
while the homos mainly consist of the pi ( si - si ) orbital , the lumos involve the appreciable contribution of the pi *( si - si ) - pi *( naphthalene ) conjugation .
the homo and lumo energy levels of 24 ( - 4.209 and - 1.572 ev ) are somewhat higher and lower than those of 25a ( - 4.249 and - 1.554 ev ) and 25b ( - 4.304 and - 1.478 ev ) .
accordingly , the homo - lumo energy gap for 24 ( 2.637 ev ) is slightly smaller than those of 25a ( 2.695 ev ) and 25b ( 2.826 ev ) .
these calculations are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data , a slightly longer absorption maximum ( lambda max ( abs )) for 24 ( 521 nm ) relative to 25 ( 504 nm ) , which are based on the fact that the larger homo and lumo lobes are at the 1 - position than at the 2 - position of the naphthalene ring .
the resulting 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilenes 24 and 25 also exhibit a high thermal stability with a decomposition point of 245 - 248 degreesc for 24 and 282 - 285 degreesc for 25 under an argon atmosphere .
the exceptional air and thermal stabilities would open up new opportunities for application in a range of organic electronic devices , since the si = si unit possesses a narrower homo - lumo energy gap than the c = c unit [ 12 - 22 ] .
actually , as shown in figure 10 , we have found that the disilene 25 can emit light in an organic light - emitting diode ( oled ) [ 94 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of electroluminescence ( el ) from a disilene compound in oleds .
a typical multi - thin - layer pattern has been used for the oleds , in which three organic molecular layers , i.e. poly ( 3,4 - ethylenedioxythiophene ) - poly ( styrenesulfonate ) ( pedot - pss ) [ 95 ] as the hole - injecting layer , the disilene 25 with a host molecule of poly ( 9,9 - dioctylfluorene ) ( pfo ) in the weight ratio of 1:1 as the light - emitting and hole transporting layer , and 2,2 ' , 2 '' - ( 1,3,5 - benzinetriyl ) - tris ( 1 - phenyl - 1 - h - benzimidazole ) ( tpbi ) as the hole - blocking and electron - transporting layer , are sandwiched between a transparent ito ( indium tin oxide ) anode and metallic lif / al cathode on a glass substrate .
this device emits a bright orange light from the disilene 25 at the applied voltage of 5 v. although the total performance is rather low and still far from a practical application ( the maximum brightness of l max = 119 cd m - 2 at the driving voltage of 8.5 v , the luminance efficiency eta 100 and the current efficiency l / j 100 at a luminance of 100 cd m - 2 of 0.013 lm w - 1 and 0.035 cd a - 1 , the external quantum efficiency ( eqe ) of 0.014 % , and the half - life of 76.5 min of the orange light emission at a 25 ma cm - 2 current density with the initial light output of 14.6 cd m - 2 ) , this study provides a new avenue for investigations to explore the applied chemistry of unsaturated compounds of the heavier main group elements .
the air - stable , emissive 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilenes 24 and 25 are now commercially available [ 96 ] .
4. disilene pi - system with pyrenyl groups ; evidence for intramolecular charge - transfer emission following the successful achievements of the ( e ) - 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilenes 24 and 25 , we focused on the development of further pi - extended disilene molecules .
for example , ( e ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - pyrenyl ) disilene ( 28 ) can be considered as a fascinating pi - system with two pi - extended pyrenyl groups consisting of four fused benzene rings .
as shown in scheme 6 , we have examined the reductive treatment of the eind - and 1 - pyrenyl - substituted dibromosilane , ( eind )( 1 - pyrenyl ) sibr2 ( 30 ) , with a sufficient amount of lithium naphthalenide ( linaph ) in thf .
however , unexpectedly , we obtained the z isomer , ( z ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - pyrenyl ) disilene ( 29 ) , as purple crystals in 43 % yield [ 97 ] .
the disilene 29 is not very stable in the air and even in the solid state , which is in sharp contrast to the fact that the red crystals of ( e ) - 1,2 - dinaphthyldisilenes 24 and 25 can survive in the air for more than several years .
although the formation mechanism of 29 is not yet clear , this is the first selective formation of the z isomer of the acyclic disilene by the reductive coupling of monosilane precursors .
the attractive pi - pi interaction between the pyrenyl groups may play a role in determining the stereochemistry during in the si - si bond - forming processes .
scheme 6 .
synthesis of compound 29 .
as shown in figure 11 , the molecular structure of 29 has been unambiguously characterized by x - ray crystallography to adopt a z - configuration .
the two eind groups and the two 1 - pyrenyl groups mesh in a gear - like fashion centering around the disilene core with the si = si bond length of 2.1718 ( 6 ) a and the trans - bent angles ( theta ) of 8.22 ( 8 ) and 2.96 ( 8 ) degrees ( table 1 ) .
the two pyrene rings are twisted about the si = si unit with the si - si - c - c torsion angles of 52.66 ( 13 ) degrees and 48.73 ( 14 ) degrees , which intramolecularly interact with each other to have a pi - pi stacking with a distance between the centers of the two pyrene rings of 3.635 a. the photophysical data of 29 are summarized in table 2 .
in the uv - vis spectrum of 29 in thf , two broad absorption bands are observed with the absorption maxima ( lambda max ( abs )) at 519 and 575 nm , together with a strong absorption around 350 nm due to the pyrene ring itself .
the lambda max ( abs ) values are found to be not sensitive to the solvent polarity .
in contrast , as shown in figure 12 , the emission maximum ( lambda max ( ex )) of 29 is dependent on the solvent polarity and red - shifted from 661 nm in hexane to 676 nm in thf and to 694 nm in acetone ( dielectric constant : hexane 1.88 , thf 7.58 , acetone 20.56 ) [ 98 ] .
these data indicate the intramolecular charge - transfer ( ict ) emission at room temperature , which may originate from the arrangement of the two 1 - pyrenyl groups twisted from the si = si double bond .
the photophysical properties of 29 are theoretically supported by dft studies including excited - state calculations [ 97 ] .
figure 13 shows the three pertinent molecular orbitals of 29 .
although the homo is represented by the pi ( si - si ) orbital , the lumo involves a substantial pi *( si - si ) - pi *( pyrene ) conjugation .
the lumo + 1 corresponds to the pi *( pyrene ) orbital .
the natural population analysis ( npa ) charge distribution [ 99 ] exhibits a more charge - separated character for the ( z ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - pyrenyl ) disilene skeleton in the excited state compared to the ground state , which is consistent with the pi ( si - si ) - - > pi *( pyrene ) ict excited state based on the electron transfer from the disilene pi - donor toward the pyrene pi - acceptor .
as shown in figure 14 , in regard to the ict behavior of the disilenes , a unique ict absorption by 9 - anthryl - substituted trialkyldisilene ( 31 ) has been found by iwamoto , kira , and co - workers , in which the anthracene ring is orthogonal to the si = si unit [ 100 ] .
the disilene 31 can be obtained as blue - purple crystals by the reaction of the corresponding trialkyldisilenide with 9 - bromoanthracene .
iwamoto et al. also very recently reported a series of heteroaryl - substituted disilenes ( 32a - c and 33a - c ) , where heteroaryl groups serve as electron acceptors for si = si double bonds in ict transitions [ 101 ] .
these disilenes can also be prepared by the treatment of the corresponding dialkylaryldisilenide with heteroaryl halides and dihalides .
in the crystal structures of 32a , 32b , 33b , and 33c , the heteroaryl groups are almost perpendicular to the si = si double bond mainly due to the steric repulsion between the bulky cyclic alkyl substituents , mesityl group , and the heteroaryl groups .
very recently , scheschkewitz et al. also reported the photophysical properties of some related ( oligo ) aromatic species having one or two si = si double bonds ( 34a - d and 35a - d ) , which have been prepared by the reaction of the triaryldisilenide 12 with aryl halides and dihalides [ 102 ] .
the tetrasiladienes 35b - d exhibit a fluorescence at room temperature .
dft calculations suggest the partial ct character of the excited state .
it is important to note that the 9,10 - anthracene - bridged tetrasiladiene 35d is the first example of a near - infrared emissive disilene compound (( lambda max ( ex )) = 816 nm ) .
in order to obtain the initial target molecule , ( e ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - pyrenyl ) disilene 28 , we examined the photoreaction of 29 [ 103 ] .
as shown in figure 16 , after the photolysis ( lambda = 530 nm ) of 29 in thf at room temperature , the solution color has changed from purple to blue .
in the uv - vis absorption spectrum , a relatively new sharp peak appeared around at 590 nm , which is 15 nm red - shifted from that of 29 ( 575 nm ) , with a higher molar extinction coefficient ( epsilon = 1.3 x 104 cm - 1 m - 1 ) relative to that of 29 ( epsilon = 7.2 x 103 cm - 1 m - 1 ) , thus indicating the formation of a more pi - extended system .
the absorption spectral change with an isosbestic point at 540 nm suggests a clean photoisomerization process from ( z ) - 29 to ( e ) - 28 .
unfortunately , the blue 28 has not yet been isolated in a pure form due to its labile nature , but the dft calculations indicate the highly coplanar ( e ) - 1,2 - di ( 1 - pyrenyl ) disilene skeleton induced by the orthogonal arrangement of the eind groups [ 90 ] .
in order to confirm the formation of 28 , we are now investigating on alternative synthetic route using the eind - substituted ( e ) - 1,2 - dibromosilane , ( eind ) brsi = sibr ( eind ) , as a precursor [ 54 ] .
5. disilene - thiophene pi - systems ; future organosilicon chemistry for developing advanced materials as already described , the construction of novel pi - conjugated disilene systems consisting of the carbon - based 2ppi and silicon - based 3ppi - electrons would provide exciting opportunities to explore new organosilicon chemistry for organic - inorganic hybrid materials , since the si = si units have a narrower homo - lumo gap compared to the c = c counterparts [ 12 - 22 ] .
very recently , we studied a new type of pi - conjugation between the si = si double bond and aromatic heterocycles .
as shown in figure 17 , we previously examined the synthesis and electronic properties of a series of oligothiophenes ( 36a - c ) with the bulky emind ( r1 = r2 = et , r3 = r4 = me ) groups [ 50 ] .
the orthogonal orientation of the emind groups has proven to be useful to produce a coplanar arrangement of oligothiophene backbones .
based on these fundamental investigations , we have set out to examine the possibility to construct disilene - thiophene pi - conjugated systems by the introduction of the rind groups .
as shown in schemes 7 and 8 , we have designed and synthesized two new disilenes , 1,2 - bis ( thiophen - 2 - yl ) disilene ( 37 ) and 1,2 - bis ( 2,2 ' - bithiophen - 5 - yl ) disilene ( 38 ) , as model compounds of the disilene - thiophene copolymers [ 86 ] .
the disilenes 37 and 38 can be isolated as orange and purple crystals , respectively , by the reduction of the corresponding thienyl - and bithienyl - substituted dibromosilanes ( 39 and 40 ) .

scheme 8 .
synthesis of compound 38 .
figure 18 shows the x - ray molecular structures of 37 and 38 .
each molecule has an inversion center at the middle of the si = si double bond with an e configuration .
as shown in figure 19 , there were found several rotational isomers of 37 and 38 in the crystals .
for 37 , the thiophene units are disordered over the two positions with the occupancy factors of ca .
0.90 / 0.10 , which is consistent with the existence of a mixture of three rotational isomers , s - cis , s - cis ( 37a ) , s - cis , s - trans ( 37b ) , and s - trans , s - trans ( 37c ) , with the occupancy factors of ca .
0.81 / 0.18 / 0.01 .
for 38 , while the inner thiophene rings are ordered in the crystal with an s - trans , s - trans conformation , the outer thiophene rings are disordered over the two orientations with the occupancy factors of ca .
0.76 / 0.24 .
thus , the three rotational isomers , anti - ( s - trans , s - trans ) - anti ( 38a ) , syn - ( s - trans , s - trans ) - anti ( 38b ) , and syn - ( s - trans , s - trans ) - syn ( 38c ) , exist in the crystal with the ratio of ca .
0.58 / 0.36 / 0.06 .
it is worth mentioning that all the nmr data for 37 and 38 indicate the free - rotation around the si - c bonds and the exocyclic c - c bonds in solution at room temperature on the nmr time scale .
the major structural parameters of 37 and 38 are summarized in table 1 .
the disilene 37 has a trans - bent structure with the trans - bent angles ( theta ) of 19.12 ( 12 ) degrees for 37a and 37b and 13.5 ( 6 ) degrees for 37b and 37c .
the si atoms assume a somewhat pyramidal geometry with the sum of the bond angles around the si atom ( sigmasi ) of ca .
355.5 - 357.5degrees .
the disilene core of 38 exhibits a more coplanar arrangement relative to 37 with the trans - bent angle ( theta ) of 5.44 ( 10 ) degrees .
the si atoms have an almost planar geometry ; the sum of the bond angles around the si atom ( sigmasi ) is 359.7degrees .
the bithiophene moieties in 38 are slightly twisted with the dihedral angles between the inner and outer thiophene rings of 21.0 ( 3 ) degrees for 38a and 38b and 28.6 ( 10 ) degrees for 38b and 38c .
the si = si double bond lengths of 2.1712 ( 11 ) a for 37 and 2.1584 ( 9 ) a for 38 are in the range of those for typical disilenes [ 16 ] .
the photophysical data of 37 and 38 are summarized in table 2 .
as shown in figure 20 , the absorption color clearly changes from the yellow of 37 to the red - purple of 38 .
in the uv - vis spectrum of 37 in thf , the absorption maximum ( lambda max ( abs )) appears at 459 nm , comparable to that of 10 ( 461 nm ) , which indicates the efficient pi - conjugation between the si = si double bond and the two thiophene moieties .
for 38 , the absorption peak is observed at 530 nm , which is 71 nm red - shifted from that of 37 ( 459 nm ) and similar to that of 11 ( 543 nm ) .
this large bathochromic shift is most likely interpreted in terms of the extension of the pi - conjugation with the increasing number of thiophene units .
in addition , the lambda max ( abs ) value of 38 is 116 nm longer than that of the emind - substituted quaterthiophene 36a ( 414 nm in ch2cl2 ) [ 50 ] .
thus , the insertion of the si = si double bond into the quaterthiophene skeleton causes a considerable narrowing of the homo - lumo gap .
as shown in figure 20 , the pi - extended disilene 38 displays a weak but distinct emission both in solution and in the solid state , while the disilene 37 does not show any emission at room temperature .
the emission maximum ( lambda max ( ex )) of 38 appears at 688 nm in thf with the quantum yield ( phif ) of 0.01 .
the stokes shift ( deltanu stokes ) of 38 ( 4330 cm - 1 ) is more than twice as high as that of 11 ( 2080 cm - 1 ) .
these emission properties in solution may be explained by the structural flexibility of the 1,2 - bis ( bithienyl ) disilene skeleton compared to the 1,4 - bis ( disilenyl ) benzene skeleton .
the disilene 38 exhibits a relatively strong emission at 691 nm in the solid state with the quantum yield ( phif ) of 0.11 , which is about 10 times stronger than that in solution .
the weaker emission in solution is attributable to the free - rotation of the bithienyl groups around the si - c bonds and the exocyclic c - c bonds as observed in the 1h nmr spectrum .
in order to further clarify the structural and electronic properties of the disilenes 37 and 38 , we performed dft calculations at the b3lyp - d3 / 6 - 31g ( d,p ) level [ 82 ] .
the dft studies indicated a rather flexible geometry around the disilene core in 37 .
thus , the optimized structures of 37a ( c i symmetry ) , 37b ( c s symmetry ) , and 37c ( c 1 symmetry ) exhibit an entirely coplanar 1,2 - dithienyldisilene skeleton ( theta = 0.0 - 0.1degrees ) , which are different from the x - ray structures ( theta = 19.12 ( 12 ) degrees and 13.5 ( 6 ) degrees ) found in the crystal .
these rotational isomers have almost the same energies with the relative energies of 0.00 ( 37a ) , 1.12 ( 37b ) , and 2.48 ( 37c ) kcal mol - 1 .
the optimized structure of 38a ( c 1 symmetry ) shows a slightly more trans - bent configuration ( theta = 10.8degrees ) relative to that found in the crystal ( theta = 5.44 ( 10 ) degrees ) .
the dihedral angles between the inner and outer thiophene rings are estimated to be 17.8degrees , which are somewhat smaller than those of the experimental x - ray values ( 21.0 ( 3 ) degrees and 28.6 ( 10 ) degrees ) .
the differences between the x - ray and dft structures are mainly due to the flexibility of the main chains consisting of the si = si unit and the thiophene rings , which would be easily affected by the crystal packing forces .
the molecular orbitals of 37a and 38a are depicted in figure 21 in which the homos mainly consist of the pi ( si - si ) orbital along with a small contribution of the pi ( thiophene ) and pi ( bithiophene ) orbitals , while the lumos delocalize over the entire 1,2 - dithienyldisilene and 1,2 - bis ( bithienyl ) disilene frameworks .
the homo level of 38a ( - 4.211 ev ) is comparable to that of 37a ( - 4.222 ev ) , while the lumo level of 38a ( - 1.681 ev ) is much lower than that of 37a ( - 1.350 ev ) due to the extended pi *( si - si ) - pi *( bithiophene ) conjugation .
the homo - lumo energy gap for 38a ( 2.530 ev ) is smaller than that for 37a ( 2.871 ev ) , which are in good agreement with the uv - vis absorption data .
the td - dft calculations almost reproduce the absorption spectra with the absorption wavelengths at 466 nm for 37a and 558 nm for 38a , which are comparable to those observed for 37 ( 459 nm ) and 38 ( 530 nm ) , assignable to the homo - - > lumo ( pi - pi *) transitions .
in this study , we have demonstrated for the first time that the si = si double bond can fully conjugate with aromatic heterocycles using the appropriate steric effects due to the bulky eind groups .
the experimental and theoretical studies provide clear evidence for the effective pi - conjugation between the si = si chromophore and thiophene units , originating from the essentially coplanar ( bi ) thiophene - si = si - ( bi ) thiophene skeletons .
further studies to develop promising disilene - thiophene copolymers for future application in a range of organic electronic devices are now in progress .
6. concluding remarks in this review , we have addressed the recent progress related to the chemistry of pi - electron systems containing si = si double bonds .
especially , the unique steric effects of the fused - ring bulky rind groups enabled us to isolate a series of structurally well - defined discrete pi - conjugated disilene molecules , which exhibit an efficient delocalization of 2ppi - and 3ppi - electrons over the skeletons .
in other words , the properly designed bulky protecting groups play pivotal roles in the structural determination and in the control of the electronic properties in the pi - electron systems consisting of the carbon pi - systems and si = si double bond ( s ) .
we hope that the present studies will provide a future challenge of pure and applied organoelement chemistry toward advanced materials science and technology .
as shown in figure 22 , after the achievement of the first persila [ n ] annulene compound , i.e. tetrasilacyclobutadiene ( n = 4 ) ( 7 ) [ 34 ] , extensive efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of hexasilabenzene ( n = 6 ) ( 41 ) with a cyclic system consisting of the six formally sp 2 - hybridized silicon atoms .
the hexasilabenzene 41 can be regarded as the smallest fragment for silicene [ 1 - 3 ] , the silicon analog of graphene with a two - dimensional honeycomb structure .
although some related hexasilabenzene isomers ( 5 , 42 , and 43 ) were synthesized as a stable crystalline compound [ 32,104,105 ] , the long - considered hexasilabenzene 41 has not been isolated and remains elusive .
in particular , novel electronic and optical properties as well as exotic silicon aromaticity arising from the six 3ppi - electrons in 41 have attracted much attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians [ 106 ] .
also , as shown in figure 23 , a silicon analog of the linear polyacetylene , i.e. polysilyne ( 44 ) , with repeating disilyne ( rsi = sir ) units , has yet to be achieved and remains as a dream compound for chemists , which would provide new opportunities for application in a range of electronic devices , because the si = si units have a smaller homo - lumo energy gap compared to the c = c units .
some silicon analogs of 1,3 - butadiene , i.e. the tetrasila - 1,3 - butadienes ( 45 - 47 ) , have been obtained employing the bulky substituents [ 107 - 109 ] .
we hope that further progress will be made in the construction and functions of the cyclic and linear pi - electron systems involving the si = si double bonds .

( sr , ca , ba ) al2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors were prepared via a high temperature solid - state reaction method .
the correlation of phase structure , optical properties and lifetimes of the phosphors are investigated in this work .
for the ( sr , ca ) al2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors , the different phase formation from monoclinic sral2o4 phase to hexagonal sral2o4 phase to monoclinic caal2o4 phase was observed when the ca content increased .
the emission color of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors varied from green to blue .
for the ( sr , ba ) al2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors , different phase formation from the monoclinic sral2o4 phase to the hexagonal baal2o4 phase was observed , along with a shift of emission wavelength from 520 nm to 500 nm. more interestingly , the decay time of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + changed due to the different phase formations .
lifetime can be dramatically shortened by the substitution of sr2 + with ba2 + cations , resulting in improving the performance of the alternating current light emitting diode ( ac - led ) .
finally , intense leds are successfully obtained by combining these phosphors with ga ( in ) n near uv chips .
phosphors solid solution average lifetime ac - leds photoluminescence 1 .
introduction ac - led is a new type of device that can be directly driven by the alternating current of city power .
it has experienced rapid development and is widely applied in indoor and outdoor lighting due to its long life , low price , high efficiency , etc .
[ 1,2,3,4 ]. however , the vital defect of the ac - led is the flickering effect , with a time gap of 5 - 20 ms [ 4,5,6 ] , resulting in visual fatigue and health hazards .
there have been several solutions to reduce flashing in ac - led , such as using a converter - free ac - led driver , increasing drive frequency etc .
however , these solutions suffer from low power efficiency or large size .
fortunately , the use of long afterglow phosphors is considered to be a promising method to compensate for the time gap and reduce the flickering effect .
long afterglow phosphors , such as srsi2o2n2 : eu2 + , mn2 + [ 2 ] , sral2o4 : eu2 + , ce3 + , li + [ 5 ] , and sral2o4 : eu2 + , and re3 + ( re = y , dy ) have been studied and applied to ac - leds [ 4,7 ] .
sral2o4 : eu2 + is one of green phosphors for uvleds .
when it is co - doped with re3 + ( re = dy , y , nd and ho ) , sral2o4 : eu2 + , re3 + can store electrons to achieve long and persistent luminescence .
however , the afterglow time of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + is too long to fulfill the requirement of ac - led .
in our previous research , we shortened the average lifetime of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors from 845.86 ms to 428.83 ms by changing the amount of srcl2 flux .
moreover , mal2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + ( m = ca2 + , sr2 + , ba2 +) phosphors with different cations also have different defect levels and afterglow times [ 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 ] .
therefore , the substitution of sr2 + by ca2 + or ba2 + ions in sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors is expected to tune the afterglow time .
furthermore , the emission and excitation spectra of eu2 + ions can also be modified by the different radius of ca2 + , sr2 + and ba2 + ions and crystal structures [ 13,14,15,16 ] .
this paper aims to improve the emission color and the average lifetime of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors by partially substituting sr2 + with ca2 + or ba2 + ions .
the effect and correlation of ca2 + or ba2 + ions substitution on the obtained phases , optical properties , and decay times of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors are systematically investigated .
the electroluminescent properties of the as - fabricated leds based on uv - chips and mal2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + ( m = ca2 + , sr2 + , ba2 +) phosphors are also investigated .
2. experimental procedure sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + samples ( x or y = 0.00 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 , 0.60 , 0.75 , 0.90 ) were prepared by a high temperature solid - state reaction method .
the raw materials caco3 ( 99.99 %) , srco3 ( 99.99 %) , baco3 ( 99.99 %) , al2o3 ( 99.99 %) , eu2o3 ( 99.99 %) , dy2o3 ( 99.99 %) and h3bo3 ( 99.99 %) were weighted stoichiometrically .
the original materials were mixed into an agate mortar and placed into a small alumina crucible .
then , the mixtures were put into a tubular furnace and heated to 900 degreesc for 2 h. being reground , they were heated to 1400 degreesc for 4 h under a reductive atmosphere from burning activated carbon .
finally , the samples were cooled to room temperature , resulting in sr0.9 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + , and sr0.9 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + compounds .
the structure of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + , and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors were explored by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) using a diffractometer ( x ' pert pro , panalytical , almelo , netherlands ) with cu kalpha radiation at 40 kv and 20 ma. the data were collected in the 2theta range of 10degrees to 80degrees .
the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra and decay curves were performed by a spectrofluorometer ( f - 4600 , hitachi , tokyo , japan ) equipped with a 150w xe lamp as the light source .
the phosphors were pre - coated on near - uv ga ( in ) n chips with 365 and 395 nm emission , respectively .
the emission spectra and parameters of the as - fabricated leds were measured by the led spectrophotocolorimeter ( pms 50 , everfine co. , ltd. , hangzhou , china ) with an integrating sphere of 50 cm diameter .
the normal forward - bias current was 20 ma. all measurements were conducted at room temperature .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
x - ray diffraction analysis xrd patterns of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + ( x = 0.00 - 0.90 ) phosphors with various x values are depicted in figure 1a .
the patterns are compared with the jcpds standard cards of possible phases and marked with different symbols .
for x ( ca2 +) = 0.00 , the diffraction peaks are well matched with the monoclinic sral2o4 ( mp - sral2o4 , jcpds card no .
74 - 0794 ) , and minor content of the raw material - - al2o3 - - is observed due to the incomplete reaction , which is explained by our previous work [ 4 ] .
for x ( ca2 +) = 0.15 , the dominant phase is the hexagonal sral2o4 ( hp - sral2o4 , jcpds card no. 31 - 1336 ) .
thus , the different phase formation from the monoclinic to the hexagonal phase happens in sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors when the substitution of sr2 + by ca2 + increases from 0.00 to 0.15 .
the hexagonal phase remains when x ( ca2 +) = 0.30 .
simultaneously , the mp - sral2o4 disappears and minor content of monoclinic caal2o4 phase emerges .
the monoclinic caal2o4 phase ( mp - caal2o4 , cpds card no.53 - 0191 ) gradually increases with further elevating concentration of ca2 + from 0.45 to 0.75 , accompanying with the decrease of hp - sral2o4 .
for x ( ca2 +) = 0.90 , the dominant phase ismp - caal2o4 .
in general , as x ( ca2 +) varies from 0.00 to 0.90 , and the obtained phases can be varied as follows : mp - sral2o4 - - > hp - sral2o4 - - > mp - cal2o4 .
furthermore , it can be concluded that two different phase always coexist due to the cations substitution except for the samples with x ( ca2 +) = 0.00 and 0.90 .
the phase change is different with that of other report under different synthesized condition [ 13 ] .
unlike the substitution of sr2 + by ca2 + in sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors , there is only the variation from mp - sral2o4 to hexagonal baal2o4 phase ( hp - baal2o4 , jcpds card no. 17 - 0306 ) during the substitution of sr2 + by ba2 + .
the coexistence of two phases cannot be observed from the xrd data , as displayed in figure 2b .
specifically , when y ( ba2 +) = 0.00 - 0.30 , the crystal structure remains the mp - sral2o4 .
however , as y ( ba2 +) = 0.45 , the xrd patterns are consistent with the standard hp - baal2o4 .
it remains unchanged while y varies from 0.45 to 0.90 , which stems from the small radius of sr2 + compared to that of ba2 + and the effect of chemical pressure of ba2 + on the crystal structure .
therefore , the sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + compounds can be regarded as the hexagonal baal2o4phase replaced by sr2 + ions as y ( ba2 +) = 0.45 - 0.90 .
the different phase formation from mp - sral2o4 to hp - baal2o4 can be obtained when sr2 + is replaced by ba2 + in sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors .
another finding is that the peaks of the sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + shift toward larger 2theta with ca2 + concentration increased ( x = 0.45 - 0.90 ) , while the peaks of the sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + shift to smaller 2theta when ba2 + concentration increased ( y = 0.00 - 0.90 ) .
both of these shifts can be explained by the variation of crystal lattice due to the different ionic radius of ca2 + , sr2 + , and ba2 + ions of 0.114 nm , 0.123 nm and 0.134 nm , respectively [ 13,17 ] .
therefore , when sr2 + is replaced by ca2 + , the crystal lattice of sral2o4 phase will shrink .
on the contrary , it will expand when sr2 + is substituted by ba2 + .
therefore , the difference in the ionic radius leads to the shifts of the diffraction peaks .
3.2 .
luminescence properties of sr0.09 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors figure 2 illustrates the emission and excitation spectra of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05 eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors with x ( y ) ranged from 0.00 to 0.90 .
the excitation spectra of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors are depicted in figure 2a with monitoring the emission of eu2 + in the range of 440 - 510 nm. all samples present broad bands from 250 nm to 450 nm due to 4f7 - - > 4f65d1 transitions of eu2 + ions [ 18 ] .
the shape of excitation bands almost remain unchanged while the intensity decreases when x value ( x = 0.00 - 0.45 ) increases .
however , it should be noted that excitation bands are different from those of x < 0.60 .
the excitation bands of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + ( x = 0.60 - 0.90 ) are similar and blue - shift , which is ascribed to the phase variation as discussed in xrd analysis .
figure 2b shows the emission spectra of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors .
it can be divided into three sections ( x = 0 - 0.30 , x = 0.45 - 0.60 , x = 0.75 - 0.90 ) .
interestingly , these results are related to the phase transition .
first , the luminescence intensity decreases and the emission peak shifts from 520 nm to 538 nm as x varied from 0.00 to 0.30 .
second , two emission peaks around 450 nm , 540 nm at x = 0.45 - 0.60 are observed due to the coexistence of heterogeneous mixtures of two structures .
finally , the emission spectrum presents a single peak around 444 nm when x value increased from 0.75 to 0.90 , while the dominant phase is monoclinic caal2o4 .
the excitation and emission spectra of sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors are displayed in figure 2c,d. the excitation spectra show similar outlines with two broad bands around 275 nm , 375 nm and a shoulder around 420 nm. the broad emission bands originate from the typical transitions of 4f7 - - > 4f65d1 of eu2 + ions , which are affected by the crystal field of host lattice [ 19 ] .
the emission band shifts to a shorter wavelength from 520 nm to 500 nm as y ( ba2 +) increased .
it can be explained that the crystal field splitting energy is decreased due to the phase change of the substation of sr2 + by the larger ba2 + ions .
however , the luminescence intensity decreases when ba2 + content is 0.00 - 0.45 , while it increases when ba2 + content is 0.60 - 0.90.these changes match very well with the xrd results mentioned above and can be ascribed to eu2 + emission in different phase .
the cie chromaticity coordinates calculated from the spectra of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + and sr0.9 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors with varied x ( or y ) values are presented in figure 3 and table 1 .
these results show that the cie color coordinates of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors can be tuned by ca2 + or sr2 + content .
for sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors , the color coordinates can be changed from green ( 0.2393 , 0.5874 , point m ) to blue ( 0.1531 , 0.0528 , point a ) area with x increased .
in addition , the color coordinates of sr0.9 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors have a little shift from green ( 0.2399 , 0.5867 , point m ) to bluish green ( 0.1652 , 0.4645 , point b ) area .
the above discussion indicates that the emission color of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + can be tuned due to the phase change of the substitution of sr2 + with ca2 + or ba2 + ions .
it is an important challenge to tune the color of phosphors for improving the color rendering index of w - leds [ 20,21,22 ] .
3.3 .
decay characteristics the photoluminescence decay curves of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors with varied ca2 + and ba2 + content are shown in figure 4a,b , respectively .
the figures reveal the initial luminous intensity is different when sr2 + is replaced by either ca2 + or ba2 + in sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 +. among these phosphors , sr0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + has the highest initial luminous intensity .
the initial luminous intensity gradually decreases when the content of ca2 +( ba2 +) increased to 0.45. by further increasing the ca2 + or ba2 + concentration , the initial luminous intensity enhances .
the variation of initial luminous intensity is consistent with the emission spectra , which can be explained by the change of crystal structure .
moreover , the decay process of all samples is composed of fast decay , medium decay and subsequent of slow decay , which is consistent with our previous report .
the decay curves of ca0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + , sr0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + , and ba0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors are fitted as representatives , which are presented in figure 4c .
the decay curves are well fitted with the following triple exponential functions : ( 1 ) i ( t )= i0 + ae - t / tau1 + be - t / tau2 + ce - t / tau3 where t is the time , i0 and i is the luminescence intensity at initial time and t , respectively .
a , b and c are constants .
tau1 , tau2 , and tau3 are the decay time for the exponential components , respectively .
the average lifetimes can be obtained as follows .
the detail parameters are listed in table 2 .
( 2 ) tauaverage = integral0infinitytxi ( tau ) dtintegral0infinityi ( t ) dt on the basis of the equation ( 2 ) , the average lifetime ( tauaverage ) of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors with varied ca2 + and ba2 + contents are determined and shown in figure 4d , respectively .
the order of the average lifetimes is sr0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + > ca0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + > ba0.90al2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + .
the average lifetimes of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors vary with the change of ca2 + content , and the maximum is about 1088.5 ms at x = 0.45 .
it could be ascribed to the complicate formation of the phase in figure 1 .
furthermore , the average lifetimes of sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors gradually decrease with ba2 + content increased due to the different phase formation and reach the shortest time of 219.91 ms at y = 0.90 , demonstrating that the average lifetime or decay characteristics of sral2o4 : eu2 + .
dy3 + could be adjusted by the partial substitution of ba2 + , ca2 + .
the results also indicate that the tuned lifetimes are more suitable for the application in ac - leds as the global widely utilize 50 / 60 hz alternating current with a 5 - 20 ms dark duration .
3.4 .
application of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors with varied contents of ca2 + and ba2 + in leds finally , phosphors converted leds were fabricated with silicone , near uv - chips (~ 365 nm , 395 nm ) , sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + , and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors .
the phosphors account for 20 % of the mass of silicone .
figure 5 is the electroluminescence spectra of the as - fabricated leds based on sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors and near uv ga ( in ) n chips .
in the figure 4a , the shapes of all electroluminescence spectra in the as - fabricated leds are similar with the photoluminescence emission spectra of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors because the near uv around 365 nm of chips is completely absorbed by phosphors .
figure 5b depicts that the emission band located at 395 nm belongs to the uv - chips. and other emission bands are ascribed to eu2 + emissions excited by 395 nm uv - chips .
the results prove that the sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + fluorescence materials can absorb the light with wavelength of 365 nm or 395 nm , and convert it into green or blue visible - light .
the cie color coordinates of as - fabricated leds are calculated and listed in table 3 .
the inset of figure 5 presents the chromaticity diagram of the as - fabricated leds based on sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors , which can be tuned from green to blue area and are similar with that of phosphors .
in addition , the luminous efficiency is also systematically investigated under 20 ma forward - bias current in this work , as indicated in figure 5c .
the luminous efficiency of the as - fabricated leds with 395 nm is higher than in the case of 365 nm uv chips .
however , for both kinds of leds fabricated by 365 nm and 395 nm uv - chips , the luminous efficiency decreases strongly , then increases slowly with ca2 + content elevated .
the maximum luminous efficiency is 11.24 lm / w for 365 nm leds and 35.35 lm / w for 395 nm leds ( x = 0 ) .
the electroluminescence spectra of leds based on sr0.90 - xbaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors are also investigated , as shown in figure 6.except emission peaks of the uv chip itself , all of the electroluminescence spectra of sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + excited by both 365 nm and 395 nm uv - chips are similar .
it indicates that the sr0.9 - ybayal2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors can absorb 365 nm or 395 nm emission from ga ( n ) in chips , and convert it into green or blue - green visible - light .
the cie color coordinates of the as - fabricated leds are calculated and listed in table 4. by varying ba2 + concentrations , the color of the as - fabricated leds can be tuned , but the adjustable zone is narrower than in the case of ca2 + .
it suggests that the color coordinates of pc - leds cannot be influenced by near uv ga ( in ) n chips .
however , the luminous efficiency decreases at first , and then increases with ba2 + content enhanced .
the maximum luminous efficiency is 11.26 lm / w for 365 nm leds and 33.34 lm / w for 395 nm leds ( y = 0 ) .
the variation of luminous efficiency of the as - fabricated led is also consistent with the emission spectra due to the different phase formation .
4. conclusions sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + and sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + ( x or y = 0.00 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 , 0.60 , 0.75 , 0.90 ) phosphors were synthesized .
the variation of optical properties for the phosphors is ascribed to the phase structures .
for the series of sr0.90 - xcaxal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors , two heterogeneous structures coexist , except the samples with x ( ca2 +) = 0.00 and 0.90 .
the emission color of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphor can be adjusted largely from green to blue , and the lifetime can also be tuned largely from 1088.5 ms to 521.6 ms. for sr0.90 - ybayal2o4:0.05eu2 + , 0.05dy3 + phosphors , the phase transforms from monoclinic sral2o4 to hexagonal baal2o4 phase .
meanwhile , the emission wavelength shifts from 520 nm to 500 nm , and the color slightly changes from green to blue - green .
more importantly , the average lifetime of sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + can be shortened from 842.04 ms to 219.91 ms , which can appropriately compensate for the ac time gap .
finally , the leds are successfully fabricated by combining the phosphors with ga ( in ) n uv - chips .
the maximum of luminous efficiency reaches 33.34 lm / w based on sral2o4 : eu2 + , dy3 + phosphors .

moreover , its treatment is expensive , long , uncomfortable and of little effectiveness .
in this context , less than a quarter of allergic patients receive a treatment currently .
allergies have therefore become an important public health issue , highlighting the many unmet medical needs .
angany genetics has brought together expertise in protein genomics and in therapeutic protein production in plant expression systems , to produce recombinant allergens of an unprecedented quality , offering the following solutions to allergy sufferers : ( 1 ) a precise identification of each allergen involved rather than the current approximate diagnosis , ( 2 ) pure and certified recombinant allergens rather than imperfect and incomplete allergen extracts and ( 3 ) an effective treatment at the best cost to replace symptomatic - only or low - level curative allergy treatments .
method in this context , angany genetics has developed allergopur ( tm ) for production of high quality natural - like recombinant allergens needed for high efficiency of allergy treatment .
allergopur ( tm ) is a plant - based production platform using transient expression in n. benthamiana .
this strategy offers a rapid , flexible and high - yielding production of recombinant allergens .
typically , high rates of recombinant allergens can be recovered twelve days after gene delivery .
furthermore , in contrast to bacterial cells , plants can produce recombinant allergens that require complex post - translational modifications and , obviously , plants are also the best system for expression of plant allergens requiring plant - specific maturations .
results using allergopur ( tm ) , angany genetics has already produced high quality recombinant allergens from mites , pollens , mammals or mold .
this is illustrated here with eight recombinant allergens required for an accurate diagnosis and an efficient immunotherapy of dust mite allergy .
the detailed biological and structural characterizations of these recombinant allergens illustrate their quality and conformity to natural products .
conclusion allergopur ( tm ) is a powerful tool for the rapid production of high quality natural like recombinant allergens .
the capacity of this platform is illustrated with the successful expression of complex allergens impossible to produce in prokaryotic systems , such as der p 1 or hev b 13 .
some of these allergens are currently tested in preclinical studies .

several clinically used drugs are mitotoxic causing mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) variations , and thereby influence cancer treatment response .
we hypothesized that radiation responsiveness will be enhanced in cellular models with decreased mtdna content , attributed to altered reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production and antioxidant capacity .
for this purpose beas - 2b , a549 , and 143b cell lines were depleted from their mtdna ( rho0 ) .
overall survival after irradiation was increased ( p < 0.001 ) for beas - 2b rho0 cells , while decreased for both tumor rho0 lines ( p < 0.05 ) .
in agreement , increased residual dna damage was observed after mtdna depletion for a549 and 143b cells .
intrinsic radiosensitivity ( surviving fraction at 2gy ) was not influenced .
we investigated whether ros levels , oxidative stress and / or antioxidant responses were responsible for altered radiation responses .
baseline ros formation was similar between beas - 2b parental and rho0 cells , while reduced in a549 and 143b rho0 cells , compared to their parental counterparts .
after irradiation , ros levels significantly increased for all parental cell lines , while levels for rho0 cells remained unchanged .
in order to investigate the presence of oxidative stress upon irradiation reduced glutathione : oxidized glutathione ( gsh : gssg ) ratios were determined .
irradiation reduced gsh : gssg ratios for beas - 2b parental and 143b rho0 , while for a549 this ratio remained equal .
additionally , changes in antioxidant responses were observed .
our results indicate that mtdna depletion results in varying radiation responses potentially involving variations in cellular ros and antioxidant defence mechanisms .
we therefore suggest when mitotoxic drugs are combined with radiation , in particular at high dose per fraction , the effect of these drugs on mtdna copy number should be explored .

introduction under normal physiological conditions , mitochondria are important organelles in the cell .
one of their key functions is the production of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) via the oxidative phosphorylation system ( oxphos ) , thereby providing the cell with its essential energy supply .
it has been observed that tumor cells rely less on oxphos but are more dependent on aerobic glycolysis , also known as the warburg effect [ 1 ] .
new findings have revealed that this metabolic shift could be the result of metabolic reprogramming from a more oxphos to a more glycolytic phenotype ( uncoupled glycolysis ) regardless of oxygen presence in the tumor tissue , supporting the tumor 's anabolic growth and micro - environmental adaptations .
this may be a possible explanation for an increased metastatic potential of tumor cells [ 2,3 ] .
potential causes for such metabolic reprogramming could be changes in the mitochondrial genome ( mtdna ) such as deletions , substitutions and even mtdna copy number variations , leading to dysfunctional mitochondria [ 4 ] .
mitochondria play an important role in processes like reactive oxygen production , redox signalling and apoptosis , while these processes influence significantly radiotherapy ( rt ) response [ 5,6,7,8 ] .
furthermore , repair of rt - induced damage is dependent on mitochondrial energy supply which heavily relies upon the functionality of mitochondria [ 9 ] .
mtdna alterations , such as mutations , deletions or copy number variations , may therefore influence rt response .
these variations can be potentially caused by mitotoxic agents , such as cisplatin [ 10 ] or doxorubicin [ 11 ] .
cisplatin is able to induce a decrease in mtdna copy number and impairment of mtrna synthesis [ 10 ] .
doxorubicin intercalates with mtdna and thereby contributes to mitochondrial toxicity [ 11 ] .
different types of alterations of the mtdna genome have been found to be related to cancer and treatment outcome [ 4 ] .
cells fully depleted from their mitochondrial genome , rho - 0 ( rho0 ) cells , are an extreme in vitro model to investigate the association between radiation outcome and dysfunctional mitochondria due to abnormalities in the mitochondrial genome [ 12,13 ] .
several contradictory results on cellular mtdna depletion using various ( tumor ) cell lines have been published .
different radiation responses were observed varying between a radioresistant phenotype to no difference in radiation response in vitro [ 14,15 ] .
however , an increased radiation response was observed in an in vivo model [ 16 ] .
to our knowledge no mechanistic insights have been proposed to explain the observed differences in radiation response of mtdna depleted cell lines .
therefore , the aim of this study was to elicudate the mechanistic insights underlying the radiation response of mtdna depleted cells .
we hypothesized that reduced mitochondrial function after mtdna depletion changes the radiation response and this is dependent on altered atp production , ros production and on the cells' antioxidant capacity .
material and methods cell culture model the parental 143b and mtdna depleted 143b rho - 0 ( rho0 ) osteosarcoma cells were cultured in gibco 's dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem , d - glucose 4.5 g / l ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; lonza ) , the latter supplemented with 150 mug / ml uridine and 100 mug / ml bromodeoxyuridine ( sigma - aldrich ) [ 17 ] .
a549 ( alveolar type - ii carcinoma cells ) rho0 cells were created by prof. dr. ian holt ( cambridge university , united kingdom ) and parental and rho0 cells were kindly provided by dr. lodovica vergani ( padova university , italy ) .
mtdna depletion of beas - 2b ( adenovirus - 12 sv40 hybrid virus transformed bronchial epithelial ) cells was accomplished by culturing cells in medium supplemented with ethidium bromide ( 50 ng / ml ; sigma - aldrich ) .
both a549 and beas - 2b cells were cultured in dmem ( d - glucose 4.5 g / l ) supplemented with 25 % fbs , vitamins , 1x essential and non - essential amino acids ( sigma - aldrich ) and 50 mug / ml uridine ( acros organics ) .
mtdna copy number determination confirmation of mtdna depletion was obtained by performing quantitive pcr .
dna was isolated using the gentra puregene kit ( qiagen ) .
ratios for the nuclear dna ( ndna ) the b2m gene and mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) d - loop were obtained in order to determine the mtdna content .
primer secquences can be found in s1 table .
quantitative pcr was performed on the 7900ht fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
the pcr mixture contained 5ng / mul dna , 0.3 mum forward and reverse primer and 1x master - mix ( sensimix sybr ( r ) hirox kit , bioline reagents ) .
the cycling conditions were : 2 ' 50degreesc , 10 ' 95degreesc , 40 cycles of 15 '' at 95degreesc + 1 ' 60degreesc .
proliferation and clonogenic survival assay proliferation was monitored during 7 days using the incucyte flr after seeding 2500 cells / well .
for clonogenic survival analysis , cells were seeded on day 0 and irradiated using a 225kv philips x - ray tube on day 1 .
subsequently , cells were trypsinized and plated in triplicate for clonogenic survival .
cells were allowed to form colonies during 10 days , fixed and stained with a 0.4 % methylene blue ( sigma - aldrich ) in 70 % ethanol solution .
colonies were defined as > 50 cells [ 18 ] .
metabolic profiling cells were seeded at an optimized cell density of 3x104 cells / well ( beas - 2b ) or 1.5x104 cells / well ( 143b and a549 ) .
metabolic profiles were generated by replacing the growth media for assay media 1 hour before using the seahorse xf96 extracellular flux analyzer ( seahorse bioscience ) according to manufacturer 's guidelines [ 19,20 ] .
a mitochondrial stress test was established measuring the oxygen consumption rate ( ocr ) after subsequent injections of 1 mum oligomycin , optimized fccp concentrations 0.3 mum ( a549 ) , 0.5 mum ( 143b ) or 0.6 mum ( beas - 2b ) and 1 mum mixture of rotenone and antimycin a ( sigma - aldrich ) and spare capacity , proton leak and atp production were calculated according to the seahorse bioscience guidelines .
the glycolysis stress test was performed by measuring the extracellular acidification rate ( ecar ) after sequential addition of 10 mm glucose , optimized oligomycin concentration 1.0 mum ( all cell lines ) and 0.1 m 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - dg ) ( sigma - aldrich ) .
calculations of the glucose metabolism and glycolytic reserve were done according to the seahorse bioscience guidelines .
baseline ocr or ecar was determined prior to the first compound injection using a mixing period of 5 minutes and a measurement period of 3 minutes followed by 3 loops of mixing and measuring for 3 minutes each .
every injection was followed by the same measurement protocol of a mixing period of 5 minutes and a measurement period of 3 minutes followed by 3 loops of mixing and measuring for 3 minutes .
molecular assays atp levels were measured based on the cell - titerglo luminescent cell viability test ( promega ) on the glomax 96 well luminometer ( promega ) .
levels of extracellular l - lactic acid were measured by using the l - lactic acid kit ( biosentec ) according to manufacturer 's guidelines .
both atp and l - lactic acid levels were corrected for cell counts .
formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) was detected 24 hours after ionizing radiation ( 4gy ) .
cells were exposed for 1 hour to 20 mum dihydrorhodamine 123 ( invitrogen ) and subsequently washed with pbs before trypsinization and cell straining in order to obtain a single cell suspension .
the cell suspensions were exposed to 2 mug / ml final concentration of propidium iodide ( sigma - aldrich ) 1 minute before facs analysis .
levels of ros were determined in the propidium iodide negative population by flow cytometry ( bd facs canto ii ) and expressed using mean fluorescent intensity [ 21 ] .
glutathione levels ( gsh and gssg ) were measured in the cell lysates as described previously [ 22 ] .
gamma - h2ax immunocytochemistry cells were fixed with 100 % methanol at - 20degreesc .
subsequently cells were permeabilized with 0.05 % tween - pbs and normal goat serum was used as blocking agent .
cells were stained with a primairy anti - phospho ( ser139 ) - h2ax antibody ( 1:500 , millipore ) followed by anti - rabbit alexa fluor 488 ( 1:500 , invitrogen ) as secundairy antibody .
hoechst 33342 ( 20 ug / ml , sigma - aldrich ) was used as nuclear counter stain .
images were acquired using a leica tcs spe confocal microscope .
rna isolation and quantitative pcr analysis mrna was extracted using the nucleospin rna ii kit ( bioke ) using iscript cdna synthesis kit ( biorad ) .
both methods were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions .
quantitative pcr was performed on the cfx96 ( biorad ) .
the abundance of the genes of interest were detected with sybr ( r ) green i ( eurogentec ) .
values for each gene were normalized to 18s expression levels .
primer sequences are listed in the s1 table .
statistics all statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism version 5.03 for windows ( graphpad software , 2009 , california , usa ) .
a non - parametric mann - whitney u test for small groups was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between two independent groups of variables .
clonogenic survival curves were compared using an extra sum f - test .
for all tests , a p < 0.05 was considered significant .
results to investigate if extreme changes in oxphos capacity affect radiosensitivity , we used rho0 cell lines with different genetic backgrounds .
all our rho0 cell lines showed a strong and significant decrease in mtdna copy number ( fig 1a ; beas - 2b p < 0.001 ; a549 p < 0.05 ; 143b p < 0.05 ) .
additionally , proliferation was decreased as evaluated by an increased doubling time ( on average 54 %) for all rho0 cell lines ( fig 1a ) .
we confirmed the drastic effect on oxphos upon mtdna depletion as basal respiration was almost absent ( p < 0.05 ) in the beas - 2b , a549 and 143b rho0 ( fig 1b ) while the parental cells had a functional oxphos system with spare capacity ( fig 1c ) .
to compensate their loss of oxphos function , rho0 cells showed an enhanced ( p < 0.05 ) glucose metabolism accompanied with a loss in glycolytic reserve ( fig 1c ; s1 fig ) .
the mtdna depletion did not result in reduced cellular atp levels and no differences in lactic acid production were observed between rho0 and their parental counterparts ( fig 1d ) .
together our results indicate that mtdna depleted cells upscaled their glucose metabolism .

in order to assess the influence of mtdna depletion on radiation response , clonogenic survival assays were performed .
overall survival was increased ( p < 0.001 ) for the beas - 2b rho0 cells , while decreased for a549 rho0 ( p < 0.01 ) and 143b rho0 ( p < 0.0001 ) cells ( fig 2a ) .
however , the intrinsic radiosensitivity assessed by the surviving fraction at 2gy was not influenced ( p > 0.05 ) .
no diffierences in initial dna damage were observed shortly after irradiation between mtdna depleted and parental cells .
however , changes in residual dna damage 24 hours after 4gy irradiation were found between both cell lines in line with the clonogenic survival data .
an increased number of residual gammah2ax foci was observed for the 143b rho0 and to a lesser extent for the a549 rho0 cells .
the opposite was observed for the beas - 2b , where the rho0 cells showed a lower residual signal compared to the parental cell line ( fig 2b and s2 fig ) .

radiation therapy relies on the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) for its lethal properties .
additionally , cellular mitochondrial function plays an important role in ros production and redox signaling .
here we assessed ros formation ( fig 3a ) at baseline ( 0gy ) , which was found to be similar ( p = 0.878 ) for beas - 2b parental and rho0 cell lines , while reduced for a549 ( ns ) and 143b ( p = 0.0211 ) rho0 cells .
ros levels were significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) for all parental cell lines 24 hours after irradiation , while levels for the rho0 cell lines remained equal .
ros formation 24 hours after irradiation was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) for the the a459 and 143b rho0 cell lines compared to their parentals .
since " oxidative stress " indicates a disbalance between ros and antioxidants in favor for ros , we investigated the antioxidant capacity of the rho0 cell lines using the ratio of gsh : gssg as a proxy to assess if ros scavenging mechanisms were altered .
gsh : gssg ratios were decreased for the beas - 2b parental and 143b rho0 cells upon irradiation .
no alterations were observed for both a549 cell lines ( fig 3b ) .
the kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1 ) - - nuclear factor erythroid 2 ( nf - e2 ) - related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) pathway is an important oxidative stress response regulator and down - stream targets of nrf2 are found to be involved in nadph production , glutathione metabolism and utilization [ 23 ] .
keap1 mrna levels were elevated for both tumor rho0 cell lines at baseline and after irradiation compared to their parentals ( fig 3c ) .
mrna expression levels of nrf2 were not significantly altered .
certain downstream targets of the keap1 - nrf2 pathway such as the malic enzyme 1 ( me1 ) , involved in nadph production , displayed elevated mrna levels in the tumor rho0 cell lines ( s3 fig ) while other targets such as glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) , phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( pgd ) , nad ( p ) h quinone dehydrogenase 1 ( nqo1 , involved in quinone detoxification ) and glutathione peroxidase 1 ( gpx1 ) did not show altered mrna expression levels for the rho0 cells ( s3 fig ) .
baseline levels of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 ( sod2 , mnsod ) were elevated in the rho0 cells ( fig 3c ) , being significant for a549 ( p = 0.0493 ) .
irradiation increased sod2 expression for both parental a549 ( p < 0.05 ) and rho0 ( ns ; p = 0.0519 ) cells .
on the other hand , sod2 expression levels were decreased upon irradiation for 143b parental cells ( p = 0.0093 ) .
irradiation did not alter sod2 expression levels for the 143b rho0 cells ( p = 0.5476 ) neither for both beas - 2b cell lines .
expression levels of superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 , cuznsod ) were not significantly altered upon irradiation for the beas - 2b , a549 and 143b cells ( s3 fig ) .

discussion recently , mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) variations have been linked to a wide variety of cancers and cancer outcome through influencing mitochondrial pathways [ 4 ] and may explain the hampered cellular bioenergetics found in many cancer types .
mitochondrial dysfunction has been found to be related to a chemoresistant phenotype in vitro [ 24,25,26,27 ] and chemotherapeutic agents might be associated with a decreased mitochondrial function [ 10,11,28 ] .
furthermore , several studies investigated the effect of mtdna depletion with respect to radiotherapy by using different ( tumor ) cell lines with contradictory results , from a radioresistant phenotype or no difference in radiation response in vitro [ 14,15,29 ] to an increased radiation response in vivo [ 16 ] .
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) are formed in the presence of oxygen and are further induced upon radiation resulting in dna damage .
functional mitochondria are found to be essential for radiation - induced ros production [ 30 ] .
radiation causes either cell death ( mainly by mitotic catastrophy ) or induces a sublethal dna damage initiating a temporary cell cycle arrest in order to repair the damage [ 4 ] .
the interplay between mitochondrial function and radiation response is of great importance in such a radiation - induced dna damage repair [ 31 ] .
as both ros production and atp are vital parameters for radiotherapy outcome and mitochondrial function is essential for radiation - induced dna repair , mtdna variations could alter the response to irradiation possibly via increased lactate production as a consequence of a reduced oxidative phosphorylation system ( oxphos ) function [ 26,32 ] .
additionally , it has been shown that increased lactate results in a radioresistant phenotype [ 33 ] .
however , in our study , no differences could be observed in cellular atp levels for mtdna depleted cells , in agreement with the observed compensation by glycolysis induction often found in cell lines with a dysfunctional oxphos system [ 34,35 ] .
although mtdna depletion resulted in a glycolytic phenotype , no elevated lactic acid production was observed .
a possible explanation for this finding could be that most lactic acid is catabolized in order to control the intracellular ph of the cell [ 36,37 ] .
we hypothesized that mtdna depletion results in a more radiosensitive phenotype related to altered ros and atp levels and changes in the antioxidant ros scavaging capacity .
our data showed , in line with literature , that a varying irradiation response occured in different cell lines after mtdna depletion .
overall , in our study the immortalized epithelial beas - 2b rho0 cell line was less radiosensitive compared to the parental line , while the tumor derived rho0 cell lines ( a549 and 143b ) were more prone to a decreased survival upon radiation .
however , the intrinsic radiosensitivity , correlated to clinical outcome after conventional fractionated radiotherapy and quantified by the survival fraction at 2gy , was not significantly modified [ 38 ] .
residual gammah2ax foci after irradiation were in agreement with the survival data , as described previously [ 39 ] .
irradiation is able to elevate ros levels [ 7 ] .
in the parental cell lines used in this study , the irradiation - induced increase in ros levels was evident , while no increase was observed in rho0 cells .
potentially , this is due to the fact that both nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( ci ) and ubiquinol - cytochrome c oxidoreductase ( ciii ) , the major ros generating sites of the oxidative phosphorylation chain , might be deficient in the established rho0 cells .
this may explain why we found relatively lower ros levels in the rho0 tumor cell lines [ 40,41,42 ] .
in contrast to the elevated ros levels found in cells with mtdna variations [ 26,43,44 ] , park et al. demonstrated that rho0 cells can also have normal ros levels due to the protective up - regulation of their antioxidant system during the rho0 development [ 26 ] .
glutathione and sod2 are important antioxidants that can be located in the mitochondrion [ 45 ] .
here we observed that the ratio between gsh and gssg was decreased upon irradiation for the parental beas - 2b and the 143b rho0 cells , whearas no differences were found for the a549 cells .
these data suggest that differences in radiation response between parental and mtdna depleted cells could be determined by the antioxidant capacity of the cells .
superoxide dismutase 2 ( sod2 ) is an antioxidant able to scavenge superoxide radicals in the mitochondrial matrix [ 46 ] and therefore can protect cells against radiation [ 47 ] .
cells with an overexpression of sod2 are found to have a higher cell survival [ 47 ] .
we indeed observed an increase in sod2 levels upon irradiation for the a549 parental cells .
on the other hand , mitochondrial sod2 levels where unaffected in the 143b cells .
previously , it has been reported that rho0 cells originating from different tissues can have altered glutathione antioxidant mechanisms [ 48,49 ] .
the kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 - nuclear factor erythroid 2 ( nf - e2 ) - related factor 2 ( keap1 - nrf2 ) pathway is an important oxidative stress response regulator and downstream targets of nrf2 are found to be involved in glutathione metabolism and utilization [ 23,50 ] .
keap1 mrna levels were found to be elevated for both tumor mtdna depleted lines , suggesting a role for this pathway in the antioxidant response .
some , but not all , downstream targets of the keap1 - nrf2 pathway were found to be elevated indicating that keap1 - nrf2 could play a role in the antioxidant capacity of rho0 , however this remains to be further elucidated .
furthermore , it has also been suggested that variations in culture medium can influence oxidative stress and oxidative stress responses , possibly explaining the observered differences in antioxidant mechanisms [ 49,51 ] .
a well - known example is cysteine , the precursor for glutathione [ 51 ] .
therefore the use of glutathione and its effectors in culture medium should be carefully considered when elucidating the interactions of mitochondrial function and antioxidants .
taken together , mtdna depletion resulted in decreased proliferation for all rho0 cell lines , increased clonogenic survival for the epithelial beas - 2b cells , but reduced clonogenic survival at higher irradiation doses for the tumor cell lines .
our findings indicate that inhibition of oxphos might be useful to enhance radiotherapy effects , in particular for patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy in rapidly proliferating tumors .
this is in line with the well - known oxphos inhibitor metformin , an u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) approved drug for diabetes leading to an improvement of tumor oxygenation and better outcome following radiotherapy [ 52,53 ] .
concluding , mtdna depletion resulted in varying irradiation responses in different cell lines , potentially attributed to ros and antioxidant capacity .
additionally , the influence of mtdna variations in normal tissue and tumor tissues should be further elucidated in order to implement these novel findings in cancer treatment , both chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy .

here we investigated the impact of dietary interventions that affect systemic glucose and lipid metabolism on plasma adropin concentrations in humans .
consumption of glucose or fructose as 25 % of daily energy requirements ( e ) differentially affected plasma adropin concentrations ( p < 0.005 ) irrespective of duration , sex or age .
glucose consumption reduced plasma adropin from 3.55 +/ - 0.26 to 3.28 +/ - 0.23 ng / ml ( n = 42 ) .
fructose consumption increased plasma adropin from 3.63 +/ - 0.29 to 3.93 +/ - 0.34 ng / ml ( n = 45 ) .
consumption of high fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) as 25 % e had no effect ( 3.43 +/ - 0.32 versus 3.39 +/ - 0.24 ng / ml , n = 26 ) .
overall , the effect of glucose , hfcs and fructose on circulating adropin concentrations were similar to those observed on postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations .
furthermore , increases in plasma adropin levels with fructose intake were most robust in individuals exhibiting hypertriglyceridemia .
individuals with low plasma adropin concentrations also exhibited rapid increases in plasma levels following consumption of breakfasts supplemented with lipids .
these are the first results linking plasma adropin levels with dietary sugar intake in humans , with the impact of fructose consumption linked to systemic triglyceride metabolism .
in addition , dietary fat intake may also increase circulating adropin concentrations .
rapid effects of fasting and feeding on adropin expression in mice suggest functions related to metabolic adaptation .
consistent with this hypothesis , adropin - knockout mice are insulin resistant1 .
adropin therapy enhances glucose clearance , improves hyperinsulinemia and enhances muscle insulin action in diet - induced obese ( dio ) mice23 .
adropin may defend against body obesity , with adropin therapy and overexpression producing lean phenotypes2 .
adropin also functions as a nutrient - sensing peptide hormone signaling nutrient / caloric sufficiency to promote glucose utilization and limiting fat oxidation in skeletal musce4 .
it is important to note other biologic functions that may also potentially affect health including endothelial function5 and development of the nervous system26 .
the roles of adropin in human physiology are not as clear .
in women , we recently reported a positive association between plasma adropin concentrations and dietary fat consumption7 and increased plasma adropin concentrations at 3 and 6 months following roux - en - y gastric bypass8 .
fish oil supplements added to a high sugar diet increased plasma adropin concentrations in nonhuman primates9 .
these intriguing results suggest a link between diet and circulating adropin levels .
however , whether diet affects plasma adropin concentrations in humans is unclear .
to address this gap in knowledge , plasma adropin concentrations were measured in samples obtained at baseline and after consumption of glucose , fructose or high fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) as 25 % of energy ( e ) for 2 wk ( study a ) 10 , or glucose or fructose as 25 % e for 10 wk ( study b ) 1112 .
these studies were designed to determine whether fructose consumption affects cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors .
as dietary fat alters adropin expression in mice121314 , we investigated whether dietary fat intake would increase plasma adropin concentrations in humans using samples collected after consumption of a breakfast meal containing medium - or long - chain triglycerides ( tg ) ( study c ) 15 .
results biometrics for the participants of studies a and b whose plasma were used in the current experiments are shown in table 1 .
study a subjects consuming glucose , fructose or hfcs gained 0.4 kg ( p < 0.05 , paired t test ) , 0.1 kg , and 0.8 kg ( p < 0.05 , paired t test ) body weight , respectively ( table 1 ) 10 .
in study b , fructose and glucose consumption had comparable effects on body weight ( table 1 ) , but had different effects on regional body fat distribution11 .
glucose consumption increased subcutaneous adipose tissue volume , while fructose consumption resulted in a preferential expansion of visceral adipose tissue as assessed by computerized tomography .
plasma adropin concentrations at baseline and after dietary intervention are shown for study a and study b ( table 2 ) .
baseline adropin concentrations were similar between groups in both studies .
for study a , there was a trend for significant interaction between sugar and time ( f2,75 = 2.830 , p = 0.069 ) , although the effect of time was not significant ( f2,75 = 0.898 , p > 0.05 ) .
analysis of the change of plasma adropin concentrations ( deltaadropin ) indicated that glucose and fructose consumption were having opposite effects ( fig. 1a,b ) , with a trend ( f2,75 = 1.683 , p = 0.061 ) for a difference between the three groups .
post hoc analysis indicated a tendency ( p = 0.057 ) for a difference , with fructose consumption increasing and glucose consumption reducing plasma adropin concentrations ( fig. 1b ) .
plasma adropin concentrations were not significantly affected by hfcs ( fig. 1a,b ) .
while glucose appeared to have a more pronounced effect on plasma adropin concentration in males ( fig. 1a ) , there was no significant effect of sex .
a similar differential response to glucose and fructose was observed in study b. again , there was a strong trend for an interaction between diet and sugar ( f1,26 = 3.320 , p = 0.08 ) with no effect of time ( f1,26 = 1.741 , p > 0.05 ) .
as before , there was a trend for a difference in deltaadropin between the glucose ( reduced ) and fructose ( increased ) groups ( f1 , 26 = 3.055 , p = 0.092 ) that was not affected of by sex ( fig. 1c,d ) .
as the effects of glucose and fructose consumption on plasma adropin concentrations were similar in the two studies , we performed an additional analysis using combined glucose and fructose data with study , age , bmi and ethnicity as covariates .
the interaction between sugar and time was now highly significant ( f1,76 = 10.914 , p = 0.001 ) , with no significant effect of time ( f1,76 = 0.906 , p > 0.05 ) ( fig. 1e,f ) .
the other parameters had no impact on the effects of sugar ( effect of age , f1,76 = 0.020 , p > 0.05 ; bmi , f1,76 = 1.202 , p > 0.05 ; ethnicity , f1,76 = 0.054 , p > 0.05 ; sex , f1,76 = 0.047 , p > 0.05 ; and study , f1,76 = 0.072 , p > 0.05 ) .
a univariate analysis comparing deltaadropin between glucose and fructose with study , sex , age , bmi and ethnicity as covariates also indicated a highly significant difference ( f1,75 = 9.994 , p < 0.005 ) ( deltaadropin in ng / ml for glucose , - 0.26 +/ - 0.15 ng / ml , 95 % ci - 0.55 , + 0.04 , n = 42 ; fructose , + 0.32 +/ - 0.13 ng / ml , 95 % ci - 0.06 , + 0.58 , n = 45 ) ( fig. 1g ) .
a positive interaction between baseline tg levels and fructose consumption on plasma adropin concentrations inspection of deltaadropin for study a and b participants consuming glucose or fructose indicated a responder / non - responder scenario ( fig. 2 ). with glucose consumption , approximately 2 / 3 of the group ( 27 / 42 ) exhibited a decline in plasma adropin ( fig. 2a ). with fructose consumption , plasma adropin levels increased in ~ 60 % of the subjects ( 25 / 45 ) ( fig. 2b ) .
a large body of data related to lipid and glucose metabolism had been collected from all participants during the original experiments1011 .
we therefore examined whether responders and nonresponders are distinguished by differences in risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes .
this initially involved an unbiased screen for associations between the plasma adropin concentrations ( baseline , post - intervention and deltaadropin ) and previously collected plasma lipid and glucose metabolic parameters .
to differentiate between responders and non - responders , we separated data pooled from study a and b into quartiles ranked by deltaadropin .
to determine whether the differences in deltaadropin in each quartile correlated with plasma lipid and lipoprotein risk factors , we performed an initial screen of the risk factors comparing baseline values in the 1st and 4th quartiles using a student 's t - test .
factors that showed significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) in deltaadropin between the 1st and 4th quartile were then analyzed further using anova .
this strategy did not identify distinguishing characteristics in the glucose group .
however , the results of this analysis suggest differences in plasma tg between the 1st and 4th quartiles in participants consuming fructose .
further analysis of fasting tg ( tgfst ) ( fig. 3a ) , the total area under the curve ( tgtotauc ) ( fig. 3b ) , and the incremental area under the curve ( tgiauc ) ( fig. 3c ) indicated a higher circulating tg profile in the 4th quartile group compared with the other 3 quartiles .
this was significant for tgiauc , which was markedly (> 2 - fold ) higher in individuals in the 4th relative to all other quartiles ( p < 0.05 ) .
distribution by age and sex was similar in the 4 groups ( mean +/ - se of the age for the 1st to 4th quartiles , 38.2 +/ - 5.1 yr , 32.7 +/ - 3.5 yr , 38.4 +/ - 4.2 yr and 37.8 +/ - 4.7 y ; number of males and females in the1st to 4th quartiles , 7 male / 4 female , 7 / 4 , 3 / 8 and 6 / 5 ) .
there were also significant correlations between deltaadropin and baseline values for tgfst ( r = 0.391 , p < 0.01 ) , tgiauc ( r = 0.479 , p = < 0.005 ) and tgauc ( r = 0.473 , p < 0.005 ) ( fig. 3d - f ). of note , the most pronounced fold - increase ( 3.8 fold ) of adropin with fructose consumption was observed in a female in study b ( age 53 yr , bmi 34.4 kg / m2 ) who also had the lowest plasma adropin concentrations measured in these studies ( 0.6 ng / ml ) and high risk factors for cardiovascular disease .
the individual had the highest tg levels at baseline ( tgfst 342 mg / dl , + 2.9 sd from the mean for all participants in study b ; tgiauc 2411 mg / dl / 23h , + 2.8 sd ; tgtotauc 10619 md / dl / 23 h , + 2.9 sd ) .
this participant also had very high levels of fasting tg - and cholesterol - rich remnant lipoproteins ( rlptgfst 153.0 mg / dl , + 4.4 sd from the mean of 27.7 mg / dl in study b ; rlpcfst 26.6 mg / dl , + 4.3 sd from the mean of 7.4 mg / dl in study b ) .
an acute effect of fat consumption on plasma adropin concentrations in the next experiment we examined whether dietary lipid intake would rapidly affect plasma adropin concentrations .
physical characteristics of the study c participants have been reported previously15 .
participants were provided a breakfast supplemented with 20 g of test oils comprised of either medium - chain or long - chain tg ( mct , lct ) , in a 2 - arm , randomized , single - blind , cross - over design as previously described15 .
the initial analysis of plasma adropin concentrations following consumption of mct or lct suggested no effect ( fig. 4a ) .
however , further analysis of the increase in plasma adropin concentrations following the meal suggested a potential responder / nonresponder situation following mct and lct consumption , with an inverse association between the auc and baseline plasma adropin concentrations ( fig. 4b ) .
the postprandial area under the curve ( auc ) for adropin also tended to be higher following mct compared with lct ( auc in ng / ml / 2 h for mct , 0.6 +/ - 0.5 , for lct , - 0.5 +/ - 0.3 ; f1,9 = 4.081 , p = 0.074 ) .
the potential responder / nonresponder situation was further analyzed by grouping the highest and lowest " responders " ( auc in ng / ml per 2 h for high responders to mct , 2.9 +/ - 0.7 , low responders , - 1.0 +/ - 0.4 , p < 0.01 ; for higher responders to lct , 0.6 +/ - 0.2 ; low responders , - 1.4 +/ - 0.2 , p < 0.01 ) .
interestingly , participants exhibiting the largest increase in response to mct (" responders ) also appeared to have lower plasma adropin concentrations at baseline ( fig. 4c ) .
for lct , when divided into low and high responders a similar difference in the auc was evident ( adropin concentrations at t - 15 for high responders , 1.9 +/ - 0.2 ng / ml ; for low responders , 2.8 +/ - 0.1 ng / ml , p < 0.05 ) .
however , the distinction between responders and nonresponders was less clear for lct , with nonresponders showing a dip following breakfast ( fig. 4d ) .
the differences in the response to mct and lct , and the ambiguity of the responder / nonresponder situation following lct consumption , may be due to plasma samples from the two strongest responders to mct not being available for the lct arm of the study .
discussion to our knowledge there has been only one report suggesting that plasma levels of adropin in humans are responsive to changes of energy balance , increasing after roux - en y gastric bypass8 .
our data are therefore significant for being the first to suggest that diet coupled with systemic tg metabolism has an important influence in regulating plasma adropin concentrations in humans .
we found that glucose consumption lowers while fructose increases plasma adropin concentrations .
the differential effect of fructose and glucose was corroborated by an intermediate essentially zero effect , in study a subjects consuming hfcs which is composed of 55 % fructose and 45 % glucose .
while the averaged response appears small ( 5 - 10 %) , there was considerable variability between individuals suggesting interactions between sugar and other variables .
in the fructose group , the participants exhibiting the largest increases of plasma adropin had higher baseline circulating tg profiles .
this outcome suggests an association between elevated tg levels and the regulation of plasma adropin concentrations in humans .
the consistency in the outcomes observed in the two different 2 wk and 10 wk treatment paradigms is a strength of this study .
however , data interpretation is complicated by the lack of specific information regarding the molecular mechanisms by which circulating adropin levels are regulated .
the observed changes are presumably indirect downstream consequences of changes in lipid and glucose metabolism associated with sugar consumption .
glucose passes through the liver and is readily oxidized as needed or converted to glycogen .
in contrast , fructose is retained by the liver and is more readily converted to fatty acids and exported as very - low density lipoproteins .
consumption of diets with high fructose content has been suggested to promote risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic risk disease .
indeed , in the studies from which these plasma samples were obtained , fructose consumption was associated with the development of dyslipidemia1011 and insulin resistance11 .
it is of interest to note the parallels between the effects of adropin and fructose consumption on fuel selection .
in mice , adropin limits fat oxidation while enhancing glucose oxidation in lean and diet - induced obese mice34 .
in the 10wk study , fructose consumption lowered insulin sensitivity , increased de novo lipogenesis , reduced postprandial fat oxidation , and enhanced glucose oxidation , and , even though weight gain was similar for both groups , only fructose consumption increased intra - abdominal obesity1112 .
if adropin has similar functions in humans , then the increase in plasma adropin concentrations with fructose consumption is consistent with the outcomes observed in fuel selection ( i.e. , reduced net postprandial fat oxidation , enhanced net postprandial carbohydrate oxidation ) 1112 .
the positive association between high tg at baseline and the impact of fructose consumption on plasma adropin concentrations is also suggestive ( fig. 4 ) .
if adropin limits fat oxidation in humans as it does in mice , then inhibition of fat oxidation might be one of several factors contributing to elevated tg levels following fructose consumption .
previous findings on the metabolic response of humans to mct are , however , not consistent with this hypothesis .
while mct appear to have a stimulatory effect on plasma adropin concentrations , they are preferentially oxidized and cause a net increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation1617 .
moreover , although plasma tg increased after consumption of mct and lct , the response was lower following mct15 .
the association between fructose consumption , system tg metabolism and plasma adropin concentrations may therefore involve other indirect time - dependent mechanisms. whether fructose consumption would similarly affect plasma adropin concentrations in rodents as observed in humans has not been determined .
it is worth noting that the provision of fructose to mice has also been observed to increase adiposity by enhancing lipogenesis and reducing energy expenditure1819 .
an increase of plasma adropin would serve to facilitate the expansion of the fat reserves by reducing fatty acid oxidation while promoting the oxidation of carbohydrates .
future studies investigating whether fructose consumption affects adropin expression in mice , and whether adropin regulates fuel selection in humans , are required .
one caveat to this model is that over expression of adropin or administration of adropin peptide to mice does not result in obesity2 .
indeed , transgenic mice over expressing adropin under the control of the human beta - actin promoter exhibit delayed dio , while treatment of dio male b6 mice with synthetic adropin is associated with mild weight loss .
in both cases , a shift away from fat oxidation towards glucose oxidation has been observed34 .
one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the mouse models represent a non - physiological condition .
in the studies with administration of synthetic adropin peptide , the doses used are pharmacological , likely resulting in spikes in plasma adropin concentrations well above what is normally observed in the fed condition .
for the transgenic mice , the use of the beta - actin promoter results in high levels of expression in tissues where the endogenous enho gene is either not active or expressed at low levels .
a mild increase in plasma adropin observed in physiological conditions may therefore be sufficient to alter fuel selection without producing changes in metabolism that prevent weight gain .
finally , another perhaps simpler interpretation of this data is that there is a link between hypertriglyceridemia and plasma adropin levels .
this might involve a homeostatic interaction between adropin and tg metabolism .
in mice , adropin appears to be stimulated by dietary fat content .
adropin also has an inhibitory effect on the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis , although whether this effect is direct or secondary to other metabolic changes has not been determined2 .
the association between baseline tg levels and the increase in plasma adropin concentrations might therefore indicate an attempt to maintain homeostasis .
the second part of this study examined plasma adropin concentrations following consumption of a high fat meal .
the samples used for this experiment came from a study comparing the response of adult men to a breakfast meal supplemented with 20 g of mct or lct15 .
the original goal of the study was to compare the satiating effects of mct with lct , including an analysis of gut hormone responses .
the results of our analysis suggest a complex situation with regard to the response of plasma adropin to dietary fats in humans .
the impact of dietary fat on plasma adropin concentrations appears to be dependent on baseline levels , with an inverse relationship .
strong linear associations between the postprandial auc and baseline fasting plasma adropin concentrations were evident .
while this was evident for both lct and mct , the latter appear to have elicited a more potent effect in those individuals who are " responders " .
indeed , one interpretation of our data is that individuals with plasma adropin concentrations at the low end of the spectrum will experience a rapid increase following ingestion of meals rich in fats .
the main outcomes of this report should be considered preliminary as none of the studies from which samples were obtained were specifically designed to investigate the regulation of circulating adropin .
however , these results are important in suggesting that further studies investigating the impact of macronutrient consumption on plasma adropin concentrations are needed .
these results suggest an association between dietary and systemic lipid / triglyceride metabolism in the regulation of plasma adropin concentrations .
lipids originating either from the diet or from endogenous production appear to positively affect plasma adropin concentrations in humans .
further studies designed to specifically investigate the mechanisms linking lipid metabolism to plasma adropin concentrations are warranted .
methods the protocols used for original studies were reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at uc davis1011 and st. luke 's / roosevelt hospital15 .
the studies were subsequently performed in accordance following the guidelines provided by the irb 's at uc davis and st. luke 's / roosevelt hospital .
all of the participants provided written informed consent for the use of plasma collected in the experiments .
plasma adropin concentrations at baseline from study a and study b were reported previously8 .
study a ( uc davis ccrc , 2 wk dietary intervention examining the effect of glucose , fructose or hfcs on plasma adropin concentrations .
clinical trials.gov identifier nct01103921 ) plasma for this experiment was from 82 participants ( 43 males , 39 females ) of mixed ethnicity ( 44 caucasian , 9 hispanic , 13 asian , 11 african american , 3 pacific islander and 2 of mixed heritage ) .
biometric data are shown in table 1 .
recruiting , exclusion criteria and study design are published10 .
the study consisted of three phases .
in phase one , study participants resided at the ccrc for a 3.5 - d inpatient baseline period .
during the second and third day , study participants were provided energy - balanced meals consisting of conventional foods .
the diet during this period contained 55 % e as complex carbohydrate , 30 % fat and 15 % protein served as 3 meals , with 25 % of the energy provided as breakfast at 0900 h , 35 % as lunch ( 1300 h ) and 40 % as dinner ( 1800 h ) .
in phase two , a 12 - d outpatient period , participants were provided with sugar - sweetened beverages providing 25 % e split between three meals ( breakfast , lunch and dinner ) .
participants were asked to consume one beverage per meal , to consume their normal diet , and to not to consume other sweetened beverages ( including fruit juice ) .
phase three involved another 3.5 - d inpatient period at the ccrc with participant provided energy balanced meals derived from conventional foods and sugar - sweetened beverages .
pooled samples collected at 0800 , 0830 and 0900 h after an overnight fast on the third day of the baseline period and third phases were used to measure plasma adropin at baseline and after 2 wk of dietary intervention .
study b ( uc davis ccrc , 10 wk dietary intervention examining the effect of glucose or fructose on plasma adropin concentrations .
clinical trials.gov identifier nct01165853 ) plasma used for this study was obtained from 32 participants ( 16 males , 16 females ; 24 caucasian , 5 hispanic , 3 african american ) consuming 25 % e from fructose or glucose for 10 wk11 .
biometrics are presented in table 1 .
this study also consisted of three phases .
an inpatient baseline period lasted for 2 wk where participants consumed an energy balanced diet .
the second phase involved an 8 wk outpatient period , with participants provided fructose - or glucose - sweetened beverages providing 25 % e. the final phase was a 2 wk inpatient period involving continued consumption of the fructose - or glucose - sweetened beverages .
the meals provided during the inpatient periods were comprised of 55 % e as carbohydrate , 30 % e as fat and 15 % e as protein .
pooled samples collected at 0800 , 0830 and 0900 h after an overnight fast on the final day of the baseline period and third phases were used to measure plasma adropin .
study c ( nyonrc , effect of medium or long chain triglyceride consumption on plasma adropin concentrations .
clinical trials.gov identifier nct01952977 ) physical characteristics have been reported15 .
the study was comprised of 5 caucasian , 8 african american , 2 hispanic and 2 men of mixed heritage , aged 39.4 +/ - 1.8y who were overweight ( mean body weight , 88.9 +/ - 2.3 kg ; mean bmi , 28.2 +/ - 0.3 kg / m2 ) .
in brief , this study was performed in two parts ( c1 , c2 ) .
ten men participated in study c1 ; the protocol was then revised and another 7 men enrolled into study c2 .
each study involved a 2 - arm , randomized , single - blind , cross - over design .
each arm consisted of a test day spaced 3 to 14 d apart that differed in the type of oil incorporated into the meal : mct oil ( neobee 1053 , stepan company , northfield , il ) or corn oil ( lct , mazola , ach food companies , cordova , tn ) .
the nutrient composition of the breakfast meals was different ( c1 : muffin with test oil added and orange juice , total energy 2671 kj , 105 g carbohydrate , 9.6 g protein , 20 g of fat , 20 g of test oil ; c2 : boost shake with test oil , total energy 2510 kj , 71.6 g carbohydrate , 17.5 g protein , 27 g of fat , 20 g of test oil ) .
both diets provided the same amount of test oil .
for 2 d prior to the test , participants were requested not to consume alcohol or participate in structured exercise .
they were asked to record their food intake at dinner the night before the test day and consume the same meal the night before the follow - up test day .
the participants fasted for at least 12 h during the night before the test day .
plasma adropin measurements adropin concentrations were measured using edta - plasma not previously been thawed in duplicate by eia ( peninsula laboratories , bachem , san carlos , ca ) 8 .
the intra - assay coefficient of variation ( cv ) is < 10 % , while the inter - assay variability fluctuates between 20 to 30 % .
statistical analysis data analysis used spss statistics 22 .
univariate analysis with repeated measures ( within - subjects factors : time at pre - and post - intervention ) was used to determine the impact of dietary intervention , with sugar type as between - subjects factors in the analysis .
for comparisons between sugar groups involving single measurements ( for example , the change in plasma adropin concentrations calculated by subtracting baseline from the post - intervention value ) , anova were used followed by bonferroni corrected multiple comparisons .
for analyzing the response to mct and lct , which was a randomized cross - over design , a pair t - test was used for the analysis of the auc .

figure 1 effects of sugar consumption on plasma adropin concentrations .
( a ) the change ( delta ) in plasma adropin concentrations is shown for males ( m , n = 43 ) and females ( f,n = 39 ) who consumed glucose ( n = 28 ; 15m , 13f ) , fructose ( n = 28 ; 15m , 13f ) or hfcs ( n = 26 , 13m , 13f ) for 2 wk ( study a ) .
( b ) there was no significant effect of sex ; data grouped by sugar type only are also shown .
( c ) change ( delta ) in plasma adropin concentrations is shown for males ( m , n = 15 ) and females ( f , n = 16 ) who consumed glucose ( n = 14 ; 6 m , 8 f ) or fructose ( n = 16 ; 9m , 8f ) for 10 wk ( study b ) .
( d ) there was no significant effect of sex ; data from study b grouped are also shown grouped by sugar type .
( e - f ) data pooled from study a and b for the glucose and fructose groups .
( e ) males ( m , n = 45 ) and females ( f , n = 42 ) exhibited similar responses to glucose ( n = 42 ) or fructose ( 45 ) consumption ; * p < 0.01 .
( f ) plasma adropin levels at baseline were similar for the glucose and fructose groups , but then diverged with the consumption of glucose or fructose as 25 % of daily energy requirements .
( g ) the difference in the effect of glucose or fructose consumption on plasma adropin levels was highly significant .
* p < 0.01 .
figure 2 individuals vary in their response to glucose or fructose consumption .
( a ) change in plasma adropin concentrations ( delta ng / ml ) with glucose consumption in individuals .
( b ) change in plasma adropin concentrations with fructose consumption in individuals .
the data shown in panels ( a,b ) are combined from study ( a ) and study ( b ) .
figure 3 association between the increase in plasma adropin levels with fructose consumption and fasting tg ( a,d ) , total area under the curve for tg over 23 h ( b,e ) and integrative area under the curve for tg over 23 h ( c,f ) .
the tg shown in ( a - c ) are averages based on quartile for deltaadropin adjusted for age , sex , bmi and % body fat .
the quartiles are for deltaadropin ranked from 1st ( lowest ) to 4th ( highest ) .
* p < 0.05 vs. 1st and 3rd quartile .
scatterplots shown in ( d - f ) have baseline tg data ( fasting , total or integrative area under the curve ) in the y - axis , and deltaadropin in the x - axis .
figure 4 effects of mct or lct consumption on plasma adropin concentrations suggests a responder / nonresponder situation .
( a ) averages in the absolute values and delta ( delta , values at the various time points minus baseline ) following mct or lct consumption .
( b ) inverse association between the area under the curve ( auc ) for the change in plasma adropin concentrations and baseline values taken 15 minutes before consumption of meals containing mct or lct .
( c ) individuals who are " responders " exhibit a marked increase in plasma adropin concentrations after consumption of mct when compared to " low responders " .
" high responders " are characterized by having low plasma adropin concentrations at baseline , with mct consumption increasing plasma adropin levels to that observed in " low responders " .
* p < 0.05 .
( d ) the distinction between responders and nonresponders following lct consumption is less clear .
while the delta in plasma adropin was higher in responders , this was due to nonresponders showing a marked decline in adropin following consumption of the meal .

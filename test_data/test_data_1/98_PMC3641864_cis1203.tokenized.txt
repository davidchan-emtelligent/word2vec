virologic suppression was well maintained when hiv patients receiving 3tc / abc with a boosted protease inhibitor were switched to emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( ftc / tdf ) .
subjects randomized to ftc / tdf ) had fewer virologic failures ; in addition , improvements in lipids and framingham risk scores were noted , while slight declines in estimated gfr were observed. background .
in the united states , emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( ftc / tdf ) is a preferred nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nrti ) backbone with lamivudine / abacavir ( 3tc / abc ) as a commonly used alternative .
for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv - 1 ) virologically suppressed on a boosted protease inhibitor ( pi ) + 3tc / abc regimen , the merits of switching to ftc / tdf as the nrti backbone are unknown. methods .
swift was a prospective , randomized , open - label 48 - week study to evaluate efficacy and safety of switching to ftc / tdf .
subjects receiving 3tc / abc + pi + ritonavir ( rtv ) with hiv - 1 rna < 200 c / ml >= 3 months were randomized to continue 3tc / abc or switch to ftc / tdf .
the primary endpoint was time to loss of virologic response ( tlovr ) with noninferiority measured by delta of 12 % .
virologic failure ( vf ) was defined as confirmed rebound or the last hiv - 1 rna measurement on study drug >= 200 c / ml. results .
in total , 311 subjects were treated in this study ( 155 to pi + rtv + ftc / tdf , 156 to pi + rtv + 3tc / abc ) .
baseline characteristics were similar between the arms : 85 % male , 28 % black , median age , 46 years ; and median cd4 532 cells / mm3. by tlovr through week 48 , switching to ftc / tdf was noninferior compared to continued 3tc / abc ( 86.4 % vs 83.3 % , treatment difference 3.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 5.1 % to 11.2 %) .
fewer subjects on ftc / tdf experienced vf ( 3 vs 11 ; p = . 034 ) .
ftc / tdf showed greater declines in fasting low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , total cholesterol ( tc ) , and triglycerides ( tg ) with significant declines in ldl and tc beginning at week 12 with no tc / hdl ratio change .
switching to ftc / tdf showed improved ncep thresholds for tc and tg and improved 10 - year framingham tc calculated scores .
decreased epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was observed in both arms with a larger decrease in the ftc / tdf arm. conclusions .
switching to ftc / tdf from 3tc / abc maintained virologic suppression , had fewer vfs , improved lipid parameters and framingham scores but decreased egfr .

hiv - 1 ftc / tdf 3tc / abc virologic failure switch fixed - dose combination ( fdc ) antiretrovirals such as emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( ftc / tdf ) and lamivudine / abacavir ( 3tc / abc ) allow simplification of regimens to potentially improve outcomes by augmenting adherence [ 1 ] .
comparative studies of ftc / tdf to 3tc / abc - containing regimens tend to favor the ftc / tdf arm in regards to efficacy and / or safety [ 2 , 3 ] .
in a large , prospective , treatment - naive trial , subjects with baseline hiv - 1 rna > 100 000 c / ml had a lower rate of virologic failure on ftc / tdf compared to 3tc / abc - containing regimens [ 3 ] .
similarly , the bicombo study showed that virologically suppressed subjects on a 3tc - containing regimen had a lower rate of virologic failure when switched to ftc / tdf compared to 3tc / abc - containing regimens [ 2 ] .
in fact , the 3tc / abc arm was not noninferior or comparable to the ftc / tdf arm [ 2 ] .
the total cholesterol ( tc ) , low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , and triglycerides ( tg ) were significantly lower for subjects on ftc / tdf compared to 3tc / abc [ 4 ] .
in another study rocket 2 , virologically suppressed subjects with dyslipidemia on lopinavir / ritonavir ( lpv / r ) also showed significant declines in tc , ldl , and tg levels 12 weeks following switch to ftc / tdf - compared to 3tc / abc - containing regimens [ 5 ] .
other studies support similar lipid improvement with ftc / tdf [ 3 , 6 ] .
finally , some but not all studies have shown an association of 3tc / abc use with an increased relative risk rate of myocardial infarction ( mi ) [ 7 - 13 ] .
us treatment guidelines list ftc / tdf as a preferred and 3tc / abc as an alternative nrti backbone [ 1 , 14 ] .
in light of this , we undertook a prospective , randomized , open - label trial ( swift ) to evaluate the virologic efficacy and safety potentials and risks of a nucleos ( t ) ide backbone switch from 3tc / abc to ftc / tdf in virologically suppressed subjects receiving a ritonavir - boosted protease inhibitor ( pi ) based regimen .
methods the swift study was a 48 week prospective , randomized , open - label , multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching fdcs from 3tc / abc to ftc / tdf in virologically suppressed , hiv - 1 infected patients maintained on their boosted pi. eligible subjects were >= 18 years old , males and nonpregnant females , receiving 3tc / abc plus a boosted pi with hiv - 1 rna < 200 copies / ml for at least 3 months prior to study entry and < 200 copies / ml at screening by the cobas taqman version 1.0 assay ( taqman ) .
subjects had to have an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) >= 50 ml / minutes by the cockcroft - gault ( cg ) method , ast and alt <= 5 times the upper limit of normal , and , if receiving lipid - lowering agents , the drug and dose had to be stable for >= 3 months .
subjects were excluded if they were receiving antiretroviral agents in addition to 3tc / abc plus a boosted pi , had known historical resistance to any of the study agents including resistance mutations to ftc / tdf ( including k65r , m184v / i , or multiple thymidine analogs ) or pis .
subjects were stratified by lpv / r versus other pis , and by co - morbidities ( diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease ) .
antiviral efficacy was assessed by serial measurements of plasma hiv - 1 rna at baseline , and weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 , and at early study discontinuation , if it occurred .
subjects with hiv - 1 rna > 200 copies / ml had the test repeated at the investigator 's discretion .
the primary objective was to assess non - inferiority of ftc / tdf relative to 3tc / abc measured by the proportion of subjects who maintained hiv - 1 rna < 200 c / ml through week 48 ( intent - to - treat , missing = failure ) .
secondary objectives included evaluation of safety and tolerability , changes in cd4 cell count , assessment of egfr using the cg , and the abbreviated modified diet in renal disease ( mdrd ) methods , and evaluation of change in fasting lipid parameters ( tg , tc , ldl , hdl , tc : hdl ) .
in a subset , certain cardiovascular biomarkers ( high - sensitivity c - reactive protein [ hscrp ] , interleukin 6 [ il - 6 ] , interleukin 10 [ il - 10 ] , tumor necrosis factor alpha [ tnf - alpha ] , and fibrinogen ) were explored over the 48 weeks .
changes in the risk of coronary heart disease ( chd ) outcomes were determined by 10 - year framingham risk scores [ 15 , 16 ] .
statistical analysis the treated analysis set , used for safety and outcome summaries , includes subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug .
the intent to treat ( itt ) analysis set , used for efficacy analysis , excludes those with major protocol violations from the treated analysis set .
the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with hiv - 1 rna < 200 c / ml through week 48 by time to loss of virologic response ( tlovr ) algorithm .
tlovr responders were those who completed the study and maintained hiv - 1 rna < 200 c / ml through week 48 without intervening vf. vf was defined as confirmed on - study hiv - 1 rna >= 200 c / ml on 2 successive occasions or the last on - study hiv - 1 rna >= 200 c / ml. subjects were considered failures in the tlovr analysis if they experienced vf , discontinued study medication before week 48 , or changed to a new antiretroviral ( arv ) regimen .
a 2 - sided exact 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) for the difference in treatment group response rate ( ftc / tdf minus 3tc / abc ) was constructed using inverted 2 one - sided tests with the standardized statistics .
the ftc / tdf group was considered noninferior to the 3tc / abc group if the lower confidence bound of the responder difference was greater than - 12 % .
descriptive statistics summarize secondary efficacy endpoints .
confidence intervals ( 95 %) and tests of significance , all 2 - sided were also used for measure of interest of secondary efficacy endpoints .
observed values and changes from baseline in the risk of chd outcomes for the 10 - year framingham risk score were analyzed .
the framingham risk score was calculated based on using both the fasting tc score and also based on the fasting ldl score approaches .
framingham risk scores were summarized using descriptive statistics and differences between treatment groups and were compared using wilcoxon rank sum test .
the hiv - 1 rna threshold for vf was amended in the protocol 1 year into the study from 50 c / ml to 200 c / ml based on data regarding discordance between the cobas amplicor and the taqman hiv - 1 test .
the data showed an increased rate of samples with > 50 c / ml in the taqman assay that were < 50 c / ml in the cobas amplicor assay [ 17 ] .
this protocol change was consistent with the actg standard of < 200 c / ml [ 18 ] .
subjects meeting criteria for vf had genotypic resistance testing performed on their last available plasma sample if hiv - 1 rna > 1000 c / ml. results a total of 312 subjects were randomized from 76 north american centers .
one subject randomized to ftc / tdf withdrew consent before receiving study treatment and was excluded from the efficacy and safety analysis .
overall , 311 subjects were randomized and treated ( 155 started ftc / tdf and 156 continued 3tc / abc ) .
one subject randomized to ftc / tdf was excluded from the itt analysis set for a major protocol violation ( documented prior resistance to study drug ) .

efficacy results at week 48 , tlovr responses were 133 of 155 ( 86.4 %) for the ftc / tdf arm compared to 130 of 156 ( 83.3 %) with continued 3tc / abc , representing a treatment difference of 3.0 % ( 95 % ci , - 5.1 % to 11.2 %) , establishing noninferiorty .
additionally , fewer people had virologic failure in the ftc / tdf arm vs 3tc / abc , 3 / 155 ( 1.9 %) vs 11 / 156 ( 7.1 %) ; p = . 034 through week 48 ( figure 1 ) .
all 3 subjects who experienced virologic failure in the ftc / tdf arm had low - level viremia ( range , 209 - 452 copies / ml ) ; low adherence was not reported in these subjects with low - level viremia .
two were receiving atazanavir / ritonavir and 1 boosted fosamprenavir. of the 11 subjects with virologic failure in the 3tc / abc arm , 3 discontinued study drug early , and 8 subjects experienced viremia ( range , 272 - 6430 copies / ml ) at the week 48 visit. of these 11 subjects , 5 were receiving atazanavir / ritonavir , 4 lopinavir / ritonavir , 1 fosamprenavir / ritonavir , and 1 darunavir / ritonavir .
no specific boosted pi regimen was associated with virologic failure .

four virologic failure subjects had hiv - 1 rna values above 1000 copies / ml and had genotypic and phenotypic analyses : 1 subject in the ftc / tdf arm and 3 subjects in the 3tc / abc arm .
no genotypic resistance to study drugs was observed in any subject in either arm through week 48 .
note , of the 4 subjects who were suppressed at screening but above the hiv - 1 rna value of 200 copies / ml at baseline , 2 were virologic successes due to post - baseline ongoing virologic suppression , 1 was a virologic failure due to detectable but low - level viremia at week 48 while on ftc / tdf , and 1 subject was excluded from the itt analysis set due to a major protocol violation .
changes in cd4 count at week 48 were similar between treatment arms with median ( iqr ) changes of 8 ( - 49 , 80 ) and 39 ( - 41 , 125 ) cells / mm3 for the ftc / tdf and the 3tc / abc arms , respectively ( p = . 10 ) .
subjects who switched to ftc / tdf from 3tc / abc showed reductions from baseline at week 48 in fasting tc ( median change of - 21 mg / dl vs - 3 mg / dl with 3tc / abc , p < . 001 ) , and ldl ( - 7 mg / dl vs 2 mg / dl with 3tc / abc ; p = . 007 ) .
there were no differences in lipid lowering agent modification between arms during the study .
no differences in hdl ( p = . 26 ) , tg ( p = . 074 ) or hdl / tc ratio ( p = . 17 ) were observed ( supplement 1 ) .
at baseline , there was no difference in the distribution across national cholesterol education program ( ncep ) categories between the 2 treatment groups ; ncep sets cholesterol guidelines in the united states [ 16 ] .
at week 48 , a higher percentage of subjects who switched to ftc / tdf were in the desirable ncep categories for tc and tg compared to those who remained on 3tc / abc ( tc : 62 % vs 45 % < 200 mg / dl , p = . 005 ; tg : 60 % vs 41 % < 150 mg / dl , p = . 003 ) ( figure 2 ) .

switching to ftc / tdf resulted in improvements in the predicted risk for chd outcomes as measured by framingham risk scores .
mean ( sd ) change from baseline in risk by the tc formula was - 1.0 ( 4.32 ) for the ftc / tdf arm at week 12 ( p = . 008 ) ; this reduction was also maintained through week 48 with a mean ( sd ) change from baseline of - 1.2 ( 4.39 ) and p = . 006 .
when the ldl formula was used , mean ( sd ) change from baseline in framingham risk was - 0.9 ( 3.07 ) for the ftc / tdf arm at week 12 ( p < . 001 ) and was - 0.5 ( 3.93 ) at week 48 ( p = . 21 ) .
the mean change for all calculated framingham scores in the 3tc / abc group fluctuated about the baseline level with no statistically significant changes from baseline observed .
the difference between groups for the predicted risk of chd ( regardless of method of calculation ) only achieved statistical significance at week 24 ( p < . 05 ) .
the ftc / tdf group further demonstrated a shift from higher risk framingham categories to lower risk categories ( figure 3 ) .

adverse events the safety and tolerability for both treatment arms in swift were consistent with the known safety profiles of ftc / tdf and 3tc / abc ( table 2 ) .
similar percentages of subjects in each arm reported any serious adverse event ( sae ) , any adverse event ( ae ) , or any grade 3 or 4 treatment - emergent ae. three subjects died during the study : 1 subject in the ftc / tdf group ( suicide ) and 2 subjects in the 3tc / abc group ( homicide , lymphoma ) .
none of the deaths or saes was considered by the investigator to be related to study ( table 3 ) .
there was one pregnancy in the 3tc / abc arm with a spontaneous abortion , which was considered unrelated to the study drug .

discussion in this large , prospective , randomized trial , the first study specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from 3tc / abc to ftc / tdf in hiv - 1 - infected subjects suppressed on a pi + rtv containing regimen , we have demonstrated that ftc / tdf is noninferior to remaining on 3tc / abc in maintaining treatment response by tlovr with fewer vfs , as well as a lower risk of emergent resistance through 48 weeks .
efficacy and virologic failure rates in subjects on ftc / tdf compared to 3tc / abc arm were comparable to results seen with this fdc seen in the bicombo and assert trials [ 2 , 19 ] .
we did observe slightly higher rates of discontinuation due to aes and mild aes considered study drug - related in the ftc / tdf vs 3tc / abc arms .
this finding is not unexpected as previous studies demonstrate an increase in certain adverse events when stable subjects are switched to a new therapy .
modest declines in egfr occurred in both arms with the degree of decline significantly greater in ftc / tdf - treated subjects ; however , values remained in the normal range .
long - term studies have shown that the use of tdf may be associated with initial declines in gfr within the first few months of starting tdf , which then stabilize [ 20 - 22 ] .
importantly , there were no differences between arms in emergent proteinuria and or normoglycemic glycosuria ( table 4 ) .
comorbidities ( ftc / tdf vs 3tc / abc ) were common in our study population , including diabetes ( 10 % vs11 %) , hyperlipidemia ( 52 % vs 62 %) , and hypertension ( 33 % vs 33 %) .
additionally , 3.2 % in both arms had a history of mi. as with previous studies , we demonstrated lipid benefits when switching to ftc / tdf [ 3 - 6 ] .
significant declines in ldl and tc were observed by week 12 in the ftc / tdf arm and significant reductions in tc , ldl , and tg were seen at week 48. by ncep category criteria [ 16 ] , higher percentages showed improvements in tc and ldl , as well as improvement ( shift from a higher risk to a lower risk category ) in the predicted risk for chd outcomes with ftc / tdf as seen in other comparative studies [ 2 , 5 ] .
in an ad hoc analysis , we found that the predicted framingham 10 - yr risk score was more favorable when switching ftc / tdf ; particularly , for those with comorbidities , whites , and regimens with a pi other than lpv / r. such an improvement in framingham scores is perhaps one of the most novel benefits of switching from an 3tc / abc to ftc / tdf - containing regimen .
it is however , worthwhile to note that the small number of subjects on lpv / r and other confounding factors at baseline may make this a weaker correlation and may limit these results from being generalized .
finally , the changes from baseline in commonly used surrogate cardiovascular biomarkers ( hscrp , il - 10 , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and fibrinogen ) between the ftc / tdf and 3tc / abc arm in a subset of 159 subjects were not significant except a trend toward significance with fibrinogen ( p = . 062 ) ( table 5 ) , perhaps with a larger sample size it may have achieved significance .
the swift study showed that high rates of virologic suppression were well maintained through 48 weeks with fewer virologic failures in subjects who switched to ftc / tdf , and also this regimen is well tolerated .
decreases in creatinine clearance did occur with both treatments and were greater in the ftc / tdf arm .
in the ftc / tdf arm , improvements in certain lipid parameters and in other measures including in ncep categories and framingham predicted risk for chd outcomes were noted [ 15 , 16 ] .
in summary , switching patients on a boosted pi regimen to ftc / tdf from 3tc / abc is associated with important metabolic benefits without loss of virologic control .

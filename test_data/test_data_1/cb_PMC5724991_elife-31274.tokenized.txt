in cycling human endometrium , menstruation is followed by rapid estrogen - dependent growth .
upon ovulation , progesterone and rising cellular camp levels activate the transcription factor forkhead box o1 ( foxo1 ) in endometrial stromal cells ( enscs ) , leading to cell cycle exit and differentiation into decidual cells that control embryo implantation .
here we show that foxo1 also causes acute senescence of a subpopulation of decidualizing enscs in an il - 8 dependent manner .
selective depletion or enrichment of this subpopulation revealed that decidual senescence drives the transient inflammatory response associated with endometrial receptivity .
further , senescent cells prevent differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in decidualizing cultures .
as the cycle progresses , il - 15 activated uterine natural killer ( unk ) cells selectively target and clear senescent decidual cells through granule exocytosis .
our findings reveal that acute decidual senescence governs endometrial rejuvenation and remodeling at embryo implantation , and suggest a critical role for unk cells in maintaining homeostasis in cycling endometrium .

introduction different mammalian species employ divergent strategies to ensure successful embryo implantation .
in mice , synchronized implantation of multiple embryos ( average 6 - 8 ) is dependent on a transient rise in circulating estradiol ( e2 ) that not only renders the progesterone - primed endometrium receptive , but also activates dormant blastocysts for implantation ( paria et al. , 1998 ) .
upon breaching of the uterine luminal epithelium , implanting murine embryos trigger extensive remodeling of the endometrial stromal compartment .
this process , termed decidualization , is characterized by local edema , influx of unk cells and differentiation of stromal fibroblasts into specialized decidual cells that coordinate trophoblast invasion and placenta formation ( gellersen and brosens , 2014 ; zhang et al. , 2013 ) .
likewise , the human endometrium transiently expresses a receptive phenotype , lasting 2 - 4 days , during the mid - luteal phase of the cycle .
however , this implantation window is not controlled by a nidatory e2 surge ( de ziegler et al. , 1992 ; groll et al. , 2009 ) , perhaps reflecting that synchronized implantation of multiple human embryos is neither required nor desirable .
further , decidualization of the stromal compartment is not dependent on an implanting embryo but initiated during the mid - luteal phase of each cycle in response to elevated circulating progesterone levels and increased intracellular camp production ( gellersen and brosens , 2014 ) .
in parallel , cd56bright cd16 - unk cells accumulate in luteal phase endometrium .
in pregnancy , unk cells exert an evolutionarily conserved role in orchestrating vascular adaptation and trophoblast invasion ( hanna et al. , 2006 ; xiong et al. , 2013 ) , but their function in cycling human endometrium is unclear .
differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells ( enscs ) into decidual cells is a multistep process ( gellersen and brosens , 2014 ) .
following cell cycle exit at g0 / g1 , decidualizing enscs first mount a transient pro - inflammatory response , characterized by a burst of free radical production and secretion of various chemokines and other inflammatory mediators ( al - sabbagh et al. , 2011 ; lucas et al. , 2016b ; salker et al. , 2012 ) .
exposure of the mouse uterus to this inflammatory secretome activates multiple receptivity genes , suggesting that the nidatory e2 surge in mice is supplanted by an endogenous inflammatory signal in the human uterus .
feedback loops purportedly limit the inflammatory decidual response to 2 - 4 days ( salker et al. , 2012 ) .
the next decidual phase coincides with embedding of the implanted embryo into the stroma .
at this stage , fully differentiated decidual cells , which are now tightly adherent and possess gap junctions ( laws et al. , 2008 ) , form an immune privileged matrix around the semi - allogenic conceptus ( erlebacher , 2013 ) .
in the absence of implantation , falling progesterone levels trigger a second inflammatory decidual response which , upon recruitment and activation of leukocytes , leads to tissue breakdown , focal bleeding and menstrual shedding of the superficial endometrial layer .
scar - free tissue repair involves activation of mesenchymal stem - like cells ( mscs ) and epithelial progenitor cells that reside in the basal layer ( evans et al. , 2016 ) .
following menstruation , rising follicular e2 levels drive rapid tissue growth , which over ~ 10 days increases the thickness of the endometrium several - fold .
clinically , suboptimal endometrial growth is strongly associated with reproductive failure ( yuan et al. , 2016 ) ; but how msc activation followed by intense proliferation is linked to the decidual process is unclear .
foxo1 is a core decidual transcription factor that controls cell cycle exit of enscs in response to differentiation signals and activates expression of decidual marker genes , such as prl and igfbp1 ( park et al. , 2016 ; takano et al. , 2007 ) .
here we demonstrate that foxo1 also induces acute senescence in a subpopulation of enscs .
we show that the senescence - associated secretory phenotype ( sasp ) drives the initial auto - inflammatory decidual response linked to endometrial receptivity and provide evidence that unk cells target and eliminate senescent decidual cells as the cycle progresses .
our findings reveal a hitherto unrecognized role for acute cellular senescence in endometrial remodeling at the time of embryo implantation ; and suggest a major role for unk cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis from cycle to cycle .
results decidualization induces acute senescence in a subpopulation of enscs to determine if cycling human endometrium harbor dynamic populations of senescent cells , we first stained primary ensc cultures for senescence - associated beta - galactosidase ( sabetag ) activity .
at passage 1 ( p1 ) , sabetag + cells were detectable in variable numbers in different cultures ( figure 1a ) .
strikingly , the number of sabetag + cells increased markedly upon decidualization with 8 - bromo - camp and medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa , a progestin ) .
typically , sabetag + cells formed islets surrounded by sabetag - enscs in differentiating cultures ( figure 1a ) .
quantitative analysis confirmed a time - dependent increase in sabetag activity upon decidualization ( figure 1b ) .
the abundance of sabetag + cells in undifferentiated cultures declined upon passaging of cells ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1a ) .
initially , this was paralleled by a reduction in sabetag activity , which was reversed at later passages ( p6 ) ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1b ) , presumably reflecting emerging replicative exhaustion of enscs ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1c ) .
however , even after ~ 60 days in continuous culture , exposure of enscs to a deciduogenic stimulus enhanced sabetag activity and triggered the appearance of sabetag + cells ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1a and b ) .

although sabetag activity is a commonly used biomarker for senescent cells , it lacks specificity ( matjusaitis et al. , 2016 ) .
hence , we examined the expression of other putative senescence markers in undifferentiated and decidualizing enscs .
many senescence signals converge onto the tumor suppressor protein p53 ( p53 ) and induce the expression of cyclin - dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitors , leading to proliferative arrest and cell cycle exit ( munoz - espin and serrano , 2014 ; van deursen , 2014 ) .
we reported previously that downregulation of mdm2 proto - oncogene , an e3 ubiquitin ligase , stabilizes p53 in differentiating enscs ( pohnke et al. , 2004 ) .
western blot analysis showed that p53 stabilization upon decidualization is paralleled by upregulation of p16ink4a ( p16 ; figure 1c ) , a cdk inhibitor presumed specific for senescence .
notably , confocal microscopy revealed that induction of p16 upon decidualization is confined to a subpopulation of enscs ( figure 1d ) .
loss of lamin b1 ( lmnb1 ) and high mobility group box 2 ( hmgb2 ) drives many of the chromatin and epigenetic changes that underpin cellular senescence ( aird et al. , 2016 ; sadaie et al. , 2013 ) .
decidualization resulted in downregulation of both effector proteins and a reciprocal increase in the histone h2a variant macroh2a ( mh2a ) and trimethylated lysine 9 on histone h3 ( h3k9me3 ) ( figure 1c and figure 1 - - figure supplement 1d ) .
this histone variant and modification are involved in senescence - associated heterochromatin formation ( sahf ) .
unexpectedly , the nucleosome linker histone h1 ( h.h1 ) , which purportedly is lost in senescent cells ( funayama et al. , 2006 ) , was upregulated upon decidualization ( figure 1c and figure 1 - - figure supplement 1d ) .
these observations were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy ( figure 1e , left panel ) , which also revealed that the nuclei of ensc increase in size (~ 40 %) upon decidualization ( figure 1e , right panel ) .
next , we examined if the transient inflammatory decidual response also encompasses secreted factors typical of the canonical senescence associated secretory phenotype ( sasp ) .
as shown in figure 1f , secretion of il - 8 ( cxcl8 ) , groalpha ( cxcl1 ) , and il - 6 peaked transiently on day 2 of decidualization and returned to baseline by day 4. by day 8 , the level of secretion of groalpha and il - 6 was lower than that observed in undifferentiated cultures .
taken together , the data reveal striking similarities between cellular senescence and differentiation of enscs into decidual cells .
however , only a subpopulation of enscs became strongly sabetag + or expressed p16 upon decidualization .
further , while sasp is often a sustained response , decidual inflammation is temporally restricted to 2 - 4 days .
temporal regulation of senescent cell populations in cycling endometrium to extrapolate these observations to the in vivo situation , protein lysates from whole endometrial biopsies were subjected to western blot analysis .
as the cycle progresses from the proliferative to the secretory phase , the abundance of p53 , p16 , lmnb1 , hmbg2 , mh2a and h3k9me3 in the endometrium mimicked the changes observed in decidualizing ensc cultures ( figure 2a ) .
further , analysis of snap - frozen biopsies showed a sharp increase in sabetag activity upon transition from proliferative to early - secretory endometrium with levels peaking in the late - luteal phase ( figure 2b ) .
disintegration of the stromal compartment upon cryosectioning of frozen tissue samples precluded a meaningful analysis of sabetag + cells .
instead , we used immunohistochemistry to examine the abundance and tissue distribution of p16 + cells in 308 formalin - fixed endometrial biopsies obtained during the peri - implantation window , i.e. 6 to 12 days after the luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surge ( figure 2c ) .
the statistical distribution of p16 + cells in the glandular epithelium , luminal epithelium and stromal compartment is presented as a centile graph ( figure 2d ) .
interestingly , p16 + cells were most prevalent in both the glandular and luminal epithelium at lh + 10 and + 11 , which coincides with the onset of the late - luteal phase of the cycle .
the relative abundance of p16 + cells was ~ 10 fold higher in the luminal compared to the glandular compartment .
typically , stretches of p16 + cells were interspersed by p16 - cells in the luminal epithelium ( figure 2c ). by contrast , p16 + cells gradually increased in the stromal compartment during the mid - luteal phase and this was accelerated in late - luteal endometrium .
occasionally , swirls of p16 + cells were observed in the stroma , seemingly connecting the deeper regions of the endometrium to p16 + luminal epithelial cells ( figure 2c ) .
collectively , the data indicate that the endometrium harbors dynamic and probably spatially organized populations of senescent cells during the luteal phase of the cycle .

foxo1 drives ensc differentiation and senescence to gain insight into the mechanism that drives decidual senescence , sabetag activity was measured in cultured enscs treated for 8 days with either 8 - bromo - camp , mpa or a combination .
both 8 - bromo - camp and mpa were required for significant induction of sabetag activity ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3a ) .
in differentiating enscs , camp and progesterone signaling converge on foxo1 , a core decidual transcription factor responsible for cell cycle arrest and induction of decidual marker genes , such as prl and igfbp1 ( takano et al. , 2007 ) .
interestingly , foxo1 was also shown to induce cellular senescence of ovarian cancer cells treated with progesterone ( diep et al. , 2013 ) .
sirna - mediated knockdown of foxo1 in enscs not only abolished the induction of prl and igfbp1 ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 1a ) but also the surge in il - 8 , groalpha , and il - 6 secretion upon treatment of cultures with 8 - bromo - camp and mpa ( figure 3b ) .
after 8 days of decidualization , foxo1 knockdown was less efficient but nevertheless sufficient to significantly blunt sabetag activity ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3c ) .
several components of the sasp have been implicated in autocrine / paracrine propagation of senescence , including il - 8 acting on cxcr2 ( il - 8 receptor type b ) ( acosta et al. , 2008 ) .
in agreement , decidualization of enscs in the presence of sb265610 , a potent cxcr2 inhibitor , attenuated sabetag activity in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 3d ) .
conversely , recombinant il - 8 upregulated sabetag activity in undifferentiated enscs in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 3d ) , although spatial organization of sabetag + cells into ' islets' was not observed ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 1b ) .
further , sirna - mediated cxcl8 ( coding il - 8 ) knockdown in undifferentiated enscs not only blunted the surge in il - 8 secretion upon decidualization ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 1b ) , but also abolished the increase in sabetag activity ( figure 3e ) .
unexpectedly , il - 8 knockdown compromised the induction of prl and igfbp1 in cultures treated with 8 - bromo - camp and mpa ( figure 3f ) , indicating that autocrine / paracrine signals involved in ensc differentiation also drive decidual senescence .

scale bars = 100 mum .
in an attempt to block decidual senescence selectively , enscs were differentiated in the presence or absence of the mtor inhibitor rapamycin , a pharmacological repressor of replicative senescence ( demidenko et al. , 2009 ) .
rapamycin prevented expansion of sabetag + cells upon decidualization but also abolished expression of prl and igfbp1 ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 1c and d ). by contrast , withdrawal of 8 - bromo - camp and mpa from cultures first decidualized for 8 days reversed the induction of decidual marker genes ( figure 3g ) , albeit without impacting on either sabetag activity or expression of p53 , p16 , lmnb1 and hmgb1 ( figure 3h ) .
taken together , the data demonstrate that foxo1 drives both differentiation and senescence of distinct ensc subpopulations in an il - 8 dependent manner ; however , while expression of differentiation markers requires continuous camp and progestin signaling , the senescent phenotype does not .
pleiotropic functions of senescent decidual cells the abundance of sabetag + cells in undifferentiated cultures correlated closely with the number of sabetag + cells upon decidualization ( pearson 's r = 0.97 , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 1a ) .
a congruent correlation was apparent upon measuring sabetag activity in paired undifferentiated and decidualizing cultures ( pearson 's r = 0.91 , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 4a ) , inferring that senescent decidual cells arise from stressed ( presenescent ) enscs .
hence , we tested if decidualization - associated senescence could be blocked by pretreating undifferentiated cultures with senolytic drugs .
exposure of primary enscs for 72 hr to increasing concentrations of abt - 263 ( navitoclax ) , a bcl - xl inhibitor ( zhu et al. , 2016 ) , had no discernible impact on the induction of sabetag activity upon decidualization ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 1b ). by contrast , pretreatment of primary cultures with dasatinib , a broad - spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( childs et al. , 2017 ; zhu et al. , 2015 ) , inhibited sabetag activity upon decidualization in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 1c ) .
conversely , to increase the abundance sabetag + cells , undifferentiated enscs were treated with the cdk4 / cdk6 inhibitor palbociclib ( pd0332991 ) , a functional p16 mimetic ( mosteiro et al. , 2016 ) .
dose - response analyses showed that treatment with palbociclib for 4 days was sufficient to increase sabetag activity in undifferentiated enscs to the level observed in cells decidualized with 8 - bromo - camp and mpa for 8 days ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 1c ) .
notably , neither dasatinib nor palbociclib pretreatment impacted on the induction of prl or igfbp1 upon decidualization ( figure 4c ) .
however , dasatinib pretreatment markedly blunted the surge in il - 8 , il - 6 , and groalpha secretion that characterizes the initial decidual phase. by contrast , this auto - inflammatory decidual response was amplified in response to palbociclib pretreatment ( figure 4d ) .

in other cell systems , transient - but not prolonged - exposure to sasp has been shown to promote tissue rejuvenation by reprogramming committed cells into stem - like cells ( ritschka et al. , 2017 ) .
we reasoned that sasp - dependent tissue rejuvenation during the window of implantation may be relevant for the transition of the cycling endometrium into the decidua of pregnancy .
to test this hypothesis , we examined the clonogenic capacity of paired undifferentiated cells and cells decidualized for 8 days .
analysis of 12 primary cultures demonstrated that decidualization is associated with a modest but significant increase in colony - forming cells ( p < 0.05 ) , although the response varied between primary cultures ( figure 4e ) .
however , pretreatment of undifferentiated cultures with dasatinib or palbociclib consistently increased or decreased the clonogenic capacity of decidualizing cultures , respectively ( figure 4f ) .
likewise , rapamycin also depleted decidualizing ensc cultures of clonogenic cells ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 1d ) .
taken together , the data suggest that senescent decidual cells produce a transient inflammatory environment that not only contributes to endometrial receptivity but also increases tissue plasticity prior to pregnancy .
immune clearance of senescent decidual cells recognition and elimination of senescent cells by immune cells , especially nk cells , play a pivotal role in tissue repair and homeostasis ( iannello and raulet , 2013 ; krizhanovsky et al. , 2008 ) .
during the luteal phase , unk cells , characterized by their cd56bright cell surface phenotype ( figure 5 - - figure supplement 1a ) , are by far the dominant endometrial leukocyte population .
analysis of a large number of lh - timed endometrial biopsies ( n = 1,997 ) demonstrated that the abundance of cd56 + unk cells in the endometrial stromal compartment increases on average 3 - fold between lh + 5 and + 12 ; although inter - patient variability was marked ( figure 5a , left panel ) .
the heatmap in figure 5a ( right panel ) depicts the unk cell centiles across the peri - implantation window .
notably , unk cells often appear to amass in edematous areas that are relatively depleted of stromal cells , especially during the transition from the mid - to late - luteal phase of the cycle ( figure 5b , left panel ) .
quantitative analysis of 20 biopsies obtained between lh + 9 and lh + 11 confirmed the inverse correlation between the density of unk cells and endometrial stromal cells ( figure 5b , right panel ) .
in co - culture , unk cells isolated from secretory endometrium had no impact on proliferation or viability of undifferentiated enscs ( figure 5 - - figure supplement 1b , left panel ). by contrast , co - culture of unk cells with enscs first decidualized for 8 days resulted in loss of cell viability .
visually , unk cells transformed the monolayer of decidual cells into a honeycomb pattern with cell - free islets ( figure 5c ) .
selective targeting and clearance of decidual cells by unk cells was also captured by time - lapse microscopy ( see video 1 ) .

10.7554 / elife.31274.016 these observations suggested that unk cells actively eliminate senescent enscs but only upon decidualization .
in agreement , co - culturing of unk cells with enscs eliminated the induction of sabetag activity upon decidualization without affecting basal activity in undifferentiated cells ( figure 5d ) .
two independent mechanisms underpin nk cell - mediated clearance of stressed cells ( sagiv et al. , 2013 ) .
first , binding of the nk cell surface ligands trail and fas ligand ( fasl ) to the corresponding receptors on target cells can lead to caspase activation and cell death .
however , incubation of primary enscs with increasing concentrations of fasl or trail had no impact on sabetag activity in either undifferentiated or decidualizing cells ( figure 5 - - figure supplement 1c ) , inferring that death receptor activation is not required for unk cell - mediated senolysis .
the second mechanism involves secretion by activated nk cells of granules containing perforin and granzyme ( a , b ) .
perforin forms pores in the plasma membrane of target cells and triggers apoptosis upon release of granzyme into the cytoplasm ( chowdhury and lieberman , 2008 ) .
as shown in figure 5d and figure 5 - - figure supplement 1b , both the pan - caspase inhibitor z - vad - fmk and the granzyme b inhibitor 3,4 - dichloroisocoumarin ( 3,4 - dci ) negated the impact of unk cells on sabetag activity and cell viability in decidualizing cultures .
to explore why unk cell - mediated clearance of sabetag + enscs is restricted to decidualizing cultures , we focused on il - 15 , a pivotal cytokine that regulates nk cell proliferation and activation ( marcais et al. , 2014 ) .
il - 15 secretion was below the level of detection in undifferentiated cells but , after a lag - period of 2 days , rose markedly upon decidualization of enscs in a time - dependent manner ( figure 5e ) .
notably , pretreatment of cultures with dasatinib or palbociclib had no impact on impact on il - 15 secretion , suggesting that differentiated enscs orchestrate the unk - mediated clearance of their senescent counterparts ( figure 5e ) .
incubation of co - cultures with an il - 15 blocking antibody antagonized , at least partly , unk cell - mediated clearance of senescent decidual cells ( figure 5f ) .
furthermore , a blocking antibody against nkg2d ( natural killer group 2d ) , a receptor expressed by all human nk cells and cd8 - positive t cells that binds surface ligands expressed on stressed cells ( sagiv et al. , 2016 ) , also attenuated unk cell - mediated killing of senescent decidual cells ( figure 5 - - figure supplement 1d ) .
tissue homeostasis our findings indicate that endometrial homeostasis during the luteal phase is dependent on balancing induction and clearance of senescent decidual cells .
we speculated that this process is a priori dynamic , which should be reflected in varying numbers of unk cells in different cycles .
as proof of concept , we quantified unk cells in biopsies from three patients obtained around the same time in the mid - luteal phase (+/ - 1 day ) in three different cycles .
as shown in figure 6a , the abundance of unk cells in the subluminal endometrial stroma can vary profoundly between cycles .
as levels both rose and fell , the observed inter - cycle changes in unk cell density are unlikely triggered by the tissue injury caused by the biopsy , although an impact on the magnitude of change cannot be excluded .
additional examples of unk cell fluctuations in two consecutive cycles are presented in figure 6 - - figure supplement 1 .

discussion in contrast to chronic senescence associated with organismal ageing , acute senescence is a tightly orchestrated biological process implicated in embryo development , wound healing and tissue repair .
typically , acute senescent cells produce a context - specific sasp with defined paracrine functions and self - organize their elimination by various immune cells ( van deursen , 2014 ) .
here we provide evidence that acute decidual senescence is a pivotal process that coordinates acquisition of a receptive phenotype with endometrial remodeling and rejuvenation during the implantation process .
we reported previously that decidual transformation of primary enscs is a stepwise process that starts with a nox4 - dependent burst of free radicals and release of multiple inflammatory mediators ( al - sabbagh et al. , 2011 ; lucas et al. , 2016b ; salker et al. , 2012 ) .
exposure of the mouse uterus to this inflammatory secretome induced expression of multiple implantation genes and enabled efficient implantation of in vitro cultured mouse embryos ( salker et al. , 2012 ) .
we now demonstrate that this nidatory decidual signal is driven foremost by acute senescence of a subpopulation of enscs .
the close correlation between sabetag activity before and after decidualization suggests that polarization of enscs upon cell cycle exit into differentiating and senescent cells is not stochastic but determined by the level of replicative stress incurred by individual enscs during the preceding proliferative phase ( figure 7 ) .
acute senescence rejuvenates the receptive endometrium through two distinct mechanisms .
first , we demonstrated that blocking of decidual senescence with rapamycin or elimination of senescent cells with dasatinib result in loss of clonal mscs in differentiating ensc cultures. by contrast , amplification of senescence in response palbociclib treatment consistently increased the clonal cell population .
these observations indicate that the decidual sasp not only ' locks in ' endometrial mscs upon decidualization but , dependent on the amplitude of the inflammatory response , also de - differentiates more committed cells into clonal mscs ( de keizer , 2017 ; ritschka et al. , 2017 ) .
arguably , an adequate msc population may be required for decidual expansion in pregnancy .
second , clearance of senescent decidual cells upon unk cell activation ensures that the embryo embeds in a preponderance of mature decidual cells .
in co - culture , unk cell mediated clearance of sabetag + cells transformed the decidual cell monolayer into a honeycomb pattern .
if recapitulated in vivo , this observation suggests a role for unk cells in creating ingresses in the tightly adherent decidual cell matrix to facilitate trophoblast invasion and anchoring of the conceptus .
compared to undifferentiated enscs , decidual cells are highly resistant to various stress signals , convert inactive cortisone into cortisol through the induction of 11beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 , and protect the embryo - maternal interface from influx of t - cells by silencing genes coding for key chemokines ( erlebacher , 2013 ; gellersen and brosens , 2014 ) .
taken together , these observations suggest that senescent decidual cells trigger a dynamic tissue reaction that ultimately results in enclosure of the conceptus into an immune - privileged decidual matrix .
in pregnancy , unk cells express senescence markers and are proangiogenic rather than cytotoxic ( rajagopalan and long , 2012 ). whether prior exposure to senescent decidual cells contributes to this gestational phenotype of unk cells is an intriguing but as yet untested possibility .
10.7554 / elife.31274.019 figure 7 .
schematic summary .
we propose that rapid endometrial growth during the proliferative phase is important for implantation as it imparts replication stress in a subpopulation of enscs .
upon cell cycle exit at g0 / g1 , this subpopulation of stressed enscs do not differentiate into specialist decidual cells but undergo acute cellular senescence and secrete a host of inflammatory mediators ( senescence associated secretory phenotype ; sasp ) involved in endometrial receptivity .
in parallel , il - 15 secreted by differentiated decidual cells activates unk cells , which then target and eliminate senescent cells through granule exocytosis .
systematic clearance of acutely senescent decidual cells by unk cells not only remodels but also rejuvenates the endometrium at the time of embryo implantation .
notably , p16 + epithelial cells were present throughout the peri - implantation window , although relatively much more so in the luminal compared to glandular epithelium .
it is conceivable that p16 + luminal epithelial cells play a role in directing the embryo to preferential sites of implantation .
however , the abundance of p16 + cells in both epithelial compartments peaked on the transition of mid - to late - luteal phase , which in turn points towards a potential role for cellular senescence in rendering the endometrium refractory to further implantation .
the mechanism driving senescence of endometrial epithelial cells may differ from that in stromal cells .
for example , unlike their stromal counterparts , endometrial epithelial cells express human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( htert ) and exhibit dynamic telomerase activity ( hapangama et al. , 2017 ) .
interestingly , htert expression and telomerase activity fall dramatically during the mid - luteal phase in the cycle , i.e. preceding the rise in p16 + epithelial cells observed in this study .
telomere lengths are also shortest during the mid - secretory phase , which points to an alternative mechanism of triggering cell cycle exit and senescence of epithelial cells .
clinically , recurrent pregnancy loss ( rpl ) is a distressing disorder that often remains unexplained despite extensive investigations ( lucas et al. , 2016a ) .
embryonic chromosome instability accounts for a majority of sporadic failures .
however , the likelihood of an underlying endometrial defect compromising the development of a euploid embryo increases with each additional failure .
nevertheless , the cumulative live birth rate following multiple miscarriages or ivf failures is high ( lucas et al. , 2016a ; smith et al. , 2015 ) , which suggests that embryo - endometrial interactions are intrinsically dynamic .
our findings point towards a new paradigm that accounts for the observation that rpl does not preclude a successful pregnancy .
if the level of replicative stress during the proliferative phase is efficiently counterbalanced by unk cell - mediated clearance of senescence decidual cells during the luteal phase , implantation competence of the endometrium is assured and , in the absence of other pathology , reproductive fitness should be maximal .
if not , the frequency of aberrant cycles , and thus the likelihood of reproductive failure , is predicted to increase in line with the degree of endometrial dyshomeostasis .
for example , the endometrium in rpl patients is characterized by msc deficiency , heightened cellular senescence and a prolonged and disordered decidual inflammatory response ( lucas et al. , 2016b ; salker et al. , 2012 ) .
our model predicts that excessive decidual senescence can be counterbalanced by increased unk cell proliferation and activation , thus tending towards homeostasis and leading to intermittent normal cycles .
importantly , the degree of endometrial msc deficiency correlates with the number of previous miscarriages and , by extension , the likelihood of further failure ( lucas et al. , 2016b ) .
this observation provides credence to our assertion that the chance of a successful pregnancy correlates inversely with the severity of endometrial dyshomeostasis .
the corollary of an intrinsic ability to balance induction and clearance of senescent cells from cycle to cycle is that the human endometrium seems refractory to ageing and maintains its function throughout the reproductive years ( hapangama et al. , 2017 ) .
in summary , acute senescence of a subpopulation of stromal cells upon decidualization triggers a multi - step process that transforms the cycling endometrium into a gestational tissue .
endometrial remodeling at the time of embryo implantation is controlled spatiotemporally by the level of decidual senescence and the efficacy of immune clearance .

summary : in this study brosens and collaborators present a novel hypothesis about the role of cell senescence during the implantation phase of pregnancy .
the thesis is that a sub - population of endometrial stromal fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence and in the course of that produce a cocktail of inflammatory signals that leads to the inflammatory activation necessary for implantation .
later these cells get removed leading to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix encouraging implantation .
this model is supported by experiments with primary endometrial cell culture and a large amount of clinical data .
essential revisions : 1 ) co localization of some of the markers such as p16 and sabg should be conducted to ensure this sole population of cells .
2 ) when conducting withdrawal of camp mpa they see an increase in the senescent markers they should address if this is maintenance of senescence of cell death due to hormonal support .
3 ) there are multiple seemingly independent approaches that the authors piece together in the final analysis which would be greatly improved by a schematic diagram of what they think is going on based on the data presented .
4 ) importantly , the clinical data about the human subjects is incomplete .
did the samples come from women with no abnormalities and with proven fertility ?
gynecologic disorders ?
ovulatory disorders ?
endocrine disorders ?
recurrent miscarriage ?
recurrent implantation failure ?
unexplained infertility ?
how do the authors know whether their observations are unique to women with abnormal reproductive outcomes ?
10.7554 / elife.31274.024 author response essential revisions : 1 ) co localization of some of the markers such as p16 and sabg should be conducted to ensure this sole population of cells .
this is a very good suggestion ; in fact , we did attempt co - localisation studies for p16 and sabg in primary cultures .
however , these assays use different , non - compatible fixation methods , which precluded further analysis .
specifically , sabg staining requires glutaraldehyde , methanol and formaldehyde fixation , which does not permit p16 immunocytochemistry ( icc ) .
conversely , fixation of cells for icc in 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0.2 % triton - x precluded sabg staining .
other fixation methods were equally unsuccessful .
2 ) when conducting withdrawal of camp mpa they see an increase in the senescent markers they should address if this is maintenance of senescence of cell death due to hormonal support .
we wish to point out that senescence markers do not rise but remain stable upon withdrawal of 8 - br - camp and mpa from primary cultures decidualized for 8 days ( figure 3h ) .
we reported previously a modest increase in cell death ( from 3.5 % to 7 %) in response to withdrawal of 8 - br - camp and mpa from decidual cultures ( labied et al. , 2006 ) .
the data infer that withdrawal of deciduogenic signals is insufficient to elicit significant cell death of senescent decidual cells .
3 ) there are multiple seemingly independent approaches that the authors piece together in the final analysis which would be greatly improved by a schematic diagram of what they think is going on based on the data presented .
thank you for this great suggestion .
a schematic diagram is included in the revised manuscript ( new figure 7 ) .

how do the authors know whether their observations are unique to women with abnormal reproductive outcomes ?
in subsection " patient recruitment and sample collection " , we expanded on the clinical presentation of participating patients as follows : ' the study cohort consisted of 942 women suffering recurrent miscarriage ( defined as 3 or more consecutive miscarriages ) , 349 patients with recurrent implantation failure ( define as 3 or more consecutive ivf failures ) , 139 women presenting with recurrent miscarriage following ivf treatment , and 681 other subjects , mostly women awaiting ivf treatment for a variety of reproductive disorders ' .
we wish to point out that the aim of the centile graphs is to highlight temporal and inter - patient variation , whereas cycle - to - cycle variation is illustrated in figure 6 and figure 6 - - figure supplement 1 .
importantly , there are no unequivocal criteria to define ' normal ' endometrium .
as outlined in the discussion section , implantation failure and miscarriage do not preclude a future successful pregnancy .
indeed , cumulative live birth rates are high for patients suffering recurrent miscarriage or repeated ivf failure .
parous women are often considered ' normal fertile controls ' , although this assumes that a successful pregnancy has no discernible impact on subsequent endometrial responses , which is contentious .
further , a successful pregnancy does not preclude secondary recurrent miscarriage or implantation failure .
our findings do suggest that lack of decidual senescence and / or unk hyperactivation may contribute to implantation failure whereas excessive decidual senescence and / or unk deficiency are predicted to predispose for miscarriage .
these hypotheses can only be tested rigorously in adequately powered , prospective clinicalstudies that link analysis of timed endometrial biopsies to subsequent pregnancy outcome .
such studies are planned .

1 data after immunization of two rabbits ( a and b ) with the peptide antigen , the antiserum harvested from the third bleed of rabbit b that was collected after the seventh booster , was found to be the most reactive compared to pre - immune serum ( fig. 1 ) .
western blots of total protein prepared from human cell lines with this antiserum resulted in the detection of ~ 52 kda band of gpr30 along with other non - specific proteins , which were also detected by pre - immune serum or secondary antibody alone ( fig. 2 , fig. 3 ) .
the affinity purified antibody obtained from the antiserum ( third bleed ) of rabbit b showed similar reactivity to that of the antiserum ( fig. 4 ) .
it produced clean western blotting results , in which , only one ~ 52 kda band of gpr30 was detected ( fig. 5 ) .
2 experimental design , materials and methods 2.1 experimental design rabbits were immunized with n - terminus peptide of human gpr30 and hyperimmune serum was collected after several boosters .
immunoreactivity of the immune serum was checked by indirect elisa and the antiserum with the highest reactivity was tested for the specificity by western blotting .
upon confirmation of specificity , immunoglobulins were affinity purified and reconfirmed by indirect elisa and western blotting .
2.2 materials and reagents plasticware for cell culture was from tarsons ( kolkata , india ) and greiner bio - one ( gmbh , germany ) .
phenol red - containing media ( dmem and rpmi - 1640 ) and fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) for cell culture were from gibco ( ny , usa ) .
radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( ripa ) buffer was purchased from sigma aldrich ( mo , usa ) and edta - free protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from takara ( ca , usa ) .
nitrocellulose membrane ( 0.45 micro ) used for western blotting was from genetix ( new delhi , india ) .
anti - beta - actin mouse polyclonal antibody was purchased from ambion ( cat. # am4302 ) .
antibiotics and trypsin - edta were purchased from himedia ( mumbai , india ) .
all other chemicals and buffers were from srl ( mumbai , india ) or merck ( mumbai , india ) .
2.3 generation of polyclonal antibody and affinity purification polyclonal antibody generation and peptide affinity purification was performed at abgenex pvt .
ltd. , bhubaneswar , india .
n - terminus peptide ( mdvtsqargvglemypgtaqpaa ) [ 1 ] of gpr30 was chemically synthesized with an extra cysteine residue at the c - terminus of the peptide .
the peptide was cross - linked to keyhole limpet haemocyanin ( klh , pierce , cat. # 77600 ) using maleimide - sulfhydryl chemistry .
klh was activated by treating with sulfosuccinimidyl 4 - ( n - maleimidomethyl ) cyclohexane - 1 - carboxylate ( sulfo - smcc , pierce , cat. # 22322 ) .
maleimide - activated klh was then purified by gel filtration chromatography and mixed with peptide for cross - linking .
efficiency of conjugation was assessed by determining the free sulfhydryl groups before and after conjugation using ellman 's reagent ( pierce , cat. # 22582 ) .
two rabbits ( a and b ) were immunized with antigen ( klh conjugated peptide ) in complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ) or incomplete freund 's adjuvant ( ifa ) after the collection of pre - immune serum .
the first immune serum was collected after primary immunization ( 200 microg antigen / rabbit in cfa ) and five boosters ( 100 microg antigen / rabbit in ifa ) .
subsequently , the next two batches ( second and third bleeds ) of immune sera were collected after 6th and 7th boosters , respectively .
first and third batches of immune sera were tested for immune reactivity by indirect elisa ( fig. 1 ) .
pre - immune serum served as negative control .
amongst the bleeds collected , the third bleed of rabbit b was found to be the most reactive ( fig. 1 ) .
the immune serum from third bleed of rabbit b detected the ~ 52 kda band of gpr30 ( fig. 2a ) which is consistent with other reports [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
several non - specific bands were also observed .
however , the non - specific bands were also detected on western blots probed only with the secondary antibody ( fig. 2b ) .
as shown in fig. 3a , a specific ~ 52 kda band of gpr30 was detected in breast cancer cell lines along with other non - specific bands which were also detected by the pre - immune serum ( fig. 3b ) .
this immune serum was affinity purified against the immunogenic peptide using the sulfo - link matrix .
immunoreactivity of the affinity purified antibody was confirmed by indirect elisa ( fig. 4 ) .
this antibody detected a single prominent ~ 52 kda gpr30 band against a much cleaner background on western blots of total proteins from breast cancer cell lines ( fig. 5 ) .
2.4 indirect elisa on day 1 , the peptide antigen ( 200ng / well ) was coated on a 96 - well plate ( nunc - immuno plate , cat .
# 439454 , f96 cert .
maxisorp ) for 2 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 degreesc .
on day 2 , the plates were kept on a shaker at room temperature for 2 h. the wells were then washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05 % tween 20 ( pbst ) , followed by blocking with 5 % skimmed milk in pbst for 1 h. after three washes with pbst , 100 mul per well of primary antibody ( diluted 1:5000 in pbst containing 1 % skimmed milk ) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature .
after 2 h the wells were washed as above .
100 mul of hrp - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:5000 diluted in pbst containing 1 % skimmed milk ) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. after three washes with pbst , 100 microl of 1x tmb / h2o2 solution was added and kept in dark for 3 - 5 min .
thereafter , the 96 - well plate was read at 450 nm .
2.5 cell culture mcf - 7 cell line was a kind gift from dr. dipak datta ( cdri , lucknow , india ) .
t47d and bt474 were gifted by dr. prathibha ranganathan ( chg , bangalore , india ) .
mda - mb - 231 cells were procured from nccs , pune , india .
mg11 and mz2 are derivatives of mda - mb - 231 generated in - house .
cell lines were cultured in a humidified co2 incubator maintained at 37 degreesc and 5 % co2 .
mcf - 7 and bt474 were cultured in dmem , and t47d , mdamb - 231 , mg11 and mz2 cells were cultured in rpmi - 1640 medium .
both the media contained phenol red and were supplemented with 10 % fbs , 100 u / ml penicillin , and 100 microg / ml streptomycin .
2.6 western blotting cells lysates were prepared in ice - cold ripa buffer with protease inhibitors .
lysates were collected in pre - chilled 1.5 ml tubes and incubated on ice for 15 min .
cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 15 min at 4 degreesc .
supernatants were stored as aliquots of 100 microl in 0.5 ml tubes at - 20 degreesc until use .
total protein was estimated by lowry 's method [ 4 ] .
30 microg of total protein was resolved by 10 % sds - page and transferred to 0.45 micro nitrocellulose membrane using semi - dry transfer method .
blotting was done either at constant current ( 140 ma ) or voltage ( 16 v ) for 80 min .
after the transfer , blots were stained with ponceau s and scanned .
ponceau s stain was removed by washing in pbs for 5 min followed by a 5 min wash with tris buffered saline containing 0.05 % tween 20 ( tbst ) .
the blots were then blocked in 1 % gelatin in tbst for 2 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 degreesc in 0.1 % gelatin in tbst .
next day , the blots were brought to room temperature and rinsed with tbst .
blots were then probed with primary antibody diluted in 0.1 % gelatin in tbst for 2 h at room temperature .
blots were washed for 30 min with tbst ( 3x10 min ) to remove unbound antibody .
blots were then incubated with hrp - tagged secondary antibody ( 1:5000 dilution in 0.1 % gelatin in tbst ) for 1 h followed by three tbst washes of 10 min each .
bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( santa cruz biotechnology , ca , usa ) .
chemidoc xrs + system ( biorad ) was used to capture the images .

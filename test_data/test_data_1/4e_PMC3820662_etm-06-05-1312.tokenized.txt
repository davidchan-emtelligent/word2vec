the aim of this study was to determine the effects of resistant starch 3 ( rs3 ) as a carrier for stachyose on dextran sulfate sodium ( dss ) - induced colitis in c57bl / 6 mice .
rs3 microspheres carrying stachyose ( rs3 + stachyose ) were produced and evaluated as a potentially improved colitis therapy for this study .
the body weights of the mice treated with rs3 + stachyose were higher compared with those of dss - treated control mice .
rs3 + stachyose reduced the levels of the serum pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 6 and tnf - alpha to a greater extent compared with the same concentration of stachyose combined with ordinary starch ( stachyose + starch ) .
histopathological examination of sections of colon tissues showed that the rs3 + stachyose group recovered well from colitis ; however , the tissue sections of the stachyose + starch group presented necrosis to a more serious degree .
these results suggest that stachyose with an rs3 carrier has better preventative effects on colitis than stachyose alone in mice .
resistant starch c57bl / 6 mice cytokine stachyose introduction resistant starch ( rs ) is the sum of starch and starch degradation products that are not absorbed in the small intestine since they are resistant to enzymatic digestion ( 1 ) .
rs3 is retrograded starch , formed on cooling in processed foods , including cooled cooked potato , bread and cornflakes ( 2 ) .
rs appears to have a number of physiological effects , including weight control , prevention of diabetes , lipid reduction and promotion of inorganic salt absorption ( 3 ) .
stachyose is a tetrasaccharide present in the tubers of the chinese artichoke ( 4 ) .
it is not decomposed by digestive enzymes and it will be changed in specific conditions when in direct contact with the intestinal tract ( 5 ) .
it increases probiotic activity ; intestinal flora become contained within the intestines , form a thick protective film against bacteria and stop the proliferation of toxins within the intestinal tract ( 6 ) .
stachyose also promotes intestinal peristalsis and accelerates the excretion of pathogens and toxins ( 7 ) .
ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the lining of the large intestine and rectum ( 8 ) .
the symptoms vary in severity and may start slowly or suddenly .
approximately half of patients have only mild symptoms .
others have more severe attacks that occur more frequently .
a number of factors lead to attacks , including respiratory infections or physical stress .
ulcerative colitis is one of the two main forms of chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract ( 9 ) ; the other form is crohn 's disease .
normally , the large intestine absorbs water from stools and changes them from a liquid to a solid .
in ulcerative colitis , inflammation causes loss of the lining of the colon , leading to bleeding , diarrhea and abdominal discomfort ( 10 ) .
cytokines may be centralized around this organ as it hosts cells that are highly susceptible to the action of these proteins .
cytokines , such as il - 6 and tnf - alpha , are small proteins that are produced and released from a number of cells under physiological and pathological conditions ( 11 ) .
il - 6 is increasingly recognized as an almost ubiquitous participant in numerous types of inflammatory processes ( 12 ) .
tnf - alpha is a macrophage - derived cytokine with chemotactic potency , which has been implicated in the acute phase reaction under various inflammatory conditions ( 13 ) .
in the present study , rs3 was used as a carrier for stachyose and its preventative effect on colitis was examined .
the levels of the inflammation - related cytokines il - 6 and tnf - alpha were used to determine the preventative effects on dextran sulfate sodium ( dss ) - induced colitis in mice .
colon tissue histology was also used to determine the preventative effects in vivo .
materials and methods chemicals rs3 was supplied by national starch ( sterling forest , ny , usa ) .
rs3 ( 7 g ) was added to 65 ml water , 0.4 g emulsifier ( sucrose esters of fatty acids , liuzhou gaotong food chemicals co. , ltd. , liuzhou , china ) , 100 ml soybean oil , 1.2 g crosslinking agent ( pocl3 ) and 0.6 g initiator ( cerium ammonium nitrate ) at ph 8 - 9 , 55degreesc .
the products were left to crosslink for 3 h , thereby producing the rs3 microspheres .
then , 0.05 g stachyose ( sigma , st louis , mo , usa ) was added at 37degreesc for 3 h static adsorption .
ethanol was used to wash and filter the stachyose rs3 microspheres .
ordinary starch ( cofco corporation chongqing company , chongqing , china ) was transformed into stachyose - containing starch using the same method .
mouse diets with a 15 % starch content were prepared from the two kinds of stachyose .
animals female c57bl / 6 mice ( n = 40 , 7 weeks old ) were purchased from the experimental animal center of chongqing medical university ( chongqing , china ) .
the mice were maintained in a temperature - controlled ( temperature , 25 +/ - 2degreesc ; relative humidity , 50 +/ - 5 %) facility with a 12 - h light / dark cycle and free access to a standard mouse chow diet and water .
dss - induced colitis model the mice were divided into four groups ( n = 10 each ) .
the normal group received a standard diet and water during the experimental period .
the mice in the rs3 + stachyose and starch + stachyose groups were fed with a mouse diet containing 15 % stachyose - containing rs3 and starch microspheres , respectively , for 2 weeks .
in the second week , ulcerative colitis was induced in the control and sample groups by providing water containing 5 % ( wt / wt ) dss ( molecular weight , 36,000 - 50,000 ; mp biomedicals , solon , oh , usa ) ad libitum for 7 days , as described previously ( 14 ) .
the body weight was recorded daily and the colon length was measured .
these experiments followed a protocol approved by the animal ethics committee of chongqing medical university ( chongqing , china ) .
analysis of inflammation - related cytokines in serum by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) for the serum cytokine assay , blood from the inferior vena cava was collected in a tube and centrifuged at 1,100 x g , 4degreesc for 10 min .
the serum was aspirated and assayed as described below .
concentrations of inflammatory - related cytokines il - 6 and tnf - alpha in serum were measured by elisa according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( biolegend , san diego , ca , usa ) .
briefly , biotinylated antibody reagent was added to 96 - well plates , then supernatants of homogenized serum were added and the plates were incubated at 37degreesc in co2 for 2 h. after washing with pbs , streptavidin - horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature .
the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader ( imark ; bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) ( 15 ) .
analysis of serum levels of superoxide dismutase ( sod ) for the blood biochemical assay , blood from the inferior vena cava was collected in a tube and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm , 4degreesc for 10 min .
the serum levels of sod were determined using a superoxide dismutase assay kit ( asan pharm. co. ltd. , seoul , south korea ) .
the kit contained all reagents required for determining sod activity in an indirect assay method based on xanthine oxidase ( xo ) and a color reagent that provides linearity of test results over a broad range .
briefly , the biotin - antibody reagent was added to 96 - well plates , the supernatants of homogenized colon tissue were added and the plates were incubated at 37degreesc in co2 for 1 h. after each well was aspirated and washed , hrp - avidin reagent was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37degreesc .
the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader .
histological examination at the end of the experimental period , the colon tissues were removed and cleaned in saline to remove fecal residue .
the colon tissues were fixed in 10 % ( v / v ) buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin .
then , 4 - mum - thick slices from paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) prior to microscopic observation .
histological analysis was conducted by a pathologist who was unaware of the experimental protocol .
statistical analysis data are presented as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
differences between the mean values for individual groups were assessed with one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with duncan 's multiple range test .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant differences .
sas version 9.1 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) was used for the statistical analyses .
results changes in body weight the normal mice had a normal diet and their body weights increased in the whole process of experiment .
the body weights of the control mice with dss - induced colitis were significantly decreased after 7 days .
as shown in fig. 1 , following the initiation of dss - induced colitis , the body weights of the mice in the rs3 + stachyose and starch + stachyose groups were significantly lower compared with those of the normal mice .
the mice in the rs3 + stachyose group had higher body weights than the mice in the starch + stachyose group ( p < 0.05 ) .
after 7 days , the body weight of rs3 + stachyose group and starch + stachyose group mice were higher than that of control group mice , and the body weight of the rs3 + stachyose group was higher than starch + stachyose group .
changes in colon length the total colonic length was significantly shorter in the dss - treated mice ( control group and sample treated group ) compared with the normal mice as shown in fig. 2 ( p < 0.05 ) .
the normal mice had the longest colon length at 8.2 +/ - 0.7 cm and the colon length of control mice was the shortest ( 5.6 +/ - 0.4 cm ) .
the total colonic length was longer in the rs3 + stachyose - treated mice ( 7.1 +/ - 0.6 cm ) than in the starch + stachyose - treated mice ( 6.4 +/ - 0.5 cm ) .
the significant shortening of the colonic length in dss - treated mice indicates that dss contributed to the process of edematous changes in the colon in dss - induced colitis .
effect of rs3 + stachyose on serum levels of il - 6 and tnf - alpha the il - 6 level of normal mice was 51.1 +/ - 2.7 pg / ml ; however , in control mice the il - 6 level was significantly increased to 238.6 +/ - 11.6 pg / ml. the levels of il - 6 in mice fed with rs3 + stachyose and starch + stachyose were 112.6 +/ - 10.6 and 168.4 +/ - 15.4 pg / ml , respectively ( fig. 3 ) .
the tnf - alpha levels in the normal , control , rs3 + stachyose - treated and starch + stachyose - treated mice were 108.6 +/ - 7.8 , 542.3 +/ - 16.3 , 298.4 +/ - 12.5 and 388.3 +/ - 17.7 pg / ml , respectively .
the serum il - 6 and tnf - alpha levels in the mice in the rs3 + stachyose - treated groups were significantly lower compared with those in the control and starch + stachyose groups .
effect of rs3 + stachyose on serum levels of sod the sod level of normal mice was 55.2 +/ - 6.3 u / ml and control mice demonstrated the lowest level at 31.6 +/ - 2.1 u / ml. the sod levels in the rs3 + stachyose - and starch + stachyose - treated mice increased to 42.8 +/ - 3.6 and 37.7 +/ - 3.2 u / ml , respectively ( fig. 4 ) .
effect of rs3 + stachyose on histological damage in the colon tissue of mice with dss - induced colitis after collecting colonic tissue samples , the severity of colitis was characterized by macroscopic examination of the colon and histological analysis of h & e stained colonic sections .
the inhibitory effects of the stachyose - containing microspheres on the dss - induced damage of the colon tissue are shown in fig. 5. h & e staining analysis indicated that the administration of dss markedly increased the severity of the colitis compared with that in the normal mice ( fig. 5b ) .
a typical lesion of the colon in the dss - treated group manifested multifocal areas , mucosal erosion , loss of epithelial and goblet cells , shortening and collapse of crypts , and submucosal edema .
rs3 + stachyose and starch + stachyose administration reduced the lesions of the colon in dss - induced colitis in the starch carrier technique - dependent manner , as shown in fig. 5c and d. the protective and healing effects of rs3 + stachyose on colon damage were more prominent ( fig. 5c ) .
discussion the most significant symptom in dss - induced colitis in mice is body weight loss ( 16 ) .
colon length may be measured to determine the severity of colitis .
changes in colon weight and colon length reflect the inflammatory status in mice with dss - induced colitis and also demonstrate which treatment has preventative effects against dss - induced colitis in mice ( 17 ) .
the serum il - 6 and tnf - alpha levels in patients with inflammatory diseases are higher compared with those in healthy individuals ( 18 ) .
lower levels of il - 6 and tnf - alpha are indicative of improved anti - inflammatory effects .
il - 6 acts as a pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokine .
il - 6 is secreted by t cells and macrophages to stimulate the immune response , particularly in tissue damage leading to inflammation .
il - 6 also plays a role in fighting infection ( 19 ) .
tnf - alpha is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction ( 20 ) .
il - 6 and tnf - alpha are key mediators in a number of experimental colitis models ( 21 ) .
sod is a protein that neutralizes free radicals .
this protein is an enzyme that inhibits or regulates a specific chemical or signaling action ( 22 ) ; specifically , it is one of the important anti - oxidative enzymes .
it catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen ( 23 ) .
the rate of the reduction of a superoxide anion is linearly related to the xo activity and is inhibited by sod .
therefore , the inhibitory activity of sod may be determined by a colorimetric method .
in normal body cells , sod protects the cytoplasmic structures from damage caused by free radicals ( 24 ) .
rs is not digested in the stomach .
it resists enzymatic decomposition and enters into the colon as a nutrient source for colonic bacteria. through fermentation , these microbes metabolize carbohydrates and generate short - chain fatty acids , including butyric acid .
butyric acid lowers the ph value of the colon and feces to promote colon health and prevent colitis ( 25 ) .
under the activation of stachyose , bacteria produce a large amount of short - chain fatty acids , which reduce intestinal ph and eh values , prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and promote intestinal peristalsis in order to accelerate the excretion of pathogenic bacteria and toxins .
stachyose itself decomposes immunity factors , including manninotriose and melibiose .
these factors induce the body to produce more endocrine immunoglobulin ( iga ) and thereby neutralize bioactive antigens such as viruses , toxins and pathogenic bacteria .
these factors have an extensive protective function ( 26 ) and improve immunity .
stachyose has a positive effect on reducing the intestinal ph value , adjusting the intestinal micro - ecological balance , inhibiting the metabolism of pathogenic and spoilage organisms , promoting intestinal peristalsis and immunity , and curing enteritis ( 5 ) .
in the present study , mice consumed a mouse diet that included rs3 and stachyose .
stachyose combined with rs3 is not absorbed in the stomach .
after it enters into the colon , rs3 is broken down by the intestinal bacteria and stachyose is released .
this is advantageous to the proliferation of intestinal probiotics and has the effect of preventing colitis. by contrast , large amounts of ordinary starch are decomposed by enzymes prior to entering the colon ; therefore , stachyose is only partly absorbed in the colon , which reduces its efficacy .
as indicated by the experimental results , combining rs3 with stachyose enables the full efficacy of stachyose to be utilized .
compared with the direct use of stachyose , this method produces better preventative effects against colitis .

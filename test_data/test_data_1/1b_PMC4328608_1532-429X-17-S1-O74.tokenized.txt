we investigated whether native t1 mapping at 3t can be used to detect and characterize cmis in patients with prior stemi and nstemi .
methods breath - held 2d native t1 maps ( 8 tis with 2 look - locker cycles of 3 + 5 images ; minimum ti = 120ms ; ti increment = 80 ms ; flip angle = 35degrees ; bandwidth = 1085 hz / pixel ; voxel size = 1.5x1.5x8mm3 ) and lge images ( ir - prepared flash ; optimal ti to null remote myocardium ; tr / te = 6.54 / 3.27ms ; flip angle = 20degrees ; bandwidth = 460 hz / pixel ; voxel size = 1.2x1.2x8mm3 ) were acquired in patients with prior stemi ( n = 15 ) and nstemi ( n = 17 ) at 3t at a median of 13.6 years after acute mi. cmi location , size and transmurality were determined using mean + 5sd criterion relative to remote myocardium .
visual detection of cmi territories on lge images and t1 maps were assessed by two independent reviewers .
results representative native t1 maps and lge images from two patients , one with prior stemi , and one with prior nstemi are shown in fig. 1. relative to remote myocardium , median t1 of the cmi was 271ms higher in stemi patients ( infarct : 1517ms ; remote : 1247ms ; p < 0.001 ; fig. 1 ) , and 229ms higher in nstemi patients ( infarct : 1549ms , remote : 1262ms ; p < 0.001 ; fig. 1 ) .
median percentage change in lge signal intensity ( lge - si ) of the cmi relative to remote myocardium was significantly higher than that of percentage change in t1 in both stemi ( lge : 465 % , t1 : 21 % ; p < 0.001 ) and nstemi ( lge : 441 % , t1 : 20 % ; p < 0.001 ) patients .
median cnr of lge images was also 2.5 - fold higher relative to that of t1 maps in both stemi ( lge : 23.1 ; t1 : 9.2 ; p < 0.001 ) and nstemi ( lge : 25.3 ; t1 : 9.7 ; p < 0.001 ) patients .
lge images and native t1 maps were not different for measuring cmi size ( stemi - lge : 13.8 % ; t1 : 14.9 % ; p = 0.87 ; nstemi - lge : 10.9 % ; t1 : 10.5 % ; p = 0.93 ; fig. 2 ) and transmurality ( stemi - lge : 55.6 % ; t1 : 60.1 % ; p = 0.19 ; nstemi - lge : 64.3 % ; t1 : 60.9 % ; p = 0.24 ) .
statistical analyses showed good agreement between lge images and t1 maps for measuring cmi size ( stemi : bias = - 0.4 +/ - 2.1 % ; r2 = 0.97 ; nstemi : bias = - 1.1 +/ - 3.9 % ; r2 = 0.87 ) and transmurality ( stemi : bias = 1.5 +/ - 2.9 % ; r2 = 0.99 ; nstemi : bias = - 2.2 +/ - 7.4 % ; r2 = 0.71 ) .
sensitivity and specificity of native t1 maps for detecting cmis based on threshold criterion were 93 % and 97 % respectively ( stemi ) ; and 93 % and 92 % respectively ( nstemi ) .
sensitivity and specificity of native t1 maps for visual detection of cmi were : 61 % and 85 % ( stemi ) ; and 67 % and 90 % ( nstemi ) .
figure 1 representative native t1 maps and lge images from a patient with prior stemi ( infarct age = 18.5 years ) and nstemi ( infarct age = 25.6 years ) are shown .
significant t1 elevations could be observed within the infarcted regions detected on lge images ( arrows ) .
good visual agreement was observed between the two techniques in terms of the location and spatial extent of the infarct .
median native t1 of the infarct was significantly elevated in both stemi and nstemi patients .
percentage change in lge signal intensity and infarct - to - remote cnr was significantly in lge images were significantly higher than that of t1 maps .
figure 2 native t1 maps and lge images were not different for measuring chronic infarct size and transmurality in both stemi and nstemi patients .
bland - altman and linear regression analyses further showed good agreement for measuring infarct size and transmurality .
conclusions native t1 maps can reliably detect and characterize cmis in stemi and nstemi patients when the location of remote myocardium is known .
further increase in image contrast may be necessary to improve visual detection sensitivity of chronic mi territories to the levels observed with lge .

intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( icam1 ) is crucial to the development and progression of atherosclerosis .
recent genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) have revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in two of the nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) pathway genes , nfkbik and rela , are associated with soluble icam1 ( sicam1 ) levels .
however , neither of these two gene variants is found in the asian populations .
this study aimed to elucidate whether other candidate gene variants involved in the nf - kappab pathway may be associated with sicam1 levels in taiwanese .
after excluding carriers of the icam1 rs5491 - t allele , three snps in the icam1 gene and eight snps in six of the nf - kappab pathway genes ( nfkb1 , pdcd11 , tnfaip3 , nkapl , ikbke , and prkcb ) were analyzed for their association with sicam1 levels in 480 individuals .
our data showed that two snps , rs5498 of icam1 and rs1635 of nkapl , were significantly associated with sicam1 levels ( p = 0.002 and 0.004 , respectively ) in the taiwanese population .
using a multivariate analysis , rs5498 and rs1635 as well as the previously reported abo genotypes and rs12051272 of the cdh13 gene were independently associated with sicam1 levels ( p = 0.001 , 0.001 , 0.006 and 0.031 , respectively ) .
an analysis with combined risk alleles of four candidate snps in the icam1 , nkapl , abo , and cdh13 genes showed an increase in sicam1 levels with added numbers of risk alleles and weighted genetic risk score .
our findings thus expanded the repertoire of gene variants responsible for the regulation of sicam1 levels in the asian populations .

introduction icam1 is an adhesive molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is regulated by the proinflammatory cytokines and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis [ 1 ] .
apart from atherosclerosis , elevated plasma sicam1 levels were observed in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction , and they served as indications for an increased risk of ischemic stroke , myocardial infarction , and future coronary events in both healthy individuals and patients with coronary heart disease [ 2 - 5 ] .
a study of the framingham cohort has shown a cumulative effect on plasma sicam1 levels exerted by quantitative combination of a number of clinical risk factors , suggestive of a multitude of physiological control over icam1 protein expression and its post - translational processing [ 6 ] .
in addition to physiological regulations , a 24 % residual heritability of sicam1was found in the framingham cohort [ 6 ] , which provided one of the earliest evidence of the genetic regulation of sicam1 concentration .
several studies subsequently narrowed down the genetic determinants of circulating sicam1 levels to the icam cluster on chromosome 19 with a heritability estimate from 0.34 to 0.59 [ 7 , 8 ] , and many single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in the vicinity of the icam1 locus were identified to associate with sicam1 levels [ 7 , 9 - 11 ] .
we have previously reported that the icam1 snp rs5491 was associated with sicam1 levels and metabolic syndrome in a taiwanese population [ 12 ] .
this snp , also named icam1kilifi ( rs5491 ) , lies in a loop close to the n - terminus of the icam1 protein critical to its binding to the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum , human rhinovirus , lymphocyte function - associated antigen - 1 ( lfa - 1 ) , and fibrinogen [ 13 - 15 ] , and is likely a result of evolutionary adaptation .
unfortunately , the rs5491 - t allele creates a non - synonymous lysine - to - methionine substitution that was known to interfere with binding of an icam1 epitope to several monoclonal antibodies used in conventional protein assays [ 16 ] .
therefore , the presence of this allele might confound interpretation of our previous results .
numerous efforts have been made toward identifying novel genetic regulators for sicam1 levels .
for instance , variants of the abo and cdh13 genes ( which encode the abo histo - blood group antigen and glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored cadherin 13 , respectively ) were reported to associate with sicam1 levels [ 10 , 17 , 18 ] .
recently , a gwas identified and localized the genetic determinants of sicam1 levels to several loci in the genome , including two snps , rs3136642 and rs1049728 , in the nfkbik and rela genes which function in the nf - kappab pathway [ 11 ] .
this is interesting because in the cardiovascular system , icam1 expression in the endothelial cells is known to be upregulated by various extracellular signals like tumor necrosis factor - alpha and thrombin , and the majority of these signals lead to activation of nf - kappab [ 19 ] .
noticeably , the promoter region of icam1 contains two nf - kappab binding sites , which are - 533 and - 223 bases from translational start site .
it has been shown by site - directed mutagenesis and gel shift assays that rela / p65 binds to the downstream site to activate icam1 transcription [ 20 ] .
since sicam1 expressed by endothelial cells greatly facilitates transendothelial migration of leukocytes [ 19 ] , studying the relation between nf - kappab pathway activation and icam1expression thus allows us to identify key players in this inflammatory process .
however , neither of these snps ( rs3136642 and rs1049728 ) is present in the asian populations .
the nf - kappab family transcription factors are central regulators of a variety of genes which are essential to processes like inflammation , immunity , cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival [ 21 ] .
the nf - kappab transcription factors are distinct homo - or heterodimers formed by the combination of rela ( p65 ; a product of the rela gene ) , relb , c - rel , nf - kappab1 ( p105 / p50 ; encoded by the nfkb1 gene ) , and nf - kappab2 ( p100 / p52 ) proteins .
at its simplest , the nf - kappab dimer is normally localized in the cytoplasm , where it is kept inactive by the ikappab family of inhibitors .
upon signal transduction following extracellular stimuli , ikappab is quickly phosphorylated by the ikappab kinase ( ikk ) complexes and degraded , and the nf - kappab dimer translocates into the nucleus to function as a transcriptional activator or repressor for downstream genes [ 21 ] .
on top of these core members of the nf - kappab pathway , additional proteins participate in different steps of the nf - kappab signal transduction , and many snps of these nf - kappab pathway genes have been reported to associate with inflammation - related autoimmune diseases .
for example , protein kinase c - beta , encoded by the prkcb gene , recruits ikk into lipid rafts and is involved in b - cell receptor ( bcr ) - mediated nf - kappab activation , and the snp rs16972959 was shown to associate with systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) in a han chinese population [ 22 ] .
polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor - alpha - induced protein 3 ( tnfaip3 ) , a negative regulator of nf - kappab activation , were also found to associate with sle [ 23 ] .
moreover , suggestive associations were found between a snp of the nfkb1 gene and primary sjogren 's syndrome [ 24 ] , and between snps of the ikbke gene ( encoding the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b - cells , kinase epsilon ; a noncanonical ikk ) and rheumatoid arthritis [ 25 ] .
it remains unclear if any of these snps is associated with sicam1 levels in the taiwanese population .
in order to further characterize the genetic determinants of sicam1 levels in taiwanese , we excluded carriers of the rs5491 - t allele and tested the relationship between a panel of eleven snps in icam1 and selected nf - kappab pathway genes and circulating sicam1 levels in 480 individuals .
materials and methods subjects all of the participants responded to a questionnaire on their medical history and lifestyle characteristics , and were recruited during routine health examinations between october 2003 and september 2005 at the chang gung memorial hospital .
they underwent physical examinations in which height , weight , waist and hip circumferences , and blood pressure ( bp ) in the sitting position after 15 min of rest were measured .
fasting blood samples were obtained from each subject .
exclusion criteria included a history of myocardial infarction , stroke or transient ischemic attack , cancer , and current renal or liver disease .
after 617 individuals were initially recruited , we additionally excluded those who took regular medications for diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and lipid - lowering drugs ( 8 , 6 , and 60 individuals , respectively ) , aged < 18 years ( 5 individuals ) , and carried the icam1 rs5491 - t alleles ( 58 individuals ) .
at the end , 480 taiwanese subjects of han chinese origin ( 242 men , mean age : 43.6 +/ - 9.5 years ; 238 women , mean age : 45.9 +/ - 9.5 years ) were enrolled for analyses .
obesity was defined as a body mass index ( bmi ) >= 25 kg / m2 according to the asian criteria [ 26 ] .
current smokers were defined as those who smoked regularly at the time of survey .
all subjects provided written informed consent .
the study was approved by the ethics committee of the tzu - chi memorial hospital ( irb number : 04 - xd01 - 001 ) .

genomic dna extraction and genotyping genomic dna was extracted as previously reported. by candidate gene approaches , in addition to the icam1 gene , nf - kappab pathway genes that have been previously found to be associated with inflammation - related autoimmune diseases in genetic associated studies were also selected for analysis .
oligonucleotides were generated to amplify genomic dna fragments encompassing the snps of interest according to the ncbi snp database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / snp ) .
in addition to icam1 rs5491 , ten snps in the icam1 and the nf - kappab pathway genes associated with sicam1 's transcript and protein levels were selected for genotyping ( table 2 ) .
four snps in the vicinity of the icam1 loci were selected based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) the most significant snps associated with icam1 levels in previous reports [ 7 , 27 ] ; ( 2 ) compatibility with taqman assays ; ( 3 ) cis - expression quantitative trait loci ( cis - eqtl ) effect in whole blood cells in the gtex database ( http :// www.gtexportal.org ) ; ( 4 ) a threshold of minor allele frequency ( maf ) >= 0.10 according to the chinese ( chb ) genotype data from hapmap ( http :// www.hapmap.org /) .

laboratory examinations and assays medical history and blood samples were obtained as previously reported [ 28 ] .
the levels of most markers , including serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) , serum amyloid a ( saa ) , sicam1 , soluble vascular cell adhesive molecule ( svcam1 ) , soluble e - selectin ( se - selectin ) , matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( mmp - 2 ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( mmp - 9 ) , were measured using a sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) developed in - house ( s1 materials and methods ) .
the levels of circulating plasma matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( mmp - 1 ) , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( mcp - 1 ) , soluble p - selectin ( sp - selectin ) , and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor ii ( stnfrii ) were measured using commercially available elisa kits from r & d ( minneapolis , mn , usa ) .
the mean intra - assay cvs from serum specimens were 7.1 , 8.5 , 2.1 , 4.2 , 4.1 , 6.1 , and 7.1 % , and the mean inter - assay cvs were 9.5 , 8.1 , 3.8 , 6.8 , 3.4 , 8.8 , and 9.1 % for crp , saa , sicam1 , svcam1 , se - selectin , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 levels , respectively .
the mean intra - assay cvs from plasma specimens were 3.8 , 3.0 , 2.2 , 3.1 , and 5.5 % , and the mean inter - assay cvs were 5.7 , 8.8 , 4.1 , 4.5 , and 8.2 % for mcp - 1 , sp - selectin , stnfrii , and mmp - 1 levels , respectively .
statistical analyses the chi - square test was used to compare categorical variables of smoking status , hypertension , and diabetes mellitus .
the clinical characteristics of the continuous variables were expressed as means +/ - sd and tested using two - sample t - test or analysis of variance ( anova ) .
pearson and partial correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between sicam1 levels and clinical and biochemical factors .
a generalized linear model was used to analyze levels of sicam1 in relation to predictors of the investigated genotypes and confounders .
additive models were used for numeric association tests after recoding our snps from categorical variables to continuous variables , such as 0 , 1 and 2 of a particular allele .
the bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons where applicable .
the genetic risk scores were created using two methods : a simple count method ( genetic risk allele : gra ) and a weighted method ( genetic risk score : grs ) [ 29 , 30 ] .
both methods assumed each snp to be independently associated with sicam1 levels ( i.e. , no interaction between snps ) .
we assumed an additive effect of risk alleles for each snp , and applied linear weighting of 0 , 1 , or 2 to genotypes containing corresponding number of risk alleles .
the count model assumed each snp in the panel contributed equally to sicam1 levels , and the gra was calculated by summing up values for each snp .
the weighted grs was calculated by multiplying the estimated beta - coefficient of each snp by the number of corresponding risk alleles ( 0 , 1 , or 2 ) .
the values of crp , saa , sicam1 , svcam1 , se - selectin , sp - selectin , mmp - 1 , mmp - 2 , mmp - 9 , mcp - 1 , and stnfrii levels were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analyses to adhere to a normality assumption .
p < 0.05 , obtained using two - sided tests , was considered statistically significant .
in addition , stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of sicam1 levels .
associations between genotype score and plasma levels of sicam1 was calculated using linear regression .
deviation from the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) and the linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms were investigated using golden helix svs win32 7.3.1 ( golden helix ) .
results subject characteristics we excluded carriers of the rs5491 - t allele prior to all statistical analyses .
table 1 summarizes the demographic features , clinical profile , and values of a panel of inflammation markers of the study participants stratified by sex .
the male subjects had higher bmi and levels of se - selectin , sp - selectin , mmp - 9 , mcp - 1 , and stnfrii , and a significant portion of them were current smokers ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , female subjects were slightly older and had significantly higher mmp - 2 levels ( p < 0.05 ) .
associations between sicam1 levels and cardiovascular risk factors unadjusted and age , sex , bmi , and smoking status - adjusted correlation coefficients between sicam1 levels and measured cardiovascular risk factors are shown in table 3 .
we found significant and positive correlations between sicam1 levels and levels of crp , se - selectin , sp - selectin , svcam1 , stnfrii , mmp - 9 , and fasting serum insulin , and negative correlations between sicam1 levels and hdl - cholesterol and adiponectin levels ( p < 0.01 ) .
a positive correlation between sicam1 levels and the homa - ir index was also found ( p < 0.01 ) .

associations between sicam1 levels and various snps of the candidate genes we genotyped a panel of snps in icam1 and several nf - kappab pathway genes involved in chronic inflammation , and tested the associations between these snps and sicam1 levels ( table 2 ) .
these snps included rs5496 , rs5498 , and rs281432 of icam1 , rs28720239 of nfkb1 , rs2230926 of tnfaip3 , rs12142086 of ikbke , and rs16972959 of prkcb .
our data showed that sicam1 levels were associated with rs5498 of icam1 ( p = 0.002 ) , thus corroborating the previous findings regarding the self - regulation of icam1 protein expression .
however , we failed to detect any significant association between snps in the above nf - kappab pathway genes and sicam1 levels .
we then tested the associations between sicam1 levels and additional four snps : rs2271751 , rs7894407 , and rs7089271 of pdcd11 ( program cell death 11 ) , and rs1635 of nkapl ( nf - kappab activating protein - like ) .
pdcd11 is a nfkb1 - binding protein responsible for the biogenesis of rrna , and nkapl is a paralogue of the nf - kappab activating protein nkap .
our data revealed that only rs1635 of nkapl was significantly associated with sicam1 levels ( p = 0.004 ) .
the differences remained significant even after the use of stringent bonferroni correction for multiple tests ( p = 0.020 and p = 0.040 , for rs5498 and rs1635 , respectively ) .
we also searched in the gtex database for snps that had cis - eqtl effect on icam1 ( s2 table ) .
the snp rs192560669 was genotyped in 100 subjects but the maf was zero .
likewise , based on the chb genotype data from hapmap , the maf of rs192560669 was also zero .
we then selected rs281438 which has a maf >= 0.10 in the asian populations , and strong linkage with both rs281436 and rs281437 .
our association analysis showed that after adjusting for age , sex , bmi , and smoking status , rs281438 remained modestly associated with sicam1 ( p = 0.043 ) in a recessive model ( data not shown ) .
since rs281438 had strong linkage with rs281437 according to the gtex database , our result thus tentatively lent support to a previous finding by bielinski et al. on the association between rs281437 and sicam1 levels [ 7 ] .
the association between rs281438 and sicam1 levels became insignificant after bonferroni correction , however .
stepwise regression and risk allele analyses of sicam1 levels we next studied the effects of various risk variables on sicam1 levels using stepwise linear regression adjusted for sex , age , bmi , smoking status , and the abo histo - blood group genotypes ( non - o and o ) that were previously shown to affect sicam1 levels ( table 4 ) .
these risk variables included the smoking status , age , the abo histo - blood group genotypes , rs12051272 of cdh13 , rs5498 of icam1 , and rs1635 of nkapl .
our data showed that rs5498 of icam1 , rs1635 of nkapl , the abo genotypes , and rs12051272 of cdh13 all independently associated with sicam1 levels ( p = 0.001 , 0.001 , 0.006 , and 0.031 , respectively ) .
we then quantified the effects of a combination of risk alleles of four snps on sicam1 levels .
the snps used in this analysis were rs5498 of icam1 , rs1635 of nkapl , rs12051272 of cdh13 , and non - o of abo genotype .
our data revealed that sicam1 levels increased significantly with increasing number of risk alleles in both the gra and the grs models ( fig 1 , p = 9.13 x 10 - 9 for gra and p = 2.57 x 10 - 8 for grs , respectively ) ( fig 1 ) .

the associated results were presented as gra model ( a ) and grs model ( b ) .
( a ) the sicam1 levels ( mean +/ - sd ) of subjects carrying various number of risk alleles were as follows : no risk allele ( 4.7 % of the population ) : 207.8 +/ - 80.9 mg / dl ; one risk allele ( 35.3 % of the population ) : 219.5 +/ - 69.3 mg / dl ; two risk alleles ( 41.2 % of the population ) : 261.8 +/ - 114.1 mg / dl ; three risk alleles ( 17.3 % of the population ) : 273.9 +/ - 130.0 mg / dl ; four risk alleles ( 1.5 % of the population ) : 417.9 +/ - 332.8 mg / dl ; p = 9.13 x 10 - 9 after adjusting for age , sex , bmi , and smoking status .
( b ) the sicam1 levels ( mean +/ - sd ) were calculated for each quartile of the grs as follows : grs = 0 ( 4.7 % of the population ) : 207.8 +/ - 80.9 mg / dl ; first quartile ( 35.3 % of the population ) : 219.5 +/ - 69.3 mg / dl ; second quartile ( 22.0 % of the population ) : 259.6 +/ - 103.9 mg / dl ; third quartile ( 16.7 % of the population ) : 256.4 +/ - 99.7mg / dl ; fourth quartile ( 21.4 % of the population ) : 288.9 +/ - 166.8 mg / dl ; p = 2.57 x 10 - 8 after adjusting for age , sex , bmi , and smoking status .
discussion this study analyzed the association between variants of icam1 and selected nf - kappab pathway genes and circulating sicam1 levels in a taiwanese population .
our data revealed that two snps , rs5498 of icam1 and rs1635 of nkapl , were significantly associated with sicam1 levels .
we found while sicam1 levels were positively associated with age , homa - ir index , and circulating levels of crp , se - selectin , sp - selectin , svcam1 , stnfrii , mmp - 9 , and fasting serum insulin , they were negatively associated with levels of hdl - cholesterol and adiponectin .
using multivariate analyses , our data showed that rs5498 of icam1 , rs1635 of nkapl , the abo genotypes , and rs12051272 of cdh13 were all independently associated with sicam1 levels .
finally , from our analysis of the effect of a combination of risk alleles of four snps on sicam1 levels , we showed that sicam1 levels increased significantly with increasing number of risk alleles .
these results will certainly enrich our understanding of icam1 's involvement in cardiovascular atherosclerosis .
the snp rs1635 of the nkapl gene encodes a threonine - to - glutamine substitution at amino acid 152 in exon 1 of nkapl , and was previously shown to associate with schizophrenia in separate han chinese populations [ 31 - 33 ] .
although nkapl was found to be expressed in the brain in postnatal day 0 mice [ 33 ] , it was still elusive regarding how a structural change in the nkapl protein caused malfunction in the nervous system in humans , and no indication of its involvement in inflammation was provided .
the rs1635 mutation might alter protein folding , protein - protein interaction , or protein expression and subcellular localization and contribute to the phenotype ( i.e. , sicam1 levels ) we observed in this study .
indeed , when we carried out in silico analysis using mutationassesor ( http :// mutationassesor.org ) [ 34 ] , we did find medium functional impact of the t152n mutation .
moreover , according to the hapmap database ( release # 24 , chb ) , rs1635 is in linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) with another nkapl snp rs12000 which is a missense mutation linked to schizophrenia [ 31 , 32 ] .
according to these previous studies and our own in silico finding , the combination of these two missense mutations can possibly alter nkapl protein structure synergistically , which may partially explain the defects in neuronal wiring and central nervous system development seen in the schizophrenia patients .
interestingly , the t152n mutation of rs11635 and the y96c mutation of rs12000 potentially disrupt an agc / grk / bark / bark1 and an abl phosphorylation site ( score = 30.786 , cutoff = 7.635 and score = 6.055 , cutoff = 2.697 , respectively ) based on online predictions ( http :// gps.biocuckoo.org ) .
these results suggested that the rs1635 mutation might possibly generate gain - , switch - , or loss - of - function of a domain of the nkapl protein .
recently , a knock - out mice study has found that nkapl , like its paralogue and ancestral form nkap from which it was derived , functions as a transcriptional corepressor of the notch signaling pathway [ 35 ] .
unlike nkap , it was found to be specifically expressed in the testes and possibly required for the self - renewal - differentiation balance of the spermatogonial stem cells .
since the authors did not provide a detailed temporal expression profile of nkapl using either qrt - pcr or whole - mount in situ hybridization , it might be possible that it is expressed in tissues other than the testes in adulthood , and its role in the cardiovascular system may be overlooked .
the discovery of its involvement in notch signal transduction is particularly intriguing because the notch - nf - kappab signaling axis has been clearly demonstrated in the inflammatory and myeloproliferating processes in the bone marrow stromal environment [ 36 ] .
it is reasonable to hypothesize that the nkapl protein is kept at a low level in the endothelial cells of the cardiovascular system to restrain notch signaling , and its dysregulation activates the nf - kappab pathway which ultimately leads to cleavage and release of icam1 into the blood stream .
future research is needed to study whether nkapl participates in this scenario , whether it represses the transcription of any nf - kappab signaling activator , and whether its gain - or loss - of - function leads to nf - kappab - dependent inflammatory responses in the cardiovascular environment ( e.g. cytokine and sicam1 production ) .
in addition to its association with sicam1 levels , the icam1 snp rs5498 has been shown to associate with a plethora of diseases in asians including diabetic microvascular complications [ 37 ] , proliferative diabetic retinopathy [ 38 ] , oral carcinogenesis [ 39 ] , migraine [ 40 ] , and coronary atherosclerosis [ 41 ] .
because rs5498 encodes a lysine - to - glutamic acid mutation at position 469 ( k469e ) which alters the electrostatic property of the binding site for icam1 's ligand lfa - 1 [ 42 ] , it is likely that changes in icam1 's affinity to lfa - 1 contribute to the inflammation - related diseases .
however , a recent study using atomic force microscopy did not find any difference in single - molecule adhesion ability between the k469 and the e469 isoforms [ 43 ] .
instead , the icam1 isoform containing g241 and e469 was expressed at a significantly higher level than that of the other isoforms .
the g241r mutation of icam1 , encoded by the snp rs1799969 , is located in the binding domain for the macrophage - 1 antigen [ 42 ] .
therefore , these data suggest that the susceptibility of rs5498 to diseases possibly lies in differential icam1 protein expression rather than differential lfa - 1 binding , and the differential protein expression is dependent on specific residues at both the lfa - 1 and mac - 1 binding sites .
furthermore , since production of sicam1 has been attributed to a consensus mmp - 9 cleavage site ( the p - x - x - hy - t motif where x is any and hy is a hydrophobic residue ) at position 404 - 408 n - terminal to the transmembrane domain of icam1 [ 44 ] , the rs5498 mutation possibly does not alter the susceptibility of icam1 to proteolytic cleavage .
based on the above evidence , the difference in circulating sicam1 concentration seen in rs5498 carriers in our study is thus likely a consequence of a difference in the amount of icam1 expressed in the endothelial cells and the other tissues .
in recent years , a number of approaches have been proposed to address the inadequacy of traditional association studies , which are often limited in their scope and ability to detect genetic variants that may be potentially relevant to cardiovascular diseases .
one type of approach , pathway analysis and related techniques , has become an essential tool for discovering key genetic components of cardiovascular diseases from large - scale gwas data .
for example , statistical techniques like gene set analysis or gene set enrichment analysis have been applied to gwas datasets to uncover significant kegg ( kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ) pathways for dilated cardiomyopathy and calcific aortic valve disease [ 45 , 46 ] .
another approach , which is slightly different but nonetheless cogent , uses previously - published data of cardiovascular disease - related genes to query the snp database .
the selected snps are then either used to build gene - centric chips or scored directly for associations [ 47 , 48 ] .
in this study , we took a similar candidate snp approach and discovered a new player in the nf - kappab pathway previously unknown to affect circulating sicam1 concentration .
our results therefore suggest that pathway - informed candidate gene approach can be a handy tool to complement traditional association studies , and it vigorously accelerates the discovery of disease - relevant genes .
in this study we also demonstrated the use of both the unweighted and weighted genetic risk score ( gra and grs , respectively ) of selected snp alleles in directly predicting the sicam1 levels .
previously , the grs has been extensively used to discover the underlying genetic architecture of disease traits .
for instance , by informed selection of relevant snps according to the results of gwas and other association studies , it has been used to predict the risks of gestational diabetes mellitus , newborn adiposity , and hypertension in different populations [ 49 , 50 ] .
different grss were also constructed to show associations with various lipid traits and levels of crp [ 51 , 52 ] .
our study provided another example of the application of the grs in predicting biomarker levels which might in turn point to the severity of inflammatory diseases .
further studies will be required to determine if the grs can also be used in prognosis of long - term cardiovascular adverse events in our sample population .
conclusion our data suggested that most of the nf - kappab pathway gene variants analyzed in our hands were not associated with sicam1 levels .
nevertheless , with the finding of the association of nkapl rs1635 with sicam1 levels , it might be possible to uncover more variants of the nf - kappab pathway genes that influence sicam1 levels in taiwanese in the future .
limitations one limitation of this study is the relatively low number of subjects genotyped ; replication of the current results in a second cohort would support the strength of the study .
independent association studies with larger sample size and functional data are required to confirm our results before any definitive conclusions can be drawn .
another limitation is the study 's cross - sectional design , which means that the results may be used to draw only limited inference regarding the relationship between exposure and outcome .
our study design and snp selection criteria may not be comprehensive .
while some snps were not included into this study , our conclusion may be biased towards emphasizing the importance of certain members of the nf - kappab pathway .

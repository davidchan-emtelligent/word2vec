objective : to develop topical gel preparations of astemizole and terfenadine and to investigate the actions of the gels on the healing of incision and excision wounds in male albino rats .
materials and methods : gels containing 1 % astemizole , with varying concentrations of carbopol 934 ( polymer ) , were prepared .
similarly , 1 % terfenadine gels were made .
the formulations were evaluated for release rate and stability .
incision and excision wounds were inflicted on male albino rats under ketamine anesthesia , taking aseptic precautions .
the animals were divided into two groups .
they were given a topical application of either astemizole or terfenadine gel , at a dose of 100 mg per wound , once daily , for 10 days in the case of incision wounds and till the time of complete closure in the case of excision wounds .
on the 11th day , breaking strength of the incision wound was measured .
in the excision wound model , wound closure rate , epithelization time , scar features and hydroxyproline content of scar tissue were studied from the day of wounding till the day of the scab falling off , with no residual raw area .
results : gels prepared using 0.8 % carbopol 934 and 1 % of drug in gel base were found to be stable .
the gels of astemizole and terfenadine significantly ( p < 0.05 ) promoted the phases of healing such as collagenation ( in incision wounds ) , wound contraction and epithelization ( in excision wounds ) .
conclusion : the gels of astemizole and terfenadine might play an important role in wound management program .
astemizole breaking - strength epithelization terfenadine wound healing introduction wound healing is a complex and complicated process .
it runs through a number of phases , which either run concurrently or are intimately interlinked through some chemical , biochemical and cellular pathways .
a treatment could influence the healing of wound by intervening in any one or many phases of healing .
no treatment , either systemic or local , could be considered inert on healing process ,[ 1 ] unless it is proved experimentally .
histamine is one of the mediators of acute inflammation .
the exact contribution of histamine to repair the process of a wound is difficult to ascertain .
however , histamine causes itching in the healing wound and the healed wound ( scar ) .
if itching is not contained in the healing wound , it may hamper the healing process or may cause damage to the scar .
doxepin , an antidepressant having anti - histaminic activity , upon topical use , has been shown to reduce the itching in burn wound and scars. [ 2 ] however , its influence on healing has not been studied .
thus , it is interesting to study the influence of topical antihistaminics on healing .
astemizole and terfenadine were among the first nonsedating antihistaminic drugs to be introduced for therapeutic use .
subsequently their cardiac toxicity , e.g. ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes was discovered when they were given systemically , in high doses and in combination with cyp3a4 inhibitors .
the occurrence of many such cases of cardiac toxicity led to a drastic reduction in their use .
no attempt has so far been made to discover their topical utility , particularly in wound healing .
thus , the present work was aimed at studying a new use of these drugs in a new dosage form .
the study was , therefore , conducted on the healing of incision and excision wounds , using the gel preparations of terfenadine and astemizole .
materials and methods preparation of gels [ 3 ] formulation : gels containing 1 % of astemizole / terfenadine , with varying concentrations of carbopol ( 0.6 % , 0.8 % and 1.0 %) were prepared .
the gels were tested for stability , content uniformity and in vitro release through excised mouse skin .
gels containing 0.8 % carbopol 934 and 1 % of drug in gel base were finally selected for wound healing studies , as these were found to be more stable and had good release rates than the others .
the compositions of these gels are as follows : astemizole gel carbopol 934 80 mg propylene glycol 1 ml ethanol 2 ml water 5.2 ml dmso 1.5 ml triethanolamine q.s. astemizole 100 mg terfenadine gel carbopol 934 80 mg propylene glycol 1 ml ethanol 2 ml water 5.2 ml dmso 1.5 ml triethanolamine q.s. terfenadine 100 mg stability studies the gels were kept in collapsible tubes and were placed in the stability chamber , which was maintained at 40degreesc and 75 % relative humidity for 90 days .
the gels were then observed for any change in the consistency and color .
besides , the drug content uniformity was evaluated as described below .
content uniformity five hundred milligram of the gel was taken and dissolved in a small amount of buffer ph 7.4 .
the volume was made up with buffer .
the absorbance was measured at 284 and 258 nm respectively , for astemizole and terfenadine .
in vitro release studies through excised rat skin [ 4 ] the rat skin soaked in buffer for 6 - 8 h was clamped carefully to one end of the dialysis cell ( donor compartment ) .
fifty milliliter phosphate buffer saline ( pbs ) containing 20 % ethanol was taken in a beaker ( receptor compartment ) .
gel , of 1 g quantity , was spread uniformly on the membrane .
the donor compartment was kept in contact with the receptor compartment .
the temperature was maintained at 37 +/ - 0.1degreesc .
at predetermined time intervals , 1 ml of the solution was pipetted out from the receptor compartment and immediately replaced with 1 ml of fresh pbs .
the drug concentration of the acceptor fractions was determined against appropriate blank .
wound healing studies healthy inbred male albino rats of wistar strain , weighing 180 - 200 g were selected .
they were individually housed and maintained on normal food and water ad libitum , under standard living conditions of room temperature 25degreesc and day and night reverse cycle .
the surgical interventions , under ketamine anesthesia ( 10 mg / kg ) , were carried out on the shaven back of the animals .
under each wound model of study , the wound bearing animals were divided into four groups , each group containing eight animals ( n = 8 ) .
the first group of animals was left untreated and served as control .
the second , third and fourth groups of animals received the topical applications , viz .
gel base ( base control ) , astemizole gel and terfenadine gel respectively , at approximately 100 mg per wound , once daily for 10 days in the case of incision wounds and a maximum of 20 days in the case of animals with excision wounds , starting from the day of surgery .
wound models incision wound : two para - vertebral straight incisions of 6 cm each were made through the entire thickness of skin on either side , at least one cm lateral to the vertebral column , as per the methods described by ehrlich and hunt. [ 5 ] the sutures were removed on the 7th day of wounding .
the wound breaking strengths were measured on the 10th day of wounding by continuous , constant water flow technique , as described by lee. [ 6 ] excision wound : excision wounds were made as described by morton and malone ,[ 7 ] by excising the full thickness circular skin ( approximately 500 mm2 ) from the nape of neck , under ketamine anesthesia .
wound contraction was assessed by tracing the wound area on polythene paper first and subsequently on a mm sq paper , every alternate day .
the wound closure rate was expressed as percentage of the original wound size of 500 mm2 on selected days .
on day 15 , an animal from each of the treated groups was sacrificed and the wound was excised and fixed in neutral buffered 10 % formalin .
later , paraffin sections of 5 micron were made and stained with h & e stain for histopathological evaluation .
the number of days required for the scab to fall off without leaving a raw wound behind was considered the period of epithelization .
healed scar on the day of epithelization was excised and used for determination of hydroxyproline content. [ 8 ] the experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee of mahe , manipal .
statistical analysis results were analyzed using the one - way anova , followed by post hoc test , viz .
scheffe 's test using the windows based spss computer package .
results content uniformity both the gel formulations of terfenadine and astemizole showed 99 % drug content uniformity in their formulations [ table 1 ] .

besides , air bubbles and crystals did not appear during the studies .
in vitro release studies of astemizole and terfenadine through rat skin the release of the drugs from the formulations was progressive and steady .
at the seventh hour , the rates of release of astemizole and terfenadine from their gel formulations were 71.30 % and 67.85 % respectively [ table 2 ] .

the rate of increase was between 26 % and 39 % respectively for astemizole and terfenadine [ table 3 ] .

the gel base treatment , however , enhanced the wound closer rate on day 6 and 10 .
wounds of the animals , which received astemizole , showed a similar rate of contraction as that of gel base on day 6 and day 10 .
however , these wounds contracted significantly faster than the gel base treated wounds on day 14 .
on the other hand , terfenadine gel showed significantly ( p < 0.05 ) greater wound contraction , as compared to gel base on days 2 , 6 , 10 and 14 [ table 4 ] .

thus , these animals took a period of 18 days for complete epithelization .
the gel base did not alter this .
on the other hand , the gels of astemizole and terfenadine significantly ( p < 0.05 ) promoted the epithelization process , thus shortening the period by two days [ table 4 ] .
the collagen content in the healed scar of the control and the base applied wounds was around 45 mg / g of the tissue .
the application of the gels of astemizole and terfenadine caused a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in collagen content of the scar tissues [ table 4 ] .
histopathological evaluation the wound sections from the animal in control group had a few notable histological observations such as more organized collagen , less number of inflammatory cells and blood vessels - markers of near complete healing .
besides , the growth of epithelial tongues was prominent in these sections [ figure 1 ] .
the features of the sections of the gel base were almost similar to those of control [ figure 2 ] .
on the other hand , the features of the sections of astemizole and terfenadine treated wounds were that of advanced healing , as compared to that of the control or gel base .
in these sections , there was complete restoration of epithelial growth , similar to that seen in normal skin .
inflammatory cells appear almost negligible in the dermis [ figures 3 and 4 ] .

discussion wound is a disruption in the continuity of the living tissues .
restoration of the continuity in a damaged area is brought upon by a house keeping mechanism of the body , viz .
the repair process .
tissue repair involves regeneration or replacement or , at times both , leading to the healing of a wound .
itching is one of the problems that the patient faces in the healing of a dermal wound .
histamine causes itching .
it needs to be contained or it may hamper the healing process or may cause damage to the scar .
doxepin , an antidepressant having antihistaminic activity upon topical use , has been shown to reduce the itching in burn wounds and scars. [ 2 ] however , its influence on healing has not been studied .
no treatment either systemic or local ( including ointment bases , dressing and suture materials etc. ) could be considered inert on the healing process. [ 1 ] in the light of above , the present study was undertaken to see if topical application of antihistaminic drugs could influence healing .
accordingly , gels of astemizole and terfenadine were prepared and tested for their influence on collagenation , wound contraction and epithelization phases of wound healing , upon topical application to incision and excision wounds .
the gels of both astemizole and terfenadine promoted healing in both wound models by influencing collagenation , wound contraction and epithelization phases .
while the phase of collagenation gives the required strength to the scars of wounds healed by primary and secondary intentions , wound contraction reduces the gap of the open wound to be filled by extracellular matrix ( rich in collagen ) and finally covered by epithelium .
two principal components of collagenation phase are collagen synthesis and maturation .
based on the results of the study , it could be assumed that terfenadine and astemizole might have enhanced the strength of the scar by increasing the collagen levels , which could stitch the wound edges together at the repaired site .
however , a number of phases of healing , especially coagulation , inflammation , macrophagia , fibroplasia collagenation , wound contraction and epithelization etc. are intimately interlinked .
therefore , a treatment could influence the healing of a wound by intervening in any one or many phases of healing .
thus , based on the present design , it is very difficult to comment on the exact locations and mechanisms of the pro - healing actions of the topical applications .
it is quite possible that the drugs could have had a direct influence on the healing , not withstanding their antihistaminic property .
for instance , the base of the gel , while it was inert on the collagenation and epithelization phases , promoted contraction during the first ten days .
these kinds of differential effects of bases and drug treatments are known to occur. [ 9 ] in conclusion , the study reported a new use for drugs such as terfenadine and astemizole .
these drugs produce systemic cardiac toxicity following administration in conventional doses .
the gels of these drugs could be free from these effects , as the drug concentration reaching systemic circulation from the topical 1 % gel applications would be negligible .
these gels may , therefore , have the potential to become useful alternatives to systemic antihistaminics , to reduce healing associated itch and to promote healing of wounds in wound care programs .

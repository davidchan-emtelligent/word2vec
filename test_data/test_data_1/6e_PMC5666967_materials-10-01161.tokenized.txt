in this study , mof / bifeo3 composite ( mof , metal - organic framework ) has been synthesized successfully through a one - pot hydrothermal method .
the mof / bifeo3 composite samples , pure mof samples and bifeo3 samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) , and by uv - vis spectrophotometry .
the results and analysis reveal that mof / bifeo3 composite has better photocatalytic behavior for methylene blue ( mb ) compared to pure mof and pure bifeo3 .
the enhancement of photocatalytic performance should be due to the introduction of mof change the surface morphology of bifeo3 , which will increase the contact area with mb. this composing strategy of mof / bifeo3 composite may bring new insight into the designing of highly efficient photocatalysts .
mof bifeo3 photocatalysts morphology 1 .
introduction in the past few decades , much attention has been paid to semi - conductor photocatalysts for their potential utilization of solar energy to solve the increasing environmental and energy crisis [ 1 ] .
as a first generation photocatalyst , tio2 has attracted the attention of many scientists .
in the 1970s , the photocatalytic properties of tio2 were investigated [ 2 ] .
due to its high photocatalytic performance , non - toxicity , low cost , and ease of preparation , tio2 has been widely used in water pollution control and hydrogen production by decomposition of water .
however , tio2 based photocatalysts are limited by the uv band due to their wide band gap defects [ 3 ] , and can hardly utilize visible light .
while ultraviolet light accounts for less than 5 % of sunlight , the utilization efficiency of solar light limits the practical application of tio2 as a photocatalyst. with a narrow band gap of ~ 2.2 ev and excellent chemical stability , bifeo3 has good response in the visible light range and higher photocatalytic efficiency compared to tio2 based photocatalyst [ 4 ] .
however , the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes , poor adsorption , and short lifetime of carriers result in lower photocatalytic activity of pure bifeo3 .
at present , measures to improve the photocatalytic performance of bifeo3 mainly include adjusting the size and morphology by changing the process [ 5 ] , ion doping of rare earth elements [ 6 ] , and surface deposition of noble metals [ 7 ] .
to some extent , doping of rare earth ions can reduce the band gap of bifeo3 and increase photocatalytic activity [ 8,9 ] .
however , the complete catalytic activity considerably depends upon surface adsorption over the surface of the photocatalyst [ 10,11,12 ] .
a great deal of research on the modification of bifeo3 does not improve its adsorption performance significantly .
in general , porous materials with different pore sizes have a strong adsorption capacity , which has aroused our interest .
up until now , compositing bifeo3 with porous materials has scarcely been reported .
metal - organic framework materials ( mofs ) have the advantages of ordered pore structure , large specific surface area , and adjustable pore shape and size , their adsorption capacity is much higher than that of conventional adsorbents ( such as molecular sieves and activated carbon ) [ 13,14 ] .
zif - 8 , 2 - methylimidazole zinc salt , one of the most widely studied zeolitic imidazolate framework materials , not only has the advantages of the above mofs , but also has better hydrothermal stability [ 15 ] , which gives it potential to couple with bifeo3 .
benefitting from the diversity of the mof species , this strategy of mof / bifeo3 composite would provide new ideas for the designing of highly efficient photocatalysts .
in this work , mof and bifeo3 composite photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a simple and low cost hydrothermal process .
photodegradation experiments showed that the composite photocatalyst can effectively improve the photocatalytic ability of degrading organic dye compared with the pure bifeo3 and pure mof .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
preparation of mof for synthesis of zif - 8 , 0.744 g ( 2.50 mmol ) zn ( no3 ) 2.6h2o was dissolved in 100 ml methanol , 0.410 g ( 5 mmol ) 2 - methylimidazole was dissolved in 160 ml methanol respectively , stirring until fully dissolved .
then the two solutions were mixed by magnetic stirring , the molar ratio of the various components in the mixed solution was maintained at : zn2 + : 2 - methylimidazole = 1:2 .
the whole operation was carried out at room temperature without any heating .
the solution was stirred with a constant speed at 800 r / min for 1 h , changed from transparent to ivory - white completely .
the synthesized powder was washed by methanol and collected by centrifuging , then dried for 12 h in the fume hood .
2.2 .
preparation of mof / bifeo3 composite the preparation of bifeo3 powder by hydrothermal method has the advantages of controllable morphology , high purity , and small particle size distribution [ 16 ] .
for synthesis of mof / bifeo3 composite , fe ( no3 ) 3.9h2o and bi ( no3 ) 3.5h2o were added into deionized water with a molar ratio of 1:1 .
then it was mixed with 1 ml nitric acid ( 68 wt %) and 2 g polyethylene glycol ( peg - 2000 ) by constant stirring at room temperature .
40 ml of koh ( 12 m ) solution used as a mineralizer was added dropwise into the mixed solution as slowly as possible .
when the ph value of the solution was neutral , 0.3 g of prepared zif - 8 powder was added .
subsequently , the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless vessel , and heated at 180 degreesc for 24 h. after nature cooling , the obtained sample was centrifuged and thoroughly washed with deionized water .
finally , the mof / bifeo3 composite was dried at 80 degreesc in a vacuum oven for 14 h .
2.3 .
characterization of phase and microstructure the phase compositions were characterized by x - ray powder diffraction ( d8advance , karlsruhe , germany ) with a graphite monochromator and cu kalpha ( lambda = 0.15418 nm ) radiation operating at 40 kv and 200 ma. the microstructural morphologies of the mof / bifeo3 composite were observed via scanning electron microscopy ( hitachi su70 , tokyo , japan ) .
2.4 .
measurements of photocatalytic performance the photocatalytic performance of pure bifeo3 , pure mof , and mof / bifeo3 photocatalysts were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue ( mb ) with a concentration of 20 mg / l in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation ( xe lamp , 300 w ; visible cut off filter > 420 nm ) .
methylene blue is a cationic dye with a methyl nitride group [( ch3 ) 2n +] .
in order to prevent any thermal catalytic effect , the reaction temperature was kept at 20 degreesc by circulation water during the whole process .
for intuitive contrast , 30 mg of samples were applied to photocatalytic experiments .
the samples and 80 ml mb solution ( 20 mg / l ) were placed in a reactor , and the suspension was placed in the dark and magnetically stirred for 30 min to reach the adsorption / desorption equilibrium before light irradiation .
the degradation of mb was examined using a spectrophotometer ( shimadzu uv - 2450 , kyoto , japan ) by centrifuging the retrieved samples and measuring the intensity of the absorption peak of mb ( 663 nm ) relative to its initial value ( c / c0 ) at intervals of 20 min .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
x - ray diffraction analysis figure 1 shows the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns of ( a ) simulated mof ( zif - 8 ) and ( b ) synthesized mof ( zif - 8 ) .
the diffraction peaks of synthesized mof sample are in indexed as cubic structure with an i - 43 m ( 217 ) space group ( ccdc number : 602542 ) .
the positions and relative intensity of all diffraction peaks match well with simulated mof .
no other impurity peaks are detected , indicating the highly crystalline structure of pure mof .
figure 2 shows the xrd patterns of mof / bifeo3 composite samples .
the diffraction peaks of mof / bifeo3 composite in figure 2b are identified as a perovskite based rhombohedral structure with an r3c space group ( jcpds no .
86 - 1518 ) along with the existence of minority phase such as bi2fe4o9 .
it is interesting to note that the composite with mof does not change the phase structure of bifeo3 , and the composite still exhibits almost the same purity and crystallinity as the pure bifeo3 shown in figure 2a .
3.2 .
morphology and microstructure analysis as seen in figure 3a , spherical bifeo3 particles are prepared by a hydrothermal process .
furthermore , no other morphologies can be detected , indicating a high uniformity of the product with the spherical morphology .
the magnification of pure bifeo3 shown in figure 3b,c , spherical bifeo3 are formed by the aggregation of many microcubes , which is consistent with a previous report [ 17 ] .
it is clear that the surface morphology of bifeo3 particle is very smooth in figure 3c , which may be one of the reasons for the poor adsorption ability of the pure bifeo3 .
figure 3d shows the sem images of prepared mof ( zif - 8 ) , pure mof particles exhibit regular spherical morphology with an average diameter of 60 ~ 80 nm. sem images of mof / bifeo3 composite in figure 4a - d show lamellar mof well disperse on the surface of bifeo3 particle , the surface morphology of mof / bifeo3 composite changes obviously compared with the pure bifeo3 .
the particle surface is coarse and porous , which allows the organic molecules to adsorb on the catalyst surface more easily and provide more reactive sites .
these will contribute to the increase of the reactive sites , as well as the enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron - hole pairs .
energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) analysis was carried out to identify the components of mof / bifeo3 composite .
figure 4e shows the diffraction peaks of bi , fe , o , and c elements corresponding to mof / bifeo3 composite observed in area 1 marked in figure 4d. from the insert table in figure 4e , it can be seen that the experimental atomic ratio of bi , fe , and o elements is close to the theoretical one of pure bifeo3 .
a small amount of c element was detected and should be the result of a small amount of mof adhering to the surface of the bifeo3 .
figure 4f shows the element contents of area 2 marked in figure 4d .
the ratio of the elements in the insert table is close to the theoretical zif - 8 and confirms that the lamellar mof was successfully dispersed on the surface of bifeo3 particle .
3.3 .
enhanced photocatalytic performance the photocatalytic activity of pure bifeo3 , pure mof , and mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalysts under visible light irradiation were defined by measuring the photodegradation of mb aqueous solution .
where c0 and c are the initial and final concentration of mb , respectively .
after 100 min of visible light irradiation , the maximum percentage of dye decomposition increased from 78 % for pure bifeo3 to 93 % for mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst , as shown in figure 5d .
as a contrast , when pure mof powders of the same amount were added to the photocatalytic experiments in figure 5b , they absorbed about 48 % of the dye in the dark environment for 30 min , and hardly underwent photocatalytic reactions under light irradiation .
degradation experiments showed that mof has no photocatalytic capacity , despite excellent adsorption properties .
after 40 min , dye adsorption reached the maximum , 50 % of the mb dye was adsorbed .
as shown in figure 5a,c , compared with pure bifeo3 , the enhancement of mb photodegradation efficiency for mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst was mainly thanks to the promotion of adsorption capability .
approximately 32 % mb was absorbed by composite photocatalyst in the first 30 min .
however , for pure bifeo3 , only 1.5 % was absorbed .
the results of degradation experiments confirmed that the change of the surface morphology of the mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst can effectively enhance the photocatalytic degradation ability of mb molecules .
4. photocatalytic reaction mechanism of mb over mof / bifeo3 composite under the irradiation of visible light , mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst can effectively absorb photons thanks to its narrow band gap .
the photocatalytic process included a series of photochemical reactions through the first step of electrons ( e - ) and holes ( h +) generation ( figure 6 ) .
the photogenerated holes in the valence band ( vb ) combine with absorbed h2o molecules to form strong oxidized hydroxyl radical ( oh ) .
in the presence of dissolved o2 , the electrons in the conduction band ( cb ) can react with o2 to form superoxide radical ( o2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) .
the oh radical has been deliberated to be the key active species accountable for the bifeo3 photocatalytic process .
the holes can also directly react with organic pollutants adsorbed on mof / bifeo3 composite and oxidize it to co2 and h2o .
the proposed mechanism ( 1 - 8 ) is as follows : absorption of efficient photons by mof / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst ( 1 ) ( mof / bifeo3 )+ hnu - - > ecb - + hvb + holes ( h +) in valence band combine with absorbed h2o molecules which produces hydroxyl radical (. oh ) ( 2 ) h ++ h2o - - >* oh + h + oxygen ionosorption ( 3 ) o2 + e - - - >* o2 - neutralization of by * o2 - protons ( 4 ) * o2 - + h + - - >* ooh transient hydrogen peroxide formation and dismutation of oxygen ( 5 ) 2 * ooh - - > o2 + h2o2 decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ( 6 ) h2o2 + e - - - >* oh + oh - hydroxyl radical is further generated ( 7 ) h2o2 +* o2 - - - >* oh + oh - + o2 oxidation of the mb molecules via successive attacks by . oh and direct oxidation by reaction with holes ( 8 ) mb +* oh , h + - - > co2 + h2o +..... .
5. conclusions in this work , a novel mfo / bifeo3 composite photocatalyst with high photocatalytic efficiency has been successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal method .
characterization of the composite photocatalyst confirmed that the mof with strong adsorptive property was successfully immobilized on the bifeo3 structure .
the surface morphology of mof / bifeo3 composite changed obviously compared with the pure bifeo3 , a large surface area increased the number of active sites to promote the separation of e - and h + pairs and improved the light absorption ability owing to multiple scattering effect .
according to the degradation of mb , the introduction of mof can enhance the adsorption capacity of bifeo3 effectively , thereby enhancing the degradation of mb under visible light irradiation .
this work proposed a new idea for efficient photocatalysts that can be used for purification of industrial waste .

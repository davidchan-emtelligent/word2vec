background despite clinical descriptions of severe vivax malaria cases having been reported , data regarding immunological and inflammatory patterns are scarce .
in this report , the inflammatory and immunological status of both mild and severe vivax malaria cases are compared in order to explore immunopathological events in this disease .
methods and results active and passive malaria case detections were performed during 2007 in buritis , rondonia , in the brazilian amazon .
a total of 219 participants enrolled the study .
study individuals were classified according to the presence of plasmodium vivax infection within four groups : non - infected ( n = 90 ) , asymptomatic ( n = 60 ) , mild ( n = 50 ) and severe vivax infection ( n = 19 ) .
a diagnosis of malaria was made by microscopy and molecular assays .
since at present no clear criteria define severe vivax malaria , this study adapted the consensual criteria from falciparum malaria .
patients with severe p. vivax infection were younger , had lived for shorter time in the endemic area , and recalled having experienced less previous malaria episodes than individuals with no malaria infection and with mild or asymptomatic infection .
strong linear trends were identified regarding increasing plasma levels of c reactive protein ( crp ) , serum creatinine , bilirubins and the graduation of disease severity .
plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) , interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) and also ifn - gamma / interleukin - 10 ratios were increased and exhibited a linear trend with gradual augmentation of disease severity .
both laboratory parameters of organ dysfunction and inflammatory cytokines were reduced during anti - parasite therapy in those patients with severe disease .
conclusion different clinical presentations of vivax malaria infection present strong association with activation of pro - inflammatory responses and cytokine imbalance .
these findings are of utmost importance to improve current knowledge about physiopathological concepts of this serious widespread disease .
background plasmodium vivax infection has been considered for a long time a benign and self - limited disease , mainly when compared to the burden of plasmodium falciparum infection in african countries [ 1 ] .
nevertheless , p. vivax is responsible for up to 400 million infections each year , representing the most widespread plasmodium species [ 2 ] .
plasmodium vivax accounts for the majority of malaria cases within the brazilian amazon [ 3 ] , and the prevalence of asymptomatic infection is very high [ 4,5 ] .
historically , cases of complicated p. vivax malaria have been rare , and documented almost exclusively by case reports or small case series [ 6 - 8 ] .
recent evidence from larger studies performed in melanesian populations has however reinforced the association between vivax malaria , severe complications , and death [ 9 - 11 ] .
severe complications associated with vivax malaria have also been reported in the amazon region [ 12 ] .
together with rising documentation of drug resistance worldwide , the complications of p. vivax infection represent a global health menace which needs focused efforts to its resolution .
major severe p. vivax clinical syndromes documented include important thrombocytopaenia [ 13,14 ] , cerebral malaria [ 15,16 ] , and acute renal [ 7,17 ] , hepatic [ 6 ] and pulmonary [ 18,19 ] dysfunctions .
in severe falciparum malaria syndromes , as in many other systemic infections , most of the pathology described seems to be a consequence of an intense inflammatory burst , favoured by a pathological activation of the immune system and cytokine release [ 20 - 22 ] .
despite clinical descriptions of the illness caused by p. vivax infection , data regarding immunological and inflammatory patterns are scarce .
in the present report , inflammatory and immunological status of both mild and severe vivax malaria cases were compared in order to explore immunopathological events in this disease .
methods study localities a study investigating determinant factors for vivax malaria severity was performed during 2007 in buritis ( 10degrees12'43 " s ; 63degrees49'44 " w ) , a recent urbanized municipality of the rondonia state , in the south - western part of brazilian amazon .
within this region , malaria transmission is unstable , with increased number of cases being detected annually between april to september , and the risk of infection is high [ 23 ] , with an annual parasite incidence of 77.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2005 [ 3 ] .
the prevalence of p. falciparum infection in the brazilian amazon is 23.7 % [ 3 ] , and plasmodium malariae case detection reaches 10 % in rondonia [ 24 ] .
participants and sampling active and passive malaria case detections were performed .
these included home visits in areas of high disease transmission , and study of individuals who seek care at the diagnostic centers of brazilian national foundation of health ( funasa ) , responsible for malaria control in the country .
in addition , patients admitted to the buritis municipal hospital ( hospital sao gabriel ) presenting clinical signs of mild or complicated malaria were also included in the study .
all individuals from fifteen to seventy years , of both sexes , who had been residing in the endemic area for more than six months , were invited to be included in the study .
exclusion criteria were : documented or strong clinical suspecting of viral hepatitis ( hav , hbv , hcv , hdv ) , chronic alcoholism , hiv infection , yellow fever , dengue , leptospirosis , tuberculosis , hansen 's disease , visceral leishmaniasis , documented or referred cancer and / or other chronic degenerative disease , sickle cell trait , and the use of hepatotoxic and immunessupressive drugs .
all participants or legal responsible gave written informed consent before entering the study .
this study was approved by the ethical committee of the sao lucas university , rondonia , brazil , for the human subject protocol .
individuals were examined and interviewed and their blood samples ( 20 ml ) were collected for serological experiments .
in hospitalized participants , two venous blood collections were performed : one at the hospital admission and other seven days after malaria treatment initiation .
all malaria diagnoses were performed using two methods .
first , patients were screened by thick smear examination using field microscopy and the parasitaemia ( parasites / ul ) was quantified in positive cases .
further , nested pcr was performed in all whole blood samples to confirm the diagnosis .
two individuals presenting p. malariae infection and 16 people infected with p. falciparum ( uncomplicated forms ) were identified and excluded from the study .
hence , all the volunteers selected were negative for p. falciparum and / or p. malariae infection by both microscopic examination and nested pcr .
a total of 219 individuals enrolled in the study .
all positive cases were followed for 30 days for the evaluation of malaria symptoms .
individuals who were positive for p. vivax infection and remained without fever ( axillary temperature > 37.8degreesc ) and / or chills , sweats , strong headaches , myalgia , nausea , vomiting , jaundice , asthenia , and arthralgia for 30 days were considered asymptomatic p. vivax - infected cases .
cases showing positive parasitological tests in the presence of any symptom listed above were classified as symptomatic infections .
patients presenting any sign of acute severe organ dysfunction [ 25 ] were considered severe cases .
until today there are no clear criteria defining what a severe vivax malaria case is. despite the absence of a consensus , this study used the previously defined criteria for severe falciparum infection [ 25 ] .
study individuals were then classified within four groups : non - infected ( n = 90 ) , asymptomatic ( n = 60 ) , mild ( n = 50 ) and severe vivax infection ( n = 19 ) .
the baseline characteristics of the volunteers are listed in the table 1 .

data represent the number of times the median of ast or alt is higher than the standardized normal laboratory level ( 40 u / l ) .
ordinal variables were compared using the kruskal wallis test with dunn 's multiple comparisons .
the prevalence of male gender was compared between the groups using chi - square test .
ssix out of sixty individuals with asymptomatic p. vivax infection were negative for malaria infection by light microscopy , but were positive for plasmodium vivax infection by nested pcr .
* differences were significant between groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
nested pcr for malaria diagnosis the molecular diagnosis of malaria infection was performed in all subjects using the nested pcr technique described previously [ 26,27 ] , with minimal alterations [ 28 ] .
to control for cross - contamination , one uninfected blood sample was included for every twelve samples processed .
fifteen percent of positive pcr samples were retested to confirm the amplification of plasmodial dna .
all tests were performed and confirmed at the centro de pesquisas goncalo moniz , salvador , bahia , brazil .
plasma cytokine levels detection plasma levels of il - 10 , ifn - gamma , and tnf were measured using the cytometric bead array - cba ( bd biosciences pharmingen , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol , with all samples running in a single assay .
the flow cytometric assay was performed and analysed by a single operator , and standard curves were derived from cytokine standards .
laboratory assessment of organ dysfunction plasma measurements of creatinin , aspartate amino - transferase ( ast ) , alanine amino - transaminase ( alt ) , total and direct bilirubins , haemoglobin , and crp were made at the clinical laboratory of faculdade sao lucas , at the pharmacy school ( federal university of bahia , brazil ) and at the laboratorio lpc ( salvador , bahia. brazil ) .
the hepatic - inflammatory parasitic score the hepatic - inflammatory parasitic ( hip ) score was created to standardize a reproducible evaluation of severity in malaria cases .
this score was developed by analysing data from another study conducted in 2006 with a sample size of 580 individuals from the buritis municipality , rondonia state , brazil .
this group was composed of non - infected individuals ( n = 183 ) and those infected with plasmodium presenting malaria - related symptoms ( n = 195 ) or asymptomatic infection ( n = 202 ) composed this sample .
in addition , this group was very similar to the one in 2007 with regard to age , gender , time of residence in endemic area and referred previous malaria episodes ( data not shown ) .
optimal threshold plasma values of ast , alt , total bilirubin , fibrinogen , crp , and parasitaemia able to discriminate asymptomatic from symptomatic malaria infection were calculated using the receiver operator characteristics ( roc ) curves ( figure 1 ) .
for each variable measured , the cut - off values presenting the higher sensitivity and specificity , as well as the highest likelihood ratio , were established ( figure 1a - f ) .
further , one point was attributed to each variable that presented higher than the established cut - off value .
consequently , the minimum score was zero and maximum was five , and it reflected both parasitaemia and organ dysfunction aspects of symptomatic disease .
once the score was established , it was tested by applying to the sample constituted by the 219 participants approached in this study ( figure 1g ) .
additionally , the relationship between the hip score and the ifn - gamma / il - 10 was assessed , since this ratio has been used as indicator of inflammatory activity in malaria [ 21,22,29 ] .
figure 1 the hepatic - inflammatory parasitic score .
in a primary investigation , 580 individuals from buritis , rondonia , brazil were evaluated to standardize the hepatic - inflammatory parasitic ( hip ) score .
this sample included non - infected individuals ( n = 183 ) and those infected with plasmodium presenting malaria - related symptoms ( n = 195 ) or asymptomatic infection ( n = 202 ) .
the threshold plasma values of ( a ) aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) , ( b ) alanino amino - transaminase ( alt ) , ( c ) total bilirubin , ( d ) fibrinogen , ( e ) c reactive protein ( crp ) and ( f ) parasitaemia were established in order to categorize the individuals according to the hip score .
once the hip score was created , it was applied in another sample from the same endemic area composed by 219 individuals : non - infected ( n = 90 ) , asymptomatic ( n = 60 ) , mild ( n = 50 ) and severe vivax infection ( n = 19 ) .
area under the curve ( auc ) was calculated , together with the cut - off value , which presents the higher likelihood ratio , and p values are plotted .
the hip score is described in methods .
statistical analysis data were analyzed using the graphpad prism 5.0 ( graphpad software inc. ) .
for the ordinal variables , differences between groups were calculated using the non - parametric kruskal - wallis test with dunn 's multiple comparisons or trend analysis .
the chi - square test was used to compare differences in categorized variables .
the correlations were assessed using the spearman test .
non - linear curve fit was also plotted to illustrate the general trend of the correlations .
the statistical analyses used are illustrated in each figure or table .
differences presenting p <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results and discussion baseline characteristics and laboratory assessment of p. vivax infection severity the majority of the participants were male , with no gender differences among groups ( p = 0.78 ) .
as previously described [ 4,28 ] , individuals with asymptomatic p. vivax infection were older , had experienced more previous malaria episodes and presented lower parasitaemia than had symptomatic cases ( table 1 ) .
patients with severe p. vivax infection were younger , having lived for a shorter time in the endemic area , and had experienced fewer previous malaria episodes than individuals with no malaria infection and with mild or asymptomatic infection ( table 1 ) .
moreover , patients with severe disease displayed higher parasitaemias than those with uncomplicated infection ( p < 0.0001 ) .
haemoglobin levels were also decreased in patients with severe disease ( p = 0.02 ) .
all patients with severe disease were admitted to the municipal hospital presenting with fever , tachycardia and tachypnea .
moreover , five out of nineteen individuals with severe infection developed jaundice and six presented with splenomegaly .
six infected patients died within 72 h of hospitalization , four presenting with acute respiratory failure and two with anuric renal failure , despite the haemodynamic support and anti - parasite therapy .
these severe complications have been commonly implicated as major death causes in severe vivax infections [ 7,18 ] .
the other thirteen individuals with complicated disease received specific treatment with intravenous quinine and achieved total clinical recovery after 10 - 15 days .
clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients with severe malaria are summarized in table 2 .
all patients with mild disease recovered totally and no drug resistance was identified within individuals studied .

oliguria was defined as estimated urinary output less than 400 ml / 24 h and anuric renal failure as urinary output below 100 ml / 24 h. severe anaemia was defined as haemoglobin levels below 7 g / dl and jaundice by clinical exam and bilirubin levels above 2.0 .
hypotension was defined as the presence of related symptoms with blood pressure below 100 x 40 mmhg .
respiratory failure was defined as tachypnea , shortness of breath , mental confusion clinical signs of hypoxaemia ( central and / or peripheral cyanosis ) .
the further step was to assess whether the spectrum of vivax malaria clinical presentation could be associated with laboratory parameters of organ dysfunction .
in a primary analysis , strong linear trends were identified regarding increasing plasma levels of crp , serum creatinine , bilirubins and the graduation of disease severity ( table 2 ; p < 0.0001 for all trends analyzed ) .
the individuals presenting higher hip scores also displayed elevated ifn - gamma / il - 10 ratios ( figure 1g ) .
these data indicate that a high grade of general inflammation - mediated systemic damage is occurring in some vivax malaria cases , explaining the severity of their clinical presentations .
inflammatory balance according to p. vivax infection severity furthermore , a possible link between the differences in clinical presentation and laboratory parameters of organ damage and specific patterns of immune responses or inflammatory mediators profile was evaluated .
plasma tnf , which is related to p. vivax paroxysms [ 30 ] , was higher according to infection severity ( figure 2a ) .
ifn - gamma is also implicated in both resistance to malaria [ 31 ] and disease immunopathology [ 32 ] .
in the present series , ifn - gamma levels were higher in patients with increased severity ( figure 2b ) .
interestingly , the increasing levels of all these inflammatory markers also presented a linear trend with the gradual augmentation of infection severity ( p < 0.0001 for each parameter ) .
conversely , plasma levels of il - 10 , a cytokine that down - regulates inflammation , were lower with increased disease severity ( p < 0.0001 , for linear trend ; figure 2c ) .
thus , ifn - gamma / il - 10 ratio values were higher in patients with increased disease severity ( p < 0.0001 , for linear trend ; figure 2d ) .
figure 2 general trend of the inflammatory profile in vivax malaria .
plasma levels of ( a ) tnf , ( b ) ifn - gamma , ( c ) il - 10 and ( d ) ifn - gamma / il - 10 ratios were estimated in non - infected individuals and those presenting different manifestations of the vivax malaria clinical spectrum .
study participants were stratified in groups as follows : non - infected ( ni ; n = 90 ) ; asymptomatic infection ( asy ; n = 60 ) ; mild infection ( mild ; n = 50 ) ; and severe infection ( sev ; n = 19 ) .
one - way anova with trend analysis was performed to check the statistical significance between the groups studied .
p values are plotted in each graph .
kinetics of inflammatory responses during the treatment of severe vivax infection in thirteen patients , who clinically recovered out of nineteen with severe vivax infection , there was an important reduction in the levels of all laboratory parameters of organ damage screened , including plasma crp ( p = 0.002 ; figure 3a ) , creatinine ( p = 0.005 ; figure 3b ) , alt ( p = 0.001 ; figure 3c ) and total bilirubin ( p = 0.016 ; figure 3d ) during anti - parasite treatment .
this observation suggests that clinical recovery resulted from a reduction in systemic inflammatory aggression .
regarding the immune markers of pro - inflammatory responses , an important decrease in both ifn - gamma / il - 10 ratios ( p = 0.0005 ; figure 4a ) and tnf levels ( p = 0.001 ; figure 4b ) was noticed during anti - malarial treatment .
figure 3 kinetic of organ damage indicators during antimalarial treatment in individuals with severe vivax disease .
plasma levels of ( a ) crp , ( b ) creatinine , ( c ) , alt and ( d ) total bilirubin were estimated before treatment ( at admission to the hospital ) and after seven days of inhospital care in individuals with severe vivax infection who achieved cure ( n = 13 ) .
wilcoxon matched pairs test was performed to calculate the statistical significance .
p values are plotted in each graph .

( a ) ifn - gamma / il - 10 ratios and ( b ) tnf plasma levels were estimated before treatment ( at admission to the hospital ) and after seven days of in - hospital care in individuals with severe vivax infection who achieved cure ( n = 13 ) .
wilcoxon matched pairs test was performed to calculate the statistical significance .
p values are plotted in each graph .
conclusions these investigations suggest that different clinical presentations of vivax malaria infection are strongly associated with a potent activation of pro - inflammatory responses and cytokine imbalance .
these results are of utmost importance to improve current knowledge about physiopathological concepts of this serious , widespread disease .

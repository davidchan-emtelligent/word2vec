pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade detection and destruction by the host immune system .
large dna viruses encode homologues of chemokines and their receptors , as well as chemokine - binding proteins ( ckbps ) to modulate the chemokine network in host response .
the secret domain ( smallpox virus - encoded chemokine receptor ) represents a new family of viral ckbps that binds a subset of chemokines from different classes to inhibit their activities , either independently or fused with viral tumor necrosis factor receptors ( vtnfrs ) .
here we present the crystal structures of the secret domain of vtnfr crmd encoded by ectromelia virus and its complex with chemokine cx3cl1 .
the secret domain adopts a beta - sandwich fold and utilizes its beta - sheet i surface to interact with cx3cl1 , representing a new chemokine - binding manner of viral ckbps .
structure - based mutagenesis and biochemical analysis identified important basic residues in the 40s loop of cx3cl1 for the interaction .
mutation of corresponding acidic residues in the secret domain also affected the binding for other chemokines , indicating that the secret domain binds different chemokines in a similar manner .
we further showed that heparin inhibited the binding of cx3cl1 by the secret domain and the secret domain inhibited raw264.7 cell migration induced by cx3cl1 .
these results together shed light on the structural basis for the secret domain to inhibit chemokine activities by interfering with both chemokine - gag and chemokine - receptor interactions .
author summary chemokines are a family of small proteins that help the immune system fight against invading pathogens by inducing the white blood cells to the areas of infection and inflammation .
due to the important roles of chemokines in immune response , the pathogens evolve diverse mechanisms to neutralize their activities .
one example is that large dna viruses , such as poxviruses and herpesviruses can produce chemokine binding proteins ( ckbps ) to sequester chemokines during the infection .
the secret domain represents a new family of viral ckbps that was originally identified as a c - terminal extension of the viral tumor necrosis factor receptors ( vtnfrs ) .
we determined the three - dimensional structures of the secret domain and its complex with chemokine cx3cl1 , revealing a new chemokine - binding manner of viral ckbps .
we also showed that other chemokines from different classes may be bound by the secret domain in a way similar to that observed in the secret / cx3cl1 complex structure .
our biochemical and chemotaxis assays also suggest that the secret domain is able to interfere with both chemokine - gag and chemokine - receptor interactions , both of which are essential for chemokine activities in vivo .
introduction chemokines orchestrate leukocyte migration during immune surveillance , inflammation , and development [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
they comprise a large family (~ 50 ) of small proteins (~ 7 - 14 kd ) that are classified into four classes ( c , cc , cxc , and cx3c , where x is any residue ) based on the spacing of conserved cysteine residues at the n - terminus [ 5 ] .
the cc and cxc classes are by far the largest groups of chemokines , whereas the c class consists of two members ( xcl1 and xcl2 ) and the cx3c class contains only one member ( cx3cl1 ) .
all chemokines share a remarkably similar structural fold , consisting of an extended n - terminus , an antiparallel three - stranded beta - sheet and a c - terminal helix [ 6 ] .
chemokines exert their biological activities through binding with their cognate g protein - coupled receptors expressed on the surface of leukocytes , as well as binding with endothelial or matrix glycosaminoglycans ( gags ) to form chemokine gradients along which cells travel across endothelium and into tissues [ 6 ] .
the molecular basis of chemokine - gag and chemokine - receptor interactions has not been well understood [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
it has been suggested that the basic residues ( typically arg and lys ) involved in gag interaction are more or less scattered along the polypeptide chain and form four distinct clusters on the surface of chemokines [ 8 ] , while the n - termini of all studied chemokines is critical for inducing signaling by their respective receptors [ 6 ] .
the chemokine network is an important component of host immune response to viral infection [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , which is also extensively modulated by viruses especially large dna viruses to evade host reactions .
poxviruses and herpesviruses encode their own chemokines , chemokine receptors and chemokine - binding proteins ( ckbps ) [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
the viral ckbps identified so far are unrelated to any host proteins and exhibit diverse chemokine - binding profiles , reflecting differences in viral tropism and pathogenesis .
the viral cc chemokine inhibitor ( vcci , also called t1 / 35 kda ) secreted by several poxviruses including cowpox virus ( cpxv ) , ectromelia virus ( ectv ) and vaccinia virus ( vacv ) is the most extensively studied , which binds many cc chemokines but not c , cxc , and cx3c chemokines to block chemokine - receptor interaction [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
the vacv a41 and ectv e163 , representative members of another family of poxviral ckbps , interact with a subset of cc and cxc chemokines to block chemokine - gag interaction [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
mouse gamma - herpesvirus 68 encodes a unique ckbp named as the m3 protein that is able to bind chemokines from the c , cc , cxc , and cx3c classes [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
structural and biochemical studies revealed that m3 disrupts both chemokine - receptor and chemokine - gag interactions [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
other viral ckbps , such as m - t7 from myxoma virus ( myxv ) , a ckbp from orf virus ( orfv ) , p21.5 from human cytomegalovirus and glycoprotein g from alpha - herpesviruses , have also been described previously [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
four different genes encoding viral tumor necrosis factor receptors ( vtnfrs ) have been identified in poxviruses , consisting of cytokine response modifier b ( crmb ) , crmc , crmd , and crme [ 10 ] .
they contribute to pathogenesis of poxviruses and reflect the complex regulation of tnf - mediated host immune response [ 28 ] .
in addition to the anti - tnf activity attributed to the n - terminal four cysteine - rich domains ( crds ) homologous to host tnf receptors [ 29 ] , crmb and crmd have anti - chemokine activity attributed to a unique c - terminal extension (~ 160 aa ) , named as the secret domain ( smallpox virus - encoded chemokine receptor ) [ 30 ] .
biochemical analysis revealed that the secret domain binds a subset of human and mouse cc , cxc and c chemokines , including ccl28 , ccl25 , ccl20 , cxcl12 , cxcl13 , cxcl14 , and xcl1 [ 30 ] .
the identification of other poxvirus genes encoding homologues with the secret domain indicates that the secret domain represents a new family of viral ckbps , which has specific folding to allow its binding with chemokines , either independently or fused with vtnfrs [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
a recent report predicted the structural homology of the secret domain with cpxv vcci and vacv a41 and also analyzed its structural differences from vcci and a41 based on a de novo model [ 32 ] .
here we report the crystal structures of the secret domain of crmd encoded by an ectv strain [ 33 ] and the complex of it with chemokine cx3cl1 .
these structures , together with biochemical and chemotaxis assays , reveal the structural basis for the secret domain to bind chemokines and also shed light on its anti - chemokine structural mechanisms .
results structure of the secret domain the crystal structure of the secret domain ( residues s162 - d320 ) was determined at a resolution of 1.57 a by using single - wavelength anomalous dispersion ( sad ) method with a br - soaked derivative ( table 1 and figure s1 in text s1 ) .
there are two secret domains ( molecules a and b ) in the asymmetric unit ( figure 1a ) , related by a non - symmetrical two - fold axis with an r.m.s.d. of 0.62 a for all calpha atoms .
although these two monomers bind each other tightly with a buried surface of ~ 1160 a2 , the size exclusion chromatography revealed that it is monomeric in solution ( figure s2 in text s1 ) .
the same phenomenon was also observed in the cpxv and ectv vcci crystal structures [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
therefore , the secret dimer in the asymmetric unit is caused by molecular packing and unlikely has any functional significance .

the beta - sheet i consists of five anti - parallel strands 1 , 5 , 6 , 10 and 11 ( figure 1b and figure s3 in text s1 ) .
the beta - sheet ii consists of six strands , which can be further divided into two segments ( antiparallel strands 2 , 3 , 4 and 7 ; antiparallel strands 8 and 9 ) ( figure 1b and figure s3 in text s1 ) .
the beta - sheet ii outside surface is completely exposed to solvent ( figure 1b ) , whereas the solvent accessibility of beta - sheet i outside surface is limited by a long c - terminal loop after strand 11 surrounding the bottom half of beta - sheet i ( figure 1b ) .
a disulfide bond , c180 - c317 , further fixes the conformation of this extended loop by connecting it to the 1 - 2 loop ( figure 1b and figure s3 in text s1 ) .
structural comparison with other poxviral ckbps the overall beta - sandwich topology of the secret domain is similar to that of vcci and a41 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
however , there are several significant differences in the arrangement of certain secondary structure elements , making the crmd secret domain more compact than vcci and a41 and also directly affecting its binding with chemokines .
in the following comparison and description , we use the structure of vcci from ectv as the representative member of the vcci family [ 35 ] .
the first difference is at the 7 - 9 loop ( s248 - h266 ) in the secret domain , corresponding to residues s140 to i168 in vcci and e113 to m144 in a41 ( figure 2a and figure s4 in text s1 ) .
the long s140 - i168 loop in vcci wraps the beta - sheet i at the top half , and the long e113 - m144 loop in a41 wraps the whole beta - sandwich from bottom side ( figure 2a ) .
in collaboration with the conserved c - terminal loop surrounding the bottom half of beta - sheet i , these two long loops further limit the solvent exposable surface of beta - sheet i in vcci and a41 , respectively ( figure 2a ) .
the 7 - 9 loop in the secret domain goes up and down at the beta - sheet ii side of the beta - sandwich , and residues s252 to q254 form the strand 8 in beta - sheet ii ( figure 2a and figure s4 in text s1 ) .
therefore , it does not limit the solvent exposable surface of beta - sheet i in the secret domain .
the second difference occurs at the 2 - 3 loop ( i184 - s186 ) in the secret domain , whose length is nearly the same as that in a41 ( k39 - y40 ) and much shorter than that in vcci ( s52 - p66 ) ( figure 2a and figure s4 in text s1 ) .
the third difference occurs at the 6 - 7 loop , whose length in the secret domain ( n227 - c238 ) is also much shorter than that in vcci ( s107 - c131 ) and a41 ( s80 - c104 ) ( figure 2a and figure s4 in text s1 ) .
there is an alpha - helix in this loop region of vcci and a41 , which is absent in the secret domain ( figure 2a ) .

( c ) the conformational change of the 6 - 7 loop colored with purple .
the electrostatic complementarity plays a critical role in the binding of chemokines by vcci and a41 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
the beta - sheet ii of vcci exhibits strong electronegative character .
negative charge patches , including the protruded acidic 2 - 3 loop ( s52 - p66 ) ( figure 3a and figure s4 in text s1 ) , are involved in the interactions with positive charged residues of bound chemokine as revealed in the nmr solution structure of vcci in complex with chemokine ccl4 [ 36 ] .
the 2 - 3 loop ( k39 - y40 ) in a41 is much shorter than that in vcci , but its beta - sheet ii also exhibits negative charge patches ( figure 3b and figure s4 in text s1 ) and may contribute to the interaction with bound chemokine [ 17 ] .
the opposite beta - sheet i of vcci and a41 is comparatively uncharged and electropositive , respectively ( figure 3a and 3b ) .
the secret domain exhibits different electrostatic surface by switching the surface charge property as observed in vcci and a41 .
its beta - sheet ii has no remarkable electrostatic properties , while the opposite beta - sheet i exhibits strong negative charge in the solvent exposable region , contributed by acidic residues d167 , e169 , d228 , d290 , d316 , and e318 ( figure 3c and figure s4 in text s1 ) .
the distinct surface charge property of the secret domain leads us to speculate that it may bind chemokines in a different manner by using the solvent exposable and negatively charged surface of beta - sheet i .

structure of the secret / cx3cl1 complex to directly elucidate the chemokine binding by the secret domain , we reconstituted a complex of the secret domain with the chemokine domain of cx3cl1 and determined its structure at a resolution of 2.6 a. the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the secret domain and cx3cl1 structures as search models , and refined to final rwork and rfree factors of 19.6 % and 25.0 % , respectively ( table 1 and figure s1 in text s1 ) .
in the complex , one secret domain monomer binds one cx3cl1 monomer , displaying a 1:1 stoichiometry ( figure 4a ) .
the chemokine domain of cx3cl1 in the complex adopts the typical chemokine - fold topology , consisting of an extended n - loop ( c8 - p20 ) , a short 310 helix ( v21 - l23 ) , a 3 - stranded anti - parallel beta - sheet ( beta1 , l24 - q29 ; beta2 : i39 - t43 ; beta3 : r47 - a51 ) , a c - terminal helix ( q56 - a69 ) packing against the beta - sheet , and the 30s loop ( n30 - a38 ) and 40s loop ( r44 - h46 ) connecting the strands in the beta - sheet ( figure 4a ) .
the n - terminal residues q1 to k7 and c - terminal residues r74 to g76 are disordered in the structure .
the secret domain contacts the cx3cl1 with its beta - sheet i , burying a surface of ~ 530 a2 ( figure 4a ) .
the secret domain contacting residues are from the strands 1 , 5 , and 6 of beta - sheet i and the c - terminal extended loop , while the cx3cl1 contacting residues are from the n - loop , 310 helix , 40s loop , and the beta3 strand ( figure 4a ) .
the binding interface can be described as a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a large halo of hydrophilic interactions .
the hydrophobic core is composed of residues y212 and f225 from crmd , and i19 , l23 and f49 from cx3cl1 ( figure 4b ) .
the surrounding hydrophilic interactions are composed of hydrogen bonds and salt - bridges .
there is an obvious electrostatic complementarity between the secret domain and cx3cl1 at the interface ( figure 4c ) .
the acidic residues d167 , e169 , and d316 from the secret domain form salt - bridge interactions with r44 , r47 , and k18 from cx3cl1 , respectively ( figure 4d ) .

the secret domain and cx3cl1 are in the same orientation as in panel b. d ) detailed view of the interactions at the binding interface .
hydrophilic interactions around basic residues k18 , r44 , and r47 of cx3cl1 are shown as dashed lines .
to further elucidate the roles of important residues in complex formation , we mutated hydrophobic residues i19a , l23a and f49a and charged residues k18a , r44a , and r47a in cx3cl1 , and measured the binding affinities of these mutants with the secret domain using surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) method .
we performed two independent measurements for each protein sample and the results are listed in table 2 .
the secret domain interacted with cx3cl1 with an affinity of 0.68 +/ - 0.26 microm ( table 2 and figure s5 in text s1 ) the cxc3l1 mutants i19a,l23a , and f49a bound the secret domain with affinities of 0.96 +/ - 0.32 , 4.49 +/ - 1.13 , and 4.20 +/ - 0.45 microm , respectively ( table 2 and figure s5 in text s1 ) .
the cx3cl1 mutants k18a , r44a , and r47a bound the secret domain with affinities of 10.9 +/ - 0.6 microm , 16.15 +/ - 0.45 microm , and 36.45 +/ - 1.95 microm , respectively ( table 2 and figure s5 in text s1 ) .
all mutations resulted in the decrease of the binding affinity between the secret domain and cx3cl1 .
mutating charged residues k18 , r44 , and r47 in cx3cl1 induced more significant binding affinity decrease than mutating hydrophobic residues i19 , l23 , and f49 , suggesting the importance of the salt - bridge interactions in the complex formation of the secret domain with cx3cl1 .

the secret domain utilizes its beta - sheet i to interact with cx3cl1 , whereas vcci utilizes its beta - sheet ii to interact with ccl4 upon complex formation .
the vcci / ccl4 binding interface , burying a total surface of ~ 990 a2 , can be divided into two patches .
the patch 1 between the n - loop of ccl4 and vcci is primarily composed of hydrophobic interactions around ccl4 residue f13 and salt - bridge interactions around ccl4 residue r18 ( figure s6 in text s1a ) [ 36 ] .
these two positions are conserved in cc chemokines and mutation of them dramatically decreased the binding of cc chemokines by vcci [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
the patch 2 is between the basic 40s loop of ccl4 and the extended and acidic 2 - 3 loop of vcci ( figure s6 in text s1a ) , and the electrostatic complementarity is expected to drive the interactions between them , although basic residues k45 , r46 , and k48 in the 40 s loop of ccl4 were mutated to ala in the vcci / ccl4 complex structure ( figure s6 in text s1a ) [ 36 ] .
the smaller secret / cx3cl1 interface (~ 530 a2 ) is composed one contact patch with a small hydrophobic core and surrounding hydrophilic interactions as described above ( figure 4b ) .
the region from c8 to m15 of the n - loop is far away from the secret domain , so the secret domain does not utilize critical hydrophobic interactions observed in the vcci / ccl4 contact patch 1 to bind cx3cl1 .
the corresponding position of r18 in ccl4 is k18 in cx3cl1 , which forms salt - bridge interaction with d316 of the secret domain to surround the hydrophobic core ( figure 4d ) and is also important for their binding ( table 2 ) .
structural superimposition based on bound chemokines revealed that the smaller secret / cx3cl1 interface corresponds to contact patch 2 in the vcci / ccl4 interface ( figure s6 in text s1a ) .
although obvious electrostatic complementarity is observed in both the secret / cx3cl1 interface ( figure 4c ) and the contact patch 2 in the vcci / ccl4 interface ( figure s6 in text s1a ) , the electrostatic interactions around the basic 40s loop of bound chemokine play a different role in the formation of these two complexes .
residues r44 and r47 of cx3cl1 are critical because mutations at these positions caused respective ~ 24 - fold and ~ 54 - fold drop in the binding of cx3cl1 by the secret domain ( table 2 ) .
in contrast , a triple mutant of ccl4 ( k45a / r46a / k48a ) had nearly the same binding affinity as wild type ccl4 , as determined by elisa method [ 36 ] .
in ccl2 , the k49a mutation even increased its binding affinity with vcci [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
therefore , the contact patch 2 around the 40s loop of chemokines might contribute to chemokine binding of vcci by providing an electronegative platform to recruit different cc chemokines , while the conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions around the n - loop of cc chemokines in the contact patch 1 determine the high affinity binding of cc chemokines by vcci .
the contact patch around the basic 40s loop of cx3cl1 has dual roles , not only helping the recruitment of a subset of chemokines from different classes by the secret domain , but also providing critical interactions for the complex formation .
parasites , such as blood - sucking ticks and schistosoma mansoni , also secrete ckbps with anti - inflammatory activities [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
evasin , a new family of ckbps encoded by ticks , comprises four members that may help inhibit chemokine - mediated host innate immune responses [ 40 ] .
in contrast to most of the viral ckbps , evasin - 1 is very restrictive by only binding ccl3 , ccl4 and ccl18 [ 40 ] .
the evasin - 1 adopts a novel fold and it interacts with bound ccl3 by primarily contacting its n - loop region , as revealed in the evasin - 1 / ccl3 complex structure ( figure s6 in text s1b ) [ 42 ] .
structural superimposition based on bound chemokines revealed that the secret - binding and evasin - 1 - binding epitopes on chemokines are distinct with little overlap ( figure s6 in text s1b ) .
therefore , the secret domain and evasin - 1 are different in the chemokine - binding manner .
the m3 encoded by murine gamma - herpesvirus 68 functions as a dimer in solution , in contrast to other monomeric poxviral ckbps .
the two m3 monomers are arranged in a " head - to - tail " manner , each monomer consisting of the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) and c - terminal domain ( ctd ) ( figure s6 in text s1c ) [ 21 ] .
unlike the secret / cx3cl1 complex in 1:1 stoichiometry , the m3 dimer utilizes the ntd of one monomer and the ctd of the other monomer to form two clefts to bind two chemokines , forming a complex in 2:2 stoichiometry ( figure s6 in text s1c ) [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .
the secret domain and the ntd of m3 have positional overlap around the 40s loop of bound chemokine ( figure s6 in text s1c ) .
the evasin - 1 and the ctd of m3 have positional overlap around the n - loop of bound chemokine ( figure s6 in text s1c ) .
therefore , m3 seems to combine different chemokine - binding manners of the secret domain and evasin - 1 by utilizing both ntd and ctd in the binding of chemokines .
the secret domain interferes with the interaction of cx3cl1 with both gag and cellular receptor we conducted a spr experiment as reported for other viral ckbps ( vacv a41 and ectv e163 ) to test if the secret domain can interfere with the interaction of cx3cl1 with gag [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
the cx3cl1 was pre - incubated with various amount of heparin ( sodium salt , molecular weight ~ 15 kda ) , and then injected over the secret - coupled sensor chip .
heparin decreased the binding of cx3cl1 by the secret domain in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 5 ) , indicating the overlap of secret - binding and gag - binding sites on cx3cl1 .
in our experiment , the concentration of heparin required for the inhibition was much higher than that used to achieve the disruption of chemokine binding by a41 and e163 [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
this may be caused by the reported low binding affinity between cx3cl1 and heparin [ 23 ] .

the binding of cx3cl1 without heparin pre - incubation ( 0 mg / ml ) by the secret domain was checked again ( response curve in black ) after finishing all other measurements to make sure that the decrease of response was not due to the change of chip surface .

it has also been shown that the secret domain can inhibit the ccl25 - mediated molt4 cell migration , indicating its ability to interfere with binding of ccl25 with its cellular receptors [ 18 ] , [ 30 ] .
we also checked the ability of recombinant cx3cl1 in inducing migration of raw264.7 cell as reported [ 43 ] , as well as the ability of the secret domain to inhibit cell migration .
cx3cl1 induced the migration of raw264.7 cells in a dose - dependent manner , indicated by the decrease of cells remaining in the top well with the increase of cx3cl1 concentration in the bottom well ( figure 6a ) .
chemokinesis , defined as a random movement of cells in a zero gradient ( equal amounts of starting chemoattractant in both top and bottom wells ) , was very low ( figure 6a ) .
pre - incubation of cx3cl1 with excessive secret domain significantly reduced the cx3cl1 - mediated cell migration ( figure 6b ) .
we also expressed and purified the secret domain with a triple mutation d167a / e169a / d316a by replacing its acidic residues involved in the critical salt - bridge interactions at the secret / cx3cl1 interface .
gel - filtration and circular dichroism ( cd ) spectroscopy profiles indicate that this mutant was properly folded and purified as the wild type protein ( figure s7 in text s1 ) .
this secret domain mutant lost most of the inhibitory ability ( figure 6b ) .
these results together suggest that the secret domain is able to interfere with the binding of cx3cl1 with its receptors on cell surface .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002162.g006 figure 6 cx3cl1 - induced migration of raw 264.7 cells .
( a ) the number of cells remaining in the top well counted by facs after a 4 - h chemotaxis assay are indicated with cx3cl1 in concentrations of 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 microm in the bottom well , as well as the same concentration 1.0 microm in both top and bottom wells .
( b ) the number of cells remaining in the top well counted by facs after a 4 - h chemotaxis assay are indicated with cx3cl1 , cx3cl1 pre - incubated with the secret domain in different molar ratio ( 1:1 , 1:5 , and 1:10 ) , and cx3cl1 pre - incubated with the secret domain triple mutant d167a / e169a / d316a in a 1:10 molar ratio .
the d167a / e169a / d316a mutant is referred as 3a mutant in the figure .
the secret domain binds different chemokines similarly the measured binding affinity (~ 0.68 microm ) between the secret domain and cx3cl1 in our experiment is lower than previous reported binding affinities between the secret domain and ccl28 , ccl25 , cxcl12 , cxcl13 , cxcl14 , xcl1 , and ccl20 that are in nm range [ 30 ] .
this raises the question if the secret domain binds other chemokines in a manner similar to that observed in the secret / cx3cl1 complex structure .
to help answer this question , we examined the binding ability of the secret domain d167a / e169a / d316a mutant .
besides cx3cl1 , ccl28 , ccl25 and cxcl12 were chosen because they were the previously reported top three in the binding with the crmb and crmd [ 30 ] .
the spr analysis showed that the triple mutations in the secret domain not only disrupted its binding with cx3cl1 , but also with ccl28 , ccl25 , and cxcl12 to undetectable level ( figure 7 ) , indicating that the secret domain binds different chemokines in a similar manner .

the d167a / e169a / d316a mutant is referred as 3a mutant in the figure .
discussion gag binding plays important roles in the in vivo function of chemokines , including helping immobilize chemokines to form a concentration gradient along which cells can migrate directionally , protecting chemokines from proteolysis , and inducing chemokine oligomerization [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
it has been suggested that four distinct basic clusters on the surface of chemokines are major gag - binding sites for different chemokines [ 8 ] .
these four clusters all involve residues from the basic 40 loops .
residues on the chemokines important for gag binding have also been characterized by mutagenesis studies for several chemokines including ccl2 , ccl3 , ccl4 , ccl5 , cxcl8 , cxcl12 , and xcl1 [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
basic residues from the 40s loop participate in the binding of gag by all studied chemokines except cxcl8 [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
the respective structures of ccl5 and cxcl12 with heparin - derived disaccharides also confirmed that the bbxb motif ( where b and x stand for basic and neutral / hydrophobic amino acid ) of the 40s loop participates in gag binding [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
the inhibition of chemokine - gag interaction by m3 is also attributed to its interaction with the basic 40s loop of bound chemokine by the ntd [ 23 ] .
these previous results all suggest that the basic 40s loop of chemokines is generally involved in the gag - binding .
in the secret / cx3cl1 complex structure , the basic residues r44 and r47 from the 40s loop of cx3cl1 have direct interaction with the secret domain .
we have also shown that heparin can interfere with the binding of cx3cl1 by the secret domain in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 5 ) , similar to the interference of heparin in the chemokine binding of a41 and e163 [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
these data together indicate that the secret domain is able to block the chemokine - gag interaction .
the inhibitory ability of the secret domain for ccl25 and cx3cl1 induced cell migration indicates that it is able to interfere with the chemokine - receptor interaction .
it is generally accepted that the n - termini of chemokines is the key signaling domain , and other residues in the n - loop and core domain can also be critical for the binding with chemokine receptors .
for example , the residues 12 - 17 in the n - loop of cxcl12 were shown to be important for receptor binding [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
the n - loop region ( residues 13 - 20 ) of cc chemokines promotes tight binding to the chemokine receptors [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
the vcci and m3 interfere with the chemokine - receptor interaction by completely blocking the accessibility of the n - loop region of bound chemokine , as revealed in the complex structure of vcci with ccl4 , and m3 with ccl2 and xcl1 [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 36 ] .
the n - loop of cx3cl1 is not completely blocked by the secret domain .
the s13 position at the n - terminal part of the n - loop critical for the binding of chemokines by vcci and m3 is accessible in the secret / cx3cl1 complex , but residues t16 , s17 , k18 , and i19 at the c - terminal part of the n - loop region have interaction with the secret domain .
it suggests that although the secret domain does not directly block the most important receptor binding site on cx3cl1 ( i.e. the n - termini and critical hydrophobic residues of the n - loop ) , its binding is still close to the receptor binding site and bring steric hindrance to prevent efficient interaction with the receptor , which would provide a structural basis for the ability of the secret domain to inhibit cx3cl1 and ccl25 induced cell migration .
the previous study reporting the discovery of the secret domain has shown that it is capable of binding ccl28 , ccl25 , ccl20 , cxcl12 , cxcl13 , cxcl14 and xcl1 that are from the cc , cxc , and c classes .
we have shown here that it is also able to bind cx3cl1 , the only member in the cx3c class .
the ability of previous reported m3 to bind a subset of chemokines from all four classes is attributed to its structural plasticity ( i.e. the structural rearrangement of ntd and ctd ) and the use of flexible loops as primary contact sites for chemokines from different classes [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .
in comparison , the secret domain has a much smaller solvent exposed surface on the relatively rigid beta - sheet i to contact chemokines from four different classes , demanding the focus on more common amino acid motifs on chemokines .
in the secret / cx3cl1 complex structure , critical residues r44 and r47 for the complex formation are from the 40s loop , which can be regarded as hot - spot residues for the interaction .
the presence of basic residues in the 40s loop is also found in other chemokines bound by the secret domain .
the electrostatic complementary between the basic 40s loop of bound chemokine and acidic beta - sheet i surface of the secret domain would enable the secret domain to bind different chemokines , allowing some extent of conformational variation in the 40s loop .
there are two questions need to be answered in the future study : ( 1 ) why is the secret domain not able to bind other chemokines also with the presence of basic residues in the 40s loop ?
( 2 ) why is the binding affinity of the secret domain with cx3cl1 lower than with previous reported chemokines ?
sequence alignments of cx3cl1 , ccl28 , ccl25 , ccl20 , cxcl12 , cxcl13 , cxcl14 , and xcl1 did not reveal obvious conserved motifs in the 40s loop ( figure s8a in text s1 ) that are absent in chemokines unable to bind the secret domain .
previous nmr studies indicated that the flexibility of the n - loop is greater than the flexibility of other regions of chemokines ( excluding the n - and c - termini ) [ 51 ] .
only the c - terminal part of the n - loop of cx3cl1 is involved in the interaction with the secret domain .
due to the flexibility of the n - loop , it may more extensively participate in the interactions of ccl28 , ccl25 , ccl20 , cxcl12 , cxcl13 , cxcl14 and xcl1 with the secret domain , and the chemokine selectivity of the secret domain may also reside in the flexible n - loop region .
the definite and clear answers to these questions await future structural studies of the secret domain with chemokines from c , cc , and cxc classes .
besides crmb and crmd , genome analysis also identified other genes encoding secret domain containing proteins ( scps ) [ 30 ] .
the reported scps that bind to the same set of chemokines as crmb and crmd are cpxv v218 ( scp - 1 ) , ectv e12 ( scp - 2 ) , and ectv e184 ( scp - 3 ) [ 30 ] .
the primary sequence of the secret domain is much more conserved in crmb and crmd than in scp - 1 , scp - 2 , and scp - 3 ( figure s8b and s8c in text s1 ) .
among the fifteen residues in the secret domain of ectv crmd that have contacts with cx3cl1 in complex formation ( figure 4b and figure s8b in text s1 ) , seven of them are strictly conserved in crmb from varv and cpxv and crmd from ectv and cpxv , including important charged residues d167 and e169 ( figure s8b in text s1 ) .
another important charged residue d316 is conserved in crmd , but is replaced by arginine in cpxv crmb and serine in varv crmb ( figure s8b in text s1 ) .
residues interacting with cx3cl1 in the secret domain are not highly conserved in scp - 1 , scp - 2 , and scp - 3 ( figure s8c in text s1 ) .
this indicates that the binding of chemokines by these scp proteins may be different from the binding by the secret domain .

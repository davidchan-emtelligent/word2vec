background the distinction between the effective sirnas and the ineffective ones is in high demand for gene knockout technology .
to design effective sirnas , many approaches have been proposed .
those approaches attempt to classify the sirnas into effective and ineffective classes but they are difficult to decide the boundary between these two classes .
findings here , we try to split effective and ineffective sirnas into many smaller subclasses by rmp - mic ( the relative mean probabilities of sirnas with the mini - clusters algorithm ) .
the relative mean probabilities of sirnas are the modified arithmetic mean value of three probabilities , which come from three markov chain of effective sirnas .
the mini - clusters algorithm is a modified version of micro - cluster algorithm .
conclusions when the rmp - mic was applied to the experimental sirnas , the result shows that all effective sirnas can be identified correctly , and no more than 9 % ineffective sirnas are misidentified as effective ones .
we observed that the efficiency of those misidentified ineffective sirnas exceed 70 % , which is very closed to the used efficiency threshold. from the analysis of the sirnas data , we suggest that the mini - clusters algorithm with relative mean probabilities can provide new insights to the applications for distinguishing effective sirnas from ineffective ones .
findings rna interference ( rnai ) is a cellular process for sequence specific destruction of mrna [ 1 ] .
the broad mechanistic details for the pathway have been largely characterized .
long double - stranded rnas duplex or hairpin precursors are cleaved into small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) by the ribonuclease iii enzyme dicer .
the typical sirnas have a 19 - nucleotide paired region followed by a 2 - nucleotide 3 ' overhang [ 2 ] .
the sirnas are used to initiate rnai [ 3 - 6 ] .
therefore , the distinguishing the effective sirnas from the ineffective ones is in high demand for gene knockout technology .
in order to design effective sirnas , many computational approaches have been proposed [ 7 - 20 ] .
some approaches focus on finding the common features of effective sirnas , though they initially and intuitively provide guidelines for sirnas design , are far from satisfied due to low sensitivity and specificity [ 8,18 ] .
the other approaches are motivated by statistical learning theory , attempt to classify the sirnas into effective and ineffective classes .
although those two - class classifiers provide a promising way to screen potentially effective sirnas , it is difficult to decide the boundary between the two classes .
here , we use the set of effective sirnas to estimate distributions of three markov chains , where the order of three markov chain are 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .
each sirna obtain three probabilities from the distributions of three markov chains .
based on three probabilities of sirnas , we introduce a robust feature of sirnas , the relative mean probabilities , which is the modified arithmetic mean value of these three probabilities .
it should be noticed that the sirnas with similar relative mean probabilities have same efficacy ( effective / ineffective ) usually , most relative mean probabilities of effective sirnas exceed most ineffective ones .
however , there is no clear boundary between these two classes , so we give up the attempt of dichotomy .
we try to split these two classes into many smaller effective or ineffective subclasses , respectively .
thus , we distinguish effective sirnas from the ineffective ones by a mini - clusters algorithm , which adopted from [ 21 ]( see materials and methods ). by rmp - mic ( the relative mean probabilities with the mini - clusters ) , all effective sirnas can be identified correctly , and no more than than 9 % ineffective sirnas are misidentified as effective sirnas .
we observed that the efficiency of those misidentified ineffective sirnas exceed 70 % , which is very closed to the used efficiency threshold .
methods estimating distributions of sirnas the sirnas can be represented as an 19 - tuple of vector .
xi = ( xi1,xi2 ,... , xi19 ) is the i - th sirna where xij represents its j - th nucleotide .
effective sirnas are used to estimate qh , where qh is distribution of a h - order markov chain , h equals 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .
qh ( i ) is probability of the i - th sirna in qh. we use qh ( i )( h = 1,2,3 ) to construct q4 ( i ) , where ( 1 ) q4 ( i )= q1 ( i )+ q2 ( i )+ q3 ( i )[ q1 ( i )]+[ q2 ( i )]+[ q3 ( i )] , ( 2 ) qh ( i )= pr ( xi1 ... xih ) products = h + 119qh ( ij ) , ( 3 ) qh ( ij )= pr ( xis | xi ( j - h ),... , xi ( j - 1 )) .
if qh ( i ) exceed zero , [ qh ( i )] is 1 , otherwise [ qh ( i ) ] is zero .
q4 ( i ) name as relative mean probabilities of xi. it can be noticed that the sirnas with similar relative mean probabilities have alike efficiency usually .
mini - clusters algorithm based on the relative mean probabilities of sirnas , we distinguish effective sirnas from the ineffective ones by a mini - clusters algorithm , which adopted from [ 21 ] , a commonly used micro - cluster algorithm .
it is sketched as below .
define the distance between i - th and j - th sirnas as ( 4 ) dh ( i,j )=( qh ( i ) - qh ( j )) 2 .
we put the closest two elements in a cluster .
in subsequent steps , we examine the two closest elements not already in a cluster .
if either or both of these are closer to some element within a cluster , we put each element in the cluster to which it is closest , otherwise , we form a new cluster .
repeat this step until all sirnas have been put into a mini - cluster .
for the sirnas in testing set , we consider that their efficiency are unknown .
in the process of testing the sensitivity and specificity , a mini - cluster is considered as effective if it has an effective sirnas , and be considered as ineffective if all sirnas are ineffective , otherwise its efficacy is uncertain .
we denote effective , ineffective and uncertain mini - clusters as ( 5 ) a1,a2 ,... , au ; au + 1,au + 2 ,... , aa ; b1,b2 ,... , bb ; respectively .
define the distance of ai and bj as ( 6 ) dh ( ai,bj )= minuinai,vinbjdhs ( u,v ) .
if ( 7 ) dh ( ai1,bj )= mini = 1,2 ... , sdh ( ai,bj ) , the efficacy of bj is regarded as that of ai1 .
in other words , each uncertain mini - cluster is merged into the nearest determined ones .
availability testing the performance of mini - clusters to test the performance of rmp - mic , it was firstly applied to a simulation data .
the sequences of simulation data set belong to two groups x and y , each of them contains 5 nucleotides .
in order to simplify the problem , we assume the nucleotides are generated from different 1 - order markov chain , that is , the relative mean probabilities of sequences equal the probabilities of their 1 - order markov chain .
for x , the probabilities of u base and c base at position 1 are 0.75 and 0.25 , conditional probabilities of position 2 are ( 8 ) pr ( a | u )= 0.75,pr ( u | u )= 0.25,pr ( g | c )= 1 and others are zero .
at 3 - 5 position , we assume that all conditional probabilities are 0.25 .
for each sequence of y , we assume that ' u ' base at position 1 and ' a ' base at position 5 or ' c ' base at position 1 and ' g ' base at position 5 can not appear at the same time , nucleotides are random at other positions .
an illustrative example within the simulation data is shown in table 1 , which consists of 17 sequences .
these 17 sequences belong to two groups x and y . the two groups are of size 10 and 7 , respectively .
the relative mean probabilities of these 17 sequences are shown in table 1 .
for comparison , we also applied k - mean with euclidean to cluster all sequences into 2 cluster , where the distance between two sequences are euclidean distance of their mean probabilities .
the clustering results by two methods are shown in table 1 .

pi ( i = 2,3,4,5 ) is conditional probabilities of the i - th position .
q ( 4 ) is the the relative mean probabilities of sequences .
in table 1 , rmp - mic grouped these 17 sequences into 4 mini - clusters , sequences of each mini - clusters come from the same group .
the euclidean algorithm were clusters 7 sequences of cluster 1 incorrectly grouped in cluster 2 .
the reason may be that euclidean distance takes the difference between data points directly , it may be overly sensitive to the magnitude of changes to further test these methods , we applied it to a larger data set containing 1,000 samples .
results were similar to those observed for the smaller data set ( data not shown ) .
identifying results of the experimental sirnas the data set can be downloaded from http :// www.bioinf.seu.edu.cn / sirna / supplementary / index.htm .
it collects 3589 experimental validated sirnas from 9 publications [ 7,10 - 12,22 - 26 ] .
the efficiency threshold of sirna to be effective is 80 % .
according to this threshold , the data set has 582 effective sirnas and 3007 ineffective sirnas .
to validate the performance of q4 ( i ) with mini - clusters , we apply them to data set of experimental sirnas , where q4 ( i ) are estimated by all effective sirnas .
the identifying results are summarized in table 2 .
in fact , all effective sirnas are correctly identified and only 264 ineffective sirnas are misidentified into effective sirnas by q4 ( i ) with mini - cluster .
it should be noticed that when ineffective sirnas are misidentified into effective sirnas , its efficiency exceeds 70 % mostly .

sensitivity , the number of effective sirnas / 582 .
specificity , the number of effective sirnas / total number of cluster members .
for comparison , we applied the qhs ( i )( h = 1,2,3 ) with mini - clusters to the same data .
the k - mean with euclidean was also applied to cluster all sequences into 2 cluster , where the distance between two sequences are euclidean distance of their q4 ( i ) , the number of clusters is the same as the number of mini - clusters of q4 ( i ) .
the results are also summarized in table 2 .
these results show that all effective sirnas are correctly identified and 610 , 534 and 100 ineffective sirnas are misidentified with effective sirnas by q1 ( i ) , q2 ( i ) and q3 ( i ) with mini - cluster , respectively .
for comparison , the k - mean with euclidean was also applied to cluster all sequences into 2 cluster , where the distance between two sequences are euclidean distance of their q4 ( i ) , the number of clusters is the same as the number of mini - clusters of q4 ( i ) .
the results are also summarized in table 2 .
these result shows that all effective sirnas are correctly identified but 1006 ineffective sirnas are misidentified with effective sirnas .
to test the sensitivity and specificity of q4 ( i ) with mini - clusters , 80 % effective sirnas are chosen as training data set .
the sirnas of training data set are used to estimate q4 ( i ) .
to assure each sirna may be in test set , we construct 1,000 different training data set .
the results show that only 13 effective sirnas are incorrectly identified and 516 ineffective sirnas are misidentified with effective sirnas , where the number of the misidentified effective and ineffective sirnas are the mean values acquired from averaging across each training set .
the result shows that q4 ( i ) with mini - clusters is reliable for identifying effective sirnas .
however , when we use q3 ( i ) to substitute q4 ( i ) , only 18 % effective sirnas of training data set can identify correctly .
the reason may be that many q3 ( i ) of effective sirnas of training data set become zero .
it can result in which these effective sirnas are misidentified to ineffective sirnas .
however , even if q3 ( i ) of these effective sirnas are zero but their q1 ( i ) and q2 ( i ) may be very large , so their q4 ( i ) are also different with ineffective sirnas .
thus , they may construct new mini - clusters or enter into effective mini - clusters .
secondly , we randomly generate 1,0000 simulation sirnas .
a new data set of sirnas are formed by these 1,0000 simulation sirnas and 3587 experimental sirnas. by q4 ( i ) with mini - clusters , these 1,3587 sirnas are put into different mini - clusters , where 1587 simulation sirnas are put into effective mini - clusters , q4 ( i ) are estimated by all effective experimental sirnas .
the efficiency of these 1587 simulation sirnas are de novo validated by a web - server rfrcdb - sirna [ 27 ] , which is available at http :// www .
bioinf.seu.edu.cn / sirna / index.htm. by the web - server , 1536 simulation sirnas are identified as effective .
the result shows that effective sirnas should have specific features at some positions , and q4 ( i ) can incarnate these specific features .
identifying results of the shrnas to systematically analyze the interplay between nucleotide composition , shrna processing , and biologic activity , christof fellmann et al transduced the entire sensor library into human hek293t and chicken erc cells , generated and quantified small rna libraries designed to represent shrna intermediates after major biogenesis steps , which contains 18,720 shrnas [ 28 ] .
the efficiency threshold of shrna to be effective is that its score exceed 10 .
according to this threshold , the data set has 453 effective sirnas and 18267 ineffective sirnas .
the data set of shrnas can be downloaded from : http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3130540 /? tool = pubmed .
to validate the performance of q4 ( i ) with mini - clusters to distinguish effective shrnas , it is applied to data set of shrnas , where q4 ( i ) are estimated by all effective shrnas .
the identifying results shows that all effective shrnas are correctly identified and only 1446 ineffective shrnas are misidentified into effective shrnas by q4 ( i ) with mini - cluster .
it should be noticed that when ineffective shrnas are misidentified into effective shrnas , their efficiency are very closed to the effective threshold .
comparison to existing design algorithms to compare our results to existing sirna - based design tools , we obtained the top predictions for transcripts using three different algorithms [ 17 - 19 ] and compared them to the 50 highest scoring sensor - derived shrnas for gene .
strikingly , exceed 70 % of scoring shrnas were not identified in the top 50 predictions of any algorithm .
while such false negatives , in principle , may have little practical significance , the majority of algorithm - predicted shrnas did not score in the sensor assay , closely resembling their low validation rate in empirical testing .
together , these results demonstrate that sirna algorithms are poor at predicting potent shrnas [ 29 ] and underscore the value of the sensor approach .
requirements since effective sirnas have specific nucleotides at some position , it is reasonable to use relative mean probabilities as their feature indicator .
however , effective sirnas may have different relative mean probabilities , but the mini - clusters algorithm place sirnas with similar relative mean probabilities in the same mini - clusters .
in fact , relative mean probabilities can be viewed as specific probabilities of sirnas , so the absolute value of their logarithm can be regarded as entropies of sirnas .
since sirnas with similar relative mean probabilities are in the same mini - clusters , the deviance of efficiency of sirnas can be regarded as the difference in their entropies .
conclusions from the analysis of the sirnas data , we demonstrate that mini - clusters algorithm using q4 ( i ) are appropriate for analyzing sirnas data .
its success indicates that an effective algorithms for analyzing biological data must be based on an understanding of the biological nature of the experimental data .

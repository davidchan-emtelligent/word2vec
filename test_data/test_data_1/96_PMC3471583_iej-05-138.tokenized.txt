successful root canal treatment requires adequate knowledge regarding morphologic variations in root canal system of teeth .
this report describes a six - canalled mandibular first molar with four mesial root canals requiring endodontic retreatment .
the two additional canals in the mesial root were found during retreatment with the aid of illumination and magnification .
in conclusion , the possibility of atypical morphology and additional canals should never be overlooked .
first mandibular molar four root canal mesial root introduction one of the most important prerequisites for successful endodontic treatment is adequate knowledge and understanding of root canal anatomy .
numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated the root canal morphology of mandibular first molars .
most of them had two roots , with two canals in the mesial root and one canal or two canals in the distal root [ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ] .
the incidence of mesial roots with three root canals in mandibular molars has been reported to range between 1 - 15 % [ 3 ][ 4 ][ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ][ 8 ][ 9 ][ 10 ] .
very few articles have demonstrated four canals in the mesial root of mandibular first molars [ 11 ][ 12 ][ 13 ] .
this case report describes a six - canalled mandibular first molar with four canals in the mesial root , and two in the distal ; this tooth had previously received incomplete root canal treatment .
case report a 30 year old female with a non - contributory medical history was referred to our private office with severe spontaneous pain and tenderness to percussion in the right mandibular region .
the patient reported that the tooth # 30 had been root treated one month ago .
she had experienced localized swelling and pain since then .
clinical examination revealed extensive amalgam restoration in the mandibular molar ; however no swelling or sinus tract was present .
tooth # 30 was sensitive to palpation and percussion .
there was no mobility and probing did not reveal the presence of a periodontal pocket .
the adjacent teeth responded normally to thermal and electrical pulp testing , and to palpation , and percussion .
radiographic examination revealed a large radiolucency associated with the mesial root of tooth # 30 ( figure 1a ) .
a diagnosis of secondary or exacerbating apical periodontitis associated with incomplete root canal treatment was made .
therefore , endodontic re - treatment was indicated .
figure 1 a ) preoperative radiograph b ) four root canal orifices can be observed : mesiobuccal 1 ( mb1 ) , mesiobuccal 2 ( mb2 ) , mesiolingual 1 ( ml1 ) , and mesiolingual 2 ( ml2 ) c ) four gutta - percah master cones in four mesial canals d ) length confirmation of radiograph demonstrating four root canals in mesial root e ) a radiograph after completion of retreatment .
f ) postoperative radiograph showing four mesial canals in mesial root local anesthesia with inferior alveolar nerve block using lidocaine ( daroupakhsh , iran ) was performed .
after removing the coronal filling material and carious tooth structure , a prefabricated post was removed from the distal root .
the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam and an adequately sized access cavity preparation was created .
the floor of the pulp chamber was explored under magnification and illumination with the aid of a heine 2.5x hr binocular loupe and 3s led headlight ( r ) ( heine optotechnik gmbh & co. herrsching , germany ) .
two mesial and two distal root canal orifices had been inadequately treated during the first root canal treatment .
root filling materials were removed from the root canals with the aid of hand and rotary files .
the unusually wide space between the two mesial orifices clinically and the radiographic appearance of the root canals indicated possible additional canal ( s ) in the mesial root .
moreover , during exploration of the groove with a sharp explorer and file , a sticky groove was felt .
two additional canals were located between the two previously discovered mesial orifices ( figure 1b ) .
the working lengths of the root canals were determined using an electronic apex locator ( propex ( tm ) , dentsply maillefer , montigny le bretonneux , switzerland ) and were then confirmed with a digital radiography ( kodak rvg 5100 digital radiography system , eastman kodak co. , trophy radiology , marne - la - vallee , france ) .
root canal instrumentation was performed with protaper series ni - ti instruments ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) and edta gel ( md - chelcream , meta biomed co. , ltd. , cheongju city , chungbuk , korea ) .
the root canals were irrigated with 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite during instrumentation .
afterwards , the root canals were dressed with calcium hydroxide paste ( calcipex ii , nishika , shimonoseki , japan ) and coronally sealed with a temporary filling material ( zonalin , kemdent , uk ) .
at the next appointment ( after 10 days ) , the tooth was asymptomatic .
after completion of the chemomechanical preparation and radiographs with gutta - percha master cones ( figure 1c , figure 1d ) , the root canals were dried with paper points and obturated with laterally compacted gutta - percha ( meta biomed co. , ltd. , cheongju city , chungbuk , korea ) and ah26 sealer ( dentsply , detrey , konstanz , germany ) ( figure 1e , figure 1f ) .
coronal access was restored with a temporary filling material ( zonalin , kemdent , uk ) and the patient referred to another dentist for a coronal restoration and completion of the treatment .
at the 3 - months follow up examination , tooth # 30 was functional and asymptomatic , with no clinical signs .
there was radiographic evidence of periapical osseous healing ( figure 2 ) .
further follow up examinations were recommended for evaluation of treatment outcome .
figure 2 three - month follow up radiograph discussion thorough understanding about root canal morphology plays an important role in the success of root canal therapy .
anatomical variations in root canal system should be considered when exploring the floor of the pulp chamber .
multiple canals in the mesial root of mandibular molars have been reported in several cases [ 4 ][ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ][ 8 ][ 9 ] ; however only two reports have described four canals in the mesial root of mandibular first molars [ 11 ][ 13 ] .
reeh described an interesting retreatment case of a seven - canalled mandibular first molar with four canals in the mesial root and three canals in the distal root [ 11 ] .
kontakiotis and tzanetakis described four independent root canal orifices in the mesial root of a mandibular first molar with the aid of a dental operating microscope [ 13 ] .
exploration of the pulp floor groove under magnification and illumination revealed two further independent root canal openings between the already treated two mesial orifices .
the two buccal canals merged into one foramen ; the same was true for the two lingual canals ( i.e. a total of 2 foramina in the mesial root ) .
meticulous radiographic evaluation of the root and periodontal ligament outlines can help to predict unusual anatomy .
moreover , the use of a sharp explorer , as well as the additional methods such as troughing of the grooves with ultrasonic tips , magnification and illumination can assist to locate extra root canal orifices [ 14 ][ 15 ][ 16 ] .
conclusion in conclusion , although detecting extra canals in teeth with atypical internal anatomy is challenging , repeated attempts should be made to find all root canals .

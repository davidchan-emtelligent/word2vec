exercise may improve one 's perceived ability to control overeating related to negative emotions through psychological pathways such as reduced depression ; however , the volume required is unclear. methods .
severely obese women ( n = 88 ) participated in a 24 - week exercise and nutrition treatment incorporating self - regulatory skills training , and were assessed on depression , self - efficacy , self - regulatory skills usage , weight , and waist circumference , at baseline and treatment end. results .
subjects completing low - moderate ( 40 - 149.9 minutes / week ) and public health (>= 150 minutes / week ) volumes of exercise had significant and similar reductions in depression scores .
no significant changes were found for those completing < 40 minutes / week .
for all subjects aggregated , depression change was significantly related to change in self - efficacy to control emotional eating ; however , this relationship was completely mediated by changes in self - regulatory skill usage .
when changes in depression , self - efficacy , and self - regulatory skills usage were entered into multiple regression equations as predictors , only self - regulatory skill changes explained significant unique portions of the overall variance in weight and weight circumference change. discussion .
exercise of less than half the public health recommendation was associated with depression improvement , with no dose - response effect .
changes in depression , self - efficacy , and self - regulation may be salient variables to account for in behavioral weight - loss treatment research .
1. introduction a better understanding of the behavioral dynamics of overeating is required for more effective and efficient weight management intervention .
emotional eating , for example , is now a well - documented phenomenon [ 1 ] and may be most prevalent in females [ 2 ] .
it has , however , been difficult to directly measure and account for in weight - loss research [ 3 ] .
perceived ability / inability to control overeating when negative moods are present may be more effectively measured and has been associated with weight loss / gain [ 4 , 5 ] .
physical activity is the best predictor of maintained weight loss [ 6 , 7 ] .
however , research indicates that only a very small portion of weight lost is directly attributable to associated caloric expenditures [ 8 ] , which tend to be especially low in obese and deconditioned individuals initiating exercise [ 9 , 10 ] .
exercise is a type of physical activity that is planned and structured .
it is proposed that exercise - induced improvements in negative psychological states , such as depression , are a major factor in an association between physical activity , controlled eating , and weight loss [ 8 , 11 ] .
it is possible that exercise - induced reductions in depression are related to increased feelings of ability to control emotional eating ( self - efficacy for controlling emotional eating ) .
there remains a debate on the etiology of exercise - induced changes in depression [ 12 , 13 ] .
biochemical theories suggest that associated changes in endorphin , serotonin , and norepinephrine levels induce improvements ; thus , there would be a dose - response effect ( i.e. , more exercise - - more reduction in depression ) .
conversely , behavioral theories suggest that simply participating in a program of physical activity fosters self - efficacy to manage one 's self through barriers that lead to a generalized sense of well - being and improved mood .
studies have supported both positions .
for example , dunn and colleagues found that a minimum of 5 days / week of moderate cardiovascular exercise ( termed " public health dose ") over 12 weeks was required for a significant improvement in depression , with 3 days / week or less demonstrating no significant change [ 14 ] ; while annesi found that participation for as little as 2 or 3 days / week over 10 weeks , with 20 - 25 - minute or 15 - minute bouts at a moderate intensity , respectively , was associated with significant reductions in depression scores [ 15 ] , with a dose - response relationship not present .
because self - report data suggests that only 19 % and 27 % of overweight and obese women , respectively , in the u.s. maintain the public health dosage of at least 150 minutes / week ( e.g. , 5 days / week x 30 minutes per day of moderate physical activity ) [ 16 ] , yet 64 % are either overweight or obese [ 17 ] , this volume may present an adherence problem if included as a treatment component for weight loss .
exercise treatments with behavioral components may seek to improve self - regulatory and self - management skills that might carry over to confidence in controlled eating [ 18 ] , possibly through effectively dealing with negative emotions [ 8 ] .
thus , such self - regulation may serve to mediate a relationship between depression and self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present .
relative effects of changes in depression , self - efficacy , and self - regulation on weight and body composition , however , remain unknown .
thus , the following research questions required further investigation to improve weight - loss research , theory , and treatment .
what is the volume of exercise required to induce a significant reduction in measured depression ?
regardless of exercise volumes completed , are depression changes significantly associated with self - efficacy to control negative emotion - related overeating , and , if so , does self - regulatory skill usage mediate this relationship ?
regardless of exercise volumes completed , does change in depression alone , and / or changes in depression along with self - efficacy and self - regulation change , predict weight and waist circumference change ?
because of either a lack of related research or inconsistent findings , each of these concerns is given as a research question , without hypotheses .
hopefully , the mechanisms by which depression may be associated with weight change , and how exercise may best be used , could be clarified .
an exercise treatment based on social cognitive and self - efficacy theory was chosen because improvements in the psychological variables of interest would be focused upon .
severely obese women were recruited as subjects because they may be most affected by emotional eating when attempting weight loss .
2. methods 2.1 .
subjects women responded to advertisements in local newspapers for participation in research incorporating physical activity and nutrition instruction for weight loss .
requirements were age >= 21 years , body mass index ( bmi ) of 35 - 50 kg / m2 ( class 2 and 3 obesity ) , and no regular exercise reported (< 20 minutes / week ) in the previous year .
present or planned pregnancy and use of medication for weight loss or a psychiatric condition were causes for exclusion .
a written statement of adequate physical health to participate was required from a physician .
institutional review board approval and written consent from subjects was obtained .
the 88 subjects ( meanage = 41.9 , sd = 10.1 years ; meanbmi = 42.5 , sd = 6.2 kg / m2 ; racial makeup of 54 % white , 43 % african american , and 3 % of other races / ethnicities ) were mostly in the lower - middle to middle class .
2.2 .
measures the profile of mood states short form scale of depression [ 19 ] has 5 , 1 - word items ( e.g. , sad , gloomy ) that require responses from 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( extremely ) indicating , ".. .
how you have been feeling during the past week including today. " for women , chronbach 's alpha = . 95 , and test - retest reliability over 20 days was . 74 .
concurrent validity was demonstrated with a variety of accepted measures [ 19 ] .
the weight efficacy lifestyle scale subscale of negative emotions assesses self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present through 4 items ( e.g. , " i can resist eating when i have experienced failure ") [ 4 ] .
item responses range from 0 ( not confident ) to 9 ( very confident ) , with alpha = . 87 - . 88 [ 4 ] .
usage of self - regulation skills for appropriate eating was measured using a version of a scale by saelens and colleagues [ 20 ] .
consistent with guidelines , items were based on the content of the self - regulatory skills portion of the treatment .
responses to 10 items ranged from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( often ) ( e.g. , " i keep a record of my eating ," " i say positive things to myself about eating well ") .
internal consistency ( alpha = . 75 ) , test - retest reliability over 2 weeks (. 77 ) , and predictive validity were supported [ 21 ] .
for the present version , alpha = . 81 , and the test - retest reliability was . 74 , in pilot research .
a recently calibrated digital scale was used to measure weight ( kg ) , and a tape measure was used to measure waist circumference ( cm ) at the umbilicus .
changes were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the score at treatment end ( week 24 ) .
2.3 .
procedure participants received access to ymca wellness centers and were enrolled in a nutrition and exercise treatment based on tenets of social cognitive and self - efficacy theory .
the exercise support portion of the treatment consisted of 6 structured , 1 - on - 1 meetings of 45 - 60 minutes each , over 24 weeks .
it was supported by a previously tested computer program [ 22 ] .
instruction in an array of self - regulatory methods ( e.g. , long - and short - term goal setting with logging of incremental progress , thought - stopping and cognitive restructuring , stimulus control , self - reward , preparing for specific barriers , recovery from lapses ) was the primary focus .
cardiovascular exercise plans ( e.g. , modality , duration , and intensity ) were based on each subject 's preference and tolerance ; however , the volume suggested for health promotion ( 5 days x 30 minutes / week or 150 minutes / week ) [ 23 ] was described along with a statement that any volume of exercise may have benefit .
the nutrition portion of the treatment consisted of 6 structured , 1 - hour group sessions over the initial 12 weeks [ 24 ] .
components included ( 1 ) understanding macronutrients , ( 2 ) using the us food guide pyramid , ( 3 ) developing a plan for snacking , and ( 4 ) use of self - regulation skills .
the self - regulation skills addressed were similar to those in the exercise component , but were focused on managing eating behaviors .
subjects self - reported volumes of exercise completed immediately after each bout either at a kiosk at the ymca facility or elsewhere through the internet .
the electronic method used demonstrated reliability and predictive validity in previous research [ 8 ] .
fidelity of treatment protocols was monitored by ymca wellness administrators under the direction of a study investigator .
assessments were administered in a private area by certified wellness professionals at baseline and at treatment end .
2.4 .
data analyses for the initial analysis , subjects' mean weekly volumes of exercise completed over the course of the investigation were calculated .
subjects were grouped based on their being nonadherent (< 40 minutes / week ; n = 33 ) , or completing low - moderate ( 40 - 149.9 minutes / week ; n = 30 ) or the public health (>= 150 minutes / week ; n = 25 ) volumes of moderate - intensity exercise ( adjustments were made for the few cases where exercise was of a very low or high intensity over the course of the study ) .
in previous research , annesi [ 15 ] found what is being termed here as the " low - moderate " volume , and dunn and colleagues [ 14 ] found what is being termed the " public health " volume , as the minimum required to induce a significant reduction in depression .
a mixed - model repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) was calculated to assess if depression scores changed over the 24 - week treatment , and if those changes significantly differed by the 3 groupings of exercise volumes completed .
when a significant difference was identified , effect sizes were measured using partial eta squared ( eta p 2 ) where . 01 = small , . 06 = moderate , and . 14 = large effects .
for subsequent analyses , results from all 88 subjects were aggregated .
changes in depression , self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present ( weight efficacy lifestyle scale - - negative emotions subscale ) , self - regulatory skill use for eating , weight , and waist circumference were next calculated .
use of change scores , rather than scores at a single temporal point , has been suggested to best account for the dynamic nature of the weight - loss process and its predictors [ 25 ] .
actual scores , rather than scores adjusted for baseline values , were used to best account for changes associated with a naturally occurring range of initial scores in the present sample type .
this is consistent with previous related research when data are normally distributed and free from ceiling and floor effects [ 25 - 27 ] .
the linear bivariate relationship between changes in depression and self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present was then derived through regression analysis .
mediation analysis was then conducted to determine if changes in self - regulation for eating significantly mediated this relationship .
although methods are available to adapt data with nonnormal distributions for mediation analyses ( e.g. , bootstrapping ) [ 28 ] , the method proposed by baron and kenny [ 29 ] , utilizing the sobel test for mediation [ 30 ] , was appropriate here because a conservative approach for normal distributions was sought .
finally , 2 hierarchical multiple regression analyses were calculated .
in step 1 of the first equation , change in depression was entered as a predictor of weight change .
in step 2 , changes in self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present , and self - regulation for eating , were forced into the equation as additional predictors to determine if a significant increase in the explained variance in weight change occurred .
in the second multiple regression equation , change in waist circumference replaced weight change as the dependent variable .
an intention - to - treat design , that retained data from all the original subjects , was used with missing data ( 17 % of all cases ) imputed using the last - observation - carried - forward approach , which is common in similar research [ 27 , 31 ] .
statistical significance was set at alpha = . 05 ( 2 - tailed ) , with the bonferroni adjustment applied where appropriate .
analyses were conducted using spss version 15.0 .
3. results 3.1 .
preliminary analyses for all 88 subjects aggregated , significant improvements were found on all measures ( table 1 ) , and change scores in the 3 psychological measures that served as predictors of weight and waist circumference change were approximately normally distributed (< 3 se for skewness ; < 10 se for kurtosis ) [ 32 ] .
3.2 .
changes in psychological and physiological variables for depression scores , there was no significant difference between the non - adherent , low - moderate exercise volume , or public health exercise volume groups at baseline , f ( 2 , 85 ) = 1.91 , p = . 16 .
changes over 24 weeks were significant , f ( 1 , 85 ) = 9.66 , p = . 003 , eta p 2 = . 102 , and significantly differed by group , f ( 2 , 85 ) = 7.76 , p = . 001 , eta p 2 = 0.154 .
bonferroni follow - up tests indicated that both the groups of low - moderate and public health volumes of exercise demonstrated more reduction in depression than the non - adherent group , but their changes did not significantly differ from one another .
3.3 .
relation of changes in depression and self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present for all subjects aggregated , the relation between changes in depression and self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present ( path c ) was significant , beta = - . 30 , se = . 31 , p = . 01 .
change in self - regulation for eating was a significant mediator of this relationship ( z = 3.81 , p < . 001 ) , and reduced the original relationship to no longer being significant ( path c ' ; beta = - . 02 , se = . 30 , p = . 87 ) .
thus , complete mediation was observed .
within this mediation analysis , significant relationships were found between both changes in depression and self - regulation for eating ( path a ; beta = - . 50 , se = . 22 , p < . 001 ) and changes in self - regulation for eating and self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present ( path b ; beta = . 57 , se = . 13 , p < . 001 ) .
3.4 .
relations of change in depression with weight and weight circumference the relation of change in depression with weight change was significant ( table 2 ) .
stepping in changes in self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present , and self - regulation for eating , significantly strengthened the amount of variance in change in weight accounted for .
the relation of change in depression with waist circumference change was also significant ( table 2 ) .
stepping in changes in self - efficacy to control eating when negative emotions are present , and self - regulation for eating , also significantly increased the portion of the variance accounted for .
in both multiple regression equations , only change in self - regulation for eating significantly contributed uniquely to the explained variances ( table 2 ) .
4. discussion contrary to dunn and colleagues [ 14 ] , findings suggest that even a low - moderate volume of exercise ( e.g. , 2 days / week at a moderate duration and intensity ) , which is considerably less than the recommended public health volume of at least 150 minutes per week , is associated with a significant reduction in depression in severely obese women .
also , a dose - response effect was not found .
although biochemical theories were not directly tested and , thus , cannot be discounted , behavioral explanations consistent with social cognitive and self - efficacy theory were supported .
given the evidence that the public health dose of exercise is very difficult to maintain [ 17 ] , this finding is favorable for those affected by emotional eating and challenged with maintaining exercise when attempting weight loss .
the finding that the inverse relationship between depression and self - efficacy to control emotional eating was completely mediated by increased self - regulation skill use has practical implications .
for example , if an exercise program is supported by instruction in self - regulatory skills , these skills may carry over to feelings of control over overeating - - especially when negative emotions such as depression are a depleting factor .
while laboratory research overwhelmingly suggests that when 2 tasks are sequentially attempted , one 's self - regulation ability is diluted [ 33 ] , more recent findings intimate that when self - regulatory skills are specifically taught , they become stronger and more resilient for the second task ( such as with exercise and reduced calorie eating ) [ 34 ] .
hence , the premise that the primary value of exercise program participation for weight loss for obese persons is through the associated psychological changes ( rather than caloric expenditure ) [ 8 ] was supported .
the moderate ( but significant ) amount of the variance in changes in weight ( 12 %) and waist circumference ( 25 %) accounted for by changes in depression , self - efficacy , and self - regulation , suggests that there may be additional behavioral variables yet to be identified for incorporation into a stronger prediction model .
it is suggested that researchers extend this investigation to uncover such factors , especially ones that may be modifiable .
the present design of testing intervention effects on variables derived from behavioral theory , and then subsequently assessing associations of those changes with outcomes such as weight loss , is advocated for the future .
it allows for ongoing improvements of theory and treatment to be expedited in both a scientific and practical manner .
the addition of waist circumference change as an outcome measure was an advantage .
it is suggested that outcome measures in addition to body weight be used in treatment research that incorporates exercise because associated increases in lean muscle may distort effects on weight [ 35 ] .
several limitations of this research should be noted , however .
this study was conducted in a field setting , and thus subject to possible problems with internal validity .
for example , social support and expectation effects may have biased responses .
practical settings have , however , been strongly advocated because of their ease in generalizing findings to practice [ 36 ] .
still , the sample of severely obese women tested does not allow generalization of findings to men , adolescents , or women of an unhealthy but lower weight .
although post hoc selection of groups by exercise volume completed may be viewed as problematic , in reality , adherence to a program of physical activity is highly varied [ 22 ] .
as with previous weight - loss research [ 37 ] , treatment results may be most generalizable when subject variations are accommodated within research designs [ 36 ] .
replication and extension of the present research , including with a control group , is needed to address the poor results consistently found in the array of weight - management treatments presently available [ 38 ] .
conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in the study .

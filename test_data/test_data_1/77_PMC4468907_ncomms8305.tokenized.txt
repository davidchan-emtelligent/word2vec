the molecular mechanism that controls this uniformity is not well understood .
here we show that during mouse postnatal development the timed expression of rncr4 , a retina - specific long noncoding rna , regulates the similarly timed processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , which is repressed at an earlier developmental stage by rna helicase ddx3x .
shifting the timing of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation or interfering with ddx3x expression leads to the disorganization of retinal architecture , with the photoreceptor layer being most affected .
we identify crb1 , a component of the adhesion belt between glial and photoreceptor cells , as a link between rncr4 - regulated mirna metabolism and uniform retina layering .
our results suggest that the precise timing of glia - neuron interaction controlled by noncoding rnas and ddx3x is important for the even distribution of cells across layers .
the mammalian retina is a modular brain region , in which cell layers are of uniform thickness but the molecular mechanism controlling this process is not well understood .
here the authors identify a regulatory network consisting of the long noncoding rna rncr4 , rna helicase ddx3x and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 that controls the even distribution of cells across layers .
many regions of the brain , such as the cortex , cerebellum and retina , are built up of repeated circuit modules .
these modules have similar numbers of neurons , a feature that renders brain regions macroscopically uniform in appearance .
one of the most studied modular regions of the mammalian brain is the retina , in which circuits are organized as vertical topographic domains .
the cell bodies of the different cell types are also highly clustered , giving rise to so - called ' nuclear ' layers .
the first such layer is the photoreceptor layer comprising cell bodies of rod and cone photoreceptors , the second , so - called inner nuclear , layer consists of cell bodies of bipolar , amacrine , horizontal and muller cells , while the third layer , called ganglion cell layer , consists of ganglion and amacrine cell bodies .
the thickness of each layer in most species is remarkably uniform , suggesting that the allocation of cells to each vertical domain is tightly controlled .
however , the molecular mechanism controlling this process is not well understood .
at birth , mouse retina consists of a thick neuroblastic layer with immature rods and cones in the outer part .
the photoreceptor layer becomes separated from the inner nuclear layer by p10 .
at the time the eyes open at p13 - p14 , cell proliferation and programmed cell death are complete and the photoreceptor layer has reached its final , highly uniform thickness12 .
several genes have been shown to be necessary for uniform layer formation .
loss - of - function of the crumbs - homologue protein crb1 or atypical protein kinase c disturbs photoreceptor morphogenesis and leads to photoreceptor layer folding and disintegration3456 .
loss - of - function of the orphan nuclear receptor nr2e3 or the basic motif - leucine zipper transcription factor nrl leads to photoreceptor layer perturbation manifested by folds , whorls and pseudorosettes78 .
different classes of non - protein - coding rnas , including long noncoding rnas ( lncrnas ; > 200 nucleotides ) or micrornas ( mirnas ; ~ 21 - nucleotide long ) , are dynamically expressed in eukaryotes in a developmental - , tissue - or cell type - specific manner and control diverse biological processes .
lncrnas have no defined common mode of action and may regulate gene expression and protein synthesis via chromatin remodelling and control of transcription , as well as post - transcriptionally at the level of mrna editing , splicing , translation or degradation9 .
several specific highly expressed lncrnas are involved in retina development , but their mechanisms of action are largely unknown1011 .
knockdown or aberrantly timed expression of mouse miat ( also known as rncr2 - - retinal noncoding rna 2 ) , six3os1 , tug1 or vax2os lncrnas results in improper differentiation of photoreceptor progenitor cells and defects in cell type specification12131415 .
mirnas control gene expression post - transcriptionally by base pairing to target mrnas , causing inhibition of their translation as well as deadenylation and destabilization16 .
during biogenesis , the primary mirna transcripts , pri - mirnas , are trimmed by the drosha / dgcr8 complex into pre - mirnas , which are further processed by dicer into mature mirnas17 .
both the biogenesis and activity of mirnas are the subjects of sophisticated control involving numerous protein - protein and protein - rna interactions18 .
recently , lncrnas have also been shown to have an influence on mirnas' activity192021 and maturation22 .
the levels of one - third of retinal mirnas change significantly during development , suggesting their potential involvement in the modulation of tightly controlled retinal maturation232425 .
depletion of all or particular mirnas in developing mouse retina leads to aberrant photoreceptor layer architecture26 , improper cell specification27 , progressive photoreceptor degeneration262829 , functional defects28 or cell death30 .
a sensory - neuron - enriched mirna cluster composed of three mirnas ( mir - 183 , mir - 96 and mir - 182 ; collectively referred to as mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ) is predominantly expressed in mature photoreceptors23242931 to an extent modulated by different light regimes controlling processes of light / dark adaptation32 .
mir - 182 and mir - 183 are also important in the maintenance of cone outer segments and cone function in adult mice33 .
here we investigate the relationship between the expression of long and short noncoding rnas in photoreceptors during postnatal development .
we find that the accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 is delayed compared with pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
we identify lncrna rncr4 ( retinal noncoding rna 4 ) , expressed in maturing photoreceptors in the opposite direction to pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , as a factor stimulating pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing .
rncr4 modulates the activity of the dead - box rna helicase / atpase ddx3x , which acts as an inhibitor of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 maturation in early postnatal photoreceptors .
disrupting the timing of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 formation by enforcing early accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 leads to profound irregularities in the thickness of the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers .
we find crb1 , a protein involved in the formation and integrity of tight junctions between retinal muller glia and photoreceptors , to be regulated by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
on the basis of the similarity of the effects on the organization of the photoreceptor layer of crb1 knockout and forced early accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( refs 3 , 6 , 34 ) , we propose that rncr4 - regulated timing of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 metabolism controls the timed interaction of muller glia and photoreceptor cells , and that this interaction ensures the even cell distribution in photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers .
results similar patterns of rncr4 and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 expression the pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 gene is an intergenic unit located on mouse chromosome 6 between the two protein - coding genes ube2h and nrf1 .
inspection of the pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 locus revealed that lncrna rncr4 is transcribed in the opposite direction from a region upstream of the pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 gene ( fig. 1a ) .
reverse transcription quantitative - pcr ( rt - qpcr ) analysis of total rna from different mouse tissues revealed highly enriched rncr4 expression in the retina , similar to that of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( fig. 1b and supplementary fig. 1a,b ) .
moreover , as is the case of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( ref. 32 ) , rncr4 was predominantly expressed in photoreceptors compared with other retinal cell layers ( fig. 1b ) .
cell fractionation experiments performed with whole retina or the photoreceptor layer revealed the presence of rncr4 in rna isolated from both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions ( supplementary fig. 1c ) .
northern and 5'race ( rapid amplification of cloned / cdna ends ) analyses identified rncr4 as an ~ 1.9 - kb transcript ( in contrast to the 1.4 - kb genebank - annotated sequence , nr _ 038124 ; refs 35 , 36 ) and mapped a proximal transcription start site ~ 500 bp upstream of the annotated rncr4 5 ' - end ( supplementary fig. 1d,e ) .
rt - qpcr analysis of rncr4 expression in retinas at embryonic ( e ) days 14.5 , 16.5 and 18.5 and postnatal ( p ) days 5 , 10 , 16 and 28 revealed a pattern very similar to the accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
rncr4 and mature mirnas were present at very low levels at embryonic and p5 stages and both increased gradually through p10 - p28 ( fig. 1c,d ) .
since mir - 183 / 96 / 182 is predominantly expressed in photoreceptors2931 , we used laser - capture microscopy together with rt - qpcr to determine the time course of rncr4 and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation in isolated photoreceptor layers ( fig. 1e,f ) .
this analysis revealed developmental kinetics of accumulation similar to those obtained with whole retinas .
we conclude that rncr4 accumulates in retinal photoreceptors with developmental kinetics similar to those of sensory - neuron - enriched mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
rncr4 stimulates processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 the similar accumulation profiles of rncr4 and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 may arise in at least two different ways .
the accumulation of one could control accumulation of the other .
alternatively , the accumulation of both could be regulated by the same factors , for example , transcription factors influencing the expression of both rncr4 and pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
we investigated the relationship between rncr4 and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 expression first using hek293t cells , which do not endogenously express either mir - 183 / 96 / 182 or lncrna ( corresponding to rncr4 ) at appreciable levels .
the cells were co - transfected with plasmids expressing the central 5.5 - kb region of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( referred to as long ( l ) - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ) encoding all three mir - 183 / 96 / 182 mirnas and either rncr4 , or one of two further retinal lncrnas , vax2os1 or crxos ( ref. 10 ) as controls .
surprisingly , co - expression of rncr4 resulted in strongly enhanced processing of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
mature mirnas increased sixfold , while the level of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 significantly decreased , as determined using three sets of primers specific for individual pri - mirnas .
co - expression of vax2os1 or crxos1 rna had no effect on l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing ( fig. 1g ) .
the results with hek293t suggested that rncr4 has a stimulatory effect on the processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 rather than on the transcription of its gene .
to explore the link between rncr4 and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 biogenesis in a more physiological setting , we analysed the expression of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in the mouse retina during development and compared it with the accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and rncr4 .
notably , pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels in isolated retinas or laser - captured photoreceptor layers were already close to or at their maximum at p5 ( fig. 1h,i ) , that is , at the stage when the accumulation of both mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and rncr4 was just beginning ( fig. 1c - f ) .
while pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels decreased two - to threefold between p5 and p28 , mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and rncr4 increased during that time by ~ 10 - fold and 4 - to 10 - fold , respectively .
to determine whether the observed delay in accumulation of mature mirnas was specific to pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , we measured the levels of pri - mirnas and mature mirnas for neuronal mir - 128 and ubiquitously expressed mir - 16 in developing retina .
no delays in processing , similar to that seen for mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , were observed for mir - 128 or mir - 16 ( supplementary fig. 1f ) .
taken together , the results of these in vitro and in vivo experiments support a model in which rncr4 specifically stimulates conversion of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 to mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in developing photoreceptors .
the questions of the factor responsible for the delayed processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and the mechanism by which rncr4 contributes to the accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in the developing retina were then considered .
ddx3x inhibits pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing we hypothesized that pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing in the early postnatal retina is repressed by an inhibitor expressed in photoreceptors and that rncr4 interferes with this inhibitor function in late postnatal and adult photoreceptors .
the drosha / dgcr8 - containing ' microprocessor ' complex includes many accessory proteins acting as either positive or negative regulators of mirna biogenesis18 .
among the microprocessor complex components are three members of the dead - box family of rna - dependent atpases / helicases : ddx5 , ddx17 and ddx3x ( ref .
37 ) ; all these proteins are expressed in the retina ( fig. 2a ) .
we tested whether these dead - box proteins influence the biogenesis of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
plasmids expressing individual green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) - tagged proteins were transfected into hek293t cells together with a vector expressing l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
expression of ddx5 and ddx17 had no significant effect on l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing compared with the controls ( fig. 2b ) .
in contrast , expression of ddx3x had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the processing of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , resulting in a 10 - fold increase in pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and a concomitant 5 - fold decrease in mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels compared with controls .
moreover , short interfering rna ( sirna ) - mediated depletion of endogenous ddx3x in hek293t cells resulted in a markedly higher efficiency of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing , as manifested by increased accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and a decrease in pri - mirna levels compared with controls ( fig. 2c ) .
to determine whether atpase / helicase activity of ddx3x is required for inhibition of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing , we knocked down endogenously expressed ddx3x in hek293t cells by sirnas and expressed sirna - resistant ( sires ) ddx3x mutants bearing single amino - acid substitutions within the gkt ( motif i ; mutk230e ) and sat ( motif iii ; muts382l ) motifs .
these mutations are known to impair atpase and helicase functions of dead - box proteins , respectively3839 .
in hek293t cells depleted of endogenous ddx3x , neither of the overexpressed ddx3x mutants repressed l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing , while wild - type ddx3x efficiently rescued the repression ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
we conclude that ddx3x acts as a repressor of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing in transfected hek293t cells and that this function requires atpase / helicase activity of the protein .
we next tested whether endogenous ddx3x present in retinal extracts interacts with l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
immobilized l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 was incubated with cell lysates of retinas from p5 and p28 mice and the l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 - bound proteins were analysed using western blot analysis .
the rna pull - down experiment identified ddx3x as strongly bound and drosha and dgcr8 as weakly bound by l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 at p5 ( fig. 2d ) .
in contrast , l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 pulled down less ddx3x but more drosha and dgcr8 at p28 than at p5 .
pri - mir - 128 - 1 as a control associated with drosha and dgcr8 equally well at p5 and p28 but did not pull down ddx3x at either developmental time point ( fig. 2d ) .
the specific association of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 with ddx3x but not drosha / dgcr8 in extracts of the p5 retina suggested , as in hek293t cells , that ddx3x also inhibits pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing in the retina .
to test this further , we injected retinas at p0 with a self - complementary adeno - associated virus ( scaav ) expressing either two different ddx3x - specific or control short hairpin rnas ( shrnas ) , driven by the photoreceptor - specific mcar promoter40 ( fig. 2e ) .
use of scaav allowed efficient shrna expression already 3 days after injection compared with ~ 10 days for a regular aav41 .
the photoreceptor - specific knockdown of ddx3x resulted in a threefold decrease in pri - mirna and fivefold increase in mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels in photoreceptors of p5 and p10 retinas compared with control shrna .
at p16 , ddx3x knockdown increased mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels in photoreceptors by 1.5 - fold over the control ( fig. 2f,g ) .
we conclude that ddx3x acts as a repressor of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing in early postnatal photoreceptors .
rncr4 antagonizes effect of ddx3x on pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 having established that rncr4 acts as an activator and ddx3x as an inhibitor of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing , we investigated the mechanisms involved , first by studying the relationship between ddx3x and rncr4 in hek293t cells .
as indicated above , in hek293t cells depleted of endogenous ddx3x , expression of sires wild - type ddx3x but not its atpase / helicase mutants resulted in significant overaccumulation of co - expressed l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and a decrease in the level of mature mirnas ( see supplementary fig. 2 ) .
we now found that co - expression of wild - type ddx3x and rncr4 in hek293t cells resulted in strongly enhanced processing of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , with a significant fourfold increase in mature mirnas and a fivefold decrease in l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels compared with the controls ( fig. 3a ) .
the effect of rncr4 was specific since two other retinal lncrnas , vax2os1 and crxos1 , had no effect on l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing .
we conclude that rncr4 has the potential to antagonize the repressive effect of ddx3x on pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing .
to determine whether rncr4 interacts with ddx3x in the retina , we performed rna immunoprecipitation assays using an anti - ddx3x antibody and extracts from p10 and p28 retinas ; p28 retinas contain high levels of rncr4 but this rna is already present in a substantial amount at p10 ( figs 3b and 1c,e ) .
notably , rt - pcr identified rncr4 as an rna associated with ddx3x at p28 but much less so at p10 ( fig. 3b ) .
consistent with the results of previous rna pull - down assays ( see fig. 2d ) , rt - pcr also revealed a markedly higher association of ddx3x with pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in p10 than in p28 retinas ( fig. 3b ) .
taken together , our data indicate that rncr4 acts as an inhibitor of ddx3x while ddx3x represses pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing .
hence , by antagonizing the repressive effect of ddx3x , rncr4 is an activator of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing in late postnatal photoreceptors ( see discussion ) .
ddx3x is a target of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in photoreceptors computational predictions identified ddx3x mrna as a potential target of mir - 183 , mir - 96 and mir - 182 , bearing two conserved mirna - binding sites in the 3 ' - untranslated repeat ( utr ; supplementary fig. 3a ) , suggesting that mir - 183 / 96 / 182 may act as a feedback signal controlling ddx3x levels .
we used reporters with a firefly luciferase ( fl ) - coding sequence fused to the ddx3x 3 ' - utr , containing either wild - type or mutant mirna - binding sites , to test a potential inhibitory influence of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 on ddx3x mrna function .
compared with the pfl - ddx3x _ mut _ 3'utr reporter , fl activity of the pfl - ddx3x _ wt _ 3'utr reporter was strongly and significantly reduced by the mir - 183 / 96 / 182 mimics transfected into hek293t cells either individually or in combination ( supplementary fig. 3b ) .
we then asked whether mir - 183 / 96 / 182 inhibits ddx3x expression in photoreceptors in vivo .
to this end , we first performed western blot analysis using extracts of laser - dissected photoreceptor layers from p5 - p28 retinas .
the ddx3x protein level decreased gradually in photoreceptors between p5 and p28 ( supplementary fig. 3c ) , consistent with a gradual accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( see fig. 1f ) .
we then tested whether inhibition of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 activity in vivo increases ddx3x expression by injecting retinas at p0 with aav expressing a mir - 183 / 96 / 182 triple sponge and enhanced gfp ( egfp ) marker under the photoreceptor - specific mcar promoter ( supplementary fig. 3d ) .
the triple sponge was previously shown to effectively upregulate the investigated mir - 183 / 96 / 182 targets in mouse retina32 .
western blot analysis of protein extracts from the laser - dissected photoreceptors of p28 retina revealed that infection with aav - mcar - egfp - triple sponge resulted in a marked increase in ddx3x protein level compared with retina infected with the aav - mcar - egfp / control , indicating that ddx3x is also regulated by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in vivo ( supplementary fig. 3e ) .
interestingly , in p28 photoreceptors of the p0 sponge - infected retina , the increase in ddx3x had no significant impact on the efficiency of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing , as indicated by measurements of pri - and mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels ( supplementary fig. 3f ) .
possibly , in photoreceptors of the late postnatal or adult retina the ddx3x regulatory function in processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 is suppressed by abundantly expressed rncr4 .
alternatively , the ddx3x inhibitory effect on pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing may involve a further cofactor present in early postnatal but not late postnatal or adult photoreceptors .
taken together , our findings suggest that ddx3x and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 form a reciprocal - negative regulatory loop that mutually influences their levels and activities in developing photoreceptors .
premature mirna accumulation affects retina architecture the first indication of a possible biological role for the delay in the formation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in developing photoreceptors came from the examination of mice subjected to photoreceptor - specific knockdown of ddx3x at p0 .
this resulted in a significant increase in mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 levels already at p5 , that is , at a time when mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 are normally very low ( see fig. 2g ) .
analysis of p16 retinas from these mice revealed dramatic changes in retinal architecture , with the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers displaying a wavy appearance with large protrusions and valleys ( fig. 4a,b ) .
to investigate the cellular architecture of the ddx3x knockdown retina in more detail , we examined retinal sections using confocal microcopy .
in wild - type mice , the number of cell nuclei stacked within individual retinal layers is known to be uniform .
in the ddx3x knockdown retinas , the number of photoreceptor nuclei spanning the photoreceptor layer at p16 ranged from 6 to 18 compared with 10 - 11 nuclei in control retinas ( fig. 4c ) .
the width of the inner nuclear layer was also affected , with four to eight nuclei in the ddx3x - knockdown retina compared with five to six nuclei in the control ; however , on the basis of the observation that interplay between ncrnas and ddx3x occurs in photoreceptors , it is likely that the inner nuclear layer effect is a consequence of changes in organization of the photoreceptor layer .
architecture of inner plexiform and ganglion cell layers was not affected ( fig. 4b,e ; see also fig. 5d ) .
importantly , no significant changes were observed in the total numbers of different retinal cell types , in p16 ddx3x - knockdown retinas compared with the control , including rods ( counted nuclei stained with hoechst ) , cones ( stained for cone arrestin ) , starburst amacrine cells ( choline acetyltransferase ) , activated by light increments on bipolar cells ( protein kinase c ) and muller cells ( glutamine synthetase ; fig. 4d,e ) .
to test whether the increased variance in photoreceptor layer thickness in ddx3x - knockdown retina can be explained by premature formation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , we precociously induced mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation .
for this , we engineered a pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 form that is immune to ddx3x - mediated repression .
using hek293t cells , we tested several variants of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 containing terminal and / or internal deletions and identified a truncated 0.5 - kb - long version of l - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 termed t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 ( supplementary fig. 4a ) , which was not subject to inhibition even in cells overexpressing ddx3x ( supplementary fig. 4b ) .
we then injected retinas at p0 with scaavs expressing t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 under control of either ubiquitous ef1a or photoreceptor - specific mcar promoter ( fig. 5a and supplementary fig. 5a ) .
we have verified that the mcar promoter - driven expression was specific for postnatal photoreceptors at p5 , p10 and p16 ( supplementary fig. 5b ) .
we observed the scaav - dependent accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 already at p5 , consistent with the failure of ddx3x to repress t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in early postnatal retina ( fig. 5b and supplementary fig. 5c ) .
most importantly , we found that premature accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processed from t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 resulted in a phenotype similar to that seen in the early knockdown of ddx3x , with retinas at p10 and later having a wavy form with pronounced folds in the photoreceptor layer , as well as large regional variation in thickness ( fig. 5c,d and supplementary fig. 5d,e ) .
expression of t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in mature retina , following aav administration at p30 , produced no changes in the organization of the photoreceptor layer at p46 , despite a three - to fourfold increase in mir - 183 / 96 / 182 expression ( supplementary fig. 6 ) .
to evaluate the properties of the t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 - expressing retinas , we analysed rod - and cone - mediated photoresponses using a high - density microelectrode array at p16 ( ref. 42 ) .
we observed spiking responses across seven logarithmic units of intensity ( 1 - 106 photoisomerization per rod per second ( r */ s )) , including pure rod , rod - cone and pure cone - activating intensity ranges , suggesting proper activity of photoreceptors across a range of intensities ( supplementary fig. 7 ) .
we conclude that premature accumulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , brought about either by ddx3x knockdown or expression of constitutively processed t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , causes uneven distribution of cells within retinal photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers .
this aberrant cellular organization appears to have no major effect on the activity of photoreceptors .
premature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation inhibits crb1 expression we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the photoreceptor layer phenotype induced by aberrant timing of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation .
computational predictions identified crb1 as a potential target of mir - 183 and possibly also of mir - 182 and mir - 96 , since they contain seed regions related to that of mir - 183 .
at the apical site of the photoreceptor layer , an adhesion belt called an outer limiting membrane connects photoreceptors to muller cells6 .
notably , crb proteins are components of the outer limiting membrane6 , and crb1 gene knockout in mouse can cause photoreceptor layer changes similar to those we observed in retinas with precocious mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation3634 .
we asked whether crb1 mrna is a target of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 repression .
in hek293t cells , the activity of a pfl - crb1 _ wt _ 3'utr reporter , bearing a wild - type crb1 3'utr , was significantly reduced by a co - transfected mir - 183 mimic and less strongly reduced by mir - 96 and mir - 182 mimics compared with the reporter having mutations in the mir - 183 / 96 / 182 sites ( fig. 6a ) .
this suggested direct targeting of crb1 mrna by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
more significantly , western blot analysis of protein extracts of retinas isolated from mice infected at p0 with scaav - mcar - dsred - t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 revealed a marked decrease in crb1 protein at p5 , p10 and p16 compared with the controls ( fig. 6b ) .
levels of control proteins , including virus - encoded dsred and endogenous beta - tubulin , were unchanged .
furthermore , immunostaining of the p16 scaav - mcar - dsred - t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 - infected retina revealed a strong decrease in crb1 expression in the outer limiting membrane compared with the control retina ( fig. 6c ) .
our finding that the mcar promoter is only functional in photoreceptors ( supplementary fig. 5b ) is consistent with the expression of crb1 being post - transcriptionally regulated by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in these cells .
since the photoreceptor - specific expression of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 can control the level of crb1 of the outer limiting membrane ( fig. 6c ) , it appears that in the early postnatal retina the photoreceptors rather than muller cells3443 represent a main source of crb1 present in the membrane .
to determine whether integrity of the outer limiting membrane is modified by the precocious mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation , we examined by immunostaining the status of several proteins known to localize to the structure .
this analysis revealed either discontinuities ( staining for pals1 ) or diffused patterns ( staining for n - cadherin and beta - catenin ) in the scaav - mcar - dsred - t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 - infected retinas compared with controls ( fig. 6c ) .
the observed changes in the distribution of these proteins are likely a consequence of the decreased crb1 level .
taken together , the data show that targeting of crb1 mrna by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 prematurely accumulating in early postnatal photoreceptors results in a decrease in the crb1 protein level , which affects integrity of the outer limiting membrane in the developing retina .
discussion we have described a regulatory network consisting of lncrna rncr4 , rna helicase ddx3x and mir - 183 / 96 / 182 that controls the timing of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation in photoreceptors .
in this network , referred to as the ncrna - ddx3x network , ddx3x inhibits processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 to mature mirnas in early postnatal photoreceptors .
this block is lifted by rncr4 , which antagonizes the repressive effect of ddx3x .
the network incorporates a feedback loop in which mir - 183 / 96 / 182 targets ddx3x mrna .
perturbation of the network leads to large regional variation in the thickness of the photoreceptor layer , and likely secondarily , also of the adjacent inner nuclear layer .
below , we discuss possible mechanisms by which the three ncrna - ddx3x network components interact , and also a potential mechanism , which leads to the bulging of cells out from the retinal epithelium .
rncr4 is encoded by a region upstream of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and is transcribed in the opposite direction to pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
the indirect influence of rncr4 on the processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 by counteraction of the repressive effect of ddx3x represents a novel form of gene expression control by lncrnas .
other retina - specific lncrnas share promoter - regulatory elements with genes encoding homeodomain transcription factors , including six3 , pax6 , six6 , vax2 , otx2 , pax2 and rx. these lncrnas , however , operate in cis and regulate expression of their companion protein - coding genes via transcriptional facilitation or interference101135 .
the tight control of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 maturation in the retina by rncr4 may be just one example of a more widespread lncrna - dependent regulation of mirna processing .
in mice , a number of genes encoding non - retina - specific pri - mirnas are adjacent to genes expressing lncrnas ( for examples , see supplementary table 1 ) , suggesting that such ' companion ' lncrnas may also control mirna biogenesis in other tissues .
we found that rncr4 has no influence on pri - mirna processing in the absence of ddx3x , indicating that the rncr4 effect depends on the helicase - repressive function .
the effect also requires that ddx3x is catalytically proficient since mutations in its gkt and sat motifs eliminated the pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 repressor activity of the protein .
ddx3x is ubiquitously expressed and involved in various biological processes , including cell cycle progression and apoptosis , but also in cancer and the replication of human viruses3944 .
ddx3x catalyses rearrangements of the rna structure and participates in many aspects of rna function and metabolism , including mrna splicing , translation and rna transport3944 .
ddx3x has no apparent preferences for nucleotide sequence or composition but rather recognizes elements of rna secondary structure39 .
thus , ddx3x binding may modify the structure of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 such that it is no longer efficiently recognized and processed by the dgcr8 / drosha complex .
it is well documented that a particular form of junction between the double - stranded pri - mirna hairpin and its single - stranded rna flanks is important for efficient and accurate processing by dgcr8 / drosha4546 .
however , the junction structures at the base of pri - mirna hairpins are unlikely to be the main or only entry point for ddx3x binding .
such junction structures are present in t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , the extensively deleted form of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing to mature mirnas is not a subject of ddx3x - mediated repression , which suggests that elements other than junction structures within pri - mirna hairpins are important for initiating ddx3x binding .
in this context , it is important to note that ded1p , the yeast orthologue of ddx3x , has the potential to bind rna cooperatively , using multiple protomers for optimal rna unwinding3947 .
if ddx3x functions in a similar way , this may explain why it affects processing of all three pri - mirna hairpins present in pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
although ddx3x can directly interact with different proteins44 , given the observed specificity of regulation towards pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , it is unlikely that ddx3x binds to and modifies the dgcr8 / drosha complex ; such a situation would be expected to affect mirna maturation more globally .
it is possible that rncr4 interferes with the ddx3x / pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 interaction through base pairing or structural contacts with pri - mirna .
recently , lncrna uc.283 + a was shown to regulate mir - 195 maturation by base pairing to pri - mir - 195 and blocking its processing by drosha22 .
we did not find extensive complementarity regions between rncr4 and pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , suggesting that the assumed interactions involve structural rather than sequence determinants .
alternatively , both rnas may bind to ddx3x in distinct ways , competing for its activity .
there remains the possibility that additional factors participate in these regulatory events and that their activities are differentially affected by ddx3x and rncr4 .
further work will establish the molecular basis of the controlled processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 .
it will also be interesting to find out whether , apart from being an mirna source , the pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 transcript has other functions that would justify its early p5 expression .
lumayag et al.28 identified spliced forms of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 with the potential to encode short polypeptides ; however , their functions have not been investigated .
why would the precocious accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , in response to either ddx3x knockdown or t2 - pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 expression , lead to variability in the thickness of the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers ?
we suggest that crb1 , demonstrated here to be a target of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 in vitro and in vivo , forms one of the links between the mirna level and disruption of retinal architecture .
crb1 is known to be a component of the adhesion belt , in the outer limiting membrane , between muller glia and photoreceptor cells36 .
humans without crb1 develop retinitis pigmentosa and leber congenital amaurosis484950 .
most importantly , loss - of - function mutations in the crb1 gene are frequently associated with photoreceptor layer abnormalities346 similar to those we observed when mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulated precociously .
significantly , we found that precocious formation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 not only results in a dramatic decrease in crb1 but also , likely as a consequence of the crb1 changes , in altered distribution of several other components of the outer limiting membrane , compromising its structural integrity ( fig. 6c ) .
we postulate a model ( fig. 7 ) of how the developmentally timed regulation of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 and its target crb1 could contribute to uniform layer architecture in the retina .
in early photoreceptors , when mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 is not present , crb1 is expressed at a high level and ensures the formation of a strong adhesion belt between muller glia and photoreceptors .
during early postnatal development retinal cells continue to divide until ~ p6 ( ref .
1 ) and the inner plexiform layer thickens until p15 ( ref. 51 ) , which together exert a force on retinal cells .
the strong adhesion belt helps to keep retinal cells within a tight ' bag ' created by the inner and outer limiting membranes .
after retina layers reach their final thickness , the continued sealing of the space where retinal cells reside may limit the diffusion of important molecules and , therefore , the adhesion belt gradually weakens .
this weakening is due to the suppressed expression of crb1 by mir - 183 / 96 / 182 , which slowly starts to accumulate after p5 in response to rncr4 .
precocious accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 would lead to premature weakening of the outer limiting membrane barrier , resulting in a bag with a less robust wall .
groups of newly born cells would push against the weaker wall and bulge out to create large protrusions and , as a consequence , lead to the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layers of nonuniform thickness .

figure 7 a model summarizing the ncrna - ddx3x network controlling photoreceptor layer architecture .
in early postnatal photoreceptors , ddx3x helicase inhibits processing of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 to mature mirnas .
lack of mir - 183 / 96 / 182 allows high crb1 expression essential for establishment of a strong olm that in turn ensures that photoreceptor cells form a uniform layer .
the perturbation of the network by premature ddx3x depletion or precocious accumulation of mature mir - 183 / 96 / 182 decreases the crb1 expression , resulting in weakening of olm and , consequently , a large regional variation in the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and the adjacent inner nuclear layer ( not shown in the scheme ) .
in adults , rncr4 antagonizes the repressive effect of ddx3x on pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 what leads to high mir - 183 / 96 / 182 accumulation .
in addition , mir - 183 / 96 / 182 targets ddx3x , possibly leading to further potentiation of pri - mir - 183 / 96 / 182 processing .
at that stage , organization of the photoreceptor layer is fully established and decreased expression of crb1 and weakening of olm may facilitate transport of molecules through the limiting membrane .

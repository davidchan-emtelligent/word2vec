compendia of large - scale datasets made available in public repositories provide a precious opportunity to discover new biomedical phenomena and to fill gaps in our current knowledge .
in order to foster novel insights it is necessary to ensure that these data are made readily accessible to research investigators in an interpretable format .
here we make a curated , public , collection of transcriptome datasets relevant to human placenta biology available for further analysis and interpretation via an interactive data browsing interface .
we identified and retrieved a total of 24 datasets encompassing 759 transcriptome profiles associated with the development of the human placenta and associated pathologies from the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) and present them in a custom web - based application designed for interactive query and visualization of integrated large - scale datasets ( http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 / landing.gsp ) .
we also performed quality control checks using relevant biological markers .
multiple sample groupings and rank lists were subsequently created to facilitate data query and interpretation. via this interface , users can create web - links to customized graphical views which may be inserted into manuscripts for further dissemination , or e - mailed to collaborators for discussion .
the tool also enables users to browse a single gene across different projects , providing a mechanism for developing new perspectives on the role of a molecule of interest across multiple biological states .
the dataset collection we created here is available at : http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 .

introduction we aimed to make available via an interactive web - based application a collection of transcriptome datasets curated from the geo public repository for their relevance to human placental development and pathology .
the placenta is a fetal organ indispensable for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy .
it connects the fetus to the maternal uterine wall via the umbilical cord , supplies nutrients and oxygen to the fetus , allows elimination of fetal waste , protects it from maternal infections and produces various hormones required for maintaining pregnancy 1 .
the placental trophoblasts play critical roles for all of these activities by acting as an interface between fetus and mother 2 .
in early embryogenesis , trophoblasts are the first cells differentiating from the fertilized egg , and eventually fusing with each other : a process transforming the monolayer cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts 3 .
several morphological and biochemical changes occur during this fusion process throughout pregnancy ( known as trophoblast differentiation ) 4 to guarantee the development and appropriate functionality of the placenta 1 .
failure in placental formation , differentiation and function , particularly by trophoblast dysfunction , impacts fetal development and is associated with a wide range of pathologies , including gestational diabetes , hypertension , pre - eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) of the fetus 5 .
in addition , exposure of placenta to toxic compounds by a mother 's cigarette smoking alters the transcriptome of placental and fetal cells 6 .
indeed , maternal tobacco use causes various pregnancy - associated problems , including spontaneous fetal abortion , placental abruption , preterm birth , stillbirth , fetal growth restriction , and sudden infant death syndrome 6 , 7. with over 65,000 data deposited into the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) , a public repository for functional genomics data , it can be challenging to identify datasets relevant to a particular research area .
indeed , geo was primarily designed for the purpose of data archiving rather than data browsing and downstream analysis .
thus , we identified datasets from geo particularly relevant to our interest in the development and pathology of the human placenta and uploaded them to the custom web - based gene expression browser application ( gxb ) ( http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 / landing.gsp ) , which provides seamless access to the data .
gxb allows browsing and interactive visualization of large volumes of heterogeneous data .
it also provides access to rich contextual information essential for data interpretation , such as : detailed gene information , relevant literature , study design , and sample information .
in addition , the user can customize data plots by adding multiple layers of parameters , modify the sample order and generate links that can be shared via e - mail or used in future publications .
thus we provide a resource enabling browsing of datasets relevant to placental development and pathology that offers a unique opportunity to identify genes that play a role in placental development / differentiation and are commonly modulated in pregnancy - associated diseases .
material and methods 111 datasets , potentially relevant to the development and pathology of the human placenta , were identified in geo using the following search query : " homo sapiens [ organism ] and placenta [ desc ]" .
the majority of retrieved datasets were generated using illumina or affymetrix microarrays besides a few other commercial platforms .
the relevance of each one of the entries retreived with our query pertaining to " development and pathology of the human placenta " was assessed on a case - by - case basis .
this process included reading the ncbi 's geo - linked article and examining the list of samples profiled and their annotations as well as the study design .
we selected for studies using primary placenta cells , placenta tissue or trophoblast cell lines comparing a ) healthy with diseased samples or smoker vs. non - smoker or b ) placenta cells in different differentiation / gestational stages .
finally we retrieved 24 curated datasets encompassing 759 transcriptome profiles , including 22 datasets generated using primary placenta cells and 2 datasets generated using trophoblast cell lines .
among the 24 datasets , there are 18 studies comparing control vs. diseased / smoker placenta cells , and 6 investigating transcriptomic changes during placental development and / or trophoblast differentiation .
among the many noteworthy datasets , several stood out , such as an extensive study comparing the diseased placentas with pre - eclampsia or unexplained iugr vs. normal placentas ( gse24129 ) 8 .
the datasets that comprise our collection are listed in table 1 .

these files were then uploaded to the " placentaendocrinology " instance of gxb ( http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 ) , an interactive web - based application developed at the benaroya research institute , hosted on the amazon web services cloud 9 .
information about samples and study design was also uploaded .
samples were then grouped based on relevant study variables and genes were ranked based on specified group comparisons .
details of the gxb software are described in a recent publication 9 .
a tutorial for this software is also available online ( https :// gxb.benaroyaresearch.org / dm3 / tutorials.gsp # gxbtut ) .
gxb provides the user with a means to navigate and filter the dataset collection available at ( http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 ) .
briefly , the datasets of interest can be quickly identified either by filtering with the pre - existing criteria listed in the column located in the left side of the dataset navigation window or by entering a query term in the search box located at the top of the window .
clicking one of the studies listed in the dataset navigation window opens a viewer , which is designed to support interactive browsing and graphic representations of the data in an interpretable format .
this interface was developed to navigate ranked gene lists and to display expression results in a figure with a context - rich environment .
selecting a gene from the rank - ordered list located on the left side of the navigation window displays its expression values on the interactive plot .
the drop - down menus located directly above the graphical display provide the user the following functions : a ) exporting the created graph as a portable network graphics ( png ) image or a csv file for performing a separate analysis .
b ) changing ranking of genes in the list ; this function allows the user to manipulate the ways of ranking the genes depending on his / her interest , or to include only the genes selected based on specific biological interest .
c ) changing grouping of the samples ( by using " group set " button ) ; for example , the user can convert the groups created based on " cell type " to those on " disease type " .
d ) identifying individual samples within a group using categorical or continuous variables ( e.g. , mode of delivery , ethnic group and age ) .
e ) toggling between the bar chart view and a box plot view , with demonstration of the values as a single plot for each sample .
samples are split into different categories or groups whatever they are displayed in a bar chart or box plot .
f ) providing a color legend for sample groups .
g ) providing a color legend for the categorical information overlaid at the bottom of the graph .
h ) selection of categorical information that is to be overlaid at the bottom of the graph .
using this function , the user can display , for example , gender or smoking status , at the bottom of the figure .
the data without contextual information have no intrinsic utility .
it is therefore important to capture and display the context information in the graph , so that the viewer can interpret the data shown in the graph .
gxb provides functions for organizing the context information in the tabs located just above the graphical display .
the tabs can be hidden to make more room for graphs , or be reappeared by clicking the blue " show info panel " button located on the top right corner of the graphical display .
information on the genes selected from the list located in the left side of the graphical display is shown under the " gene " tab .
information on the study for the demonstrated dataset is available under the " study " tab .
detailed information of individual samples is provided under the " sample " tab .
rolling the mouse cursor over a sample in either the bar chart or box plot view while displaying the " sample " tab displays any clinical , demographic , or laboratory information available for that sample .
finally , the " downloads " tab allows the advanced users to retrieve the original data for further analysis using other softwares / tools .
it also provides all available sample annotation data along with the expression data .
other functionalities are provided under the " tools " drop - down menu located in the top right corner of the user interface .
some of the notable functionalities available through this menu include : a ) annotations , which provides access to all the ancillary information about the study , samples and dataset organized across different tabs ; b ) cross project view , which provides the ability to browse through all available studies while focusing on a the currently selected gene ; c ) copy link , which generates a mini - url encapsulating information about the display settings in use and that can be saved and shared with others ( clicking on the envelope icon on the toolbar inserts the url in an email message via the local email client ) ; d ) chart options , which gives user the option to customize chart labels .
dataset validation we performed quality control checks on the datasets loaded on gxb by validating the expression of placental marker genes .
specifically , we used placenta specific 1 ( plac1 ) 10 and human placental lactogen ( csh1 ) 11 ( table 1 ) .
as expected , all samples from the datasets we incorporated in our collection expressed these two placental markers ( hyperlinked for easy access in table 1 ) , except some samples in gse12216 , gse28551 and gse10588 , where csh1 was not measured .
gender specific expression of the xist transcript ( in the samples for which sex information was available ) was also examined to determine its concordance with demographic information provided with the geo datasets ( table 1 ) .
an overall accordance of a high xist expression in female samples compared to a low xist expression in male samples was determined in our entire dataset collection ( table 1 ) .
based on our experience , concordance should be close to 100 % .
levels of concordance closer to 50 % , which were not observed here , would indicate a potential error with handling of samples during processing that may dramatically affect data analysis and interpretation ( e.g. plate inversion ) .
we also verified and compared the differential expression using the fold change values obtained from gxb or the original manuscript .
for this verification process , two datasets were selected gse24129 and gse30032 .
as shown in figure 1 , fold change values obtained from gxb correlate with those obtained from the original published article .
figure 1 .
verification of differential gene expression ( fold changes ) in gxb compared to the values published in the originating manuscript .
two datasets were selected for validation of differential expression : gse24129 ( a ) and gse 30032 ( b ) .
the first 8 genes were selected from table 2 in nishizawa et al .
( for gse24129 ) and from supplemental material table in votavova et al .
( for gse30032 ) .

6 4 2016 version 1recommendationapprove the authors of this article have collected several gene expression datasets , related with the development of the human placenta and associated pathologies , from the public database gene expression omnibus ( geo ) to analyze them in the context of a web application known as gene expression browser ( gxb ) platform .
this web tool provides a graphical interface to search and visualize gene status across different datasets .
the collection of datasets presented on this article makes this platform particularly useful to gather information about transcriptome profiles related to human placenta and associated pathologies .
undoubtedly , this tool allows fast searching of a gene of interest on those datasets , which could facilitate visualization of results from the corresponding studies and helps in manuscripts or grants writing .
there is no information on this manuscript about the statistical analysis followed to rank the genes on each dataset but it refers to the publication that details the gxb software 1 .
here , it is specified that genes are ranked according their differential expression using the limma package , and the links to the r scripts are showed .
however , the application should include the information about the normalization / background correction methods used on each dataset .
different methods could yield different expression measures 2 and so modify the gene ranking .
also , comparisons of gene expression across studies could be a powerful feature of this program , but for that is necessary to apply a method to remove batch effects .
another suggestion is to extend the verification of the datasets including genes that are known to be deregulated in placental pathologies - - such as lep up - regulation in preeclamptic placenta 3 , 4 - - . an explanation about these genes along with graphs obtained from the web application could be useful for the reader as an example of its utility .
finally , the application should include the date of the last update .
obviously , new placenta - related datasets might be uploaded into the geo database and so they should be added to the collection .
i have read this submission .
i believe that i have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard .

i have read this submission .
i believe that i have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard , however i have significant reservations , as outlined above .

2 5 2016 the web based utility is well assembled and easy to navigate and have very nice layout and graphic capabilities .
a large spectrum of rna microarray human placental sample sets have been assembled .
reservations are : 1 .
the verification of the datasets using csh1 and plac1 is rather minimal .
can you verify the differential expression observed in the originating manuscripts ?
at least in a couple of examples , such as one smoking and one preeclampsia / iugr .
figures with examples graphics from these validations could be helpful .
we included a new figure ( new figure 1 ) showing the verification of differential gene expression in gxb compared to the values published in the originating manuscript .
we also included the following paragraph in the " dataset validation " section of the manuscript : " we also verified and compared the differential expression using the fold change values obtained from gxb or the original manuscript .
for this verification process , two datasets were selected gse24129 and gse30032 .
as shown in figure 1 , fold change values obtained from gxb correlate with those obtained from the original published article . "
2. in many sample sets there exist batch effects .
in some cases the depositors have identified the batches , but have not corrected for these , in other cases batches can be observed even when not formally identified by the depositor .
for maximum utility these effects should be removed or a tool supplied to identify and remove them .
further to the need for batch correction , viewing a gene across multiple uncorrected / non - normalized data sets is not very informative .
the reviewer raises an important point .
batch effects resulting in non - biological experimental variation across multiple batches of microarray experiments have been well documented .
several methods are available to correct for batch effects , such as combat in ' r ' ( http :// www.r - project.org /) .
in the context of a dataset compendium batch effects should be considered at two different levels : a ) within datasets : unfortunately batch - processing information is available for only a small minority of datasets deposited in geo ( 6 % in the case of our " placental endocrinology " dataset collection ) , which makes systematically correcting for such effects impossible .
this limitation of course affects any investigator inclined to use geo as a resource .
the practice of randomizing groups across runs , which avoids having batch effects confounding the analysis , is fortunately widely accepted .
but it cannot be altogether discounted .
however , this is where one of the distinct advantage of working with a compendium of dataset comes into play : a conclusion regarding differential expression of a given gene can be based on observation of such differences in not just one but multiple datasets , obtained independently by different investigators , in different parts of the world , using different array platforms .
the conclusions that can be thus derived are especially robust .
this point is illustrated by one of our recent contribution to f1000research : http :// f1000research.com / articles / 4 - 89 / v1 b ) across datasets : we have previously implemented strategies for meta - analyses per - se , focusing on blood transcriptome data , and found it necessary to reduce the information from each dataset to p - values ( comparison within each dataset of cases to a control group ; 17724127 , 16461797 ) or co - clustering information ( module repertoire analyses 24662387 ) .
while gxb is primarily designed as a data browser it is possible to employ it similarly ( but with added flexibility ) for " meta - interpretation " ( rather than meta - analysis ) .
this consists in interpreting findings for a given gene across tens or hundreds of datasets , thus affording a unique perspective to the investigators and an effective means to identify and address knowledge gaps .
this again is illustrated in the article mentioned above : http :// f1000research.com / articles / 4 - 89 / v1 .
notably , the cross - project view functionality also provides an independent search for datasets with genes that have a certain fold - changes above a chosen threshold .
3. the web utility was frequently unavailable during the review process .
a more stable platform or redundant server system should be established to limit the down time of this application .
what user load can the server handle , how many concurrent users can the server handle ?
we thank the reviewer for this critical feedback .
our instance was created on the amazon elastic compute cloud ( amazon web services ) .
the downtime was not due to the gxb application per se but rather to some missing packages related to the tomcat server .
these packages have been fixed and the downtime issue is now resolved .
the number of concurrent users is configurable and it is related to tomcat web server .
the current configuration is 200 concurrent users .
this can be reconfigured as needed .
4. only transcription arrays are used in the assembled data sets , there are numerous data sets involving dna methylation , micrornas and protein .
incorporation of these data sets would create a true systems level database of the human placenta .
these are great ideas .
we are currently working on the interactive web application ( gxb ) to be able to expand to other platforms such as working on somalogic data etc .
we do see the establishment of our instance as an ongoing project , where additional datasets can be uploaded on demand ( see " request to load a sample set " function on the upper right corner of the web application page < http :// placentalendocrinology.gxbsidra.org / dm3 / genebrowser / list >) , for example when new datasets are published and deposited , and according to advances in our gxb technology .
5. improved utility would come from enabling merging of multiple datasets to perform meta analysis of aggregate analysis .
this would require the installation of a batch corrections scheme or method / s. we agree with the reviewer 's point of view .
however , it is a difficult problem to address at the gene level .
we are currently working on approaches and tools involving those modular repertoires ( please see chaussabel d. et al. 2008 immunology 29:150 - 64 and chaussabel d .
& baldwin n .
2014 nat rev immunol .
14:271 - 80 ) .
see also our comments above pertaining to the point raised earlier regarding batch correction .
6. there is also a growing resource of sequencing based data sets that have been neglected in this application / manuscript .
once converted into a table of gene expression / counts , it should not be too challenging to incorporate these datasets as well .
we agree that it would be very valuable to include rnaseq datasets in the future .
we are not at this time in measure to accommodate this data type routinely but as a proof of principle a trial rna - seq dataset have been setup to display rna - seq profiles of immune cell subsets isolated from subjects with a wide range of diseases ( gse60424 , https :// gxb.benaroyaresearch.org / dm3 / genebrowser / show / 396 , http :// journals.plos.org / plosone / article ? id = 10.1371 / journal.pone.0109760 ) .
7. user training could be improved with additional figures to support descriptions of the utility and data sets .
better would be a vignette containing worked examples of the different types of analyses to generate the table and figures discussed in the paper .
similar worked vignette examples are frequently found in r libraries .
indeed , thank you for suggesting this .
we started working on a ' user training ' document with detailed , step - by - step descriptions .
this document will be published in the collective data access channel of f1000research very soon .

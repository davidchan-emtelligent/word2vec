we report here the first whole - genome shotgun sequence of pseudomonas viridiflava strain uasws38 , a bacterium species pathogenic to the biological model plant arabidopsis thaliana but also usable as a biological control agent and thus of great scientific interest for understanding the genetics of plant - microbe interactions .
cover - datejanuary / february 2013access - typefree genome announcement pseudomonas viridiflava is a pectinolytic bacterium member of the pseudomonas syringae group ( 1 ) .
it is pathogenic to numerous cultivated crops and weeds ( 2 ) , including arabidopsis thaliana , in which it induces both compatible ( disease ) and incompatible ( resistance ) responses ( 3 ) .
for this reason , it has triggered much interest in plant - microbe interaction studies in a. thaliana ( 4 , 5 ) .
pathogenicity genes and mechanisms are becoming increasingly well - known , and 2 paralogous pathogenicity islands ( t - pai and s - pai ) , which share many gene homologs , have been described for p. viridiflava ( 6 , 7 ). p. viridiflava was shown to display a high level of genetic variation worldwide , with all isolated p. viridiflava strains parting into two distinct and deeply diverged clades , with evidence of frequent recombination but little geographic differentiation ( 4 , 5 ) .
these 2 distinct clades cause disease symptoms of differing severities .
this bacterium is an antimycotic producer that is usable in biological control against other plant pathogens ( 8 ) , and this strain was evaluated as a biological control agent against postharvest disease of pip fruits ( 9 ) .
the p. viridiflava strain uasws0038 was isolated in our lab from a phytophthora sp .
- infected rhododendron leaf .
axenic isolates were submitted to dna extraction according to a modified dna extraction micromethod ( 10 ) .
whole - genome shotgun sequencing of the p. viridiflava strain uasws0038 was then carried out in an iilumina genome analyzer ii , producing 6,317,750 paired - end reads that were 36 bp long and 8,441,093 single reads that were 35 bp long .
assembly was carried out with abyss 1.3.4 ( 11 ) .
this led to 201 contigs , for a genome length of 5,910,810 bp , and yielded a contig n50 of 48,957 .
this assembly was run in rast 4.0 ( 12 ) .
rapid annotation using subsystem technology ( rast ) analysis identified 66 rna genes and 5,340 coding dna sequences , of which more than half could be allocated a function .
it is estimated that there are approximately 46 missing genes .
annotation was carried out upon submission using the prokaryotic genomes automatic annotation pipeline group ( pgaapg ) .
regarding nitrogen metabolism , this strain is equipped for nitrate and nitrite ammonification and for ammonium assimilation .
an amidase - urea - nitrile hydratase cluster would allow strain uasws0038 to utilize monocarboxylic acid amide , formamide , urea , and nitriles .
this strain also contains genes conferring resistance to semimetals and metals , such as arsenic , chromium , copper , cobalt , zinc , and cadmium .
no plasmid sequence was found , but a complete prophage genome was detected .
uasws0038 also has genes involved in lysozyme inhibition , a multidrug resistance tripartite typical of gram - negative bacteria , multidrug resistance efflux pumps , a multidrug efflux system , and streptomycin and fluoroquinolone resistance , as well as beta - lactamase synthesis .
the strain displays a few secretory protein genes , such as hrpf , hrps hrpz , and hrpw , but no complete pathogenicity islands were found that would make this strain usable as a biological agent .
in - depth study of the genome of p. viridiflava strain uasws0038 and comparisons to the genomes of pathogenic strains would help to elucidate the mechanisms of coevolution in natural plant - pathogen interactions .

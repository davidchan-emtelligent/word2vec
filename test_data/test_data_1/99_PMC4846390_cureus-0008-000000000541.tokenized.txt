methods : 1,400 patients who were treated between 1998 and 2007 and had breast - conserving surgery ( bcs ) for early breast cancer ( ct1 - 2 / n0 - 1 / m0 ) were evaluated .
demographic and pathologic parameters , radiologic data , treatment , and follow - up related features of the patients were recorded .
results : 53 patients ( 3.8 %) had ibtr after bcs within a median follow - up of 70 months .
the mean age was 45.7 years ( range , 27 - 87 years ) , and 22 patients ( 41.5 %) were younger than 40 years .
33 patients ( 62.3 %) had true recurrence ( tr ) and 20 were classified as new primary ( np ) .
the median time to recurrence was shorter in tr group than in np group ( 37.0 ( 6 - 216 ) and 47.5 ( 11 - 192 ) months respectively ; p = 0.338 ) .
progesterone receptor positivity was significantly higher in the np group ( p = 0.005 ) .
the overall 5 - year survival rate in the np group ( 95.0 %) was significantly higher than that of the tr group ( 74.7 % , p < 0.033 ) .
multivariate analysis showed that younger age (< 40 years ) , large tumor size (> 20 mm ) , high grade tumor and triple - negative molecular phenotype along with developing tr negatively affected overall survival ( hazard ratios were 4.2 ( ci 0.98 - 22.76 ) , 4.6 ( ci 1.07 - 13.03 ) , 4.0 ( ci 0.68 - 46.10 ) , 6.5 ( ci 0.03 - 0.68 ) , and 6.5 ( ci 0.02 - 0.80 ) respectively , p < 0.05 ) .
conclusions : most of the local recurrences after bcs in our study were true recurrences , which resulted in a poorer outcome as compared to new primary tumors .
moreover , younger age (< 40 ) , large tumor size (> 2 cm ) , high grade , triple negative phenotype , and having true recurrence were identified as independent prognostic factors with a negative impact on overall survival in this dataset of patients with recurrent breast cancer .
in conjunction with a more intensive follow - up program , the role of adjuvant therapy strategies should be explored further in young patients with large and high - risk tumors to reduce the risk of tr. breast cancer ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence breast conserving surgery the content published in cureus is the result of clinical experience and / or research by independent individuals or organizations .

introduction as a result of earlier detection of cancer with the wide use of mammographic screening and increased awareness of breast cancer , the number of patients who undergo breast - conserving surgery ( bcs ) has significantly increased , yielding comparable outcomes to mastectomy [ 1 - 4 ] .
local recurrence rates have substantially decreased since modern radiotherapy techniques with boost treatment and new chemotherapeutic agents combined with bcs , substantiating the role of bcs as a valid alternative to mastectomy [ 3 , 5 - 8 ] .
however , presence of positive surgical margin , lymphovascular invasion ( lvi ) , extensive intraductal component ( eic ) , young age at first presentation , and high histologic grade ( hg ) are still known to be prognostic factors that increase the risk of local recurrence and consequently require more intensive pre - operative radiologic studies to select patients for bcs [ 9 - 14 ] .
the incidence of local recurrences that can be classified as true recurrences or new primary tumors is reported to be between 3 - 5 % [ 10 , 15 - 16 ] .
the histopathology of true recurrences shows features that have similarities to the primary tumor histopathology while also being close to the primary tumor bed .
true recurrence ( tr ) rates are reported to be around 62 % of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences ( ibtr ) [ 17 ] .
new primary ( np ) tumors are classified as ibtr which are localized beyond the primary tumor 's site and have different histopathologic characteristics .
np tumors were shown to have a better prognosis with a 5 - year survival of around 91 % , whereas while tr tumors had a 76 % 5 - year survival [ 3 , 17 - 19 ] .
the aim of this study was to analyze the clinical data of patients who developed local recurrence after bcs , the clinical characteristics related to tr and np , as well as the prognostic factors that had an impact on survival in these two distinct subgroups .
materials and methods among 1400 patients who underwent bcs with subsequent radiotherapy at the istanbul florence nightingale hospital breast center between 1998 and 2007 , 53 patients who developed ibtr were included in the study .
patients who underwent bcs without radiotherapy , patients who had pure ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) , patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy , and those who developed synchronous contralateral breast tumor recurrences or systemic metastases were excluded from the study .
this study was approved by the bilim university ethical committee .
demographic data , radiologic and pathologic findings including tumor size , receptor status , histologic grade , presence of intraductal component , molecular subtypes , axillary involvement , as well as details on local and systemic treatments , and recurrence type of the 53 patients included in this data set were retrieved from patient files and evaluated for correlations .
patients with ibtr were classified into two subgroups , the true recurrence group and the new primary group .
tr was defined as recurrence in the same quadrant as the primary tumor , with histologic characteristics similar to the primary tumor .
np was defined as recurrent tumors located in a different quadrant of the breast with different histopathologic features .
if a tumor had similar histopathologic properties but was located in the opposite quadrant it was accepted as new primary tumor .
patients underwent segmental mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and / or axillary lymph node dissection if the sentinel lymph node was positive for tumor involvement .
intra - operative frozen section diagnoses with touch imprints were done with re - excisions performed when necessary .
surgical margin status was stratified into two groups : 2 - 5 mm and > 5 mm. there was no surgical margin less than 2 mm. all patients completed their pre - planned , adjuvant radiotherapy program that mandated 50 gy irradiation to the whole breast with a boost dose 16 gy. patients received systemic treatment according to the recommendations made during tumor board discussions .
24 patients were given anthracycline +/ - taxane - based chemotherapy , and 3 patients received a cyclophosphamide - metotrexate - 5 - fluorouracil combination .
only 6 out of 10 patients who were her - 2 positive received trastuzumab in addition to conventional chemotherapeutics ( mostly taxane - based regimens ) because trastuzumab was not available before 2005 .
hormonal treatment was given to all patients who had positive estrogen receptor ( er ) and / or progesterone receptor ( pr ) .
molecular subtypes were defined in accordance with the st. gallen 's surrogate definition of intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer [ 20 ] .
luminal a subtypes were er - and pr - positive and her - 2 negative ; luminal b were er positive and / or pr positive and her - 2 negative with any ki - 67 , or was her - 2 positive with low ki - 67 ( under 14 %) .
histologic grade was used for verification when ki - 67 was not available .
patients were accepted as er - and pr - positive if receptor expression was > 1 % [ 21 ] .
patients who were hormone positive and her - 2 positive were classified as her - 2 positive luminal b , whereas those who were her - 2 positive and er / pr negative were classified as her - 2 positive .
patients who were er / pr and her - 2 negative were categorized within the triple negative group .
in cases when her - 2 was not available , re - staining and re - assessment were performed .
her - 2 positive status was indicated by evidence of protein overexpression on immunohistochemical ( ihc ) staining or gene amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) .
ihc overexpression with a score of 3 was accepted as positive .
borderline expression of score 2 was validated using fish .
statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 17 .
the variables were investigated using visual ( histograms , probability plots ) and analytical methods ( kolmogorov - smirnov / shapiro - wilk 's test ) to determine whether or not they were normally distributed .
descriptive analyses were presented using means and standard deviations for normally distributed variables .
parametric variables were analyzed using one - way anova test while non - parametric variables were investigated using mann - whitney u - test .
where appropriate , either a chi - square test or a fisher 's exact test ( when chi - square test assumptions do not hold due to low expected cell counts ) was used to assess proportions of nominal / ordinal variables in different groups .
we used time to progression ( relapse ) as an outcome to denote recurrences from the time of initial diagnosis to the first ibtr event and did not perform pfs analysis since both np and tr were accepted as events .
the overall 5 - year survival rate was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow - up or death for any reason , using the kaplan - meier analysis .
the univariate difference between the curves was assessed by the log rank test .
multivariate analyses were performed using proportional hazards cox regression model which included factors such as age , type of recurrence , molecular subtypes , tumor size , and grade .
a p - value of less than or equal to 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant .
results 53 patients ( 3.8 %) out of 1400 patients with locally recurrent disease were selected and included in the study .
the median follow - up duration was 70 months ( range : 8 - 288 months ) ; the median times to ibtr from initial diagnosis to occurrence of np and tr were 37.0 ( 6 - 216 mo ) and 47.5 ( 11 - 192 mo ) months , respectively ( p = 0.338 ) .
the deaths of all patients with ibtr were related to systemic spread of disease following recurrence .
22 patients ( 41.5 %) were aged less than 40 years .
33 patients ( 62.3 %) were premenopausal , and 15 patients ( 28.3 %) had a family history of breast cancer .
the most frequent tumor location was the upper outer quadrant of the breast ( 49.1 %) .
33 patients ( 62.3 %) had a tr , and 20 patients ( 37.7 %) had a new primary tumor ( table 1 ) .

there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of family history , menopausal status , age , or type of adjuvant treatment given ( table 1 ) .
local and systemic management of ibtr was also similar among both groups .
all ibtr events in patients who received trastuzumab were true local recurrences .

molecular subtype distribution is displayed in table 2 .
her - 2 and tnbc molecular subtypes were observed more frequently in the tr group , whereas the incidence of luminal a and b subtypes were higher in the np group .
there was no statistical significance among these subgroups regarding molecular subtypes .
however , pr positivity was significantly higher in the np group ( 55.0 % vs. 18.2 % , p = 0.005 ) .
table 2 shows the distribution of pathologic features of tumors between the tr and np. despite a trend for a higher rate of pn0 ( 85.0 % vs. 69.7 %) and lvi ( 65.0 % vs. 51.5 %) in patients with np tumors as compared to the tr group , none of these factors showed significant differences among the two subgroups .
tumor histologic type and size , hg and eic did not significantly differ between groups .
there was no significant difference among groups with regard to surgical margin width .
all surgical margins were clear of tumor ; more than 50 % of the tr group had a margin width of 2 - 5 mm , 55 % of the np group had margin widths of more than 5 mm ( p > 0.05 ) .
five - year overall survival ( os ) rate for patients with ipsilateral , local recurrence was 82.8 % .
overall survival was significantly higher in the np than in the tr group ( 95.0 % vs. 74.7 % respectively ) , p = 0.033 , figure 1 , table 1 ) .

bcs is now performed more frequently due to the implementation of wide population - based mammographic screening programs , development of modern radiotherapy techniques , and the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents [ 1 , 23 - 24 ] .
in turkey , the ratio of patients who were treated with bcs was estimated as 35 % in 2014 , which could be related to the low levels of breast cancer awareness in the population and absence of a nationwide mammographic screening program resulting in detection of larger size tumors at diagnosis [ 25 ] .
in our center , the overall bcs rate was determined as 68 % , which places our unit among the more experienced end in this regard .
the increasing rates of bcs have highlighted the need to identify factors that have impact on local recurrence [ 9 - 10 , 12 , 14 , 26 - 27 ] .
initial studies demonstrated that local recurrence rates after bcs were between 8 - 10 % through 6.5 - 8.5 years of median follow - up [ 3 , 21 ] .
recent retrospective review by van laar c et al. , and other studies showed a continuous decline in lr with reported rates in the range of 1 - 3 % in the last decade [ 10 , 15 - 17 , 27 ] .
these favorable rates could not only be attributed to improved surgical techniques and meticulous pathological evaluation , but also to improved adjuvant systemic and local management strategies .
in studies that investigated patterns of local recurrences , follow - up duration and median time to ipsilateral local recurrence were reported to range between 63 - 80 months and 36 - 88 months , respectively [ 3 , 15 , 17 , 26 , 28 - 29 ] .
panet - raymond et al. , in their study showed that development of local recurrence occurred much earlier during follow - up in the tr group ( 57.6 mo ) as compared to the np group ( 75.6 mo ) after bcs [ 30 ] .
similarly , smith et al. , reported that median time to relapse was 87.6 months for np and 44.4 months for tr , respectively [ 19 ] .
in our study , after a median follow - up period of 70 months these rates were 37.0 months ( 6 - 216 ) and 47.5 months ( 11 - 192 ) respectively .
similar to previous studies , the time to a tr was shorter in comparison to occurrence of an np in our group of patients , despite the lack of statistical significance among the two subgroups .
the definition of ipsilateral local recurrence after bcs depends on the location and histopathologic characteristics of the tumor .
in the study by fisher et al. , tr was defined as a secondary tumor that was located in the same quadrant or within 3 cm of the primary site [ 3 ] .
in other studies , ibtr was considered as tr when the secondary tumor was located in the same quadrant and also carried the same histologic features as the primary tumor [ 17 , 19 ] .
panet - raymond et al. , used a decision rule algorithm that exploited the tumor 's location , morphology , and molecular subtypes [ 30 ] .
in our study , we adopted the st. gallen criteria , with tr defined as ipsilateral local recurrence placed in the same quadrant as the primary tumor , showing the similar molecular phenotype [ 20 ] .
new primaries were considered as tumors detected in a different quadrant with different histopathologic characteristics .
in the study by huang et al. , the tr and np rates were 62 % and 38 % , respectively [ 17 ] .
comparable to data from similar studies , the ibtr distribution in our study was 62.3 % for tr , and 37.7 % for np [ 3 , 17 , 19 - 20 ] .
in patients who developed ipsilateral local recurrences after bcs , molecular subtypes have shown significant differences between tr and np. in previous studies where ibtr was not stratified to tr and np subgroups , it was found that luminal b , her2 - positive phenotype , and triple - negative subtypes had higher recurrence rates than luminal a subtypes [ 16 ] .
in our study , there were significantly more tumors with luminal b subtypes in the tr group as reflected by the low pr levels ( table 2 ) .
this finding is in concurrence with other studies showing that molecular phenotypes known to carry a worse prognosis are mostly found in the tr group [ 3 , 17 , 28 - 29 ] .
in these studies , luminal subtypes were observed more frequently in the np group with 77 % of tumors showing hormone receptor positivity , whereas patients with her2 positive and triple - negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) were more common in the tr group seen in 53 % of the whole patient group [ 3 , 17 ] .
our study showed a similar distribution with 65.0 % of the luminal phenotypes in np and 51.5 % of her2 and tnbc subtypes in tr. this finding is compatible with the more favorable natural history of the np group showing a longer time to recurrence of 47.5 months , as compared to tr , which has a more proliferative tumor biology as reflected by the low pr levels and the shorter time to relapse .
most studies have demonstrated that poor prognostic factors such as young age at diagnosis (< 40 years ) , high histologic grade , t2 tumor ( 20 - 50 mm ) , presence of lvi and eic (> 25 %) , and triple - negative molecular subtypes were highly correlated with worse survival in patients with tr [ 16 , 27 , 30 - 32 ] .
patients with tr were also shown to be associated with higher rates of lvi than those with np , reported as 29.5 % vs. 20.9 % , respectively [ 15 , 28 - 29 ] .
hattangadi - gluth et al. , demonstrated basal - like phenotypes were significantly associated with higher risk of local recurrence [ 33 ] .
our study also showed similar findings with higher hormone receptor positivity and lower hg rates in np as compared to the tr group .
higher hg together with younger age at first presentation , larger tumor size , and tnbc molecular subtype were found to be associated with worse survival .
we and others have shown that younger age at first diagnosis is a significant , independent risk factor affecting survival and local recurrence [ 33 - 34 ] .
nevertheless , our finding may be biased by the respectively higher incidence of young age at initial diagnosis observed in the turkish population .
in fact , a population - based screening program conducted by the turkish federation of breast diseases in 2014 by ozmen et al. , [ 25 ] has revealed that the percentage of patients younger than 40 was 17 % , scoring being higher than the global average and being lower than only african rates ( up to 30 %) .
consistently , in our study , 41 % of patients younger than 40 is comparably higher to that reported in similar studies ranging between 16 % and 27 % [ 10 , 12 , 30 ] .
node positivity , presence of lymphovascular invasion , and extensive intraductal component had no significant correlation with outcome in our study , which may have been caused by the limited sample size .
further and larger scale studies are required to evaluate the impact of these factors on survival .
development of ipsilateral local recurrence was related to a worse outcome in patients after bcs [ 35 - 36 ] .
the 12 - year os rate in patients after bcs was 72 % .
however , a more favorable outcome was seen in patients without ipsilateral local recurrence , reported as 85 % at 12 years [ 35 ] .
when ipsilateral local recurrence was stratified into tr and np groups , the overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with np in several studies [ 17 - 18 , 34 ] .
these figures closely reflect the results obtained in our study where new primaries' 5 - year survival was 95.0 % in contrast to 74.7 % os in the tr group .
however , due to the higher ratio of luminal a patients in the np group , a longer follow - up period is required to address the issue of a survival benefit , with the anticipation of further recurrences within the 5 - 10 year period .
furthermore , the low event rate within the molecular subtypes precluded robust statistical comparisons as the np group had only two deaths throughout the study period , with one death seen among the tnbc and the other in the luminal b subgroups .
this low number of events could be explained by the prevalence of luminal a subgroup in the np group ; whereas the tr group was enriched by luminal b , tnbc , and her - 2 subgroups , which showed an earlier occurrence of recurrences within the follow - up period .
the immature follow - up time can be regarded as a major limitation of our data set .
furthermore , not all her - 2 positive patients were treated with trastuzumab due to unavailability of this agent before 2006 , making it impossible to assess the effect of anti - her - 2 treatment on ibtr .
in fact , none of the three patients who developed a new primary had received trastuzumab at primary diagnosis .
nevertheless , all six patients who had received trastuzumab as part of the adjuvant systemic treatment developed a true recurrence , representing 18.2 % of all tr's. furthermore , in our study her 2 positivity was not identified as a significant prognostic factor for os , as there were only 2 death events in this subgroup .
in concurrence with the large datasets from adjuvant trastuzumab trials [ 37 - 39 ] , jia et al. , reported her - 2 status to have an independent prognostic role in local recurrence as well as distant metastasis - free survival [ 12 ] .
as discussed above , the small sample size and the low number of events within the distinct molecular subtypes precludes further correlative analysis and is another limitation of our study .
triple negative phenotype was outlined as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and true local recurrence in several studies [ 33 , 40 - 42 ] .
similarly , our study demonstrated tnbc as a negative prognostic factor for tr and os. this finding may lead to questioning the level of confidence when selecting bcs as a surgical method in triple negative patients .
chen et al. , in their retrospective study demonstrated that bcs followed by systemic treatment was not a risk factor for tumor relapse in tn patients and should not influence the choice of surgical modality in favor of mastectomy based on histology only [ 40 ] .
in concurrence with this finding , bhoo - pathy et al. , showed that the type of surgery did not have an impact on survival in patients with tnbc ; whereas adjuvant radiotherapy in patients younger than 40 was determined as the only factor that improved the outcome [ 43 ] .
since all of our patients had bcs , we could not evaluate the prognostic role of bcs in the tn subgroup .
as already proven in patients with her - 2 (+) tumors , targeting the biology of the tumor is the most relevant factor that changes the natural history of the disease .
for the triple negative subgroup that is in desperate need for effective treatment options , identification of potentially targetable genomic alterations remains as a challenge for the research community .
conclusions patients with a true recurrence have poorer survival as compared to those with a new primary tumor .
in concurrence with previous studies , we have identified that young age less than 40 , larger tumor size , high grade , and having triple negative phenotype at primary diagnosis as well as the occurrence of a tr negatively affects overall survival .
these findings suggest that the role of a more aggressive adjuvant systemic therapy and irradiation should be explored further in young patients with large and high - risk tumors to prevent tr. furthermore , a more personalized approach for an intensive follow - up program involving a thorough assessment for benefits outweighing the risks should be discussed in detail with these patients .

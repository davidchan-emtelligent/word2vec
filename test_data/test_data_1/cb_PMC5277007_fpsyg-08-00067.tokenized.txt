the need to actively construct order , notably representations of objects in depth , is mandated as soon as visual signals reach the retina , given the occlusion of retinal signals by retinal veins and other retinal elements or blur .
multiple stages of neural processing transform fragmented signals into visual key representations of 3d scenes that can be used to control effective behaviors .
since our survival depends on our ability to pick up order in the physical world , and since we conceive the physical world as an ordered one , our perception must somehow be sensitive to order .
the articles from this collection illustrate how texture dissimilarity , boundary completion , surface filling - in , and figure - ground segregation generate perceptual order .
structural regularities are required for a visual texture to be discriminated from random noise by human observers , as shown in katkov et al. , who compare the performance of human observers to those of an ideal observer and an order observer model .
the order observer model , based on the capture of statistical regularities in textures , is shown to closely reflect the sensitivity of the human visual system .
spatiotemporal boundary formation is critical to the perception of shape boundaries and global motion , as shown here by erlikhman and kellman , who demonstrate boundary integration from spatially and temporally sparse transformations of texture .
the visual system uses positions and times of element transformations to extract local structural regularities such as edge fragments , which then connect by interpolation processes to produce larger shapes with a spatiotemporal integration constraint of ~ 80 ms between elements .
structural ambiguity and uncertainty pose a specific problem here .
perceptual grouping not only accounts for the ways in which physically defined order is processed by the visual system , but also how such order may be inferred in cases of uncertainty , and how this may give rise to the perception of " illusory " or " phantom " shapes .
roncato et al. discuss a new phenomenon in which illusory streaks irradiate from the vertexes of angular contours , connecting pairs of figures , and forming phantom net shapes that are only clearly visible in a specific figural context , as discussed here in the light of several theories of object contour detection .
the real world conditions or configurative order to which perceptual grouping is sensitive also determine our aesthetic perception , as shown already elsewhere in a large body of previous work on aesthetic preferences for structural regularities .
here , pinna et al. discuss a novel variant of perceptual grouping called accentuation for perceptual coupling .
new conditions for grouping that cannot be explained in terms of the classical gestalt principles ( similarity etc. ) are shown .
this new work reveals the supremacy of dissimilarity as an important figural complement to similarity in the genesis of aesthetic structure , involving novel dynamics of perceptual grouping they call coupling .
the visual system organizes incoming information early on and interprets a 2d image in terms of the real world , producing configurative order that provides perceptual continuity and enables object - based attention .
grossberg reviews the form - and - color - and - depth ( facade ) model and its laminar cortical embodiment and extension by the 3d laminart models .
these have explained , simulated , and predicted many perceptual and neurobiological data about how the visual cortex carries out 3d vision and figure - ground perception , and how these cortical mechanisms generate 3d percepts from 2d pictures of occluding and occluded objects .
the models provide a unified explanation of neurophysiological data about cortical area v2 cells reported in a remarkable series of articles from the von der heydt laboratory .
properties of border ownership , contrast preference , binocular stereoscopic information , selectivity to side - of - figure , gestalt rules , strength of their modulation by attention , and temporal properties are explained .
the segregation of image parts into foreground and background requires border ownership assignment by the visual system and recordings from monkey visual cortex show that many neurons , especially in area v2 , are selective to border ownership .
these neurons are edge selective and have classical receptive fields ( crf ) .
their responses are modulated ( enhanced or suppressed ) depending on the location of a " figure " relative to the edge in their receptive field .
each neuron has a fixed preference for location on one side or the other .
this selectivity is derived from image context far beyond the crf .
von der heydt reviews evidence indicating that border ownership selectivity reflects the formation of early object representations , which he terms " proto - objects. " the evidence includes experiments showing ( 1 ) reversal of border ownership signals with change of perceived object structure , ( 2 ) border ownership specific enhancement of responses in object - based selective attention , ( 3 ) persistence of border ownership signals in accordance with continuity of object perception , and ( 4 ) remapping of border ownership signals across saccades and object movements .
grouping , persistence , and remapping are shown to be manifest in low - level visual areas , which challenges some of the traditional views and top - down - only models of perceptual grouping .
to generate perceptual judgments relative to figure and ground , polarity - invariant and polarity - specific object properties are used by the visual brain .
dresp - langley and grossberg demonstrate conditions under which figure - ground is determined by the orientation of contrasts , not by their relative sign .
psychophysical data from human observers responding to structurally ambiguous , fragmented 2d shapes with varying local contrast signs reveal polarity - invariant perceptual grouping predicted by the earliest version of the facade theory and , more recently , by the 3d laminart models .
research into processes of perceptual grouping has important societal and technological aspects , for visual interface design and , in particular , image - guided surgery platforms and simulators .
such implications , brought forward here by dresp - langley illustrates why boundary completion and figure - ground segregation are not only essential for realistic scene perception , but also for visually guided action planning and behavior .

in the symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes , host plants can form symbiotic root nodules with multiple rhizobial strains , potentially showing different symbiotic performances in nitrogen fixation .
here , we investigated the presence of mixed nodules , containing rhizobia with different degrees of mutualisms , and evaluate their relative fitness in the sinorhizobium meliloti - medicago sativa model symbiosis .
we used three s. meliloti strains , the mutualist strains rm1021 and bl225c and the non - mutualist ak83 .
we performed competition experiments involving both in vitro and in vivo symbiotic assays with m. sativa host plants .
we show the occurrence of a high number ( from 27 to 100 %) of mixed nodules with no negative effect on both nitrogen fixation and plant growth .
the estimation of the relative fitness as non - mutualist / mutualist ratios in single nodules shows that in some nodules the non - mutualist strain efficiently colonized root nodules along with the mutualist ones .
in conclusion , we can support the hypothesis that in s. meliloti - m. sativa symbiosis mixed nodules are formed and allow non - mutualist or less - mutualist bacterial partners to be less or not sanctioned by the host plant , hence allowing a potential form of cheating behavior to be present in the nitrogen fixing symbiosis .
medicago sativa symbiotic nitrogen fixation cheating mixed nodules competition sinorhizobium meliloti universita degli studi di firenze10.13039 / 501100004434 introduction in the last decades , the interest on social interaction strategies of bacteria , including antagonism and cooperation has increased ( kiers et al. , 2006 ) .
nitrogen fixing symbioses between rhizobia and leguminous plants provide interesting models to study social dynamics of strains , which compete for entering in symbiosis with the same host plant ( denison and kiers , 2004 ) .
rhizobia interact with plant roots after the perception of flavonoid molecules released by the plant roots .
in response to flavonoid , lipo - chito - oligosaccharide molecules ( nod factors ) are produced by rhizobia and trigger a molecular pathway on plant cells .
this mechanism ultimately leads to rhizobial entry into plant root tissues , intracellular colonization , formation of the root nodule structure , and differentiation of intracellular rhizobia in bacteroids .
then , bacteroids will express the nitrogenase genes responsible for the fixation of atmospheric di - nitrogen to ammonium , thus providing a selective advantage to plants growing in nitrogen - depleted soils .
the plant - rhizobia relationship is not exclusive : multiple rhizobial strains colonize the same individual plant ( kiers et al. , 2006 ) , and large genetic differences in strains isolated from the very same root apparatus have been reported ( carelli et al. , 2000 ) .
then , in theory , plants can enter into symbiosis with rhizobial strains having different symbiotic performances ( e.g. , capacity to fix di - nitrogen , to colonize root nodules , etc. ) .
to control the efficiency of the symbiotic partnership and then avoid overcolonization by strains fixing low amounts of nitrogen , plants have evolved mechanisms which favor nodules colonized by rhizobia supplying the host with a higher amount of nitrogen ( kiers et al. , 2003 ) .
in fact , the plant seems to monitor bacterial performances and states sanctions on nitrogen fixation defective strains , penalizing them in the colonization ( kiers et al. , 2003 ) .
however , in nature , strains belonging to the same species but with different levels of symbiotic performances are present .
such differences have also a practical importance in agronomy , since they are the basis for the selection of ' elite ' inoculant strains to be applied for legume yield improvement ( dwivedi et al. , 2015 ) .
deciphering the competition patterns among natural strains and the selection by host plant would be of great importance for inoculant strains development .
an additional level of competition occurs at single nodule level .
several studies have reported the occurrence of a bacterial community composed by symbiotic rhizobia and by other ( apparently non - symbiotic ) strains in soybean , common bean , cowpea , and clover ( moawad and schmidt , 1987 ; martensson et al. , 1989 ; sessitsch et al. , 1997 ; denison , 2000 ) .
the colonization of the same nodule by different symbiotic strains may allow to establish a sort of cooperation between symbiotic rhizobia to overcome plant sanctions in the case of non - mutualist ( e.g. , which do not fix atmospheric nitrogen ) or less - mutualist rhizobial partners ( e.g. , which have a limited nitrogenase functionality ) , but also may pave the way to ' free riders' or cheaters , which can be masked against sanctions directed toward the whole nodule , as shown on bradyrhizobia ( denison , 2000 ) .
the partnership between the rhizobium sinorhizobium meliloti and legumes of genus medicago ( alfalfa and relatives ) is one of the most investigated model systems of symbiotic nitrogen fixation .
in this interaction , rhizobia are terminally differentiated into bacteroids inside root nodules ( indeterminate nodules ) and lose the ability to reproduce ( sprent , 2001 ; gibson et al. , 2008 ) .
however , indeterminate nodules also contain significant numbers of undifferentiated rhizobia , which can reproduce within the nodule tissues and are released after nodule senescence ( denison and kiers , 2004 ) .
therefore , a mixed rhizobial population inside the same nodule can be present , with both terminally differentiated and undifferentiated cells .
the mixed ( differentiated and undifferentiated ) rhizobial population within the nodule may pose a question about the possibility of effective sanctions ( oono et al. , 2009 ) .
indeed , split - root experiments performed on sinorhizobium - medicago nodules did not support the hypothesis of sanctions over single nodules but indicate that a plant choice , occurring at some stage during infection , could be present ( gubry - rangin et al. , 2010 ) .
in this perspective , if single nodules are not sanctioned , we can hypothesize that the presence of multiple rhizobial strains in the same nodule with different level of mutualism ( i.e. with different degrees of nitrogen fixation ) , would be more favored in indeterminate nodules ( as those of s. meliloti - medicago ) than in determinate ones .
consequently , we can expect free - riding or cheating to be present in s. meliloti - medicago symbiosis .
this work therefore aims at in providing experimental evidence on the presence of mixed single nodules and on the possibility of cheating / free riding to occur by non - mutualist strains in the s. meliloti - medicago symbiosis .
to fulfill this aim we evaluated : ( i ) the presence of mixed nodules , which contain both the mutualist and the non - mutualist strain ; ( ii ) the differences in strains competitiveness in terms of nitrogen fixers nodules formed ; ( iii ) the fitness of the different strains in single and mixed nodules , in terms of number of bacterial cells present in nodules .
two natural strains ( plus the mutualist laboratory strain s. meliloti 1021 ) were selected for this study , a mutualist ( bl225c ) and a non - mutualist strain ( ak83 ; biondi et al. , 2009 ) in particular , s. meliloti ak83 strain is able to form symbiotic nodules on alfalfa ( m. sativa ) but nitrogen fixation does not take place , either for the lack of a large gene set on the symbiotic megaplasmid psyma ( galardini et al. , 2011 ) and / or for the presence of an accessory plasmid which contains functions related to nitrogen fixation blocking ( crook et al. , 2012 ; price et al. , 2015 ) based on these premises , s. meliloti ak83 represents a good test strain for a free - riding / cheating behavior inside mixed root nodules .
materials and methods bacterial strains , plasmids , and growth conditions the strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in table 1. s. meliloti strains were cultured on solid or liquid tryptone yeast ( ty ) medium with 0.2 g / l caco3 , while escherichia coli strains were grown in luria bertani ( lb ) medium , supplemented with antibiotics when necessary .

imaging of gfp and rfp were performed using 488 - nm excitation of an argon laser line for gfp and 543 - nm he / ne for rfp .
nodulation and nitrogen fixation assays seedlings of medicago sativa ( cv. pomposa ) were sterilized in hgcl2 , repeatedly washed , and germinated in sterile plastic petri dishes for 72 h in the dark and 48 h in the light at room temperature .
for in vitro assays , seedlings were transferred in petri dishes containing buffered nod medium ( biondi et al. , 2009 ) and 16 g / l of type a agar ( sigma - aldrich ) .
plantlets were grown for an additional 3 - 5 days before inoculation with s. meliloti strains .
for nodulation assays , strains were grown in liquid ty medium at 30degreesc for 48 h , then washed three times in 0.9 % nacl solution and resuspended to an od600 nm of 1.0 .
1 x 107 cells ( in single or a 1:1 ratio for competition experiments ) were used ( corresponding to 4 x 104 cells / cm2 ) .
cells were directly spread over the seedling root .
plates were pierced to let the plant grow outside , and transferred in a near - vertical position to a growth chamber maintained at 26degreesc with a 16 - h photoperiod ( 100 microeinstein / m2 s ) .
microcosm - scale nodulation assays were performed in plastic pots containing approximately 400 g of native ( unsterilized ) sandy - clay soil from the university campus garden .
each pot was sown with four surface - sterilized seeds and after germination rhizobial strains ( grown and washed as described for the in vitro assays ) were inoculated into the pot to a final concentration of ca .

plants were then maintained at 26degreesc with a 16 - h photoperiod ( 100 microeinstein / m2 s ) .
nitrogen fixation rates were measured by the acetylene - reduction assay and expressed in nanomoles of produced ethylene per hour , per plant , as previously described in muresu et al .
( 2008 ) .
all measures were taken 4 weeks after rhizobial inoculums , as commonly reported for s. meliloti - medicago symbiotic tests ( see for instance yendrek et al. , 2010 ; pini et al. , 2013a,b ) .
statistical analysis of data was performed with nonparametric kruskal - wallis test by analyse - it software ver .
2.0 ( analyse - it software , ltd ) .
additional tests and figures were generated through python scripts using the numpy , scipy ( van der walt et al. , 2011 ) , pandas ( mckinney , 2010 ) , matplotlib ( hunter , 2007 ) , and seaborn ( waskom et al. , 2015 ) libraries ( supplementary material s1 ) .
estimation of bacterial loads in nodules bacterial loads have been estimated by both a cultivation and a molecular ( dna - based ) method .
for cultivation , single ( at least 10 days old , size > 1 mm ) nodules were excised from plants , surface sterilized with 0.1 % nahclo for 30 '' , washed three times in sterile distilled water , crushed and re - suspended in 100 mul of 0.9 % nacl sterile solution .
aliquots of serial dilutions and the third wash water ( as control ) were then plated on ty plates and incubated at 30degreesc for 48 h. the numbers of cfu were used for titration of viable and culturable cells .
for the molecular method , bacterial dna was extracted from surface - sterilized single nodules ( as mentioned above ) by using a fast protocol for plant dna extraction ( edwards et al. , 1991 ) .
real - time pcr was performed by applying a previously published protocol ( trabelsi et al. , 2009 ) , based on the s. meliloti primer pair for core genome rpoe1 gene and on strain - specific primer pairs identified after comparative genome analysis ( galardini et al. , 2011 ) .
in particular , for 1021 , a strain - specific primer on smc01419 gene ( fw - 5 ' - cgaggaagaggtcctggaat - 3 ' , rv - 5 ' - gacgcagtcctgcaacagat - 3 ') was designed , for ak83 strain on gene sinme _ rs34005 ( old locus tag sinme _ 6912 ) ( fw - 5 ' - gattttccgcgactctgaag - 3 ' , rv - 5 ' - agtccggtgtcagattcagg - 3 ') , and for bl225c on gene sinmeb 5863 ( fw - 5'gaagcagatgctatcggcac - 3 ' , rv - 5 ' - tlambdaacagcaccacaggcgac - 3 ') .
all mentioned genes are single copy genes .
real - time ( qpcr ) was performed in an quantstudiotm 7 apparatus ( applied biosystems ) programmed with the following temperature profile : 2 min 94degreesc , followed by 40 cycles composed by 15 s 94degreesc , 15 s 63degreesc , 30 s 72degreesc .
fluorescence data acquisition was done during the extension step at 72degreesc .
a final melting curve was performed to check for product specificity .
reactions were performed in 10 mul final volume containing 5 mul of sybr green mix ( thermo fisher scientific maxima sybr green / rox qpcr master mix ( 2x ) , 0.5 mul rox solution ( included in the kit ) and 10 pmol of primers .
all reactions were done in triplicate .
standard curves with serial dilutions ( 1 ng - 0.1 pg ) of purified dna from 1021 , ak83 , and bl225c were included .
data were analyzed with the quantstudiotm 7 flex system software ( applied biosystems ) using fast 96 - well block ( 0.1 ml ) .
pcr efficiency was calculated as in bar et al .
( 2003 ) .
bacterial cell number was estimated as genome copies ( considering one genome copy per cell ) present in a given dna amount ( genome sizes for strains are those derived from genome sequencing data ( prjna42477 for bl225c , prjna41993 for ak83 , prjna57603 for 1021 ) .
competition index ( ci ) was evaluated as log of the ratio of cfu or qpcr estimates between the two strains. by using a conventional metrics ( ellermeier et al. , 2006 ; crook et al. , 2012 ) in particular , ci = log ( titre of strain a recovered / titre of strain b recovered )/( titre of strain a inoculated / titre of strain b inoculated ) .
results s. meliloti - m. sativa symbiosis allows a large number of mixed nodules the common model of symbiotic interaction wrongly dictates the monoclonality of symbiotic rhizobia in root nodules , i.e. one nodule is colonized by one rhizobium strain only ( denison , 2000 ) .
here , we provide evidence that both in vitro and in soil conditions , root nodules , formed after inoculating with a mixture of two rhizobial strains , contain both strains and that such nodules ( when they include both mutualist and non - mutualist strains ) fix nitrogen at rates similar to root nodules formed by the sole mutualist strain .
first , we provided a quantitative estimation of the frequency of nodules with mixed infection in m. sativa plants under in vitro conditions .
single nodules were crushed , plated on ty plates and subjected to dna extraction .
colonies grown on plates and extracted dna from nodules were then analyzed by pcr with strain - specific primers ( see materials and methods ) .
results showed the presence of mixed nodules in all assays ( 20 plants with 3 nodules / plant for each competition ) .
titres estimated by plating and qpcr ranged from 101 to 106 cells / nodule ( figures 1a,b ) .
in soil nodulation assays , performed by inoculating garden soil with the rhizobial culture , confirmed the in vitro results , suggesting that in nature s. meliloti may indeed form mixed nodules with m. sativa ( supplemental figure s1 ) .

molecular and plating data about the presence of mixed nodules were confirmed also by microscopy analysis on single m. sativa nodules colonized by gfp - and rfp - tagged derivatives of the strains ( table 1 ) .
nodules with both strains present ( ak83 and bl225c , as well as ak83 and 1021 or bl225c and 1021 ) were detected ( figure 2 ) .
interestingly , both rhizobial strains were in non - differentiated form ( normal bacterial - shape ) in the meristematic part of the nodule and as intracellular bacteroid - shaped cells which can fix nitrogen ( morphologically , thickened and long , y - shaped cells surrounded by a membrane ) , also for the non - mutualist ak83 strain ( figure 3 ) .

the inset highlights a portion of the image were non - differentiated cells are present ( as round - shaped cells ) .
finally , when the physiological efficiency of nodules was considered in terms of fixed nitrogen rates ( acetylene - reduction assay ) , it emerged that the nitrogen fixation rate is not significantly reduced by the presence of the non - mutualist ak83 along with a mutualist strain ( bl225c or 1021 ) ( or , if it has a very faint effect , it is not statistically significant after kruskal - wallis test ; figure 4 ) in agreement with nodulation score and nodulation index which indicate that the presence of mixed infection in nodules , seems not to have a strong influence on plant growth ( supplemental figure s2 ). from these data , we can support the hypothesis that the non - mutualist phenotype in terms of nitrogen fixation can be masked in mixed nodules by the nitrogen fixation rate of the mutualist partner , thus avoiding plant sanctions toward the formation of mixed nodules .
in particular , we can hypothesize that the good nitrogen fixation rates of mixed nodules can be due to an over - dominance of bacteroids of the mutualist strain with respect to the non - mutualist .
consequently , the number of rhizobial cells contained in single nodules was estimated .

reduction assay results expressed in terms of nmoles ethylene / h / plant .
box - and - whisker plots are from 3 to 4 nodules each from different plant .
the non - mutualist strain eeficiently colonizes root nodules the amount of cells present in each nodule was considered as a proxy for fitness , as widely reported ( see for instance ( kiers et al. , 2003 ; ratcliff et al. , 2011 ) .
both viable cells ( after plating on ty plates ) and total s. meliloti cells ( estimated by qpcr ) were counted on each nodule from single and mixed inocula .
in most of the experiments , qpcr titres were higher ( 1 - 2 log ) than viable titres ( ratio < 1 ; figures 1a,b ) .
although this difference might be due to technical reasons ( difference in sensitivity between plating and qpcr ) , we cannot exclude that the consistently higher values of qpcr estimates may be due to the presence of the terminally differentiated bacteroids ( which cannot be cultivated and contain multiple genome copies ; mergaert et al. , 2006 ) .
under this hypothesis , the ratio between viable and qpcr titres estimates was used to provide a possible proxy of the amount of strain differentiation within nodules ( figure 5 ) .
in the competition experiments between the mutualist bl225c and the non - mutualist ak83 , viable / qpcr ratio was > 1 for ak83 , while approximated < 1 for bl225c .
these data let to hypothesize that the plant may favor the differentiation of the mutualist strain ( bl225c ) .
such difference between the two competitors was not observed in the competition experiment between the two mutualist strains ( as bl225c vs. 1021 ) as well as between 1021 and ak83 ( values were below 1 for all strains ) .
a similar higher colonization level of the mutualist strains ( bl225c and 1021 ) with respect to strain ak83 was also observed in the soil experiment ( supplemental figure s1 ) .
these results could be in agreement with a model of control over bacteroid differentiation operated by the plant ( e.g. , through ncr peptides ) , which favors the differentiation of mutualist strains , then maximizing the fixed nitrogen during symbiosis ( van de velde et al. , 2010 ; price et al. , 2015 ) .
however , it is still obscure whether some genetic determinant in the mutualist may positively affect the overall differentiation in the competition , similarly to the host range restriction peptidase ( hrrp ) present in the non - mutualist ak83 ( crook et al. , 2012 ; price et al. , 2015 ) .
figure 5 average values of viable / qpcr ratio as a proxy of estimates of bacteroid differentiation .
the ratio between viable and qpcr estimates for the same nodules are reported .
the nodules tested ( from 3 to 20 ) are from different plants .
however , we cannot exclude that estimates of bacteroid differentiation obtained with other methods , e.g. , based on flow cytometry ( ratcliff et al. , 2011 ) and evaluation of rhizobial cells in nodules at different stages could clarify the biological interpretation of the observed variability in qpcr estimates .
competition indices ( ci ; figure 6 ) showed that the non - mutualist strain ak83 was present , in many cases , at lower titres than the mutualist ones ( bl225c and 1021 , ratio < 1 ) .
then , in general , a lower fitness in competition of the non - mutualist with respect to the mutualist strain was detected , particularly in qpcr estimates ( figure 6b ) .
however , nodules in which the non - mutualist colonized at titres higher than the mutualist strain were present , especially in the viable estimates of ak83 vs. bl225c competition ( figure 6a ) .
figure 6 competition index in mixed nodules : viable ( a ) and qpcr ( b ) estimates of competition index for mixed nodules ( from 3 to 20 ) coming from different plants .
log titres ratios are reported in ordinates .
this pattern of competition was also confirmed in an in vivo test on garden soil , with the mutualist strain ( 1021 and bl225c ) being dominant in nodules with respect to the non - mutualist one ( ak83 ) ( supplemental table s1 ) .
discussion in this work we have , for the first time , generated evidences of widespread presence of mixed infection in nodules which contain cheater strains in the sinorhizobium - medicago symbiosis. from the analysis of the colonization patterns , we found that nodules may host more than one strain .
in several cases the non - mutualist strain was present with low number of cells inside the mixed nodules , but nodules in which it was present at high titres ( similar or even higher than those of the mutualist strain ) were also found .
plants nodulated by both mutualist and non - mutualist did not show an appreciable decrease in plant growth , nor root nodules showed a significantly large decrease in nitrogen fixation rates compared to plants nodulated by mutualist strains .
these results support the hypothesis that , in nodules with mixed infection , the nitrogen fixation phenotype of the mutualist strains ( and consequently the effect on plant growth and , potentially , on plant fitness ) is prevalent at the whole plant level .
consequently , the non - mutualist phenotype of some strains ( as ak83 ) can be masked ( against plant sanctions ) by the fixed nitrogen provided by the mutualist strains .
then the non - mutualist strains can be protected against sanctions to ineffective ( non - nitrogen fixing ) nodules by the activity of the mutualist ones .
after this consideration , we can support the hypothesis that a fraction of the rhizobial nodulating population could indeed be a cheater of the mutualist one ( denison , 2000 ; denison and kiers , 2004 ) or anyway may thrive , as free - rider , at the expenses of the mutualist strains .
however , we cannot exclude that despite both viable and qpcr titres of nodule colonization indicate a dominance of the mutualist strains , a plant differential control over bacteroid formation could be present .
in fact , different strains of s. meliloti ( including ak83 ) seem to vary in their response to ncr peptides ( crook et al. , 2012 ; price et al. , 2015 ) , and consequently in the number of cells which do not terminally differentiate .
in our experiments ak83 is forming bacteroid - shaped cells in m. sativa plants , even in mixed infection .
this evidence indicates that the plant variety we used is producing ncr peptides able to differentiate ak83 , then possibly limiting its infection as cheater .
we can hypothesize that in other host plant species or other m. sativa varieties a different behavior of ak83 could be present , since ak83 strain harbors a hrrp homolog gene on psinme01 plasmid ( price et al. , 2015 ) , which can selectively degrade some ncr peptides .
in general , the picture coming from the presented data is that the non - mutualist strains can have some space to thrive and multiply within the nodules of the root apparatus , without apparently reducing plant growth .
the ability to multiply in the nodules ( even if with reduced titres with respect to the mutualist strains ) may allow to support the presence of a non - mutualist fraction in the rhizobia soil population ( nowak and sigmund , 2002 ; kiers et al. , 2003 ) .
however , the consequences of this supposed cheating on plant fitness cannot be fully answered .
in fact , although a " fitness " alignment has been reported between the rhizobia and the host plant ( friesen , 2012 ) and nodulation parameters have been shown to be correlated with plant biomass ( friesen , 2012 ) , no measures of direct fitness ( number of seeds , number of rhizobial cells released ) were reported .
then , relevance of the presence of nodules with mixed infection containing non - mutualist strains on plant fitness has to be clarified .
in fact , similar plant growth or nitrogen fixation rates could not imply directly similar number of seeds / offspring .
moreover , we cannot exclude that during nodule development the ratio of mutualist vs. non - mutualist strains may vary in relation to the differentiated and meristematic zone areas .
the impact of cheating on rhizobial evolution is hard to evaluate .
since rhizobial symbiosis is widespread in different bacterial taxa , even poorly related at the taxonomic level ( cfr .
the existence of alpha and beta - rhizobia ) , it is clear that symbiosis is conferring a fitness advantage for plant - associated bacteria ( remigi et al. , 2014 , 2016 ) .
however , the presence of other non - symbiotic ecological niches of rhizobia , as soil and plant endosphere , as well as the presence of genetic determinants modulating the competitiveness in different host plant varieties ( crook et al. , 2012 ; price et al. , 2015 ) is puzzling in regard to the ecological and evolutionary relevance of cheating , with respect to the overall fitness of cheating strains .
a strain behaving as cheater with one host plant genotype ( variety , species , etc. ) may be a good mutualist with a different plant genotype or having high fitness in a different environmental context ( e.g. , soil or rhizosphere ) .
moreover , the allowed presence of a supposed cheater might be based on other hitherto undetected phenotypes , different from nitrogen fixation , that could be beneficial for the plant .
indeed , it should be also kept in mind that , besides rhizobial cheaters , a high variety of endophytes of different taxonomy are regularly detected as co - occupants of nodules in many spontaneous legumes ( muresu et al. , 2008 ; zgadzaj et al. , 2015 ) .
these endophytes may enter the nodule via nod signaling from the true symbiotic strains ( zgadzaj et al. , 2015 ) and may allow a fraction of non - symbiotic rhizobia to colonize root nodules formed by mutualistic rhizobia .
however , the general role of root nodule non - symbiotic endophytes in affecting ( positively or negatively ) symbiotic nodule trophism is still unclear .
experiments in field conditions , evaluating both the nodulating and the non - nodulating fractions of the rhizobial population in competition experiments may allow to solve some of these questions .

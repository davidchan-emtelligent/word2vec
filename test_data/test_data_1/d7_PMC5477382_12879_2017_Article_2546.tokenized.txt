background scaling up hiv testing is the first step in the hiv treatment continuum which is important for controlling the hiv epidemic among men who have sex with men ( msm ) .
following an online hiv testing intervention among msm , we aim to examine sociodemographic and spatial factors associated with hiv testing .
methods we conducted a secondary analysis on data from an online hiv testing intervention among msm who had never - tested for hiv .
the survey was distributed through online networks connected to all provinces and regions of china .
univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine factors associated with testing three weeks post - intervention .
results at three weeks after the intervention , 36 % of 624 followed - up msm underwent hiv testing , 69 men reported positive hiv test results .
having money for sex , ever tested for sexually transmitted infections and intimate partner violence experience were significant factors of post - intervention hiv testing .
students were less likely to undergo hiv testing at follow - up compared to others ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.69 , 95 % c.i. = 0.47 - 0.99 ) , adjusted by age and type of intervention .
moderate provincial spatial variation of testing was observed .
conclusions while high risk men generally had higher hiv testing rates , some msm like students had lower testing rates , suggesting the need for further ways to enhance hiv testing in specific msm communities .

expanding hiv testing results in larger number of individuals diagnosed with hiv , thereby introducing more opportunities to avert hiv transmission .
in china , hiv testing coverage among men who have sex with men ( msm ) has been low , with only 24 % ever tested in the years 2000 - 2007 [ 2 ] .
hiv prevalence among msm in china increased from 1 % in 2003 to 7.7 % in 2014 [ 3 ] .
due partly to the chinese national free antiretroviral treatment program which began in 2003 ( free testing , care and treatment ) [ 4 ] and adoption of strategic plan targeting at msm in 2007 - 2010 , [ 5 ] the proportion of msm who had ever undergone hiv testing increased to 47 % by 2011 [ 2 ] .
this is still far behind the unaids target for 90 % testing among infected individuals [ 6 ] .
in the digital era , one way to enhance hiv testing is by disseminating hiv testing promotion messages through the internet .
the internet provides an opportunity to deliver messages efficiently with fewer geographic constraints .
msm in china have high rates of internet and smart phone use , providing a foundation for online interventions [ 7 ] .
hiv testing promotion using mass media such as short videos are commonly used to enhance hiv testing [ 8 , 9 ] .
the world health organization also advocated the use of media interventions to tailor hiv testing promotion among subgroups , especially key populations [ 10 ] .
most studies of mass media hiv testing interventions for msm have been limited to high - income countries such as australia , the united states and the united kingdom [ 8 , 11 - 13 ] .
in view of high transmission risk of hiv among msm in china , we examined sociodemographic and spatial factors associated with hiv testing following an online hiv testing intervention among never - tested msm .
methods this is a secondary analysis of data from an online intervention that focused on promoting hiv testing in china in 2014 ( study details elsewhere [ 14 , 15 ]) in brief , 1424 msm had been recruited online through community - based organizations with web portals based throughout china .
men who had anal sex with men at least once during their lifetime , were >= 16 year - old , and had never - tested for hiv were included .
after completing an online survey , 721 never - tested participants ( after excluding 703 ( 49.4 %) ever tested participants ) were randomly assigned to view either a crowdsourced video or health marketing video ( one minute ) that promoted hiv testing .
crowdsourcing is a bottom - up approach that uses crowd ( non - professionals ) wisdom to create a product or complete a task , while health marketing is a top - down approach based on professionals' idea [ 16 ] .
three weeks following the intervention , 624 participants reported hiv test uptake and test results through text messaging , while 97 were lost to follow - up ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
honorariums (~ 8 usd phone card ) were given to those who responded to the messaging .
bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with reported hiv testing at follow - up , which took place three - week after intervention .
the factors examined were : socio - demographics ( age , ethnicity , marital status , high education level attained , being student , annual income level and residing in city or countryside ) , sexual behavior ( group sex defined as > 2 persons engaged in sexual activity , and sex for money ) in the past 12 months , history of suffering intimate partner violence ( ipv ) by their current male sexual partner and type of ipv experienced ( details of ipv published elsewhere [ 17 ]) , history of sexually transmitted infections ( sti ) testing , pre - and post - intervention intention of hiv testing in the next year and type of intervention received ( health marketing or crowdsourced video ) .
in multivariable logistic regression , besides the type of intervention video received , the following variables were explored as potential confounders : student status , being adolescent (<= 19 year - old [ 18 ]) , married and annual income > 9677usd .
if there was > 10 % change between crude odds ratio ( or ) and adjusted odds ratio ( aor ) in the multivariable model with a confounder , we kept the confounder in the model .
we have also examined the factors associated with reported hiv testing results ( positive vs negative ) in bivariate analyses .
to account for the clustering of hiv testing which might exist in 32 provincial - level administrative divisions ( named as provinces hereafter ) , we performed binomial multilevel models using r 3.2.1 lme4 package .
in the model , msm ( level 1 ) were nested by provinces ( level 2 ) .
empty multilevel models were developed to examine the homogeneity of outcomes across provinces .
if heterogeneity existed , explanatory multilevel models were performed separately to include variables at individual level ( same as those factors listed in logistic regression models ) and province level ( retrieved from china statistical yearbook 2014 http :// www.stats.gov.cn / tjsj / ndsj / 2014 / indexch.htm ) .
provincial level factors included population size , number of males aged 15 or above , size and proportion of urban population , total and per capita gross regional product of the province .
provincial heterogeneity was tested by median odds ratio ( mor ) , with 1 denoting the absence of heterogeneity and > 1 for higher heterogeneity [ 19 ] .
results baseline characteristics all never - tested msm responding to follow - up message ( n = 624 ) were included in this study .
at baseline , the median age was 22 years old ( interquartile range ( iqr ) = 20 - 26 ) and half of the men were students ( table 1 ) .
a majority were not married ( 90 %) , had received at least high school education ( 72 % diploma or above ) , earned below 9677 usd in a year ( 86 %) and were living in a city instead of rural area ( 87 %) .
in the past 12 months , 7 % of men had group sex and 5 % had sex for money .
a total of 286 ( 46 %) intended to test for hiv in the following year before intervention , and the figure increased to 388 ( 62 %) after intervention .

the hiv prevalence ranged between 11 % ( 69 / 624 , assuming those non - tested were hiv negative ) and 31 % ( 69 / 225 ) .
comparing with hiv negative respondents , reported hiv positive respondents were more likely to be adolescent ( hiv negative : 17 % vs hiv positive : 29 % ; or = 1.95 , 95 % c.i .
= 1.003 - 3.79 ) and with lower education level ( hiv negative : 23 % vs hiv positive : 48 % , or = 3.06 , 95 % c.i. = 1.67 - 5.58 ) .
other characteristics , including other socio - demographics , sexual behavior , experience of ipv and history of sti testing , were not significantly different between reported hiv positive and negative respondents ( results not shown ) .
in multivariable logistic regression with confounders of intervention type and age ( continuous variable ) , students were less likely to have undergone hiv testing than non - students ( aor = 0.69 , 95 % c.i. = 0.47 - 0.99 ) ( table 2 ) .
adjusted by intervention type , men ever tested for stis ( aor = 2.17 , 95 % c.i. = 1.31 - 3.61 ) were more likely to test for hiv .
in addition , hiv testing intention before intervention ( aor = 2.39 , 95 % c.i .
= 1.71 - 3.34 ) and after intervention ( aor = 2.94 , 95 % c.i .
= 2.03 - 4.26 ) were positively associated with hiv testing at follow - up , and with higher odds for post - intervention testing intention .

among 257 men responding to questions related to ipv ( the rest not responded to the question ) , 29 % self - reported any type of ipv experience , and the latter were also more likely to test for hiv ( aor = 2.44 , 95 % c.i. = 1.40 - 4.23 ) .
specific types of ipv , including being hit or thrown objects , threatened to stop financial help , threatened to harm the person or persons they care for , and threatened to reveal their sexuality were positively associated with hiv testing at follow - up. geographically , the median proportion of testing across provinces was 35 % ( iqr = 25 % - 46 % , n = 26 ) , excluding 6 provinces with <= 5 men in this study .
( see fig. 1 for geographic distribution ) moderate heterogeneity of hiv testing rate at follow - up in 32 provinces was observed with mor = 1.34 .
in explanatory multilevel models , having sex for money ( aor = 2.88 , 95 % c.i .
= 1.38 - 6.01 ) , history of sti testing ( aor = 2.11 , 95 % c.i .
= 1.26 - 3.55 ) and intention of hiv testing at baseline ( aor = 2.38 , 95 % c.i .
= 1.69 - 3.33 ) and after intervention ( aor = 2.90 , 95 % c.i .
= 2.00 - 4.22 ) remained significant positive predictors of hiv testing .
however , association of neighborhood effect of province - level factors such as population size or gross regional product with hiv testing was not observed. fig. 1 spatial distribution of number of men at follow - up ( n = 624 ) denoted by circle size and proportion of hiv testing at follow - up denoted by province area in graduated color ( classified by natural break ) discussion in this study , we found that 36 % of msm without previous hiv testing underwent hiv testing after an online intervention .
the prevalence of self - reported hiv infection ranged from 11 % to 31 % .
the lower bound estimation was higher than the national hiv prevalence study among msm [ 3 ] .
the lower estimated prevalence in the previous study might be contributed by lower risk between hiv tests among msm with regular testing behavior .
this study focused on the factors significantly associated with first - time hiv testing following an online intervention .
demographically , students had a lower hiv testing rate while men with more risky behaviors had a higher hiv testing rate .
previous studies have examined hiv testing mass media interventions [ 20 ] .
several studies identified subgroups not effectively reached by such interventions [ 8 , 20 ] .
our study expands the literature by identifying the characteristics of msm who were more likely to undergo hiv testing following online intervention in a middle - income country , and examining spatial variation in effects .
geographically , moderate provincial variation of testing rate at follow - up was found .
moderate provincial variation towards hiv testing action was probably due to the variation of local hiv testing facilities , which we however do not have the data to fit in the model here .
spatial barriers of service utilization and spatial variation in hiv testing rate can be reduced by decentralization of testing sites , as observed in mozambique [ 21 ]. with the expansion of hiv testing services in china in recent years , [ 2 ] smaller variation of provincial hiv testing rate is expected .
though the proportion of men with risky sexual behaviors ( having sex for money ) was small ( 7 % of never - tested men ) , they were more likely to have hiv testing at follow - up. a high proportion of high risk msm ( 38 % of those having group sex and 45 % of those having sex for money ) claimed to be hiv positive , though these risk behaviors were not significantly associated with hiv positive status .
conversely , men without high risk sexual behaviors were less likely to go for hiv testing , probably because of their low perceived risk of infection , which is consistent with other studies for never - tested msm [ 22 , 23 ] .
on the other hand , ipv experience was found to be significantly associated with high risk behaviors of group sex [ 17 ] and having sex for money [ 17 , 24 ] .
in our study , 29 % ( 74 out of 257 ) of never - tested men at follow - up had experienced ipv .
we found that several types of ipv were positively associated with post - intervention testing , which was consistent with a previous study in the u.s. showing similar associations [ 25 ] .
they were also positively associated with hiv diagnosis [ 17 ] .
half of the study population was students .
they were less likely to have hiv testing .
even though no significant difference of testing rate was found by age group and age ( continuous variable ) , the students were apparently younger ( median age = 20 , iqr = 19 - 22 years old ) than non - students ( median age = 25 , iqr = 22 - 31 ) .
other studies found that younger msm were less likely to have been tested for hiv , probably because of their fear of testing in healthcare or local office settings [ 26 , 27 ]. of note , this subgroup ( young msm and / or students ) could be a targeted population for hiv prevention and control .
this is because sexual behaviors such as group sex and having sex for money among students were not lower than non - students in our study ( statistical results not shown ) .
in addition , among those underwent hiv testing , adolescent and those with lower education level were more likely to be hiv positive ( self - reported ) .
it is possible that online intervention could reach a group of undiagnosed young adults living with hiv in china. with low post - intervention testing rate among students , other types of testing interventions such as school - based interventions may be needed to complement online intervention .
our analysis has several limitations .
frist , this secondary analysis study did not allow us to prove the causal relationship between pre - and post - intervention hiv testing , and between testing intention and post - intervention testing action .
however , the significant association of pre - and post - intervention testing intention with post - intervention testing action could show some linkage .
second , the sample size of this study was relatively small for performing a multilevel model nested by provinces , and therefore variables of ethnicity and ipv were excluded in the multilevel models .
third , like most other msm studies , we used convenience sampling for recruiting msm online as the overall sampling frame was unknown .
even though the internet is not limited by spatial distance , the coverage of recruited men was higher in the province hosting the website portal , which might introduce selection bias .
we used multilevel models to account for possible heterogeneity .
fourth , hiv testing and test results were self - reported , which could not be validated .
however , we believe that the social desirability bias was low because there was no additional incentive for undergoing hiv testing .
we also used participants' mobile phone numbers to prevent duplicate responses .
conclusions the proportion of intent to test of never - tested men rose from 46 % at baseline to 62 % after mass media intervention , with hiv testing reported by 36 % at follow - up. men who intended to test before and after intervention were more likely to test at follow - up. men with high risk sexual behaviors , ipv experience and sti testing experience had higher preference for hiv testing .
however , as student msm were less likely to undergo testing even after intervention , further research is needed to enhance hiv testing and explain why adolescents were more likely to be hiv positive once tested .
possible future interventions include online tools complemented by conventional school - based interventions .

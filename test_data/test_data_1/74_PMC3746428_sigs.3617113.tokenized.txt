turneriella parva levett et al .
2005 is the only species of the genus turneriella which was established as a result of the reclassification of leptospira parva hovind - hougen et al .
1982. together with leptonema and leptospira , turneriella constitutes the family leptospiraceae , within the order spirochaetales .
here we describe the features of this free - living aerobic spirochete together with the complete genome sequence and annotation .
this is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the genus turneriella and the 13th member of the family leptospiraceae for which a complete or draft genome sequence is now available .
the 4,409,302 bp long genome with its 4,169 protein - coding and 45 rna genes is part of the genomic encyclopedia of bacteria and archaea project .

de - ac52 - 07na27344de - ac02 - 06na25396de - ac05 - 00or22725 introduction strain ht (= dsm 21527 = nctc 11395 = atcc baa - 1111 ) is the type strain of turneriella parva [ 1 ] .
the strain was isolated from contaminated leptospira culture medium [ 2 ] and was originally thought to be affiliated with leptospira [ 2 ] because of morphological similarities to other members of the genus .
strain ht was designated as a separate species because of certain morphological and molecular differences : cells were shorter and were more tightly wound , the surface layer formed blebs instead of cross - striated tubules when detached for negative staining preparation and the base composition of dna differed from that of other leptospira species [ 2 ] .
dna - dna hybridization [ 3 ] and enzyme activity [ 4 ] studies revealed sufficient differences between other leptospira species and l. parva that the ' subcommittee on the taxonomy of leptospira ' [ 5 ] decided to exclude l. parva from the genus leptospira and assign it as the type strain of a new genus : ' turneria ' as ' turneria parva ' .
the genus was named in honor of leslie turner , an english microbiologist who made definitive contributions to the knowledge of leptospirosis [ 1 ] .
however , as the generic name is also in use in botany and zoology , this name was rendered illegitimate and invalidate , but was used in the literature [ 6,7 ] .
the first 16s rrna gene - based study ( genbank accession number z21636 ) , performed on leptospira parva incertae sedis , confirmed the isolated position of l. parva among leptonema and leptospira species [ 8 ] , a finding later supported by morey et al .
[ 9 ] .
the reclassification of l. parva as turneriella parva com. nov. was published by levett et al .
[ 1 ] , reconfirming the separate position of the type strain [ 10 ] and an additional strain ( s - 308 - 81 , atcc baa - 1112 ) from the uterus of a sow from all other leptospiras on the basis of dna - dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis ( genbank accession number ay293856 ) .
the strain was selected for genome sequencing because of its deep branching point within the leptospiraceae lineage .
here we present a summary classification and a set of features for t. parva ht together with the description of the complete genomic sequencing and annotation .
classification and features 16s rrna gene sequence analysis a representative genomic 16s rdna sequence of t. parva ht was compared using ncbi blast [ 11,12 ] under default settings ( e.g. , considering only the high - scoring segment pairs ( hsps ) from the best 250 hits ) with the most recent release of the greengenes database [ 13 ] and the relative frequencies of taxa and keywords ( reduced to their stem [ 14 ]) were determined , weighted by blast scores .
the most frequently occurring genera were geobacter ( 48.7 %) , leptospira ( 19.2 %) , pelobacter ( 13.4 %) , spirochaeta ( 8.1 %) and turneriella ( 6.4 %) ( 56 hits in total ) .
regarding the single hit to sequences from members of the species , the average identity within hsps was 95.8 % , whereas the average coverage by hsps was 89.8 % .
among all other species , the one yielding the highest score was leptonema illini ( ay714984 ) , which corresponded to an identity of 85.7 % and an hsp coverage of 62.6 % .
( note that the greengenes database uses the insdc (= embl / ncbi / ddbj ) annotation , which is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification. ) the highest - scoring environmental sequence was dq017943 ( greengenes short name ' cntrl erpn rnnng wtrs exmnd tgge and uplnd strm cln s - bq2 83 ') , which showed an identity of 95.6 % and an hsp coverage of 97.8 % .
the most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of all environmental samples which yielded hits were ' microbi ' ( 5.5 %) , ' sediment ' ( 2.6 %) , ' soil ' ( 2.5 %) , ' industri ' ( 2.1 %) and ' anaerob ' ( 1.9 %) ( 194 hits in total ) .
environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the highest scoring species were not found .
figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of t. parva ht in a 16s rrna based tree .
the sequences of the two identical 16s rrna gene copies in the genome do not differ from the previously published 16s rrna sequence ( ay293856 ) .
figure 1 phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of t. parva relative to the type strains of the other species within the phylum ' spirochaetes ' .
the tree was inferred from 1,318 aligned characters [ 15,16 ] of the 16s rrna gene sequence under the maximum likelihood ( ml ) criterion [ 17 ] .
rooting was done initially using the midpoint method [ 18 ] and then checked for its agreement with the current classification ( table 1 ) .
the branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site .
numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 500 ml bootstrap replicates [ 19 ] ( left ) and from 1,000 maximum - parsimony bootstrap replicates [ 20 ] ( right ) if larger than 60 % .
lineages with type strain genome sequencing projects registered in gold [ 21 ] are labeled with one asterisk , those also listed as ' complete and published ' with two asterisks [ 22 - 28 ] ; for sphaerochaeta pleomorpha see cp003155 .
the collapsed treponema subtree contains three species formerly assigned to spirochaeta that have recently been included in the genus treponema , even though those names are not yet validly published [ 27 ] .

evidence codes are from the gene ontology project [ 38 ] .
morphology and physiology cells of strain ht are gram - negative , flexible and helical with 0.3 microm in diameter and 3.5 - 7.5 microm in length and a wavelength of 0.3 - 0.5 microm ( figure 2 ) .
motility is achieved by means of two axial filaments , similar to those of other leptospiras .
the surface of the cells show several blebs with no apparent substructure when prepared for negative staining while under the same conditions , cross - striated tubules are visible in other leptospiras [ 1,2 ] .
the strain is obligately aerobic and oxidase positive .
slow and limited growth occurs in polysorbate albumin medium [ 39 ] at 11 , 30 and 37 degreesc .
growth is inhibited by 8 - azaguanine ( 200 microg ml - 1 ) and 2,6 diaminopurine ( microg ml - 1 ) .
lipase is produced , long - chain fatty acids and long - chain fatty alcohols are utilized as carbon and energy sources .
l - lysine arylamidase , alpha - l - glutamate arylamidase , glycine arylamidase , leucyl - glycine arylamidase and alpha - d - galactosidase activities are lacking [ 4 ] .
the type strain is not pathogenic for hamsters [ 1 ] .
figure 2 scanning electron micrograph of t. parva ht chemotaxonomy information on peptidoglycan composition , major cell wall sugars , fatty acids , menaquinones and polar lipids is not available .
the mol % g + c of dna was originally reported to be approximately 48 % [ 3 ] , significantly less than the g + c content inferred from the genome sequence .
genome sequencing and annotation genome project history this organism was selected for sequencing on the basis of its phylogenetic position [ 40 ] , and is part of the genomic encyclopedia of bacteria and archaea project [ 41 ] .
the genome project is deposited in the genomes on line database [ 21 ] and the complete genome sequence is deposited in genbank .
sequencing , finishing and annotation were performed by the doe joint genome institute ( jgi ) using state of the art sequencing technology [ 42 ] .
a summary of the project information is shown in table 2 .

dna was isolated from 1 - 1.5 g of cell paste using masterpure gram - positive dna purification kit ( epicentre mgp04100 ) following the standard protocol as recommended by the manufacturer with modification st / dl for cell lysis as described in wu et al .
2009 [ 41 ] .
dna is available through the dna bank network [ 44 ] .
genome sequencing and assembly the genome was sequenced using a combination of illumina and 454 sequencing platforms .
all general aspects of library construction and sequencing can be found at the jgi website [ 45 ] .
pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the newbler assembler ( roche ) .
the initial newbler assembly consisting of 217 contigs in 1 scaffold was converted into a phrap [ 46 ] assembly by making fake reads from the consensus , to collect the read pairs in the 454 paired end library .
illumina gaii sequencing data ( 8,018.4 mb ) was assembled with velvet [ 47 ] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped fake reads ( shreds ) and assembled together with the 454 data .
the 454 draft assembly was based on 200.6 mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data .
newbler parameters are - consed - a 50 - l 350 - g - m - ml 21 .
the phred / phrap / consed software package [ 46 ] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment in the subsequent finishing process .
after the shotgun stage , reads were assembled with parallel phrap ( high performance software , llc ) .
possible mis - assemblies were corrected with gapresolution [ 45 ] , dupfinisher [ 48 ] , or sequencing cloned bridging pcr fragments with subcloning .
gaps between contigs were closed by editing in consed , by pcr and by bubble pcr primer walks ( j .
- f. chang , unpublished ) .
a total of 361 additional reactions and 11 shatter library were necessary to close some gaps and to raise the quality of the final contigs .
illumina reads were also used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using a software polisher developed at jgi [ 49 ] .
the error rate of the final genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000 .
together , the combination of the illumina and 454 sequencing platforms provided 1,722.1 x coverage of the genome .
the final assembly contained 348,698 pyrosequence and 97,925,368 illumina reads .
genome annotation genes were identified using prodigal [ 50 ] as part of the doe - jgi annotation pipeline [ 51 ] , followed by a round of manual curation using the jgi geneprimp pipeline [ 52 ] .
the predicted cdss were translated and used to search the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) nonredundant database , uniprot , tigr - fam , pfam , priam , kegg , cog , and interpro databases .
additional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the integrated microbial genomes - expert review ( img - er ) platform [ 53 ] .
genome properties the genome statistics are provided in table 3 and figure 3 .
the genome in its current assembly consists of two linear scaffolds with a total length of 4,384,015 bp and 25,287 bp , respectively , and a g + c content of 53.6 %. of the 4,214 genes predicted , 4,169 were protein - coding genes , and 45 rnas ; 30 pseudogenes were also identified .
the majority of the protein - coding genes ( 57.9 %) were assigned a putative function while the remaining ones were annotated as hypothetical proteins .

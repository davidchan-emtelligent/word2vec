the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin limits iron fluxes to the bloodstream by promoting degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin in target cells .
hepcidin insufficiency causes hyperabsorption of dietary iron , hyperferremia and tissue iron overload , which are hallmarks of hereditary hemochromatosis .
similar responses are also observed in iron - loading anemias due to ineffective erythropoiesis ( such as thalassemias , dyserythropoietic anemias and myelodysplastic syndromes ) and in chronic liver diseases .
on the other hand , excessive hepcidin expression inhibits dietary iron absorption and leads to hypoferremia and iron retention within tissue macrophages .
this reduces iron availability for erythroblasts and contributes to the development of anemias with iron - restricted erythropoiesis ( such as anemia of chronic disease and iron - refractory iron - deficiency anemia ) .
pharmacological targeting of the hepcidin / ferroportin axis may offer considerable therapeutic benefits by correcting iron traffic .
this review summarizes the principles underlying the development of hepcidin - based therapies for the treatment of iron - related disorders , and discusses the emerging strategies for manipulating hepcidin pathways .
iron metabolism hemochromatosis anemia inflammation erythropoiesis canadian institutes of health research10.13039 / 501100000024mop - 86514 introduction iron is an essential constituent of hemoglobin , myoglobin and several other proteins , but also potentially toxic due to its redox reactivity that promotes oxidative stress ( papanikolaou and pantopoulos , 2005 ) .
balanced iron homeostasis is required to satisfy metabolic needs and minimize the risk of toxic side effects .
more than two thirds of body iron ( 3 - 5 g in adults ) is used in hemoglobin of red blood cells ( rbcs ) ( gkouvatsos et al. , 2012 ) .
erythroblasts require a daily supply of ~ 20 - 30 mg and non - erythroid cells another ~ 5 mg of iron , which is provided by plasma transferrin ( figure 1 ) .
the transferrin iron pool does not exceed ~ 3 mg at steady state and turns over > 10 times / day .
it is mostly replenished with iron recycled from senescent rbcs by tissue macrophages .
the contribution of dietary iron absorption ( 1 - 2 mg / day ) is minimal in healthy individuals , and mostly compensates for non - specific iron losses due to cell desquamation or bleeding .
iron stored in hepatocytes can be mobilized for erythropoiesis under conditions of iron deficiency .
figure 1 distribution of iron in the adult human body and regulation of iron traffic .
circulating iron is bound to transferrin ( holo - tf ) and delivered to tissues ( black arrows ) .
holo - tf is primarily replenished by iron recycled from tissue macrophages ( thick red arrow ) , but also by dietary iron absorbed by duodenal enterocytes ( thin red arrow ) .
under conditions of iron deficiency , iron stored in hepatocytes can also be mobilized ( thin red arrow ) .
iron efflux to the bloodstream is inhibited by the liver - derived peptide hormone hepcidin , which binds to the iron exporter ferroportin ( fpn ) and promotes its degradation .
iron efflux to the bloodstream is physiologically restrained by hepcidin , an antimicrobial peptide and master hormonal regulator of systemic iron metabolism ( ganz , 2013 ) .
hepcidin is synthesized in hepatocytes and secreted to the bloodstream for binding to the iron exporter ferroportin ( fpn ) in target cells , primarily macrophages and enterocytes , and to some extent hepatocytes ( figure 1 ) .
the binding of hepcidin promotes internalization and lysosomal degradation of ferroportin ( drakesmith et al. , 2015 ) .
as a result , recycled iron remains in macrophages , while dietary iron absorption through the intestine is inhibited .
hepcidin expression is predominantly modulated by iron , inflammation and erythropoiesis ( figure 2 ) , but also responds to other stimuli such as endoplasmic reticulum stress , oxidative stress , gluconeogenesis , gonadal hormones , growth factors and hypoxia ( ganz and nemeth , 2015 ; kim and nemeth , 2015 ; pietrangelo , 2016 ; wang and babitt , 2016 ) .
increased serum or tissue iron levels ( reflected in transferrin saturation or expression of hepatic bmp6 , respectively ) promote hepcidin induction via bmp / smad signaling .
inflammatory il - 6 triggers hepcidin induction via il - 6 / stat signaling , in crosstalk with the bmp / smad pathway .
activin b is another inflammatory cytokine that activates hepcidin via non - canonical bmp / smad signaling .
increased erythropoietic activity orchestrated by erythropoietin leads to hepcidin suppression via erythroferrone ( erfe ) and other cytokines .
it is not well understood how erfe suppresses hepcidin , but it appears to attenuate bmp / smad signaling ( nai et al. , 2016 ) .
misregulation of hepcidin is etiologically linked or contributes to iron - related disorders ( listed in table 1 ) , in which pharmacological targeting of the hepcidin / ferroportin axis to restore physiological hepcidin levels is expected to offer therapeutic benefits ( poli et al. , 2014c ; ruchala and nemeth , 2014 ; schmidt and fleming , 2014 ; rochette et al. , 2015 ; blanchette et al. , 2016 ; liu et al. , 2016 ) .
pathological implications of hepcidin misregulation are schematically outlined in figure 3 and discussed below .
figure 2 major pathways for hepcidin regulation .
high serum iron levels or hepatic iron stores ( reflected in bmp6 ) induce hepcidin mrna transcription via the bmp / smad signaling cascade .
the inflammatory cytokines il - 6 and activin b induce hepcidin mrna transcription via jak / stat and non - canonical bmp / smad signaling , respectively .
high erythropoietic drive ( reflected in erfe ) suppresses hepcidin transcription , likely via interference with bmp / smad signaling .
table 1 disorders associated with misregulation of hepcidin .
disorders with hepcidin deficiency hereditary hemochromatosis ( genetic suppression of hepcidin ) adult forms caused by mutations in hfe or tfr2 juvenile forms caused by mutations in hjv or hamp iron - loading anemias ( erythropoietic suppression of hepcidin ) thalassemias dyserythropoietic anemias myelodysplastic syndromes chronic liver diseases ( suppression of hepcidin by oxidative stress ) chronic hepatitis c disorders with hepcidin excess anemia of chronic disease ( inflammatory induction of hepcidin ) observed in various chronic inflammatory conditions and some cancers other anemias with iron - restricted erythropoiesis anemia of chronic kidney disease ( inflammatory induction and reduced renal clearance of hepcidin ) iron - refractory iron deficiency anemia ( genetic induction of hepcidin caused by mutations in tmprss6 ) anemia of castleman disease ( inflammatory induction of hepcidin triggered by tumor - derived il - 6 figure 3 imbalance in hepcidin expression .
physiological hepcidin responses correlate with healthy body iron metabolism .
pathologically low hepcidin expression occurs in hereditary hemochromatosis ( hh ) and in iron - loading anemias ; this leads to hyperferremia and parenchymal tissue iron overload due to increased iron efflux to the bloodstream from macrophages and intestinal enterocytes .
pathologically high hepcidin expression occurs in the anemia of chronic disease ( acd ) and other anemias of iron - restricted erythropoiesis ; this leads to hypoferremia and decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis due to iron sequestration in macrophages .
disorders of hepcidin deficiency hereditary hemochromatosis ( hh ) is an endocrine disorder of systemic iron overload that is caused by hepcidin insufficiency ( pietrangelo , 2015 ; powell et al. , 2016 ) .
it constitutes the most frequent genetic disorder in populations of northern european ancestry and is characterized by chronic hyperabsorption of dietary iron ( up to 8 - 10 mg / day ) and unrestricted release of iron from macrophages .
these responses lead to hyperferremia , gradual saturation of transferrin and buildup of redox - active non - transferrin bound iron ( ntbi ) , which is deposited within tissue parenchymal cells .
hh patients fail to mount appropriate iron - dependent hepcidin induction due to mutations in upstream regulators of iron signaling to hepcidin ( hfe , tfr2 or hjv ; see figure 2 ) or disruption of the hepcidin gene ( hamp ) .
patients with non - classical ferroportin disease , carrying mutations in ferroportin that prevent hepcidin binding , develop clinical features of hh due to hepcidin resistance ( mayr et al. , 2010 ) .
hh is genetically heterogeneous and its severity correlates with the degree of inhibition in hepcidin induction relative to body iron stores .
the prevalent hfe - related variant exhibits a relatively milder phenotype due to residual hepcidin responsiveness .
rare variants ( tfr2 - , hjv - or hamp - related ) are associated with more profound iron overload and hepcidin inactivation .
disruption of either hjv or hamp genes leads to early onset juvenile hh , the most severe form of the disease .
clinical complications of adult hh develop after the fourth decade of life and include liver pathology ( fibrosis , cirrhosis , hepatocellular cancer ) , diabetes , skin hyperpigmentation , arthritis and osteoporosis .
juvenile hh patients usually present with hypogonadism in their early 20s and develop fatal cardiomyopathy before the age of 30 if untreated .
the standard of care for all forms of hh is reduction of iron burden via therapeutic phlebotomy ( sivakumar and powell , 2016 ) .
this approach is effective and cheap .
however , some patients are intolerant , or have low acceptance and compliance to a life - long treatment , or present contraindications ( severe heart disease or anemia ) .
these patients are good candidates for new therapies based on restoration of appropriate hepcidin levels .
hepcidin deficiency is common in hematological disorders associated with ineffective erythropoiesis , such as thalassemias , dyserythropoietic anemias and myelodysplastic syndromes , and contributes to iron overload ( ginzburg and rivella , 2011 ; camaschella and nai , 2016 ) .
ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by massive expansion of bone marrow erythroblasts due to decreased production of mature rbcs .
this creates a high demand for iron , which leads to suppression of hepcidin in spite of systemic iron overload .
evidently , the negative erythropoietic signals dominate over the positive iron signals under these conditions .
erythropoietic suppression of hepcidin triggers iron overload in non - transfused patients with mild forms of iron loading anemias , and aggravates secondary iron overload in transfused patients ( ginzburg and rivella , 2011 ) .
restoration of hepcidin could prevent iron overload in the former and improve the efficacy of iron chelation therapy in the latter .
inhibition of hepcidin expression also contributes to iron overload observed in chronic hepatitis c and other chronic liver diseases ( sebastiani and pantopoulos , 2011 ; pietrangelo , 2016 ) .
this is mainly attributed to oxidative stress mechanisms , which appear to override hepcidin - inducing inflammatory signals .
eradication of hepatitis c virus with direct - acting antiviral ( daa ) drugs ( zopf et al. , 2016 ) is expected to restore hepcidin expression without need for further interventions .
disorders of hepcidin excess excessive hepcidin expression is commonly observed in chronic inflammatory conditions due to infectious or autoimmune disorders or cancer ( weiss , 2015 ; wang and babitt , 2016 ) .
inflammatory induction of hepcidin is primarily mediated by il - 6 and leads to hypoferremia due to ferroportin degradation and iron sequestration in tissue macrophages .
remodeling of iron metabolism by hepcidin - independent mechanisms may further exacerbate this phenotype .
thus , lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) and interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) inhibit iron efflux from monocytes by decreasing ferroportin expression ( ludwiczek et al. , 2003 ) , while the toll - like receptor 2 and 6 ( tlr2 / 6 ) ligands fsl1 or pam3csk4 trigger hypoferemia in mice by suppressing ferroportin transcription in tissue macrophages ( guida et al. , 2015 ) .
the acute hypoferremic response is considered to be protective against infection by depriving bacteria from iron , and may also be enhanced by antimicrobial activities of hepcidin .
however , persistent chronic hypoferremia restricts iron availability for erythropoiesis ( ganz and nemeth , 2015 ) .
together with immune - driven reduced proliferation and life span of rbcs , the diversion of iron traffic contributes to pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic disease ( acd ) , or anemia of inflammation , the most frequent anemia among hospitalized patients ( weiss , 2015 ) .
acd is typically normocytic / normochromic and unassociated with a reduction in body iron stores , but may be confounded by true iron deficiency due to chronic blood losses and / or scarcity or malabsorption of dietary iron .
acd patients with true iron deficiency exhibit reduced hepcidin levels and a microcytic / hypochromic phenotype .
correction of acd improves quality of patients' life .
the best strategy is the successful treatment of the primary underlying cause .
when this is not possible , acd is often managed with erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esas ) , combined or not with oral or intravenous iron administration or rbc transfusions .
nevertheless , these approaches are not always efficacious because hepcidin overexpression blunts responses to esas and maintains iron unavailable to erythroblasts .
therefore , they could be complemented by strategies to lower hepcidin levels , thereby mitigating erythropoietic iron - restriction .
patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) accumulate high hepcidin levels in the bloodstream due to reduced renal clearance , but also due to inflammatory induction of hepcidin transcription ( tsuchiya and nitta , 2013 ) .
this is associated with iron - restricted erythropoiesis and contributes to anemia .
moreover , it negatively affects therapy with esas and oral or intravenous iron .
thus , hepcidin - lowering strategies could improve therapeutic outcomes .
genetic inactivation of the tmprss6 gene leads to unrestricted hepcidin production in spite of low body iron stores , which underlies the pathogenesis of iron - refractory iron deficiency anemia ( irida ) ( heeney and finberg , 2014 ) .
tmprss6 encodes matriptase - 2 , a transmembrane serine protease that negatively regulates bmp / smad signaling to hepcidin ( see figure 2 ) .
it appears that hepcidin overexpression is the sole driver of irida , which is microcytic and hypochromic .
high hepcidin levels render irida patients unresponsive to oral and partially responsive to intravenous iron therapy .
here , correction of hepcidin excess would not only improve responsiveness to iron therapy , but also provide an etiologic cure .
pediatric patients with castleman disease develop a chronic inflammatory anemia with irida - like features .
castleman disease is caused by tumors overproducing il - 6 , which in turn promotes an inflammatory state and excessive hepcidin expression ( arlet et al. , 2010 ) .
the ensuing anemia is refractory to oral iron therapy and can be reversed by resection of the tumor , which eliminates the hepcidin inducer ( il - 6 ) .
pharmacological reduction of hepcidin could offer another option for anemia management .
all above - described conditions constitute disorders of systemic hepcidin excess , where high circulating hepcidin levels are derived from hepatocytes .
nevertheless , different cell types in several tissues can also produce hepcidin locally , and this may have profound pathophysiological ramifications .
for instance , hepcidin generated by breast or prostate cancer epithelial cells promotes iron retention via autocrine degradation of ferroportin , which in turn favors survival and growth ( pinnix et al. , 2010 ; tesfay et al. , 2015 ) .
therefore , targeted delivery of hepcidin antagonists to hepcidin - overexpressing tumors may sensitize them to anti - cancer therapies .
hepcidin is also produced in response to inflammation or other signals by heart cardiomyocytes ( merle et al. , 2007 ) and by brain astrocytes and microglia ( urrutia et al. , 2013 ) .
considering that the hepcidin / ferroportin axis is crucial for cardiac function ( lakhal - littleton et al. , 2015 ) and that inflammatory induction of hepcidin causes iron accumulation in nervous system cells ( urrutia et al. , 2013 ) , localized targeting of hepcidin excess in the heart or brain may be important in the context of cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disorders .
pharmacological restoration of hepcidin the therapeutic potential of restoring hepcidin levels in iron overload states is highlighted by genetic studies in mice .
thus , transgenic expression of hepcidin prevented iron overload in hfe - / - ( nicolas et al. , 2003 ) and hbbth3 /+ ( gardenghi et al. , 2010 ) mice , models of hh and beta - thalassemia intermedia , respectively .
likewise , genetic disruption of tmprss6 enhanced bmp / smad signaling , increased endogenous hepcidin expression and prevented iron overload in hfe - / - ( finberg et al. , 2011 ) and hbbth3 /+ mice ( nai et al. , 2012 ) .
moreover , manipulation of hepcidin levels by these strategies also improved erythropoiesis in hbbth3 /+ mice ( gardenghi et al. , 2010 ; nai et al. , 2012 ) .
it should be noted that disruption of both tmprss6 alleles offered optimal correction of iron overload but also caused microcytic anemia in hfe - / - mice ( finberg et al. , 2011 ) , suggesting that titration of hepcidin levels within a physiological window is imperative to prevent adverse effects of hepcidin excess .
the protective effects of tmprss6 ablation in the hfe - / - and hbbth3 /+ backgrounds rendered this gene a candidate pharmacological target for therapeutic hepcidin induction .
in fact , suppression of hepatic tmprss6 by using rnai ( schmidt et al. , 2013 ) or antisense oligonucleotides ( guo et al. , 2013a ) increased hepcidin expression in wild type , hfe - / - and hbbth3 /+ mice .
importantly , it reduced systemic iron overload in hfe - / - and hbbth3 /+ mice , and ameliorated anemia in hbbth3 /+ mice .
the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics against target genes in the liver is an active area of research ( sehgal et al. , 2013 ) .
limitations are related to potential off - target effects and toxicity , pharmacokinetic problems of delivery and clearance from the bloodstream , as well as high cost .
administration of recombinant bmp6 was shown to improve iron signaling to hepcidin and correct systemic iron homeostasis in hfe - / - mice , even though endogenous bmp6 expression is appropriately induced in these animals ( corradini et al. , 2010 ) .
nevertheless , prolonged bmp6 application caused peritoneal calcifications , indicative of lack of target specificity , which may lead to further pleiotropic side effects .
cell culture studies and chemical screens identified several small molecules capable of stimulating hepcidin transcription in vitro , such as genistein ( zhen et al. , 2013 ) , sb204741 , daunorubicin , ethacridine , phenazopyridine , 9 - aminoacridine , amlexanox , lansoprazole , leflunomide , ipriflavone , as252424 , pterostilbene , ag1296 , gtp14564 , su6668 , leflunomide , 10058 - f4 and vorinostat ( gaun et al. , 2014 ) .
an rnai screen identified sorafenib , wortmannin , rapamycin and metformin as inducers of hepcidin mrna expression ( mleczko - sanecka et al. , 2014 ) .
these drugs affect different pathways , including growth factor signaling , anti - inflammatory signaling , dna repair and apoptosis .
their exact mechanisms of action are not well understood and their capacity to control hepcidin expression in vivo has not been examined .
broad target specificity may disqualify many of the above - described drugs for pharmacological applications to stimulate hepcidin .
another small molecule screen identified three steroid molecules as hepcidin inducers ( li et al. , 2016 ) .
progesterone , epitiostanol , and mifepristone were shown to stimulate hepcidin transcription independently of the bmp / smad and il - 6 / stat3 pathways , by a mechanism requiring progesterone receptor membrane component - 1 ( pgrmc1 ) .
administration of progesterone to women in the context of standard fertility treatments resulted in hepcidin induction ( li et al. , 2016 ) .
contrary to progesterone , 17beta - estradiol inhibits hepcidin transcription via an estrogen - responsive promoter element ( yang et al. , 2012 ) .
testosterone likewise inhibits hepcidin but operates by enhancing negative epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) signaling ( latour et al. , 2014 ) , and by competing positive bmp signaling via androgen receptor binding to smad proteins ( guo et al. , 2013b ) .
hepcidin - inducing steroids or drugs that lower 17beta - estradiol or testosterone could be applied for pharmacological restoration of hepcidin .
nevertheless , potential long - term side effects of steroids should be considered .
hepcidin supplementation therapy would provide a straightforward approach , devoid of inherent limitations associated with the targeting of upstream regulators .
however , the chemical synthesis of hepcidin or its expression as recombinant peptide is costly , while appropriate folding to the biologically active form is complicated by the presence of 8 cysteine residues within the 25 amino acids of the mature peptide forming 4 disulfide bridges ( figure 4 ) .
moreover , synthetic or recombinant hepcidin is rapidly cleared in the circulation and therefore pharmacological concentrations cannot be sustained .
encapsulation of hepcidin into biocompatible nanocarriers suitable for controlled release of therapeutics ( cheng et al. , 2015 ) could theoretically address this issue .
a formulation of hepcidin developed by la jolla pharmaceutical company ( ljpc - 401 ) is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trials with patients at risk of iron overload ( http :// lajollapharmaceutical.com / 2015 / 10 / la - jolla - pharmaceutical - company - doses - first - patient - in - phase - 1 - clinical - trial - of - ljpc - 401 - in - patients - at - risk - of - iron - overload /) .
figure 4 crystal structure and sequence of human hepcidin .
the nine n - terminal amino acids involved in binding to ferroportin are highlighted in yellow ( pdb id 1m4f ) .
disulfide bonds are highlighted in orange .
biochemical studies revealed that hepcidin interacts with ferroportin via its n - terminal region ( highlighted in figure 4 ) , and that c - terminal amino acid residues are dispensable .
this led to the development of mini - hepcidin analogs containing a minimal core of 7 - 9 n - terminal amino acids with a single cysteine , which suffice to trigger ferroportin internalization and degradation in cells and mice ( preza et al. , 2011 ) .
substitution of natural with modified amino acids and introduction of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) and hydrophobic linkers ( palmitic acid ) improved stability and pharmacological properties of mini - hepcidins .
cyclization may increase stability but appears to reduce biological activity ( chua et al. , 2015 ) .
treatment with an engineered mini - hepcidin mimetic ( pr65 ) prevented iron overload in iron - depleted hepcidin - deficient hamp - / - mice , but was less efficient in correcting iron traffic when these mice were already iron overloaded ( ramos et al. , 2012 ) .
high doses of pr65 caused anemia , emphasizing the importance of titration .
the mini - hepcidin pro - drug m009 is metabolized to active mini - hepcidin m004 and was recently shown to improve erythropoiesis in hbbth3 /+ mice and in a mouse model of polycythemia vera ( casu et al. , 2016 ) .
another mini - hepcidin derivative developed by merganser biotech ( m012 ) initiated a clinical trial in february 2016 ( http :// merganserbiotech.com / 2016 / 02 / 24 / merganser - biotech - inc - initiates - first - clinical - trial /) .
interestingly , administration of the mini - hepcidin mimetic pr73 protected hamp - / - mice against infection with the siderophilic bacterium vibrio vulnificus ( arezes et al. , 2015 ) .
pr73 caused hypoferremia to these animals in spite of tissue iron overload , which restricted circulating iron from v. vulnificus and thereby inhibited its growth .
considering that infections with extracellular siderophilic pathogens can be lethal to hh patients ( frank et al. , 2011 ) , these data highlight another possible application of hepcidin agonists .
finally , the adverse effects of hepcidin inactivation in mouse models of malaria infection ( portugal et al. , 2011 ) or microbial sepsis suggest a therapeutic potential of hepcidin agonists in the context of these pathologies ( zeng et al. , 2015 ) .
pharmacological reduction of hepcidin targeting of hepcidin pathways is expected to correct defects triggered by excessive hepcidin expression .
supporting evidence is provided by studies with multicentric castleman disease patients who were treated with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against il - 6 receptor ( tocilizumab ) or il - 6 ( siltuximab ) .
these treatments reduced hepcidin levels and improved anemia ( song et al. , 2010 ; casper et al. , 2015 ) .
tocilizumab administration also lowered hepcidin and improved anemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients ( isaacs et al. , 2013 ; song et al. , 2013 ) and in a monkey arthritis model ( hashizume et al. , 2010 ) .
similar results were obtained when rheumatoid arthritis patients were treated with antibodies against tnfalpha ( golimumab or infliximab ) , possibly as an indirect result of concomitant suppression of il - 6 ( doyle et al. , 2013 ; song et al. , 2013 ) .
studies with cell and mouse models showed that downstream inhibition of the il - 6 / stat3 signaling pathway by using small molecule inhibitors of stat3 ( curcumin , ag490 and ppylktk ) likewise decreases hepcidin ( jiao et al. , 2009 ; fatih et al. , 2010 ; zhang et al. , 2011 ) .
however , further development of this class of drugs as hepcidin inhibitors is hindered by lack of specificity ( all stat3 inhibitors ) , competing iron chelating properties ( curcumin ) or poor pharmacokinetics ( ag490 and ppylktk ) .
as the il - 6 / stat3 and bmp / smad signaling pathways are tightly connected ( wang and babitt , 2016 ) , targeting the latter has the potential to efficiently antagonize hepcidin induction under inflammatory conditions .
one strategy exploited the high affinity of bmps to heparin , a glycosaminoglycan that is clinically applied as anticoagulant .
thus , heparin was shown to inhibit hepcidin expression in cells and mice by sequestering bmps , while patients treated with heparin for prevention of deep vein thrombosis had reduced serum hepcidin levels ( poli et al. , 2011 ) .
because the anticoagulant properties of heparin are undesired for interventions to reduce hepcidin excess , glycol - split non - anticoagulant heparins were tested and found to be equally effective as hepcidin inhibitors ; moreover they improved anemia in mouse models of inflammation ( poli et al. , 2014a ) .
highly sulfated heparins with low anticoagulant activity likewise inhibited hepcidin in cells and mice ( poli et al. , 2014b ) .
preservation of high sulfation grade and molecular weight are critical for their hepcidin inhibitory activity ( asperti et al. , 2016 ) .
glycol - split and highly sulfated heparins are good candidates for pharmacological targeting of hepcidin in clinical settings and are amenable to further development .
their efficacy and safety profile needs to be established in randomized controlled trials .
hjv is a bmp co - receptor that enhances iron signaling to hepcidin ( babitt et al. , 2006 ) .
its neutralization by using humanized monoclonal hjv antibodies ( developed by abbvie ) reduced hepcidin expression in rats and cynomolgus monkeys ( boser et al. , 2015 ) .
moreover , they corrected anemia via hepcidin inhibition in rat and mouse models of acd , and in tmprss6 - / - mice ( kovac et al. , 2016 ) .
a secreted soluble hjv form ( shjv ) functions as a competitive inhibitor of bmp binding to bmp receptors ( lin et al. , 2005 ) .
administration of shjv.fc , a fusion of shjv with the fc fragment of immunoglobulin g , reduced hepcidin and ameliorated anemia in a rat model of acd ( theurl et al. , 2011 ) .
two clinical trials sponsored by ferrumax pharmaceuticals inc aimed to use shjv.fc ( fmx - 8 ) for the treatment of patients with renal disease , but were not completed due to inability to recruit patients meeting eligibility criteria ( clinicaltrials.gov identifiers : nct01873534 and nct02228655 ) .
preliminary data of hepcidin inhibition by targeting upstream regulators of the bmp / smad and il - 6 / stat3 pathways with oligonucleotide therapeutics were reported a few years ago ( akinc et al. , 2011 ) , but the current stage of development of these technologies is unknown .
small molecule inhibitors of the bmp / smad pathway have been tested and shown to act as hepcidin - lowering agents .
thus , dorsomorphin , an inhibitor of the type i bmp receptors alk2 , alk3 , and alk6 , prevented hepcidin induction by il - 6 in cells and induced hyperferremia due to hepcidin suppression in mice ( yu et al. , 2008 ) .
furthermore , the dorsomorphin derivative ldn - 193189 , antagonized inflammatory induction of hepcidin in cells and mitigated anemia in rat ( theurl et al. , 2011 ) and mouse ( steinbicker et al. , 2011 ; mayeur et al. , 2015 ) models of acd , and in a rat model of kidney disease ( sun et al. , 2013 ) .
interestingly , suppression of hepcidin by ldn - 193189 was associated with anti - atherogenic responses in apoe - / - mice , which were reversed by exogenous hepcidin ( saeed et al. , 2012 ) .
these findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of hepcidin may be valuable beyond the context of improving erythropoiesis .
nevertheless , dorsomorphin and ldn - 193189 are unlikely to be considered for clinical application due to lack of target specificity ( boergermann et al. , 2010 ) .
tp - 0184 , a specific alk2 inhibitor developed by tolero pharmaceuticals , was recently shown to block inflammatory induction of hepcidin in mouse models of acd and cancer - induced anemia ( peterson et al. , 2015 ) .
further studies are required to assess its suitability for clinical applications .
anemia in elderly persons with chronic inflammatory conditions ( perlstein et al. , 2011 ) and in ckd patients ( zughaier et al. , 2014 ) , is often associated with vitamin d deficiency .
biochemical studies showed that binding of 1,25 - dihydroxy - vitamin d to its receptor directly suppresses hepcidin transcription by binding to a promoter element ( bacchetta et al. , 2014 ) .
importantly , pilot clinical studies demonstrated that vitamin d supplementation can decrease hepcidin levels in healthy volunteers ( bacchetta et al. , 2014 ) and early stage ckd patients ( zughaier et al. , 2014 ) .
these findings underline the potential pharmacological value of vitamin d as a hepcidin - lowering agent , which needs to be further explored in animal models and randomized controlled trials .
direct inhibition of hepcidin by neutralizing antibodies or other inhibitory molecules offers further opportunities for mitigating the adverse effects of hepcidin overexpression .
neutralizing hepcidin antibodies were shown to modulate iron metabolism in mice and cynomolgus monkeys ; moreover , they improved erythropoiesis and responses to esa therapy in mouse models of acd ( sasu et al. , 2010 ; cooke et al. , 2013 ) .
ly2787106 , a monoclonal hepcidin antibody developed by eli lily and company was evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with cancer - associated anemia ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier : nct01340976 ) .
the antibody treatment was well tolerated and resulted in transient iron mobilization and increased reticulocyte count relative to baseline ( vadhan - raj et al. , 2015 ) .
neutralization of hepcidin is also possible by using relatively high molecular weight antagonists .
pieris pharmaceuticals inc generated prs - 080 , a pegylated anticalin protein that specifically binds to hepcidin and inhibits its activity .
following successful initial testing in vitro and in mice ( hohlbaum et al. , 2011 ) , the pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of prs - 080 were assessed in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier : nct02340572 ) .
the results were encouraging and a further trial is planned with anemic ckd patients ( moebius et al. , 2015 ) .
noxxon pharma ag generated nox - h94 ( lexaptepid pegol ) , a spiegelmer hepcidin antagonist .
this pegylated non - natural mirror - image l - oligoribonucleotide binds with high affinity to hepcidin and operates as a specific inhibitor .
nox - h94 administration improved inflammation - related anemia in cynomolgus monkeys ( schwoebel et al. , 2013 ) .
moreover , nox - h94 prevented hypoferremia in experimental human endotoxemia with lps - injected volunteers ( van eijk et al. , 2014 ) ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier : nct01522794 ) .
nox - h94 is currently being evaluated in another three phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials on patients with cancer - related anemia , acd or ckd ( clinicaltrials.gov identifiers : nct01691040 , nct01372137 , and nct02079896 ) .
a chemical screen for small molecule hepcidin antagonists identified fursultiamine , a thiol - reactive thiamine derivative that binds to ferroportin on c326 and thereby precludes the binding of hepcidin ( fung et al. , 2013 ) .
this drug is available over - the - counter for treating vitamin b1 deficiency .
while it efficiently protected ferroportin against hepcidin in cultured cells , it failed to exhibit in vivo anti - hepcidin activity , possibly due to rapid plasma turnover .
these results suggest that fursultiamine could only be further considered as a hepcidin - lowering agent if modified to stable derivatives , or delivered in formulations that enable sustained controlled release .
nevertheless , they also show that blocking the hepcidin - binding site of ferroportin offers another option for pharmacological targeting the hepcidin / ferroportin axis .
along these lines , eli lily and company developed a monoclonal ferroportin antibody ( ly2928057 ) , which increased iron mobilization in cynomolgus monkeys by binding to ferroportin and thereby inhibiting access to hepcidin ( witcher et al. , 2013 ) .
ly2928057 is currently being evaluated in two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers and anemic ckd patients ( clinicaltrials.gov identifiers : nct01330953 and nct01991483 ) .
conclusions hepcidin is a master hormonal regulator of systemic iron homeostasis .
under physiological conditions , its expression remains within a relatively narrow window .
misregulation of hepcidin is associated with a broad spectrum of disorders ranging from iron overload states to anemias with iron - restricted erythropoiesis .
correction of hepcidin levels can provide an etiologic cure to some of these disorders ( hh , irida ) , or offer therapeutic benefits to others ( thalassemia , acd ) .
several agonists and antagonists of hepcidin have been developed .
the ones that have been validated in preclinical or clinical settings are summarized in table 2 ( inducers / mimetics ) and table 3 ( antagonists ) .
these drugs act at different levels through the hepcidin / ferroportin axis .
promising candidates are currently being further evaluated in randomized controlled trials .
a major challenge for using hepcidin therapeutics is to maintain physiological concentrations of circulating hepcidin , and thereby avoid a shift from hepcidin deficiency to excess and vice versa .

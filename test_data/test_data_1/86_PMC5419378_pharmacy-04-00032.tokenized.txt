the infectious diseases society of america and the society for healthcare epidemiology of america " guidelines for developing an institutional program to enhance antimicrobial stewardship " recommend the use of computer - based surveillance programs for efficient and thorough identification of potential interventions as part of an antimicrobial stewardship program ( asp ) .
this retrospective study examined the benefit of utilizing a clinical surveillance software program to help guide antimicrobial therapy in an inpatient setting , in a small community hospital , without a formal asp .
the electronic health record ( ehr ) was used to retrieve documentations for the following types of antibiotic interventions : culture surveillance , duplicate therapy , duration of therapy and renal dose adjustments .
the numbers of interventions made during the three - month periods before and after implementation of the clinical surveillance software were compared .
antibiotic related interventions aggregated to 144 and 270 in the pre - and post - implementation time frame , respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the total number of antibiotic interventions overall and interventions in three of the four sub - categories increased significantly from the pre - implementation to post - implementation period .
clinical surveillance software is a valuable tool to assist pharmacists in evaluating antimicrobial therapy .
antibiotic interventions antimicrobial stewardship program clinical surveillance software sentri7 ( r ) 1 .
introduction antimicrobial stewardship has been gaining attention as infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms and costs associated with antibiotic use escalate across the country .
highlighting the need for intervention , the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) issued a finalized version of an infection control survey in 2015 that included written policies and procedures to improve antibiotic use [ 1 ] .
the infectious diseases society of america ( idsa ) has published two different guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship [ 2,3 ] .
both guidelines recommend the use of clinical decision - support and surveillance programs .
current studies that focus on the use of surveillance programs have been conducted at academic medical centers with an established asps [ 4,5 ] .
these studies have shown decreased antibiotic costs [ 4 ] and an upsurge of interventions [ 4,5 ] .
in a study that covered antibiotic use over a seven - year period , pestotnik et al .
[ 6 ] demonstrated a decrease in antibiotic cost and antibiotic - associated adverse drug events with the use of antibiotic management support programs .
evans et al .
[ 7 ] showed similar trends in antibiotic use , where implementation of a computer - assisted management program significantly improved antibiotic - susceptibility mismatch , adverse reactions , dose adjustment and a reduction in cost of antibiotics and length of hospital stays .
various software programs can be linked to ehrs , such as epic ( verona , wi , usa ) , and cerner ( north kansas city , mo , usa ) , to streamline the asp .
algorithms are configured in the software programs by end users [ 8 ] .
the system allows hospitals to customize clinical rules for appropriate antibiotic use in a given setting .
the use of clinical surveillance software , such as sentri7 ( r ) ( bellevue , washington , dc , usa ) , reduces the time needed for interventions as compared to reviewing various daily paper reports [ 9 ]. by interfacing with ehrs , the tools allow pharmacists to evaluate antibiotics , culture results and clinical diagnoses [ 10,11 ] .
sentri7 ( r ) , which is linked to epic at unitypoint health - st. luke 's , was reviewed daily by clinical pharmacists .
the diverse categories populate in sentri7 ( r ) when potential opportunities for changes in therapies are possible .
pharmacists use promptings from sentri7 ( r ) to direct a more thorough evaluation of each patient regarding specific areas of concern .
the purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a clinical surveillance software sentri7 ( r ) on the number of interventions made by pharmacists at a community hospital without an established asp .
2. methods the study was approved by the institutional review board .
it was conducted at unitypoint health - st. luke 's , a 151 - bed community hospital in sioux city , ia , usa , which does not have a formal asp .
it was a retrospective evaluation of all electronically documented pharmacist interventions for three months before ( may to july , 2014 ) and after ( september to november , 2014 ) implementation of a clinical surveillance software ( sentri7 ( r ) , wolters kluwer health ) .
the month of implementation was excluded to allow pharmacy staff familiarization with the program .
prior to the institution 's use of the clinical surveillance software , pharmacists did not have the same quality and quantity of opportunities for interventions .
regarding antibiotics , information was found most often when health care providers consulted pharmacy staff for input , when pharmacists noticed potential issues on reviewing patients' charts for other problems , or based on culture reports sent from the laboratory .
interventions were recorded through an epic i - vent function in the course of routine order reviews and verifications by different pharmacists .
there was no systematic way of identifying antimicrobial stewardship interventions .
after implementation , pharmacists on clinical shifts were tasked with reviewing sentri7 ( r ) through the course of the day and acting on all alerts. through the use of sentri7 ( r ) , review of patients' charts was streamlined .
the ehr was used to identify all interventions documented by pharmacists in the specified time periods .
interventions were included in the analysis if they were able to be placed in one of the following sub - categories : culture surveillance , antibiotic renal dose adjustment , duration of antibiotic therapy , or duplicate antibiotic therapy .
interventions were excluded from the analysis if they were physician - initiated ( including pharmacy - to - dose consults ) or if there was insufficient documentation to correctly categorize the intervention .
if multiple interventions were recorded under the same documentation , each documented intervention was counted only once .
the total numbers of interventions and those interventions within each antibiotic sub - category in the pre - and post - implementation periods were compared for statistical significance by using the chi - square ( chi2 ) test .
the total number of patient days in the respective two periods was used to compare the rates of interventions .
3. results a total of 3576 interventions were reviewed in the pre - implementation and 4409 in the post - implementation period .
out of this , 144 and 270 interventions in the respective periods were antibiotic - related .
the average admission rate was 881 per month in both periods , while the total patient days were 9397 and 10,217 for the three - month period before and after implementation of the program , respectively , caused by slightly longer hospital stays .
in the pre - implementation period , 10 antibiotic interventions were excluded for lack of information and 89 were excluded due to being physician - initiated .
in the post - implementation period , 19 antibiotic interventions were excluded for lack of information and 144 were excluded due to being physician - initiated .
each sub - category of antibiotic interventions was analyzed ( table 1 ) .
the most common intervention type in both periods was antibiotic dose adjustment , followed by culture surveillance ( table 1 ) .
a total of 144 interventions in the pre - implementation and 270 in the post - implementation period were compared .
there were 1.6 and 2.6 interventions per 1000 patient days , respectively in the two periods ( p < 0.0001 ) .
significantly more interventions were made post - implementation in the culture surveillance , duration of antibiotic therapy , and duplicate antibiotic therapy categories .
the difference in the number of interventions in the antibiotic renal dose adjustment category was not significant .
as a result of antibiotic interventions , 45 out of 144 ( 31.3 %) and 98 out of 270 ( 36.3 %) recommendations were accepted during pre - and post - sentri7 ( r ) periods , respectively .
4. discussion sentri7 ( r ) provides intervention suggestions after an alert is generated .
the software supports antimicrobial management by triggering alerts from as many as 150 pre - built rules .
it also provides an antibiotic review based on laboratory culture and susceptibility reports [ 9 ] .
before implementation of the sentri7 ( r ) software program at our institution , clinical pharmacists received a facsimile of all positive cultures from the laboratory each day , although it was not consistently reviewed .
this proved to be a time consuming and cumbersome process .
there were no other set methods of reviewing for potential antibiotic related interventions .
prior to implementation , the clinical rules for the software were developed by a team of clinical pharmacists at unitypoint health and then customized locally by our institution at the time of the implementation of the program ( table 2 ) .
alerts for interventions were produced immediately in sentri7 ( r ) software , which prompted clinical pharmacists to review all alerts in the program on a daily basis and make appropriate interventions , either by leaving notes for physicians in the ehr , directly contacting physicians , or making changes as allowed by the hospital formulary and collaborative practice guidelines .
while studies have shown the benefit of the use of a clinical surveillance software , there is a lack of data on its use in hospitals without an established asp and dedicated infectious disease pharmacists .
this study showed that implementation of a clinical surveillance software in a hospital without an established asp can increase the number of antibiotic interventions .
interventions increased in multiple categories related to antimicrobial stewardship , showing that this can be a valuable tool to support clinical pharmacist generalists .
when antimicrobial stewardship programs become a requirement for all hospitals , incorporation of clinical decision support tools , such as sentri7 ( r ) , will be helpful .
as site - specific rules were developed at our institution , the challenges encountered were related to the cost of purchasing sentri7 ( r ) software , validations to ensure clinical data were crossing correctly from main ehr ( epic ) to sentri7 ( r ) and testing the rule sets .
the pharmacy staff was in - serviced before roll - out .
since the software rules were intuitive and easy to follow , it did not take long for the staff to be acclimated to the asp .
there are two potential explanations for the lack of significant differences in the dose change category .
one is the exclusion of pharmacy - to - dose consults in the review .
many renal dose changes would have been included under such consults , and the tool likely helped pharmacists catch necessary dose changes after the initial consult .
a second explanation is that renal dosing was already being successfully captured upon initial verification before use of the tool .
further analysis is warranted to describe the impact of such effects .
5. limitations one limitation of this study is the timing of the post - implementation period .
this time period was chosen in order to limit the analysis to the original rules , as new rules were regularly added to the program in the year after implementation .
because the analysis immediately followed implementation , pharmacists were acclimating to the program .
increases in interventions would be expected as new rules are added , pharmacists become more comfortable with use of the tool , and physicians get accustomed to different pharmacy recommendations .
also , interventions were only counted if proper documentation is done in the ehr , and some interventions may not have been documented .
a second limitation of this study is the use of a number of interventions as the primary outcome .
while increased pharmacist interventions may be assumed to lead to benefits in direct patient care , variables such as length of hospitalization and possible antimicrobial cost savings , further analysis would be needed to determine such correlation .
generalizability of these results may also be limited due to the lack of formal antimicrobial stewardship activities prior to implementation .
hospitals that already have robust asps or experienced infectious disease pharmacists may not see a significant increase in the number of interventions made .
6. conclusions the total number of relevant antibiotic interventions increased significantly from pre - implementation to post - implementation of sentri7 ( r ) .
significant increases were seen in all categories except for antibiotic dose adjustment .
based on its ability to help pharmacists more consistently and efficiently identify interventions , clinical surveillance software is a valuable tool in smaller hospitals to assist pharmacists in evaluating antimicrobial therapy .
going forward , conditions of participation will require all hospitals to develop and implement programs to improve antibiotic use .

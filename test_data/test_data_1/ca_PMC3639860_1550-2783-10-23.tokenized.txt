background muslim bodybuilders often continue training during ramadan .
however , the effect of resistance training in a fasted versus a fed state during ramadan on body composition and metabolic parameters in bodybuilders is not well known .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resistance training in a fasted versus a fed state during ramadan on body composition and metabolic parameters in bodybuilders .
methods sixteen men were allocated to two groups : eight practicing resistance training in the late afternoon in a fasted state ( fast ) , and eight training in the late evening in an acutely fed state ( fed ) during ramadan .
all visited the laboratory in the morning two days before the start of ramadan ( bef - r ) and on the 29th day of ramadan ( end - r ) for anthropometric measurement , completion of a dietary questionnaire , and provision of fasting blood and urine samples .
results body mass and body fat percentage remained unchanged in fast and fed during the whole period of the investigation .
both fast and fed experienced an increase in the following parameters from bef - r to end - r : urine specific gravity ( 1 % ; p = 0.028 , p = 0.004 respectively ) , serum concentrations of urea ( 4 % , p = 0.006 ; 7 % , p = 0.004 respectively ) , creatinine ( 5 % , p = 0.015 ; 6 % , p = 0.04 respectively ) , uric acid ( 17 % ; p < 0.001 , p = 0.04 respectively ) , sodium ( 1 % ; p = 0.029 , p = 0.019 respectively ) , chloride ( 2 % ; p = 0.039 , p = 0.004 respectively ) , and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 11 % , p = 0.04 ; 10 % , p = 0.04 respectively ) .
conclusion hypertrophic training in a fasted or in a fed state during ramadan does not affect body mass and body composition of bodybuilders .
additionally , ramadan fasting induced changes in urinary and some biochemical parameters , but these changes were not different according to when the training occurred .
resistance training dehydration renal function body fat percentage islamic fasting introduction most muslims fast during the holy month of ramadan from dawn till sunset , when they neither eat nor drink , as it forms one of the fundamental obligations of the muslim faith [ 1 ] .
the ramadan month occurs eleven days earlier every year and thus over time may occur in any of the four seasons [ 2 ] .
therefore , the length of the daily fast during ramadan varies from 11 - 18 hours in tropical countries [ 3 ] .
not only is the eating pattern by necessity altered during ramadan , the type of food eaten during the night may also be different from that usually consumed during the rest of the year [ 4 ] .
energy and water intake are often reduced during this month [ 5,6 ] , which may result in reduced body mass [ 5,6 ] and changed hydration status .
participants of ramadan often maintain physical activity during the holy month for recreation and health purposes , and this has the potential to further affect body mass and produce dehydration .
the few investigations that have examined the effect of ramadan fasting on the hydration status of sportsmen report conflicting findings .
for example , while urine osmolarity increased in emirates soccer players [ 7 ] indicating a state of dehydration , the absence of change in urine specific gravity has been reported in turkish [ 8 ] and tunisian [ 9 ] soccer players .
further , the interaction between participation in ramadan and exercise and subsequent effects on circulating metabolites are also poorly understood .
resting serum glucose has been reported to decrease during ramadan in moderately trained runners [ 10 ] , soccer and basketball players [ 11 ] and runners [ 12 ] , but not to change in elite rugby players [ 5 ] , weight lifters [ 13 ] and physically active men [ 1,2 ] .
part of this conflict in findings may be due to the difference in time of the day , during which the training was conducted .
for example , if the training was performed in the afternoon or early evening towards the latter part of the daily fast , the physiological stresses would be quite different to those if training was undertaken soon after breaking the fast .
certainly it is now well established that training after a 12 hour fast induces significantly different metabolic adaptations than training performed immediately after a meal [ 13 ] .
muslim athletes , including strength athletes , employ a variety of coping strategies to deal with the challenges of training and / or competing during the month of ramadan [ 14,15 ] .
some muslim athletes train at night to prevent dehydration , hypoglycemia and possible decrements in performance .
however , it has been demonstrated that resistance training ( weight lifting ) in a fasted state affects the post - workout anabolic response to weight training more favorably than training after a fed - state , but only when a carbohydrate / protein / leucine mixture was ingested following a heavy resistance training session [ 16 ] .
there is an ample amount of evidence that ingestion of protein after exercise will stimulate net muscle protein synthesis [ 17 ] .
this begs the question as to whether the daytime resistance training during ramadan ( i.e. fasted state training ) , might accelerate adaptations to training and ultimately result in increasing muscle mass , although risk of dehydration and hypoglycemia may be increased .
published data describing the effects of ramadan on body composition and biochemical parameters following resistance training are scarce .
the only published studies that have observed the effects of resistance exercise during ramadan have lacked the control group performing equivalent exercises in the acutely fasted state [ 18,19 ] , therefore , no specific effects of resistance training while fasted were identified .
it is clear that well designed scientific studies , investigating the effect of resistance training in the fasted state during ramadan on body composition and markers of renal function , inflammation and immunity , are currently lacking .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resistance training during ramadan on body composition and markers of renal function , inflammation and immunity of bodybuilders as well as to ascertain whether there is a difference between daytime resistance training in a fasted state and nighttime resistance training in a fed state .
we hypothesized that resistance training could be safely practiced during ramadan with decrements in body composition and circulating markers of health ( renal function , immunity and inflammation ) .
it was also hypothesized that resistance training in the fasted state would lead to increased levels of markers of dehydration , while positively affecting the change in lean body mass when compared to nighttime training after the fast was broken .
methods subjects sixteen male bodybuilders were recruited into the study and randomly allocated to two groups : eight participants trained in a fasted state ( fast ) , and 8 trained in a fed state ( fed ) during ramadan .
each of the subjects regularly performed bodybuilding ( hypertrophic program ) for recreational purposes at least 3 times / week but did not participate in national or international bodybuilding competitions .
the subjects' descriptive characteristics are provided in table 1 .

to qualify as subjects the men a ) were nonsmokers b ) had no current or past history of anabolic steroid use ( according to self - report ) ; c ) had at least 1 year of bodybuilding training experience ; d ) had not ingested any ergogenic supplement for an 8 - week period prior to the start of the study ; and e ) agreed not to ingest any other nutritional supplements , or non - prescription drugs that might affect the study parameters .
prior to enrolling in the study , subjects were informed of the experimental procedures as well as the potential risks and benefits associated with the study ; however , subjects were not informed of the study 's purpose .
to be included in the study , each subject provided written consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
the study was approved by the research ethics committee of the faculty of medicine of the university of sfax , sfax , tunisia .
experimental design ramadan began on august 1 and ended on august 30 , 2011 .
the average duration of the fast was approximately 15 h. the study was conducted in tunisia , where daytime temperatures were 34 +/ - 1degreesc and relative humidity was 57 +/ - 4 % .
subjects visited the laboratory on two separate occasions : two days before ramadan ( bef - r ) and on the 29th day of ramadan ( end - r ) .
in the morning of each visit ( approximately 10:30 a.m. ) , they underwent anthropometric measurements , completed a dietary questionnaire , and provided fasting blood and urine samples .
they were instructed not to consume any food or energy - containing beverage after 11:00 p.m. on the day before each visit .
because of the time of sunset , this meant that the fasting subjects had only four hours ( between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. ) on the evening before the test at end - r in which to consume food and fluid .
seventeen days before the beginning of ramadan , subjects underwent a test of 10 repetitions maximum ( 10 rm ) for the following exercises : bench press , barbell squat , biceps curl , lying triceps curl , seated shoulder press behind the neck and barbell row .
during the 10 rm testing , the mass of all weight plates and bars that were used was determined with a precision scale .
the actual mass of all plates and bars was then used to calculate the 10 rm of each exercise .
during the 10 rm tests , each subject had a maximum of 5 attempts on each exercise with 2 - to 5 - minute intervals between attempts .
after each attempt , subjects add or remove weight as required .
after the 10 rm load in a specific exercise was determined , an interval no shorter than 10 minutes was allowed before the 10 rm determination of the next exercise .
standard exercise techniques were followed for each exercise .
no pause was allowed between the eccentric and the concentric phase of a repetition or between repetitions .
for a repetition to be successful , a complete range of motion as is normally defined for the exercise had to be completed .
the testing procedures met the criteria proposed by kraemer and fry [ 20 ] .
to avoid potential confounding effects of prior exercise on blood circulating biochemical and hematological parameters , subjects were instructed to practice only a light training session within the 36 - h period before they undertook the laboratory assessments .
during the two weeks before and during ramadan , subjects recorded their exercise sessions along with their rating of perceived exertion ( rpe ) on the borg scale [ 21 ] ( table 2 ) in a training journal .
all subjects were familiarized with the use of the rpe scale before the commencement of the study .
during ramadan , exercise sessions of fast occurred in the late afternoon ( between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. ) and those of fed occurred at night ( between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. ) after the break of fasting .
the number of training sessions , sets , repetitions in each set , total training volume and rpe did not change in either fast or fed during the duration of the study ( table 2 ) .
additionally , no differences in the number of training sessions , number of sets , the number of repetition in each set , total training volume and rpe existed between fast and fed at any time period .

bodybuilding training program the resistance training program employed both free weights and machines .
the primary goal of the program was to increase muscle mass ( hypertrophic program ) , so closely followed the principles documented by the american college of sports medicine ( acsm ) for producing effective gains in muscle hypertrophy [ 22 ] .
briefly , four training sessions each week were conducted by each subject , and each training session was composed of four to six specific exercises .
each exercise was performed in four sets with a load of 10 rm and intervals of 2 - 3 min between sets .
the exercises were conducted first with the major muscle groups and , then , with the smaller muscle groups .
training intensity was increased progressively as needed , by adding weight lifted , to ensure that target intensity was maintained as subjects got stronger and set workloads became easier .
the first day of the week 's training program was devoted to the development of quadriceps , hamstring and calves using barbell squat , hack squat , leg extensions , lying leg curl and seated calve raise .
the second day was devoted to the development of back and triceps using barbell row , one - arm dumbbell row , wide - grip lat pulldown , dip machine , lying triceps curl and standing dumbell triceps extension , and the third devoted to the development of shoulders using seated shoulder press behind the neck , side lateral raise , front dumbbell raise and seated bent - over rear deltoid raise .
the fourth day was devoted to the development of chest and biceps using barbell bench press ( medium grip ) , barbell incline bench press ( medium grip ) , decline barbell bench press , barbell curl , one arm dumbbell preacher curl and hammer curls .
other exercises were incorporated in the training program each week .
a certified strength and conditioning specialists closely supervised all subjects perform each training session .
the total training volume was estimated using the following equation : training volume = total number of sets x total number of repetitions [ 22 ] .
body composition body weight was measured to the nearest 10 g using a calibrated electronic scale ( seca instruments ltd. , germany ) , and height was measured to the nearest 5 mm using a stadiometer .
body mass index ( bmi ) was then calculated .
skinfold thickness was measured by an experienced ( trained ) anthropometrist in triplicate using calibrated harpenden calipers ( harpenden , uk ) at four standardized sites ( biceps , triceps , subscapular , and suprailium ) .
those measurements followed the protocol of the international society for the advancement of kinanthropometry [ 23 ] .
the level of technical error measurements of the anthropometrist was 6 % .
body fat percentage ( bf %) was estimated from skinfold measures using a previously published algorithm [ 24 ] .
lean body mass ( lbm ) was calculated as body weight minus body fat mass .
dietary intake analysis subjects were instructed to record the estimated quantities of all food and beverages consumed during the week before ramadan and then three days / week during ramadan .
dietary records were analyzed using the bilnut program ( nutrisoft , cerelles , france ) and the food - composition tables of the national institute of statistics of tunis ( 1978 ) .
total water intake was defined as the fluid volume of consumed beverages plus the water content of consumed foods .
urine specific gravity urine specific gravity was assessed from 30 ml of urine collected from each subject immediately before the anthropometrical measurement .
it was measured to the nearest 0.001 unit with a hand refractometer ( atago,japan ) .
serum biochemistry during each session , venous blood samples (~ 7 ml ) were taken from an antecubital vein and collected into a plain blood tube in a seated position in a room controlled temperature and relative humidity ( 23 +/ - 3degreesc and 47 % +/ - 5 % respectively ) .
an aliquot of blood was immediately removed and mixed with ethylene diaminetetraaceticacid ( edta ) as an anticoagulant .
these blood samples were analyzed for total leucocytes , neutrophils , lymphocytes and monocytes using an automated analyzer ( beckman coulter , coulter lh 750 analyzer , uk ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
the remaining blood was allowed to clot and was then centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min at 4degreesc .
an aliquot of the serum was used to measure serum glucose immediately after the centrifugation step ; the remainder was then stored at - 20degreesc for subsequent analysis .
an automated analyzer ( beckman coulter dxc 600 , uk ) measured the concentrations of biochemical parameters using the appropriate reagents ( beckman coulter , uk ) .
glucose , uric acid , total cholesterol ( tc ) and triglycerides ( tg ) were determined using an enzymatic colorimetric method ( glucose oxidase , uricase , lipoprotein lipase - glycerol kinase reactions , cholesterol esterase - cholesteroloxidase reactions , respectively ) .
urea was determined using an enzymatic method .
urea is first converted by urease into ammonia which is then estimated by the reaction with alpha - ketoglutarate catalyzed by glutamic dehydrogenase .
creatinine concentrations were determined by the jaffe method in which creatinine directly reacts with alkaline picrate resulting in the formation of a red colour .
creatinine clearance was determined using the formula of cockroft and gault .
[ 25 ] : creatinine clearance ( ml * min - 1 ) = 1.25 x body mass ( kg ) x ( 140 - age ( y )) : creatinine ( mumol * l - 1 ) .
sodium , potassium and chloride concentrations were determined by potentiometry .
c - reactive protein concentrations were determined using a turbidimetric method .
in the reaction , c - reactive protein combines with specific antibody to form insoluble antigen - antibody complexes .
high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) concentrations were determined by immuno - inhibition .
low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) was calculated using the friedewald formula [ 26 ] : ldl - c ( mmol * l - 1 ) = tc - hdl - c - tg : 2.2 .
the ratios tc : hdl - c and ldl - c : hdl - c were derived from the respective concentrations .
creatine kinase ( ck ) , lactatedehydrogenase ( ldh ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) and gamma - glutamyl transferase ( gamma - gt ) activity were determined using an enzymatic method .
statistical analyses all statistical tests were performed using statistica software ( statsoft , paris , france ) .
the distribution of all dependent variables was examined by the shapiro - wilk test and was found not to differ significantly from normal .
a 2 ( periods ) x 2 ( fast or fed ) repeated - measures analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied .
if a significant interaction was present , a bonferroni post - hoc test was performed where appropriate .
if a non - significant interaction was present , a paired or independent t - test was preformed where appropriate .
effect sizes were calculated as partial eta - squared etap2 to estimate the meaningfulness of significant findings .
partial eta squared values of 0.01 , 0.06 and 0.13 represent small , moderate , and large effect sizes , respectively .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
all data are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( m +/ - sd ) .
results dietary intake dietary intake before and during ramadan is presented in table 3 .
estimated mean daily energy intake bef - r was similar between fast and fed .
calculated daily energy intake during ramadan did not significantly change in either group compared with bef - r. carbohydrate and fat consumption increased by 9 % ( p = 0.003 ) and 5 % ( p = 0.05 ) respectively in fed during ramadan , though consumption of these macronutrients did not significantly change in fast during the month .
protein consumption during ramadan did not change in either group compared with bef - r. expressed as a percentage of daily macronutrient intake , protein , carbohydrates , and fat consumption did not change in fast and fed during ramadan .
further , the proportion of total energy expressed as grams per kilogram body mass per day from carbohydrates increased in fed ( p = 0.006 ) ; and remained unchanged in fast during ramadan .
both fat and protein intakes ( expressed as grams per kilogram body mass per day ) did not change during ramadan in either group .
potassium intake in fed decreased by 14 % ( p = 0.019 ) from bef - r to end - r , and it remained unchanged in fast .
total water intake decreased by 15 % ( p = 0.039 ) in fast and by 13 % ( p = 0.004 ) in fed during ramadan .

discussion the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of participation in ramadan on body composition and circulating markers of renal function , immunity and inflammation in men , who continue to perform resistance training .
a second aim was to determine whether training at night ( in the acutely fed state ) altered the impact of ramadan compared to when training was undertaken during the day ( in a fasted state ) .
our results showed , contrary to our hypothesis , that whether resistance training was conducted in a fed or fasted state , no significant effect on body mass or body composition of bodybuilders was revealed after four weeks .
in addition , even though ramadan fasting induced changes in urinary and some biochemical parameters , these changes were not different according to the state ( fed vs fasted ) in which training occurred .
body mass and body composition did not change in either fast or fed during ramadan .
our results do not concur with the other published studies [ 4,27 ] .
for example , trabelsi et al .
[ 2 ] demonstrated that fasted - state aerobic training resulted in a decrease in body mass as well as fat percent in physically active men .
however , those changes were absent if an equivalent amount of aerobic exercise was performed in a fed state during ramadan [ 2 ] .
the discrepancy between that finding and the present study is likely due to a difference in the exercise regime ; aerobic exercise will provide a better stimulus to induce fat oxidation than does resistance training .
notably , participation in ramadan alone appears to improve the ability to utilize lipid during aerobic exercise [ 28 ] , perhaps , providing an increased opportunity to reduce body fat stores if exercise is performed regularly during the fasting month .
it appears that despite participation in ramadan , lean body mass was maintained with no increase in body fat percentage .
this may be largely because of the lack of change of training volume in this bodybuilder cohort .
in addition , it is worth noting that energy and macronutrient intakes did not change during ramadan and were consistent with the recommendation proposed by slater and phillips [ 29 ] for bodybuilders to induce hypertrophy .
however , the use of a non - invasive method to measure changes in body composition ( e.g. , dexa ) in future studies of ramadan is warranted to confirm this finding .
urine specific gravity increased during ramadan in both groups , which is consistent with some degree of dehydration [ 30 ] , was previously observed with high intensity exercise training [ 31 ] .
this state of dehydration has been previously attributed to a reduction of fluid intake [ 2,5,6 ] .
it is likely our results can be similarly explained .
however , in our previous work we have observed the urine specific gravity of subjects performing aerobic exercise before breaking the fast increasing during ramadan , but absent in subjects practicing the equivalent amount of aerobic exercise after breaking the fast [ 2 ] .
however , it is worth noting that our subjects had only about 4 hours to consume food or fluid after sunset on the day before the sample collection during ramadan .
it may well be that this was insufficient time to allow full hydration .
thus , our results concerning the hydration status of our subjects may be influenced independently of ramadan .
markers of renal function showed a similar trend , increasing in both groups .
those findings were previously observed in subjects practicing aerobic exercise during ramadan [ 2 ] .
sodium and chloride concentrations increased in both groups during ramadan .
a chronic state of mild dehydration in both groups may explain the abovementioned increase of serum electrolytes and renal function markers .
interestingly ramadan fasting did not affect serum potassium concentrations in fed .
due to the dehydration and the elevations in serum sodium that occurred in fed , one might expect that increases in serum potassium concentrations would also be observed .
however , a decrease in potassium intake may have offset any effects on serum potassium caused by dehydration [ 32 ] .
hdl - c increased during ramadan in fast and fed , at variance with our previous work [ 2 ] .
the rise in hdl - c was explained previously by change in body mass [ 2,33 ] or fat intakes [ 34 ] .
however , in the present study , body mass did not change in either group while fat intakes increased only in fed .
thus , the rise of proportion of fat intakes during ramadan can explain the increase in hdl - c in fed ; although mechanisms by which fasting increases hdl - c in fast remain unclear .
further investigation is needed to resolve this issue. whether ramadan fasting affects cellular damage was also investigated in the present study .
serum ck , alt , ast , alt , ap and gamma - gt were measured to assess the effect of ramadan fasting on cellular damage biomarkers of bodybuilders .
ramadan fasting did not affect any of these variables and is in accordance with previous reports observing sedentary persons [ 35 ] .
nevertheless , to our knowledge , our study is the first to investigate the effect of ramadan fasting on these parameters in men who undertake resistance training during ramadan .
serum c - reactive protein concentrations reflect the activity of cytokine - mediated inflammatory processes and are roughly proportional to the extent of tissue injury [ 36 ] .
c - reactive protein did not change in either group and this perhaps could be explained by the lack of effect of ramadan fasting on cellular damage biomarkers .
akin to previous studies in judokas [ 37 ] , ramadan had no impact on leukocyte count .
thus , in this context at least , continuation of resistance training whilst participation in ramadan can be performed safely .
it is worth noting that effect sizes of the parameters measured in the current study were consistent but rather low .
this , and the small number of participants my have resulted in type ii error for some of the parameters measured. with this in mind , replication of the study with more participants during ramadan would be difficult because of recruitment , but may result in further significant findings .
nevertheless , we have previously observed metabolic changes with participation in ramadan with similar numbers of subjects [ 28 ] .
conclusion in conclusion , hypertrophic resistance training , unlike aerobic training , was not affected , at least in terms of body composition and markers of immune and inflammatory systems , when performed in a fed compared to a fasted state during ramadan .
however , resistance training performed during ramadan was associated with an improved lipid profile and evidence of mild dehydration which may alters parameters indicative of renal function .
in terms of a practical application , trainers should educate bodybuilders on the importance of hydration during the nighttime in order to compensate for the dehydration that occurs during daytime within the month ramadan .
in addition the trainers should stress the importance of adopting a nutritional protocol similar to that of the normal non - fasting period .

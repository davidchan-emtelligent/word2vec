calcaneal fractures are considered uncommon accounting for 0.005 - 0.41 % of all children fractures .
few reports concerning treatment are available .
most of these fractures are non - displaced / minimally displaced and are associated with a fall of less than 1 m. the aim of this case report was to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of a child calcaneal fracture , an atypical presentation despite the high energy mechanism of trauma .
a 7 - year - old child fell from a 5 - m ladder with all his weight on his right heel .
significantly hind - foot reduced range of motion associated with a lateral / plantar calcaneal swelling and pain was found .
neurovascular examination and other parts of the body were normal .
radiograph showed an undisplaced calcaneal body fracture and computed tomography confirmed no subtalar joint involvement .
a splint followed by plaster was applied .
weight bearing and deambulation were not allowed .
after 4 weeks , no pain and limping was reported by the child 's parents .
plaster was removed and radiograph showed fracture consolidation .
patient had no complaints of pain , no restrictions in range of motion and normal walking .
limping in children is a difficult complaint to assess .
differential diagnoses of a calcaneal fractures should be performed , even without a history of trauma or a history of trivial trauma .
calcaneal fracture child computed tomography introduction tarsal fractures in children are considered extremely rare and account for less than 1 % of all fractures in the childhood [ 1 ] .
calcaneal fractures are uncommon tarsal fractures accounting for about 0.005 - 0.41 % [ 2 - 4 ] .
few reports in the literature concerning the fracture treatment are available [ 5 - 9 ] ; the first case of this fracture in a child was reported in 1969 by thomas [ 10 ] , followed by another case by moyson et al [ 11 ] in 1971 .
these publications have increased over the last decades [ 2 , 12 - 17 ] .
most of calcaneal fractures are non - displaced [ 7 ] or minimally displaced [ 17 ] due to the low body weight and higher amount of cartilage [ 13 ] associated with the most common mechanism of trauma : fall of less than 1 m [ 9 ] .
seventy - five percent of calcaneal fractures are extra - articular [ 18 ] and intra - articular fractures are considered even more rare [ 17 ] .
the aim of this case report was to relate and discuss the diagnosis and the treatment of a calcaneal fracture in a child which is an atypical presentation despite the high energy mechanism of trauma .
case report a 7 - year - old child previously healthy has fallen from a ladder of 5 m on which the child has risen to play in a small time of carelessness of parents .
he was found by his parents crying and limping and reported pain in the right hind - foot region .
immediately parents sought our medical emergence service .
following a long anamnesis it was concluded that patient has fallen standing with all his weight on his right heel .
the child did not report pain in any other part of his body .
a prolonged and detailed physical examination was performed .
lateral and plantar calcaneal swelling were found .
no hematoma was present .
limping and pain was also present .
during examination , the patient had significantly hind - foot reduced range of motion associated with pain .
no abrasion and skin lacerations were present .
neurovascular examination demonstrated no abnormalities .
radiographic examination ( fig. 1 ) showed in an axial view an undisplaced calcaneal body fracture .
an ankle splint was applied with the foot maintained in a neutral position ( 90degrees of flexion ) .
in order to exclude the involvement of the subtalar joint , an elective computed tomography ( ct ) was solicited .
one week after injury , the parents followed the child for review .
no complaint was referred by the patient and the ct was evaluated ( fig. 2 ) .
no subtalar joint involvement was found and an extra - articular calcaneal body fracture was confirmed .
the splint was replaced by a plaster .
weight bearing and deambulation were not allowed to the patient .
figure 1 lateral and axial image of the right calcaneal .
lateral view has not shown signs of fracture .
the axial view revealed a calcaneal body fracture .
both images do not clarify if the fracture affected the joint .
figure 2 computed tomography images demonstrate : ( a , b ) axial slices showing the end of the subtalar joint ; ( c - f ) sequential axial slices from proximal to distal showing the fracture of the calcaneal body and not showing articular fracture .
after 4 weeks of immobilization , the child returned with his parents .
pain was not reported by the patient .
although deambulation has not been recommended , parents related that the child walked in the last 2 weeks .
they also reported that they did not observe pain and limping .
the plaster was removed and a radiograph was performed .
the images demonstrated calcaneal fracture consolidation ( fig. 3 ) .
figure 3 lateral and axial image of right calcaneal 4 weeks post - treatment demonstrating the fracture consolidation .
the patient had no complaints of pain , no restrictions in ankle range of motion and a normal walking .
discussion limping in children is a difficult complaint to assess [ 19 ] .
it is considered a challenge to the orthopedic surgeons [ 20 , 21 ] , and surgeons should know the different pathologies that cause limping [ 19 ] .
in all limping children , calcaneal fractures should be suspected even without trauma history [ 5 ] .
the delay in foot fracture diagnosis in children is not unusual [ 3 ] and may be estimated in 27 - 55 % [ 8 , 9 , 22 ] .
therefore the incidence of these fractures may be higher than expected [ 7 , 9 , 23 ] .
for fracture diagnosis , the simple x - ray is considered the choice .
however in limping children with hind - foot pain with a normal x - ray , the additional image exams should be taken .
scintigraphy was used in the recent past [ 5 , 24 ] , but currently the choices are ct [ 3 ] or magnetic resonance [ 14 ] , with ct being the best method [ 18 ] .
in our opinion and as proposed by price et al [ 18 ] , the additional image exams were also important to diagnose non - displaced articular fractures not viewed in the normal x - ray .
fractures of the calcaneous in children younger than 10 years in the vast majority of cases are the result of low - energy injuries [ 17 ] and may be considered as falls of less than 1 m [ 9 ] .
though in some cases the history of trauma may not be documented [ 5 ] .
because of this mechanism of trauma , we believe that fractures have specific patterns , such as extra - articular non - deviated or minimally deviated fractures .
in the older children , the most common mechanism of trauma is falls from greater heights , being reported an average height of 4 m [ 9 ] .
in these cases , the fracture characteristics are extra - articular deviated fractures or intra - articular fractures , similar to those found in adults [ 17 ] .
associated injuries are present in 57 % of all cases .
commotio cerebri syndrome and fractures of the talus , spine and pelvis were reported [ 3 , 6 , 22 ] .
we believe that these injuries are very closely related to a high energy mechanism of trauma .
in this case report despite the high energy trauma none associated injuries or fractures were diagnosed .
the treatment to calcaneal fractures in children is usually conservative [ 15 ] and should be employed in most of the cases , even for severe fractures [ 3 ] .
undoubtedly for all non - displaced or minimally displaced extra - articular calcaneal fractures ( minimally displaced fractures can be considered those with 1 - 2 mm of deviation between the fragments [ 12 ]) , the conservative treatment is the choice [ 12 , 13 , 16 , 23 ] .
several authors have reported good outcomes in these cases [ 9 , 12 , 15 , 23 ] .
a cast immobilization for 4 - 6 weeks was the choice as performed in this case and progressive weight bearing should be employed [ 18 ] .
to articular or extra - articular deviated calcaneal fractures , the non - operative treatment may be an option as advocated by thomas [ 10 ] , who believes that children under the age of 10 years have an excellent remodeling potential .
in these cases , the immature talus grows on the deformed surface of the calcaneous and fits , forming a congruent subtalar joint .
however some authors reported unsatisfactory results with conservative treatment [ 8 , 22 , 25 ] and thus the surgical treatment became the choice [ 17 , 26 - 28 ] resulting in good postoperative outcomes [ 27 , 29 ] .
the surgical treatment options described are : 1 ) open reduction and internal fixation with screws and plate ( small and mini - fragments ) [ 16 , 17 ] ; 2 ) open reduction and fixation with kirschner wires [ 3 ] or screws [ 2 ] ; and 3 ) minimally invasive approach and fixation with k - wires or screws [ 2 ] .
but surgical approach can have its disadvantages .
injury to the periosteum may lead to a malunion and delay in healing , as well as infection and chronic postoperative pain [ 15 ] .
in conclusion , in this case , even though the mechanism of injury was a high energy trauma , the fracture pattern was extra - articular which is quite unusual and conservative treatment was successful employee .
an important message remains : in all limping children calcaneal fracture may be a diagnosis and deserves investigation , even without a history of trauma or a history of trivial trauma .

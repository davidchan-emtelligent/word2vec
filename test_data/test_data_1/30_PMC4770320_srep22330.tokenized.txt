to view a copy of this license , visit http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 / since the discovery of superconductivity in boron - doped diamond with a critical temperature ( tc ) near 4 k , great interest has been attracted in hard superconductors such as transition - metal nitrides and carbides .
here we report the new discovery of superconductivity in polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn synthesized at high pressure and high temperature .
direct magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements demonstrate that the superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn is below ~ 11.6 k , which is significantly higher than that for boron - doped diamond .
the nature of superconductivity in hexagonal epsilon - nbn and the physical mechanism for the relatively lower tc have been addressed by the weaker bonding in the nb - n network , the co - planarity of nb - n layer as well as its relatively weaker electron - phonon coupling , as compared with the cubic delta - nbn counterpart .
moreover , the newly discovered epsilon - nbn superconductor remains stable at pressures up to ~ 20 gpa and is significantly harder than cubic delta - nbn ; it is as hard as sapphire , ultra - incompressible and has a high shear rigidity of 201 gpa to rival hard / superhard material gamma - b (~ 227 gpa ) .
this exploration opens a new class of highly desirable materials combining the outstanding mechanical / elastic properties with superconductivity , which may be particularly attractive for its technological and engineering applications in extreme environments .
hard superconducting materials have attracted considerable interest in materials science , condensed matter physics and solid - state chemistry since the discovery of the superconductivity in superhard boron - doped diamond with a transition temperature of tc ~ 4 k12345 .
for transition - metal nitrides , some of them possess very good superconductivity ( e.g. 10 k for zrn , 8.8 k for hfn , 17.3 k for delta - nbn ) , as well as excellent mechanical properties such as low compressibility , high shear rigidity and high hardness678910111213141516 .
despite the tc for transition - metal nitrides is not very high , their remarkable mechanical properties make them good candidates of hard superconductors for specific electronic / high - field applications17 as well as potential applications in motor system , carbon - nanotube junctions and high - pressure devices18 .
in addition , the chemical inertness and high melting points also make these nitrides suitable for protective and wear - resistant coatings19 .
it is known that rock - salt structured delta - nbn possesses the highest transition temperature among transition - metal nitrides (~ 17 k ) , and has several polymorphs4820212223 such as wc - type nbn , delta - nbn ( nias - type ) and hexagonal epsilon - nbn (# 194 , p63 / mmc ) , but only cubic delta - nbn has been extensively investigated1248 .
recent first - principles theoretical calculations of the thermodynamic properties and structural stability in nbn polymorphs2223 ( e.g. nacl - , nias - and wc - type nbn ) predicted that the hexagonal - structured nbn ( e.g. wc - and nias - type ) exhibited higher hardness and lower total energy than the cubic delta - nbn .
these results indicated that the hexagonal phases were more stable than the cubic counterpart which appeared to be the most energetically unfavorable structure or metastable phase with the rock - salt structure .
for hexagonal epsilon - nbn polymorph , despite its crystal structure was ever simply referred by terao24 and holec et al.25 , the experimental studies on hexagonal epsilon - nbn are very scarce , especially for its superconductivity and mechanical / elastic properties which have never been reported .
recently , the wide and growing interest lies in searching for novel materials with comprehensive superconductivity and excellent mechanical / elastic properties , which makes epsilon - nbn a good candidate of hard superconductors for the possible use in extreme environments .
here , we report the discovery of superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn , and the findings of its ultra - incompressibility , high shear rigidity and hardness .
results synthesis and structural stability of hexagonal epsilon - nbn at high pressure polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn bulk specimens used for the current magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements were synthesized from niobium nitride starting material ( goodfellow , claimed 99 % purity ) at 10 gpa and 1100 ~ 1200 degreesc for 1.5 hour in a high - pressure multi - anvil apparatus at stony brook university .
details of this experimental setup were described elsewhere262728293031 .
as shown in fig. 1a , the synthetic specimen is almost a pure phase of epsilon - nbn with the hexagonal structure ( pdf : # 89 - 4757 ) coexisting with a minor amount of cubic delta - nbn .
the volume fraction of cubic delta - nbn was estimated to be ~ 2 % from the intensity of the delta - nbn peaks observed in synchrotron x - ray diffraction ; and there is not any other phases observed within the resolution of the current x - ray diffraction , such as tetragonal nb4n3 , hexagonal nb2n , and so on. further sem observations revealed that the synthesized specimen was free of visible microcracks with an average grain size of about 1 - 2 mum , and exhibited an equilibrated and homogeneous microstructure , as shown in fig. 1b .
the corresponding composition analyses of the synthetic specimen yielded nb0.98 ( 2 ) n0.96 ( 5 ) o0.06 ( 4 ) as determined by the sem - edx measurements , indicating that the as - synthesized specimen was almost oxygen - free epsilon - nbn or stoichiometric nitride within its uncertainty .
the composite has also been studied by high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) , which shows that the specimen possesses perfect crystalline form ( fig. 1c ) .
the major phase was confirmed to be hexagonal epsilon - nbn .
the up - mid inset to the hrtem image shows the corresponding observed selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) pattern along [ 211 ] axis , which can be indexed to the relevant reported structure ( space group : p63 / mmc , no. 194 ) .
for further confirmation of the structure , the simulated saed pattern projected along [ 211 ] axis is also shown in an up - right inset to fig. 1c .
the enlarged hrtem , as an up - left inset in fig. 1c , shows a clear hexagon formed by nb atoms .
crystal structures of the transition - metal nitrides are generally characterized by strong intermetallic bonding with transition - metal atoms and n atoms occupying octahedral , tetrahedral or trigonal prismatic sites , giving rise to a large cohesive energy .
in the hexagonal epsilon - nbn , each n atom is surrounded by six nb atoms and there are six n atoms around the nb atoms ( fig. 1d ) .
the crystal structure of epsilon - nbn has been further explored by the refinement of high - resolution in situ angle - dispersive x - ray diffraction pattern ( fig. 2a ) , yielding a = 2.9599 ( 4 ) a , c = 11.2497 ( 22 ) a and v0 = 85.352 ( 19 ) a3 ( rwp = 5.65 % , rp = 2.60 % , chi ^ 2 = 0.5977 ) with a space group of p63 / mmc ( no. 194 ) .
the lattice parameters are in good agreement with the previous experimental results ( a = 2.960 a , c = 11.270 a ) reported by terao24 , and comparable to our theoretically calculated results from gga ( a = 2.947 a , c = 11.611 a ) and lda ( a = 2.908 a , c = 11.464 a ) , as well as the previous theoretical study ( a = 2.993 a , c = 11.415 a ) 25 .
according to the well - known born stability criteria32 , the hexagonal epsilon - nbn is found to be mechanically stable , whereas the cubic delta - nbn is mechanically unstable based on our first - principles calculations of the elastic constants .
selected angle - dispersive synchrotron in situ x - ray diffraction patterns of epsilon - nbn upon compression in a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) are shown in fig. 2b .
for comparison , the x - ray diffraction patterns of the specimen during decompression are also shown in fig. 2b .
clearly , no phase transitions are observed throughout this experiment and the hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn remains stable at pressure up to ~ 20.5 gpa .
superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn figure 3a shows normalized magnetization for a bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn as a function of temperature below 20 k under a magnetic field of 3 mt ( or 30 oe ) .
clearly , the magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal obvious diamagnetic responses at temperatures of ~ 11.6 k and ~ 17.5 k , respectively .
the magnetic anomaly occurring at ~ 17.5 k is ascribed to the superconducting transition of nacl - structured cubic delta - nbn , while the magnetic anomaly at ~ 11.6 k is related to the hexagonal epsilon - nbn phase .
the existence of the hysteresis between the two magnetization curves for the zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) modes shows that the hexagonal epsilon - nbn specimen is a typical type - ii superconducting material .
the observed superconducting transition temperatures of tc = 11.6 k and 17.5 k for the hexagonal epsilon - nbn and cubic delta - nbn , have been further addressed / confirmed by the current energy - dispersive x - ray diffraction pattern where the two - phase coexisting specimen is identified ( fig. 1a ) .
as shown in fig. 1a , the as - synthesized bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn is coexisting with a minor amount of cubic delta - nbn .
using the voigt bound for our theoretical calculations , we know that the abundance of delta - nbn of ~ 2 % will result in less than 1 % difference in elastic moduli as compared with those for pure hexagonal epsilon - nbn28 .
this difference is within the experimental uncertainties , indicating that the effect of the minor delta - nbn on the elasticity of the nominal hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn can be negligible .
in contrast , the appearance of the minor delta - nbn (~ 2 %) has a significant effect on its electrical / magnetic properties .
on the basis of the previous studies on the superconducting transition temperature14 ( tc =~ 17.3 k ) of delta - nbn and our xrd measurements , we thus conclude that the observed superconductivity at temperatures around 17.5 k should be attributed to minor phase of cubic delta - nbn , and the relatively low transition at 11.6 k is due to the hexagonal epsilon - nbn major phase .
the nature of superconductivity in bulk hexagonal epsilon - nbn has further confirmed by our direct electrical resistivity measurements , exhibiting two resistive transitions at temperatures of ~ 11.6 k and ~ 17.5 k , respectively ( fig. 3b ) .
these observed resistivity anomalies occur at almost the same temperatures with those obtained by magnetic susceptibility measurements ( fig. 3a ) .
as shown in fig. 3b , the onset transition temperature of epsilon - nbn is about 11.6 k , and zero resistivity is achieved at tc = 10.5 k. by using the 90 / 10 criterion of superconducting transition temperature , we find that the midpoint of the electrical resistivity transition ( i.e. the resistivity drops to 50 % of that at 11.6 k ) is about 11.1 k. the transition width is as small as ~ 1 k , suggesting that the bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn ( nominal ) specimen owns high quality and the homogeneous nature of the crystals .
anisotropic behavior and mechanical / elastic properties of hexagonal epsilon - nbn niobium nitride polymorphs are attractive also due to their excellent mechanical / elastic properties ( elastic behavior ) besides their superconductivity , so understanding their hardness , elastic behavior , especially the young 's modulus ( e ) and shear modulus ( g ) , are of great importance for technological and engineering applications4 .
compressibility measurements upon compression revealed a significant degree of anisotropy in the elastic behavior of hexagonal epsilon - nbn , where epsilon - nbn is more compressible along the a - axis direction , while stiffer along the c - axis .
the least - squares fit of the lattice constants as a function of pressure yields d ( a / a0 )/ dp = - 0.00096 ( 1 ) gpa - 1 and d ( c / c0 )/ dp = - 0.00077 ( 2 ) gpa - 1 , as shown in fig. 4. for comparison , our theoretical first - principles calculations of the pressure - dependent lattice constants are also displayed here , agreeing well with our experimental data , especially for the compressibility of c - axis .
hardness measurements were performed on the synthesized polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn by means of the vickers indentation method using a pyramidal diamond indenter .
the loading force of the hardness tester is adjusted from 2.94 to 9.8 n ( 0.49 , 0.98 , 1.98 , 2.94 , 4.9 and 9.8 n loads ) .
the dwelling time was fixed at 15 s. at each applied load , five indentations were performed .
under a certain applied load of p , the hardness ( hv ) was determined by hv = 1854.4p / d2 , where d is the arithmetic mean of the two diagonals of the indent in micrometers3334 .
the average hv values were 29.7 +/ - 1.0 , 26.0 +/ - 1.3 , 24.0 +/ - 0.7 , 21.9 +/ - 1.0 and 21.5 +/ - 0.6 gpa under a load of 0.49 , 0.98 , 1.98 , 2.94 , 4.9 and 9.8 n , respectively .
the results show that the hardness appears to increase with a decrease under various loading forces .
the average measured vickers hardness hv for polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn under different loads are shown in fig. 5a .
clearly , the hexagonal epsilon - nbn exhibits a vickers hardness of 22 ~ 30 gpa , which is significantly harder than the high - pressure synthesized polycrystalline reb2 ( 17 ~ 19 gpa ) as reported by qin et al.34 and is almost as hard as sapphire al2o34 .
figure 5b shows a summary of the vickers hardness of epsilon - nbn as a function of applied load , compared with the previous study on rock - salt structured cubic nbn , hfn and zrn , showing that the hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn is consistently harder than cubic nbn ( 17 ~ 20 gpa ) , hfn ( 15.5 ~ 19.1 gpa ) and zrn ( 11.8 ~ 16.9 gpa ) under various loading forces ranging from 0 to 9.8 n , respectively4 .
it is widely accepted that bulk and / or shear moduli can reflect the hardness in an indirect way2735 .
to further explore the correlations between the elastic modulus ( b , g , e ) and other physical properties , we have performed in situ ultrasonic measurements on hexagonal epsilon - nbn at high pressure .
the experimental procedure in details can be seen elsewhere262728293031 .
the high - pressure elasticity and sound velocities of hexagonal epsilon - nbn are out of the current scope of this paper and will be published elsewhere28 .
the ambient - condition bulk and shear moduli derived from the acoustic measurements on epsilon - nbn yielded bs0 = 373 ( 2 ) gpa and g0 = 201 ( 1 ) gpa28 .
clearly , hexagonal epsilon - nbn exhibits a remarkable incompressibility , which is as incompressible / stiff as superhard material cbn (~ 381 gpa ) 36 .
the shear rigidity of epsilon - nbn (~ 201 ( 1 ) gpa ) rivals that for superhard gamma - b (~ 227 gpa ) 37 , which is well consistent with the theoretical shear modulus / rigidity of g0 = 199 gpa by our first - principles calculations .
according to our experimentally obtained bulk ( bs ) and shear ( g ) moduli , the young 's modulus ( e ) is derived to be 510 ( 1 ) gpa by applying the equation e = 9bsg /( 3bs + g ) , which surpasses that of superhard b6o - b4c composite ( 501 gpa ) 38 , and can be comparable to that of polycrystalline cbn ( 587 gpa ) 39 , indicating that the hexagonal epsilon - nbn will also be a good candidate for mechanical applications .
discussion mechanism of superconductivity in hexagonal epsilon - nbn it is well known that the rock - salt structured transition - metal nitrides ( e.g. zrn , nbn , hfn ) and the rhombohedral beta - zrncl (~ 13 k ) and beta - hfncl (~ 26 k ) compounds show good superconductivity8154041 .
the structures of cubic delta - nbn , hexagonal epsilon - nbn and rhombohedral beta - zrncl along a axis are shown in fig. 6. in the hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn , each n atom is surrounded by six nb atoms and there are six n atoms around the nb atoms ( fig. 6b ) .
the rhombohedral beta - zrncl can be considered to be composed of alternate stacking of honeycomb zrn bilayers sliced from a zrn crystal of the hexagonal structure and sandwiched by chloride layers , as shown in fig. 6b,c. therefore , the nb - n layer in hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn , as shown in fig. 6b , is considered a critical component to stabilizing its superconductivity .
to gain insight into the mechanism of superconductivity in hexagonal epsilon - nbn against those for the rock - salt structured nitrides as well as rhombohedral beta - zrncl , their crystal structures ( fig. 6 ) and their structural parameters have been further investigated .
the lattice constants , average bond length , bond angle and superconducting transition temperatures ( tc ) of niobium nitrides derived from our first - principles calculations and magnetic / electrical measurements are summarized in table 1 , in comparison with those of cubic zrn and beta - zrncl superconductors4041 .
our theoretical calculations show that the average bond length of nb - n for hexagonal epsilon - nbn ( 2.2219 a ) is longer than those of the nacl - structured nbn ( 2.2077 a ) and rhombohedral beta - zrncl ( 2.2127 a ) , but shorter than that of cubic zrn ( 2.2890 a ) .
as shown in fig. 6 , the average bond angle ( n - nb - n ) for the distorted nbn6 ( trigonal prismatic coordination ) of epsilon - nbn is ~ 82.25degrees , and the layered hexagonal - structured epsilon - nbn is almost coplanar against the nacl - structured nbn / zrn with the bond angle of 90degrees .
therefore , the weaker bonding in the nb - n network and the co - planarity may be the reason for the relatively lower tc (~ 11.6 k ) compared with the cubic delta - nbn counterpart (~ 17.5 k ) .
this correlation is further supported by the rock - salt structured zrn and rhombohedral beta - zrncl superconductors ( table 1 ) , where a stronger bonding of zr - n in beta - zrncl ( 2.2127 a ) results in a higher tc (~ 13.0 k ) , in comparison with the nacl - structured zrn ( 2.2890 a , 10.7 k ) .
on the other hand , the shorter average bond length of n - n ( 2.9728 a ) for epsilon - nbn together with the lower total energy , compared with delta - nbn ( n - n : 3.2122 a ) , indicated that the hexagonal epsilon - nbn is more stable than the cubic counterpart .
for phonon - mediated superconductivity , tc is given by mcmillan 's formula , where thetad is the debye temperature , mu * is the coulomb pseudopotential or electron - electron interaction constant and lambda is the electron - phonon coupling42 .
based on the obtained elastic bulk and shear moduli together with the ambient - condition density rho = 8.30 ( 2 ) g / cm3 of hexagonal epsilon - nbn as derived from our ultrasonic measurements28 , the debye temperature thetadis determined to be ~ 738 k from the equation28 described as , which is significantly larger than the theoretical result of thetad = 629 k for cubic delta - nbn43 , and is double the previously experimental value of ~ 363 k ( ref. 11 ) .
using the obtained values of thetad = 738 k , tc = 11.6 k , and a well - accepted coulomb parameter mu * = 0.1 ~ 0.13 for transition - metal nitrides3 , we estimate the electron - phonon coupling constant lambda = 0.57 ~ 0.63 .
this yielded electron - phonon coupling lambda = 0.57 ~ 0.63 for epsilon - nbn is significantly weaker than those ( lambda = 0.87 and 0.906 ) for cubic delta - nbn counterpart 89 .
it is clearly seen from the mcmillan 's formula42 that the effects of lambda ( as the exponential term ) on the tc is much more significant than thetad ( as the linear term ) , which can shed light on the relatively smaller tc = 11.6 k , compared with tc = 17 k for delta - nbn44 .
the relatively small value of lambda for epsilon - nbn can be understood qualitatively from the relation of , where n ( 0 ) is the density of electronic states at the fermi energy , < i2 > is the average square of the electron - phonon matrix element , m is the ionic mass and < omega2 > is a characteristic phonon frequency averaged over the phonon spectrum having ( ref. 42 ) .
although the ionic mass of epsilon - nbn is similar to that of delta - nbn , its stronger covalent bonds in epsilon - nbn imply a smaller n ( 0 ) and larger < omega2 > , compared to those for delta - nbn .
these results have been further confirmed by experimentally measured thetad = 738 k for epsilon - nbn , which is larger than the thetad = 629 k for delta - nbn43 .
first - principles calculations show that the superconducting and mechanical properties for transition - metal nitrides / carbonitrides are closely related to their electronic properties4546 .
for a good understanding of the mechanical / superconducting properties of epsilon - nbn , electronic properties of the total densities of states ( tdos ) and partial densities of states ( pdos ) for hexagonal epsilon - nbn at ambient pressure have been calculated , in comparison with those for cubic delta - nbn counterpart ( see supplementary materials : fig. s1 ) .
both hexagonal epsilon - nbn and cubic delta - nbn show similar metallic bonding features with a finite dos at the fermi level ( ef ) , originating mostly from the 4d electrons of nb and 2p electrons of n and agree well with our electrical measurements that epsilon - nbn is a metallic electrical conductor at ambient conditions .
clearly , there is a strong hybridization between nb 4d and n 2p states in epsilon - nbn as revealed by the appearance of " pseudogap " just below and / or above the fermi level , indicating the covalent and / or ionic bonding between nb and n atoms ( fig. s1 ( a )) .
when comparing with the electronic structures of hexagonal epsilon - nbn and cubic delta - nbn , we note that there is a small peak dominated by the nb - d orbital at about - 0.68 ev in the dos for epsilon - nbn ( fig. s1 ( a,b )) .
the appearance of this peak with low energy indicates a stronger bonding arising from the metal d orbitals in epsilon - nbn as compared to delta - nbn , resulting in an enhancement of the elastic / mechanical strength of epsilon - nbn. fig. s1 ( a ) shows that the tdos around the fermi level ( ef ) lies in a dip for epsilon - nbn , whereas the density of states increases monotonically at ef for delta - nbn ( fig. s1 ( b )) .
this agrees well with the result from the total - energy calculations that the hexagonal epsilon - nbn is more stable than the cubic counterpart .
as reported by oya et al.47 , tetragonal phases gamma - nb4n3 and nb4n5 with long - range - ordered arrangement of vacancies exhibited superconductivity47 , whereas the hexagonal nbn and nb5n6 did n't show superconductivity at temperatures down to 1.77 k. for the mechanism of superconductivity in transition - metal nitrides , it is suggested that the continuous promotion of s , p electrons to the d shell in all solids under pressure is one of the factors which will induce superconductivity .
as seen from fig. s1 , the contribution of the 4d - state is larger than those of the 5s and 5p states .
the larger contribution of 4d state electrons clearly shows the possibility of superconductivity in hexagonal - structured nbn at ambient pressure .
in summary , we have discovered the superconductivity at ~ 11.6 k in bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon - nbn , which was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature in a high - pressure multi - anvil apparatus .
the weaker bonding in the nb - n network and the co - planarity may be the reason for the relatively lower tc (~ 11.6 k ) compared with the cubic delta - nbn counterpart (~ 17.5 k ) .
our theoretical calculations reveal that the contribution of the 4d - state is larger than those of the 5s and 5p states , and the relatively larger contribution of 4d state electrons may be responsible for the superconductivity in hexagonal epsilon - nbn .
in addition , the hexagonal epsilon - nbn was found to exhibit excellent mechanical properties , which is as hard as sapphire al2o3 ( 21 ~ 23 gpa ) 4 and possessed a remarkable incompressibility36 ( as stiff as superhard cbn of ~ 381 gpa ) .
the shear rigidity of epsilon - nbn (~ 201 ( 1 ) gpa ) rivals that for superhard gamma - b (~ 227 gpa ) 37 , and the young 's modulus (~ 510 ( 1 ) gpa ) is surpassing that for b6o - b4c composite ( 501 gpa ) 38 .
our theoretical calculations indicate that the hexagonal epsilon - nbn is more stable than the cubic delta - nbn , and the stronger bonding arising from the metal d orbitals in epsilon - nbn compared to delta - nbn results in an enhancement of the elastic / mechanical strength of epsilon - nbn .
this study opens a new window for the design of desirable materials with the combination of excellent mechanical properties and superconductivity , which may be particularly attractive for its technological and engineering applications in extreme conditions .

for the brillouin - zone sampling , the monkhorst - pack scheme was adopted53 .
to confirm the convergence of our calculations , we have carefully analyzed the dependences of the total energy on the cutoff energy and the k - point set mesh according to the monkhorst - pack grid .

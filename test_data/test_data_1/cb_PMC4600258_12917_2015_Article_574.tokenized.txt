background retropharyngeal hematoma is a rare condition that is difficult to diagnose and may progress rapidly to airway obstruction .
the authors report the first known case of acute upper airway obstruction resulting from retropharyngeal hematoma in a dog .
documented causes in human medicine have included coagulopathic states , trauma , infection , parathyroid adenoma rupture , and foreign body ingestion .
vague symptoms in humans such as sore throat , shortness of breath , dysphonia , dysphagia , and neck swelling may precede lethal airway obstruction .
case presentation the authors report a case of an 18 - month - old , intact female water spaniel with thrombocytopenia that developed a massive retropharyngeal hematoma and symptoms of airway compromise .
the dog required tracheal intubation followed by surgical tracheostomy .
lateral cervical radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was consistent with a retropharyngeal hematoma compromising the airway .
the retropharyngeal hematoma was managed conservatively .
conclusion retropharyngeal hematoma should be considered in patients presenting with abrupt respiratory distress .
magnetic resonance imaging allowed specific diagnosis of a rare condition that is otherwise difficult to diagnose .
keywords canine bleeding disorders acute airway obstruction retropharyngeal hematoma issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background retropharyngeal hematoma ( rh ) is a rare condition that can rapidly cause airway obstruction in people [ 1 , 2 ] .
the condition develops when blood collects in the retropharyngeal space , which extends from the base of the skull cranially to the level of the tracheal bifurcation caudally and therefore , provides a route for communication between the neck and the chest [ 3 ] .
the retropharyngeal space itself contains lymph nodes , fat , and lymphatic channels , but no great vessels or organs [ 4 ] .
the clinical presentations of rh differ depending on the size of the rh and its rate of growth .
rh is characterized by the clinical triad of tracheal and esophageal compression , ventral tracheal displacement , and the subsequent appearance of subcutaneous bruising in the anterior neck and upper thorax [ 5 ] .
sore throat , shortness of breath , dysphagia and odynophagia , either alone or in various combinations , may be the initial symptoms .
bruising , tenderness and / or swelling of the neck can sometimes make the diagnosis more obvious [ 6 ] .
an expanding hematoma in this area may affect the airway at different levels as a result of mass effect .
because of anatomical barriers , the bulk of the hematoma could compress the nasopharynx , oropharynx , hypopharynx , or esophagus ; therefore , the obstruction could be at the level of the upper airway , cervical trachea , or intrathoracic trachea .
this knowledge is significant , as a standard tracheostomy may not resolve the airway obstruction .
multiple etiological factors could contribute to rh formation and , if no cause is identified , the condition is characterized as a spontaneous rh. etiologies of rh include infection , cervical spine trauma , great vessel trauma , violent head movements , iatrogenic injury associated with cardiac catheterization or cerebral angiography , parathyroid adenoma hemorrhage , or foreign body ingestion [ 1 ] .
anticoagulation states [ 7 - 12 ] or hemorrhagic diathesis predispose to the development of rh in humans [ 1 ] .
precipitating factors such as episodes of coughing , sneezing , straining and vomiting indirectly contribute to rh by increasing venous pressure and causing ruptures in the venous system .
rh must be differentiated from abscess , arterial aneurysm , malformation or prominence of the vertebral bodies , and adenoiditis [ 13 ] .
in human medicine , patients with rh secondary to coagulopathy ( e.g. , hemophilia , hemorrhagic diathesis , or anticoagulant therapy ) present with fewer symptoms and , once the diagnosis is made , intubation or tracheotomy is more difficult [ 1 ] .
in some patients , 12 - 48 h of bleeding may precede complaints of respiratory embarrassment ; however , an early , seemingly indolent course can suddenly be complicated by airway obstruction .
death can occur following rapid development of respiratory distress from sublingual , retropharyngeal , and parapharyngeal hemorrhages [ 1 ] .
in the case of rh in patients on therapeutic anti - coagulant therapy , 33 % of patients experienced precipitous airway compromise leading to surgical airway management , and the mortality rate was 10 % [ 12 ] .
however , in spontaneous rh , there is a reported mortality rate of up to 20 % [ 14 ] .
in human patients hospitalized for cervical injury , 60 % of rh cases result from the injury but airway obstruction caused directly by the rh occurs rarely , in only 1.2 % of patients [ 15 , 16 ] .
because a patient 's history can be nonspecific , a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose rh. to aid the diagnosis , lateral cervical radiography can be used to measure abnormal thickness of the retropharyngeal tissue .
in veterinary medicine , as a rough estimate , the normal distance between the dorsal edge of the cricoid cartilage and the ventral aspect of c2 is approximately equal to the length of c3 on a properly positioned lateral radiograph [ 17 ] .
the authors discuss the first known case of retropharyngeal hematoma in a dog that tested positive for anaplasma species .
case presentation an 18 - month - old , intact female water spaniel ( 16 kg ) was referred to the veterinary teaching hospital , university of extremadura , after experiencing weakness , neck pain and progressive paralysis in all limbs that led to lateral recumbency for 7 days .
there were no other remarkable findings on physical examination .
complete blood count and serum biochemistry profiles revealed leukocytosis ( white blood cell count : 31.5 x 109 / l ; reference range , 5.9 - 16 .
6 x 109 / l ) ; elevated alanine aminotransferase ( 377 iu / l ; reference range , 15 - 52 iu / l ) and alkaline phosphatase ( 317 iu / l ; reference range , 20 - 70 iu / l ) ; and thrombocytopenia ( 109 x 109 / l ; reference range , 117 - 460 x 109 / l ) .
no coagulation testing was performed .
based on the history and examination findings , possible differential diagnoses included meningitis , polyradiculoneuritis , polymyositis , and discospondylitis .
we anesthetized the dog for a cisternal puncture and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) tap and encountered no complications during the procedure .
analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated protein ( 15 g / l ; reference range , < 0.25 g / l ) and neutrophilic pleocytosis ( white blood cell count , 5.0 x 109 / l ; reference range < 5 x 106 / l ; 69 % neutrophils , 39 % lymphocytes ) .
based on these results , and pending csf culture , there was a suspicion of bacterial meningitis and the dog was started on antibiotic therapy ( sulfamethoxazole - trimethoprim,1 15 mg / kg po q 12 h and clindamycin,2 10 mg / kg po q 12 h ) .
five hours after extubation , the dog developed stridor and evidence of upper airway obstruction that worsened rapidly .
the dog was agitated , tachypneic and cyanotic on room air and was immediately transferred to the operating room to secure the airway .
intubation was attempted via direct visualization with laryngoscopy , but this was difficult because of the size of the hematoma .
the epiglottis was not visualized and the correct position of the endotracheal tube was confirmed using capnography .
on examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx , there was an ecchymotic swelling of the soft palate .
laryngoscopy confirmed extensive hematoma ; pharyngoscopy demonstrated a soft , bulging , violaceous mass involving the lateral and dorsal pharyngeal walls ( fig. 1 ) .
a lateral cervical radiograph revealed marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling ( fig. 2 ) .
the dog was then transferred to the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) unit under general anesthesia , and urgent mri3 of the neck was performed ( fig. 3 ) .
mri revealed a retropharyngeal mass with features consistent with hemorrhage ; the trachea was outlined only by the endotracheal tube and the mass was causing dorsal compression of the airway. fig. 1 pharyngoscopy image demonstrating a soft , bulging , violaceous mass involving lateral and dorsal pharyngeal walls fig. 2 lateral cervical spine radiographs showing normal ( a ) and increased thickness of the prevertebral soft tissue ( b , c ) .
a before anesthesia ; b during the event ; c four days after tracheostomy fig. 3 sagittal t1 magnetic resonance image showing a high signal prevertebral collection spreading from the nasopharynx to c4 the severe extent of the upper airway obstruction necessitated surgical tracheostomy , which was performed uneventfully , and aminocaproic acid4 ( 20 mg / kg iv ) , vitamin k5 ( 2 mg / kg iv ) , and ethamsylate6 ( 12.5 mg / kg iv ) were administered .
once the dog was stabilized , blood tests were repeated .
hemoglobin was 109 g / l from 123 g / l , platelet count was 36 x 109 / l from 109 x 109 / l , and clotting study results were in the normal range ( thrombin time : 6.4 s , reference range : 6 - 9 s ; partial thromboplastin time : 5.1 s , reference range : 5.1 - 7.9 s ; prothrombin time : 8.7 s , reference range : 8.6 - 12.9 s ) .
despite thrombocytopenia that was just above the range to cause bleeding , buccal mucosal bleeding time was normal ( 2 min ; reference range , 1.7 - 4.4 min ) ; platelet aggregometry was not performed to assess platelet function .
anaplasma and ehrlichia blood antigen detection ( 4dx7 ) was performed , and the dog tested positive for anaplasma spp. ; therefore , prednisone8 ( 2 mg / kg iv q 12 h ) and doxycycline9 ( 10 mg / kg po q 24 h ) were initiated as treatment for rickettsial meningitis .
over the next 24 h , the platelet count increased to 153 x 109 / l and the hemoglobin concentration stabilized at 109 g / l. the tracheostomy tube was removed on the fourth day and normalization of the prevertebral soft tissue was noted on a lateral cervical spine radiograph ( fig. 2 ) .
based on the clinical and radiological findings , a diagnosis of rh was made .
following negative csf culture , antibiotic therapy was reduced to doxycycline for one month .
rehabilitation therapy was instituted and in 7 days the dog was able to rise and take a few steps alone .
the neurological signs improved with treatment and resolved over the next several months resulting in complete and uneventful recovery .
in this case , a flexible laryngoscope confirmed the diagnosis .
the role of flexible pharyngoscopy cannot be overemphasized .
even a small bulging of the posterior wall of the pharynx should alert clinicians and guide the clinical strategy towards a high suspicion of a retropharyngeal space - occupying lesion [ 18 ] .
computed tomography is also important to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the hematoma and its relation to structures in the neck [ 6 ] .
mri offers several advantages over computed tomography regarding multiplanar anatomic display and superior soft tissue contrast , allowing more specific diagnoses to be made [ 19 ] .
mri not only better depicts the extent of retropharyngeal lesions but , most importantly , is able to identify acute and subacute blood products , thereby affecting both diagnosis and management .
mri is sensitive to blood products in different stages of evolution because of their paramagnetic signal properties , which change over time depending on the dominant component ( e.g. , acute deoxyhemoglobin , subacute intra - or extracellular methemoglobin , and chronic hemicromes ) .
spontaneous bleeding generally does not occur until platelet counts fall below 20 - 50 x 109 / l unless a concomitant bleeding disorder exists , in which case it can be a life - threatening event .
thrombocytopenia does not always require intervention , but it certainly warrants monitoring and attention to prevent bleeding episodes [ 20 ] .
in this case , the dog responded well to treatment with doxycycline and platelet transfusion was not necessary .
in human medicine , most authors report conservative treatment for successful management of rh , and the condition usually resolves within several weeks [ 6 ] .
treatment depends on the size , location , and clinical evolution of the patient .
in small hematomas , treatment tends to be conservative , and spontaneous resolution occurs [ 21 ] .
immediate opening of the hematoma for aspiration appears to increase the risk of infection , which often extends to the mediastinum .
if the hematoma is large and re - absorption unlikely , or if the hematoma has extended rapidly , surgical evacuation and controlling the source of bleeding is indicated once the patient has been stabilized [ 13 ] .
late complications include a non - resolving hematoma or abscess formation .
there is little consensus in the literature regarding the use of steroids or prophylactic antibiotics in patients with rh [ 2 ] and the use of systemic steroids is controversial .
hemorrhage in the upper airway dissects along multiple fascial planes , and this incites an inflammatory reaction that is limited by the use of steroids .
although not of proven benefit , systemic steroids have been used in numerous case reports of upper airway hematomas in people [ 22 , 23 ] .
conclusions the authors report the first known veterinary case of an rh in a dog .
rh should be considered a rare differential for dogs with underlying coagulopathy that develop upper airway compromise .

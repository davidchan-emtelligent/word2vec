introduction slipped capital femoral epiphysis is the most common hip disorder affecting the adolescent population , usually individuals between 8 and 15 years old .
however , there are few case reports of older patients in the literature to date .
it is believed that the etiology is multifactorial and may include obesity , trauma and , less frequently , endocrine pathologies comprising hypothyroidism , hypogonadism and panhypopituitarism .
case presentation we present the case of a 28 - year - old latino woman diagnosed with hypothyroidism secondary to arachnoidocele associated with skeletal immaturity and slipped capital femoral epiphysis .
conclusions it is important to conduct clinical and radiographic studies in these patients to rule out endocrine pathologies , especially hypothyroidism in those of sexual maturity .

keywords adult capital epiphysis female femoral hypothyroidism slipped issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction slipped capital femoral epiphysis ( scfe ) is the most common hip disorder affecting the adolescent population , usually between 8 and 15 years old [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , there are few case reports in the literature describing this condition in older patients .
it is believed that the etiology is multifactorial and may include obesity , trauma and , less frequently , endocrine pathologies comprising hypothyroidism , hypogonadism and panhypopituitarism [ 3 ] .
in this report , we present a case of a 28 - year - old woman with secondary hypothyroidism , as well as a literature review .
case presentation a 28 - year - old latino woman fell from her own height 4 weeks prior to presentation at our hospital .
the fall had caused a direct contusion in her right hip that led to severe pain and functional disability .
she had initially been evaluated at the general hospital in her hometown , where she received conservative treatment that included analgesics and rest .
she had partial improvement ; nevertheless , when she began returning to normal activities , she did not tolerate the pain and attended our unit for care.at admission , she had a medical history of gesta 1 , para 1 , with no other pathologies referred .
the physical examination at presentation revealed short stature , proper development of sexual characteristics ( tanner 4 ) , right pelvic limb with an attitude of flexion to 30degrees and external rotation , inability to bear weight , range of motion of the right hip flexion to 40degrees , extension to 10degrees , abduction to 20degrees , adduction to 10degrees , external rotation to 40degrees , internal rotation to 0degrees , muscle strength 5 / 5 and unaltered sensitivity and reflexes .
x - rays showed a moderate scfe ( southwick scale ) with a 52degrees angle , as well as the presence of an opening of the left femoral head physis and risser grade iv calcification ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 pre - operative radiograph showing moderate - grade slipped capital femoral epiphysis and risser grade iv calcification .
diagnosis on the basis of our observations during the patient 's physical examination , we made a diagnosis of moderate unstable scfe on the right side and delay in physeal closure ( without etiology at the time ). closed reduction and internal fixation with two cannulated 4.0 screws at a 6degrees southwick angle were performed ( figure 2 ) .
bone series were performed , which showed open physis in the proximal humerus and distal radius ( figure 3 ) .

figure 3 anteroposterior radiographs of both shoulders and the right wrist , where the presence of open physis can be observed .
hormone profile the following hormone profile data were recorded at admission : free triiodothyronine ( t3 ) , 1.19pg / ml ( normal , 1.71pg / ml to 3.71pg / ml ) ; t3 , 0.25ng / ml ( normal , 0.58ng / ml to 1.59ng / ml ) ; thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) , 180.49iu / ml ( normal , 0.35iu / ml to 4.94iu / ml ) ; thyroxine ( t4 ) , < 1.0mug / dl ( normal , 4.87mug / dl to 11.72mug / dl ) ; free t4 < 0.40ng / dl ( normal , 0.70 ng / dl to 1.48ng / dl ) ; parathyroid hormone , 32.9pg / ml ( normal , 15pg / ml to 68.3pg / ml ) ; prolactin , 157mug ; and cortisol , 14.5mug.computed tomography ( ct ) of the sella with contrast enhancement was performed to determine the etiology of hormonal changes , which revealed pituitary hypoplasia secondary to arachnoidocele compression ( figure 4 ) .
the ct findings confirmed the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism , and treatment with levothyroxine 50mug / day was initiated.rehabilitation was initiated immediately after surgery , and weight - bearing was deferred for 3 months .
the patient 's hip mobility gradually improved .
at 4 months after surgery , she achieved free and independent functioning , right hip flexion to 115degrees , extension to 30degrees , adduction to 25degrees , abduction to 50degrees , internal rotation to 30degrees and external rotation to 20degrees ( figure 5 ). the patient presented adequate thyroid hormone levels in control studies .
follow - up radiographs taken at 12 months of treatment showed appropriate reduction and persistence of open physis with risser grade iv , yet reduction was seen in comparison to the initial x - rays ( figure 6 ) .

arachnoidocele compression of the pituitary gland in 70 % is shown .

on this image obtained 12 months after treatment , appropriate situation of osteosynthetic material can be seen , in addition to reduced physis .
discussion scfe is the most common hip disorder affecting the adolescent population , usually when they are between 8 and 15 years old [ 1 , 2 ] .
the prevalence of scfe is 10.8 per 100,000 children [ 4 ] .
scfe is known to affect boys more often than girls .
also , it occurs more frequently in african americans and pacific islanders , possibly due to increased body weight in these two subpopulations [ 5 ] .
the etiology of scfe is still unclear , and the role of endocrine disruption remains controversial .
the authors of some reports have indicated that a deficiency of sex hormones in relation to growth hormones can result in instability of the growth plate [ 6 - 8 ] .
loder et al. examined 85 patients with endocrine and scfe disorders and found that 40 % had hypothyroidism , 25 % had growth hormone deficiency and 35 % had other conditions , such as panhypopituitarism and hyperparathyroidism [ 9 ] .
this is why , in the clinical examination of our patient , we did a hormone profile to identify a possible etiology .
thyroid and growth hormones are the most commonly affected hormones .
both are necessary for growth and maturation of the cartilage , with subsequent calcification and replacement by mineralized osteoid .
collectively , this process causes degeneration and proliferation of chondrocytes in the growth plate and subsequent calcification and ossification of the matrix .
in patients with hypothyroidism , there is an increase in chondrocyte degradation and mineralization of the matrix is improved ; however , ossification of the mineralized matrix is inhibited [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .
thyroid hormone deficiency can play a significant role in reducing the stability of the growth plate and then contribute to the pathogenesis of the proximal femoral glide [ 12 , 13 ] .
in examining patients with thyroid hormone disorders , it is important to distinguish primary from secondary hypothyroidism .
the most useful approach is to determine tsh levels , because elevation is the most sensitive indicator of primary hypothyroidism [ 13 ] , as evidenced by our case .
our patient had low tsh and high t3 levels , indicating secondary hypothyroidism , which was confirmed by ct scans showing arachnoidocele with compression of the pituitary gland .
therefore , hypothyroidism must be a diagnosis of exclusion and should be considered in patients who are of relatively low height for their age .
furthermore , hypogonadism must be taken into account in those patients who lack appropriate sexual maturity for their age [ 3 ] .
our patient was of short stature and had proper development of sexual characteristics ( tanner 4 ) .
other associated symptoms may be poorly developed skeletal muscle , which may be associated with radiographic epiphyseal closure of long bones [ 3 ] as evidenced by the bone series in our patient , and open physis at the proximal humerus , proximal femur and distal radius .
initial laboratory studies should include follicle - stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , testosterone , prolactin and estradiol , and they must include thyroid function tests [ 9 ] .
patients with unilateral scfe should be carefully monitored to detect changes in an asymptomatic or unaffected hip to avoid delays in diagnosis [ 2 ] .
we have followed our patient for 12 months , during which time no slip in the contralateral proximal femoral physis has been observed .
conclusions there are very few case reports in the worldwide literature of adult patients who presented with scfe .
it should be emphasized that all of the published cases were associated with different endocrine disorders , either pituitary diseases ( generally tumoral ) or , more rarely , hypothyroidism , and all were of primary origin .
to our knowledge , there has been no case report published to date describing a diagnosis of hypothyroidism secondary to arachnoidocele compression .

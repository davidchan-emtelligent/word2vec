micrornas ( mirnas ) are an abundant class of small non - coding rna molecules (~ 22 nt ) that can repress gene expression .
deregulation of certain mirnas is widely recognized as a robust biomarker for many neoplasms , as well as an important player in tumorigenesis and the establishment of tumoral microenvironments .
the downregulation of specific mirnas in tumors has been exploited as a mechanism to provide selectivity to oncolytic viruses or gene - based therapies .
mirna response elements recognizing mirnas expressed in specific tissues , but downregulated in tumors , have been inserted into the 3'utr of viral genes to promote the degradation of these viral mrnas in healthy tissue , but not in tumor cells .
consequently , oncolytic virotherapy - associated toxicities were diminished , while therapeutic activity in tumor cells was preserved .
however , viral infections themselves can modulate the mirnome of the host cell , and such mirna changes under infection impact the normal viral lifecycle .
thus , there is a mirna - mediated interplay between virus and host cell , affecting both viral and cellular activities .
moreover , the outcome of such interactions may be cell type or condition specific , suggesting that the impact on normal and tumoral cells may differ .
here , we provide an insight into the latest developments in mirna - based viral engineering for cancer therapy , following the most recent discoveries in mirna biology .
furthermore , we report on the relevance of mirnas in virus - host cell interaction , and how such knowledge can be exploited to improve the control of viral activity in tumor cells .
oncolytic viruses microrna gene regulation detargeting host - virus interaction introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) are small non - coding rna molecules (~ 22 nt ) that can negatively regulate the expression of large networks of genes ( 1 ) .
not surprisingly , mirna dysregulation impacts virtually all cancer - related processes ( proliferation , cell death , migration , and cell cycle , among many others ) .
such dysregulation provides clear hallmark mirna signatures that can distinguish between normal cells and the tumor cells of many different types of malignancy ( 1 ) .
in this regard , therapeutic strategies rely either on the reintroduction of the individual mirnas involved in tumor suppression functions , such as mir - 34 ( 2 ) , or on reducing oncogenic mirnas with antisense oligonucleotides - - " antagomirs " ( 3 ) .
interestingly , brown and coworkers exploited the differences in mirna expression between tissues and proposed a novel mechanism to control transgene expression , based on the differential expression of mir - 142 among lineages of hematopoietic cells ( 4 ) .
selectivity was achieved by the introduction of engineered target sites , or mirna response elements ( mres ) .
later , oncolytic virotherapy also incorporated mres to control the expression of viral or suicide genes .
mres can attenuate oncolytic viruses in non - tumoral tissue and therefore avoid the undesired toxicity associated with viral tropism when administered systemically or locoregionally ( 5 - 8 ) .
posttranscriptional targeting with mres could be complemented with transcriptional or transductional targeting to enhance the selectivity of oncolytic viruses .
the study of viral mirnas and host responses has also shown the relevance of mirnas in the regulation of viral replication .
there are , in fact , several examples of how viral infection modulates cellular mirnome , with consequences on both viral activity and host cell functionality .
this review discusses the latest developments with respect to fine - tuning oncolytic viruses , based on the viral engineering of mres , and looks at the functional consequences of the interplay between mirnas and viruses .
the mechanism of action of mirnas most mirnas are transcribed from mirna genes and follow a canonical mirna biogenesis pathway .
mirnas are transcribed to primary mirna transcripts ( pri - mirnas ) that are processed by the rnase iii enzyme drosha in the nucleus to generate precursor mirna that are exported by exportin - 5 to the cytoplasm .
there they are recognized and cleaved by another rnase iii enzyme , dicer , to give rise to ~ 22 nt mirna duplexes .
they are then loaded onto the risc complex , where the ago proteins will help with the unwinding of the mirna duplexes to form a functional mirna - induced silencing complex that will recognize target mrnas and interfere with their expression .
target mrna recognition will be based on partial complementarity of mirna sequences and the 3'utr of the mrnas ( 9 ) .
mirnas modulate gene expression through mechanisms of translational inhibition , mostly at the initiation step , and mrna destabilization as a consequence of mrna deadenylation and mrna decay .
these mechanisms may occur sequentially , with mrna destabilization as the dominant effect .
in consequence , the repression of mirnas target genes can be evidenced by depletion of the mrna content ( 10 , 11 ) .
controlling viral replication through mres the selectivity of oncolytic viruses can be determined through the introduction of mres , preferentially in the 3'utr of viral genes ( 12 ) .
noticeably , mres can be inserted into virtually any viral mrna .
comparable efficiencies have been observed with mres targeting early phase transcription factors or late phase capsid structural proteins .
examples of the elements targeted are icp4 , icp27 , and glycoprotein h in herpes simplex virus ( 13 - 15 ) , e1a and l5 ( fiber ) in adenovirus ( 15 , 16 ) , or m and l in vesicular stomatitis virus ( 17 , 18 ) .
interestingly , targeting early phase proteins reduces toxicity derived from its own expression and that of downstream genes , offering a greater safety margin than when targeting late phase proteins ( 16 ) .
however , the use of mres to target both genomic and messenger rna in rna viruses showed efficient repression of mrnas only .
the efficacy of mirna repression in genomic rnas is reduced due to secondary structures and scaffold proteins that protect the viral genome ( 5 , 19 , 20 ) .
the base pairing of the mirna and target genes usually displays partial complementarity , restricted to nucleotides 2 - 7 of the mirna , and known as the " seed " sequence ( 21 , 22 ) .
however , partial complementarity can only mediate translational repression and mrna decay ( 10 , 23 - 25 ) .
to achieve a fast and robust effect on the control of viral replication , mres must be designed to trigger direct cleavage in the viral mrna .
although all human argonaute proteins ( ago1 - 4 ) are capable of promoting a translational repression pathway , only ago2 has endonucleolytic activity ( 26 , 27 ) .
in order to trigger ago2 - mediated direct cleavage , the base - paring mirna : mre between nucleotides 10 and 11 must be complete ( 23 ) .
this mechanism of action exploits the same mechanisms as rnai silencing ( shrna and sirna ) ( 28 ) .
the factors that can influence the efficacy of the mre include the expression levels and profiles of ago proteins between tissues ( 29 ) and the modulation of their activity by covalent modification ( 30 , 31 ) .
elements of the design of mre that contribute to its efficacy include the number of target sites , the distance between target sites , the sequence composition and local rna structure surrounding its location in the 3'utr ( figure 1 ) .
the optimal design for mre should include a range of target sites , usually from 2 to 8 , allowing a dose - dependent response to mirna concentration ( 32 ) , and a seed separation of between 13 and 35 nt to avoid steric hindrance ( 33 ) .
access to target sites can usually be estimated through the secondary structure , with the minimum free energy ( mfe ) and au - richness surrounding the site ( 34 - 36 ) .
moreover , sites for rna - binding proteins should be avoided since they may also mask mres and hamper recognition .
hence mre engineering might benefit from a computed selection of spacers , to promote optimal separation and secondary structure .
figure 1 microrna response element ( mre ) design for an optimal selectivity of oncolytic viruses .
the design of mre in oncolytic virotherapy has to take into account several elements regarding the biology of the virus and the microrna ( mirna ) regulatory pathways .
although all viral genes with 3'utr are susceptible to be targeted though mre ( 1 ) , it is of notice the toxicity of some viral proteins .
an adequate location in the 3'utr ( 2 ) together with a sufficient mirna expression ( 3 ) will contribute to the target recognition .
perfect mirna - mre complementarity will trigger ago2 slicing activity ( 4 ) ; however , imperfect base - paring with other mirna family members will also contribute to the regulation though translational repression .
the mirnas considered as regulators to bind to mres are selected from those that present abundant expression in normal tissue , but a significantly decreased expression in tumors , such as the ubiquitously expressed mirna let - 7 family ( 18 , 37 , 38 ) .
other studies have exploited tissue - specific mirnas .
some examples of tissue - specific mres are mir - 122 for liver ( 6 , 7 ) , mir - 7 for brain ( 39 ) , mir - 148a for pancreas ( 39 , 40 ) , and mir - 192 for heart ( 41 ) .
in this regard , mirna belonging to the same family can be used to increase the efficacy of mre .
the extensive homology presented by mirna of the same family allows sub - optimal recognition of the mre ( figure 1 ) .
an increased level of complexity in the selection of mirna candidates arises with the design of mres for multiple organs detargeting , usually non - tumoral cells surrounding the tumor and tissues with native viral tropism ( 42 ) .
this can be achieved by using mirnas present in both organs , or by combining multiple mirnas ( 40 ) .
in this context , the extensive mirnome data in the cancer genome atlas ( https :// cancergenome.nih.gov /) for 33 types of cancer and normal tissue constitutes an invaluable resource for the selection of candidate mirnas ( 43 ). of special consideration when seeking to fine - tune oncolytic virus activity is the diversity of cell types in tissue , especially in approaches using locoregional administration .
here , mres could also provide the desired level of selectivity , for example , mir - 375 has been described almost exclusively in the beta and alpha cells present in pancreatic islets ( 44 , 45 ) .
an aspect of mre design , aside from selectivity , that has yet to be tested for oncolytic viruses , is the incorporation of mres as mirna sponges or decoys .
in other areas of gene therapy , sponge mres have been used to reduce the effective amount of mirna content ( 46 - 48 ) .
these particular mre designs are characterized by a bulge that impairs the slicing activity of ago2 , while promoting mirna degradation by way of trimming and tailoring ( 49 ) .
sponge mres could be incorporated into oncolytic viruses to downregulate the mirnas involved in tumor progression ( 50 ) , increase viral replication , or attenuate host antiviral response ( 51 ) .
host mirnas response to viral infection when a virus infects a cell , a host - virus relationship is established , creating an intricate network of interactions characterized by the massive reprogramming of cellular gene expression .
the expression profile of cellular mrnas and mirnas is affected during viral infection ( 52 , 53 ) .
changes in the host mirna profile have been reported after infection with adenoviruses ( 54 - 56 ) , influenza viruses ( 57 , 58 ) , hiv - 1 ( 59 ) , epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) ( 60 , 61 ) , human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) ( 62 ) , human herpes virus 1 ( hsv - 1 ) ( 63 ) , and respiratory syncytial virus ( 64 ). by merely observing mirna profile change , it is difficult to discern whether mirna deregulation is the consequence of a host - immune response to the infection or if it is triggered by the virus to favor replication .
comparative studies of the expression profiles of different viral infections and the analysis of mirna targets can help elucidate the significance of deregulation .
the mirna profile after adenoviral infection has been studied for adenovirus type 3 in human laryngeal epithelial cells ( 56 ) , adenovirus type 2 ( ad2 ) in human primary cells ( 54 ) , and , more recently , for adenovirus type 5 ( ad5 ) in prostate cancer cells ( 55 ) .
ad2 infection studies showed that a correlation between the progression of the infectious cycle and the level of mirna deregulation could be established .
changes in the profile extend from more upregulated , during the early stages of infection , to more downregulated mirnas at the later phases ( 54 ) .
massive mirna downregulation could be the consequence of the expression of the va ( viral associated ) rnas codified by the virus at the later stages of the infection , competing with endogenous mirna biogenesis ( 55 ) ( figure 2a ) .
in fact , the same phenomenon was observed following ad5 infection ( 55 ) .
ad2 and ad5 infection triggered mir - 155 upregulation , an effect also observed after vsv ( 65 ) and ebv infections ( 61 ) , suggesting that mir - 155 could act as a host antiviral mirna .
it is also known that mir - 155 is induced in macrophages , in response to interferon pathway activation ( 66 ) .
figure 2 host microrna ( mirna ) profile alterations in adenoviral infections .
( a ) changes in the mirna profile during the course of an adenoviral infection .
there was a switch from more upregulated mirnas at early steps to more downregulated at late phases , probably as a consequence of va rnas competition with host mirna biogenesis .
( b ) adenoviral infections trigger the overexpression of specific mirnas .
host mir - 155 expression is induced as a consequence of the cell antiviral response .
viral infection promotes the expression of mir - 132 to counteract the antiviral interferon response .
another mirna that has been reported to be upregulated in cells infected by several viruses is mir - 132 .
it has been found to overexpress after adenovirus ( 54 , 55 ) , hsv , kshv , and hcmv infection ( 67 ) .
in contrast to mir - 155 , mir - 132 acts by limiting host antiviral response since it exerts a negative effect on the expression of interferon - stimulated genes .
this is a viral strategy which seeks to evade host antiviral response and promote viral replication ( 67 , 68 ) ( figure 2b ) .
it is probable that viruses have evolved to induce the downregulation of interference mirnas and favor the upregulation of mirnas that can facilitate viral replication ( 54 ) ( figure 2b ) .
several examples illustrate this view .
hsv - 1 causes a series of changes in the mirna profile and antagonizes host defenses by inducing mir - 23a and mir - 649 expression .
these mirnas , respectively , target irf1 and malt1 genes , involved in the antiviral signaling pathway ( 63 , 69 ) .
in turn , the hsv - 1 icp4 protein induces the expression of mir - 101 , which limits virus replication to ensure the survival of host cells and therefore support persistent hsv - 1 infection ( 70 ) .
in cells infected with reolysin , a reovirus currently being tested for the treatment of several cancers ( 71 ) , nuovo et al. observed a modulation of certain mirnas , with clear downregulation of let - 7d , facilitating the productive viral infection and apoptosis - related death of the cancer cells ( 72 ) .
hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) inhibits type i ifn production by upregulating the expression of mir - 21 ( 73 ) , while influenza virus activates the expression of mir - 485 , which targets the cytosolic sensor of viral rna rig - 1 ( 57 ) , and hiv - 1 actively suppresses the expression of mir - 17 and mir - 20a that act against the virus ( 74 ) .
regardless of the mirna changes triggered by viral infection , most cells are already equipped with mirnas that will interact with viral genes .
antiviral mirnas , such as mir - 24 and mir - 93 , have been described to inhibit viral replication by directly targeting viral genes .
otsuka and coworkers described mirna targeting vsv l and p protein genes , therefore inhibiting vsv replication ( 75 ) .
such is also the case for cellular mir - 32 , which targets a sequence in the genome of primate foamy virus type 1 ( 76 ) , or host mir - 214 , which is capable of inhibiting adenovirus replication by targeting the 3'utr of e1a mrna ( 77 ). by contrast , there are pro - viral mirnas , such as mir - 122 , highly expressed in the liver , which interacts with the hcv genome to positively regulate the accumulation of rna ( 78 ) .
thus , ever more experimental data regarding virus - host interactions are currently being generated .
in an attempt to provide some clarity with respect to the complex analysis of the significance of the data , li and coworkers generated an approach that defines potential regulatory networks of viral proteins , human mirnas , and putative mirna transcription factors between host targets ( 79 ) .
deregulation of mirnas in cancer with implications for viral activity as already mentioned , mirna signatures can not only distinguish between normal and cancer cells but also between cancer subtypes , and even between the cell types conforming the tumor itself .
studies have shown that lower expression , or even loss of mirnas , is commonly found in tumor cells ( 80 , 81 ) , where most of them are recognized as tumor suppressors .
on the other hand , fewer mirnas are overexpressed in cancer cells and are considered oncomirs , since they tend to be involved in tumorigenic processes .
both oncomirs and tumor suppressor mirnas contribute to different stages of carcinogenesis ( 82 ) .
on this basis , attempts to modulate mirna expression are an important area of therapeutic development ( 83 ) .
since many mirnas are involved in tumorigenesis , the action of expressing or interfering with a single mirna may have limited anti - cancer effects .
the combination of multiple mirnas with complementary mechanisms may impact on several signal transduction pathways , leading to an improved outcome .
in this respect , multiple long non - coding rnas have been designed for an adenovirus , aiming to cause it to bind to oncomirs , instead of otherwise binding to endogenous targets , and thus achieving the interference of multiple mirnas ( 84 ) .
cancer cells are coupled with abnormal signaling pathways and this has consequences for viral replication .
for example , adenoviruses use interferon signaling to inhibit lytic virus replication in normal cells .
however , they fail to inhibit it from replicating in cancer cells ( 85 ) .
the loss of interferon defenses in tumor cells is one of the mechanisms involved in the cancer selectivity of reovirus ( 86 ) .
exploiting interferon deregulation in cancer is also a strategy employed to provide oncoselectivity for complex viruses ( 87 , 88 ) .
alterations to a variety of other pathways in cancer have constituted the principle option when seeking to confer cancer selectivity to viruses , with a view to cancer treatment ( 89 , 90 ) .
thus , although very little is yet known , one could speculate that the dysregulation of mirnas in cancer may impact viral activity in tumor cells .
although the simplest rationale could claim that the more dysregulated mirnas would be the first candidates when seeking to influence viral replication , recent observation illustrates that this might not always be the case and , in fact , functional interrogation would always be required .
this is a point that was raised by the studies of hodzic and coworkers , in which they showed that mir - 26b , an abundant mirna in prostate cancer cells , promoted adenovirus propagation and spread , leading to increased cell death ( 55 ) .
further studies in this direction will provide a clearer view of the relevance that mirna dysregulation in tumor cells may have with respect to modulating viral activity .
such a body of knowledge could constitute a novel platform in our quest to optimize oncolytic virotherapy .
concluding remarks investigation of mirnas has strongly impacted the field of oncolytic virotherapy .
many studies have shown their potential in precisely detargeting viral protein expression .
the expression of viral protein in normal tissue is an undesired effect .
they are highly immunogenic proteins that the body tends to eliminate , and can cause inflammation and cell death .
thus , the incorporation of mres to regulate viral proteins has been key to improving the safety profile and therapeutic index of oncolytic virotherapy .
fine - tuning the design of the mre has improved the efficacy of both cleavage and detargeting effects .
on the other hand , our understanding of the importance of the role of mirnas in viral infections is increasing .
virus - host cell interaction impacts cellular mirnas and alters their mirnome .
viruses take advantage of host cell mirnas to promote virus replication , but cells react to viral infections by upregulating antiviral mirnas .
interestingly , biological responses to the viral infection of cancer cells with abnormal signaling pathways are not the same as they would be with normal cells , and mirnas would also seem to play a role in this differential response .
up until now , much progress has been made in the engineering of oncolytic viruses with mres in the attempt to provide improved selectivity and safety for their use .
future research may concentrate on further understanding the relationship between host mirnas and viral replication , and how this may differentially impact normal and cancer cells .
such knowledge could prove fundamental and serve as the basis for exploiting newly engineered oncolytic viruses with enhanced antitumor potency .

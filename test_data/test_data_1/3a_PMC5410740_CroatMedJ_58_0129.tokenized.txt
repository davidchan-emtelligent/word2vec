aim to evaluate cytotoxic action of 4 - thiazolidinone derivative les - 3833 and study the mechanisms of its pro - apoptotic action toward human melanoma cells and human tumor cell lines of other tissue origin .
methods the effect of les - 3833 or doxorubicin on the viability of 9 cell lines was studied using mtt assay , while human melanoma cells of wm793 line were additionally examined using light and fluorescent microscopies for evaluating cytomorphological changes .
the western - blot and flow cytometric analyses were carried out to study signaling pathways of melanoma cell cycling and death .
results les - 3833 was the most efficient against melanoma cells .
its half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) was 0.22 mug / ml for wm793 cells and 0.3 mug / ml for sk - mel - 28 melanoma cells .
for human lung a549 , breast mcf - 7 , colon hct116 , and ovarian skov3 carcinoma cell lines ic50 was in between 2.5 to > 5.0 mug / ml. les - 3833 was relatively not toxic ( ic50 > 5 mug / ml ) for human embryonic kidney hek293 cells .
results of annexin v / pi staining of melanoma cells and activation of caspase 3 , parp , mapk , and endog protein suggest apoptosis in les - 3833 - treated cells .
les - 3833 also induced ros production in melanoma cells and their arrest in g0 / g1 phase of cell cycle .
conclusion novel 4 - thiazolidinone derivative les - 3833 is effective against human melanoma cells in vitro , and such effect is tumor specific since it is much less pronounced in human carcinoma and leukemia cells .
in melanoma cells les - 3833 induces apoptosis ( morphological changes and increased pro - apoptotic proteins ) , ros production , and arrest in g0 / g1 phase of cell cycle .
melanoma arises from the melanin - producing skin cells - melanocytes .
it exhibits high metastasis potential and poor prognosis in treated patients with a survival rate of 16.1 % ( 1 ) .
since there is no effective anti - melanoma drugs available in clinics , melanoma remains as one of the most difficult for chemotherapeutic treatment ( 2 ). that is why , the immunomodulating approaches were applied .
they include the application of cytokines ( high - dose of interferon alfa - 2b ( intron a ) and interleukin - 2 ) , and of the antibodies ( ipilimumab , anti - ctla4 and anti - pd - 1 antibodies ) .
other new strategies for melanoma treatment are based on using immune modulators , braf inhibitors ( vemurafenib ) and mek ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) inhibitors .
all these drugs are very costly , and some of them can be highly toxic and not effective ( 3,4 ) .
subsequently , any success in creating novel anti - melanoma drug is a big challenge in development of effective chemotherapy for this highly malignant tumor .
usually , the chemotherapeutic compounds impair not only tumor cells but also exhibit significant negative side effects toward non - tumor cells .
in addition , drug resistance of the melanoma cells develops with high rate .
targeting cell proliferation and apoptotic pathways are principal approaches for understanding pathogenesis of most diseases including cancer .
thus , the agents capable of blocking cell cycle and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells are attractive as novel anticancer medicines ( 5 ) .
4 - thiazolidinones derivatives have been used for the design of novel drugs ( 6,7 ) .
these substances demonstrate wide spectrum of biological effects , including antibacterial , anti - mycotic , hypoglycemic , antineoplastic , immunomodulating , and antidiabetic ( 8 - 12 ) .
moreover , 4 - thiazolidinone core possesses high capacity for chemical modifications that opens great possibilities in the development of novel derivatives .
principal approaches in modification of 4 - thiazolidinone - bearing compounds are focused on the creation of new antibacterial , antiviral , anti - inflammatory , antidiabetic , and anticancer agents ( 12 ) .
4 - thiazolidinones were also used for treatment of neuropathy and nephropathy ( 8 ) .
such compounds induced changes in ca2 + level , the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) activation , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( 5,13 ) .
recent achievements in the medicinal chemistry of 4 - thiazolidinones have significantly stimulated the development of studies addressed on a design of new anticancer agents ( 5 ) .
it was reported that products of the hybridization of thiazolidine - 2,4 - diones scaffolds with different bioactive molecules possessed anticancer activity ( 5 ) .
it was shown that novel 5 - ene - 4 - thiazolidinones possessed a selective anti - leukemic action ( 14 ) .
a search for novel potent antitumor pharmaceuticals demonstrating high selectivity and low toxicity to normal cells is currently strongly prioritized ( 5,8,12 - 14 ) .
in the present work , we evaluated novel synthetic 4 - thiazolodinone derivative , the les - 3833 , as a potent anti - melanoma agent , and compared its toxic action toward tumor cells of other tissue origin , as well as studied the molecular mechanisms of the pro - apoptotic action of this compound .
methods chemical compounds the heterocyclic 4 - thiazolidinone derivative les - 3833 ( figure 1 ) belongs to the pyrazoline - thiazolidinone - isatins conjugates and was synthesized as described previously ( 15 ) .
stock solution of les - 3833 ( 10 mm ) was prepared in the dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso , realab , kyiv , ukraine ) , and dissolved in cell culture medium before addition to the cell culture medium .
doxorubicin ( dox , teva pharmachemie b.v. , haarlem , the netherlands ) was used , as a reference anticancer drug .
figure 1 chemical structure of les - 3833 - 5 - bromo - 3 - { 2 - [ 5 - ( 4 - methoxyphenyl ) - 3 - naphthalen - 2 - yl - 4,5 - dihydropyrazol - 1 - yl ] - 4 - oxo - 4,5 - dihydro - 1,3 - thiazol - 5 - ylidene } - 2,3 - dihydro - 1h - indol - 2 - one .
cell culture human ovarian carcinoma skov3 cells and human melanoma wm793 cells were received from the american type culture collection ( atcc , minnesota , usa ) and were provided by dr o. stasyk ( institute of cell biology , national academy of sciences of ukraine , lviv , ukraine ) .
human melanoma sk - mel - 28 cells , human lung carcinoma a549 cells , human breast adenocarcinoma mcf - 7 cells , human embryonic kidney hek293 cells were obtained from the collection at r.e. kavetsky institute of experimental pathology , oncology and radiobiology ( kyiv , ukraine ) .
human colon carcinoma hct116 cells , human keratinocytes of hacat line and human leukemia k562 cells were donated from a collection of the institute of cancer research at vienna medical university ( vienna , austria ) .
cells were grown in the rpmi - 1640 or dmem ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) culture media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) .
cells were incubated in the co2 - thermostate at 37degreesc in the atmosphere containing 5 % co2 .
anti - proliferative assay in vitro screening of the anticancer action of the synthetized compound les - 3833 and doxorubicin towards tumor cell was measured using the 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyl - tetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) test ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) .
cells were seeded for the night in 100 mul in the 96 - well plates : substrate - dependent cells were seeded at the concentration of 2000 cells / well and suspension cells - at 5000 cells / well .
then , the cells were treated with the les - 3833 and doxorubicin ( none ; 0.1 ; 0.25 ; 0.5 ; 1.0 ; 5.0 ; 10.0 mug / ml ) and incubated for next 72 h. the mitochondrial dehydrogenases converted the mtt to its colored product and water insoluble mtt formazan ( additionally dissolved in the dmso ) was used to determine the viable cells .
product of the reaction was determined by an absorbance reader biotek elx800 ( biotek instruments , inc. , winooski , vt , usa ) at 620 nm wavelength .
in order to study time - dependent cytotoxicity of les - 3833 and dox , cells of wm793 line were treated with these compounds ( none ; 0.1 ; 0.25 ; 0.5 ; 1.0 ; 5.0 ; 10.0 mug / ml ) and incubated for the subsequent 6 , 24 , 48 and 72 h. after that , mtt assay was used to determine the viable cells .
for estimating the impact of ros 's scavengers ( n - acetyl - cysteine ( nac ) and ascorbic acid ( aa ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa )) on the cytotoxicity of les - 3833 and dox on wm793 cells were used in a combination with cell pre - treatment for 30 min with the non - toxic concentrations of ros scavengers ( nac was used in 1.0 ; 2.0 mm : aa - at 25.0 ; 100.0 mum ) ( 14 ) .
fluorescent microscopy the cells of wm793 line were seeded on the glass microscopic slides in the 12 - well plates .
double staining of cells with fitc - conjugated annexin v and propidium iodide ( pi ) ( both from sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) was used to identify early apoptotic events in human melanoma wm793 cells treated with les - 3833 and dox ( both used at 0.25 microg / ml concentration ) for 72 h. after that , cells were washed with 1 x phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) , and incubated for 15 min with the annexin v binding buffer containing 1 / 20 volume of fitc - conjugated annexin v solution and pi ( 20.0 mug / ml ) ( 14 ) .
the cells were analyzed under zeiss fluorescent microscope ( carl zeiss , jena , germany ) using axioimager a1 camera .
in 72 h after the addition of the tested compounds at 1 microg / ml concentration , the cells were stained with 0.2 - 0.5 microg / ml of the dna - specific fluorescent dye hoechst 33342 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) .
the cells were also stained by the poly - specific dye acridine orange ( ao , 0.3 - 1.0 microg / ml , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) .
the cells were incubated for next 20 - 30 min and examined using a zeiss fluorescent microscope ( carl zeiss , jena , germany ) using axioimager a1 camera .
western - blot analysis proteins of cells treated with the tested compound ( dox was used in 0.25 microg / ml concentration , les - 3833 - in 0.25 and 0.5 microg / ml ) were separated by the sds / page gel - electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane , as described ( 13 ) .
the antibodies for cleaved caspase 3 ( asp175 ) , cleaved parp ( asp214 ) , anti - phospho - erk1 / 2 ( phospho - p44 / 42 , thr 202 / tyr 204 ) , anti - endog , anti - stat3 , anti - phospho - rb ( ser 807 / 811 ) , ( cell signaling technology , new england biolabs gmbh , austria ) , anti - cdk2 ( santacruzbiotechnology , inc. , dallas , texas , usa ) , anti - beta - actin monoclonal mouse ac - 15 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) were used .
secondary rabbit and mouse peroxidase - labeled antibodies ( cellsignaling technology , new england biolabs gmbh , austria ) were used at working dilution of 1:5 000 .
cell cycle analysis to analyze cell cycle distribution , wm793 cells were seeded into 6 - well plates and then treated with the les - 3833 or doxorubicin at 0.25 microg / ml for 72 h. cells were prepared as described ( 14 ) , stained with pi ( 5 mug / ml ) and analyzed by flow cytometry ( becton dickinson , paloalto , ca , usa ) .
statistical analysis results were presented as the mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
graphpad prism 6 was used for results analysis , charting , t test or two - way anova test .
p < 0.05 was set as the level of statistical significance .
results anticancer activity in vitro of 4 - thiazolidinone derivative les - 3833 in vitro screening of the cytotoxic action of les - 3833 and doxorubicin against different tumor cell lines was performed by mtt assay .
the results of such testing of human breast adenocarcinoma mcf - 7 cells , human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells , human colon carcinoma hct116 cells , human ovarian carcinoma skov3 cells are presented in figure 2 and summarized in table 1 .
the les - 3833 demonstrated very low activity against the ovarian carcinoma skov3 cells ( half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) > 5 mug / ml ) , and low activity against other human carcinoma cells of a549 , hct116 , and mcf - 7 lines ( ic50 was 2.5 +/ - 0.19 mug / ml ( a549 cells ) , 3.4 +/ - 0.32 mug / ml ( hct116 cells ) , and 4.5 +/ - 0.36 mug / ml ( mcf - 7 cells )) .
the cytotoxicity index ( ie , ic50 ) of doxorubicin in all above noted cell lines was notably higher than of the les - 3833 ( figure 2 , table 2 ) .
an increase of the panel of tumor cells treated with the les - 3833 and doxorubicin by human myeloid leukemia k562 cells growing in suspension culture did not reveal a significant cytotoxic activity of either les - 3833 or doxorubicin ( ic50 > 5 mug / ml for both ) .
the les - 3833 was less toxic ( ic50 > 5mug / ml ) than the doxorubicin ( ic50 = 3.2 +/ - 0.42 mug / ml ) toward human embryonic kidney cells of hek293 line and toward human keratinocytes of hacat line ( ic50 for les - 3833 was 3.16 +/ - 0.41 mug / ml and ic50 for doxorubicin was 0.47 +/ - 0.07 mug / ml , figure 2 , table 1 ) .
figure 2 growth inhibiting activity of les - 3833 and dox toward different human cell lines .
cell vitality was estimated by the mtt assay after 72 h of experiment .
dox was used as a positive control .

it was found ( figure 2 , table 2 ) that the ic50 value equals 0.22 +/ - 0.03 mug / ml ( wm793 cell line ) and 0.3 +/ - 0.04 mug / ml ( sk - mel - 28 cell line ) which is more than 10 times lower than the ic50 noted above at the action of the les - 3833 toward various human carcinoma cell lines .
this allowed to suggest a higher specificity of the cytotoxic action of the les - 3833 toward melanoma cells , comparing with that in human carcinoma cells .
doxorubicin possessed similar to the les - 3833 cytotoxic effect toward human melanoma cells of wm793 cells ( ic50 = 0.24 mug / ml ) and sk - mel - 28cells ( 0.35 mug / ml ) ( figure 2 , table 1 ) .
it should be noted that the cytotoxic effect of the les - 3833 toward human melanoma wm793 cells demonstrated both dose - dependence ( figure 2 ) and time - dependence ( table 2 ) .
cytotoxic action of les - 3833 toward human melanoma cells is accompanied by morphological changes in treated cells following the cytotoxic action of the les - 3833 in comparison with the doxorubicin ( figure 2 , table 1 ) , it was reasonable to estimate its cell damaging effect with the fluorescent microscopy .
treatment of human melanoma wm793 cells with the les - 3833 or doxorubicin ( both used at 1 microg / ml ) led to pro - apoptotic fragmentation of the nucleus , and chromatin condensation ( figure 1 ) .
besides , most of the treated cells got a rounded shape .
red staining of cytosol regions with acridine orange suggested the activation of the lysosomes caused by the les - 3833 in the melanoma cells .
it should be noted that doxorubicin induced less visible damages in these cells ( figure 3 ) .

right - fluorescent image of treated cells ( blue color - staining with fluorescent dna - specific dye hoechst - 33342 , red and green color - staining with poly - specific fluorescent dye acridine orange ) .
les - 3833 induces ros production in human melanoma cells it has been reported that several anticancer drugs induced a production of ros that could be partly responsible for their cytotoxic action ( 17,18 ) .
in order to check whether the cytotoxicity of the les - 3833 relies on the intracellular ros effects , we have used ros scavengers such as nac and aa. nac is a precursor of glutathione and scavenger of h2o2 ( 14,18 ) .
the aa protects cells of the oxidative stress and it is a scavenger of the hydroxyl radicals ( 14,19 ) .
both nac and aa distinctly inhibited the action of les - 3833 and enhanced a survival of human melanoma wm793 cells ( figure 4 ) .
thus , ros production induced by the les - 3833 in melanoma cells might be one of the mechanisms responsible for its antineoplastic activity .
figure 4 protective effect of n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) and ascorbic acid ( aa ) on the cytotoxic action of compound les - 3833 toward human melanoma wm793 cells .
the les - 3833 was added to culture medium after 30 min pre - treatment of cells with nac or aa. the viability of cells was determined by the mtt assay after 72 h effect of the compound .
les - 3833 induces an increase in ratio of annexin v - positive melanoma cells human melanoma wm793 cells were stained after treatment with fitc - conjugated annexin v and pi , and then analyzed by fluorescent microscopy .
the amount of the annexin v - positive ( apoptotic ) cells affected by the les - 3833 ( 52.5 %) was notable and higher than in control untreated cells ( 9.0 %) ( figure 5 ) .
under the action of the les - 3833 , the amount of pi - positive ( necrotic ) cells increased ( 11.5 %) in comparison to the control ( 2.5 %) , but much less than annexin v - positive cells .
these results suggest that the les - 3833 caused melanoma cell death mainly via apoptosis mechanisms .
figure 5 effect of the les - 3833 and doxorubicin on induction of apoptosis in human melanoma wm793 cells .
ratio of the annexin v / fitc positive ( anv +) and propidium iodide positive ( pi +) cells was analyzed by the fluorescent microscopy study of the annexin v / pi double staining of wm793 cells treated for 72 h with the les - 3833 or doxorubicin both used in 0.25 microg / ml concentration .
* p <= 0.05 ( difference compared with the control ) .
expression of apoptosis - related proteins in human melanoma cells treated with les - 3833 to verify that apoptosis is induced by a specific agent , one needs a confirmation of apoptosis expression by using at least three alternative approaches .
thus , we have conducted the western - blot analysis of the apoptosis - related proteins in the les - 3833 - treated melanoma cells .
the level of activated ( cleaved ) caspase 3 and inactivated ( cleaved ) poly - [ adp ribose ] - polymerase - 1 ( parp - 1 ) was increased in melanoma cells treated for 72 h with the les - 3833 ( figure 6 ) .
besides , compound stimulated phosphorylation of the extracellular - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) belonging to the mapk family ; induced the endog proteins ; and dose - dependently decreased the level of stat3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) protein ( figure 6 ) .
figure 6 pro - apoptotic proteins and transcription factor stat3 ( western - blot analysis ) in human melanoma wm793 cells treated for 72 h with the les - 3833 .
c - control ( untreated cells ) .
changes in melanoma cell cycle pattern induced by les - 3833 a loss of cell cycle control can be the indicator of cell transformation and carcinogenesis in the mammalians ( 20 ) .
we used the western - blot analysis ( figure 7 , a ) and facs analysis ( figure 7 , b ) in order to monitor changes in cell cycle - related proteins and changes in cell cycle pattern , correspondingly , under the action of the les - 3833 toward human melanoma wm793 cells .
it was found that the treatment of the melanoma cells with this compound caused a decrease of cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( cdk2 ) as well as a decrease of the phosphorylated rb ( retinoblastoma ) protein ( figure 7 , a ) .
these regulators are responsible for the g1 to s phase of cell cycle transition ( 14 ) .
the next step of our study was to use facs analysis for monitoring the les - 3833 - induced changes in distribution of melanoma cell cycle phases .
we have shown that the les - 3833 caused a 12.3 % increase ( comparing with the untreated cells ) of cell number in the g0 / g1 phase , while the doxorubicin significantly increased ( 42.5 % more than in the control ) a cell number in the g2 / m phase ( figure 7 , b ) .
these data suggest a principle difference in the molecular mechanisms of action of the les - 3833 compared with that of the doxorubicin .
figure 7 the results of measuring the effect of the les - 3833 ( 72 h treatment ) on expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and cell cycle distribution in human melanoma wm793 cells by using western - blot analysis ( a ) or flow cytometry analysis ( facs ) ( b ) .
c - control ( untreated cells ) .
summarizing , 4 - thiazolidinone derivative les - 3833 possesses high cytotoxic action against human melanoma cells of two different lines ( sk - mel - 28 and wm793 ) .
moreover , it is much less effective in inhibiting the viability of human carcinoma cells of various lines , and it has a very low activity toward human leukemia k562 cells , human embryonic kidney hek293 cells and human keratinocytes of hacat line .
the les - 3833 induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells with an activation of caspase 3 and influenced the apoptosis - related proteins such as parp , mapks , and endo g. probably , the les - 3833 affects the mitochondria - mediated apoptotic pathway ( figure 8 ) .
it increased a number of the annexin v - positive melanoma cells and a number of such cells in the g0 / g1 phase of cell cycle .
in addition , the les - 3833 action led to the intracellular accumulation of ros , since the cytotoxicity of this compound was inhibited by such ros scavenges as n - acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid .
figure 8 general scheme of signaling pathways induced by les - 3833 in melanoma cells .
discussion in our previous studies , cytotoxic action ( mtt assay and trypan blue exclusion test ) of 3 structurally related 4 - thiazolidinones - compounds les - 3833 , les - 3882 and les - 3288 and doxorubicin was compared for rat c6 glioma cells ( 21 ) .
it was revealed that melanoma cell lines were the most sensitive ( ic50 in the mtt assay ) to les - 3833 , and that was the main reason for taking a decision to carry out more profound analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the cytotoxic action of this agent .
this study confirmed using broad panel of human tumor cells that the les - 3833 possesses the highest cytotoxic effect toward melanoma cells of wm793 line and sk - mel - 28 cell line .
these effects were comparable with that of the doxorubicin .
thus , we have detected tumor tissue - specific toxic action of the les - 3833 for the melanoma cells , but not for other tumor cells of the epithelial origin .
in case of mesenchyme - derived tumors les - 3833 had low activity against human myeloid leukemia k562 cells ( ic50 > 5 microg / ml ) , although in other studies a toxic action of this compound was shown for murine leukemia l1210 cells ( ic50 = 1 microg / ml ) ( 22 ) .
low cytotoxicity of the les - 3833 toward human embryonic kidney hek293 cells and human keratinocytes hacat cells should be stressed , since it is known that most anticancer drugs act not only on well proliferating tumor cells but also exhibit negative side effects toward the non - tumor cells ( 6 ) .
as predicted , the doxorubicin was highly toxic for all types of human tumor cells under this study , as well for human embryonic kidney hek293 cells and human keratinocytes hacat cells .
the revealed strong cytotoxic action of the les - 3833 toward human melanoma cells was confirmed by its damaging action on the morphology of these cells .
it is known that specific pro - apoptotic changes in the morphology of the apoptotic cells can be observed in addition to biochemical changes such as dna damage , activation of caspases , release of cytochrome c from mitochondria , or others ( 23 ) .
during microscopic studies of les - 3833 action on human melanoma wm793 cells chromatin condensation typical for apoptosis was found .
strong activation of lysosomes ( acridine orange staining of cytosol regions in red color ) under les - 3833 treatment should be noted , since it was even higher than such activation induced by the doxorubicin .
acridine orange is a basic amino dye that possesses lysosomotropic action .
after accumulation in lysosomes with acid ph , it demonstrates red fluorescence , while at neutral ph in the nuclei it emits yellow - green fluorescence .
uptake of foreign material by cells leads to activation of digestive vacuoles causing red fluorescence of accumulated acridine orange in the lysosomes ( 24 - 26 ) .
an increase in number of the annexin v - positive melanoma cells at their treatment with the les - 3833 is strong argument in favor of the apoptotic way of death of these cells .
it was shown that les - 3833 did not affect considerably a number of the propidium iodide - positive melanoma cells that excluded a major role of necrosis during melanoma cell killing by this agent .
the results of fluorescent microscopy measuring of the amount of the annexin v - and the pi - positive melanoma cells under the action of the les - 3833 were comparable to doxorubicin , which indicated the anticancer potential of les - 3833 .
in order to obtain more direct evidence of apoptosis induced by the les - 3833 in human melanoma wm793 cells , the activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of the reparation enzyme parp - 1 were monitored by the western - blot analysis .
we also found that erk1 / 2 / mapks , and endog levels were increased under the action of the les - 3833 .
both caspase 3 and parp - 1 belong to principal biochemical markers of apoptosis ( 27 ) , while the protein kinases erk1 / 2 / mapks were shown to respond the action of various stressing agents , including the anticancer drugs ( 5,6 ) .
parp - 1 used nad + to cause the poly ( adp - ribosyl ) ation of proteins ( 27 ) .
a design of new anticancer chemotherapeutics is intensively developing for creation of novel parp inhibitors .
thus , the intactness of parp - 1 and parp - 2 could be the prognostic biomarkers at drug development ( 5,6,27 ) .
parp - 1 degradation induced by the les - 3833 in human melanoma cells demonstrates an additional mechanism in the biological action of this potential anticancer drug .
similar compounds - troglitazones and 3 - ( 2 - amino - ethyl ) - 5 - ( 4 - ethoxybenzylidene ) - thiazolidine - 2,4 - dione - induced the inhibition of growth of human pancreatic cancer cells and human leukemia cells through the mapk signaling pathway ( 28 - 30 ) .
it was shown that 5 - ene - 4 - thiazolidinones induced apoptosis in the acute promyelocytic leukemia hl - 60 cells via modulating mapk signaling pathway ( 14 ) .
thus , the activation of mapk / erk1 / 2 pathway in tumor cells might be a common mechanism of cytotoxic action of 4 - thiazolidinones , including the les - 3833 , toward human tumor cells .
it was reported that the mechanisms of anticancer effect of 4 - thiazolidinones and similar heterocycles could be related to the activation of caspase cascade , changes in the intracellular ca2 + and mitochondria functioning , a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria , and / or the endoplasmic reticulum stress ( 6,28 ) .
endog ( endonuclease g ) is a mitochondrial protein released at apoptosis , and it is involved in caspase - independent dna degradation ( 31 ) .
endog elevation induced by the les - 3833 in melanoma cells allow one to suggest that these cells undergo apoptosis via the mitochondria - mediated pathway .
interestingly , the doxorubicin did not affect the level of the endog protein in treated melanoma cells that suggested different mechanism of action of les - 3833 and doxorubicin in these tumor cells .
stat3 is a transcription factor involved in regulation of expression of different genes under the action of various growth factors and cytokines that influence cell growth and apoptosis ( 5,6 ) .
stat3 level was decreased in human melanoma wm793 cells treated with the les - 3833 for 72 h , while the doxorubicin did not affect the level of this transcription factor .
thus , the action of les - 3833 is mediated via various signaling pathways in the cell suggesting a uniqueness of this potent anticancer substance .
les - 3833 induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells with an activation of caspase 3 and influenced the apoptosis - related proteins such as parp , mapks , and endo g. probably , the les - 3833 affected the mitochondria - mediated apoptotic pathway ( figure 8 ) .
it was reasonable to compare the action of the les - 3833 with that of the doxorubicin on cell cycling and the levels of the related regulatory proteins .
we have found that les - 3833 decreased the level of both cdk2 and phosphorylated form of rb protein in human melanoma cells of wm793 line .
the activity of cyclin - dependent kinase 2 is important for the g1 / s transition , and the retinoblastoma protein is a tumor suppressor whose action is impaired in many tumors .
inactivation of the rb protein by phosphorylation runs the cell cycle progression ( 5,32,33 ) .
rb phosphorylation in the g1 phase is catalyzed by the cdk2 / cyclin e complex , and it is needed for cell transition to the s phase ( 14,33 ) .
the les - 3833 and doxorubicin induced similar degree in decrease in both the cdk2 and rb proteins , however , the distribution of cell cycle phases under the action of these drugs differed significantly .
while doxorubicin , as predicted ( 14,34 ) , arrested melanoma cells in the g2 / m phase , the les - 3833 induced the accumulation of these cells in the g0 / g1 phase .
the arrest of tumor cell cycling in either g0 / g1 or g2 / m stages is of great interest , and it strongly depends on the expression of cyclin - cdk inhibitors - p21 and p27 proteins ( 32 ) .
ros are important in the action of several anticancer drugs , however , these agents are also damaging cells of normal tissues and organs ( negative side effects ) ( 14,17,18,21,35,36 ) .
the results of our studies suggest that the action of the les - 3833 in human melanoma wm793 cells is dependent on ros induced by this agent , since nac and aa blocked the cytotoxic effect of the les - 3833 .
it was reported that doxorubicin disturbed a balance of ros and enzymes of the antioxidant defense in blood serum of laboratory rats that could be one of the reasons of high general toxicity of this anticancer drug .
at the same time , 4 - thiazolidinones derivatives les - 3288 , les - 3833 , and les - 3882 were much less effective there ( 21 ) .
the level of the malonic dialdehyde ( indicator of ros content ) was also increased at the les - 3833 action , although a magnitude of that increase was less than at the action of doxorubicin ( 21 ) .
probably , in the cytotoxic action of the les - 3833 , ros play more important role than they play it in the action of other 4 - thiazolidinones derivatives ( les - 3288 and les - 3882 ) .
in a recent study , we have demonstrated that 5 - [ 5 - ( 2 - hydroxyphenyl ) - 3 - phenyl - 4,5 - dihydropyrazol - 1 - ylmethylene ] - 3 - ( 3 - acetoxyphenyl ) - 2 - thioxothiazolidin - 4 - one that is 5 - ene - 4 - thiazolidinone derivative was highly toxic for human promyelocytic leukemia cells of hl - 60 line ( ic50 = 118 nm ) with low toxicity toward human embryonic kidney cells of hek293t line and murine mesenchymal preosteoblastic cells of ks 483 line ( 14 ) .
this potent drug caused mitochondria - depended apoptosis and induced g0 / g1 arrest in treated cells .
it also activated ros production ( 14 ) .
other investigators found that ros level was increased by 5 - ene - 4 - thiazolidinones in human colorectal adenocarcinoma ht29 cells and the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cem cells ( 18 ) .
in addition , the action of many chemotherapeutic agents is based on increasing ros levels , and the resulting induction of the irreparable apoptosis - related damages in tumor cells ( 17 ) .
ros - induced apoptosis can be linked to the mitochondrial oxidative stress causing cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspases ( 36 ) .
conclusion toxic action of les - 3833 , a novel 4 - thiazolidinone derivative , toward 7 human tumor cell lines was studied , and human melanoma cells of wm793 and sk - mel - 28 lines were found to be the most sensitive .
human carcinoma cells of various tissue origin , as well as human embryonic kidney cells of hek293 line and human keratinocytes of hacat line , were relatively resistant to such action .
results of annexin v / pi staining of melanoma cells , character of activation of caspase 3 , parp , mapk , and endog protein , and the morphological changes suggest induction of apoptosis in les - 3833 - treated cells .
this agent also induced ros production in melanoma cells and their arrest in g0 / g1 phase of cell cycle .

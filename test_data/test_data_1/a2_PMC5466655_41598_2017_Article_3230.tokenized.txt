adriamycin is a first - line chemotherapy agent against cancer , but the development of resistance has become a major problem .
although autophagy is considered to be an adaptive survival response in response to chemotherapy and may be associated with chemoresistance , its inducer and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear .
here , we demonstrate that adriamycin up - regulates the both levels of trpc5 and autophagy , and the increase in autophagy is mediated by trpc5 in breast cancer cells .
blockade of trpc5 or autophagy increased the sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo .
notably , we revealed a positive correlation between trpc5 and the autophagy - associated protein lc3 in paired patients with or without anthracycline - taxane - based chemotherapy .
furthermore , pharmacological inhibition and gene - silencing showed that the cytoprotective autophagy mediated by trpc5 during adriamycin treatment is dependent on the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway .
moreover , adriamycin - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells maintained a high basal level of autophagy , and silencing of trpc5 and inhibition of autophagy counteracted the resistance to adriamycin .
thus , our results revealed a novel role of trpc5 as an inducer of autophagy , and this suggests a novel mechanism of drug resistance in chemotherapy for breast cancer .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the major cause of cancer - related death among women worldwide1 , 2 , while adriamycin ( adm ) , is the first - line chemotherapy agent against this form of cancer .
however , the acquisition of adm resistance is a leading cause of treatment failure3 - 5 .
it has been demonstrated that impairment of apoptotic signaling is the main mechanism of drug resistance6 - 8 , but the underlying mechanisms are still not entirely clear .
therefore , understanding the signaling pathways underling the resistance of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies .
human canonical transient receptor potential channel 5 ( trpc5 ) is a ca2 + - permeable cation channel that is expressed in many types of cells9 - 11 , and is involved in several neuronal and vascular diseases12 - 14 .
our previous studies have demonstrated that trpc5 is associated with cancer chemotherapy .
our findings showed that overexpression of trpc5 induces chemoresistance by up - regulating of p - glycoprotein and hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha in chemoresistant breast cancer cells15 , 16 .
our recent studies have suggested that the level of trpc5 in circulating extracellular vesicles may be correlated with the clinical response to chemotherapy17 .
therefore , trpc5 may be a good molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer .
macroautophagy ( here referred to simply as autophagy ) , an evolutionarily - conserved lysosomal pathway , is functions in the degradation of long - lived proteins , cellular macromolecules , and whole organelles18 , 19 .
it is characterized by the formation of a closed double - membrane vacuole , named the autophagosome , which matures in a stepwise process involving engulfing events and fusion with endolysosomal vesicles20 , 21 .
lysosomal hydrolases digest the contents of autolysosomes to recyclable breakdown products , generating energy to confer stress tolerance22 , 23 .
autophagy also plays a critical role in cancer development and death24 - 26 .
while some reports have indicated that this process can support cancer cell survival27 - 29 , in contrast , several studies have suggested that autophagy promotes cancer cell death30 , 31 .
the different roles of autophagy in cancer seem to depend on tumor type , stage , genomic context and setting26 .
in general , autophagy suppresses tumor initiation , but it promotes tumor progression and is considered to be a key survival pathway in response to stress .
a number of anticancer drugs induce the apoptotic cell death pathway while simultaneously triggering an autophagic response .
in cancer therapy , most of the data point to autophagy as a protective pathway that delays apoptotic cell death .
the inhibition of autophagy significantly enhances the cell death induced by epirubicin in mcf - 7 cells and triple - negative breast cancer cells32 , 33 .
however , the mechanism by which chemotherapy induces this protective autophagy and the identity of the inducing factor remain unclear .
given these findings , we hypothesized that trpc5 is the inducer that initiates autophagy during chemotherapy .
therefore , we set out to test this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between trpc5 and autophagy in drug sensitive / resistance breast cancer cells .
we found that trpc5 - regulated autophagy contributes to development of chemotherapy resistance in drug sensitive breast cancer cells and maintenance of drug resistance in mcf - 7 / adm cells , which is linked to ca2 +/ calmodulin - dependent protein kinase kinase beta ( camkkbeta )/ amp - activated protein kinasealpha ( ampkalpha )/ mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) signaling pathway .
these results revealed a novel role of trpc5 as an inducer of autophagy , which may suggest a novel mechanism of drug resistance in chemotherapy for breast cancer .
results chemotherapy increases trpc5 expression and autophagy in breast carcinoma cells to determine whether chemotherapy enhances trpc5 expression and autophagy in breast carcinoma cells , we detected microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( lc3 - i and lc3 - ii ) and trpc5 by western blotting .
lc3 - ii is a reliable marker of autophagy , specifically associated with the development and maturation of autophagosomes .
mcf - 7 , t47d , and mda - mb 231 cells were exposed to 400 , 300 , and 800nmol / l adm respectively for 48 h after which their viability on exposure to adm was reduced , as assessed by mtt ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
also the adm exposure markedly increased their trpc5 and lc3 - ii levels ( fig. 1a ) .
transcriptional alterations of trpc5 were also assayed by quantitative real - time pcr and the results revealed that trpc5 mrna expression was increased after treatment with adm ( supplementary figure s2a ) .
the increased expression of trpc5 was time dependent in the case of mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells during adm treatment ( supplementary figure s2b ) .
in addition , lc3 puncta formation was tested by fluorescent imaging analysis .
the number of lc3 dots per cell was significantly higher in cells exposed to adm than in those without drug exposure ( fig. 1b ) .
next , we assessed the autophagic flux in cells exposure to adm with or without the lysosomal protease inhibitors e64d and pepstatin a , which have been used to distinguish between the induction of autophagy and the suppression of autophagic vesicle degradation .
we found that e64d and pepstatina could further increased the lc3 - ii levels , suggesting that the increased lc3 - ii levels were attributable to promotion of autophagy but not to disruption of autophagic degradation ( fig. 1c ) ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
to further confirm our results , we explored autophagy in adm - resistant human breast cancer cells ( mcf - 7 / adm ) , generated by stepwise increasing concentrations of adm over 8 months .
as shown in fig. 1d , drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells had higher lc3 - ii expression than mcf - 7 cells .
lysosomal protease inhibitors further increased the lc3 - ii level in mcf - 7 / adm cells ( fig. 1d ) .
these experiments showed that mcf - 7 / adm cells have enhanced basal levels of autophagy .
taken together , our results suggested that trpc5 and autophagy are both up - regulated breast carcinoma cells during adm exposure .

chemotherapy - induced autophagy is regulated by trpc5 in breast carcinoma cells to determine whether trpc5 regulates autophagy in response to adm , we assessed the lc3 - ii level and lc3 puncta formation in breast cancer cells transfected with or without trpc5 sirna .
knockdown of trpc5 markedly decreased the amount of trpc5 and the lc3 - ii level in breast carcinoma cells exposed to adm ( fig. 2a ) .
the number of lc3 dots per cell was significantly attenuated after trpc5 - silencing and adm exposure ( fig. 2b ) .
moreover , trpc5 knockdown decreased the lc3 - ii level and lc3 puncta formation in drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells ( fig. 2c ) .
to further investigate the role of trpc5 - induced autophagy in breast cancer cells during chemotherapy , we transfected mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells with full - length human trpc5 and found that overexpression of trpc5 significantly increased lc3 - ii levels and lc3 puncta formation ( fig. 2d and e ) .
lc3 puncta formation was also significantly enhanced by trpc5 overexpression in breast cancer cells under chemotherapy ( fig. 2f ) .
additionally , trpc5 - silencing or - overexpression did not change the lc3 mrna level ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
together , our data suggested that chemotherapy - induced autophagy is regulated by trpc5 in breast carcinoma cells .
figure 2 chemotherapy induced autophagy is regulated by trpc5 in breast carcinoma cells .
( a ) mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells were transfected with sitrpc5 or sictl for 24 h and then exposed to adm for 48 h. the levels of trpc5 , lc3 , and actb were quantified by western blot .

silencing of trpc5 or inhibition of autophagy increases the sensitivity of breast carcinoma cells to chemotherapy to determine whether trpc5 - induced autophagy plays a role in the regulation of cell death in response to adm , sirna against trpc5 was transfected into mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231cells .
knockdown of trpc5 expression made these cells more sensitive to adm - induced damage ( fig. 3a and b ) .
we also investigate the recovery and proliferation of these cells using clonogenic crystal violet recovery assays .
the results showed that 43 % of mcf - 7 cells proliferated cells in 5 nmol / l adm and 38 % of mda - mb 231 cells proliferated in 10 nmol / l adm relative to untreated cells ( supplementary figure s5a ) .
knockdown of trpc5 was more effective in reducing proliferation with 8 % of mcf - 7 cells and 5 % of mda - mb 231 cells remaining under adm exposure relative to sirna control ( fig. 3c ) .
moreover , we also determined the effect of trpc5 suppression in the drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells , which showed a significant reduction in proliferation compared with adm exposure alone ( supplementary figure s5b and c ) .
trpc5 - overexpressing cells became more resistant to adm - induced injury and this was associated with greater recovery of cells under adm exposure ( fig. 3d and e ) .
in addition , chloroquine ( cq , an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification , used as a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy ) or 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - ma ) resulted in reduced viability and less colony formation with adm in mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells ( fig. 3f and g ) ( supplementary figure s6a and b ) .
cq and 3 - ma also decreased the recovery and proliferation of drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells relative to adm alone ( fig. 3h and i ) ( supplementary figure s6c and d ) .
these results suggested that silencing of trpc5 or inhibition of autophagy increases the sensitivity of breast carcinoma cells to chemotherapy .

trpc5 induces autophagy via the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway in response to chemotherapy to address the potential mechanism by which trpc5 initiates autophagy , we investigated the downstream of trpc5 and autophagy - associated kinases .
as shown in fig. 4a and b , we found that adm exposure increased the cytosolic ca2 + concentration ([ ca2 +] i ) and knockdown of trpc5 decreased the [ ca2 +] i in mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells ( supplementary figure s7 ) .
overexpression of trpc5 increased the [ ca2 +] i in mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells ( supplementary figure s8 ) .
after exposing mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells to adm , we found significant increases of the phosphorylated camkkbeta level , which occurs downstream of trpc5 ( fig. 4c ) 34 .
previous studies have shown that camkkbeta activates ampkalpha by phosphorylation35 , 36 .
consistent with this finding , ampkalpha activity was markedly increased in both cell lines under adm exposure ( fig. 4c ) .
it has been reported that ampkalpha activates autophagy by down - regulating the activity of mtor37 , 38 .
our results showed that the level of phosphorylated mtor and p70s6k was greatly decreased after exposure to adm ( fig. 4c ) .
these findings suggested that the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway may be required for trpc5 induced autophagy in response to adm .
in order to further explore whether adm exposure leads to enhanced trpc5 expression , which would allow a higher [ ca2 +] i to active camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor - mediated autophagy , we silenced the trpc5 expression with sirna and assessed the activity of this pathway .
we found that suppressing of trpc5 expression significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated camkkbeta and ampkalpha , and increased the level of phosphorylated mtor and p70s6k under adm exposure ( fig. 4d ) .
addition of the intracellular ca2 + chelator bapta / am markedly inhibited the activity of camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway and reduced the lc3 - ii levels ( fig. 4e ) .
thus , [ ca2 +] i regulated by trpc5 may be most likely required for the initiation of autophagy in response to chemotherapy .
when we silenced camkkbeta using sirna in mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells , the activity of ampkalpha and the accumulation of lc3 - ii were inhibited and the activity of mtor was enhanced on exposure to adm ( fig. 4f ) .
similar to the effect of camkkbeta - silencing , knockdown of ampkalpha also significantly augmented the phosphorylated mtor levels and attenuated the accumulation of lc3 - ii compared with the sirna control under adm exposure ( fig. 4g ) .
moreover , the number of lc3 dots per cell in response to adm was significantly decreased after knockdown of camkkbeta or ampkalpha ( fig. 4h and i ) .
addition of bapta / am also reduced the number of lc3 dots per cell with exposure to adm in breast cancer cells ( fig. 4h and i ) .
sto - 609 , an inhibitor of camkkbeta , and compound c , an inhibitor of ampk also attenuated the numbers of lc3 puncta in mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells ( fig. 4j and k ) .
moreover , bapta / am , sto - 609 , and compound c also decreased the level of lc3 - ii in drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells ( fig. 4l ) .
in addition , we found that bapta / am and knockdown of camkkbeta or ampkalpha reduced viability of mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells with adm exposure ( fig. 5a to c ) .
clonogenicity also decreased in these cells ( fig. 5e,g and i ) .
notably , inhibition of the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway also enhanced the sensitivity of drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells to adm ( fig. 5d,f and h ) .
these results revealed that trpc5 mediates the cytoprotective autophagy during adm exposure via the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway .
figure 4 trpc5 induces autophagy via the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway in response to chemotherapy .
( a and b ) treatment of indicated cells with adm for 48 h increased the basal [ ca2 +] i and sitrpc5 blocked the adm - induced increase in [ ca2 +] i .
( c ) exposure of indicated cells to adm for 48 h was followed by analysis of the protein levels of p - camkkbeta , camkkbeta , p - ampkalpha , ampkalpha , p - mtor , mtor , p - p70s6k , p70s6k and actb by western blot .

suppression of autophagy by down - regulated trpc5 increases sensitivity to adm in vivo to explore whether the targeted inhibition of trpc5 - induced autophagy also enhances sensitivity to adm in vivo , we subcutaneously injected nude mice with mcf - 7 and mda - mb 231 cells that had previously been transfected with trpc5 shrna lentiviral particles .
the growth of trpc5 - knockdown cancer cells after adm exposure was markedly less than in cells transfected with control shrna ( supplemental figure s9 ) .
we found that cancer cells transfected with trpc5 shrna showed attenuated autophagy with adm exposure ( fig. 6a ) .
notably , the expression of lc3 was significantly higher in drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm xenografts than in mcf - 7 xenografts ( supplemental figure s10 ) .
in order to investigate the clinical potential of trpc5 in the induction of autophagy in breast cancer , we analyzed breast cancer tissue from 31 paired patients with or without anthracycline - taxane - based chemotherapy ( supplementary table s1 ) .
the results showed that both trpc5 and lc3 expression was markedly up - regulated after chemotherapy ( fig. 6b and c ) .
in addition , we found statistically significant positive correlations between trpc5 and lc3 expression ( fig. 6d ) .

discussion many breast cancer patients acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and this phenomenon is the major cause of death .
although chemotherapy - induced autophagy is now recognized to be an important contributor to chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells , the underlying mechanism and the inducer of this effect remain unclear .
here , we showed that trpc5 - regulated autophagy is an important contributor to the development and maintenance of drug resistance in breast cancer .
blockade of trpc5 and autophagy augmented breast cancer cell death in response to chemotherapy .
we also found significant positive correlations between trpc5 and autophagy in patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
different mechanisms involving dysfunctional drug transports , resistance to cell death , and the production of cancer stem like cells have been reported to contribute to chemoresistance .
our previous studies showed that the overexpression of trpc5 up - regulates the level of p - glycoprotein to maintain chemoresistance in drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells , suggesting that trpc5 plays a role in regulating drug transporters .
greka a et al. reported that trpc5 regulates neurite outgrowth39 .
here , we found that adm exposure enhanced the expression of trpc5 in drug sensitive breast cancer cells ( mcf - 7 , t47d and mda - mb 231 cells ) .
moreover , silencing of trpc5 expression enhanced death and suppressed recovery in breast cancer cells under chemotherapy .
similar results were found in drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells .
therefore , we demonstrated that trpc5 is a negative regulator of drug - induced cell death in breast cancer cells .
cell death is one of the mechanisms by which chemotherapy destroys cancer cells .
augmented autophagy occurs in response to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells .
it is believed that autophagy blocks the accumulation of redundant or damaged components and facilitates the recycling of these components to sustain survival18 - 21 .
however , chemotherapeutic agents can decrease the autophagy in breast cancer cells40 .
in line with the reports of up - regulated autophagy with exposure to chemotherapy , we found that adm exposure increased lc3 - ii expression and lc3 puncta formation in breast cancer cells32 , 33 .
drug - resistant mcf - 7 / adm cells maintained a higher level of autophagy than mcf - 7 cells .
combined addition of cq or 3 - ma with adm decreased the recovery and viability of both sensitive or resistant breast cancer cells compared with adm alone , confirming that autophagy is mainly a cytoprotective process41 .
next , we explored the relationship between trpc5 and autophagy .
we found that knockdown of trpc5 expression reduced lc3 - ii levels and lc3 puncta formation in response to adm .
overexpression of trpc5 significantly increased lc3 - ii levels and lc3 puncta formation and facilitated futher resistance of breast cancer cells to adm .
in addition , we found that cancer cells transfected with trpc5 shrna lentiviral particles showed attenuated autophagy and tumor size with adm exposure .
moreover , we found significant positive correlations between trpc5 and autophagy in patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
therefore , trpc5 potentiates sensitivity to adm via the regulation of autophagy in breast cancer cells .
autophagosome formation is negatively regulated by mtor , which directly regulates ulk1 - atg13 - fip200 complex42 .
however , reports have also shown that the inhibition by mtor is not involved in the autophagy induced by lipopolysaccharide and eef2k ( eukaryotic elongation factor - 2 kinase ) silencing29 .
therefore , the function of mtor in autophagy may depend on the cell type and setting .
ampk functions as an antagonist of mtor , and is a key player in the stimulation of autophagy43 , 44 .
ampkalpha is phosphorylated and activated by camkkbeta in response to increased [ ca2 +] i 45 .
the regulation of ca2 + homeostasis by trpc5 in response to many physiological stimuli has been confirmed46 .
our previous data have also shown that drug - resistant cancer cells produce abundant p - glycoprotein via trpc5 - related ca2 + signaling15 .
moreover , ca2 + - mobilizing agents induce massive accumulation of autophagosomes in a beclin 1 - and atg7 - dependent manner47 .
in addition , camkkbeta occurs downstream from trpc534 .
therefore , to test whether the induction of autophagy by trpc5 under chemotherapy was depends on the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway , we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing on this pathway .
basal ca2 + was significantly elevated after adm exposure , and this was primarily regulated by trpc5 .
this finding suggested that trpc5 is mainly responsible for the increase in [ ca2 +] i. however , knockdown of trpc5 did not completely abolish the increase in [ ca2 +] i , suggesting trpc5 play a major role in adm - induced [ ca2 +] i raise .
other trp or store operated calcium channels may be partly involved in this process .
under hypoxia and nutrient depletion , trpc1 regulates autophagy to protect against cell death48 .
trpc4 is involved in regulation of autophagy by trans - 3,5,4 ' - trimethoxystilbene in endothelial cells49 .
future study is needed to further clarify this issue .
knockdown of trpc5 suppressed the activity of camkkbeta and ampkalpha , increased activity of mtor with adm exposure .
furthermore , bapta / am , sto - 609 , or silencing camkkbeta , and compound c , or silencing ampkalpha , inhibited the initiation of autophagy and enhanced cell death in response to adm .
in agreement with the previous findings that inhibition of mtor induces autophagy , our data showed that the autophagy induced by trpc5 is dependent on mtor inhibition in breast cancer cells undergoing chemotherapy .
here , our findings strongly support the idea that the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway is required for trpc5 - induced autophagy in response to chemotherapy .
in conclusion , our findings showed that trpc5 - induced autophagy counteracts the antiproliferative effects of adm via the camkkbeta / ampkalpha / mtor pathway in breast cancer cells ( fig. 7 ) .
trpc5 is positively correlated with autophagy in patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
our current findings reveal a novel role of trpc5 as an inducer of autophagy , and suggest a novel mechanism of drug resistance in chemotherapy for breast cancer .
figure 7 signaling connections involved in trpc5 - initiated autophagy pathways in response to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells .
chemotherapy up - regulates trpc5 expression and then increases the basal [ ca2 +] i. the increased [ ca2 +] i actives camkkbeta by phosphorylation , which in turn activates ampkalpha by phosphorylation .
activation of ampkalpha negatively regulates mtor by suppressing its phosphorylation , leading to autophagy .
autophagy induced by trpc5 during chemotherapy promotes the survival of human breast cancer cell .

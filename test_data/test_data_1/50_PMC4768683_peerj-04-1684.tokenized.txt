mouse dental mesenchymal cells ( mdmcs ) from tooth germs of cap or later stages are frequently used in the context of developmental biology or whole - tooth regeneration due to their odontogenic potential .
in vitro - expanded mdmcs serve as an alternative cell source considering the difficulty in obtaining primary mdmcs ; however , cultured mdmcs fail to support tooth development as a result of functional failures of specific genes or pathways .
the goal of this study was to identify the genes that maintain the odontogenic potential of mdmcs in culture. methods .
we examined the odontogenic potential of freshly isolated versus cultured mdmcs from the lower first molars of embryonic day 14.5 mice .
the transcriptome of mdmcs was detected using rna sequencing and the data were validated by qrt - pcr .
differential expression analysis and pathway analysis were conducted to identify the genes that contribute to the loss of odontogenic potential. results .
cultured mdmcs failed to develop into well - structured tooth when they were recombined with dental epithelium .
compared with freshly isolated mdmcs , we found that 1,004 genes were upregulated and 948 were downregulated in cultured mdmcs .
the differentially expressed genes were clustered in the biological processes and signaling pathways associated with tooth development .
following in vitro culture , genes encoding a wide array of components of mapk , tgf - beta / bmp , and wnt pathways were significantly downregulated .
moreover , the activities of bdnf , vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 were significantly inhibited in cultured mdmcs .
supplementation of vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 restored the expression of a subset of downregulated genes and induced mdmcs to form dentin - like structures in vivo. conclusions .
vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 play a role in the maintenance of odontogenic potential in mdmcs .

introduction in the field of tooth regeneration , the main concept is to mimic the natural tooth development process using stem cells .
cells or tissues with odontogenic potential are required to regenerate a whole tooth ( kollar & baird , 1970b ; mina & kollar , 1987 ) .
since the odontogenic potential to instruct tooth organogenesis shifts to the dental mesenchyme at bud stage of odontogenesis ( kollar & baird , 1970a ; mina & kollar , 1987 ) , and dental mesenchyme determines the tooth type and size ( kollar & baird , 1969 ) , it will be preferable to use a mesenchymal cell population with odontogenic potential to provide the inductive signal .
nevertheless , the adult dental stem / progenitor cells appear to lack the potency to regenerate an anatomically correct complete tooth organ ( hu et al. , 2014 ; mao & prockop , 2012 ) , and the odontogenic potential of progenitor cells derived from the embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells was unknown ( otsu et al. , 2012 ; ozeki et al. , 2013 ; seki et al. , 2015 ) .
mouse dental mesenchymal cells ( mdmcs ) isolated from dental mesenchyme of cap or later stages possess the odontogenic potential and they have frequently been used in the context of developmental biology or whole - tooth regeneration ( honda et al. , 2007 ; ikeda et al. , 2009 ; nakao et al. , 2007 ) .
mdmcs are able to induce tooth formation in a dental or nondental epithelial cell population ( kollar & baird , 1969 ; kollar & baird , 1970b ; wang et al. , 2010 ; angelova volponi , kawasaki & sharpe , 2013 ; cai et al. , 2013 ) .
as the preparation of mdmcs is time - consuming and embryos at the right stage are not easily available , in vitro - expanded mdmcs could be an available cell source .
however , mdmcs fail to support tooth development when they are grown as a monolayer ( keller et al. , 2011 ) , and the genes that contribute to the loss of odontogenic potential in mdmcs were unknown .
rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) technology provides sensitive detection of global gene expression profiles in cells and tissues , and bioinformatics approaches also examine changes in the context of the overall pathway rather than individual genes ( wang , gerstein & snyder , 2009 ) .
to identify the genes that maintain the odontogenic potential in mdmcs , we evaluated the odontogenic potential of freshly isolated versus cultured mdmcs from the lower first molars in embryonic day 14.5 ( e14.5 ) mice , and compared the transcriptome of freshly isolated mdmcs with that of cultured mdmcs .
we found a loss of odontogenic potential accompanied by a significant disturbed transcriptome in cultured mdmcs and identified potential genes that contribute to the loss of odontogenic potential , providing new insight into the maintenance of odontogenic potential of mdmcs .

odontogenic potential of cultured mouse dental mesenchymal cells mdmcs are typically cultured in eagle 's minimum essential medium plus fetal bovine serum and antibiotics ( jiang et al. , 2014 ; keller et al. , 2011 ; zhao et al. , 2014 ) .
mdmcs showed an atypical round - or spindle - shaped fibroblast - like morphology with a higher nuclear - to - cytoplasmic ratio , indicating their primitive character .
although the cells retained fibroblastic features up to the second passage , they exhibited a senescent phenotype with increased cytoplasm and augmented volume ( fig. 2a ) .

the odontogenic potential of p0 , p1 , and p2 cells were examined to identify the impact of the culturing .
although freshly isolated mdmcs developed into well - structured teeth when recombined with embryonic dental epithelium , cultured mdmcs failed to support tooth development ( fig. 2b ) .
moreover , the expression of genes that are essential for tooth development were analyzed using qrt - pcr .
the expression of msx1 , pax9 , and lhx6 was significantly reduced in p1 and p2 cells compared with p0 cells ( fig. 2c ) .
the expression of fgf3 and bmp2 in cultured mdmcs was reduced compared with the p0 cells , but the expression of bmp4 was not significantly different between the p0 cells and cultured mdmcs ( fig. 2d ) .
overview of the mouse dental mesenchymal cells' transcriptome to obtain a global view of genes regulating the loss of odontogenic potential , total mrna of p0 , p1 , and p2 cells was extracted and sequenced .
after data correction , 11,340 transcripts could be matched exactly to known mouse ensemble transcripts .
a total of 9,815 genes were shared among p0 , p1 and p2 cells , whereas 563 genes were expressed exclusively in p0 cells ( fig. 3a ) .
p0 cells that were not exposed to in vitro culture conditions showed a striking separation from p1 and p2 cells ( fig. 3b ; fig. s1 ) .
the transcriptional disparity between freshly isolated and cultured mdmcs is consistent with their phenotypic differences .
differential expression analysis revealed that in vitro expansion of mdmcs promoted the selective overexpression of 859 genes , whereas 763 genes were downregulated in p1 cells ( fig. 3c ) .
comparison of the transcriptomes of p0 and p2 cells revealed that 1,004 genes were upregulated and 948 were downregulated ( fig. 3c ) .
in contrast , 13 genes were upregulated and two genes were downregulated in p1 compared with p2 cells ( fig. 3c ) .
these results suggested that the transcriptome of mdmcs was significantly influenced by in vitro culture conditions .
in addition , the expression levels of msx1 , lhx6 , pax9 , bmp4 , fgf10 , bmp2 , and fgf3 were comparable when analyzed with rna - seq and qrt - pcr ( fig. 3d ) .

gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes gene ontology ( go ) analysis provides an intuitive and effective approach to understand the function of genes in three domains : biological processes , cellular components , and molecular functions .
to understand the function of differentially expressed genes , go analysis was conducted ( fig. s2 ) and a network diagram was created to illustrate the communication of differentially expressed genes in the enriched clusters of biological processes ( fig. 4 ) .
the network is composed of : ( a ) genes around the node dnmt3b , namely dnmt1 , ezh2 , uhrf1 , and rbl1 , which participate in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation ; ( b ) genes around the node runx2 , namely bmp2 , dlx1 , lhx6 , and sp7 , involved in cell differentiation and skeletal system development ; ( c ) genes around the node fn1 , namely robo4 , tie1 , pecam1 and col5a1 , involved in cell motion and cell adhesion ; and ( d ) genes that are not linked to any specific node , whose function is related to apoptosis ( tradd , tnfrsf11b ) and epithelial morphogenesis ( grem1 ) .
these various genes and their functions are expected because chromatin modification , cell motion , and cell adhesion are basic cellular functions involving the development of multiple organs .

a protein - protein interaction network was constructed .
degs in enriched go categories are represented in the network .
pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes multiple pathways including fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) , bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) , hedgehog ( shh ) , and wnt signaling play critical roles in odontogenesis ( liu et al. , 2013 ; thesleff , vaahtokari & partanen , 1995 ) ; thus , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway analysis was used to determine the pathways involving the differentially expressed genes ( fig. 5a ) .
not surprisingly , genes showing a threefold or greater change in expression were related to the pathways regulating basic cellular activities ( extracellular matrix - receptor interaction [ ko04512 ] , focal adhesion [ ko04510 ] , dna replication [ ko03030 ] , and p53 signaling pathway [ ko04115 ]) .
notably , essential pathways regulating tooth development were also enriched , including the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathway [ ko04010 ] , the transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) signaling pathway [ ko04350 ] , and the hedgehog signaling pathway [ ko04350 ] .
however , numerous members of these signaling pathways were reduced in cultured mdmcs ( fig. 5b ) , and it was difficult to identify the critical regulators that are responsible for the loss of odontogenic potential in cultured mdmcs .

( c ) the upstream regulators predicted by ingenuity pathway analysis .
an upstream analysis predicts which upstream regulators were most likely to be involved based on the current levels of gene expression detected by rna - seq analysis .
numerous upstream regulators were related to the loss of odontogenic potential in cultured mdmcs .
specifically , the activities of bdnf , vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 were predicted to be significantly inhibited , while igf2 , fgf10 , and tgfb1 were more active in cultured mdmcs ( fig. 5c ) .
although bdnf was slightly increased in cultured mdmcs , its receptor ntrk2 was significantly decreased ( fig. 5b ) .
the inhibition of bdnf led to the downregulation of genes that promote odontogenesis , such as egr1 , egr2 , and fos ( file s1 ) .
downregulation of bmp2 and bmp7 probably contributed to the loss of odontogenic potential via the inhibition of runx2 , sp7 , and msx2 ( file s1 ) .
vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 restore the expression of downregulated genes given the pivotal roles of vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 in tooth development , we selected these proteins to increase the expression of odontogenic genes .
indeed , tooth mesenchyme - specific genes were upregulated including msx1 and pax9 in mdmcs treated with bmp2 and bmp7 ( figs. 6b and 6c ) .
vegfalpha slightly increased the expression of msx1 and pax9 , but not that of lhx6 ( fig. 6a ) .
in parallel , vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 were adopted to maintain the odontogenic potential of mdmcs .
although well - structured tooth was not observed , dentin - like structures were present ( fig. 6d ) .
together , vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 promoted the expression of dental mesenchyme - specific genes and the formation of dentin - like structures .

discussion numerous signaling factors in dental epithelium and / or mesenchyme interact with each other to regulate odontogenesis and induce the expression of dental mesenchyme - specific transcription factors during tooth development ( thesleff , vaahtokari & partanen , 1995 ) .
in the present study , we found that cultured mdmcs lost the odontogenic potential and failed to initiate tooth formation .
consistently , the dental mesenchyme - specific transcription factors ( msx1 , pax9 , and lhx6 ) were decreased in cultured mdmcs , and the mutation of these transcription factors was shown to cause tooth agenesis disorders ( peters et al. , 1998 ; satokata & maas , 1994 ; zhao et al. , 2013 ) .
the loss of odontogenic potential and decreased expression of dental mesenchyme - specific genes may be due to the absence of inductive signals from the dental epithelium or mesenchyme .
since bmp and fgf signaling pathways mediate the odontogenic inductive signals of dental mesenchyme ( liu et al. , 2013 ; thesleff , vaahtokari & partanen , 1995 ) , the expression of representative components within these two signaling families was analyzed in mdmcs .
the expression of bmp4 shifts from dental epithelium to mesenchyme , which is concomitant with the shift of instructive potential during tooth development ( vainio et al. , 1993 ) , but the expression of bmp4 in the present study was not significantly changed when mdmcs were cultured in vitro .
this suggests that bmp4 in cultured mdmcs is not sufficient to substitute for the odontogenic potential and that other factors besides bmp4 are responsible for the inductive potential .
similarly , although fgf10 stimulates cell proliferation in the dental epithelium during tooth morphogenesis ( kettunen et al. , 2000 ) , the mrna level of fgf10 was comparable between freshly - isolated and cultured mdmcs .
in contrast , the expression of fgf3 and bmp2 in cultured mdmcs was significantly reduced .
fgf3 regulates the number , position , and interrelation of cusps in molar teeth ; mutation of the fgf3 gene leads to dosage - dependent morphological changes in teeth of both mice and human patients ( charles et al. , 2009 ) .
bmp2 is essential for the differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts ( guo et al. , 2015 ; yang et al. , 2012 ) .
thus , the downregulation of these genes may account for the loss of odontogenic potential in cultured mdmcs .
however , bmp2 was expressed at a relatively low level in e14.5 mdmcs , and fgf3 knockout mice do not exhibit any overt defects in teeth ( mansour , goddard & capecchi , 1993 ) , raising the possibility that the loss of odontogenic potential in cultured mdmcs may also involve other genes .
transcriptome analysis , as conducted in this work , has provided insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of odontogenic potential .
the transcriptomic profiles reflected the potential of mdmcs , and the mdmcs without odontogenic potential were strikingly separated from those with odontogenic potential .
moreover , the activities of bdnf , vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 were predicted to be inhibited .
these growth factors were reported to be involved in tooth development .
bdnf and its receptor ntrk2 are involved in the mapk pathway and play roles in epithelial - mesenchymal interactions in early tooth morphogenetic events ( nosrat et al. , 1997 ) .
vegfalpha is an important factor that induces angiogenesis and related with the mapk signaling pathway .
it is expressed in inner enamel epithelial cells and the basement membrane ( aida et al. , 2005 ; miwa et al. , 2007 ) , indicating a potential role in the epithelial - mesenchymal interactions .
bmp2 promotes the maturation of odontoblasts and bmp2 conditional knockout mice display abnormal tooth phenotypes with a hypomineralization enamel layer , delayed odontoblast differentiation , abnormal dentin tubules , and decreased tooth - related gene expression ( guo et al. , 2015 ; yang et al. , 2012 ) .
bmp7 is also essential for tooth development and its level in the fetal dental mesenchymal cells is higher compared with that in the adult dental pulp cells , representing a potential mediator of the inductive odontogenic potential of dental mesenchyme ( gao et al. , 2015 ) .
consistently , we found that vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 increased the expression of dental mesenchyme - specific genes .
even though the supplementation with these growth factors did not restore the odontogenic potential of mdmcs , dentin - like structures formed instead of amorphous matrix , suggesting their potential roles in the maintenance of odontogenic potential .
recently , immortalized fetal dental mesenchymal cell lines were established ( huang et al. , 2015 ; wu et al. , 2015 ) , and a medium supplemented with upstream signaling molecules such as vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 may preserve the biological properties of mdmcs .
although the effects of igf2 , fgf10 , and tgfb1 were predicted to be enhanced in cultured mdmcs , they are well - known mesenchymal signals that mediate epithelial - mesenchymal interactions during tooth development ( matsumoto et al. , 2011 ; nakao et al. , 2013 ; vaahtokari , vainio & thesleff , 1991 ) .
interestingly , the level of igf2 in dental mesenchyme decreased over time during development because of the hypermethylation of cpg islands ( khan et al. , 2012 ) ; this suggests that the inhibition of igf2 activity is required for normal tooth development .
however , further studies are still needed to investigate whether the overactivation of these factors leads to abnormal phenotype of teeth , and whether inhibitors of these factors play a role in the maintenance of odontogenic potential .
in the present study , supplementation with vegf , bmp2 , and bmp7 did not completely restored the odontogenic potential of mdmcs .
however , the go analysis also provided a clue for the establishment of culture system for mdmcs .
go analysis showed that multiple biological processes involving the development of multiple organs were dysregulated when mdmcs were cultured in vitro .
specifically , chromatin modifier enzymes play essential roles in the establishment of transcriptional programs accompanying cell differentiation during tooth development ( brook , 2009 ) .
mesenchymal cell migration and compaction are required to induce the expression of critical odontogenic genes and the differentiation of odontoblasts ( hu , parker & wright , 2015 ; mammoto et al. , 2011 ) .
the dysregulation of cell motion also contributed to the compromised potential in cultured mdmcs .
since both the mandible and teeth are mineralized tissue derived from the neural crest ( chai et al. , 2000 ) , multiple genes acting in skeletal system development have been identified as affecting the odontogenic signaling cascades ( komori , 2006 ; nakashima et al. , 2002 ) .
thus , growth factors or cytokines that related with transcriptional regulation , cell differentiation or mineralization , and cell motion may facilitate the maintenance of odontogenic potential .
in conclusion , we assessed the odontogenic potential of in vitro - expanded mdmcs and conducted an analysis of their transcriptome profiles .
the results revealed that the transition to an in vitro setting induced the loss of odontogenic potential and a significant modulation of the overall transcriptome .
genes encoding a wide array of components of mapk , tgf - beta / bmp , and wnt pathways were significantly downregulated in cultured cells .
our results also indicated that inhibited activities of vegfalpha , bmp2 , and bmp7 contributed to the loss of odontogenic potential and supplementation with these growth factors played roles in the maintenance of odontogenic potential in mdmcs .

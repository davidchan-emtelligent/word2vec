as many as 50 % of adults with type i ( t1 ) diabetes exhibit bone loss and are at increased risk for fractures .
therapeutic development to prevent bone loss and / or restore lost bone in t1 diabetic patients requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms accounting for the bone pathology .
because cell culture models alone cannot fully address the systemic / metabolic complexity of t1 diabetes , animal models are critical .
a variety of models exist including spontaneous and pharmacologically induced t1 diabetic rodents .
in this paper , we discuss the streptozotocin ( stz ) - induced t1 diabetic mouse model and examine dose - dependent effects on disease severity and bone .
five daily injections of either 40 or 60 mg / kg stz induce bone pathologies similar to spontaneously diabetic mouse and rat models and to human t1 diabetic bone pathology .
specifically , bone volume , mineral apposition rate , and osteocalcin serum and tibia messenger rna levels are decreased .
in contrast , bone marrow adiposity and ap2 expression are increased with either dose .
however , high - dose stz caused a more rapid elevation of blood glucose levels and a greater magnitude of change in body mass , fat pad mass , and bone gene expression ( osteocalcin , ap2 ) .
an increase in cathepsin k and in the ratio of rankl / opg was noted in high - dose stz mice , suggesting the possibility that severe diabetes could increase osteoclast activity , something not seen with lower doses .
this may contribute to some of the disparity between existing studies regarding the role of osteoclasts in diabetic bone pathology .
examination of kidney and liver toxicity indicate that the high stz dose causes some liver inflammation .
in summary , the multiple low - dose stz mouse model exhibits a similar bone phenotype to spontaneous models , has low toxicity , and serves as a useful tool for examining mechanisms of t1 diabetic bone loss .
streptozotocin diabetes mellitus type i bone mice osteocalcin adipocytes osteoporosis 1 .
introduction type i ( t1 ) diabetes is associated with many complications including bone loss [ 1 - 12 ] .
approaches to understand the mechanisms accounting for t1 diabetic bone pathology include cell culture models , human clinical studies , and animal models .
cell culture models allow examination of effects of individual factors , such as hyperglycemia , on cell parameters such as signaling , responsiveness , and differentiation .
however , tissue pathology is often caused by a combination of factors that are produced by more than one cell type .
clinical studies allow examination of systemic and tissue effects , but are limiting in the types of analyses that can be done .
animal models are a compromise between clinical and in vitro studies .
they can be genetically manipulated , their diet / environment can be controlled , and a multitude of analyses can be performed on them , making animal models powerful tools to understand mechanisms of tissue pathology , provided that tissue responses are similar to what is seen clinically .
a variety of t1 diabetic rodent models exist .
some mouse models become spontaneously diabetic , such as the non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice , while other t1 diabetic models are pharmacologically induced by compounds such as alloxan , streptozotocin ( stz ) , vacor , dithizone , and 8 - hydroxyquinone ( reviewed in [ 13 ]) .
the streptozotocin - induced diabetes model has been extensively used , making it particularly useful for building upon and comparing results of other studies .
stz is a nitrosurea compound derived from streptomyces achromogenes , which has also been used as an antibiotic and a cancer treatment .
it enters pancreatic beta cells through glucose transporter 2 ( glut2 ) channels in the plasma membrane and causes cellular toxicity and local immune responses that lead to hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in animals [ 14 ] .
in some models , especially rats , a single dose of stz is effective at inducing t1 diabetes .
in mice , however , multiple low doses ( 40 mg / kg ) are the most effective at maintaining mouse viability and inducing pancreatic dysfunction in part through immune destruction .
this response is similar to what is seen during the onset of t1 diabetes in humans [ 14 ] , although lymphocytes are not required for stz induction of diabetes [ 15 ] .
the benefits of the stz - induced diabetic mouse model include that it allows one to induce diabetes in genetically altered mice , maintain mice in a controlled environment , regularly monitor and directly measure serum and bone factors , obtain bone samples for high - resolution analyses , and chose the time of diabetic induction ( compared to waiting for the diabetes to occur in spontaneous models ) .
examination of bones from stz - induced diabetic mice demonstrates a significant decrease in bone volume fraction marked by decreased levels of markers of osteoblast maturation and increased levels of markers of adipogenesis [ 16 ] .
however , to confirm that this model is appropriate to study t1 diabetic bone pathology , it is important to prove that the stz - injected mice exhibit a bone phenotype similar to spontaneously t1 diabetic mice and , most importantly , similar to t1 diabetic humans .
indeed , low multiple low - dose stz induction of diabetes causes a bone phenotype consistent with human studies [ 1 - 12 ] and spontaneous mouse models such as nod mice [ 17 ] , confirming the utility of the stz model for studying mechanisms of t1 - diabetes - induced bone loss .
while stz - induced diabetes produces consistent bone pathologies ( i.e. , decreased bone density , increased marrow adiposity ) , we have found that the magnitude of effects can vary ( being greater in some experiments compared to others ) .
we hypothesized that this difference may be related to the activity / strength of the stz that we inject .
manufacturer ( sigma ) data sheets indicate that stz is stable for approximately 2 years if frozen ( - 20degreesc ) and protected from the light .
in solution , stz is stable around a ph of 4 and therefore is prepared in cold citrate buffer at a ph of 4.5 to enhance stability .
if not used fresh , stz solutions can exhibit reduced ability to induce diabetes .
in this study , we examined the role of stz concentration ( 40 or 60 mg / kg ) in multiple dose induction of diabetes , disease severity , and bone loss .
both doses caused a similar level of bone loss , but the higher dose of stz caused a more rapid elevation of blood glucose levels , greater magnitude of change in body mass , fat pad mass , and bone gene expression ( osteocalcin , ap2 ) .
while markers of kidney function appeared normal in all conditions , liver inflammation was detected in the high - stz - dosed mice .
an increase in bone cathepsin k and in the rankl / osteoprotegrin ( opg ) ratio was noted only in the high - dose group , suggesting that increased diabetes severity may lead to increased osteoclast activity .
this may explain some of the disparity between existing studies regarding the role of osteoclasts in diabetic bone pathology .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
stz induction of diabetes male balb / c mice ( harlan laboratories , houston , tx , usa ) , 10 weeks old , were given daily intraperitoneal injections with stz ( 40 or 60 mug / g body weight in 0.1 m citrate buffer ) for 5 days to induce diabetes [ 14,18 ] .
control mice were injected with buffer alone .
blood glucose levels were examined 7 days after the final streptozotocin injection by obtaining blood from the lateral saphenous vein and measuring glucose concentration with a glucometer ( accu - check instant , boehringer mannheim corporation , indianapolis , in , usa ) .
mice with blood glucose levels greater than 300 mg / dl were considered diabetic .
at the time of harvest , 19 days after the first streptozotocin injection , blood glucose measurements were again obtained along with total body , tibialis anterior , and subcutaneous femoral fat pad mass .
animal studies were conducted in accordance with the michigan state university institutional animal care and use committee .

serum blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) , creatinine , and 25 - hydroxyvitamin d were measured at the diagnostic center for population and animal health ( dcpah ) at michigan state university .
because of volume requirements for assays at dcpah , serum samples had to be pooled .
for bun and creatinine , two samples were submitted for control and 40 - mg / kg dose and one sample was submitted for the 60 - mg / kg dose ( each submitted sample contained serum from five different mice ) .
for 25 - hydroxyvitamin d , three samples were submitted for control , 40 mg / kg , and 60 mg / kg groups ( each submitted sample contained serum from one to four mice ) .

mineral apposition rate mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 mul of 10 mg / ml calcein ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) dissolved in saline 7 and 2 days before harvest .
l3 vertebrae were fixed in formalin at time of harvest then transferred to 70 % ethanol after 24 h. vertebrae were then embedded and sectioned at 5 mum on a reichert jung 2030 rotary microtome .
sections were photographed under fluorescent light and the distance between lines of calcein was measured .
2.4 .
micro - computed tomography analyses fixed bones were scanned with a calibration standard using a ge explore locus micro - computed tomography system at a voxel resolution of 20 mum .
a threshold of 1,400 was used to separate bone from bone marrow .
trabecular bone analyses were made in a region of trabecular bone defined at 0.17 mm under the growth plate of the tibia extending 2 mm toward the diaphysis and excluding the outer cortical shell .
bone parameters were computed by a ge healthcare microview software application for visualization and analysis of volumetric image data .

3. results and discussion 3.1 .
stz injection ( 40 and 60 mg / kg ) effectively induces type i diabetes in balb / c mice to test the effect of stz dose on bone pathology , we injected 10 - week - old male balb / c mice with either 40 or 60 mg of stz per kilogram body weight for 5 days .
control mice were injected with vehicle ( citrate buffer ) to control for the influence of any injection stress or buffer - induced effects on the animals .
monitoring of food intake throughout the study indicated a decrease only the day after the first stz injection by 27 % in the mice treated with 40 mg / kg and by 57 % in the mice treated with 60 mg / kg streptozotocin ( figure 1 ) .
there were no significant changes at any other time point , although at later time points , food intake began to increase in the stz - injected mice consistent with diabetic hyperphagia .
still , the both high - and low - dose stz - treated mice lost weight , with the high dose group tending to lose more than the low - dose group ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 mice exhibit decreased food intake following the first stz injection and lose weight despite becoming hyperphagic at later time points .
top panel , twenty - four - hour food intake ( monitored throughout the experiment ) is shown at 1 , 11 , and 18 days post - injection ( dpi ) for control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , or 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) .
only intake at 1 dpi was significantly decreased .
bottom panel , mouse body mass was examined throughout the experiment for control ( white circles ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( black square ) , or 60 mg / kg stz mice ( black triangle ) .
all values represent averages +/ - se. n > 3 per condition ; * p < 0.05 compared to control .
in our standard protocol , elevated blood glucose levels (> 300 mg / dl ) observed at 12 days post - injection ( dpi ) are used to confirm diabetes in mice , while control mice exhibit blood glucose levels less than 200 mg / dl ( not shown ) .
in addition , we measured blood glucose levels at 4 and 19 dpi .
figure 2 demonstrates that at 19 dpi , both low and high stz mice averaged blood glucose levels at or above 500 mg / dl , whereas control mice maintained normal non - fasting blood glucose levels less than 200 mg / dl. in contrast , at 4 dpi , only high - dose stz mice exhibited significantly elevated blood glucose levels compared to controls .
this suggests that the high - dose treatment induces a more rapid loss of insulin secretion ( and therefore more rapid onset of diabetes ) compared to low - dose treatment .
past studies indicate that the magnitude of stz induction of serum glucose , urine volume , and glucosuria can , to some extent , correlate with dose concentration [ 25 - 27 ] .
along these lines , the effect of stz on pancreatic beta cells has been shown to be dose - dependent by in vitro [ 28 ] and in vivo [ 26 ] studies .
in the latter study , a greater number of pancreatic beta cells were shown to remain in mice after injection with multiple low doses of stz ( 40 mg / kg for 5 days ) compared to a single high - dose ( 200 mg / kg stz ) injection .
figure 2 high - dose stz treatment causes a greater increase in blood glucose levels at early but not late time points compared to low dose stz .
shown are mouse blood glucose levels measured at 4 and 19 days post - injection ( dpi ) for control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , or 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) .
values represent the average +/ - se. n > 3 per condition .
* p < 0.05 compared to control .
another indicator of the severity of diabetogenic and catabolic effects are changes in mouse body parameters ( body , muscle , and fat pad mass ) , which were significantly decreased in both stz - dosed groups compared to controls ( figure 3 ) as previously reported for stz and spontaneously diabetic mice [ 17 ] .
we also observed a decrease in liver weight that was only apparent in high - dose stz mice and likely the result of reduced glycogen content .
the high stz dose also caused a significantly greater decrease in body and fat pad mass compared to the low stz dose ( figure 3 ) .
similarly , van dam et al .
[ 29 ] and howarth et al .
[ 27 ] demonstrated a stz dose - dependent decrease in rat body weight .
the loss of fat pad mass that we observe is also consistent with reports demonstrating that high doses of stz can directly cause adipocyte lipolysis [ 30 ] .
the increased lipolysis can contribute to the modest but significant decrease in body weight compared to low - dose stz - treated mice .
figure 3 body , muscle and fat pad mass decreases with both low and high dose stz treatment .
body , muscle ( tibialis anterior ) , liver , and fat pad ( subcutaneous femoral fat ) weights were measured at 19 dpi for control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , or 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) .
values represent the average +/ - se. n > 3 per condition .
* p < 0.05 compared to control ; deltap < 0.05 compared to 40 - mg / kg stz dose .
next , we examined stz dose effects on the skeleton .
bone density analyses at 19 dpi demonstrated , as expected , that stz - treated mice lose tibial trabecular bone volume fraction ( bvf ) compared to control mice ( figure 4 , images and graph ) .
this is consistent with previous reports in pharmacologically induced and spontaneously diabetic mice and rats and is consistent with t1 diabetic human studies [ 2 - 4,12,16,17,31 - 50 ] .
interestingly , bone loss ( in contrast to body and fat mass , figure 3 ) was not dependent upon stz dose as demonstrated by similar bvf between the low and high stz groups .
our previous studies , in mice at 16 - 20 weeks of age , also demonstrate significant bone loss .
because the mice in the current study were 10 weeks old and can still exhibit skeletal growth ( albeit at a slower rate than younger mice ) , we also examined bone length .
no changes in tibial length were observed ( figure 4 ) , suggesting that t1 diabetes did not alter bone growth in these mice .
figure 4 bone loss is evident in diabetes induced by both low - and high - dose stz .
the two - dimensional images at the top were obtained from micro - computed tomography analyses of representative tibias from control and stz - treated mice ( 40 days post first injection ) .
three dimensional images were composed of 760 consecutive slices .
the bar graphs indicate the measured bone volume fraction ( average +/ - se ) of the tibial trabecular region and the tibia lengths of control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , or 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) .
n > 3 per condition .
* p < 0.05 compared to control .
previously , we demonstrated that low - dose stz suppresses osteoblast markers and activity , so we examined the influence of stz dose / diabetes severity on this effect .
first , we measured mineralization apposition rate .
figure 5 demonstrates that this functional measure of osteoblast activity ( bone formation ) is decreased in both low and high stz dose diabetic mice .
consistent with this finding , serum osteocalcin levels were decreased in stz mice , but to a much greater extent in high - versus low - dose mice .
to further assess effects on osteoblasts , rna analyses were done to examine gene expression , which we have found to be an even more sensitive marker for determining early responses in bone .
as shown in figure 5 , osteocalcin ( oc ) messenger rna ( mrna ) levels , a marker of mature osteoblasts , are significantly decreased in whole tibias of t1 diabetic mice compared to controls .
high - dose stz caused a further tenfold reduction in oc rna levels compared to low - dose stz - treated mice , suggesting a relationship to disease severity .
the suppression of osteocalcin expression at the mrna and / or protein ( serum ) level has been seen previously in stz and spontaneously diabetic mouse and diabetic rat models [ 17,33,36,39,46,49 ] .
however , to our knowledge , this has not been shown to be stz dose / disease severity dependent .
previously , we demonstrated a positive correlation between changes in oc mrna levels and osteoblast activity ( bone density ) [ 16,17,37,51 ] .
however , despite a large difference in oc mrna levels ( figure 5 ) , we did not observe a significant difference in bvf between the two doses of stz ( figure 4 ) .
we suspect that the differences in oc mrna between low and high stz dose will continue to impact bvf at later time points since there would be a delay between changes in osteoblast activity and actual bvf changes .
these rna findings suggest the utility of gene expression studies in bone as early indicators of later changes in function .
figure 5 stz - induced t1 - diabetes decreases mar , serum osteocalcin , and bone osteocalcin mrna while increasing ap2 expression .
control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , and 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) were examined at 19 dpi for osteoblast parameters : mineral apposition rate ( mar ; representative fluorescent images of calcein labeling of bone shown at top of figure ) , serum osteocalcin ( oc ) , and tibial osteocalcin mrna levels [ expressed relative to hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( hprt ) , a housekeeping gene ) .
expression of a mature adipocyte marker , ap2 , was also examined .
for all rna analyses , expression was expressed relative to control levels which were set to 1 .
values represent the average +/ - se. n > 3 per condition , except for high stz dose mar ( n = 1 ) .
* p < 0.05 compared to control ; deltap < 0.05 compared to 40 - mg / kg stz dose .
t1 diabetic bone loss is associated with increased marrow adiposity .
therefore , we examined the mrna levels of a marker for mature adipocytes , adipocyte binding protein 2 ( ap2 , also known as fatty acid binding protein - 4 ) , which correlates with the extent of bone marrow adiposity [ 16,17,37,51 ] .
similar to previous reports in stz - induced diabetic mice and spontaneously diabetic mice [ 16,17,37,51 ] , either dose of stz increased ap2 expression in bone , but the magnitude of this increase was significantly greater in mice treated with the higher dose of stz ( figure 5 ) .
table 1 demonstrates the similarity of stz effects on bone to those of a spontaneous t1 - diabetic mouse model , nod mice .
all diabetic mice ( spontaneous , stz low dose , stz high dose ) exhibit significant bone loss , decreased osteocalcin expression , and increased ap2 compared to experimental non - diabetic control mice .
however , there were differences in the magnitude of changes .
in this study , we examined stz - treated mice at 19 dpi , whereas in our past study in nod mice , we examined mice at 40 dpi [ 17 ] .
the latter study included the multiple low - stz - dose model which demonstrated a 50 % suppression in bvf at 40 dpi corresponding with changes in nod mice .
thus , bone loss at 40 dpi is greater than at 19 dpi. with regard to rna , osteocalcin exhibited a 55 % decrease in low - stz - dose mice , a 70 % decrease in diabetic nod mice , and a 94 % decrease in high - stz - dose mice compared to controls .
the latter large suppression in osteocalcin expression has not been previously observed .
ap2 expression was increased in all models , but high - stz - dose mice exhibited less than half the levels seen in nod mice , and low stz dose exhibited even less elevation than high dose .
we have previously observed some variability in the magnitude of ap2 induction in the low - stz mice , suggesting that multiple factors , including hyperlipidemia , inflammation , age ( we examined 13 weeks mice compared to greater than 24 weeks nod mice ) , that can differ between experiments may contribute to the magnitude of adiposity in diabetic bone .
still , despite all these differences , both spontaneous and stz - induced mouse models lose bone , have decreased osteoblast function and marrow adiposity .

differences were all statistically significant ( compared to controls ) next we examined dose / severity effects on markers of osteoclast maturation and activity .
levels of serum active trap5b , a marker of active osteoclasts , were decreased in both stz doses ( figure 6 ) , consistent with previous studies suggesting that resorption is not increased in t1 diabetic humans and rodent models [ 2,16,33,40,43,45,51 - 63 ] .
we measured serum osteoclast markers rather than urine markers because diabetes is associated with polyuria ( which can confound measurements due to large differences in urine volume between control and diabetic mice ) and can potentially result in nephropathy which could affect urine levels of measured factors .
we also examined the expression levels of osteoclast markers in whole bone rna .
figure 6 demonstrates that trap5 mrna levels did not differ between conditions , although it showed a trend to decrease in high - stz - treated mice .
differences between rna and serum levels may result from differences between rna and protein stability and between local and systemic measures ( the later would be the sum of changes in all bones which could result in significant differences ) .
interestingly , we found that cathepsin k , a protease found in lysosomes and active in osteoclast bone resorption , was significantly increased in high - dose stz mice only .
similarly , the rankl to opg ratio is also increased in high - stz mice , supporting that under high dose / severity , a local environment may exist that could promote resorption .
the fact that serum trap5b levels are not elevated suggests that under these conditions , osteoclasts are not able to be fully activated .
this may stem from additional factors in t1 diabetes , such as high glucose and advanced glycosylation end products , suppressing osteoclast activation [ 64,65 ] .
there are some studies that support an increase in osteoclast activity in diabetic rodent models [ 66,67 ] .
our data suggest that differences in resorptive markers measured and in disease severity could contribute to differences seen between studies ( in addition to species , gender , and age differences ) .
figure 6 t1 - diabetes decreases serum trap5b , while high - dose stz increases cathepsin k and rankl / opg ratio .
control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , and 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) were examined at 19 dpi for osteoclast markers and activity : serum trap5b , trap5 rna , cathepsin k rna , and rankl / opg rna ratio .
rna levels were expressed relative to hprt .
rna values represent the average +/ - se and are expressed relative to control mice ( set to 1 ) .
* p < 0.05 compared to control .
deltap < 0.05 compared to 40 - mg / kg stz dose .
the exact mechanisms accounting for differences in the magnitude of low - versus high - stz dose effects are not fully known , but our data indicate that there are differences in disease onset ( based on earlier blood glucose elevation in high dose mice ) and metabolic / catabolic effects ( a greater loss of body and fat pad mass in high - dose mice ) between the two dosing regimes .
the greater loss of fat pad mass in high - dose stz mice is not only a disease severity issue .
fat pad loss could cause a proportional decrease in serum adipokine levels such as leptin , as previously demonstrated in low - stz - dose mice [ 37,68 ] .
in addition , greater loss of fat pad mass could lead to a greater increase in serum fatty acids which could in turn stimulate ppargamma2 and induce adipocyte maturation in the bone marrow at the expense of osteoblast maturation .
this possibility is supported by a study where 55 or 100 mg / kg stz or alloxan was administered to rats and it was found that only the high dose of either drug caused increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol [ 69 ] .
it is possible that high doses of stz are in general more toxic to the mice .
in monkeys , a high dose ( 100 mg / kg ) of stz was found to elevate kidney and liver function tests , whereas low - dose ( 55 mg / kg ) stz - treated animals had normal kidney and liver function tests [ 70 ] .
both doses effectively induced diabetes , but the low dose did not appear to exhibit toxic effects .
chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) is a common complication of diabetes and can also lead to decreased osteoblast and osteoclast function [ 71 ] .
patients and animal models with ckd and nephrotoxicity have increased bun , creatinine , and low vitamin d [ 71,72 ] .
therefore , we measured 25 - hydroxy - vitamin d , bun , and creatinine levels in the control , low - , and high - stz - dosed mice .
there were no differences between groups , suggesting that at the stz doses we used , kidney damage is not apparent and therefore does not contribute to the bone phenotype we observed in low - or high - dose stz models ( figure 7 ) .
we also examined liver cytokine expression , which can be a sign of liver toxicity [ 73 ] , and found that only high stz dose treatment caused a significant increase in il - 6 and a trend to increase for il - 1beta ( figure 7 ) .
the potential of liver toxicity is consistent with reduced liver mass ( figure 3 ) seen only in high - stz - dosed mice .
figure 7 both low and high stz dose does not influence kidney function , but high dose is associated with liver inflammation .
control ( white bar ) , 40 mg / kg stz ( low dose , gray bar ) , and 60 mg / kg stz mice ( high dose , black bar ) were examined at 19 dpi for markers of kidney function ( 25 - oh vitamin d , bun , and creatinine serum levels ) and liver toxicity ( il - 1beta and il - 6 rna levels ) .
for serum analyses , samples were pooled to meet the quantities necessary for measurement .
for 25 - hydroxyvitamin d : three samples were analyzed per condition ( each sample contained serum pooled from one to four individual mice ) .
bun and creatinine analyses were done on one ( high dose ) or two ( control and low dose ) blood samples , each containing serum pooled from five individual mice .
il - 6 and c / ebpbeta rna levels were expressed relative to hprt .
serum values represent mean +/ - sd. rna values represent the average +/ - se and are expressed relative to control mice ( set to 1 ) .
* p < 0.05 compared to control ; deltap < 0.05 compared to 40 - mg / kg stz dose .
taken together , this report demonstrates that multiple low - dose stz - induced t1 diabetic mice exhibit ( 1 ) a decrease in body , muscle , and fat pad mass , ( 2 ) decreased bone volume , ( 3 ) decreased osteoblast markers and function , ( 4 ) increased marrow adiposity , ( 5 ) a similar bone phenotype to spontaneous mouse models , ( 6 ) decreased serum active trap5b , and ( 7 ) no change in kidney and liver function markers .
more importantly , bone loss and decreased osteocalcin protein are also observed in t1 diabetic patients [ 2 - 4,12,16,17,31 - 50 ] .
high - dose stz mice exhibit more catabolic effects on body parameters , suggesting increased disease severity ( and secondary effects such as liver inflammation ) .
this may play a role in the elevation of some osteoclast parameters ( which are not increased in the low dose model ) .
while both doses cause bone loss , it is important to correctly choose the dosing regime to be used to obtain consistent results .
dose response differences may contribute to differences in the literature and can be capitalized upon and used as a tool to provide insight into mechanisms regulating changes in bone that are dependent upon disease severity .
appendix protocols streptozotocin injections 1 .
make 0.1 m citrate buffer ph 4.5 .
for 100 ml , combine 1.05 g citric acid and 1.48 g sodium citrate in dh20 .
ensure ph is 4.5 , then bring up to 100 ml with water .
2. determine weight of the mice and calculate mass of streptozotocin ( sigma s0130 ) needed for injections of 100 ml per mouse .
3. quickly weigh streptozotocin , dissolve in cold citrate buffer , and filter sterilize through a 22 - mum pore filter .
4. immediately draw into a 1.0 - ml syringe and inject intraperitoneally into mouse .
speed is imperative because streptozotocin degrades rapidly once dissolved .
5. repeat everyday for 5 days total .
6. maintain a mouse health score sheet ( monitoring body weight , polyurea , signs of stress , eating habits ) regularly throughout the course of the study .
7. seven days after the final injection , check fed blood glucose of the animal .
determination of blood glucose 1 .
hold the mouse firmly by the skin of the back / neck .
2. shave the inner thigh of one of the hind legs .
3. put a small amount of petroleum jelly on the shaved area to help visualize the saphenous vein .
4. prick the saphenous vein with a 25 - gauge needle .
a small drop of blood should form .
5. measure the blood glucose with an accuchek compact glucometer ( roche ) .
6. if the blood glucose is greater than 300 mg / dl , the mice are diabetic .
this day is then often considered day 0 .
7. hold clean gauze over the site of the blood draw until bleeding has stopped .
tissue isolation 1 .
wait until the desired duration of diabetes has passed and euthanize the mice by an approved method .
2. measure blood glucose immediately after euthanasia if desired or collect serum for a glucose assay .
3. remove desired organs and bones .
4. quickly clean bones for rna or protein extraction of all surrounding muscle and connective tissue and freeze in liquid nitrogen .
5. fix bones for micro - computed tomography analyses in formalin .
transfer to 70 % etoh after 24 h. rna extraction from tibia 1 .
crush tibia in a bessman tissue pulverizer under liquid nitrogen conditions .
2. put crushed bone into a 2.0 ml flat bottom microcentrifuge tube .
3. add 1.0 ml tri reagent solution ( molecular research center , inc. ) .
4. immediately homogenize and place on ice ( omni international th homogenizer , marietta , ga , usa ) .
5. continue with rna extraction according to tri reagent protocol .
6. make cdna with 2.0 mg rna , superscript ii reverse transcriptase kit , and oligo dt ( 12 - 18 ) primers ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
7. amplify 1.0 mul cdna to a final volume of 25 ml by pcr with iq sybr green supermix ( bio - rad ) and 10 pmol of desired primer .

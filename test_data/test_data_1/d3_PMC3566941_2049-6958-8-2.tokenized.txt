renal metastasis from non - small cell lung cancer is rather uncommon .
the mechanism underlying the occurrence of metastasis in this site is still not well understood .
we report a case of a 53 - year - old chinese woman who had moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .
after a ten months post - surgery interval of disease free survival , computed tomography ( ct ) scan found that left renal parenchymal was occupied by a mass , confirmed by kidney biopsy to be a metastasis from squamous cell lung carcinoma .
based on this case , we are warned to be cautious in diagnosis and treatment when renal lesion are detected .
hematuria isolated unilateral renal metastases lung squamous cell carcinoma renal metastasis background the morbidity and mortality of lung cancer tend to increase at present , and its mortality rate is the highest among all types of cancer in china [ 1 ] .
although a great progress has been made in the treatments of this tumor , especially in non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , the 5 years survival rate of nsclc is still lower than 15 % [ 2 ] .
more than 1 / 3 of nsclc patients are diagnosed with distant metastasis , which is mainly due to difficulties in early detection .
local symptoms caused by primary tumors and complications due to distant metastases of nsclc are major factors endangering patients' lives .
the most common site of metastasis via the hematogenous route is brain , followed by bone , liver , adrenal gland , and lung .
however , metastasis of renal parenchymal is rather uncommon .
here we describe a case of lung carcinoma causing isolated unilateral renal metastases .
case presentation a 53 - year - old chinese woman presented symptoms of cough , bloody sputum at the first visit .
one month later , enhanced chest ct scan showed a peripheral mass 5 cm in the greatest size in the left upper lung , without obvious enlargement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes .
subsequent whole body ct scan showed no distant metastasis in brain , liver and kidney .
then she had left upper lobectomy and chest lymph nodes exploration .
post - operation pathologic examination revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma , with one metastatic lymph node in the fifth station , and two metastatic lymph nodes in the lung hilum ( pt2n2m0 ) .
the immunohistochemical staining was positive for pck , ck5 / 6 , 34betae12 , p63 , ck17 , and negative for ck19 , ttf - 1 , ck7 , ck20 , ki67 > 10 % .
after surgery , the patient was given four cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine .
because of incomplete dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes and pathologic n2 disease , the patient was subsequently treated with mediastinal radiotherapy , 50 gy in all at 2 gy per day , five days per week for five weeks .
after 10 months of disease free interval , a routine urine test showed wbc 20 and rbc 5 - 10 per high - power field ; enhanced ct scan showed an occupying lesion in the left renal parenchyma and paraaortic lymph node enlargement ( figure 1 ) , while brain mri and liver ct scan showed no other distant metastasis .
in addition , b ultrasound guided left kidney biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy specimen showed : metastatic squamous cell lung carcinoma , with the same positive tumor biomarkers as in the surgical lung sample ( figure 2 ) .

discussion tumor metastasis is a process that includes shedding , adhesion , penetration , migration and proliferation of primary tumor cells .
a variety of cytokines , proteins , and genes are involved in the process .
the tumor cells entering circulation do not spread to every organ randomly , but tend to seed in selected organs .
mechanisms underlying this targeted metastases are still unclear .
the " seed soil " hypothesis proposed by fidler [ 3 ] considers that the tumor cells transfer to any location equally , but they can only grow in specific sites able to provide suitable environment for the growth ( soil ) .
the tumor cells entering the cycle have receptors specifically binding to the endothelial cells of target organs through special chemotactic factors produced by them ( seed ) ; thus the tumor cells are preferentially attracted to the target organ ( seed soil ) .
in addition , the anatomical structure of the primary lesion , the inherent anatomic structure of the target organ and other factors can have effect on tumor production of metastates to target organs .
renal metastases frequently do not present clinical symptoms and many patients have no hematuria or hyperazotemia .
according to literature , renal metastatic tumors mainly locate in the cortical zone close to glomerular vascular plexus and seldom spread to urothelial tissue , so that the incidence of microscopic hematuria is 12 % ~ 31 % [ 4 ] .
single renal tumors include renal cell carcinoma and renal angiomyolipoma .
multiple renal tumors include multiple renal infarctions and multiple renal cysts .
identification of tumors metastatic to kidney , so as of renal cell carcinoma , renal angiomyolipoma and renal cysts , relies on kidney biopsy .
in this report , the immunohistochemical staining of left kidney biopsy specimen showed positive ck5 / 6,34betae12 , and p63 markers , whereas the ttf - 1 was negative .
these results indicated that the renal mass derived from the primary lung squamous cell carcinoma [ 5 ] , and it was not a renal cell carcinoma .
renal metastases from nsclc are restricted to a few anecdotal case reports in literature [ 6,7 ] .
even when present , renal metastases are usually part of disseminated disease or bilateral renal metastases [ 8 ] , but in our patient the metastasis was single .
as to the treatment , it has to be individualized [ 9 ] : nephrectomy may be considered in the absence of disseminated disease or in selected patients with need for palliation .
our patient refused nephrectomy , so we treated her with stereotactic radiosurgery - gama knife for the left kidney .
after radiotherapy , the patient remained under clinical observation .
conclusions renal metastatic tumors from squamous cell lung carcinoma are very rare and easy to be neglected , however we should take into account also the possibility of a metastasis from this tumor when a renal mass is detected .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images .

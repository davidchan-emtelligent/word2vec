key words adonis wolgensis antibacterial activity antioxidant activity fatty acid introduction plants are rich sources of beneficial secondary metabolites which are attractive as pharmaceuticals , antimicrobials , flavors , fragrances , and pesticides .
among these herbal constituents , fatty acids , antioxidants , and antibacterial compounds play very important role in maintaining health and improving the quality of human life .
therefore , there is a growing interest in finding plants for food and medicinal applications ( tavakoli et al. , 2012a > ; jelodarian et al. , 2011 > ; sedighinia et al. , 2012 > ; tekeli et al. , 2010 >) .
the genus adonis l .
( ranunculaceae ) comprises about 30 species of herbaceous plants , which are mainly distributed in the temperate regions of asia and europe ( wang , 1994 >) .
nine taxa of this genus have already been reported from flora of iran ( rechinger , 1992 >) .
a literature survey showed that the adonis species has been found to be rich in flavonoids ( komissarenko et al. , 1973 >) , cardenolides ( pauli et al. , 1993 >) , and phenolic glycosides ( pauli and junior , 1995 >) .

b values are mean +/ - sd of three separate experiments .
discussion according to the results obtained from gc - ms , the leaf and stem of the plant differed in terms of fatty acid content and their percentages ( table 1 ) .
table 1 shows that the unsaturated fatty acid contents were higher than saturated ones in both tested extracts .
poly - unsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) are considered valuable compounds in the human diet because of their effect in human health ( das , 2000 > ; grundy , 1997 >) .
therefore , increased consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased consumption of saturated fatty acids are linked to positive health outcomes .
according to these results , the oil of a. wolgensis l. may be a good source of poly - unsaturated fatty acids .
aqueous mixtures of methanol , ethanol , and acetone are commonly used to extract plants ( sun and ho , 2005 >) .
thus , in this study , 90 % methanol was used as extracting solvent .
phenolic compounds are attracting considerable interest in the field of medicine and food chemistry due to their promising antioxidant potential .
therefore , measurement of total phenolic content of natural products is an essential task .
the results show that the hydro - methanolic extract of a. wolgensis l. is a rich source of polyphenolic compounds ( 9.20 +/ - 0.011 gae / g dry matter ) , as confirmed by aforementioned investigations ( komissarenko et al. , 1973 > ; pauli and junior , 1995 >) .
the content of total phenolic in the present study was comparable with other researches ( silva et al. , 2006 > ; sultana et al. , 2007 >) .
free radicals are involved in lipid peroxidation , which plays important role in the development of various chronic diseases such as cancer , alzheimer 's , and heart diseases ( halliwell and gutteridge , 1989 >) .
therefore , the ability to scavenge free radicals is an important antioxidant property .
the value ic50 shows hydro - methanolic extract which is contained high amount of total phenolics , to be also an active radical scavenger .
the reducing power of a compound ( fe3 + - fe2 +) is used to determine the electron - donating capacity of antioxidants and is one of the main characteristics of phenolic compounds ( dorman et al. , 2003 >) .
ability of the extract to reduce iron ( iii ) to iron ( ii ) was determined and compared with that of ascorbic acid and gallic acid which are known to be strong reducing agents .
the results of antioxidant activity of hydro - methanolic extract suggest that the antioxidant activity has high correlation with total phenolic content .
several researchers have reported the relationship between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in plant extracts ( sultana et al. , 2007 > ; mustafa et al. , 2010 >) .
on the other hand , the results of the present study indicated that phenolic compounds are powerful scavengers of free radicals and reducing agents .
however , further investigation is needed to identify individual compounds forming antioxidative system and develop their application as food and pharmaceuticals .
increase of antibiotic resistance as well as undesirable side effects of synthetic drugs have triggered immense interest in the search for new antimicrobial agents of plant origin ( lewis and elvin - lewis , 1995 > ; alves et al. , 2012 >) .
in this study , the antibacterial activity of the hydro - methanolic extract of a. wolgensis l. against panel pathogenic microorganisms was assessed by measuring mic .
the results showed that hydro - methanolic extract contains effective antibacterial activity and are comparable with amoxycillin as standard antibiotic and results of others studies ( quereshi et al. , 2010 > ; miceli et al. , 2009 >) .
high antibacterial activity of this extract could be due to the high content of phenolic compounds ( herald & davidson , 1983 > ; stead , 1993 >) .
there are reports that show extracts of some plants and mushrooms have poor antibacterial activity against b. subtilis , while possess significant activity against other gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria as mentioned in this study ( smania et al. , 2007 > ; alves et al. , 2012 >) .
therefore , further isolation and purification of this extract are required to determine the active compounds responsible for antibacterial activity .
although our results support the idea that a. wolgensis l. extract is a candidate for treatment of infectious diseases , clinical trials are required to confirm its antibacterial effect and general safety .

background cancellation of surgery close to scheduled time causes a waste of healthcare resources .
the current study analyzes surgery cancellations occurring after the patient has been prepared for the operating room , in order to see whether improvements in the surgery planning process may reduce the number of cancellations .
methods in a retrospective chart review of operating room surgery cancellations during the period from 2006 to 2011 , cancellations were divided into the following categories : inadequate npo ; medical ; surgical ; system ; airway ; incomplete evaluation .
the relative use of these reasons in relation to patient age and surgical department was then evaluated .
results forty - one percent of cancellations were for other than medical reasons .
among these , 17.7 % were due to incomplete evaluation , and 8.2 % were due to family issues .
sixty seven percent of cancelled cases eventually received surgery .
the relative use of individual reasons for cancellation varied with patient age and surgical department .
the difference between cancellations before and after anesthesia was dependent on the causes of cancellation , but not age , sex , asa status , or follow - up procedures required .
conclusion almost half of the cancellations were not due to medical reasons , and these cancellations could be reduced by better administrative and surgical planning and better communication with the patient and / or his family .
preoperative care surgical procedures appointments and schedules background cancellations of surgical procedures can result in inefficient use of hospital resources and loss of hospital income .
the most damaging cancellations with regard to inefficient and costly use of medical resources are cancellations that occur after the patient has been prepared for the operating room .
reasons for cancellations vary , depending on the patient population , the type of surgery , and the adequacy of hospital administrative procedures .
for example , in the pediatric population scheduled for day surgery , but not other populations , 35 to 40 % of cancellations were reported to be due to upper respiratory infections [ 1,2 ] .
many cancellations are either due to poor allocation of hospital facilities or poor prior evaluation of and communication with the patient .
in a study of cancellations in a hospital that had increased its operating room capacity but not made any other changes , cancellations due to lack of post - operative bed space increased [ 3 ] .
in a study of same day urological surgery , 77 % of cancellations in the week before surgery were due to work - up or facility factors [ 4 ]. and in 2 studies of same day eye surgery , 20 - 40 % of cancellations occurred because the patient did not show up on the day of surgery [ 5,6 ] .
if the reasons for cancellations can be determined , procedures to avoid some of the cancellations can be put in place .
previous studies have focused on cancellations on the day of surgery .
in contrast , the current study has a narrower focus and , through a retrospective chart review , examines and categorizes reasons for cancellation of surgery after the patient has been prepared for the operating room , in order to determine ways to reduce the number of such cancellations .
methods this study was a retrospective chart review of all scheduled surgical procedures for the years 2006 - 2011 from the china medical university hospital .
in these records , any surgery that was cancelled after the patient had already been prepared for the operating room was included in the study .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of china medical university .
in our hospital system , every patient who enters the operation room ( or ) is accompanied by his / her personal anesthetist and anesthesia technician ( s ) , and cancellation of surgery is immediately recorded by quality assurance team members into a self - developed database connected to the hospital intranet .
the information of all cases in this study was obtained from the hospital database containing the details of all operations performed .
data collection was done by independently designated personnel who were also responsible for the classification of each case .
further data retrieval and analysis were performed by one of the authors of this study , who also audited the input of data ( including the classification and person responsible for input ; therefore " inter - observer " differences were minimized ) .
the classification system used was developed to cover as many situations as possible and to separate " avoidable " from " unavoidable " reasons for cancellation .
reasons for cancelling surgeries were placed into the following 7 categories : inadequate npo preparation , medical reasons , surgical reasons , system reasons , airway issues , family issues , and incomplete evaluation .
( 1 ) npo preparation meant no oral food or fluid in the 12 hours previous to the surgery ( 2 ) medical reasons included the following : highly elevated blood pressure ; indications such as fever or unexpected infection ; abscess formation outside the operating area ; newly reported blood culture data ; occurrence of an unstable hemodynamic change such as new onset arrhythmia or profound hypotension after anesthetic induction ; and cardiac arrest .
( 3 ) surgical reasons were a change by the surgeon of the surgical plan , usually due to a change in the patient 's clinical condition .
this reason for cancellation usually did not result in increased anesthesiological risk , but led to a change in the operative approach and different follow - up care .
( 4 ) system reasons included the patient being sent to the operating room without notifying the doctor in charge , the wrong patient being sent to the operating room , and failure to prepare the necessary instruments .
( 5 ) airway issues meant difficulty in maintaining the airway .
( 6 ) family issues included the patient or family changing their previous decision ( refusal of anesthesia or surgery ) , and no family member being present to sign the consent form .
( 7 ) incomplete evaluation included incomplete pre - operative evaluation , the results of pre - operative evaluation not yet available , lack of awareness of the poor results in the pre - operative examination , and difference of opinion between the anesthesiologist performing the pre - operative evaluation and the anesthesiologist giving the anesthesia .
statistical analysis the demographics and characteristics of patients were summarized as mean +/ - standard deviation and range ( minimum , maximum ) for patient age , and n (%) for other categorical variables .
causes to cancel surgery according to department or patient age were also summarized as n (%) and compared using fisher 's exact test .
all statistical assessments were two - tailed and considered significant at p < 0.05 .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss 15.0 statistics software ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) .
results a total of 417 patients were included for evaluation and all patient records were collected from year 2006 to year 2011 .
there were 211 males ( 129 < 65 yrs and 82 >= 65 yrs ) and 206 females ( 104 < 65 yrs and 102 >= 65 yrs ) .

follow - up of the cancellations showed that 277 ( 67.1 %) of the cancelled operations were performed at a later time ( that is , the patients still received the surgery , but after some further treatment ) .
this information suggests that some of the reasons causing surgery cancellation could be amended or avoided , but that the cancelled surgery was ultimately necessary .
furthermore , 43 out of the 277 patients who had the operation at a later time did so with local anesthesia ( that is , the surgeon decided to do local anesthesia independently , without involving the anesthesiologist ) .
at the time of data collection , 136 patients ( 32.9 %) did not have the cancelled operation at a later time ( table 1 ) .
table 3 summarizes the reasons for cancellation according to patient demographics and department .
the distributions of causes for surgery cancellations were significantly different between the age groups of the patients , the surgeons' departments , cancelled before or after anesthesia , and whether patients received follow - up procedures ( all p - values < 0.05 ; table 3 ) .
the sex of the patients and visit to pre - operative anesthesia opd were not associated with the causes .
table 4 compares reasons for cancellation in patients who had already been anesthetized and those who had not yet been anesthetized. between these two groups , there were no significant differences in terms of age , sex , asa physical status , or whether the patients received follow - up procedures .
the only significant difference was the cause of surgery cancellation ( p < 0.001 ) .
for example 22.6 % of cancellations after anesthesia , but only 7 % of cancellations before anesthesia due to surgical reasons , and 0 % of cancellations after anesthesia , but 14.6 % of cancellations before anesthesia were due to incomplete evaluation .

discussion this retrospective chart review of reasons that surgery was cancelled after the patient had been prepared for surgery showed that the most common reason for cancellation was medical , but that many cancellations were due to situations that could be prevented with changes in scheduling , administrative , and communications procedures .
incomplete pre - operative evaluation , systemic problems , and insufficient npo are due to administrative errors that should be corrected .
some reasons like family causes should be avoided by full discussion and communication with the families before the patients arrive at the or. and although a change in medical condition leading to cancellation was the main cause of cancellations and would seem to be an uncontrollable factor , reinforcement of communication between departments might prevent some of these cancellations .
cancellation after the patient and operating room have been prepared for surgery causes definite financial loss to the institution , while cancellations at earlier times may cause less to no real financial loss .
also , some reasons for earlier cancellations are not pertinent to very late cancellations .
therefore , it is not appropriate to directly compare the reasons and frequency for cancellation in this report to other reports focusing on cancellations at much earlier time periods .
few reports on same day cancellation of in - patient surgery have been published .
rates for same day cancellations have been reported to be 12 - 24 % [ 3 ] , but some of these rates are for day and not in - patient surgery .
for same day cancellation of in - patient surgery , schofield [ 7 ] reported a 12 % cancellation rate and that 58 % of these cancellations were due to or overrun , lack of availability of post - operative beds , or procedural errors , and only 17 % were due to changes in patient status .
in a similar study , pollard [ 8 ] reported a 13 % cancellation rate and that the most common reason for cancellation was administrative problems , such as insufficient or time .
in reports from nigeria , india , and saudi arabia , unavailability of surgeon , or , or icu beds were major reasons for same day cancellations , and the surgeon 's underestimation of or time was an important cause of or unavailability [ 9 - 12 ] .
however , in a report on pediatric surgery in australia , the contribution of these causes to same day cancellations was minimal [ 13 ] .
perroca et al .
[ 14 ] , n the study most comparable to this study , reported 53 % of cancellations that occurred after the or had been prepared for surgery were patient - related .
most of the cancellations ( 29 %) were due to the patient 's medical condition , and 24 % were due to organizational problems , such as lack of icu beds .
in our study , 59 % of cancellations were due to medical reasons .
our data showing 12.7 % of or cancellations made after anesthesia is also similar to the 9.1 % of or cancellations made during surgery reported by perroca et al .
[ 14 ] .
several studies have reported on specific methods used in attempt to reduce surgery cancellations .
at one hospital , the single change of increasing operating room capacity did not decrease cancellations because post - operative bed capacity was not increased at the same time [ 3 ] .
at another hospital , instituting outpatient preoperative evaluation of patients did decrease cancellations [ 15 ]. and an analysis of the effect of scheduling cases with known predictors of a high rate of cancellation to the last operative period of the day concluded that using this means of reducing cancellations was impractical [ 16 ] .
to relate our results to those of others , it is useful to put them in the context of the health care system in taiwan .
health care is taiwan is operated by the government with relatively low co - payments from patients [ 17,18 ] .
therefore , many tests and surgeries have become quite cheap and are over - prescribed .
in addition , with the high population density and high hospital density in taiwan , medical care is highly accessible. and taiwanese people tend to feel physiologically more secure if more tests are done , more medications ordered , and surgery performed when possible ( not when necessary ) .
occasionally there are even surgeries cancelled because the patients wanted to schedule the surgery as soon as possible to the point that the pre - surgery test results were not yet available .
these situations may provide useful information for other countries promoting public health care ( for example , the us ) .
the current study has a number of limitations .
( 1 ) it is a retrospective study .
( 2 ) it is difficult to separate reasons for cancellations into clear - cut , discrete categories , for some cancellation reasons might fit in more than one category and some cancellations might be described differently depending on the individual who recorded them .
( 3 ) further data analyses are needed to determine whether there were more cancellations due to inadequate preparation in " emergency " vs. in " non - emergency " operations .
( 4 ) although we could evaluate group differences in causes for cancellation , we could not do statistics on differences between groups in each individual cause because of the small sample size of some of the individual causes .
in the future , we are interested in examining the time lost between surgery cancellation , vacation of the occupied space , and the time and manpower required to prepare for the next scheduled surgery , and estimating the financial costs of the cancellations .
conclusions in conclusion , in this study analyzing cases of in - patient surgery cancellations after the patient had been prepared for the operating room , the majority of cancellations were due to unforeseen changes in patient status , but many were due to oversights or inadequacies in procedures that could be improved .

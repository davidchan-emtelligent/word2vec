accordingly , a wide variety of approaches to quantify the similarity ( or dissimilarity ) between two or more spike trains has been suggested .
recently , the isi - and the spike - distance [ 1,2 ] have been proposed as parameter - free and time - scale independent measures of spike train synchrony .
the key property of both measures is that they are time - resolved since they rely on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity .
this makes it possible to track changes in instantaneous clustering , i.e. , time - localized patterns of ( dis ) similarity among multiple spike trains .
the spike - distance also comes in a causal variant [ 2 ] which is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity are defined from past information only so that time - resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real - time .
for both the regular and the real - time spike - distance , there are several levels of information reduction [ 3 ] .
the starting point is the most detailed representation in which one instantaneous value is obtained for each pair of spike trains .
this results in a matrix of size ' number of sampled time instants' x ' squared number of spike trains' ( i.e. #( tn ) n2 ). by selecting a pair of spike trains one obtains a bivariate dissimilarity profile whereas the selection of a time instant yields an instantaneous matrix of pairwise spike train dissimilarities which can be used to divide the spike trains into instantaneous clusters , i.e. , groups of spike trains with low intra - group and high inter - group dissimilarity .
another way to reduce the information is averaging .
the spatial average over spike train pairs yields a dissimilarity profile for the selected ( sub ) population , whereas temporal averaging leads to a bivariate distance matrix for the selected interval or the selected trigger points .
finally , application of the remaining average results in one distance value which describes the overall level of synchrony for a group of spike trains over a given time interval .
the matlab source codes for calculating and visualizing both the isi - and the spike - distance have been made publicly available and have already been widely used in various contexts .
however , the use of these codes is not very intuitive and their application requires some basic knowledge of matlab .
thus it became desirable to provide a more user - friendly and accessible interface .
here we address this need and present the graphical user interface spiky [ 4,5 ] .
this interactive program facilitates the application of the isi - and the spike - distance to both simulated and real data .
spiky includes a spike train generator for testing purposes , as well as masks for selecting the analysis window and the neuronal subpopulation of interest .
once given a set of spike train data , it calculates the desired measure and allows visualization of all the different representations mentioned above ( such as measure profiles and pairwise dissimilarity matrices ) .
it even includes the possibility to generate movies which are very useful in order to track the varying patterns of ( dis ) similarity .
finally , we also have increased the high computation speed even further by transferring the most time - consuming parts of the original matlab code to matlab executables ( mex ) with the new subroutines written in c. acknowledgements nb and tk acknowledge funding support from the european commission through marie curie initial training network ' neural engineering transformative technologies ( nett )' , project 289146 .

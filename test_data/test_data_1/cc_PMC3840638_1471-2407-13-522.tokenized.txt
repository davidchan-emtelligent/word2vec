background hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in china .
this study investigated the effects of annexin a7 ( anxa7 ) on the inhibition of hcc lymph node metastasis in a mouse model .
methods the stable knockup and knockdown of annexin a7 - expressing hcc cells using annexin a7 cdna and shrna vectors , respectively , were injected into a mouse footpad to establish primary and metastatic tumors in mice .
on the 14th , 21st , and 28th days after hcc cells inoculation , the mice were sacrificed for inspection of primary and secondary tumors and immunohistochemistry of annexin a7 expression .
results the lymph node metastasis rate of the fanxa7 - control group was 77 % , and the lymph node metastasis rate of the fanxa7 - down group was 100 % ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , the lymph node metastasis rate of the panxa7 - up group was 0 % and that of the panxa7 - control group was 36 % ( p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , immunohistochemistry experiments revealed that the subcellular localization of annexin a7 protein in both primary and lymph node - metastasized tumors was mainly in the cytosol .
in addition , the expression of the 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms of annexin a7 protein changed during tumor progression .
conclusion this study indicated that annexin a7 expression was able to inhibit hcc lymph node metastasis , whereas knockdown of annexin a7 expression significantly induced hcc metastasis to local lymph nodes .
annexin a7 lymph node metastasis hcc gene transfection animal experiment background hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , the most common type of liver cancer , is a significant health problem in the world due to its high incidence and mortality rate .
hcc accounts for more than 700,000 new cases and over 500,000 deaths each year worldwide .
hcc is heterogeneous and a highly aggressive malignancy ; to date , there are no effective means for a cure , due to high invasion , early metastasis , and high tumor recurrence after surgery or interventional treatment .
therefore , early detection and prevention of hcc and the control of hcc metastasis are urgently needed to improve hcc prognosis .
the risk factors for hcc include heavy alcohol consumption , hepatitis b and c , aflatoxin , liver cirrhosis , hemochromatosis , and type 2 diabetes ; thus , eradication of these risk factors could significantly reduce hcc risk .
furthermore , hcc progression , like metastasis , contributes to most human cancer deaths .
mechanistically , metastasis involves multiple processes , such as tumor cell proliferation , invasion , transportation , arrest , adherence , extravasation , settling - down , and growth in secondary sites [ 1 ] .
lymph node metastasis of a tumor is considered as an important factor that is involved in tumor progression .
however , the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in lymph node metastasis of tumors remain undefined .
to date , a number of genes have been identified that modulate lymphatic tumor metastasis when they are highly expressed in certain tumor cells , such as ezrin [ 2 ] , af1qn [ 3 ] , mmp - 11 [ 4 ] , or annexin a7 [ 5,6 ] .
annexin a7 is a member of the multifunctional calcium / phospholipid - binding annexin family that functions as a ca2 + - activated gtpase with membrane fusion properties .
a spliced cassette exon generally induces two isoforms of annexin a7 ( 47 kda and 51 kda ) .
the 47 kda isoform is present in all tissues except for skeletal muscle , while the 51 kda isoform is exclusively present in the brain , heart , and skeletal muscle .
protein structural analysis indicates that annexin a7 is a membrane binding protein with diverse properties , such as voltage - sensitive calcium channel activity , ion selectivity , and membrane fusion properties .
however , the precise molecular action of this protein is unclear , especially in hcc cell metastasis .
our previous study demonstrated that annexin a7 mrna expression is 3.48 - fold greater in hca - f cells than in hca - p cells after cdna microarray and gene chip assays [ 5 ] ; in addition , annexin a7 protein expression is three times higher in hca - f cells than in hca - p cells , as shown by using two - dimensional differential in - gel electrophoresis ( 2 - d dige ) minimal labeling analysis [ 6 ] , indicating that at the mrna and protein levels , annexin a7 was more highly expressed in the hca - f cell line with a high potential for lymphatic metastasis than in the hca - p cell line with low potential for lymphatic metastasis .
these data suggest that annexin a7 may be a lymph node metastasis - associated gene and may play a key role in hcc involved with lymph node metastasis .
therefore , to gain more insight into the potential mechanisms and associated genes that are involved in hcc lymph node metastasis , we proposed the current study by using two mouse hepatocarcinoma ascites syngeneic cell lines , hca - f ( lymph node metastasis rate > 70 %) and hca - p ( lymph node metastasis rate < 30 %) [ 7 - 9 ] to assess the effects of annexin a7 on the regulation of hcc cell metastasis in an inbred chinese 615 mouse model of metastasis .
methods ethics statement inbred chinese 615 mice ( 6 - 8 weeks old , scxk ( liao ) 2008 - 0002 ) provided by the experimental animal center of dalian medical university .
mice were maintained under standard conditions and treated according to the institutional guidelines for the use of laboratory animals .
all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the experimental animal ethical committee of dalian medical university ( permit number : l2012012 ) .
cell lines and culture both hca - f and hca - p cells were established and maintained in our laboratory [ 5,6 ] .
cells were grown in vitro and then inoculated at 2 x 106 cells in a 0.2 ml cell suspension into each inbred chinese 615 mouse and grown in the mouse abdominal cavity for 7 days .
these cells were drawn and injected again into another inbred chinese 615 mouse and grown for 5 days .
then , those cells were routinely cultured in rpmi - 1640 ( gibco , ca , usa ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( paa , ca , usa ) at 37degreesc in a humidified incubator with 5 % co2 and 95 % air .
for annexin a7 gene transfection subcell populations , they were maintained in the same conditions except for cultivating in rpmi - 1640 supplemented with 10 % fbs and 400 mug / ml g418 ( calbiochem , ca , usa ) .
expression vector construction and gene transfection to knockdown annexin a7 expression in hca - f cells , we constructed three shrna plasmids ( annexin a25 , annexin a59 , and annexin a507 ) using mouse annexin a7 cdna ( accession # nm _ 009674.3 ) .
the target sequences for annexin a25 were 5 ' - gatccgtcagaattgagtgggaatttcaagagaattcccactcaattctgacttttttggaaa - 3 ' and 5 ' - agcttttccaaaaaagtcagaattgagtgggaattctcttgaaattcccactcaattctgacg - 3 ' .

the primer for m13f was 5 ' - gttttcccagtcacgac - 3 ' .
after annealing into double - stranded dna , these shrna oligonucleotides were then inserted into psilencer ( tm ) 3.1 - h1 neo plasmids ( shanghai zj bio - tech , china ) using the bamhi and hindiii sites and transfected into escherichia coli dh5alpha for amplification .
after sequence confirmation , these plasmids were then used for stable gene transfection .
to increase annexin a7 expression in hca - p cells , the annexin a7 gene was amplified , and bamh 1 and ecor i enzymes were used .
the pcdna3.1 - annexin a7 expressing vectors was constructed .
hca - f and hca - p cells with a density of 1 x 106 cells / well were cultured in six - well plates with serum - free rpmi - 1640 medium .
these plasmids and " empty " vector were transfected into hca - f cells using 15 mul of lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and cultivated in rpmi - 1640 medium .
after that , the cells were cultured in rpmi - 1640 medium containing g418 ( 400 mug / ml ) to establish a stable subcell population .
after 16 days , approximately 85 - 95 % of the cells were eliminated , and the remaining cells were continuously cultured in rpmi - 1640 medium containing g418 ( 400 mug / ml ) for our experiments .
hca - f and hca - p cells were each divided into three groups : <> unmanipulated hca - f cells were used as the control ( hca - f ) .
<> empty plasmids were transfected into hca - f cells ( fanxa7 - control ) .
<> shrna - anxa7 plasmids were transfected into hca - f cells ( fanxa7 - down ) .
<> unmanipulated hca - p cells were used as the control ( hca - p ) .
<> empty plasmids were transfected into hca - p cells ( panxa7 - control ) .
<> pcdna3.1 - anxa7 plasmids were transfected into hca - p cells ( panxa7 - up ) .
rna isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) total rna was isolated from the cultured cells using trizol ( invitrogen , usa ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
after rna isolation , cdna was prepared from each sample by using 2 mug of total rna for reverse transcription in a mixture , consisting of 4 mul of 5x rt - buffer , 2.5 mum oligo ( dt ) primers , 5 mm dntps , 20 u rnasin , and reverse transcriptase ( promega , ca , usa ) .
the pcr mixture contained 4 mul of 10x buffer , 0.8 mul of 10 mm dntp , 3.2 mul of 25 mm mgcl2 , 0.5 mul of each primer , and 0.3 mul of 5 u taq dna gold polymerase ( takara , ca , japan ) .
the pcr conditions were as follows : 95degreesc for 5 min ; 30 cycles of 94degreesc for 15 s , 57degreesc for 20 s , and 72degreesc 60 s ; and a final extension at 72degreesc for 10 min .
the annexin a7 primers were 5 ' - tgtctaaccgttccaatgacc - 3 ' ( upstream ) and 5 ' - ggattcatccgttcccagtc - 3 ' ( downstream ) .
protein extraction and western blot total cellular protein was extracted using a buffer containing lysate , dtt , pmsf , and cocktail ( roche , ca , china ) .
next , protein samples were fractionated by using 12 % sds - page .
annexin a7 antibody ( a4475 , sigma , usa ) was used at a dilution of 1:1500 for western blot , and gapdh antibody ( kangchen , ca , china ) was used at a dilution of 1:7500 .
the secondary antibody ( zhongshan golden bridge , ca , china ) was used at a dilution of 1:4000 for both annexin a7 and gapdh .
positive protein bands were visualized by using electrochemiluminescence reagents ( santa cruz biotechnologies , ca , usa ) and quantified by using densitometry ( bio - rad , ca , usa ) .
animal experiments a total of 84 inbred chinese 615 mice were provided by the experimental animal housing facility at dalian medical university .
the mouse model of hcc cell lymphatic metastasis was established by injection of hcc cells into the left footpad of inbred chinese 615 mice ( called " primary tumor ") .
the number of cells injected into each mouse was 2 x 106 / 0.05 ml. on the 14th , 21st , and 28th days after tumor cell inoculation , the mice were sacrificed and examined .
during these periods of time , all of the inoculated tumor cells developed xenografts in the footpad for hca - f , fanxa7 - control , fanxa7 - down , hca - p , panxa7 - control , and panxa7 - up groups .
some of the mice also developed metastatic tumors in different regional lymph nodes , which were called " metastasized lymph nodes " , including popliteal , inguinal , and iliac artery lymph nodes .
lymph nodes volumes ( v ) were calculated by the formula v = l x w2 x 0.5 .
all primary and secondary tumor xenografts were collected for processing by hematoxylin and eosin ( he ) staining .
in addition , protein samples from the primary tumor were extracted for western blot analysis of annexin a7 protein expression .
meanwhile , protein samples from the primary tumor in the hca - f cell group on the 14th , 21st , and 28th days were called " f14 " group , " f21 " group , and " f28 " group , respectively ; protein samples from the primary tumor in the fanxa7 - down cell group on the 28th day were called the " fanxa7 - down28 " group ; protein samples from the primary tumor in the hca - p cell group on the 14th , 21st , and 28th days were called " p14 " group , " p21 " group , and " p28 " group , respectively ; protein samples from the primary tumor in the panxa7 - up cell group on the 28th day were called the " panxa7 - up28 " group .
the popliteal , iliac artery , and inguinal lymph nodes were collected for he staining and immunohistochemistry to examine potential secondary tumors and annexin a7 expression under a microscope .
immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry was used to detect annexin a7 expression in the mouse xenografts .
a mouse monoclonal antibody against annexin a7 was used at a dilution of 1:200 .
a rabbit anti - mouse secondary antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology , ca , usa ) was used at a 1:1000 dilution .
annexin a7 protein expression was quantified based on staining intensity and uniformity of nuclear / cytoplasmic staining .
the percentage of staining was scored as 1 , <= 10 % ; 2 , 11 - 50 % ; 3 , 51 - 75 % ; and 4 , > 75 % .
staining intensity was scored as 0 , no staining ; 1 , stramineous color ; 2 , yellow color ; and 3 , brown .
next , these scores were combined to give a final score for each section as - to +++ ( - , no signal ; + , weak indeterminate signal ; ++ , moderate signal ; +++ , strong signal ) .
all sections were stained simultaneously , together with the appropriate positive and negative controls .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using the chi2 - test and standard one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) or one - way anova for repeated measures .
immunohistochemical data were compared using a rank - sum test .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results establishment of stable knockup and knockdown of annexin a7 - expressing hcc cells in this study , we established stable cells that expressed knockdown of annexin a7 in hca - f cell lines .
the rt - pcr results showed that different constructs of shrna had different knockdown efficiencies of annexin a7 expression .
while , the transfection efficiency of psilencer - annexin a25 shrna was better than those of annexin a59 and annexin a507 in silencing annexin a7 gene expression in hca - f cells 24 h after transfection ( figure 1a ) .
the deltact values of hca - f , fanxa7 - control , and fanxa7 - down cells were 2.02 , 3.06 , and 4.88 , respectively .
western blot results indicated that the expression of annexin a7 in fanxa7 - down was significantly lower than fanxa7 - control , but annexin a7 expression in hca - f showed no difference compared to fanxa7 - control ( figure 1c ) .
these data showed that hca - f cells had downregulated expression of annexin a7 , not only at the gene level but also at the protein level .

( a ) rt - pcr analysis of annexin a7 gene silencing in hca - f cells using three shrna constructs ( annexin a25 , annexin a59 , and annexin a507 ) .
psilencer - annexin a25 shrna was more potent than psilencer - annexin a507 and psilencer - annexin a59 shrna .
( b ) rt - pcr analysis of annexin a7 mrna expression in hca - p cells .
( c ) western blot analysis of annexin a7 expression in hca - f , fanxa7 - control , and fanxa7 - down cells. ( d ) western blot analysis of annexin a7 expression in hca - p , panxa7 - control , and panxa7 - up cells .
the rt - pcr data showed that the deltact value of annexin a7 gene expression in hca - p cells was 0.54 , and in panxa7 - up cells it was 0.24 ( figure 1b ) .
western blot analysis showed that annexin a7 expression in panxa7 - up cells was greater than in panxa7 - control , but annexin a7 expression in hca - p showed no difference compared to panxa7 - control ( figure 1d ) .
these data illustrated that the pcdna3.1 - annexin a7 expression vector was successfully constructed and stably expressed in hca - p cells , indicating that hca - p cells had upregulated expression of annexin a7 both at the gene and protein levels after gene transfection .
effects of annexin a7 on the regulation of hcc cell lymph node metastasis in a mouse model the above results evidently indicate that annexin a7 was successfully downregulated in hca - f cells and upregulated in hca - p cells .
after the two stable cell lines were established , they were injected into the footpads of inbred chinese 615 mice to ensure that all the mice developed a " primary tumor " .
the metastatic tumor xenografts developed in the lymph nodes ( figure 2a ) .
the results showed that the lymph node metastasis rate of the fanxa7 - control group was 77 % , and that of the fanxa7 - down group was 100 % ( p < 0.05 , table 1 ) , indicating that after downregulation of the annexin a7 gene in hca - f cells with high lymphatic metastasis potential , the lymph node metastasis rate was increased significantly in vivo .
in contrast , the lymph node metastasis rate of the panxa7 - up group was 0 % and that of the panxa7 - control group was 36 % ( p < 0.05 , table 1 ) , demonstrating that annexin a7 protein expression significantly reduced lymph node metastasis upon upregulation of the annexin a7 gene in hca - p cells .

the data indicated that the volumes of the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were significantly larger than the iliac artery lymph nodes ( p < 0.05 ) , and the volumes of the popliteal lymph nodes were significantly larger than the inguinal lymph nodes ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2b ) .
the metastasized lymph nodes stained with he showed that no obvious morphological differences were noted in metastasized lymph nodes of the fanxa7 - control , fanxa7 - down , and panxa7 - control groups ( figure 2c ) .
expression and subcellular localizations of annexin a7 protein in mouse xenografts next , we analyzed the expression and subcellular localization of annexin a7 in mouse primary tumor tissue and metastatic lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry .
we found that the subcellular localization of annexin a7 protein in primary and lymph node - metastasized tumors was mainly in the cytosol , and some of the annexin a7 protein was partially localized in the nuclei and cell membrane ( figure 3 ) .
the expression intensity of annexin a7 protein between high and low lymph node - metastasized tumors was also different : there was lower annexin a7 expression in primary fanxa7 - down tumor cells than in fanxa7 - control tumors ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , annexin a7 expression was greater in primary tumors of panxa7 - up cells than in those of panxa7 - control cells ( p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , annexin a7 expression was greater in lymph node - metastasized tumors derived from fanxa7 - down cells than from fanxa7 - control cells ( p < 0.05 ) .
likewise , annexin a7 expression was greater in fanxa7 - control primary tumor cells than in lymph node - metastasized tumors ( p < 0.05 ; table 2 ) .
figure 3 immunohistochemistry analysis of annexin a7 expression in primary tumor and metastatic lymph node tissues .
the subcellular localization of annexin a7 protein in primary tumor cells was mainly in the cytosol and partially in the cell membrane , while annexin a7 expression in lymph node metastatic tumors was only localized in the cytosol .

expression of annexin a7 levels in high - and low - lymph node - metastasized primary tumors we investigated the time course of primary tumor formation in mice and found that on the 14th , 21st , and 28th days after tumor cell inoculation , both the 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms of annexin a7 protein were detected in the " primary tumor " with different expression levels .
expression of the 47 kda isoform in the fanxa7 - down28 group was less than that in the f28 group .
the expression of the 51 kda isoform in the panxa7 - up28 group was greater than that in the p28 group ( figure 4a ) .
in hca - f cells with a high lymphatic metastasis potential , expression of the 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms was consistent with the total protein that was found on the 14th day , which was the highest point , and on the 21st day , which was the lowest level ; while on the 28th day , the protein expression increased ( figure 4a , 4b ) .
whereas in hca - p cells with a low lymphatic metastasis potential , the expression level of the 47 kda isoform of annexin a7 was consistent with the total protein , which decreased over time , while that of the 51 kda isoform increased over time ( figure 4a , 4c ) .

( c ) quantification of annexin a7 ( 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms ) expression at 14th , 21st , and 28th days after hca - p cell inoculation .
discussion in this study , we investigated the effects of annexin a7 on hcc and lymphatic metastasis in a mouse model of lymph node metastasis by using the two mice hepatocarcinoma ascites syngeneic cell lines hca - f and hca - p with high and low lymphatic metastasis potential , respectively .
the data showed that the lymph node metastasis rate was decreased from 36 % to 0 % after upregulation of annexin a7 in hca - p cells , but it increased from 77 % to 100 % after downregulation of annexin a7 expression in hca - f cells .
thus , the in vivo data implied that annexin a7 may play an important role in hcc lymphatic metastasis and play a tumor suppressor function in hcc .
a previous study has shown that annexin a7 expression is lost in metastatic and local recurrent hormone - refractory prostate cancer compared to primary tumors [ 10 ] .
srivastava et al. reported the knockout of the annexin a7 gene in mice to investigate the involvement of annexin a7 in ca2 + signaling in secreting pancreatic beta cells and its function in the control of cancer development [ 11,12 ] .
annexin a7 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in hormone - relevant prostate and breast cancers [ 10 - 15 ] .
in prostate cancer , annexin a7 as a tumor suppressor could be through inhibition of pathologic androgen signaling and dysfunctional retinoblastoma 1 , pten , and p53 activity .
annexin a7 could also be associated with its mediation of exocytosis and secretion in prostate cells and possibly in other cancers [ 14 ] .
in addition , haplo - insufficiency of annexin a7 expression appears to drive disease progression to cancer because the genomic instability could lead to a discrete signaling pathway to reduce expression of the other tumor suppressor genes , dna - repair genes , or apoptosis - related genes [ 12 ] .
some work regarding annexin a7 from our laboratory clearly showed that the annexin a7 gene is associated with lymph node metastasis and progression of hcc [ 5 - 7,16 - 19 ] .
however , the tumor suppressor mechanisms of annexin a7 in hcc have not yet been elucidated .
future studies will investigate annexin a7 expression ex vivo before annexin a7 expression is used to control hcc progression in the clinic .
immunohistochemistry experiments showed that the subcellular localization of annexin a7 protein in both the primary and lymph node - metastasized tumors was mainly in the cytosol , with some in the nuclei and cell membrane ; while the level of annexin a7 expression in the tumors was associated with their metastasis potential .
our current study demonstrated that the subcellular localization of annexin a7 protein may be involved with lymph node metastasis of hcc .
meanwhile , asma et al. found that annexin a7 protein can be localized in the cytosol , on the cell membrane , or on the cytoskeleton [ 17 ] .
furthermore , rick et al. detected both of the annexin a7 isoforms ( 47 kda and 51 kda ) in a diabetes - related animal model .
diabetic wild - type animals showed reduced levels of the 47 kda protein isoform .
during brain development , annexin a7 expression changes from the cytoplasm to the nuclei , and the subcellular distribution of annexin a7 protein depends on the cell type in the adult central nervous system [ 20 ] .
in this study , we found that annexin a7 expression was different in metastasized lymph nodes and primeval tumor cells derived from hca - p and hca - f cells .
this disparity illustrates that the annexin a7 gene plays an important role in high and low lymph node metastasis .
this result was supported by a study that disclosed that the loss of annexin a7 is an important factor in distant metastasis of gastric cancer [ 21 ] .
in addition , altered expression of annexin a7 could affect the tumor stage and survival in hormone - refractory human prostate and breast cancers [ 22 - 24 ] .
molecularly , annexin a7 can regulate cellular exocytosis [ 25,26 ] , and the latter event was associated with tumorigenesis [ 27 ] .
annexin a7 can also modulate neoangiogenesis and tumor invasiveness through its involvement in vegfr1 signaling [ 28 ] .
ras proteins control at least three crucial signaling networks , including anchorage independence , survival , and proliferation protein dysregulated pathways , such as annexin a7 [ 29 ] .
annexin a7 can translocate from the cytoplasm to the cellular membrane in cultured cells after damage , apoptosis , and treatment with ca2 + - ionophore [ 30 ] .
the 47 kda isoform of annexin a7 is expressed in astrocyte - derived c6 rat glioblastoma cells , which is in contrast to human brain tissues [ 31 ] .
both isoforms appear in red blood cells , heart muscle , and the brain [ 31 - 35 ] ; different isoforms with a tissue - specific distribution may indicate different functions of annexin a7 [ 34 ] .
our experiments showed that both the 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms of annexin a7 occurred in hepatocarcinoma tissues .
in hca - f cells with a high metastasis potential , the 47 kda isoform was abundant ; whereas in hca - p cells with a low metastasis potential , the 51 kda isoform was dominant .
in addition , the expression of the 47 kda and 51 kda isoforms varied over time ; thus , these data suggest that both isoforms play different roles in hcc progression .
afterwards , we detected annexin a7 expression in mouse xenografts from primary and secondary tumors and found that the expression levels of annexin a7 in tumors were reversely associated with their metastasis potential , indicating that annexin a7 does play a role in suppression of tumor metastasis in vivo .
these data demonstrate that annexin a7 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in hepatocarcinoma and could be further evaluated as a novel therapeutic target for hepatocarcinoma .
in summary , our current data demonstrate that the dysregulation of annexin a7 is an important factor associated with lymph node metastasis of hcc .
further mechanistic studies will provide more insight into annexin a7 tumor suppressor function for potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses .
conclusion in summary , our study indicated that annexin a7 expression was able to inhibit hcc lymph node metastasis , indicating that the annexin a7 gene might play an important role in the process of tumor lymph node metastases .

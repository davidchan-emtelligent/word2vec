objective patients' unawareness of their cancer diagnosis ( puaw ) and their tendency for non - disclosure ( ttnd ) to relatives leads to a lack of cancer visibility among familial networks .
lack of familial cancer visibility could affect the accuracy of family cancer history ( fch ) reports .
in this study , we investigated familial cancer visibility and its potential determinants .
patients and methods a sample of patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis was interviewed .
participants were asked about their number of relatives , number of their relatives who are aware about the cancer diagnosis , and the number of relatives from whom they intended to conceal their diagnosis .
puaw was also assessed .
point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap technique .
multivariate analyses were conducted using mixed poisson and logistic regression analyses .
results a total of 415 participants with a mean age of 53 +/ - 15 years and a male to female ratio of 0.53 were enrolled in this study .
the rates of puaw , ttnd , and familial cancer visibility in the total sample were 0.20 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.16 , 0.24 ) , 0.16 ( 95 % ci : 0.12 , 0.19 ) , and 0.86 ( 95 % ci : 0.83 , 0.89 ) , respectively .
puaw ( adjusted rate ratio ( rr ) = 1.32 , 95 % ci : 1.27 , 1.38 ) , ttnd ( rr = 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.91 , 0.93 ) , and the patients' gender ( rr = 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.82 , 0.95 ) were the most important determinants of familial cancer visibility .
conclusion familial cancer visibility may be a point of concern among the iranian population .
self - reported cancer histories and fchs may have low sensitivities ( not exceeding 80 % and 86 % , respectively ) in this population .
however , these estimates may vary across different societies , because of societal and cultural contexts .

introduction family cancer history ( fch ) reports are a frequently used data source in epidemiological studies [ 1 - 3 ] .
they are also crucial in genetic risk assessments and predictive models when making referrals for genetic counseling and inherited cancer risk categorization [ 4 - 7 ] .
although fchs are widely used and dozens of studies have examined their precision , the accuracy of fch is still a subject of controversy [ 8 - 12 ] .
recent evidence has shown that , because of misreporting on fchs , risk prediction models ( such as brcapro ) could underestimate the risk of a mutation in the brca1 / brca2 genes for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [ 13 , 14 ] .
clinicians , genetic consultants , and preventive specialists have the responsibility to accurately detect inherited cancer risks and encourage familial information transmission [ 15 ] .
therefore , in order to improve fch accuracy , we need to identify its determinants .
although the evidence has shown a high specificity for fchs [ 16 ] , reported values for the sensitivity of fchs vary widely ( from 36 to 92 percent ) [ 8 , 16 , 17 ] .
therefore , fch reports mainly suffer from false negatives ( fn ) rather than false positives .
a fn fch may be due to a lack of accuracy in patient self - reports , a lack of awareness about his / her relative 's cancer diagnosis , and a lack of closeness to the affected relative , as well as the patients' recall bias , age , and gender [ 9 , 16 , 18 ] .
the accuracy of self - reporting has been addressed in several studies and self - reports are often compared to medical records or cancer registry data ( the gold standards ) [ 19 - 21 ] .
in addition , a recent study by inoue et al .
[ 22 ] reported an overall fn rate of 47 % for self - reported cancer history .
an fn self - report may be the result of the patients' unawareness about her / his cancer diagnosis ( puaw ) or recall bias [ 19 - 21 , 23 , 24 ] .
puaw , in turn , is the result of a physician 's reticence to give patients their diagnosis .
therefore , non - disclosure to patients might be a distal determinant of fch accuracy .
in order to examine the factors associated with lack of fch accuracy , we mapped a web of known determinants .
the hypothesized factor , tendency for non - disclosure ( ttnd ) , was incorporated into the web ( fig 1 ) .
the tendency for non - disclosure ( ttnd ) of a given patient represents the tendency of a patient to not disclose her / his cancer to relatives , which is the result of cultural issues such as cancer stigmatization or desire to protect loved ones [ 25 - 27 ] .
therefore , we believe that the tendency for non - disclosure ( ttnd ) may be a determinant of lack of fch accuracy .

solid line box : previously reported determinants .
dashed arrow : potential association .
long dash - dotted line box : what we investigated in this study .
dashed line box : hypothetical determinants social scientists believe that the ttnd results in a visibility bias for population size estimation efforts [ 28 , 29 ] .
this bias causes us to underestimate the size of hard - to - count populations [ 30 ] .
inspired by sociologists' jargon , a fn fch may be the result of lack of familial cancer visibility ( fcv ) .
sociologists use a bias correction factor to compensate for the visibility bias which is dependent on the societal and cultural context [ 28 , 29 ] .
despite the abundance of evidence regarding the lack of fch sensitivity , widespread usage is common and it is unclear how we can improve the accuracy of fch .
therefore , we conducted this study to investigate familial cancer visibility ( fcv ) as a potential determinant of fch sensitivity in an iranian population and to assess the hypothetical determinants of familial cancer visibility ( fcv ) including patients' unawareness about her / his cancer diagnosis ( puaw ) and ttnd .
methods study population this cross - sectional study was part of an ongoing study in iran ( kcrnsu : assessing the completeness of case ascertainment of the kerman cancer registry using the network scale - up method ) .
the main study was designed to use the network scale - up method to assess the completeness of case ascertainment of a cancer registry in a middle - sized province in kerman , iran .
patients who had a confirmed malignancy ( e.g. , breast , colorectal , lung , leukemia , lymphoma , kidney , gastric , esophagus , ovarian , uterine , eye , sarcoma , laryngeal , liver , skin , bone marrow , thyroid , brain , bladder , testicular , bile duct , prostate or pancreatic ) with the ability to speak persian were eligible to participate in the study .
a representative sample of oncology centers in kerman was selected , including the six referral centers with the highest number of patient visits .
in each center , all eligible patients were referred to our interviewers by the receptionist .
sampling was conducted during working hours in august 2014 .
data collection & measurements data were collected after obtaining informed verbal consent via a face - to - face , structured interview conducted in a private room near the sampling site .
informed consent was obtained verbally because iranians are frequently reluctant to provide written consent .
if the patient consented , the verbal consent checkbox was checked by the interviewer after informing eligible patients about the study , its aims , and the study questions .
all ethical considerations , including obtaining verbal consent , were approved by the ethical committee of kerman university of medical sciences as part of approval for the kcrnsu study ( kmu 9350 ) .
all interviewers were trained in a workshop that included a role - playing interview component .
interviewees were either patients or , in cases where the patient was unaware of her / his cancer diagnosis , the most informed caregiver .
if the caregiver was the interviewee , then he / she was questioned on behalf of the patient .
two questions , one for the patient 's doctor and one for the caregiver , were used to assess patients' unawareness about her / his cancer diagnosis ( puaw ) .
if one or both of them answered " no , the patient is not aware of his / her cancer ," that patient was coded as unaware .
interviews were gender - matched for genital cancers and for female respondents who were younger than 40 .
interviews lasted around ten to fifteen minutes .
to assess fcv and ttnd , an interview form was designed and validated for this study .
the first section introduced the study and its aims while the second assessed puaw , type of cancer , date of current cancer diagnosis , patients' age , gender , marital status , and medical record code .
the third section examined kinship relations using a table with relationships listed in the rows ( i.e. , descent or affinity ( related by marriage ) groups : parents , siblings and their spouses , children , grandparents , aunts and their spouses , uncles and their spouses , nephews , nieces , first cousins , spouse and his / her first - degree relatives ) .
table columns included the " number of living relatives ," " number of surely informed relatives ," and " number of relatives who are intended to be left uninformed. " this section was modified from the standard method for visibility bias estimation [ 29 ] .
section four assessed the patients' type of residence , monthly income , and tumor - node - metastasis ( tnm ) staging information .
data regarding the date of diagnosis and tnm staging of the current tumor were extracted from medical records by the patients' oncologist .
the interview form was used in three sequential pilot studies , and several minor corrections were made regarding its validity .
its test - retest reliability was assessed around the one - month interval by 26 participants ( r : mean = 0.73 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.69 , 0.76 ) .
despite an incentive ($ 6.50 ) for the retest interview , the participation rate was 0.60 .
data management & statistical methods we calculated " time from diagnosis " using the date of the diagnosis and the interview date .
fcv was estimated using the following formula : fcv =" number of living and surely informed relatives "" number of all living relatives " ( 1 ) ttnd was defined according to the following formula : ttnd =" number of living relatives who were intended to be left uninformed "" number of all living relatives " ( 2 ) the proportion of puaw , fcv , and ttnd as well as the 95 % cis were computed using the bootstrap method with 1000 resamplings .
these proportions were also estimated across different subgroups based on their potential determinants .
two or k - proportion comparison tests were used for the univariate analysis .
to model potential determinants of puaw , a mixed effects logistic regression analysis was used .
mixed effects poisson regression was used for modeling of the fcv and ttnd determinants .
in both poisson and logistic regression models , cancer type was included as a random intercept factor .
to assess the significance effect of cancer type , we estimated median odds ratio ( mor ) or median incidence rate ratio ( mirr ) for the intercept - only models as well as for the final models .
all variables with a p - value less than 0.3 in the univariate analyses entered the multivariate model .
however , those with a p - value greater than 0.05 were eliminated using a backward approach and only those with a p - value less than 0.05 were kept in the model .
the stability of the models was checked using the bootstrap technique .
the data analysis was conducted using stata software ( version 11.2 ; statacorp , texas , usa ) .
results participant characteristics a total of 415 cancer patients were enrolled in the study .
participants had a mean age of 53 years ( standard deviation ( sd ) = 15 years ) and 65.5 % ( n = 272 ) were female while 34.5 % ( n = 143 ) were male .
eighty - one percent ( n = 331 ) were from an urban area and 19 % ( n = 84 ) were from rural areas .
the majority of participants ( 93.3 %) were married ( table 1 ) .
males were approximately 5 years older than females ( p < 0.001 ) .
time from diagnosis varied from 0.1 to 280 months ( mean = 28.2 , sd = 40 , median = 12 ) .
time from diagnosis was significantly longer for females than males ( mean = 32 , sd = 44 and mean = 21 , sd = 28 , respectively , p = 0.009 ) .

patients' unawareness about their cancer ( puaw ) twenty percent ( 95 % ci : 16 % , 24 %) of all patients were unaware of their cancer diagnosis .
the rate of unawareness varied widely ( from 5.6 % ( 95 % ci : 2 % , 9 %) for breast cancer to 62.5 % ( 95 % ci : 51 % , 74 %) for gastric cancer ) .
males were more likely to be unaware than females ( puaw : 27.3 % , 95 % ci : 20 , 35 ; and 16.2 % , 95 % ci : 12 , 21 , respectively ; p = 0.64 ) .
in the univariate analysis , the stage of tumor at diagnosis ( p = 0.022 ) , time from diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) , metastasis of tumor ( p = 0.030 ) , type of cancer ( p < 0.001 ) , and age ( p < 0.001 ) were associated with puaw .
puaw had no association with the patient 's monthly income or marital status ( p = 0.32 and 0.299 , respectively ; table 1 ) .
there was no significant difference in unawareness between patients from rural and urban areas ( p = 0.90 ; table 1 ) .
in the adjusted multivariate model , age ( crude odds ratio ( or ) = 0.71 , 95 % ci : 0.62 , 0.82 ; adjusted or = 0.71 , 95 % ci : 0.62 , 0.82 ) and cancer type ( crude mor = 2.16 ; adjusted mor = 2.04 ; p < 0.0001 ) were significantly associated with puaw .
the patients' tendency for non - disclosure to relatives ( ttnd ) the data showed that the patients tended to withhold disclosure of their cancer from up to 16 % ( 95 % ci : 11.7 , 19.4 ) of their relatives ( table 2 ) .
females tended to withhold disclosure more than males ( ttnd = 17 % , 95 % ci : 12.3 , 22.3 and ttnd = 12 % , 95 % ci : 6.9 , 17.5 , respectively ) , and the lowest ttnd was reported for spouses ( ttnd = 4 % , 95 % ci : 1.7 , 5.4 ) , children ( ttnd = 8 % , 95 % ci : 5.1 , 11.3 ) , parents ( ttnd = 13 % , 95 % ci : 7.9 , 13.1 ) , and siblings ( ttnd = 13 % , 95 % ci : 9.5 , 17.0 ) .
patients with lymphoma ( ttnd = 27 % , 95 % ci : 10.6 , 43.7 ) or colorectal cancer ( ttnd = 21 % , 95 % ci : 5.0 , 37.1 ) reported a higher ttnd .
younger participants ( up to 39 years ) reported a higher ttnd ( 22 % , 95 % ci : 11.9 , 30.9 ) than middle - aged ( 14 % , 95 % ci : 9.4 , 13.3 ) or elderly ( 12 % , 95 % ci : 6.5 , 16.6 ; table 2 ) participants .

++ age groups : 0 - 39 , 40 - 60 , 60 + familial cancer visibility ( fcv ) we collected data on fcv from 27,998 relatives of cancer patients ( including 3763 first - degree relatives , 8118 second - degree , 10,201 third - degree , and 5916 affinities ) .
fcv for the total sample was estimated at 86 % ( 95 % ci : 83 , 89 ) .
the rate of fcv for males and females was 83 % ( 95 % ci : 77 , 88 ) and 87 % ( 95 % ci : 84 , 91 ) , respectively ( table 2 ) .
cancer was more visible in middle - aged patients ( fcv = 88 % , 95 % ci : 84 , 92 ) than younger ( fcv = 83 % , 95 % ci : 76 , 89 ) or older ( fcv = 85 % , 95 % ci : 81 , 89 ) patients .
if patients were unaware of their diagnosis , visibility decreased from 89 % ( 95 % ci : 86 , 92 ) to 69 % ( 95 % ci : 60 , 78 ; table 2 ) .
cancer was less visible for parents ( fcv = 77 % , 95 % ci : 71 , 83 ) and more visible for siblings ( fcv = 90 % , 95 % ci : 87 , 93 ) , children ( fcv = 91 % , 95 % ci : 88 , 94 ) , and spouses ( fcv = 90 % , 95 % ci : 87 , 93 ) .
fcv was not significantly different between second ( fcv = 85 % , 95 % ci : 82 , 89 ) and third - degree relatives ( fcv = 85 % , 95 % ci : 81 , 89 ) or affinities ( fcv = 86 % , 95 % ci : 83 , 89 ) .
data shows that a longer time from diagnosis may lead to more fcv ( p = 0.57 ) .
breast ( fcv = 88 % , 95 % ci : 83 , 92 ) and lung ( fcv = 83 % , 95 % ci : 75 , 95 ) cancers were meaningfully more visible than colorectal ( fcv = 79 % , 95 % ci : 66 , 93 ) cancer ( table 2 ) .
fcv was not significantly associated with the relatives' gender , gender matching of patients and relatives , stage of cancer , tumor metastasis , type of residency ( rural or urban ) , the patient 's monthly income , or type of kinship ( affinity or descent ) at a 0.3 significance level ( results not shown ) .
therefore , these variables were not included in the multivariate model .
puaw had an rr of 1.32 ( 95 % ci , 1.27 , 1.38 ) in the final multivariate model .
closeness of relationship ( rr = 0.96 , 95 % ci : 0.93 , 0.99 ) , patient 's gender ( rr = 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.89 , 0.95 ) , and age group ( rr = 1.03 , 95 % ci : 1.01 , 1.05 ) as well as ttnd ( rr = 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.91 , 0.93 ) were significantly associated with fcv after being adjusted for other potential determinants ( table 3 ) .
discussion in this study we focused on familial cancer visibility ( fcv ) as a major distal determinant of family cancer history ( fch ) sensitivity .
our data showed that the rates of patients' unawareness about her / his cancer diagnosis ( puaw ) , tendency for non - disclosure ( ttnd ) to relatives , and fcv were 20 % ( 95 % ci : 16 , 24 ) , 16 % ( 95 % ci : 11.7 , 19.4 ) , and 86 % ( 95 % ci : 83 , 89 ) , respectively .
puaw and ttnd were significantly associated with fcv in our dataset ( p < 0.0001 ) .
fcv was also associated with cancer type ( p < 0.0001 ) , and closeness of relationship ( very close vs. distant , p = 0.041 ) , as well as patient 's age ( p = 0.004 ) , and gender ( p < 0.0001 ) .
our estimated puaw value was meaningfully less than the values stated in some previous reports , which range from 29 % to 60 % [ 31 - 33 ] , while relatively similar to values found in other reports [ 34 , 35 ] .
the puaw value found in this study may be affected by our conservative puaw measurement and the distribution of our sample .
given that puaw is higher in end - stage and older cancer patients , and that participation in our study was not restricted to terminal or older cancer patients , the puaw value found in our study may be lower than the values found for older , end - stage patients [ 32 - 37 ] .
to our knowledge , this is the first study that has quantitatively assessed non - disclosure of cancer diagnosis to relatives , what we refer to as ttnd .
despite using a different methodology , our results are consistent with results of available qualitative studies on ttnd [ 26 , 27 ] .
for example , multivariate results showed that women tended to conceal their cancer diagnosis from relatives more than men ( rr = 0.87 ; 95 % ci : 0.76 , 0.99 ) , which supports qualitative results .
however , this contradicts gender stereotypes ( i.e. , that women are more expressive than men ) and may be because of the conventions of the iranian society and more perceived stigma .
when we compared our estimated values for ttnd and puaw for different cancer types ( i.e. breast cancer and gastric cancer ( puaw = 94.4 % , 95 % ci : 91 , 98 and puaw = 37.5 % , 95 % ci : 19.9 , 55.2 , respectively ) , we showed that the effect of cancer type on puaw and ttnd might be correlated with public attitudes concerning the curability of various cancers .
this supports findings from other studies , such as the study by yoshinaga et al .
[ 38 ] .
again , as far as we know , this study is the first effort to estimate fcv .
given that people cannot report what they are unaware of , the estimated fcv might be interpreted as maximum sensitivity of fchs in kerman .
in iran , disclosure to cancer patients is not the responsibility of physicians alone .
families and caregivers play central roles for disclosure or non - disclosure to patients and relatives [ 39 ] .
in light of the central roles that families and caregivers play , the relationship between fcv and puaw may be because a considerable proportion of families try their best to conceal cancer diagnoses from relatives in order to protect the patient from indirect disclosure .
therefore , in such families , there would be less visibility among the relatives than in families with aware patients .
though it may be assumed that ttnd and fcv are highly correlated , the obtained correlation in this study was - 11 % ( 95 % cl : 9 , 13 %) .
this weak correlation may be associated with cultural issues in the iranian society .
information can be transmitted in two ways in iranian families , including direct and indirect methods .
during direct transmission , patients or their caregivers disclose the cancer diagnosis to relatives .
direct transmission occurs for two reasons : one , because of individual inner desires , or two , to attract financial support or other cultural incentives ( regardless of inner desire ) .
on the other hand , indirect transmission occurs when information is transmitted from those who are aware to those whom the patients or their caregivers did not intend to disclose the disease .
therefore , the association of fcv and ttnd might be explained by direct information transmission .
the results of our study regarding the dependency of fcv on cancer type ( mirr = 1.07 , p < 0.0001 ) may be explained by stigmatization .
however , although stigmatization may partially explain the relationship , our results are also consistent with previous studies regarding the dependency of fch sensitivity on cancer type .
for example , studies have reported high sensitivity for breast cancer , moderate sensitivity for colorectal cancer , and low sensitivity for prostate and uterine cancers [ 40 , 41 ] .
these findings are consistent with our estimated fcvs .
in addition , even after adjusting for confounders , fcv was lower for males than for females ( rr = 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.89 , 0.95 ) .
this may be because men think they should conceal their weaknesses or illnesses to protect themselves and their loved ones [ 27 ] .
another possible explanation may be residual confounding caused by lower puaw in male patients .
we also found a lower fcv in younger patients ( rr = 1.03 , 95 % ci : 1.01 , 1.05 ) that might decrease the accuracy and usability of fchs .
given that numerous studies have shown that a diagnosis of cancer in younger relatives is more important for fch than a diagnosis of cancer in older relatives , more precise investigations are needed .
in our study , fcv was highest for first - degree relatives ( fdrs ) ( fcv = 88 % , 95 % ci : 86 , 90 ) .
this finding was consistent with the findings for fch sensitivity .
almost all previous studies have reported a better sensitivity for fch in fdrs rather than second or third degree relatives [ 42 , 43 ] .
limitations the primary limitation of our study was the result of a lower consent rate for men for participation in this study .
more female participation led to a higher frequency of female - organ cancers ( e.g. , breast cancer ) .
therefore , the estimated fcv for the total sample was possibly affected by the participant sex - ratio ( males = 143 ; females = 272 ) .
accordingly , there is a possibility of fcv overestimation .
to account for this possible overestimation , we used sampling weights extracted from kerman cancer registry to weight cancer types .
there was no meaningful difference ( 86 % vs. 85.5 %) between estimates from analytic or sampling weights ; therefore , we presented those provided by analytic weights .
in addition , given the abovementioned participant sex ratio , the overall puaw may be underestimated .
consequently , in this study , the overall puaw may be underestimated because of a lower puaw in females .
furthermore , we did not confirm interviewee claims regarding the awareness ( informed or uninformed ) of her / his relatives .
although four questions collecting contact information for patient relatives were originally included in the questionnaires , we omitted these questions from the finalized version since it was not feasible to collect relatives' contact information in a pilot study .
however , we used a standardized , validated method that has been used in previous sociological studies .
finally , given the lack of a robust cancer registry or a complete archive of medical records , it was not possible for us to confirm fchs .
accordingly , we were unable to directly estimate the effect size of puaw , fcv , or ttnd on fch sensitivity .
conclusion the maximum sensitivity of the self - reported cancer histories and fchs in the kermanian population is not likely to be higher than 80 % and 86 % , respectively .
this finding might be generalizable to similar populations , given the values of puaw and ttnd .
our study suggests that improving disclosure to relatives and taking fchs from close relatives may improve fch sensitivity .

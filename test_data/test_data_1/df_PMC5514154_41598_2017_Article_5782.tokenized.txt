angiogenesis , new vessel formation from pre - existing vessels , is a highly conserved event through vertebrates .
however , the system for tuning angiogenesis by species - intrinsic factors is totally unknown .
mir - 1224 is a member of mammal - specific mirtrons , which were identified as non - canonical micrornas .
we found that the expression of mir - 1224 was upregulated in capillary - like tube - forming human umbilical vein endothelial cells on matrigel .
enforced expression of mir - 1224 stimulated tube formation , whereas repression of endogenous mir - 1224 inhibited formation .
enforced expression of mir - 1224 enhanced vegf signaling and repressed notch signaling .
the adaptor protein of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , epsin2 , which has been shown to be a suppressor of angiogenesis , was a direct target of mir - 1224 .
knockdown of epn2 stimulated tube formation , while overexpression of epn2 repressed mir - 1224 - mediated stimulation .
our findings indicate that mir - 1224 is a mammal specific modulator of angiogenesis .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels .
during angiogenesis , vegf and notch signaling play key roles in angiogenic sprouting .
at angiogenic sprouts , ' tip ' cells localized at the very front of sprouts segregate from the ' stalk ' cells forming the stem of the vessel1 , 2 .
tip cells highly express vegfr2 and notch ligand dll4 .
vascular endothelial growth factor a ( vegf - a ) , a strong proangiogenic factor secreted from surrounding cells , binds to vegfr2 on endothelial cells ( ecs ) of blood vessels , inducing dimerization and autophosphorylation of vegfr23 - 5 to initiate signaling cascades6 - 8 .
vegf - a also induces the expression in ecs of delta - like ligand 4 ( dll4 ) , which suppresses sprouting by activating notch on adjacent cells as its ligand9 , 10 , to form the stalk cells via reducing vegfr2 expression .
thus , increased vegf signaling enhances sprouting activity of ecs , while notch signaling stabilizes ecs .
these are highly conserved systems among species .
signals of vegf - a and notch are controlled by clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
upon binding to vegf - a , vegfr2 undergoes clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is regulated by an endosomal trafficking - dependent process11 , 12 .
dll4 binding to the notch - extracellular domain ( necd ) initiates the sequential proteolytic cleavages of the notch receptor , resulting in the release of the transcriptionally active notch - intracellular domain ( nicd ) into the cytosol13 , 14 .
endocytosis of necd into adjacent ligand - expressing cells is critical for nicd production15 .
epsin1 and epsin2 are involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis16 - 18 and their defects caused deregulated activation of vegf signaling .
mice with endothelial cell - specific deletion of both epsins have shown reduced tumor growth with overproduction of nonfunctional vessels19 .
inhibitory peptides for the interaction between vegfr2 and epsins stimulated angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo 20 .
micrornas are a class of endogenous , noncoding small rnas ( 18 - 24 nucleotides ) that work for the post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression .
maturation of canonical mirnas is mediated by two rnase iii endonucleases : dicer21 - 23 and drosha24 - 26 .
after maturation , mirnas bind by pairing to the 3'utr of mrnas , leading to either translational repression or degradation of the target mrna27 - 29 .
the 5 ' region of micrornas ( seed sequence ) is important for the pairing .
mirtrons are derived from short hairpin introns and bypass drosha cleavage by using the spliceosome to generate their precursors ( pri - mirnas ) 30 , 31 and mirtrons have often evolved in species - specific ways31 - 34 .
mir - 1224 is a mammalian mirtron encompassed in the last intron of von willebrand factor a domain containing 5b2 ( vwa5b2 ) gene , and its function has been shown only in macrophages35 .
in this study , we found a proangiogenic function of mir - 1224 in in vitro angiogenesis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) and epsin2 as a direct target of mir - 1224 , providing a novel player for angiogenic modulation specific to particular mammals .
results mir - 1224 expression is upregulated during in vitro tube formation angiogenesis is an evolutionarily conserved event driven by highly conserved angiogenic factors .
mirnas are relatively new biological regulators and their expression level could modulate the expression of basic angiogenic regulators .
therefore , we examined the mirna expression profile during angiogenesis by microarray analysis to uncover a modulatory function of mirnas for general angiogenesis .
huvecs form capillary - like structures called tubes when cultured on plates coated with matrigel , an extracellular matrix secreted from mouse sarcoma cells. by comparing the mirna signatures of p - huvec ( huvecs grown on regular culture plates ) and m - huvec ( huvecs grown on matrigel - coated plates ) , we found that 56 mirnas were upregulated more than four - fold ( table s1 ) .
several of them have been reported to be involved in ec functions ( mir - 13936 and mir - 66337 , 38 ) or in angiogenesis ( mir - 48339 , mir - 70840 , mir - 20541 and mir - 29642 ) .
interestingly , three mirtrons ( mir - 877 , mir - 1224 , mir - 1225 ) were included .
these mirtrons are conserved in a mammalian - specific way33 , raising the possibility that these mirtrons have modulating functions during mammalian angiogenesis .
as none of these mirtrons has been reported to regulate any endothelial or angiogenic function , they are potentially novel proangiogenic mirnas .
unfortunately , we found mir - 1225 was hardly detected in northern blot analysis despite of high level of signal intensity in microarray analysis .
therefore , we started with mir - 1224 in this study among the rest of two to elucidate the regulation of vessel formation by mammalian - specific mirtrons .
first , we validated the increased expression of mir - 1224 after tube formation .
mir - 1224 was detected at the expected size (~ 22nt ) by northern blot analysis , and its signal intensity was 3.7 - fold stronger in m - huvec than in p - huvec ( fig. 1a ) .
the quantitative analysis of mature mir - 1224 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qrt - pcr ) further confirmed that mir - 1224 expression was several - fold higher at 24 hours after culture onset on matrigel compared to that at one hour after onset ( fig. 1b ) .
the upregulation of mir - 1224 was further confirmed by measuring post - transcriptional silencing activity using reporter constructs .
the renilla - luciferase " sensor " reporter containing two complementary sites for mir - 1224 was transfected into huvecs .
they were subsequently cultured on either culture plates or matrigel - coated plates .
this analysis revealed that the expression from the reporter containing mir - 1224 target sites was repressed in m - huvec compared to the expression in p - huvec , indicating that functional mir - 1224 was actually upregulated in m - huvec ( fig. 1c ) .

mir - 1224 stimulates in vitro angiogenesis increased expression of mir - 1224 in m - huvec suggested that mir - 1224 positively regulated in vitro tube formation .
to verify this , huvecs were transfected with a mir - 1224 mimic and then cultured on matrigel .
capillary - like network formation was clearly enhanced in the mir - 1224 - transfected cells , compared to the control mimic - transfected cells .
the number of branches of microvessels in the mir - 1224 - transfected cells increased by approximately two - fold compared to that in the control mimic - transfected cells ( fig. 2a ) .
conversely , tube formation was inhibited following the transfection of mir - 1224 - tough decoy ( tud ) 43 , which is a double - stranded rna oligonucleotide designed to bind to and inhibit endogenous mir - 1224 molecules ( fig. 2b ) .
the activity of the transfected exogenous mir mimic or tud was examined using the sensor plasmids .
the decrease in the luciferase activity in the control mimic or tud - transfected cells indicates endogenous mir - 1224 activity .
much further decrease in the mir - 1224 mimic - transfected cells was observed compared to the control mimic and significant increase was observed in the tud - mir - 1224 - transfected cells , confirming that both mir - 1224 mimic and tud - mir - 1224 functionally control the mir - 1224 activity in the cells ( fig. 2 ) .
taken together , these results indicate that mir - 1224 stimulates tube formation in vitro .

mir - 1224 modulates notch / vegf signaling next , to explore the mechanism by which mir - 1224 stimulates tube formation , we examined the influence of increased mir - 1224 expression on major angiogenic signaling through vegf and notch .
in cultured human ecs , activation of notch signaling has been shown to inhibit new sprout formation and migration9 , 10 .
the activation of notch signaling leads to a proteolytic cleavage to release nicd into the cytoplasm .
nicd translocates to the nucleus and mediates the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in vascular development .
to explore whether mir - 1224 affects ec behavior by modulating notch , the level of nicd was assessed by intracellular flow cytometry using an antibody specifically recognizing nicd .
it revealed a significant decrease of nicd in mir - 1224 - transfected cells compared to control cells ( fig. 3a ) .
consistently , expression of notch target genes , hes1 and hey144 , 45 , was downregulated in mir - 1224 - transfected huvecs ( fig. 3b ) .
these results indicated that notch signaling was negatively regulated by mir - 1224 .

to evaluate the effects of the decrease in notch activity on the stimulatory activity of mir - 1224 to tube formation , huvecs were cultured on matrigel in the presence of dapt , a gamma - secretase inhibitor .
dapt stimulated tube formation in the control mimic - transfected cells .
in the mir - 1224 - transfected cells , tube formation was stimulated in the absence of dapt and no further stimulation was observed in the presence of dapt suggesting that the stimulatory function of mir - 1224 was replaced by notch inhibition to a similar extent ( fig. 3c ) .
vegfr2 is the main signal transducer of vegf for angiogenesis .
therefore , it was also possible that activated vegfr2 was elevated by mir - 1224 expression in huvecs .
to investigate this , mir - 1224 - transfected huvecs were starved for 12 hours followed by treatment with vegf , and phosphorylated vegfr2 was analyzed by immunoblotting ( fig. 3d ) .
vegfr2 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced at 5 and 10 minutes after stimulation in mir - 1224 - transfectants .
to examine the functional relevance of the vegfr2 activation by mir - 1224 , the tube formation assay was performed in the presence of vegfr2 specific inhibitor ki8751 .
the stimulation by mir - 1224 was suppressed in the presence of ki8751 .
these results indicate that mir - 1224 stimulated the tube formation through vegfr2 activation ( fig. 3e ) .
in total , mir - 1224 suppressed the notch signal pathway and activated vegf signaling to regulate tube formation .
epn2 mrna is a direct target of mir - 1224 in order to determine the target genes responsible for mir - 1224 - induced upregulation of the tube formation , we predicted the target genes of mir - 1224 in silico using two sequence - based target prediction software programs , miranda and targetscan .
each program yielded a large number of genes as possible mir - 1224 targets .
the 162 candidate genes commonly predicted by both methods were listed ( table s2 ) .
among them , epn2 was particularly interesting to us for two reasons .
first , the double - inactivation of endothelial epn1 and epn2 resulted in elevated and prolonged vegfr2 phosphorylation as well as in the stabilization of vegfr2 protein , leading to heightened vegf / vegfr2 signaling and excessive tumor angiogenesis in mice 17 , 46 .
second , it has been shown that inactivation of epn1 and epn2 resulted in decreased notch signaling in in vivo knockout experiments47 .
our observations in fig. 3 are highly reminiscent of these previous reports , suggesting that mir - 1224 might target the epn2 mrna and downregulate its expression .
to explore whether mir - 1224 regulates the endogenous epn2 , huvecs were transfected with a control mimic or mir - 1224 mimic , and endogenous epn2 expression was assessed .
as expected , the introduction of mir - 1224 mimic to huvecs resulted in significant (~ 50 %) downregulation of epn2 mrna as well as epn2 protein ( fig. 4a and b ) .

next , we asked whether endogenous epn2 expression was suppressed in m - huvec where mir - 1224 was upregulated .
both mrna and protein levels of epn2 were downregulated in m - huvec compared to p - huvec ( fig. 4c and d ) .
these observations were consistent with the notion that elevated expression of mir - 1224 , as shown in fig. 1 , caused the suppression of epn2 expression in m - huvec .
the target sequence of mir - 1224 was identified in many mammalian epn2 genes ( fig. 4e ) .
to determine whether mir - 1224 directly regulates epn2 expression , fragments from the 3 ' - utr of human epn2 and mouse epn2 were cloned downstream from a renilla - luciferase gene in reporter plasmids .
mir - 1224 overexpression repressed the luciferase activity both of the reporter plasmid containing the 3 ' - utr fragment of human epn2 or mouse epn2 gene but not the control empty reporter .
furthermore , point mutations of the seed - matched sequence prevented repression by mir - 1224 .
these results indicated that both human and mouse epn2 mrnas are direct targets of mir - 1224 through binding to the seed - matched sequences in the 3 ' - utrs .
taken together , these observations suggested that mir - 1224 negatively regulates epn2 expression by directly targeting its 3 ' - utr .
knockdown of epn2 enhances in vitro angiogenesis to determine whether the reduced expression of epn2 , likely caused by elevated expression of mir - 1224 , could contribute to the stimulation of tube formation in our experiments , epn2 and epn1 expression was knocked down by small interfering rna ( sirna ) independently or together in huvecs ( fig. 5a ) .
since mouse epn1 and epn2 were reported to have complementary roles47 , a single knockdown of human epn2 was assumed to have no effects .
however , capillary networking was unexpectedly stimulated by a single knockdown of epn2 ( fig. 5b ) , indicating epn2 by itself had a significant suppressive function .
combined knockdown of epn1 and epn2 stimulated tube formation more than either epn1 or epn2 single knockdown , which is consistent with in vivo knockout experiments47 ( fig. 5a and b ) .

( n = 3 ) .
in order to examine that suppression of epn2 has effects on notch and vegfr signals as in mir - 1224 - transfectd cells , expression of notch target genes and the phosphorylation of vegfr2 were examined .
mrna expression of hes 1 and hey1 was significantly downregulated and the phosphorylation of vegfr2 was stimulated in siepn2 - transfected huvecs ( fig. 5c and d ) .
these results indicated that notch and vegf signals were positively and negatively regulated by epn2 , respectively .
this is consistent to the notion that the mir - 1224 's effects on these signals were mediated by suppressing its target gene epn2 .
to verify this notion , an overexpression experiment was performed next .
huvecs were transfected with mir - 1224 mimics and subsequently transduced with epn2 - or control lacz - expressing adenovirus ( ad ) vectors .
exogenous epn2 expression level was twenty - fold more than the endogenous epn2 ( fig. 5e ) .
tube formation of the control mimic - transfected cells was suppressed by transduction with the epn2 - expressing ad vector as expected .
importantly , the epn2 - expressing ad vector suppressed tube formation in mir - 1224 - transfected cells to a similar extent to control , indicating that the function of mir - 1224 was mediated by suppression of epn2 expression at least in part ( fig. 5e ) .
taken together , our studies demonstrated that : 1 ) mir - 1224 induces angiogenesis by upregulating vegf signaling and downregulating notch signaling ; 2 ) mir - 1224 promotes angiogenesis by targeting epn2 , a negative regulator of angiogenesis ; 3 ) therefore a novel modulation of angiogenesis by a species - specific mechanism , mir - 1224 / epn2 pathway , was identified .
discussion angiogenesis is a fundamental event that is required during development .
clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which regulates angiogenesis through the regulation of vegf11 , 12 and notch signals15 , is also fundamental to the regulation of the internalization and trafficking of membrane - anchored molecules .
epsins are an evolutionarily conserved protein family that facilitate clathrin - mediated internalization of ubiquitinated cell surface receptors18 , 48 - 50 .
since epsins are widely used in various processes through yeast51 to vertebrates and worms47 , 52 , 53 , and since their cargo - specificity has not been identified so far , epsins could be considered fundamental proteins that simply mediate signals from outer environments to intracellular machineries .
alternatively , specific regulation of endocytic components could affect sensitivity to environmental stimuli by regulating endocytosis of receptors and ligands at appropriate timing .
mirtrons have gained attention as an interesting tool for exploring unidentified regulatory networks .
however , because they are expressed at much lower levels than canonical mirnas , it might be expected that mirtrons have only modest roles compared to canonical mirnas54 .
however , numerous sequencing analyses have clearly shown that a number of mirtrons have been strictly conserved through evolution in a species - specific manner , as among drosophila , among mammals and even among primates30 - 34 , indicating that they have evolved for some biologically relevant functions related to species - specific characteristics .
on the other hand , their lower expression in turn suggests that mirtrons might be induced under fleeting conditions but not in a steady state , so that they could function with pinpoint accuracy rather than in homeostatic regulation .
in this study , the p - huvec showed lower expression of mir - 1224 compared with m - huvec , and the increase in mir - 1224 in either endogenous or exogenous mode was associated with a higher capacity for tube formation in these cells .
our study revealed the proangiogenic function of mir - 1224 in an in vitro system where mir - 1224 expression was induced during angiogenesis .
this finding clearly indicated that temporally regulated expression of mir - 1224 modulates basic angiogenesis .
furthermore , this finding suggested that mir - 1224 could be a specific regulator of angiogenesis depending on the expression of both mir - 1224 and targetable epn2 .
therefore , it is interesting that the targetable sequence in the 3'utr of epn2 gene seems to appear only in the species that belong to euarchontogliras in the supplementary figure s1 .
how and why the mir - 1224 / epn2 pathway was acquired in these species remains elusive .
studies on mammal - specific regulation of angiogenesis also could be valuable for the blood vessel pathology .
for example , angiogenesis plays a critical role for the onset of gestational hypertension that can lead to a serious condition called preeclampsia .
in this case , excess secretion of soluble vegfr1 and soluble endoglin from placenta suppresses the placental angiogenesis resulting in abnormal blood vessel formation and defects in blood circulation .
it is conceivable that a mammal - specific angiogenic regulation system might co - evolve with the development of placenta and be involved in its pathology .
our finding that the mir - 1224 / epn2 pathway was active during angiogenesis of umbilical veins is interesting from this point of view .
in summary , our approach to identify mirnas involved in the regulation of angiogenesis revealed that a species - specific mirtron suppressed a highly conserved endocytic adaptor molecule , epn2 , resulting in the modulation of the basic angiogenic system .
it suggested that the mir - 1224 / epn2 system might be beneficial to the specification of some characteristics of those species .
further studies in this line of research would be required to fully understand how species - specific regulation systems have been established , presumably in part by species - specific mirtrons .

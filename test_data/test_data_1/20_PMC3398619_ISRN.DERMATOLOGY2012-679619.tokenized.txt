cutaneous disorders can precede or follow the initiation of hemodialysis treatment .
we evaluated the prevalence of various dermatological manifestations in patients undergoing hemodialysis at least twice a week for minimum of three months at our center .
patients were excluded if they were undergoing hemodialysis less than twice a week or on hemodialysis secondary to esrd following graft dysfunction .
one hundred and forty - three patients were evaluated .
among them , there were 113 male and 30 females .
among the skin changes , pruritus accounted for 56 % , xerosis was observed in 52 % , diffuse blackish hyper pigmentation was seen in 40 % .
skin infections was seen in 53 % of patients , of these fungal , bacterial and viral infections were 27.2 % , 14.6 % , and 11.2 % , respectively .
kyrle 's disease was observed only in 6.9 % .
other skin manifestations include eczema 4.8 % , psoriasis 2.7 % , and drug rash 2.1 % .
nail changes were observed in 46 patients of whom 27 patients had onychomycosis .
other changes include discoloration , onycholysis , and splinter hemorrhages .
hair changes were observed in 21.7 % .
mucosal changes were seen in 27.3 % .
in our study , pruritus , xerosis , and pigmentation were higher among skin changes .
recognition and management of some of these dermatological manifestations vastly reduce the morbidity and improve the quality of life .
1. introduction chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) is a progressive loss of kidney function over a period of months or years through five stages .
the number of patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in india is increasing with an estimated annual incidence of about 100 per million populations [ 1 ] .
hemodialysis is one of the therapeutic modalities which can improve the survival in these patients [ 2 ] .
about 50 - 100 % of patients with esrd have at least one associated cutaneous change [ 3 , 4 ] .
these cutaneous disorders can precede or follow the initiation of hemodialysis treatment , and there are more chances to develop newer skin changes during the course of hemodialysis therapy , which may affect the quality of life .
we evaluated the prevalence of various dermatological manifestations in patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center .
2. materials and methods patients undergoing regular hemodialysis at least twice a week for a minimum of three months were evaluated .
patients were excluded if they were undergoing hemodialysis less than twice a week or on hemodialysis secondary to esrd following graft dysfunction .
all patients underwent clinical examination , and relevant investigations were recorded .
dermatological evaluation and confirmation of the presenting lesions were done by qualified dermatologist .
microscopic evaluation for fungal infections and histopathologic evaluation for kyrle disease was performed .
3. statistical analysis all the data was entered in microsoft excel spread sheet .
statistical analysis was done by using graphpad prism , version 4 , usa .
continuous data was described as arithmetic mean and standard deviation and categorical data as actual numbers and percentages .
4. results one hundred and forty - three patients undergoing regular hemodialysis twice a week were evaluated .
among them , there were 113 male and 30 females ( 3.67 : 1 ) .
the mean age of these patients was 43.8 +/ - 13.0 yrs ( 14 - 70 ) .
the mean values of serum creatinine , blood urea , hemoglobin , uric acid , and kt / v of these patients were 9.4 +/ - 6.3 mg / dl , 133.5 +/ - 46.9 mg / dl , 7.17 +/ - 1.7 gm , 7.0 +/ - 1.8 mg / dl , and 1.2 +/ - 0.1 , respectively .
the mean duration of dialysis was 23.0 +/ - 14.1 months .
the causes of esrd and cutaneous manifestations were described in table 1 .
among the skin changes , pruritus accounted for 56 % of the total study population .
it manifested even before hemodialysis in 28 patients , and only 4 patients out of 81 showed significant improvement after hemodialysis .
pruritus was found to be severe in diabetic patients ( 21 / 37 ) .
xerosis was observed in 52 % of the study population .
diffuse blackish hyperpigmentation was seen in 40 % and was predominant in sun - exposed areas .
53 % of patients had skin infections , of these fungal , bacterial and viral infections were 27.2 % , 14.6 % , and 11.2 % , respectively .
among the fungal infections onychomycosis , tinea versicolor and tinea cruris ( figure 1 ) were the most common , and among the viral infection herpes labialis and herpes zoster were common .
kyrle 's disease ( figure 2 ) was observed only in 6.9 % in our patients .
other skin manifestations include eczema 4.8 % , psoriasis 2.7 % , and drug rash 2.1 % .
nail changes were observed in 46 patients of whom 27 patients had onychomycosis ( figure 3 ) .
other changes include discoloration , onycholysis , and splinter hemorrhages .
hair changes were observed in 21.7 % .
mucosal changes were seen in 27.3 % .
5. discussion pruritus was the most common skin manifestation observed in our patients as compared to other studies [ 5 ] .
pruritus was found to be severe in diabetics .
dry luster less skin could have contributed for such a high percentage in our study group .
xerosis was found to be the second most common manifestation which predominantly affected extensor surfaces of forearms , legs , and thighs and was severe in diabetics [ 6 ] .
similar observation was noticed in previous studies with a prevalence of 45 - 90 % [ 7 ] .
high dosage of diuretics , reduction in size of sweat glands , and excessive ultrafiltration might be responsible for the above manifestation .
emollients were prescribed to these patients and found to be effective .
diffuse blackish hyperpigmentation was seen in 40 % , which was relatively high when compared to 20 - 22 % in other studies [ 8 ] .
this might be probably due to the failure of kidneys to excrete beta - melanocyte stimulating hormone and resultant melanin being deposited in basal layer as well as superficial dermis .
skin infections were comparatively lesser in proportion when compared to udayakumar et al .
[ 5 ] and bencini et al .
[ 9 ] observations .
the high incidence of infections might be due to diabetes , low albumin , elevated intracellular calcium , acidosis , or repetitive vascular procedures .
among the acquired perforating disorders , only kyrle 's disease was noticed , and others like perforating folliculitis , and perforating collagenosis were not found in our study .
nail changes observed in our study were onychomycosis , discolouration , onycholysis , and splinter hemorrhages .
hair changes were observed with a sparse distribution over body which included dryness and hair discoloration .
dryness was possibly due to decreased sebum secretion .
this was high compared to 10 - 30 % in other studies [ 10 , 11 ] .
the reported incidence of oral mucosal changes in hemodialysis patients was 27.3 % compared to 90 % in previous studies [ 12 ] .
changes observed in our study were xerostomia , angular cheilitis , gingivitis , and uremic breath .
possible causes include dehydration , mouth breathing , and high concentration of urea , and failure to breakdown into ammonia .
6. conclusions in our study , pruritus , xerosis , and pigmentation were higher among skin changes .
recognition and management of some of these dermatological manifestations vastly reduce the morbidity and improve the quality of life .

hydrogeochemical investigations had been carried out at the amol - babol plain in the north of iran .
geochemical processes and factors controlling the groundwater chemistry are identified based on the combination of classic geochemical methods with geographic information system ( gis ) and geostatistical techniques .
the results of the ionic ratios and gibbs plots show that water rock interaction mechanisms , followed by cation exchange , and dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals have influenced the groundwater chemistry in the study area .
the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater show a shift from low mineralized ca - hco3 , ca - na - hco3 , and ca - cl water types to high mineralized na - cl water type .
three classes , namely , c1 , c2 , and c3 , have been classified using cluster analysis .
the spatial distribution maps of na +/ cl - , mg2 +/ ca2 + , and cl - / hco3 - ratios and electrical conductivity values indicate that the carbonate and weathering of silicate minerals played a significant role in the groundwater chemistry on the southern and western sides of the plain .
however , salinization process had increased due to the influence of the evaporation - precipitation process towards the north - eastern side of the study area .
1. introduction groundwater plays a major role in the water supply and ecology of arid and semiarid regions .
the quality of groundwater is important in order to support life [ 1 ] .
groundwater is controlled by natural and anthropogenic factors , such as geological structure , composition of precipitation [ 2 ] , geochemical process , the interaction between the groundwater and aquifer minerals [ 3 ] , and human activities .
the interaction of these factors result in various water types [ 4 ] .
the groundwater chemistry depends on different hydrogeochemical processes that the groundwater undergoes over space and time .
in arid and semiarid areas , such as the amol - babol plain in the north of iran and to the south of the caspian sea , several processes evaporation , transpiration , seawater intrusion , cation exchange , dissociation and precipitation minerals , oxidation reduction , and biological processes could be involved in the groundwater chemical composition at the same time .
salinization is one of the principal water problem concerns that have become a major threat to the quality of the freshwater being suitable for human consumption .
land use activities , climate conditions , and the geological setting have a significant influence on the groundwater salinity [ 5 ] .
improper irrigation and drainage technique in arid and semiarid areas could also increase the risk of the progressive salinization of soil , because of the solute accumulation in irrigation water [ 2 , 6 ] .
several studies have indicated the role of other processes such as high evaporation rate and limited discharge [ 7 ] , excessive pumping of groundwater [ 8 ] , fossil seawater [ 9 ] , and seawater - freshwater mixing [ 10 ] which increases the salt concentration in the groundwater .
the coastal area on the north side of the amol - babol plain is under increasing human pressure from population growth and the increase in the development of agricultural activities .
groundwater resources along the shoreline could be threatened by the mixing mechanism of seawater intrusion into the freshwater , due to the over abstraction of groundwater [ 11 , 12 ] .
in as much as salinization on the amol - babol plain may be caused by a combination of different processes ; this research was undertaken to identify the source of salinity of groundwater and determine the hydrogeochemical process involved in the salinization of groundwater in the study area .
the weathering conditions , altitude , and geological structure are different in the southern part of the study area , where the plain is restricted by the alborz highlands .
the hydrochemistry of the groundwater near the highlands might be influenced through the dissolution of carbonate rocks , cation exchange , and the adsorption of dissolved ions as the dominant processes [ 1 ] .
hanshaw and back [ 13 ] noted that carbonate aquifers constitute a dynamic geochemical system with the water - rock interaction due to the fast dissolution / precipitation kinetics of carbonate minerals .
studies of the major ions have been used to identify the hydrochemical facies of the water .
several researchers have evaluated the groundwater chemistry and consider hydrogeochemical processes by developing geochemical modelling and adopting graphical methods for the interpretation of water quality indices [ 2 , 14 - 16 ] .
in recent years , multivariate statistical techniques coupled with phreeqc software [ 17 ] and geographical information systems ( gis ) [ 18 ] have been applied to detect important information from the hydrogeochemical data in complex systems [ 4 , 19 - 21 ] .
this multidisciplinary approach will be useful to identify and locate different physiochemical processes in the groundwater in complex aquifers .
the combination of hydrogeochemical tools and statistical analysis is applied to investigate the properties of groundwater among the sampling sites .
the application of gis provides a unified way to represent the physiochemical characteristic in a specific area , as well as the presentation of spatial distribution of groundwater hydrochemistry parameters in the thematic maps [ 22 ] .
the gis method based on na +/ cl - , mg2 +/ ca2 + , and cl - / hco3 - ionic ratio , and electrical conductivity ( ec ) is an attempt to understand the groundwater quality variations by the distribution maps [ 20 ] .
although gis is an appropriate tool to map , query , and analyse the data [ 22 ] , which could be effective for the authorities to manage the natural resource in a given certain area [ 23 ] , not many studied have been conducted with this method in hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater .
the sustainable development of water resources in the arid and semiarid areas highly depends on the investigation of the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater .
nevertheless , limited research is available regarding the hydrochemical characteristics of the amol - babol plain .
this study focuses on investigating the major hydrogeochemical aspects of groundwater chemistry on the amol - babol plain as well as providing an overview of the spatial distribution of the groundwater ionic ratios by using gis and interpolation techniques .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study area the study area is in the amol - babol plain , which is located between longitudes 51degrees26 ' and 52degrees55'e and latitudes 35degrees46 ' and 36degrees43'n ( figure 1 ) .
it consists of a broad plain on the northern side of the mazandaran province which is bounded to the south by the alborz highlands and to the north by the caspian sea .
the plain covers an area of 1822 km2 .
topographically , the study area starts from the hillside of the alborz highland ( above 970 m ) , which is covered by forest and irrigated lands in the valley .
the plain has been formed by river deposits that developed alluvial fans , a flood plain , and marine deposits .
the lowest elevation of about - 25 m is observed in the coastal regions near the caspian sea .
the main annual temperature is about 17.9degreesc .
the temperature decreases from the north of the area , which is close to the caspian sea to the south around the alborz highlands [ 24 ] .
the annual precipitation is about 880 mm. precipitation varies from 350 mm in the rainy season to 147 mm in dry season .
the annual evaporation is about 750 mm in the middle of plain where the evaporation increases in proportion to the distance from the caspian sea [ 24 ] .
haraz , babol , and talar are the three largest rivers in the study area .
the rivers begin from the alborz highlands and flow northward to the caspian sea .
the haraz river flows on the western side of the amol - babol plain and passes through the city of amol .
the river is a major source of agricultural activity in the region .
the haraz river has a length of 185 km with an annual discharge of 940 mcm [ 24 ] .
the babol river passes through babol city .
the annual flow is 493 mcm .
the talar river on the eastern side of the study area flows to about 58 km from shirgah to the caspian sea .
the annual discharge rate is 311 mcm at kiakola station .
around 63 % of the total water consumed is provided from the groundwater resources in the amol - babol plain .
more than 80 % of the water resources for agricultural activities are supplied by the groundwater .
moreover , the groundwater is the main source for drinking in the study area .
2.2 .
geology the amol - babol plain is part of the geological unit of the georgian - rasht zone situated in the north of the alborz great fault , which extends from georgian to lahijan [ 25 ] .
the oldest geological formation of the study area dates back to the permian age and includes dorud , ruteh , and nessan formations , which mostly consist of a limestone layer and also thin layers of shale and marl [ 25 ] .
these formations mostly outcrop in the southern parts of the study area near the haraz road .
when global de glaciation started in the triassic age , sedimentation stopped in the alborz area [ 25 ] , and the sea level started to rise with the commencement of sedimentation during the jurassic period .
the bedrock of the area mostly belongs to the lower to middle jurassic formation .
the lithology of the study area consists of conglomerates , sandstone , siltstone , shale , and coal seams .
the late jurassic is represented by the presence of limestone in the sediment layers .
cretaceous marl and clay cover top of the jurassic limestone in the south and south - eastern side of the study area .
during the quaternary period , the process of deposition developed unconsolidated clay and sandy sediments with freshwater over an extensive part of the plain [ 25 ] .
alluvial fans have been formed by the weathering of rocks , transport and deposition of sediments by the rivers .
during this process , haraz homogenous and talar heterogeneous alluvial fans had been extended to the western and eastern side of the amol - babol plain [ 26 ] .
the caspian sea is a remnant of the paratethys sea , which became an enclosed water body around 5.5 million years ago , because of tectonic uplift , a decrease in sea level and climate change [ 25 ] .
then within the last one million years , old sea water , which was trapped between the layers of sediment layers , was washed and discharged to the sea by the river and groundwater flows [ 25 ] .
however , fossil saline water still remains in limited areas on the north eastern side of the plain , due to the weak discharge rate of the talar river and the heterogeneous sediment layers of clay and sand in the study area [ 26 ] .
2.3 .
hydrogeology groundwater in the study area is represented by an unconfined aquifer and a confined aquifer .
the unconfined aquifer extends to around 94 % of the plain , except for a limited area on the north - eastern side .
the thickness of alluvial deposits changes from less than 10 m for the coastal land to around 200 m for the haraz alluvial fan in the west and south - western part of the plain .
the groundwater tables decrease from the highlands on the southern side to the coastal area ( figure 1 ) .
the main direction of the groundwater flow is from the recharge zone ( alborz mountain ) in the south to the discharge area ( caspian sea ) in the north part of the plain ( figure 2 ) .
the hydraulic gradient varies from 10 per thousand in the southern area to 0.5 per thousand in the coastal plain of the caspian sea [ 26 ] .
there are around 61,496 shallow and 6,634 deep wells on the amol - babol plain .
the water abstraction from the plain aquifer was about 390 million m3 for agricultural activities and around 44 million m3 for drinking purposes , during the 2008 to 2009 period [ 26 ] .
the total abstraction of groundwater was 507 million m3 through the wells , springs , and quants , of which 342 million m3 ( around 94 %) was discharged from wells [ 26 ] .
2.4 .
groundwater sampling and analysis a total of 306 groundwater samples were collected from 153 wells during the dry and wet seasons in 2009 .
after pumping out for 10 - 15 minutes to prevent nonrepresentative samples of stagnant or polluted water [ 27 ] , the analyses were undertaken within 24 hours of the sampling exercise .
the parameters , such as temperature , electrical conductivity ( ec ) , ph , total dissolved solid ( tds ) , and dissolved oxygen ( do ) were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multiparameter wp600 series meter .
the bottles were rinsed using the groundwater to be sampled .
the samples were taken and stored in the acid - washed polyethylene bottles [ 28 ] .
the bottles were rinsed using the groundwater to be sampled .
also , the samples were filtered using a 0.45 mum , acetate cellulose filter on site [ 28 , 29 ] .
the collected samples were kept at 4degreesc and transported to the laboratory .
the samples were analysed for sodium , potassium , calcium , magnesium , chloride , sulfate , bicarbonate , and carbonate based on the apha [ 28 ] procedures in the laboratory .
the ca2 + and mg2 + were determined titrimetrically using the standard edta method , and sodium and potassium by flame photometry .
the anions and bicarbonate were determined by acid titration , while the chloride concentration was determined by agno3 titration and the sulfate and phosphate values by spectrophotometer .
the quality of the analyses of the parameters to obtain a reliable dataset was controlled by sending the blank samples to the laboratory .
the accuracy of the results was checked by calculating the ion balance errors , which was generally within +/ - 5 .
2.5 .
statistical analysis multivariate statistical analyses were applied to obtain significant information from hydro - chemical data sets in complex systems .
chemical variables were graphically interpreted using piper , schoeller , and gibbs diagrams to show the groundwater facies for the amol - babol plain .
multivariate statistical methods of descriptive statistics , pearson correlation analysis , discriminant analysis ( da ) , and cluster analysis ( ca ) were performed as quantitative and independent methods for classification of groundwater samples and to correlate between the chemical parameters and groundwater samples .
multivariate statistical analysis utilizes normally distributed data [ 30 ] .
the data for most chemical parameters are positively skewed .
the data varied between 0 and + 2 .
only values within the range of - 2 to + 2 showed a normal distribution [ 31 ] , f - , na + , k + , no3 - , co3 2 - , and ph were not found to be normally distributed ( table 2 ) .
the data were then log - transformed so that it will be normally distributed prior to the multivariate analyses , all the parameters were standardized by subtracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation of parameters [ 16 ] .
discriminant analysis was applied to characterize and categorize the water quality into exclusive and exhaustive groups based on the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables [ 32 ] .
linear combinations of independent variables will discriminate the groups to minimize the misclassification error [ 33 ] .
da was applied on the raw data using forward stepwise methods to determine the most significant variables that highly influenced groundwater quality [ 34 ] .
for the classification of variables based on the similarities within a class and heterogeneity between the classes cluster analysis was applied on the normalized dataset by means of the ward method [ 35 ] .
hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis ( haca ) was mostly used where clusters were formed sequentially , by starting from the most similar pair of objects and forming higher clusters [ 36 ] .
the dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering process , presenting a picture of classes and their proximity .
in this study , the degree of association of relationship between two variables was summarized using pearson 's correlation analysis [ 30 ] .
the values of correlation varied from + 1 to - 1 .
where + 1 indicates strongly positive correlation , - 1 represents strongly negative correlation , and 0 means no linear correlation .
2.6 .
identification of salinization zones geographical information system ( gis ) and geostatistical techniques provide an integrated tool to investigate the spatial distribution of ec , na +/ cl - , mg2 +/ ca2 + , and cl - / hco3 - ionic ratios .
the spatial distribution maps of each ratio , ec , and sar were generated using the ordinary kriging method , which is one of the best interpolation methods in arcgis geostatistical extension [ 22 ] .
ordinary kriging is a method for linear optimum appropriate interpolation with a minimum square error of the un sampled location , based on the following [ 37 ] : ( 1 ) z *( x0 )= sumi = 1nnlambdaiz ( xi ) , where z *( x 0 ) is the estimated value at location x 0 , n is the number of the points , z ( x i ) is the known value at location x i , and lambda i is the kriging weight .
the basic geostatistical tool for modelling the spatial autocorrelation of a regionalized variable is the semivariogram , which measures the average degree of dissimilarity between the unsampled values and the nearest data values [ 38 ] .
the experimental variogram 's value for a separation distance of h is half the average squared difference between the value at z ( x i ) and the value at z ( x i + h ) [ 39 ] : ( 2 ) gamma ( h )= 12n ( h ) sumi = 1n ( h )[ z ( xi ) - z ( xi + h )] 2 , where n ( h ) is the number of data pairs within a given class of distance and direction .
the best fitting variogram model has been chosen by calculating the experimental semivariogram and fitting alternative semivariogram , using cross validation .
the nugget / sill ratio and the root - mean square error ( rmss ) were applied to provide accurate prediction in semivariograms .
based on table 1 , the exponential model was chosen as the fitted model for ca / mg , na / cl , cl / hco3 , and ec. the nugget / sill ratio varied between 30 and 60 % and the rmss values ranged around one , implying that there is a relatively insignificant bias and a good estimation of prediction variability .
3. results and discussion the cluster analysis classified the groundwater samples into three general classes , namely , c1 , c2 , and c3 , using cluster analysis based on the similarities among the chemical parameters involved in the groundwater quality on the plain ( figure 3 ( a )) .
the level of significance of the chemical parameters of sodium , magnesium , calcium , chloride , and electrical conductivity was determined by discriminant analysis according to spatial variation of the sampling wells in the study area .
the samples in classes c1 and c3 had a similar anionic composition that was dominated by hco3 - with abundance orders of hco3 - > cl - > so4 2 - ( meq / l ) ( figure 3 ( b )) .
the samples in clusters c1 and c3 had a cationic composition that was dominated by ca2 + and mg2 + , respectively , with abundance orders of ca2 +=~ mg2 + > na + ( meq / l ) .
therefore , the chemical compositions of these classes were characterized by the ca - mg - hco3 water type .
the samples in cluster one represented the freshwater type due to the mean concentrations of tds of around 686 mg / l and ec about 939 mus / cm , whilst the c3 water samples tended to brackish be water ( average tds = 1004 mg / l and average ec = 1372 mus / cm ) .
the samples in the second cluster showed a different ionic composition that was dominated by na + , with abundance orders na + > ca2 +=~ mg2 + ( meq / l ) ( figure 3 ( b )) and the anionic composition was dominated by cl - > hco3 - > so4 2 - ( meq / l ) .
thus , their chemical composition was characterized by the na - cl type , which could be supported by the mean tds values being greater than 1549 mg / l and an average ec of around 2058 mus / cm , which represents the brackish to saline water type .
3.1 .
hydrogeochemical facies the schoeller diagram showed that ca2 + and hco3 - are the dominant ions in most parts of the study area ( figure 3 ( b )) .
the majority of groundwater samples showed ca - mg - hco3 , mixed ca - cl and ca - na - hco3 , and nacl types .
about , 71 % of the groundwater samples were characterized as ca - hco3 type , due to the carbonate dissolution process and wide contact with limestone .
the groundwater type changed to ca - cl , ca - na - hco3 , and na - cl as it moved from the west and south side towards the eastern and north - eastern sides of the plain ( figure 4 ( b )) .
the ca - hco3 water , which extended in the haraz alluvial fan and the southern side of the alborz highlands , represented permanent hardness of the groundwater .
towards the center of the plain , the groundwater type changed to ca - cl and ca - na - hco3 , which indicated the slightly saline water .
to the east and north - eastern sides of the plain na + was the dominant cation , while cl - was the dominant anion .
the groundwater samples were classified as na - cl type , which represented the saline water type .
the spatial distribution map showed that the groundwater type gradually changed from freshwater on the south and western sides to saline water on the north - eastern side of the plain ( figure 4 ( b )) .
3.2 .
correlation of major ions in general , the groundwater was found to be slightly acidic with ph values varying from minimum 6.41 to a maximum of 7.67 especially on the southern side ( class 1 ) where it was covered by carbonate rock formations .
naturally , rainwater is slightly acidic [ 40 ] , due to the reaction with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , thereby making the rainwater slightly acidic , according to ( 1 ) ( table 1 ) : ( 3 ) h2o + co2 - - - > h2co3 ( carbonate acid ) the carbonate acid in the water could be breaks down based on ( 4 ) , producing ( hco3 ) and h + : ( 4 ) h2co3 < - - - > hco3 - + h + hco3 < - - - > h ++ co32 - the alkalinity of water is the measure of its capacity for neutralization [ 41 ] , which is represented by the bicarbonate ( hco3 - ) .
hco3 - was the dominant anion , which varied from a minimum of 182.5 mg / l to a maximum of 1065 mg / l in the study area .
the concentration of hco3 - showed spatial variation , due to the existence of carbonate rock in the recharge area .
significant differences were observed in the total dissolved solids , where the tds values vary from a minimum of 414 mg / l ( from class 1 ) to a maximum of 2441 mg / l ( from class 2 ) .
the large variations of the ec and tds in the groundwater were dependent on the geochemical processes and the anthropogenic activities , such as the application of fertilizers and seawater intrusion in the study area .
the high values of tds concentration represented a high concentration of dissolved ions in the groundwater samples , which strongly correlated with the ec values ( r = 0.985 ; p < 0.05 ) , cl - concentration ( r = 0.719 ; p < 0.05 ) , and na values ( r = 0.853 ; p < 0.05 ) ( table 3 ) .
the strong correlation between tds , ec , na , and cl - showed that these ions could be derived from the same source .
moreover , there was a significant correlation ( r = 0.737 ; p < 0.05 ) between na and cl , which indicated that groundwater salinity in the plain may have originated from three sources seawater intrusion , evaporated deposits , and fossil saline water entrapped in the sediments. from the analysis of the major ions , it was observed that ca2 + and mg2 + were the dominant cations , with the exception of samples belonging to class two , which were characterized by a high concentration of na + and k + .
the calcium concentration was as high as 175 mg / l and as low as 20 mg / l. high calcium concentration might have originated from calcite and dolomite weathering or silicate rock dissolution .
ca2 + and mg2 + constitute the possible sources of hardness , which were common in the limestone areas .
the groundwater hardness showed a strong correlation with ca2 + ( r = 0.746 ) and mg2 + ( r = 0.775 ) , which reflected that they originated from the same sources .
the concentration of potassium in the groundwater samples varied from 0.58 to 82.9 mg / l on the plain .
although , high potassium concentrations have been derived from anthropogenic sources , such as potash feldspar in the agricultural lands , which were mostly observed in the central part of the plain , the weak correlations between k + and other major ions suggested that potassium mostly originated from k - feldspar or k - bearing minerals ( table 3 ) [ 2 ] .
3.3 .
ionic ratio calcium and magnesium were the dominant cations and bicarbonate was the dominant anion in wide areas of the western , eastern , and central sides of the plain .
the abundance of ca2 + and mg2 + in the groundwater could be related to the presence of carbonate rock in the basin , while weathering of carbonate and silicates may contribute ca2 + and mg2 + in the groundwater .
the dissolution of calcite and dolomite can be shown by the groundwater 's ca2 +/ mg2 + molar ratio .
a ca2 +/ mg2 + molar ratio that is equal to one indicates dissolution of dolomite rocks [ 42 ] , while a greater ratio may represent a more dominant calcite contribution from the rocks .
a ca2 +/ mg2 + ratio , greater than 2 , may represent the dissolution of silicate minerals into the groundwater [ 43 ] .
whilst 59 % of the groundwater samples had a ca2 +/ mg2 + ratio between 1 and 2 , which indicated that the dissolution of calcite 38 % of the samples had a higher ratio than 2 , which showed the effect of silicate minerals that contribute calcium and magnesium to the groundwater [ 42 ] .
only a few samples ( around 2.6 %) were indicative of the dissolution of dolomite with ca2 +/ mg2 + ratio < 1 ( figure 5 ( a )) .
the spatial pattern in the ratio of calcium and magnesium showed the variation from the south to the central and eastern parts of the plain ( figure 6 ( a )) .
the ratio was the highest towards the alborz highlands on the southern side , due to the increase in calcium concentration through the weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks in the recharge area .
the ratio decreased with the distance from the weathering zones towards the discharge area in the caspian sea ( figure 6 ( a )) .
the dissolution of carbonate minerals could be represented in the following reactions (( 5 ) to ( 8 )) in natural systems [ 44 ] : ( 5 ) caco3 ( calcite )+ h2co3 - - - > ca2 ++ 2hco3 - ( 6 ) camg ( co3 ) 2 ( dolomite )+ h2co3 - - - > ca2 ++ mg2 ++ 4hco3 - ( 7 ) caco3 + h2so4 - - - > ca2 ++ so4 - + h2co3 ( 8 ) camg ( co3 ) 2 + 2h2so4 - - - > ca2 ++ mg2 ++ 2so4 - + 2h2co3 dissolution is a simple and common weathering reaction in carbonate rocks [ 45 ] .
it is specified by the 1 : 2 ratio of ca2 +/ hco3 - , and 1 : 1 equivalent ratio of ca2 + + mg2 +/ hco3 - , in the groundwater .
the mean value of ca2 +/ hco3 - ratio was 0.79 , which was near the 1 : 2 ratios and represented the significance influence of dissolution in the carbonate rocks .
the ca2 + + mg2 +/ hco3 - mean ratio in the groundwater was 1.38 that is also near to 1 : 1 equivalence ratio , representing that around 61 % of the bicarbonate is related to calcium and magnesium .
the lower value of ca2 + + mg2 +/ hco3 - was observed in about 5 % of the samples that indicative of other sources of hco3 such as silicate weathering in the study area .
around 34 % of samples showed the higher ratio of ca2 + + mg2 + to hco3 that represents that the excess of ca2 + and mg2 + has been balanced by cl - and so4 2 - . the plot of ca2 + + mg2 + versus hco3 - + so4 2 - will be near to 1 : 1 line if ca2 + , mg2 + , so4 2 - , and hco3 - are derived from the dissolution of calcite , dolomite , and gypsum .
if ion exchange is the dominant process , the data points tend to shift to the right due to excess of so4 2 - + hco3 - . the ion exchange reaction may be explained as follows : ( 9 ) 12ca - clay2 + na + - - - > 12ca2 ++ na - clay if the points were above the median line , a reverse ion exchange was the active reaction for the excess of ca2 + + mg2 + over so4 2 - + hco3 - , which could be represented by the following reaction : ( 10 ) na - clay + 12ca2 + - - - > na ++ 12ca - clay2 the average ratio of ca2 + + mg2 +/ hco3 - + so4 2 - was 1.09 .
based on the plot , the majority ( 73.6 %) of samples were scattered close to the 1 : 1 line , indicating that an excess of ca2 + and mg2 + in the groundwater may be due to the dissolution of calcite , dolomite , and gypsum .
moreover , around 14.7 % of the samples fall above the median line , indicating that reverse ion exchange tended to be the dominant reaction over ion exchange , which was responsible for the higher hco3 - and so4 2 - concentration in the groundwater ( figure 5 ( b )) .
the plot of ca2 + + mg2 + versus cl - and na +/ cl - versus cl - clearly indicated that the salinity increased with a decrease in na +/ cl - and an increase in ca2 + + mg2 + , which may be due to reverse ion exchange in the clay / weathered layer ( figures 5 ( c ) and 5 ( d )) .
the aquifer matrix may adsorb dissolved sodium in exchange for bound ca2 + and mg2 + .
na + was a dominant cation and cl - was a dominant anion on the east and north eastern side of the plain , which were mostly classified as the second cluster group .
the high concentration of sodium and chloride in the groundwater could be related to the weathering of silicate rocks , the evapotranspiration process and / or seawater intrusion .
the cl - / hco3 - ratio may show the influence of salinization due to the seawater mixing to the groundwater .
the ratio of cl - / hco3 - versus cl ranged from 0.02 to 3.09 and showed a strong positive linear relation to the cl - concentration ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 5 ( e )) .
about 80.7 % of groundwater samples showed cl - / hco3 - ratios lower than 0.5 , which means the groundwater was unaffected or freshwater .
the remaining samples fell between the ratios of 0.5 - 6.6 cl / hco3 , which showed that the water was slightly or moderately affected by salinization .
the spatial distribution map of cl - / hco3 - ratio indicated that the unaffected water mostly covered the south and western side of the plain .
however , salinization influenced the groundwater towards the east and north - eastern side of the study area , which was suspected to be affected by fossil saline water ( figure 6 ( b )) .
the relationship between na + - cl - has been used to identify the process that controls the salinity and saline intrusion in arid and semiarid areas [ 2 , 46 ] .
the origin of sodium concentration can be from different processes in the groundwater .
the average molar ratio of na +/ cl - was 1.70 in the study area , which indicated higher na + values than the cl - ( figure 5 ( f )) .
the majority of the samples showed a na +/ cl - ratio equal to or greater than 1 that may represents sodium , which had been released from the silicate weathering process .
silicate weathering is the reaction of the feldspar minerals with the carbonate acid in the water , which is specified by bicarbonate as a dominant anion in the groundwater [ 47 ] , similar to the amol - babol plain ( figure 3 ( b )) .
halite is a dominant source of na + and cl - in the groundwater ; the molar ratio varies spatially as a result of the cation exchange [ 48 ] .
the availability of free halite for dissolution in the soil zone may increase in the arid and semiarid regions with low annual precipitation of less than < 600 mm [ 49 ] .
the ratio of na +/ cl - being equal to one indicated that halite dissolution could be responsible for the sodium concentration in the water samples .
based on the spatial distribution map of the na +/ cl - ratio , the majority of the study area was covered with a ratio greater than 1.5 , which indicated the role of silicate weathering as the source of sodium in the study area ( figure 6 ( c )) .
limited zones on the eastern side near the babol and ghaemshahr city represent a ratio near to one .
groundwater salinity may also relate to the formation of salt layers by leaching from the soil surface during evaporation in a semiarid climate .
in the plot of na +/ cl - versus ec , the na +/ cl - showed a decreasing trend with increasing ec along with a higher a na +/ cl - ratio in class 1 , which indicated that the na + originated from the silicate weathering process ( figure 5 ( d )) .
moreover , most of the samples belonging to classes 2 and 3 were plotted parallel to the electrical conductivity axis ( figure 5 ( d )) thereby indicating the role of evaporation and evapotranspiration to increase sodium concentration .
the electrical conductivity increased gradually from the west and the south to the north - eastern side of the plain ( figure 6 ( d )) .
the suspected area for the evaporation process , which was mostly covered with classes 2 and 3 , showed the greater values of electrical conductivity .
the silicate weathering process was found on the south and western side of the plain , which were monitored by the sampling well from class 1 ( figure 6 ( d )) .
3.4 .
gibbs plot several factors control groundwater chemistry , which can be related to the physical situation of the aquifer , bedrock mineralogy and weather condition .
gibbs ( 1970 ) suggested tds versus na +/ na + + ca2 + for cations and tds versus cl - /( cl - + hco3 - ) for anions to illustrate the natural mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry , including the rainfall dominance , rock weathering dominance , and evaporation and participation dominance .
based on the gibbs diagram , the entire samples plotted fell into group one and 60 % of the samples of group three may have been influenced by rock weathering reaction ( figure 7 ) .
the chemistry of all the samples belonging to class two and around 30 % of samples from class three were controlled by the evaporation - precipitation dominance field ( figure 7 ) .
it seems that the ion chemistry of fresh groundwater ( class 1 and most of class 3 ) generally related to carbonate and silicate weathering process on the south and west side of the study area .
however , evaporation was the secondary factor that mostly control the groundwater chemistry in the north - eastern part where the class 2 sampling wells were situated .
3.5 .
saturation index the interaction between the groundwater and rocks controls the geochemistry of the groundwater .
the mineral equilibrium calculation can predict the thermodynamic control on the composition of the groundwater that has equilibrated with various minerals [ 50 ] .
the saturation index was applied to predict the reactive mineralogy of the subsurface from the groundwater sample data without collecting the samples of the solid phase and analysing the mineralogy [ 50 ] .
the saturation index ( si ) was calculated using the computer geochemical program phreeqc for groundwater samples [ 51 ] , which can be defined as ( 11 ) si = log ( iapk ) , where iap is the ion activity product and k is the equilibrium constant .
equilibrium is indicated when si = 0 ; the groundwater is supersaturated when si > 0 , which shows that precipitation is needed to achieve equilibrium .
if si < 0 , the groundwater is under saturated ; this indicates that dissolution is required to reach equilibrium .
the first and third groups showed slightly different behaviour from class 2 with respect to their carbonate minerals ( table 4 ) .
in classes 1 and 3 , groundwater was supersaturated compared to the calcite and less saturated when compared to the dolomite and aragonite .
in class 2 , groundwater was supersaturated with calcite , dolomite , and aragonite .
the super saturation of groundwater with these carbonate minerals suggested that these carbonate minerals were the main components in the host rock .
however , the lower saturation of these minerals has influenced the chemical composition of the groundwater .
the evaporated minerals including , halite , gypsum , and anhydrite were under saturated in all groups , indicating that the soluble component na + , cl - , ca2 + , and so4 2 - concentration was not limited by mineral equilibrium [ 4 ] .
4. conclusions the integration of statistical approaches and geochemical methods were applied to investigate the regional factors and processes governing the chemical composition of groundwater on the amol - babol plain .
in general , the dominant hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater were the ca - hco3 type , which covers large parts of the western , southern , and central sides of the plain , and changes to the ca - cl and ca - na - hco3 types on the centre and the east side and na - cl type on the north - eastern side of the study area .
the groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by the weathering of minerals .
water rock interaction , including dissolution of carbonate mineral and silicate weathering , was the major hydrogeochemical processes that affect the groundwater hardness on the amol - babol plain .
the excessive sodium concentration could be due to the weathering of silicate rocks on the south and western sides of the plain , whereas evaporation was the dominant process in addition to the chloride on the east and north - eastern sides of the study area .
based on the hierarchical cluster analysis of sampling wells , samples of the first and third classes , which were distributed on the west , south , and central sides , represent the fresh - water type .
the gibbs plot indicated that the hydrochemistry of these groups were mainly influenced by the rock dominance , including carbonate and silicate rocks weathering .
the groundwater type of second class gradually changed to saline water towards the north - eastern side of the plain .
the gibbs diagram clearly displayed the role of the evaporation process in the groundwater chemistry of the second group .
the groundwater samples were saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite in all three groups , and were under saturated with respect to halite and gypsum minerals .
special management could be suggested for the salinity control in the areas with saline water , which were specified by spatial distribution maps in the arcgis environment .

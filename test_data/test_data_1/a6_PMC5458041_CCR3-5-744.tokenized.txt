key clinical message adenosine is increasingly used to assess for dormant conduction following pulmonary vein isolation during atrial fibrillation ablation .
while the half - life of adenosine is typically short and side effects transient , operators should be aware of more serious , lasting adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm .

acute effects of adenosine include hypotension and bronchospasm , both of which typically resolve within seconds due to adenosine 's short half - life .
we describe one case of prolonged hypotension due to anaphylaxis and another of prolonged bronchospasm - induced hypoxia. with increasing use of adenosine during catheter ablations , operators should be aware of these uncommon but important adverse reactions .
case 1 a 57 - year - old man with hypertension , treated with lisinopril and metoprolol succinate , and symptomatic , paroxysmal af underwent catheter ablation .
a radial arterial line was inserted for hemodynamic monitoring .
general anesthesia was induced with 50 mug fentanyl , 100 mg succinylcholine , and 200 mg propofol prior to intubation , then maintained with propofol 75 mug / kg / min and remifentanil 0.15 mug / kg / min .
blood pressure was supported with phenylephrine 75 mug / min .
high - frequency , low volume ( jet ) ventilation was utilized to enhance catheter stability .
the pulmonary veins were isolated uneventfully .
following pvi , the patient 's blood pressure was 135 / 85 mmhg .
adenosine 12 mg was administered as a rapid bolus via a central venous line with no prolongation of the pr interval .
repeat blood pressure after 2 min was 110 / 60 mmhg .
adenosine 18 mg was administered next , prolonging the pr interval from 155 to 230 msec , following which the blood pressure precipitously decreased to 55 / 30 mmhg ( fig. 1 ) and facial flushing developed .
remifentanil was discontinued , yet he remained profoundly hypotensive requiring epinephrine ( 40 mug via 4 boluses , followed by infusion at 10 mug / min ) , phenylephrine ( 600 mug via 3 boluses , followed by infusion at 200 mug / min ) , and multiple boluses of normal saline to maintain a mean arterial pressure > 50 mmhg .
there was no pericardial effusion by intracardiac echocardiogram ( ice ) , and point - of - care hemoglobin was unchanged .
due to concern for anaphylactic reaction , intravenous methylprednisolone ( 1 g ) , diphenhydramine ( 50 mg ) , and ranitidine ( 50 mg ) were administered , in addition to the epinephrine .
after 45 min of hypotension , the flushing resolved and his blood pressure recovered to his previous requirement of phenylephrine 75 mug / min .
he was awakened from general anesthesia with a normal neurological examination .
abdominal ct scan demonstrated no retroperitoneal bleed .
the patient was monitored overnight and discharged the following day with his usual blood pressure .
figure 1 invasive arterial blood pressure trend following administration of adenosine .
blood pressure trend demonstrating acute onset of sustained hypotension immediately following administration of intravenous adenosine ( 12 mg then 18 mg ) .
blood pressure recovered after 45 min of fluid resuscitation , as well as administration of epinephrine , phenylephrine , methylprednisolone , diphenhydramine , and ranitidine .

case 2 a 52 - year - old woman with obesity and symptomatic , persistent af refractory to propafenone and flecainide underwent catheter ablation .
she was a nonsmoker without history of pulmonary disease .
she was placed under general anesthesia and mechanically ventilated using jet .
after isolating the pulmonary veins , 18 mg of adenosine was administered .
atrioventricular block and acute reconnection of the left superior pv were observed .
immediately following adenosine administration , the peak inspiratory pressure increased and oxygen saturation decreased from 99 % to 78 % .
auscultation demonstrated bilateral expiratory wheeze .
albuterol was administered with subsequent improvement in ventilation and recovery of oxygenation .
additional ablation lesions were delivered at the site of acute reconnection , following which 18 mg of adenosine was administered a second time .
again , she immediately developed bronchospasm , with increased peak inspiratory pressures and decreased oxygen saturation , which resolved within minutes following albuterol administration .
the procedure was successfully concluded without further administration of adenosine .
discussion adenosine has a short half - life and is typically given in low doses ( 6 or 12 mg ) .
well - known side effects of adenosine include chest pressure , facial flushing , and headache .
despite mixed results of published studies , adenosine is increasingly administered to assess for dormant conduction following pvi 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
further , in the context of af ablation , higher doses of adenosine ( 18 or 24 mg ) are often required to affect atrioventricular conduction , particularly in obese patients 5 .
given increasing utilization of high doses of adenosine during af ablation procedures , electrophysiologists should be aware of more serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and severe bronchospasm .
we describe two cases illustrating these infrequent , but serious reactions .
hypotension the differential diagnosis for acute hypotension during af ablation includes cardiac tamponade , vascular bleeding , pulmonary embolism , and medication induced .
in our patient ( case 1 ) , ice rapidly excluded cardiac tamponade , the groins were soft , and hemoglobin was unchanged .
ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis later ruled out bleeding entirely .
administration of protamine sulfate is well known to cause hypotension 6 .
we present a prolonged episode of hypotension in response to adenosine , lasting long after av conduction recovered .
the half - life of adenosine is short ( sec ) as it is rapidly taken up by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells and inactivated intracellularly , either via phosphorylation by adenosine kinase to adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) or by deamination to inosine via adenosine deaminase .
therefore , patient 1 's prolonged hypotension was highly unusual and presumed to be secondary to anaphylaxis , given the persistence of hypotension and associated flushing .
hypotension resolved following administration of epinephrine , diphenhydramine , and ranitidine .
anaphylactic reaction to adenosine has been previously reported 7 .
hypoxia the differential diagnosis of acute hypoxia during af ablation includes endotracheal tube dislodgement , mucus plug , pulmonary edema , and pulmonary embolism .
when occurring immediately after adenosine administration , one should suspect adenosine - induced bronchospasm , a well - described adverse effect 8 , 9 , 10 .
treatment includes inhaled bronchodilators such as albuterol .
additionally , inhaled anesthetic agents , such as sevoflurane , isoflurane , and halothane , may also mitigate bronchospasm .
conclusion with adenosine being increasingly used to assess for dormant conduction following pulmonary vein isolation , operators should be aware of infrequent yet serious adverse reactions , including prolonged hypotension from anaphylaxis , and severe bronchospasm .
prompt recognition will allow for timely treatment and avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic testing .

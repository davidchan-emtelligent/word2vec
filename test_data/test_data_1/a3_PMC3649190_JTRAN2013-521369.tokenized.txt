brain death is associated with dramatic and serious pathophysiologic changes that adversely affect both the quantity and quality of organs available for transplant .
to fully optimise the donor pool necessitates a more complete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of organ dysfunction associated with transplantation .
these injurious processes are initially triggered by catastrophic brain injury and are further enhanced during both brain death and graft transplantation .
the activated inflammatory systems then contribute to graft dysfunction in the recipient .
inflammatory mediators drive this process in concert with the innate and adaptive immune systems .
activation of deleterious immunological pathways in organ grafts occurs , priming them for further inflammation after engraftment .
finally , posttransplantation ischaemia reperfusion injury leads to further generation of inflammatory mediators and consequent activation of the recipient 's immune system .
ongoing research has identified key mediators that contribute to the inflammatory milieu inherent in brain dead organ donation .
this has seen the development of novel therapies that directly target the inflammatory cascade .
1. introduction organ transplantation is the gold standard treatment for patients with end stage solid organ failure .
an ever increasing disparity between available organs and potential recipients is the cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality [ 1 - 4 ] .
ongoing efforts are being made to increase the quantity and quality of organs available for transplant .
although outcomes from non - heart - beating donors have become increasingly successful [ 5 ] , the majority of organs are still donated from donors after brain death ( bd ) .
significant brain injury of any aetiology will cause a systemic response [ 6 ] , creating a proinflammatory environment prior to the occurrence of brain death itself .
bd then also creates a variety of inflammatory , haemodynamic and endocrine effects , which induce adverse sequelae in distant organs [ 7 - 10 ] .
finally , ischaemia - reperfusion injury ( iri ) , inherent in transplantation , generates reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , activates complement , and independently drives cytokine release and inflammation [ 11 , 12 ] .
every transplanted organ from a bd donor will face these stages of potential injury .
consequently , donor management must consider each step from donor to recipient in order to maximise recipient outcomes .
the purpose of this paper is to explore the current understanding of the three main contributors to injury that an organ will travel through from donor to recipient .
additionally , donor management and organ preservation strategies that are currently being investigated will be briefly considered .
2. stage zero of potential organ injury : current concepts in immunological signalling inflammation , secondary to brain injury , bd , and iri , is driven by both the innate and adaptive immune systems .
the complexity of these systems means that our understanding continues to evolve at a rapid pace ( figure 1 ) .
prior to reviewing the specific inflammatory responses at each major step of the donor organ journey , it is important to discuss current concepts in the normally functioning immune system .
traditionally , t - cell responses are grouped according to the th1 / th2 paradigm .
th1 lymphocytes ( cd4 +) are responsible for cell - mediated immunity through activation of killer cd8 + t cells and cytotoxic macrophages [ 13 , 14 ] .
th2 cells are responsible for the control of humoral immunity through antibody producing b cells .
additionally , they regulate eosinophil and basophil functions .
recent work has identified th17 and t - regulatory ( treg ) subsets .
th17 cells have been implicated in autoimmunity [ 13 , 14 ] .
treg cells are related to th17 cells and function to regulate immunological reactions and prevent uncontrolled inflammation .
each of these t cells plays a specific role in inflammation and their actions can be identified by certain inflammatory mediators .
although cytokines may interact with multiple t - cell subsets , previous authors have classified the major cytokines into " types " reflecting the major t - cell subtype to which they are related [ 15 - 18 ] .
this convention will be used in the current paper .
2.1 .
th1 - cell - related cytokines communicating via tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha , interleukin ( il ) - 1 , il - 2 , il - 12 , and ifn - gamma [ 19 - 21 ] , th1 cells play a fundamental role in acute rejection .
these type 1 cytokines are upregulated early in the inflammatory process .
after their release , il - 1beta and tnf - alpha support the inflammatory response via activation of endothelial cells [ 22 ] .
these cytokines act early in the inflammatory cascade , stimulating generation of cellular adhesion molecules , innate immune defence mechanisms , and participating in cross - talk between the various inflammatory pathways [ 23 , 24 ] .
il - 2 plays an essential role in resting t - cell activation and proliferation , contributing to t - cell maturation [ 25 ] .
after t - cell induction via il - 2 , il - 12 directs cellular maturation towards th1 , leading to a cell - mediated immune response [ 26 ] .
ifn - gamma influences both the innate and adaptive immune systems and is integral in the antigen presenting cell ( apc ) controlled balance between effector and suppressor t cells [ 27 ] .
ifn - gamma not only acts as the primary effector cytokine of il - 12 as part of cellular immunity , but also provides negative feedback control of il - 12 and indoleamine dioxygenase - mediated t - cell inhibition , under the control of apc 's [ 27 ] .
2.2 .
th2 - cell - related cytokines th2 cell - related - cytokines include il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 10 , and il - 13 [ 14 , 28 ] .
type 2 cytokines are generally considered anti - inflammatory when associated with brain injury and bd , and in the early transplant period [ 29 - 31 ] .
il - 4 inhibits formation of th1 cells and encourages development of th2 cells [ 29 ] .
it also plays an essential role in b - cell generation of ige [ 32 ] .
il - 4 may activate macrophages via an alternative pathway that reduces inflammation through sequestration and metabolism of arginine , an essential requirement for nitric oxide generation by inflammatory ifn - gamma - activated macrophages [ 33 ] .
il - 4 has been postulated to depress t - cell activity through the production of indoleamine dioxygenase ; wang et al. demonstrated increased indoleamine dioxygenase produced by natural killer cells in il - 4 - treated rat livers [ 33 ] .
il - 13 is best known for its role in allergy. through interaction with its receptor , il - 13 stimulates inflammatory cells as well as epithelial and smooth muscle cells [ 34 ] .
this may contribute to smooth muscle hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension in various lung diseases [ 34 ] .
il - 13 inhibits cell - mediated immunity through downregulation of e - selectin , reduction of neutrophil recruitment , and macrophage inhibition [ 35 ] .
il - 5 is essential for the development , recruitment and activation of eosinophils [ 36 ] .
once these cells are recruited to inflammatory sites , il - 5 is a potent costimulator of eosinophil degranulation and maintains their presence through inhibition of apoptosis [ 36 , 37 ] .
il - 5 also acts as a key mediator for generation of antigen - specific ige .
furthermore , it is important for terminal b - cell differentiation , including the switch to mature igm and igg1 secreting plasma cells [ 38 ] .
il - 10 acts to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and upregulate inhibitors of il - 1 and tnf [ 15 ] .
it may also specifically block the production of il - 1 and tnf [ 39 ] .
direct activity on inflammatory cells impairs or reverses the effects of proinflammatory mediators [ 39 ] .
while il - 10 is classified as a type 2 cytokine , it is also able to be produced by th1 cells under the influence of transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta [ 19 ] .
2.3 .
th17 - cell - related cytokines the th17 cells are identified by their association with il - 6 , il - 17 , il - 21 , il - 22 , and il - 23 [ 14 , 26 , 40 ] .
il - 17 and il - 23 direct th17 cell differentiation , proliferation , and maturation [ 26 ] .
apart from directing th17 development , il - 17 functions to stimulate production of chemokines , il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , il - 6 , and il - 8 [ 19 , 41 ] .
its production is reinforced by il - 6 , il - 23 , and tgf - beta [ 19 , 41 ] .
il - 8 - related neutrophil attraction and activation may contribute partly to the inflammatory action of il - 17 [ 42 ] .
il - 23 is an important upstream regulator of il - 17 expression [ 26 , 43 ] .
generation of il - 17 by gammadelta - t cells is directly activated by il - 23 , and these cells are an important source of il - 17 [ 43 ] .
furthermore , il - 23 induces il - 17 production from natural killer t cells [ 41 ] .
il - 21 stimulates natural killer t cells , cd40 dependent b - cell proliferation , and t - cell expansion [ 44 ] .
hagn et al. recently demonstrated that incompletely activated cd4 + t cells , through expression of il - 21 and cd40 ligand , stimulate b cells to differentiate into granzyme b generating cytotoxic b cells [ 45 ] .
il - 6 has been extensively investigated in many conditions .
it 's pro - and anti - inflammatory effects have recently been comprehensively reviewed [ 46 ] .
briefly , it is a pro - inflammatory agent which has been classified as a type 17 cytokine [ 47 ] , although some authors may include it as a type 1 [ 48 ] .
il - 6 , the prototypical member of its family , acts through receptor complex formation with glycoprotein gp130 on the cell surface [ 46 ] .
the il - 6 receptor molecule is present on the surface of hepatocytes , neutrophils , monocytes , and macrophages [ 46 , 49 ] .
direct activation of these receptors is associated with an inflammatory response [ 49 ] .
other cells may also respond to il - 6 through a process termed trans - signalling [ 49 ] .
free soluble il - 6 receptor binds circulating il - 6 and then interacts with the ubiquitous cell surface protein , gp130 , to affect cell signalling [ 46 ] .
the dual roles of il - 6 may be partly explained by the differing signalling mechanisms .
soluble il - 6 receptor generated from apoptotic neutrophils in areas of inflammation activates signalling pathways after interaction with epithelial gp130 , attracting regulatory monocytes and macrophages and contributing to resolution of inflammation [ 46 ] .
2.4 .
treg cells and related cytokines named due to their ability to downregulate inflammatory processes , treg cells are another important source of the anti - inflammatory il - 10 .
treg are closely related to th17 cells ; both lineages are derived from the same naive t - cell precursor in a similar fashion to th1 / th2 cells [ 14 , 20 ] .
deknuydt et al. recently highlighted the fluidity of the th17 / treg balance by demonstrating that treg cells can be stimulated to become th17 cells under the influence of il - 1beta and il - 2 [ 14 ] .
tgf - beta also directs the differentiation of t - cell populations in inflammatory conditions and is important in the th17 / treg balance .
tgf - beta modulates the effects of il - 2 , reducing expansion of inflammatory t - cell populations [ 19 ] .
when acting synergistically with il - 2 , tgf - beta is able to direct naive t cells to become treg cells [ 50 ] .
selective inhibition of th1 producing mediators by tgf - beta further contributes to the diversion from inflammatory t cells to treg cells , mediating the inflammatory response [ 19 ] .
however , costimulation of tgf - beta by il - 6 directs t - cell differentiation towards th17 cells and production of type 17 cytokines [ 20 ] .
treg cells are immunosuppressive through production of il - 10 and tgf - beta , cellular anergy and direct contact with inflammatory cells [ 51 ] .
3. stage one of potential organ injury : brain injury most brain dead donors suffer from three main causes of bd : cerebrovascular injury , anoxia , or traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) [ 52 , 53 ] .
donor cause of death can significantly influence recipient survival rates , though this varies according to the organ .
renal transplant outcomes are adversely affected by cerebrovascular causes of bd [ 54 , 55 ] .
lung transplant is unaffected by donor cause of death [ 56 ] , while heart transplant outcomes remain controversial [ 57 , 58 ] .
for this reason , it is important to consider the pathophysiologic responses to severe central nervous system injury , and their systemic sequelae , prior to brain death .
3.1 .
systemic inflammatory response secondary to brain injury central nervous system ( cns ) injury is associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) .
this can occur with an intact blood brain barrier ( bbb ) , indicating an additional mechanism distinct from cns - derived cytokine release [ 59 , 60 ] .
the link between the brain and sirs has been comprehensively reviewed recently by lu et al .
[ 61 ] .
briefly , sirs is associated with leukocyte mobilisation and recruitment to major organs , activation and release of inflammatory mediators , generation of ros , increased vascular permeability , and organ dysfunction [ 62 , 63 ] .
brain intraparenchymal injection of tnf - alpha recruits and activates systemic monocytes while il - 1beta activates and recruits neutrophils via release of chemokines from the liver [ 59 , 64 ] .
tnf - alpha is released from the spleen in the early stages of brain injury to augment the peripheral inflammatory response [ 6 , 65 ] .
lee et al. demonstrated upregulation of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 4 , and il - 6 in the spleens of rats with subarachnoid haemorrhage ( sah ) [ 65 ] .
intravenous administration of neural stem cells attenuated the inflammatory response via a chaperone mechanism which was localised to the spleen and reversed on splenectomy [ 65 ] .
splenic inflammation may also be directly downregulated via vagal messages from the brain [ 6 ] .
the sirs response activates gut - derived inflammatory mediators , resulting in leaky gut wall [ 66 ] .
this contributes to global inflammation through cytokine generation and systemic endotoxin exposure , worsening pulmonary inflammation and impairing oxygenation [ 66 - 68 ] .
similar to the spleen , gut generation of cytokines is also modulated by the cns through vagal input [ 67 ] .
3.2 .
localised response to brain injury and loss of blood brain barrier function local responses to severe brain injury can be classified into two phases [ 69 ] .
the primary phase is due to the insult itself and includes cellular death , direct bbb disruption , and cerebral oedema [ 69 ] .
the secondary phase of injury is caused by elevated intracranial pressure ( icp ) , global brain ischaemia , excitotoxicity , metabolic derangements , and haemodynamic instability [ 69 - 71 ] .
whatever the cause of brain death , a cytokinaemia secondary to brain injury occurs prior to brain death itself [ 72 - 75 ] .
local inflammation , and the direct effect of the insult itself , causes the highly selective bbb to become disrupted [ 74 , 76 ] .
matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) , especially mmp - 9 , act to break down extracellular proteins , including basal lamina and endothelial tight junctions [ 77 ] .
in a rat model of closed head trauma , higashida et al. investigated the role of mmp - 9 and hypoxia inducible factor ( hif ) in cerebral oedema resulting from lost bbb integrity [ 77 ] .
inhibition of mmp - 9 in this model significantly reduced the amount of brain oedema observed after 24 hours .
additionally , inhibition of hif ( an upstream regulator of protein expression associated with hypoxia ) also significantly reduced the expression of mmp - 9 and brain oedema [ 77 ] .
this observation was confirmed in an intracranial haemorrhage model in rats ; wu et al. showed that mmp - 9 is upregulated early after injury and is associated with brain oedema [ 78 ] .
a postmortem study of intracranial haemorrhage confirmed these findings in humans [ 79 ] .
the effect of the loss of bbb integrity is to allow bidirectional access of inflammatory cells and mediators [ 76 , 80 - 84 ] .
cns - derived cytokines are then free to interact at receptors within the systemic tissues , inducing local inflammation and " priming " organs for further injury [ 81 , 85 ] .
the importance of brain injury - derived cytokinaemia was recently demonstrated by graetz et al. , who reviewed compartmental levels of il - 6 in sah and found that elevated plasma il - 6 is associated with increased mortality [ 72 ] .
this provides further evidence that isolated brain injury causes a systemic inflammatory response and upregulates the peripheral immune system [ 67 , 83 ] .
3.3 .
type 1 cytokines type 1 cytokines are upregulated in the brain after injury and contribute to bbb breakdown , vasospasm , and secondary injury [ 70 , 86 , 87 ] .
the general roles of these and other inflammatory mediators have been previously reviewed [ 88 ] .
briefly , il - 1beta is a pleiotropic proinflammatory mediator that stimulates multiple pathways of inflammation after brain injury [ 88 ] .
tnf - alpha acts as a proinflammatory agent early in the inflammatory process in the cns [ 89 ] .
microdialysis techniques have confirmed the presence of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha in extracellular fluid after tbi and sah [ 72 , 87 , 90 ] .
both of these cytokines are also released peripherally as part of a systemic acute phase response ( apr ) [ 6 , 59 , 91 , 92 ] .
il - 1beta and tnf - alpha can be detected in blood within as little as one hour after brain ischaemia , even before significant neuronal cell death can be demonstrated [ 83 , 93 ] .
quantitative systemic levels of type 1 cytokines may be affected by the type of brain insult ; these were decreased in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice , partially explaining the mechanism of the observed shift from th1 - to th2 - driven immunity after - stroke [ 16 ] .
the soluble tnf receptors ( tnfr ) , p55 and p75 , also contribute to the inflammatory process in traumatic brain injury , though the specifics of their involvement are not currently clear [ 84 ] .
they act as anti - inflammatory agents through free tnf scavenging , although tnfr levels are more closely correlated to mortality in potential donors than tnf itself [ 84 , 89 ] .
this observation may actually reflect an imbalance in pro - and anti - inflammatory mechanisms or simply be due to the very short half - life of tnf [ 84 ] .
3.4 .
type 2 cytokines a recent study of stroke in il - 4 knockout mice showed that il - 4 reduces the th1 : th2 cell ratio and infarct volume , and improves neurological outcome [ 29 ] .
studies in humans have shown that brain - derived il - 4 can be detected in the jugular vein in patients with serious head injury [ 94 ] .
a post - mortem study of tbi patients confirmed elevated il - 4 in brain tissue [ 70 ] .
il - 13 has been less studied in brain injury .
one in vitro study of il - 13 and il - 4 did show that these mediators induced apoptosis of activated microglia , which may account for part of the observed anti - inflammatory effect [ 95 ] .
il - 13 is not significantly elevated in the plasma after tbi [ 31 ] .
il - 10 , a type 2 cytokine with anti - inflammatory properties [ 29 , 30 ] , plays a protective role in the cns , reducing infarct size in stroke patients [ 39 , 96 ] .
analysis of post - mortem tbi brains confirmed the presence of il - 10 , though levels were more modest than similarly identified pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 70 ] .
this was consistent with intraparenchymal levels measured by microdialysis in tbi and sah patients [ 90 ] .
overflow of il - 10 into the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) after tbi has also been demonstrated [ 97 ] .
systemic il - 10 levels peak early in tbi patients , declining to baseline within 48 hours [ 84 ] .
although il - 10 decreases inflammation through its immunomodulatory action , it also increases susceptibility to infection through immune system downregulation [ 96 ] .
3.5 .
type 17 cytokines in the cns , il - 6 plays a dichotomous role through modulation of glial responses and neuronal survival , contributing to the early inflammatory response , but modulating later inflammatory pathways to assist with brain recovery [ 89 , 98 - 100 ] .
while its proinflammatory role is well known , it has also been shown to protect against excitotoxicity in vitro and brain ischaemic or excitotoxic states in vivo [ 98 ] .
the specifics of how this balance are achieved are less clear [ 98 ] .
one suggestion is that the role of il - 6 depends on the amount of neuronal cell damage and is concentration dependent , but it is also probably subject to negative feedback inhibition via crosstalk between nmda and il - 6 receptors [ 98 ] .
it may also downregulate inflammation through stimulating il - 1 receptor antagonist [ 90 ] .
microdialysis techniques have confirmed that il - 6 is acutely increased after brain injury [ 72 , 73 ] .
furthermore , graetz et al. demonstrated that il - 6 is released from the brain parenchyma into the systemic circulation after brain injury , particularly in the presence of high icp [ 72 ] .
previous studies have also shown that il - 6 interferes with bbb integrity [ 72 , 80 ] .
similar to il - 4 , il - 6 is detectable in jugular blood , and the transcranial gradient correlates with poor outcome in tbi [ 72 , 80 ] .
the apr is stimulated by circulating il - 6 [ 101 ] and this may provide a link between central injury and the peripheral immune response seen with intracranial injury [ 83 ] .
the roles of il - 17 and il - 23 in acute brain injury remain to be fully elucidated .
while a role has been established in central autoimmune disorders including experimental models of multiple sclerosis [ 13 ] , less has been published on acute cns injury .
murine models demonstrate that both of these interleukins are locally upregulated after stroke [ 102 - 104 ] .
currently , there are no published data on their peripheral release after acute brain injury .
3.6 .
the endothelin axis in brain injury endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) is the most active member of a family of small polypeptides which are potent vasoconstrictors , mitogens of smooth muscle cells , and stimulators of fibroblasts ( table 1 ) [ 105 - 109 ] .
et - 1 is an important mediator in tbi , stroke , and sah [ 110 - 113 ] .
in acute brain injury , et - 1 leads to constriction of large vessels , altering the normal balance between vascular relaxation and constriction , resulting in impaired cerebral blood flow [ 113 ] .
this alteration of blood flow has been targeted in studies of sah [ 114 ] .
clazosentan , an et receptor a antagonist , reduces large cerebral artery vasospasm in murine models , but this did not reduce other mechanisms of secondary brain injury [ 114 ] .
salonia et al. analysed csf levels of et - 1 in paediatric head trauma [ 113 ] .
they found that et - 1 is significantly elevated after injury and remains so for up to 5 days .
central production of et - 1 in adult tbi was confirmed by chatfield et al .
[ 111 ] .
their analysis of the juguloarterial gradient showed that et - 1 is produced intracranially and spills over into the systemic circulation .
4. stage two of potential organ injury : brain death serious brain injury , augmented by local inflammation , may eventually lead to an irretrievable state of impaired brain function and brain death .
bd then further causes a massive autonomic storm and cytokinaemia which increases the inflammatory state of the individual [ 126 , 140 , 141 ] .
a complex interplay of immunologic [ 142 ] , coagulopathic [ 143 ] , autonomic , haemodynamic , and endocrine [ 144 , 145 ] dysregulation drives inflammation through local and global cytokine release , cellular activation , organ priming , iri , and secondary ischaemic insult ( figure 2 ) .
4.1 .
the autonomic nervous system during brain death brain stem dysfunction is associated with extreme physiological perturbations due to its " master control " function [ 146 - 148 ] .
brain stem failure secondary to high icp occurs in a rostrocaudal direction , with initial hypertension and bradycardia ( classically known as cushing 's reflex [ 149 , 150 ]) , followed by an intense " sympathetic storm " which remains unopposed due to ischaemia of the parasympathetic vagal nucleus [ 151 , 152 ] .
this storm results from an overwhelming release of catecholamines in an attempt to perfuse the brain by increasing the mean arterial pressure ( map ) to overcome the elevated icp [ 153 , 154 ] .
such changes in autonomic outflow can be detected prior to the occurrence of brain death [ 155 ] .
the initial massive upsurge in sympathetic tone results in widespread vasoconstriction and microthrombus formation , impairing organ and tissue perfusion [ 146 ] .
as the icp outpaces the map , ischaemia progresses down the brain stem , sympathetic centres become necrotic , vascular and myocardial sympathetic stimulation drops and a second phase of hypotension ensues [ 146 , 156 , 157 ] .
the resulting uncontrolled hypotension further impairs the already tenuous end organ perfusion that resulted during the sympathetic storm [ 156 ] .
while the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are the most obvious clinically during and after bd , inflammatory and haemodynamic responses are also influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system ( pns ) .
the effect of bd is to inhibit pns - mediated anti - inflammatory responses by direct destruction of vagal centres in the brain stem [ 67 ] .
under normal conditions , vagal stimulation directly decreases inflammation via cholinergic receptors on inflammatory cells [ 158 , 159 ] .
central activation of vagal efferent pathways downregulates inflammation in the brain , gut , and spleen [ 6 , 67 ] .
balance is normally achieved through negative feedback by the innate immune system interacting with the pns via il - 1 receptors in the parasympathetic paraganglia [ 67 ] .
4.2 .
cytokine upregulation after brain death 4.2.1 .
type 1 - associated cytokines cytokine upregulation after bd has been recognised for many years [ 66 , 160 ] .
animal models have shown that serum levels of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha may be influenced by the rate of induction of brain death [ 22 , 161 ] .
avlonitis et al. reported that explosive brain death induced a rapid increase in il - 1beta , with significantly elevated levels detectable within one hour , remaining so throughout the duration of the study [ 161 ] .
tnf - alpha levels initially rose and then decreased by five hours , though it remained above baseline [ 161 ] .
zhu et al. showed that gradual induction of brain death leads to steady elevation of il - 1beta over 24 hours in a pig model [ 162 ] .
conversely , damman and colleagues , utilising gradual bd induction in a rat model , showed that il - 1beta and tnf - alpha did not change significantly over the four hours of their study [ 101 ] .
interestingly , this group also analysed serum cytokine levels in human bd donors and showed that they were not significantly elevated [ 101 ] .
cypel and colleagues recently reported that tnf - alpha and il - 1beta mrna are significantly elevated in lungs rejected for transplant , highlighting the clinical importance of these proinflammatory cytokines [ 163 ] .
4.2.2 .
type 2 - associated cytokines including il - 10 early studies of cytokine upregulation after bd suggested that type 2 cytokines are not significant contributors to bd - induced inflammation [ 160 ] .
takada et al. did not show upregulation of il - 4 in rat kidneys , hearts , livers , or lungs after bd [ 160 ] .
weiss et al. studied cytokine expression at various timepoints during the liver transplantation process [ 91 ] .
this group reported that il - 4 expression is increased after brain death [ 91 ] .
il - 10 is elevated in the plasma of human bd donors [ 66 , 123 , 126 ] .
additionally , il - 10 has been shown to be upregulated in human livers [ 91 ] and kidneys [ 164 ] .
work undertaken by li et al. suggested that il - 10 expression after bd may be important in stimulating apoptosis of graft infiltrating lymphocytes through activation of the fas / fas ligand pathway [ 165 ] .
there is little published in the literature investigating the role of il - 5 and il - 13 during brain death .
this may be an area for future research .
4.2.3 .
type 17 - associated cytokines il - 6 is heavily implicated in bd - related inflammation [ 127 , 128 ] , where it is an important instigator of the generalised apr [ 101 ] .
the levels increase in human brain dead donors up until the time of organ retrieval [ 101 ] .
systemic venous and cns - derived il - 6 is significantly higher at brain death than at admission to the intensive care unit ( icu ) in tbi patients that progress to bd [ 80 ] .
brain death induces the production of il - 6 in multiple organs , including the kidney [ 166 ] , heart [ 167 ] , liver [ 168 ] , and lung [ 141 ] .
il - 6 signalling induces nitric oxide synthase in cardiac myocytes [ 167 ] and contributes to early haemodynamic compromise in the donor via direct negative inotropy [ 121 , 127 ] .
il - 6 mrna and protein are elevated in nonstructural donor heart dysfunction [ 167 ] .
damman et al. recently investigated il - 6 - related renal acute phase protein synthesis in rats [ 101 ] .
as expected , il - 6 was upregulated after brain death .
this correlated with an increase in renal acute phase proteins , notably complement 3 ( c3 ) , fibrinogen , alpha2 - macroglobulin , and haptoglobin [ 101 ] .
furthermore , in vitro analysis indicated that renal production of c3 is directly related to il - 6 exposure [ 101 ] .
overall , elevated plasma levels of il - 6 are associated with poorer transplantation outcomes [ 91 , 168 ] .
murugan and colleagues demonstrated an inverse relationship between donor plasma il - 6 levels and recipient six - month hospital - free survival [ 126 ] .
kaneda et al. also showed that higher donor il - 6 levels increased the risk of recipient death within 30 days of lung transplant [ 169 ] .
th17 cells , through production of il - 17 , stimulate inflammation in donor organs [ 170 ] .
pretransplant renal biopsies from deceased donors showed little elevation of il - 17 positive cells , though few graft infiltrating cells were demonstrated in the biopsy samples [ 170 ] .
although a number of authors have studied il - 17 in the context of chronic rejection , the role of bd donor il - 17 currently remains unexplored .
4.2.4 .
treg - associated cytokines tgf - beta is upregulated in heart and lung tissue in animal models [ 81 ] .
elevated tgf - beta mrna has been identified in renal and liver biopsies from brain dead donors [ 91 , 164 ] .
weiss et al. showed that the greatest stimulus for tgf - beta expression in liver grafts is bd itself [ 91 ] .
a slight decrease in expression occurred prior to cold storage and to reperfusion .
tgf - beta mrna expression increased by one hour after implantation and reperfusion but did not exceed levels measured before surgical manipulation ( i.e. , after bd alone ) [ 91 ] .
skrabal et al. also demonstrated that tgf - beta mrna transcription is increased in donor heart and lungs in a porcine model of brain death [ 81 ] .
the role of tgf - beta in acute organ injury may relate to its role in the th17 / treg balance [ 20 , 50 ] ; however , increased expression prior to transplantation may start fibrotic processes through activation of mmp 's and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( timp 's ) .
mmp - 2 , - 9 , timp - 1 , and - 2 expression is increased after bd in pulmonary tissue [ 115 ] .
4.2.5 .
interleukin 8 il - 8 is a chemokine which attracts and activates neutrophils [ 132 , 171 ] .
similar to other cytokines , il - 8 is produced peripherally after bd where it stimulates neutrophil - driven angiogenesis and fibroproliferation [ 132 , 172 ] .
il - 8 - induced neovascularisation , alveolar - capillary disruption , and extracellular matrix deposition contribute to the development of acute lung injury after brain death [ 132 ] .
in lung donors , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid il - 8 levels are positively correlated with neutrophil infiltration in pretransplant lung tissue , contributing to early graft dysfunction [ 132 ] .
4.2.6 .
the endothelin axis et - 1 release from endothelium is stimulated by noradrenaline , thrombin , and tgf - beta [ 139 ] .
animal experiments have shown that et - 1 is upregulated in serum and in donor lung after bd and that this is related to mmp activation [ 115 , 173 ] .
salama et al. demonstrated a correlation between donor et - 1 and primary graft dysfunction ( pgd ) [ 174 ] .
in this study , et - 1 upregulation ( as measured by donor lung mrna and donor serum levels ) adversely affected recipients after transplantation , contributing to the development of pgd .
5. stage three of potential organ injury : ischaemia reperfusion injury ischaemia reperfusion injury is implicated in early and late stage transplant complications [ 175 ] .
iri leads to organ dysfunction through induction of cytokines , generation of free radicals , and activation of immunocompetent cells [ 175 , 176 ] .
endothelial cell dysfunction secondary to iri is a key contributor to chronic allograft dysfunction in hearts [ 177 ] , lungs [ 11 ] , livers [ 178 ] , and kidneys [ 179 ] .
early injury to cells occurs as a direct result of ischaemia , with impaired oxygen delivery , altered energy metabolism , and accumulation of waste products .
cell death occurs through necrosis and apoptosis , the latter through caspase signalling [ 66 , 180 ] .
further injury occurs upon reperfusion , with recruitment of inflammatory cells , interaction between local and systemic cytokine signalling systems , and generation of ros [ 127 , 181 , 182 ] .
apc 's of the innate immune system play a key role providing antigens and costimulatory molecules to activate the adaptive immune system , contributing to iri and early graft dysfunction .
activation of cellular immunity can be classified as direct or indirect [ 181 ] .
direct activation occurs due to the transfer of donor apc 's in the allograft , which activate recipient th1 cells [ 181 ] .
atkinson et al. recently demonstrated that passenger leukocytes are recruited to donor hearts after bd in a murine model [ 22 ] .
this finding was also confirmed in lung [ 183 ] and renal allografts [ 184 ] .
gelman et al. also demonstrated that recipient t cells interact with donor apc 's and that this is sufficient to activate an inflammatory response [ 183 ] .
alternatively , the indirect pathway results from the interaction of recipient apc 's with native t cells to stimulate inflammation .
5.1 .
contribution of preservation strategies to cytokine expression hypothermic preservation strategies are widely used to decrease inflammation , depress the metabolic rate of cells , and reduce the effects of ischaemia [ 185 ] .
however , cold storage does cause cell death via both apoptosis and necrosis [ 15 ] .
bd donor organs predominantly display the latter mechanism [ 178 ] .
the duration and type ( warm or cold ) of ischaemic time may also directly influence cytokine production .
a correlation was recently identified between cold ischaemia time and levels of il - 1 and il - 8 in human liver transplants [ 186 ] .
warm ischaemia time correlated with il - 6 and il - 10 in the same study .
significantly , the authors found that the excess cytokines generated by hepatic graft warm ischaemia time resulted in systemic adverse effects , most notably increased intraoperative pulmonary shunt [ 186 ] .
another study found that , while cold ischaemic time per se did not adversely affect liver function , the associated graft - generated il - 8 did correlate with pgd [ 187 ] .
weiss et al. , in a study of transplanted human livers , showed that il - 4 was increased in bd donors prior to explantation , but cold ischaemia and reperfusion did not result in further increases in the cytokine [ 91 ] .
indeed , while it was elevated compared to living donors , it failed to reach statistical significance at time points other than immediately after laparotomy .
il - 10 was highly expressed prior to organ preservation , but cold ischaemia and reperfusion did not result in further elevation of this cytokine [ 91 ] .
livers from living donors showed a relatively greater increase in expression of il - 10 one hour after reperfusion than bd organs , which may partially contribute to better outcomes with organs from these donors [ 91 ] .
delayed graft function in transplanted kidneys has been shown to be dependent on cold ischaemic time [ 170 ] .
kaminska et al. showed that while cytokine upregulation occurred , associated with brain death , mrna expression did not increase further after cold ischaemia and prior to reperfusion [ 164 ] .
in keeping with this , de vries et al. were unable to detect an arteriovenous difference across human bd donor kidneys for multiple cytokines , including il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 10 , and il - 13 [ 184 ] .
cold ischaemia and reperfusion do not induce excess tgf - beta mrna production , indicating that the primary stimulus for this mediator is brain death itself [ 164 ] .
5.2 .
other mediators of ischaemia reperfusion injury the combination of bd and iri activates allografts greater than either insult alone .
kusaka et al. studied rat renal isografts to analyse gene activation after bd , iri , or combined bd / iri [ 175 ] .
they found that bd primarily upregulated cytokines , chemokines and adhesion molecules while iri tended to upregulate transcription factors .
combined bd / iri was synergistic in enhancing upregulation of these genes .
more recent work has maintained these findings .
inhibition of jnk , a phosphorylator of the transcription factor c - jun , decreases iri - induced renal damage in rats [ 179 ] .
in humans , de vries et al. demonstrated that reperfusion of bd kidneys generates higher cytokine levels than living donor allografts ( i.e. , those that only underwent iri ) [ 184 ] .
complement interacts with , and reinforces , the inflammatory process of iri by increasing tnf - alpha and il - 1 [ 22 ] .
c3a and c5a , potent anaphylatoxins generated by the complement cascade , activate mast cells and neutrophils [ 182 ] .
while the specific mechanism of complement activation in bd is unknown , it is postulated that ischaemia leads to defects in cell membranes , uncovering neoepitopes via exposure of internal cellular components to the humoral immune system , which leads to interaction with natural igm and activation of the classical complement pathway [ 182 ] .
ros generated during infarction and iri may lead to lipid peroxidation and alteration of cellular cytoskeletal structure providing further neoepitopes for igm [ 182 ] .
the importance of toll - like receptors ( tlr ) in iri is currently being investigated .
it was previously noted that low levels of lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) may precondition and therefore protect the lung from iri [ 188 ] .
merry et al. demonstrated that low - dose preconditioning with lps in rat lung ischaemia reduced injury [ 188 ] .
the authors postulated that this may be due to lps activating tlr - 4 via an alternative pathway that results in protective interferon and il - 10 generation .
unfortunately , they did not measure il - 10 protein or mrna to confirm this hypothesis .
the role of tlr 's in renal iri has recently been reviewed elsewhere [ 12 ] .
tlrs may also contribute to inflammation through interaction with t cells via cytokine signalling .
apc tlr activation leads to generation of cytokines , including il - 6 , which may decrease the sensitivity of th1 cells to the immunosuppressive effects of treg cells [ 189 ] .
additionally , tlr on treg cells may directly inhibit their immunosuppressive effects [ 189 ] .
et - 1 contributes to iri through activated neutrophils , leading to endothelial injury , neutrophil superoxide production and generation of ros [ 115 ] .
both et - 1 and its receptors are upregulated in the lungs after brain death [ 115 ] .
alveolar macrophages have been demonstrated to increase expression of endothelin receptors in the donor lung in animal models [ 115 ] .
this may then prime passenger macrophages for further activation by recipient et - 1 , which is generated in the pro - inflammatory environment of chronic lung disease , surgery , and the posttransplant course [ 115 , 190 ] .
heme - oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) is essential for the metabolism of heme to carbon monoxide , free iron , and biliverdin [ 25 ] .
its ability to reduce injury secondary to iri , with resulting better recipient outcomes after transplantation , has been the subject of much research .
ho - 1 exerts its beneficial effects through antioxidant , antiapoptotic , and anti - inflammatory mechanisms [ 25 , 191 - 193 ] .
carbon monoxide contributes to these beneficial effects through inhibiting t - cell proliferation and il - 2 secretion [ 25 ] .
zhou et al. , in studying a rat model of bd , demonstrated improved lung function and decreased lung injury when carbon monoxide was administered at 250 ppm [ 194 ] .
carbon monoxide decreased myeloperoxidase activity , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 [ 194 ] .
more recently , the same group demonstrated that both carbon monoxide and biliverdin reduce myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine signalling while improving respiratory mechanics in rat lung after bd [ 195 ] .
ho - 1 has also been linked to anti - inflammatory cytokine generation .
il - 10 production secondary to ho - 1 is increased in both bd [ 192 ] and non - bd models [ 196 ] .
ho - 1 may also be an important mediator of il - 13 's anti - inflammatory effect [ 191 , 197 ] .
6. management implications and potential future directions recipients of organs from brain dead donors continue to have poorer outcomes than those that receive living donor organs .
aggressive donor management ( adm ) improves both quality and quantity of organs available for transplant [ 198 ] .
current adm recommendations include early identification of potential donors , icu admission , pulmonary artery catheterisation , aggressive fluid management , vasopressors , hormonal resuscitation therapy , pulmonary toilet , and bronchoscopy [ 148 , 199 - 202 ] .
even with adm , up to 25 % of potential donors are lost due to haemodynamic instability [ 148 ] .
studies comparing use of noradrenaline and vasopressin as pressor agents demonstrate differing effects on transplantable organs .
although no studies directly comparing these agents in humans have been published , animal models suggest that both agents decrease lung inflammation and serum cytokine release [ 68 ] .
while a similar effect is seen in the kidney , hepatic inflammation is increased by both agents [ 203 ] .
dopamine decreased monocyte kidney graft infiltration and markers of inflammation in a rat model of bd [ 193 ] .
additionally , dopamine increased the expression of ho - 1 [ 193 ] .
regardless of the agents used , the evidence supports that aggressive haemodynamic monitoring and management do convert marginal donors to acceptable donors [ 141 , 145 ] .
the inflammatory cascade may be downregulated by adm .
currently , there are no standard interventions specifically directed at individual cytokines , though many are being investigated ( table 2 ) .
steroid administration , as part of hormonal resuscitation , is now commonplace in the management of organ donors and , in addition to addressing a relatively inadequate adrenal response , reduces inflammatory cytokines to levels similar to living donors [ 141 , 151 , 168 ] .
other methods directly addressing anti - inflammatory mechanisms are currently being investigated .
gene transfer of il - 10 holds great promise .
manning and colleagues investigated viral il - 10 ( viril - 10 ) transfer into a rat model of lung iri using mesenchymal stem cells [ 11 ] .
this study showed that viril - 10 was detectable in the lungs and that presence of this cytokine was related to improved lung function , less microscopic pathology , and decreased lung oedema at four hours after injury .
gene transfer pretreatment of rat liver grafts to generate recombinant human il - 10 significantly decreases iri and markers of apoptosis , with upregulation of ho - 1 and the antiapoptotic agent , bcl - 2 [ 15 ] .
ho - 1 may then act as a downstream regulator of protective mechanisms in iri [ 15 ] .
ho - 1 or its metabolites ( carbon monoxide and biliverdin ) may offer potential therapeutic benefits [ 25 , 192 , 194 , 195 ] .
overexpression of ho - 1 , through adeno - associated virus gene transfer , was associated with a beneficial increase in ho - 1 expression [ 192 ] .
this resulted in downregulation of il - 2 and tnf - alpha , decreased infiltration of cytotoxic and helper t - cells , and an increase in il - 10 , tgf - beta , and treg infiltration in transplanted rat livers [ 192 ] .
il - 13 gene transfer in rat livers increased ho - 1 expression with reduced evidence of iri [ 197 ] .
inhibition of ho - 1 activity reversed this effect , suggesting that part of il - 13 's anti - inflammatory properties in iri is mediated by ho - 1 [ 197 ] .
hypothermic ischaemic storage prior to transplantation does not allow sufficient metabolic activity for gene transfer to be beneficial [ 204 ] .
cypel et al. therefore trialled an ex vivo lung perfusion ( evlp ) model to transfer recombinant human il - 10 genes into porcine lungs [ 204 ] .
perfusate il - 10 was increased while il - 6 decreased .
this effect was maintained after transplantation and four hours of reperfusion .
lung function , as assessed by pao2 : fio2 ratio , was significantly improved in the transfected lungs .
when transfection was trialled in human lungs rejected for transplantation , cypel and colleagues found similar results including improved gas exchange and pulmonary vascular resistance [ 204 ] .
lung conditioning using evlp is able to improve the function of lungs initially rejected for transplant [ 205 ] .
sadaria et al. have established a baseline cytokine profile of human lungs undergoing evlp [ 205 ] .
cytokine analysis during 12 hours of evlp showed an upregulation in il - 6 , il - 8 , g - csf , and mcp - 1 [ 205 ] .
il - 1beta , il - 4 , il - 7 , il - 12 , and tnf - alpha were detectable but remained unchanged [ 205 ] .
il - 17 was undetectable , as were il - 10 and il - 13 [ 205 ] .
kakishita et al. also investigated the cytokine profile of evlp in pigs [ 206 ] .
inflammatory cytokines were similarly elevated .
interestingly , based on a previously published concept of haemoadsorption of cytokines [ 123 ] , kakishita investigated the benefit removing perfusate cytokines within the circuit .
cytokine levels were significantly reduced with haemoadsorption , but oxygenation , pulmonary vascular resistance , peak airway pressure , and myeloperoxidase activity ( as a marker of neutrophil accumulation ) were not statistically different [ 206 ] .
numerous other agents have been investigated as part of organ protection and preservation strategies .
donor simvastatin may reduce iri in cardiac allografts [ 177 ] .
this agent appears to work through multiple mechanisms and provides a lasting effect after a single dose to the donor prior to graft removal [ 177 ] .
organ donors in this animal model were not brain dead ; therefore , simvastatin 's effects seem to be related to downregulation of ischaemia reperfusion injury .
a study of n - acetylcysteine after pig non - bd lung transplantation demonstrated increased glutathione and downregulation of the inflammatory transcription factor nfkappab in tissue samples [ 171 ] .
il - 6 and il - 8 levels were also reduced .
lung function was improved despite extended cold ischaemia and reperfusion [ 171 ] .
intraoperative administration of n - acetylcysteine to human liver transplant recipients significantly increased the transhepatic gradient of il - 4 and il - 10 around the time of reperfusion , but not at other measured time points [ 207 ] .
the authors theorised that the presence of these anti - inflammatory cytokines at reperfusion may benefit recipients through downregulation of inflammation .
unfortunately , although the agent was administered as a continuous infusion for 24 hours , no further information is given about levels of cytokines later than the first hour of transplant , nor any information about hepatic biochemistry and patient outcomes .
in renal transplantation , carbamylated erythropoietin ( epo ) downregulated renal il - 1beta and il - 6 in a rat model of brain death [ 166 ] .
this agent retains the protective effects of epo without stimulating haematopoiesis [ 166 ] .
utilising an isolated perfused kidney circuit , nijboer and colleagues demonstrated that carbamylated epo downregulated il - 1beta and il - 6 , reduced neutrophil infiltration , and reversed brain death - induced renal impairment. of note , other authors are also investigating epo in preventing brain iri [ 208 ] .
such use in pre - bd conditions may eventually spill over to benefit the recipients of organs from these patients in the case of nonsurvival .
further research is required into the impact of pre - bd management of organ donors .
there are substantial data examining the management of tbi or sah patients which specifically addresses inflammatory / anti - inflammatory interventions and long - term recovery .
the impact of such management on the transplanted organs of those that fail treatment and become bd organ donors may reveal interesting results .
7. conclusion engrafted organs undergo significant pathophysiological challenges as they are transplanted from the donor to the recipient .
brain injury , brain death , ischaemia , and reperfusion all contribute to inflammation and injury .
as has been discussed , a vast amount of research is ongoing at each of these steps of transplant .
understanding the molecular inflammatory responses and utilising interventions that can reduce haemodynamic instability , inflammation , and iri is the key to further advancing donor management. with time and more successful interventions , it may be possible to further address the ongoing shortage of donor organs and decrease the number of patients who die whilst waiting for a transplant .

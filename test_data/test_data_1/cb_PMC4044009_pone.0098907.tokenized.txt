background taxa may respond differently to climatic changes , depending on phylogenetic or ecological effects , but studies that discern among these alternatives are scarce .
here , we use two species pairs from globally distributed spider clades , each pair representing two lifestyles ( generalist , specialist ) to test the relative importance of phylogeny versus ecology in predicted responses to climate change .
methodology we used a recent phylogenetic hypothesis for nephilid spiders to select four species from two genera ( nephilingis and nephilengys ) that match the above criteria , are fully allopatric but combined occupy all subtropical - tropical regions .
based on their records , we modeled each species niche spaces and predicted their ecological shifts 20 , 40 , 60 , and 80 years into the future using customized gis tools and projected climatic changes .
conclusions phylogeny better predicts the species current ecological preferences than do lifestyles. by 2080 all species face dramatic reductions in suitable habitat ( 54.8 - 77.1 %) and adapt by moving towards higher altitudes and latitudes , although at different tempos .
phylogeny and life style explain simulated habitat shifts in altitude , but phylogeny is the sole best predictor of latitudinal shifts .
models incorporating phylogenetic relatedness are an important additional tool to predict accurately biotic responses to global change .

introduction biotic change due to global warming is increasing dramatically .
although climatic changes are increasingly well understood and future predictions are improving , it is much more difficult to predict biotic responses to climate change [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
models predict global climates to become warmer in the following decades ( fig. s1 ) , and precipitation patterns will change accordingly , but how organisms will respond to such changes is less clear .
naturally , different life histories and even clades of organisms may respond in various ways [ 3 ] .
for example , they may respond with a shift in time , e.g. changing their phenology [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , or a shift in space , such as moving to different habitats , latitudes , or altitudes [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , insofar as habitats are available [ 8 ] .
crucial species interactions may be broken by both types of shifts [ 9 ] .
tropical species , in particular , may be severely affected [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] .
actual adaptive evolutionary change within a few decades may be possible for some organisms with extraordinary genotypic and phenotypic plasticity [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] but is unlikely for most as it would require over 10,000 times faster rates of adaptive change than those estimated [ 13 ] .
finally , the species unable to cope with anthropogenic global changes , and those whose dispersal ability is low , are likely to become extinct either globally or locally [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 14 ] .
communities , ecosystems and biomes are also likely to be forced to shift in space [ 2 ] , become increasingly destabilized due to biotic loss [ 15 ] , or be subject to thermophilization [ 16 ] and invasion [ 17 ] .
in addition , food web and trophic interactions may be altered [ 18 ] .
while biomes , notably tropical and subtropical forests , may expand in range due to increased rainfall and atmospheric co2 levels [ 19 ] , such trends are expected to be countered by human habitat degradation , probably resulting in net habitat loss [ 20 ] .
in some cases , temperate assemblages may increase in species richness or exhibit a higher species turnover [ 21 ] .
however , at the global level with all factors combined , most biomes and communities are predicted to deteriorate , and thus may simply shrink or disappear .
their space then may be taken over by exotic and invasive species and communities , whose success can sometimes be directly attributed to global change [ 17 ] .
terrestrial organisms may be most prone to global climate changes ( but see freshwater and marine reviews [ 22 ] , [ 23 ]) , yet surprisingly few studies have modeled the future of closely related terrestrial lineages - - clades - - in order to discern among phylogenetic and ecological effects while studies modelling single species continue to abound [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
as an example of clade predictions , diamond et al .
[ 26 ] examined models for thermal tolerance in ants based on current and future climates and found that tropical ants had lower tolerances to warming .
tropical ant faunas , thus , are more susceptible to global warming , and that is precisely where the most diversity lies .
however , is this necessarily true for all tropical ants ?
one would expect that phylogeny may affect biotic responses to climate change at least as much as ecology or natural history [ 27 ] .
fine grained studies discerning among these factors are currently lacking [ 3 ] .
to test the relative importance of phylogeny versus ecology in predicted biotic responses to climate change , we selected two clades within which species have occupied two distinct ecological niches .
the spider genera nephilengys and nephilingis [ 28 ] are large terrestrial invertebrate predators .
the asian nephilengys malabarensis is synanthropic and hence relatively generalized , and the australasian ny. papuana is a forest species , thus relatively specialized [ 29 ] .
likewise the african - south american nephilingis cruentata is synanthropic , whereas the madagascan - comoroan ni. livida is a forest species ( fig. 1 ) [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
the four species are fully allopatric , but combined they occupy all subtropical - tropical regions [ 29 ] .
ecologically the two specialists , ni. livida and ny. papuana should be more prone to habitat loss than the generalists ny. malabarensis and ni. cruentata .
this prediction derives from the assertions that species with greater ecological generalization should be more likely to shift to higher elevation and latitude [ 3 ] and that niche breath positively correlates with species geographic ranges [ 32 ] .
alternatively , phylogenetic relatedness may better explain response trends .
we first used predicted temperature and precipitation changes ( fig. s1 ) and a gis simulation tool to model habitat degradation , gain , and loss in the four species ( fig. 2 , fig. s2 ) at 20 year intervals from 2000 - 2080 .
we then investigated the extent to which phylogeny versus ecology explained habitat changes .
a priori predictions are difficult : if commonly derived species undergo life history adaptation to reduce competition , then ecology may be a better predictor .
if not , phylogeny may be used to predict habitat shifts due to climate change .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0098907.g001 figure 1 two nephilid species pairs , their phylogeny , and basic ecology .
one species from each clade is synanthropic and the other one a habitat specialist .
this sample tests the relative importance of phylogeny versus life history on species responses to climatic changes .
the phylogenetic hypothesis builds on a nephilid species level study that used 4kb of nucleotide data in addition to morphology , and an array of analytical approaches and sensitivity analyses [ 28 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0098907.g002 figure 2 predicted habitat suitability changes of two nephilingis and two nephilengys species over increasing time ranges .
the predictions are based on the ipcc scenario a1b for temperature and precipitation ( see figs s1 - s2 ) and are modeled for the time ranges 2000 vs. 2020 , 2040 , 2060 , and 2080 .
future habitat is classified as new , unchanged , degraded or lost .
materials and methods modeling current habitat suitability we used all available locality data for the four species [ 29 ] : ni. cruentata ( specimen records n = 436 ) , ni. livida ( n = 138 ) , ny. malabarensis ( n = 138 ) and ny. papuana ( n = 39 ) .
since our previous study phylogenetic evidence has emerged placing ni. cruentata and ni. livida in the genus nephilingis , which is phylogenetically distant from nephilengys containing n. malabarensis and ny. papuana [ 28 ] .
this is currently the best available phylogenetic hypothesis of nephilid species relationships , having utilized 4 kb of nucleotide data in addition to morphology , and an array of analytical approaches and sensitivity analyses [ 28 ]. that the previously congeneric species in fact belong to distinct clades , which nevertheless contain ecologically dissimilar species ( one synanthropic and one habitat specialist within each genus ) , adds power to our testing of phylogenetic versus life history effects on habitat suitability .
our previous model selected best fit pairs of ecological parameters for each species current habitat suitability assessment based on the outcomes of backward linear regression : annual mean temperature and elevation was used for the ni. cruentata model , global land cover and elevation for the ni. livida model , and global land cover and annual mean precipitation for both ny. malabarensis and ny. papuana models [ 29 ] .
here , we used the same pairs of parameters for all four species models , which are indicative of global climate change : annual mean temperature ( tma ) and annual mean precipitation ( pma ) .
based on these two parameters , we modeled the starting point for the year 2000 , taken as each species' current habitat suitability .
modeling future habitat suitability we downloaded the raster data for tma and pma for the years 2020 to 2080 from the downscaled global circulation models data portal ( http :// www.ccafs - climate.org ) , and the current distribution ( 1950 - 2000 ) of climates from the worldclim database [ 33 ] .
the raster layers are based on the ipcc special report on emissions scenarios ( sres ) [ 34 ] , where several scenario families of predicted climate change were proposed .
the scenario a1 builds on the assumption of maximum energy requirements , and the sub - choices are based on emissions expected from the use of different fuel sources : fossil intensive ( a1f1 ) , technologically developed non - fossil sources ( a1t ) and a balance across sources ( a1b ) .
among the worst case scenario ( a1 ) we chose the balanced use of fuel sources ( a1b ) as the basis for our models .
the remaining three scenarios build on minimum energy requirements and emissions ( b1 ) , on high energy requirements ( a1f1 ) and on lower energy requirements ; however , as the scenarios a2 and b2 only predict a limited number of years ( 2020 , 2050 and 2080 ) , and the a1 scenario predicts each decade , our choice of scenario ( a1b ) seemed justified .
for global modeling use , ipcc recommends the use of a1 and b1 [ 35 ] , among which we chose to model a more pessimistic version due to the availability of predicted climate change ( for b1 no associated datasets exist ) .
the a1b scenario uses 24 global circulation models [ 36 ] .
all rasters have a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc - minutes , using a wgs84 datum .
the a1 group of scenarios predicts a global average surface warming until 2100 from 1.4 to 6.4degreesc [ 35 ]. fig. s1 shows projected global changes in tma and pma for the period covered by our models ( current = 2000 ; projected 2020 , 2040 , 2060 , 2080 ) .
based on these , we modeled habitat suitability of each of the four species following our gis modeling methodology [ 29 ] .
these maps define each species' directional distribution as its potential target area and thus potential dispersal range [ 29 ] , and within it , we used the frequency distribution values for tma and pma for current specimen records [ 29 ] .
we here explore the changes for each species in three habitat categories : high , moderate and low habitat suitability ( fig. s2 ) .
several data sources exist that model global changes according to the a1b scenario .
we choose the data from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis - cgcm3.1 ( t47 ) , 2005 [ 37 ] .
this data model version is the basis for the suite of model simulations in the ipcc fourth assessment report [ 35 ] .
t47 version of cgcm3.1 data model has a surface grid whose spatial resolution is roughly 3.75 degrees latitude / longitude and 31 levels vertically , and an ocean grid resolution of roughly 1.85 degrees , with 29 levels vertically [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
assessing species habitat loss to assess the degrees of projected habitat losses or gains due to climatic changes , we compared the differences in predicted habitat suitability categories for the following time periods : 2000 - 2020 , 2000 - 2040 , 2000 - 2060 , and 2000 - 2080 .
we customized our previous gis model [ 29 ] with additional tools in arcgis [ 40 ] : i ) first , we reclassified each year 's habitat suitability raster data where no habitat suitability was shown from ' nodata ' to ' 99 ' using the tool ' reclassify ' ; those values that showed a habitat suitability value were left as they were ( high = 3 ; moderate = 2 ; low = 1 ) ; ii ) we then compared using the ' combine ' tool the habitat category changes between the year 2000 and other time periods and reclassified the resulting combinations into the following nominal values : 1 = new habitat ( indicating projected habitat suitability gain ) ; 2 = unchanged habitat ( indicating no change in habitat suitability ) ; 3 = degraded habitat ( indicating a loss in habitat suitability value , but not below 1 ) and 4 = lost habitat ( indicating a complete loss of projected habitat suitability , i.e. resulting in a change to 99 ) .
statistical analyses since the tma and pma data were not normally distributed , we employed standard non - parametric statistics to test the effects of phylogenetic relatedness ( nephilingis vs. nephilengys ) and life history ( synanthropic vs. habitat specialist ) on current species ecological preferences .
to determine whether phylogenetic or ecological factors are good predictors of the simulated habitat shifts , we first devised a randomized dataset of 10,000 simulated georeferenced records per period per species ( totaling 200,000 records ; table s1 ) , calculated latitudinal and altitudinal shifts and coded them as categorical data ( i.e. , shift or not ) based on the shifted values .
we performed generalized linear model ( glm ) using ordinal logistical model twice , once for latitudinal shifts and once for altitudinal shifts , with phylogeny , life style , period ( 2020 , 2040 , 2060 and 2080 ) and habitat suitability ( high = 3 ; moderate = 2 ; low = 1 ) as predictors .
both period and habitat suitability showed the same effects on shifts in the initial glm tests , thus being excluded from the final models , which tested the effects of only two factors ( phylogeny and life style ) and the 2 - way interaction on the categorical latitude and altitude shifts .
the model was fitted using multinominal distribution with cumulative logit link error .
akaike information criterion ( aic : the smallest is the best ) was used to select the best model .
all statistical analyses were done using ibm spss statistics 21 ( ibm corporation , usa ) .
reported p - values are two - tailed tests , with alpha = 0.05 .
results the global habitat suitability models for 2000 , 2020 , 2040 , 2060 and 2080 predict overall shrinking or disappearance of suitable habitat for all four species ( fig. s2 ) , although minor amounts of newly appropriate habitat emerge over time .
categorizing habitat change as unchanged , degraded , lost , or new , the major trend across all time ranges is dramatic increase in either lost or degraded habitat for all species ( fig. 2 ; table 1 ) .
losses and gains can take different tempos. ni. cruentata shows a dramatic loss by 2080 , but in ny. papuana the most dramatic loss occurs by 2040 .
others are intermediate .
in no case does new habitat tend to increase ( table 1 ). by 2080 , habitat loss ranges from 54.8 % ( ni. livida ) to 77.1 % ( ny. papuana ) .
even the widespread , generalist species ni. cruentata and ny. malabarensis lose 60.6 % and 58.6 % of their habitat .
according to the model , all four species roughly maintain their known temperature and precipitation preferences ( fig. 3 ) .
however in order to do so , all species shift towards higher altitudes and latitudes ( except ni. livida , whose island habitats are obviously fixed ) ( fig. 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0098907.g003 figure 3 changes for all species in altitude and latitude ( above ) , and temperature and precipitation ( below ) .
species maintain their characteristic climatic conditions by shifting towards higher altitudes and latitudes .
geographical and ecological averages for the modeled suitable habitats combined all categories ( low , medium and high suitability ) .
ni = nephilingis , ng = nephilengys , pma = mean annual precipitation , tma = mean annual temperature .

both phylogeny and lifestyle significantly explain current precipitation preferences , but phylogeny much more strongly than lifestyle ( mann - whitney u = 25,803 , df = 1 , p < 0.0001 and u = 13,503 , df = 1 , p < 0.016 ) .
glm analyses on simulated data show that phylogeny predicts latitudinal shifts better than life style does ( goodness of fit : aic = 116.261 ; omnibus test : chi 2 = 328.2 , df = 3 , p < 0.0001 ; table 2 ) : nephilengys is more likely to shift latitude than nephilingis .
both phylogeny and life style are good predictors of the simulated altitudinal shifts ( goodness of fit : aic = 107.247 ; omnibus test : chi 2 = 48.242 , df = 3 , p < 0.0001 ; table 2 ) : altitudinal shifts are more likely in nephilingis than nephilengys and in synanthropic species than in habitat specialists .

discussion models that forecast biodiversity patterns have been grouped into four categories [ 41 ] : 1 ) those considering individual species , 2 ) those grouping species by niche , 3 ) those based on general circulation or coupled ocean - atmosphere - biosphere theories , and 4 ) those based on species - area curves [ 41 ] .
we argue that models using phylogenetic relatedness should also be considered because our results have shown that phylogeny can strongly predict climatic and habitat preference .
studies considering individual species fail to account for species interactions and phylogenetic factors and are therefore of limited general use .
in one case , the already limited range of the golden striped salamander decreased even more [ 42 ] ; in another an invasive species , the australian redback spider , increased its already substantial distribution [ 43 ] .
outside of a phylogenetic context , these patterns make no general predictions for evolutionarily or ecologically closely related organisms .
more taxonomically inclusive studies often predict changes in large clades of organisms , notably amphibians [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] or ants [ 26 ] , but again , fine - grained clade - based studies are too preliminary .
for example , the ranges of european amphibians and reptiles are generally predicted to shrink by 2050 [ 44 ] , but this study was based on two opposite , and equally unlikely assumptions of unlimited versus no dispersal .
a study of plant , bird and mammal assemblages in europe only found a weak relationship between phylogeny and climate change vulnerability [ 46 ] .
however , willis et al .
[ 47 ] investigated the changes in phenology and abundance of a temperate flora over 150 years and found that different clades are quite differently affected by climate change .
niche modelling is limited as it fails to account for differences in species natural histories [ 3 ] .
only recently have studies taken into account species trait variability in assessing predicted responses to climate change .
angert et al .
[ 3 ] examined to what extent species' traits are predictive of expanding their ranges .
predicting ecologically general species with greater dispersal abilities to more easily shift to higher latitudes and altitudes in response to climatic changes , they did find the expected relationships in passeriform birds and odonates , but their models yielded low explanatory power .
our study extended this logic on a phylogenetically fine - grained taxonomic sample , by testing the relative importance of phylogeny versus species traits in predicted biotic responses to climate change in two species pairs from globally distributed spider clades , each pair representing two lifestyles .
despite the prediction that the unrelated specialists ( forest - dwelling species ) would cope with projected global changes worse than the unrelated generalists ( synanthropic species ) , our results project habitat shrinkage patterns that may better be predicted by phylogeny than life style .
our modeling approach assumes genotypic and phenotypic species homogeneity , perhaps an unwarranted assumption considering wide geographical ranges these species occupy .
in reality , even widespread generalists show considerable genetic and phenotypic adaptations , spiders being no exception [ 48 ] .
the predicted habitat shifts therefore may not be equally likely throughout the entire range of these taxa , and it may be possible that levels of adaptive change could take place at short temporal scales such as these presented in our study .
the modes of habitat loss and extinction may depend on many additional factors , such as geography or basic natural history that are too complex to model accurately [ 3 ] .
phylogeny - - which does broadly predict many life history traits - - can simplify the prediction of biotic responses to future climate change .
for accurate modelling , of course , many other factors are important as well , such as species interactions [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , persistence abilities [ 51 ] , population dynamics and changes in genetic diversity [ 52 ] .
however , more work assessing phylogeny versus ecology and life history as explanations for responses to climate change is needed .

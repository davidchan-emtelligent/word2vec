this paper reports the draft genome sequence of the firmicute geobacillus sp. strain zgt - 1 , an antibacterial peptide producer isolated from the zara hot spring in jordan .
this study is the first report on genomic data from a thermophilic bacterial strain isolated in jordan .
cover - datejuly / august 2015 genome announcement lately , the species of the genus geobacillus have been gaining interest as antimicrobial peptide producers ( 1 , 2 ) .
geobacillus sp. strain zgt - 1 , isolated from the zara hot spring in jordan , has been shown to produce an as - yet - uncharacterized antimicrobial peptide ( 3 ) .
in order to screen for the antibacterial protein - encoding genes and to identify potential novel genes associated with antibacterial peptide biosynthesis , we performed a whole - genome sequencing of the bacterium that was already identified by sequencing the pcr - amplified 16s rrna gene ( genbank accession no. kt026965 ) .
here , we report the genome sequence of geobacillus sp. strain zgt - 1 .
total genomic dna was extracted from pure cultures of the isolate using zr fungal / bacterial dna miniprep ( zymo research ) .
a dna library was constructed using the nextera protocol with modifications as described earlier ( 4 ) .
input to the assembly consisted of 680,000 single - end illumina reads with a length of 151 nucleotides .
quality control was performed by the fastqc version 0.11.2 software ( http :// www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk / projects / fastqc ) .
reads were assembled using velveth and velvetg , both with version 1.2.10 ( 5 ) .
this resulted in an assembly containing 9,625 contigs with a total length of 3.7 million bp. taking into account that genome sequences from closely related strains were available , it was decided to produce zgt - 1 scaffolds based on the genome sequence of geobacillus kaustophilus hta426 ( genbank accession number nc _ 006510.1 ) .
this was conducted online with the scaffold _ builder tool ( 6 ) using default settings .
this resulted in a new assembly with 241 scaffolds and a total length 3,483,107 bp. on this final assembly , gene prediction was carried out with prodigal version 2 _ 60 using default settings ( 7 ) .
the predicted number of protein - encoding genes was 3,546 , which is close to the reported number of genes from g. kaustophilus hta426 ( 3,397 protein - encoding genes ) .
the gc content was calculated to 52.2 % and gene density to 88 % .
genome analysis using antismash version 3.0 software ( 8 ) revealed that strain zgt - 1 harbors a lantipeptide biosynthetic gene cluster , where one of the genes encodes for a lantipeptide similar to geobacillin i. the presence of this cluster was also confirmed using bagel version 3.0 software ( 9 ) .
the antismash also revealed that the strain harbors another cluster containing a gene encoding for a bacteriocin similar to linocin m18 .
a number of putative genes found in the lantipeptide and bacteriocin clusters showed low percentage identity with already described genes .
this indicates that the zgt - 1 strain possibly possesses novel genes related to antibacterial peptide production .
combining the in silico analysis of the draft genome of strain zgt - 1 with in vitro experimentation is likely to lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
this whole - genome shotgun project has been deposited in ddbj / embl / genbank under the accession number ldpd00000000 .
the version described in this paper is the first version , ldpd01000000 .

a prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital from august 2008 to august 2009 to explore the independent predictors of adverse outcome in the patients with confirmed / probable viral encephalitis .
the primary outcome variable was the incidence of adverse outcomes defined as death or severe neurological deficit such as loss of speech , motor deficits , behavioural problems , blindness , and cognitive impairment .
patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis were classified into two groups based on their z - score of weight - for - age as per who growth charts .
group i. patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis with weight - for - age ( w / a ) z - scores below - 2sd were classified as undernourished .
group ii. patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis were classified as having normal nutritional status ( weight - for - age z - score > - 2sd ) .
a total of 114 patients were classified as confirmed or probable viral encephalitis based on detailed investigations .
on multivariate logistic regression , undernutrition ( adjusted or : 5.05 ; 95 % ci : 1.92 to 13.44 ) and requirement of ventilation ( adjusted or : 6.75 ; 95 % ci : 3.63 to 77.34 ) were independent predictors of adverse outcomes in these patients .
thus , the results from our study highlight that the association between undernutrition and adverse outcome could be extended to the patients with confirmed / probable viral encephalitis .
1. introduction a wide range of viruses are implicated as a cause of acute viral encephalitis either in sporadic or in outbreak forms .
enteroviruses , flaviviruses , and herpes simplex , chandipura , and west nile viruses are some of the common causes of viral encephalitis [ 1 - 3 ] .
eastern uttar pradesh region of india is facing regular outbreaks of the encephalitis since 1978 .
children below the age of 14 years were the most vulnerable population and despite mass je vaccination following this epidemic , the death toll continued to rise .
a change in the clinical pattern of encephalitis was observed in this region with je positivity of about 5 - 17 % [ 4 ] .
isolates from 306 patients with acute encephalitis during an outbreak of viral encephalitis in northern india identified enterovirus in about 21.6 percent of cases .
further sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of pcr products from 89.3 % specimens showed similarity with ev - 89 and ev - 76 sequences [ 5 ] .
a potential biochemical mechanism that could adversely affect seizure threshold ( in patients with epilepsy ) , particularly the effect of malnutrition on inhibitory neurotransmitter and electrolyte , has been worked out where supportive evidence from animal research and epidemiological findings in children has been discussed [ 6 ] .
a lot of research has been done in the past showing the interrelationship between poor nutritional status , infection , and immunity but no such work has been published regarding viral encephalitis or other infectious diseases .
a recent study from india by bhargava et al .
[ 7 ] has shown a high prevalence ( more than 85 %) of undernutrition in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis at diagnosis and an increased risk of death among patients with undernutrition .
however , there are no global data regarding the effect of undernutrition on the outcome of patients with viral encephalitis .
therefore , we conducted this study to find out an association between the status of nutrition of encephalitis patients and the clinical outcomes of the disease .
2. methods 2.1 .
design and study population this prospective observational study was performed in a tertiary care centre of north india from august 2008 to august 2009 .
the study protocol was approved by institutional ethics committee .
after obtaining written consent from parents , all consecutive patients , aged 2 months to 10 years , admitted to a tertiary care teaching hospital with aes [ 8 ] characterized by pleocytosis , an absence of bacteria upon culture of csf , and some or all of the following features , fever , sensorium changes ( such as confusion , disorientation , drowsiness , stupor , coma , convulsions , and abnormal behavior ) , ataxia , limb paralysis , hemiplegia , and specific cranial nerve dysfunction plus confirmed or probable viral etiology , were enrolled for the study .
a detailed examination was done in a precoded performa and various samples were sent for microbiological investigations .
for confirmation of viral etiological csf , serum , throat swab , and stool samples were tested .
csf was also subjected to nested rtpcr or real - time pcr for detecting presence of enterovirus or jev genome .
all the samples were stored at - 20degreesc before sending them to the national institute of virology ( niv ) .
based on these investigations patients were divided into the following .
patients with confirmed viral etiological agents .
those patients with positive csf pcr for jev or enteroviruses and / or igm antibodies against jev in csf were grouped as confirmed viral encephalitis .
probable viral etiological agents .
those patients with presence of enterovirus in stool or throat samples and absence of other viruses in csf were classified as probable viral etiological agents .
based on csf examination , bacterial culture , and other examinations , patients with bacterial meningitis , tuberculous meningitis , cerebral malaria , and typhoid fever were excluded .
causes of the consciousness level caused by factors other than infections ( such as hypoglycaemia , haemorrhage , infarction , and other metabolic causes ) were excluded from the study .
patients with suspected viral encephalitis in which no etiological agent could be identified were also excluded from the study .
further , patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis were classified into two groups based on their z - score of weight - for - age as per world health organization ( who ) charts [ 9 ] .
group i. patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis with weight - for - age ( w / a ) z - scores below - 2sd were classified as ill - nourished [ 9 ] .
group ii. patients with confirmed or probable viral encephalitis with normal nutritional status ( weight - for - age z - score > - 2sd ) were classified as normally nourished .
2.2 .
outcome variables the primary outcome variable was the incidence of adverse outcomes defined as death or severe neurological deficit such as loss of speech , motor deficits , behavioural problems , blindness , and cognitive impairment .
we also evaluated other sociodemographic and clinical factors for association with adverse outcome the factors which were evaluated in our study were prehospital factors such as rural or urban background , socioeconomic status , time interval between onset of symptoms and hospital arrival time , and total duration of hospital stay .
factors at admission which were evaluated include demographic characteristics of the population such as age , sex , gender , presence of undernutrition , clinical features , and investigations .
all the patients were followed up until death or discharge , whichever came first .
all the baseline characteristics were collected at the time of admission .
for determining risk factors we compared the predefined factors of the children who died or had severe neurological deficit during hospital stay .
patients in both groups received treatment as per the standard protocol for encephalitis while patients in undernutrition group received recommended treatment for undernutrition [ 8 ] .
2.3 .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was done by using spss - 21 software .
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were described using counts and proportions for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for numerical variables .
chi - square test was used to test difference among malnourished and normal groups .
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test association of various factors with outcome , namely , favourable versus adverse .
then statistically significant factors ( table 1 ) and certain known predictors like pallor , place residence , and hospitalization interval were also included in multivariate logistic regression model [ 4 ] .
stepwise forward conditional model was used for identifying independent predictors .
hosmer - lemeshow goodness of fit test was used for testing fit of model .
3. results a total of 1286 patients were screened during this period and 114 patients were classified as confirmed or probable viral encephalitis based on detailed investigations .
out of these 80 patients were grouped as undernutrition ( group i ) and 34 patients were classified as normally nourished ( group ii ) .
the mean age of presentation was 5.26 +/ - 2.5 years ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) in group 1 and 5 +/ - 2 years in group ii. at the time of admission the statistically significant difference between two groups was found for variables , namely , swelling all over the body , pallor , edema , signs of dehydration , tachycardia , and raised blood urea present in undernutrition group ( table 1 ) .
a total of 54 patients were classified as confirmed je , 32 patients as confirmed enteroviruses , and 28 patients as probable enterovirus encephalitis .
3.1 .
complications and outcome a total of 24 patients expired during hospital stay , 21 in group i and 3 in group ii. the most common complications present in these patients were aspiration pneumonia ( 12 ) , gastrointestinal bleeding ( 11 ) , congestive heart failure ( 8 ) , peripheral vascular failure ( 8 ) , and cerebral herniation ( 6 ) .
a total of 37 patients required ventilation , the most common indications being respiratory failure followed by shock and low glasgow coma scale .
the mean duration of ventilation was 34 ( 29 ) hours in both groups .
severe neurological deficit was present in 49 patients ( 41 in group i and 08 in group ii ) .
thus incidence of adverse outcome in undernourished group was 62 / 80 ( 77.5 % ; 95 % ci : 67.2 to 87.8 ) which was higher than that in normally nourished group [ 11 / 34 ( 32.4 % ; 95 % ci : 19.1 to 49.2 )] .
3.2 .
risk factor for poor outcome on univariate analysis for association of various factors with outcome categories , presence of malnutrition , edema , signs of meningeal irritation , gastrointestinal bleed , respiratory distress , and need for ventilator support were statistically significantly associated with adverse outcome ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
on multivariate analysis by forward conditional method , only presence of undernutrition ( adjusted or : 5.05 ; 95 % ci : 1.92 to 13.44 ) and requirement of ventilation within 48 hours ( adjusted or : 6.75 ; 95 % ci : 3.63 to 77.34 ) were independently associated with adverse outcomes .
hosmer - lemeshow goodness of fit test was nonsignificant ( p = 0.956 ) indicating fit of model , omnibus test of model coefficients on step 2 was significant ( p = 0.001 ) , and nagelkerke r square was 0.408 .
4. discussion our study found that undernutrition and requirement of ventilator support within 48 hours of admission are independent predictors of adverse outcome .
to the best of our knowledge , the association between undernutrition and poor outcomes in patients with viral encephalitis has not been previously reported .
a study on long term outcomes of japanese encephalitis ( je ) virus in central sarawak , malaysia , has shown poor perfusion , glasgow coma scale <= 8 , and more than two witnessed seizures as predictors of poor outcome at hospital discharge [ 10 ] .
other studies have shown younger age , higher body temperature , high white cell count in cerebrospinal fluid , and deep coma at hospital admission , altered sensorium , and focal neurologic deficit as predictor of poor outcomes in patients with je [ 11 , 12 ] .
previous studies have shown age , lower glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) at admission , pallor , peripheral vascular failure , cerebral edema , status epileptics , thrombocytopenia , and requirement of ventilator support as independent predictors of mortality in the patients with viral encephalitis [ 4 , 13 , 14 ] .
in a recent retrospective review of the patients with central nervous system infections which included patients with tuberculous meningitis , viral encephalitis , pyogenic meningitis , and fungal meningitis admitted to neurological critical care unit of a tertiary care centre , duration of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation were found to be independent predictors of mortality [ 15 ] .
about 70 % of the patients in our study had undernutrition ( weight - for - age z - score < - 2sd ) .
the prevalence of malnutrition in india is 43 % [ 16 ] and uttar pradesh region is one of the worst regions affected with about 40 % of its children being underweight and 56.8 % stunted [ 17 ] .
nutritional status can be improved in the community by a number of interventions such as initiation of early breastfeeding and complementary feeding through nutrition counseling with some additional measures necessary in food insecure settings [ 18 , 19 ] .
the excess morbidity and mortality associated with undernutrition owed to the impairment of host defense mechanisms , which predisposes them to infectious diseases [ 20 ] .
thus , our study suggests that this association between undernutrition and adverse outcomes extends to the patients with viral encephalitis ( je and enteroviruses ) .
requirement of ventilation within 48 hours of admission was found to be strongly associated with adverse outcome in our study .
these findings are consistent with previous reports of critically ill patients with all cause encephalitis [ 13 ] .
this finding indicates that physicians must assess the need for mechanical ventilation early with ongoing evaluation of the need for respiratory support [ 15 ] .
our study has certain limitations .
as our primary objective was to explore risk factors associated with poor outcomes , considering feasibility of data collection in limited time period , we have accrued consecutive samples and no formal sample size calculations were done .
as japanese encephalitis and enteroviruses are the two most common etiological agents responsible for major outbreak of viral encephalitis in this region , risk factors for poor outcomes of patients suffering from these two organisms were included .
moreover , the evaluation of patients for chronic malnutrition and micronutrient status could not be done .
the strengths of our study are as follows : being the first study to show the association of undernutrition and poor outcomes in the patients with viral encephalitis ; sampling of all consecutive patients coming to our institute which is only tertiary centre catering these patients , thus making selection bias less likely ; inclusion of confirmed or probable viral encephalitis patients making results more disease specific .
this study has some important implications : undernutrition was highly prevalent in the patients with viral encephalitis and was associated with poor outcomes in these patients .
it is an established fact that the economic condition of the family has a huge impact on the nutritional status of the children [ 18 ] .
malnutrition commonly affects all groups in a community , but infants and young children are most vulnerable because of their high nutritional requirements for growth and development .
a comprehensive programme approach to improving complementary feeding practices including timely introduction of age - appropriate and hygienically prepared complementary foods , counseling for caregivers on feeding and care practices , optimal use of locally available foods , improving access to quality foods for poor families through social protection schemes and safety nets , and the provision of fortified foods and micronutrient [ 18 , 19 ] is the need of the hour .
proper supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in cases of enterovirus or japanese encephalitis as no specific treatment is presently available [ 21 - 24 ] .
further studies are required on long term follow - up and effect of nutritional intervention on the outcomes of the patients with viral encephalitis .
5. conclusion our study found that undernutrition and requirement of ventilator support within 48 hours of admission are independent predictors of adverse outcome .
thus , the results from our study highlight that the association between undernutrition and adverse outcome could be extended to the patients with confirmed / probable viral encephalitis .
moreover , the results from the present study will be helpful for future design of treatment and preventive strategies of the disease .

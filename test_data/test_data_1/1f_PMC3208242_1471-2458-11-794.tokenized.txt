background prehypertension and prediabetes are major risk factors of cardiovascular disease , and their combined presence may result in more serious cardiovascular outcomes than expected with either prehypertension or prediabetes alone .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of coexisting prehypertension and prediabetes , and the associated risk profiles in a chinese population .
methods a cross - sectional survey in a representative sample of 3,595 men and 4,593 women aged 18 years and older was performed between 2008 and 2010 .
prehypertension and prediabetes were diagnosed using the guidelines from the seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention , detection , and treatment of high blood pressure and american diabetes association , respectively .
prehypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 - 139 mmhg and / or diastolic blood pressure of 80 - 89 mmhg , and prediabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose of 5.6 - 6.9 mmol / l. results the prevalence of coexisting prehypertension and prediabetes was 11.0 % .
men had a higher prevalence of coexisting prehypertension and prediabetes than women ( 14.2 % vs. 8.4 % ; p < 0.0001 ) .
this prevalence increased with age and body mass index , and was the lowest among mongolian - chinese ( 5.1 %) .
a multivariate analysis showed that gamma - glutamyltransferase and uric acid were significantly and positively correlated with body mass index , waist circumference , blood pressure , triglycerides , and total cholesterol , and negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol in subjects with prehypertension and prediabetes .
conclusions there is a large proportion of chinese adults with coexisting prehypertension and prediabetes .
thus , there is a need for more efforts that implement public health programs that target the earlier stages of hypertension and diabetes .
background cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is considered to be a major cause of death in most developed and developing countries [ 1 ] .
hypertension is a major risk factor of cvd .
even a slightly elevated blood pressure within the normal range is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 2 ] .
therefore , in 2003 , the seventh report of the joint national committee on the prevention , detection , evaluation , and treatment of high blood pressure ( jnc - 7 ) introduced a new category : prehypertension ( prehtn ) , where systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) is from 120 to 139 mmhg , and / or diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) is from 80 to 89 mmhg [ 3 ] .
individuals with prehtn are more susceptible to developing true hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis [ 4 ] .
several national blood pressure surveys in the united states and other countries report that more than 30 % of the general adult population has prehtn [ 5,6 ] .
prediabetes ( predm ) is another important risk factor of cvd , which is associated with impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) and / or glucose tolerance ( igt ) .
according to the american diabetes association , predm is indicated by ifg , where serum glucose concentrations range from 5.6 mmol / l ( 100 mg / dl ) to 6.9 mmol / l ( 125 mg / dl ) , as well as igt , where serum glucose concentrations range from 7.8 mmol / l ( 140 mg / dl ) to 11.1 mmol / l ( 199 mg / dl ) 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose load [ 7 ] .
ifg is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of cardiovascular pathology .
although less risky than igt , ifg is coupled with a greater conversion from predm to overt diabetes ( i.e. approximately 24 % in less than three years ) [ 8 ] .
recently published data on a large population - based sample of more than 45,000 people , aged 20 years and older , in china indicated that the prevalence of predm was 15.5 % [ 9 ] .
given that the effects of certain clinical precursors , such as prehtn and predm , on the cardiovascular system are often distinct , their combined presence in the same patient may result in more severe coronary artery disease than expected with either prehtn or predm alone [ 10 ] .
the probable cvd risk with prehtn and predm , to some extent , is dependent on whether prehtn leads to hypertension and predm leads to diabetes .
additionally , racial and ethnic differences are known to influence the prevalence and risks of prehtn and predm [ 11,12 ] .
several large surveys have yielded prevalence estimates for either prehtn or predm in china [ 9,13 ] .
nevertheless , there is little information available in the literature regarding the prevalence of coexisting prehtn and predm ( co - prehtn and predm ) among individuals located in areas inhabited by chinese ethnic minorities .
furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no population - based , cross - sectional studies that have assessed the epidemiology of co - prehtn and predm among healthy chinese adults .
thus , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm , along with their associated risks , in populations located in northern and northeastern china .
methods study population a population - based , cross - sectional survey of the chinese physiological constant and health condition ( cpchc ) was conducted between 2008 and 2010 .
representative samples of the general chinese population , aged 18 years and older , from the hei longjiang province and inner mongolian autonomous region in mainland china were determined according to a random , multistage cluster sampling scheme , allowing for good prevalence estimates of the chinese population .
two urban and two rural areas were selected from each province .
written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to data collection .
the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the institute of basic medical sciences , chinese academy of medical sciences .
trained medical personnel collected information on risk factors via questionnaires ( e.g. demographic , socioeconomic , and health - related information ) , and obtaining anthropometric measurements and blood samples for biochemical assessments .
inclusions and exclusions the 2008 - 2010 cpchc samples included 29,639 apparently healthy participants .
those who suffered from systemic disease involving diabetes mellitus , hypertension or other cardiovascular , renal , gastro - intestinal , pulmonary disease or cancer were excluded .
moreover , participants taking any medication known to affect carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were also excluded .
a schematic of the screening process is presented in figure 1. of the total number of participants , 44.3 % ( n = 13,140 ) were selected randomly to complete blood testing. of 8,475 adults , aged >= 18 years , 287 ( 3.4 %) had missing data on blood pressure ( bp ) and / or laboratory tests .
therefore , the final sample size of disease - free healthy adults was 8,188 ( 3,595 men and 4,593 women ) , of which 5,788 were han chinese , 936 were korean - chinese , 1,237 were mongolian - chinese , and 227 were of other ethnicity .
their age distribution was as follows : 3,214 were aged 18 - 39 years , 1,762 were aged 40 - 49 years , 1,580 were aged 50 - 59 years , and 1,632 were aged > 60 years .
figure 1 a schematic used for screening and inclusion of the study sample .
a total of 29,639 disease - free and healthy individuals were recruited between 2008 and 2010 , and 13,140 individuals had biochemistry measurements collected. of the 8,475 adults aged >= 18 years , 287 participants had missing data on bp and / or laboratory tests , and as result were excluded .
the final sample size was 8,188 , which consisted of 2,340 individuals with both normotension and normoglycemia , 897 individuals with coexisting prehypertension and prediabetes , and 160 individuals with both hypertension and diabetes .
abbreviations : bp , blood pressure ; fbg , fasting blood glucose ; prehtn , prehypertension ; predm , prediabetes ; htn , hypertension ; dm , diabetes mellitus .
data collection and anthropometry epidemiological data were collected on all subjects via a standard questionnaire , which included demographic characteristics ( i.e. age , gender , and ethnicity ) , socioeconomic data ( i.e. educational level , marital status , and occupation ) , past history , and lifestyle risk factors .
smoking status was classified as non - smokers , current smokers ( i.e. daily smoking regardless of the amount and type ) , and ex - smokers .
alcohol drinking status was defined as non - drinkers , current drinkers ( frequent consumption of alcohol regardless of the amount and type ) , and ex - drinkers .
body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a calibrated beam scale and height was measured barefoot in triplicate using a wall - mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. body mass index ( bmi ; an index of overall obesity ) was calculated as body weight ( in kilograms ) divided by height ( in meters squared ) .
bmi was categorized according to the world health organization criteria , where a bmi of < 25 kg / m2 is considered normal , a bmi between 25 and 29 kg / m2 is considered overweight , and a bmi >= 30 kg / m2 is considered obese [ 14 ] .
waist circumference ( wc ; a surrogate marker for central adiposity ) was measured midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest at the end of a gentle expiration .
bp was measured following a resting period of at least 10 min using an electronic sphygmomanometer ( omron , hem - 7000 ) .
the participant 's arm was placed at the level of the heart , and bp was measured three times .
the averages of the three measurements were used .
if a subject was hypertensive , then a review was performed by doctors to exclude secondary hypertension .
laboratory measurements all procedures were performed following a 12 - h overnight fast .
blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of the right arm .
serum gamma - glutamyltransferase ( ggt ; a sensitive marker of alcohol intake and hepatic inflammation ) and uric acid ( ua ; a marker of inflammation and metabolic syndrome ) , both of which play important roles in the development of cardiovascular events , were assayed with an olympus au2700 automatic biochemical analyzer and olympus agent ( olympus , tokyo , japan ) .
fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles , including total cholesterol ( tc ) , triglycerides ( tg ) , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) were also assessed .
the biochemical laboratories participating in the survey followed the same internal quality control program that was standardized by the peking union medical college hospital .
diagnosis and classification of diabetes and hypertension diagnosis of prehtn was based on the criteria in the jnc - 7 report [ 3 ] .
specifically , prehtn was defined as a sbp of 120 - 139 mmhg and / or a dbp of 80 - 89 mmhg , whereas normotension was defined as a sbp < 120 mmhg and a dbp < 80 mmhg , and hypertension was defined as a sbp >= 140 mmhg and / or a dbp >= 90 mmhg .
diagnosis of predm was based on the criteria of the american diabetes association [ 7 ] .
pre - dm was defined as fasting blood glucose ( fbg ) levels from 100 mg / dl ( 5.6 mmol / l ) to 125 mg / dl ( 6.9 mmol / l )] , which indicated ifg , and / or 2 - h postprandial blood glucose ( pbg ) levels from 140 mg / dl ( 7.8 mmol / l ) to 199 mg / dl ( 11.1 mmol / l ) following a 75 g oral glucose load , which indicated igt .
individuals with fbg < 5.6 mmol / l were considered normal , whereas individuals with fbg >= 7.0 or 2 - h pbg >= 11.1 were diagnosed with diabetes .
fasting was defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h. statistical analysis data were entered and documented on epidata 3.1 software ( the epidata association , odense , denmark ) .
datasets were transferred into an spss compatible format .
data are presented as counts and percentages +/ - standard errors ( se ) for categorical variables , and means +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) for continuous variables with a normal distribution .
comparisons between groups were made using an analysis of covariance .
medians and interquartile ranges of ggt and tg were calculated due to their abnormal distributions , and comparisons between these groups were made using the wilcoxon rank sum test .
prevalence (%) indicates the percentage of healthy chinese men and women with a condition at the time of data collection , and means indicate the average value of a characteristic in healthy chinese adults .
correlation analyses were performed using either the pearson or spearman correlations .
statistical analyses were performed on the statistical software , spss version 13.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , illinois , usa ) .
all tests for statistical significance were two - tailed , and considered significant when p < 0.05 .
results epidemiology of the 8,188 disease - free adults , 897 ( 11.0 +/ - 0.3 %) had co - prehtn and predm , 160 ( 2.0 +/ - 0.2 %) had concurrent hypertension and diabetes mellitus , 2,340 ( 28.6 +/ - 0.5 %) had both normotension and normoglycemia , and the remaining 4,791 had other combinations of resting bp and fasting serum glucose concentrations as shown in table 1 .

the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm was higher in the hei longjiang province compared to the inner mongolian autonomous region ( 13.3 % vs. 8.8 % , p < 0.0001 ) , as shown in table 2 .
men had a higher prevalence of co - prehtn and predm than women ( 14.2 % vs. 8.4 % , p < 0.0001 ) .
the prevalence increased with age ( i.e. 6.6 % for those 18 - 39 years old , 11.6 % for those 40 - 49 years old , 14.0 % for those 50 - 59 years old , and 15.9 % for those > 60 years old ) and bmi ( i.e. 6.0 % for those with a bmi < 18.5 kg / m2 , 9.1 % for those with a bmi between 18.5 and 24.9 kg / m2 , 14.7 % for those with a bmi between 25 and 29.9 kg / m2 , and 12.5 % for those with a bmi >= 30 kg / m2 ) .
mongolian - chinese ( 5.1 %) had the lowest prevalence of co - prehtn and predm , whereas both the han - chinese ( 12.0 %) and korean - chinese ( 11.6 %) demonstrated a two - fold greater risk of co - prehtn and predm than the mongolian - chinese .
furthermore , those with a lower educational level , such as primary or secondary education , tended to have a higher prevalence of co - prehtn and predm .
co - prehtn and predm participants were more likely to be married , ex - smoking , and current alcohol drinkers ( p < 0.0001 ) .

cardiometabolic risk profile a summary of the cardiometabolic risk factors of the study population are presented in table 3 , according to their cardiometabolic status ( i.e. normotensive and normoglycemic , prehypertensive and prediabetic , or hypertensive and diabetic ) .
sbp ( 108.9 +/ - 7.2 , 126.3 +/ - 6.9 , 148.9 +/ - 15.6 mmhg , respectively ) and dbp ( 70.1 +/ - 6.0 , 80.4 +/ - 5.7 , 91.8 +/ - 10.1 mmhg , respectively ; p < 0.0001 ) increased gradually across these categories .
furthermore , there was a steady increase in bmi and wc in both men and women with increasing bp and impaired glucose metabolism .
compared to the normotensive and normoglycemic group , the co - prehtn and predm group had a significantly higher ggt ( 28.6 [ 18.0 - 48.9 ] u / l ) , ua ( 333.4 +/ - 86.4 mumol / l ) , and fasting serum glucose ( 6.0 +/ - 0.3 mmol / l ; p < 0.0001 ). with respect to the fasting lipid profiles , both tg and tc were significantly lower in normotensive and normoglycemic individuals compared to those with co - prehtn and predm ( both p < 0.0001 ) .
additionally , atherogenic ldl - c was significantly lower , whereas anti - atherogenic hdl - c was significantly higher ( both p < 0.0001 ) in normotensive and normoglycemic individuals versus those with co - prehtn and predm .

discussion in the present study , the population studied presents a high prevalence of co - prehtn and predm in apparently healthy chinese adults .
the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm was even higher in men than women , and increased with age and bmi .
our findings suggest that prevalence of co - prehtn and predm in our population is similar to that observed in a recent survey conducted in a healthy us population [ 15 ] .
it has been previously reported that predm markedly increases cvd risk in prehypertensive individuals [ 16 ] .
the recent findings of the strong heart study also revealed that in non - diabetic individuals , ifg and prehtn increases the number of cardiovascular events by 2.06 - fold compared to their normotensive and normoglycemic counterparts , with an absolute increase of 5 cardiovascular events per 1000 person years [ 10 ] .
it has also been previously shown that there are marked ethnic and geographic differences in bp and fbg levels in china [ 9,17 ] .
living conditions , habitual diets , and social circumstances in disparate communities also exhibit different characteristics .
in the present study , the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm was higher in the hei longjiang province of northern china compared to the inner mongolian autonomous region in northeastern china ( 13.3 % versus 8.8 %) .
there are a number of potential factors that may contribute to these differences .
for example , there are more people in the hei longjiang province that are overweight or obese , dyslipidemic , and have a higher salt intake [ 18 ] .
unfortunately , data on dietary sodium intake were not collected in the present study .
furthermore , based on the regional differences , there may be genetic contributions to the co - prehtn and predm phenotype that should also be considered .
there was a higher prevalence of co - prehtn and predm among individuals that consumed alcohol and smoked .
this finding was consistent with earlier studies , which found that excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking increase bp and glucose levels [ 19,20 ] .
interestingly , we also found that there was higher prevalence of ex - smokers than current smokers in the co - prehtn and predm group .
this observation can be explained by the findings of inoue k [ 21 ] , who suggested that the adverse effects associated with the weight gain following cessation of smoking outweigh the benefits .
weight gain is a strong risk factor for cvd , which is also closely associated with a substantial risk for impaired glucose regulation and elevated bp [ 22 ] .
in the present study , we also observed that , with the exception of hdl - c , the lipid profile and glucose levels demonstrated a gradual upward trend from the normotensive and normoglycemic group , followed by the co - prehtn and predm group , and lastly the hypertensive and diabetic group .
in addition to the larger wc and bmi , our findings also suggest that these considerably " healthy " men and women are at an increased risk for cvd .
other biochemical parameters , such as ggt and ua levels , were also relatively higher in subjects with co - prehtn and predm .
recent cross - sectional and longitudinal studies have also noted a relatively independent association between elevated serum ggt levels , and hypertension and diabetes [ 23,24 ] .
we have also revealed that higher serum ggt levels are positively associated with prehtn in an otherwise healthy chinese adult population following various adjustments in the multivariate logistic regression analysis ( unpublished observations ) .
in addition , a recent study [ 25 ] found that elevated ggt was independently associated with the presence of the ifg , further supporting our conclusion .
similarly , serum ua levels correlated with metabolic abnormalities and cvd [ 26 ] .
a previous study [ 27 ] found that there is a significant association between serum ua levels and the risk of prehtn .
meanwhile , in the rancho bernardo study , it was suggested that ua may be a useful predictor of type 2 diabetes in older adults with ifg [ 28 ] .
however , the underlying mechanisms for higher ggt and ua in subjects with co - prehtn and predm are unclear and require further clarification .
a major strength of our study is that it is a population - based study with a good representative sample of the general chinese population .
additionally , the larger sample size ensures sufficient power in estimating the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm , as well as determining the correlation between co - prehtn and predm , and cvd risk factors .
lastly , the use of standardized protocols and instruments guaranteed a high response rate and excellent quality control .
however , the study also has several limitations .
first , oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) was not performed in subjects with ifg , thereby potentially reducing the accurate diagnosis of diabetes .
since some individuals with normal fbg may have igt , based on ogtt data , examining fbg alone ( i.e. without a 2 - h pbg ) may result in the underestimating of the prevalence of co - prehtn and predm in healthy chinese adults .
lastly , the study is based on a cross - sectional survey , which is unable to determine causality or the temporal relationship between cvd risk factors and co - prehtn and predm .
conclusions our data highlights the high prevalence of co - prehtn and predm in disease - free chinese adults from northern and northeastern china. with the exception of hdl - c , higher lipid profile levels , as well as ggt , ua , and fbg , in co - prehtn and predm individuals may have important pathophysiological implications .
all of these changes have been shown to increase cvd risk , and thereby suggests that there is an urgent need for early detection and appropriate interventions .
a healthy lifestyle , such as weight control , increased physical activity , moderate alcohol intake , tobacco cessation , salt reduction , and sufficient consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could prevent the progression of co - prehtn and predm to overt hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
public health programs are required to improve this situation in the chinese population .

recent who guidelines recommend a universal " test and treat " strategy for malaria , mainly by use of rapid diagnostic test ( rdt ) in all areas .
the evidence for this approach is questioned here as there is a risk of over - reliance on parasitological diagnosis in high transmission situations , which still exist .
in such areas , when a patient has fever or other malaria symptoms , the presence of plasmodium spp neither reliably confirms malaria as the cause of the fever , nor excludes the possibility of other diseases .
this is because the patient may be an asymptomatic carrier of malaria parasites and suffer from another disease .
to allow clinicians to perform their work adequately , local epidemiologic data are necessary .
one size does not fit all .
if parasite prevalence in the population is low , a diagnostic test is relevant ; if the prevalence is high , the test does not provide information of any clinical usefulness , as happens with any test in medicine when the prevalence of the tested characteristic is high in the healthy population .
it should also be remembered that , if in some cases anti - malarials are prescribed to parasite - negative patients , this will not increase selection pressure for drug resistance , because the parasite is not there .
in high transmission situations at least , other diagnoses should be sought in all patients , irrespective of the presence of malaria parasites .
for this , clinical skills ( but not necessarily physicians ) are irreplaceable , in order to differentiate malaria from other causes of acute fever , such as benign viral infection or potentially dangerous conditions , which can all be present with the parasite co - existing only as a " commensal " or silent undesirable guest .
background the latest who guidelines on the treatment of malaria state that , whenever possible , " in all settings , clinical suspicion of malaria should be confirmed with a parasitological diagnosis " [ 1,2 ] .
this is a significant change from the previous guidelines [ 3 ] , which recognized that parasitological diagnosis is not always necessary , particularly in high transmission areas .
this new universal " test and treat " recommendation is based on a series of questionable assumptions ( table 1 ) [ 1 ] .
the question of whether to test and treat or to treat presumptively is still hotly debated [ 4,5 ] .
table 1 advantages and disadvantages of parasitological diagnosis advantages of parasitological diagnosis ( according to who guidelines , section 6.1 , 6.2 ) disadvantages of parasitological diagnosis in high transmission areas diagnosis based on clinical features alone has very low specificity and results in over - treatment parasitological diagnosis has low specificity improved patient care in parasite - positive patients in a patient with fever , the presence of parasites neither reliably confirms malaria as the cause of the fever , nor excludes the possibility of other diseases identification of parasite - negative patients in whom another diagnosis must be sought other diagnoses should be sought in all patients , irrespective of the presence of malaria parasites prevention of unnecessary use of anti - malarials , reducing frequency of adverse effects especially in those who do not need the medicines , and drug pressure selecting for resistant parasites clinicians often prescribe anti - malarials even for patients with a negative test .
prescribing anti - malarials to parasite - negative patients will not increase selection pressure for new drug resistant mutations .
improved malaria case detection and reporting some " cases " detected in high - transmission areas are incidental carriers of malaria parasites , presenting with another disease confirmation of treatment failures rdts cannot confirm treatment failures .
it is only possible to do this with microscopy .
who 's assumptions are discussed one by one , considering their applicability to high - transmission settings , which still exist .
basically , the << level of transmission >> in malarial areas is an entomological concept .
in most cases , the so - called transmission level is derived from the proportion of infected people in the general population .
for practical purposes , it is considered here that << low transmission >> is characteristic of areas where this proportion in the general population is below 20 %. between 20 and 50 % , one can speak of << moderate transmission >> and << high >> above 50 % .
since there is no universal definition , or cut - off figures , for " high - transmission " , the discussion below will detail at what levels of parasite prevalence in the population a parasitological test supports , or does not support , clinical decisions .
review of the evidence for the assumptions underlying who 's recommendation assumption 1 : " diagnosis based on clinical features alone has very low specificity and results in over - treatment " the specificity of a diagnostic algorithm or test almost always varies according to the prevalence of the target condition .
clinical diagnosis and parasitological tests for malaria are no exception .
the specificity of clinical diagnosis of malaria varies according to age group , time , place and the epidemiology of the disease .
in low - transmission settings , specificity of clinical diagnosis is low and specificity of parasitological tests ( e.g. rapid diagnostic tests - rdts ) is high , whereas in high - transmission areas the reverse is the case [ 6 ] .
in children in a high - transmission setting , during the rainy season , high fever of short duration , with no other obvious cause , is most likely to be malaria [ 7 ] .
in some such settings over 80 % of febrile patients ( all ages ) with presumed malaria are parasite positive , and the " test and treat " strategy is not cost - effective , particularly in children and where the cost of treatment is lower than that of the test [ 8,9 ] .
assumption 2 : " patient care will be improved in parasite - positive patients " this assumption is incorrect , particularly in high transmission areas .
in a randomized controlled trial ( in burkina faso in 2006 ) , comparing outcomes in patients treated either presumptively or after use of an rdt , there was no difference in outcomes between groups [ 10 ] , i.e. the use of rdt did not improve care in this setting .
the more prevalent a characteristic is in the healthy population , the less useful it is to test for this characteristic as a means of detecting disease .
a useful tool for evaluating the clinical utility of a test is to calculate the likelihood ratio of having a disease , based on a positive or a negative result .
the likelihood ratio multiplied by the pre - test odds of the disease gives the post - test odds .
figures 1 , and 2 show how pre - and post - test probability of malaria infection for a negative and a positive test result change according to the background prevalence of infection with malaria parasites and the sensitivity of the test , 95 % in figure 1 and 85 % in figure 2 ( based on statistical modelling [ 11 ]) .
the 85 % sensitivity might be closer to what happens when the test has been stored in relatively hot conditions [ 12 ] .
figure 1 pre - test and post - test probability of infection with malaria parasites for patients with a positive or negative test result , in areas of differing malaria prevalence , assuming a sensitivity and a specificity of the test of 95 % .
( data from [ 11 ]) figure 2 pre - test and post - test probability of infection with malaria parasites for patients with a positive or negative test result , in areas of differing malaria prevalence , assuming a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of the test of 95 % .
( data from [ 11 ]) in summary , where the prevalence of malaria infection is low , a parasitological test is useful : if it is negative , the post - test probability of malaria is almost zero .
if the test is positive , the probability of malaria is greatly increased .
however at higher levels of prevalence , a negative test does not rule out infection with malaria parasites , and a positive test does not greatly increase the probability of malaria infection ( which is already high ) .
there is no clear threshold for applying a cut - off , but one commonly used rule is that a test is clinically useful to " rule in " or " rule out " a disease if the positive likelihood ratio is > = 5 , or if the negative likelihood ratio is < = 0.2 respectively [ 13 ] .
applying this rule , a positive test ceases to be clinically useful at a prevalence of > 20 % ( see figure 3 ) .
figure 3 likelihood ratios of malaria when the parasite detection test is positive ( lr +) and likelihood ratios of the absence of malaria when the parasite detection test is negative ( lr - ) , according to the prevalence of infection in the general population , and to the sensitivity and specificity of the test for the detection of parasites .
clinically useful tests are above the line ( lr > 5 ) .
( data from [ 11 ]) parasite prevalence has declined in some parts of africa , but the median in a recent review is still 22 %[ 14 ]. of note this review did not include any studies from rural west africa after 2000 , and excluded community - based studies .
table 2 shows the prevalence of malaria in populations where diagnostic tests have been deployed since 2005 .
the weighted overall mean parasite prevalence ( = pre - test probability ) was 51.7 % ( of 87 703 patients tested ) .
populations develop partial immunity against malaria by the age of five years and in such semi - immune individuals even high levels of parasite density do not reliably predict fever incidence [ 15 ] .

like many commensal organisms , p. falciparum can produce symptoms , but may also be asymptomatic ( it may , however , have undesirable effects in the long run ) .
detecting the presence of parasites can be misleading .
it may divert the attention of clinicians from other diagnoses if they do not conduct an appropriate clinical examination .
for example , the case of an infant is reported with a positive malaria test who was only treated with anti - malarials but subsequently died of presumed pneumonia [ 10 ] .
paradoxically the care of parasite - positive patients may worsen through over - reliance on diagnostic tests at the expense of clinical examination [ 4 ] .
assumption 3 : " identification of parasite - negative patients in whom another diagnosis must be sought " in high transmission areas , other diagnoses should be sought in all patients , irrespective of the presence of malaria parasites .
some analyses assume that there is no co - infection between malarial and bacterial infections [ 16 ] , but this assumption is clearly incorrect .
for example 14 % of unconscious children aged < 1 year presenting to kilifi hospital in kenya had both malaria parasites and definite bacterial meningitis [ 17 ] .
therefore in secondary care settings ( in high - transmission areas ) , in children presenting with serious febrile illness , bacterial illness should be considered regardless of parasitological test results [ 18 ] .
however it is inappropriate to extrapolate findings from severely ill children in secondary care settings , to children with uncomplicated febrile illness in primary care settings [ 5 ] , which are the majority of the cases in which parasitological tests have been used ( table 2 ) .
a parasite - negative child with uncomplicated febrile illness is not at high risk of other life - threatening bacterial diseases , and the most common other diagnosis is viral upper - respiratory tract infection [ 9,19 ] .
unless other clinical features of a bacterial infection are present , antibiotics are not indicated .
antibiotics should not be overused in primary care settings , otherwise there is a higher risk of evolution and spread of resistant bacteria ( because all human beings harbour commensal bacteria which can evolve resistance to antibiotics , and become pathogenic ) .
some studies show that use of rdts increases antibiotic prescribing in malaria - negative patients [ 20,21 ] ( table 2 ) .
if the disease is a common cold , antibiotics should generally be avoided .
for example , in hospital outpatients in tanzania , 74 % of children aged < 5 years with a negative malaria test were prescribed an antibiotic [ 22 ] .
this is not necessarily an indicator of good practice .
in another trial , this time in uganda , 45 % of children with upper respiratory tract infections and common colds were prescribed an antibiotic [ 19 ] .
the need for antibiotics or other treatments should be determined by clinical history and examination , not by the presence or absence of malaria parasites .
key for this is the local quality of clinical work and teaching .
indeed there is an interesting parallel between the decision to prescribe anti - malarials and the decision to prescribe antibiotics for chest infections .
the latter is often based on presumptive diagnosis from clinical features [ 23 ] , and a " bacterial test " would be of dubious utility because there are many healthy carriers .
the utility of a negative result also depends on the sensitivity of the test [ 11 ] ( see figures 1 - 2 ) .
in practice , sensitivity of rdts varies widely according to setting [ 12 ] and brand [ 24 ] .
although some studies have shown excellent sensitivity [ 25 ] , others have shown that sensitivity is much lower in field conditions [ 12 ] ; this can be due to storage temperatures above 30 degree celsius , for example .
sensitivity of rdts is lower for low levels of parasitaemia [ 9,26 ] .
these are irrelevant in semi - immune patients ( age > 5 years in high - transmission settings ) and so in these patients it is safe not to treat rdt - negative patients with anti - malarials [ 27 ] .
however in non - immune infants even very low parasitaemia cause disease and many of these are missed by rdts , which is particularly important in high transmission situations [ 26 ]. of course , the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis varies as well , but in a high - transmission setting presumptive treatment of all febrile infants with anti - malarials is probably safer than relying on the result of an rdt [ 26 ] .
assumption 4 : " prevention of unnecessary use of anti - malarials , reducing frequency of adverse effects , especially in those who do not need the medicines , and drug pressure selecting for resistant parasites " many studies found that diagnostic testing did not prevent the use of anti - malarials for patients in whom no parasites are detected .
table 2 summarizes studies of prescriptions for parasite - negative patients since 2005 .
the two largest and most recent studies in tanzania and uganda found that only 4 % and 9 % of parasite - negative patients were prescribed anti - malarials , although in tanzania the test - and - treat strategy was only used for patients aged 5 years and older [ 28,29 ] .
other studies found that much larger proportions of malaria - negative patients still received anti - malarials .
the weighted mean of all the studies ( for a total of 87703 patients ) was that 23.3 % of parasite - negative patients received a prescription for anti - malarials .
in summary , the use of rdts reduced prescribing of anti - malarials in some studies [ 21,28 - 30 ] but in several cases , using rdts significantly increased costs to the health service provider [ 31 ] .
in no case was there any evidence of clinical benefit to patients or of improved cost - effectiveness .
the argument that treating malaria - negative patients will increase the drug pressure for resistant parasites seems logically incoherent because malaria - negative patients harbour no parasites .
long - acting drugs given together with artemisinin derivatives have a long , slow tail phase of drug elimination , during which time new infections may be acquired .
parasites which already have resistance to these drugs may be selected for , but it is improbable that any new resistant mutations would develop in this context because the biomass of parasites in the inoculum is low .
a strategy for preventing resistance could be to keep acts for patients at highest risk of severe malaria ( non - immune patients ) and to use other medicines for semi - immune patients ( aged 5 years and older , in high - transmission areas ) , who will improve with other treatments [ 32 ] .
assumption 5 : " improved malaria case detection and reporting " parasitological diagnosis will enable health information systems to report more accurately whether patients consulting with fever or treated for malaria actually had evidence of being parasitaemic .
for example , in senegal , there has been a large decrease in reported malaria cases , in part due to better case ascertainment with rdts [ 30 ] .
however , it is not clear whether this advantage alone justifies the extra expense of systematically making a parasitological diagnosis .
regular population studies might be more appropriate for health information and policy design .
while case detection may be improved in low - transmission areas , in high - transmission areas what will often be detected and reported is incidental parasitaemia ( the presence of malaria parasites in a patient presenting symptoms not attributable to the malaria parasite ) rather than clinical malaria .
a more useful measure is the population attributable fraction of fever due to malaria [ 26 ] .
furthermore , since the results may vary considerably in the same individual on the same day , the usual single blood test to determine the presence or absence of parasites may be misleading [ 33,34 ] .
in short , parasitological diagnosis does not mean case detection , because of the importance of carriers who are not cases .
however , rdts may well be the tool of choice for rapid assessment of local epidemiology .
assumption 6 : " confirmation of treatment failures " rapid diagnostic tests based on detection of the hrp - 2 antigen often remain positive for over five weeks after the disappearance of live parasites , because they detect the hrp - 2 antigen which is still present in debris from dead parasites for some time after total parasite clearance [ 35 ] .
this also results in a high " false positive rate " and low specificity of rdts compared to microscopy , particularly in high transmission areas [ 6,36 ] .
if rdts are used to " confirm " treatment failures , many patients will be given a second unnecessary treatment .
microscopy does not help to confirm treatment failure unless it is of excellent quality , which is rare outside of research settings .
in such settings , when high - quality microscopy is available , a negative film is very good at detecting the absence of malaria parasites in the blood ( figure 4 ) and it is unusual for a patient with a negative blood film ( made and read according to a high quality protocol , with double or triple readings of every slide ) to subsequently develop malaria [ 19 ] .
however , it is rarely possible to sustain such high quality microscopy outside the research setting , and poor quality microscopy is not clinically useful [ 37,38 ] for confirmation of treatment failures .

high - quality microscopy is rarely sustained outside the research setting ( photo by m. willcox ) .
discussion from the review of the evidence above it seems that a universal " test and treat " strategy is neither evidence - based nor cost - effective .
the new who guidelines can be understood in the context of the long term goal of elimination of malaria .
however , this is not achievable in the foreseeable future in many areas .
who 's assumptions justifying parasitological diagnosis may well be correct in low - transmission settings , but not in high - transmission settings .
the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia has declined in some parts of africa , so these areas are transitioning from high - transmission to low - transmission .
in these areas , diagnostic tests will become increasingly important .
however , many areas of sub - saharan africa remain high - transmission areas , and the appropriateness and cost - effectiveness of universal testing in these areas is questionable .
malaria is a complex disease and it is impossible to write clinically useful global guidelines on its management , which do not take local epidemiology into account .
in practice countries contain areas with differing levels of transmission , which also depends on seasonality .
it would make more sense to adapt the strategy according to local factors .
this is the way health professionals deal with any infectious disease ( evaluating the probability of a particular disease case by case , according to season , age , place of residence , recent travel , and so on ) .
it is perfectly possible to apply two different policies simultaneously ( for example presumptive treatment for patients aged < 5 years and test - and - treat for older patients )[ 28 ] .
even where such a policy does not formally exist , health workers are more likely to prescribe anti - malarials for rdt - negative patients aged < 5 years than for those aged 5 years and over [ 39 ] .
if health care workers are able to do better than blindly applying global guidelines , this should not be considered " second class " treatment .
the level of skill required to identify serious infection , malaria and ' trivial ' viral infection is probably achieved through standard medical training in most countries , but it remains to be seen to what extent it is also achievable for shorter training in other health professions .
if the who recommendations have little influence on clinical practice , this may not be due solely to problems of policy implementation , but also to the fact that the debate has been closed too early [ 1 ] .
those clinicians using their clinical skills and not following the recommended " test and treat strategy " in high transmission areas do not increase the danger for their patients nor jeopardize the future of the malaria global strategy .
they may well act this way not against their will or because of logistical problems or lack of information .
the reliance on clinical skills and " bedside reasoning " , based on , among others , the knowledge of local epidemiology , makes good sense in the clinical encounter .
the presumptive treatment strategy for malaria could be in the best interest of some patients , now and in the future , at least in high - transmission areas where eradication is not in sight .
cost - effectiveness must also be an important consideration especially in settings where health care resources are limited .
in settings of high transmission the cost saving from avoiding act is outweighed by the greater cost of deploying rdts universally [ 9,31 ] .
rdts are not cost - effective even in low - transmission areas , unless adherence to their results is high [ 8 ] .
even where the adherence is relatively good there is no clear evidence of any clinical benefit [ 20 ] .
there may be higher priorities for limited resources than universal parasitological diagnosis .
conclusion there is a need for policies and clinical strategies adapted to different settings .
each area should develop its own guidelines based on sound evidence , taking into consideration both the local epidemiology of malaria and other febrile diseases and a realistic assessment of available healthcare resources .
it would be a dangerous mistake to rely too much on diagnostic tests in areas where parasite prevalence is high .
clinical examination and reasoning remain necessary in order to differentiate malaria from other causes of acute disease such as benign viral infection or potentially dangerous conditions ( which can all be present with the parasite co - existing only as a commensal or undesirable guest ) .
to allow clinicians to perform their work adequately , local epidemiological data are necessary : in areas of low parasite prevalence , a diagnostic test is relevant ; if the prevalence is high , the test does not provide information of any clinical usefulness .
in this latter case , clinical skills are irreplaceable .

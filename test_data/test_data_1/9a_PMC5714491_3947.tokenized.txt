single - gene overdominance is one of the major mechanisms proposed to explain heterosis ( i.e. , hybrid vigor ) , the phenomenon that hybrid offspring between two inbred lines or varieties show superior phenotypes to both parents .
although sporadic examples of single - gene overdominance have been reported over the decades , the molecular nature of this phenomenon remains poorly understood and it is unclear whether any generalizable principle underlies the various cases. through bulk segregant analysis , chemical profiling , and transgenic experiments , we show that loss - of - function alleles of the flavone synthase ( fns ) gene cause overdominance in anthocyanin - based flower color intensity in the monkeyflower species mimulus lewisii .
fns negatively affects flower color intensity by competing with the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes for the same substrates , yet positively affects flower color intensity by producing flavones , the colorless copigments required for anthocyanin stabilization , leading to enhanced pigmentation in the heterozyote ( fns / fns ) relative to both homozygotes ( fns / fns and fns / fns ) .
we suggest that this type of antagonistic pleiotropy ( i.e. , alleles with opposing effects on different components of the phenotypic output ) might be a general principle underlying single - gene overdominance .
heterosis mimulus flavone synthase antagonistic pleiotropy anthocyanins it has been known for > 100 yr that intercrosses between divergent inbred lines or varieties within a species can often yield hybrid offspring with stronger performance than both parents ( darwin 1876 ) , a phenomenon termed heterosis or hybrid vigor ( east 1908 , 1936 ; shull 1908 , 1914 ) .
due to its obvious value for crop improvement , heterosis has been utilized extensively in agriculture in the past century ( duvick 1999 ) .
two long - standing hypotheses are routinely discussed in explaining the genetic bases of heterosis ( east 1908 , 1936 ; shull 1911 ; jones 1917 ; crow 1948 ; birchler et al. 2003 ; lippman and zamir 2007 ) .
the " dominance " hypothesis proposes that deleterious recessive alleles at many loci in each parent are complemented by the dominant alleles from the other parent , resulting in better performance in the hybrid as a whole .
in contrast , the " overdominance " model argues that allelic interactions at potentially a single locus could lead to a stronger phenotype in the heterozygote than both homozygous parents .
a third model emphasizing the role of epistatic interactions among loci also has gained substantial support ( schnell and cockerham 1992 ; yu et al. 1997 ; goff and zhang 2013 ) .
among these hypotheses , single - gene overdominance remains the most enigmatic from a mechanistic viewpoint .
however , this model is perhaps the most attractive from an applied perspective , as single - gene manipulations could theoretically lead to the improvement of agricultural crops ( krieger et al. 2010 ; park et al. 2014 ) .
although several convincing examples of single - gene overdominance have been reported over the decades [ reviewed in liberatore et al .
( 2013 )] , the molecular nature of this phenomenon is far from resolved ( goff and zhang 2013 ; liberatore et al. 2013 ) .
perhaps the most widely discussed example of single - gene overdominance is that of human sickle cell anemia .
a hemoglobin mutation negatively affects human survival by causing sickle cell anemia , but positively affects human survival by protecting against malaria ( pauling et al. 1949 ; aidoo et al. 2002 ; ferreira et al. 2011 ) .
in this case , human survival is the phenotype of interest ; sickle cell anemia and resistance to malaria are two important components that determine the final phenotypic output .
the strongest phenotype is achieved in the heterozygote by balancing the antagonistic effects of the mutant allele .
this model of antagonistic pleiotropy was first described to explain the maintenance of human senescence ( williams 1957 ) , and later coopted as a mechanism of overdominance to explain the prevalence of some human disease alleles ( e.g. , huntington 's disease and cystic fibrosis ) ( carter and nguyen 2011 ) .
however , this notion was rarely considered as a potential mechanism underlying the sporadically reported cases of overdominance ( liberatore et al .
2013 ) outside of the context of human disease dynamics .
to gain more mechanistic insights into single - gene overdominance , we have analyzed a flower color locus of the monkeyflower species mimulus lewisii .
the m. lewisii inbred line lf10 bears light pink flowers due to anthocyanin accumulation in the petal lobes ( figure 1a ) .
three allelic , ethyl methanesulfonate ( ems ) mutants generated in the lf10 background are phenotypically indistinguishable and display a clear overdominant effect in flower color intensity : the homozygous mutant produces very pale flowers , whereas the heterozygote has flower color darker than both the wild - type and the homozygous mutant ( figure 1a ) .
figure 1 mutant fns alleles of mimulus lewisii cause overdominance in flower color intensity .
( a ) flower phenotype of the wild - type lf10 (+/+) , the heterozygous mutant (+/ - ) , and the homozygous mutant ( - / - ) .
( b ) the three allelic mutants ( ml10422 , ml12540 , and ml14138 ) all harbor nonconservative amino acid replacements at highly conserved sites of fns ( also see figure s1 in file s1 ) .
floral anthocyanin pigmentation is fairly - well understood in m. lewisii .
loss - of - function mutations in the transcriptional activators ( i.e. , the r2r3 - myb , bhlh , and wd40 regulatory complex ) of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway ( abp ) lead to very pale or white flowers ( yuan et al. 2014 ) .
dark pink flowers can be produced by downregulation of the abp repressor , rose intensity1 ( roi1 ) ( yuan et al .
2013a ) , or alternatively , by knocking down the expression level of flavonol synthase ( fls ) ( yuan et al .
2016 ) , which encodes an enzyme that competes with the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes for the same substrate , dihydroflavonol .
however , none of these previously characterized genes was known to have an overdominant effect in flower color intensity , indicating a yet to be discovered gene underlying the overdominant phenotype .
here , we report flavone synthase ( fns ) as the causal gene , and suggest antagonistic pleiotropy as a general mechanism of single - gene overdominance .
materials and methods plant materials the m. lewisii inbred line lf10 ( wild - type ) was described in yuan et al .
( 2013a ) .
the three ems mutants ( ml10422 , ml12540 , and ml14138 ) were generated using lf10 , following owen and bradshaw ( 2011 ) .
plants were grown in the university of connecticut eeb research greenhouses under natural light supplemented with sodium vapor lamps , ensuring a 16 hr day length .
genomic analyses for causal gene identification previously , we have used bulk segregant analysis coupled with illumina sequencing to map the causal genes underlying m. lewisii ems mutants that were generated in the lf10 background ( yuan et al. 2013b ; sagawa et al. 2016 ; ding et al. 2017 ; stanley et al. 2017 ) .
all previous bulk segregant analyses were performed on f2 populations between a mutant and the mapping line sl9 .
unfortunately , sl9 produces pale pink flowers , which may confound phenotype scoring in this case since the focal phenotype of this study involves flower color intensity .
to circumvent this problem , we employed a novel , hybrid strategy that combines bulk segregant analysis of an " lf10 x ml10422 " f2 population and genome comparisons between multiple mutants .
an lf10 x ml10422 f2 population ( 455 individuals ) was grown to flower .
flower color segregated as follows : 112 light pink ( homozygous for the wild - type allele ) , 235 dark pink ( heterozygous ) , and 98 very pale ( homozygous for the mutant allele ) .
dna samples from 96 very - pale individuals ( i.e. , homozygous for the mutant allele ) were pooled with equal representation .
a small - insert library (~ 300 bp ) was prepared for the pooled sample and 340 million paired - end , 125 bp reads were generated by an illumina hiseq 2500 ( bioproject : prjna335519 ) .
the short reads were mapped to the lf10 genome assembly version 1.8 ( http :// monkeyflower.uconn.edu / resources /) using clc genomics workbench 7.0 ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) .
theoretically , there should be very few single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of near 100 % frequency in the " f2 reads - lf10 genome " alignment , because the only differences between the mutant genome and the lf10 genome are the ems - induced mutations .
among those mutations , the vast majority are unlinked to the causal gene and should segregate randomly in the f2 population with snp frequency closer to 50 % than 100 % .
however , in reality , there are often thousands or tens of thousands such high - frequency snps after short - read mapping , due to assembly error in the reference genome and nonspecific mapping of repetitive sequences .
one way to filter out these artifactual high - frequency snps is to compare the snp profiles of multiple bulk segregant analysis experiments , as these artifactual snps are expected to be shared between multiple mutant snp profiles , whereas the true causal mutation should be unique to each mutant .
therefore , in addition to ml10422 , we also mapped the short reads from four previously published mutants , guideless ( yuan et al. 2013b ) , rcp1 ( sagawa et al. 2016 ) , act1 - d ( ding et al. 2017 ) , and rcp2 ( stanley et al .
2017 ) , to the lf10 reference genome for between - mutant comparisons .
the 134,456 raw snps that resulted from the ml10422 mapping were first filtered by frequency (> 95 %) and depth of coverage (< 200 ) .
snps with > 200 - fold coverage were discarded because these regions are highly repetitive and the reads were likely to be mapped incorrectly .
the remaining 36,247 snps were then compared with the other four mutant profiles sequentially using a customized perl script ( available upon request ) : 2603 snps remained after comparison to guideless , 2361 snps remained after comparison to rcp1 , 33 snps remained after comparison to act1 - d , and after comparison to rcp2 only 20 snps unique to ml10244 were left .
chemical analyses of petal flavonoids flavonoid extraction and identification essentially followed lin and harnly ( 2007 ) .
for each genotype , petals from two flowers were ground in a glass tissue homogenizer with 60 % ( v / v ) methanol solution for 2 min , after which time the material appeared to be completely pulverized .
the solution containing the tissue was then transferred to a glass test tube and sonicated for 1 hr using a fisher scientific fs20 bath type sonicator .
ice was added to the bath approximately every 15 min to prevent excessive heating of the samples .
following sonication , the solution was centrifuged for 1 min at 13,600 x g and then filtered using 4 mm millex hv ( 0.45 mum ) syringe filters to remove all debris .
absorption spectra of the sonicated extracts were measured from 200 to 600 nm in a 2 mm path cuvette using a varian cary 50 uv / vis spectrometer and compared to those reported by harborne ( 1984 ) and the bona fide apigenin and apigenin - 7 - glucuronide standards ( sigma - aldrich ) .
tandem mass spectrometry ( msms ) analyses were performed using an applied biosystems api2000 instrument in esi mode with the following conditions : curtain gas , 20 psi ; ionspray voltage , - 4200 v ; temperature , ambient ; ion source gas , 20 psi ; ion source gas 2 , 6 psi ; declustering potential , - 20 v ; focusing potential , - 200 v ; entrance potential , - 10 v ; scan intervals , 0.5 sec .
the collision energy was - 50 ev. mobile phase was acetonitrile delivered at a rate of 50 mul / min .
high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) for separation of pigments was conducted using a waters 600 hplc system equipped with a 2996 photodiode array detector and a waters atlantis dc18 analytical column ( 4.6 x 250 mm , 5 mum ) .
the mobile phase protocol was as described in lin and harnly ( 2007 ) .
plasmid construction and plant transformation to build the rna interference ( rnai ) construct for fns knockdown , a 328 bp fragment from the second exon of mlfns was amplified with phusion high - fidelity dna polymerase ( new england biolabs ) using a pair of primers with added restriction sites for cloning : mlfns _ rnai _ f ( 5 ' - gttctagaccatggacgaaaccccaagatctgggaa - 3 ') and mlfns _ rnai _ r ( 5 ' - gtggatccggcgcgcctcaattccccgaaactacaacg - 3 ') .
the amplified fragment was inserted into the binary vector pfgc5941 ( kerschen et al. 2004 ) by a two - step procedure .
first the pcr product was cloned into the original pfgc5941 vector in the sense orientation as an asci / ncoi fragment , and then the same pcr product was cloned in the antisense orientation into the bamhi / xbai site of the plasmid that already contained the sense fragment .
the final plasmid construct was verified by sequencing and then transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv3101 for subsequent plant transformation ( into the wild - type lf10 ) .
plant transformation was conducted as detailed in yuan et al .
( 2013a ). a. tumefaciens was cultured in 300 ml of sterilized lb broth ( fisher scientific ) containing kanamycin ( 50 mg / l ) , rifampicin ( 25 mg / l ) , and gentamicin ( 50 mg / l ) .
the entire culture was pelleted and resuspended in 250 ml of 5 % sucrose solution , which contained 0.1 m acetosyringone and 0.1 % ( v / v ) of surfactant silwet l - 77 ( osi specialties ) .
early - stage flower buds (< 5 mm ) were sprayed directly with the inoculation solution until thoroughly soaked .
the entire plants were then placed into a vacuum chamber and held at 28 - 30 in hg for 2 min before a rapid release of pressure .
postinfiltrated plants were maintained in plastic tents with high humidity for a 24 hr period before returning them to the greenhouse .
flowers were hand pollinated and the resulting seeds were densely sowed in 25 x 30 cm flats .
transgenic glufosinate - resistant plants were selected by daily spraying the young seedlings with 1:1000 dilution of finale ( bayer ) .
quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr ( qrt - pcr ) was performed to determine the relative expression level of fns and the abp genes ( mlchsa , mlchi , mlf3ha , mldfr , and mlans ) in the rnai lines compared to the wild - type .
total rna was isolated from 10 mm corolla using the spectrum plant total rna kit ( sigma - aldrich ) .
for each sample , we treated 1 mug of total rna with amplification grade dnasei ( invitrogen ) before cdna syntheses using the superscript iii first - strand synthesis system ( invitrogen ) .
cdna samples were diluted 10 - fold before qrt - pcr , which was performed using iq sybr green supermix ( bio - rad ) in a cfx96 touch real - time pcr detection system ( bio - rad ) .
samples were amplified for 40 cycles of 95degrees for 15 sec and 60degrees for 30 sec .
mlubc was used as the reference gene ( yuan et al. 2013a ) .
primer amplification efficiencies were determined using critical threshold values obtained from a dilution series ( 1:4 , 1:8 , 1:16 , and 1:32 ) of pooled cdna .
primer sequences are listed in supplemental material , table s1 in file s1 .
relative expression of the target gene compared to the reference gene was calculated using the formula ( eref ) cp ( ref )/( etarget ) cp ( target ) .
data availability seeds are available upon request .
file s1 contains all supplemental data , including four supplemental figures and three supplemental tables .
the annotated fns sequence is deposited in genbank under accession number kx710102 .
illumina short - read data have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive ( bioproject : prjna335519 ) .
results for each of the three mutant lines ( ml10422 , ml12540 , and ml14138 ) , the m2 generation showed a 1:2:1 segregation ratio of light pink : dark pink : very pale in flower color ( figure 1a and table s2 in file s1 ) .
backcrossing a very pale individual of each mutant line to lf10 produced f1 progenies that were all dark pink , and a relatively large ml10422 x lf10 f2 population ( 455 individuals ) used for bulk segregant analysis ( see materials and methods ) again showed a 1:2:1 segregation ratio among the three phenotypes ( 112:235:98 ) .
these results suggest that the mutant phenotype is caused by a single locus and that the very pale individuals are homozygous for the mutant allele ( fns / fns ) , whereas the dark pink individuals are heterozygous ( fns / fns ) .
in addition , pair - wise complementation crosses between homozygous mutants ( i.e. , very pale ) from the three mutant lines all resulted in very pale offspring , indicating that the three mutants represent different alleles of the same locus .
the combination of bulk segregant analysis and comparison of snp profiles between multiple ems mutants ( see materials and methods ) narrowed the causal mutation of ml10422 down to 20 candidate snps , the vast majority of which locate in noncoding , repetitive sequences ( table s3 in file s1 ) .
only two of the 20 candidates are nonsynonymous mutations in coding dnas , one of which causes a drastic amino acid replacement ( m371k ) at a highly conserved site of the enzyme fns ( genbank : kx710102 ) ( figure 1b , and figure s1 and figure s2 in file s1 ) .
this is interesting because fns utilizes the same substrate , flavanone , as the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes ( figure 2a ) , and the colorless flavone products generated by fns are structurally similar to anthocyanins and have been shown to enhance anthocyanin stability as copigments in numerous plant species [ goto and kondo 1991 ; yabuya et al. 2000 ; kalisz et al. 2013 ; and see recent review by trouillas et al. ( 2016 )] .

the fns mutation immediately offers a potential explanation for the overdominant behavior , as illustrated in figure 3 .
assuming the drastic amino acid replacement ( m371k ) is a loss - of - function mutation , the heterozygote flower produces only half of functional fns enzymes compared to the wild - type , leading to less competition with the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes for substrates ( i.e. , flavanone ) and consequently more anthocyanin production .
meanwhile , the half dosage of functional fns enzymes still produces sufficient flavones to stabilize the anthocyanins .
the final outcome is a dark pink flower in the heterozygote .
the homozygote fns / fns flower produces no functional fns enzymes and thus no competition to anthocyanin biosynthesis .
however , the complete lack of flavone copigments leads to rapid degradation of anthocyanins and the final product is a very pale flower .
figure 3 schematic illustration of the antagonistic pleiotropic effects of the mutant flavone synthase ( fns ) allele in anthocyanin accumulation .
this model makes three clear predictions : ( i ) the other allelic mutants , ml12540 and ml14138 , should also harbor putative loss - of - function mutations in fns ; ( ii ) the homozygous mutant should be devoid of flavones but may accumulate flavanone precursors , whereas the heterozyote and the wild - type produce plenty of flavones ; and ( iii ) knocking down fns expression in the wild - type should result in a gradient of flower color intensity with different flavone - flavanone profiles , depending on the extent of the knockdown .
sequencing the fns gene from ml12540 and ml14138 revealed a mutation in each that also causes nonconservative amino acid replacement at highly conserved sites ( figure 1b and figure s1 in file s1 ) , consistent with the first prediction .
these multiple alleles support that fns is the causal gene ( more evidence from transgenic experiments are described in a later paragraph ) , and were renamed fns - 1 ( ml10422 ) , fns - 2 ( ml12540 ) , and fns - 3 ( ml14138 ) .
to test the second prediction , petal extracts in a 60 % methanol ( v / v ) solution were first analyzed by uv / vis spectroscopy .
the absorption spectra revealed that the wild - type and fns - 1 / fns - 1 heterozygote both exhibited two major absorption peaks at 267 and 335 nm ( figure 2b ) , a feature of apigenin - like flavones ( harborne 1984 ) , whereas the fns - 1 / fns - 1 homozygote exhibited two major absorption peaks at 284 and 329 nm , a feature of glycosylated naringenin ( i.e. , flavanone ) ( harborne 1984 ) .
anthocyanins , which display a characteristic band between 475 and 560 nm ( harborne 1984 ) , were not observed in the spectra of any genotype due to rapid postextraction degradation .
to further characterize the molecular identities of these flavonoids , the samples were analyzed by msms ( figure 2 and figure s3 in file s1 ) .
msms fragmentation patterns revealed that the three most prominent ions from the wild - type sample ( 761 , 625 , and 445 m / z ) all display product ions at 445 and 269 m / z ( figure 2e ) , which are consistent with apigenin - 7 - glucuronide and free apigenin , respectively , a pattern confirmed by fragmentation of a bona fide apigenin - 7 - glucuronide standard ( figure s3 , a - d in file s1 ) .
in contrast , the prominent ions from the homozygous mutant sample ( figure 2d ) are consistent with glycosylated derivatives of the flavanone naringenin ( e.g. , 699 , 519 , and 475 m / z , figure 2h ) , and its hydroxylated form eriodictyol ( 535 m / z , figure s3 , e and f in file s1 ) .
fragmentation of the 519 m / z molecular ion reveals masses at 272 ( free naringenin ) , 151 , and 119 m / z ( figure 2f ) .
the latter two fragments are consistent with the cleavage of naringenin in a pattern reported for similar flavonoid structures by lin and harnly ( 2007 ) and wojakowska et al .
( 2012 ) , wherein cleavage occurs between c3 - c4 and o1 - c2 ( figure 2h ) .
similarly , fragmentation of the 535 m / z ion reveals a mass at 287 m / z ( free eriodictyol ) , with subsequent cleavage of the c3 - c4 and o1 - c2 bonds to form the 151 and 119 m / z fragments ( figure s4e in file s1 ) .
cochromatography with bona fide standards conducted as part of the hplc analyses also indicates that apigenin - 7 - glucuronide is the primary flavone component in petal extracts of the wild - type as well as the fns - 1 / fns - 1 heterozygote , but is completely absent from the homozygous mutant petal , where the flavanone precursors accumulate ( figure 4 ) .
the presence of flavanone precursors in the homozygous mutant , in conjunction with the absence of the corresponding flavones , provides strong evidence that the in planta function of the identified fns protein is indeed to convert flavanone to flavone , consistent with sequence analysis ( figure s2 in file s1 ) and confirming the second prediction .
figure 4 hplc analyses .
shown are the hplc chromatograms of the apigenin - 7 - glucuronide standard ( a ) and whole petal extracts from the wild - type lf10 ( b ) , the homozygous ( c ) and heterozygous ( d ) mutants , and three representative rnai lines ( e - g ) .

hplc , high - performance liquid chromatography ; rnai , rna interference .
to test the third prediction , we constructed an rnai plasmid with a 328 bp fragment from the second exon of fns and transformed it into the wild - type background .
this 328 bp fragment was chosen to minimize off - target effects ; no other genomic regions perfectly match this fragment for a contiguous block longer than 16 bp , as determined by blasting against the lf10 genome assembly with an e - value cutoff of 0.1 .
we obtained 25 independent stable rnai transgenic lines displaying a gradient of flower color intensity ( figure 5 ) .
qrt - pcr at the 10 mm corolla developmental stage showed a general inverse relationship between color intensity and the extent of fns knockdown : ~ 80 % knockdown corresponds to color intensity at or above the wild - type level ( e.g. , lines 14 and 17 ) ; > 95 % knockdown corresponds to the very pale phenotype ( e.g. , lines 9 , 11 , and 12 ) ; and ~ 90 % knockdown leads to intermediate phenotypes ( e.g. , lines 1 and 6 ) ( figure 5 ) .
furthermore , qrt - pcr of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes showed no significant downregulation in the three very pale rnai lines ( lines 9 , 11 , and 12 ) compared to the wild - type ( figure s4 in file s1 ) , indicating that fns knockdown is solely responsible for the very pale phenotype .
figure 5 downregulation of fns using rnai in the wild - type background generates a gradient of flower color intensity .
flower images of nine representative rnai lines are arranged according to their color intensity , which is inversely correlated with the extent of rna knockdown .
relative transcript level of fns in 10 mm corolla was measured by qrt - pcr .
mlubc was used as the reference gene .
error bars represent 1 sd from three technical replicates .
qrt - pcr , quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ; rnai , rna interference .
hplc analyses showed that petal extract of a weak knockdown line ( line 14 ) contains largely flavones , but also accumulates a small proportion of flavanone precursors ( figure 4e ) , whereas a severe line ( line 12 ) completely lacks flavones and only accumulates flavanones ( figure 4g ) , resembling the homozygous mutant ; an intermediate line ( line 1 ) has an intermediate flavone - flavanone profile ( figure 4f ) .
these results confirmed the third prediction .
the fact that transgenic lines with severe fns knockdown could fully recapitulate the homozygous fns / fns mutant phenotype , in both flower color appearance and chemical composition , suggests that the three independent mutant alleles are indeed all loss - of - function alleles and provides further evidence that the in vivo function of the fns product identified herein is responsible for the conversion of flavanone to flavone .
discussion three lines of evidence ( i.e. , multiple mutant alleles , chemical composition of petal extracts , and rnai phenotypes ) support our model explaining the flower color overdominance .
on one hand , the loss - of - function fns alleles positively affect one component of the phenotypic output ( i.e. , anthocyanin production ) by alleviating competition with the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes .
on the other hand , they negatively affect another component of the phenotypic output ( i.e. , anthocyanin maintenance ) by compromising the stabilization capacity .
an overdominant phenotype could be potentially achieved by maximizing the positive effects and meanwhile minimizing the negative effects of the mutant allele ( e.g. , in a heterozygous state , see figure 3 ) .
the maintenance of anthocyanins by stabilizing copigments has been reported in many systems and has been modeled computationally [ reviewed by trouillas et al. ( 2016 )] .
when the production of anthocyanins and the copigments ( e.g. , flavones ) requires the same substrate , the enzyme located at the branching point of these biochemical pathways ( e.g. , anthocyanin vs. flavone biosynthesis ) plays a critical role in balancing the metabolic flux and the ultimate phenotypic output .
this model provides insights into the challenges that underlie anthocyanin biofortification in crops and ornamental plants , an area of great interest due to the reported benefits of these antioxidant compounds to human health ( gould et al .
2008 ) and their significant value to the floriculture industry ( passeri et al. 2016 ) .
a notable example is that transgenic suppression of fns in an attempt to increase anthocyanin concentration in torenia flowers resulted in an unexpected decrease ( ueyama et al .
2002 ) , which was interpreted as a consequence of destabilization of anthocyanins due to the lack of flavones .
however , an overdominant effect was not detected in the torenia study , probably because the fns knockdown was too severe , just as in our very pale rnai lines .
it is worth noting that the m. lewisii overdominant color in the fns / fns heterozygote is by no means a peculiar example of single - gene overdominance .
a study of mutant recessive alleles in maize revealed several loci showing single - gene overdominance for total yield ( dollinger 1985 ). with no exception , the mutant allele at every locus produced antagonistic pleiotropic effects , positively affecting some components and negatively affecting other components of yield .
although the molecular nature of these maize alleles is unknown , these observations support antagonistic pleiotropy ( i.e. , alleles with opposing effects on different components of the phenotypic output ) as a potential general mechanism of single - locus overdominance .
in fact , molecular evidence of the few well - known examples of single - gene overdominance in plants further supports this view .
an early study on alcohol dehydrogenase ( adh ) activity in maize ( schwartz and laughner 1969 ) revealed a molecular basis for single - gene overdominance that is similar to our results .
the adh enzyme is a dimer .
the autodimer in one inbred line has high activity but low stability , whereas the autodimer in another inbred line has low activity but high stability .
the allodimer formed in the heterozygote is both active and stable , a clear case of single - gene overdominance caused by antagonistic pleiotropy .
another example is the loss - of - function single flower truss ( sft ) allele in tomato ( krieger et al. 2010 ) .
total fruit yield is < 50 % of the wild - type in the homozygous condition , but > 160 % of the wild - type in the heterozygous condition .
compared to the wild - type allele , the sft allele negatively affects fruit yield by delaying flowering and reducing flower number per inflorescence , but positively affects fruit yield by altering tomato growth habit and producing more inflorescences per plant , achieving the maximum phenotypic output in the heterozygous condition .
given that virtually all phenotypic traits can be decomposed into multiple components ( e.g. , rice yield can be decomposed to the number of grains and the average weight per grain ) , in conjunction with the vast knowledge base of gene function accumulated in the past few decades , the principle of antagonistic pleiotropy could be readily implemented to guide searching for overdominant alleles in available germplasm or engineering such alleles through genomic editing for crop improvement .

background interaction of integrin beta3 with c - src plays critical roles in cellular signaling which is heavily implicated in platelet adhesion and aggregation , as well as in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis or in osteoclastic bone resorption .
selectively blocking integrin alphaiibbeta3 outside - in signaling in platelets has been a focus of attention because of its effective antithrombotic potential together with a sufficient hemostatic capacity .
the myristoylated rgt peptide has been shown to achieve this blockade by targeting the association of c - src with the integrin beta3 tail , but the lack of key information regarding the mechanisms of action prevents this strategy from being further developed into practical antithrombotics .
therefore , in - depth knowledge of the precise mechanisms for rgt peptide in regulating platelet function is needed to establish the basis for a potential antithrombotic therapy by targeting c - src .
methods the reduction - sensitive peptides were applied to rule out the membrane anchorage after cytoplasmic delivery .
the c - src activity was assayed at living cell or at protein levels to assess the direct effect of rgt targeting on c - src .
thrombus formation under flow in the presence of cytoplasmic rgt peptide was observed by perfusing whole blood through the collagen - coated micro - chamber .
results the rgt peptide did not depend on the membrane anchorage to inhibit outside - in signaling in platelets .
the myr - ac ~ crgt peptide readily blocked agonist - induced c - src activation by disrupting the src / beta3 association and inhibited the rhoa activation and collagen - induced platelet aggregation in addition to the typical outside - in signaling events .
the myr - ac ~ crgt had no direct effect on the kinase activity of c - src in living cells as evidenced by its inability to dissociate csk from c - src or to alter the phosphorylation level of c - src y416 and y527 , consistent results were also from in vitro kinase assays .
under flow conditions , the myr - ac ~ crgt peptide caused an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation predominantly at high shear rates .
conclusions these findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the rgt peptide regulates integrin signaling and platelet function and reinforce the potential of the rgt peptide - induced disruption of src / beta3 association as a druggable target that would finally enable in vivo and clinical studies using the structure - based small molecular mimetics .

keywords antithrombotic agent blood platelets drug design integrin alphaiibbeta3 c - src issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background arterial thrombosis developing on the atherosclerotic lesions causes heart attack and stroke that are currently the most common cause of death .
platelets play central roles in hemostasis and in arterial thrombosis by forming thrombi [ 1 ] .
considerable efforts in developing antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs have been directed towards integrin alphaiibbeta3 since it is exclusively expressed in the platelet / megakaryocyte lineage and serves as a final common pathway of platelet aggregation in response to various agonists .
arterial thrombus formation is initiated by platelet adhering to the injured vessel wall at high shear rates via the interaction of glycoprotein ib ( gpib ) with von willebrand factor ( vwf ) [ 2 ] .
the adherent platelets need to be further activated primarily mediated by integrin alphaiibbeta3 so as to make firm association ( spreading ) and to recruit more platelets ( aggregation ) .
the alphaiibbeta3 activation is tightly regulated by inside - out signals initiated by various receptor / ligand interactions such as glycoprotein vi ( gpvi )/ collagen , p2y1 or p2y12 / adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and protease - activated receptor ( par )/ thrombin , etc .
the transduction of inside - out signals transforms the integrin alphaiibbeta3 receptor from low to high affinity that facilitates ligand ( fibrinogen ) binding and thus platelet aggregation [ 3 ] .
ligand binding to integrin alphaiibbeta3 triggers outside - in signaling that promotes platelet cytoskeletal reorganization leading to the firm association of platelets with the vessel wall or with each other .
integrin alphaiibbeta3 bidirectional signaling is primarily dependent on the complex and dynamic associations between the cytoplasmic proteins and the short cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta3 .
for instance , talin and kindlin bind to the beta3 nxxy motifs and play central roles in inside - out signaling [ 4 ] , and the association of c - src with the beta3 tail , the rgt residues in particular [ 5 , 6 ] , is obligatory for outside - in signaling [ 5 ] .
the conventional antagonists prevent ligand binding to alphaiibbeta3 receptor and thus actually inhibit the platelet functions regulated by both inside - out and outside - in signals .
genetically manipulated mouse models with an impaired integrin alphaiibbeta3 outside - in signaling [ 3 , 7 - 14 ] showed a significantly compromised potential of arterial thrombosis with a normal or only slightly prolonged bleeding time , indicating that selective inhibition of outside - in signaling may represent a rational antithrombotic strategy .
compared with the genetic manipulation , which seems currently impossible to be applied as a therapy , synthetic molecules with " drug - like " properties have the capability of being developed into drugs .
we have previously established that disruption of the src / beta3 interaction by the myristoylated rgt peptide selectively inhibited outside - in signaling [ 15 ] .
a recent study also showed that the myr - feeera peptide disrupted galpha13 / beta3 interaction , ultimately hampering c - src activation and thereby inhibiting outside - in signaling [ 16 ] .
these data , in light of the established mechanisms in which c - src is pivotal for outside - in signaling by interacting with beta3 [ 5 , 17 , 18 ] , suggest that the src / beta3 association may be a potential target for the development of antithrombotics that do not cause excessive bleeding .
the synthesized molecules , such as the rgt peptide , may thus serve as a paradigm for the conception of novel antithrombotic therapies even though the peptide itself may unlikely be directly applied as a drug .
the myristoylation modification renders the peptide membrane permeable but concomitantly integrates the peptide into the cell membrane that may enhance its ability to compete with beta3 for c - src [ 19 ] .
it thus became essential to define whether the rgt peptide relies on the membrane anchorage to exert its effects .
this important feature is a very basic prerequisite for designing further applications of the peptide or its analogues .
activated c - src is implicated in a wide range of cellular functions , and there is evidence that binding of some peptides to different domains of c - src has direct impacts on its kinase activity most likely because of the conformational regulations .
for example , nef binding to the src homology 3 ( sh3 ) domain or pyeei to src homology 2 ( sh2 ) [ 20 ] induced an increased activity of src - family kinases , as well as rgt peptide binding to sh3 domain of c - src primed the kinase [ 21 ] .
before moving towards the in vivo and clinical studies using the structure - based small molecular mimetics , the consequences of the rgt peptide , or its analogues , binding to c - src in the context of its kinase activity need to be carefully defined .
a vast body of experimental data , mostly in vivo , indicated that outside - in signaling was essential to stable platelet adhesion and aggregation [ 8 , 9 , 16 ] , and impaired stabilization of the developing thrombi under flow conditions might most likely be ascribable to the disruption of outside - in signaling [ 22 , 23 ] .
the rgt peptide has been reported to selectively inhibit outside - in signaling under static condition [ 15 ] , whether and if so , how it influences thrombus formation under flow condition is yet an important but unanswered question. by using reduction - sensitive peptides , the present study aimed to address whether the rgt peptide depends on membrane anchorage to influence src - regulated signaling and whether it alters the kinase activity of c - src .
in addition , the effect of selective blockade of outside - in signaling in human platelets by the rgt peptide on thrombus formation and growth under flow was tested .
these efforts allow evaluating the potential of the intracellular delivery of the rgt analogues for antithrombotic therapies where an effective inhibition on thrombosis is accomplished together with an adequate hemostasis .
results a thorough reduction of myr - ac ~ crgt peptide is achieved in platelet cytoplasm it has been established that myristoylated rgt peptide selectively inhibited integrin alphaiibbeta3 - mediated outside - in signaling [ 15 ] .
in order to define the underlying mechanisms with respect to membrane anchorage , a cell membrane - permeable and reduction - sensitive fluorescent peptide ( fig. 1a ) was employed in this work .
since the emission spectrum of fam overlaps the excitation spectrum of tamra , the physical proximity of fam to tamra is able to quench the green fluorescence of fam [ 24 ] .
platelets were incubated with the peptide and the fluorescence intensity of the tamra and fam in the platelets was measured , and both were found increased over time and reached a plateau phase at 60 min ( fig. 1b ) .
we noticed a proportional increase of two fluorescent signals indicating a disulfide bond cleavage upon entering the cytoplasm .
the ratio of fam to tamra fluorescence quantum was therefore measured and showed no significant difference at different incubation time ( fig. 1c ) suggesting a quick cleavage of the disulfide bond , which was attributed to a strong reductive potential in platelet cytosol similar to the effect of 0.3 m of beta - mercaptoethanol ( beta - me ) ( fig. 1d ) .
such a vigorous reduction of disulfide bond of the internalized peptide in platelet cytosol precludes a scenario in which the membrane - integrated myr - ac ~ crgt is able to retain its crgt moiety so as to associate with the membrane .
confocal microscopic results from platelets treated for 60 min also showed that both green fam and red tamra existed homogeneously in the cytoplasm ( fig. 1e ) , indicating a dynamic balance of the myristoylation moiety between staying membrane - bound and in cytoplasm as shown in previous reports [ 15 , 25 , 26 ]. fig. 1 membrane - permeable and reduction - sensitive peptide produced free crgt peptide upon entering platelet cytosol .
a schematic presentation shows that the reduction of disulfide bonds led to a separation of the fam fluorescence donor and the tamra fluorescence acceptor that dequenched the fluorescence of fam allowing detection by a spectrofluorometer .
b washed platelets were treated with the reduction - sensitive fluorescent peptide .
the fluorescence at 576 nm ( tamra ) and 519 nm ( fam ) increased over time .
c the ratio of fam / tamra fluorescence quantum was calculated and presented as the mean and sd of three independent experiments .
d comparison of the fam to tamra fluorescence ratio among peptide - treated platelets ( peptide + platelets ) , 0.3 m beta - me - treated peptide ( peptide + beta - me ) , or untreated peptide ( peptide ) .
the data were measured and presented as same as in panel c. e confocal analysis of the peptide - treated platelets were performed utilizing z - stack scanning with intervals of 1.2 mum ( from i to iv ) .
images are from a single experiment representative of three so performed , scale bar represents 2 mum activated c - src directly phosphorylates beta3 y747 and y759 independent of its binding to the rgt sequence of the beta3 tail the rgt sequence of the beta3 tail mediated a direct interaction with the sh3 domain of c - src that is critical for outside - in signaling [ 5 ] and the activated c - src phosphorylated the tyrosines of the integrin beta3 tail [ 27 ] that were confirmed by our current observations ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
we thus asked whether the kinase requires binding to the beta3 rgt sequence to achieve this phosphorylation action .
the mutated beta3 cytoplasmic peptides devoid of the rgt sequence ( fig. 2a ) were employed .
the mass spectrometry results ( fig. 2b ) and [ gamma - 32p ] adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) incorporation assays ( fig. 2c ) showed that the tyrosine residue ( s ) could be unequivocally phosphorylated .
this catalytic process was further confirmed in living chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells bearing tac - beta3 - deltargt chimeras and c - src y527f ( fig. 2d ) .
co - immunoprecipitation data demonstrated that the c - src y527f formed a complex with tac - beta3 but not with tac - beta3 - deltargt ( fig. 3a ) .
the cho cells expressing c - src y527f and tac - beta3 were treated with myr - ac ~ crgt peptide and results showed that the disruption of the c - src y527f interaction with beta3 by myr - ac ~ crgt ( fig. 3b ) did not attenuate the phosphorylation of the y747 ( fig. 3c ). fig. 2 the rgt sequence of the beta3 tail was not necessary for the direct phosphorylation of the beta3 y747 and y759 by active c - src .

the phosphorylation level of y747 residue in cho cells expressing tac - beta3 - deltargt or tac - beta3 together with activated c - src was similar , but stronger than in those expressing only tac - beta3 - deltargt or tac - beta3 fig. 3 disruption of the constitutive src - beta3 association did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta3 tail by active c - src .
a lysates of the cho cells expressing both tac - beta3 ( or tac - beta3 - deltargt ) and c - src y527f were immunoprecipitated with anti - flag antibody ( for c - src y527f ) and the immune complexes were subjected to sds - page and blotted with an anti - tac monoclonal antibody .
tac - beta3 but not tac - beta3 - deltargt was co - immunoprecipitated with c - src y527f .
b lysates of cho cells co - expressing tac - beta3 and c - src y527f pretreated with 250 mum of myr - ac ~ crgt were immunoprecipitated by an anti - flag antibody .
the association of src y527f with beta3 was disrupted by myr - ac ~ crgt peptide .
c lysates of cho cells co - expressing tac - beta3 ( or tac - beta3 - deltargt ) and c - src y527f pretreated with 250 mum of myr - ac ~ crgt were analyzed by western blot using anti - beta3 - py747 and anti - tac antibodies .
myr - ac ~ crgt did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta3 tail no matter whether it contains the rgt sequences .
actin served as a loading control myr - ac ~ crgt peptide per se does not directly alter the activity of c - src it is known that active c - src is implicated in a wide range of cellular functions and that nef binding to the sh3 domain or pyeei to sh2 [ 20 ] induces an increased activity of src - family kinases , as well as rgt peptide binding to sh3 domain of c - src primes the kinase [ 21 ] .
given that the rgt peptide competes with beta3 for c - src by binding to the sh3 domain , the consequences of rgt peptide binding to c - src with respect to its kinase activity need to be clarified .
platelets were incubated with different concentrations of myr - ac ~ crgt and assayed for c - src activity .
there was no difference of the c - src y416 and y527 phosphorylation level between myr - ac ~ crgt - treated and control samples ( fig. 4a ) .
co - immunoprecipitation with anti - beta3 antibody showed that myr - ac ~ crgt abolished the interaction of beta3 with c - src and remarkably inhibited that with csk ( fig. 4b and c ) , while data with anti - src antibody exhibited a strong disruption of interaction of src / beta3 but not that of src / csk by myr - ac ~ crgt ( fig. 4d and e ) .
we further examined the effect of crgt peptide on the activity of c - src with a src kinase assay kit .
in contrast to a significant inhibition caused by pp2 , crgt did not alter the kinase activity of c - src ( fig. 4f ). fig. 4 myr - ac ~ crgt peptide per se did not directly alter the activity of c - src .

the band intensity was quantified using the nih image j software .

integrin beta3 served as a loading control .
b effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on the interaction of integrin beta3 with c - src or csk .
the peptide - pretreated platelets were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti - beta3 antibody and then analyzed with anti - beta3 , anti - src , and anti - csk antibodies .

e densitometric presentations of the results in panel d. results are shown the mean and sd of three independent experiments .
f substrate peptide kvekigegtygvvyk was mixed with purified active c - src in the presence or absence of the crgt , cgrt peptides , or pp2 and then the [ gamma - 32p ] atp incorporation was measured .
data are shown as the mean and sd of three independent experiments myr - ac ~ crgt inhibits agonist - induced c - src activation and the phosphorylation of the beta3 cytoplasmic tyrosines via separating c - src from the beta3 tail free crgt in cytoplasm produced upon the internalization of myr - ac ~ crgt peptide is supposed to compete with beta3 for binding to c - src and prevent the kinase from being activated and participating in outside - in signaling .
indeed , myr - ac ~ crgt treatment resulted in a disassociation of c - src from beta3 both in platelets ( fig. 4b ) and cho cells ( fig. 3b ) .
data further show that in thrombin - stimulated platelets , myr - ac ~ crgt inhibited y416 phosphorylation or y527 dephosphorylation of c - src in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 5a ) .
in platelets , myr - ac ~ crgt ( 250 mum ) almost completely inhibited the thrombin - induced c - src activation ; thus , the phosphorylation of beta3 y747 and y759 residues was abolished ( fig. 5b ). fig. 5 myr - ac ~ crgt inhibited the phosphorylation of the integrin beta3 cytoplasmic tyrosines in thrombin - stimulated platelets .
a effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on c - src activity in platelets in response to thrombin stimulation .
after an incubation with myr - ac ~ crgt or myr - ac ~ cgrt , platelets were stimulated by thrombin then lysed and blotted with anti - src - py416 , anti - src - py527 , and anti - src antibodies .

b effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on thrombin - induced phosphorylation of the y747 and y759 of the beta3 cytoplasmic tail .
after an incubation with 250 mum of myr - ac ~ crgt or myr - ac ~ cgrt , platelets were stimulated by thrombin ( 0.05 u / ml ) with stirring , then were lysed in sds - page sample buffer and analyzed by western blot using anti - beta3 , anti - beta3 - py747 , anti - beta3 - py759 , or anti - beta - tubulin antibodies .
untreated platelets were used as a negative control , thrombin - stimulated platelets as a positive control , and beta - tubulin as a loading control myr - ac ~ crgt inhibits thrombus formation under high shear rates the establishment of the influence of myr - ac ~ crgt on platelet function under static conditions ( additional file 2 : figure s2 and additional file 3 : figure s3 ) motivated us to examine the contribution of selectively impaired outside - in signaling to platelet adhesion and aggregation under flow conditions .
the initial transient platelet adhesion and rolling under flow are mediated by the interaction of gpib with collagen - bound vwf [ 28 ] and integrin alpha2beta1 , or gpvi binding to collagen may also contribute to this platelet / subendothelium interaction [ 29 ] .
these events mediate platelet stable adhesion and irreversible aggregation primarily through integrin alphaiibbeta3 outside - in signaling [ 30 ] .
at a wall shear rate of 1500 s - 1 , myr - ac ~ crgt dose - dependently inhibited thrombus formation up to 250 mum ( additional file 4 : figure s4 ) .
then , the effect of 250 mum of myr - ac ~ crgt was further tested at different shear rates .
at high shear rate ( 5000 s - 1 or 1500 s - 1 ) , which respectively represented flow conditions in stenotic arteries and , or in arterioles or slightly stenotic arteries , thrombus formation in the presence of myr - ac ~ crgt was between that of dmso or alphaiibbeta3 antagonists where thrombus formation scarcely occurred ( fig. 6 ) .
similar to the published observations [ 31 , 32 ] , significantly few platelets adhered to the surfaces under lower shear rates even in dmso control .
at intermediate shear rate ( 500 s - 1 ) , mimicking medium - sized arteries , myr - ac ~ crgt showed no inhibitory effect in contrary to a substantial inhibition by 7e3 ( fig. 6 ) .
however , at low shear rate ( 125 s - 1 ) , which modeled the flow in venules , neither myr - ac ~ crgt nor 7e3 inhibited platelet adhesion ( fig. 6 ). fig. 6 effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on thrombus formation of human platelets at different shear rates .
calcein am - labeled whole blood was incubated with dmso , myr - ac ~ crgt ( 250 mum ) , or 7e3 prior to perfusion , and then perfused at different wall shear rates ( 5000 , 1500 , 500 , or 125 s - 1 ) for 4 min .
the thrombus formation was observed and imaged under an inverted fluorescent microscope .

** p > 0.05 ; * p < 0.01 discussion the antagonists target integrin alphaiibbeta3 receptor and inhibit thrombosis but compromise hemostasis as well .
targeting signaling pathways instead of receptors may reconcile this conflict .
it has been established that model animals with impaired outside - in signaling feature a reduced potential of thrombosis without excessive bleeding , and the strategy of blocking outside - in signaling has thus a definite advantage in designing new antithrombotic therapies .
the myr - rgt peptide is known to be capable of blocking outside - in signaling by targeting c - src and is considered as a synthetic molecule that is closest to be developed into drugs by virtue of structure - based analogues .
however , there are key issues to be addressed before proceeding with the studies .
a very primary issue is whether the inhibition of outside - in signaling by myr - rgt peptide depends on its membrane anchorage since a precise knowledge of the peptide action is definitely necessary for conceiving a structural analogue , i.e. membrane associable or not .
previous studies indicated that the regulatory effect of the myristoylated peptides on the cellular biological functions depends on its anchorage to cell membrane in some reports [ 33 , 34 ] whereas it seems not the case in others [ 25 , 26 ] .
glutathione is abundant in platelet cytoplasm at millimolar levels [ 35 ] , which are sufficient to exhaust the capacity of the disulfide bonds of myr - ac ~ crgt peptide at its working concentrations and confer an inability of the crgt peptide to associate with the myristoylation moiety , and thereby with the cell membrane .
in other words , the competition of the crgt peptide with the beta3 tail for c - src is unlikely attributed to the proximity of these molecules achieved by their membrane integration .
results showed that myr - ac ~ crgt peptide penetrated the cell membrane and yielded free crgt peptide in platelet cytoplasm ( fig. 1 ) .
this peptide did not disrupt the integrity of the cell membrane ( additional file 5 : figure s5 ) but did exert an inhibitory effect on platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen , clot retraction , irreversible aggregation , and p - selectin expression , without affecting soluble fibrinogen binding to alphaiibbeta3 and reversible aggregation ( additional file 2 : figure s2 and additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
in contrast to active c - src phosphorylating beta3 y747 and y759 independent of its binding to the rgt sequence of the beta3 tail in vitro ( fig. 2 ) , c - src in platelets is constitutively associated with beta3 in an inactive form , and is activated upon signaling through alphaiibbeta3 .
once c - src is dissociated by myr - ac ~ crgt from beta3 , it will not be activated through signaling and is thus unable to phosphorylate the beta3 tail .
indeed , myr - ac ~ crgt inhibited agonist - induced c - src activation ( fig. 5a ) and attenuated the phosphorylation of the y747 and y759 residues of beta3 in thrombin - stimulated platelets ( fig. 5b ) .
these data brought new information , in comparison with those from myr - rgt , that the cytoplasmic existence of free rgt peptide is sufficient to sequestrate c - src to an extent capable of separating it from beta3 ( figs. 3b and 4b ) .
this study further provides evidence that myr - ac ~ crgt treatment did not affect the level of c - src activation in platelets deposited on the immobilized fibrinogen ( additional file 2 : figure s2d ) , but did cause a downregulation of the platelet rhoa activation in clots ( additional file 2 : figure s2g ) as well as a substantial inhibition on collagen - induced platelet aggregation ( additional file 2 : figure s2h ) .
these results suggest that the rgt peptide regulated outside - in signaling by competing with beta3 for c - src not necessarily owing to its membrane association but , rather , through sequestrating c - src and further indicated that the membrane anchorage is thus not an issue of importance in conceiving " drug - like " molecules mimicking the active structure of rgt peptide .
in line with the previous reports , the present observations showed that active c - src directly phosphorylates beta3 y747 and y759 independent of its binding to the rgt sequence of the beta3 tail ( fig. 2 ) indicating that activated c - src may still be able to promote alphaiibbeta3 signaling even having been separated from the beta3 tail and in view of the fact that the free rgt peptide sequestrates c - src in cytoplasm and that some peptides binding to c - src has direct impact on its kinase activity [ 20 , 21 ] .
it became essential to clarify whether the rgt peptide binding is able to alter the enzymatic activity of c - src and accordingly to change the biological processes correlating with this multi - functional kinase .
our data show that the phosphorylation levels of y416 and y527 as well as the association of csk with c - src were not affected in platelets in the presence of free cytoplasmic crgt peptide ( fig. 4 ) .
in addition , in vitro assays for c - src activity , in which the phosphoryl transfer reaction occurs exclusively on the src substrate peptide since the crgt peptide contains no tyrosine residue , also revealed that the crgt peptide did not influence the potential of c - src to catalyze its substrates ( fig. 4f ) .
these results suggest that rgt peptide binding to c - src was unable to alter the c - src activity and the presence of the cytoplasmic crgt peptide caused primarily the dissociation of the src / beta3 interaction without a pronounced direct effect on c - src .
this feature for the rgt peptide argues in favor of the safety of its potential application in antithrombotic therapies .
thrombosis occurs in the blood stream , and the shear forces play significant roles throughout the process .
selective inhibition of outside - in signaling was achieved by rgt peptide in human platelets based on experiments in static conditions [ 15 ] .
we thus became interested in testing the effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on thrombus formation under flow conditions .
we chose collagen to coat the micro - chambers because it is the major component of the subendothelial matrices and has thus been recommended by the biorheology subcommittee of the ssc of the isth [ 36 ] .
platelet stable adhesion and irreversible aggregation regulated primarily through outside - in signaling [ 30 ] contribute to the thrombus growth under flow .
in a very recent publication [ 37 ] , stalker and colleagues proposed a model for hemostatic plug formation in which the plugs are comprised of distinct regions defined by the degree of platelet activation , packing density , and stability .
platelets in the " core " are characterized by contact - dependent signaling , p - selectin exposure with a greater packing density while those in the unstable " shell " are loosely packed and less activated most likely dependent on the p2y12 receptors .
similar features may also exist in platelets that have undergone bidirectional or inside - out signaling through integrin alphaiibbeta3 , respectively .
therefore , the rgt - treated platelets , in which only inside - out signals can be transduced , may still be able to form thrombi though less stable to resist the hydrodynamic drag forces .
indeed , at a shear rate of 125 s - 1 , neither myr - ac ~ crgt nor 7e3 affected the platelet adhesion , in line with the previous observations in which thrombasthenic platelets adhered normally to deendothelialized vessels at low shear rates [ 38 , 39 ] .
the inability of myr - ac ~ crgt to affect platelet adhesion and aggregation remained at the intermediate shear rates ( 500 s - 1 ) in contrast to an unequivocal inhibition induced by 7e3 ( fig. 6 ) .
at high shear rates ( 1500 and 5000 s - 1 ) myr - ac ~ crgt partially inhibited thrombus formation , as evidenced by the smaller and thinner thrombi and less thrombus coverage as well ( fig. 6 ) , whereas 7e3 could still vigorously inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to a drastic decrease of thrombus formation either in size or in coverage by showing only few platelets adhered on the surfaces .
this was the first application of human platelets with specifically impaired outside - in signaling in such an observation indicating that the src - regulated outside - in signaling played a pivotal role in inducing the firm linkage of platelets to the subendothelial matrices and to each other which renders the growing thrombi more resistant to the drag forces .
hemostasis usually occurs in small vessels such as arterioles , capillaries , and venules [ 40 ] where blood loss will end as long as small numbers of platelets accumulate at the sites of injury [ 37 ] .
the flow experimental data allow us to infer that in venules (< 500 s - 1 ) , myr - ac ~ crgt - treated platelets may adhere normally , while in arterioles and capillaries ( 1500 s - 1 or greater ) , the unaffected inside - out signaling may still enable these platelets to form thrombi to a size sufficient to seal the vessel damages in contrast to a much more profound inhibition of 7e3 [ 31 , 41 ] .
this unique effect of myr - ac ~ crgt on thrombus formation under flow may explain the consequences of the elimination of outside - in signaling in hemostatic potential manifested in genetically manipulated animals .
differently , pathological thrombosis takes place in stenotic medium - sized arteries with a luminal diameter exceeding 100 mum , usually in millimeters such as coronary or cerebral arteries .
coronary thrombosis model showed that shear rates reached as high as 84,000 s - 1 for a 65 % stenosis by diameter [ 42 ] .
occlusion of these arteries requires bigger and more stable thrombi formed under these conditions .
significantly smaller and thinner thrombi formed by myr - ac ~ crgt - treated platelets at high shear rates ( 1500 s - 1 and 5000 s - 1 ) ( fig. 6 ) indicate that the diminished platelet stable adhesion and irreversible aggregation impair the stabilization and growth of thrombi under higher flow and thus may prevent the complete occlusion of the stenotic medium - sized arteries in contrast to an adequate hemostatic situation that may be achieved in normal small vessels .
integrins are alphabeta heterodimers and the beta3 subunit forms alphaiibbeta3 and alphavbeta3 complexes ; the former is expressed exclusively in megakaryocyte / platelet lineage and the latter is however expressed by multiple cell types [ 43 ] .
integrin alphavbeta3 is also present in platelet , but only a few hundred copies in contrast to approximately 80,000 alphaiibbeta3 per platelet .
disruption of the src / beta3 interaction by the rgt peptide interferes with signal transduction through integrin alphaiibbeta3 in platelets and may also affect that through integrin alphavbeta3 in platelets and other cells such as melanoma cells or osteoclasts .
the influence of the rgt - containing peptide on platelet function may be contributed by the global action of the peptide on the platelet beta3 integrins while , as a commonly accepted concept , alphaiibbeta3 but not alphavbeta3 is crucial to platelet function owing to the overwhelming expression superiority .
it would also be interesting to look at the effect of blocking the src / beta3 interaction in integrin alphavbeta3 - expressing cells on tumorogenesis or bone resorption. that would be the goals for the future work .
conclusions the present study reveals novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which c - src regulates integrin alphaiibbeta3 signaling and provides first evidence in human platelets that the rgt peptide or its derivatives inhibit outside - in signaling by dissociating the src / beta3 interaction independent of membrane anchorage .
this work lays the foundation for an in vivo validation of the effect of rgt peptide by using membrane - permeable small molecules derived from structure - based design and allows us to anticipate that intercellular delivery of the rgt peptide analogues may have the potential to be developed into a novel antithrombotic strategy where only the src / beta3 interaction is specifically disrupted .

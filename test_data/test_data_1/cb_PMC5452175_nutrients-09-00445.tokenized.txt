choline dietary intake varies such that many people do not achieve adequate intakes .
diet intake of choline can modulate methylation because , via betaine homocysteine methyltransferase ( bhmt ) , this nutrient ( and its metabolite , betaine ) regulate the concentrations of s - adenosylhomocysteine and s - adenosylmethionine .
some of the epigenetic mechanisms that modify gene expression without modifying the genetic code depend on the methylation of dna or of histones ; and diet availability of choline and other methyl - group donors influences both of these methylations .
examples of methyl - donor mediated epigenetic effects include the changes in coat color and body weight in offspring when pregnant agouti mice are fed high choline , high methyl diets ; the changes in tail kinking in offspring when pregnant axin ( fu ) mice are fed high choline , high methyl diets ; the changes in cdkn3 methylation and altered brain development that occurs in offspring when pregnant rodents are fed low choline diets .
when choline metabolism is disrupted by deleting the gene bhmt , dna methylation is affected ( especially in a region of chromosome 13 ) , expression of specific genes is suppressed , and liver cancers develop .
better understanding of how nutrients such as choline and methyl - donors influence epigenetic programs has importance for our understanding of not only developmental abnormalities but also for understanding the origins of chronic diseases .
choline epigenetics dna methylation brain development liver cancer 1 .
introduction our genetic code is the same in almost every cell in our body , yet all tissues do not express every gene to the same extent .
for the most part , this difference between tissues occurs because there are epigenetic mechanisms that modify gene expression without modifying the genetic code [ 1,2,3 ] .
this is fortunate because it permits retuning of gene expression to achieve some degree of adaptation to the environment , including the nutrition environment .
the field of epigenetics is relatively new , and to date , epigenetic mechanisms involve covalent modifications to dna ( the addition of a methyl group to carbon five in cytosine [ 2 ] or the hydroxymethylation of carbon five in cytosine [ 4,5 ]) ; covalent modifications to histone proteins ( methylation [ 6,7 ] , acetylation [ 8 ] , biotinylation [ 9 ] of lysine in histone tails ) ; as well as gene expression / translation modification by micrornas and other noncoding rnas [ 10 ] and by nucleosome positioning / remodeling [ 11 ] .
genome - wide epigenetic status is established in early life with different cell types developing different epigenetic programs that are usually maintained throughout later life .
thus , gene expression retuning in early life can affect metabolism and organ function in later life .
2. nutrient - responsive epigenetic mechanisms there are " nutrient responsive " epigenetic mechanisms that change genes' expression , thereby modulating metabolic pathways [ 3,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 ] .
studies on dietary choline and other methyl - group donors provide some of the best examples of nutrient responsive epigenetic mechanisms .
dna and histone methylases are directly influenced by the availability of methyl - groups derived from diet ( from choline / betaine , methyl - folate or methionine ) because these are the precursors that are converted to the universal methyl - donor s - adenosylmethionine [ 24,25,26,27,28 ] , needed for the methylation of cytosine in dna or lysine in histones ( epigenetic marks ). that diet could modify dna cytosine methylation was appreciated more than 40 years ago when it was observed that feeding rats a diet very low in choline and methionine resulted in the decreased methylation of cytosines in dna of liver [ 29 ] which was correlated with changes in the expression of a variety of hepatic genes [ 30 ] and was linked to the spontaneous development of liver cancers on this diet [ 29,31,32 ] .
later , methylation indicator - mouse models were developed in which changes in dna methylation during in utero development resulted in easily visible and stable phenotypes in mouse offspring .
the mouse agouti gene regulates body weight , risk for diabetes and also the production of black or yellow pigment in hair .
the agouti wildtype a mouse has a brown coat and is lean and not diabetic ; the agouti mutant avy has a solid yellow coat and a marked prevalence of obesity and diabetes but this phenotype can vary considerably from one mouse carrying this mutation to another , even among siblings of a single litter , because the expression of the agouti gene is epigenetically regulated [ 18 ] .
feeding pregnant avy / a mice a diet high in choline , methionine , betaine , vitamin b12 and folic acid resulted in more offspring born that were brown and thin rather than possessing the normal yellow and fat phenotype for the avy / a mouse .
these phenotypes were predicted by the methylation status of avy ( methylation of cytosines in the avy gene acts to suppress gene expression ) [ 18,33,34 ] .
there was a critical period in early life during which the epigenetic marks were formed ( in this case , the period before birth ) , and after this time , restoration of a control diet did not reverse them .
mice with a different methylation indicator - gene ( axin ( fu )) develop kinks in their tails .
when pregnant axin ( fu ) mice were fed diets high in choline , methionine , betaine and vitamin b12 , cytosines in the gene axin ( fu ) were hypermethylated , gene expression was suppressed and offspring had tails with fewer kinks [ 16 ] .
again , there was a critical in utero time - window during which the epigenetic marks were established [ 16 ] .
other examples of choline - methyl diet modification of epigenetics include the following : insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf2 ) , which is an important growth - stimulating factor and metabolic regulator ; and the expression of igf2 , which is negatively regulated by a long noncoding rna made by the h19 gene [ 35,36,37,38 ] .
h19 expression , in turn , is regulated by the methylation of a region shared by both genes called igf2dmr2 .
when pregnant rats were fed choline - deficient diets , igf2dmr2 in fetal liver was hypermethylated , h19 was inhibited and igf2 expression increased [ 39 ] .
in people , maternal choline intake modulated epigenetic marks in the placenta ; women with higher intake of choline had higher placental promoter methylation in the corticotrophin releasing hormone ( crh ) and glucocorticoid receptor ( nr3c1 ) genes and this was associated with lower placental expression of the corticotrophin - releasing hormone [ 40 ] .
though much of the epigenome is established during early life , some epigenetic marks are modifiable in later life .
for example , methylation levels of specific cpg sites from srebf2 , agpat3 , esr1 and fasn promoter regions in liver were changed when rats were fed a high choline ( high methyl ) diet , and these effects were gender dependent [ 41,42 ] .
why some epigenetic marks are fixed in early life and others are plastic is not understood .
3. choline , epigenetics and fetal development the dietary choline - mediated effects on epigenetic marks are not limited to the genes discussed above ; feeding pregnant mice a diet low in choline decreased cytosine methylation in the gene cyclin dependent kinase 3 ( cdkn3 ) , resulting in increased expression of this gene that inhibits cell cycling [ 43 ] .
these diet - mediated epigenetic changes in cdkn3 were associated with decreased proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the fetal brain [ 43,44 ] .
this is especially interesting because maternal dietary choline is essential for normal brain development .
there is extra demand for choline during pregnancy and this increases the choline requirements of the mother and often exceeds the capacity for endogenous production of choline ( in the form of phosphatidylcholine ) in the liver [ 45 ] .
estrogen can induce the gene pemt encoding the enzyme catalyzing the production of phosphatidylcholine in liver , and this means that young women are somewhat less dependent on dietary intake of choline than are men [ 46,47 ] .
unfortunately , almost half of women have a gene variant that blocks estrogen - induction of the capacity to make their own choline [ 46,47 ] ; these women may be especially sensitive to dietary choline variations during pregnancy .
the placenta and mammary gland deliver large amounts of choline from mother to the fetus and infant , respectively [ 48,49 ] .
this results in plasma and tissue choline concentrations that are much higher in the fetus and young infant than they are in adults [ 50,51 ] .
maternal supply of choline to the fetus and infant is important for brain development .
in rodents , decreased supply of choline during a critical window of brain development ( in the rodent , days 11 - 17 of gestation ) results in decreased neurogenesis in the brain cortex [ 52 ] and hippocampus [ 44,53 ] .
lower maternal choline intake results in smaller fetal brains , with markedly diminished numbers of fetal progenitor cells in the germinal layers of both the cortex and hippocampus [ 52 ] .
also , with lower maternal choline intake , there is a loss of the normal layering of the developing fetal cortex because neural progenitor cells differentiate too early , forming layer 6 of the cortex , and leave too few remaining progenitors to form the five other later - born layers of the brain [ 52 ] .
these six different layers connect to different neural pathways in the brain , and when they are not formed properly , these pathways are disrupted .
one mechanism for this effect of choline is mediated by changes in the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) signaling ( required for normal timing of differentiation ) in the developing cortex .
low choline availability to the fetal brain results in decreased production of the receptor for egf [ 52 ] .
similarly , low maternal choline intake results in premature differentiation of neural progenitors in the fetal hippocampus [ 54,55,56,57 ] .
this area of the brain is important for memory function .
if pregnant rats are fed a diet supplemented with choline , their offspring perform better in tests of visuospatial and auditory memory [ 58,59,60 ] and this improvement lasts for their lifetime .
conversely , when pregnant rats are fed diets low in choline , their offspring have worse visuospatial and auditory memory [ 61 ] .
babies born from women who eat more choline during pregnancy perform better at 7 years of age in visuospatial memory testing [ 62 ] , suggesting that the effects of choline in rodents may also apply to people .
however , one observational study [ 63 ] reported that there was no association between cord blood choline concentrations and scores on standard intelligence tests in 5 year olds .
in addition to influencing brain neurogenesis , fetuses from pregnant mice fed a low choline diet have fewer small blood vessels in their hippocampi when compared to fetuses from mothers fed a normal or high choline diet [ 64 ] .
endothelial progenitor cells in brains of the low choline group , responding to increased expression of vegfc and angpt2 , differentiate prematurely and stop dividing , with resulting reductions in blood vessel formation [ 64 ] .
the increased expression of vegfc and angpt2 is associated with the decreased methylation of cytosines within these two genes [ 64 ] .
thus , choline has an important role in regulating the development of the brain , and epigenetic mechanisms that likely contribute to the underlying pathways for these effects .
4. choline , epigenetics and liver cancer in addition to its role in brain development , choline and other methyl - donors also have a role in carcinogenesis .
rodents fed low choline , low methyl diets develop liver cancers [ 65,66,67,68 ] .
a meta - analysis of 11 studies in people calculated that diets low in choline increased the overall relative risk for developing cancer [ 69 ] with the largest reported effects found for lung ( 30 % increase ; also see [ 70 ]) , nasopharyngeal ( 58 % increase ; also see [ 70 ]) and breast cancer ( 60 % increase ; also see [ 71 ]) .
an increment in diet intake of 100 mg / day of choline and betaine ( a metabolite derived from choline ) helped reduce cancer incidence by 11 % [ 69 ] .
it is possible that these effects of choline are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms [ 72 ] .
choline - methyl - deficient diets result in decreased hepatic concentrations of s - adenosylmethionine , and increased concentrations of s - adenosylhomocysteine in the livers of male rats and mice [ 73 ] .
low s - adenosylmethionine combined with high s - adenosylhomocysteine concentrations act to inhibit methyltransferases' activity [ 74 ] .
s - adenosylhomocysteine has high affinity for dna methyltransferases ( dnmts ) and competes for binding of s - adenosylmethionine , thereby inhibiting dnmt enzymatic activity [ 75 ] .
choline - methyl - deficient diets result in decreased dna methylation [ 72,30 ] at many sites including the oncogene c - myc [ 76 ] , but also in increased methylation at other cytosines ( including the hypermethylation of several tumor - suppressor genes such as p53 , p16ink4a , ptpro , cdh1 , and cx26 ) [ 72,77,78,79 ] .
histone methylation is also affected by methyl - deficient diets .
feeding a choline - methyl - deficient diet results in decreased hepatic histone h3 lysine 9 trimethylation ( h3k9me3 ) and histone h4 lysine 20 trimethylation ( h4k20me3 ) [ 72 ] .
in addition , several histone methyltransferases are down - regulated ( suv39h1 , prdm2 / riz1 , and suv420h2 ) [ 72 ] .
finally , down - regulation of micrornas ( mir - 122 and mir - 29 ) , and up - regulation of mir - 34a , mir - 155 , and mir - 221 occur in methyl - deficient liver [ 72 ] .
these micrornas act to modify the expression and translation of specific gene products .
when a key gene ( bhmt ; betaine homocysteine methyltransferase ) in choline metabolism is deleted in mice , these mice develop hepatocarcinomas [ 80 ] .
the betaine - dependent methylation of homocysteine ( by bhmt ) is important for maintaining concentrations of s - adenosylmethionine , and for removing s - adenosylhomocysteine in liver and for maintaining normal patterns of dna methylation [ 80 ] .
deleting bhmt causes mostly loss of methylation at 63 differentially methylated cytosines. of these , 33 ( mostly hypomethylated ) are located in one locus spanning 15.5 mb on chromosome 13 ( from 93.5 to 109 mb ( mm9 ) , which includes the bhmt gene located at chr13 : 94,386,846 - 94,407,713 ) [ 80 ] .
it is possible that the sensitivity to dna methylation perturbations that we observe in chromosome 13 is a regulatory mechanism meant to sense methyl - metabolism , as not only bhmt but other 1 - carbon metabolism genes are located there : dimethylglycine dehydrogenase ( dmgdh ) at chr.13 : 94,444,391 , methionine synthase reductase ( mtrr ) at chr.13 : 68,699,657 and 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate - homocysteine methyltransferase ( mtr ; also in chromosome 13 but outside the locus at chr.13 : 12,279,086 ) [ 80 ] .
the altered dna methylome in bhmt - null mice is associated with changes in gene expression in liver ; of 18 differentially expressed genes , five are located on chromosome 13 , with four out of the five falling within the chromosome 13 hypomethylated block : arsb , f2rl2 , iqgap2 , and enc1 [ 80 ] .
iqgap2 belongs to a family of scaffolding proteins , which mediate rho gtpase and ca2 +/ calmodulin signaling in regulating multiple cellular processes , such as cell adhesion , motility , and exocytosis [ 81 ] ; iqgap2 - null mice develop spontaneous hepatocellular carcinomas [ 82 ] .
f2rl2 is a member of the protease - activated receptor - 3 ( par - 3 ) family and is involved in homeostasis , adhesion , proliferation , and migration [ 83,84 ] ; f2rl2 binds to signal transduction proteins and transcription factors involved in carcinogenesis [ 85,86 ] .
thus , choline and methyl metabolism has an important role in regulating carcinogenesis , and epigenetic mechanisms likely contribute to the underlying pathways for these effects .
5. choline intake is marginal in many people choline is a required nutrient and in 1998 , an adequate intake ( ai ) and a tolerable upper limit ( ul ) for choline was established [ 87 ] .
in 2016 , the us food and drug administration ( fda ) set a recommended daily intake ( rdi ) for choline based on the ais as part of the new nutrition facts label for packaged foods ( published in the federal register on may 27 , 2016 ; fda - 2012 - n - 1210 - 0875 , federal register number : 2016 - 11867 ) .
the us ai / rdi varies by age and gender , but is 550 mg / day in adult men and 425 mg / day in adult women ( 450 mg / day in pregnant and 550 mg / day lactating women ) .
the european food safety authority recently established slightly different recommendations for adequate intake levels for choline ( european food safety authority , parma , italy , 17 august 2016 ) .
the us department of agriculture maintains a database of the choline content of foods ( https :// www.ars.usda.gov / northeast - area / beltsville - md / beltsville - human - nutrition - research - center / nutrient - data - laboratory / docs / usda - database - for - the - choline - content - of - common - foods - release - 2 - 2008 /) ; foods such as eggs and meats contain more choline than do most plant sources .
there is a wide variation in choline intake in the diet ; the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes 2009 - 2012 ) reports that only 11 % of adult americans achieve the adequate intake level of choline , with mean intake being 300 mg / day ( 10 % ile being 200 mg / day ; 90 % ile being 500 mg / day ) [ 88 ] .
similar ranges of intake were reported in the framingham offspring study [ 89 ] , the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [ 90,91 ] and the nurse 's health study [ 92 ] .
intake of choline is even lower in low - income countries such as jamaica and the gambia [ 93,94 ] .
6. conclusions choline is an essential nutrient with functional relevance in a wide array of biological pathways including epigenetic modulation of gene expression .
timing of nutrient availability is important in determining epigenetic outcomes ; changes in availability during early life potentially having a greater effect than changes occurring later in life .
the developmental origins of health and disease ( dohad ) hypothesis [ 95 ] is that diet in early life influences developmental plasticity and alters susceptibility to adult cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes , obesity [ 96 ] , neuropsychiatric diseases [ 97 ] , immune / inflammatory diseases [ 98 ] and cancer [ 99 ] .
epigenetic mechanisms are likely a major mechanism of dohad [ 100 ] .
thus , better understanding of how nutrients such as choline and methyl - donors influence epigenetic programs has importance for our understanding of not only developmental abnormalities but also for understanding the origins of chronic diseases .

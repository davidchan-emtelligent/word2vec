chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis ( crmo ) is the most severe form of cno .
it is characterized by recurring episodes of bone inflammation that can last for years and may cause chronic pain , pathological fractures , and disability .
despite recent advances in targeting disease mechanisms , the exact pathophysiology of cno / crmo remains unknown .
diagnosis of cno can be challenging , because symptoms tend to be mild and highly variable , and is further complicated by the absence of widely accepted diagnostic criteria and disease biomarkers .
objectives the aim of our study was to determine serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of crmo , discriminating crmo patients from healthy individuals and patients with other inflammatory conditions ( crohn 's disease and jia ) .
methods serum of treatment - naive crmo patients was collected at the time of diagnosis ( n = 56 ) .
as controls , sera from treatment - naive age matched patients with crohn 's disease ( n = 62 ) or jia ( n = 27 ) , as well as healthy individuals ( n = 62 ) were collected .
sera were subjected to proteomic analysis , using the human cytokine 25 - plex assay ( life technologies ) on the luminex ( r ) 200 ( tm ) platform .
standard inflammation markers from our routine clinical chemistry laboratory ( crp ) were included in our analysis .
statistical analysis was performed using non - parametric kruskal - wallis tests , mann - whitney - u tests , and canonical discriminant analysis to test between disease and control groups .
results the following ( 9 out of 25 ) serum proteins were detectable and significantly differed between groups : il - 1ra , il - 2r , il - 6 , il - 12 , eotaxin , mcp - 1 , mig , mip - 1b , rantes .
kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney u tests confirmed significant differences between three groups : crmo , crohn 's disease , and healthy controls .
biosamples from crmo and jia patients were less clearly distinguishable .
multi - component canonical discriminant analysis allowed for the definition of algorithms differentiating between crmo , crohn 's disease , and healthy controls .
we failed to differentiate sera from patients with jia from crmo samples .
however , jia and crmo can usually be differentiated by their clinical presentation .
conclusion our serum marker based discrimination algorithm can discriminate crmo patients from patients with crohn 's disease and healthy individuals .
though confirmation of our findings in larger , multi - ethnical cohorts is currently lacking , in a clinical setting this may prove useful and valuable to differentiate between individuals with " bone pain " and crmo .

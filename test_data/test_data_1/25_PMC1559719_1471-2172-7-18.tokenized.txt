background deer mice ( peromyscus maniculatus ) are the most common mammals in north america and are reservoirs for several zoonotic agents , including sin nombre virus ( snv ) , the principal etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( hcps ) in north america .
unlike human hcps patients , snv - infected deer mice show no overt pathological symptoms , despite the presence of virus in the lungs .
a neutralizing igg antibody response occurs , but the virus establishes a persistent infection .
limitations of detailed analysis of deer mouse immune responses to snv are the lack of reagents and methods for evaluating such responses .
results we developed real - time pcr - based detection assays for several immune - related transcription factor and cytokine genes from deer mice that permit the profiling of cd4 + helper t cells , including markers of th1 cells ( t - bet , stat4 , ifngamma , tnf , lt ) , th2 cells ( gata - 3 , stat6 , il - 4 , il - 5 ) and regulatory t cells ( fox - p3 , il - 10 , tgfbeta1 ) .
these assays compare the expression of in vitro antigen - stimulated and unstimulated t cells from individual deer mice .
conclusion we developed molecular methods for profiling immune gene expression in deer mice , including a multiplexed real - time pcr assay for assessing expression of several cytokine and transcription factor genes .
these assays should be useful for characterizing the immune responses of experimentally - and naturally - infected deer mice .
background deer mice ( peromyscus maniculatus ) are the principal hosts of sin nombre virus ( snv ) , which causes the great majority of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( hcps ) cases in north america [ 1 - 3 ] .
despite a neutralizing antibody response , deer mice become persistently - infected with snv without discernible pathology and can shed virus in excrement [ 4 - 6 ] .
the mechanism by which snv evades a sterilizing immune response in deer mice is unknown .
snv principally infects capillary endothelial cells in humans and deer mice without conspicuous cytopathic effects [ 4,7 ] .
immunochemical evaluation of lung tissues from humans and deer mice reveals the presence of viral antigens ; however , no pulmonary inflammation is observed in deer mouse lungs .
in addition , hcps patients , but not deer mice , have mononuclear infiltrates in their lungs .
these cells produce several proinflammatory cytokines , including il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 4 , ifngamma , tnf and lymphotoxin - alpha ( lt ) [ 8 - 10 ] .
isolation of snv - specific human t cells suggests th1 - and tc1 - mediated immune responses in such patients .
because of the absence of cytopathology , it is thought that the etiologic mechanism of hcps is principally a cytokine - mediated immunopathology .
deer mice are divergent from the common laboratory house mouse ( mus musculus ) and rat ( rattus norvegicus ) by 25 million years [ 11 ] .
this substantial divergence has led to variations that render most immunological reagents for these species inadequate for evaluating deer mouse immune responses [ 12 ] .
because of this , methods for profiling t cell gene expression and for evaluating cytokine responses in deer mice must be developed in order to assess such responses during the course of infection with snv .
conventional antibody - based methods for quantitative cytokine detection rely upon the generation of pairs of monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes for use in capture elisas .
these assays usually require the cloning of full - length cdnas for each cytokine , expression and production of recombinant cytokines , and production of monoclonal antibodies .
this process requires substantial effort , expertise and expense .
the development of real - time pcr methods to detect gene expression has resulted in the rapid development of many gene expression assays .
one such method for detecting cytokines from unusual species employs the dna - intercalating dye sybr green i [ 13 - 16 ] , which fluoresces when bound to double - stranded dna .
in addition , these assays are readily multiplexed from small quantities of cdna .
unlike the production of monoclonal antibodies , the development of real - time pcr assays to detect gene expression requires only partial cdna sequence data , and we recently cloned many such deer mouse sequences [ 17 - 19 ] .
using these sequences , we have developed real - time pcr assays that may useful for evaluating t cell subset responses in deer mice , including th1 , th2 and regulatory t ( treg ) cells [ 20 - 29 ] .
in addition , we have developed conventional pcr detection assays for the expression of the subset - specific transcription factors , t - bet , gata - 3 , fox - p3 , stat4 , and stat6 .
together , these assays may allow the discrimination of helper t cell subsets in deer mice .
results generation of klh - specific t cell lines we previously described methods for long - term culture of outbred deer mouse t cell lines using autologous bone marrow - derived antigen presenting cells [ 30 ] .
our current efforts describe a quantitative means of determining transcription factor and cytokine gene expression in such t cell lines using pcr .
polyclonal lymph node - derived cd4 + t cell lines from two deer mice , dm21 and dm22 , were established and evaluated for their proliferative capacity upon recall challenge with antigen .
the lines' proliferative characteristics were similar to our previous results , with half - maximal proliferation at about 1 mug / ml of klh [ 30 ] .
detection of transcription factor gene expression we developed multiplex a real - time pcr detection assay for th1 , th2 and treg transcription factors and cytokines based upon the use of sybr green i dna - binding fluorochrome .
this assay determines the relative change in gene expression by comparing identical t cell / apc cultures with or without antigen exposure after 42 hours .
this approach allowed us to determine the relative template abundance ( rta ) induced in t cells that are activated by antigen .
based upon the half - maximal proliferative capacity , bulk cultures of t cells and autologous apc were established with or without 1 mug / ml of klh and incubated for 42 hours to allow antigen processing and presentation to t cells .
total rna was extracted for assessment of transcription factor gene expression by real - time pcr of cdna ( figure 2 ) .
concanavalin a - activated deer mouse splenocytes served as a control .
we detected the expression of each gene using real - time pcr .
we obtained adjusted cycle threshold ( ct ) means of triplicate samples by subtracting the instrument - determined ct values from our total cycle number of 50 for klh - stimulated and unstimulated t cell lines ( figure 2a ) .
the ratio of expression of klh - stimulated and unstimulated cultures was then calculated to determine the rta for each t cell line ( figure 2b ) .
figure 1 proliferation of klh - specific deer mouse t cells .
deer mice were immunized with klh and t cell lines were established from draining lymph nodes .
t cells , autologous bone marrow - derived apc and klh were cultured for 72 hours and proliferation was determined by mts assay .
each point represents the mean of duplicate samples with error bars representing the standard deviation .
figure 2 real - time pcr detection of deer mouse transcription factors .
total rna was extracted from 42 hour cultures of t cells with or without klh activation and used for cdna synthesis .
real - time pcr was performed using primers described in table 1 to detect the expression of transcription factors associated with th1 , th2 or treg t cells .
the mean ct values and standard deviations from triplicate samples obtained from the instrument were subtracted from the number of cycles performed ( 50 ) to determine adjusted ct means for unstimulated ( - k ) and stimulated ( klh ) t cell cultures ( a ) .
the adjusted ct mean values were then used to calculated the cycle difference ( cd ) by subtracting the - k value from the klh value .
the relative template abundance ( rta ) was then determined by calculating the log2 value of the cd ( 2cd ) ( b ) .
both t cell lines constitutively expressed th2 - specific gata3 at low to moderate levels ; however , substantial increase in antigen - induced expression occurred only with the dm22 line .
stat6 was abundantly expressed by both lines with increased expression in the presence of antigen .
th1 - specific t - bet was expressed at low levels in dm21 , but at high levels in dm22 .
its expression was dramatically increased in dm22 t cells cultured with klh .
dm21 did not express the th1 transcription factor stat4 , while dm22 expressed it in both antigen - stimulated and unstimulated cells .
both lines expressed the th2 transcription factor stat6 .
treg - specific fox - p3 was not detected in either line , although it was expressed at very low levels by activated splenocytes .
detection of cytokine gene expression antigen activation of the dm21 t cell line resulted in abundant expression levels of ifngamma and il - 10 , as well as moderate levels of tnf and tgfbeta1 , but there was little change in expression of lt or il - 5 ( figure 3 ) .
il - 4 expression was not detected in these cells .
the dm21 line expressed abundant ifngamma , il - 5 and il - 10 , moderate levels of tnf , but little tgfbeta1 , lt or il - 4 .

discussion deer mice and related peromyscine species are important reservoirs for snv and other human pathogens [ 31 - 39 ] .
although syrian golden hamsters can be experimentally - infected with snv [ 40 ] , only humans , deer mice and , occasionally , other rodents are known to be naturally susceptible to snv , with dramatically different outcomes .
spillover to related rodent species does occur , such as in pinyon mice ( p. truei ) [ 41 ] but such transmission does not appear to be an important mode of snv maintenance .
the species - specificity and apathogenic infection of hantaviruses for their rodent hosts are well - documented [ 3,4 ] , but poorly understood .
it is evident that such relationships have evolved over millions of years of coadaptation , as the rodents and their hantaviruses have undergone radial divergence .
many viruses evade sterilizing immune responses with virally - encoded proteins that modulate the host response in a manner favorable to the virus .
these viruses typically have many genes ; however , hantaviruses are relatively simple , encoding four polypeptides , none of which have been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities .
given that deer mice produce high - affinity neutralizing igg to snv [ 4,5,34,42 ] an adaptive t cell response must occur during infection , since these events ( affinity maturation and class switching ) are mediated by helper t cells and their cytokines .
few reagents for laboratory mouse immune markers and cytokines are cross - reactive with deer mouse proteins ([ 12 ] and unpublished observations ) , thus it has become necessary to develop novel tools for examining t cell responses in deer mice .
we previously generated sequence data for many deer mouse immune - function genes [ 17,19 ] and present here their utility for assessing responses of antigen - specific helper t cells .
several functional helper t cell subsets in the laboratory mouse have been characterized based on the expression of clone - specific transcription factors and cytokines [ 20,24 - 29 ] .
th1 cells that promote inflammation express the transcription factors stat4 and t - bet , and the cytokines ifngamma , tnf and lt .
th2 cells , which augment antibody synthesis , express stat6 and gata3 , and il - 4 and il - 5 .
treg cells are apparently a heterogeneous group of potent anti - inflammatory cells that exhibit differential expression of the transcription factor fox - p3 and the cytokines tgfbeta1 and il - 10 .
a fourth subset , th17 cells , has recently been described that expresses the proinflammatory cytokine il - 17 during some autoimmune diseases [ 43 - 45 ] , but has not been associated with infectious diseases .
we sought to develop assays that would allow us to discriminate these subpopulations in the deer mouse .
although we have cloned a partial cdna of deer mouse il - 17 ( ay426970 ) it has insufficient sequence information for design of suitable real - time pcr primers .
thus , we focused on the discrimination of th1 , th2 and treg cells and our results demonstrate that we are able to detect the expression of these cytokine and transcription factor genes by real - time pcr .
we detected the expression of these genes from deer mouse cells , but we were unable to discriminate discrete subpopulations that correlate with those of the house mouse .
because the t cell lines are polyclonal , there may be distinct th1 , th2 and treg clones in the cultures that express the hallmark cytokines .
alternatively , the distinct characteristics used for identifying these t cells in highly inbred laboratory mice may not apply to outbred deer mice .
additional work will be required to clone deer mouse t cells in order for such characterizations to be made .
an important caveat of all gene expression assays is that some genes are translationally regulated , thus data from such assays must be evaluated with caution .
it would be ideal if the presence or absence of cytokines could be determined using protein - detection assays , such as capture elisas .
no such assays are available for the deer mouse model , so gene expression assays currently are the only option .
nonetheless , differential expression of cytokine transcripts in antigen - stimulated versus unstimulated cells is suggestive of cytokine production and secretion .
considering the relative ease of cloning genes and developing real - time pcr assays , additional genes can be cloned and used to further characterize deer mouse immune responses , thus clarifying how rodent reservoirs and hantaviruses have evolved an immunological detente .
this may also provide clues as to how other viruses persist in their reservoirs .
the availability of these assays will permit the characterization of immune responses in deer mice acutely or persistently infected with snv or with other zoonotic agents .
considering that hcps is , at least in part , caused by a cytokine - mediated immunopathologic process , understanding how deer mice remain infected with snv without attendant pathology may suggest potential targets of therapeutic intervention for hcps patients .
conclusion we developed detection assays to assess helper t cell functions in the deer mouse .
these assays will provide tools to allow extensive characterization of nonpathogenic immune responses occurring in snv - infected deer mice and provide a rationale for studies of other host - pathogen interactions .
such characterizations may clarify the role of the pathological immune response in patients with hantavirus infections and aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets of intervention .
methods deer mice all methods were approved by the unc institutional animal care and use committee and were conducted in accordance with the animal welfare act .
fifteen week - old deer mice were immunized subcutaneously with klh emulsified in complete freund 's adjuvant as previously described [ 30 ] .
after 10 days , deer mice were euthanized and inguinal lymph nodes , spleens and bone marrow were harvested .
cloning of transcription factor cdnas primers from highly conserved regions of orthologous t - bet , gata - 3 , fox - p3 , stat4 and stat6 cdna sequences were used to amplify deer mouse genes using the pcr core kit with its q - solution ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) .
amplified products were cloned into the pgem - t easy vector ( promega , madison , wi ) and transformed into novablue cells ( novagen , madison , wi ) .
plasmids were purified ( qiagen mini - prep kit ) and sequenced ( big - dye sequencing kit , applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
blast was conducted to verify gene identity .
t cell culture t cells were produced and maintained as previously described [ 30 ] .
spleens from immunized deer mice were made into single - celled suspensions , aliquotted ( 106 / 0.5 ml / vial ) in 5 % deer mouse medium ( dmm ; rpmi - 1640 , 315 mosm , 50 mum beta - mercaptoethanol ) in 10 % dmso and stored at - 70degreesc .
bone marrow cells were washed in 5 % fbs - dmm , aliquotted ( 5 x 105 / 0.25 ml / vial ) and stored at - 70degreesc .
lymph node cells were cultured with 20 mug / ml of klh in 48 well plates for 4 days , then restimulated in 48 well plates with fresh klh and 106 freshly - thawed and once washed autologous splenocytes .
the cultures were fed at 2 - day intervals by replacement with 5 % fbs - dmm containing 10 ng / ml recombinant human il - 2 ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn ) .
cells were split 1:2 as wells approached confluence .
after two weeks of restimulation , t cells were collected and washed , then cultured with fresh klh and bone marrow - derived antigen presenting cells ( apc ; see below ) for continued in vitro adaptation and expansion .
the cells expressed cd4 mrna ( genbank dq836358 ) by reverse transcription pcr using introns - spanning primers ( forward , 5 ' - gcttgcggagttttccttcc - 3 ' ; reverse , 5 ' - cacagcgttgtctttctgagcc - 3 ') .
generation of bone marrow - derived apc one vial of bone marrow cells from each deer mouse was quick - thawed and plated onto 35 mm bacterial petri dishes and cultured in a final volume of 3 ml of apc medium ( 10 % fbs - dmm supplemented with 10 ng / ml recombinant mouse gm - csf , r & d systems ) .
at 2 or 3 day intervals , half of the medium was removed and replaced with fresh apc medium for 10 to 14 days , at which time large numbers of competent apcs were generated for use in t cell stimulation experiments .
t cell proliferation assay klh , 2 x 105 t cells and 104 bm - apc were cultured in 5 % fbs - dmm in 96 - well plates for 72 hours under 7 % co2 , then proliferation assessed by mts assay ( celltiter - 96 aq , promega , madison , wi ) .
means and standard deviations were calculated from duplicate samples with the - k ( no klh ) subtracted from each mean .
real - time pcr for antigen recall experiments , 1 mug / ml klh , 5 x 105 t cells and 5 x 104 bm - apc were cultured as above in 48 well plates for 42 hours , then total rna was extracted ( versagene rna cell kit , gentra systems , minneapolis , mn ) .
messenger rna was reverse - transcribed ( iscript , bio - rad , hercules , ca ) and used as template cdna .
primers ( table 1 ) were designed according to peinnequin et al .
[ 15 ] using macvector software .
real - time pcr was performed in triplicate in 25 mul volumes using iq sybr green kit ( bio - rad ) for 50 cycles with a myiq real - time thermal cycler ( bio - rad ) with 95degreesc melting ( 30 sec ) , 58degreesc annealing ( 30 sec ) , and 72degreesc extension ( 30 sec ) .
melt curve analysis was conducted to verify single products ( data not shown ) .
the relative template abundance ( rta ) was determined by comparing gene expression in klh - stimulated and unstimulated t cell cultures .
first , ct means were subtracted from 50 to produce adjusted ct means and standard deviations from triplicate samples .
the adjusted mean of each - k sample was subtracted from the adjusted mean of the antigen - stimulated sample to provide the cycle difference ( cd ) .
finally , the rta was determined by calculating 2cd .

background : neuronal calcium sensor - 1 ( ncs - 1 ) is a ca2 + - binding protein that interacts with neuronal proteins .
results : ncs - 1 binds the dopamine d2 receptor and its cognate kinase in different ways .
conclusion : the c terminus and ef3 - ef4 linker of ncs - 1 modulate its binding to these target proteins .
significance : the specificity and diversity of ncs family proteins are determined by the c - lobe - binding site conformation .
neuronal calcium sensor - 1 ( ncs - 1 ) is the primordial member of the neuronal calcium sensor family of ef - hand ca2 + - binding proteins .
it interacts with both the g - protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) dopamine d2 receptor ( d2r ) , regulating its internalization and surface expression , and the cognate kinases grk1 and grk2 .
determination of the crystal structures of ca2 +/ ncs - 1 alone and in complex with peptides derived from d2r and grk1 reveals that the differential recognition is facilitated by the conformational flexibility of the c - lobe - binding site .
we find that two copies of the d2r peptide bind within the hydrophobic crevice on ca2 +/ ncs - 1 , but only one copy of the grk1 peptide binds .
the different binding modes are made possible by the c - lobe - binding site of ncs - 1 , which adopts alternative conformations in each complex .
c - terminal residues ser - 178 - val - 190 act in concert with the flexible ef3 / ef4 loop region to effectively form different peptide - binding sites .
in the ca2 +/ ncs - 1.d2r peptide complex , the c - terminal region adopts a 310 helix - turn - 310 helix , whereas in the grk1 peptide complex it forms an alpha - helix .
removal of ser - 178 - val - 190 generated a c - terminal truncation mutant that formed a dimer , indicating that the ncs - 1 c - terminal region prevents ncs - 1 oligomerization .
we propose that the flexible nature of the c - terminal region is essential to allow it to modulate its protein - binding sites and adapt its conformation to accommodate both ligands .
this appears to be driven by the variability of the conformation of the c - lobe - binding site , which has ramifications for the target specificity and diversity of ncs - 1 .
calcium dopamine g protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) receptor internalization x - ray crystallography d2 dopamine receptor grk1 neuronal calcium sensor - 1 introduction ca2 + is known to trigger the release of neurotransmitters in synapses .
the transmission of information through the central nervous system , therefore , relies on changes in intracellular free ca2 + concentration .
it is well established that the response to changes in ca2 + concentration that results in neurotransmitter release is mediated by the ca2 + - binding protein synaptotagmin ( 1 ) .
many other aspects of neuronal function are modified through the actions of other ca2 + - binding proteins .
for example , changes in synaptic plasticity and gene expression in neurons can involve the ca2 + - binding protein calmodulin ( 2 , 3 ) .
other aspects of neuronal function are regulated by the neuronal calcium sensor ( ncs ) 5 family of ef - hand - containing proteins ( 4 ) .
ncs proteins have a much higher affinity for ca2 + than calmodulin ; this fact means that ncs proteins bind ca2 + following much smaller increases in ca2 + concentration above resting levels .
in addition , the higher affinity of ncs proteins for ca2 + limits the dynamic range over which these proteins can respond to changes in intracellular ca2 + concentration ( 5 ) .
ncs - 1 , a member of the ncs family , has been reported to be involved in many important physiological functions ( 6 ) , ranging from the regulation of neurotransmitter release ( 7 , 8 ) to neuronal development ( 9 , 10 ) , and learning ( 11 , 12 ) .
the target proteins that interact directly with ncs - 1 to cause some of these physiological effects ( 6 , 13 , 14 ) include phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase ( pi4k ) iiibeta ( 15 , 16 ) , arf1 ( 15 , 17 ) , the dopamine d2 receptor ( 18 ) , and g - protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) kinases grk1 ( 19 ) and grk2 ( 18 , 20 ) .
the gpcr d2r is the primary isoform found in the brain ; its physiological relevance is illustrated by the fact that it is the target for all known effective antipsychotic drugs ( 21 ) .
the activity of gpcrs can be terminated by the phosphorylation of their activated states by the gpcr kinase family of proteins ( 22 ) .
ncs - 1 binds to both the d2r and its cognate kinases grk1 and grk2 ; for example , an ncs - 1.d2r.grk2 ternary complex has been detected ( 18 ) , with grk2 promoting the desensitization of the d2r .
ncs - 1 binds d2r at the short 16 - residue intracellular c - terminal region ( 18 , 23 ) .
ncs - 1 interaction with and regulation of d2r is important , because this forms the link between the overexpression of ncs - 1 with spatial memory acquisition ( 12 ) and explains why ncs - 1 is required for an adaptive response to dopaminergic agonists in substantia nigra neurons ( 20 ) .
significantly , ncs - 1 is up - regulated in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia ( 24 ) and in response to anti - psychotic drugs ( 25 ) .
knowledge of the molecular basis for the recognition of d2r and gpcr kinase by ncs - 1 could contribute to the development of drugs that are specific for this signaling pathway .
here , we report the determination of the crystal structures of rattus norvegicus ncs - 1 in complex with peptides derived from d2r and grk1 , as well as the structures of ncs - 1 alone and in a c - terminal truncated form .
in the complex structures , each ncs - 1 molecule binds two copies of the d2r peptide but only one grk1 peptide in overlapping , although not identical , binding sites .
these structures show that ncs - 1 could simultaneously bind d2r and grk1 peptides and thus act as a small scaffold protein .
significant conformational changes are observed in the c - terminal region of ncs - 1 in both complexes to facilitate this function .
we also show that removal of this section of the c terminus leads to the formation of an ncs - 1 dimer .
based on the crystal structures determined here , we proposed an induced - fit mechanism for ncs - 1 recognition of its targets , which requires flexibility of both the c terminus and the ef3 / ef4 linker regions .
experimental procedures plasmids a mutant construct ncs - 1 ( 1 - 177 ) , where the last 13 residues were removed , was generated by introducing a stop codon after proline 177 using an antisense strand 5 ' - cggatccggtaccttactaggggtcggccttggagcc - 3 ' .
peptide synthesis the d2 receptor peptide ( d2r peptide ) used here ( niefrkaflkilhsr ) corresponds to residues 430 - 443 of the human d2 receptor , with the exception that the ser replaced cys in the original sequence ( uniprot p14416.2 ) , and the terminal arg was added to improve solubility .
the n terminus of grk1 ( referred to as grk1 peptide ) corresponds to residues 1 - 25 ( mdfgsletvvansafiaargsfdgs ) of grk1 ( uniprot q15835 ) .

for the ncs - 1.d2r complex , molecular replacement used the structure of human ncs - 1 ( human and rat ncs - 1 have 99 % sequence identity ; pdb accession 1g8i ) and phaser ( 31 ) , as implemented from within phenix ( 32 ) .
the results gave a clear solution to the rotation ( z score 7.2 ) and translation functions , with one ncs - 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit .
this was followed by automated model building and refinement in phenix .
at this stage , electron density for the helix for chain b was readily apparent , and a model for the helix was built in manually using coot ( 33 ) .
further refinement using refmac 5.6 ( 34 ) from the ccp4 suite ( 35 ) revealed density for a second copy of the bound peptide , also as a helix , located adjacent to chain b. this was built manually as chain c. final rounds of refinement were carried out assisted by the pdb _ redo server ( 36 ) , accompanied by minor manual rebuilding .
the final structure was complete from leu - 10 to val - 190 and contained three ca2 + ions and a single potassium ion .
data for the uncomplexed ncs - 1 were processed using mosflm ( 37 ) and scala ( 30 ) .
the structure was determined using the ncs - 1 coordinates from the ncs - 1.d2 peptide complex and the program molrep ( 38 ) , as implemented from within the ccp4 program suite ( 39 ) .
the molecular replacement procedure revealed a dimer in the asymmetric unit , and an initial model for both chains was built using buccaneer , within the ccp4 program suite ( 39 ) .
this was followed by manual rebuilding using coot ( 33 ) , and refinement was carried out using refmac ( 34 ) .
the final model contained three ca2 + ions per chain , as for the ncs - 1.peptide complex , plus two ions that bridged crystal contacts in the structure , and were built as na + , presumably acquired from the crystallization buffer .
electron density was weak or missing for residues 1 , 51 - 59 , 132 - 138 , and 190 ( chain a ) and 1 - 9 , 134 - 138 , and 186 - 190 ( chain b ) .
the structure of the ncs - 1.grk1 complex was determined using the coordinates from the a chain of the ncs - 1 apoprotein and the program molrep ( 38 ) , as implemented from within the ccp4 program suite ( 39 ) .
the molecular replacement procedure revealed a dimer in the asymmetric unit ; minor manual rebuilding was carried out using coot ( 33 ) and initial refinement with refmac 5.6 ( 34 ) .
electron density for a single grk1 peptide per ncs - 1 monomer , in a helical conformation , was readily detectable .
final rounds of refinement were carried out assisted by the pdb _ redo server ( 36 ) , accompanied by minor manual rebuilding .
the final model contained one grk1 peptide and three ca2 + ions per chain .
electron density was weak or missing for residues 1 - 7 , 134 - 137 , and 185 - 190 ( chain a ) and for 1 - 7 , 133 - 138 , and 185 - 190 ( chain b ) .
data for ncs - 1deltact were processed using mosflm ( 37 ) and scala ( 30 ) .
molecular replacement was in phaser ( 31 ) using as search model the structure of the ncs - 1.d2r complex where the binding peptide had been removed and the c terminus truncated to match construct composition .
the four molecular copies of ncs - 1deltact in this crystal form were readily identified in this way .
manual model rebuilding was in coot ( 33 ) and refinement used phenix 1.9 ( 32 ) applying ncs restraints across the four molecular copies in the asymmetric unit and tls refinement ( one group per molecular copy ) .
as for the ncs - 1.peptide complexes , the final ncs - 1deltact model contained three ca2 + ions per chain .
electron density was weak or missing for the following residues that are not included in the model : 1 - 15 , 136 - 143 , and 175 - 177 ( chain a ) ; 1 - 7 , 138 - 142 , and 176 - 177 ( chain b ) ; 1 - 7 , 36 - 42 , 139 - 142 , and 175 - 177 ( chain c ) ; and 1 - 7 , 40 - 42 , and 174 - 177 ( chain d ) .
data statistics and model parameters are listed in table 1 .
protein - protein contacts were analyzed using pisa ( 40 ) and pic ( 41 ) .
results structure of uncomplexed rat ncs - 1 the crystal structure of rat ncs - 1 ( hereafter referred to simply as ncs - 1 ) includes four canonical ef - hand folds ( fig. 1a ) ; the overall fold is similar to that adopted by human ca2 +/ ncs - 1 ( 27 ) and its yeast ortholog frequenin ( fig. 2a ) ( 42 ) .
electron density consistent with three ca2 + ions in ef2 , ef3 , and ef4 was observed ; as expected for the ncs family of proteins , ef1 does not bind ca2 + ( 5 ) .
ef1 and ef2 form the n - lobe and ef3 and ef4 the c - lobe ; intra - lobe hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions help to stabilize the conformation of the two lobes .
the inter - helix angles of the ef1 - 4 are , respectively , 91 , 96 , 90 , and 105degrees ; these are similar to the inter - helix angles found for ca2 + - bound ef hands in other proteins , for example ca2 +/ calmodoulin ( cam ) and kchip1 ( 43 ) .
structurally , both the n - and c - lobes overlay well with each other , with an overall root mean square deviation of 1.187 a for backbone atoms .
residues pro - 177 - leu - 183 form the final helix 10 ( h10 ) , which makes several hydrophobic contacts with the c - lobe as follows : val - 180 - - > leu - 97 , leu - 183 - - > leu - 97 , leu - 183 - - > leu - 101 , ile - 179 - - > leu - 101 , and ile - 179 - - > met - 156 .
the n - and c - lobes are connected by gly - 95 , which is highly conserved in the ncs protein family but is not found in cam ( fig. 2a ) .
consequently , in the ca2 + - bound state , ncs - 1 folds in such a way that the two lobes are oriented to jointly present a large , solvent - exposed , concave hydrophobic crevice onto which peptide , proteins , and other hydrophobic molecules can dock and bind ( fig. 1b ) .

a , alignment of the primary sequence of rat ncs - 1 ( rnncs - 1 ; swiss - prot p62168 ) with saccharomyces cerevisiae ncs1 ( scncs1 ; swiss - prot q06389 ) , human kchip1 ( hukchip1 ; swiss - prot q9nzi2.2 ) and bovine recoverin ( bovrecoverin ; swiss - prot p21547 ) .
rnncs - 1 is repeated to separately identify ncs - 1 residues that form intermolecular interactions with d2r ( top sequence ) and grk1 ( 2nd sequence ) peptides .
numbering of amino acids is in accordance to the primary sequence of rat ncs - 1 .
secondary structure elements are derived from the structures of rat ncs - 1 in complex with d2 receptor peptide ( pdb 5aer ) .
the c - terminal region forms helix 10 in the ncs - 1 apoprotein and in the ncs - 1.grk1 complex ( denoted by the upper line of secondary structure for this region ) .
in the d2r peptide complex , helix 10 is replaced by a helix - turn - helix , and this is denoted as helices 10 and 10 ' .
the four ef - hands , ef1 , ef2 , ef3 , and ef4 , are colored red , blue , orange and yellow , respectively .
the short 310 helix between ef3 and ef4 is colored brown and the c - terminal region in green .
the hydrophobic residues that form interactions in the different complexes are highlighted in boldface ; the different complexes are ncs - 1.d2r complex ( pdb code 5aer ) , the rnncs - 1.grk1 complex , scncs1.pik1 ( pdb code 2ju0 ) , hukchip1.kv4.3 ( pdb codes 2nz0 and 2i2r ) and bovrecoverin / rhodopsin kinase ( pdb code 2i94 ) .
the conserved gly - 95 that divides ncs proteins into the n - and c - lobes is highlighted in red .
the hydrophobic contacts are analyzed from the deposited structures using the protein interactions calculator webserver ( 38 ) .
b and c , amino acid sequence of d2 dopamine receptor ( b ) and grk1 ( c ) peptides with residues involved in hydrophobic interactions with ncs - 1 in boldface and the alpha - helices colored in magenta / cyan and pink , respectively , in the d2r and grk1 complex .
in the ncs - 1.grk1 peptide structure , a hydrophobic triad is formed between met - 156 , ile - 179 , and the peptide residue ile - 16 .
the crystal structure contained two copies of ncs - 1 in the asymmetric unit , related by noncrystallographic 2 - fold symmetry .
however , analysis of rat ncs - 1 by sec malls ( fig. 3a ) shows that ncs - 1 is monomeric in solution with an estimated molecular mass of 21,880 +/ - 200 daltons .

malls and itc analyses .
a and b , malls data for ncs - 1 , showing a peak consistent with a monodisperse sample and an expected molecular mass of 21,880 +/ - 200 daltons .
the average molecular mass per volume unit is shown in gray and the differential refractive index in black .
b , malls data for ca2 +/ ncs - 1 ( 1 - 177 ) ( ncs - 1deltact ) , the protein elutes as a polydisperse peak with molecular mass ranging from 29,300 to 42,000 daltons .
other details are as for a. c , itc titration data for the binding of the d2r peptide to ncs - 1 ; data from two runs were concatenated to achieve a saturating isotherm .
the data were fitted to a two - site binding model to yield kd values of 40 +/ - 6 mum .
isothermal titration calorimetry the region of the d2r recognized by ncs - 1 was narrowed down to the peptide sequence tfniefrkaflkilhc ( 18 ) .
a crystal structure of the homologous d3 receptor has since become available ( 44 ) , which places this sequence at the end of the 7th transmembrane helix , with the tf dipeptide forming the last two residues of this helix .
we found that the peptide tfniefrkaflkilhc was insoluble in water , but removal of the first two n - terminal amino acids improved solubility .
to overcome potential disulfide bridge formation , the c - terminal cys was replaced by a ser , and an additional arg was added to further improve solubility .
hence , the peptide niefrkaflkilhsr was used for the studies described here and is referred to as the d2r peptide .
because of limited solubility , the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment was performed by titrating ncs - 1 into the d2r peptide .
the binding isotherm was fitted to two models .
a sequential binding model gives kd values of ~ 43 and 58 mum , with very similar deltah and deltas values for the two interactions .
a two - site nonsequential model with a fixed stoichiometry of 1:2 ncs - 1.peptide gives a kd of 40 +/ - 6 mum for both sites ( fig. 3c ) .
because there is no other evidence to suggest a sequential binding mode , we have selected the simplest two - site binding mode for the interpretation of these data , which shows that the interactions are entropically driven , with deltah = - 2.06 +/ - 0.07 kcal / mol and - tdeltas = - 3.9 +/ - 0.8 kcal / mol .
the favorable entropy is expected , given the expected hydrophobic nature of the interactions between the peptide and the protein .
the binding isotherm is typical of a weak interaction ; it is possible to derive reliable dissociation constants because a sufficiently large proportion of the binding isotherm was used for the analysis ( 45 ) .
the synthetic peptide from grk1 , rk25 , is the same peptide sequence that was used to form a complex with recoverin ( 46 ) .
this peptide had limited solubility and a propensity to aggregate , making it difficult to reliably measure its binding affinity with ncs - 1 using either the itc or an nmr method .
structure of the ca2 +/ ncs - 1.d2r peptide complex diffraction data were collected from crystals of rat ncs - 1 in complex with the d2r peptide , and the structure was determined to 2.19 - a resolution .
the complex adopted a different crystal form from the ncs - 1 structure without peptide bound , with one ncs - 1 chain in the asymmetric unit .
the most striking feature is that ncs - 1 binds two copies of the d2r , one in the n - lobe site ( referred to as peptide d2b ) and the other in the c - lobe site ( peptide d2c ) ( fig. 4a ) .
both peptides bind as amphipathic helices , with d2b forming a slightly longer helix than d2c .
the two peptides are bound with their c termini pointing toward the center of the ncs - 1 molecule .
ef1 / ef2 residues form most of the interactions with d2b and ef3 / ef4 with d2c ( fig. 4b ) , although there are some exceptions .
in addition , the c - terminal region ile - 179 - val - 190 is also involved in interactions with d2c .
the main interactions between the peptides and ncs - 1 in the two binding sites are summarized in table 2 .

table 2 main intermolecular and intramolecular interactions involving d2 receptor peptides and ncs - 1 in the n - lobe site , the protein - peptide interface is formed by 11 hydrophobic residues from ncs - 1 and 7 residues from d2b .
the total buried surface areas of 737 a2 for ncs - 1 and 814 a2 for the peptide are slightly higher than for other protein.peptide complexes ( 47 ) .
the loop comprising residues gln - 54 - gly - 59 was omitted from the structure of ca2 +/ ncs - 1 alone , but electron density was observed when the d2r peptides were present .
peptide residues ile - 431 , phe - 433 , ala - 436 , phe - 437 , leu - 438 , ile - 440 , and leu - 441 , which are completely conserved between the d2 and d3 dopamine receptors and 50 % conserved in the d4 receptor , make hydrophobic contacts with the conserved ncs - 1 residues trp - 30 , phe - 34 , phe - 48 , ile - 51 , tyr - 52 , phe - 55 , val - 68 , phe - 72 , phe - 85 , leu - 89 , and trp - 103 ( table 2 and fig. 5a ) .

phe - 437 and leu - 441 make the most contacts with the protein , with their side chains completely buried at the hydrophobic interface .
more interactions are formed with trp - 30 of ncs - 1 than any other residues in this pocket , with phe - 55 being the most buried at the protein - peptide interface .
attempts to test the importance of trp - 30 were hampered by the severe aggregation of the w30l mutant protein .

b , detailed view of the hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of d2c ( cyan ) and the c - lobe .
peptide residue labels are in italics .
binding of d2c at the c - lobe site gives rise to several significant conformational changes in ncs - 1 .
the buried surface areas for ncs - 1 and the d2 receptor peptide are , respectively , 600 and 681 a2 , both notably lower than the buried surface for d2b binding ; this is explained by d2c making fewer intermolecular contacts than d2b ( table 2 ) .
hydrogen bonds between gln - 181 of ncs - 1 and asn - 430 of d2c orient the peptide such that it binds in the opposite direction to d2b ( fig. 4a ) .
the main structural changes that occur on binding are found in the ef3 - ef4 linker region ( val - 132 - pro - 139 ) and in the c - terminal segment ( asp - 176 - val - 190 ) .
in the uncomplexed protein , electron densities for val - 132 - leu - 138 are missing , implying that this region is unstructured ( fig. 6a ) ; in the presence of d2c , the region immediately after ef3 adopts a short 310 helix ( gly - 133 to thr - 135 ) , and electron density for the loop is now defined ( fig. 6b ) .
this induced - fit structural stabilization effectively increases the height of one side of the binding crevice ( fig. 6b , right ) .
the interactions between residues ile - 128 , tyr - 129 , val - 132 , val - 136 , and leu - 138 from this region and the hydrophobic side of the d2c amphipathic helix form the predominant contacts between the peptide and the protein ( fig. 5b ) .
additional hydrophobic contacts occur between d2c , including those with phe - 55 and ala - 182 and with tyr - 186 in the c - terminal segment ( fig. 5b and table 2 ) .
it is interesting to note that the ef3 / ef4 linker is the least conserved segment in the ncs family of proteins ( fig. 2 ) , and the residues that are stabilized upon d2r peptide binding are , therefore , likely to have a role in determining the specificity of the different ncs family members .

the c - terminal helix 10 is colored green , and ca2 + ions are shown in brown .
electron density for val - 132 - leu - 138 was weak , and these residues were therefore omitted from the model .
b , backbone schematic and molecular surface representations of the c - lobe of ncs - 1.d2r complex ( pdb code 5aer ) .
the c - terminal helix - loop - helix ( helices 10 and 10 ') formed by residues pro - 177 - leu - 189 is colored green .
the d2b peptide in the n - site is colored magenta ; the d2c peptide in the c - site is colored cyan , and residues val - 132 - leu - 138 are colored brown .
in the absence of d2c , the c - terminal segment residue pro - 177 - leu - 183 forms alpha - helix 10 ( h10 ) ( fig. 6a ) , which makes hydrophobic intramolecular side - chain interactions , hydrogen bonds , and ionic contacts with helices 5 , 6 , and 8 .
helix 10 forms one edge of the large ligand - binding hydrophobic crevice , rather than occupying the hydrophobic ligand - binding crevice .
when d2c is bound , the c - terminal region switches to a " u " shaped conformation comprising two antiparallel 310 helices , pro - 177 - val - 180 and ser - 184 to gly - 188 , connected by a turn made up of residues gln - 181 - leu - 183 ( fig. 6b ) .
the c - terminal segment forms many intramolecular side - chain interactions with the hydrophobic binding groove as follows : ile - 179 - - > ile - 152 , met - 155 , met - 156 , phe - 169 ; val - 180 - - > tyr - 108 , phe - 169 , and leu - 183 - - > leu - 107 , tyr - 108 ( table 2 ) .
furthermore , extensive hydrophobic side - chain interactions within the helix - turn - helix motif involving residues val - 180 , ala - 182 , leu - 183 , leu - 185 , tyr - 186 , and leu - 189 serve to maintain and stabilize this conformation .
in summary , two molecules of the d2r peptides bind in the hydrophobic crevice of ncs - 1 , with the most significant conformational changes observed in the ef3 / ef4 linker and the c - terminal region , which adopts a helix - loop - helix conformation in the complex .
structure of ca2 +/ ncs - 1.grk1 peptide complex determination of the crystal structure of the complex of ca2 +/ ncs - 1 with the grk1 peptide revealed a different mode of recognition compared with d2r .
only one molecule of the grk1 peptide is bound , deep into the hydrophobic groove of ncs - 1 ( fig. 7a ) .
the grk1 peptide binds as a two - turn alpha - helix involving residues ser - 5 - ala - 14 , with the peptide aligned parallel with the n - c axis of ncs - 1 ; electron density for the remainder of the peptide was not observed .
the contacts made between the protein and peptide are summarized in table 3 .
the protein - peptide interface is formed by 29 residues from the protein and 8 hydrophobic residues from grk1 peptide , with total buried surface areas of 711 a2 for ncs - 1 and 921 a2 for the peptide .
the electron densities for gln - 54 - gly - 59 and part of the ef3 / ef4 linker region are missing .
the main protein - peptide contacts are formed by residues leu - 6 , val - 9 , val - 10 , ala - 14 , phe - 15 , ile - 16 , and ala - 17 of grk1 peptide ( fig. 7b ) .
these residues fit into the hydrophobic crevice , with side - chain hydrophobic contacts formed between them and the exposed highly conserved hydrophobic residues of ncs - 1 from both the n - lobe , c - lobe , and c - terminal helix 10 ( fig. 7b and table 3 ) .

table 3 main intermolecular and intramolecular interactions involving grk1 peptide and ncs - 1 the biggest differences between the grk1 peptide and d2r peptide complexes lie in the conformations of the c - terminal region of ncs - 1 and the ef3 / ef4 linker region .
in the d2r peptide complex , residues pro - 177 - val - 190 form a 310 - helix - loop - 310 - helix and share the c - lobe - binding site with one of the d2r peptides ( fig. 8a ) .
rather than being buried deep into the hydrophobic crevice , this d2r peptide is displaced to one side of the binding site ( fig. 8a ) with hydrophobic interactions between the peptide and the ef3 / ef4 linker region stabilizing the structure of the complex .
in contrast , the c - terminal region of ncs - 1 in the ncs - 1.grk1 peptide complex forms an alpha - helix that lies to one side of the hydrophobic crevice .
the electron densities for asn - 134 - glu - 137 of the ef3 / ef4 linker region are missing , making the c - lobe site very solvent - exposed and allowing the grk1 peptide to bind deep into the hydrophobic pocket ( fig. 8b ) .
interestingly , the nmr structure of yeast ncs1 bound to the n terminus of pik1 also shows the c - terminal segment of the pik1 peptide located deep in the hydrophobic crevice ( 48 ) , although in this case , the c - terminal region of ncs1 was not be defined due to conformational exchange .

comparison of d2r and grk1 peptide binding to rat ca2 +/ ncs - 1 .
a , view from the n - terminal end of the ncs - 1.d2r peptide complex ( pdb code 5aer ) showing the location of the d2r peptide that is bound in the c - lobe of ncs - 1 ( denoted by d2c ) .
for clarity , the d2b peptide in the n - lobe site is omitted .
the d2c peptide is colored cyan ; residues from the ef3 / ef4 linker region ( val - 132 - leu - 138 ) are colored brown , and the c - terminal region comprising helices 10 and 10 ' is shown in green .
b , view from the n - terminal end of ncs - 1 bound to grk1 ( pdb code 5afp ) .
the grk1 peptide is colored pink , residue leu - 138 from the ef3 / ef4 linker region is colored brown , and the c - terminal region comprising helix 10 is shown in green .
conformation of the c - terminal region of rat ca2 +/ ncs - 1 the d2r and grk1 complex structures provide strong evidence for the importance of the c - terminal region of ncs - 1 in peptide recognition .
to investigate this phenomenon further , residues ser - 178 - val - 190 were deleted to create a c - terminal truncated mutant , ncs - 1deltact .
the solution behavior of ncs - 1deltact was significantly different from that of the full - length protein .
size exclusion chromatography - multiangle laser light scattering analysis showed that ncs - 1deltact was polydisperse , with a molecular mass between 29,300 and 42,000 daltons , compared with that for the monodisperse full - length protein of 21,880 daltons ( fig. 3b ) .
the polydispersity was confirmed in the nmr spectra of ncs - 1deltact , which showed significant concentration - dependent line broadening ( fig. 9a ) , similar to that previously reported ( 49 ) .
titration with the d2r peptide improved the line widths and overall spectral quality ( fig. 9b ) .
we infer from these results that without the c - terminal region the ncs - 1 hydrophobic binding site is completely exposed , causing the protein to self - associate .

residues from helix 3 and the ef1 / ef2 loop ( phe - 48 - phe - 58 ) are colored red , and residues in the ef3 / ef4 loop region ( val - 136 - pro - 139 ) are colored brown .
conserved hydrophobic surface - exposed residues in the n - lobe site , which are involved with binding the d2r peptide , are highlighted in yellow ( similar to those highlighted in fig. 4b ) .
d2r peptide in the n - site is shown with magenta ribbon for comparison .
ca2 + ions are shown as brown spheres .
ncs - 1deltact crystallized as a symmetrical homodimer with the structure resembling a pair of clasped hands , with the " fingers " of one hand inserting into the " palm " of the other .
the palm is the hydrophobic ligand - binding crevice , and the fingers are formed by hydrophobic residues positioned on the surface of the one subunit in such a way that they slot snugly into the hydrophobic crevice of the other subunit ( fig. 9b ) .
hydrophobic residues from helix 3 and the ef1 / ef2 loop ( residues phe - 49 - phe - 58 ) bind to the n - lobe site ; residues val - 136 - pro - 139 in the ef3 / ef4 loop region bind to the c - lobe site ( fig. 9b ) .
interestingly , these two loop regions have been singled out as the ones that are poorly defined in the unliganded protein ( see above ) .
the protein - protein interface buries a large area of about 1854 a , which means that nearly one - third of the surface of each subunit forms the interface in the homodimer .
similar c - terminal truncations of ncs - 1 ( 49 ) and recoverin ( 50 ) have been studied previously for ligand binding activities , although no high resolution structural characterization was performed .
in the nmr solution studies , we and others ( 23 , 49 ) have reported that the c - terminal region ( ile - 179 - val - 190 ) , in either the unliganded or complexed protein , exists in intermediate chemical exchange on the nmr time scale between several conformations , precluding the determination of the precise structure of this region of the protein .
at first glance , the mobility of the c - terminal region observed in the nmr experiments appears to contradict the observation of a single conformational state in the crystal structure of the full - length protein , where this region forms a well defined helix at the edge of the hydrophobic crevice .
however , it is likely that this conformation is one of many structures adopted by the c - terminal region in solution .
discussion the structural basis for the different physiological roles of the many neuronal calcium sensor protein interactions remains unclear , as there are only a limited number of relevant high resolution complex structures ( 6 ) .
the identification of the key determinants of binding specificity ( 51 ) and the way diversity is conferred remain outstanding questions. with the high homology of the primary polypeptide sequences and conservation of the ncs protein folds , it is not immediately apparent why and how these ncs proteins show specificity and diversity .
the four crystal structures of the two ncs - 1 complexes , the unliganded and truncated ca2 + - bound proteins , highlight the following significant features .
( i ) two molecules of d2r peptide bind to ncs - 1 , whereas only one molecule of the grk1 peptide is found in the hydrophobic binding groove .
( ii ) the conformation of the n - lobe site appears to be conserved across the two ncs - 1 complexes ; in contrast , the c - lobe site configuration is variable , due to the different conformations adopted by the ef3 - ef4 linker region and the c - terminal residues pro - 177 - val - 190 .
( iii ) the c - terminal region partially occupies the c - lobe site in the d2r peptide complex , providing interaction sites for the peptide .
( iv ) removal of the c - terminal segment ( ser - 178 - val - 190 ) leads to a dimerization of ncs - 1 .
the important hydrophobic residues in ncs - 1 protein , which form the n - lobe ligand binding pocket , include the highly conserved residues trp - 30 , phe - 34 , phe - 48 , ile - 51 , tyr - 52 , phe - 55 , phe - 85 , and leu - 89 ( fig. 2 and tables 2 and 3 ) ; in all the other complexes studied , these residues have been shown to be important for binding the target peptides and proteins ( fig. 2 ) .
in support of this , the functional importance of certain hydrophobic residues within the hydrophobic crevice of ncs - 1 , including leu - 89 , have been demonstrated in an in vivo rescue study in caenorhabditis elegans ( 52 ). with the exception of the stabilization of the ef1 / ef2 linker gln - 54 - gly - 59 in the d2r peptide complex , binding of both the d2r and grk1 peptide induces minimal conformational changes to the n - lobe of the ncs - 1 protein .
in contrast , more substantial structural changes occur at the c - lobe , particularly in the region val - 132 - pro - 139 within the poorly conserved ef3 - ef4 linker and the c - terminal ( pro - 177 - val - 190 ) region ; the latter adopts a 310 - helix - loop - 310 - helix in the d2r peptide complex and an alpha - helix in the grk1 peptide complex .
a comparison of the ncs - 1.d2r and ncs - 1.grk1 complex structures reveals some interesting features ( fig. 10 ) .
the ncs - 1.d2r complex ( fig. 10a ) closely resembles the nmr structure of the yeast ncs - 1 homolog , frequenin , in complex with yeast pik1 ( fig. 10b ) ( 48 ) , where two helical regions from the pik1 polypeptide ( 119 - 256 ) bind separately to the n - lobe and c - lobe hydrophobic pockets ( 48 ) ; the c terminus in this structure ( pdb 2ju0 ) is undefined .

comparison of the structures of ncs protein complexes .
schematic representations are shown of the structures of ncs - 1 in complex with two molecules of d2r peptide ( magenta and cyan ) ( pdb 5aer ) ( a ) , scncs1in complex with fragment of pik1 ( yellow ) ( pdb 2ju0 ) ( 45 ) ( b ) , ncs - 1 in complex with one molecule of grk1 peptide ( pink ) ( pdb 5afp ) ( c ) , and kchip1 with a fragment of bound kv4.3 ( blue ) ( pdb 2i2r ) ( 50 ) ( d ) .
e , recoverin bound to the n terminus of grk1 residues 1 - 25 with grk1 peptide ( red ; pdb 2i94 ) ( 52 ) .
f , overlay of structures 5aer and 5afp showing the locations of the d2r bound in the n - site and grk1 peptides .
the peptide orientations are indicated as n and c in bold italics , and the orientations of the ncs protein are identical in all the structures .
the ef3 / ef4 linker is colored brown and the c - terminal region green ; for clarity these regions are indicated only for the ncs - 1.d2r peptide complex .
in all the structures , ca2 + ions are shown as brown spheres .
interestingly , the ncs - 1.grk1 complex resembles the kchip1.kv4.3 complex ( pdb 2nz0 and 2i2r ) , with the bound peptides forming an alpha - helix that spans both the n - and c - lobe sites ( fig. 10 , c and d ) ( 53 , 54 ) .
the c - terminal alpha - helix in both complexes form one edge of the hydrophobic groove .
in both the ncs - 1.grk1 peptide and kchip1.kv4.3 complexes , hydrophobic side - chain interactions are found between the c - terminal region and the bound peptide , indicating that that region helps to stabilize the binding of the partner peptides .
somewhat surprising are the differences observed between the ncs - 1.grk1 peptide complex and the nmr structure of the same peptide in complex with its in vivo - characterized ncs partner , recoverin ( pdb 2i94 ) ( fig. 10e ) ( 46 ) , which shows the helical peptide binding only in the n - lobe site and in the opposite orientation to that found in the ncs - 1.grk1 complex .
the c - lobe site in the recoverin structure is occupied by the last short helix 10 of recoverin itself .
the structures determined here provide detailed insights into both specificity and promiscuity of ncs proteins .
first , the same peptide from grk1 appears to be able to bind to two ncs proteins , recoverin and ncs - 1 , using different modes ( fig. 10 , c and e ) .
second , the same ncs protein can bind targets in different ways ( fig. 10 , a and c ) .
although previously proposed and discussed ( 6 , 51 , 56 ) , to the best of our knowledge there have been no side - by - side comparisons of the different complex ncs structures to date .
the different binding modes show that the c terminus is important in driving target specificity .
in addition , as shown by nmr studies ( 48 , 49 ) , the c terminus in solution appears to be dynamic , adopting multiple conformations .
the results here demonstrate that the mobility and flexibility of the c - terminal region have a particular functional significance .
flexibility allows the c - terminal region to serve two purposes .
first , it serves to occlude the hydrophobic binding crevice in the absence of a partner protein and to prevent protein self - association and nonspecific interactions .
second , it modulates and regulates binding by adopting conformations to suit the binding partner .
an observation in support of a physiological role for the c terminus is the consequence of a mutation in ncs - 1 found in a patient with autism spectrum disorder ( 57 ) , which resulted in a change in ncs - 1 membrane association dynamics , coupled to enhanced conformational dynamics of the c terminus of the protein ( 58 ) .
the more ubiquitous ca2 + - binding protein cam , with over 80 structures of complexes in the protein data bank , is known to exhibit diverse binding modes that are functionally important ( 59 ) .
this is made possible predominantly by the conformational flexibility of the linker between the n - and c - lobes .
ncs - 1 is reported to bind to over 20 proteins ( 6 ) , despite the fact that it does not have the same flexible linker found in ca2 +/ cam .
instead , other elements of the ncs - 1 structure confer the diversity and define the specificity , and the structures reported here provide an explanation of how this is achieved .
the c - terminal region , together with the less conserved region in the ef3 / ef4 linker , has the flexibility and structural plasticity to form the precise conformation of the c - lobe site to accommodate the binding target ; hence , these components , c - terminal region , ef3 / ef4 linker , and the binding peptide , all act in concert to form a unique protein complex .
this observation would also explain why the ef3 / ef4 linker and the c - terminal regions of the ncs family have low sequence and length conservation , compared with the rest of the protein sequence .
because of the more constrained structure of the ncs proteins , however , ncs proteins are likely to have less binding diversity than cam .
it is interesting to note that the average sizes of the ncs peptide ligands are around 16 amino acids , and the hydrophobic crevice can accommodate two peptides of this size .
the binding modes observed here agree with the d2r being a dimer ( based on the structure of the highly homologous d3r ) ( 44 ) and grk1 being a monomer ( 55 ) .
we previously produced a model of ncs - 1 interacting with the d3 receptor dimer , and we concluded that a minor conformational change in the receptor is required for it to bind to a single molecule of ncs - 1 ( 23 ) .
interestingly , the d2r and grk1 peptides are not identically located in the hydrophobic binding groove of ncs - 1 ; hence , there is a possibility that ncs - 1 ( and perhaps other ncs proteins ) can simultaneously bind to two targets .
an ncs - 1.d2r.grk2 ternary complex has previously been detected ( 18 ) , and the structures determined here provide an explanation as to how this might be achieved , by a molecule of ncs - 1 binding only to one subunit of the d2r , leaving most of the c - lobe free for grk1 to bind , as shown in fig. 10f .
this work shows how ncs proteins differentially affect specific aspects of neuronal function through their interactions with different target proteins .
genetics studies have shown that ncs proteins do not entirely overlap in function , where the loss of one is not compensated by another .
this lack of redundancy is possibly due to the specificities different ncs proteins have toward their targets .
the c - terminal region appears to act as a gate of the large hydrophobic crevice , and , together with the flexible ef3 / ef4 linker it defines an appropriate binding site that filters out interactions that cannot be accommodated at this site .
finally , the structures here also show how ncs - 1 could act as a small scaffold by allowing two proteins to bind simultaneously .

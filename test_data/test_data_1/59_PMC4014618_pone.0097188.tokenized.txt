objective to determine the frequency of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( osas ) , metabolic syndrome and common mental disorders in the working population of 11 small enterprises and the feasibility of a program of action for health .
method the clinical risk of osas , the prevalence of metabolic syndrome , and the level of psychological disorders were assessed during routine medical examination at the workplace in 2012 .
the response to medical advice was assessed in 2013 .
results 12.3 % of the workers were suspected of being affected by osas .
one or more components of metabolic syndrome were present in 24.5 % of cases .
osas in " healthy " workers was significantly associated with the presence of one or more components of metabolic syndrome ( or = 3.83 ; 95 % ci 1.45 - 10.13 ) and with a psychological disorders score in the highest quartile ( or = 4.67 ; 95 % ci = 1.72 - 12.64 ) .
workers with suspected osas were reluctant to follow advice about undergoing further tests under the nhs .
however , in some cases , confirmation of the osas diagnosis and subsequent treatment led to an improvement in metabolic condition .
conclusion although participation in treatment was limited , anecdotal cases support the idea that prevention of obstructive sleep apnea in the workplace might be useful for workers' health .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( osas ) is a common disorder caused by repeated episodes of airflow cessation ( apneas ) leading to arterial hypoxemia and sleep disruption [ 1 ] .
this syndrome may have a number of consequences that deeply affect the quality of life , such as excessive daytime sleepiness , neurocognitive deterioration , and endocrinologic and metabolic effects [ 2 ] .
metabolic syndrome ( ms ) that is , itself , emerging as a highly prevalent public health problem , may be linked with osas .
in fact , the presence of osas may increase the risk of developing some aspects of metabolic syndrome [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
moreover , clinical studies have shown a statistically significant correlation between the severity of osas and obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome [ 5 ] .
however , little is known about the possible association between early - stage osas and ms components in active workers .
only limited knowledge is also available concerning the relationship between the presence of osas and psychological problems , although this syndrome is known to have an impact on neurocognitive functioning .
employees with osas run a major risk of long - term work disability caused by injuries and mental disorders [ 6 ] .
self - reported symptoms of osas are an independent risk factor for subsequent long - term sick leave and permanent work disability [ 7 ] .
both osas and hypertension related to this syndrome are significant predictors of impairment in workers [ 8 ] .
however , all the above studies have focused on advanced cases of osas .
again , nothing is known about the mental health of active workers with previously undiagnosed osas .
the aim of occupational medicine is to continuously improve the health of workers .
for this reason , many health promotion campaigns are conducted in major companies .
the main objective of these programs is to identify a risk factor that can be removed or minimized , thereby improving occupational health .
osas may constitute a risk factor that requires an occupational prevention program .
the first objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the importance of osas as a risk factor .
in order to do this we aim to assess the prevalence of osas among previously undiagnosed " healthy " subjects working in various fields and study the association between osas and ms components and mental health .
before undertaking a campaign to promote health , it is necessary to check the availability of resources in the country and productive area where you intend to introduce measures of prevention .
in italy , industrial production is characterized mainly by the presence of small businesses with fewer than 50 workers .
health promotion in these companies is more difficult than in large firms , owing to the lack of financial resources and organizational structures needed to support it. the second objective of our study was to ascertain whether a health promotion program , conducted by a clinician performing health surveillance without the use of additional resources can achieve measurable results in a sample of small companies in the latium region of italy .
methods population the baseline study was conducted in the first 4 months of 2012 on workers called for a routine medical examination in the workplace .
the data in this study are partially drawn from the multicenter project solaris ( osas screening of workers in high risk of injury or accident ) , coordinated by the university of genoa .
the workers belonged to 11 small companies , each employing between 10 and 51 workers .
the productive sectors involved were : insurance , fuel distribution , home care , education , laboratory , wholesale , supermarkets , electronics and hotels .
subjects with a previous diagnosis of osas or respiratory disorders were excluded from the investigation .
204 out of 209 eligible subjects ( 97.6 %) participated in the survey .
in 2013 , 198 of these 204 workers ( 97.1 %) were still working in the same company and were again called to medical examination in the workplace .
during the visit , which is compulsory , workers who had been advised to do investigations for osas were asked the outcome .
none of the subjects with suspected osas was lost at follow - up. the overall participation rate at follow - up was 94.7 % .
questionnaires within the project , solaris workers were asked to complete two short questionnaires : the sleep disorder score ( sds ) [ 9 ] , and the epworth sleepiness scale ( ess ) [ 10 ] .
the sds test , used to aid diagnosis of osas , contains 4 items that respectively refer to nocturnal snoring , apnea , nocturnal awakenings , and dry mouth in the morning .
a global score was evaluated for each subject by averaging the numeric values associated with all 4 items , and an sds score of over 2 was considered to be pathological .
the ess test is a simple instrument for evaluating excessive daytime sleepiness .
it is an eight - item questionnaire which provides a simple and inexpensive measurement of tendency to sleep in different daily life situations .
for each situation , subjects could express a range of numeric values , from 0 to 3 , thus obtaining a total score ranging from 0 ( no daytime sleepiness ) to 24 ( the highest level of daytime sleepiness ) .
normally , ess scores of over 10 were considered to indicate excessive daytime sleepiness [ 11 ] .
however , studies performed with the italian version of the questionnaire showed that 12 and 17 were the ess cut - off scores with the best sensitivity and specificity [ 12 ] .
psychological distress was measured by the italian version [ 13 ] of the general health questionnaire [ 14 ] .
this test is made up of 12 - items .
each item is accompanied by four possible responses which can be scored on a likert scale from 1 to 4 .
the total score can yield a continuous variable ranging from 12 to 48 .
in the present study , ghq12 had a cronbach alpha = 0.849 .
for the purposes of statistical analysis , the values obtained with the ghq12 were divided into quartiles and the highest quartile was taken as an indicator of psychological problems .
the population was thus divided into two groups : those with psychological problems ( ghq in the highest quartile , i.e. > 24 ) and all the others .
in addition to gender and age , each subject declared smoking status ( current smoker / non - smoker ) , alcohol use ( divided into four classes : 1 = i do not drink alcohol ; 2 = i drink up to seven units of alcohol per week , i.e. one in the daytime ; 3 = i drink from eight to sixteen units of alcohol per week , i.e. two per day ; 4 = i drink more than sixteen units per week , i.e. more than 2 per day ) ; physical exercise ( at least 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity , 1 = at least 3 times a week ; 2 = twice a week ; 3 = once a week ; 4 = never ) .
during medical examinations , body mass index ( bmi ; kg / m2 ) , neck circumference ( nc ; cm ) , thyromental , or neck - chin angle ( n - ca ; grades ) [ 15 ] , and visibility of pharyngeal structures according to the mallampati classification [ 16 ] were measured .
the mallampati classification is a rough estimate of tongue size related to the oral cavity .
this was initially proposed as a simple , reproducible , and reliable preanesthetic airway assessment method .
besides being a sign of difficult tracheal intubation , mallampati class 3 or 4 is an independent predictor for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea [ 17 ] .
osas was suspected when there were at least 2 positive responses to the sleep disorders scale ( sds ) associated with at least 1 above the anthropomorphic threshold measured among the following parameters : bmi (> 30 kg / m2 ) ; nc (> 43 cm in male and > 41 cm in female workers ) ; n - ca (> 110degrees ) and mallampati ( 3 or 4 ) .
after collecting the solaris project data , subjects were further examined to evaluate the presence of metabolic syndrome .
according to the international diabetes federation ( idf ) guide [ 18 ] , metabolic syndrome is identified by the following criteria : central obesity ( defined as bmi > 30 kg / m2 , or increased waist circumference with ethnicity - specific values ) ; elevated triglyceride level : > 150 mg / dl ( 1.7 mmol / l ) , or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality ; reduced hdl cholesterol : < 40 mg / dl ( 1.03 mmol / l ) in males , < 50 mg / dl ( 1.29 mmol / l ) in females , or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality ; high blood pressure ( bp ) : systolic bp > 130 or diastolic bp > 85 mm hg , or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension ; high fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) : > 100 mg / dl ( 5.6 mmol / l ) , or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes .
workers with suspected osas were invited to undergo second level studies ( specialist neurological or pulmonary examination and possibly , depending on the advice of the specialist , imaging studies such as polysomnography ( psg ) .
adherence to this invitation was verified a year later during routine medical examination in the workplace .

ethics statement workers signed written consent .
the ethics committee of the universita cattolica del sacro cuore of rome approved the study design and the consent form .
statistics analyses were performed using ibm / spss for windows ( rel. 20.0 ) .
first of all , the data collected were analyzed using common statistics .
the results obtained for the two genders were compared using the student 's t test for independent data ( comparison of means ) or the chi - square test ( comparison of proportions ) .
logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between suspected osas and the presence of at least one metabolic syndrome components ( obesity , hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes ) .
the association between suspected osas and the presence of psychological problems ( ghq12 score in the highest quartile ) was also studied using logistic regression analysis .
in both the aforementioned analyses , personal factors ( age , sex , smoking , alcohol use , physical exercise ) were entered as confounding factors .
results the clinical and demographic characteristics of the subjects , both as a group and classified by gender , are reported in table 1 .
the descriptive statistics indicate a group of experienced workers ( 13.8 +/ - 9.1 years ) with a low number ( 37.3 %) of smokers and a normal mean bmi range ( 24.5 +/ - 4.3 kg / cm2 ) .
4.3 % ( n = 7 ) of subjects had an ess score > 10 , indicating daytime sleepiness .

in the gender comparison , males reported a significantly higher consumption of alcohol than females ( p < 0.011 ) .
a greater frequency of enlarged neck circumference , increased neck - chin angle , and mallampati grade 3 - 4 ( p < 0.024 ) was found in males than in females .
the score of the sds questionnaire on sleep disorders was significantly higher in males than in females ( p < 0.025 ) , whereas no significant difference between genders was observed in the scores of the ess questionnaire on sleepiness and the ghq on mental health .
we identified 25 subjects ( 12.3 %) with a clinical suspicion of osas .
none of the workers reached the level of 17 points on the ess scale , considered to be the cut - off point for greater diagnostic specificity .
only 3 workers with suspected osas were affected by mild sleepiness ( ess score > 10 ) .
two of the latter had parameters indicating a complete metabolic syndrome ( obesity , plus two other metabolic disorders ) .
in data regarding ms only , 50 subjects ( 24.5 %) presented one or more risk factors ( obesity , dyslipidemia , hypertension , or diabetes ) .
the prevalence of workers with suspect osas having at least one ms components was 52.0 % .
logistic regression analysis showed that clinical suspicion of osas was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic disorders ( or = 3.83 ; 95 % ci 1.45 - 10.13 ) in a model that included other personal factors ( sex , age , smoking habit , alcohol consumption , and sedentary life ) .
age , male gender and lack of physical activity were significantly associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome components ( table 2 ) .

workers with osas had a significantly increased risk of having a ghq12 score in the highest quartile , ( or = 4.67 ; 95 % ci = 1.72 - 12.64 ) in a multivariate logistic regression model that included age , gender , smoking habit , alcohol use , and physical activity ( table 3 ) .

a worker with severe systolic - diastolic hypertension resistant to therapy had been diagnosed with osas .
effective treatment of osas with continuous positive airway pressure for 3 months had significantly reduced blood pressure .
two workers with abdominal obesity had received confirmation of the osas diagnosis and were following positive airway pressure therapy associated with nutritional therapy .
one worker had the osas diagnosis confirmed and had been treated with mandibular advance device therapy .
in the case of another worker who had undergone further medical investigations , the diagnosis of osas had been ruled out .
the majority of workers ( 20 / 25 = 80 %) had not heeded the invitation of the occupational physician and had not carried out any further investigation .
the reasons most frequently given for failing to adhere to the invitation were lack of time , lack of health service availability , and especially the conviction that they were in a satisfactory state of health .
discussion the present study confirms that obstructive sleep apnea is a rather frequent and underdiagnosed condition , and that daytime sleepiness is not uncommon .
this is very worrisome .
reduction in vigilance and attention could be fatal in some job categories such as drivers and operators of dangerous machines .
moreover , the risk of cardiovascular disease and the psychological problems associated with osas could lead to serious health consequences .
although this is a small - scale study , our assumptions are also valid for selected populations .
as we know , the occupational physician can only examine healthy workers .
in fact , medical examination in the workplace is not possible during illness , even when it is of short duration .
this can cause an undervaluation of the workers' state of illness .
moreover , workers are selected from the general population .
in fact , the so - called " healthy worker effect " refers precisely to the fact that the occupational population have a better level of health than the general population .
although we tested a selected population , we found a 12.3 % prevalence of suspected osas , and 4.3 % of workers reported feeling very drowsy during work .
in this sample , 24.5 % suffered from obesity , or high blood pressure , diabetes or dyslipidemia .
osas was significantly associated with these metabolic disorders .
the cross - sectional nature of these observations prevents us from making causal considerations , however a recent review [ 19 ] shows that obesity predisposes to osas , and the increasing prevalence of osas is influenced by the worldwide ongoing epidemic of obesity [ 20 ] .
it has been observed , indeed , that obesity and osas tend to cluster in the same workplace [ 21 ] .
many markers of cardiovascular risk , such as sympathetic activation , systemic inflammation , and endothelial dysfunction , are significantly increased in obese patients with osas compared to those without osas [ 22 ] - [ 25 ] .
this fact suggests that osas is not simply an epiphenomenon of obesity .
moreover , findings from animal models and patients with osas show that intermittent hypoxia exacerbates the metabolic dysfunction of obesity , augmenting insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
in patients with the metabolic syndrome , osas is independently associated with increased glucose and triglyceride levels as well as markers of inflammation , arterial stiffness , and atherosclerosis [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
several cohort studies have consistently shown that osas is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality , independent of obesity [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] .
taken together , these results support the concept that osa exacerbates the cardiometabolic risk attributed to obesity and metabolic syndrome .
however , it has been demonstrated that recognition and treatment of osas may decrease the cardiovascular risk in patients with metabolic syndrome [ 33 ] - [ 36 ] .
an interesting result of our study was the association observed between suspected osas and psychological problems .
to our knowledge , this aspect has never been studied in previous research on patients with suspected osas although this syndrome is known to be linked to a number of complications such as psychiatric conditions that significantly impair the quality of life .
for example , osas may be associated with depression in adolescents and with down syndrome in young adults [ 37 ] .
these macroscopic effects are the result of deep physiological alterations .
in fact , at cellular level , osas can cause intermittent hypoxia , hormonal imbalance , and / or systemic inflammation which may influence cognitive functions [ 38 ] .
however , in patients with osas , mental fatigue and cognitive impairment are directly correlated to the severity of nocturnal disordered breathing [ 39 ] .
clearly , the severity of the pathology is very important because a cognitive consequence is expected only in severe and advanced cases , not in recently diagnosed osas patients with minimal co - morbidities [ 40 ] , or in suspected cases identified during screening .
mood disorders in patients with osas have also been studied , especially in relation to the way in which these problems may affect adherence to treatment ; however the nature of the relationship between osas and depression and anxiety is still unclear [ 41 ] .
in fact , recent research on depression and anxiety in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome led to inconsistent findings : prevalence figures fluctuated considerably for both depression ( 7 - 63 %) and anxiety ( 11 - 70 %) [ 42 ] .
moreover , the reported associations were often contrasting .
in some cross - sectional studies , osas patients had higher scores for depression and anxiety than the control group [ 43 ] , while in other studies , osas was not associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 44 ] .
these differences are probably due to the methods used to measure psychological disorders .
in the present study , we used a particularly sensitive tool to measure mental health .
the ghq is possibly the most common assessment of mental well - being [ 45 ] .
in fact , it is used to detect minor psychiatric ( non - psychotic ) disorders in the general population and within community or non - psychiatric clinical settings .
it focuses on two main areas : inability to carry out normal functions and the appearance of new and distressing psychological phenomena .
the ghq assesses the respondent 's current state and determines whether it differs from his or her usual state .
therefore , it is sensitive to short - term psychiatric disorders , but not to long - standing attributes of the respondent .
this instrument , which was designed to detect psychiatric morbidity , has also performed very well in trans - cultural comparisons of community - based populations [ 46 ] .
we can therefore assume that the ghq measures an early , and possibly transient worsening of psychological conditions in workers with recent onset of sleep apnea .
we conclude , in accordance with the literature , that the relationships between early - stage osa and psychological disturbances are weak but significant .
in our study , prevalence values for metabolic syndrome were lower than those estimated in the general italian population and other industrialized countries .
the third national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes iii ) recorded a 21.8 % prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the total population [ 47 ] .
in nhanes iii the prevalence of abdominal obesity was approximately 50 % in females and 30 % in males .
this was also higher than the value found in our study , as were the us population levels of impaired hdl - cholesterol , hyperglycemia and hypertension .
the few data available for italy confirm that metabolic syndrome and its components occur more frequently than was observed in our sample .
the italian longitudinal study on aging ( ilsa ) reported a metabolic syndrome prevalence of 25.9 % [ 48 ] .
a study conducted in the marche region of italy found a metabolic syndrome prevalence of 11.5 % in the 36 to 42 age group and of 22.5 % in subjects between the age of 43 and 60 years [ 49 ] .
this demonstrated that in our sample group at least , the health level of employees was higher than that of the general population - a fact that must be taken into account in the planning of action for health .
it also indicated that the subjects taking part in our study were not prompted in because they were suffering from one of the pathologies under investigation .
this was important since we know that being affected by any morbid condition induces individuals to be more precise when recalling all the possible causal factors for that illness .
this phenomenon , known as " recall bias " , can give rise to fictitious associations .
compared with what may occur in case - control studies , the limited number of sick subjects in our survey reduced the impact of such an effect .
unfortunately , in our study , the majority of workers with suspected osas failed to respond to advice suggesting they undergo other tests to confirm the diagnosis .
in the few cases in which subjects followed the advice of the occupational physician , a significant clinical improvement was observed .
this experience demonstrated that health promotion during compulsory health surveillance is effective in only a limited number of workers .
the main reason for ignoring the physician 's advice seemed to be unawareness on the part of the workers of the importance of the detrimental effects of osas .
a multilevel effort that includes specific information about the health risks associated with osas and incentives for workers who participate in the programs proposed , might effectively help to safeguard workers' health .
since small enterprises lack financial resources and training structures , these services must be provided by public or consortium facilities .
the main limitation of this study concerned sample selection , as all the companies were located in the same region and were under the health surveillance of the same doctor ( nm ) .
these conditions obviously prevented us from extending our findings to other situations .
one of the strengths of the study was the high level of participation at baseline .
another strength was the inclusion of general workers in the study population .
previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors of occupational osas had mainly targeted at - risk workers , so that results were not applicable to a more general population of workers .
a further strength was the broad set of clinical issues examined ; these included an objective evaluation of the risk of osas , an assessment of sleepiness , blood tests and clinical examination to diagnose metabolic syndrome and screening for psychological disorders .
all these tests were included during the routine medical surveillance of workers without a significant burden of time for the performance of medical examinations .
the data collected show that osas is an important risk factor that is widely prevalent in the general population of workers , and that this syndrome is strongly correlated with metabolic syndrome and mental disorders .
it is therefore an ideal candidate for health intervention .
health promotion programs conducted in small enterprises and based exclusively on services provided by the nhs , without a spending commitment for training and incentives on the part of employers , have a beneficial but limited impact on the health of workers .
only a few workers accepted the invitation of the occupational physician to undergo more specialized tests to confirm or refute the diagnosis of osas .
however , excellent results were obtained for those who followed this advice .
we are confident that a prevention program comprising educational , health and organizational activities could actually prevent osas and its physical and psychological consequences in the general population of workers .

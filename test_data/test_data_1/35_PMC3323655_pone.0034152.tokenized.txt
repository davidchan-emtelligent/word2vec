background alopecia is the common hair loss problem that can affect many people .
however , current therapies for treatment of alopecia are limited by low efficacy and potentially undesirable side effects .
we have identified a new function for valproic acid ( vpa ) , a gsk3beta inhibitor that activates the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , to promote hair re - growth in vitro and in vivo .
methodology / principal findings topical application of vpa to male c3h mice critically stimulated hair re - growth and induced terminally differentiated epidermal markers such as filaggrin and loricrin , and the dermal papilla marker alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) .
vpa induced alp in human dermal papilla cells by up - regulating the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , whereas minoxidil ( mnx ) , a drug commonly used to treat alopecia , did not significantly affect the wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
vpa analogs and other gsk3beta inhibitors that activate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway such as 4 - phenyl butyric acid , licl , and becl2 also exhibited hair growth - promoting activities in vivo .
importantly , vpa , but not mnx , successfully stimulate hair growth in the wounds of c3h mice .
conclusions / significance our findings indicate that small molecules that activate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , such as vpa , can potentially be developed as drugs to stimulate hair re - growth .
introduction alopecia causes serious problems for numerous people in the world .
however , current therapies for the treatment of alopecia are limited by low efficacy and potentially undesirable side effects caused by application of available drugs [ 1 ] .
the wnt / beta - catenin pathway is important for several developmental processes , including hair follicle development [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway is required for initiation of hair follicle formation [ 5 ] , and stimulates growth and differentiation of hair by maintaining expression of genes that function at the anagen phase of the hair cycle [ 6 ] .
wnt3a and wnt7a maintain dermal papillae in anagen phase as inductive signals for hair growth [ 6 ] .
in addition , beta - catenin accumulates in the nuclei of dermal papillae during anagen , and provides growth signals for hair follicle progenitors [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
finally , the wnt / beta - catenin pathway plays a role in the differentiation of stem cells into hair follicular keratinocytes [ 9 ] .
together , these findings indicate that the wnt / beta - catenin pathway could be an ideal target for the development of drugs that activate hair growth by inducing anagen phase genes .
unfortunately , there are currently no known drugs that stimulate hair growth by targeting the wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
valproic acid ( vpa ; 2 - propyl - pentanoic acid ) is a mood stabilizer commonly prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorders over the last several decades [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
vpa is known as a histone deacetylase inhibitor that exerts its effects through modification of chromatin structure and gene expression [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
vpa is also known to affect several different signaling pathways including protein kinase c , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) , and wnt / beta - catenin pathways [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .
vpa activates the wnt / beta - catenin pathway by inhibiting gsk3beta [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , leading to axonal remodeling , synaptic protein clustering , and differentiation of neuronal progenitors [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
we investigated the effect of vpa on the hair re - growth of c3h mice by considering the relationship between the wnt / beta - catenin pathway and hair formation .
vpa induced hair re - growth as efficiently as mnx and activated the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in vivo .
the potential importance of vpa in human hair re - growth was indicated by the increased expression of alp and activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway following treatment of vpa in human dermal papilla cells .
alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , a prominent dermal papilla marker [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] , was identified as a critical marker for hair growth promotion .
the role of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in the regulation of alp activity was further investigated by testing vpa analogs and other wnt activators in vivo and in vitro .
finally , we further characterized specific roles of vpa in induced hair growth in the wounds of c3h mice .
these vpa effects accompanying the activation of keratin 15 and cd34 stem cell markers also correlate with the wnt / beta - catenin pathway and alp activities .
materials and methods reagents vpa , 4 - phenyl butyric acid ( pba ) , and 2 - ethyl butyric acid ( eba ) were purchased from acros .
lithium chloride ( licl ) and beryllium chloride ( becl2 ) were purchased from sigma , and mnx was purchased from daejung .
animals and in vivo hair growth test six - wk - old male c3h mice were purchased from orient bio co. , and allowed to adapt to their new environment for 1 wk. the hairs on the backs of 7 - wk - old mice , whose hair follicles were in telogen phase , were shaved with a hair clipper and 300 microl of each drug at an appropriate concentration ( as described in figure legends ) was applied topically daily for up to 28 d. all reagents used for the hair re - growth test were dissolved in a vehicle composed of 50 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol , 30 % water , and 20 % propylene glycol .
top - gal transgenic mice carrying the lac z reporter gene downstream of the c - fos promoter that responds to the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 / transcription factor 3 ( lef / tcf ) mediated signaling pathway and activated beta - catenin were purchased from the jackson laboratory .
genotyping was confirmed by standard polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) using the following primers : transgene forward 5 ' - atcctctgcatggtcaggtc - 3 ' , transgene reverse 5 ' - cgtggcctgattcattcc - 3 ' ; internal positive control forward 5 ' - caaatgttgcttgtctggtg - 3 ' , internal positive control reverse 5 ' - gtcagtcgagtgcacagttt - 3 ' .

quantitative histomorphometry hair cycle stages were evaluated and classified as described [ 24 ] by the means of quantitative histomorphometry .
histomorphomety was performed with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) - stained sections that were taken from defined back skin regions .
at least 50 hair follicles per mouse per group were evaluated .
cell culture human dermal papilla cells were obtained from dr. jin - ho jung in the department of dermatology at seoul national university , and maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) containing 10 % ( vol / vol ) fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and supplemented with 0.1 mg / ml g418 ( gibco - brl ) .
cells were plated at a density of 6x105 cells per 10 - cm diameter dish .
western blotting analysis cells or tissue that was ground in mortars were lysed in ripa buffer ( 150 mm nacl , 10 mm tris , ph 7.2 , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , 1.0 % triton x - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 5 mm edta ) .
samples were separated on 10 - 12 % sds polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a protran ( r ) nitrocellulose membrane ( schleicher and schuell co. ) .
after blocking in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) containing 5 % non - fat dry skim milk and 0.07 % ( vol / vol ) tween 20 , the blots were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4degreesc : anti - beta - catenin ( santa cruz biotechnology , 1:1000 ) , p - erk ( santa cruz biotechnology , 1:1000 ) , p - akt ( santa cruz biotechnology , 1:1000 ) , fillagrin ( covance , berkeley , ca , 1:1000 ) , loricrin ( covance , 1:1000 ) , keratin 14 ( covance , 1:1000 ) , alpha - tubulin ( oncogene research products , 1:5000 ) , pcna ( proliferating - cell nuclear antigen , santa cruz biotechnology , 1:500 ) , bmp4 ( r & d systems , 1:500 ) , and alp ( abcam , 1:100 ) .

results valproic acid promotes hair re - growth and induces terminally differentiated hair markers in vivo we tested the hair re - growth activity of licl and vpa , two chemical activators of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
vpa or licl was topically applied daily onto the backs of c3h mice at different concentrations to determine the optimal concentration for each agent .
mnx was separately applied as a positive control .
the mice treated with 1 m licl or 500 mm vpa showed hair growth phenotypes ( figures s1a and s1b ) .
especially , vpa promoted hair re - growth as efficiently as mnx after 28 d ( figure 1a ) .
the hair follicles of mice treated with vpa or mnx entered anagen phase , whereas hair follicles in the control group treated with vehicle solution remained in telogen phase ( figure 1a , data for different drug treatment times are shown in figure s2a ) .
the histomorphometrical analyses showed that vpa promoted telogen - anagen transition ( figure 1b ) .
especially , the hair follicles of mice treated with vpa were transformed to middle - or late - anagen ( figure 1b ) .
immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that expression of filaggrin and loricrin was increased by vpa or mnx ( figure 2a , data for different drug treatment times are shown in figures s2b and s2c ) .
we did not observe any significant abnormal phenotypes in the epidermis , hair follicles , or other skin structures aside from hair re - growth following application of vpa or mnx ( figure 1a ) .
in contrast to the epidermis of mouse skin treated with vpa , skin that was treated with licl revealed critical abnormal changes including an increase in the thickness of the epidermis ( figure s3 ) , where expression of filaggrin , loricrin , and keratin 14 was also abnormally elevated as shown by immunohistochemistry ( figure s3 ) .
valproic acid activates the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in addition to the erk and akt pathways the expression of beta - catenin in mouse skin was significantly increased by application of vpa , but only slightly increased by mnx ( figure 2a ) .
mnx is known to promote hair re - growth via the erk and akt pathways , which are involved in the regulation of proliferation in dermal papilla cells of the hair follicle [ 27 ] .
interestingly , the activities of both erk and akt were similarly enhanced by treatment with either vpa or mnx ( figure 2a ) .
the expression level of the proliferation marker pcna was increased by application of vpa or mnx compared to control skin ( figure 2a ) .
thus , vpa up - regulates the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in addition to the erk and akt pathways , but via a different mechanism .
to examine the short - term effects of vpa on hair re - growth , we analyzed the skin of c3h mice after application of vpa or mnx for 7 d. the thickness of the epidermis increased slightly and the number of hair follicles increased 7 d after application of vpa or mnx ( figure s4a , upper panel ) .
immunohistochemical analysis showed that keratin14 expression was increased following a 7 d application of vpa or mnx ( figure s4a , lower panel ) , although the level of keratin14 was not changed 28 d application of vpa or mnx ( figure 2a ) .
interestingly , vpa , but not mnx , greatly increased the expression of beta - catenin in the hair follicles of c3h mice ( figure 2b ) .
we also observed significant induction of alp in the dermal papilla following application of vpa , but not mnx ( figures 2b and s4b ) .
moreover , we confirmed specific activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in the pre - cortex regions [ 4 ] of the skin of top - gal wnt reporter mice treated for 7 d with vpa , but not mnx ( figure s4c ) .
interestingly , keratin 15 and cd34 , the hair follicular stem cell markers , were induced in bulge cells by application of vpa for 7 d ( figure 2c ) , but not by application of mnx .
valproic acid , but not mnx , up - regulates the wnt / beta - catenin pathway and alp activity in human dermal papilla cells to identify whether vpa can activate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in human systems , we used an in vitro culture system of human dermal papilla cells .
the expression level of beta - catenin was greatly increased by treatment with vpa , but not mnx for 72 h ( figures 3a and s5 ) .
similarly , expression of both bmp4 and alp was increased by vpa , but not mnx ( figures 3a and s5 ) .
we also confirmed significant activation of beta - catenin and bmp4 in human dermal papilla cells treated with vpa by immunocytochemistry , and again those changes were not observed following treatment with mnx ( figure 3b ) .
to evaluate the effect of vpa or mnx on the regulation of alp activity , we used human dermal papilla cells at passage 11 that showed very weak alp activity .
we observed a significant increase in alp activity following treatment with vpa , but not mnx ( figure 3c ) .
moreover , the induction of alp activity by vpa was blocked by noggin , a bmp4 antagonist ( figure 3d ) .
to confirm the role of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in the activation of alp , we measured the effects of wnt3a , bmp4 , or epidermal growth factor ( egf ) ligand on alp .
expression of both alp and beta - catenin was significantly increased by treatment with wnt3a or bmp4 in a concentration - dependent manner , whereas these changes were not significantly induced by treatment with egf ( figure 3e ) .
the specific activation of alp by wnt3a and bmp was also confirmed by a direct enzyme assay ( figure 3f ) .
activators of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway promote hair re - growth in vivo to confirm the role of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in hair re - growth , we tested the effects of drugs that regulate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway on hair re - growth in mice .
beryllium chloride ( becl2 ) , licl ( an alternative gsk3beta inhibitor ) , and several derivatives of vpa including 4 - phenyl butyric acid ( pba ) and 2 - ethyl butyric acid ( eba ) were tested for their effects on hair re - growth .
pba or eba induced hair re - growth after topical application to the back of c3h mice for 28 d ( figure 4a , first row panel ) .
the levels of beta - catenin were increased by treatment with pba , but not eba ( figure 4a , second row panel ) .
the hair follicles of skin tissues treated with pba or eba entered anagen phase as shown by h & e staining ( figure 4a , third row panel ) .
histomorphometrical analysis revealed that pba and eba also induced telogen - anagen transition ( figure 4b ) .
licl or becl2 also induced hair re - growth after 35 d although its hair growing activity was mild ( figure s6a , first row panel ) .
treatment with licl or becl2 increased the levels of beta - catenin and accelerated hair cycle into the anagen phase ( figure s6a , second row panel and third row panel ) .
however , the thickness of the epidermis was increased in skin treated with becl2 or pba compared to control skin , as previously described for licl application .
the expression of filaggrin and loricrin was abnormally increased by application of becl2 , similar to the effect of licl ( figure s6b ) .
however , the activities of erk and akt were increased by treatment with all of the drugs , including eba ( figures s6c and s7 ) .
alp activity was increased by treatment with vpa or pba , which also up - regulated the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in human dermal papilla ( figure 5a ) .
interestingly , treatment with eba , which did not affect the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , did not significantly increase alp activity ( figure 5a ) .
in addition , the protein and mrna levels of alp were increased following treatment with vpa or pba , which also increased the protein level of beta - catenin , but not by treatment with mnx or eba ( figures 5b , 5c , and s8 ) .
expression of bmp4 mrna was increased by treatment with vpa , but was only marginally increased by treatment with mnx or pba and was not induced at all by eba .
expression of bmp6 , which induces the most pronounced effects on alp activation among the bmps [ 28 ] , was markedly increased by either vpa or pba but not by mnx or eba ( figure 5c ) .
the specific activation of alp by vpa or pba was also confirmed by a direct enzyme assay ( figure 5d ) .
the mouse model showed similar phenotypes to those observed in human dermal papilla cells ; the levels of beta - catenin in the epidermis and alp in dermal papillae were significantly increased by application of vpa or pba for 7 d , but were not changed by application of mnx or eba ( figures s9a and s9b ) .
valproic acid promotes hair growth in cutaneous wounds in mice activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in epidermal keratinocytes can potentially induce hair growth in mouse skin that is damaged by wounding [ 29 ] .
to test the effectiveness of vpa on wound - induced hair growth , we daily applied vpa to the wound area ( diameter = 0.5 mm ) of c3h mice .
the presence of epithelial stem cells in hair follicles around wound areas induces spontaneous hair cycling as previously reported [ 30 ] , and vpa further significantly enhanced hair growth ( figures 6a and s10a ) and the transition from telogen phase to anagen phase at the wound site as revealed by histological analysis ( figure 6b ) .
the expression levels of fillaggrin , loricrin , and keratin 14 in wounds was also specifically increased by application of vpa for 14 d by both immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses ( figures 6c and 6d ) .
moreover , vpa specifically activated the wnt / beta - catenin pathway during hair growth at wound sites , as shown by increased beta - catenin expression ( figures 6c and 6d ) and induction of beta - galactosidase in newly formed hair follicles of top - gal wnt reporter mice ( figure s10b ; representative mice hairg growth phenotypes by drug application are shown in figure s10c ) .
importantly , we also observed an increase in alp activity in the hair follicles following application of vpa ( figure 6e ) .
keratin 15 and cd34 , the hair follicular stem cell markers , were increased after 25 d of vpa application to the wounds ( figure 6f ) .
discussion vpa is an antiepileptic drug frequently prescribed due to its safety and effectiveness [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
prolonged use of vpa resulted in several side effects including hair loss by oral intake ; these adverse effects are attributed to zinc and biotinidase depletion [ 31 ] .
we did not observe hair re - growth effects when vpa was orally administered to c57bl / 6 mice ( figures s11a and s11b ) .
however , topical application of vpa significantly promoted hair formation in murine models .
the levels of beta - catenin in the mice skin were specifically increased by topical application of vpa ( figure s11c ) .
in this study , we demonstrated that gsk3beta inhibitors that activate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 32 ] could potentially be developed as drugs to treat hair loss and baldness involving defects in hair follicles .
among these , vpa was identified as the most potent hair re - growth factor without causing skin abnormalities in mice .
alternative inhibitors of gsk3beta , licl or becl2 , also stimulated hair re - growth and returned the hair cycle to the anagen phase , but abnormally increased the thickness of the epidermis with hyper - activation of terminally differentiated epidermal markers .
in contrast to the epidermis of mouse skin treated with other gsk3beta inhibitor , skin of c3h mice treated with vpa did n't reveal any significant abnormal phenotypes in the epidermis .
we found that alp is a highly credible marker for activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , and importance of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in the activation of alp was confirmed by the demonstration that alp was not regulated by mnx or eba , which did not induce expression of beta - catenin and bmp4 .
it is known that vpa stimulates neuronal differentiation of neural progenitors through the induction of bmp4 [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , and the effect of bmp4 on hair - inducing activity was also previously reported [ 28 ] .
our study reporting that bmp4 plays a role as an activator of alp further confirms the importance of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway in hair re - growth .
although the relative effect was small compared to vpa or pba , eba ( which did not activate beta - catenin and bmp4 or alp ) , still induced hair formation .
these results indicate that the hair - inducing activity of eba may be independent of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , and in fact we confirmed that eba induced activation of erk and akt , which are in turn involved in keratinocyte proliferation .
interestingly , vpa induced expression of the hair follicular stem cell markers ketatin 15 and cd34 during hair formation and wound - induced growth .
vpa is known to induce cd34 expression and enhance stemness [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
the bald scalps of men with androgenetic alopecia lack cd200 - rich , cd34 - positive hair follicle progenitor cells , and have a defect in conversion of hair follicle stem cells to progenitor cells , which play a role in the pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia [ 37 ] .
the results of our study indicate that small molecules that activate the wnt / beta - catenin pathway , such as vpa , can potentially be applied for the development of drugs to accelerate hair cycle and stimulate hair re - growth .

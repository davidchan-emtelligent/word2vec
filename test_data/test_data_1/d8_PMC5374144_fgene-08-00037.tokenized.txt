cystic fibrosis cftr mutations genetic screening egyptian patients cystic fibrosis ( cf ) is the most common lethal rare genetic disease in the caucasian populations .
it is caused by a variety of sequence alterations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( cftr ) gene .
in caucasian , one over 3,500 new born children suffers from the disease and one over 30 of them is at least carrier of a severe mutation in the cftr gene .
cf and cftr - related disorders ( cftr - rds ) are two distinct clinical outcomes of the gene mutations .
the cf mutation induces a severe phenotype involving different organs , whereas a cftr - rd mutation induces less life - threatening symptoms with three main clinical entities including congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens ( cbavd ) , acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis , and disseminated bronchiectasis ( bombieri et al. , 2011 ) .
in the arab countries , the spectrum of cf mutations , incidence and prevalence of the disease are largely unknown in the arab populations ( wei et al. , 2006 ) .
this is due to the lack of disease awareness , and diagnosis facilities that mislead the identification of cf during many decades .
additionally , epidemiological studies that realized were revealed a distinguished mutational spectrum between arab countries if compared to white - european populations .
furthermore , arab mediterranean countries have a different cftr mutational profile if compared to the arabian peninsula .
egypt as mediterranean north african country , this strategic position attracted many invaders throughout its history .
therefore , in addition to its pharaonic origin , gene flow to its population occurred from the ethiopian , greco - roman , arab , turkish , french and english settlers ( temtamy et al. , 2010 ) .
the common heritage among the countries bordering the mediterranean is not restricted to historical or cultural aspects .
there are considerable commonalities in the gene pools of the mediterranean northern and southern countries .
this " genetic sharing " has resulted from considerable human movements ( i.e. , migration , invasion , and trade ) throughout history in this area ( temtamy et al. , 2010 ) .
consequently , egypt is not like other arab countries and mutations in the cftr gene have been influenced by gene flow coming from different populations .
furthermore , the high rate of consanguinity , infant and neonatal mortality in the egyptian society will , therefore , increase cf incidence and private mutations .
indeed , another important issue is the increase number of cftr - related disorders patients such as idiopathic bronchiectasis , congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens , idiopathic ( non - alcoholic ) pancreatitis , and severe sinusitis in the egyptian population .
this observation is in agreement with data previously published ( lissens et al. , 1999 ; hussein et al. , 2011 ; fathy et al. , 2016 ) .
in egypt , there is no available data on the nature and frequency of cf gene mutations .
there are a few previous reports of cftr gene mutations in egyptian patients that have been published .
in these papers , a cf screening strategy of cftr mutations was realized using commercial kits or a panel defined by the american college of medical genetics and genomics ( acmg ) and american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) , ( naguib et al. , 2007 ; el - falaki et al. , 2014 ; fathy et al. , 2016 ; shahin et al. , 2016 ) , which is not suitable for screening of the cftr gene mutations in the egyptian population .
this emphasizes the need for establishing a correct genetic screening for cf mutations in egyptian patients and to determine the carrier status in their healthy relatives .
in our recent study , we have performed a complete cftr gene screening in cf or cftr - rd patients from alexandria , northern egypt , by direct sequencing of the entire cftr gene that identified four novel cf mutations in the cftr gene amongst 13 other known mutations in the other populations ( figure 1a ) .
furthermore , this is the first comprehensive profile of cftr gene mutations and their corresponding haplotypes in the egyptian population ( el - seedy et al. , 2016 ) .
besides , cftr mutations in the other egyptian regions have not been analyzed .
thus , the identification of cftr mutations is become increasingly important in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis particularly in families with multiple affected children ( wang et al. , 2000 ) .
figure 1 mutational spectrum of cftr gene mutations in the egyptian population .
( a ) cftr mutations identified in our recent investigation of egyptian cf or cftr - rd patients from alexandria city , northern egypt which performed a complete cftr gene screening by direct sequencing of the entire cftr gene .
this study is the first to identify novel mutations ( indicated with a star *) in the egyptian population amongst 13 other known mutations that appear to be a specific to egyptian cf patients ( 2 ) ; ( b ) a panel of the most common mutations detected in the egyptian population ; ( c ) intronic mutations identified in the egyptian patients that will be also present in the panel .
according to available data of cftr gene mutations , we propose general national screening panel comprising 27 mutations reported in egyptian patients until now .
this will help to detect about 50 % of cftr gene mutations in egypt and further extensive studies will help to improve this panel .
the establishment of the first panel of the cftr gene mutations in the egyptian population ( figures 1b,c ) will help physicians for designing an appropriate strategy for future genetic diagnosis for patients and families at risk .
in this regard , defining a population - specific mutational panel for cf in egyptian population including : c.92g > a ( exon 2 ) , c.454a > t ( exon 4 ) , c.902a > g ( exon 8 ) , c.1418delg ( exon 11 ) , c.2620 - 15c > g ( intron 15 ) , c.2782g > c ( exon 17 ) , c.2997 _ 3000delaatt ( exon 19 ) , c.3154t > g ( exon 20 ) , c.3718 - 24g > a ( intron 23 ) , c.3872a > g ( exon 23 ) , c.3877g > a ( exon 24 ) , c.4207a > g ( exon 26 ) , c.4242 + 10t > c ( intron 26 ) mutations identified in our recent study ( figure 1a ) , and together with previously reported mutations in egyptian patients ( figures 1b,c ) [ c.1766 + 3a > c ( intron 13 ) , c.1993a > t ( exon 14 ) , c.3909c > g ( exon21 ) , c.1521 _ 1523delctt ( exon11 ) , ( naguib et al. , 2007 ) ; c.54 - 5940 _ 273 + 10250del21kb ( intron 1 - exon 3 ) , c.443t > c ( exon 4 ) , c.1040g > c ( exon8 ) , c.1364c > a ( exon10 ) , c.1652g > a ( exon12 ) , c.2051 _ 2052delaainsg ( exon 14 ) , c.3067 _ 3072delatagtg ( exon19 ) , c.3484c > t ( exon 22 ) , c.3846g > a ( exon 23 ) , ( shahin et al. , 2016 ) ; c.1040g > c ( exon 8 ) , c.1364c > a ( exon 10 ) , c.3484c > t ( exon 22 ) , c.3752g > a ( exon 23 ) , c.3846g > a ( exon 23 ) , ( fathy et al. , 2016 )] should be highly recommended for egyptian patients .
however , full clinical manifestations of additional cf and cftr - rds patients could lead to clarify the pathogenicity of these mutants in this population .
the overall purpose of this paper , in our opinion , is to develop and validate a strategy for increasing the sensitivity of cftr screening in egyptian population .
this strategy includes establishing of an egyptian cf registry network ( ecfrn ) where there is no reliable estimates on the number of cf patients and clinical pattern as well as the most common cftr mutations in this population .
hence , this registry is essential in order to have data about prevalence and incidence of cf in egypt for improving clinic diagnostic outcomes and planning health policies .
in addition , an extensive molecular analysis of cftr gene using next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) technology combined with multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification ( mlpa ) will provide a wider coverage of the cftr locus and expand our proposed panel in cf molecular diagnosis .
in summary , our findings confirm the importance of direct gene sequencing of the entire cftr gene in combination with molecular and functional studies ( in isolation and in complex alleles ) in order to perform a correct genetic counseling and to estimate the prevalence of the carriers in the general population .
moreover , collaborative studies , on the clinical and fundamental levels , are necessary to give an adequate genotype - phenotype correlation .
thus , sharing the obtained data between cftr laboratories , clinical research centers and concerned communities in egypt are also from a great importance to ensure a progression in mutation researches and to help clinicians in giving a suitable prenatal diagnosis , patients advising and treatments prescription when available .

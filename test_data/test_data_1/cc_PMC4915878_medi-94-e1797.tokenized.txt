http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract the aim of the present study was to investigate the age - related patterns and the relationship between levels of urinary cross - linked n - telopeptide of type - i collagen ( ntx ) and heel stiffness index measured by quantitative ultrasound ( qus ) in men with a special reference to age groups of aged 40 to 59 years and >= 60 years .
a total of 379 men participated in this study .
heel stiffness index ( bone mass ) was measured by qus .
spot urine samples were collected , and urinary ntx was measured .
the values were corrected for creatinine ( cre ) concentration .
stiffness index was significantly lower in men aged >= 60 years compared with men aged 40 to 59 years ( p < 0.0001 ) .
there was no significant difference of log ( ntx / cre ) by 10 - year age groups .
multiple regression analysis showed that higher level of urinary ntx / cre was significantly correlated with lower stiffness index after adjusting for age and body mass index in men aged >= 60 years , but not in men aged 40 to 59 years .
higher rates of bone resorption were associated with lower stiffness index only in elderly men .
our results may indicate a different mechanism of low bone mass among different age groups .
open - accesstrue introduction osteoporosis and resulting fractures impair the activities of daily living and quality of life , leading to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly.1,2 although osteoporosis is more common in women , men have substantial age - related decreases in bone mineral density ( bmd ). 3 - 5 thus , osteoporosis in men is also a significant public health problem because of the rapid aging of society .
cross - linked n - telopeptide of type - i collagen ( ntx ) is one of the biochemical markers of bone resorption , and is widely used in clinical situations to evaluate the indication and efficacy of treatments for osteoporosis.6 - 8 previous studies showed that the serum or urinary concentration of ntx increased after menopause in women.5,9 - 11 from 40 years on , age - related patterns of ntx in men have been controversial .
some studies reported that ntx increased with age,10,12 but the others reported that ntx was stable.5,13 - 15 several studies reported that ntx correlated inversely and significantly with bmd at some skeletal sites in men,10,13 but these correlations were weaker than those in women.10 on the contrary , data on relationship between bone turnover marker and bone quantitative ultrasound ( qus ) measurement are limited , especially in men .
qus is a developed promising technique for evaluation of fracture risk and bone mineral status .
in addition to the features of portability , relatively low cost , and ease to use , qus is also free from ionizing radiation and provides information on bone structure.16 therefore , qus has been widely used in japan for screening patients at high risk of osteoporotic fractures.17,18 recently , boonen et al19 showed that higher levels of bone markers serum n - terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen and beta - isomerized c - terminal telopeptides were significantly associated with lower qus parameters among men aged 40 to 79 years ; however , the study was conducted among combining middle - aged and elderly men .
thus , the relationship between ntx and bone mass ( qus ) in men is still unclear , and there were few studies with references to age groups.20 the aim of the present study was to investigate the age - related patterns and the relationship between levels of urinary ntx and heel stiffness index measured by qus in men with a special reference to age groups ( 40 - 59 years , and >= 60 years ) .
methods the subjects were community - dwelling men aged >= 40 years at nagasaki prefecture , japan , who were invited to participate in periodic health examinations in 2006 to 2009 .
a total of 379 men participated in this study .
all subjects gave written informed consent before examination .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of nagasaki university .
heel stiffness index ( bone mass ) by qus was measured using a lunar achilles device ( ge lunar corp. , madison , wi ) .
spot urine samples ( 8:00 - 10:00 am ) were collected .
urinary ntx , a marker of bone resorption , was measured with enzyme immunoassay .
the values were corrected for creatinine ( cre ) concentration .
height ( m ) and weight ( kg ) were measured with light clothing and without shoes , and body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight ( kg )/ height2 ( m2 ) .
statistical analysis the data were analyzed using the statistical analysis system software package version 9.2 ( sas institute , cary , nc ) .
because ntx / cre was not normally distributed , ntx / cre was treated as log ( ntx / cre ) .
student t test was used to examine the difference in variables between the age groups .
one - way anova was used to log ( ntx / cre ) between 10 - year age groups .
simple correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between the levels of ntx / cre and stiffness index .
multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the effect of age , bmi and log ( ntx / cre ) on stiffness index .
a p value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results table 1 shows the characteristics of our 379 subjects .
weight and height were significantly smaller in men aged >= 60 years compared with men aged 40 to 59 years ( p < 0.0001 ) .
stiffness index was significantly lower in men aged >= 60 years compared with men aged 40 to 59 years ( p < 0.0001 ) .
there was no significant difference of bmi and log ( ntx / cre ) between age groups .
table 1 characteristics of the study subjects ( n = 379 ) in the one - way anova , there was no significant difference of log ( ntx / cre ) by 10 - year age groups ( p = 0.12 ) ( table 2 ) .
table 2 mean ( sd ) of log ( ntx / cre ) by age group in men aged over 60 years , there was a significant negative correlation between the levels of urinary ntx / cre and stiffness index , but not in men aged 40 to 59 years ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 ( a ) correlation between log ( ntx / cre ) and stiffness index in 40 to 59 age group ( r = 0.038 , p = 0.72 ) .
( b ) correlation between log ( ntx / cre ) and stiffness index in >= 60 age group ( r = - 0.310 , p < 0.0001 ) .
in order to assess further the independent relationship , we used a multiple regression analysis .
it showed that higher level of urinary ntx / cre was significantly correlated with lower stiffness index ( qus ) after adjusting for age and bmi in men aged >= 60 years , but not in men aged 40 to 59 years ( table 3 ) .
in addition , ntx / cre was also significantly correlated with lower stiffness index ( qus ) after adjusting for age and height / weight in men aged >= 60 years ( data not shown ) .
table 3 multiple linear regression analysis of stiffness index disucussion we showed that higher level of urinary ntx was significantly correlated with lower stiffness index ( qus ) after adjusting for age and bmi in men aged >= 60 years , but not in men aged 40 to 59 years .
boonen et al19 reported that higher levels of bone markers were significantly associated with lower qus parameters among middle - aged and elderly men combined , but did not analyze with a special reference to middle - aged or elderly men .
to the best of our knowledge , we first reported the significant correlation between ntx and stiffness index ( qus ) only in elderly men , not in middle - aged men .
we showed no significant differences of urinary ntx among 10 - year age groups , which is consistent with previous reports in men aged >= 40 years.5,14,15 in women , ntx values increase with the decline in estrogen production at the time of menopause and remain elevated thereafter.21 because men do not have the equivalent of menopause , ntx may not increase rapidly in men .
however , some studies reported increasing of ntx with age in middle - aged and elderly men.10,12 further study is needed to explore the age - related patterns of ntx in middle - aged and elderly men .
our results showed significant and negative correlation between ntx and stiffness index ( qus ) only in men aged >= 60 years .
khosla et al10 showed significant and negative association between proximal femur bmd and serum ntx in men aged >= 50 years , but not in men < 50 years .
chandani et al13 showed that higher serum ntx correlated with lower femoral neck bmd in men aged 68 to 89 years .
these findings suggest that higher rates of bone resorption are associated with lower bone mass , especially in elderly men .
in elderly men , slightly increased bone resorption is not matched by a parallel increase in bone formation , and this imbalance results in the age - related bone loss.20 unfortunately , bone formation marker was not measured in our study .
it is needed to evaluate both resorption and formation markers to understand more detailed mechanisms of osteoporosis in elderly men .
our study has several limitations .
first , because this study was cross - sectional design , our results do not necessarily show a causal relationship .
second , information on other determinants ( eg , genetic background , nutritional status , socioeconomic status , medication [ ex. corticosteroids ] , levels of vitamin d , and underlying comorbidities ) contributing to skeletal maintenance in aging men19 was not available to our study .
finally , the subjects were participants of health examination and may not be representative of the general population .
in conclusion , we showed that higher level of urinary ntx was significantly correlated with lower stiffness index ( qus ) in men aged >= 60 years , but not in men aged 40 to 59 years .
higher rates of bone resorption were associated with lower stiffness index only in elderly men .
our results may indicate different mechanisms of low stiffness index among different age groups .

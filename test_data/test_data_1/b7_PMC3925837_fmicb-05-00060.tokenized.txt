recombinant subunit vaccines are some of the safest and most effective vaccines available , but their high cost and the requirement of advanced medical infrastructure for administration make them impractical for many developing world diseases .
plant - based vaccines have shifted that paradigm by paving the way for recombinant vaccine production at agricultural scale using an edible host .
however , enthusiasm for " molecular pharming " in food crops has waned in the last decade due to difficulty in developing transgenic crop plants and concerns of contaminating the food supply .
microalgae could be poised to become the next candidate in recombinant subunit vaccine production , as they present several advantages over terrestrial crop plant - based platforms including scalable and contained growth , rapid transformation , easily obtained stable cell lines , and consistent transgene expression levels .
algae have been shown to accumulate and properly fold several vaccine antigens , and efforts are underway to create recombinant algal fusion proteins that can enhance antigenicity for effective orally delivered vaccines .
these approaches have the potential to revolutionize the way subunit vaccines are made and delivered - from costly parenteral administration of purified protein , to an inexpensive oral algae tablet with effective mucosal and systemic immune reactivity .
oral vaccines recombinant subunit vaccines microalgae plant - produced vaccines algal engineering introduction infectious diseases directly account for nearly 25 % of deaths worldwide , and are a predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world ( fauci et al. , 2005 ) .
even for diseases for which vaccines exist , limited access - due to financial as well as infrastructural or medical personnel limitations - is a major contributor to this high infectious disease burden .
many developing world diseases do not yet have vaccines , in part because traditional vaccine production costs present a significant investment hurdle , considering the financial capacity of the intended consumers .
both cost and ease of administration are challenges that must be tackled to address this undue burden on global health and productivity .
oral vaccination has many distinct advantages over parenteral administration , but has proven difficult to achieve thus far , reflected by the scarcity of licensed oral vaccines .
perhaps the most significant benefit of oral vaccination is the ability to elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity .
as most human pathogens enter via mucosal surfaces - either nasally , orally , or by sexual transmission - mucosal immunity can serve as a first line of defense to prevent infection before it reaches the bloodstream ( mason and herbst - kralovetz , 2012 ) .
oral vaccines also obviate the need for trained medical personnel to administer them and reduce the risks of infection associated with needles .
they also have higher compliance from patients , owing to the lack of fear and resistance associated with injections .
both of these latter aspects are important considerations for successful vaccination campaign coverage in remote or resource - limited settings .
plant - produced vaccines have two critical advantages : much lower cost than traditional recombinant vaccine platforms , and improved safety because of insusceptibility to mammalian pathogen contamination .
the batch costs of plant - produced vaccines may be as much as a thousand times less than traditional animal cell culture or even bacterial or yeast cell culture , though it has been noted that this will not translate directly to per - dose cost because downstream sales , packaging , and distribution costs are similar regardless of production method ( rybicki , 2009 ) .
the current status of plant - produced vaccines in pre - clinical and early phase human clinical trials has been extensively reviewed ( lossl and waheed , 2011 ; mason and herbst - kralovetz , 2012 ; rosales - mendoza et al. , 2012a,b ; guan et al. , 2013 ; jacob et al. , 2013 ) ; despite positive preliminary data , none have made it through to licensing .
the only licensed plant - produced vaccine is a veterinary injectable vaccine against newcastle disease virus in poultry , made from purified antigen expressed in cultured tobacco cells .
dow agrosciences received food and drug administration ( fda ) approval for the vaccine in 2006 , but only as a demonstration that plant - produced vaccines can meet the stringent regulatory requirements for approval ; it is not currently for sale ( rybicki , 2009 ) .
plant cells are of particular interest for oral vaccines because their rigid cell walls provide exceptional antigen protection through the stomach into the intestines , where they can access the gut - associated lymphoid tissue ( kwon et al. , 2013 ) .
expression within chloroplasts or other storage organelles may also provide additional protection ( khan et al. , 2012 ) .
while vaccine antigens have been transformed into many edible species including lettuce , tomato , potato , and tobacco , expression in stable transformed crop plants has suffered from low yields , typically less than 1 % of total soluble protein ( tsp ; lossl and waheed , 2011 ) .
yields have been increased by transient expression using recombinant viral vectors or agrobacterium infection , but this expression is typically unstable ( rybicki , 2009 ) .
even using these strategies , the most consistently high - yielding host species is tobacco , which is inedible and therefore would require purification prior to vaccine administration ( lossl and waheed , 2011 ) .
algae as a recombinant protein production platform green microalgae have proven to be highly useful protein production platforms for a variety of industrial and therapeutic applications , particularly for complex or heavily disulfide - bonded proteins .
the chloroplast provides a unique enclosed compartment that facilitates folding ( chebolu and daniell , 2009 ) , and transgene products have been shown to accumulate to high levels in the algal chloroplast - as high as 10 % of tsp ( manuell et al. , 2007 ; surzycki et al. , 2009 ) .
unlike prokaryotes , chloroplasts of algae contain much of the same sophisticated cellular folding machinery as other eukaryotic organisms like yeast .
while the algal nuclear genome can also be transformed , to date most transgene expression has been from the chloroplast genome due to reduced gene silencing and higher protein accumulation .
the green alga model organism chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used to produce a number of human and animal therapeutically relevant proteins , including full - length human antibodies ( tran et al. , 2009 ) , signaling molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( rasala et al. , 2010 ) , and structural proteins like fibronectin ( rasala et al. , 2010 ) .
though expression levels are highly variable by gene , improvements in codon optimization ( franklin et al. , 2002 ; surzycki et al. , 2009 ) and characterization of ideal gene regulatory elements ( rasala et al. , 2011 ; specht and mayfield , 2013 ) continue to increase levels of transgene expression. c. reinhardtii 's success and future potential as a therapeutic protein production platform has been recently reviewed ( rasala and mayfield , 2011 ) .
advantages of an algal vaccine production host unicellular green algae possess all the positive attributes of plant systems , plus several unique advantages over terrestrial plants as vaccine production hosts .
algal biomass accumulation is extremely rapid , and the entirety of the biomass can be utilized for vaccine production , unlike plants that expend energy producing supporting tissues that do not contain the vaccine antigen or cannot be harvested easily .
algae are also not restricted by growing season or local soil fertility , and concerns of cross - contamination of nearby food crops are non - existent .
enclosed bioreactors can be used for higher biomass yields and to reduce concerns of environmental escape ( franconi et al. , 2010 ) , and media can be recycled to minimize water and nutrient loss .
the 2002 discovery of transgenic viral capsid protein - expressing maize in food harvests of nearby corn and soybean crops effectively halted efforts to produce vaccines in edible crop plants , making a food crop - based oral vaccine highly unlikely ( rybicki , 2009 ) .
green algae such as c. reinhardtii are generally recognized as safe ( gras ) by the fda , resurrecting hope that unprocessed edible vaccines can be produced in a photosynthetic organism .
crop plants can contain hundreds of chloroplasts per cell , and each chloroplast harbors dozens of copies of its plastid genome .
in contrast , c. reinhardtii contains a single chloroplast that occupies about half of the volume of the cell ( franklin and mayfield , 2005 ) , making stable homoplasmic transformed lines much easier to obtain ( a few weeks versus several months ) and allowing for increased yields of plastid - expressed vaccine antigens , which account for nearly all antigens expressed to date in algae .
this genomic stability , combined with the ability to tightly regulate growth conditions inside contained bioreactors , allows for more consistent expression levels than terrestrial plants , which can vary by several - fold .
finally , algae can be easily preserved by lyophilization , and two studies of algal - produced vaccine antigens have verified that dried algae stored at room temperature for 6 months ( gregory et al. , 2013 ) or even 20 months ( dreesen et al. , 2010 ) exhibit nearly equivalent antigen effectiveness as freshly harvested algae , though storage at 37degrees did begin to cause a loss of activity over time ( gregory et al. , 2013 ) .
the algal cell wall appears sufficient to withstand harsh conditions within the stomach , as very little antigen degradation was observed after whole cells were incubated with pepsin at ph 1.7 ( dreesen et al. , 2010 ) .
these observations indicate that algae are an ideal host for vaccine transport without cold - chain supply , and that the cells provide adequate protection for antigens en route to the intestinal mucosal lymph tissue , obviating the additional expense associated with encapsulation .
algal vaccine progress the first reported algal - synthesized vaccine antigen was a chimeric molecule comprising the foot - and - mouth disease virus structural protein vp1 and the beta subunit of cholera toxin ( ctb ) , a known mucosal adjuvant ( sun et al. , 2003 ) .
this antigen had been previously expressed in plants and had demonstrated oral immunity in mice ( wigdorovitz et al. , 1999 ) , but advancement of trials was hindered by low expression levels .
in c. reinhardtii , 3 - 4 % tsp was reported , but higher yields may be possible because the strains examined were not completely homoplasmic ( sun et al. , 2003 ) .
the next report of an algal - produced vaccine antigen showed the first in vivo data for efficacy conferring immunity .
the classical swine fever virus ( csfv ) surface protein e2 was expressed from the c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome , and total protein extracts were administered subcutaneously with freud 's adjuvant or orally by gavage with no adjuvant .
subcutaneous immunization reportedly induced a significant immune response , but no data for this result was shown .
no systemic or mucosal immune response was detected after the oral immunization , and it was suggested that a mucosal adjuvant may be necessary for oral administration to be effective ( he et al. , 2007 ) .
wang et al .
( 2008 ) expressed the human glutamic acid decarboxylase , a known type 1 diabetes autoimmune antigen , which reacted with sera from non - obese diabetic mice .
surprisingly , detectable expression was achieved using a non - codon - optimized gene .
a more thorough investigation of the factors affecting vaccine antigen expression in algae found that indeed codon optimization is critical for high yield .
it has also been noted that yield is highly variable among individual transformants despite the fact that chloroplast transformation proceeds by homologous recombination , eliminating positional effects within the genome ( surzycki et al. , 2009 ) .
oral immunization was finally shown to be effective when the antigen of interest was fused to the b subunit of ctb , which forms a pentameric structure and binds the gm1 ganglioside for internalization into intestinal cells .
after feeding freeze - dried algae repeatedly to mice , fecal iga and systemic igg antibody titers reached similarly high levels for both the intended staphylococcus aureus antigen and ctb .
significantly , within a week of finishing the 5 - week oral vaccination , 80 % of immunized mice survived a lethal challenge with s. aureus that killed all control mice within 48 h ( dreesen et al. , 2010 ) .
two studies earlier this year reported relatively low yields of two additional algal - produced antigens , but they are still promising compared to previous literature using alternative systems .
a human papillomavirus e7 protein , while only accumulated to 0.12 % tsp , expressed similar to or better than in other plant systems and did not require fusion to a stabilizing protein to achieve consistent expression .
furthermore , the algal chloroplast - produced e7 was soluble , whereas the plant - produced e7 was found predominantly in the insoluble fraction using multiple solubilization buffers .
while the antibody titer elicited by affinity purified protein was much higher , a crude algal extract was shown to be equally effective at preventing tumor development and promoting mouse survival ( demurtas et al. , 2013 ) .
a chimeric antigen intended to prevent hypertension , consisting of a fusion between angiotensin and a hepatitis b antigen as a carrier , was the first algal vaccine to be expressed from the nuclear genome without chloroplast targeting .
while it only accumulated to 0.05 % tsp , it was detectable by western blot from algal tsp extracts ( soria - guerra et al. , 2014 ) .
since 2010 , several studies have shown that malarial transmission - blocking vaccines can be produced in c. reinhardtii .
transmission - blocking vaccines target surface proteins that appear on the sexual and gamete stages of plasmodium , the causative pathogen of malaria .
there is some evidence that these vaccines may provide partial protection to individuals , but the main benefit of vaccination with a transmission - blocking vaccine is derived from herd immunity preventing the spread of the disease .
therefore , it is especially critical that transmission - blocking vaccines can be delivered easily and at extremely low cost , to reach threshold coverage of the huge populations living in malaria - endemic regions .
one difficulty of producing these plasmodium surface proteins is that they contain multiple egf - like domains that are heavily disulfide - bonded , rendering them difficult to fold and therefore difficult to accumulate to high levels without forming insoluble aggregates ( gregory et al. , 2012 ) .
interestingly , plasmodia appear to not glycosylate their proteins ( gowda and davidson , 1999 ) , making algal chloroplasts suitable hosts as the chloroplast also does not contain glycosylation machinery .
a total of six algae - produced malarial antigens or fragments thereof - pfs25 , pfs28 , pfs48 / 45 , pfmsp1 , pbmsp1 , and pbama1 - have been shown to fold properly and exhibit antibody recognition akin to that of the native plasmodium surface proteins ( dauvillee et al. , 2010 ; gregory et al. , 2012 ; jones et al. , 2013 ) .
algal chloroplast - produced pfs25 was able to completely prevent malaria transmission , indicated by a total absence of plasmodium oocysts in mosquito midguts after feeding on immunized mouse sera .
furthermore , feeding lyophilized algae expressing pfs25 fused to ctb elicited a mucosal response to both antigens ( gregory et al. , 2013 ) .
however , systemic igg response was only observed for the ctb .
this is in contrast with the s. aureus d2 protein fused to ctb , where systemic immunity was elicited for both domains ( dreesen et al. , 2010 ) , suggesting that either the furin protease cleavable linker between the pfs25 and ctb domains prevented pfs25 from being presented to the systemic immune system , or perhaps that pfs25 is inherently less immunogenic .
in a different strategy , truncated versions of the malarial proteins ama1 and msp1 were fused to the major protein constituent of the chloroplast starch granules , the granule - bound starch synthase ( gbss ) .
though they were expressed from the nuclear genome , reasonable accumulation was achieved because the proteins were targeted to and sequestered within the chloroplast starch granules .
both oral and injected vaccination using purified starch from these strains reduced parasite load and prolonged mice survival after challenge with plasmodium berghei ; in the case of an injected vaccine consisting of both antigens , 30 % of mice survived the otherwise - lethal infection ( dauvillee et al. , 2010 ) .
all vaccines produced in algae to date are summarized in table 1 , along with reported yields and significant pre - clinical findings .
most work thus far has been performed in the green alga model organism c. reinhardtii , though one of the earliest reports of an algal - produced hepatitis b antigen was in the marine alga dunaliella salina ( geng et al. , 2003 ) and hepatitis b antigen has also been produced in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum ( hempel et al. , 2011 ) .
in recent years the algal genetic toolkit has been expanded to other algal species , including other green algae , diatoms , and cyanobacteria ( ducat et al. , 2011 ; georgianna and mayfield , 2012 ; qin et al. , 2012 ) , with a goal of broad host range compatibility .
already , over 20 species of algae - including dinoflagellates , red algae , and diatoms - have been transformed , and a suite of promoters and selectable markers have been characterized for many species ( see gong et al. , 2011 , for a comprehensive review ) .
while the first generation of algal vaccines has been predominantly pioneered in chlamydomonas , these advances can readily be applied to alternative algal species that may be more suitable for large - scale vaccine production .
table 1 summary of algal - produced vaccines and significant findings .
antigen ( s ) host / integration site yield significant findings citation foot - and - mouth disease virus ( fmdv ) structural protein vp1 fused to cholera toxin b subunit ( ctb ) c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome 3 to 4 % tsp protein accumulation was higher than reported in previous plant studies and detectable by western and elisa .
binding to gm1 ganglioside was weak but statistically significant .

geng etal .
( 2003 ) classical swine fever virus ( csfv ) structural protein e2 c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome 1.5 to 2 % tsp subcutaneous immunization of algal extracts induced systemic response , but oral immunization did not result in either systemic or mucosal response .

a single dose was as effective as three doses in reducing parasite load after p. berghei challenge in vaccinated mice .
oral immunization with purified starch protected equally well as parenteral administration until day 40 .
dauvillee etal .

sera from pfs25 - inoculated mice completely blocked replication within mosquitoes , and therefore malaria transmission .
gregory etal .
( 2012 ) p. falciparum surface protein pfs25 fused to cholera toxin b subunit c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome up to 0.09 % tsp mice fed lyophilized algae showed mucosal iga response to both ctb and pfs25 , but only systemic igg response to ctb .
a furin protease site separated the two domains .
gregory etal .
( 2013 ) p. falciparum surface protein pfs48 / 45 c - terminal domain c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome not quantified ; visible by western blot after affinity purification the antigenic c - terminal domain was recognized by western blot and elisa with conformation - specific antibodies .
it appeared to accumulate in the insoluble fraction .

his - tagged version obtained only 0.02 % tsp .
in contrast to higher plant expression , c. reinhardtii obtained much higher yields and most of it was soluble .

demurtas etal .
( 2013 ) angiotensin ii fused to hepatitis b virus capsid antigen ( hbcag ) c. reinhardtii nuclear genome up to 0.05 % tsp the chimeric antigen was visible by western blot and quantitated by elisa , but no in vivo or immunological activity assays were performed .
soria - guerra etal .
( 2014 ) future potential for algal - based oral recombinant vaccines from the research available to date , it is clear that algae can produce complex vaccine antigens , and that chlamydomonas - produced antigens can elicit immunogenic responses that are appropriate for their intended roles as vaccines .
it is also clear that identifying alternative mucosal adjuvants to complement these antigens is critical , whether for co - administration with algal - produced antigens or for incorporation into chimeric fusion proteins .
it has been suggested that antigenic fusions with ctb , one of the preferred adjuvants , may interfere with the ctb subunit 's ability to form the pentameric structure essential for strong gm1 ganglioside binding ( sun et al. , 2003 ) .
many alternatives to ctb are under investigation for oral vaccination in other production platforms , including cpg - containing oligodeoxynucleotides , saponins , and subunits from heat - labile enterotoxin and ricin toxin ( pelosi et al. , 2012 ) .
future work should empirically explore many combinations of antigens , mucosal adjuvants , and even testing multiple linkers and potential translocation domains .
as has been noted previously , expression , uptake , and antigenicity are all difficult to predict in the context of plant - produced oral vaccine antigens ( rybicki , 2009 ) , so a high - throughput system like algae is extremely valuable for rapidly testing many versions of potential chimeric vaccine molecules .
furthermore , many antigens will require proper post - translational modifications such as glycosylation to be recognized properly ; more work needs to be done to increase expression levels from the nuclear genome , as glycosylation does not occur in the chloroplast .
it has been suggested that the first licensed plant - produced human vaccines likely will not be the first ones tested in humans , many of which targeted pathogens like hepatitis b for which a relatively inexpensive vaccine already exists ( rybicki , 2009 ) .
stepping stones along the way to human vaccines may include reagents for cheaper diagnostics and development of veterinary vaccines .
several human studies with plant - made vaccines have also indicated a role for oral boosting of an existing immune response conferred by traditional injectable vaccines ( mason and herbst - kralovetz , 2012 ) .
an algal - produced human vaccine production platform will likely come to fruition as an alternative for very expensive vaccines like hpv , or for novel vaccines against diseases for which no alternative currently exists ( martinez et al. , 2012 ) .
the cost and logistical considerations of storage , delivery , and administration in resource - limited settings indicate that plant or algal production may be the only feasible option for large - scale inexpensive vaccination , and thus this avenue deserves increased attention from research funding agencies and investment from the pharmaceutical industry as well .

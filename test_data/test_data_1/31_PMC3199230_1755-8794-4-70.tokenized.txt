background the accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( ipf ) is a major clinical challenge .
we developed a model to diagnose ipf by applying bayesian probit regression ( bpr ) modelling to gene expression profiles of whole lung tissue .
methods whole lung tissue was obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( ipf ) undergoing surgical lung biopsy or lung transplantation .
controls were obtained from normal organ donors .
we performed cluster analyses to explore differences in our dataset .
no significant difference was found between samples obtained from different lobes of the same patient .
a significant difference was found between samples obtained at biopsy versus explant .
following preliminary analysis of the complete dataset , we selected three subsets for the development of diagnostic gene signatures : the first signature was developed from all ipf samples ( as compared to controls ) ; the second signature was developed from the subset of ipf samples obtained at biopsy ; the third signature was developed from ipf explants .
to assess the validity of each signature , we used an independent cohort of ipf and normal samples .
each signature was used to predict phenotype ( ipf versus normal ) in samples from the validation cohort .
we compared the models' predictions to the true phenotype of each validation sample , and then calculated sensitivity , specificity and accuracy .
results surprisingly , we found that all three signatures were reasonably valid predictors of diagnosis , with small differences in test sensitivity , specificity and overall accuracy .
conclusions this study represents the first use of bpr on whole lung tissue ; previously , bpr was primarily used to develop predictive models for cancer .
this also represents the first report of an independently validated ipf gene expression signature .
in summary , bpr is a promising tool for the development of gene expression signatures from non - neoplastic lung tissue .
in the future , bpr might be used to develop definitive diagnostic gene signatures for ipf , prognostic gene signatures for ipf or gene signatures for other non - neoplastic lung disorders such as bronchiolitis obliterans .
background pulmonary fibrosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 1,2 ] .
the multiple subtypes of pulmonary fibrosis carry different prognoses .
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( ipf ) , for example , is a particularly fatal subtype of pulmonary fibrosis that leads to death within 3 - 5 years of its diagnosis ; ipf does not usually respond to immunosuppressant therapy [ 3 - 5 ] .
nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( nsip ) is another subtype of pulmonary fibrosis that has much better rates of survival and treatment response [ 2,6 ] .
all together , there are perhaps 200 subtypes of pulmonary fibrosis [ 7 ] .
the american thoracic society and european respiratory society published a classification scheme that describes the major subtypes of pulmonary fibrosis [ 2 ] .
other authors describe complex algorithms for making an accurate diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis [ 7 - 9 ] .
an accurate diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis requires the integration of clinical , radiographic and pathologic information [ 3,10 ] .
yet , there is no single test by which an accurate diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis can be secured .
the complexity of diagnostic algorithms makes it difficult to establish an accurate diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis outside of the academic setting [ 11,12 ] .
this increases the risk for inaccurate diagnoses and the administration of inappropriate treatments .
for the purposes of this study , we focused on ipf .
the goal of this study was to assess methods by which a diagnostic test for ipf could be developed .
bayesian probit regression ( bpr ) is a statistical method , well - suited to the analysis of highly dimensional data such as that produced by gene expression profiling .
in the past , bpr was used to model differences in gene expression detected in cases of prostate cancer and ovarian cancer [ 13,14 ] .
bpr has never been used to analyze non - neoplastic lung tissue .
the experiments described herein were designed as a proof - of - principle for the concept of " developing ipf gene expression signatures with bpr " .
our aims were to develop a provisional diagnostic model for ipf ; and to establish bpr as an appropriate method for developing additional gene signatures for non - neoplastic lung disease .
methods ethics statement this study was approved by the duke university health system institutional review board ( irb # pro00007903 , pro00008725 and pro00008819 ) and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects .
study population we selected consecutive patients with ipf .
specimens were collected from 11 patients .
all cases fulfilled multidisciplinary diagnostic criteria described in the american thoracic society / european respiratory society consensus statement [ 3 ] .
in addition , pathological confirmation was obtained for every case .
ipf was confirmed by the identification of a usual interstitial pneumonia ( uip ) under the light microscope .
samples of whole lung tissue were obtained at the time of diagnostic surgical lung biopsy ( 6 cases ) or during orthotopic lung transplantation surgery ( 5 cases ) .
specimens were collected from both the upper and lower lobes whenever possible ( 6 out of 11 cases ) .
control specimens ( 6 cases ) were obtained from donated organs that were accepted for lung transplantation .
at the end of lung transplant surgeries , we collected a portion of the newly transplanted lung that was removed during the process of routine lung volume reduction .
sample processing samples were immediately processed following removal from the body .
first , specimens were cut into small pieces (< 5 mm in diameter ) , immersed in rnalater solution ( ambion , inc. , austin , tx ) and incubated overnight at 4degreesc as per the manufacturer 's instructions .
next , the supernatant was removed and samples were stored in a - 20degreesc freezer .
at a later date , frozen rna - protected samples were homogenized with a fastprep device by using lysing matrix a ( mp biomedicals , solon , oh ) .
total rna was extracted from the homogenates by using rnaqueous - 4pcr kits ( ambion , inc. , austin , tx ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions .
rna quantity was measured with a spectrophotometer and rna quality was assessed with a bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) .
isolated rna was used to produce labeled - crna .
then labeled - crna was hybridized to affymetrix human genome u133 plus 2.0 genechips ; and scanned using standard affymetrix protocols .
our complete dataset is available through the gene expression omnibus database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo / ; accession number gse24206 ) .
validation cohort the dataset for the validation cohort was accessioned from the gene expression omnibus ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo / ; accession number gse10667 ) .
this dataset contains raw and processed gene expression profiles from thirty - one patients with ipf and 15 expression profiles from normal lung controls .
this data was contributed to the gene expression omnibus by investigators at the university of pittsburgh ; these samples were previously described [ 15,16 ] .
this dataset was generated on agilent - 014850 whole human genome 4 x 44k microarrays according to the manufacturer 's protocol as reported by the original investigators .
statistical analysis data processing expression estimates for the affymetrix u133 plus 2.0 genechips were obtained by robust multi - array average ( rma ) then log2 transformed [ 17 - 19 ] .
data were filtered prior to analysis to annotated probe sets with average expression values > 4 .
unsupervised cluster analysis global patterns of gene expression were evaluated ( with the top 10 % of genes by coefficient of variation ) by principal component analysis ( pca ) and hierarchical clustering algorithms using the average linkage of the pearson correlation coefficient .
differential gene expression paired t - tests were used to assess differences in gene expression between upper and lower lobe samples .
unpaired student 's t - tests were used to compare the gene expression from ipf biopsies and ipf explants .
supervised classification multi - gene models for binary phenotypes were derived using singular value decomposition ( svd ) and bayesian probit regression models , as described previously [ 13,14,20 ] .
in tuning the model parameters , a data - driven empirical approach was taken to select the optimal number of features in each gene signature , using the sum of deviances as a metric of relative performance .
for a complete description , refer to additional file 1 , supplemental methods and additional file 2 , figure s1 .
validation to independently validate the multi - gene models , features were mapped on a many - by - many basis between the training dataset ( affymetrix hgu133 plus 2.0 ) and gse10667 dataset ( agilent - 014850 whole human genome 4 x 44k microarray ) using unigene and refseq ids ( additional files 3 , 4 and 5 , tables s1 - s3 ) .
gene expression estimates were scale / shift normalized across the datasets , and loadings from the svd were derived from the training dataset only , such that predicted probabilities from the bayesian regression model are independent for the validation set .
association with the phenotype of ipf versus normal control was assessed using a wilcoxon rank sum test , and the predictive value of the signature was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves .
computational software all microarray pre - processing , bpr modeling and analyses were performed using r version 2.9 and bioconductor packages designed for use with affymetrix microarray data ( additional file 6 , software codes ) .
graphical images were produced in r and in matlab r2009a ( the mathworks , inc. , natick , ma ) .
results patients demographic and physiologic characteristics of the 11 patients enrolled in this study are reported in table 1 .
each patient underwent either a medically - indicated surgical lung biopsy or medically - indicated lung transplantation surgery ; remnants of the biopsy sample or pieces of the explanted lung were preserved for microarray analysis .
physiologic measurements were made prior to surgery .
when we compared biopsy to explant , we found no differences in the average age of patients ( 60.67 +/ - 2.72 to 66.6 +/ - 0.68 ) ; the proportion of males ( 83 % versus 60 %) ; or the forced vital capacity ( 65.17 +/ - 5.75 to 56.8 +/ - 5.54 ) .
however , diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was decreased in patients undergoing lung transplantation surgery ( 61.83 +/ - 6.38 to 29.2 +/ - 4.19 , p - value < 0.01 ) which is statistically significant in this patient cohort .

global analysis of gene expression to explore gene expression differences ( and similarities ) between all of the samples , we carried out an unsupervised hierarchical cluster of the entire dataset ( figure 1a ) .
the dataset contains gene expression from 23 samples : 17 samples of ipf from 11 different patients ( 6 pairs of samples from upper and lower lobes ; and 5 samples of single lobes ) ; and 6 samples from normal lung donors .
examining the hierarchical dendrogram ( figure 1b ) , we found a natural separation between ipf samples and normal lung samples ( normals are found on the left - hand side of the figure ; ipf samples fall in the middle and on the right - hand side of the dendrogram ) , with the exception of one outlier , a sample of normal lung ( normal _ c ) which falls among the ipf samples .
figure 1 unsupervised cluster of the complete dataset ( training cohort ) .
samples include normal lung ( black ) and ipf ( brown ) .
ipf is divided into biopsy ( red ) and explant ( green ) .
samples are also identified by their lobe of origin : upper lobe ( orange ) , lower lobe ( blue ) or unknown lobe ( yellow ) .
( a ) unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all samples based on gene expression profiles .
samples include 6 normals ( normal _[ a through f ]) and 17 samples of ipf ( 6 upper / lower lobe pairs and 5 singletons ) of which 8 are biopsies ( biopsy _[ 3 - digit sample id ][ u = upper or l = lower ] and 9 are explants ( explant _[ 3 - digit sample id ][ u = upper or l = lower ]) .
( b ) enlargement of the dendrogram , sample names and color key from figure 1a .
( c ) samples are plotted according to expression of the first two principal components .
[ key : singletons = colored square ; all other shapes represent lobar pairs ] .
we further observed that pairs of samples from the upper and lower lobes have similar global gene expression profiles , such that each pair forms its own node in the hierarchical cluster .
in order to meet the assumptions of independent and identically distributed samples for developing signatures of ipf , we chose to use only one sample ( the upper lobe , when available ) per patient in the subsequent analyses .
finally , we observed that explanted samples and biopsied samples largely segregate in the hierarchical clusters with the exceptions of : one pair of biopsied samples ( biopsy _ 159u and biopsy _ 159l ) and one normal sample ( normal _ c ) falling in the explant cluster ; and a pair of explants ( explant _ 152u and explant _ 152l ) which fall in the biopsy cluster .
to further evaluate global differences in gene expression , we decomposed the high - dimensional gene expression data using principal component analysis ( pca ) , whereby 47 % of the variance in this dataset is captured within the first two principal components for all 23 samples .
again , we found that normal and ipf samples are distinctive ( figure 1c ) .
furthermore , a separation was seen between the biopsied ipf samples and the explants .
meanwhile , the upper / lower lobe pairs showed strong similarity ( average pearson correlation of 0.929 ) as compared to unmatched pairs ( average pearson correlation of 0.781 ) .
comparing gene expression from the upper and lower lobes to further characterize the upper / lower lobe pairs , we decomposed the gene expression data for pairs alone by pca .
this analysis captured 74 % of the variance within the first three principal components .
we plotted the upper / lower lobe pairs according to expression of the first three principal components ( figure 2a ) and found that clusters were not determined by lobe , but rather by the patient ( intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.474 , p - value = 0.02 [ for the first principal component ]) .
figure 2 comparison of samples from different lobes ; comparison of samples from biopsy and explant .
in panels a and b , we compare samples from the upper ( orange ) and lower lobes ( blue ) .
in panels c and d , we compare samples obtained by biopsy ( red ) versus explant ( green ) .
( a ) upper and lower lobe samples are plotted according to expression of the first three principal components .
[ key : each shape represents a lobar pair . ]
( b ) paired limma tests were performed for every gene to compare expression between the upper and lower lobes ; a frequency histogram shows the distribution of unadjusted p - values .
( c ) biopsied and explanted samples are plotted according to expression of the first three principal components .
( d ) unpaired limma tests were performed for every gene to compare expression between biopsies and explants ; a frequency histogram shows the distribution of unadjusted p - values .
to identify genes that might be differentially expressed between the upper and lower lobes , we performed a paired limma test [ 21,22 ] as an empirical bayesian approach to analyzing microarray data that uses hierarchical linear models to improve estimates of variance .
first , we excluded unannotated and lowly expressed genes .
then we plotted the unadjusted p - values for all tests on a frequency histogram and note that the frequency of nominally significant p - values (< 0.05 ) is no greater than that expected by chance alone ( figure 2b ) .
this suggests that greater differences in expression are observed across subjects than between upper and lower lobe , as supported by serial 2 - way anova ( data not shown ) , and the hierarchical cluster in figure 1 where 5 of 6 pairs are noted to be most similar .
therefore , a single sample from each patient was selected for further analysis regardless of lobe .
comparing gene expression from biopsies and explants to investigate the difference between biopsies and explants , we selected the data from this subset of samples ( excluding lobar replicates ) and decomposed the data by pca such that 68 % of the variance was captured within the first three principal components .
the samples were plotted according to expression of the first three principal components ( figure 2c ) .
here , we could appreciate a distinct separation between ipf biopsies and ipf explants .
next , we carried out the limma test to identify genes that were differentially expressed between biopsy and explant .
before adjusting p - values , we plotted the results on a frequency histogram .
we noted that the frequency of nominally significant p - values (< 0.05 ) was greater than expected by chance alone ( figure 2d ) .
after adjusting the p - values with the benjamini - hochberg step - down method to control the false discovery rate ( fdr ) [ 23 ] , 13 probesets ( corresponding to 11 unique genes ) were identified as statistically significant using a fdr threshold of 10 % ( additional file 7 , table s4 ) .
approach to developing gene expression signatures a schematic diagram illustrates the process by which we develop genomic signatures using bpr models ( figure 3 ) .
the first step is to select , as the training dataset , a collection of samples that represent two distinct phenotypes .
prior to analysis , the training dataset is filtered to exclude unannotated and lowly expressed genes , without regard to phenotypic information .
figure 3 schematic diagram of the workflow .
because there is no prior knowledge on which to base the number of genes included in the model , we propose an iterative data - driven approach to model - fitting .
we propose using the " sum of deviances " between observed and predicted phenotypes , coupled with the " misclassification rate " under a leave - one - out process , to determine the optimal size of our bpr model ( i.e. , the number of genes to include in the regression equation ) .
once the number of genes is selected , the model is summarized by the gene annotation and the average of the posterior distribution of the linear predictor under the bayesian model .
the gene signature is visualized by a heatmap that shows normalized expression values of the selected genes ( rows ) over the set of samples ( columns ) .
finally , a second set of samples is used to test the performance of the tuned model .
this represents an independent validation .
because the validation dataset is derived on a different microarray platform , expression values need to be mapped and normalized in a merged dataset to account for differences in batch and the information content of each array .
then , each sample in the validation dataset is applied to the bayesian regression model in order to generate a predictive probability ( from 0.0 to 1.0 ) as a relative score indicating the likelihood of one phenotype over the other .
given information regarding the true phenotype of each validation sample , it is possible to construct a receiver - operating characteristic ( roc ) curve for the predictive value of the gene signature .
binary classification for signature development we chose to develop three separate models for the classification of ipf ; we planned to test each model for diagnostic accuracy ( i.e. , functional validity ) in an independent dataset .
we developed the first model from all ipf samples ( excluding lobar replicates ) versus normal controls .
this training dataset is summarized in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster ( figure 4a ) of the genes showing the largest coefficient of variation ( cov ) .

( e ) 6 ipf biopsies and 6 normals are plotted according to expression of the first two principal components .
( f ) 5 ipf explants and 6 normals are plotted according to their expression of the first two principal components .
since we identified differential gene expression between ipf biopsies and ipf explants , we chose to separately develop diagnostic signatures from each class , as compared to normal controls .
for the ipf biopsy samples , the training dataset is summarized in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster ( figure 4b ) .
likewise , for the subset of ipf explants , the training dataset is summarized in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster ( figure 4c ) .
the three training datasets are each decomposed by pca and the samples are plotted with regard to the first two principal components ( figures 4d,e and 4f ) .
model parameterization for signature development for all signatures , the top two factors from singular value decomposition were used to fit independent terms to the bpr models .
the " misclassification rate " and " sum of deviance " were used to determine the number of genes in each model , as described in additional file 1 ( also see additional file 2 , figure s1 ) .
we determined that 151 genes were needed to optimize the " all ipf " model ; 153 genes were needed to optimize the " ipf biopsy " model ; and 70 genes were needed to optimize the " ipf explant " model .
bpr was performed on each training dataset .
each model was visualized with a heatmap ( figure 5 ) .
to illustrate that each training dataset produces a unique set of predictors , we list the top 10 gene predictors alongside each model .
the complete gene list for each signature is supplied in the additional files ( see additional files 8 , 9 and 10 , tables s5 - s7 ) .

independent validation of gene signatures we used the gse10667 dataset to test each gene signature. by using the same dataset to validate all three signatures , we were able to make a direct comparison between the models .
first we mapped the features of the agilent microarray gse10667 dataset to the corresponding features in our affymetrix training datasets .
we found that 148 features of the gse10667 dataset mapped to features of the " all ipf " model ( out of a possible 151 features , 98.0 %) ; 151 features were mapped to the " ipf biopsy " model ( out of 153 possible features , 98.7 %) ; and 69 features were mapped to the " ipf explant " model ( out of 70 possible features , 98.6 %) .
after features were mapped , we merged the training and validation datasets .
gene expression was normalized across the merged datasets .
then , each model was used in turn to predict the phenotype of each sample in the validation cohort ( figure 6a , b and 6c ) .
predicted probabilities indicate the likelihood of ipf .
the true phenotype of each validation sample is shown in color ( blue for normal and red for ipf ) .
correct predictions are indicated with a solid marker while incorrect predictions are indicated with an open marker .
the youden index was used to compute cut points that maximize linear combinations of sensitivity and specificity for each model in this cohort , run on agilent arrays .
evaluation of the quality of these thresholds would require additional validation on the agilent platform as part of future investigations .
figure 6 validation tests .
each sample of the gse10667 cohort is assigned a probability of ipf .
cutoffs were determined by calculating the youden index .
the true phenotype of each sample is indicated in color ( 15 normals [ blue ] and 31 ipf [ red ]) .
( a ) the all ipf signature is used to assign ipf probability .

( c ) the ipf explant signature is used to assign ipf probability .
roc curves are drawn on a single graph to facilitate comparison ( figure 7 ) .
area under the curve , sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values and overall predictive accuracy are reported in table 2 .
wilcoxon rank sum was performed on each signature to test the general association of predictions and phenotypes .
interestingly , the " ipf explant " model outperforms the " all ipf " and " ipf biopsy " models .

in fact , this study serves as a proof - of - principle : mathematical models such as bpr ( that handle high - dimensional data ) can be used to develop multi - gene biomarkers for non - neoplastic lung disease , starting from gene expression profiles .
we profiled gene expression from whole lung in 11 patients with ipf and 6 normal controls .
samples of ipf were obtained during diagnostic surgical lung biopsies or during lung transplantation procedures .
whenever possible , we obtained samples from two different lobes of the lung .
during the initial data processing phase of our analysis , we made several interesting discoveries .
we found that gene expression is similar between different lobes of the lung ( upper and lower ) sampled from the same patient .
we also found that gene expression differs substantially between ipf samples obtained at the time of biopsy versus explant .
then we developed three gene expression models , designed for the diagnosis of ipf .
these models were designed for functionality and portability : they were designed to predict the diagnosis of ipf across different patient populations and across different microarray platforms .
therefore , we needed to test our models on an independent cohort of samples containing both ipf and normal lung , to see if the models' predictions were accurate .
this represents the first reported attempt to show validity of ipf gene expression signatures as diagnostic models .
we found that all three of our ipf gene expression signatures exhibited discriminatory power and could be used to predict a diagnosis of ipf ( see wilcoxon rank sum , table 2 ) .
however , the signature derived from explanted samples was the most accurate at diagnosing ipf in this particular validation cohort .
we postulate several explanations .
first , our " ipf explant " training cohort is probably the most similar cohort as compared with the validation cohort , which is highly enriched with explant and autopsy samples .
second , the homogeneity of samples in the " ipf explant " cohort promotes a more discriminative model , given the available sample size ; while the clinically heterogeneous " all ipf " and " ipf biopsy " cohorts tend to develop less discriminative models .
finally , predictive accuracy of our models is linked to the prevalence of ipf in the validation cohort .
these factors must be considered in the design of more definitive studies .
the fact that a homogeneous " ipf explant " cohort is most robust highlights the inherent heterogeneity in the general ipf population ( represented by " ipf biopsy ") and supports the need for better diagnostic tools .
in the past , other investigators examined gene expression from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis .
studies were designed to detect gene expression that was altered in pulmonary fibrosis [ 24 - 26 ] .
experiments were also designed as a means to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis or identify novel targets for therapy [ 27 ] .
one problem with these older studies is the lack of replication in independent cohorts [ 28 ] .
more recent studies focus on differential gene expression between clinical phenotypes such as acute exacerbations of ipf versus stable ipf [ 15,29,30 ] ; and ipf versus hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( hp ) [ 31 ] .
yet , no study to date has presented a functional gene - based diagnostic model .
we acknowledge the limitations of our study .
our provisional models range from 63 - 83 % accurate .
the present study was performed on a small cohort and was only intended as a proof - of - principle .
however , we believe that , by increasing the number of samples in our training cohort , we can refine the diagnostic model and increase the accuracy of diagnostic predictions .
we also recognize the need to discriminate ipf from other subtypes of pulmonary fibrosis .
therefore , a definitive investigation must compare ipf gene expression with gene expression profiles of nsip , hp and other subtypes of pulmonary fibrosis .
since bpr models are restricted to binary classifications , we would potentially extend the bayesian svd approach to multinomial outcomes , or other commonly employed methods for high - dimensional expression data ( e.g. , classification and regression trees [ cart ]) .
conclusions we show that bpr is a powerful tool for developing gene signatures from non - neoplastic lung tissue .
we hope that this study will lead to the development of a definitive diagnostic gene signature for ipf .
to do this , it will be necessary to collect a larger cohort of high - quality biospecimens .
we suggest that bpr can also be used to develop a prognostic gene signature for ipf by training a model with samples of rapidly progressive ipf versus slowly progressive ipf .
furthermore , we believe that bpr can be used to model other lung disorders ( such as nsip , hp , bronchiolitis obliterans ) by substituting with different phenotypes in the training cohort .

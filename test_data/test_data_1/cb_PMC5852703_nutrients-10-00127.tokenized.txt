isosteviol ( isv ) , a diterpene molecule , is an isomer of the backbone structure of a group of substances with proven antidiabetic capabilities .
the aim of this study was to investigate if isv elicits dynamic insulin release from pancreatic islets and concomitantly is able to ameliorate gluco - , lipo - , and aminoacidotoxicity in clonal beta - cell line ( ins - 1e ) in relation to cell viability and insulin secretion .
isolated mice islets placed into perifusion chambers were perifused with 3.3 mm and 16.7 mm glucose with / without 10 - 7 m isv .
ins - 1e cells were incubated for 72 h with either 30 mm glucose , 1 mm palmitate or 10 mm leucine with or without 10 - 7 m isv .
cell viability was evaluated with a cytotoxic fluoro - test and insulin secretion was measured in krebs - ringer buffer at 3.3 mm and 16.7 mm glucose .
in the presence of 3.3 mm glucose , 10 - 7 m isv did not change basal insulin secretion from perifused islets .
however , at a high glucose level of 16.7 mm , 10 - 7 m isv elicited a 2.5 - fold increase ( - isv : 109.92 +/ - 18.64 ng / ml vs. + isv : 280.15 +/ - 34.97 ng / ml ; p < 0.01 ) .
after 72 h gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxicity in ins - 1e cells , isv treatment did not significantly affect cell viability ( glucotoxicity , - isv : 19.23 +/ - 0.83 % , + isv : 18.41 +/ - 0.90 % ; lipotoxicity , - isv : 70.46 +/ - 3.15 % , + isv : 65.38 +/ - 2.81 % ; aminoacidotoxicity : - isv : 8.12 +/ - 0.63 % ; + isv : 7.75 +/ - 0.38 % , all nonsignificant ) .
isv did not improve impaired insulin secretion ( glucotoxicity , - isv : 52.22 +/ - 2.90 ng / ml , + isv : 47.24 +/ - 3.61 ng / ml ; lipotoxicity , - isv : 19.94 +/ - 4.10 ng / ml , + isv : 22.12 +/ - 3.94 ng / ml ; aminoacidotoxicity : - isv : 32.13 +/ - 1.00 ng / ml ; + isv : 30.61 +/ - 1.54 ng / ml , all nonsignificant ) .
in conclusion , isv acutely stimulates insulin secretion at high but not at low glucose concentrations .
however , isv did not counteract cell viability or cell dysfunction during gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxicity in ins - 1e cells .
isosteviol steviol glycosides insulin secretion glucotoxicity lipotoxicity aminoacidotoxicity mouse pancreatic islets ins - 1e cells 1 .
introduction type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) continues to be a leading cause of death and mortality worldwide .
it is characterized by hyperglycemia and frequently accompanied by hyperlipidemia and slightly elevated circulating amino acid levels .
inadequate levels of plasma insulin elevate hepatic glucose production , reduce insulin - mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle , and increase free fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue , which promote the deterioration of glycemic control [ 1 ] .
the total amount of released insulin in plasma depends on pancreatic beta - cell proliferation and function [ 2 ] , which plays a key role in t2d disease progression [ 3,4 ] .
chronic exposure to abnormally high blood glucose levels ( glucotoxicity ) promotes oxidative stress [ 5,6 ] .
subsequently , the adaptive antioxidant response impairs glucose - derived reactive oxygen species ( ros ) signaling and glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( gsis ) .
over time , this can perpetuate impaired pancreatic beta - cell function and decreased beta - cell mass [ 7,8 ] .
studies have reported that glucotoxicity negatively regulates insulin gene expression by decreasing insulin transcription factors , with pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor 1 , beta / neurod , and ripe3b1 / mafa included [ 5,9,10,11,12 ] .
kowluru et al .
( 2017 ) proposed that glucose toxicity induces inappropriate movement of the unprenylated yet constitutively active g protein rac1 , leading to beta - cell apoptosis and dysfunction [ 13 ] .
prolonged exposure to high concentrations of palmitate has detrimental effects on beta - cell viability and function [ 14,15,16,17,18 ] , possibly mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 19 ] , increased ros [ 20,21 ] , impaired mitochondrial functions [ 22,23 ] , altered acetylation of multiple proteins [ 24 ] .
we have previously shown that long - term exposure to high lipid concentrations ( lipotoxicity ) causes a series of alteration in pancreatic islets including relatively elevated glucagon secretion , decreased insulin secretion , loss of alpha - cell sensitivity to glucose , and an accumulation of triglycerides [ 25 ] .
we have also demonstrated that chronic exposure to elevated levels of leucine and proline ( aminoacidotoxicity ) induces beta - cell dysfunction , with increased basal insulin secretion and decreased gsis in both isolated pancreatic islets and clonal beta - cells [ 26,27,28 ] .
interestingly there is an association between high - protein intake and impaired glucose tolerance , insulin resistance , and t2d [ 29,30,31 ] .
more over , during obesity and insulin resistance , high circulating levels of amino acids , e.g. , leucine , proline , and valine , are seen [ 31 ] .
isosteviol ( isv ) is mainly obtained by acid hydrolysis of stevioside , the sweet food additive extracted from the plant stevia rebaudiana bertoni ( bertoni ) .
studies have shown that isv possesses various biological activities including anti - hyperglycemic , anti - hypertensive , anti - tumor , anti - inflammatory , and antioxidant effects [ 32 ] .
we have shown that isv improves glucose and insulin sensitivity , lowers plasma triglycerides , lowers weight in diabetic kkay mice , and markedly changes the gene expression profile of key insulin regulatory genes [ 33,34 ] .
additionally , we found evidence that isv counteracts alpha - cell hypersecretion and contributes to changes in the expression of key genes after long - term exposure to palmitate [ 35 ] .
in the present study , we tried to mimic t2d conditions in clonal beta - cell line ( ins - 1e ) by inducing gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxicity , and tested whether isv could counteract the detrimental effects observed .
we also wanted to investigate the dynamic insulin secretion elicited by isv from pancreatic mouse islets .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .

syto 24 solution : 5 mm syto 24 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain ( molecular probes , invitrogen , eugene , or , usa ) in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted to a final concentration of 0.01 mm .
2.2 .
isolation of islets pancreatic islets were isolated from adult female nmri mice ( taconic , ry , denmark ) weighing 22 to 25 g by the collagenase digestion technique , as described previously [ 36,37 ] .
briefly , after the mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital intraperitoneally , a midline laparotomy was applied and the distal end of the common bile duct was clamped at the papilla vateri .
thereafter , the hepatic duct was cannulated and 3 ml of ice - cold hbss containing 0.3 mg / ml of collagenase p was injected into the duct system of the pancreas .
the whole pancreas was removed and then placed in a test tube in water bath at 37 degreesc for 19 min .
after being washed three times with hbss , the islets were hand - picked under a stereomicroscope and immediately transferred to rpmi 1640 medium and incubated overnight .
islets for perifusion studies were obtained from 12 ~ 20 mice to compensate for inter - individual differences .
2.3 .
perifusion of islets after overnight culture , the islets were rinsed twice with a m - krb supplemented with 3.3 mm glucose and 0.1 % bsa .
in the perifusion experiments , 30 pre - incubated islets were transferred to each of the perifusion chambers [ 37 ] .
the experiments were designed as follows : ( 1 ) 10 - min pre - perifusion at 3.3 mm glucose ; ( 2 ) 20 - min perifusion at 3.3 mm glucose with / without isv ( 10 - 7 m ) ; ( 3 ) 40 - min wash - out at 3.3 mm glucose ; ( 4 ) 20 - min perifusion at 16.7 mm glucose with / without isv ( 10 - 7 m ) ; ( 5 ) 40 - min wash - out at 3.3 mm glucose ; ( 6 ) 20 - min perifusion at 16.7 mm glucose with 0.1 mmol / l carbamylcholine ( sigma ) .

the medium was supplemented with : 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 iu / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 10 mm hepes , and 5 mum 2 - mercaptoethanol .
the cells were passaged weekly .
2.5 .

the cells were allowed to adhere overnight .
thereafter , they were treated and cultured with different concentrations of glucose , palmitic acid , and leucine with / without 10 - 7 m isv or 10 - 7 m glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) .
after 72 h , the number of dead cells in each well was calculated using a fluorometric assasy kit based on the cell lysis and staining method ( cytotoxic fluoro - test wako ; wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) in the fluostar galaxy ( bmg , ramcon , denmark ) .
2.6 .
insulin secretion from ins - 1e cells the ins - 1e cells were seeded in 24 - well black visiplate tc ( wallac oy , turku , finland ) plates at a density of 3.0 x 105 cells / well in 1 ml medium .
after adhering overnight , the cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 with different concentrations of glucose , palmitic acid , and leucine with / without 10 - 7 m isv or 10 - 7 m glp - 1 .
after 72 h of incubation , the cells were pre - incubated with m - krb supplemented with 3.3 mm glucose and 0.1 % bsa for 15 min and then the cells were incubated in 1 ml m - krb containing 3.3 or 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h. subsequently , supernatants ( 300 mul ) were collected , centrifuged , and 200 mul were kept at - 20 degreesc for insulin analysis .
after the secretion study , the number of cells was estimated using nuclear staining with 0.01 mm syto 24 reagent ( 20 mul / well ) and measured by fluostar galaxy .
insulin levels were normalized to cell number .
2.7 .
insulin assay insulin was analyzed by radioimmunoassay using guinea pig anti - porcine insulin antibody ( novo nordisk , bagsvaerd , denmark ) .
mono - 125i - ( tyr a14 ) - labeled human insulin ( novo nordisk ) was used as tracer and rat insulin ( novo nordisk ) was used as a standard .
ethanol was added to separate bound and free radioactivity .
the inter - and intra - assay variation coefficients were both less than 5 % .
3. statistical analysis all data analysis was performed with graphpad prism software version 7.0 ( graphpad software , san diego , ca , usa ) .
statistical significance between two groups was evaluated using unpaired student 's t - test .
data are presented as the mean +/ - standard error of the meam ( sem ) ; p - values < 0.05 were considered significant .
4. results 4.1 .
effects of isv on the dynamic of insulin release from perifused mouse islets in the presence of 3.3 mm glucose , the addition of isv did not change basal insulin secretion .
as expected , a biphasic insulin response was found when glucose level was increased from 3.3 to 16.7 mm. figure 1 shows that in the presence of high levels of glucose ( 16.7 mm ) , isv ( 10 - 7 m ) elicited a pronounced and sustained 2.5 - fold ( p = 0.0016 ) monophasic increase in insulin release .
at 130 - 150 min , the insulin auc ( area under the curve ) increased 2 - fold ( p = 0.0058 ) in the isv group compared to the control .
4.2 .
impact of gluco - , lipo - , and aminoacidotoxicity on the viability of ins - 1e cells 4.2.1 .
glucotoxicity ins - 1e cells were challenged with low ( 5.5 mm ) and high ( 30 mm ) glucose for 72 h with and without 10 - 7 m isv and 10 - 7 m glp - 1 .
a significant increase of cell death rate was discovered at high glucose levels compared to the control group ( 11.1 mm glucose ) , while no change was found at low glucose levels .
however , no significant change was induced by co - incubation with either 10 - 7 m isv or 10 - 7 m glp - 1 ( figure 2 ) .
4.2.2 .
lipotoxicity figure 3 shows the effect of 10 - 7 m isv and 10 - 7 m glp - 1 on the viability of ins - 1e cells treated with 0.1 mm , 0.5 mm , or 1 mm palmitic acid .
cell death level was significantly increased to 36 % at 0.5 mm palmitic acid , and to 70 % at 1 mm palmitic acid .
no significant difference was found after co - incubation with either 10 - 7 m isv or 10 - 7 m glp - 1 .
4.2.3 .
aminoacidotoxicity as shown in figure 4 , cell death rates were slightly increased when ins - 1e cells were exposed to 1 mm and 10 mm leucine .
however , no significant change was induced by co - incubation with either 10 - 7 m isv or 10 - 7 m glp - 1 .
4.3 .
impact of gluco - , lipo - , and aminoacidotoxicity on insulin secretion of ins - 1e cells 4.3.1 .
glucotoxicity figure 5 shows that at 3.3 mm glucose , bis ( basal insulin secretion ) from ins - 1e cells remained unchanged after 72 h of incubation with 5.5 mm and 30 mm glucose .
high glucose ( 16.7 mm ) stimulated insulin secretion increased after 72 h of exposure of the cells to 5.5 mm glucose , but decreased insulin secretion to 30 mm glucose .
neither 10 - 7 m isv nor 10 - 7 m glp - 1 elicited any significant changes from ins - 1e cells incubated at 5.5 mm , 11.1 mm , and 30 mm glucose 4.3.2 .
lipotoxicity as can be seen in figure 6 , there was no significant change in bis at 3.3 mm glucose from ins - 1e cells after 72 h of incubation with 0.1 mm , 0.5 mm , or 1 mm palmitic acid. by contrast , high concentrations ( 0.5 mm and 1 mm ) of palmitic acid significantly decreased insulin secretion after 72 h. neither 10 - 7 isv nor 10 - 7 glp - 1 made a significant change in this situation .
4.3.3 .
aminoacidotoxicity when ins - 1e cells were exposed to 1 mm or 10 mm leucine for 72 h , no significant effect on insulin secretion was found compared to the control group .
both 10 - 7 m isv and 10 - 7 m glp - 1 showed no effect in these conditions , as illustrated in figure 7 .
5. discussion numerous studies have shown that the major steviol glycosides , stevioside and rebaudioside a , possess anti - hyperglycemic effects [ 39,40,41,42,43,44 ] .
the stevioside derivative , isv , has a higher bioavailability and a more potent insulinotropic effect .
this study is the first to demonstrate that isv causes a dynamic insulin stimulatory effect .
however , isv is not able to counteract the toxic effects of chronic exposure of ins - 1e cells to high concentrations of glucose , palmitic acid , or leucine .
t2d is a chronic metabolic disorder that results from relative insulin deficiency and insulin resistance .
in t2d patients , hypoglycemia is a major safety issue that can be fatal , particularly in patients with cardiovascular diseases .
the risk of hypoglycemia is one of the main reasons preventing patients from achieving optimal glucose levels [ 45,46 ] .
the incidence of hypoglycemia is a major drawback for sulfonylureas , a classic medication towards t2d , and it has therefore been assigned a lower priority in the aace / ace ( american association of clinical endocrinologists / american college of endocrinology ) treatment algorithm for t2d [ 47 ] .
there is an urgent need to identify potential new drugs that enable t2d patients to both achieve glycemic goals and avoid hypoglycemia simultaneously .
steviol glycosides seem to have this potential .
in the perifusion experiment , we have demonstrated that isv elicits a distinct monophasic insulin response , similar to what we have previously found for stevioside , rebaudioside a , and steviol [ 40,44 ]. that is , isv stimulated insulin secretion in a dose - dependent manner .
it showed no insulinotropic action at a low glucose level of 3.3 mm , while it caused a clear - cut insulin release at high glucose levels .
consequently , our results indicate that isv possesses the desired potential in the treatment of t2d , since the insulinotropic action present at high glucose levels disappears at low glucose concentrations .
carbamylcholine is a cholinergic agonist , which depolarizes the beta - cell by the activation of the acetylcholine receptors .
in the present study , carbamycholine is used as a positive control to confirm the secretory capacity of the islets .
it is noteworthy that during the wash - out period at 90 - 130 min , the effect on isv showed some " tale effect " , that is , the effect of isv did not vanish immediately but declined gradually toward a basic level .
this may be because isv influences a receptor ( e.g. , a trpm5 - related receptor ) and remains bound for some time , resulting in the effect gradually disappearing .
trpm5 , transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily melastatin member 5 , is a monovalent cation channel located in various human cells , including type ii taste receptor cells and pancreatic beta - cells [ 48,49,50 ] .
an increase in intracellular calcium would activate trpm5 ; philippaert k. et al .
( 2017 ) proved that the potentiation of the channel 's activity by steviol glycosides modulates taste responses and insulin release , which would explain the feature of the compound being sweet and lowering blood glucose concurrently [ 51 ] .
steviol glycosides share a common aglycone core structure steviol ( ent - 13 - hydrozykaur - 16 - en - 18 - oic acid ) , which as mentioned could be converted to isv through acid hydrolysis .
the chemical structures of steviol and isv are very similar , see figure 8 , indicating that their insulin - secreting effect is mostly related to their common diterpene skeleton [ 52 ] .
as illustrated in figure 2 , figure 3 and figure 4 , the toxic concentrations of glucose ( 30 mm ) , palmitate ( 0.5 mm and 1 mm ) or leucine ( 10 mm ) caused ins - 1e cell death , with an increasing toxic sequence : 10 mm leucine , 30 mm glucose , and 0.5 ( or 1 ) mm palmitic acid .
isv did not counteract the detrimental effects caused by gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxicity .
however , in the control groups the presence of isv did not change cell viability , indicating the absence of cytotoxic effects of isv and pointing to a promising safety profile of isv .
the insulin secretion results depicted in figure 5 , figure 6 and figure 7 are in line with the results from cell viability studies .
when ins - 1e cells were exposed to gluco - or lipotoxicity , a large portion of cells were dead and undoubtedly not functioning well .
therefore , the insulin amount released from the cells was decreased dramatically .
surprisingly , in the present study the aminoacidotoxicity was minimal since cell death was only slightly increased and insulin secretion was unaffected during high amino acid levels .
our results suggest that isv possesses no protective effects on ins - 1e cells when exposed to gluco - , lipo - , or aminotoxicity .
interestingly , we have previously found that after nine weeks of treatment with standard chow diet plus isv , plasma glucose was reduced by 38 % in kkay diabetic mice , of which the plasma glucose levels were about 26 mm before the treatment [ 33 ] .
the apparent discrepancy between the results from the two studies may indicate that the protective effects of isv may not operate directly via an effect on ins - 1e cells .
alternatively , ins1 - e cells per se may not be sensitive to the protective effects of isv after long - term gluco - , lipo , or aminoacidotoxicity .
we also included glucagon - like peptide - 1 - ( 7 - 36 ) amide ( glp - 1 ) in this study to compare the pharmacological effects of these two compounds .
glp - 1 , a potent incretin hormone , has been developed into an important drug for the treatment of t2d [ 52 ] .
until now , few studies have investigated the effect of glp - 1 in alpha - cells regarding change in glucagon secretion and cell proliferation under gluco - , lipo - , and aminoacidotoxicity conditions , and no previous studies have compared its effect with isv .
glp - 1 and isv seem to share a few features , e.g. , both show glucose - dependent insulinotropic effects and both lower body weight .
like isv , glp - 1 did not show significant effects on cell viability or insulin secretion during long - term gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxiciy in ins - 1 cells .
impressively , when ins - 1e cells were exposed to low glucose ( 5.5 mm ) there was no significant influence on cell viability , whereas the insulin secretion was dramatically raised .
this may reflect that the cells are more sensitive to glucose stimulation when the prevailing glucose level is relatively low .
this underlines the importance of maintaining optimal glycemic control .
6. conclusions in conclusion , isv did not increase cell death and , in this respect , it appears safe .
we showed a pronounced dynamic effect of isv on glucose - stimulated insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets .
however , isv does not counteract gluco - , lipo - , or aminoacidotoxicity in ins - 1e cells .
further studies are required to demonstrate the antidiabetic effects of isv and to further confirm its safety profile in humans .

these systems have generated a local benchmark for argentinean hospitals .
however , it would be appropriate to compare local data with those international standards , in order to determine if there is , in our country , an excess in the number of ssi adjusted by surgical category and risk index .
objectives to estimate the excess of ssi using the standardized infection ratio ( sir ) from three local surveillance systems compared with two external standards .
methods through a retrospective analysis of data from three argentinean surveillance systems , 16 surgical procedures were selected according to the relevance of ssi associated and the lower probability of underreporting because the lack of post - discharge surveillance .
data from each local surveillance system were compared with external standard for the same time period through sir .
ssi excess was estimated as the difference between observed and expected cases. between oct - dec 2014 , an anonymous survey was sent to 165 hospitals , participating in at least one local surveillance system , with the purpose to evaluate the compliance with recommended strategies ( shea - idsa , 2014 update ) to prevent ssi .
results while , for iriq project , 3,186 surgeries were evaluated with an excess of 88 ssi ( sir 2.21 ; 95 % ci 1.87 - 2.55 ; p < 0.01 ) , for validar project , 5,762 procedures were included with an excess of 89 ssi ( sir 1.66 ; 95 % ci 1.44 - 1.88 ; p < 0.01 ) , and for vihda system , 27,389 surgeries were evaluated with an excess of 462 ssi ( sir 1.91 ; 95 % ci 1.79 - 2.03 ; p < 0.01 ) .
while 68.8 % of the procedures , showed a sir significantly > 1 , none of the rest categories reach a sir significantly < 1 .
among the surgical procedures with greater sir were : cardiac surgery ( coronary and non - coronary ) , craniotomy , spinal fusion , and hip and knee replacement. from the 82 centers ( 49.7 %) who responded the survey , more than 50 % failed in maintain a level of compliance above 90 % for the preventive measures .
conclusion this study shows that in our country there is a significant excess of ssi , even after adjusting for surgical category and risk index .
this deviation could be associated with failures in the implementation of recommended preventive strategies .

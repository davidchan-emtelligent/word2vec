in this study , istanbul - tuzla region atmosphere was selected as the working area for atmospheric pollution .
although the study area seems too local , this region contains shipyards and shipyard - related side product industries .
it is also surrounded by aluminum ( assan ) and copper ( sarkuysan ) facilities and tannery organized industrial district .
for determined the atmospheric inputs , the sample collection was carried out as monthly in 2010 .
particulate matter was filtered from aerosols via a high volume air sampler .
the collected 46 ambient air samples were analyzed for cr , fe , cu , zn , cd , pb and al using atomic absorption spectrometry ( aas ) , flame unit .
additionally , the volume of the air was drawn and meteorological data recorded .
average individual heavy metal concentrations were found as cd ( 0.06 ng / m3 ) < cr ( 0.09 ng / m3 ) < zn ( 0.21 ng / m3 ) < pb ( 0.23 ng / m3 ) < cu ( 0.48 ng / m3 ) .
the concentrations of crustal elements fe and al were changed between 5.48 ng / m3 , 74 ng / m3 and 14 ng / m3 , 284 ng / m3 respectively during the sampling period .
except cr and fe anthropogenic contribution was seen on the concentrations of zn , cu , pb and cd in an increasing order .
while the crustal element fe was not show an appreciable change in concentration , but the al concentration was display an important change in concentration depending on the wind transportation .
keywords atmospheric pollution metal istanbul tuzla enrichment factor ( ef ) issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction various chemicals are emitted into the air from both natural and man - made ( anthropogenic ) sources .
the quantities may range from hundreds to millions of tonnes annually .
natural air pollution stems from various biotic and abiotic sources such as plants , radiological decomposition , forest fires , volcanoes and other geothermal sources and emissions from land and water .
these result in a natural background concentration that varies according to local sources or specific weather conditions [ 1 ] .
the emission of toxic substances in the environment has been spread from industrialized countries .
many industrial plants and also heavy traffic may produce heavy metal into atmosphere .
traffic pollutants include potentially toxic metals for health like lead , cadmium and zinc [ 2 , 3 ] .
migon et al .
[ 4 ] indicated after the implementation of antipollution policies on automotive pb concentration levels decreased by 82 % .
the changes in life style increases the levels at which trace metals are added in soil , water and air from anthropogenic sources [ 5 , 6 ] .
heavy metal pollution is potentially a persistent problem all over the world in an increasing order [ 7 ] .
emissions from traffic contain many toxic heavy metals such as ; pb , cd and zn [ 2 ] .
meteorological conditions and local sources have an important role on trace element concentrations .
airborne particles are important carriers of metals [ 8 ] .
in recent decades , major efforts have been made to reduce air pollution in the european region [ 1 ] .
so a considerable interest has been given to particulate matter ( pm ) of aerosols due to their impacts on visibility , human health , plants , aquatic life and materials [ 8 - 10 ] .
while the industrialization and human activities intensify the emission of various pollutants into the environment and introduce various harmful substances into the atmosphere [ 3 ] .
a few decades ago the study are tuzla region in istanbul was a coastal recreation area .
the industrialization of the tuzla region had been increased rapidly .
especially shipyards and shipping industry were growth in the region .
such areas were classified " transitional urban areas " had rapid population growth between 1975 and 2005 but tapered projected growth between 2005 and 2015 such as istanbul , turkey [ 11 ] .
the aim of this study is firstly to search the seasonal change of metals cr , fe , cu , zn , cd , pb and al of concentrations as inorganic pollutants and secondly to find their sources and anthropogenic contributions for the first time for this region .
material and methods sampling the sampling area is located in turkey / istanbul , tudev - piri reis university campus ( 400 49 ' 05 66 '' n and 290 20'54 00 '' e ) at a height of 22 m ( fig. 1 ) .
the sampling point is faraway 0.81 km from the marmara sea .
a high volume air sampler ( hvas ) was fixed at the top of the university building roof to carry out the aerosols sampling. fig. 1 location of sampling area ( google earth ) the sample collection was carried out at 2010 .
the filter papers divided into two parts ; one halves were saved in plastic bag separately for metal analyses .
five samples were taken for february , march , april , may , june , july , august , september and october .
only one sample was obtained for december and this value assumed as the average of the month .
the volume of the air was drawn and meteorological data recorded .
analytical procedures particulate matter whatman glass fiber filter papers having a pore size of 0,1 mum are dried for 48 h in a desiccator and weighted before and after the sampling .
so the daily concentrations of particulate matter with the size > 0.1 mum of collected over the filter paper were found .
metal analyses the halves of the filter papers put into the teflon ( ptfe ) tubes .
a strong acid mixture of 5 ml hno3 , 3 ml hclo4 and 1 m l hf is added to the tubes to provide the decomposition metals at 180 degreesc in closed digestion unit ( micro - wave ) during one hour .
then diluted to a definite volume and then the analyses of al , fe , pb , zn , cd and cr are accomplished at atomic absorption spectrometry ( aas ) , flame unit .
duplicate metal analysis results are given in table 1 .
confidence interval = 1.96 x standard deviation / mean .

as a result of the normal day - to - day variation in pm10 concentrations , 24 - h averages of 100 mug / m3 are regularly exceeded in many areas in europe , especially during winter inversions .
the effects have been observed at annual average concentration levels below 20 mug / m3 ( as pm2.5 ) or 30 mug / m3 ( as pm10 ) .
for this reason , no guideline value for long - term average concentrations is recommended [ 1 ] .
in turkey , it is required to reach these limit values at 2019 [ 12 ] .
the range of pm ( pore size > 0.1 mum ) concentrations measured at tuzla region during the sampling period was 12.22 mug / m3 - 209 mug / m3 with the average value of 67.90 mug / m3 .
the daily pm concentrations in each month were shown on fig. 2. the tendencies in increase at pm concentrations were seen on from july to october in some measurements. fig. 2 daily pm concentrations ( mug / m3 ) cong et al .
[ 13 ] studied with two filter paper simultaneously , one with polytetrafluoroethylene , ptfe , 0.5 mum , 47 mm ) and the other polycarbonate ( nucleopor , coaster ,) filters with the pore size of 1.5 % .
in the study the results were found in between 2.02 - 6.34 mug / m3 .
braga et al .
[ 14 ] measured the concentration ( mug / m3 ) ranges between hv pm10 in 2.80 - 40.10 and dichotomous ( fine ) in 12 0.46 - 16.02 and dichotomous ( coarse ) in 1.51 - 24.42 .
table 2 shows the meteorological conditions and the measured pm concentrations ( mug / m3 ) ialong the sampling periods ( fig. 2 ) .
this may not be enough to explain all the measurement events , since the initial measurements generally depend on the previous days' meteorological conditions .
it is necessary to develop a detailed study to explain the relationship between the meteorological parameters and the pm concentrations in the aerosol such as wind transportation .
although there are some deficiencies to explain the relationships between meteorological conditions and pm concentrations , this table will help to see some variations on pm concentrations .
the weak correlations are found between pm concentrations with average temperature , relative humidity and average wind speed are 0.15 , 0.08 and 0.18 respectively .
to observe any relationship between meteorological conditions pm concentrations all parameters could be considered as a whole previous or sampling period .
for instance , from table 2 , it is seen that the low concentrations were generally occurred at low temperatures and rainy days , e.g. december sample no .
1 ( 1.22 mug / m3 ) and march sample no .
4 ( 12.87 mug / m3 ) .
the high concentrations were seen at dry air and when humidity values are relatively low , e.g. july sample no .
5 ( 209 mug / m3 ) and september sample no .
4 ( 154 mug / m3 ) .
as an exceptional case , a dust concentration ( 0.25 - 0.50 mg / m3 ) had been occurred at february 17 from sahara desert and continued a few days causing to decrease the visibility to 10 - 6 km ( www.meteorgov.tr ) .
this effect was seen on the pm concentrations on sample no .
2 ( 93.11 ng / m3 ) and sample no .
3 ( 78.46 ng / m3 ) even if the duration was rainy .
after a dry period , the concentration increase was observed on the fifth sample depending on wind transportation .
in turkey , the wind systems generally cause to flow of air from west to 22 east [ 15 , 16 ] .

al concentrations begin to increase from july and reach a peak at september , then the concentration decreases at cold months ( fig. 3a ) .
this situation shows some similarities with pm concentration changes ( fig. 2 ) .
fe does not show any appreciable change in monthly average concentrations except december ( fig. 3a ). fig. 3 monthly average concentrations ( ng / m3 ) of al and fe from fig. 4b , it can be concluded that , while the monthly average concentrations of cr , zn , cd , pb show some extremums at different months , cu shows an increase in average concentrations from beginning july reach to a maximum at september , then decreases .
copper concentration changes also show some similarities with pm and al concentrations .
the daily metal concentrations of metals are given in table 2 and fig. 4a - g. fig. 4 a. daily concentration changes of al concentration ( ng / m3 ). b. daily concentration changes of fe concentration ( ng / m3 ). c. daily concentration changes of cr concentration ( ng / m3 ). d. daily concentration changes of cu concentration ( ng / m3 ). e. daily concentration changes of zn concentration ( ng / m3 ). f. daily concentration changes of cd concentration ( ng / m3 ). g. daily concentration changes of pb concentration ( ng / m3 ) crustal metals in this study , aluminum concentration changes between 14 ng / m3 and 248 ng / m3 with an annual average of 71.13 ng / m3 ( table 2 , fig. 4a ) .
the highest concentration is found in the 5th sample of july .
the pm concentration also has the highest concentration that sampling period .
the correlation between al and pm was found as r = + 0.64 ( table 3 ) .
the lowest al concentration is found in march , sample no .
1as14 ng / m3 .
this sampling duration corresponds a rainy period .
the second low al concentration is found in a rainy period in april sample no.4 as 21 ng / m3 .
the increases in concentrations in september could be explained that there was n't any precipitation .
in october , the period was rainy and high relative humidity .
so al could be hold in the aerosol by high humidity .

the highest value ( r = + 0.64 ) was found between al and particulate matter contents in atmospheric aerosols .
additionally , high correlations were observed between al and cu contents , particulate matter and pb , particulate matter and cr amounts .
the results are show the terrestrial origins on this metal distributions via atmospheric tranport .
in contrast , the low correlation coeffecient values are indicate the different origins and factors on atmospheric metal transport .
table 4 is prepared to compare this study results with other studies .
except terra nova bay [ 19 ] the cr and fe concentrations of the region was very low from the other studies .
the al concentration of the region was higher than mt. qomolangma [ 13 ] and terra nova bay [ 19 ] but the al concentration of the ankara having a continental climate [ 9 ] and west and east black sea aerosols were very high [ 16 ] .
zn and cd measurements are similar to terra nova bay [ 19 ] .
cu concentration was similar to mt. qomolangma [ 13 ] and terra nova bay [ 19 ] .
it could be concluded that out of cr , fe and al , tuzla region measurements show some approximate values with terra nova bay .

levels of aluminum in the air generally range from 0.005 to 0.18 micrograms per cubic meter ( mug / m3 ) , depending on location , weather conditions , and type and level of industrial activity in the area .
most of the aluminum in the air is in the form of small suspended particles of soil ( dust ) .
aluminum levels in urban and industrial areas may be higher and can range from 0.4 to 8.0 mug / m3 ( http :// www.atsdr.cdc.gov / toxprofiles / tp22 - c1.pdf ) .
the occupational health and safety administration ( osha ) has limited workers' exposure to aluminum in dusts to 15 mg per cubic meter ( mg / m3 ) ( total dust ) and 5 mg / m3 ( respirable fraction ) of air for an 8 - h workday , 40 - h workweek ( http :// www.atsdr.cdc.gov / tfacts22.pdf ) .
aluminum is released to the environment by both natural processes and anthropogenic sources .
because of its prominence as a major constituent of the earth 's crust , natural processes far exceed the contribution of anthropogenic releases to the environmental distribution of aluminum [ 20 ] .
sekhavatjou et al .
[ 21 ] indicate that the al level in industrial and heavily congested traffic sectors is higher than other areas .
coal burning , electroplating and paint are the source of al [ 22 ] .
iron is not considered to cause harmful health effects in general ; toxicological and epidemiological literature is limited .
atsdr [ 23 ] used a modification of the dose equation ( dose = concentration x intake rate ) to calculate a daily consumption from exposure to iron in soil .
exposure to the maximum concentration of iron collected from a residential area ( 31,500 ppm ) .
the national academy of sciences' ( nas 's ) dietary reference intake ( dri ) for children 1 to 3 years old is 7 mg / day [ 24 ] .
the median daily intake of dietary iron is roughly 11 to 13 mg / day for children 1 to 8 years old and 13 to 20 mg / day for adolescents 9 to 18 years old [ 23 , 24 ] .

the vehicular activities cause to increase the level of fe in the atmosphere [ 25 ] .
the concentration level of fe is highly influenced by the industrial activities and traffic of vehicle [ 21 ] .
chromium is ubiquitous in nature .
available data , generally expressed as total chromium , show a concentration range of 5 - 200 ng / m3 .
there are few valid data on the valency and bioavailability of chromium in the ambient air [ 1 ] .
cr is emitted in the atmosphere due to coal and oil combustion , especially diesel - fed vehicles , refuses incineration [ 26 ] .
the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) requires that levels of copper in the air in work places not exceed 0.1 mg / m3 copper fumes per cubic meter of air ( 0.1 mg / m3 ) and 1.0 mg / m3 for copper dusts [ 27 ] .
the main source of cu in the atmosphere is diesel engines , unleaded gasoline is the other source [ 28 ] .
the other sources of the atmosphere are cu - containing fungicides , metal working factories and electroplating materials [ 29 ] .
the rural levels of airborne copper represented regional background levels in urban study sites with only episodic increases , depending on wind speed and direction and location relative to local point sources .
in one urban study site ( east st. louis ) , smelters are the primary source of copper .
copper depositional fluxes follow an exponential decay as one transition from urban to rural settings [ 30 ] .
soil is not the major source of copper in cities or nearby rural soils , but is the predominant source for copper in the atmosphere over more remote areas [ 27 , 31 ] .
in general , levels of zinc in air are relatively low and fairly constant .
average levels of zinc in the air throughout the united states are less than 1 microgram of zinc per cubic meter ( mu g / m3 ) of air , but range from 0.1 to 1.7 mug / m3 in areas near cities [ 12 , 32 ] .
zn is used in lubricating oil [ 30 , 33 ] and zn is also released from vehicular activities such as tire wear .
a who air quality guideline for cadmium of 5 ng / m3 has been recommended in order to prevent any further increases in cadmium levels in agricultural soils [ 1 ]. by the end of the period studied , concentrations over western and central parts of europe declined , ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 ng / m3 [ 34 ] .
in turkey , the limit value is 5 ng / m3. and it is planned to decrease the level 2 ng / m3 at 2020 .
cd is originated from vehicular activities [ 33 ] .
average air lead levels are usually below 0.15 mug / m3 at nonurban sites .
urban air lead levels are typically between 0.15 and 0.5 mug / m3 in most european cities .
additional routes of exposure must not be neglected , such as lead in dust , a cause of special concern for children [ 1 ]. by 2003 , the concentrations in air had decreased markedly and were within 2 - 15 ng / m3 over most of europe [ 34 ] .
in turkey , pb limit value is 2 mug / m3 , and it is required to decrease the value to 1 mug / m3 at 2019 [ 12 ] .
pb concentration levels in air are strictly depended on distance of the emission sources [ 35 ] .
after the implementation of antipollution policies on automotive , pb levels were decreased in the atmosphere by 82 % [ 4 ] .
to improve the antiknock property , pb is still being introduced in different forms to fuels in many countries [ 5 ] .
table 5 shows the mean and max - min values of efc values of heavy metals and their efc / al correlations .
non - crustal contributions on heavy metal concentrations of the region aerosol are observed as cd > pb > cu > zn. migon and nicolas [ 36 ] had been found the importance of the recycling component decreases in the sequence cd > pb > cu > zn in the north - western mediterrenean atmosphere .
( these metals are also found in high levels in some studies [ 8 , 37 ] .

efc ( enrichment factor from crust to air ) = ( cx / cal ) air / cx / cal ) crust , here ; ( cx / cal ) air : the concentration ratio of the element x and al in the measured air .
( cx / cal ) crust : the concentration ratio of the element x and al in the crust .
the elements have efc values which range between 1 and 10 , indicating that they are present in the aerosol in roughly crustal proportions .
except cr , fe the other heavy metal concentrations are independent of al concentrations .
so , it can be said that their source are non - crustal [ 9 ] .
anthropogenic contributions on heavy metal concentrations of the region aerosol are observed as cd > pb > cu > zn in a decreasing order .
the efc values of cd 8 - 9730 with an average of 804.11 indicates that the high anthropogenic contribution .
efc values of pb correspond to a range of 10 - 66 , with an average value of 30.64 so the anthropogenic contribution could be considered besides the natural occurrence .
the efc range of cu 1.43 - 25.35 with the average of 11.06 indicate that natural source was all , but also anthropogenic contribution was so high .
the efc range of zn was 0.11 - 18.27 with an average of 4.67 indicated that there were some anthropogenic contribution .
to observe the non - crustal ( anthropogenic ) contribution on measured metal concentrations , their efc - al diagrams are prepared and shown in fig. 5d. from figures it is seen that most of the elements are independent of al concentrations when al concentration > 67.50 ng / m3 .
however , efc of these elements decreases with increasing al concentration at lower al concentrations which is a typical behavior of elements with non - crustal sources [ 9 ]. fig. 5 a. cr enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.30. b. fe enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.59. c. cu enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.05. d. zn enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.34. e. cd enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.17. f. pb enrichment factor versus al concentration ( efc - al ) r = + 0.30 conclusions based on the results of this research , the concentrations of cr and fe in the ambient air of istanbul ( tuzla region ) indicate that their presence in the aerosol comes from ( depends on ) crustal origin .
the enrichment factor of tuzla aerosol were found cd > pb > cu > zn in a decreasing order .
it may not be possible to make any generalization about the episodic concentration changes of the metals due to their different origin .
but , almost all the metal concentrations are low at june paralleling to pm concentrations .
to determine the emission sources of these metals , it is recommended to do more detailed and comprehensive study .
the planned study must include wind transportation from industrial smokestacks and organized industrial areas located near the residential location in tuzla region .
for this reason all the meteorological parameters especially wind direction data could be available locally .
when metals are introduced to atmosphere , they are passing through water and soil .
then , they are taken by living organisms via ingestion , inhalation and skin absorption .
in conclusion , this work results are a basic source for future studies and the study will be unique and a useful model for other industrial areas to determine pollution in a large range entirely on account of having examined inorganic pollutants .

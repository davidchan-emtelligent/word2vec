ten species of copestylum ( diptera : syrphidae ) were reared from fruits and flowers in costa rica , ecuador and trinidad .
seven were new and in this paper , we describe them , their development sites and the third stage larva and / or the puparium of all ten species .
one new synonym is proposed , copestylum pinkusi ( curran ) [= copestylum cinctiventre ( curran )] .
similarities and differences between these new and other copestylum species , suggest they separate into two groups , referred to as the vagum and cinctiventre species groups .
features characterising these groups for both adult and early stages are assessed .
each species was also distinguished using adult and early stage characters .
within the vagum group , adults were more disparate morphologically than the larval stage ; this was reversed in the cinctiventre group .
adult colour patterns are probably cryptic in function and for disguise .
vagum species have disruptive marks , while the cinctiventre species have reflective colours .
biologically , the groups are almost distinguished by larval development sites .
vagum species use predominantly fruits and have a larval stage that is relatively generalised in form and habit .
cinctiventre species are confined to developing in flowers and the larva is more specialised .
a key to both adult and early stages of all ten species is provided .
fieldwork was funded by the aecid , agencia espanola de cooperacion internacional para el desarrollo , ministerio de asuntos exteriores y de cooperacion ( a / 4426 / 05 , a / 6788 / 06 , a / 3415 / 05 , a / 020305 / 08 and a / 019887 / 08 ; www.aecid.es ) .
the taxonomic study was funded by the s.w. williston diptera research fund of the smithsonian institution ( http :// entomology.si.edu /) and the pelham - clinton fellowship fund of the national museums scotland ( e.c. pelham - clinton fellowship , reference nms10 / 73 ; www.nms.ac.uk ). data availabilityall relevant data are within the paper .

introduction the chiefly neotropical genus , copestylum macquart , 1846 ( diptera : syrphidae ) , is exceptionally large with 400 + species and many more undescribed [ 1 , 2 ] .
adults are distinguished by a plumose arista , straight or recessive apical crossvein and pleuron with bare anterior anepisternum and posterior anepimeron [ 3 ] .
larval stages are saprophagous in a huge array of decaying plant materials and in the third (= final ) stage , are distinguished from other syrphid larvae by mandibles that are inverted into the thorax and anal segment divided into two sections , the basal section of which has two pairs of lappets of unequal length [ 2 ] .
enabling reference to species sharing distinctive biological or morphological features , 26 heuristic , yet putatively monophyletic , species groups are recognised within copestylum [ 2 ] .
all species considered here , fall into one or other of two of these groups that are here referred to by the specific name of a common member species , the vagum and cinctiventre groups .
within copestylum many taxonomic and nomenclatural problems exist with interspecific variation negligible between some species and greater in others [ 4 ] .
intraspecific variation also occurs , but is poorly understood and documented [ 1 ] .
in this paper , the third of a series dealing with reared copestylum [ 2 , 5 ] , three named and seven new species obtained mainly from fruits and flowers are investigated that have necessitated dealing with these problems .
materials and methods adults were obtained mainly by finding and rearing larvae and puparia in areas of decay in live fruits or in wholly decayed fruits , as well as in live and decaying flowers of understorey plants in costa rica , ecuador and trinidad at various times from 1998 to 2011 .
in costa rica , specimens were collected from national parks under the inbio - minae (' ministerio de ambiente , energia y mares ' , costa rica ) agreement for the costa rican national biodiversity inventory organised by the costa rican national institute of biodiversity .
in ecuador , permission to collect was obtained from professor giovanni onore , director of the ' fundacion otonga ' who owns and manages this cloud forest reserve .
in trinidad , specimens were collected under permission from the ministry of the environment and water resources , government of trinidad to the university of glasgow expedition society .
the fieldwork did not involve endangered or threatened species .
larvae were reared by placing them in plastic bags or tubs with small quantities of decay from the material they were collected from or whole , infested fruits or flowers were placed into containers .
pin holes were made to ensure air exchange and containers were stored in cool , shaded conditions .
every few days , they were examined for puparia .
to ensure association with the correct adult , puparia were removed and reared individually in separate containers .
after allowing 1 - 2 days for hardening , emerged adults were usually fixed by freezing .
adults were identified using keys , original descriptions and named specimens including holotypes , in various collections , particularly the instituto nacional de biodiversidad , costa rica , united states national museum , washington , u.s.a. and the natural history museum , london , uk. for morphological descriptions , adult body length was measured from the apex of the frontal prominence on the head to the apex of abdominal tergite 5 , thorax width from tegula to tegula and wing length from the tegula at the wing base to the apex .
in the text , t = tergite , s = sternites .
male genitalia were examined by relaxing specimens and removing genitalia with an entomological pin , clearing in a hot solution of koh for up to 10 minutes , immersing in glacial acetic acid to remove excess koh , washing in 70 % alcohol and storing in microvials containing glycerol .
drawings were made with a fsa 25 pe drawing tube attached to a stereo microscope .
adult images were made using a canon 7d mark ii camera with a canon mp - e 65mm f 2.8 lens and an automated focus stacker , cognisys stackshot 3x mounted on a kaiser r1 copy stand , stacked using zerene stacker software and adjusted using adobe photoshop .
early stage images were made using a canon powershot s100 camera attached to a wild m5 stereo microscope or with the built in camera of an olympus bx51 compound microscope .
under sections headed ' material examined ' , l = date larva collected ; p = date puparium formed ; a = date adult emerged ; other abbreviations are indicated in brackets ('...')
when first mentioned .
terminology for the adult stage follows thompson [ 6 ] , except that we distinguish between two pollinose states referred to here as dust which is short microtrichia , such as appears under the antennae and tomentum which consists of longer , dense , planiform ( flattened ) , silvery white to yellow microtrichia , such as appears on the sides of the face in certain cinctiventre species ( fig 1 ) .
we also use the term , aedeagal hood , to refer to a morphologically variable structure at the apex of the hypandrium , a position shared with the hook - like , superior lobes which are dorsal relative to aedeagal hood ( fig 2 ) .
terminology for the early stages follows rotheray & gilbert [ 7 ] .

species group diagnoses are based on shared characters from member species considered here and obtained from the external morphology of adults , including male genitalia and for early stages , the third stage larva and / or the puparium .
species diagnoses include specific states of variable characters at group level and unique or unique combinations of characters that distinguish species .
these and other features are further compared and contrasted under taxonomic notes .
within species groups , the sequence of species is alphabetical by specific name .
original descriptions of three reared species that were named prior to this study lacked the detail required to distinguish them from other species in the same group .
original descriptions and types of these three species were assessed and descriptions amplified by additional character data , noting particularly , where reared material differed from type specimens .

taxonomic notes : adult stages are similar to those of the chalybescens species group [ 5 ] , but differ from them in lacking the defining feature of that group , a pair of oval - shaped , slightly depressed areas at the base of the scutellum bearing a rugose surface similar to that in the apical depression .
members of the vagum group are also more pilose , with longer pile .
some vagum group species are similar to certain macula group ( g.e. rotheray , a. ricarte & m.a. marcos - garcia unpubl .
data ) species that have mostly shiny , lightly pollinose faces , but these species differ from the vagum group in having a group of long , thick setae at the apex of the mid femora and thick , elongate setae in a row along the rear margin of the scutum .
larval and puparial stages are most similar to those of the chalybescens group , sharing with them abdominal segments 5 - 7 lacking prolegs or if prolegs are present , they are smaller and have fewer crochets than on segments 1 - 4 .
a character that seems to separate some early stages of the two groups is the more developed groups of spicules on the antero - ventral margin of the metathorax in the vagum group .
adults of the vagum group vary in colour patterns both between and within species .
sub - groups can be recognised on the basis of a shared pattern of colours , others on the basis of shared structures .
a colour pattern sub - group is centred on copestylum vagum ( wiedemann , 1830 ) which for all legs has coxae , trochanters and femora yellow to brown except for the femoral apices and the rest of the leg which is black and t3 - 4 yellow fasciate .
a sub - group recognizable on morphological features is one based on c. gertschi ( curran , 1939 ) , species of which have a narrow sulcus at the apex of the scutellum instead of a depression .
another is based on c. sexmaculatum ( palisot de beauvois , 1819 ) and characterised by shiny , pellucid wings with areas clear of microtrichia .

etymology : the epithet ' araceorum ' meaning ' from araceae plants' refers to the development site of this species ( fig 12c ) .
taxonomic notes : the adult of this species differs from all other vagum group species considered here by its all black legs .
other species have yellow or orange marked legs .
copestylum araceorum is also darker in overall colour pattern than other species and has fully pigmented , shiny black , facial vittae .
early stages are distinguished from all other species of the vagum group by the long , thick and dense vestiture that disguises the lappets on the anal segment and the pupal spiracles which are short , being only about as long as their distance apart .
copestylum araceorum is most similar to c. willistoni and c. cyclops in having a central vitta on the face and in the early stages it is most similar to c. willistoni in having prolegs with crochets on the first 6 abdominal segments .
in c. cyclops and other vagum group species , prolegs with crochets are absent on segment 6 .
apart from short pupal spiracles , c. araceorum is readily distinguished from c. willistoni by the apex of the breathing tube which tapers towards the apex and is smooth , shining and lacks punctures , punctured in c. willistoni .
biology : adults reared from spathes of more than one araceae species .
species only known from costa rica and ecuador .

all male paratypes with genitalia dissected [ inbio , nms & ceua ] .
etymology : the latin epithet ' cyclops' refers to the one - eyed giant , cyclops , in greek mythology and is given to this species because of extensive eye contiguity which gives ' one - eyed ' appearance to this syrphid .
taxonomic notes : c. cyclops varies in colour .
on the face , the central vitta can be faint , reduced or even absent .
the scutum ranges from yellow to dark orange and can also be wholly pale .
the dorsum of t3 and 4 ranges from extensively light brown ( with posterior margins of terga black ) to jet black with lateral faded spots. c. cyclops is , nonetheless , distinguished from most vagum group species by the presence of a central , black vitta on the face , a character shared only with c. willistoni and c. araceorum .
it can be distinguished from these latter two species by the pile of the front and mid femora which in c. cyclops is yellow to orange in the basal third ; in contrast these femora are entirely coated in black pile in c. willistoni and c. araceorum .
if the facial vitta is faint , the yellow to orange pile in the basal third of the mid - femora separates c. cyclops and c. musicanum from all other vagum group species lacking a central vitta. c. cyclops can be distinguished from c. musicanum by the shape of the eyes which are dorsally flattened ( fig 4b ) .
the early stages of c. cyclops differs from others of the vagum group by the relatively short , posterior breathing tube with the transverse ridge at about the mid - point of the length of the tube and the obvious , deep punctures above the transverse ridge. of the four vagum group species studied here , a short posterior breathing tube with the ridge at about the mid - point is shared only with c. tenorium , but the tube is lightly and inconspicuously punctured in that species .
the pupal spiracles of these two species have bands that are interrupted on both dorsal and ventral surfaces with a narrow clear strip between the bands .
in c. cyclops , the dorsal strip is wider and complete to the apex , in c. tenorium the cleared strip is narrower and the top two bands are complete and not interrupted .
biology : adults were reared most frequently from decaying fruits of species of malvaceae and sapotaceae and also from under decaying bark of an unidentified shrub .
this species is only known from costa rica .

taxonomic notes : the adult stage of c. musicanum is distinguished from other vagum group adults by colour of the legs which have the coxae and trochanters and extreme bases of the femora yellow and the rest of the legs darkened .
the male genitalia are also distinctive in having , in lateral view , a l - shaped cercus and surstylus .
the male genitalia of c. trigrinum also have a l - shaped surstylus , but the cercus is triangular in profile shape among other differences ( figs 17a , 17b , 19a and 19b ) .
the early stages of c. musicanum are most similar to those of c. vagum .
they both have pupal spiracles longer than their distance apart and long posterior breathing tubes , about or more than the maximum width of the larval or puparial body with the transverse ridge well above the middle of the tube .
the early stages of c. musicanum can be distinguished from those of c. vagum by the apex of the posterior breathing tube above the transverse ridge which is mostly smooth and shining , this part more frequently and more deeply punctured in c. vagum .

all male paratypes with genitalia dissected [ inbio , nms , ceua ] .
etymology : the epithet tenorium refers to the tenorio volcano national park , the type locality of this species .
taxonomic notes : males are generally darker than females .
among the vagum group species examined here , c. tenorium is most similar to c. vagum in having greenish t2 - 4 with narrow , black , apical margins that lack yellow spots and marks. c. tenorium is readily distinguished from c. vagum by the completely yellow to orange pleuron which in c. vagum is black marked .
males of these two species are readily separated in that only c. tenorium has the dorsal margin of the eyes flattened and the indented surstylus is unique among all vagum group species examined here .
the early stages of c. tenorium are most similar to c. cyclops .
both species have a relatively short posterior breathing tube , less than larval or puparial width and with the transverse ridge at about the mid - point of the length of the tube. c. tenorium is readily distinguished from c. cyclops by the pupal spiracles which are oval in cross sectional shape with the bands bearing spiracles interrupted on both dorsal and ventral margins by a clear strip and the posterior breathing tube which is lightly and inconspicuously punctured .
biology : adults were reared from decaying fruits of species of fabaceae and sapotaceae and also from an unidentified bromeliad ( bromeliaceae ) and a decaying palm stump ( palmaceae ) .
this species is only known from costa rica .

paratypes with genitalia dissected [ hm & nms ] .
etymology : the epithet ' tigrinum ' refers to the similarity between the black and yellow marks of a tiger and the black and yellow fasciae on the abdomen of this species .
taxonomic notes : c. tigrinum is similar to c. musicanum in that t3 has a pair of inclined , comma - shaped fasciae , usually meeting medially , but these fasciae sometimes reduced to spots in c. musicanum .
the male genitalia of these two species are also similar in having l - shaped surstyli in lateral view but the cerci are triangular in lateral view , not l - shaped as in c. musicanum .
in both sexes , a difference between these two species is the jet black tibia in c. tigrinum which in c. musicanum is dark yellow .
early stages are most similar to c. musicanum and c. vagum in having long posterior breathing tubes , longer than larval or puparial width and with the transverse ridge above the middle of the length of the tube. c. tigrinum appears to be most easily distinguished by the scattered punctures at the apex of the breathing tube in contrast to the more obvious ones of c. vagum and the lack of punctures in c. musicanum .
biology : adults were reared from decaying fruits of malvaceae and this species is only known from trinidad .

taxonomic notes : although wiedemann [ 8 ] described c. vagum as being green , the holotype is orange and has probably faded with time .
this may also explain colour variation of other c. vagum specimens .
individuals vary in the colour of the scutum and pleuron , as well as in the size of the male cercus ( fig 22a - 22c ) .
the scutum can be yellow with a black macula at the rear margin ( holotype and specimens from costa rica ) or bear a black vitta of variable width ( specimens from surinam and trinidad ) .
curran [ 9 ] refers to such variation in relation to specimens at the vienna museum .
the pleuron can be yellow ( holotype ) , yellow with black meron ( specimens from surinam and trinidad ) or yellow with black katepisternum , katepimeron and meron .
all specimens share the same general shape of the cercus , but in the holotype the cercus is broader than in other males we examined ( fig 22a - 22c ) .
slight differences can also be observed in the shapes of the surstylus and surstylar apodeme .
early stages are similar to those of c. musicanum and c. tigrinum in having a long posterior breathing tube , longer than body width and with the transverse ridge above the mid point of its length. c. vagum differs from these two species in having the apex of the posterior breathing tube with conspicuous punctures .
biology : adults were reared most frequently from costa rica and trinidad from decaying fruits of species of bignoniaceae and malvaceae .

etymology : the epithet ' willistoni ' refers to the american dipterologist samuel wendell williston , who described many copestylum and other diptera species during his working life .
taxonomic notes : the single specimen from trinidad differs from costa rican specimens in the following characters : scutum mostly yellow and with a few black pile only on the posterior margin and postalar callus , otherwise yellow pilose ; anepimeron extensively yellow ; scutellum yellow , only centrally dark brown .
the trinidadian specimen appears to be only a pale specimen of c. willistoni. c. willistoni is similar to c. araceorum and c. cyclops in having a central vitta on the face , although it is relatively faint in c. willistoni and c. cyclops. c. willistoni shares with c. araceorum black thoracic setae and mid femora entirely dark pilose .
in c. cyclops , the thoracic setae are orange and the mid femora pale pilose basally .
apart from a faint central vitta , c. willistoni differs from c. araceorum by the less pronounced central tubercle on the face , t3 mostly black pilose , only a few pale pile at the anterior margin and the different shapes of the surstylus and superior lobe .
early stages are most similar to c. araceorum in having prolegs with crochets on the first 6 abdominal segments .
in c. cyclops and other vagum group species , prolegs with crochets are absent on segment 6 .
apart from pupal spiracles longer than their distance apart , c. willistoni is readily distinguished from c. araceorum by the apex of the breathing tube which is squared - off apically and does not taper and is punctate .

taxonomic notes : adult stages of the cinctiventre species group reared here are distinguished by their metallic colouring , uniform metallic colour of the abdominal tergites , face with a dark background colour with tomentose side - stripes ( absent in c. azofeifa ) , scutum with short pile orientated anteriorly and long pile orientated posteriorly and lack of setae along the rear margin .
however , facial colours in other cinctiventre species are reversed , with yellow background colour and black vittae , eg copestylum roraima ( curran , 1939 ) .
in general form , they are close to the vagum and macula species groups , but macula group species have setae along the rear margin of the scutum and usually , lack a depression at the apex of the scutellum .
early stages are also similar to the vagum and macula species groups .
they are distinguished from the macula group by the absence or poor development of prolegs with crochets on abdominal segments 5 and 6 .
macula group species have prolegs with crochets on these segments and sometimes , segment 7 .
the uniform coating of vestiture in vittifacium species is also a distinguishing feature ; it usually forms transverse bands in the macula group .
early stages of cinctiventre species are distinguished from those of the vagum species by the presence of spicules on the dorsum of the prothorax and the posterior breathing tube .
above the transverse ridge in vagum group species , the posterior breathing tube is subcylindrical in cross - sectional shape , shiny and lightly punctured .
in the vittifacium group the posterior breathing tube is either flattened dorso - ventrally and wider above than below the transverse ridge or , if it is subcylindrical , it is conspicuously punctured , punctures light and inconspicuous in the vagum group .

thorax : pleuron dark metallic except for mid - anterior margin of the anterior anepisternum and the posterior half of the posterior anepisternum yellow marked ( fig 26 ) ; scutellum dark coloured , as the scutum , yellowish towards apex .
abdomen : tergites pale red to yellowish ( fig 26 ) ; dorsum and lateral margins of t2 yellow pilose , except at upper , postero - lateral margin which has some black pile and posterior margin narrowly black pilose ; t3 orange pilose in anterior half , black in posterior half ; t4 orange pilose in anterior third , black in the posterior two thirds ; male genitalia with surstylus triangular in lateral view , not curved back from the base and tapering towards the apex ( fig 31 ) ; hypandrium short , about 2x as long as wide and triangular in profile view ( fig 31 ) ; superior hook smoothly curved in lateral view ( fig 31 ) and , in apical view , apex narrowed and curving inwards ( fig 32a and 32b ) .
female : unknown early stages : anterior fold coated in curved spicules without long bases ( fig 37a ) , spicules extending between the longitudinal folds on dorsum of the prothorax ; antero - ventral margin of metathorax with a pair of linear bands of spicules ; posterior breathing tube long , base just over half as long as apex above the transverse ridge and square at the apex ( fig 42 ) ; above the transverse ridge , posterior breathing tube slightly flattened dorso - ventrally , shining with and along the midline , a few light punctures ( fig 42 ) ; vestiture comprising long , hair - like pile ( fig 40a ) ; upper half of pupal spiracles with 9 bands of spiracles and bent just below apex ; below bands base matt and rugose becoming smooth and shiny up to the bands .

j.a. azofeifa [ inbio ] .
etymology : the name in apposition ' azofeifa ' refers to jose antonio azofeifa (' tono ') , the inbio parataxonomist who collected the holotype .
taxonomic notes : the adult of this species is the most distinctive of the cinctiventre group studied here .
the vittae on the face are unique in the dorsal pair originating either side of the antennae rather than lower on the face as in other species and the bar - like shape of the lower vittae .
other unique features are the clear yellow marks on the anepisternum , the lack of tomentose maculae on the sides of the face and the smooth curve of the superior lobe in the male genitalia ( fig 31 ) .
early stages are readily distinguished from those of other cinctiventre species by the spicules coating the anterior fold at the front of the prothorax which have an apical hook and a short base , not longer than the apical hook is high and the lightly punctured posterior breathing tube .
biology : this species was only reared from a decaying araceae flower .
it is only known from costa rica .

taxonomic notes : copestylum cinctiventre was introduced by curran [ 10 ] on the basis of a female collected from panama and c. pinkusi was introduced by curran [ 11 ] on the basis of 3 males collected from trinidad .
curran comments that c. pinkusi is related to c. cinctiventre , the difference between the two being in the colour of the pile on the scutum , being pale in c. cinctiventre and dark in c. pinkusi .
however , based on the reared material examined here , this is a sexual difference .
other differences between the descriptions of the two taxa provided by curran [ 10 , 11 ] are also probable sexual differences , such as the colour of the abdominal pile .
however , within our material , both males and females are variable in some of their colours .
for instance , the basoflagellomere varies from being yellow to being blackish ; the pile on t3 may or may be all black or black with orange pile anteriorly .
the sternites , particularly s2 , can be yellow or be darkened almost black .
the background colour of hind tibiae can be dark yellow to black .
across male colour variants and between males reared from costa rica and trinidad , no consistent differences in gross morphology , male genitalia and early stages were found .
on these grounds c. pinkusi is here synonymised under c. cinctiventre. c. cinciventre is similar to c. vittifacium ( hull , 1943 ) but , on the basis of comparing the holotypes , these two species can be separated by the following characters : in c. cinctiventre , the face is more produced forwards and the lateral yellow vittae are more conspicuous ; the scutellum has pale pile ; metabasitarsomere darker ; t2 & 3 with pale pile only , while in c. vittifacium the t2 with black pile antero - laterally , and the t3 has a band of black pile posteriorly. c. cinctiventre differs from c. roraima , a cinctiventre group species also reared from heliconia flowers [ 12 ] , in that the face of c. roraima has a yellow , not a black , background colour. c. cinctiventre is distinguished from other cinctiventre species reared here by sides of the face with two vittae , the dark anepisternum lacking yellow marks , superior lobe of the male genitalia with a short stem , not much longer than the length of the apical hook ( fig 30b ) .
early stages are readily distinguished by the spatulate form of the spicules coating the anterior fold at the front of the prothorax .
biology : adults were reared in costa rica and trinidad from heliconia flowers ( heliconiaceae ) , most frequently h. bihai , but also h. latispatha and h. tortuosa .

taxonomic notes : the adult of this species is very similar to c. cinctiventre .
it is distinguished from that species by the sides of the face with one vitta and the superior lobe of the male genitalia which has a corrugated outer margin ( fig 34a and 34b ) and a u - shaped inner margin between the apical hook and the base ( fig 30a ) .
early stages are readily distinguished by the short , punctured posterior breathing tube , spiculate vestiture and spicules of the anterior fold with long bases .
biology : adults were reared from renealmia flowers ( zingiberaceae ) .
this species is only known from costa rica .

all share a similar body size , shiny face , depression at the apex of the scutellum and absence of bristle - like setae at the rear margin of the scutum .
seven have the pile of the scutum orientated mostly posteriorly and t1 & 2 pale in colour , contrasting with the background colour of the rest of the thorax and abdomen .
these are referred to here as the vagum species group .
the remaining three species have metallic colouring , scutum with short pile orientated anteriorly and longer pile orientated posteriorly and t1 & 2 without a contrasting background colour to the rest of the thorax and abdomen .
they are referred to as the cinctiventre species group .
a group identifying character in the male genitalia is the apex of the hypandrium which has two elements , the superior lobe dorsally and the aedeagal hood ventrally .
in vagum species the aedeagal hood projects ventrally from the hypandrium and the surface of the superior lobe is smooth .
in the cinctiventre group , the aedeagal hood projects dorsally , almost between the hooked arms of the superior lobe which has slight projections , except c. azofeifa which lacks a dorsal projection to the aedeagal hood .
otherwise , in both groups , male genitalia have useful distinguishing characters at species level with variation found in the shape of the cercus , surstylus and superior lobe .
nonetheless , genitalia were more uniform in the cinctiventre than the vagum group , although fewer species were examined .
apart from genitalia , major axes of variation in the vagum group are the facial vittae , leg colour and the colour of pile coating them and the colour pattern of t3 & 4 .
axes of variation in the cinctiventre group are the states of facial vittae and tomentose marks and colour of the pleuron .
early stages also possess the key characters of the genus copestylum : inverted mandibles and anal segment divided into two sections , the basal section of which has two pairs of lappets of unequal length .
larvae of both species groups share the characters of linear rows of spicules on the antero - ventral , metathoracic margin , prolegs and crochets most developed on segments 1 - 3 or 4 , usually absent on abdominal segments 5 and 6 and always absent on segment 7 .
vagum group larvae possess the following distinguishing features : dorsum of the prothorax without spicules ; anterior breathing tube symmetrical , not pinched more on one margin and with 4 - 6 spiracles linearly arranged across the apex , prolegs with crochets on abdominal segments 1 - 4 , sometimes extending to abdominal segments 5 and 6 and , bands of spiracles almost reaching the base of the pupal spiracles .
across the vagum group species studied here , larvae are relatively uniform morphologically with the main axes of variation being minor differences in the size , shape and degree of puncturing of the posterior breathing tube .
cinctiventre group larvae possess the following distinguishing features : spicules extending from the anterior fold on to the dorsum of the prothorax ; anterior breathing tube asymmetrical , outer side indented more than the other with 6 + spiracles in a curved line across the apex , prolegs and crochets only on abdominal segments 1 - 3 and bands of spiracles on about two thirds the length of the pupal spiracles .
across the cinctiventre species studied here , larvae are more disparate than vagum group larvae with major variation in the form of the spicules coating the anterior fold , body vestiture and the length and degree of puncturing of the posterior breathing tube .
adult colour variations are frequent within vagum group species .
the taxonomic significance of such variation is difficult to assess .
it may be age - related , marks becoming stronger and darker with age , as is known for example , in the palaearctic syrphid , hammerschmidtia ferruginea ( fallen , 1817 ) [ 13 ] .
it may be related to rearing temperature , as is known in certain palaearctic syrphines [ 14 ] .
it may be post - mortem , such as green changing gradually to yellow or orange .
post - mortem change makes taxonomic comparison between recently and older collected specimens difficult , especially if specimens have in addition , faded .
suggesting that colour variation may be inherited , some colour combinations appear confined geographically , for example in c. vagum and c. cinctriventre as described above .
locality - associated colour patterns could be trivial , but could also indicate species complexes .
based on gross assessments of morphology presented here , it was not possible to determine the significance of colour varieties and we have treated them conservatively .
following this approach , we synonymise c. pinkusi under c. cinctiventre on the basis that the colour differences between them are sexual and no morphological evidence was found in either the adult or early stages to support a pinkusi species concept .
development sites development sites almost completely separate vagum and cinctiventre groups .
vagum species were mainly reared from decaying fruits ( fig 43 ) and cinctiventre species from flowers ( figs 35c and 36c ) .
except that is , for the vagum group species , c. araceorum and the cinctiventre group species , c. azofeifa , both of which were only reared from araceae spathes i.e. a spike of flowers enclosed within a bract ( fig 12c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142441.g043 fig 43 vagum species group development site .
decaying sapotaceae fruit , guanacaste national park , costa rica .
larvae of vagum group species were most frequent in decaying fruits that had fallen to the ground , although occasionally , they were found within decay on fruits still on the tree or shrub .
usually , several larvae were present , suggesting multiple oviposition by more than one female or batched egg laying by an individual .
the size of fruits containing larvae suggested that size per se was not a factor limiting larval abundance .
a more significant factor appears to be the amount of decay .
decaying fruits were not , however , the only development site used by vagum group species. c. cyclops was also reared from decaying material under epidermal tissue of an understorey plant , c. musicanum and c. tenorium from wet decay within dead palm stems ( palmaceae ) , c. tenorium from a decaying bromeliad ( bromeliaceae ) and c. willistoni from exuding tree sap .
larvae of the three cinctiventre group species studied here develop within flowers enclosed either by bracts , such as the heliconia flowers from which c. cinctriventre was reared and the araceae spathe from which c. azofeifa was reared or , a tubular calyx , such as the renealmia flowers from which c. ellenae was reared .
water was associated with enclosed flowers , either through rainfall being trapped or a by - product of decay processes or both .
wet conditions facilitate the build - up of microbial populations which probably provide opportunities for filter - feeding , saprophagous copestylum larvae .
unlike vagum group species , cinctiventre species were not reared from other development sites and they are probably more specialised .
further evidence of specialisation are morphological and behavioural features that appear to match particular conditions of access and food quality characterising development sites , see next section .
in being specialised , cinctiventre species are probably more vulnerable to downturns and extinctions than vagum species .
this is because under conditions of host plant declines , switching to another development site is not likely .
a corollary of this is that they probably make better environmental indicators than vagum group species , their abundance being more closely tied to that of their host plants .
this potential requires , however , improved understanding of their distribution and abundance relative to that of their host plants .
as with previous studies of bromeliads and cacti [ 2 , 5 ] and with other species surveys of neotropical syrphidae [ 15 ] , searching for development sites and rearing larvae is a particularly effective means of inventory .
given the proportionally limited geographical areas over which we worked , many additional copestylum species developing in fruits and flowers almost certainly await discovery .
functional morphology adult copestylum colour patterns conform to the expectations of mimicry in open habitats such as deserts and crypsis in shaded habitats , such as the understorey of forests [ 2 , 5 ] .
species of the two groups considered here were mainly reared in shaded or partially shaded habitats and their colour patterns are as expected , cryptic rather than mimetic .
for instance , vagum group species all possess a conspicuous , pale mark at the base of the abdomen .
this appears to be disruptive in function , in that it draws the attention of an observer more than the shape of the body .
disruptive marks are a feature of many cryptic animals [ 16 ] .
for visually hunting predators such as birds , they complicate formation of an effective search image .
search image formation is possibly further complicated by intraspecific variation in body colours that , as noted above , characterises most vagum group species examined here .
such variation is not apparent in cinctiventre group species and they are overall , less colourful .
adult cinctiventre species do not have such obvious disruptive marks .
instead , the overall body pattern is dark overlain with pile which varies in colour , size and orientation , especially that covering the scutum and abdominal tergites .
furthermore , the pleuron is patchily covered in dust and the face has contrasting yellow vittae and tomentose maculae .
the effect is an ever - changing kaleidoscope of flashing light and dark as the fly or observer move relative to one another .
in the shade , reflective colours such as these make animals bearing them difficult to visualise and hence , disguise them from visually hunting predators [ 16 ] .
in bromeliad and cactus developing copestylum , considerable variation exists in the shape and colours of the face and the morphology of the male genitalia [ 2 , 5 ] .
similarly , many vagum and cinctiventre species examined here , have species - specific facial colours and features of the male genitalia .
a possible explanation of such a pattern is that mate selection involves visual cues based on the face and tactile cues from the genitalia .
in support of visual cues , in males but not females , facets are larger on the top of the eyes and protected by longer pile than elsewhere .
furthermore , in some vagum group species , this part of the head is flattened and facets here are particularly large .
in one new species described here , this is recognised by the use of the epithet , cyclops , which refers to this condition .
vagum group larvae have relatively uniform and unmodified body shapes and lack specialised spicules .
this is unlike many copestylum species developing within decaying bromeliads and cacti whose larvae have diverse body shapes , each apparently matching particular conditions of access and large , hook - like spicules or , the anterior end coated in extensive and variable arrangements of small spicules [ 2 , 5 ] .
extensive and modified spicules not only protect the larval integument during movement , they also loosen and expose relatively fresh tissue to microbial decay , thereby creating more food and mutualisms between larvae and microbes probably exist .
plant tissues containing such larvae decay at more rapid rates than tissue without them [ 17 ] .
vagum group larvae are probably less effective at spreading decay relative to species with specialised spicules .
in other words , vagum group larvae appear to be relatively generalised in form and function , feeding on decay that is easily accessible and of an oily to soft solid consistency .
this is not the case with c. cinctiventre and c. ellenae .
unlike development sites used by c. azofeifa and most vagum group species , access is limited within heliconia and especially , renealmia flowers .
only one larva per flower was recorded and heliconia flowers are relatively long , while those of renealmia are short .
in heliconia flowers , c. cinctiventre larvae possess the remarkable facility to extend their bodies , 2x or more longer than an unextended larva .
these larvae were usually found in extended positions in the narrow space between the flower and the lower margin of the bract with the head pressed up against the base .
when removed , they contracted rapidly and lost this shape. c. ellenae larvae take up almost the entire space within the calyx of renealmia flowers and assumed within them , the opposite state of a short , contracted and broad body that was similarly lost when removed .
hence these larvae are able to manipulate body shape to fit access conditions at development sites .
for larvae of c. cinctiventre and c. ellenae , access conditions at development sites not only requires them to manipulate and squeeze their bodies into confined spaces , in front of them , they remove compacted layers of food or biofilm i.e. matrix enclosed , microbial accretions [ 18 ] .
this is in contrast to c. azofeifa and vagum group larvae that characteristically have more space and are immersed in oily to soft - solid food .
unlike c. azofeifa and vagum group species , the anterior folds of c. cinctiventre and c. ellenae are coated in modified spicules , spatulate in c. cinctiventre and long - based in c. ellenae .
these different types of spicules are probably alternative solutions for loosening and removing compacted biofilm coating surfaces inside the flower or , they help remove plant tissue which subsequently decays to provide food .
if the latter , these larvae may have mutualisms with microbes in a similar way to some bromeliad and cacti developing larvae mentioned above .
amounts of wet decay and available space within araceae spathes and decaying fruits is , by comparison , much greater and in c. azofeifa and vagum group larvae , the spicules on the anterior fold are unspecialised , having the usual , hook - like form of most saprophagous syrphid larvae .
the larva of both c. cinctiventre and c. ellenae differ in additional ways relative to c. azofeifa .
the posterior breathing tube of c. ellenae is the shortest of all those studied here , less than half the length of the breathing tube above the transverse ridge .
the larvae of c. ellenae do not require a long breathing tube because the calyx of renealmia flowers is about as long as the larva and a short breathing tube is sufficient to reach the open air .
in contrast , the breathing tube of c. cinctiventre is the longest of the 3 cinctiventre species and in heliconia flowers which are themselves long , length is probably required to enable the larva to project the tip above the water for air exchange .
finally , the larva of c. ellenae has specialised vestiture comprising stunted , spicule - like pile ( fig 40b ) .
vestiture is probably modified in c. ellenae to facilitate protection and / or holding on via frictional forces since , within the confined space of a renealmia calyx , it is not just the ventral but also the lateral and dorsal aspects of the body that are in contact with the calyx .
to pupate , the larva of c. ellenae turns round in the calyx and pupates within it which facilitates the adult escaping from the development site .
the integument has a reddish tinge anteriorly , reminiscent of the colour of renealmia seeds and in situ , the two can be difficult to tell apart .
this might be protective resemblance in the puparium of c. ellenae .
the puparium of c. cinctiventre was never found in situ and it seems probable that the larva pupates outside the flower .

the annual incidence of npc is 15 - 50 cases per 100,000 [ 1 ] .
npc differs from other head and neck cancers in its epidemiology , association with epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , and high risk of distant metastasis [ 2 ] .
radiotherapy ( rt ) is the primary treatment for nonmetastatic disease [ 3 , 4 ] .
intensity modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) is the most frequently recommended radiation method , if conditions permit , because of excellent local control .
concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( ccrt ) is recommended as a first line therapy for locally advanced npc [ 5 , 6 ] .
induction chemotherapy has been combined in several studies to improve clinical outcomes , but it remains controversial [ 7 - 9 ] .
distant metastasis is the major cause of mortality in npc patients .
quality of life ( qol ) has been considered to be a prognostic factor for cancer patients , such as for head and neck cancer [ 10 , 11 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma [ 12 ] , colorectal cancer [ 13 ] , liver cancer [ 14 ] and lung cancer [ 15 ] .
few studies have explored the prognostic significance of pretreatment qol in npc [ 16 , 17 ] .
therefore , we conducted a prospective study using two self - administered questionnaires , the european oganization for research and treatment of cancer ( eortc ) quality of life questionnaire c30 ( qlq - c30 ) and the eortc qlq head and neck cancer - specific module ( h & n35 ) , to assess the pretreatment qol scores [ 18 ] .
we assumed that felt ill among the h & n35 questionaire was significantly associated with pfs .
methods patients we performed a prospective , longitudinal study on 554 newly diagnosed patients with npc in the sun yat - sen university cancer center from april 2011 to january 2015 .
a total of 501 consecutive npc patients were included in this study .
this study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the sun yat - sen university cancer center , and the participants provided written informed consent .
patients with the following characteristics were excluded : those with distant metastasis at initial diagnosis ( n = 10 ) , those lost to follow - up posttreatment ( n = 2 ) , those whose treatment was interrupted ( n = 1 ) , those who were unable to complete the questionnaire pretreatment ( n = 1 ) , those who were unable to complete the questionnaire posttreatment ( n = 3 ) , those who were unable to complete the questionnaire three months posttreatment ( n = 3 ) , those who did not test for eaiga and vcaiga before treatment ( n = 10 ) , those who did not test for ebv dna before treatment ( n = 17 ) , and those who did not test for ebv dna value posttreatment ( n = 7 ) .
all patients were given a complete physical examination , a fiber - optic nasopharyngoscopy , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the head and neck , chest radiography , abdominal sonography , electrocardiography , bone scan or pet / ct , complete blood count with a differential count , biochemical profile , and epstein - barr virus serology .
qol assessments the self - administered eortc qlq - c30 ( version 3.0 ) and the qlq - h & n35 questionnaires were prospectively given to the enrolled patients [ 18 - 20 ] .
the questionnaires are used by a large number of research groups in cancer clinical trials and have also been used in various other , non - trial studies .
the taiwan chinese version was available and easily completed by our patients .
patients were asked to complete the chinese version of the eortc qlq - c30 ( version 3.0 ) and qlq - h & n35 questionnaires before treatment .
the qlq - c30 contains 15 scales : five functional scales ( physical , role , emotional , cognitive , and social functioning ) , three symptom scales ( fatigue , nausea and vomiting , pain ) , six single - item symptom scales ( dyspnea , insomnia , appetite loss , constipation , diarrhea , financial difficulties ) , and one global health status / qol scale .
the qlq - h & n35 is meant for use among head and neck cancer patients with varying disease stages and treatment modalities .
the qlq - h & n35 is composed of seven multi - item symptom scales ( pain , swallowing , sensation , speech , eating from a social perspective , social interactions , and sexuality ) and 11 single - item symptom scales ( teeth , opening mouth , dry mouth , sticky saliva , coughing , felt ill , pain medication use , nutritional supplementation , feeding tube requirement , weight loss , and weight gain ) .
all of the scales and items ranged in score from 0 to 100 .
a high score for a functional or global qol scale represents a relatively high / healthy level of functional or global qol , whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high number of symptoms or problems .
study treatments rt techniques all patients ( 501 patients ) were treated with imrt .
the dose fractionation and total dose of imrt for npc patients followed the guidelines of our institute [ 21 , 22 ] , which are in accordance with the international commission on radiation units and measurements reports 50 and 62 .
all the target volumes were depicted slice - by - slice on the treatment planning computed tomography scan .
the primary nasopharyngeal gross tumor volume ( gtvnx ) and the involved cervical lymph nodes were determined based on imaging , clinical , and endoscopic findings .
the enlarged retropharyngeal nodes together with primary gross tumor volume ( gtv ) were outlined as the gtvnx on the imrt plans .
the first clinical tumor volume ( ctv1 ) was defined as the area from 0.5 - 1.0 cm outside the gtv , a site that involves potential sites of local infiltration .
the clinical target volume 2 ( ctv2 ) was defined as the margin from 0.5 - 1.0 cm around ctv1 and the lymph node draining area ( levels ii , iii , and iv ) .
for stage n1 - 3 patients , the lower neck area received conventional anterior cervical field radiation with a midline shield to 50 gy in daily fractions of 2 gy. for patients with stage n0 disease , rt was not delivered to the lower neck area .
the prescribed dose was 66 - 70 gy to the planning target volume ( ptv ) , 60 gy to ptv1 , 54 gy to ptv2 , and 60 - 66 gy to the ptv of the involved cervical lymph nodes in 30 to 33 fractions .
in total , 30 - 33 fractions were administered at 1 fraction per day , 5 days per week .
chemotherapy patients with clinical stage i were treated with rt alone .
patients with stage ii - iva were treated with ccrt or induction chemotherapy + ccrt .
a total of 249 ( 49.7 %) patients received induction chemotherapy followed by ccrt , the regimen of induction chemotherapy regimens were various regimens of based on cisplatin .
overall , 214 ( 42.7 %) patients received concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin. of the 214 patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy of cisplatin regimen , a total of 37 patients received cumulative cisplatin dose of < 100 mg / m2 , 123 patients received cumulative cisplatin dose of 101 - 200 mg / m2 and 54 patients received cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 - 300 mg / m2 .
a total of 38 patients ( 7.6 %) were treated with rt alone .
follow - up and study endpoints patients were followed up every 3 months throughout the first 3 years , every 6 months for the next 2 years and annually thereafter .
physical examinations , nasopharyngoscopic examinations , mris , chest x - rays , abdominal ultrasounds and ebv dna tests were performed at each follow - up visit .
the follow - up duration was calculated from the first day of treatment to either the day of death or the day of the last examination .
the median follow - up duration was 32 months ( 6 - 57 months ) .
the primary end point of this study was progression free survival ( pfs ) , and the secondary end points were overall survival ( os ) , local recurrence - free survival ( lrfs ) and distant free survival ( dmfs ) .
pfs was defined as the time from treatment of npc to events that included death or disease progression at local , regional , or distant sites or until the date of the last follow - up. os was defined as the time from treatment of npc to the date of death or until the date of the last follow - up. lrfs was defined as the time from treatment of npc to the absence of a primary site or neck lymph node relapse or until the date of the last follow - up. dmfs was defined as the time from treatment of npc to the date of the first observation of distant metastases or until the date of the last follow - up. the last follow - up date was february 6 , 2016 .
statistical methods all analyses were performed using spss version 18.0 ( version 18.0 ; spss inc. , chicago , iii ) .
all tests were 2 - tailed .
the correlation between ebv dna and qol scale was analyzed by spearman 's correlation . univariate analysis measured by the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the p value of each qol scale from qlq - c30 and h & n35 .
when the p value of the qol scale in univariate analysis was less than 0.05 , the scale was separately calculated by multivariate analysis adjusted for age (< 45 vs. >= 45 ) , gender ( male vs. female ) , marriage ( yes vs. no ) , education (< high school vs. >= high school ) , smoking history ( yes vs. no ) , alcohol history ( yes vs. no ) , t stage ( t1,2 vs. t3,4 ) , n stage ( n1,2 vs. n3,4 ) , pre - treatment ebv dna (< 4000 vs. >= 4000 ) and post - treatment ebv dna ( negative vs. positive ) .

until now , only one study had explored the prognostic significance of qol in qlq - c30 questionnaires by assessing 254 npc patients who received imrt and 93 patients who received 3dcrt [ 17 ] .
to our knowledge , this is the first large scale study of npc patients in the imrt era that prospectively explored functional scales and symptom scales in both qlq - 30 and h & n35 .
we found that global health status significantly correlates with ebv dna .
high pretreatment ebv dna level always associates with large tumor or multiple lymph nodes which represents advanced stage .
patients with advanced stage represents poor quality of life scores .
this may be the possible explanation for global health status significantly correlates with ebv dna .
in addition , pretreatment appetite loss was significantly correlated with ebv dna .
we found that pretreatment teeth , opening mouth , feeding tube was significantly correlated with ebv dna .
this is the first time that the correlation between quality of life and ebv dna is reported .
the exact mechanism remains unknown .
more studies about the correlation between quality of life and ebv dna is expected to do in the future .
in the present study , pretreatment teeth in qlq - h & n35 predicted longer pfs .
this result may be explained by a sensitivity to radiotherapy resulting in uncomfortable sensation in the teeth .
the exact mechanism is unknown .
interestingly , felt ill pretreatment in qlq - h & n35 predicted shorter dmfs in multivariate analysis .
the possible explanation would be as follows .
at the beginning of treatment , pain mostly comes from large tumor region , probably because of invasion along the cranial nerve .
large tumors of head and neck cancers or npc are significantly associated with distant metastasis .
a previous study found that pretreatment pain influences os in 2340 newly diagnosed patients with head and neck squamous cancer [ 23 ] .
we found that a high cognitive functioning score pretreatment in qlq - c30 predicted longer lrfs .
this finding is consistent with previous studies in head and neck cancer [ 24 ] and npc [ 17 ] .
the exact mechanism of why cognitive function correlates with survival is unknown .
the causative relationship between cognitive functioning and survival is indeterminate .
cognitive functioning might be a surrogate for the qol scales that were potentially prognostic , and we speculate that it may display as a physiological appearance for some undetected predictive factors .
in this study , post treatment ebv dna predicted os better than pretreatment ebv dna .
using multivariate analysis , posttreatment ebv dna significantly predicted os for npc patients in this study .
pretreatment ebv dna did not show predict value of os in this study in multivariate analysis , revealed that the prognostic value of pretreatment ebv dna was covered up by posttreatment ebv dna in this study .
this finding is consistent with previous studies .
a recent study explored ebv dna loading of 273 npc patients at different time points and found that post treatment ebv dna was significantly associated with pfs , dmfs and os [ 25 ] .
several studies in taiwan concluded that post treatment ebv dna was an important independent prognostic factor for clinical outcomes [ 26 , 27 ] .
our results revealed that qol and post treatment ebv dna can effectively predict survival for npc patients .
the results provide a promising way to guide treatment strategy for npc patients .
our study has several strengths .
first , the present study has the longest longitudinal collection of qol data that has been used to examine prognostic value during the initial management of patients with npc .
second , this is the first time that qol scores in qlq - h & n35 were found to predict survival for npc patients .
our study evaluated the prognostic significance of qol using both the qlq - c30 questionnaire and qlq - h & n35 questionnaire .
there were some limitations in the present study .
first , this is a single center study in a high incidence area in southern china .
future studies are needed to calculate the prognostic significance of qol in npc patients in other areas in the world .
second , the median follow - up time of this study was 32 months ; a longer follow - up time is needed to further validate our results .
conclusions in conclusion , our analysis confirms that pretreatment teeth and felt ill was significantly associated with pfs in npc patients treated with imrt .
in addition , the posttreatment ebv dna was significantly associated with os. appendix table 7 the correlation between quality of life scales among eortc qlq - c30 and ebv dna scale beta p global health status / qol 0.105 0.019 physical functioning 0.001 0.983 role functioning 0.082 0.066 emotional functioning 0.081 0.071 cognitive functioning 0.059 0.184 social functioning 0.056 0.208 fatigue - 0.080 0.071 nausea and vomiting - 0.057 0.203 pain - 0.048 0.280 dyspnoea - 0.080 0.074 insomnia - 0.081 0.069 appetite loss - 0.104 0.020 constipation - 0.042 0.351 diarrhea - 0.059 0.184 financial difficulties - 0.057 0.203 abbrevations .

the active transport of glycolytic pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane is thought to involve two mitochondrial pyruvate carrier subunits , mpc1 and mpc2 , assembled as a 150 kda heterotypic oligomer .
here , the recombinant production of human mpc through a co - expression strategy is first described ; however , substantial complex formation was not observed , and predominantly individual subunits were purified .
in contrast to mpc1 , which co - purifies with a host chaperone , we demonstrated that mpc2 homo - oligomers promote efficient pyruvate transport into proteoliposomes .
the derived functional requirements and kinetic features of mpc2 resemble those previously demonstrated for mpc in the literature .
distinctly , chemical inhibition of transport is observed only for a thiazolidinedione derivative .
the autonomous transport role for mpc2 is validated in cells when the ectopic expression of human mpc2 in yeast lacking endogenous mpc stimulated growth and increased oxygen consumption .
multiple oligomeric species of mpc2 across mitochondrial isolates , purified protein and artificial lipid bilayers suggest functional high - order complexes .
significant changes in the secondary structure content of mpc2 , as probed by synchrotron radiation circular dichroism , further supports the interaction between the protein and ligands .
our results provide the initial framework for the independent role of mpc2 in homeostasis and diseases related to dysregulated pyruvate metabolism .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction nearly four decades after the demonstration of the protein - mediated transport of pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane ( imm ) 1 , two concurrent studies identified the oligomeric complex formed by mpc1 and mpc2 as necessary and sufficient for this task2,3 ; mpc1 and mpc2 were proposed to function together via the formation of an oligomeric structure of approximately 150 kda2 .
these original findings inspired many subsequent investigations that have further characterized mpc - dependent pyruvate transport in the cellular context4 - 6 , with multiple groups showing that either the loss of mpc1 or mpc2 in mitochondria is sufficient to confer similar loss of function phenotypes6 - 11 .
however , to date , the isolation and reconstitution of mpc1 : mpc2 into proteoliposomes is still considered necessary to perform the ultimate proof - of - concept experiment to measure pyruvate transport9,12,13 .
in this context , we report the first successful , large - scale , recombinant production and functional reconstitution of this family of solute carriers in an artificial lipid bilayer .
we provide an unprecedented in vitro demonstration that human mpc2 functions independently of mpc1 to induce pyruvate transport , possibly as high - order oligomers .
transport activity is independently demonstrated via both the canonical import of radiolabeled substrate and a novel enzymatic assay that quantifies the decrease of extravesicular pyruvate .
in cells , the ectopic expression of human mpc2 improved oxygen consumption and stimulated growth under nutrient - depleted conditions compared to yeast cells lacking endogenous mpc .
most importantly , these observations are consistent with those of early and recent publications , suggesting that mitochondrial pyruvate transport by mpc is a rapid and specific process that depends on co - proton import and redox balance and is sensitive to inhibition by a small molecule14 - 17 .
our findings open a discussion concerning pyruvate import regulation by at least two different molecular entities in human mitochondria : heterotypic mpc1 : mpc2 and homotypic mpc2 : mpc2 .
our work also has immediate implications for the development of small - molecule - oriented therapeutics that specifically target mpc2 in pyruvate - related diseases such as cancer , alzheimer 's disease , and diabetes9,13,18 - 21 .
results purification of recombinant mpc human mpc1 and mpc2 proteins were co - expressed from codon - optimized genes in a heterologous yeast system ( saccharomyces cerevisiae jry472 ) that was modified to lack endogenous mpc ( deltampc1 / 2 / 3 ) .
this mutant strain is hereafter referred to as 3delta2 .
a bi - directional expression plasmid was initially engineered to contain mpc1 fused to an 8xhis tag and mpc2 linked to a cleavable monomeric gfp ( fig. 1a ) .
this system enabled the detection of inducible expression levels and cellular compartmentalization as well as subsequent purification via cobalt - based immobilized metal affinity chromatography ( co - imac ) of the target complex .
controlled expression ( supp. figure 1a ) and proper mitochondrial localization of mpc were confirmed ( fig. 1a , left panel and supp. figure 1b ) .
n - dodecyl - beta - d - maltoside ( ddm , at 1 %) was identified as a suitable detergent for the extraction of proteins from membrane pellets .
the target proteins were purified via co - imac , followed by gel - filtration chromatography ( gf ) , both of which were carried out in the presence of 0.03 % ddm ( fig. 1a , center panel ) .
a sharp monodisperse peak was obtained after gf , which corresponded to a molecular weight of 64 kda for the protein - detergent complex ( fig. 1a , right panel ) .
surprisingly , the peak sample derived from human mpc1 was strongly associated with the yeast 60 s ribosomal protein l28 ( both bands were identified using mass spectrometry , supplementary table 1 ) .
in addition , traces of co - purified , gfp - fused mpc2 were confirmed via silver staining and in - gel fluorescence ( fig. 1a , inset ) .

intrigued by the trace amounts of human mpc2 isolated during the complete purification of mpc1 , as well as the lower - than - expected molecular weight , we generated an alternative plasmid construct .
in this new construct , the poly - histidine tag from mpc1 was transferred to the c - terminus of the mpc2 - gfp fusion ( fig. 1b ) , similar to a previously successful approach employed for other eukaryotic membrane proteins expressed in yeast22 .
upon confirmation of proper mitochondrial localization of the new construct ( fig. 1b , left panel ) , the recombinant proteins were successfully extracted with 1 % c12e8 ( octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether ) and purified in the presence of 0.03 % ddm via co - imac , followed by gfp - 10xhis removal and gf ( fig. 1b , center panel ) .
again , a single monodisperse protein - detergent peak was obtained , which corresponded to a molecular weight of 70 kda ( fig. 1b , right panel ) .
this sample was shown to exclusively contain mpc2 , which was then purified to homogeneity ( fig. 1b , silver - stained gel ; supplementary table 2 ) .
functional reconstitution of mpc in lipid vesicles to evaluate the pyruvate transport activity of recombinant purified mpc in vitro , we reconstituted both purified protein products , individually and in combination , into asolectin liposomes ( supp. figure 2a,b ) .
the choice for asolectin was based on previous literature23 .
two independent approaches were adopted to demonstrate the protein - mediated substrate transport : ( i ) the canonical quantification of the increase in intravesicular 14c - labelled pyruvate2,3,6,15 and ( ii ) the quantification of the decrease in extravesicular pyruvate , as indicated by the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase a ( ldha ) ( supp. figure 3c ) .
a ph gradient - dependent assay ( deltaph = 1.5 ) was derived in accordance with the chemical conditions recently established for mouse mpc14 .
notably , successful pyruvate transport activity was not observed for proteoliposomes reconstituted with mpc1 co - purified with rpl28 and traces of mpc2 ( termed mpc1 * , fig. 2a and supp. figure 3a ). by contrast , compared to protein - free liposomes , which were used as a control , proteoliposomes containing mpc2 alone showed significant pyruvate transport activity ( fig. 2a and supp. figure 3a ) .
similarly , vesicles co - reconstituted with comparable levels of mpc1 * and mpc2 ( supp .
figure 3d ) also induced the transport of pyruvate ; however , the corresponding transport levels were similar to those obtained with mpc2 alone ( fig. 2a and supp. figure 3a ) .

for all experiments , results are reported as mean +/ - standard deviations from triplicates to sextuplicates .
statistical significances were assessed by welch 's unpaired t test , where ns = non - significant , * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.001 .
most importantly , the self - sufficient role of human mpc2 in pyruvate transport was further supported when this protein was overexpressed and purified from a plasmid construct lacking the mpc1 coding sequence ( supp .
figure 1c and supp .
figure 3a ) .
as such , when reconstituted into proteoliposomes , this new construct ( termed mpc2 **) induced pyruvate transport across the bilayer at levels statistically similar to those mentioned above ( supp. figure 3a ) .
in vitro pyruvate transport is dependent on time and electrochemical gradient within a ph gradient of 1.5 units , mpc2 proteoliposomes induced rapid pyruvate transport .
pyruvate intake , which exhibited saturation kinetics , was proficient during the first 5 to 10 min of incubation , presenting half - maximum efficiency between 2 to 4 min ( fig. 2b and supp. figure 3b ) .
the substrate concentration - dependence of uptake was also studied using radiolabeled substrate .
the km value for pyruvate of mpc2 in artificial vesicles is 1.1 +/ - 0.4 mm ( fig. 2c ) .
similarly , the necessity of mpc2 activity on a proton electrochemical gradient was further confirmed ; when the ph gradient was collapsed ( deltaph = 0 ) , a decrease in pyruvate transport activity of about 70 to 80 % was observed ( fig. 2d and supp. figure 3a ) .
the residual transport activity at deltaph = 0 likely reflects the chemical potential of pyruvate moving down its own concentration gradient .
to quantify the decrease in extravesicular pyruvate as a function of ph , proper enzymatic activity calibration was carried out ( supp. figure 2c ) .
in vitro pyruvate transport is sensitive to chemical inhibition , redox modification and substrate type the previous landmark demonstration of the carrier - dependent transport of pyruvate across the imm involved the identification of monocarboxylate mimetic cinnamates as effective and specific mpc inhibitors1 .
in the present study , compared to the vehicle control ( dmso ) , uk - 5099 , a potent cyanocinnamate ( ki =~ 10 nm in mitochondrial extracts24 ) , did not exert any significant inhibitory effect on in vitro mpc2 - dependent pyruvate transport when used at a final concentration of 50 microm , as shown in fig. 2e and supp .
figure 3d .
on the other hand , when compared to the vehicle control , rosiglitazone ( rgz ) , at 50 microm , significantly decreased the mpc2 - dependent internalization of pyruvate , by over 60 % , as shown in fig. 2e and supp .
figure 3a .
the finding that a thiazolidinedione ( tzd ) derivative , such as rosiglitazone , can directly and specifically decrease mpc2 activity has been substantiated by previous studies17,19 ; thus , further confirming the protein - mediated component of in vitro pyruvate transport .
the inhibitory mechanism of cinnamates was originally shown to rely on a reversible michael addition to a cysteine thiol group in mpc ; loss of conjugation was achieved by the addition of reducing agents such as beta - mercaptoethanol15,25 .
here , although the complete elimination of tcep ( tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ) from the early steps of membrane preparation up to proteoliposome reconstitution still permitted the standard purification of mpc2 ( supp .
figure 4a ) , complete functional inactivation was observed ( supp. figure 3e ) .
re - incubating mpc2 with tcep at the stage of proteoliposome reconstitution resulted in the recovery of approximately three quarters of the original activity ( supp. figure 3e ) .
to further explore the importance of redox modification on human mpc2 function , we generated a point mutant by replacing the single cysteine residue at position 54 with serine ( supp. figure 4b ) .
although the overall activity of the isosteric mutant ( termed mpc2.c54s ) was compromised , it was distinctly insensitive to tcep ( supp. figure 3f ) .
together , however , these findings suggest that competent pyruvate transport also relies on a sulfhydryl - sensitive site on mpc2 .
finally , among all of the many monocarboxylates metabolized in the cell , lactate and pyruvate are directly linked and structurally similar .
however , mpc2 appears to be selective for pyruvate over lactate , as no detectable transport of the latter was observed over the range of concentrations tested and under the chemical conditions shown to be successful for pyruvate ( supp. figure 3g ) .
ectopic expression of human mpc2 stimulated growth and induced glucose - dependent respiration in yeast the yeast strain jry472 ( 3delta ) , used in the present study to produce recombinant human mpc , carries a mutation in the leu2 gene and is therefore dependent on external leucine to grow .
in order to study the metabolic dependences on leucine and valine , as a function of mpc2 activity , cells were co - transformed with the plasmid pyes2 ( leu2 ) .
when cultured on synthetic dropout medium lacking both leucine and valine ( - leu - val ) , this mutant strain grew with a doubling time of 123 +/ - 3 min ( fig. 3a , empty green circles ) .
the sole ectopic expression of human mpc2 in this strain , however , decreased the doubling time by 57 % ( down to 53 +/ - 2 min ; fig. 3a , empty blue squares ) .
accordingly , expression of the mpc2 isosteric mutant ( c54s ) , with expected intermediary transport activity compared with wild - type mpc2 , showed a 42 % decrease in the doubling time of the same strain ( 71 +/ - 3 min ; empty red triangles in fig. 3a ) .
further supplementation of with only leucine (+ leu - val ) or only valine ( - leu + val ) , or both amino acids (+ leu + val ) , did not alter the doubling time of cells expressing mpc2 or mpc2.c54s ( fig. 3a ; light colored shapes for individual nutrients and filled shapes for both nutrients at the same time ) .
however , the individual or combined addition of such amino acids significantly improved the doubling rates of 3delta cells ( bearing empty pbevy plasmid ) to about 85 minutes , or about 31 % faster rates .
therefore , the improved growth of 3delta cells expressing human mpc2 ( as well as the isosteric mutant ) reflect the mitochondrial use of glycolytic pyruvate for biosynthetic purposes , particularly for the production of branched chain amino acids .

results are reported as mean +/ - standard deviations from triplicates .
in all cases , statistical significances were assessed by welch 's unpaired t test , where ns = non - significant , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.001 and *** p < 0.001 .
the ability of human mpc2 to stimulate pyruvate - dependent respiration in yeast cells was also evaluated by quantifying oxygen consumption in response to the addition of 0.08 % glucose to basal media .
whereas the mutant strain 3delta responded to glucose addition with a slight , 10 % increase in oxygen consumption over basal respiration ( 1.1 +/ - 0.1 - fold ; filled green circles in fig. 3b ) , the same cells expressing human mpc2 responded to glucose addition with a 70 % increase in oxygen consumption over basal respiration ( 1.7 +/ - 0.1 - fold ; filled blue squares in fig. 3b ) .
again , as expected , the ectopic expression of mpc2.c54s led to a reduced increase in oxygen consumption over basal levels ( 1.4 +/ - 0.1 - fold ) in response to glucose addition ( filled red triangles in fig. 3b ) .
to provide further evidence that all the added glucose was being oxidized via respiration , ethanol addition - which blocks residual fermentation - produced nearly the same response under all three test conditions ( fig. 3b , open shapes ) .
actual respiration rates are depicted in supp .
figure 5 .
due to issues related to yeast cell wall permeability of both rosiglitazone and uk - 5099 , the inhibition sensitivity of mpc2 transport in a native environment was most properly addressed when mitochondria were extracted .
first and most importantly , by comparing the incorporation of 14c - pyruvate into mitochondria isolated from the both 3delta and 3delta + mpc2 yeast cells , we confirm that this subunit can play an autonomous role in promoting the active transport of this substrate ( fig. 3c ) .
in addition , the same mpc2 response profile ( or lack thereof ) to rosiglitazone and uk - 5099 as in the artificial vesicle system is herein established ( fig. 3c ) .
oligomeric nature and secondary structure composition of human mpc2 the lower - than - expected molecular weight of the purified protein - detergent complex that was obtained above ( fig. 1b,c ) , led us to further investigate the oligomeric assembly of the functional mpc2 .
first , by isolating the mitochondrial extracts26 , followed by short - range chemical cross - linking using disuccinimidyl suberate ( dss , 11.4 a linker ) , we observed the formation of mpc2 oligomers in its native lipid environment , starting from dimers up to higher - order molecular species , according to electrophoretic separation ( fig. 4a , left panel ) .
when such experiment was performed with purified protein , only the presence of dimeric species was resolved , probably due to the well - known association between the protein and the detergent ( fig. 4a , middle panel ) 27 .
however , the subsequent reconstitution of purified mpc2 into proteoliposomes displayed the similar high - order , multi - species pattern that was observed in the mitochondrial extracts ( fig. 4a , right panel ) .
this suggests that recombinant mpc2 in artificial lipid bilayer , which was proven functional for pyruvate transport , shares oligomeric similarities to the native mitochondrial membrane environment .

( c ) right panel : a schematic representation indicating the possible mpc2 - gfp - 10xhis orientations in the artificial lipid bilayer of the proteoliposomes , as well as the two possible outcomes upon treatment with prescission protease ( pp ) : ( 1 ) particles with the c - terminal fusion facing the interior of vesicles are protected from digestion by pp and ( 2 ) cleavage of gfp - 10xhis tag when the c - terminal fusion is oriented towards the outside of the lipid membrane .
middle panel : the corresponding samples were quantified in a plate reader for gfp fluorescence , and the relative populations are indicated as percentages .
left panel : qualitative electrophoretic analysis of the proteoliposomes ( pl ) and supernatant ( sn ) samples , before and after treatment with pp. in order to investigate the secondary structure composition of human mpc2 , and to gauge the conformational changes due to binding of substrate and inhibitor , we performed synchrotron radiation circular dichroism ( srcd ) analysis .
srcd indicated that this protein , in the absence of any ligands , is predominantly helical in nature ( fig. 4b , top left panel ) .
the binding of pyruvate leads to improved structural stability , since the helical content is increased from 44 % in the ligand - free control sample up to 56 % when the substrate is present ( fig. 4b , top right panel ) ; this might due to the fact that pyruvate needs to be transported across the channel of mpc2 , by means of opening up or rearranging the structure .
conversely , the absence of tcep lead to an overall increased disorder ( fig. 4b , bottom left panel ) , which is in agreement with the lack of in vitro transport activity under a similar condition ( fig. 3b ) .
notably , the addition of rosiglitazone had minor impact on the secondary structure composition of mpc2 ( 45 % versus 44 % helices , respectively ; fig. 4b , bottom right panel ) , which could probably be associated with weak binding and thereby explaining its limited inhibitory effects on in vitro transport ( fig. 2d ) .
lastly , targeted digestion28,29 of intact mpc2 - gfp - 10xhis proteoliposomes , followed by fluorescence detection of cleaved gfp - 10xhis , revealed that 22 +/ - 3 % of the fused particles were protected from proteolytic processing ( fig. 4c ) .
this indicates that the human mpc2 homotypic complex preferably oriented with the c - terminal end exposed to the outer surface of the artificial bilayer ( 78 +/ - 3 %) ; curiously , the dominant orientation is in consensus with the membrane topology proposed for the yeast homolog at the imm6 .
the current lack of a three - dimensional molecular structure of mpc2 limited our ability to provide a detailed , autonomous mechanism for pyruvate transport .
therefore , experiments are currently in progress to investigate the crystal structure of mpc2 .
discussion human mpc2 as a potential autonomous transporter a rich body of evidence has established mpc1 and mpc2 as mandatory components for the mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate in both intact cells and mitochondrial isolates2,3,5,6,9,10,19 .
co - immunoprecipitation from purified mitochondria , followed by electrophoretic separation , suggested that mpc1 and mpc2 form an oligomeric complex of approximately 150 kda2 .
here , we developed an experimental setup aimed at the co - expression and purification of recombinant human mpc as a heterocomplex .
to this end , we used a bi - directional expression plasmid with inducible promoters that respond to galactose , such that both isoforms could be expressed simultaneously at high and similar levels .
moreover , we used a mutant yeast strain lacking the endogenous mpc1 , mpc2 and mpc3 genes2 to avoid cross - contamination with yeast mpc .
regardless , only the human mpc2 subunit was purified to homogeneity and shown to function in both in vitro and in vivo pyruvate transport .
this finding was further confirmed when mpc2 was expressed without mpc1 and shown to be similarly functional .
mpc1 co - purified with the yeast 60s rpl28 protein and only traces of mpc2 .
in contrast to mpc2 , mpc1 associated with 60s rpl28 was not active .
while these results indeed confirm the existence of a mpc1 : mpc2 interaction , they suggest that yeast may lack some critical and yet unidentified protein component for stable complex formation of human mpc1 : mpc2 , as previously proposed12 .
the existence of novel and direct interacting partners for mpc has been experimentally postulated30,31 ; moreover , a host non - membrane protein contaminant ( 60s rpl28 ) may act as a chaperone for human mpc1 , potentially preventing detectable in vitro transport activity .
overall , our findings do not exclude the possibility that , in cells , mpc1 is a co - transporter working with mpc2 ; however , our data demonstrate that mpc2 can function as an autonomous pyruvate transporter and may work by itself in some specific conditions .
collectively , the functional observations described above are consistent with previous and recent reports from many laboratories , suggesting that mitochondrial pyruvate transport by mpc is a rapid and specific process that depends on co - proton import and redox balance14 - 16 .
our studies on the dependence of time for the transport activity of mpc2 in artificial vesicles ( fig. 2b ) agree with those performed early on in mitochondria extracts containing mpc1 and mpc215 ; half - maximum transport for mpc is achieved around 2 minutes .
however , the km of mpc2 for pyruvate in vesicles is about 7 times higher than previously reported ( 1.1 mm in this study versus 0.15 mm quantified by halestrap , 197515 ) .
this could suggest that the mpc2 homo - oligomer is a relatively less efficient transporter than the proposed mpc1 : mpc2 heterocomplex .
here , the finding that the mpc2 autonomous activity can be inhibited by a tzd derivative , albeit partially , is also substantiated by previous literature17,19. of note , these functional parameters , which were proven essential for the demonstration of the protein - dependent pyruvate transport , are further reinforced by the circular dichroism studies using synchrotron radiation .
a challenging point , however , is that mpc2 alone is insensitive to uk - 5099 .
although mpc1 , but not mpc2 , was recently confirmed to be the true target of cinnamates2,17 , the description of such a uk5099 - insensitive mpc transport in cells remains elusive .
the dynamic stoichiometry of mpc subunits was recently shown to shift between hetero - and homo - oligomers in cells due to variations in both metabolic and tissue - related conditions6,9,32 .
here , the study of the oligomeric composition of recombinant mpc2 by chemical cross - linking in native ( mitochondrial extracts ) and native - like ( asolectin vesicles ) environments , further support the formation of large homotypic assemblies as the functional components , ranging hundreds of kilodaltons , as previously proposed for the heterotypic mpc1 : mpc2 complex2 .
the true size of the mpc2 oligomers , however , are yet to be determined .
given all the potential scenarios described above , a major question arises : which physiological conditions promote mpc2 - mediated pyruvate transport ?
recently , mpc2 was shown to be strictly regulated by acetylation , which can critically determine the active or inactive states of this protein11,33 - 35 ; indeed , acetylation has been directly linked to decreased cellular oxygen consumption rates and deficient pyruvate transport activity33 .
lethality in embryonic mice was caused by either the deletion of mpc27 or the knockout of mpc1 , which in turn also lead to the instability of mpc2 at a post - translational level8 .
we showed that human mpc2 alone can increase oxygen consumption in yeast cells driven by glucose addition and can rescue cell growth when valine is absent , suggesting that , in cells , human mpc2 facilitates mitochondrial pyruvate intake .
this finding was further confirmed using the isosteric mutant .
curiously , mpc2 significantly increased oxygen consumption in the 3delta mutant strain by 60 % ; yet , compared with the control , mpc2 stimulated cell growth rates ( measured as doubling time ) by 16 % in this strain .
these results suggest that mpc2 may play a particular role in the distinct energetic and biosynthetic fates of pyruvate , which should be further investigated , perhaps in association to regulation by post - translational modifications .
our research interest on the metabolic changes undergone by breast cancer led us to survey the mpc2 : mpc1 balance in healthy and disease .
in particular , we analyzed the mpc2 / mpc1 expression ratio in normal and cancer tissues from the breast invasive carcinoma ( brca ) dataset publicly available at the cancer genome atlas project .
we noticed that , while normal tissues have a mpc2 / mpc1 median ratio near 1 , meaning both genes being equally expressed at rna level , in tumor tissues the ratio is significantly higher , demonstrating an increased unbalanced expression of these genes , with mpc2 ever more abundant ( supp. figure 6a , shown in log - 2 scale ) .
according to a metacore analysis ( clarivate analytics ) a positive correlation with increase mpc2 / mpc1 is observed for 56 out of 80 genes belonging to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway ( supp. figure 6b ) .
while several of glycolytic genes also positively correlated with higher mpc2 / mpc1 , there was a consistent negative correlation between mpc2 / mpc1 ratio and the expression of five lactate dehydrogenase and gluconeogenesis genes ( supp. figure 6c ) .
altogether , a shifted mpc2 / mpc1 ratio in breast tumors may have an impact on respiratory metabolism which could lead to increase in the mitochondrial pyruvate oxidative metabolism .
this scenario points to the hypothesis that mpc2 may work autonomously for the intake of pyruvate in some specific physiological conditions .
this scenario points to the hypothesis that higher mpc2 / mpc1 expression ratio in breast tumors may impact on a more respiratory metabolism with a potential increase in the destination of pyruvate to the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and suggest that mpc2 may work autonomously for the intake of pyruvate in some specific scenarios .
further research is necessary to identify the biological circumstances under which mpc2 function by itself and in association with mpc1 .
in conclusion , although the heterotypic mpc component was initially proposed based on co - immunoprecipitation and yeast - based functional complementation assays2 , evidences still lack regarding the direct interaction between mpc1 : mpc2 at the level of the isolated proteins .
in this context , our work provides the first demonstration of the heterologous expression and purification of human mpc1 and mpc2 .
mpc2 , but not mpc1 , was purified to homogeneity and found to be active and sufficient for pyruvate transport in artificial liposomes and in cells .
a transport assay alternative to radiolabeled substrates the compelling demonstration of the active transport mechanism of pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane , as well as the subsequent identification of proteins responsible for such , were done by using 14c - labelled radioactive pyruvate1 - 3,6 .
this experimental approach effectively confirms substrate entrance into mitochondrial extracts1 - 3,6 and allows for a direct quantification of the parameters involved for transport .
in the present work , we introduce a simple , automatable and non - radiometric assay sufficiently sensitive to measure substrate transport into lipid vesicles .
as opposed to a more canonical assay which quantifies the intravesicular content of radiolabeled substrate , we propose an alternative novel assay which relies on the observed decrease in the content of extraliposomal pyruvate , as quantified by an enzymatic reaction ; in this case , ldha .
the validity of the enzymatic assay reported here is confirmed when the functional and kinetic parameters of mitochondrial pyruvate transport - collectively reported over the decades - are reproduced using purified mpc and compared side - by - side with radiolabeled substrate .
in addition to allowing for a direct and reliable quantification of the key parameters involved in transport , it could be multiplexed and streamlined , therefore adapted to a high - throughput screening approach for modulators of mpc2 using small - molecule libraries .
therefore , besides the novel functional insights that our paper brings to the field of pyruvate transport , we expect that the successful application of an alternative enzymatic approach to quantify in vitro transport will be of the major interest to the in vitro biochemistry of membrane carriers in general ; this kind of assay can be a suitable replacement to the prevalent radioactive - based assays , provided that the kinetics parameters of the probing enzyme does not become rate limiting in respect to the kinetics of the carrier .

od600 was adjusted to 0.034 ( approximately 0.23 at 10 mm path - length ) for all conditions using an enspire plate reader ( perkin - elmer ) .
then , 10 microl of each cell culture was added to a 96 - well plate containing 200 microl of sd - ura ( supplemented with 0.2 % glucose + 0.2 % galactose ) in the presence and absence of leucine and valine , or a combination of both .
optical density was measured every 5 min , while cells were left to grow inside the enspire plate reader , with shaking at 200 rpm , at 30 degreesc .
the pyes2 plasmid was a kind gift from dr. celisa caldana ( lnbio ) .
oxygen consumption measurements yeast cells were grown overnight and inoculated on 10 ml of sd - ura medium supplemented with 0.2 % glucose for 22 h at 30 degreesc , 200 rpm .
cells were recovered via centrifugation for 5 min , 3.000 g at 4 degreesc and resuspended in 1 ml of 25 mm hepes - buffered dmem , ph 7.1 ( sigma , d5030 ) .
od600 was adjusted to 0.034 ( approximately 0.23 at 10 - mm path - length ) for all conditions using an enspire plate reader ( perkin - elmer ) , and cells were centrifuged and resuspended again in the same buffer to remove any residual glucose .
measurements were performed using an oxytherm ( hansatech , norfolk , uk ) .
briefly , 970 microl of buffered dmem was pre - warmed to 30 degreesc with shaking at 100 rpm in a reaction chamber .
next , 30 microl of od - standardized cells was added , and the chamber was equilibrated open for 1 min .
the chamber was then closed and incubated for 8 min to measure the basal respiration , followed by another 8 min for glucose ( 0.08 % final concentration to induce mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate and not fermentation to ethanol43 ) , and the final 8 min for ethanol ( 2 % final concentration to inhibit any residual fermentation44,45 ) .
the raw oxygen concentration in the chamber collected every second was used to calculate multiple linear regressions of 150 s in length and average the oxygen consumption rate using the r software package .
circular dichroism synchrotron radiation circular dichroism experiments were performed using a nitrogen - flushed module x end - station spectrophotometer at b23 beamline at the diamond light source , oxfordshire , uk46 , under proposal sm16289 - 2 .
determination of mpc2 - gfp - 10xhis orientation in lipid bilayer membrane triplicate 400 microl aliquotes of proteoliposomes were prepared , with one control sample left untreated .
prescission protease at a ratio of 1:10 ( protease : gfp fused pyruvate carrier ) was added .
all the samples were left gently shaking overnight at 4 degreesc and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 45 min the following day .
the supernatant from the protease un - treated and treated along with the control proteoliposomes were loaded into 96 well plate to measure the gfp emission using enspire ( perkin elmer , massachusetts , usa ) .
results were normalized to the intensity observed in the presence of prescisison protease and the percentage digested was calculated and represented graphically .
further , the similar set of samples were resolved on a 15 % tricine gel and imaged by using a ccd camera after exposure to blue light at 460 nm with a 515 nm filter cutoff , for 0.2 s. tcga data analysis level 3 tcga rna - seq data ( fpkm upper - quartile normalized ) for 1093 tumor tissues from the breast invasive carcinoma ( brca ) dataset , as well as 112 normal breast tissue samples , were downloaded from the genomic data commons ( national cancer institute ) on october 21 , 2017 .
correlations between mpc2 / mpc1 ratios were calculated using pearson coefficient .

this study was designed to explore the precise mechanisms of ras acting on reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in salt - induced hypertension .
male wistar rats were administered with a high - salt diet ( hs , 8.0 % nacl ) for 8 weeks to induced hypertension .
those rats were received pvn infusion of at1r antagonist losartan ( los , 10 mug / h ) or microinjection of small interfering rnas for protein kinase c gamma ( pkcgamma sirna ) once a day for 2 weeks .
high salt intake resulted in higher levels of at1r , pkcgamma , rac1 activity , superoxide and malondialdehyde ( mda ) activity , but lower levels of copper / zinc superoxide dismutase ( cu / zn - sod ) , superoxide dismutase ( sod ) and glutathione ( gsh ) in pvn than control animals .
pvn infusion of los not only attenuated the pvn levels of at1r , pkcgamma , rac1 activity , superoxide and decreased the arterial pressure , but also increased the pvn antioxidant capacity in hypertension .
pvn microinjection of pkcgamma sirna had the same effect on los above responses to hypertension but no effect on pvn level of at1r .
these results , for the first time , identified that the precise signaling pathway of ras regulating ros in pvn is via at1r / pkcgamma / rac1 in salt - induced hypertension .
high salt intake is a significant environmental factor , which strongly associated with blood pressure and the effects of salt loading on the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) in development of salt - induced hypertension12 .
it is reported that high salt intake elevated the concentration of [ na +] in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and led to the activation of brain ras and the increase of angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) production in dahl sensitive rat13 .
as the primary effector peptide of the ras , ang ii binding to the angiotensin ii type - 1 receptor ( at1r ) contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and the development and / or the maintenance of metabolic syndrome4 .
it is well known that paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( pvn ) in the brain is an important central site for integration of sympathetic nerve activity and regulation of cardiovascular function56 .
abundant evidences suggest that the elevated at1r leds to reactive oxygen species ( ros ) accumulation such as superoxide radical , hydroxyl ion , and hydrogen peroxide in the pvn , which contribute to the overactivity of pre - autonomic pvn neurons and result in sympathoexcitation and metabolic disorders in the pathophysiology of hypertension5789 .
furthermore , data from our laboratory suggest that ang ii increased the pvn levels of ros , and bilateral pvn infusion of at1r blocker decreased the production of ros in pvn , as well as sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure101112 .
therefore , the activation of at1r augments the intracellular level of ros and sympathetic nerve activity .
however , the precise signaling pathway of ras modulating the oxidative stress in pvn is still unknown in hypertension .
superoxide generated by nad ( p ) h oxidase has emerged as a key intermediary in the central and peripheral effects of ang ii13 .
nad ( p ) h oxidase is composed of membrane - bound subunits , gp91phox and p22phox , cytoplasmic subunits , p47phox , p40phox , p67phox , and rac1 and / or rac214 .
rac1 ( ras - related c3 botulinum toxin substrate1 ) is a small gtpase which is essential for the assembly and activation of nad ( p ) h oxidase and the production of superoxide15 .
a growing body of evidence indicate that the increased ang ii in brain induces the nad ( p ) h - dependent ros production by the protein kinase c ( pkc ) which is a critical step in rac1 activation and subsequent enzyme assembly1316 .
pkc is a family of phospholipids serine / threonine protein kinases , which have been classified into conventional pkcs ( alpha , beta and gamma ) , novel pkcs ( delta , epsilon , eta and theta ) , and atypical pkcs ( zeta and lambda / iota ) 17 .
pkcgamma , unlike other pkc isozymes , is expressed only in the central nervous system and eye tissues17 .
aronowski and colleagues ( 2000 ) found that pkcgamma is activated in the period of brain ischemia / reperfusion which is closely related to the oxidative stress1819 .
these findings suggest that the linking of at1r and nad ( p ) h oxidase - derived ros is involved in the effects of pkcgamma / rac1 / nad ( p ) h pathway .
furthermore , it is unclear whether at1r / pkcgamma / rac1 / nad ( p ) h pathway in pvn mediates ros production in the development of hypertension .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to determine whether the precise mechanism of ras modulating oxidative stress in pvn is through at1r / pkcgamma / rac1 / nad ( p ) h signaling pathway during the development of high - salt hypertension .

discussion the novel finding of this study is that both at1r and pkcgamma play an important role in modulating the salt - induced central ras activation and oxidative stress responses. and these results , for the first time , identified that the precise signaling pathway of ras regulating ros in pvn may be through at1r / pkcgamma / rac1 pathway , which induces overproduction of ros from rac1 - dependent nad ( p ) h and finally increase sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure .
therefore , pkcgamma signaling pathway contributes to ras modulating oxidative stress in pvn in the development of salt - induced hypertension .
pvn is a central integration site for the regulation of cardiovascular functions2 .
substantial findings have confirmed high salt intake is a significant environmental factor , which strongly associated with ras and ros in the pvn320 .
our study also showed that the activated ras could regulate the reactive oxygen species overproduction in pvn in the progression of hypertension .
as the primary effector peptide of the ras , ang ii binding to at1r contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and the development and / or the maintenance of metabolic syndrome .
there is also increasing evidence showed that the augmented ang ii in brain induces the nad ( p ) h - dependent ros production by pkc .
members of the pkc family play a key role in the regulation of cellular functions in the nervous system21 .
meanwhile , previous work by griendling k and coworkers ( 2009 ) reviewed that ang ii activated by nad ( p ) h oxidase is mainly dependent on the pkc and other signaling pathways in the central nervous system13 .
lin d. and takemoto d. j. ( 2005 ) had showed that pkcgamma could activate the oxidative stress in the cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases22. and pkcgamma is a unique isoform of pkc that is found in neurons and eye tissues .
rac1 ( ras - related c3 botulinum toxin substrate1 ) is a small gtpase which is essential for the assembly and activation of nad ( p ) h oxidase23 .
growing evidence indicate that nox / rac1 activation is a main pathway in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders such as myocardial infarction , hypertension , atherosclerosis and stroke14 .
zimmerman m. c. ( 2004 ) had , for the first time , identified a rac1 - dependent nad ( p ) h oxidase as the source of central ang ii - induced o2 production , and implicated this oxidase in cardiovascular diseases associated with dysregulation of brain ang ii signaling , including hypertension14 .
moreover , increasing evidences demonstrate that increased ang ii in brain induces the nad ( p ) h - dependent ros production by pkc is a critical step in rac1 activation and subsequent enzyme assembly .
in this study , pvn microinjection of pkcgamma sirna could decrease the sympathetic nervous activity and mean arterial pressure , which indicates that pkcgamma plays a significant role in the brain ang ii regulation of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of high salt - induced hypertension. and our results also show that high salt diet not only elevated the pvn level of at1r , pkcgamma , rac1 , and nadph oxidase - dependent superoxide in pvn , but also decreased the antioxidant capacity in pvn , therefore , increased the sympathetic nervous activity and mean arterial pressure .
chronic infusion of at1r antagonist ( los ) into pvn decreased the pvn expression of at1r , pkcgamma , rac1 and the level of superoxide in hypertensive rats , but increased the antioxidant capacity in pvn .
campese vm ( 2000 ) found los could stimulate the production of nitric oxide in pvn , and the nitric oxide could regulate the sympathetic outflow and reduces blood pressure levels24 .
this response is also consistent with our results .
however , pvn microinjection of pkcgamma sirna suppressed nad ( p ) h oxidase - dependent oxidative stress in pvn , decreased the pvn levels of pkcgamma , rac1 and nad ( p ) h oxidase subunits but did not affect at1r .
so we would only speculate that at1r could act on pkcgamma and rac1 - dependent nad ( p ) h oxidase and regulates the nad ( p ) h oxidase - dependent oxidative stress in pvn , which implicated ras regulating ros in pvn may be through the at1r / pkcgamma / rac1 signaling pathway and increase the sympathetic nervous activity and mean arterial pressure in the progression of salt - induced hypertension , which is presented in fig. 11. material and methods animals male wistar rats weighing 150 g to 200 g were purchased from experimental animal center of xi'an jiaotong university .

however , overloads of localization processes have never been studied systematically .
here , we show that the expression levels of green fluorescent proteins ( gfps ) with localization signals were limited to the same degree as a toxic misfolded gfp in budding yeast cells , and that their high - level expression caused cellular defects associated with localization processes .
we further show that limitation of the exportin crm1 determined the expression limit of gfp with a nuclear export signal .
although misfolding of gfp with a vesicle - mediated transport signal triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress , it was not the primary determinant of its expression limit .
the precursor of gfp with a mitochondrial targeting signal caused a cellular defect .
finally , we estimated the residual capacities of localization processes .
high - level expression of a localized protein thus causes cellular defects by overloading the capacities of localization processes .
protein turnover requires cellular resources .
however , because resources are finite , ultimate high - level expression of a gratuitous protein potentially leads to overloading and exhaustion of resources1 .
ultimate high - level expression of a gratuitous protein , in fact , monopolizes cellular resources for protein synthesis and causes cellular growth defects23456 .
in addition to synthesis , protein turnover requires cellular resources for folding , degradation , post - translational modification , and localization .
high - level expression of a protein imposes a high demand on these resources and potentially overloads them ; for example , high - level expression of an aggregative polyq - containing protein causes cellular growth defects by sequestering and limiting the chaperone sis17 ; disomic yeast strains show growth defects because overexpression of proteins from the extra chromosome overloads the degradation machinery , proteasome8 .
high - level expression of yellow fluorescent proteins ( yfps ) with misfolding mutations cause cellular growth defects9 , while a green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) with a degradation signal has a stronger negative effect on cellular growth than normal gfp10 .
these proteins may also overload folding and degradation resources when they are highly expressed .
for localization of proteins to intracellular compartments , specific types of transport machinery are used .
localization of proteins is usually performed based on the information of localization signals11 , and the presence of these signals may be predicted based , in part , on their consensus amino acid sequences .
mitochondrial targeting signals ( mtss ) and signal sequences ( sss ) located at the n termini of proteins are used to target proteins into the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , respectively1213 .
nuclear localization signals ( nlss ) are used to import proteins into the nucleus14 , and nuclear export signals ( ness ) are used to export proteins from the nucleus15 .
the c termini of some proteins contain cytoplasmic membrane - anchoring signals16 , and these localization / targeting signals are recognized by specific transport machinery11171819 .
because transport machinery is also a limited cellular resource , high - level expression of a transported protein potentially leads to overload of the transporting process , prevents the transport of other essential proteins , and causes cellular growth defects .
however , the overload of localization resources and the physiological consequences of this have never been studied experimentally .
the genetic tug of war ( gtow ) is a method for estimating the overexpression limit of a protein in yeasts202122 .
in a gtow experiment , the limit leading to cellular growth defects is measured as the copy - number limit of the gene encoding the target protein ( for details of the gtow experiment , see supplementary method ) .
previously , we measured the expression limits of a model gratuitous protein , gfp , using the gtow in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae10 .
we also observed that addition of a degradation signal to gfp reduced the expression limit , probably due to the overloading of degradation resources10 .
in this study , we attached various localization signals to gfps and measured their expression limits using the gtow method .
on the basis of these measurements , we evaluated the overloading of localization resources that correspond to various cellular compartments and analyzed the cellular defects triggered by these loads .
results localization signals affect expression limits of gfp to evaluate overloading of localization processes , we attached various localization / targeting signals to gfps and measured their expression limits using gtow .
we used codon - optimized enhanced gfp ( yegfp3 ) 23 as a model gratuitous protein .
herein , we designate yegfp3 without any additional sequence or mutation as " gfp " unless otherwise stated .
we expected that the limit of each localization process will be reflected in a decreased expression limit of the gfp modified with a given signal sequence and that the overload of this process will cause a specific growth defect .
we analyzed mitochondrial targeting , vesicular transport , nuclear localization , nuclear export , and cytoplasmic membrane anchoring processes by attaching each corresponding signal sequence to either the n or c terminus of a gfp ( mts - gfp , ss - gfp , nls - gfp , nes - gfp , and gfp - cc ; table 1 ) .
characterization of the mts from s. cerevisiae mrps12 is shown in supplementary figure s1 .
we also analyzed a polyglutamine chain attached to a gfp ( q96 - gfp ) , a misfolding gfp ( gfpm3 ) , and a proteasome - dependent degron attached to a gfp ( gfp - deg ) as reference proteins causing growth defects on high - level expression ( table 1 ) .
gfps and modified gfps were expressed using a very strong tdh3 promoter ( tdh3pro ) , strong pyk1 / cdc19 promoter ( pyk1pro ) , or less strong hxt7 promoter ( hxt7pro ) 24 , and the genes were cloned into the gtow plasmid ptow40836 ( fig. 1a ) 22 .
budding yeast by4741 cells were transformed with these plasmids , and the copy numbers of gtow plasmids containing the target genes were measured to estimate the expression limits of modified gfps .
the growth curves of cells expressing modified gfps from pyk1pro under - leu - ura conditions are shown in fig. 1b - d , while the growth rates of cells harboring the gtow plasmids in - ura and - leu - ura are shown in supplementary figure s2 .
the growth rate of gfp was significantly lower than that of the empty vector ( p < 1.0e - 4 ) , and cells expressing modified gfps showed further growth retardation ( p < 1.0e - 6 ) .
copy numbers of gtow plasmids containing modified gfps expressed from pyk1pro under - leu - ura conditions are shown in fig. 1e .
copy - number limits of modified gfps , with the exception of nls - gfp , were significantly lower than the copy - number limit of gfp ( p < 0.05 ) .
we could not analyze nes expressed from pyk1pro , probably due to its strong negative effect on cellular growth , although we accidentally obtained a nes mutant containing a 3 - amino - acid deletion ( nes *) ( table 1 ) that caused milder growth defects and used it for further pyk1pro experiments .
the copy numbers of gtow plasmids containing modified gfps expressed from hxt7pro in - leu - ura are shown in fig. 1f .
as expected , overall copy numbers were higher than those in pyk1pro experiments because hxt7pro is weaker , but copy - number limits of mts - gfp , ss - gfp , nes - gfp , and gfpm3 were still significantly lower than the copy - number limit of gfp ( p < 0.05 ). of these , the nes - gfp showed the lowest copy - number limit .
these results indicate that high - level expression of gfps with various localization signals , with the exception of nls , affected cellular growth and thus reduced the expression limits of gfps in the same way as the misfolding and aggregative proteins gfpm3 and q96 - gfp .
the expression limits of modified gfps were independent of their fluorescent activities .
we analyzed modified gfps with mutations in the fluorophore ( gfp - y66g ) 25 , and found that the copy - number limits of modified gfp - y66gs were indistinguishable from those of modified gfps ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
high - level expression of modified gfps triggers transcriptional responses associated with modifications and localization signals then , to elucidate the physiological consequences of the high - level expression of modified gfps , we performed a transcriptome analysis using an oligo dna microarray .
we analyzed transcripts of cells harboring ptow40836 plasmids with mts - gfp ( pyk1pro ) , ss - gfp ( pyk1pro ) , gfpm3 ( pyk1pro ) , nes - gfp ( hxt7pro ) , gfp ( tdh3pro ) , and gfp - deg ( tdh3pro ) cultured in - ura conditions because cells showed growth defects under these conditions ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
we also analyzed an empty vector ( ptow40836 ) as a control .
figure 2 shows the result of a hierarchical - clustering analysis of 337 genes whose expressions were changed more than two - fold over the average of all experiments , with gene categories enriched in each cluster .
expression patterns of characteristic clusters are shown in supplementary figure s4 , and genes in each cluster are listed in supplementary table s2 .
in the empty - vector experiment , expression levels of leu2 and ura3 ( cluster 12 ) were higher than those of other experiments , as reflected in the plasmid copy number .
expression of thiamine biosynthesis and zinc - responsive genes ( cluster 3 ) were also higher , but for unknown reasons .
expression of modified gfps , with the exception of nes - gfp , induced transcriptional responses associated with their localization signals and modulation .
expression of proteasome regulators ( cluster 19 ) was induced on high - level expression of gfp - deg .
expression of er stress - related genes ( cluster 20 ) was induced on high - level expression of ss - gfp .
expression of genes involved in protein folding ( cluster 11 ) was induced on high - level expression of gfpm3 , confirming a previous analysis of proteomes9 .
expression of mitochondria - encoded genes ( clusters 6 and 18 ) was reduced on high - level expression of mts - gfp , which also induced the expression of genes ( cluster 1 , 2 , and 5 ) significantly enriched in some functional categories .
nes - gfp showed transcriptional responses similar to those of mts - gfp with respect to clusters 1 and 5 , but we could not identify a specific transcriptional response .
transcriptome responses thus support the hypothesis that high - level expression of modified gfps overloads cellular processes associated with localization signals and modifications .
cargo size and a mutation in the exportin crm1 affect the limits of nes - gfps nes - gfp had the lowest expression limit among the tested localization signals ( fig. 1f ) .
microarray analysis , however , yielded no evidence that high - level expression of nes - gfp causes overloading of nuclear export processes .
we considered two possible causes of cellular growth defects when a nes - containing protein is highly expressed .
one is process overload , in which high - level expression of a nes - containing protein overloads the transport machinery , and the other is direct toxicity , in which a highly expressed nes peptide nonspecifically binds to unknown essential factors and affects their functions .
to distinguish these possibilities , we constructed triple gfps ( 3xgfp ) with nes and nls .
a nuclear pore has an exclusion molecular weight limit , and small proteins such as gfp monomers ( 27 kda ) diffuse freely into and out of the nucleus26 .
thus , we increased the size of cargo proteins using 3xgfp ( 81 kda ) to reduce the speed of free diffusion ( our working models are shown in supplementary figure s5 ) .
expression of 3xgfps was validated using western blot analysis in supplementary figure s6 , and the functionalities of nls and nes used here were evaluated in supplementary figure s7 .
although gfp monomers with nls and nes were localized throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm ( fig. 3a ) , 3xgfp with nls and nes indeed were localized inside and outside the nucleus , respectively ( white arrowheads in fig. 3b ) .
if the transport process is overloaded by the high - level expression of nes - gfp , reducing the diffusion speed using 3xgfp will increase the expression .
on the other hand , if the nes peptide shows direct toxicity , cargo size will not change the expression limit .
figure 3c shows the copy - number limits of gfp and 3xgfp with nls and nes .
the copy - number limits of 3xgfp and nls - 3xgfp were lower than those of gfp and nls - gfp , probably because 3xgfp exerts a higher protein burden effect6 .
in contrast , nes - 3xgfp showed a higher copy - number limit than nes - gfp , and in particular , nes ( without the 3 - amino - acid deletion ) could be expressed from pyk1pro when 3xgfp was used , whereas only nes * ( the mutant nes with the 3 - amino - acid deletion ) could be analyzed in the case of a single gfp ( see above ) .
these results support the hypothesis that high - level expression of nes - gfp overloads the nuclear export process .
the export carrier of the nes used in this study is the exportin crm127 .
thus , it is possible that crm1 is the primary limiting factor in nuclear export overload when nes - gfp is highly expressed .
we accordingly measured the expression limits of nes - gfps in a temperature - sensitive crm1 mutant ( crm1 - 1 ) , and as shown in fig. 3d , the copy - number limits of nes - gfp ( hxt7pro ) , nes * - gfp ( pyk1pro ) , and nes - 3xgfp ( pyk1pro ) in crm1 - 1 mutant cells were significantly reduced compared with those in the wild type cells ( p < 1.0e - 8 ) .
this suggests that high - level expression of a nes - containing protein overloads the crm1 - mediated nuclear export process .
the er stress triggered by gfp misfolding is not the primary determinant of the expression limit of ss - gfp commonly used gfps are poorly folded and are misfolded into disulfide - linked oligomers in the er2829 .
thus , we speculate that the misfolded gfp triggers the er stress response that we observed upon high - level expression of ss - gfp ( fig. 2 ) and that the expression limit of ss - gfp is determined by overload of the er protein quality - control machinery .
we accordingly tested a recently developed moxgfp , which lacks cysteine and does not misfold in the er29 , as well as gfpfast , which folds faster and avoids misfolding in the er28 .
using western blot analysis , we confirmed that ss - gfp constitutes disulfide bond - linked oligomers but that ss - gfpfast and ss - moxgfp do not ( fig. 4a ) .
next , we tested whether the defects in the er stress response affect the expression limits of ss - gfp .
as shown in fig. 4b , cells with a deletion of ire1 , an essential factor in er stress response , showed severe growth defects upon high - level expression of ss - gfp but not in the case of ss - moxgfp .
this result supports the idea that the expression limits of ss - gfp are determined by overload of the er quality control machinery .
however , the copy - number limit of ss - moxgfp was still as low as that of ss - gfp , and the limit of ss - gfpfast was even lower ( fig. 4c ) .
then , we observed the er structure of cells expressing high - level ss - gfp and ss - moxgfp , as shown in fig. 4d .
in the budding yeast , ers are usually observed as two - ring structures ( a nuclear envelope and a cortical er ) 30 .
when ss - gfp is highly expressed , they sometimes showed aberrant , aggregated structures that co - localize with ss - gfp , and changing gfp into moxgfp did not revert these aberrant er structures .
these results suggest that high - level expression of ss - gfp and ss - moxgfp affects normal er functions .
we thus concluded that the er stress triggered by gfp misfolding is not the primary determinant of the ss - gfp expression limit .
mislocalization - triggered cellular defects may determine the low expression limit of mts - gfp the transcriptome analysis above suggests that high - level expression of mts - gfp causes mitochondrial defects ( fig. 2 ) .
figure 5a shows a microscopic observation of mts - gfp .
we observed a few normal mitochondrial structures as seen in the gfp control in cells expressing high - levels of mts - gfp .
mts - gfp was observed throughout the cytoplasm and cell periphery , sometimes as dots ; it has been reported that gfp with mts from neurospora crassa su9 protein ( mts2 , table 1 ) localized to the mitochondria even when highly expressed from the adh1 promoter on a 2 - mum plasmid31 .
thus , we accordingly analyzed the expression limit of mts2 - gfp .
we also analyzed a mts from s. cerevisiae adh3 ( mts3 , table 1 ) because this is one of the highly expressed mitochondrial proteins3233 .
interestingly , mts2 - gfp and mts3 - gfp have much higher copy - number limits than mts - gfp ( fig. 5b ) ; mts2 - gfp and mts3 - gfp localized to the mitochondria even under the same conditions when mts - gfp mislocalized ( pyk1pro , - ura ) .
mtss are usually removed after transport into the mitochondria by matrix proteases17 ; nevertheless , we found that some fraction of mts - gfp , mts2 - gfp , and mts3 - gfp remained as precursors under our experimental conditions ( arrowheads in fig. 5c ) .
consistent with this localization pattern , non - transported mts - gfp precursors were much more abundant than the matured form. from these results , we hypothesize two alternative causes for cellular defects when mts - gfp is highly expressed ; mts - gfp overloads mitochondrial transport machinery with lower amounts than mts2 and mts3 , or the precursor form of mts - gfp causes cellular defects , probably due to the properties of the mts amino acid sequence ( our working hypothesis is shown in supplementary figure s8a ) .
to test these hypotheses , we added a proteasome - dependent degron ( deg , see above ) to mts - gfp to selectively digest the cytoplasmic precursor of mts - gfp ( our working hypothesis is shown in supplementary figure s8b , and reduction of the precursor form in mts - gfp - deg was confirmed by western blot analysis as shown in supplementary figure s9 ) .
interestingly , mts - gfp - deg clearly localized to the mitochondria and did not cause an aberrant mitochondrial morphology ( fig. 5a ) .
in addition , mts - gfp - deg had a higher copy - number limit than mts - gfp , although the attachment of deg to gfp , mts2 - gfp , and mts3 - gfp reduced this limit , probably due to degradation overload ( fig. 5b ) .
this result supports the idea that mislocalized mts - gfp precursors cause cellular defects , including mitochondrial dysfunction , and limit its expression .
in addition , it has been suggested that effective mtss , like mts2 and mts3 , transport gfps without strong cellular defects .
estimation of protein expression limits of gfps with localization signals we next estimated the protein amount sufficient to cause growth defects due to the overload of each localization process by measuring the amounts of gfps with localization signals .
as shown in fig. 6a , we measured the amounts of mts3 - gfp ( pyk1pro , - leu - ura ) , nes - gfp ( hxt7pro , - ura ) , and ss - moxgfp ( pyk1pro , - ura ) as we considered them to be expressed to the upper limits of mitochondrial targeting , nuclear export , and vesicle - mediated transport , respectively .
the amounts were then compared with those of gfp ( pyk1pro , - leu - ura ) and moxgfp ( pyk1pro , - leu - ura ) , which reflect total cytoplasmic protein production capacity .
we found that gfp and moxgfp could be recognized as bold bands among the total proteins separated by sds - page ( red points in fig. 6b ) and accordingly first estimated the gfp levels as percentage protein with respect to total protein by measuring the intensity of gfp bands and then divided them by the total protein intensity after protein fluorescent labeling ( table 2 ; calculation method is shown in supplementary figure s10 ) .
we then measured the protein levels using the in - gel gfp fluorescence of sds - page - separated total cellular protein ( fig. 6c ) .
estimated protein expression limits of mitochondrial transport , nuclear export , and vesicle - mediated transport were 4.1 % , 1.0 % , and 0.7 % of total protein , respectively ( fig. 6d , table 2 ) .
discussion in this study , we aimed to evaluate the overloads of protein localization processes by measuring expression limits of gfps with various localization signals using the gtow method .
attachment of localization signals tested in this study , with the exception of nls , reduced the copy - number limit of gfp ( fig. 1 ) , suggesting that high - level expression of proteins with localization signals cause growth defects , just as is the case for misfolded and aggregative proteins .
transcriptome analysis suggested that high - level expression of localization signal - attached gfps causes defects in their targeted cellular processes ( fig. 2 ) .
among the localization signals tested in this study , nes - gfp had the lowest expression limit ( fig. 1 ) .
the finding that expression limit was further reduced in exportin mutant crm1 - 1 cells suggested that high - level nes - gfp triggers the exhaustion of crm1 ( fig. 3d ) .
in contrast , high - level expression of nls - gfp did not show a low expression limit like that of nes - gfp ( fig. 1 ) .
thus , the nuclear - cytoplasmic transport process may have asymmetric capacity .
we found no evidence that transport factors are exhausted when mts - gfp or ss - gfp are highly expressed ; limiting factors might be identified by the systematic screening of mutants where expression limits are reduced .
" localization processes " described here can be dissected into individual resource - consuming processes , such as recognition and modification of localization signals , transportation , response against stresses caused by localization signals , and removal of mislocalized proteins , and so on .
( supplementary figure s11 ) .
factors involved in these individual processes could be the limiting factors to be identified .
the expression limits of gfps with localization signals are affected by size and folding properties of cargo proteins ( figs 3 and 4 ) and by the properties of the localization signal ( fig. 5 ) .
the reason behind the low expression limit of nes - gfp may be the use of monomeric gfp , which is smaller than the exclusion limit of the nuclear pore and freely diffuses through it ; indeed , increasing cargo size by using 3xgfp increased the expression limit ( fig. 3c ) .
thus , it is possible that amino acid sequences matching the consensus sequences of the nuclear export signal could be avoided in a small protein because they readily overload the nuclear - cytoplasmic transport process .
it is known that the slowly folding proteins , including gfp , which we used first in this study , sometimes misfold in the er2829 .
indeed , we found that high - level expression of ss - gfp induced the er stress response ( fig. 2 ) and led to misfolding ( fig. 4a ) .
however , ss - moxgfp , which avoids misfolding29 , had the same expression limit as ss - gfp ( fig. 4c ) , indicating that gfp misfolding is not the primary determinant of the expression limit of ss - gfp .
the rapidly folding proteins , such as dihydrofolate reductase and gfp , could trigger " clogging " of the transport process in the er34 , which may be another factor limiting the expression of ss - gfps .
mts ( mts from mrps12 , supplementary figure s1 ) , which we used in the initial analysis , showed a relatively low expression limit ( fig. 1 ) .
accumulation of the precursor of mts - gfp in the cytoplasm appeared to account for the low limit , given that removal of the cytoplasmic precursor increased the expression limit ( fig. 5b ) .
other mtss , such as mts2 and mts3 , were effectively transported into mitochondria ( fig. 5a ) , and their expression limits were much higher ( fig. 5b ) .
these observations suggest that high - level expression of mitochondrial proteins with ineffective mtss causes cellular growth defects due to negative effects of the precursors .
cytoplasmic accumulation of precursors of mitochondrial proteins has recently been reported to trigger proteostatic stress3536 .
in this study , we showed that artificial attachment of a proteasome - dependent degradation signal increased the expression limit of mts - gfp ( fig. 5b ) .
intrinsic mitochondrial proteins whose precursors have negative effects in the cytoplasm may be removed by the proteasome .
in this study , we measured the protein expression limits of gfps with localization signals ( fig. 6 ) .
although the limit of gfp was 15 % of total protein , the limits of mts - gfp , nes - gfp , and ss - gfp were restricted to 4 % , 1 % , and 0.7 % , respectively ( table 2 and fig. 6 ) .
we propose that this restriction reflects the capacity of each transport process and potentially causes a growth defect upon overexpression of endogenous proteins with localization signals .
we note that we estimated protein expression limits out of total protein .
estimating the protein expression limit for each intracellular compartment using fractionated organelles might help to precisely understand the capacity .
in eukaryotic cells , over half of proteins localize to an intracellular compartment37 .
because the amount of a target protein expressed in overexpression experiments reaches approximately 1 % of total protein38 , a large proportion of proteins that cause growth defects upon overexpression probably comprise proteins triggering process overloads .
aneuploid cells such as cancer cells in which many proteins are simultaneously overexpressed are expected to suffer from process overloads , and the expression of heterologous proteins is restricted by the capacities of transport processes .
thus , understanding and controlling process overloads is beneficial for disease treatment and cellular engineering .

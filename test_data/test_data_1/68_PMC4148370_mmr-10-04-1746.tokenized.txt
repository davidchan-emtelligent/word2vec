the goal of this study was to identify cancer - associated differentially expressed genes ( degs ) , analyze their biological functions and investigate the mechanism ( s ) of cancer occurrence and development , which may provide a theoretical foundation for bladder cancer ( bca ) therapy .
we downloaded the mrna expression profiling dataset gse13507 from the gene expression omnibus database ; the dataset includes 165 bca and 68 control samples .
t - tests were used to identify degs .
to further study the biological functions of the identified degs , we performed a kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway enrichment analysis .
next , we built a network of potentially interacting pathways to study the synergistic relationships among degs .
a total of 12,105 genes were identified as degs , of which 5,239 were upregulated and 6,866 were downregulated in bca .
the degs encoding activator protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) , nuclear factor of activated t - cells ( nfat ) proteins , nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nf - kappab ) and interleukin ( il ) - 10 were revealed to participate in the significantly enriched immune pathways that were downregulated in bca .
kegg enrichment analysis revealed 7 significantly upregulated and 47 significantly downregulated pathways enriched among the degs .
we found a crosstalk interaction among a total of 44 pathways in the network of bca - affected pathways .
in conclusion , our results show that bca involves dysfunctions in multiple systems .
our study is expected to pave ways for immune and inflammatory research and provide molecular insights for cancer therapy .
bladder cancer differentially expressed genes interacting pathways enrichment analysis immune and inflammation - related pathways introduction bladder cancer ( bca ) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable disease history .
at present , bca is the ninth most common tumor worldwide ( 1 ) , ranking fourth among men and ninth among women ( 2 ) .
in the united states , ~ 10,400 new bca cases emerge and 36,500 bca - related deaths occur every year ( 3 ) .
the diseases of urothelial carcinoma can be classified depending on their depth of invasion as : pta ( papillary ) , pt1 ( lamina propria invasion ) , pt2 ( muscle invasion ) , pt3 ( invasion to peri - vesical fat ) and pt4 ( locally advanced ) .
bca has a multifactorial etiology .
numerous studies have identified risk factors for the development of bca and the affected cellular processes , including low - penetrance gene polymorphisms , smoking ( 4 ) , occupational exposure to aromatic amines and schistosomiasis infection ( 5,6 ) .
in addition , the fact that men are 3 - 4 times more frequently affected than women indicates hormone regulation as an additional factor ( 7,8 ) .
the detection of bca remains difficult due to the lack of specific tumor markers and the emergence of new symptoms .
there is no standard therapy for patients with bca ; treatment options include surgery , chemo - , biological and radiation therapy .
in addition , these methods show currently limited effectiveness , which is further reduced by the high recurrence of bca and the high mortality deriving from increased rates of progression of the disease ( 9 ) .
there is thus an urgent need to develop more specific and efficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches to better understand and treat the onset and course of bca .
earlier studies have suggested that different mechanisms have evolved to respond to specific phenotype alterations in the molecular and cellular pathways involved in bca .
a number of genetic variations in major carcinogenesis - related pathways can induce bca .
for example , in healthy cells , the cell cycle is controlled by tightly linking the p53 and retinoblastoma ( rb ) pathways that influence regulation of apoptosis , signal transduction and gene expression .
during cancer progression and metastasis , the mutated p53 protein exerts profound changes in regulatory networks involved in cell adhesion and angiogenesis , and becomes resistant to degradation in bca of pt2 - pt4 ( 10 ) .
however , the specific mechanisms underlying the progression of bca are still unclear , and therefore , identifying genetic markers of the disease will allow the development of effective treatment and detection methods for early - stage bladder tumors .
in the present study , we identified genes the expression of which is significantly changed between healthy and cancer cells and discuss the biological functions of these genes and the related pathways .
in addition , we built a network of bca - affected pathways in order to explore the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis , occurrence and development of bca .
our results may provide valuable molecular insights for bca treatment .
materials and methods mrna expression profiling data the mrna expression profiling dataset for bca was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database ( accession no .
gse13507 ) at the national center of biotechnology information .
the dataset comprises a total of 256 samples , including 10 healthy bladder mucosae , 58 normal - looking bladder mucosae surrounding cancer , 165 primary bladder cancer and 23 recurrent non - muscle invasive tumor tissues .
gene expression was previously studied in these samples on an illumina human - 6 v2.0 expression beadchip platform ( 11,12 ) .
data processing the raw expression data were downloaded as a series matrix file .
this expression matrix contained 43,148 probes .
among these , a total of 24,995 probes uniquely mapped to 24,340 genes .
for different probes mapping to the same gene , we the mean probe value was calculated for the gene expression value .
an expression matrix ( 24,340 * 234 ) was thus obtained , with each row representing gene expression value , and each column representing the sample. from the 256 samples , we selected 233 , corresponding to 165 primary bca and 68 control samples ( healthy bladder and normal - looking bladder mucosae surrounding the cancer ) .
identification of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) a statistical t - test was used to identify degs between bca and control samples and to calculate the associated p - values .
multiple testing correction on these p - values was performed with the benjamini and hochberg method ( 13 ) , and provided false discovery rates ( fdrs ) .
degs with an fdr < 0.05 were selected for further analyses .
kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway enrichment analysis kegg is a knowledge database for the systematic analysis of gene functions , linking genomic information with high - order functional information .
to identify significantly enriched kegg pathways among the degs , we first downloaded from the database 232 kegg pathways on april 26th , 2011 ( 14 ) .
we next used a hypergeometric distribution model to test the statistical significance of the hypothesis that all pathways are co - disrupted in the same samples .
the resulting p - value was calculated as follows : p = 1 - sum0k - 1ckmcn - kn - mcnn in this formula , n is the total number of gene samples involved in kegg pathways ; n is the number of differentially expressed gene samples ; m is the number of gene samples in one pathway ; and k is the frequency of overlapping genes in all pathways .
fdr < 0.01 was set as the threshold .
identification of potentially interacting pathways in order to explore potential synergistic relationships between bca - affected pathways , we constructed the pathway network in which nodes represent pathways and edges represent nonrandom synergistic relationships ( crosstalk interactions ) .
the network was built using cytoscape ( 15 ) .
the crosstalk among pathways was then investigated by calculating the jaccard index ( ji ) , similarly to a previous study ( 16 ) .
the ji is defined as follows : jaccard ( path a,path b )=# intersection ( path a,path b )# union ( path a,path b ) in this formula , # intersection ( path a , path b ) represents the overlapping number of genes between pathway a and b , and # union ( path a , path b ) represents the sum of genes in pathway a and b. all pathway pairs were grouped together to construct the network .
pathways that showed ji >= 0.01 and shared at least one deg were selected .
results identification of degs based on t - tests and a threshold fdr from multiple testing correction < 0.05 , we identified 12,105 degs , 5,239 upregulated and 6,866 downregulated .
kegg pathway enrichment analysis in order to gain further insights into the biological functions of the identified degs , we used a hypergeometric distribution test to identify the significantly enriched pathways related to bca .
using a threshold fdr < 0.05 , we found that upregulated dges are significantly enriched for 7 pathways ( table i ) , while downregulated dges are significantly enriched for 47 pathways ( table ii ) .
identification of interacting pathways of dges in order to systematically analyze the deg functions , we used a jaccard model to construct and identify the interactions between the bca - affected pathways .
we selected the pathways that showed ji >= 0.01 and shared at least one dge , and thus identified , from 172 pathway pairs , a total of 44 pathways that were considered good candidates for a crosstalk interaction ( fig. 1 ) .
among these , a number of pathways relate to functional disorders and could thus be relevant to bca .
exploring the mechanisms underlying bca through kegg pathways to investigate the mechanism underlying the bca disorder , we focused on the immune - and inflammation - related pathways identified within the network of interacting pathways .
these included chemokine signaling , complement and coagulation cascades , antigen processing and presentation pathways , natural killer cell - mediated cytotoxicity , t - and b - cell receptor signaling pathways , and the intestinal immune network for iga production .
furthermore , in order to assess the role of immune responses in the development of cancer , we focused on the b - and t - cell receptor signaling pathways .
we found that the b - cell receptor signaling pathway is downregulated in bca , involving 36 dges ( fig. 2 ) .
the t - cell receptor signaling pathway is also downregulated , and contains 46 dges ( fig. 3 ) .
discussion bca , which is pathologically diagnosed as transitional or urothelial carcinoma , is the only known solid tumor besides melanoma .
detection and treatment of bca remain a challenge .
therefore , there is an urgent need to explore the mechanisms involved in bca and develop an effective preventive strategy for this disorder .
in the present study , we first identified degs by comparing mrna expression profiling data ( downlooaded from the geo database ) between cancer and control samples and then applied a hypergeometric distribution test to identify the significantly enriched pathways these degs are involved in. furthermore , we constructed a network of the relevant pathways and assessed their potential interactions .
the kegg pathway enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated degs are related to 7 pathways .
among these , the most significantly enriched is the cell - cycle regulation pathway , which is a signal transduction cascade triggered in response to the detection of dna damage ( 17 ) , and which has been demonstrated to relate to the development of bca .
it has been demonstrated that cell - cycle regulatory pathways function as checkpoints that control the order and timing of cell - cycle transitions to ensure the fidelity of critical events , such as dna replication and chromosome segregation ( 18 ) .
cells may be arrested at any phase of the cycle , temporarily halting the cell cycle and allowing dna repair to be completed .
loss and / or perturbation of cell - cycle control checkpoints results in genomic instability and is a hallmark of cancer , as evidenced by the common association of polymorphisms / inactivation of cell - cycle control genes such as p53 , p16 and rb1 , with various types of cancer ( 19,20 ) .
other pathways that were found as significantly enriched among upregulated degs were : those involved in cell proliferation , which is controlled by proteins that maintain the synchrony of cell growth , dna synthesis , mitosis and cell division ( 21,22 ) ; base excision repair , which is related to dna repair mechanisms ; and lysine degradation , which is involved in a wide range of metabolic disorders .
the downregulated degs were found as involved in 47 significantly enriched pathways , mainly including cell transfer - related pathways , such as : cell adhesion molecules and focal adhesion ; cell growth - related pathways , such as wnt , transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) , mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) and calcium signaling pathways ; and cancer - related immune and inflammation pathways , such as the t - / b - cell receptor and the chemokine signaling pathways .
epidemiological studies have estimated that underlying infections and inflammatory responses are linked to 15 - 20 % of cancer - related deaths worldwide ( 23 ) .
the intrinsic immune pathway is activated by genetic events that cause neoplasia .
cancer cells produce inflammatory mediators , thereby generating an inflammatory microenvironment in the tumor .
to explore the potentially synergistic interactions among the bca - affected pathways , we constructed a network based on significantly enriched pathways and ji calculations .
the crosstalk interactions revealed in this network indicated that cancer incidence relates to alterations in multiple processes , including environmental and genetic information processing , metabolism , organismal systems , and certain human diseases .
these processes may synergistically contribute to the regulation and progression of bca .
to further reveal the mechanisms underlying the bca disorder , we focused on immune - and inflammation - related pathways .
our analysis indicated that natural killer cell - mediated cytotoxicity and the b - and t - cell receptor signaling pathways are associated with the formation of bladder tumors and may participate in the development of bca .
numerous studies have demonstrated that structures on the transformed cell ( either expressed as a result of the transformation process itself or induced by the ongoing but limited inflammatory response ) are recognized by infiltrating lymphocytes such as natural killer t - , natural killer or gammadelta t - cells , which are then stimulated to produce interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) ( 24,26 ) .
the ifn - gamma that is initially produced may induce a limited amount of tumor death through antiproliferative ( 27 ) and apoptotic mechanisms .
a previous study demonstrated that the bacillus calmette - guerin ( bcg ) vaccine plays an important role in the maturation of dendritic cells ( dcs ) by signaling through different toll - like receptors , as indicated by upregulation of the dc maturation marker cd83 ( 28 ) and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( il ) - 12 , ifn - gamma and tumor necrosis factor - alpha , suggesting a predominant involvement of the t - helper 1 lymphocyte subpopulation in inflammation .
tumor - specific cd4 and cd8 t - cells home to the tumor along a chemokine gradient where they recognize and destroy tumor cells expressing distinct tumor antigens .
furthermore , natural killer , lymphocyte - activated and bcg - activated killer cells and macrophages can kill bladder tumor cells in vitro ( 29 ) .
activator protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) , involved in cellular proliferation , transformation and death ( 30 ) , is a dimeric complex that contains members of the jun , fos , atf and maf protein families .
ap - 1 proteins are primarily considered to be oncogenic , but recent studies have shown that they can also have a tumor - suppressor activity ( 31 ) .
it was further demonstrated that members of the ap - 1 complex and atf2 synergistically contribute to tumorigenesis ( 32 ) .
nuclear factor of activated t - cells ( nfat ) is a protein family first identified more than two decades ago as a major stimulation - responsive dna - binding factor and transcriptional regulator family in t cells .
it is now established that nfat proteins play important roles in additional types of immune cells and regulate numerous developmental processes in vertebrates .
dysregulation of these processes can lead to malignant growth and cancer ( 33 ) .
the nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nf - kappab ) is activated by a variety of cancer - promoting agents .
the reciprocal activation between nf - kappab and inflammatory cytokines renders nf - kappab an important factor for inflammation - associated cancer development .
both the constitutive and anticancer therapeutic agent - induced nf - kappab activation blocks the anticancer activities of the therapeutic agents .
elucidating the roles of nf - kappab in cancer facilitates the development of approaches for cancer prevention and therapy ( 34 ) .
a recent study showed that il - 20 promotes the migration of bca cells by inducing erk - mediated matrix metalloproteinase - 9 expression , leading to the activation of nf - kappab through the upregulation of p21 ( waf1 ) ( 35 ) .
il - 10 is the most important cytokine with anti - inflammatory properties besides tgf - beta and il - 35 .
it is produced by activated immune cells and regulates the functions of numerous and distinct types of immune cells .
in addition , il - 10 plays an important role in the biology of b and t cells .
the physiological relevance of this cytokine lies in the prevention and limitation of specific and unspecific immune reactions and , consequently , of tissue damage ( 36 ) .
one study revealed the inhibitory role of il - 10 in bcg - induced macrophage cytotoxicity , suggesting that blocking il - 10 may potentially enhance the effect of bcg in the treatment of bca patients ( 37 ) .
overall , the present study presented a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genes and pathways that may be involved in the progression of bca .
our results on immune - and inflammation - related pathways affected by bca may prove helpful in the development of a new strategy to treat bca in combination with medical therapy .
considering the increasing public availability of genomic data , we argue that our approach will constitute an attractive strategy for identifying disease - related pathways and interactions in numerous future studies .
however , further experimental studies are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying bca - associated processes .

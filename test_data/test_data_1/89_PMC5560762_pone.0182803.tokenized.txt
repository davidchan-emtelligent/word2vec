the ages ranged from 3.5 - 11 y. all cases included multiple failed hypospadias procedures , and the subjects received previous operations 2 - 3 times .
all patients underwent one - stage operations .
thirty - three cases were treated with lingual mucosa grafts .
the patient ages ranged from 3.5 to 11 y ( median 7.5 y ) , and they had previous operations 2 - 3 times ( mean 2.8 +/ - 0.7 ) .
grafts ranged from lengths of 2 - 6 cm ( mean 5.1 +/ - 0.46 cm ) and widths of 0.5 - 1.5 cm ( mean 1.2 +/ - 0.16 cm ) .
our follow - up was 5 to 12 m ( mean 8.3 +/ - 1.2 m ) .
twenty - nine cases were treated with buccal mucosa grafts .
the patient ages ranged from 4 to 9.2 y ( median 7.0 y ) , and they had previous operations 2 - 3 times ( mean 2.5 +/ - 0.2 ) .

background the incidence of hypospadias is approximately 1 / 300 , which has rapidly grown in recent years .
because surgeries are the only way to solve hypospadias , many studies of surgeries for the condition have been reported in the literature .
we found different types of surgeries with different outcomes [ 1 - 3 ] .
it is very challenging to complete penis reconstruction in patients who have had multiple procedures that failed .
failed hypospadias repair is often associated with penile skin loss and deficient local tissues , so other tissues are needed to complete the procedure .
based on the literature from pubmed , a wide variety of grafts have been used for urethral reconstruction after failed hypospadias procedures [ 4 ] .
since humby first reported using the buccal mucosa graft in 1941 , the bmg has been widely accepted and has achieved satisfactory outcomes for patients who have had multiple failed hypospadias procedures [ 5 , 6 ] .
however , donor - site - related complications have been reported , such as the as numbness and tightness of the mouth , among other complications [ 7 ] .
additionally , patients who experienced failed hypospadias procedures often had long urethral defects and buccal mucosa grafts were not possible due to lack of available tissue .
if buccal mucosa grafts are confronted with scarred tissues , bmg urethroplasty cannot be chosen again .
simonato et al were the first to report using tongue mucosa as an alternative donor site for urethroplasty in 2006 , and their group had achieved good outcomes .
much literature has shown us that these techniques were effective .
yet , few reports have sought to compare outcomes of the bmg and lmg used in inlay graft urethroplasty in pre - pubertal chinese boys .
the aim of our study was to compare the two graft types and confirm the reliability of lmg in pre - pubertal boys from a chinese population .
materials and methods materials we recruited sixty - two pre - pubertal boys who received buccal or lingual mucosa graft urethroplasty in our hospital between 2012 and 2015 ( s1 file ) .
the patients' ages ranged from 3.5 - 11 y. the measurements of the urethral meatuses of the lmg and bmg groups ( table 1 ) were identified in surgery .
the inclusion criteria were : 1 ) two or more failed previous hypospadias repairs , and 2 ) penile skin that was no longer suitable for an onlay flap procedure .
the exclusion criteria were : 1 ) ventral curvature > 60 degrees identified by artificial erection in surgery , 2 ) physiological deficiency in the oral or lingual grafts , and 3 ) incomplete follow - up results or examinations .
all patients underwent single - stage operations .
thirty - three cases were treated with lingual mucosa grafts , and twenty - nine cases were treated with buccal mucosa grafts .
all surgeries were performed by 2 senior pediatric urologists ( ye weijing and liu yidong ) .
written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the patients and control subjects before the study began .
ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of renji hospital , which was affiliated with the shanghai jiao tong university school of medicine 10.1371 / journal.pone.0182803.t001 table 1 the measurements of the urethral meatuses of the lmg and bmg groups identified in surgery .

because all of the 62 patients could have received either surgery , we assigned the two procedures at different periods .
all patients were operated on general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation .
we documented the appearance of the failed hypospadias procedures ( fig 1 ) .
for the procedure , we attempted to maintain the original urethra and complete the penile skin degloving .
then , we removed the scar tissue and fistula ( fig 2 ) .
we opened the stricture of the urethra to a normal diameter .
a deep midline relaxing incision was made in the urethral plate to the tunica albuginea if we were unable to tubularize because of strictures .
if a ventral curvature existed due to a scarred urethral plate , we removed the inelastic ventral tissue .
artificial erection was used to confirm there was no chordee .

harvesting method for the lingual mucosa grafts : we measured the urethral defect ( fig 3 ) , keeping in mind 15 - 20 % shrinkage of the graft size .
a 4 - 0 prolene stitch was passed through the apex of the tongue or grasped by a tongue forceps for traction outside of the mouth to expose the ventro - lateral surface of the tongue , which made it feasible for us to obtain the lingual mucosa ( fig 4 ) .
the graft was marked with a surgical pen on the ventrolateral surface of the tongue ( fig 5 ) .
the graft borders were incised using a scalpel along the marked line and then the graft was removed using sharp scissors ( fig 6 ) .

the graft was defatted ( fig 9 ) .
the donor site was examined for bleeding and closed with interrupted 5 - 0 polyglactin sutures .
the graft was sutured into the incised urethral plate with 7 - 0 polyglactin .
more quilting sutures and small incisions in the graft were made to avoid operative hematomas ( fig 10 ) .
the urethral plate was tubularized with 7 - 0 polydioxanone sutures in a continuous fashion over a 6 - 10 fr catheter ( which was selected based on the patient 's age or urethra size ) .
the neourethra was covered by a subcutaneous dartos patch or some other tissues like tunica vaginalis if necessary ( fig 11 ) .
the glans and the penile skin were closed over the urethra at the end ( fig 12 ) .
a pressure bandage was needed after surgery ( fig 13 ) .

post - operative follow - up the urethral catheter was removed after 3 weeks .
for data analysis , our hospital used ibm spss version 18.0 for statistical analysis .
the comparison of urethral meatus measurements and the outcomes was performed with a chi - square test , and p < 0.05 indicated that the differences were statistically significant .
we assessed the outcome of the cosmetic results with the hose score table ( designed by a.j.a. holland in 2001 [ 8 ]) .
the scores and the follow - up periods of the groups were analyzed with spss 18.0 , and the comparison of rates and pre - operative conditions were performed using a t - test with p < 0.05 indicating statistically significant differences .
a successful outcome was defined based on the presence or absence of complications , including a fistula ( which required an additional intervention ) , diverticula ( which could affect the urine stream and require surgery ) , meatal stenosis / stricture ( with stricture apparent on a urethrogram and requiring subsequent intervention ) , persistent ventral curvature , glans dehiscence and / or skin reoperation with some bleeding , and a loss of stent [ 9 ] .
results for the outcomes of the two groups , there was no significant difference between groups in terms of age , previous repairs , and the length and width of the grafts ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .
for the lingual mucosal graft group , fistula : 2 / 33 ( 6.0 %) , stricture : 1 / 33 ( 3.0 %) , ventral curvature : 2 / 33 ( 6.0 %) , complications : 5 / 33 ( 15.0 %) , success rate : 28 / 33 ( 84.8 %) , hose score : 14.34 +/ - 0.95 , peak flow : 6.5 ml / s - 12.0 ml / s , and mean peak flow : 9.3 +/ - 0.4 ml / s. for the buccal mucosa graft group : fistula : 2 / 29 ( 6.8 %) , stricture : 2 / 29 ( 6.8 %) , ventral curvature : 1 / 29 ( 3.4 %) , complication rate : 5 / 29 ( 17.0 %) , success rate : 24 / 29 ( 83.0 %) , hose score : 14.28 +/ - 1.03 , peak flow : 6.5 ml / s - 12.0 ml / s , and mean peak flow : 9.2 +/ - 0.2 ml / s. there were no differences between the two groups for overall success , complication rates , the peak flow , and the hose scores ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 3 ) .

three patients were diagnosed with urethra strictures ( one located at the junction of the urethral mucosa grafts , two at the urethral opening ) based on the urethrography .
all returned to normal after receiving dilation ( once a week , 2 - 4weeks ) .
four patients with fistulas had received fistulous neoplasty .
three cases with ventral curvature ( artificial erection > 30 degree ) were conducted with dorsal tunica albuginea plication based on the methods of baskin ( 1994 ) [ 10 ] .
no other complications arose .
discussion urethroplasty is the key procedure for treating hypospadias and different types of procedures have appeared over the years .
many patients have to face multiple surgeries due to failed procedures , and these patients typically develop problematic conditions , such as stricture , fistula , and ventral curvature [ 11 , 12 ] .
it is very challenging to perform the reconstructions for complex conditions .
many studies have been reported trying alternative materials for reconstructing the urethra .
the most common material should be the prepuce flap [ 13 ] [ 14 ] .
li zc et al [ 15 ] used bladder mucosa grafts as a new alternative approach , and they have achieved success .
xu ym , et al [ 16 ] reported urethral reconstruction using colonic mucosa grafts for complex strictures , and they also have good results .
however , these methods are rarely acceptable for treating patients with multiple failed hypospadias repairs .
these cases are often associated with penile skin loss and deficient local tissues , which resulted from the damage to the prepuce flaps used for repair ( s ) , and the colonic and bladder procedures are too complex .
since humby et al first tried to apply buccal mucosa grafts to reconstruct the urethra in 1941 , the buccal mucosa graft has emerged as a reliable and popular donor tissue for urethral substitution over the past few years .
the advantages of bmg are easy harvesting , a thick epithelium , a thin lamina propria , a good blood supply with no hair and high survival [ 17 ] .
these characteristics make bmg a popular substitution for urethral reconstruction .
however , this method is not suitable to patients with longer urethral defects , physiological deficiency of oral grafts or oral mucosa damage due to previous harvestings .
additionally , many scholars have reported that the buccal mucosa graft donor site has some complications , such as persistent perioral numbness , salivary changes , and difficulty in opening the mouth [ 7 ] .
this dilemma has encouraged surgeons to find other approaches .
simonato et al [ 18 ] first reported the use of lingual mucosa as a substitute tissue for graft urethroplasty in 2006 , and since then , many lmg reports have emerged with good results .
maarouf et al [ 19 ] reported 21 cases with the use of lmg ( mean age 12.3 y , range 8.7 - 19.8y ) , and the mean duration of follow - up was 20.8 months with a success rate of 78.2 % .
they concluded that compared to bmg , lmg was more feasible to harvest and had fewer complications at the donor site .
abdelhameed et al [ 20 ] studied 21 patients receiving the lmg urethroplasty who had a mean age of 36.3y and had urethral strictures after multiple operations .
they achieved a success rate of 87 % and confirmed the effectiveness of this method for urethral reconstruction of strictures .
we could barely find any studies about the comparison between the two grafts used in inlay urethroplasty , especially in the pre - puberty boys from a chinese population .
to evaluate the outcomes , we conducted a retrospective study of sixty - two children who received either buccal ( twenty - nine ) or lingual ( thirty - three ) mucosa graft urethroplasty in our hospital between 2012 and 2015 .
the ages ranged from 3.5 - 11y .
for the outcomes of the two groups , there was no significant difference between groups in terms of age , preoperative surgery time , and the length and width of the grafts ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .
for the lingual mucosal graft group , fistula : 2 / 33 ( 6.0 %) , stricture : 1 / 33 ( 3.0 %) , ventral curvature : 2 / 33 ( 6.0 %) , complications : 5 / 33 ( 15.0 %) , success rate : 28 / 33 ( 84.8 %) , hose score : 14.34 +/ - 0.95 , peak flow : 6.5 ml / s - 12.0 ml / s , and mean peak flow : 9.3 +/ - 0.4 ml / s. for the buccal mucosa graft group : fistula : 2 / 29 ( 6.8 %) , stricture : 2 / 29 ( 6.8 %) , ventral curvature : 1 / 29 ( 3.4 %) , complication rate : 5 / 29 ( 17.0 %) , success rate : 24 / 29 ( 83.0 %) , hose score : 14.28 +/ - 1.03 , peak flow : 6.5 ml / s - 12.0 ml / s , and mean peak flow : 9.2 +/ - 0.2 ml / s. there were no differences between the two groups for overall success , complication rates , the peak flow , and the hose scores ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 3 ) .
our results showed that we have achieved satisfactory outcomes for the two groups .
the overall successful rates of the bmg and lmg were 83.0 % and 85.0 % , respectively , which were similar to the 87 % success rate reported by abdelhameed et al [ 20 ] in adults in 2015 .
holland [ 8 ] had reported that a total score of 14 would infer an acceptable outcome in modern hypospadias repair with the provision that the meatus is at least as long as the proximal meatus with a single urinary stream and only moderate angulation of the penile shaft .
so , we achieved an acceptable or satisfactory cosmetic outcome based on the scores above .
there were no significant differences between the two groups for overall successful rate and the hose scores in our study .
we know from the literature that the lingual mucosa shares many characteristics with the urethra , such as the same embryologic origin as the urethra as well as the immunologic advantage of resistance to infection and tissue characteristics ( e.g. , thick epithelium , high elastic fiber content and rich vascularization ) , which are more obvious prior to puberty [ 18 , 21 ] .
these shared characteristics show that the lingual mucosa is a perfect material compared to alternative materials .
when multiple hypospadias procedures fail , 1 ) the failed hypospadias repairs are often associated with penile skin loss and deficient local tissues , 2 ) bmg are often not possible due to oral complications from a prior procedure , 3 ) patients undergoing failed hypospadias often have long urethral defects , and 4 ) the buccal mucosa grafts are not available due to frequent tissue harvesting .
if buccal mucosa grafts are confronted with scarred tissues , bmg urethroplasty cannot be chosen again .
so if surgeons are confronted with these problems in pre - pubertal boys , there is still a reliable graft to fix the poor repair .
it should be noted that compared to the lmg used in adults , the advantages of lmg used in children before puberty are that the tissue material is soft and thick in mucosal tissues with a better blood supply , high cell activity and survival rate .
however , there are also disadvantages in that the tongues of children have a smaller volume and are harder to secure during the procedure than tongues in adults .
the length of the lingual graft in children is long enough for the defect in general , and if the urethral defect is longer , we could choose the two sides of the ventro - lateral surface of the tongue .
the thickness and the articulation are related to the complications based on the outcome and the long time follow up in children .
we have the relatively shorter follow up time with a good outcome , and maybe it 's a shortage of our research .
the limitations of our study include 1 ) a short follow - up period .
a short follow - up period may have had an effect on the complication rates [ 22 ] .
we had a shorter follow - up period than some reports , which would lead to a higher success rate compared to studies in the literature .
we will keep on focusing on these patients to obtain long - term follow up results on the functional and cosmetic outcomes .
2 ) due to the shortage of our work , it 's a pity that the post - operative complications of donor sites were not included .
we will attempt to collect more details on the donor site complications in our next study .
3 ) we had only 62 cases in our study based on the inclusion criteria , and a larger number of pre - pubertal boys will need to be recruited to confirm the results of this study .
conclusion the lingual mucosal graft and the buccal mucosa graft both achieved good outcomes , and the lingual mucosa graft made up for the shortcomings of the buccal mucosa graft and provided a reliable way to treat multiple failed hypospadias procedures in pre - pubertal boys .

backgroud the detectable rate of minimal gastric gists has continuously increased .
while the surveillance and management of gist < 2 cm have been deemed controversial or lack evidence - based approaches .
the aim of the current study is to propose a cut - off value of tumor size for treatment policy and the appropriate timing for endoscopic ultrasonography ( eus ) follow - up in the minimal eus - suspected gastric gist patients .
methods a single - institution retrospective study was performed .
69 patients with eus - suspected gastric gists were studied from november 2008 to march 2015 .
69 patients with minimal gastric gists <= 2 cm diagnosed by eus were followed for a mean period of 29 months ( range , 12 to 70 ) .
an at least 20 % increase of the maximal diameter of the tumors was set as a significant change .
results during follow - up , of the 69 minimal eus - suspected gists , 16 ( 23.2 %) showed significant changes in size .
11 out of 69 gists ( 15.9 %) , 6 out of 43 gists ( 14.0 %) , 7 out of 30 gists ( 23.3 %) showed significant changes in size , at 1 year , 2 years , and more than 3 years respectively .
the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the tumor size cut - off was 9.5 mm. only 4.7 and 3.7 % of gastric eus - suspected gists of < 9.5 mm in size showed significant changes at 1 year and 2 years , while 9.5 % at more than 3 years .
34.6 , 31.3 and 55.6 % of gastric eus - suspected gists of >= 9.5 mm in size showed significant changes at 1 year , 2 years and more than 3 years .
conclusions minimal eus - suspected gists , larger than 9.5 mm may be associated with significant progression .
the patients with a >= 9.5 mm gist should have a eus 6 - 12months , while < 9.5 mm gist may have a eus extended to every 2 - 3 years .

keywords endoscopic ultrasound ( eus ) stomach gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education20130001120064 gao zhidong capital health development research project of chinatg - 2015 - 002 ye yingjiang issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gists ) are the most common primary mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract and span a clinical spectrum from benign to malignant .
gists occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract , but they are most common in the stomach ( 50 - 60 %) [ 1 ] .
owing to the popularization of eus , the detectable rate of gastric gists has continuously increased , specifically for minimal gastric gists ( diameter less than 2 cm ) .
surgery is the treatment for primary , local gastric gists larger than 2 cm , while conservative follow - up is suggested for lesions less than 2 cm. in fact , the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) and the european society of medical oncology ( esmo ) guidelines for the surveillance and management of gist < 2 cm have been deemed controversial or lack evidence - based approaches .
endoscopic ultrasonography ( eus ) has been utilized to diagnose gastric gists with high accuracy , sensibility , and specificity ( 87 , 95 , 72 % , respectively ) [ 2 , 3 ] .
the typical eus finding of a gastric gist is a hypoechoic lesion arising from the fourth layer of the gastric wall .
the goal of this study was to evaluate the malignant potential of minimal gastric gists to determine the best cut - off value for tumor size and appropriate timing for eus follow - up , in order to provide clinical evidence for malignant potential in the management of minimal gastric gists .
methods study design and population this retrospective study was approved by our institutional ethics committee and meets the guidelines of our responsible governmental agency .
it reviewed data from patients with minimal gastric gists diagnosed by using eus at peking university people 's hospital between november 2008 and march 2015 .
tumor size was determined with the maximum diameter obtained by using eus .
the criterion of minimal gastric gists diagnosed by using eus is a hypoechoic lesion arising from the fourth layer of the gastric wall .
every patient had signed a consent form before eus inspection .
all eus image files were reviewed by a single experienced eus endoscopist ( jw ) .
inclusion criteria for this study were : ( 1 ) tumor size <= 2 cm ; ( 2 ) patients were followed by using eus at least twice over a period of 12 months ; ( 3 ) eus follow - up period of more than 1 year .
the exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) cancer patients ; ( 2 ) diagnosis changed during follow - up. a flow diagram of the enrolled patients is shown in fig. 1. fig. 1 flow diagram of enrollment patients definitions and study procedure all enrolled patients were divided into two subgroups based on the criteria : patients with at least a 20 % increase in the initial maximal diameter of the tumors during follow - up were included in the progressive disease group ; the other patients were assigned to the stable disease group .
we compared patient demographics , initial tumor size , tumor location , ultrasonographic features , and growth rate between the two groups at 1 year , 2 years and more than 3 years respectively .
in the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analysis , the progressive disease cases were defined as the true positives , and the stable disease cases were defined as the true negatives when determining the cut - off value of the optimal initial size for medical intervention .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with spss statistical software ( version 20.0 for windows ; spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
numerical variables were expressed as the mean +/ - sd unless otherwise stated .
discrete variables were analyzed using the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test .
the optimal cut - off values for tumor size as a prognostic variable were chosen from a roc curve with the criterion variable " tumor size " and " progressive disease " as condition variables .
we considered p values < 0.05 to be statistically significant for a two - sided test .
results patient characteristics a total of 74 patients were diagnosed with minimal gastric gists by using eus meeting the included criteria ; 5 patients were excluded for diagnoses changed during the follow - up. finally , 69 patients met the criteria for enrolment ( see table 1 ) .
the average age was 59 ( range , 27 - 84 ) years .
there were 17 ( 21.8 %) men and 52 ( 66.7 %) women .
tumors were located at the cardia in 7 patients ( 9.0 %) , at the fundus in 43 ( 55.1 %) patients , at the body in 18 ( 23.1 %) patients , and at the pylori in 1 ( 1.3 %) patient .
the mean initial tumor size was 8.8 ( range , 3 - 20 ) mm. only 4 cases' ( 5.8 %) initial eus features have the high risk feature , such as heterogeneous echo texture , irregular extraluminal border , echogenic foci , and anechoic space .
5 cases ( 7.2 %) were identified by successfully performing pathological examination of eus - fna .
the mean eus follow - up period was 28 months ( range 12 - 70 months ). of the 69 eus - suspected gists , 16 ( 23.2 %) showed significant changes in size ( see table 2 ) .
the tumors were mainly located in the gastric body ( 9 cases , 56.3 %) and fundus ( 7 cases , 43.7 %) .
among the cases , 11 patients underwent resection , and all their tumors proved to be gists .
while the other 5 patients refused surgery and were followed up. out of 11 patients , 4 patients had lesions with higher malignant potential , reflected by mitotic rates of more than 5 per 50 high - power fields ( hpfs ) .
molecular analysis revealed kit exon 11 mutation in 10 cases , and wild type in 1 cases .
moreover , of the 69 eus - suspected gists , significant change in echo patterns was observed in 8 patients ( 11.6 %) .
6 cases ( 75 %) showed significant changes in size .

when all the patients were followed up to 1 years , according to the criteria , there were 58 ( 84.1 %) patients in the stable disease group and 9 ( 15.9 %) patients in the progressive disease group ( see table 3 ) .
both groups were similar in gender , tumor location , and initial eus features .
the mean age ( 67.9 vs. 57.6 , p = 0.012 ) , initial diameter ( 12.6 mm vs. 8.1 mm , p = 0.000 ) , and follow - up eus high risk features ( 45.5 % vs. 8.6 % , p = 0.001 ) significantly predicted progressive disease compared with the stable disease group .
the mean value for the average tumor growth rate per annum in the progressive disease group was 50.7 % , which was significantly higher than the - 1.2 % rate in the stable disease group ( p = 0.000 ) .
the data for the two groups are presented in table 1 .
when the patients were followed up to 2 years and more than 3 years ( see tables 4 and 5 ) , we could find similar results that the age , initial diameter and follow - up eus high risk features were significantly predicted progressive disease .

for 1 year follow - up , the area under the curve ( auc ) was 0.818 , indicating that the best cut - off value of tumor size was 9.5 mm. the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and consistency rates were 81.8 , 70.7 , 34.6 , 95.3 , 72.5 % , respectively ( see fig. 2a ) .
for 2 years and more than 3 years follow - up , the best cut - off value of tumor size was also 9.5 mm. the auc , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and consistency rates were 0.858 , 83.3 , 70.3 , 31.3 , 96.3 , 69.8 and 0.786 , 82.6 , 73.3 , 55.6 , 90.5 , 80.0 % , respectively. ( see fig. 2b , c ). fig. 2 receiver operating characteristic curve .
all the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the tumor size cut - off was 9.5 mm , at 1 year ( a ) , 2 years ( b ) , and more than 3 years ( c ) surveillance timing eleven out of 69 gists ( 15.9 %) , 6 out of 43 gists ( 14.0 %) , 7 out of 30 gists ( 23.3 %) showed significant changes in size , at 1 year , 2 years , and more than 3 years respectively. with the 9.5 mm cut - off , there was a significant difference between the two subgroups .
only 4.7 % ( 2 / 43 ) and 3.7 % ( 1 / 27 ) of gastric eus - suspected gists of < 9.5 mm in size showed significant changes at 1 year and 2 years , while 9.5 % ( 2 / 21 ) at more than 3 years .
34.6 % ( 9 / 26 ) , 31.3 % ( 5 / 16 ) and 55.6 % ( 5 / 9 ) of gastric eus - suspected gists of >= 9.5 mm in size showed significant changes at 1 year , 2 years and more than 3 years .
discussion for a long time , the actual incidence of gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) was underestimated. with the improvements in understanding of this disease and examination methods , the detection rate was increasing .
most recent studies have suggested the incidence of gastric gists to be between 10 and 20 cases per million , which is 2 - 3 times more than the data of 20 years ago [ 4 ]. this trend was also showed in minimal gist especially for gastric gist .
based on the data 20 years ago from armed forces institute of pathology ( afip ) of us , it has been reported that of the 1687 tumors with size measurements , 127 ( 7.5 %) were 2 cm or smaller [ 5 ] .
while the data 10 years later from the register study of italy showed the rate was up to 18.3 %( 170 / 929 ) [ 6 ] .
moreover , a study from germany showed among the consecutive 98 autopsy cases , miro - gist ( less than 1 cm ) were found in 22 patients ( 22.5 %) [ 7 ] .
a latest population - based study [ 8 ] for milli - gist (< 2 cm ) in the national cancer institute 's seer database showed that the annual incidence rate of gastric milli - gists was 2.6 per 10 million .
because the natural course of minimal gastric gist remains largely unknown , the current management policy for gastric gists < 2 cm is usually conservative , unless tumors grow more than 2 cm or symptoms occur such as bleeding , acute abdomen , etc .
[ 9 ] .
despite the patients with minimal gastric gist are recommend for close surveillance , there are some difficulties in clinical works .
firstly , some patients would feel anxiety , depression and stress for survival with tumor .
secondly , some patients could not be followed up regularly for their poor compliance .
these cause some patients to choose the two extremes : excision by overtreatment or few surveillance with delayed treatment .
therefore , identification of malignant potential for minimal gastric gist is very important .
although most milli - gists are presumed to have less malignant potential especially which with low mitotic rate .
if with high mitotic rate , the metastases rate or tumor - related mortality would be significantly worse .
eus - guided fine needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) has been suggested for the determination of malignant potential in gastric gists with high accuracy ( 91.7 - 97 %) [ 10 , 11 ] .
while in these study , the gists evaluated were larger ones > 2 cm mostly ( 80 - 91 %) .
it would have been difficult to use eus - fna for minimal gastric gists .
due to the small size , success ratio of puncture maybe low .
moreover there would be insufficient tissues obtained by biopsy to assess mitotic or genetic mutation .
mekky et al. reported adequate samples were obtained in 67.6 % of gastric submucosal tumors with size < 20 mm [ 12 ] .
even the adequate specimens were considered , the reported diagnostic yields for tumors less than 20 mm was 71 % [ 11 ] .
thus , the diagnosis of miminal gists may be mostly diagnosed based on eus appearance .
ultrasonographic features are another important predictive factor of malignancy .
high - risk eus features include irregular border , cystic spaces , ulceration , echogenic foci , and heterogeneity [ 13 ] .
however , ultrasonographic features might not have been in smaller lesions as sensitive as for larger ones .
in our study , there was no difference between stable disease group and progressive disease group regarding initial malignant ultrasonographic features .
while we found 8 cases showed ultrasonographic feature changes .
they all occurred after the diameter increased more than 1 cm. among them 6 ( 75.0 %) showed significant changes in size. with knowledge of gist biological behaviours , we gradually realized that the malignancy potential of some minimal gastric gists was high , and these need to have medical intervention .
even some experts suggested surgical resection of all minimal gastric gists once diagnosed [ 14 ] .
the growth of the tumor is an important index of malignant potential .
there are some studies proposing a cut - off value of initial tumor size , in order to predicting gists with significant - sized change .
a retrospective analysis by lachter et al .
[ 15 ] reported that out of 70 gists monitored by eus , enlargement in size was detected significantly more in gists over 17 mm diameter ( p < 0.018 ) at averaged follow - up examination 23.2 mm. in another retrospective study by gill et al .
[ 16 ] , the majority ( 86.3 %) of < 3 cm upper gastrointestinal subepithelial tumors ( sets ) did not increase in size and / or change in echogenic features during a median of 23 months .
in another study by kim et al .
[ 17 ] , in 989 gastric subepithelial tumors , sets of 10 to 30 mm in size grew significantly more rapidly than sets < 10 mm over a median period of 24 months when followed up endoscopically or by eus .
fang et al .
[ 18 ] followed 50 patients with eus - suspected gastric gists of sizes less than 3 cm over a period of more than 24 months ( range 24 - 101 months ) , found that the best cutoff size associated with tumor progression was 1.4 cm having an 85.7 % sensitivity , 86.1 % specificity , and 86.0 % accuracy .
while all these studies included the gists or sets > 2 cm. these tumors should be resected without controversy .
the current surveillance and management policy for gastric minimal gists is still controversial .
so our study was specific for gists <= 2 cm of the stomach .
moreover most studies above followed the patients over much different time ( range 3 months to more than 5 years ) .
this may increase select bias , because the possibility of significant increase in tumor size is different over different time .
in this study , all the patients were followed up over the same time ( 1 year , 2 years or more than 3 years ) .
it was also helpful to propose appropriate timing for endoscopic ultrasonography ( eus ) follow - up. we found minimal eus - suspected gists larger than 9.5 mm may be associated with significant progression .
experts recommend eus surveillance of gastric milli - gists , although there are few data to support surveillance at all .
in 2015 , nccn recommended for the patients with gastric minimal gists , eus surveillance at 6 - 12 moths intervals may be considered [ 19 ] .
the study cited by nccn analyzed the data of 37 patients with gists , while only 13.5 % ( 5 / 37 ) of all gists showed < 2 cm in size .
due to insufficient evidences , the latest edition of the guide by nccn [ 9 ] modified its recommendation description to " consider periodic endoscopic surveillance " .
this new study cited by nccn was designed as an online survey from all 413 members of the american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy ( asge ) eus special interest group .
it showed for lesions not resected , 70 % survey annually , 19 % less than annually , 10 % more than annually , and 1 % do not survey [ 20 ] .
while this studies also included a lot of gists > 2 cm. based on experts' preferences , asge recommended annual surveillance is commonly practiced [ 21 ] .
in our study , 15.9 , 14.0 and 23.3 % gists showed significant changes in size , at 1 year , 2 years , and more than 3 years respectively .
so we also recommend endoscopic surveillance annually for all gastric milli - gists .
in addition , with the 9.5 mm cut - off , few of gists < 9.5 mm (< 5 %) showed significant size changes in the first 2 years .
on the contrary , numerous gists >= 9.5 mm showed significant changes even in the first year .
so >= 9.5 mm gist maybe need a eus less than annually .
for the patients with < 9.5 mm gist , eus surveillance at 2 - 3 years interval may be considered .
this strategy may increase the quality of life and enhance the compliance for patients with smaller milli - gist .
some limitations existed in our study .
first , few cases ( 5 / 69 ) enrolled in the study were identified by successfully performing pathological examination of eus - fna , due to technical difficulty or insufficient material to make diagnosis .
although the accuracy of gist diagnosed by using eus is as high as 87 % , [ 2 , 3 ] this would influence the results of our study because of some them might have had benign submucosal tumors , such as leiomyoma .
while in our data , out of 16 tumors with significant increase in tumor size located in the fourth layer on eus , 11 underwent surgical resection and final pathological diagnosis was all gists .
second , this is a single - institution retrospective study .
further confirmation of these findings is needed in a larger , multicentre cohort .
conclusions in conclusion , an initial tumor size larger than 9.5 mm was associated with significant tumor progression and was valuable for predicting the malignant potential gist .
according to our results , the patients with a < 9.5 mm gist may have a eus extended to every 2 - 3 years , while >= 9.5 mm gist should have a eus 6 - 12 months .

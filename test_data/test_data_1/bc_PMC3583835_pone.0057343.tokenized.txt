serpinb2 , also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 , is a major product of activated monocytes / macrophages and is often strongly induced during infection and inflammation ; however , its physiological function remains somewhat elusive .
herein we show that serpinb2 is induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following infection of pigtail macaques with ccr5 - utilizing ( macrophage - tropic ) sivmac239 , but not the rapidly pathogenic cxcr4 - utilizing ( t cell - tropic ) shivmn229 .
to investigate the role of serpinb2 in lentiviral infections , serpinb2 - / - mice were infected with ecohiv , a chimeric hiv in which hiv gp120 has been replaced with gp80 from ecotropic murine leukemia virus .
ecohiv infected serpinb2 - / - mice produced significantly lower anti - gag igg1 antibody titres than infected serpinb2 +/+ mice , and showed slightly delayed clearance of ecohiv .
analyses of published microarray studies showed significantly higher levels of serpinb2 mrna in monocytes from hiv - 1 infected patients when compared with uninfected controls , as well as a significant negative correlation between serpinb2 and t - bet mrna levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
these data illustrate that serpinb2 can be induced by lentiviral infection in vivo and support the emerging notion that a physiological role of serpinb2 is modulation of th1 / th2 responses .

introduction serpinb2 is a member of the clade b or ovalbumin - like serine protease inhibitor ( ov - serpin ) subgroup of the serpin superfamily .
serpinb2 , also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 ( pai - 2 ) , is widely described as an inhibitor of the extracellular urokinase plasminogen activator ( upa ) , and to a lesser extent , tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa ) [ 1 ] .
serpinb2 is induced by a range of pro - inflammatory stimuli and viral , bacterial and parasitic infections [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
serpinb2 is expressed by monocytes / macrophages , dendritic cells , neutrophils and eosinophils , and a range of non - haematopoietic cells .
in activated monocytes / macrophages serpinb2 is often one of the most up - regulated genes and can represent > 0.25 % of total cellular protein [ 1 ] .
despite =~ 950 publications on serpinb2 / pai - 2 in pubmed and the association of serpinb2 with a range of activities in vitro , a consensus view on the physiological function of serpinb2 has yet to emerge [ 1 ] .
using serpinb2 - / - mice we recently obtained evidence that at least one function of serpinb2 is sculpting of the adaptive immune response , with serpinb2 expression associated with suppression of certain th1 responses and / or promotion of certain th2 responses [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
these observations are consistent with the association of dysregulated serpinb2 expression or serpinb2 polymorphisms with th1 / th2 perturbations in several human inflammatory diseases [ 1 ] .
acute hiv - 1 and siv infections are associated with the widespread induction of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including tnf [ 5 ] .
since inflammation generally , and tnf in particular , are well known to induce serpinb2 expression [ 1 ] , [ 6 ] , one might predict that these primate lentiviral infections would up - regulate serpinb2 expression .
in vitro experiments have reported induction of serpinb2 ( i ) in macrophages by gp120 from m - tropic hiv [ 7 ] , ( ii ) in monocyte - derived dendritic cells by hiv infection [ 8 ] and ( iii ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) stimulated with baculovirus - expressed hiv pr55gag virus - like particles [ 9 ] .
serpinb2 has generally not been identified as being regulated during lentiviral infections in vivo [ 10 ] , perhaps because ( i ) serpinb2 fell outside the focus of the study , ( ii ) cells were used that may not express serpinb2 ( eg t cells ) [ 11 ] , or ( iii ) array platforms were used that did not contain serpinb2 [ 12 ] .
in vitro experiments using cell lines stably expressing serpinb2 suggested serpinb2 expression might facilitate hiv replication [ 7 ] .
however , this work was largely based on serpinb2 - expressing cell lines generated by transfection and selection , a process that can result in clonal bias [ 1 ] , [ 13 ] .
nevertheless , preferential replication of siv in monkey monocytes expressing serpinb2 in vivo was observed in a microarray study [ 14 ] .
global genomic or rnai screens have not identified serpinb2 as an important host protein for hiv replication [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
however , the cell lines used do not usually express significant levels of serpinb2 ; for instance , serpinb2 expression is ordinarily undetectable in hela [ 18 ] and hek293 cells [ 19 ] .
another microarray study showed that effective vaccination was associated with higher serpinb2 expression ( when compared with unvaccinated controls ) in pbmc following siv challenge [ 20 ] , perhaps supporting the view that serpinb2 has a role in immunity [ 1 ] .
to obtain a clearer understanding of whether serpinb2 is induced during lentivirus infections in vivo , we analyzed serpinb2 mrna and protein expression in serial pbmc samples obtained from pigtail macaques infected with 2 primate lentiviruses ; ( i ) sivmac251 , which utilizes the ccr5 co - receptor to enter cells and therefore readily infects macrophages as well as memory cd4 t cells [ 21 ] , or ( ii ) the highly pathogenic shivmn229 , which utilizes the cxcr4 co - receptor to enter cells and therefore primarily infects naive cd4 t cells [ 22 ] .
we found serpinb2 was induced in siv infections , and we therefore investigated the potential role of serpinb2 in lentiviral infections in vivo by infecting serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ littermate control mice [ 4 ] with ecohiv .
ecohiv is a chimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) , in which gp120 has been replaced with gp80 from ecotropic murine leukemia virus [ 23 ] .
taken together with analysis of published microarray data from human hiv - 1 infections , the data presented herein supports the view that serpinb2 is induced during siv and hiv infections , and that serpinb2 modulates anti - lentiviral th1 / th2 responses .
materials and methods monkey infections and monitoring sivmac251 and shivmn229 infection of pigtail macaques ( macaca nemestrina ) and gathering of clinical and immunological data were undertaken as described [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
all monkey experiments were approved by the university of melbourne animal ethics committee and adhered to the national health and medical research council ( australia ) code of practice for the care and use of animals .
viral loads were determined by quantitative real - time reverse transcriptase pcr ( qrt - pcr ) as described [ 24 ] .
siv - specific t cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining for ifngamma expression using overlapping 15 mer peptide sets spanning sivmac239 gag ( nih aids reagent repository ) as described [ 21 ] , [ 24 ] .
the percentage of cd4 + cells in the cd3 + population from pbmc was determined by facs as described [ 24 ] .
qrt - pcr of monkey and mouse samples cryogenically stored pbmcs ( 4 - 7x106 ) from sivmac251 ( macaque animal numbers 3c7d , 3117 , 5612 , 5831 6115 , 6158 , 6288 ) [ 21 ] and shivmn229 ( macaque animal numbers 1253 , 1281 , 4194 , 4265 , 4529 and h3 ) [ 22 ] infected pigtail macaques were rapidly thawed in a 37degreesc water bath , diluted in 10 ml of ice cold rpmi1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and were pelleted by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 min at 4degreesc .
cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) and rna extracted according to manufacturer 's instructions .
rna quality and quantity was assessed by nanodrop nd - 1000 spectrophotometer ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) and gel electrophoresis .
cdna was synthesized as described previously [ 4 ] .
qrt - pcr was undertaken as described [ 4 ] using the following primers ; serpinb2 forward gaccagatggccaaggtgc , serpinb2 reverse gagagagcggaaggatgaatgg .
serpinb2 mrna levels were normalized to rpl13a mrna levels ; primers were rpl13a forward catcgtggctaaacaggtactg , rpl13a reverse cgcacgaccttgagggcagc .
murine spleens were homogenized in trizol using 5 mm steel ball bearings and a tissuelyser ( qiagen , venlo , nl ) and peritoneal exudates cells ( pecs ) were lysed directly in trizol reagent .
all rna samples were treated with dnase i ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma , usa ) as per manufacturer 's instructions prior to cdna synthesis and qrt - pcr as described above .
the primers used were mlv env forward tagggccaaaccccgttctg , mlv env reverse gccggtggaagttgggtagg .
mlv env rna levels were normalized to rpl13a mrna levels ; rpl13a forward gaggtcgggtggaagtacca , rpl13a reverse tgcatcttggccttttcctt .
serpinb2 protein quantitation following rna extraction from the aqueous trizol fraction ( see above ) , protein was extracted from the interphase and phenol trizol fractions as per manufacturer 's instructions ( invitrogen ) .
protein pellets were solubilised in 1 % sds and heated at 50degreesc and total protein concentrations were determined by bca protein assay ( pierce , rockford , il , usa ) .
serpinb2 protein levels were determined by imubind ( r ) pai - 2 elisa ( american diagnostica , pfungstadt , germany ) .
protein samples were diluted 1:20 in elisa sample buffer ( american diagnostica ) and the elisa was performed as per manufacturer 's instructions .
ecohiv pecohiv was kind gift from drs d volsky and mj potash ( st. luke 's - roosevelt hospital , columbia university medical center , ny , usa ) .
ecohiv ( nl4.3 ) was generated as described previously [ 23 ] .
briefly , ecohiv plasmid ( 50 microg ) was diluted to 500 microl in 2.5 mm hepes buffer ( ph 7.3 ) , 1 ml of 0.5 m cacl2 was then added , followed by 1 ml of 2x hepes buffered saline ( ph 7.05 ) added drop - wise whilst vortexing .
the transfection mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being added drop - wise to a t150 flask of 80 % confluent 293t cells .
sixteen hours post - transfection , cells were washed twice with 20 ml of pbs , and fresh culture medium added .
sixty - four and 88 h post - transfection , supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200xg for 7 min at 4degreesc , and the supernatants filtered through a 0.45 microm filter to remove cellular debris .
ecohiv was concentrated by centrifugation of the filtrate at 3800xg for 20 - 30 min in a 100,000 molecular weight cut - off amicon ultra centrifugal filter ( millipore , billerica , ma , usa ) .
ecohiv stocks were analysed by hiv - 1 p24 elisa kit ( zeptometrix corporation , buffalo , ny , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions to determine the concentration of p24 protein .
mice and ecohiv infection and monitoring serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ littermate control colonies on a c57bl / 6 background were established as described [ 4 ] .
mice ( 6 - 12 weeks old females ) were infected by intra - peritoneal injection of 2.5 microg p24 ecohiv in 1 ml of dmem .
at the indicated time points mice were euthanised by co2 asphyxiation and splenocytes , pecs and serum harvested .
all mouse experiments were approved by the qimr animal ethics committee and adhered to the national health and medical research council ( australia ) code of practice for the care and use of animals .
anti - gag antibody elisa maxisorp nunc - immuno 96 well plates ( nunc , roskilde , dk , usa ) were coated with 80 ng / well ( in 40 microl ) hiv - 1 nl4 - 3 gag protein ( prospecbio , israel ) overnight at 4degreesc .
plates were then blocked with 200 microl of 5 % skim milk in pbs for 1 hour at room temperature , and washed three times in pbs / 0.01 % tween20 ( pbs / t ) .
serum ( 60 microl / well ) was serially diluted ( 1:2 ) in 1 % skim milk / pbs / t and added to the wells at room temperature for 2 h. after washing , 70 microl of biotin - conjugated rat anti - mouse igg1 ( 1:1500 ) ( a85 - 1 , bd bioscience , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) or biotin - conjugated rat anti - mouse igg2c ( 1:800 ) ( r19 - 15 ) diluted in pbs / t was added to each well , and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours .
after washing with pbs / t , 100 microl of streptavidin - hrp ( biosource international , camarillo , ca ) in pbs / t ( 1:10,000 ) was added to each well and incubated for 45 min .
the plate was developed by adding 100 microl of abts : h2o2 ( 1000:1 ratio ) ( sigma - aldrich ) and absorbance was read at 405 nm. statistics statistical analysis was performed using spss for windows ( version 19 ; spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
for comparison of two samples , the t test was used when the difference in the variances was < 4 and skewness was > - 2 and kurtosis was < 2 ; otherwise , the non parametric mann - whitney u test was used .
correlations used the non - parametritic spearman 's rank correlation test , which provides a p value and a spearman rank correlation coefficient ( rho ) , which ranges from - 1 ( perfect negative correlation ) to + 1 ( perfect positive correlation ) with 0 denoting no correlation .
results serpinb2 expression is increased after siv and decreased after shiv infection serpinb2 expression levels during acute lentiviral infections in vivo have not previously been investigated .
we thus quantitated serpinb2 mrna expression levels using qrt - pcr in serial pbmc samples from pigtail macaques following infection with either sivmac251 [ 21 ] or the pathogenic shivmn229 [ 22 ] .
three weeks after siv infection serpinb2 mrna levels had increased by a mean 3.7 fold ( range 1.4 - 4.7 , n = 7 per group , p = 0.004 ) , and remained significantly elevated until week 16 ( mean 2.3 fold , p = 0.03 ) ( fig. 1a , siv ) .
the viral load in these monkeys peaked at week 2 post infection , one week prior to the peak serpinb2 induction ( fig. 1b , siv ) .
cd4 t cell counts declined slowly over the study period of 20 weeks ( fig. 1c , siv ) , as observed previously [ 21 ] , [ 24 ] .
in contrast , infection with the cxcr4 - tropic shivmn229 resulted in a reduction in serpinb2 mrna levels in pbmcs ; levels had fallen significantly by week 3 and remained depressed until week 11 ( fig. 1a , shiv , p = 0.008 and 0.04 , respectively ) .
shiv infection also resulted in a peak viral load at week 2 ( fig. 1b , shiv ) , and was characterized by rapid t cell depletion , with all peripheral cd4 t cells essentially lost by week 3 ( fig 1c , shiv ) .
the dramatic and near complete loss of peripheral cd4 t cells is typical of infection of macaques with cxcr4 - utilizing shiv strains [ 22 ] .

to confirm that the significant increase in serpinb2 mrna levels seen at 3 weeks post siv infection ( fig. 1a ) reflected an increase in serpinb2 protein levels , total protein from the same samples used to determine mrna levels were assayed for serpinb2 protein levels using a quantative elisa .
a significant increase in serpinb2 protein levels was observed between week 0 and week 3 ( p = 0.008 paired t test ) .
serpinb2 protein levels in pbmc samples increased by a mean of 63 % ( sd 47 % and range 8 - 115 %) .
although post - transcriptional regulation of serpinb2 expression has been well documented [ 25 ] , a significant correlation between serpinb2 protein and mrna levels was observed ( fig. 1e ) .
the percentage of cd4 and cd8 t cells making ifngamma ( as determined by intracellular cytokine staining of cells stimulated with overlapping peptides covering gag ) following siv infection increased sharply until week 2 - 3 post infection before leveling out ( fig. 1f ) , consistent with previous analyses in this model [ 26 ] .
similar assays for shiv - infected animals showed negligible t cell immunity due to the loss of t cells in this rapidly pathogenic infection ( data not shown , see also [ 26 ]) .
using data for all siv - infected monkeys at all time points , no significant correlation between viral loads , cd4 counts , percentage of cd8 t cells making ifngamma , and serpinb2 mrna expression levels emerged ( data not shown ) .
a significant correlation did emerge between the percentage of antigen - specific cd4 t cells ( as measured by intracellular ifngamma staining ) and the levels of serpinb2 mrna ( fig. 1g ) .
siv - specific cd4 cells are known to make tnf [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and tnf is well known to induce serpinb2 [ 6 ] .
expression of serpinb2 mrna after ecohiv infection to determine whether serpinb2 is induced in mice after ecohiv infection , serpinb2 +/+ mice were infected by intra - peritoneal injection with ecohiv .
the levels of serpinb2 mrna in spleen and peritoneal exudate cells ( pecs ) were measured over time by qrt - pcr .
the serpinb2 mrna levels in ecohiv infected mice decreased significantly by =~ 50 % on days 21 and 41 post infection in both pecs ( p = 0.032 and 0.008 , respectively ) and spleen ( p = 0.029 and 0.016 , respectively ) ( fig. 2a ) .
this occurred despite an influx of macrophages into the peritoneum ( see below ) .

ecohiv infects macrophages and does not result in cd4 t cell depletion [ 23 ] .
to understand why ecohiv infection failed to induce serpinb2 expression , cytokine mrna levels in spleen and pecs were analysed by qrt - pcr at different times post - infection .
no significant induction of ifngamma or tnf was apparent in pecs or spleen ( figure s1 in file s1 ) ; an observation consistent with the modest antigen - specific ifngamma t cell responses seen in this model [ 30 ] .
in contrast , significant induction of il - 6 (~ 25 fold ) and il - 4 mrna ( 6 - 10 fold ) was observed in pecs ( figure s1 in file s1 ) .
il - 4 ( a th2 cytokine ) has been reported to down - regulate serpinb2 expression [ 6 ] .
we were also unable to observe induction of serpinb2 in mouse peritoneal macrophages after ecohiv infection in vitro ( data not shown ) .
this contrasts with m - tropic hiv infection of human pbmcs in vitro , where serpinb2 mrna induction was observed [ 7 ] .
ecohiv replication in serpinb2 +/+ and serpinb2 - / - mice to determine whether serpinb2 might affect ecohiv replication in vivo , serpinb2 +/+ and serpinb2 - / - mice were infected with ecohiv , and ecohiv mrna levels were measured by qrt - pcr using primers that detect all mlv env rna species .
in both pecs and spleens of ecohiv infected mice , viral mrna levels peaked at day 7 post - infection and progressively declined until day 41 ( fig. 2b ) .
although no differences in viral mrna levels were observed in pecs or spleen from serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ mice at day 7 and 14 , significantly higher (=~ 2 fold ) viral mrna levels were detected in serpinb2 - / - pecs at day 21 ( p = 0.049 ) and day 41 ( p = 0.024 ) when compared with serpinb2 +/+ pecs ( fig. 2b , pecs ) .
higher ecohiv mrna levels (=~ 2 fold ) were also observed in serpinb2 - / - spleens at day 21 ( p = 0.004 ) and day 41 ( p = 0.047 ) when compared with spleens from serpinb2 +/+ mice ( fig. 2b ) .
the significant difference in splenic ecohiv mrna levels at day 21 was confirmed using different primers that only detect the 4 kb singly spliced sub - genomic env - 1 rna ( figure s2 in file s1 ) .
we were unable to see any difference in ecohiv replication in serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ macrophages in vitro by qrt - pcr ( figure s3 in file s1 ) , suggesting that in this system ( in contrast to [ 7 ]) , serpinb2 expression by an infected cell does not influence viral replication in that cell .
decreased igg1 responses in ecohiv infected serpinb2 - / - mice we have previously shown that serpinb2 - / - mice show increased levels of igg2c responses ( a th1 - associated antibody isotype ) after vaccination with antigen in freunds complete adjuvant [ 1 ] ( a predominantly th1 immunogen ) and reduced levels of igg1 responses ( a th2 - associated antibody isotype ) after vaccination with schistosome soluble egg antigen ( a predominantly th2 immunogen ) [ 3 ] .
analysis of anti - gag antibody responses in ecohiv - infected mice showed that serpinb2 - / - mice produced significantly lower levels of igg1 responses , with no significant differences in igg2c responses ( fig. 2c ) .
the experiment was repeated with similar results ( figure s4 in file s1 ) .
naive uninfected mice did not show any significant anti - gag antibody responses ( data not shown ) .
thus , as described for schistosome soluble egg antigen vaccination [ 3 ] , serpinb2 expression appeared to be associated with increased th2 responses following ecohiv infection .
we previously reported changes in tnf , ifngamma , il - 4 and / or il - 6 levels in serpinb2 - / - mice [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ; however , no significant and consistent differences in these cytokines ( as measured by qrt - pcr ) were apparent between ecohiv - infected serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ mice ( figure s1 in file s1 ) .
conceivably , other cytokines are involved and / or significant th1 / th2 cytokine differences are present in other sites or cell types .
cell migration was unchanged in ecohiv - infected serpinb2 - / - mice several studies have suggested that serpinb2 inhibits upa - dependent cellular migration [ 1 ] , although no change in lymph node composition was seen in serpinb2 - / - mice after immunisation with freunds complete adjuvant [ 4 ] .
the intra - peritoneal ecohiv infection did result in a progressive increase in the total number of cells in the peritoneum ; however , no significant differences between serpinb2 - / - and serpinb2 +/+ mice were observed ( figure s5 in file s1 ) .
the levels of macrophage - specific f4 / 80 mrna also increased in pecs post infection , but again there was no significant difference between the two mouse strains ( figure s6 in file s1 ) .
analysis of published microarray data from human hiv - 1 infected individuals to determine whether any evidence for serpinb2 induction and th1 / th2 modulation could be found for hiv - 1 infected humans , we searched ncbi geo for informative microarray data sets .
in one study of chronic hiv viraemic patients not on therapy , monocyte serpinb2 mrna levels were found to be significantly higher when compared with uninfected controls , both in an initial analysis and a follow up study [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] ( fig. 3a ) .
in another study , significantly higher levels of serpinb2 mrna were reported for cd4 t cells from hiv infected individuals and elite controllers when compared to uninfected controls [ 33 ] ( figure s7 in file s1 ) .
however , in this study samples with high serpinb2 mrna levels often also had higher levels of cd14 or cd64 mrna ( data not shown herein ) , suggesting that contaminating monocytes may have contributed to serpinb2 signals .
to date , serpinb2 expression by primary t cells has not been formally demonstrated .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0057343.g003 figure 3 analysis of published microarray data from human hiv - 1 - infections in vivo .
( a ) mean serpinb2 mrna levels from published microarray analysis of monocytes isolated from chronic hiv viraemic patients not on therapy [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
the initial analysis involved n = 12 hiv positive (+ ve ) and n = 13 hiv negative ( - ve ) patients , with a follow - up study involving some of the same patients , n = 4 hiv + ve and n = 4 hiv - ve. the expression data was obtained from ncbi geo database ( gse14542 ) .
statistics by mann whitney u test .
( b ) negative correlation between serpinb2 and t - bet mrna levels using published [ 34 ] microarray data from pbmcs isolated from hiv - 1 ( n = 75 ) and control ( n = 12 ) patients .
data was obtained from the ncbi geo database ( gds1449 ) .
statistical analysis was performed using spearman 's rank correlation test ; both p value and spearman rank correlation coefficient ( rho ) are shown .
analysis of data from a microarray study of pbmcs from hiv - 1 infected and uninfected control individuals [ 34 ] , did not show a significant difference in serpinb2 levels between hiv - 1 infected and controls , perhaps because most of the hiv - 1 infected individuals were on treatment .
however , the analysis did show a highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) negative correlation between serpinb2 and t - bet mrna levels ( fig. 3b ) .
t - bet is a transcription factor that drives differentiation of th1 t cells .
a slight , but significant ( p = 0.022 ) , positive correlation between serpinb2 and il - 4 mrna expression levels was also evident ( figure s8 in file s1 ) .
thus higher serpinb2 expression was again associated with lower th1 ( and increased th2 ) responses .
these analyses of published microarray studies thus provide evidence that during hiv - 1 infections in humans , serpinb2 is induced in monocytes and that serpinb2 expression correlates with modulation of th1 / th2 responses .
discussion the induction of serpinb2 mrna in pbmcs after infection of monkeys with the m - tropic sivmac251 is consistent with microarray studies showing significantly increased serpinb2 mrna in circulating monocytes from hiv - 1 infected patients and supports the general concept that monocyte / macrophage serpinb2 is often induced during infection and inflammation [ 1 ] .
one should also perhaps note that analyzing circulating cells may under - represent serpinb2 induction during siv / hiv infections , as viral replication and inflammatory cytokine levels ( and thus serpinb2 induction ) may be higher in secondary lymphoid organs and / or the gut [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
although the physiological role of serpinb2 remains elusive , the evidence from the ecohiv mouse model ( fig. 2c ) and the analysis of published human microarray data ( fig. 3b ) presented herein supports the emerging concept that at least one of the roles of monocyte / macrophage serpinb2 is suppression of th1 and / or promotion of th2 responses [ 1 ] .
such modulation by serpinb2 has now been shown after vaccination [ 4 ] , after parasite antigen vaccination [ 3 ] and ( herein ) after lentiviral infections .
serpinb2 - / - mice infected with ecohiv produced significantly lower gag - specific igg1 responses ( fig. 2c ) ; a th2 modulation similar to that seen in serpinb2 - / - mice vaccinated with schistosome egg antigen [ 3 ] .
the clear il - 4 response seen after ecohiv infection ( fig. s1 ) , suggests ecohiv infection ( like schistosome egg antigen vaccination [ 3 ]) induces a th2 - biased response .
thus in these two very different th2 - biased challenge models , serpinb2 expression appears to promote th2 responses .
the human microarray analysis ( fig. 3b ) suggests that during hiv - 1 infection in humans , higher serpinb2 mrna levels correlate with suppression of th1 ( t - bet ) responses ; a th1 modulation similar to that seen in serpinb2 - / - mice after vaccination with a th1 - promoting vaccine [ 4 ] .
the effects of serpinb2 deficiency on viral load were restricted to later time points ( days 21 and 41 ) ( fig. 2b ) , with serpinb2 - / - mice showing 40 - 50 % higher viral rna levels at these times .
one might speculate ( based on [ 37 ]) that these later differences are related to the lower anti - viral igg1 antibody levels that develop in serpinb2 - / - mice .
this contention is also supported by the negative correlation between anti - ecohiv igg1 levels and ecohiv rna levels , although this did not reach significance ( figure s9 in file s1 ) .
importantly , the ecohiv infection model both in vivo ( fig. 2b ) and in vitro ( figure s3 in file s1 ) suggests that serpinb2 expression by the infected cell does not affect lentiviral replication directly , as was suggested by previous studies [ 7 ] .
instead , serpinb2 may affect viral clearance via modulation of adaptive immune responses .
the lack of serpinb2 mrna induction following ecohiv infection may be due to ( i ) acute induction of il - 4 , which can down - regulate serpinb2 expression [ 6 ] and / or ( ii ) the failure of mlv env to stimulate appropriate signalling in monocytes / macrophages .
these two features of ecohiv infections differ from human hiv infections , where th1 cytokines usually dominate during the acute phase [ 38 ] , and gp120 and infection can induce serpinb2 expression in monocytes / macrophages in vitro [ 7 ] .
the cxcr4 - tropic shiv - infection in pigtail macaques may also represent a less relevant model for most acute hiv infections in humans , where natural transmission is largely restricted to ccr5 - tropic viruses [ 39 ] .
why the shiv infection failed to induce serpinb2 expression remains unclear , but may be due to either : ( i ) different monocytes / macrophage targeting and / or stimulation by this cxcr4 - tropic virus or the gp120 from this virus [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] ; or ( ii ) less microbial translocation induced by shiv [ 42 ] as compared with siv [ 43 ] , with lipopolysaccharide well known to induce macrophage serpinb2 expression [ 1 ] ; or ( iii ) less tnf production ( possibly by cd4 t cells - fig. 1g ) ; with tnf detectable in serum of sivmac251 infected monkeys [ 44 ] , but not in certain shiv infections [ 45 ] ; or ( iv ) conceivably , loss of activated / infected cd4 t cells themselves .
microarray studies have suggested that activated and infected cd4 t cells up - regulate serpinb2 mrna [ 33 ] , [ 46 ] , although low levels of monocyte contamination could account for these results ( figure s7 in file s1 ) .
to our knowledge there are no reports showing that primary t cells make serpinb2 protein .
both siv and hiv infections appear to induce serpinb2 expression in vivo .
serpinb2 has been shown to modulate th1 / th2 responses in the ecohiv mouse model ( fig. 2c ) and two other mouse models [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , with correlative evidence suggesting this may also be the case in human hiv - 1 infections in vivo ( fig. 3b ) and several other human inflammatory diseases [ 1 ] .
there may thus be value in understanding the relationship between immune dysregulation and serpinb2 expression in hiv infections in vivo [ 38 ] .
the role of serpinb2 polymorphisms may also warrant investigation as they have been linked with both lupus [ 47 ] and coronary heart disease [ 48 ] , conditions also modified by hiv infection [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .

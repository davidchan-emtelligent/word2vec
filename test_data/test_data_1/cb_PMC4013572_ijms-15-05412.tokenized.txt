platelets contain three types of granules : alpha granules , dense granules , and lysosomal granules .
each granule contains various growth factors , cytokines , and other physiological substances .
platelets trigger many kinds of biological responses , such as hemostasis , wound healing , and tissue regeneration .
this review presents experimental evidence of platelets in accelerating liver regeneration and improving liver fibrosis .
the regenerative effect of liver by platelets consists of three mechanisms ; i.e. , the direct effect on hepatocytes , the cooperative effect with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells , and the collaborative effect with kupffer cells .
many signal transduction pathways are involved in hepatocyte proliferation .
one is activation of akt and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) 1 / 2 , which are derived from direct stimulation from growth factors in platelets .
the other is signal transducer and activator of transcription - 3 ( stat3 ) activation by interleukin ( il ) - 6 derived from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and kupffer cells , which are stimulated by contact with platelets during liver regeneration .
platelets also improve liver fibrosis in rodent models by inactivating hepatic stellate cells to decrease collagen production .
the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic amp ) is increased by adenosine through its receptors on hepatic stellate cells , resulting in inactivation of these cells .
adenosine is produced by the degradation of adenine nucleotides such as adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and adenosine tri - phosphate ( atp ) , which are stored in abundance within the dense granules of platelets .

introduction : cirrhosis cirrhosis is a serious and life - threatening major health problem worldwide .
it is an advanced form of hepatic fibrosis in response to chronic liver injury [ 1 ] .
up to 64 % of patients with cirrhosis suffer thrombocytopenia [ 2 - 5 ] .
patients with thrombocytopenia sometimes cannot receive antiviral therapy with sufficient doses of interferon for hepatitis virus or curative surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma .
when standard therapy has failed to control cirrhosis , liver transplantation is the only effective therapy [ 6 ] .
unfortunately , liver transplantation is associated with donor shortage , surgical complications , organ rejection , and high cost [ 7 - 11 ] .
patients are often required to wait for many years for liver transplantation because of the shortage of donor organs , and some of them die while waiting .
therefore , alternative treatments are required to treat patients with cirrhosis .
treatment of cirrhosis consists of anti - inflammation , liver regeneration , and improvement of fibrosis .
each of these present very challenging problems in the clinical settings and no clear solutions have been found yet .
2. platelets platelets are derived from megakaryocytes ( mks ) .
megakaryocytes are derived from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells toward mk progenitors .
mature mk produces platelets by cytoplasmic fragmentation occurring through a dynamic and regulated process , called proplatelet formation , and consisting of long pseudopodial elongations that break in the blood flow [ 12 ] .
platelets are discoid and have anucleate structures that contain a large number of secretary granules [ 13 ] .
three types of secretary granules are recognized : alpha granules , dense granules , and lysosomal granules .
each granule contains secretory substances , such as platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , serotonin , adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , adenosine tri - phosphate ( atp ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , and transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) , etc .
[ 13 - 16 ] .
platelets are activated by various types of stimulation and release active substances from the granules [ 13 - 19 ] .
several positive effects have been reported , such as hemostasis [ 17 ] , wound healing [ 20 - 23 ] , and tissue regeneration [ 24 - 29 ] .
on the other hand , there are some negative effects of platelet degranulation , such as inflammation [ 30 ] , malignancy [ 31,32 ] , and immune response [ 33 - 36 ] .
platelets are reported to accumulate in the liver under pathological conditions such as ischemia / reperfusion [ 37 - 40 ] , liver cirrhosis [ 41 ] , cholestasis [ 42 ] , viral hepatitis [ 43 ] , and the residual liver after hepatectomy [ 44 ] .
3. platelets and liver regeneration the proliferative effect of platelets in liver regeneration was first reported in 2006 by lesurtel et al. , who suggested platelet serotonin is important for liver regeneration [ 45 ] .
our first study focused on liver regeneration under thrombocytotic conditions induced by thrombopoietin ( tpo ) [ 44 ] .
tpo is a growth factor that regulates the development of mk and platelet production [ 46 ] .
c - mpl is a tpo receptor , and several novel agents that stimulate human c - mpl and increase platelet levels , such as eltrombopag and romiplostim , are used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia [ 46,47 ] .
we used 0.5 mug of pegylated recombinant human mk growth and development factor ( peg - rhumgdf ) donated by kirin brewery co .
( takasaki , japan ) as tpo [ 44 ] .
tpo was administered intraperitoneally five days before hepatectomy , which increases the peripheral platelet count two to three - fold over the pre - administration state in mice [ 44 ] .
thrombocytotic conditions promote liver regeneration including the liver / total body weight ratio , hepatocyte ki - 67 labeling index and mitotic index [ 44,48 ] , and improve the survival rates after 90 % hepatectomy of mice [ 49 ] .
a significant increase in the hepatic concentrations of hgf and igf - 1 and early and strong phosphorylation of akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription - 3 ( stat3 ) are induced under thrombocytotic conditions [ 44,48 ] .
platelet - rich plasma transfusion was performed after partial hepatectomy , and liver regeneration was accelerated [ 50 ] .
these findings indicate that exogenous platelets also have an impact on liver regeneration through the early initiation of hepatocyte cell cycles after hepatectomy .
the effect of tpo administration on liver regeneration under cirrhotic liver and its anti - fibrosis effects were evaluated after partial hepatectomy [ 51 ] .
tpo increased peripheral platelets and promoted liver regeneration , including increasing the hepatocyte - proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) labeling index and mitotic index in the cirrhotic liver , and improved fibrosis in the peri - portal regions [ 51 ] .
the proliferative effect on acute liver damage after hepatectomy by increasing platelets in a pig model was reported [ 52 ] .
cholestasis , ballooning , and necrosis in the liver are decreased under thrombocytotic conditions and serum aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase levels are low after extended hepatectomy [ 52 ] .
transmission microscopy revealed that the structure of the endothelial lining is well preserved in comparison with the structure observed with a normal platelet count [ 52 ] .
the increased number of platelets protects the sinusoidal lining and prevents acute liver damage after extended hepatectomy .
platelets also protect against fas - mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes in murine acute hepatitis model induced by anti - fas antibody [ 53 ] .
platelets induce immediate activation of the akt pathway , followed by an increase of b - cell lymphoma - extra large ( bcl - xl ) and a decrease of cleaved caspase - 3 in hepatocytes [ 53 ] .
4. signal transduction of liver regeneration by platelets in vivo : platelets accumulate in the liver immediately after hepatectomy .
under normal conditions , liver sinusoidal cavities show intact endothelial lining consisting of liver endothelial cells with flattened processes perforated by small pores [ 54 ] .
these small pores are reported to quickly enlarge within 10 min after hepatectomy [ 54,55 ] .
in response to lipopolysaccharide administration , interleukin - 1 or tumor necrosis factor , platelets accumulate in the liver sinusoidal space within a few minutes , stimulated by a different mechanism of aggregation , and large numbers of platelets are found in the space of disse and even inside some hepatocytes [ 56 - 58 ] .
in our study , platelet accumulation in the liver was observed in thrombocytotic groups in the early period after hepatectomy .
in addition , platelets translocated into the space of disse and had direct contact with hepatocytes 5 min after hepatectomy in the thrombocytosis group , which could be observed by transmission electron microscopy [ 44 ] .
platelets are translocated from the liver sinusoids to the space of disse , and growth factors such as hgf , igf - 1 , and vegf could be released through direct contact between platelets and hepatocytes ( figure 1 ) .
these soluble mediators lead to hepatocyte proliferation .
human platelets are reported to have a very limited amount of hgf [ 59 ] , thus igf - 1 is considered to be the most important mediator for liver regeneration in human platelets .
the akt and erk1 / 2 pathways in whole liver extracts are activated immediately after hepatectomy in thrombocytotic mice , compared with thrombocytopenic mice [ 44 ] .
in vitro : the signal transduction of hepatocytes , which is activated by platelets , was analyzed .
the phosphorylation of akt and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) 1 / 2 were analyzed in murine immortalized hepatocyte tlr2 and primary cultured murine hepatocytes stimulated by platelets [ 60 ] .
the akt pathway and erk1 / 2 pathway are activated within 10 min after adding platelets into the culture medium of hepatocyte in vitro [ 60 ] .
the akt pathway , which is activated by growth factors , is known as a survival signaling pathway [ 61,62 ] .
the erk1 / 2 pathway , which is also activated by growth factors , is involved in growth and differentiation [ 63 ] .
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( lsecs ) enable contact between circulating blood and hepatocytes and help to exchange various soluble macromolecules and nano - particles , such as hyaluronic acid and lipoproteins [ 54 ] .
lsecs are known to produce growth factors , such as hgf and vegf and pro - inflammatory cytokine interleukin ( il ) - 6 and promote liver regeneration after hepatectomy .
elevation of il - 6 concentration after hepatectomy activates the acute phase of protein synthesis by hepatocytes [ 64 ] .
il - 6 binds to the receptor on hepatocytes , which leads to phosphorylate stat3 monomers .
the relationship between platelets and lsecs is addressed in ischemia / reperfusion models [ 65,66 ] , but there have been very few previous studies that focused on the relationship between platelets and lsecs during liver regeneration before our study [ 67 ] .
the role of platelets in liver regeneration in relation to lsecs was evaluated by co - culturing chamber systems in vitro .
this study revealed that direct contact between platelets and lsecs induce il - 6 release from lsecs , and il - 6 derived from lsecs accelerates hepatocyte proliferation .
in addition , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( s1p ) in platelets plays an important role in il - 6 secretion [ 67 ] ( figure 1 ) .
s1p is a lipid mediator that regulates many kinds of biological processes including proliferation , migration , and cytoskeletal reorganization [ 67 ] .
s1p is excreted from activated platelets and interacts with endothelial cells under the conditions of thrombosis , angiogenesis , atherosclerosis , and liver regeneration [ 67 - 69 ] .
zheng et al. revealed that s1p protects lsecs from alcohol - induced apoptosis via activation of enos [ 70 ] .
isabel fernandez - pisonero et al. revealed that s1p combined with lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) activates human umbilical endothelial cells ( huvecs ) , famous endothelial cells , via nf - kappab , erk1 / 2 , and p38 and activated huvecs secrete il - 6 [ 71 ] .
kupffer cells play a role in the liver as resident macrophages that protect the liver from bacteria , endotoxins , and microbial debris derived from the gastrointestinal tract [ 72 ] .
kupffer cells produce important cytokines that enable hepatocyte proliferation after hepatectomy [ 73 ] .
one of the most important events after hepatectomy is an increase in the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha .
an experiment using an antibody against tnf - alpha demonstrated a significant reduction of hepatocyte proliferation [ 74 ] , and mice lacking the tnf - alpha receptor showed severe impairment in liver regeneration after hepatectomy [ 75,76 ] .
the activation of the tnf - alpha receptor increases hepatic expression of the nf - kappab in both hepatocytes and non - parenchymal cells , and is followed by production and release of il - 6 from kupffer cells [ 77 ] .
kupffer cells are considered to be the most important source of both tnf - alpha and il - 6 .
kupffer cell - depleted mice fail to increase tnf - alpha and il - 6 levels that are equivalent to the level in mice with kupffer cells after hepatectomy [ 78 ] .
the collaborative effect of platelets with kupffer cells on liver regeneration is thought to occur after hepatectomy , when activated kupffer cells induce accumulation and activation of platelets in the liver , and the functions of kupffer cells are enhanced by the accumulated platelets .
liver regeneration is promoted by the direct effect of growth factors released from platelets and by the paracrine effect of kupffer cells enhanced by the platelets [ 79 ] ( figure 1 ) .
5. effect of platelets and thrombopoietin receptor agonist in liver cirrhosis as mentioned previously , several novel agents that stimulate human c - mpl and increase platelet levels , such as eltrombopag and romiplostim , are used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia [ 46,47 ] .
these agents are currently in development for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis [ 80 - 82 ] .
the ability to increase platelet count could facilitate the use of interferon - based antiviral therapy and other treatments for liver disease [ 3,83 ] .
it was reported that the increment of platelets induced by tpo administration could improve liver fibrosis in experimental studies with rodents [ 51,84 ] .
dimetylnitrosamine was administered three times a week for three weeks to induce liver fibrosis in rats .
five days after administrating tpo intravenously , 70 % hepatectomy was performed and liver fibrosis was compared 24 h after hepatectomy .
the increase of platelets inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cell ( hsc ) and reduced the fibrotic area of the cirrhotic liver , and these effects were diminished by administration of antiplatelet serum [ 51 ] .
carbon tetrachloride ( ccl4 ) was administered twice a week for eight weeks to induce liver fibrosis in mice .
tpo was administered intraperitoneally once a week from five to eight weeks during the experiment [ 84 ]. by administering tpo , liver fibrosis was decreased [ 84 ] .
although the precise mechanisms between the increment of platelets and the liver anti - fibrotic effect are still unclear , one reason may be that platelets enhanced the expression of hgf by about 14 % [ 51 ] , whereas the matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( mmp9 ) was enhanced by about three times , thereby stimulating fibrolysis , and decreased pro - fibrotic growth factor tgf - beta [ 84 ] .
mmps such as mmp - 8 , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 13 possess the ability to degrade the extracellular matrix by breakdown of collagen type i [ 85 - 87 ] .
mmp - 9 may indirectly contribute to fibrolysis by accelerating hsc apoptosis [ 88 ] .
in murine bile duct ligation model , thrombocytopenia exacerbates liver fibrosis , and platelets have anti fibrotic role in suppressing type i collagen expression via the hgf - met signaling pathway [ 89 ] .
recently , takahashi et al. reported that transfused human platelets improved liver fibrosis of severe combined immune deficiency ( scid ) mice induced by ccl4 [ 90 ] .
an increase of murine hgf and a decrease of tgf - beta were observed in the liver [ 90 ] .
based on these animal experiments , clinical trial was performed .
maruyama et al. recently reported the clinical trial to investigate whether platelet transfusion improves liver function in patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis ( child - pugh class a or b ) , who all presented thrombocytopenia ( platelet counts between 50,000 and 100,000 / mul ) .
the subjects received 10 units of platelet concentrate once a week for 12 weeks .
one and three months after the last transfusion , significant improvement of serum albumin was observed .
serum cholinesterase improved for nine months after the last transfusion .
serum hyaluronic acid represents liver fibrosis , and that showed a tendency toward improvement after the last transfusion [ 91 ] .
6. signal transduction of liver fibrolysis induced by platelets and thrombopoietin ( tpo ) in the long - term natural history of chronic liver injury , such as viral infection , alcohol , and non - alcoholic steatohepatitis , liver fibrosis occurs .
liver fibrosis is known to be part of a dynamic process of continuous extracellular matrix ( ecm ) remodeling , which leads to the excessive accumulation of several extracellular proteins , proteoglycans , and carbohydrates [ 92 ] .
among the cellular populations in the liver , hscs are reported to have the most involvement in liver fibrosis through the production of large amounts of ecm and the secretion of tgf - beta , which appears to be a key mediator of liver fibrosis [ 93 - 95 ] .
in the response to liver injury , hscs are activated to convert from vitamin a storing star - like cells into contractile myofibroblastic cells [ 92 ] .
recently , ikeda et al. reported that human platelets contributed to the suppression of hsc activation and reduction of type i collagen production in vitro [ 96 ] .
the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic amp ) is increased by adenosine through its receptors on hscs , and intracellular cyclic amp is related to the inactivation of hscs ( figure 2 ) .
large amounts of adenosine around hscs are produced by the degradation of adenine nucleotides such as adp and atp , which are stored in abundance within the dense granules of platelets .
it is possible to say that activated hscs are inactivated by adenosine and have a decreased ability to produce tgf - beta and secrete ecm [ 96 ] ( figure 2 ) .
in rodents , platelet - derived hgf suppresses tgf - beta and type i collagen gene expression in cultured hscs [ 89 ] ( figure 2 ) .
these findings indicate that platelets suppress liver fibrosis by inactivating hsc .
7. conclusions this review discussed previous evidence of platelets promoting liver regeneration and improving liver fibrosis .
there are three different mechanisms of liver regeneration induced by platelets : ( i ) direct effect on hepatocytes ; ( ii ) a cooperative effect with lsecs ; and ( iii ) a cooperation with kupffer cells .
there is significant evidence that platelets play a role in improving fibrosis .
atp and adp inside platelets are degraded by hscs and adenosine is incorporated into hscs .
cyclic amp is increased by adenosine and hscs become inactivated by cyclic amp .
therefore , platelet therapy , i.e. , platelet transfusion and tpo receptor agonist administration would open a new avenue to develop novel strategies for the treatment of liver diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment except transplantation .

liver regeneration promoted by platelets .
platelets accumulate in the liver immediately after hepatectomy .
platelets translocate from the sinusoidal space to the space of disse and release growth factors such as insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) and hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) through direct contact with hepatocytes , which subsequently induce initiation of hepatocyte mitosis ; the direct contact between platelets and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( lsecs ) triggers the release of sphingosine 1 - phosphate ( s1p ) from platelets , which leads to excretion of interleukin - 6 ( il6 ) from lsecs .
il6 from lsecs promotes proliferation of hepatocytes ; and kupffer cells ( kcs ) and platelet interaction activated kcs after hepatectomy .
activated kcs release tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnfalpha ) and il6 .
igf - 1 and hgf activates akt and erk1 / 2 in the hepatocytes .
il6 stimulates sta3 activation .
these signal transduction molecules proliferate hepatocytes .
figure 2 .
scheme showing the functions of platelets in the suppression of liver fibrosis .
under chronic viral infection , quiescent hepatic stellate cells ( hscs ) become activated and produce a large amount of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and participate in the progression of liver fibrosis .
after the treatment to increase the platelet count , including administration of thrombopoietin ( tpo ) and platelet transfusion , platelets come in contact with hscs and release adenine nucleotides such as adenosine 5 ' - diphosphate ( adp ) and adenosine 5 ' - triphosphate ( atp ) .
these adenine nucleotides subsequently lead to the production of adenosine through the degradation by hscs .
adenosine is incorporated to hsc via the adenosine receptor and increase cyclic amp in the hscs .
increased cyclic amp plays an important role in the inactivation of hscs .
platelets also contribute to the expression of hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) in the liver .
activated hscs are inactivated by adenosine or hgf to reduce the production of ecm .

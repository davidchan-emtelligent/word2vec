metabolomics provides a powerful platform to characterize plants at the biochemical level , allowing a search for underlying genes and associations with higher level complex traits such as yield and nutritional value .
efficient and reliable methods to characterize metabolic variation in economically important species are considered of high value to the evaluation and prioritization of germplasm and breeding lines .
in this investigation , a large - scale metabolomic survey was performed on a collection of diverse perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne l. ) plants .
a total of 2,708 data files , derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry ( lcms ) , were selected to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of applying high throughput metabolomics to survey chemical diversity in plant populations .
the data set was generated from 23 ryegrass populations , with 3 - 25 genotypes per population , and five clonal replicates per genotype .
we demonstrate an integrated approach to rapidly mine and analyze metabolic variation from this large , multi - batch lcms data set .
after performing quality control , statistical data mining and peak annotation , a wide range of variation for flavonoid glycosides and plant alkaloids was discovered among the populations .
structural variation of flavonoids occurs both in aglycone structures and acetylated / malonylated / feruloylated sugar moieties .
the discovery of comprehensive metabolic variation among the plant populations offers opportunities to probe into the genetic basis of the variation , and provides a valuable resource to gain insight into biochemical functions and to relate metabolic variation with higher level traits in the species .
metabolomics chemotyping flavonoid glycosides plant alkaloids perennial ryegrass introduction perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne l. ) is a widespread species in pasture and amenity settings throughout temperate latitudes .
compared to other forage species such as festuca spp. , the value of perennial ryegrass generally lies in its rapid establishment , long growing season , high palatability , and digestibility for ruminant animals ( humphreys et al. , 2010 ) .
to date the main focus of ryegrass improvement has been on yield , heading date , disease resistance , seasonal growth , and persistence ( williams et al. , 2007 ) .
perennial ryegrass is an obligate outcrossing species with limited information on genetic regulation of the targeted ( often complex ) traits .
this knowledge limitation may be part of the reason why the rate of genetic gain for forage yield achieved in this species has been modest ( brummer and casler , 2014 ) .
some of the most important aspects of dissecting a complex trait is to accurately characterize the target trait and trait components , and to elucidate genetic and environmental factors affecting the trait .
for example , enhanced grass digestibility in ruminants is of long standing research interest .
metabolites associated with aspects of digestibility have been reported including phenolic acids ( theodorou et al. , 1987 ) , lignin ( vogel and jung , 2001 ) , and water soluble carbohydrates ( rasmussen et al. , 2012 ) .
however , the underlying metabolic mechanism for digestibility of grasses is far from clear .
global metabotyping , i.e. , phenotyping at the metabolic level , may offer new opportunities to identify all the chemical components , followed by modeling their combined effects on digestibility or other complex traits .
high - throughput metabolomics not only provides the power to survey natural metabolic variation of known and novel molecules among and within populations , it also enables accurate detection of associated genes ( dumas et al. , 2007 ) .
across a range of species , metabolomics has become a powerful platform which can be used to investigate genetic diversity at the metabolic level ( fernie and klee , 2011 ; langridge and fleury , 2011 ) , to draw associations between metabolic phenotypes and morphological traits ( hu et al. , 2014 ) , and to identify genetic loci ( koulman et al. , 2009 ) or to clone genes governing the accumulation of biologically important metabolites ( dumas et al. , 2007 ) .
due to the dynamics and structural complexity of natural metabolites different analytical platforms have to be employed to investigate each class of metabolites .
thus , the types of metabolites that can be measured are necessarily limited by different analytical methods in extraction , separation and detection .
in this study , a non - targeted metabolomics platform using liquid chromatography ( reversed phase ( rp ) , hydrophobicity based ) coupled to high resolution electrospray ionization ( esi ) mass spectrometry ( lcms ) was employed ( fraser et al. , 2014 ) , to enable ready detection of semi - polar compounds .
in perennial ryegrass , metabolic research interests have focused on plant - endophyte interactions ( cao et al. , 2008 ; rasmussen et al. , 2008 ; ponce et al. , 2009 ; qawasmeh et al. , 2012 ) , with little effort pursued on the natural metabolic variation of the host plant itself .
the objectives of this study were : ( 1 ) to evaluate the reproducibility of lcms - based metabolomics from large , multi - batch experiments ; ( 2 ) to study metabolic profiles within and among ryegrass populations and ; ( 3 ) to discuss the opportunities and limitations of high throughput metabolomics in genetic studies and improvement of ryegrass , and outcrossing plant species in general .
results data quality evaluation of the detected peaks thirty - two thousand , two hundred and seventy - three peaks from positive esi and 20,838 peaks from negative esi were detected from 1,331 to 1,377 samples , including controls , respectively .
for the convenience of discussion , a nomenclature for peaks is assigned as for example , cp434.2167 _ 4.58 , where cp represents the c18 column in positive ion mode , 434.2167 the measured m / z and 4.58 the retention time in minutes .
accordingly , cn denotes peaks from the negative esi .
after applying a series of quality control filtering , including peak merging , batch effect normalization , and de - isotoping procedures 28,043 cp peaks were retained .
overall quality was evaluated by principal component analysis ( pca ) where control samples ( n = 71 ) are differentiated from all experimental samples ( the pg group , n = 1162 ) ( figure 1a ) in a space spanned by pc1 ( 5.2 %) and pc2 ( 4.1 %) .
the separation of control samples demonstrates the effectiveness of the peak filtering procedures for correcting the batch effect which was the predominant variation prior to filtering ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
similar results were found for 15,486 cn peaks ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
figure 1 ( a ) principal component analysis analysis based on 28,043 cp peaks from 1,162 experimental samples ( pg group ) and 71 controls ( control group ) .
( b ) distribution of the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of all the peaks , evaluated based on the replicates ( n = 5 ) of each genotype .
excluding the control samples , a statistical filtering ( kruskal test , p - values < 0.05 ) was applied to retain peaks of biological interest among the 23 populations .
this led to 17,579 cp peaks from 1,162 pg samples .
to assess the technical variability and evaluate the quality of individual peaks , we first calculated the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of the five replicates in each of 233 genotypes , and the median value of cv among all genotypes .
among all 17,579 cp peaks , 42.1 % of peaks exhibited cv < 0.3 ( figure 1b ) , indicating appreciable variation but an adequate number of peaks measured with certainty to justify peak annotation .
data quality should comprise both the reproducibility of peak intensity and the reliability of peak identity .
however , in large scale metabolomics studies peak complexity often confounds peak identification due to a mixture of compounds within a peak or the difficulty in peak alignment .
in this study , as illustrated in figure 2 , we follow three criteria for annotation : ( 1 ) isotopic peak presence , e.g. , to annotate the peak of interest cp697.1593 _ 4.15 , its isotopic peak ( cp698.1630 _ 4.15 ) must be present in the peak annotation table ; ( 2 ) use of the correlation structure of top ranked peaks to enable a group of peaks , often co - eluting , to be annotated simultaneously rather than on an individual basis ; and ( 3 ) search in the raw data generated from highly expressed samples and compute the mean mass spectrum of the eluting peak for spectral interpretation .
any peaks deficient in these aspects of information are largely excluded from discussion in this study .
as an example ( figure 2 ) , the extracted ion chromatogram ( eic ) of m / z 697.1593 +/ - 20 ppm was retrieved from a sample with a strong peak intensity and the mean mass spectrum was constructed from individual peaks .
the mass spectrum of peak 1 at 4.15 min ( 249 s ) , with co - eluting ions m / z 287.05 , 449.11 indicates the presence of aglycone kaempferol ( k ) and the release of hexose ( m / z 162 ) moieties ; the loss of m / z 248.05 indicates the presence of a malonyl hexose ( mahex ) .
we assume m / z 162 as glucose ( glc ) as it is the most commonly found hexose in plant flavonoid o - glycosides .
therefore , cp697.1593 _ 4.15 can be annotated as k - glc - maglc , where maglc represents mahex .
a loss of m / z 146 can be attributed to rhamnose ( rha ) because it is the only deoxyhexose known to form natural flavonoid conjugates .
figure 2 illustration of annotation methods .
to annotate a targeted peak cp697.1593 _ 4.15 , it 's isotopic peak ( cp698.1630 _ 4.15 ) must be present in the peak annotation table , and the peak retention time must be located in [ rtmin , rtmax ] in the peak annotation table ( step 1 ) ; use correlation structure of top ranked peaks so that highly correlated peaks ( r > 0.9 ) can be annotated together , with co - eluting peaks often assigned as fragment ions ( step 2 ) ; extracted ion chromatogram ( eic ) of m / z 697.1593 +/ - 20 ppm was retrieved from a sample with strong peak intensity , the average mass spectrum was constructed from each individual peak ( step 3 ) .
here the mass spectrum of peak 1 at 4.15 ( 249 s ) , with co - eluting ions m / z 287.05 , 449.11 , can be annotated as k - glc - maglc .
peak 2 is an isomeric peak of cp697.1593 _ 4.15 , with characteristic ions m / z 287.05 , 449.11 and 535.11 .
the presence of m / z 535.11 ( - 86 ) further suggests the presence of a malonyl group in the molecule .
distinct metabolic profiles in populations of north african origin the median peak intensity among the five clonal replicates was used to assess clonal variation among the 233 genotypes ( individual plants ) .
those peaks that are invariant ( kruskal test , p - value > 0.05 ) among the 23 populations ( including cultivars , ecotypes and breeding lines ) were removed .
17,579 cp peaks and 12,238 cn peaks were consequently retained to investigate the pattern of variation among the populations .
based on the 17,579 cp peaks the upgma ( unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean ) clustering of 23 ryegrass populations reveals ' pg238 ' and ' tunisia ' are clearly differentiated from the others ( figure 3 ) .
both populations are of north african origin , ' pg238 ' being a moroccan ecotype and ' tunisia ' a tunisian ecotype .
all other populations are european and new zealand cultivars or breeding lines .
figure 3 upgma clustering of 23 ryegrass populations ( euclidean distance metric was used ; based on 17 , 579 cp peaks ) .
pg238 and tunisia populations show profiles distinct from all others .
an empirical bayes method ( smyth , 2004 ) was used to identify peaks differentiated among the populations .
many cp / cn peaks were shown to be significantly different , with fdr ( false discovery rate ) adjusted p - value < 0.01 , among the 23 populations. with a test on the 711 most intense cp peaks ( with mean intensity > 1e5 ) , 551 ( 77.5 %) were found to be significant and likewise , 86.5 % ( 365 / 422 ) of the cn peaks were significantly different .
here , we only focus on the intense peaks ( which likely give rise to more informative spectra ) , and use a ranking algorithm ( ahdesmaki and strimmer , 2010 ) to select the top 50 most differentiated peaks to carry out annotation .
among the top ranked cp / cn peaks ( supplementary data 1 and data 2 ) many are only present or absent in ' pg238 . '
an example is peak cp667.1858 _ 5.46 ( figure 4 ) , which can be annotated as isorhamnetin - acetylglucosyl - rhamnoside .
our annotation reveals that the top ranked cp / cn peaks represent a class of flavonoids and their derivatives , which can be characterized by typical fragment ions in mass spectra .
briefly , the backbone of this class of molecules can be identified by the characteristic accurate m / z in positive ion mode , with m / z 287.05 of kaempferol ( k ) , m / z 303.05 of quercetin ( q ) and m / z 317.06 of isorhamnetin ( i ) , in protonated form [ m + h ]+ , respectively .
these three main flavonols are commonly found in lolium spp. , often existing as o - glycosides ( qawasmeh et al. , 2012 ) .
sugar conjugates are also found acetylated with a typical loss of m / z 204 , and acetylhexose is denoted as acglc , hereafter .
as a result , a number of annotated metabolites , such as i - acglc - rha ( cp667.1858 _ 5.46 , cn665.2085 _ 5.39 ) , i - acglc ( cp521.1286 _ 5.89 ) , q - acglc - rha ( cp653.1703 _ 5.11 ) and q - acglc ( cp507.1128 _ 5.59 , cn505.0985 _ 5.54 ) , are only present in ' pg238 . '
among the top ranked peaks ( supplementary data 1 and data 2 ) are also fragment peaks , which are correlated and co - eluting , for example cn300.0272 _ 5.55 is a fragment peak from cn505.0985 _ 5.54 .
figure 4 ( a ) example of a pg238 specific peak cp667.1858 _ 5.46 , annotated as i - acglc - rha .
the barplot is based on the median averaged peak intensity of all the samples from the populations .
( b ) eic plots of three randomly selected data files from pg238 and tolosa , respectively .
chromatographic peaks , although shifting , are well formed in pg238 samples but no signals detected from tolosa samples .
another group of metabolites that are absent in both ' pg238 ' and ' tunisia ' include k - glc - maglc ( cp697.1593 _ 4.15 , cp535.1073 _ 4.15 , see it 's annotation in figure 2 ) , and k - glc ( cp449.1071 _ 4.04 , cp287.0545 _ 4.04 ) .
k - glc - maglc can also be confirmed by its presence in the top cn peaks as cn695.133 _ 4.13 .
notably , among three isomeric peaks both cn651.1567 _ 5.07 and cn651.1564 _ 5.29 are present only in ' pg238 ,' whereas cn651.1563 _ 4.13 is absent .
interrogation of the raw data indicated the two peaks present in ' pg238 ' are q - derivatives ; and the absent peak is the k - derivative ( k - glc - maglc ) .
further to this , cp288.1590 _ 5.17 is present only in ' tunisia . '
we predicted its formula as c17h22no3 ([ m + h ]+) and annotated the peak as thesinine .
this peak formed its own group in peak clustering analysis ( supplementary data 2 ) .
however , thesinine rhamnoside ( the - rha ) , detected as cp434.2167 _ 4.80 , among the top ranked peaks ( supplementary data 1 , to be discussed further in the following section ) , is only present at a very low level in ' tunisia . '
to summarize , ryegrass populations can be effectively separated by mass signals without metabolite identification .
subsequent peak annotations revealed structural differences in flavonoids amongst the ryegrass populations , where flavonoid glycosides uniquely present in ' pg238 ' are all q ( q - acglc - rha , q - acglc ) and i derived ( i - acglc - rha , i - acglc ) , but not k derived .
k derived flavonoid glycosides including k - glc - maglc and k - glc were found absent in both ' pg238 ' and ' tunisia . '
the unique presence of thesinine in the ' tunisian ' population indicates its specific regulation of thesinine , whose relation to the - rha remained to be explored .
metabolic variation among populations excluding north african origin populations ' pg238 ' and ' tunisia ' have very different metabolic features from the other 21 populations , evident by the qualitative variation amongst the top 50 ranked cp / cn peaks .
to further assess quantitative differences in metabolic profile among the rest of the perennial ryegrass populations , we exclude the two populations from the following analysis .
linear discriminate analysis was initially applied to all of the 1,057 samples ( genotypes x reps ) with 17,579 cp peaks partly revealing population structures ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
while discriminate analysis may overfit as it aims to maximize separation between groups , all the genotypes from a given population formed a single cluster suggesting good data quality overall .
using upgma clustering analysis we investigated relationships among the 21 populations , revealing that the metabolic profile is strongly associated with population provenance ( figure 5 ) .
largely , two sub - clusters are formed comprised of populations in cluster a of new zealand ( nz ) origin and in cluster b of european origin .
more specifically , both the populations ' option ' and ' premium ' were cultivars bred in northern europe ; and ' ga214 ' and ' flp0962 ' were developed from similar european accessions .
within cluster a there is some differentiation between ' samson ,' a cultivar bred from nz - adapted material , and cultivars and breeding lines wholly - or partly derived from germplasm originating in the north west of spain .
' pg2020 ' originates from crosses between ' pg238 ' and breeding lines containing nz and north west spain germplasm .
' hilary ' is a selection from the older nz cultivar ' ruanui . '
encouraged by the distinct patterns that are associated with breeding history we then aimed to identify metabolites specific to populations .
figure 5 upgma clustering of 21 populations using euclidean distance metric among 17,579 cp peaks .
cluster a represents the populations of new zealand ( nz ) origin and cluster b of european origin .
using the same ranking algorithm described we identified the top 50 differential cp and cn peaks among these 21 populations .
the most varied metabolite , as shown on the top ranked list ( supplementary data 3 ) is the - rha ( figure 6 ) .
the - rha is represented by the peak cp434.2167 _ 4.80 and its fragment peak cp288.159 _ 4.80 .
another isomer of the - rha , cp434.2167 _ 4.58 , highly correlated with cp434.2167 _ 4.80 ( r > 0.98 , n = 23 ) , is also present in the top list .
two isomers of e / z - thesinine - o - 4 ' - alpha - rhamnoside have been structurally elucidated in ryegrass ( koulman et al. , 2008 ). by using direct infusion mass spectrometry ( dims ) the - rha showed significant genetic variation between cultivars ' samson ' and ' impact ,' being more abundant in ' samson ' ( koulman et al. , 2009 ) , which is also seen here ( figure 6 ) .
figure 6 distribution of thesinine rhamnoside ( cp434.2167 _ 4.80 ) abundance among the populations .
pg238 and tunisia lack this compound .
wider variation occurs within the flp0962 , pg2020 , ga214 , and flp641 population samples .
among the top varied metabolites is k - glc - maglc , represented by the top peaks cp697.1598 _ 4.04 , cp535.1075 _ 4.04 , cp449.1071 _ 4.04 , and cp287.0545 _ 4.04 .
k - glc - maglc , which is absent from ' pg238 ' and ' tunisia ' as shown in the previous section , is present at a low level in ' ga214 ,' and at the highest level in ' tolosa . '
the annotation of this cp peak list indicates that k and its derivatives are notably varied among the 21 populations .
annotating the two sets of top ranked peaks ( supplementary data 3 and data 4 ) demonstrates the challenges in assigning peaks to metabolites .
one challenge is that a peak may represent a mixture of compounds due to insufficient chromatographic separation .
peaks in this category include cp859.1917 _ 5.21 ( a mixture q - and k - derivatives ) , cn695.1332 _ 4.03 , cn695.1468 _ 4.24 [ a mixture of chlorogenic acid ( cgas ) derivative and k - derivative ] .
other challenges are due to the limited in - source fragmentation for annotation , for example cp659.3629 _ 8.94 and cp261.2209 _ 8.94 and the peak mis - alignment , see discussion as follows .
while it is challenging to establish systematic approaches to evaluate the reliability of peak identification among a large number of samples , our prior knowledge of the chemical structures of the - rha in ryegrass ( koulman et al. , 2008 ) offers a unique opportunity to examine this empirically. with its theoretical mass of 434.2173 [ m + h ]+ and a 20 ppm window , we found six peaks detected and captured in the peak annotation table .
these six peaks have only m / z < 1.4 ppm error from the theoretical mass , but with much wider variation in peak retention , from 3.88 to 4.80 min .
although only two peaks can be discerned in each individual sample ( figure 7a ) , when all 20 samples from ' samson ,' run in 18 different batches , are taken together it becomes impossible to differentiate the retention time of the two peaks across batches ( figure 7b ) .
as a result , six peaks were assigned in peak detection instead of two .
chromatographic peak mis - alignment may be unavoidable for closely eluted peaks in multi - batch experiments .
different peak alignment algorithms may be employed to evaluate their performance but can be time - consuming for large data sets ( see discussion ) .
we undertook peak aggregation analysis by summing up all the detected isomeric peaks when the identification of isobaric metabolites among samples is evaluated as uncertain .
figure 7 ( a ) two isomeric peaks of the - rha eluted at 4.63 min ( 278 s ) and 4.83 min ( 290 s ) in one sample ; ( b ) the two peaks superimposed from all the 20 samson samples , run in 18 different batches .
we performed a peak aggregation analysis of quercetin ( q ) , isorhamnetin ( i ) , and kaempferol ( k ) ( figure 8 ) .
this confirmed the observation based on individual peak analysis , that ' pg238 ' samples had high levels of q and i. figure 8c also confirms the extensive variation of k compared to q and i among the populations ( f - test , p - value < 2.2e - 12 ) , with ' tunisia ' having the lowest level of k and ' pg2020 ' having the largest within - population variation .
however , it was noted that k , exhibiting complex chromatographic behavior , was not differentiated from its isomeric flavone luteolin using this coarse - level quantification .
figure 8 peak aggregation analysis of ( a ) quercetin ([ m + h ]+ , 303.0499 m / z , 15 peaks ) ; ( b ) isorhamnetin ([ m + h ]+ , 317.0656 m / z , 15 peaks ) and ( c ) kaempferol ([ m + h ]+ , 287.0550 m / z , 23 peaks ) .
peak aggregation analysis was also performed for cgas , which are represented by peaks cn353.0873 _ 3.84 , cn353.0874 _ 4.06 , cn353.0873 _ 4.20 , and cn353.0875 _ 5.39 and their derivatives ( supplementary data 4 ) .
cgas are abundant in perennial ryegrass which has three isomers ( qawasmeh et al. , 2012 ) .
under this experimental condition three well - formed peaks for cgas ( 353.0867 , calculated m / z , [ m - h ] - ) can be seen among samples .
however , in total 55 peaks of 353.0867 (+/ - 10 ppm ) were detected here due to misalignment from 3.5 to 4.5 min across samples .
peak aggregation analysis of cga ( cn353.0875 ) demonstrates that there is no difference among the 21 populations ( f - test , p - value = 0.93 ). of the four peaks among the top list only cn353.0875 _ 5.39 shows a distinct profile , with the highest level present in ' pg2020 ' and lower or at the baseline noise level among other populations .
the eic data interrogation showed this peak can be sufficiently separated from the other three peaks .
cn353.0875 _ 5.39 is a relatively weak peak but consistently present in ' pg2020 ' genotypes ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
cn353.0875 _ 5.39 , co - eluting with 515.12 , could be annotated as cga glycoside due to the neutral loss of m / z 162 .
perloline , one of the known alkaloids present in the lolium and festuca species , was detected as cp333.1174 _ 5.28 ( fdr adjusted p - value < 0.01 ) , with 18 ppm error from the calculated m / z 333.1234 , [ m + h ]+ , and present as a single chromatographic peak in individual samples .
cp333.1174 _ 5.28 is not on the top 50 significant peaks ( supplementary data 3 ) but among the list of significant peaks based on empirical bayes , suggesting more informative metabolic variation can be mined from the data .
to summarize , plant alkaloids and kaempferol derived flavonoids are notably varied among the 21 populations .
the population - level variation of the - rha and perloline revealed here expands our knowledge on the magnitude of their variation in ryegrass .
a cga glycoside was found to be unique to ' pg2020 ' but cgas were invariant among the populations .
structural variation of sugar moieties in flavonoids may contribute to ryegrass population differentiation .
as examples , k - glc - maglc is most abundant in ' tolosa ' and k - glc - feruloylglc ( supplementary data 5 ) is most abundant in ' samson ,' but both compounds are present at various levels , even down to noise level , in other populations .
as a further note , to assess whether these population - level variations are consistent across seasons and under various environments we have conducted peak validation with samples harvested in a different year ( supplementary data 6 ) .
the results demonstrated two metabolites ( k - glc - maglc and cga glycoside ) identified and annotated in this study were reproducible between two environments indicating the robustness of our statistical data mining procedures .
the magnitude of population - level variation documented here serves as a resource to research how these metabolic variations are associated with high level traits or modulated by genetic regulation. .
discussion high - throughput metabolomics was demonstrated here as an effective tool in screening a diverse collection of plant germplasm for metabolic variation .
however , to make such methods a routine practice in understanding complex traits at the metabolic level , and in searching for genes responsible for the metabolic variation , it is important to acknowledge both the opportunities and limitations of these methods .
addressing peak annotation problems to facilitate biological interpretation many thousands of peaks can be generated from high - throughput lcms platforms .
currently , it is the common practice to use statistical testing and / or machine learning ranking algorithms to identify a smaller set of peaks for closer inspection of their chemical identities .
this practice falls short of the demand to understand metabolism underlying trait expression in plants .
when a large number of statistically significant peaks are identified , peak annotation remains a bottleneck in metabolomics studies ( wishart , 2011 ; cao et al. , 2013 , 2015 ) .
detailed mining and evaluation of chemical features from data , such as isotopic patterns , adduct ions , in - source fragmentation patterns , and co - eluting behavior must be undertaken for peak annotation , and it is still challenging to automate such complex annotation processes .
database searching is often used for annotation but , in our experience , this is more effective for modular molecules such as lipids ( cao et al. , 2013 ) .
for small metabolites we have to collect more annotation features including tandem mass spectra ( ms2 ) of targeted ions or predicted retention time , to arrive at msi ( metabolomics standard initiative ) level 2 identification ( sumner et al. , 2007 ) .
an unexpected list of metabolites under a particular biological context is usually found , indicating that the extent of our picture of cellular metabolism is incomplete ( patti et al. , 2012 ) .
the long list of unknown peaks of biological relevance strongly suggest more effort needs to be invested into " peakomics " before the full value of metabolomics can be realized .
peakomics should aim to understand the massive number of peaks generated from lcms data , to devise a set of algorithms to integrate chemical features that can be mined from the data , and to draw associations of the mined chemical features with known metabolites .
in this study , along with the data processing pipelines we maintained a peak annotation table for chemical features , and built a spectral database in text format to enable quick evaluation of peak identity in future studies .
although we handle isotopic peaks effectively , we need to improve our grouping algorithms to handle co - eluting peaks and to tackle peak deconvolution in high throughput lcms .
batch effect is perhaps the largest source of variation in metabolomics and analytical chemistry .
much research has been done on normalizing such systematic biases , but the aim has been exclusively to normalize peak intensity .
as we have shown here mis - alignment across a large number of batches can lead to enormous uncertainty in peak identity .
peak identification and quantification are two sides of the same coin - wrong assignment of peaks can lead to a spurious list of significant peaks .
although we have approached the use of the predicted retention time for peak annotation ( cao et al. , 2015 ) , its reliable use in peak annotation can still be challenging in multi - batch lcms experiments ( abate - pella et al. , 2015 ) .
there are no universal algorithms that can address all the problems .
we have proposed and used peak aggregation analysis as a compromise approach .
different platform offers different level of resolution in metabolite identification .
once again taking the - rha as an example , it is routinely identified by dims as nominal or accurate mass , by hillic - ms as a single peak ( cao et al. , 2015 ) and by c18 lcms as two isobaric metabolites .
as for the metabotyping purpose further studies need to be conducted to evaluate how quantification can be compared across platforms and what level of details are required .
when quantification of isobaric metabolites is of a critical task in metabotyping dedicated algorithms should be developed to properly group isomeric peaks across batches based on eic data .
some directions for this development may include using prior knowledge to group peaks if the number of isomeric peaks is known , as in the case for the - rha .
in addition , if ms2 data are available to support two peaks with wide retention time variation being the same metabolite ( cao et al. , 2013 ) , such information can be exploited to improve peak alignment .
finally , statistical modeling of eic data may suggest the number of isomeric peaks that can be assigned with confidence .
only with accurate identification the quantification of isobaric metabolites can be ensured , then research into their biological regulation can be proceeded .
metabotyping offers new opportunities to characterize complex traits phenotypic evaluation of the collected germplasm is a prerequisite for germplasm prioritization or breeding program design but it is not straightforward and often indirect .
metabotyping , dissecting a phenotype at the metabolic level , potentially enables more precise evaluation of forage quality traits than those of traditionally used assessments such as fiber content , metabolizable energy , etc .
on the other hand , metabolites themselves may form the end phenotype which could be directly selected for .
for example , the presence of defense compounds may be used to select for disease resistance .
the diversity of alkaloids and flavonoids is well understood in plants ( harborne , 1977 ) .
alkaloids are believed to function in plant defense ( ziegler and facchini , 2008 ) and flavonoids play a role in plant adaptation to the environment ( mouradov and spangenberg , 2014 ) .
our results showed that flavonoids and their derivatives are diverse among ryegrass populations and seem to be adaptive to local environments , which suggests this class of compounds is potentially responsive to selection .
greater understanding of the genetic regulation of this class of compounds in ryegrass will be our next step .
fortunately , we can learn from model species where the genetic control of flavonoids has been well documented , especially with the aid of metabolomics and genomics platforms ( saito et al. , 2013 ) .
it becomes clear that genes are involved not only in the formation of aglycone structures but also their subsequent modifications .
extensive flavonoid variation was uncovered in the ryegrass populations , and the variation lies not only in the type of aglycones but also in sugar modifications .
this provides information that will enable us to explore new frontiers in developing our understanding of the genetic basis of their regulation in ryegrass .
first , we will need to draw associations between this class of compounds and higher level traits , e.g. , in maize , the c - glycosyl flavones maysin and apimaysin are involved in corn earworm resistance ( mcmullen et al. , 1998 ) .
second , we can design experiments to research the genetic basis ( of qualitative or quantitative nature ) of a set of flavonoids and alkaloids in ryegrass that were revealed in this study .
third , we can specifically look into the function of acetylated / malonylated / feruloylated flavonols in ryegrass , as these decorated flavonoid glucosides have been shown to facilitate the transportation and accumulation of flavonoids in cellular compartments ( zhao et al. , 2011 ) .
the - rha , as a metabolic trait , is subjected to genetic control in l. perenne with a strong qtl ( quantitative trait locus ) located in the linkage group 4 ( koulman et al. , 2009 ) .
although structurally elucidated its relation to high level traits such as pasture persistence remains unknown .
perloline also exhibits broad variation among the 23 populations ( supplementary figure 5 ) , and in contrast , functions of this alkaloid were reported in literature intraspecific differences were observed earlier by butler ( 1962 ) ; and a few major genes were reported to contribute to perloline heritability ( buckner et al. , 1973 ) .
because of its inhibitory effect on ruminal digestion developing low perloline forage has long been a breeding goal ( cornelius et al. , 1974 ) .
metabotyping a wide range of germplasm , therefore , may offer new opportunities to identify materials for developing low - perloline populations .
phenotypic characterization often remains simplistic and the main bottleneck to understanding the genetic basis of traits ( myles et al. , 2009 ) .
metabotyping was demonstrated as an effective tool for us to understand metabolic variation within and between ryegrass populations , and may serve as a bridge to understanding the manifestation of economically important traits ( cao et al. , 2012 ) .
a combined use of high throughput genotyping and metabotyping should provide a new avenue for us to discover novel associations between allele frequency and metabolic variation in ryegrass populations .
such integration will enable us to conduct targeted molecular breeding of the metabolites that contribute to the adaptive or nutritive value of forage species .
materials and methods plant materials twenty - three populations were selected from a large collection of breeding lines , cultivars and wild ecotypes , which was designed for genetic association mapping .
in this paper we refer to cultivars , breeding lines or ecotypes as populations , and each individual plants from population as genotypes due to the nature of high heterozygosity in perennial ryegrass .
these 23 populations were selected to ensure that more than three genotypes were included from each population and five clonal replicates of each genotypes were available for population - level analysis .
in total 233 genotypes from these populations were selected for this investigation ( supplementary table 1 ) .
seeds of all ryegrass material were treated by heat and fungicide to ensure that they were endophyte - free .
all plants were grown in pots and placed outdoors at agresearch grasslands research centre , palmerston north , new zealand .
metabolomic assay and data analysis pipeline plants were harvested after 3 weeks regrowth ( to mimic rotation grazing ) by cutting all the tissues 4 cm above the pot surface , predominantly consisting of the leaf blades .
samples in this study were harvested in may 2012 , late autumn in new zealand .
control samples were derived from a bulk sample consisting of a collection of ryegrass materials that may contain endophyte .
these control samples were formed to monitor systematic variations such as run order effect and batch effect .
sample preparation and metabolomics lab analyses followed protocols previously reported ( fraser et al. , 2014 ) .
briefly , ground plant material ( 50 mg ) was extracted in 50:50 acetonitrile - water ( v / v ) , and analyzed by rp lc - ms via a thermo exactive mass spectrometer ( q - exactive ms , thermo , waltham , ma , usa ) with esi .
rp lc - ms analysis was performed using an agilent rrhd sb - c18 column ( 150 mm x 2.1 mm , 1.8 mum ) with a gradient elution of water containing 0.1 % formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid at a 400 mul / min flow rate .
samples were run in both positive and negative ionization mode as separate chromatographic runs .
ms data were collected in profile mode over the mass range of m / z 60 - 1200 .
the large number of biological samples had to be assayed in multiple batches .
the biological samples ( supplementary table 1 ) selected for this investigation were run in 36 randomized batches over 9 months .
data files generated from all the genotypes discussed above , and control samples from each batch , were subjected to data analysis .
in total , 1,260 data files ( plus 71 controls ) in positive ionization mode and 1,297 data files ( plus 80 controls ) in negative ionization mode , were analyzed .
the profile ( positive and negative ionization ) mode data were converted into centroid mode using proteowizard tools ( holman et al. , 2014 ) .
peak detection , alignment , grouping and missing value filling procedures were conducted using the xcms package ( smith et al. , 2006 ) with key parameter settings as follows : peak detection was carried out on the centroid data using the " centwave " algorithm with peakwidth = 3:15 and ppm = 20 ; peak alignment was undertaken using the " obiwarp " method with default parameters and ; peaks were grouped using the density - based approach .
the resulting peak intensity tables were de - isotoped by camera ( kuhl et al. , 2012 ) and using our in - house peak de - isotoping procedures .
our de - isotoping of peak groups ([ m ] , [ m + 1 ] , [ m + 2 ]) was implemented as follows : the ion series of the peak group must be within +/ - 20 ppm m / z window and eluting at approximately the same retention time (+/ - 0.2 min ) ; in addition , the peak intensity of the group must be highly correlated ( pearson 's correlation coefficient r > 0.9 ) among all the samples , and the ratios of the detected peak intensities must satisfy the criteria : [ m ]/[ m + 1 ] > 2 and [ m + 1 ]/[ m + 2 ] > 2 .
software is available from https :// github.com / agresearch / peakomics .
only the monoisotopic ion [ m ] of the series was retained for subsequent data analysis .
batch effect was corrected using a parametric empirical bayes methods ( johnson et al. , 2007 ) using batch as a covariate .
additional filtering ( f - test , p - values < 0.05 ) was further used to remove peaks still with the significant batch effect .
among the replicates ( n = 5 ) , the most varied replicated groups were identified ( cv > 0.2 ) .
the outliers were removed within the replicated groups if the modified z - scores were > 3.0 , where modified z - score is defined as zi = 0.6745 *[ xi - median ( x )]/ mad ( x ) and where mad is the median of absolute deviation ( iglewicz and hoaglin , 1993 ) .
invariant peaks among the ryegrass populations ( kruskal test , p - value > 0.05 ) were also removed .
various statistical procedures such as pca , clustering analysis , ranking algorithms were employed to extract information in each data - mining step in results .
metabolite annotation after two de - isotoping procedures ( camera method , and our in - house method ) a peak annotation table ( including detected m / z , rt , m / z range , rt range , adduct , isotopic peaks of each peak ) was created for annotation purposes throughout the study .
different annotation strategies were used for different classes of compounds .
for flavonoid glycosides , in - source fragmentation patterns usually provide sufficient information for the annotation ( von roepenack - lahaye et al. , 2004 ; abranko et al. , 2011 ; pinheiro and justino , 2012 ) .
in this study , annotation is performed on the aglycone types and the type and number of sugar moieties , but not on the glycosylation position nor inter - glycosidic linkages in glycan moieties .
for other small metabolites such as plant alkaloids , we exploit data on the accurate mass , expected retention time , formula prediction and matched isotopic patterns for the annotation as detailed previously ( cao et al. , 2015 ) along with published results .
the spectral data supporting all the annotated metabolites mentioned in this publication were provided as a nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) msp library and are available from https :// github.com / agresearch / peakomics .

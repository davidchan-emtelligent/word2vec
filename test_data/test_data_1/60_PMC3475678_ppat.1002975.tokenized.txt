during antagonistic coevolution between viruses and their hosts , viruses have a major advantage by evolving more rapidly .
nevertheless , viruses and their hosts coexist and have coevolved , although the processes remain largely unknown .
we previously identified tm - 1 that confers resistance to tomato mosaic virus ( tomv ) , and revealed that it encodes a protein that binds tomv replication proteins and inhibits rna replication .
tm - 1 was introgressed from a wild tomato species solanum habrochaites into the cultivated tomato species solanum lycopersicum .
in this study , we analyzed tm - 1 alleles in s. habrochaites .
although most part of this gene was under purifying selection , a cluster of nonsynonymous substitutions in a small region important for inhibitory activity was identified , suggesting that the region is under positive selection .
we then examined the resistance of s. habrochaites plants to tomv .
approximately 60 % of 149 individuals from 24 accessions were resistant to tomv , while the others accumulated detectable levels of coat protein after inoculation .
unexpectedly , many s. habrochaites plants were observed in which even multiplication of the tm - 1 - resistance - breaking tomv mutant lt1 was inhibited .
an amino acid change in the positively selected region of the tm - 1 protein was responsible for the inhibition of lt1 multiplication .
this amino acid change allowed tm - 1 to bind lt1 replication proteins without losing the ability to bind replication proteins of wild - type tomv .
the antiviral spectra and biochemical properties suggest that tm - 1 has evolved by changing the strengths of its inhibitory activity rather than diversifying the recognition spectra .
in the lt1 - resistant s. habrochaites plants inoculated with lt1 , mutant viruses emerged whose multiplication was not inhibited by the tm - 1 allele that confers resistance to lt1 .
however , the resistance - breaking mutants were less competitive than the parental strains in the absence of tm - 1 .
based on these results , we discuss possible coevolutionary processes of tomv and tm - 1 .
author summary viruses rapidly evolve and adapt to their host organisms , and the evolutionary processes can be reproduced in the laboratory ( experimental evolution ) .
in contrast , cellular organisms ( that can be viral hosts ) evolve much more slowly than viruses , but the fact that they have antiviral systems suggests that viruses and their hosts have coevolved .
to explore the coevolutionary histories of viruses and their hosts , we focused on tm - 1 , a solanum habrochaites gene that confers resistance to tomato mosaic virus ( tomv ) .
based on analyses of the tm - 1 gene sequences in s. habrochaites , we demonstrated that a part of the gene has been under positive selection .
biochemical studies suggested that tm - 1 has evolved to strengthen its inhibitory activity rather than to diversify recognition spectra .
in addition , experimental evolution analyses suggested that overcoming the tm - 1 - mediated resistance by tomv is associated with fitness costs .
based on these results , we discuss how tomv and the plant resistance gene have coevolved .

introduction because viral diseases often prevent plant reproduction , viruses affect the fitness of their host plants .
to counter viruses , plants have developed defense systems such as gene - for - gene resistance and rna silencing [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
viruses need to evade recognition by resistance genes and encode suppressors of rna silencing for successful infection .
this suggests that viruses and host plants have coevolved , although the processes remain largely unknown .
tobacco mosaic virus , tomato mosaic virus ( tomv ) , tobacco mild green mosaic virus ( tmgmv ) , and pepper mild mottle virus ( pmmov ) are positive - strand rna viruses belonging to the genus tobamovirus .
the tobamovirus genome encodes at least four proteins , namely , the 130k protein , the 180k protein ( translational read - through product of the 130k protein ) , the 30k protein , and the coat protein ( cp ) ( figure 1 ) .
the 130k and 180k proteins are involved in rna replication [ 6 ] and are collectively referred to here as replication proteins .
the 130k protein is a multifunctional protein that interacts with many host proteins [ 7 ] , as well as small rna duplexes to function as a suppressor of rna silencing [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
the 30k protein is required for cell - to - cell movement [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
the cp is the only structural protein and required for systemic spread of the virus [ 13 ] .

positions of amino acid residue changes in tm - 1 - resistance - breaking mutants are shown .
amino acid residues identical to tomv - l are indicated by dots .
lt1 and t21 are tm - 1gcr237 - breaking mutants [ 20 ] , [ 28 ] and tlile is a tm - 1gcr26 - sensitive mutant [ 30 ] , [ 50 ] .
lt1e979k and lt1d1097y were characterized in this study .
mt : methyltransferase domain , hel : helicase domain , pol : rna - dependent rna polymerase domain , cp : coat protein .
several genes that confer resistance to tobamoviruses have been cloned , e.g. , the n gene of tobacco [ 14 ] , the tm - 1 gene of tomato [ 15 ] , the tm - 2 gene alleles of tomato [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , and the l gene alleles of pepper [ 18 ] .
one of viral proteins is a determinant for resistance by each resistance gene ; the 130k protein for n and tm - 1 [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] , the 30k protein for tm - 2 [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , and cp for l [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] .
the frequency of emergence of resistance - breaking mutants varies from one resistance gene to another .
for example , n and the tm - 22 allele of the tm - 2 locus are durable , while mutant viruses easily overcome the resistance by tm - 1 , the tm - 2 allele of the tm - 2 locus , and the l alleles .
the resistance genes that are easily overcome may have evolved more rapidly , and thus they can be good targets of studying coevolutionary processes .
the tm - 1 gene was introgressed from a wild tomato ( solanum habrochaites s. knapp & d.m. spooner ) into tomato ( solanum lycopersicum l. ) cultivars [ 27 ] .
it encodes a protein that binds to tomv replication proteins and inhibits rna replication [ 15 ] .
tomv isolates that overcome the resistance conferred by tm - 1 have mutations in the replication protein - coding region [ 20 ] , [ 28 ] ( figure 1 ) .
a resistance - breaking mutant lt1 has replication proteins that do not bind the tm - 1 protein [ 15 ] , suggesting that tomv overcame tm - 1 resistance by escaping the inhibitory interaction of its replication proteins with tm - 1 .
in the recently reported three - dimensional structure of the helicase domain of tomv replication proteins , the residues involved in breaking the resistance are exposed to the surface of the molecule and locate in close spatial proximity [ 29 ] , where tm - 1 likely binds .
translation product from a splicing variant of the tm - 1 mrna that lacks the second exon did not inhibit in vitro tomv rna replication , which indicates that a region in the tm - 1 protein encoded by the alternative exon is important for the inhibitory activity [ 15 ] .
tm - 1 homologs are widely conserved not only among plants , but also in fungi , bacteria , and archaea , suggesting that the tm - 1 protein has a primary function other than tomv resistance and incidentally acquired the ability to bind tomv replication proteins .
the tomv - susceptible tomato cultivar gcr26 has a tm - 1 allele , tm - 1gcr26 .
the amino acid sequence of the tm - 1gcr26 protein shows 97 % identity with tm - 1gcr237 , the product of the tm - 1 gene from the tomv - resistant tomato cultivar gcr237 [ 15 ] .
the tm - 1gcr26 protein does not bind the replication proteins or inhibit rna replication of wild - type tomv ( l - strain ) or lt1 [ 15 ] .
however , tm - 1gcr26 does bind the replication proteins and inhibit the multiplication of tobamoviruses that cannot infect tomato , namely , tmgmv , pmmov , and the tomv mutant tlile in which the glutamine residue at position 979 of the replication proteins is replaced by an isoleucine residue [ 30 ] ( figure 1 ) .
tlile , tmgmv , and pmmov multiplication is also inhibited by tm - 1gcr237 , indicating that tm - 1gcr26 and tm - 1gcr237 have overlapping antiviral spectra [ 30 ] .
since most virus resistance genes are derived from wild relatives of the crops , studying the interactions between viruses and wild plants may elucidate the coevolutionary histories of viruses and plants .
however , most molecular biological studies on plant resistance to viruses have been performed using crops or model plant species [ 31 ] .
in this study , we analyzed tomv resistance in s. habrochaites and show that a small part of the tm - 1 gene has been under positive selection .
we further identified a tm - 1 allele that inhibits lt1 multiplication .
on the other hand , evolution of microorganisms and their adaptation to hosts can be analyzed by experimental evolutionary methods in the laboratory [ 32 ] .
in our experiments , tomv mutants emerged that could overcome the lt1 - resistant tm - 1 allele , although the mutants were less competitive than the parental strains in the absence of tm - 1 .
results positive selection in the tm - 1 gene of s. habrochaites to analyze the tm - 1 gene of s. habrochaites , we obtained seeds of 24 s. habrochaites accessions from the germplasm resources information network ( grin ) .
all accessions were collected in south america ( peru , ecuador , or venezuela ). from each accession , one plant was randomly chosen and the tm - 1 cdna was sequenced .
in the obtained 48 sequences , a significant negative correlation was observed between linkage disequilibrium ( r2 ) and distance between sites in the sequences ( r = - 0.2975 , p < 0.001 ) , suggestive of intragenic recombination between alleles .
since this result indicated that the samples were not amenable for phylogenetic analyses , we used omegamap [ 33 ] to analyze whether the evidence of natural selection is detected from the sequences in the presence of recombination .
remarkably , positive selection ( omega = ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous / synonymous substitutions > 1 ) was detected in a small region while most of the other parts of the gene were under purifying selection ( omega < 1 ) ( figure 2 ) .
an interdomain region ( residues 432 - 483 , predicted by ncbi conserved domain database [ 34 ]) likely evolved neutrally ( omega = 1 ) ( figure 2 ) .
the posterior probability of positive selection is > 95 % at residues 79 - 112 .
consistently , tajima 's d , a test of neutral evolution [ 35 ] , was significantly high ( p < 0.001 ) in the positively selected region based on a sliding window analysis ( figure 2c ) , also indicating that the region has not evolved neutrally .
importantly , the region is located in the alternative exon ( encoding amino acids 46 - 263 ) of the tm - 1 gene that is required for inhibitory activity ( figure 2 ) [ 15 ] .

( b ) detection of natural selection in the tm - 1 alleles from s. habrochaites .
the ratio of nonsynonymous / synonymous substitutions ( omega ) in each codon was inferred by omegamap [ 33 ] .
omega > 1 , omega = 1 , and omega < 1 suggest positive selection , neutral evolution , and negative selection , respectively .
the region where posterior probability of positive selection ( omega > 1 ) exceeds 95 % is indicated ( from 79th to 112th codon ) .

the confidence limits of d for neutral evolution [ 35 ] are shown as dashed lines .
tomv resistance in s. habrochaites we next examined the tomv resistance of 149 s. habrochaites plants from the 24 accessions by mechanically inoculating tomv - l onto leaves .
the accumulation of cp in the inoculated leaves was examined by sds - page , followed by coomassie blue staining at 7 or 8 days postinoculation ( dpi ) .
since s. habrochaites plants are self - incompatible , the accessions would not be genetically uniform .
indeed , in some accessions , both tomv - resistant ( cp undetectable ) and - susceptible ( cp detectable ) plants were found ( table 1 ). of the 149 plants tested , 94 did not accumulate detectable amounts of tomv cp ( table 1 ) .
we then sequenced tm - 1 cdna of randomly chosen five plants that did not accumulate tomv cp ( i.e. , tomv - resistant plants ) and five plants that accumulated tomv cp at high levels ( i.e. , tomv - susceptible plants ) .
the amino acid sequences of the positively selected region were clearly divided into two classes , consistent with their tomv - resistant or - susceptible phenotypes ( figure 3 ) .
in this region , each of the 48 tm - 1 amino acid sequences obtained above was similar to either one of the two groups ( 29 to the resistant type and 19 to the susceptible type ; figure s1 ) .
these results suggest that both types of alleles were maintained by balancing selection .

deduced amino acid sequences of the tm - 1 protein of five tomv - l - resistant and - susceptible s. habrochaites plants from the indicated accessions were aligned .
the positively selected region ( 79 - 112 ) is indicated .
identical amino acid residues to those of tm - 1gcr237 are indicated by dots .

in underlined accessions , more than 70 % of plant individuals did not accumulate detectable amounts of tomv - l cp. in 10 out of the 149 plants , tomv cp accumulated to low but detectable levels ( table 1 ) .
we sequenced the tm - 1 cdna of one such plant ( pi390659 ) and found that the plant is heterozygous for the putative resistant and susceptible alleles .
this result was consistent with a previous report showing that tm - 1 / tm - 1 heterozygous tomato plants often permit delayed tomv cp accumulation [ 36 ] .
lt1 resistance in s. habrochaites to determine whether the tm - 1 gene is responsible for the observed tomv - l resistance , we selected 13 s. habrochaites accessions that contained relatively high proportions of tomv - l - resistant plants ( underlined in table 1 ) and inoculated the tm - 1gcr237 - resistance - breaking tomv mutant lt1 onto 57 young seedlings from these accessions .
for pi126445 and pi390658 , cp accumulation was detected at high levels in three of four lt1 - inoculated plants ( table 2 ) .
note that tm - 1gcr237 originated from pi126445 .
on the other hand , many plants in the other accessions showed only low or undetectable levels of cp accumulation in lt1 - inoculated leaves ( table 2 ) .
this suggests that only a fraction of the tomv - l - resistant s. habrochaites plants , including those in pi126445 , are carriers of tm - 1gcr237 or equivalent genes , and the rest have alternative or additional resistance factor ( s ) that prevent lt1 infection .

emergence of tomv mutants that can multiply in lt1 - resistant s. habrochaites although cp accumulation was undetectable at 8 dpi in approximately 60 % of s. habrochaites plants inoculated with lt1 ( table 2 ) , some of these plants showed disease symptoms at 15 dpi .
in these plants , cp accumulation was observed .
since tm - 1 - mediated resistance is easily overcome by mutations in the region coding for the helicase domain of tomv replication proteins , the lt1 resistance in s. habrochaites may be due to a novel tm - 1 allele and the accumulated viruses may have been resistance - breaking mutants .
to test this hypothesis , we extracted rna from six plants that showed delayed accumulation of cp ( three from pi390516 , one from pi390517 , and two from pi390518 ) , performed rt - pcr to amplify the helicase domain - coding region of tomv , and sequenced .
the sequences obtained from four plants had the same mutation at the key residue to overcome the tm - 1 - mediated resistance ( g3006 in lt1 to a ) .
the 3006th nucleotide of the isolates from the other two plants remained as g , but we identified a mutation in another residue that was also important to break tm - 1 ( g3360 to t ) .
both g3006 - to - a and g3360 - to - t mutations cause amino acid substitutions ( glu979 in lt1 to lys and asp1097 to tyr , respectively ) ( figure 1 ) .
these findings strongly suggest that the observed lt1 resistance in s. habrochaites was conferred by an unidentified tm - 1 allele .
a single amino acid substitution in the tm - 1 protein confers the ability to inhibit lt1 multiplication based on the above results , we sequenced tm - 1 cdna isolated from three lt1 - resistant plants from different accessions ( pi251304 , pi365904 , and pi365906 ) .
deduced amino acid sequences of the tm - 1 proteins of these plants showed differences from that of tm - 1gcr237 at several residues ( figure s2 ) , among which three residues were common in the three lt1 - resistant plants ( ile91 , leu408 , and asn452 of tm - 1gcr237 were changed to thr , phe , and asp , respectively ) .
because ile91 resides within the positively selected region , we speculated that the i91t substitution might be important for the lt1 resistance by tm - 1 .
we further sequenced ile91 - encompassing tm - 1 cdna fragments from an additional five lt1 - resistant plants ( pi247087 , pi251303 , pi390516 , pi390517 , and pi390518 ) and confirmed that they encode thr at position 91 .
to determine whether the thr residue at position 91 is important for lt1 resistance , we prepared transgenic tobacco by - 2 cell lines , which constitutively expressed tm - 1gcr26 protein , tm - 1gcr237 protein , or tm - 1 protein with the i91t substitution ( tm - 1i91t ) .
tomv - lt1 cdna was also mutagenized to encode an e979k ( lt1e979k ) or d1097y ( lt1d1097y ) substitution in the replication proteins to determine whether these mutations are responsible for overcoming the resistance by tm - 1i91t ( figure 1 ) .
a tomv - l mutant that has the same mutations as another tm - 1 - resistance - breaking mutant ( tomv1 - 2 ) [ 28 ] was also constructed and named t21 ( figure 1 ) .
protoplasts isolated from the transgenic by - 2 cells expressing tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t , or non - transgenic by - 2 cells were inoculated with tlile , tomv - l , lt1 , t21 , lt1e979k , or lt1d1097y rna by electroporation , or mock - inoculated , and cp accumulation was analyzed at 20 hours postinoculation ( hpi ) .
in non - transgenic by - 2 cells , the cp of these viruses accumulated to similar levels ( figure 4 ) .
in tm - 1gcr26 - expressing cells , multiplication of tlile was inhibited ( figure 4 ) .
in tm - 1gcr237 - expressing cells , multiplication of tlile and tomv - l was inhibited ( figure 4 ) .
in tm - 1i91t - expressing cells , multiplication of tlile , tomv - l , and lt1 was inhibited ( figure 4 ) .
multiplication of t21 , lt1e979k , and lt1d1097y was not inhibited by any of the tm - 1 variants ( figure 4 ) .
these results indicate that the i91t substitution in the tm - 1 protein confers the ability to inhibit the multiplication of lt1 , while lt1e979k and lt1d1097y emerged in lt1 - resistant s. habrochaites plants by escaping from the i91t - type tm - 1 alleles .
remarkably , sensitivity of tomv mutants to tm - 1 variants was hierarchical ; a virus that was unable to overcome tm - 1gcr26 was also unable to overcome tm - 1gcr237 and tm - 1i91t , and viruses that were unable to overcome tm - 1gcr237 were also unable to overcome tm - 1i91t .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002975.g004 figure 4 tm - 1i91t inhibits the multiplication of lt1 , but not lt1e979k or lt1d1097y .
protoplasts isolated from transgenic by - 2 cells expressing tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t , or non - transgenic by - 2 cells were inoculated with tlile , tomv - l , lt1 , t21 , lt1e979k , or lt1d1097y by electroporation .
at 20 hpi , protoplasts were harvested and coat protein ( cp ) accumulation was analyzed by sds - page and coomassie blue staining .
binding of tomv mutant replication proteins with tm - 1 variants and inhibition of in vitro rna replication tm - 1 inhibits tomv rna replication by binding to the replication proteins [ 15 ] .
therefore , we examined the ability of tm - 1i91t to bind lt1 replication proteins .
flag - tagged tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , and tm - 1i91t proteins were synthesized by in vitro translation using evacuolated tobacco by - 2 protoplast extracts from which membranes were removed by centrifugation ( membrane - depleted byl : mdbyl ) .
the translation mixtures were mixed with mdbyl , in which tlile , tomv - l , lt1 , t21 , lt1e979k , or lt1d1097y rna was translated or mock - translated , and immunoprecipitation using anti - flag antibody - conjugated agarose was performed .
as expected , the lt1 , tlile , and tomv - l replication proteins coprecipitated with tm - 1i91t - flag , while the lt1e979k or lt1d1097y replication proteins did not ( figure 5 ) .
also , the replication proteins of tomv mutants whose multiplication was inhibited coprecipitated with the tm - 1 variants ( figure 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002975.g005 figure 5 tm - 1i91t binds lt1 replication proteins , but not lt1e979k or lt1d1097y .
the genomic rna of tlile , tomv - l , lt1 , t21 , lt1e979k , or lt1d1097y were translated in mdbyl ; mixed with mdbyl in which tm - 1gcr26 - flag , tm - 1gcr237 - flag , or tm - 1i91t - flag mrna were translated ; and immunoprecipitated using anti - flag antibody - conjugated agarose .
mock - translation was performed as controls and indicated as no viral rna or no flag rna .
protein samples before ( input ) or after ( ip : anti - flag ) flag purification were analyzed by western blotting using anti - 130k protein or anti - flag antibodies .
positions of the replication proteins ( 130k and 180k proteins ) and flag - tagged tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t proteins are indicated .
we further analyzed the inhibitory effect of tm - 1 proteins on tomv rna replication using an in vitro tomv rna replication system [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
briefly , tomv rna was translated in mdbyl .
tm - 1 proteins were separately synthesized by in vitro translation with mdbyl , mixed with tomv rna - translated mdbyl , and incubated with byl membranes and alpha - 32p - labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates , followed by analysis of 32p - labeled rna .
using this assay , we observed inhibition of rna replication of the tomv derivatives in a pattern consistent with the results of the protoplast experiment ( figure 6 ) .
note that the inhibitory effect of tm - 1gcr26 to tlile rna replication in vitro is weak [ 30 ] .
moreover , the in vitro experiment showed that ( i ) the inhibitory effect of tm - 1 variants is dose - dependent , ( ii ) tlile is more sensitive to tm - 1gcr237 than tomv - l ( figure 6 , lanes 5 - 7 ) , ( iii ) tomv - l is more sensitive to tm - 1i91t than lt1 ( figure 6 , lanes 8 - 10 ) , ( iv ) tm - 1gcr237 and tm - 1i91t inhibit tlile rna replication more strongly than tm - 1gcr26 , and ( v ) tm - 1i91t inhibits tomv - l rna replication more strongly than tm - 1gcr237 ( figure 6 ) .
these results suggest that i91t substitution in the tm - 1 protein strengthens its inhibitory activity enough to inhibit lt1 rna replication , thus extending the antiviral spectrum .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002975.g006 figure 6 inhibition of in vitro rna replication of tomv mutants by tm - 1 variants .
the genomic rna of tlile , tomv - l , lt1 , t21 , lt1e979k , or lt1d1097y and the mrna for tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t proteins were translated in mdbyl .
the translation mixtures of the tm - 1 variants were mixed with the viral rna - translated mixtures , followed by rna replication reaction as described in the materials and methods section .
the amount of added tm - 1 mrna were approximately 9 ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 ) , 42 ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 ) , or 126 ( lanes 4 , 7 , 10 ) times as much as viral rna on a molar basis .
mock - translated mixture was added as a control ( lane 1 ) .
the positions of the genomic rna ( g ) and the replicative form rna ( rf ) are indicated .
asterisks represent the background signals .
fitness costs for tomv to overcome resistance by tm - 1 alleles the observed hierarchical tomv - tm - 1 interactions predict that lt1 or other resistance - breaking mutants should have emerged and dominated tm - 1 - sensitive viruses in nature .
however , many field isolates of tomv from tomato are tm - 1gcr237 - sensitive , although resistance by this gene was broken within a year of its introduction to commercial tomato cultivars in 1960s [ 39 ] .
thus , resistance - breaking mutants may have lower fitness than the wild - type in the absence of tm - 1 .
in fact , previous studies reported that a series of spontaneously isolated or nitrous acid - induced tomv mutants capable of overcoming tm - 1 ( but not a field isolate ) multiplied to lower levels and caused milder symptoms than wild - type virus in nonresistant tm - 1 tomato [ 40 ] .
also , a tmgmv mutant that can overcome resistance by tm - 1gcr26 ( tmgmv - t894m,f970y ) had a compromised ability to suppress rna silencing , an antiviral defense system of plants [ 41 ] .
although cp accumulation levels were not significantly different among the tomv derivatives when they were individually inoculated into non - transgenic by2 protoplasts ( figure 4 ) , we examined the relative fitness between the tomv derivatives by co - inoculation of by2 protoplasts with a 1:1 mixture of two tomv derivative rnas .
as we had six tomv derivatives , 15 combinations were tested .
as a control , individual derivative rnas were separately inoculated and the protoplasts were cocultured .
at 20 hpi , rna was extracted from the protoplasts and rt - pcr - amplified cdna fragments of progeny viruses were sequenced by gs - flx titanium ( roche , basel , switzerland ) .
the ratio of the two strains in the progeny of the co - inoculation experiment was normalized to the control ( individual ) infection , and dominance by one of the two strains was examined using a chi - square test ( table s1 ) .
lt1d1097y was less competitive than the other five variants , as was t21 ( excluding lt1d1097y ) ( figure 7a ) .
having amino acid substitutions at the same residue ( d1097v for t21 and d1097y for lt1d1097y ; figure 1 ) , the replication proteins of lt1d1097y and t21 would be disadvantageous with regard to multiplication within protoplasts , probably replicating the viral rna .
similarly , lt1 rna accumulation was lower than tlile or tomv - l rna when co - inoculated ( figure 7a ) .
thus , lt1 is less competitive than tomv - l and tlile in the absence of tm - 1 .

( a ) competition of two tomv derivatives in by - 2 protoplasts .
protoplasts isolated from non - transgenic by - 2 cells were co - inoculated with two of the six tomv derivatives used in this study .
as a control , individual derivatives were separately inoculated and the protoplasts were cocultured .
at 20 hpi , rna was extracted , and amplified cdna was sequenced using the gs - flx titanium .
ratios of the viral count ( virus a / virus b ) normalized to the respective control experiment ( individual infection ) are shown .
* : p < 0.05 , ** : p < 0.01 based on a chi - square test for the ratio of the two derivatives in the coinfection experiment against the ratio expected from the control experiment .
a result of each competition is represented twice so that each virus a histogram shows the results of competition against all the other derivatives ( virus b ) .
( b ) competition of lt1e979k with tomv - l or lt1 in tomato plants .
mixtures of viral rna were mechanically inoculated onto the leaves of 16 tomato ( gcr26 : tm - 1 ) plants .
rna was extracted from the inoculated leaves ( il ) and upper non - inoculated leaves ( ul ) at 10 and 42 dpi , respectively .
at least four young leaflets of each co - inoculated plant at 46 dpi were homogenized ; each homogenate was inoculated onto a healthy plant , and rna was extracted from upper non - inoculated leaves at 42 dpi ( passage ) .
rt - pcr - amplified cdna fragments were directly sequenced and the numbers of plants accumulating either both or one of the co - inoculated derivatives are shown .
in contrast , lt1e979k rna accumulated to levels similar to those of tlile , tomv - l , or lt1 when co - inoculated ( figure 7a ) , suggesting that lt1e979k is not at a disadvantage in protoplasts .
thus , we performed co - inoculation experiments of lt1e979k with tomv - l or lt1 to 16 tomato plants ( cv. craigella gcr26 ; tm - 1 / tm - 1 ) .
rnas were purified from the inoculated leaves at 10 dpi and from upper non - inoculated leaves at 42 dpi .
rt - pcr - amplified viral cdna fragments were sequenced to determine whether both of the inoculated strains accumulated or if one strain was eliminated .
in the inoculated leaves , all plants accumulated both of the co - inoculated strains ( figure 7b ) .
in upper non - inoculated leaves , only two ( for tomv - l - lt1e979k ) and 10 ( for lt1 - lt1e979k ) co - inoculated plants showed coinfection , while the remainder of the plants accumulated only one of the strains ( 11:3 for tomv - l : lt1e979k , 5:1 for lt1 : lt1e979k ) ( figure 7b ) .
next , viruses in the young leaves of these 16 co - inoculated plants were reinoculated to uninfected plants .
after the passage , lt1e979k was eliminated in 13 or 12 of 16 inoculated plants in competition with tomv - l or lt1 , respectively ( figure 7b ). from the results , we estimated relative fitness values for tomv - l and lt1 against lt1e979k as 4.31 +/ - 0.05 and 2.43 +/ - 0.07 , respectively ( for details see text s1 and figure s3 ) .
thus , the replication proteins of lt1e979k are likely to have a compromised function required for virus spread in plants .
taken together , the ability to overcome tm - 1gcr237 or tm - 1i91t by tomv is accompanied by pleiotropic fitness costs , i.e. , impaired rna replication in single cells or virus spread in plants .
discussion since viruses cannot multiply without a host cell , they evolve under selective pressure imposed by their hosts .
in contrast , little evidence exists that wild plants coevolved with viruses [ 31 ] .
a notable exception is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eif ) 4e gene in capsicum annuum and other plants [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] .
for potyviruses , a successful interaction between the viral protein vpg and eif4e is required for virus multiplication , and disruption of this interaction results in resistance .
thus , mutations in the eif4e gene that affect the interaction with vpg confer recessive resistance to the corresponding potyviruses .
the loci encoding eif4e are known to be under diversifying selection and each virus evolves so that vpg can bind to eif4e in the corresponding host [ 42 ] .
the presence of multiple eif4e alleles generated by diversifying selection may effectively protect plant populations from potyvirus infection , since viruses that have adapted to a host that harbors an eif4e allele often lose infectivity to plants with other alleles .
in contrast , no information is currently available regarding how dominant virus resistance genes evolve against viruses .
products of dominant resistance genes interact , whether directly or indirectly , with viral factors ( avirulence factors ) for resistance .
resistance - breaking virus mutants emerge by mutations that escape the inhibitory interaction with the resistance factor .
even if mutations occur in dominant resistance loci to generate diversified alleles , most of the alleles would not be useful to counter escaped viruses since gaining the ability to interact with new factor is much more difficult than losing an established interaction .
therefore , diversification may not be equally effective for the evolution of dominant resistance genes as for recessive resistance genes .
in this study , we found that a small region ( residues 79 - 112 ) of the dominant resistance gene tm - 1 has been under positive selection in s. habrochaites ( figure 2 ) .
the positively selected region is important to inhibit tomv rna replication [ 15 ] , and an amino acid substitution in this region ( i91t ) extends the antiviral spectrum ( figure 4 ) .
in addition , the amino acid sequences under positive selection were grouped into two groups corresponding to tomv resistance phenotypes ( figure 3 ) .
these observations suggest that infection by tobamoviruses served as a selective pressure during s. habrochaites evolution .
although little information regarding tomv strains infecting wild s. habrochaites population is currently available , the results of the experimental evolution analyses suggest that tomv easily evolves to escape from the inhibition by tm - 1 alleles .
thus , tomv and the resistance gene tm - 1 have likely coevolved .
we demonstrated that interactions between tomv mutants and tm - 1 variants are hierarchical .
the hierarchical classification may also apply to other tobamoviruses ; the multiplication of tm - 1gcr26 - sensitive tmgmv and pmmov are also inhibited by tm - 1gcr237 [ 30 ] , and a tmgmv mutant that can replicate in the presence of tm - 1gcr26 ( tmgmv - t894m,f970y ) cannot overcome the resistance by tm - 1gcr237 ( k.i. and m.i. , unpublished result ) .
thus , wild - type tmgmv and tmgmv - t894m,f970y are categorized into the tlile class and tomv - l class , respectively ( figure 8 ) .
based on these considerations and the results of in vitro rna replication inhibition by tm - 1 variants , we suggest that the relative strengths of binding to the replication proteins and inhibition of rna replication by each tm - 1 protein variant decreases in the order of tlile , tmgmv > tomv - l , tmgmv - t894m,f970y > lt1 > t21 , lt1e979k , and lt1d1097y ( figure 8 ) .
additionally , for each tomv variant , the binding strengths to the replication proteins and inhibition of rna replication by tm - 1 variants decrease in the order of tm - 1i91t > tm - 1gcr237 > tm - 1gcr26 ( figure 8 ) .
under selective pressure by tobamoviruses , tm - 1 may have modified the strength of its inhibitory activity , but not diversified the recognition spectra .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002975.g008 figure 8 model of the hierarchical interactions between tomv and tm - 1 .
the horizontal axis indicates the insensitivity ( i.e. , weakness of binding to ) of the tobamovirus replication proteins to tm - 1 .
the vertical axis indicates fitness of tobamoviruses in tm - 1 - lacking hosts .
the dashed lines represent thresholds that determine whether viruses can infect plants harboring tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t .
schematic representation of the inhibitory activities of tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , and tm - 1i91t are shown at the bottom. whether tomv - l evolved from a tm - 1 - sensitive prototype remains unknown , although tmgmv evolved to tmgmv - t894m,f970y in the presence of tm - 1gcr26 with apparent fitness costs [ 30 ] , [ 41 ] .
currently , two modes of pathogen - host coevolution have been proposed : an ' arms race ' model in which short - lived alleles are repeatedly fixed in both pathogens and hosts , and a ' trench warfare ' model in which balanced polymorphisms in relevant genes are maintained [ 45 ] - [ 47 ]. with regard to the tomv resistance , the only known function of the tm - 1 gene to date , the resistant alleles in s. habrochaites would be more beneficial than susceptible ones and thus the susceptible alleles could be eliminated in the ' arms race ' model .
however , in this study , we found that 45 of 149 s. habrochaites plants from 24 accessions permit efficient tomv - l multiplication ( table 1 ) , and the positively selected region of 19 of the 48 sequences of tm - 1 cdna have identical or very similar sequences to those of tomv - l - susceptible plants ( figure s1 ) .
although some biases may have resulted from the seed collection and propagation processes , tomv - susceptible s. habrochaites plants should exist to some extent in nature .
considering that the region under positive selection of the putative tomv - l - susceptible tm - 1 alleles have very low amino acid sequence diversity ( figures 3 and s1 ) , the alleles may also be adaptive and maintained by balancing selection .
possible driving forces of balancing selection includes costs of resistance ; i.e. , the tomv - l susceptible allele may be beneficial in particular situations regarding the original function of tm - 1 or show resistance to other ( tobamo ) viruses .
on the other hand , for tomv , overcoming tm - 1 resistance was associated with fitness costs ( figure 7 ) , which may help avoid fixation of the resistance - breaking mutations in the tomv population , especially when the viruses frequently infect tomv - l - susceptible s. habrochaites subpopulations .
taken together , tomv and tm - 1 may have been under a coevolutionary process following a trench warfare - like model .
the above speculation predicts that tm - 1 - sensitive ( tomv - l class ) and resistance - breaking ( lt1 class or higher hierarchy ) tomv strains should coexist in nature .
thus , even if s. habrochaites evolves a new resistance allele that inhibits multiplication of resistance - breaking strains , it may not be very beneficial unless it maintains the ability to inhibit lower hierarchy strains .
this may explain , at least in part , why tm - 1 appears to have evolved to strengthen its inhibitory activity but does not produce diversified alleles that have different antiviral spectra .
such an evolutionary process of a resistance gene and subsequent viral escape would result in hierarchical interactions .
similar hierarchical interactions were observed between tobamoviruses and the l gene alleles of pepper [ 18 ] .
the l gene recognizes the cp of tobamoviruses and elicits defense reactions [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] .
in addition , a recent report showed that the ability of tobamoviruses to overcome l alleles is associated with high fitness costs [ 48 ] .
thus , regardless of the mechanisms of action , coevolutionary processes that we proposed above for tomv and tm - 1 may often occur between viruses and the corresponding dominant resistance genes .
to conclude , we would like to discuss from a practical view .
in the in vitro system , increased amounts of tm - 1 protein enhance the inhibition of tomv rna replication ( figure 6 ) .
in tm - 1 / tm - 1 heterozygous plants , resistance - breaking tomv mutants emerge more frequently than in tm - 1 / tm - 1 homozygous plants [ 36 ] , indicating that the intracellular level of the tm - 1 protein influences durability .
in addition , tm - 1i91t inhibits tomv rna replication more strongly than tm - 1gcr237 ( figure 6 ) .
results of the competition assay suggest that a correlation exists between the level of rna replication inhibition by tm - 1 and fitness costs ( figure 7 ) , i.e. , a higher quality and / or quantity of the tm - 1 protein are associated with increased fitness costs for tomv to overcome the resistance ( figure 8 ) .
thus , one effective strategy to create durable or sustainable tobamovirus - resistant crops would be to identify stronger tm - 1 alleles from genetic resources or create such alleles by mutagenesis and subsequent overexpression of these genes .
materials and methods viruses for inoculation into s. habrochaites , crude leaf homogenates ( 50 mg of leaf tissues in 1 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer , ph 7 ) of tomv - l [ 49 ] or lt1 [ 20 ] infectious transcript - inoculated tomato were mechanically inoculated onto the first or second true leaves .
the infectious cdna clone of tlile [ 50 ] was provided by dr. yuichiro watanabe ( the university of tokyo ) , those of lt1e979k and lt1d1097y were created by site - directed mutagenesis , and that of t21 was created by replacing the region encompassing the mutation sites of ptlw3 [ 49 ] with the rt - pcr - amplified fragment from the genome of l11a237 , a tomv mutant capable of overcoming tm - 1 ( maff260005 , obtained from the nias genebank ) , which has the same mutations as tomv1 - 2 [ 28 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in vitro transcripts synthesized from the infectious clones using an amplicap t7 high yield message maker kit ( cellscript , inc. , madison , wi ) were used for electroporation , in vitro translation / replication , and co - inoculation onto gcr26 leaves .
plants the seeds of s. habrochaites accessions were obtained from grin .
plants were grown at 24degreesc under a 16 - h light / 8 - h dark cycle .
tobacco by - 2 cells were grown , maintained , and transformed as described previously [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
for transformation of by - 2 cells , tm - 1gcr26 - flag , tm - 1gcr237 - flag [ 15 ] , and tm - 1i91t - flag ( created by site - directed mutagenesis from tm - 1gcr237 ) cdna were cloned into the binary vector pbi121 .
analysis of tm - 1 cdna of s. habrochaites rt - pcr was performed using rna extracted from leaves of a randomly chosen individual of each s. habrochaites accession as a template with the following primers : 5 ' - tccattttgaaatctcgattgtaaca - 3 ' and 5 ' - taaagaaagaggtgaagaccataca - 3 ' .
the amplified fragments were sequenced directly as well as after cloning to obtain two sequences from a diploid individual .
some plants showed no polymorphisms in the coding region , which we assumed to be homozygous .
accession numbers of the sequences that were deposited in the ddbj / embl / genbank nucleotide sequence databases are ab713134 - ab713181 .
obtained sequences were analyzed by permute in the omegamap package [ 33 ] to examine a correlation between distance and linkage disequilibrium , and by omegamap [ 33 ] to detect natural selection in the presence of recombination .
omegamap analysis was conducted using 10 randomly chosen orderings of the haplotypes and the following priors : mu = improper inverse , kappa = improper inverse , phi = improper inverse .
for omega , we used inverse distribution with a range of 0.001 - 100 and set the average length of blocks for omega at 30 codons .
for rho , we used inverse distribution with a range of 0.001 - 100 and set the average length of blocks for rho at 80 codons .
the inverse distribution corresponds to a uniform distribution on the log scale .
we assumed that all codons have equal frequencies .
two independent markov chain monte carlo chains were run for 500,000 iterations , with a 25,000 iteration burn - in. upon convergence the two chains were merged to infer omega .
tajima 's d was calculated by dnasp ver .
5.1 [ 53 ] using 120 - bp window slides in steps of 30 bp. although seed propagation processes of each accession would reduce the genetic diversity of the population and could affect the analyses , we considered this effect to be negligible since several alleles from different accessions have identical or very similar sequences , and we sequenced the tm - 1 cdna of only one individual from each accession .
the positively selected region in the tm - 1 cdna of five s. habrochaites plants that did not accumulate tomv - l cp ( i.e. , resistant plants ) and five plants that accumulate tomv - l cp ( i.e. , susceptible plants ) were sequenced as described above .
each of these plants had a single sequence in this region as shown in figure 3 .
protoplast experiments isolation of protoplasts from tobacco by - 2 cells followed by electroporation of viral rna and preparation of mdbyl was performed essentially as described previously [ 38 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 54 ] .
for detection of cp , approximately 5x105 protoplasts were inoculated with 2 microg of tomv genomic rna .
cp accumulation at 20 hpi was examined by sds - page followed by coomassie blue staining .
for the competition assay , approximately 5x105 protoplasts were inoculated with mixtures of genomic rna ( 3 microg each ) from two tomv variants or 6 microg of a single variant .
the protoplasts inoculated with a single variant were mixed with those with another variant and cocultured for 20 hours .
rna was extracted from one - tenth of the inoculated protoplasts and the cdna fragments encompassing the mutation sites were amplified by rt - pcr .
sequencing of the amplified cdna fragment using gs - flx titanium was performed by takara bio inc .
( shiga , japan ) .
immunoprecipitation immunoprecipitation analysis of flag - tagged tm - 1 variants was performed essentially as described previously [ 30 ] .
the protein samples were analyzed by western blotting using anti - tomv replication protein antibody [ 52 ] and anti - flag antibody ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) .
in vitro translation and replication reactions of viral rna messenger rnas for tm - 1gcr26 , tm - 1gcr237 , or tm - 1i91t were synthesized from the plasmids harboring the corresponding cdnas [ 15 ] using the mscript mrna production system ( cellscript , inc. ) .
the messenger rnas ( 64 fmol / microl of reaction mixture ) or tobamovirus rna ( 7.12 fmol / microl of reaction mixture ) were translated in mdbyl - based translation mixtures [ 38 ] , [ 51 ] at 23degreesc for 1 hour .
tobamovirus rna - translated mixtures ( 1 microl ) were mixed with a mock - translated mixture ( 14 microl ) , translation mixture for tm - 1 variants ( 1 microl ) plus mock - translated mixture ( 13 microl ) , translation mixture for tm - 1 variants ( 4.67 microl ) plus mock - translated mixture ( 9.33 microl ) , or 14 microl of translation mixture for tm - 1 variants , and incubated at 23degreesc for 20 minutes .
the mixtures were further incubated with 5 microl of p30 byl ( membrane fraction of byl ) at 15degreesc for 2 hours , followed by incubation with 5 microl of ribonucleoside triphosphate mixture containing [ alpha - 32p ] ctp [ 51 ] at 23degreesc for 1 hour .
the reaction was terminated by phenol extraction , and the rna products were purified and analyzed by electrophoresis in an 8 m urea - 2.4 % polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography .

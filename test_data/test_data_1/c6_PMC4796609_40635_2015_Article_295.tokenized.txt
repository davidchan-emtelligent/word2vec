especially older patients with a prolonged icu stay are often considered to be at high risk for mortality. [ 1 ] however the effect of a prolonged icu los in conjunction with age on long - term survival remained to be specified .
objectives we aimed to report one - year survival of icu patients across different age strata and different los strata .
methods all consecutive patients admitted to the icu of the university medical centre utrecht in the netherlands between july 2009 and april 2013 were included in the study .
for patients with multiple icu admissions we only included their first admission .
data on patient characteristics were prospectively gathered according to apache iv definitions. [ 2 ] survival was tracked using the municipal registry , until one year after icu admission .
patients were grouped according to age and according to los .
note that the los groups were not mutually exclusive .
the ethics committee of the university medical centre utrecht approved the study and gave a waiver of informed consent ( protocol number 10 / 006 ) .
results inclusion and overall survival were shown in figure 1 .
in total , 7165 unique patients were included .
baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 .
one year survival varied markedly , from 82.6 % in patients < 65 years with icu los < 1 week , to 22.2 % in patients > 80 years with icu los > 2 weeks ( figure 2 ) .
in all los strata , increasing age was associated with a decreasing one year survival .
there was also a distinct drop in one year survival when icu los was more than 1 week , in every age category .
however , after the first week in the icu , one year survival stayed nearly consistent in patients of all age categories , irrespective of icu los .

conclusions in icu patients , increasing age was associated higher one year mortality .
however , once the patient has survived more than 2 , 3 and 4 weeks of icu stay respectively , his or her 1 - year survival is comparable to patients who have been at the icu for only more than one week .

objective : this study aims to assess the relationship between body mass index ( bmi ) of children and that of their parents in a nationally - representative sample of iranian population .
methods : this cross - sectional nationwide study was conducted in 2011 - 2012 among 6 - 18 - year - old students and their parents living in 30 provinces of iran .
socio - demographic information was collected .
the bmi values of the children / adolescents were categorized according to the world health organization reference curves .
association between parental and student weight status was examined using ordinal regression models after adjustment for potential confounders .
results : overall , 23043 children and adolescents and one of their parents participated in this study ( 50.7 % boys , 73.4 % urban status ) .
mean age of the subjects was 12.55 +/ - 3.31 years .
mean bmi values of parents and children / adolescents were 27.0 +/ - 4.57 and 18.8 +/ - 4.4 kg / m2 , respectively .
after adjusting for confounders , overweight and / or obesity in students of both genders was found to be significantly associated with parental overweight and / or obesity .
in those students who had obese parents , the odds ratio ( or ) of being obese was 2.79 for boys [ or = 2.79 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci )= 2.44 - 3.20 ] and 3.46 for girls ( or = 3.46 ; 95 % ci = 3.03 - 3.94 ) compared to their peers with normal - weight parents .
boys with overweight parents were 1.7 times more overweight than their counterparts with normal - weight parents ( or = 1.70 ; 95 % ci = 1.15 - 1.92 ) .
similarly , girls who had overweight parents were more overweight compared to those with normal - weight parents ( or = 2.00 ; 95 % ci = 1.77 - 2.25 ) .
conclusion : our findings highlight the importance of the shared family environment as a multi - factorial contributor to the childhood obesity epidemic and the necessity of implementing family - centered preventive programs .
overweight obesity body mass index children and adolescents parents what is already known on this topic ?
parental weight is one of the predictors of obesity in children and adolescents .
there is an association between parental body mass index and child birth weight .
what this study adds ?
children from families with obese parents were at a significantly higher risk of obesity compared to children with normal - weight parents .
overweight and / or obesity in children of both genders was significantly associated with parental overweight and / or obesity .
introduction overweight and obesity in childhood usually track to adulthood .
they are associated with several complications and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality later in life ( 1 ) .
the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries ( 2 ) .
the overweight / obesity prevalence has doubled and tripled in pre - school and primary school - aged children , respectively ( 3 ) .
among developing societies , eastern europe and the middle east have the highest prevalence of childhood overweight ( 4 ) .
in the middle east , a high frequency of overweight and / or obesity was documented in adolescents living in kuwait ( 5 ) and qatar ( 6 ) .
the prevalence of overweight and / or obesity in children and adolescents is on the increase in many developing countries , such as iran ( 7 ) .
in our previous nationwide study , the prevalence rate of general and abdominal obesity in 6 - 18 years iranian students was 11.89 % ( 13.58 % of boys vs. 10.15 % of girls ) and 19.12 % ( 20.41 % of boys vs. 17.79 % of girls ) , respectively ( 8 ) .
excess weight / obesity is a multi - factorial disorder and derives from two different origins , namely , genetic and environmental factors .
however , the relative contributing role of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors to development of obesity is not clear ( 9 ) .
a great number of previous studies have indicated that childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity are linked to obvious familial aggregation , as a result of complex interaction between genetic and environmental effects ( 10,11 ) .
during recent decades , a number of studies have shown the association between parental body mass index ( bmi ) and child birth weight ( 12 ) .
in addition , studies indicate the higher impact of parental bmi on the severity of weight gain from childhood to adolescence ( 13 ) .
parental weight has been shown as an important predictor for obesity development in children and adolescents .
few studies are available regarding the association between parental and child obesity ( 14 ) .
the present study aims to examine the relationship of parental bmi with overweight and obesity in children / adolescents in a nationally representative sample of iranian population .
methods the childhood and adolescence surveillance and prevention of adult noncommunicable disease - iv study was performed in rural and urban regions of 30 provinces of iran in 2011 - 2012 .
the methodology of the study has been published in detail ( 15 ) .
in brief , students were selected from elementary , middle , and high schools by multistage , cluster random sampling method .
stratification was done according to the level of the schools ( elementary , middle , and high school ) and place of residence ( urban , rural ) .
the total child / adolescent sample size was calculated as 25000 students ( 48 clusters of 10 students in each province ) and 23043 students participated in the survey .
trained health care professionals conducted the physical examination under standard protocols by using calibrated instruments .
these professionals were selected from health staff working in the health system in each province ( one person in each province , a total of 30 professionals ) and attended a 3 - day educational workshop on measurement of anthropometric indices according to standard protocols .
weight was measured with the subject in light clothing , to the nearest 0.1 kg. standing height was recorded without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm. bmi was calculated as weight ( kg ) divided by height in square meters ( m2 ) .
bmi categories were defined according to the world health organization ( who ) reference curves for different age and gender groups ( 16 ) .
the subjects were classified as underweight ( bmi < 5th percentile ) , normal weight ( bmi between 5th - 85th percentiles ) , overweight ( bmi between 85th - 95th percentiles ) , and obese ( bmi >= 85th - 95th percentiles ) .
parents were asked to report their weight and height .
parental bmi was calculated as underweight ( bmi < 18.5 ) , normal - weight ( 18.5 < bmi < 24.9 ) , overweight ( bmi >= 25 - 29.9 ) , and obese ( bmi >= 30 ) .
socio - demographic information including parental education and occupation , age of the subject , living area ( urban vs. rural ) , and number of people living in the house were also collected .
statistical analysis all analyses were conducted using survey analysis method in stata software .
categorical and continuous data were presented as numbers ( percentages ) and means standard deviation ( sd ) , respectively .
the weight status of the children / adolescents was analyzed as an ordinal outcome variable .
parental weight status was categorized into four groups ( underweight , normal weight , overweight , and obese ) , which was investigated as an ordinal response variable .
univariate analysis was used to examine the relationship of each independent variable to outcome of interest .
goodman and kruskal 's gamma and pearson 's chi - square statistic were used to determine the association between the weight status and participants' characteristics .
pearson 's correlation test was used to investigate the relationship between continuous variables and bmi values .
a variable univariately associated with the outcome was added to the preliminary multivariate model for the outcome .
ordinal regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) of obesity by parental weight status , adjusted for potential confounders .
these models were tested using a full likelihood ratio test comparing the fitted location model to a model varying location parameters .
hence , separate binomial logistic regressions were run on cumulative dependent variables .
boys and girls were analyzed separately due to gender differences in weight status .
two sets of potential confounders were used in the adjusted models .
model 1 was adjusted for some characteristics of children / adolescents including birth weight , gender , living area , and age .
model 2 was further adjusted for potential predictors which were related to their family such as parental education and occupation , type of house and school , and number of the household .
all the tests were two - sided and the significance level was set as 0.05 .
results in total , 23043 students ( 50.8 % boys ) completed the study .
the mean and sd for age of the subjects was 12.55 ( 3.31 ) years .
overall , 73.4 % of the study participants were from urban areas and 79.4 % of families lived in their private house .
parental mean weight ( sd ) was 70.9 +/ - 13.8 kg and that of the students was 42.50 +/ - 17.0 kg .
17 % of fathers and 9.4 % of mothers had university degrees .
ninety percent ( 90.9 %) of children / adolescents were students of public schools .
about half of fathers ( 44.38 %) were laborers or white collar workers and 88.3 % of the mothers were housewives .
nearly half of families in the study owned personal cars and personal computers .
the basic and demographic characteristics of the study participants are given in table 1 .
since the weight status was statistically significantly different between boys and girls , simple bivariate analyses were performed for boys ( n = 11752 ) and girls ( n = 11364 ) separately .
the prevalence of overweight / obesity was 15.1 % and 65.6 % among the students and the parents , respectively .
mean ( sd ) bmi was18.81 +/ - 4.43 and 27.0 +/ - 4.57 kg / m2 for the children / adolescents and the parents , respectively .
overall , 5.0 % of children / adolescents were categorized as obese , 10.1 % were overweight , and 5.0 % were underweight .
there was an association between children / adolescents' weight and parental weight status ( p < 0.001 for both genders ) .
we found that 0.8 % of boys with underweight parents were overweight or obese .
88.8 % of children / adolescents with overweight parents and 67.0 % of children / adolescents with obese parents were overweight or obese .
table 2 indicates the multivariate regression models for the association and obesity in children / adolescents and parental weight , adjusted for potential confounders .
the analyses were stratified by gender .
the prevalence of obesity was high among parents .
in models 1 - 2 , childhood and / or adolescent obesity was significantly associated with parental obesity in both genders , after adjusting for confounders .
parental overweight increased the odds of obesity among children and adolescents and strong associations were found between overweight and obese parents and the weight of their offspring ( p < 0.05 ) .
boys were 2.79 times more likely to be obese if their parents were obese compared to boys with normal weight parents ( or = 2.79 ; 95 % ci = 2.44 - 3.20 ) .
similarly , girls who had obese parents were more likely to be obese than their peers who had normal - weight parents ( or = 3.46 , 95 % ci = 3.03 - 3.94 ) .
boys with overweight parents were 1.7 times more overweight than their counterparts with normal - weight parents ( or = 1.70 ; 95 % ci = 1.15 - 1.92 ) .
in the same way , girls who had overweight parents were more overweight compared to those with normal weight parents ( or = 2.00 ; 95 % ci = 1.77 - 2.25 ) .
discussion the current study is one of the first of its kind to explore the association of the weight status of a large population - based sample of iranian children with that of their parents at national level .
we found that children from families with obese parents were at a significantly higher risk of obesity compared to children of normal - weight parents .
both genetic and environmental factors contribute to childhood obesity ( 17,18 ) .
some environmental factors including parental overweight , shared family lifestyle , dietary habits , and socio - economic status ( ses ) are linked to childhood overweight ( 7,18,19,20,21 ) .
previous studies have indicated that low ses families have little access to healthy foods ; therefore , their consumption of high - calorie , low nutrient foods is higher than that of high ses groups ( 22,23 ) .
parental education has also been reported to be inversely related to child excess weight and studies have shown a higher prevalence of overweight and / or obesity in children of parents with a low educational level ( 24,25,26 ) .
previous studies across 11 european countries have indicated that low maternal education could yield a substantial risk of early childhood obesity ( 27 ) .
in another study , it was reported that children of better educated mothers had a more favorable growth pattern , namely , lower overweight and obesity rates ( in the uk and sweden ) , and lower stunting and underweight rates ( in rural china ) ( 28 ) .
it seems that maternal education has a more substantial effect on child weight status , because mothers spent a longer time with their children than the fathers and are usually the person who prepares the food ( 27 ) .
also , there is a more direct interaction between the children and their mothers than their fathers ( 29 ) .
the inverse association between parental education and child obesity could possibly affect life - style , dietary intake , as well as the ses position ( 24,25,30 ) .
one of the most important components of family context is parental weight status , which has been reported to be an important predictor of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents ( 14,17,18,30 ) .
however , to date , the potential association with parental weight has not been extensively investigated .
in the current study , obese parents were more likely to have overweight or obese children , compared to normal - weight parents .
these results are consistent with previous studies ( 14,18,30 ) and suggest that parental excess weight has an important role on child bmi .
overweight parents are considered as risk factors for overweight / obesity of their offspring ( 1,31 ) .
the association between overweight children and parental excess weight represents both gene and environment interactions ( 19 ) .
thus , the increasing risk of childhood or adolescent overweight in individuals with obese parents might be due to their genetics or their living in the same environment .
furthermore , children usually imitate their parents .
therefore , eating habits and family lifestyle could have an influence on child eating behavior .
unfavorable parental eating patterns ( including higher consumption of fried , fast foods , sweets ) and a sedentary lifestyle such as low physical activity and prolonged tv and computer time might increase the risk of overweight and obesity in both parents and their children ( 18 ) .
our study is the first national study conducted on a very large sample to determine the association between an overweight status in children and parental weight status .
the study has some limitations which need to be addressed .
as a cross - sectional study , we cannot infer cause and effect relationships , thus the association of parental bmi and child weight status needs to be confirmed in prospective studies .
the other limitation is the self - reported heights and weights of parents , which may have decreased the accuracy of these data .
estimated obesity prevalence in parents might be affected by underreporting of weight due to the social desirability .
however , a number of studies in our community have shown that self - reported anthropometric measurements are reliable ( 32 ) .
our findings also highlight the importance of asking about family history of overweight and / or obesity by family physicians and primary care practitioners to be able to assess the risk of overweight in children .
in conclusion , our findings highlight the importance of the shared family environment as a multi - factorial contributor to the childhood obesity epidemic as well as the necessity of implementing family - centered preventive programs .

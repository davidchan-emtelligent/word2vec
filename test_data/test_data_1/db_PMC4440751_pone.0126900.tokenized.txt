the freshwater shrimp neocaridina heteropoda ( crustacea , malacostraca , decapoda ) originates from asia and is one of the species that is widely available all over the world because it is the most popular shrimp that is bred in aquaria .
the structure and the ultrastructure of the midgut have been described using x - ray microtomography , transmission electron microscopy , light and fluorescence microscopes .
the endodermal region of the alimentary system in n. heteropoda consists of an intestine and a hepatopancreas .
no differences were observed in the structure and ultrastructure of males and females of the shrimp that were examined .
the intestine is a tube - shaped organ and the hepatopancreas is composed of two large diverticles that are divided into the blind - end tubules .
hepatopancreatic tubules have three distinct zones - proximal , medial and distal .
among the epithelial cells of the intestine , two types of cells were distinguished - d and e - cells , while three types of cells were observed in the epithelium of the hepatopancreas - f , b and e - cells .
our studies showed that the regionalization in the activity of cells occurs along the length of the hepatopancreatic tubules .
the role and ultrastructure of all types of epithelial cells are discussed , with the special emphasis on the function of the e - cells , which are the midgut regenerative cells .
additionally , we present the first report on the existence of an intercellular junction that is connected with the e - cells of crustacea .

introduction the tube - shaped digestive system of crustacea opens anteriorly at the mouthparts and posteriorly at the anus .
it is composed of three distinct regions - - the fore - , mid - and hindgut .
while the fore - and hindgut are lined with the cuticle , the midgut is devoid of any sheets on its surface or may be covered with the peritrophic membrane [ 1 ] .
the midgut ( the endodermal region of the digestive system ) in crustacea may be a long tube that is devoid of any diverticles and caeca [ 2 - 4 ] or it may have anterior caeca [ 5 ] .
it can be differentiated into the midgut ( intestine ) and a large lobular gland called the hepatopancreas [ 6 - 8 ] or the midgut may be replaced by a large hepatopancreas [ 6 - 8 ] .
the midgut is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes , absorption , excretion , storage of the reserve material ( organic and inorganic reserves ) , detoxification and nutrient uptake [ 9,10 ] .
however , the hepatopancreas is treated as the organ that is primarily responsible for digestion , the absorption of nutrients , the accumulation of the reserve material and the excretion and detoxification of xenobiotics [ 11,12 ] .
therefore , it is highly sensitive to the physiological and environmental changes that occur in the natural habitats of animals [ 11 ] .
numerous types of cells have been described from among the cells of the midgut epithelium ( e.g. , e - - embryonic cells , f - - fibrillar cells , etc. ) .
however , there are still many controversies connected with the functions of cells that have been described ; some authors seemed to have difficulties in differentiating all of the types of cells .
therefore , in the literature we can still find data that asserts that all of the cells that form the midgut epithelium in crustacea may represent the stages of cell differentiation [ 7,10,13 - 16 ] .
as the material for the study , we used the freshwater shrimp neocaridina heteropoda ( crustacea , malacostraca , decapoda ) , which originates from asia .
however , it is one of the species that is widely available all over the world as it is the most popular shrimp that is bred in aquaria. n. heteropoda is primarily a phytophagous species that eats mostly algae and plant material .
however , it can also feed on the organic matter and microfauna that grows on the leaves of the plants , stones or glass in an aquarium because it is an opportunistic omnivorous species [ 17 ] .
the aims of our studies were : ( a ) to present a 3d localization of the midgut inside the body cavity using x - ray microtomography ; ( b ) to describe the precise ultrastructure of the midgut epithelium ( intestine and hepatopancreas ) in males and females of n. heteropoda ; ( c ) to determine whether regionalization in the epithelium of hepatopancreatic tubules occurs ; ( d ) to describe the process of the secretion of substances and ( e ) to determine whether embryonic cells ( if they exist ) play the role of midgut regenerative cells .
results the midgut of neocaridina heteropoda ( fig 1a ) , which is located on the dorsal side of the body ( s1 video ) , is composed of two distinct parts - - an intestine that is tubular in shape and a large lobular hepatopancreas ( fig 1b and 1c ) .
the following description relates to both males and females as no sexual differences were observed .

the structure and ultrastructure of intestine the intestine of n. heteropoda consists of a simple columnar epithelium that lies on the non - cellular basal lamina ( fig 1d ) .
it is separated from the body cavity by the visceral muscles , which form two layers - - an inner layer of circular muscles and an outer layer of longitudinal muscles .
the epithelium of intestine is composed of two types of cells - - digestive and regenerative cells ( figs 1e and 2a ) .
however , the regenerative cells are only distributed in the anterior part of the intestine ( fig 2a and 2b ) , while the remaining epithelium is composed of only digestive cells ( fig 2c ) .

digestive cells the cytoplasm of the columnar digestive cells shows distinct regionalization in the distribution of organelles - - basal , perinuclear and apical regions can be distinguished ( fig 2b and 2c ) .
the apical membrane forms long microvilli ( fig 2c and 2d ) whose roots , which are made of filaments , enter the apical cytoplasm and form a distinct cortical layer .
the cortical layer is poor in organelles ( fig 2e ) .
the apical cytoplasm just below the cortical layer has numerous cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria , some multivesicular bodies , autophagosomes and vesicles that have an electron - lucent and electron - dense content ( fig 2d ) .
the oval - shaped nucleus contains the euchromatin , which has an electron - medium density ( fig 2b and 2c ) .
the perinuclear region is rich in cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum , golgi complexes , but is poor in mitochondria ( fig 2f and 2g ) .
the basal membrane forms small folds .
many mitochondria , cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and some golgi complexes accumulate in their neighborhood ( fig 2h ) .
the reserve material does not accumulate in the cytoplasm of the digestive cells .
therefore , it is pas - negative , sudan black b - negative and bpb - negative ( fig 3a - 3c ) .
smooth septate junctions can be observed between the cell membranes of the apical regions ( figs 2c and 2d , 6c ) , while septate junctions ( fig 2f and 2g ) and gap junctions ( fig 2i ) occur between the membranes of the perinuclear and basal membranes of the adjacent digestive cells .

regenerative cells oval - shaped regenerative cells are situated between the basal regions of the digestive cells ( figs 1e , 4a and 4b ) and they are distributed only in the anterior part of the intestine ( about ( 1 / 4 ) of the length of the intestine ) ( figs 2a and 2b , 4a ) , while the remaining region is devoid of regenerative cells ( fig 2c ) .
they do not contact the midgut lumen .
the basal membrane does not form any folds and the cytoplasm is poor in organelles during the interphase ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
some mitochondria and cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum are distributed around the large oval - shaped nucleus , which shows a high electron - density and is devoid of any distinct patches of heterochromatin ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
septate junctions were observed between the regenerative and digestive cells .
the regenerative cells undergo mitosis ( fig 4d ) , which was confirmed by the anti - brdu labeling ( fig 5a ) and anti - phosphohistone h3 labeling ( fig 5b ) .
the process of the differentiation of the regenerative cells was not observed .

types of secretion the substances that are produced in the cytoplasm of the digestive cells are released into the midgut lumen due to the apocrine and microapocrine secretion .
at the beginning of apocrine secretion , the apical membrane loses its microvilli and gradually forms an evagination that protrudes into the midgut lumen .
many organelles are shifted into the evagination , which gradually enlarges and eventually the evagination separates from the entire cell into the midgut lumen as a secretory bulge ( figs 1e , 6a and 6b ) .
in the microapocrine secretion , small vesicles filled with an electron - lucent content protrude into the microvilli forming small bulges .
when the bulges enter the apical surface of the microvilli , they are cut and discharged into the intestinal lumen ( fig 6c ) .

the structure and ultrastructure of hepatopancreas the hepatopancreas is a large and lobular organ that is composed of two large diverticles , which are secondarily divided into the blind - end tubules ( fig 1b and 1c ) .
it is lined with the simple columnar epithelium , which rests on the non - cellular basal lamina and is separated from the body cavity by a circular layer of visceral muscles .
each tubule is composed of three distinct regions - - distal , differentiation and proximal ( fig 1e ) .
distal zone of hepatopancreatic tubules the distal region is formed by the regenerative cells = embryonic cells ( figs 1e , 7a and 7b ) .
their basal membrane does not form any folds and the cytoplasm is poor in organelles during the interphase ( fig 7c and 7d ) .
some mitochondria and cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum are distributed around the oval - shaped nucleus which has small patches of the heterochromatin ( fig 7c and 7d ). between the regenerative cells septate junction as the intercellular junctions were observed ( fig 7e ) .
the mitotic divisions of the regenerative cells were confirmed by anti - brdu labeling ( fig 5c ) and anti - phosphohistone h3 labeling ( fig 5d ) .

their nuclei have an oval shape ( fig 8b - 8d ) .
the apical membrane is smooth and does not form any folds or microvilli .
smooth septate junctions and gap junctions can be distinguished between adjacent cells ( fig 8d ) ; however , no septate junctions occurred .
however , sporadic regenerative cells with the cytoplasm that was poor in organelles were observed ( fig 8f ) .

the type i cells ( fibrillar cells ) comprise about 70 % of the epithelial cells .
no regionalization in the distribution of organelles was observed .
the apical membrane forms microvilli whose filaments enter the apical cytoplasm forming a thin cortical layer ( fig 9b and 9c ) .
only single small vesicles with an electron - lucent content and cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes are present in the cortical layer ( fig 9c ) .
a nucleoplasm , which is of a medium electron - density , occupies the oval - shaped nucleus ( fig 9a , 9b and 9f ) .
the entire cytoplasm is abundant in cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum , golgi complexes , but only single mitochondria were present ( fig 9a - 9g ) .
the well - developed rough endoplasmic reticulum was in the form of rounded vesicles of various sizes ( fig 9d and 9e ) .
the basal membrane of these cells forms small folds ( fig 9a and 9f ) .
there was no reserve material in the cytoplasm , which was pas - negative ( fig 3d ) , sudan black b - negative ( fig 3e ) and bpb - negative ( fig 3f ) .
however , it was observed that the type i cells in each tubule gradually change their ultrastructure along the length of the epithelium .
if the distance from the differentiation region of the tubule is longer , the cytoplasm begins to become electron - dense .
simultaneously , autophagosomes appear above the nucleus ( fig 9f and 9g ) .
the number of cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complexes gradually increases together with an enlargement of their dimensions ( fig 10a - 10d ) and the number of mitochondria decreases .

type ii cells ( storage cells ) comprise about 30 % of the epithelial cells .
no regionalization in the distribution of organelles was observed .
the apical cell membrane forms microvilli ( fig 9a - 9c ) , but no distinct cortical layer was distinguished .
the entire cytoplasm is poor in organelles such as cisterns of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum , but it is rich in mitochondria and free ribosomes ( fig 9c and 9d ) .
autophagosomes appear in the apical cytoplasm ( fig 9c ) .
additionally , the reserve material ( fig 9a ) , which is pas - positive ( fig 3d ) , sudan black b - positive ( fig 3e ) , but bpb - negative , accumulates ( fig 3f ) .
type ii cells , like type i cell , gradually change their ultrastructure along the epithelium .
if the distance from the differentiation and distal zones of the tubule is longer , the amount of the reserve material ( fig 10a and 10f ) and cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum ( fig 10e ) increases significantly .
simultaneously , large vacuoles that have an electron - lucent content ( fig 10f and 10g ) and residual bodies such as the remains of the autophagy ( fig 10g ) appear .
the content of these vacuoles can be released into the hepatopancreatic lumen due to apocrine secretion .
smooth septate junctions ( in apical regions ) ( figs 9a - 9c , 10a ) , gap junctions and septate junctions ( below the smooth septate junctions up to the basal cell membrane ) ( fig 9e ) occur between the adjacent cells that form the epithelium of hepatopancreas in its proximal region .
discussion structure and ultrastructure of the midgut the endodermal region ( midgut ) of the digestive system of crustacea forms a tube - shaped organ that is devoid of any diverticula , has anterior caeca , is differentiated into the midgut ( intestine ) and large midgut gland , or the midgut can be replaced by a large hepatopancreas [ 2 - 6,8,18 - 21 ] .
the tube - shaped midgut spreads along the entire length of the body cavity , while the hepatopancreas usually arises ventrally from the anterior margin of the midgut .
the hepatopancreas , which occupies much of the cephalothoracic cavity , is composed of two pairs of blind - ending diverticles or lobes , which are secondarily divided into numerous blind - ended tubules .
however , the number of hepatopancreatic diverticles or lobes can vary among different crustacean species [ 1 ] .
additionally , the hepatopancreatic tubules are subdivided into three distinct zones - - distal , medial and proximal , relative to their distance from the intestine [ 22,23 ] .
the midgut of n. heteropoda shares similarities with the midguts of other species that belong to malacostraca .
it is composed of a tube - shaped intestine and a large lobular hepatopancreas whose tubules are subdivided into distal , medial and proximal zones .
the midgut is lined with an epithelium that rests on the non - cellular basal lamina .
the epithelium of crustacea consists of different cell types - - r - cells ( resorptive ) , b - cells ( blister - like ) , m - cells ( midgut , basal ) , f - cells ( fibrillar ) and e - cells ( embryonic ) .
in some crustaceans , only two types of cells have been detected in endodermal epithelium - - b and s - cells [ 21,24 ] .
each cell type has a specific role in digestion ( table 1 ) [ 3,12,23,25 ] .
in n. heteropoda we have described different types of cells - - digestive and regenerative cells in the intestine and fibrillar , storage and regenerative cells in the hepatopancreatic tubules .

additionally , two types of secretions occur in the digestive cells - - apocrine and microapocrine .
these cells do not participate in the accumulation of the reserve material .
as to their functions , the digestive cells of the intestine in n. heteropoda correspond to f - cells [ 23 ] .
however , the fibrillar cells in the hepatopancreatic tubules have numerous cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum , which gives them a fibrillar appearance , which was not observed in digestive cells of the species examined .
however , the data connected with the ultrastructure of the digestive cells of the intestine in crustaceans are rather general [ 3,4 ] , while this paper describes their precise ultrastructure .
in conclusion , the digestive cells described in n. heteropoda are similar to the digestive cells that have been described for other arthropods , e.g. , insects , myriapods [ 4,35 - 41 ] .
therefore , we called them d - cells ( digestive cells ) ( table 1 ) .
there are still controversies connected with all of the types of cells which form the epithelium of hepatopancreas in crustacea .
their appearance in different zones of hepatopancreatic tubules has been presented in table 1 .
in the case of n. heteropoda , we have described only three types of cells , which we called fibrillar cells ( type i ) , storage cells ( type ii ) and regenerative cells ( e - cells ) .
their ultrastructure suggests that fibrillar cells correspond to f - cells , while storage cells are related to b - cells as they are responsible for the storage of the reserve material [ 22 ] .
f - and b - cells are present only in the proximal zone of the hepatopancreatic tubules .
the distal zone has only e - cells ( embryonic ) , while the medial zone represents a differentiated region in which all cells have the same structure , but they begin to differentiate into f - and b - cells .
however , if the distance from the medial and distal zones of the hepatopancreatic lumen is longer , numerous alterations in the cytoplasm of f - and b - cells occur .
large vacuoles appear in the cytoplasm of the b - cell in n. heteropoda , thus giving this cell the appearance of a b - cell as has been described in many crustaceans [ 22 ] .
however , in the literature , we can also find controversies on the origin of the types of cells described here .
sousa and petriella [ 12 ] stated that f - , r - and b - cells originated independently from e - cells .
correira et al .
[ 7 ] described the differentiation of e - cells into distinct r - and f - cells , while b - cells appear in the proximal zone as cells that have a large vacuole inside .
several studies do not present the differences between these two types of cells [ 10,42 ] .
our studies have shown that in n. heteropoda distinct regionalization in cell activity occurs along the length of the hepatopancreatic tubules .
we distinguished a distal zone with e - cells , a medial zone with some e - cells and differentiating cells and eventually , a proximal zone that has two types of cells - - f and b - cells .
additionally , cells that are at different stages of their activity were found running along the whole length of the proximal zone .
if the cell f or b is closer to the beginning of the hepatopancreatic tubule , it is more active ( e.g. , secretion is observed only in this region ) .
e - cells as midgut regenerative cells embryonic cells ( e - cells ) occur among the cell types in the midgut epithelium of crustaceans that were described above .
e - cells , being able to proliferate and differentiate , correspond to arthropods midgut regenerative cells = midgut stem cells [ 6,14,20,22,31 , 35 - 41 ] .
they have been described as small basal cells that are scattered between the other epithelial cells [ 1,3,12,31,43 ] .
their divisions have been observed in crustaceans in the distal and medial zones , while no mitosis was observed in the proximal zone of the hepatopancreatic tubules [ 22 ] .
however , in some cases mitotic divisions of e - cells were not confirmed [ 3 ] or these cells have not been observed in the midgut epithelium [ 4,15,16,19 ] .
it has been suggested that a short life span causes epithelial degeneration to be rare and therefore the midgut epithelium can survive without regeneration .
additionally , another mechanism , which enables the proper functioning of the midgut epithelium occurs - - the process of autophagy [ 4 ] .
regenerative cells ( e - cells ) in n. heteropoda are present only in the anterior region of the intestine and in the distal and medial zone of the hepatopancreatic tubules .
their mitotic divisions have been confirmed only in the intestine and the distal zone .
according to the literature , we have concluded that they play the role of the midgut regenerative cells that are responsible for epithelial regeneration [ 35 - 41,44,45 ] .
e - cells replace damaged cells of the intestine epithelium and form the distal zone of the hepatopancreatic tubules .
therefore , they should differentiate in all types of hepatopancreatic epithelium [ 3,12,23,28,29,31,46 ] .
the differentiation of e - cells has not been observed in the intestine of n. heteropoda , which may be connected with , e.g. , molting , circadian rhythms or reproduction as has been described for many arthropods [ 35,37,38,41,44,45 ] .
however , this process was detected in the medial zone of hepatopancreatic epithelium where first they have a cubic shape and gradually numerous organelles accumulate in their cytoplasm in the freshwater shrimp that was examined in this study .
while moving into the proximal zone , they achieve the character of f - or b - cells .
therefore , we can conclude that e - cells play the role of midgut regenerative cells = midgut stem cells in crustacea .
our studies have also revealed the presence of intercellular junctions between adjacent e - cells acting as midgut regenerative cells .
septate junctions were detected between e - cells and d - cells in the intestine , between e - cells in the distal zone of hepatopancreatic zone and between e - cells and differentiating cells of the medial zone .
septate junctions are involved in adherens of neighboring cells and they can also form a partial permeability barrier [ 39,40,47 ] .
the existence of intercellular junctions between midgut stem cells or midgut stem cells and midgut epithelial cells in invertebrates has not been studied precisely .
therefore , this is the first report on the existence of intercellular junctions that are connected with the e - cells of crustacea .
conclusions during our studies we found that : ( a ) the endodermal region of the digestive system is composed of an intestine and a hepatopancreas ; ( b ) each tubule of the hepatopancreas shows distinct regionalization with three zones - - distal , medial and proximal ; ( c ) two types of cells form the intestine epithelium - - d - and e - cells ; ( d ) three types of cells form the hepatopancreatic tubules - - e - , f - and b - cells ; ( e ) e - cells play the role of regenerative cells ; ( f ) distinct intercellular junctions appear between e - cells ; ( g ) b - and f - cells are present at different stages of their activity .
material and methods material the studies were performed on adult males and females of the freshwater shrimp neocaridina heteropoda ( crustacea , malacostraca , decapoda ) ( fig 1a ) .
the individuals for the studies were obtained from local shrimp breeders and kept in 30 - liter aquaria in the laboratory ( no specific permissions were required for breeding ) .
the environmental conditions in the aquaria were strictly controlled , i.e. temperature of 24degreesc , ph of 7 and total water hardness of 150d .
the n. heteropoda specimens were fed with food that is produced for freshwater shrimps , which consists of mainly vegetable by - products , algae and fish by - products .
the principles of laboratory animal care were followed , as well as specific national laws where applicable .
methods x - ray computed tomography x - ray microtomography ( xmt ) is a non - destructive , computed - aid visualization technique that employs an electron x - ray conical beam to visualize the internal structures of tissues and organs .
it allows high - resolution morphological and anatomical data to be created in three dimensions in a very fast and non - invasive way without having to cut the material .
the adult specimens of freshwater shrimp were fixed with 2 % trichloromethane ( 2 minutes , 240c ) .
the samples were scanned using an xmt v | tome | x s scanner ( ge sensing & inspection technologies , phoenix | x - ray , wunstorf , germany ) , which is equipped with two x - ray sources - - a 240v / 320w microfocus and a 180v / 15w nanofocus .
the temperature - stabilized 16 '' dxf detector provides superior contrast .
all of the scans were performed using the nanofocus tube and x - ray power lower than the voxel size of the data matrix .
the scanning parameters used during the tests are presented in table 2 .
after scanning , the material was reconstructed using compatible phoenix datos | x 2.0 software .
drishti 2.4 was used to analyze the image of the adult form .

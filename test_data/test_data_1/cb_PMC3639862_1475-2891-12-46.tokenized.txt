background recent knowledge in animals suggests that gut microbial metabolism may affect host metabolism , including appetite regulating hormones .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential effects of a whole grain barley kernel product , rich in intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates ( dietary fibre and resistant starch ) , on markers of metabolism and appetite regulation in healthy subjects .
methods boiled barley kernels ( bk ) or white wheat bread ( wwb ; reference ) were provided as late evening meals to 19 young adults in random order using a cross - over design .
during subsequent ad libitum standardized breakfast and lunch meals ( 10.5 - 16 h ) , blood was collected for analysis of glucose , plasma insulin , adiponectin , ghrelin , glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( gip ) and glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) , serum free fatty acids ( ffa ) and interleukin ( il ) - 6 .
in addition , appetite sensations , voluntary energy intake and breath h2 were determined .
results bk as evening meal increased plasma glp - 1 at fasting ( p < 0.05 ) and during the experimental day ( p < 0.01 ) compared with wwb .
in addition the bk evening meal decreased fasting serum ffa ( p < 0.05 ) and tended to decrease fasting serum il - 6 ( p = 0.06 ) .
at lunch , preceded by bk evening meal , voluntary energy intake was decreased ( p < 0.05 ) when compared to wwb evening meal .
the bk evening meal decreased incremental blood glucose area ( p < 0.01 ) , promoted higher breath h2 ( p < 0.001 ) , maintained adiponectin concentrations ( p < 0.05 ) and reduced perceived hunger ( p < 0.05 ) during 10.5 - 16 h after the meal .
conclusions the results indicate that the bk evening meal , facilitate glucose regulation , increase the release of glp - 1 , reduce subsequent energy intake while at the same time decreasing hunger over 2 subsequent meals , and reduce fasting ffa the subsequent morning , possibly mediated through gut microbial fermentation of the indigestible carbohydrates .
barley dietary fibre glucose tolerance incretins glp - 1 energy intake appetite colonic fermentation metabolic syndrome inflammation background the metabolic syndrome ( mets ) represents a cluster of risk factors identifying subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) and cardio - vascular disease [ 1 ] .
the prevalence of obesity and t2d is increasing globally and the world health organization estimates in 2012 the number of people suffering from t2d worldwide to be 347 million , and that the number of diabetes deaths will increase by two thirds between year 2008 and 2030 [ 2 ] .
the need for preventive strategies is thus urgent .
observational studies have shown that higher intake of whole grain ( wg ) is associated with lower body mass index ( bmi ) [ 3 - 5 ] , improved insulin sensitivity [ 6 ] , reduced risk of t2d [ 7 ] and of premature total and cause - specific death [ 8 ] .
several mechanisms have been discussed as mediators of favorable metabolic outcomes following wg intake , e.g. low gi features , presence of dietary fibre ( df ) per se and / or the presence of df associated bioactive components [ 9 - 12 ] .
it has been hypothesized that dietary factors may affect composition and metabolism of the gut microflora [ 13,14 ] , and a close connection between the microbial composition and inflammatory status has been observed [ 15,16 ] .
consequently , metabolic derangement and also obesity has been described as an endotoxemic inflammatory condition triggered by e.g. high fat feeding [ 17,18 ] .
oligofructose has been shown to increase bifidobacteria in obese mice [ 19 ] , which was accompanied by improved glucose regulation and a reduced inflammatory tonus [ 20,21 ] , indicating a prebiotic mechanism .
less is known about possible colonic mediated effects of df present in wg diets .
a relation between wg intake and improved inflammatory status was reported in a cross - sectional study in healthy subjects [ 22 ] .
in addition , certain wg products , rich in cereal df and resistant starch ( rs ) facilitated blood glucose regulation and improved inflammatory tonus in humans in the perspective from a late evening meal to a standardized breakfast , i.e. in the time frame 10 to 12 h after meal [ 23 ] .
the metabolic benefits has been proposed to be associated with colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates ( df and rs ) [ 24 - 26 ] , and an associated increase in systemic levels of glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) [ 23 ] .
glp - 1 is increasingly being assigned both anti - diabetic and anti - obesogenic features [ 27 - 29 ] , which makes it relevant to perform further studies regarding the possible relation between food derived stimulation of this incretin and effects on metabolic parameters .
the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates in boiled barley kernels ( bk ) consumed in the evening on glycaemia , appetite sensations , appetite regulatory hormones and voluntary food intake , at fasting and in the post - prandial phase following two consecutive meals ( breakfast and lunch ) .
variables determined in blood were glucose , insulin , glp - 1 , glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( gip ) , ghrelin , free fatty acids ( ffa ) , adiponectin and interleukin ( il ) - 6 .
in addition breath hydrogen ( h2 ) excretion was determined as a marker of colonic fermentation .
the breakfast and lunch meals were provided ad libitum , allowing for evaluation of over - night effects on metabolism and appetite regulation in a realistic eating situation .
for this purpose , carbohydrate - equivalent meals , consisting of boiled bk or white wheat bread ( wwb , reference meal ) , were provided as evening meals to healthy subjects , using a randomized cross - over design .
materials and methods subjects nineteen healthy volunteers , 6 men and 13 women aged 24.2 +/ - 1.9 years , with normal body mass indices ( bmi ) ( mean +/ - sd = 22.3 +/ - 2.0 kg / m2 ) participated in the study .
the inclusion criteria were age between 20 - 35 years , bmi between 18 - 25 kg / m2 , non - smoker and no known metabolic disorders or food allergies .
approval of the study was given by the regional ethical review board in lund , sweden ( reference 668 / 2008 ) .
evening test - and reference meals the test - and reference meals were based on 50 g potentially available starch .
bk , test meal ; one portion ( 96.8 g ) of slightly polished , dried barley kernels ( finax , helsingborg , sweden ) was boiled for 20 min in 150 ml water containing 0.25 g nacl .
all water was absorbed into the kernels .
the bk had the appearance of a rice - analogue and was consumed with 250 - 300 ml water .
wwb , reference meal ; the wwb was baked according to a standardized procedure in a home baking machine ( severin model nr. bm 3983 ; menu choice , program 2 [ white bread , 1000 g , quick ( time2:35 )]) .
the bread was made from 540 g of white wheat flour ( kungsornen ab , jarna , sweden ) , 360 g water , 4.8 g dry yeast , 4.8 g nacl .
after cooling , the crust was removed and the bread was sliced and portions ( 119.7 g bread ) were wrapped in aluminum foil , put into plastic bags and stored in a freezer ( - 20degreesc ) .
at the day of consumption the subjects were instructed to thaw the bread at ambient temperature , still wrapped in aluminium foil and in the plastic bag .
the wwb was consumed with 250 - 300 ml water .
ad libitum breakfast and ad libitum lunch the breakfast consisted of commercial , low fibre , high glycemic index white wheat bread ( dollar storfranska , lockarp , malmo , sweden ) , butter ( bregott , arla foods , stockholm , sweden ) and ham .
the sandwiches were cut in small pieces ( 6.5 x 6.5 cm ) , served as double - sandwiches whole or cut diagonally .
the subjects were supposed to choose freely the amount ingested .
the breakfast was served with 300 ml water .
the lunch consisted of swedish hash i.e. fried mix of diced potato , meat and onions ( felix krogarpytt , procordia food ab , eslov , sweden ) .
if ketchup ( felix , procordia food ab , eslov , sweden ) was chosen to be consumed with the hash , the subjects was obliged to maintain the amount of ketchup at both lunch situations .
water was served with the lunch ( 250 ml ) .
study design the design was randomized cross - over .
bk and wwb were included as late evening meals ( 0930 pm ) , separated by approximately 1 week .
each evening meal was consumed twice , meaning that the test subject participated at four separated occasions .
fasting measurements were performed at all four visits and postprandial measurements were performed at two of the visits ( randomly chosen ) , one visit after bk and wwb , respectively .
at the days for postprandial measurements , test subjects were provided ad libitum intake of breakfast and lunch , and physiological test variables were repeatedly measured during the experimental day .
blood glucose , breath h2 , visual analogue scale ( vas ) ratings for subjective appetite ( hunger , satiety and desire to eat ) and samples for measurements of insulin , active ghrelin , total gip , and active glp - 1 were obtained at fasting and 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 210 , 225 , 240 , 255 , 270 , 300 and 330 minutes after commencing the breakfast .
samples for il - 6 and adiponectin were collected at 0 , 60 , 120 , 210 , 270 and 330 minutes and measurements of ffa were performed at time 0 and 210 min .
procedure the subjects were encouraged to standardize their meal pattern and to maintain their regular eating habits during the experimental period .
they were also instructed to avoid alcohol , excessive physical exercise or food rich in df the day prior to the evening test or reference meals .
furthermore , they should not have taken antibiotics or probiotics during the previous 2 week period .
at 0930 pm the evening before each experimental day , the subjects prepared and consumed evening meals in their home .
the wwb was distributed as frozen portions ; and the uncooked bk were provided in portions ready to cook .
the bk meal was prepared according to a detailed written description of the cooking procedure and consumed directly after preparation ( see above evening test and reference meals ) .
after the evening meals , the subjects were fasting until the breakfast was served the subsequent morning at the research department .
the subjects arrived to the department at 0745 am. an intravenous cannula ( bd venflon , becton dickinson ) was inserted into an antecubital vein for blood sampling .
fasting ( f - ) blood samples were collected and appetite and breath h2 registered before the breakfast .
test variables were determined repeatedly in the postprandial period after breakfast and lunch according to time intervals previously stated .
the breakfast was consumed at 0800 am and finished within 15 min .
coffee / tea ( without milk or sugar ) or water ( 200 ml ) were served at 120 min after the breakfast , each subject keeping the same drink throughout the study .
the lunch was served 210 min after commencing the breakfast .
the amounts of breakfast and lunch consumed were registered .
during the experimental days ( 5.5 h ) the subjects were told to maintain a constant , low physical activity , preferably reading or similar .
analysis of nutrient composition in evening meals , breakfast and lunch the test - and reference meals were analysed with respect to total starch [ 30 ] , available starch [ 31 ] , rs [ 32 ] , and df [ 33 ] .
information regarding content of starch and df in evening test - and reference meals is provided in table 1 .
prior to analysis of total - and available starch , and df the products were air dried and milled .
rs was analysed on products as eaten .
available starch in the bk meal was calculated by subtracting rs from total starch , whereas potentially available starch content in the reference wwb and the commercial white wheat breakfast bread was analysed according to holm et. al [ 31 ] .

analysis of physiological variables finger - prick capillary blood samples were taken for determination of blood glucose ( hemocue ( r ) b - glucose , hemocue ab , angelholm , sweden ) .
venous blood was collected for measurement of serum ( s ) ffa and s - il - 6 , and plasma ( p ) adiponectin , p - insulin , p - ghrelin , p - gip and p - glp - 1 .
milliplex ( tm ) map ( hmh - 34k milliplex ( tm ) map , millipore , st.charles , usa ) analyses were performed for simultaneous measurement of insulin , active ghrelin , total gip , and active glp - 1 .
blood collecting tubes for analysis with milliplex ( tm ) map were added with an inhibition cocktail consisting of dppiv - inhibitor ( 10 mul / ml blood ) ( millipore , st charles , usa ) and pefablock sc ( 1 mg / ml blood ) ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) prior to blood sampling .
tubes containing inhibition cocktail were kept cold for maximum 6 days until blood sampling .
after blood collection the tubes intended for milliplex ( tm ) map analyses were centrifuged within 30 minutes at 1000 x g for 10 minutes in 4degreesc .
the plasma was removed and immediately stored ( - 20degreesc ) in eppendorf - tubes until analysis .
the blood samples were analysed using immunoassays on the surface of fluorescently labelled microsphere beads and read on the luminex 200 instrument ( luminex corporation , usa ) .
milliplex ( tm ) analyst v.3.4 ( vigenetech inc. , carlisle , usa ) was used for the evaluation of the results .
plasma and serum for analysis of ffa , il - 6 and adiponectin were allowed to clot in ambient temperature ( serum ) or kept on ice and centrifuged within 30 minutes ( plasma ) .
samples were separated ( 3500 rpm for 10 min in 4degreesc ) and stored in a freezer ( - 20degreesc ) until analysed .
ffa concentrations were determined with an enzymatic colorimetric method ( nefa c , acs - acod method , wako chemicals gmbh , germany ) .
il - 6 was determined with a high sensitivity solid - phase immunoassay kit ( r & d systems inc , minneapolis , usa ) .
adiponectin concentrations were measured with a solid phase 2 - site enzyme immunoassay kit ( mercodia adiponectin elisa , mercodia , uppsala , sweden ) .
hydrogen in expired air was measured as an indicator of colonic fermentation using an ec 60 or gastro + ( bedfont ec60 gastrolyzer , rochester , england ) .
calculations and statistical methods data are expressed as means +/ - sem .
the incremental area - and area under the curve ( iauc and auc , respectively ) was calculated for each subject and test meal , using the trapezoid model .
iauc or auc were used in the statistical evaluation of results regarding blood glucose , insulin , glp - 1 , gip , ghrelin and appetite .
incremental peak ( ipeak ) concentrations were calculated for glucose and insulin as individual maximum postprandial increase from baseline .
for calculation of incremental responses , the specific fasting value at the day for postprandial measurements was used .
graphpad prism ( version 4 and 5 , graphpad software , san diego , ca , usa ) was used for graph plotting and calculation of auc .
significant differences in test variables after the different test meals were assessed with anova ( general linear model ) , in minitab statistical software ( release 14 ; minitab , minitab inc , state college , pa ) .
in the cases of unevenly distributed residuals ( tested with anderson - darling and considered unevenly distributed when p < 0.05 ) , box cox transformation were performed on the data prior to the anova .
differences between the products at different time points were evaluated using a mixed model ( proc mixed in sas release 9.2 ; sas institute inc , cary , nc ) with repeated measures and an autoregressive covariance structure .
randomization of the test products were performed in minitab statistical software ( release 14 ; minitab , minitab inc , state college , pa ) .
if the value from a test subject were missing for one of the products , the test subject was excluded from that specific calculation .
for breath hydrogen where the variation in the concentration scarcely changed over time , a weighted mean were produced by calculating a mean for equal time intervals ( 1 mean per hour ) over the test period , and then a mean for the different hours were calculated and used in statistical analysis .
one subject failed to follow instructions at voluntary food intake and data from this variable and subject is therefore excluded from the statistical analysis ( n = 18 ) .
due to analytical difficulties two subject are withdrawn from blood glucose calculations ( n = 17 ) .
the glucose profile ( gp2 ) is calculated as the time ( min ) during which the blood glucose are above fasting concentration divided with the squared incremental peak value ( mm ) of blood glucose for each test subject and test meal .
in the cases where the blood glucose concentration remained above fasting for the entire 210 min , the duration value was set to 210 min .
gp2 is used as a measure of the course of glycaemia including also characteristics in the late postprandial phase , high values are considered beneficial [ 34 ] .
p - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results breath h2 the f - breath h2 excretion ( p < 0.01 ) and the mean breath h2 excretion during the experimental day ( 0 - 330 min , p < 0.001 ) was significantly elevated after bk as a late evening meal compared to the wwb reference meal ( table 3 - 4 , figure 1 ) .

discussion the purpose of the present study was to examine the metabolic effects of intrinsic fermentable carbohydrates in boiled barley kernels in an over - night perspective .
in comparison to previous studies [ 23,35 ] , the experimental design is novel in that the experimental sampling period is significantly extended , covering a period ranging from 10.5 - 16 h after ingestion of test and reference evening meal .
further the present study aimed to investigate the influence of evening meals on metabolic test variables , appetite , and voluntary energy intake following ad libitum breakfast - and lunch meals ; that is in a more realistic eating situation than studies with standardized meal size .
previous studies have revealed that dietary supplementation of inulin and oligofructan during two weeks [ 28 ] , or consumption of other specific indigestible carbohydrates , e.g. present in bk , as a single late evening meal [ 23,36 ] , decrease the glucose response and increase gut microbial activity ( as determined by breath h2 and / or plasma short chain fatty acids ( scfa )) at the following breakfast meal in healthy humans .
in accordance with previous findings , the present study revealed decreased glucose response after breakfast following bk as an evening meal compared to wwb , and increased gut microbial fermentation , as indicated by elevated breath h2 concentrations .
as a novel finding , the bk evening meal decreased glucose iauc during the course of the entire experimental day ( 0 - 330 min ) , and increased gp2 after breakfast , all indicative of smoother postprandial glucose excursion .
in this context it must be noted that in contrast to the standardized meal size previously used , glucose measurements in the present study were conducted after ad libitum food intake ( standardized in quality ) .
at breakfast there was only a minor ( 4 % , non - significant ) decrease in energy intake after bk. it is therefore highly unlikely that the differences seen in metabolic variables after breakfast could be explained by differences in energy intake at breakfast .
however , the glucose responses at lunch following the bk evening meal may , at least to a minor degree , have been affected by the reduced caloric intake at lunch .
it has been hypothesized that modulation of gut microbiota by oligofructans , may interfere beneficially with host metabolism .
thus , dietary supplementation with oligofructose for 14 weeks decreased glucose auc and voluntary energy intake , as well as reduced inflammatory tonus in mice models [ 21 ] .
studies in rodents have further shown that oligofructose feeding during 4 - 5 weeks may promote epithelial l - cell differentiation in the gut , contributing to higher glp - 1 production [ 20,37 ] .
it has been demonstrated that scfa produced by bacterial fermentation may trigger signaling cascades through acting on scfa receptors on l - cells ( in vitro model ) , resulting in increased release of gut peptides such as glp - 1 and peptide yy ( pyy ) [ 38 ] .
fructan supplementation during two weeks was also reported to reduce glucose response , reduce feeling of hunger and increase glp - 1 concentration in response to an ad libitum meal in humans [ 28 ] .
less is known about the gut mediated effects of intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates in food , e.g. boiled barley kernels , on glycaemia , gut fermentation , and appetite regulation , and to the authors' knowledge , data from human studies are scarce .
nilsson et al .
( 2008 ) found inverse correlations between glucose iauc and breath h2 , supporting a link between colonic fermentation and glucose regulation [ 23 ] .
a particularly interesting observation in the present study is a 34 % increase in plasma concentration of glp - 1 in the morning ( 0 - 330 min ) after the bk evening meal , compared to the evening meal with wwb .
in addition , in the time period 60 - 120 min after breakfast also gip concentrations ( auc ) were increased after bk , which is in accordance with previous findings in our research group [ 23 ] .
both glp - 1 and gip have implications in glucose homeostasis , and in addition glp - 1 is considered as a modulator of appetite regulation .
both glucose intolerance and obesity seems to be related to decreased levels of glp - 1 , independently of one another [ 27 ] .
in the present study , the bk evening meal decreased the feeling of hunger during the whole experimental day , as compared to the evening wwb , and reduced voluntary energy intake ( - 12 %) at lunch .
previously it has been found that intravenous infusions of glp - 1 ( 50 pmol / kg.h ) during 4 h reduced voluntary energy intake by 12 % at a subsequent lunch meal , as compared to saline in young healthy men [ 39 ] .
the results in the present study are thus in accordance with previous studies showing that glp - 1 reduce food intake and increase satiety in both lean and obese subjects [ 40 ] .
although not significant , there was a trend ( p = 0.07 ) to reduced fasting levels of ghrelin after the bk evening meal by 16 % and there was a , non - significant , 10 % reduction of ghrelin in the late post - prandial phase prior to lunch ( auc 120 - 210 min ) as compared to after wwb .
intravenous administration during 4 h of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin , demonstrates increased food intake in healthy subjects at a subsequent meal [ 41 ] .
a connection has been proposed between colonic fermentation and reduced concentrations of serum ghrelin in healthy subjects , 6 h after ingestion of inulin , possible mediated through the formation of scfa [ 42 ] .
it can be suggested that the effects on gastro - intestinal hormones seen in the present study after the bk evening meal , stem from colonic fermentation of indigestible df in the bk. glp - 1 and gip , are known to exert insulinotropic effects [ 43 ] and have been suggested to account for up to 70 % of meal induced insulin release in humans [ 44 ] .
noticeably , the lowered glycaemia and increased incretin concentrations observed during the experimental day after bk evening meal were not accompanied by increased insulin response .
however , glp - 1 has previously been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in t2d [ 45 ] , a phenomenon that might have contributed to the facilitated glucose regulation during the experimental day in the present study in healthy subjects .
another factor that might have contributed to an improved insulin sensitivity after the bk evening meal is reduced f - ffa concentrations compared to the evening wwb reference meal [ 46 ] .
belfort et al .
( 2005 ) showed that even a modest increase in plasma ffa , well within the physiological range , causes a dose - dependent inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose disposal and insulin signaling in healthy lean subjects [ 47 ] .
inulin and oligofructan supplementation during two weeks , was also reported to reduce glucose response , reduce feeling of hunger and increase glp - 1 concentration in response to an ad libitum meal in humans [ 28 ] .

in the present study , f - il - 6 concentrations tended to be decreased ( p = 0.06 ) after the bk evening meals , which is in accordance with previous studies [ 23,36 ] .
low - grade chronic systemic inflammation is associated with obesity and insulin resistance [ 48 ] .
anti - inflammatory properties of specific indigestible carbohydrates , as present in e.g. bk , might constitute a promising approach aiming at dietary prevention and / or treatment of obesity and the metabolic syndrome .
in a cross - sectional study by yannakoulia et al .
( 2008 ) , consumption of wg cereals and low - fat dairy products were positively associated with adiponectin concentrations among healthy women [ 49 ] .
the authors suggested that adiponectin may be a mediator of the decreased risk of t2d associated with higher wg intake .
adiponectin has been shown to possess not only insulin sensitizing properties but also to have anti - inflammatory effects [ 50 ] .
decreased concentrations of adiponectin are observed in obesity and t2d [ 51,52 ] .
in the present study , we show that bk evening meal resulted in maintained adiponectin concentrations in the post - prandial period after breakfast as compared to the decrease observed after wwb evening meal .
the metabolic relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated .
however , adiponectin concentrations in subjects with metabolic disorders show a more pronounced decrease in the post - prandial phase compared to healthy subjects [ 53,54 ] .
conclusions the results indicate that indigestible carbohydrates , as present in bk , have the potential to facilitate glucose regulation in healthy subjects in a time period of 10.5 - 16 h , decrease inflammatory markers , decrease ffa , decrease hunger sensations and reduce energy intake at a subsequent lunch .
interestingly , the bk evening meal resulted in an increased release of glp - 1 during the whole experimental period .
the effects are suggested to be mediated through gut microbial fermentation , proposing a role of gut microbiota in modulating host metabolism in humans .
colonic fermentation of specific indigestible carbohydrates may provide one possible mechanism by which wg have proven beneficial in prevention of obesity and t2d .
taken together , the beneficial effects of bk are supportive for a prebiotic potential of intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates in barley kernel based products .

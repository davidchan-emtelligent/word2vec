primary liver sarcomas represent a rare group of neoplasias , with angiosarcoma being the most common histological type .
primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( pnet ) represents a high malignant neoplasia that usually affects the central nervous system and soft tissues .
an 18 - year - old male patient was admitted with clinical complains of pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant .
the clinical evaluation revealed a solid mass in the right hepatic lobe .
on the gross examination of the resected liver specimen , the right lobe of the liver was replaced by a yellow - red solid mass measuring 21 cm in its largest dimension .
on the histopathology , a tumor composed of small round blue cells with little cytoplasm and round nuclei was identified .
the lesion revealed positive immunoexpression for vimentin and cd99 and negative immunostaining for desmin , cd45 , cytokeratin , and neuroblastoma protein , suggesting , then , the diagnosis of pnet .
although it is an unusual tumor , it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of liver masses , especially in young patients .
1. introduction liver neoplastic lesions include many different histological types of primary benign and malignant masses and high rates of metastatic processes .
primary tumors can be solid or cystic and can arise from hepatocyte , bile duct epithelium , neuroendocrine cells , mesenchymal cells , and , rarely , from heterotopic tissues [ 1 , 2 ] .
hepatoblastoma and mesenchymal hamartoma are usually found in the pediatric population .
hepatocellular carcinoma represent the single most common histologic type of malignant epithelial tumors of the liver ( about 85 - 90 %) , being frequently associated to cirrhosis and chronic viral hepatitis .
primary hepatic sarcomas are exceedingly unusual , accounting for only 1 % to 2 % of all malignant tumors arising in the liver , with angiosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma being the most common histologic types [ 1 , 2 ] .
pnet represents a family of tumors which shows varying degrees of neuronal differentiation with an ewing 's sarcoma gene rearrangement , most often as a consequence of a t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) chromosomal translocation .
pnet is a highly malignant neoplasm most commonly involving the central nervous and skeletal system , and it is composed of small , round , uniform cells .
because of the undifferentiated appearance of the tumor cells , it looks as if the original cell might be an undifferentiated mesenchymal cell [ 3 - 5 ] .
herein , the authors report a case of pnet arising in the liver and review the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings of this tumor in a rare topography .
2. case report an 18 - year - old male african descent patient was admitted complaining of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal region for the last 3 months .
the physical examination revealed a firm , solid mass with an irregular lower border and mild tenderness in the liver topography .
abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography ( ct ) scans showed a solid mass in the right hepatic lobe , measuring 21 cm in its largest diameter , with possible colon and right kidney invasion , and vena cava compression ( figure 1 ) .
preoperative right hepatic artery embolization was performed .
in follow - up ct , areas of partial necrosis and no tumor size regression were found .
the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy .
the right lobe of the liver was partially replaced by a yellow - purple - red solid tumor , which was in continuity with the right kidney and hepatic colon flexure .
there were no signs of peritoneal disease and no evidence of metastasis in liver segments 1 to 3 .
a right extended hepatectomy with en bloc resection of the right kidney , gallbladder , and partial colectomy ( hepatic colon flexure ) with primary anastomosis was performed .
the surgical specimen consisted of a portion of the liver , of the gallbladder , a segment of the colon , and of the right kidney , previously fixed in formalin , measuring 30 cm x 25 cm x 13.5 cm , and weighing 4313 g. on cut surface , the hepatic parenchyma was replaced by a yellowish - gray , multilobulated , soft tumor , with yellow central areas , that measured 21 cm in its largest diameter .
the lesion was adhered to the colon and kidney , but without clear signs of invasion .
on hematoxylin - eosin staining , a neoplastic process composed of sheets or lobules of small round cells , with little cytoplasm , and darkly staining , round or oval nuclei , was identified ( figure 2 ) .
the lesion also showed areas of necrosis , high mitotic index , and rare rosettes .
the immunohistochemical study of lesion revealed positive expression for vimentin ( vim 3b4 - - figure 3 ) and cd99 ( 12e7 - - figure 4 ) , and negative immunostaining for desmin ( d33 ) , cytokeratin ( ae1 / ae3 ) , and neuroblastoma protein ( nb84 ) .
the liver parenchyma adjacent to the tumor had a normal histologic appearance .
the morphology of the hepatic lesion associated with the findings of the immunohistochemical study was consistent with pnet .
one month after surgery , venous thrombosis extending from the iliac vessels to the right atrium and multiple metastatic implants in the lungs were identified in thoracic ct. the patient had a sudden death due to massive pulmonary thromboembolism .
at this time , it was not possible to perform genetic studies to establish the lineage of the neoplasm .
3. discussion pnets are small round cell tumors that belong to the ewing 's sarcoma family of tumors .
these tumors are divided in two main categories : central ( derived from the neural tube ) and peripheral ( outside the central nervous system ) [ 6 - 10 ] .
pnets were first described by stout in 1918 [ 7 , 10 , 11 ] and represent less than 1 % of all sarcomas [ 7 , 12 ] .
these sarcomas predominantly affect bones and deep soft tissue and rarely affect visceral organs .
pnet can be found in the thorax ( 44 %) , abdomen and pelvis ( 44 %) , extremities ( 20 %) , and 6 % in the head and neck areas [ 9 , 12 ] .
visceral primary commitment has been described with increasing frequency in the pancreas , vagina , stomach , small bowel , ovaries , esophagus , and kidney [ 5 - 10 ] .
the gross appearance of the tumor varies .
in general , it is multilobulated , soft , and friable ; it rarely exceeds 10 cm in its largest dimension .
its cut surface has a gray - yellow or gray - tan appearance , often with large areas of necrosis , cyst formation , or hemorrhage .
despite the extensive necrosis , calcification is rare [ 4 , 5 , 13 ] .
at microscopy , the typical pnet shows a predominantly lobular growth pattern , with little or no stroma .
it is composed of poorly differentiated small round cells containing darkly staining , round or oval nuclei .
the pale eosinophilic cytoplasm is indistinct except in areas where the cells are more mature and the elongated hair - like cytoplasmic extensions coalesce to form rosettes .
most of the rosettes are similar to those seen in neuroblastomas and contain a central solid core of neurofibrillary material .
rarely do the rosettes contain a central lumen or vesicle .
some tumors are composed of cords or trabeculae of small round cells that can be mistaken by a carcinoid tumor or a small - cell undifferentiated carcinoma .
the presence of areas of necrosis is a usual finding .
there are uncommon tumors with glial , ependymal , cartilaginous , or epithelial differentiation .
some areas can resemble a fibrosarcoma or a malignant schwannoma [ 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 ] .
the ultrastructural features include the presence of elongated cell processes that interdigitate with each other and contain small dense - core granules ( neurosecretory granules ) that measure 50 - 100 nm and occasionally contain microtubules [ 14 , 15 ] .
on immunostains , many pnets are usually positive for cd99 , neuron - specific enolase , leu - 7 , s - 100 , and synaptophysin , and negative for desmin and myogenin / myod1 .
some cases are positive for cytokeratin [ 3 - 5 , 14 - 16 ] .
pnet characteristically exhibits a neural phenotype , expressing the mic2 - protein ( cd99 ) , and display the t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) chromosomal translocation in about 85 % - 95 % of the cases [ 3 , 7 , 8 , 17 - 22 ] .
the differential diagnosis includes neuroblastoma ( positive for nb84 ) , desmoplastic small round cell tumor , mesenchymal chondrosarcoma , alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , metastatic pulmonary small - cell carcinoma , cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma , small - cell osteosarcoma , and poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma [ 3 - 5 , 13 , 18 - 20 , 22 ] .
treatment with surgery alone for extraskeletal pnet is considered insufficient , and multimodal treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is frequently performed .
despite the multimodal treatment , most patients show a rapid dissemination of the disease .
key prognostic factors that adversely influence the outcome are the presence of metastatic disease at the time of the initial diagnosis , large tumor size , extensive necrosis , central axis tumors , and poor response to initial chemotherapy .
patients with type 1 ews / fli fusion transcripts appear to have longer disease - free survival than those with other fusion transcript types [ 3 , 5 , 6 , 19 - 21 ] .
4. conclusion pnets are usually aggressive small blue cell tumors arising in the central nervous or skeletal system .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the third case report of this tumor arising in liver parenchyma .
although it is an unusual liver tumor associated with poor prognosis , pnet should be considered in the differential diagnosis of liver masses , especially in young patients .

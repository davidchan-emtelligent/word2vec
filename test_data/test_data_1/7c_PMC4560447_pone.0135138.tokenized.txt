the synarcual is a structure incorporating multiple elements of two or more anterior vertebrae of the axial skeleton , forming immediately posterior to the cranium .
it has been convergently acquired in the fossil group ' placodermi ' , in chondrichthyes ( holocephali , batoidea ) , within the teleost group syngnathiformes , and to varying degrees in a range of mammalian taxa .
in addition , cervical vertebral fusion presents as an abnormal pathology in a variety of human disorders .
vertebrae develop from axially arranged somites , so that fusion could result from a failure of somite segmentation early in development , or from later heterotopic development of intervertebral bone or cartilage .
examination of early developmental stages indicates that in the batoidea and the ' placodermi ' , individual vertebrae developed normally and only later become incorporated into the synarcual , implying regular somite segmentation and vertebral development .
here we show that in the holocephalan callorhinchus milii , uniform and regular vertebral segmentation also occurs , with anterior individual vertebra developing separately with subsequent fusion into a synarcual .
vertebral elements forming directly behind the synarcual continue to be incorporated into the synarcual through growth .
this appears to be a common pattern through the vertebrata .
research into human disorders , presenting as cervical fusion at birth , focuses on gene misexpression studies in humans and other mammals such as the mouse .
however , in chondrichthyans , vertebral fusion represents the normal morphology , moreover , taxa such leucoraja ( batoidea ) and callorhinchus ( holocephali ) are increasingly used as laboratory animals , and the callorhinchus genome has been sequenced and is available for study .
our observations on synarcual development in three major groups of early jawed vertebrates indicate that fusion involves heterotopic cartilage and perichondral bone / mineralised cartilage developing outside the regular skeleton .
we suggest that chondrichthyans have potential as ideal extant models for identifying the genes involved in these processes , for application to human skeletal heterotopic disorders .

introduction the vertebrate axial skeleton is composed of serially repeated dorsal , central and ventral units extending posteriorly from the skull or braincase to the tip of the caudal fin , or tail [ 1 ] .
these units develop from sclerotomal cells derived from serially repeated somites ([ 2 - 3 ] ; see [ 4 ] for a broad summary of vertebral development in various groups ) ; the somites themselves derive rostro - caudally from continuous presomitic mesoderm under the influence of a segmentation clock and gene pathways such as notch , wnt and fgf [ 5 - 10 ] .
the dorsal , ventral and central vertebral units are incorporated into individual vertebrae , each of these units being controlled by specific genes [ 3 , 9 , 11 , 12 ] .
among vertebrates , there is a high degree of variability in the vertebral column ( e.g. , number of vertebrae present , morphology of the different vertebrae , contribution of the notochord , whether dorsal , ventral and central elements are present or absent ) , including the degree of vertebral fusion and the location of that fusion within the column .
for example , fusion occurs within the vertebral column of teleost fishes , as part of regular development ( e.g. , the caudal fin ) and also as a result of environmental stresses [ 13 - 19 ] .
fusion also occurs to produce the tetrapod sacrum [ 20 - 22 ] , all involving fusion of more posterior vertebral elements. with respect to more anterior vertebrae , the notarium in some birds ( e.g. passeriformes ) and pterosaurs involves fusion of the thoracic vertebra [ 21 , 23 ] .
formation of the synarcual involves fusion of the anteriormost , cervical , vertebrae and is found in certain placoderms , a group of fossil fishes from the silurian to devonian periods ( 443.8 +/ - 1.5 mya - 358.9 +/ - 0.4mya ; see [ 24 ] : figure 1 , showing a generalized placoderm ; also [ 25 , 26 ]) .
a synarcual also occurs in the holocephali and batoidea among the chondrichthyes [ 24 , 27 - 29 ] and rarely in teleosts [ 30 - 32 ] .
cervical fusion also occurs in several mammalian taxa , including sloths , manatees , dugongs [ 33 ] , armadillos [ 34 ] , whales [ 35 ] , ricochetal rodents [ 36 ] , and the marsupial didelphis [ 37 ] .
in humans , cervical vertebral fusion results from congenital or acquired disease processes .
congenital disorders are either related to a failure of somite segmentation early in development ( e.g. , klippel - feil syndrome ) , or transformation of tissues surrounding the vertebrae into cartilage and bone ( e.g. , fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ) [ 38 - 41 ] .
current research is beginning to identify animal models , such as the salmon , that can be used to explore the causes of this fusion for application to human patients ( e.g. , [ 18 ]) .
however , vertebral fusion in the salmon is often the result of environmental stresses ( an acquired morphology ) , as noted above ; however , the need for ' evolutionary mutant models' for human diseases has recently been recognised , where adaptive phenotypes resemble human diseases ; for example , the antarctic icefish lose bone density to increase buoyancy , a potential model for osteoporosis in humans ( see table 1 in [ 42 ] , also [ 43 ]) .
these ' evolutionary mutants' would be complementary to laboratory , or induced mutants , such as the salmon [ 42 ] .
because placoderms and chondrichthyans possess fused anterior cervical vertebrae as part of their normal morphology , rather than resulting from environmental stresses , they are potentially ideal models for examining the causes of congenital human cervical disorders .
we are beginning to understand the development of the batoid synarcual [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] as well as that of placoderms , the most primitive of the jawed vertebrates [ 24 - 26 ]. however , the synarcual of the other major group of chondrichthyans , the holocephali , has not been studied in detail .
we demonstrate below that early ontogenetic stages of the extant holocephalan callorhinchus milii show normal development of axial vertebrae as individual elements , implying that the somites also form individually and normally .
within the adult mineralizing synarcual , the individual vertebrae are retained to some degree and visible , comparable to both placoderms and batoid chondrichthyans .
these observations suggest that in most groups of vertebrates with a consistently developing synarcual , fusion occurs after normal vertebral development , more comparable to human cervical disorders where cartilage and bone develop heterotopically in the vertebral column .
materials and methods ' placodermi ' , campbellodus decipiens a specimen of campbellodus decipiens ( western australian museum , wam 11.9.1 ) was scanned using synchrotron radiation x - ray tomographic microscopy ( srxtm ) at the imaging and medical beamline of the australian synchrotron , victoria , australia ( http :// www.synchrotron.org.au / index.php / home ) .
the photon energy of the monochromatic x - ray beam was set to 30 kev .
data acquisition included 3600 projections of 2560x2140 pixels each with the pixel size being 6.5 microns and measured resolution 13 microns .
exposure time for a single projection was 1s , resulting in a 1 hour scan for the full sample .
the sample to detector distance was 210mm which has enhanced the object visibility due to the inline phase contrast .
data were processed and reconstructed utilising the ctas package ( https :// github.com / antonmx / ctas ) and rendered with drishti - 2 ( https :// github.com / ajaylimaye / drishti ) .
holocephali , callorhinchus milii : stages 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 animals were euthanised via an overdose of tricaine in seawater .
we confirm that monash animal services ( mas ) specifically approved this study via the awarding of ethics permit mas / armi / 2010 / 01 , monash university , victoria , australia .
impregnated females of c. milii were collected from western port bay , victoria , australia ( dpi permits # rp1003 and rp1112 ) and housed in aerated , temperature regulated seawater tanks in the rosebud facility on the mornington peninsula , victoria ( ethics permits monash animal services ( mas ) mas / armi / 2010 / 01 ) .
egg cases were collected and tagged with the deposition date and the females were released after 4 to 6 weeks [ 44 ] .
tagged eggs were transferred to a closed system ( monash university , melbourne , victoria ) , temperature 14 - 16.7degreesc , average 16.8 +/ - 2.31degreesc .
embryos were dissected out from the egg cases at regular intervals and euthanized , as above .

embryos were measured and staged following [ 45 ] .
cleared and stained specimens the specimen were cleared and stained according to a protocol modified from taylor and van dyke [ 46 ] .
a fixed and dehydrated stage 28 of c. milii was stained in 0.25 mg / ml alcian blue in 80 % ethanol and 20 % glacial acetic acid for 27.5 hours .
the specimen was bleached in 0.45 % hydrogen peroxide / 0.43 % potassium hydroxide in water to remove pigments and cleared in 2.25 mg / ml of trypsin in 30 % saturated sodium borate in water .
the specimen was cleared in 100 % glycerol and imaged on a leica dissecting microscope with an axiocam mrm ( zeiss ) colour camera .
fluorescent immunostained specimens whole - mount antibody stainings were performed as described previously [ 42 ] .
the following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used : myosin ( mf20 ) and collagen type ii ( ii - ii6b )( from developmental studies hybridoma bank ) , sox9 ( marking pre - chondrogenic cartilage and neural crest cells [ 47 , 48 ]) from millipore and dapi ( cell nuclei ) and visualized using isotype - specific fluorescent alexa secondary antibodies ( invitrogen ) .
the following fluorophores and colors were used : cell nuclei : dapi , white ; myosin ( skeletal muscles ) : mf20 ( 488 nm ) , green ; sox9 ( 546 nm ) , red ; collagen type ii : 647 nm , blue .
stages 22 to 27 were cleared in 80 % glycerol in pbs and mounted on a glass slide .
stages 29 and 30 were embedded in 1 % low melting point agarose onto a glass petri dish and cleared in 1:2 benzylalcohol : benzyl benzoate .
whole mounts of stages 22 , 25 and 27 were imaged on an inverted leica sp - 5 confocal microscope with a 20x glycerol objective , stage 23 was imaged on an inverted leica sp - 8 confocal microscope with a 10x dry objective and stages 29 and 30 were imaged on an upright leica sp - 8 confocal microscope with a 5x dry objective .
the stacks were analyzed with imaris 8 imaging suite and fiji ( image j ) .
final image processing was done using photoshop cs6 .

( wam 11.9.1 ) .
a , lateral and b , medial views of synarcual comprising three fused vertebral elements ( neural arches , spines ) .
fusion is dorsal and ventral with space between these elements remaining , for the neural spines .
the dorsalmost part of the three spines has become enlarged , large white arrows indicate lines of perichondral bone deposition on the developing heterotopic cartilage .
ventrally , the neural arches are also flared ( asterisk ) , particularly the most anterior arch remnant ; the third element retains more of the typical circular base shape .
arrowheads indicate preservation of the sharp edges along the incorporated neural spines , as are seen in more posterior separate vertebra of the posterior axial skeleton .
large white arrows indicate anterior direction .
the placodermi are an extinct group of early jawed vertebrates , with current analyses indicating they are paraphyletic , with different taxa resolved to consecutive nodes at the base of the jawed vertebrates ( e.g. , [ 49 ] , and references within ) .
among placoderms , a synarcual has been described from the ptyctodontida , arthrodira and rhenanida [ 24 - 26 , 50 - 52 ] .
new high - resolution synchrotron scans of the ptyctodont campbellodus decipiens support previous suggestions that the placoderm synarcual forms from the incorporation of regularly developed vertebral elements ( e.g. , [ 24 ] : figure 2f , g ) .
the synarcual itself is composed of three neural spines , separated by elongate openings for the passage of spinal nerves ( sp.n ) .
immediately posterior to the synarcual are independent neural spines , with flared and rounded bases ( representing neural arch bases , larger white arrowhead ) , that would have rested on the notochord .
there is a distinct and sharp ridge running along the rostral margin of the neural spine ( small arrowheads ) , while the dorsal portion of the neural spine is also flared ( also [ 24 ] : figure 2d ) .
the dorsal part of the synarcual is large and expanded ; internally and externally , growth lines are visible , suggesting ongoing cartilage deposition , accompanied by corresponding perichondral ossification externally ( fig 1a and 1b , smaller white arrows ). of the three incorporated vertebral elements , the most rostral is the largest , with subsequent elements decreasing in size caudally , with the third being of similar size to the independent , separate neural elements .
these three elements incorporated into the synarcual preserve the flared bases of more caudal vertebrae ( asterisk ) , as well as the ridge along the rostral margin ( small arrowheads ) .
however , along with an increase in size , this ridge becomes less distinct in the more rostral vertebra of the synarcual .
these differences suggest that the three vertebral elements were added or incorporated successively to the synarcual , rather than at the same time , and were modified during this time .
this interpretation is further supported by observations in other ptyctodonts such as materpiscis attenboroughi , where previously independent vertebral elements are being added and incorporated into the rear of the existing synarcual ([ 24 ] : figure 2f , g ) .
there is some variation in the numbers of vertebrae being added , with five in materpiscis and four in austroptyctodus gardineri , again suggesting successive and ongoing addition of vertebrae .
chondrichthyes ; holocephali : callorhinchus milii stage 22 ( fig 2 ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0135138.g002 fig 2 callorhinchus milii , stage 22 .
a - d , lateral view showing general morphology as well as sox9 ( neural crest cells , prechondrogenic cartilage , red ) and mf20 ( muscle fibres , developing skeletal musculature , green ) staining .
developing vertebrae are separate and distinct at this early ontogenetic stage .
asterisk indicates rear of developing braincase .
abbreviations : h , heart ; op , optic capsule ; ov , otic vesicle ; pa , pharyngeal arches , v1 , 3 , 5 , differentiating vertebrae 1 , 3 , 5 .
in stage 22 , individual vertebral elements are present , extending posteriorly from the otic vesicle ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
the specimen is stained for sox9 ( red ) and mf20 ( green ) ; the former marks pre - chondrogenic cartilage and neural crest cells , including crest cells migrating into the pharyngeal arches ( pa ; fig 2a - 2c ) , while the latter indicates developing skeletal musculature and heart ( h ) ( fig 2b and 2d ) .
pre - chondrogenic cartilage can be observed dorsally and ventrally in the individual elements more posteriorly , and throughout the elements just behind the otic vesicle and developing braincase ( fig 2c , ov , asterisk , v1 - 3 ) .
the presence of the newly formed fibers of skeletal muscle and the prechondrogenic cartilage indicates that the somites have differentiated by this stage into the myotome and vertebral elements medially , in each individual element .
this indicates normal somite development and maturation into the sclerotome and dermomyotome .
individual , differentiated elements ( or vertebrae ) can be recognized just posterior to the braincase ( fig 2c and 2d , v1 - v5 ) , with muscle associated with these , extending from the first differentiating vertebra ( fig 2c , v1 ) to the developing cartilage at the rear of the braincase .
stage 23 ( fig 3 ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0135138.g003 fig 3 callorhinchus milii , stage 23 .
a - d , lateral view showing a , staining as in fig 2 , also dapi ( cell nuclei , white ) staining .
blue colour indicates collagen type ii staining in the notochord .
b , as in a , but dapi staining not visualised ; c , sox9 and mf20 staining , showing dorsal and ventral vertebral elements ( neural and haemal arches ) and skeletal musculature ; d , sox9 staining alone .
all vertebral elements separate and distinct at this stage .
abbreviations as in fig 1 , also : nc , notochord ; oc.v , occipital vertebrae ; skel.musc , skeletal musculature ; rb , rostral bulb [ 28 ] .
stage 23 is characterised by the development of four pharyngeal arches and a large rostral bulb ( rb ; fig 3a ) .
the optic cup ( op ) and otic vesicle ( ov ) are well developed .
the notochord is labelled by collagen type ii , clearly marked in blue ( fig 3b ) and it extends anteroposteriorly in association with the developing vertebral elements .
the trunk musculature has differentiated and spans each vertebrae and , as in stage 22 , is restricted to the middle of these elements ( fig 3c ) .
individual differentiated vertebrae are still present at this later stage , indicated by the sox9 staining of the dorsal and ventral prechondrogenic cartilage ( fig 3d ) and dapi staining of cell nuclei ( fig 3a ) .
this indicates that the vertebrae are developing distinct dorsal and ventral neural elements , notably , the most anterior vertebrae have to change shape , and the distance between them appears smaller than in the previous stage .
these are identified as the occipital vertebrae , and will eventually fuse to the rear of the braincase ( oc.v ) .
stage 25 ( fig 4a and 4b ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0135138.g004 fig 4 a - e , callorhinchus milii , stages 25 ( a , b ) , 27 ( c , d ) .
a , cell nuclei ( white ) .
sox9 ( red ) marks dorsal and ventral vertebral elements and neural crest cells ; the vagus and accessory nerves ( x and xi ) are clearly visible .
three anteriormost occipital vertebrae ( oc.v ) lack the spinal nerves associated with more posterior vertebrae ; they appear closer together differ in shape relative to the more posterior vertebrae , which are better developed and still distinct from each other .
b , notochord ( blue ) and developing skeletal musculature are visualized .
the pectoral fin bud is beginning to develop ( p.fin ) , while the pectoral fin musculature is differentiating from the ventral myotome ( m.pre ) .
c , stage 27 , sox9 no longer stains the vertebral elements ( differentiated beyond the prechondrogenic cartilage stage ) ; they are best seen via dapi staining ( cell nuclei ) .
all vertebral elements are still separate from one another .
developing pectoral fin musculature is more distinctly bifid in shape .
abbreviations as in previous figures , also : drg , dorsal root ganglia ; m.pre , pectoral fin muscle precursor ; p.fin , pectoral fin ; sg , sympathetic ganglia ; vr , ventral root .
dorsal and ventral prechondrogenic cartilage of the vertebrae continues to develop ( fig 4a ) , but sox9 ( red ) also marks neural crest cells as they migrate ventrally into the pharyngeal arches , and caudally to form the vagus and accessory nerves ( x , xi ) , as well as components of the spinal nerves , including the dorsal roots and ganglia and the ventral roots and sympathetic ganglia ventrally .
the three vertebrae ( oc.v , fig 4a and 4b ) are ventral to the developing accessory nerve , and caudal to the vagus nerve , representing the occipital vertebrae ( fig 4b , oc.v ) ; these will contribute to the occiput in later ontogeny , as noted above .
there is some indication of ventral roots developing in the occipital vertebrae , but the dorsal root ganglia are absent from these three vertebrae .
the spinal nerves run dorsoventrally across the vertebrae including the occipital anteroventrally , just posterior to the pharyngeal arches , dapi marks a bifid protrusion associated with each myotome , better developed in later stages as described below , again representing developing fin musculature .
mf20 ( green , fig 4b ) marks the axial skeletal musculature associated with the middle of each differentiated vertebra .
all vertebrae are separate and developing normally but as noted in stage 23 , the occipital vertebrae are changing morphology and appear closer to each other in this stage .
stage 27 ( fig 4c and 4d ) the vertebrae in stage 27 are no longer expressing sox9 ( no longer at the pre - chondrogenic stage ) but are better visualised through a dapi staining ( fig 4c ) .
as in earlier stages , the more anterior occipital vertebrae appear closer to each other , while the posterior vertebral elements remain more clearly separated .
skeletal muscle is well differentiated and remains closely associated with each vertebra , including the occipital vertebrae .
dapi staining marks the series of muscle progenitors associated with the developing pectoral fin , which now have strongly bifid ventral edges , as they continue to migrate into the fin bud ( m.pre , fig 4c ) .
as noted , these first appear in stage 25 , although their bifid nature is less apparent and the fin bud itself is smaller ( e.g. , fig 3b ) .
the ventral nerve roots in the occipital vertebrae are better - developed , although the dorsal root ganglia are still absent ( fig 4d ) .
stage 28 ( fig 5a - 5c ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0135138.g005 fig 5 callorhinchus milii , stage 28 , a - c. cleared and stained specimen ( alcian blue ) .
a , lateral view , showing embryo with external gills and developing vertebrae .
white arrow indicates anterior vertebrae that have become misshapen , indicating fusion and coalescence .
the position of these relative to the pharyngeal arches and pectoral fin indicates that these are fusing to the occipital region of the braincase , rather than as part of a more posterior synarcual .
more posterior vertebrae appear normal at this stage .
b , c , dorsal view , arrowhead indicates occipital anteriorly and vertebrae posteriorly .
white arrow indicates foramina abbreviations , as in previous figures , also : ext.gills , external gills .
a specimen cleared and stained with alcian blue ( cartilage ) show the posterior edge of the skull ( with occipital vertebrae being incorporated , fig 5b and 5c , arrowheads ) as well as more posterior elements of the vertebral column ( fig 5a - 5c , v ) .
separate vertebral elements can still be recognized in both lateral and ventral views , with the edges of individual vertebrae still visible , along with large , open nerve foramina ( fig 5b , white arrows ) .
in fig 5a , these more posterior vertebral elements are narrow and regular in shape ; however , more anteriorly , the elements are more irregular in shape ( on either side of white arrow ) , providing some indication that fusion of cartilaginous vertebral elements has begun by this stage. with respect to later stages described below , these would appear to be fused to the occipital region .
stage 29 ( fig 6a and 6b ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0135138.g006 fig 6 callorhinchus milii .
a , b , stage 29 ( maximum projection , sox9 red , dapi white , mf20 green ) shows that the occipital vertebrae are still distinct from each other but that the braincase is now well developed .
the posterior elements are still separate but show distinct dorsal and ventral elements for each vertebra .
in stage 30 ( c , f ; one plane in z , sox9 red , dapi white ) , the synarcual has started to form and can be recognised medially .
the individual vertebral elements are still visible laterally ( v ) .
the vagus and accessory nerves are visible lateral to the mineralised braincase ( c ) .
d , e show distribution of the cranial nerves in a c. milii hatchling ( khonsari et al. 2013 ) .

the vertebrae are still individual elements posterior to the braincase , although fusion and coalescence is observed anteriorly ( fig 6a and 6b , oc.v ) .
the position of this fusion dorsal to the pharyngeal arches ( pa ) and posterior cranial nerves ( fig 6a , asterisk ) suggest that this is occurring with respect to the occipital region of the braincase , rather than within the separate synarcual ( compare fig 6a and 6b with reconstruction of late stage embryo of callorhinchus milii , fig 6d and 6e [ 53 ]) .
vertebral elements have stopped expressing sox9 , showing that they are further along in the chondrogenic programme .
few skeletal muscle fibres are stained in green as mf20 only stains newly formed fibres .
however , it shows that the pectoral fin musculature is newly differentiated ( fig 6b ) .
stage 30 ( fig 6c and 6f ) z sections through a confocal stack of a dorsally mounted specimen .
a more ventral z plane shows the synarcual forming posterior to the pharyngeal arches ( pa , syn , fig 6c ) with the ventral elements of the vertebrae still visible in lateral view ( v , fig 6c ) .
a more dorsal plane in z ( fig 6f ) shows the branches of the x nerve anteriorly ( x ) , also marking the position of the pharyngeal region ( fig 6d and 6e ) relative to the otic capsule and synarcual .
spino - occipital nerves can be seen in association with the synarcual ( sp.n , syn , fig 6f ) .

arrowhead indicates region in fig 7e , arrow indicates ventral area where vertebral elements have not fully fused or coalesced .
e , virtual section ( drishti ) through ventral part of synarcual showing unfused elements ( arrowheads ) that have become mineralized , preventing further fusion and preserving a portion of the original shape .
in an adult individual , the synarcual has developed an extensive dorsal keel , vertebrae have become fused into a single unit , and mineralization of the cartilage is occurring .
rendered ct - scans and virtual sections clearly show that this mineralization extends rostrocaudally , dorsoventally ( both , fig 7b ) , and from external to internal .
in fig 7c and 7d , virtual sections through the synarcual show how the mineralization extends through the nerve foramina on both sides of the synarcual , meeting in the midline .
fig 7e represents a virtual slice through the ventral portion of the synarcual , below the spinal nerve foramina .
the asterisk in fig 7e marks a region of the synarcual also visible in fig 7a ( anterior view ) .
patterns of mineralization ( fig 7e , lighter areas representing high density regions ) again are clearly rostro - caudal , but also show that ventralmost fusion of the vertebral elements is incomplete , and the mineralization is occurring along two separate halves of the synarcual internally ( also fig 7a and 7d , white arrow ) .
the mineralization continues internally along the midline , with some indication of the retention of individual ventral elements ( fig 7e , arrowheads ) .
the white arrowhead in fig 7c and 7d shows another small area of mineralization more dorsally , again representing incomplete fusion or inclusion of the ventral vertebral elements , but at the anterior margin of the synarcual .
discussion the process of somite segmentation during early development is well understood , with presomitic mesoderm under the influence of two opposing gradients ( retinoic acid rostro - caudally ; fgf caudo - rostrally ) and the oscillating segmentation clock , itself controlled by genes such as notch , fgf and wnt [ 6 , 10 ] .
somite pairs form rostro - caudally , and subsequently differentiate to form the sclerotome ventrally and the dermomyotome dorsally .
the sclerotome contributes to the axial skeleton , and the dermomyotome to the dorsal epithelium and musculature .
segmentation is well understood in zebrafish [ 54 ] and amniotes , including a process known as resegmentation in the latter , where the sclerotome becomes polarized into distinct rostral and caudal halves .
during resegmentation , caudal and rostral halves fuse , to form a single vertebra .
associated muscles do not undergo resegmentation , and so remain out of register , but functional , with respect to the vertebrae .
resegmentation was thought to be related to the size of the sclerotome , which is large in amniotes , but much smaller in anamniotes ( e.g. , amphibians , fish ) .
scaal and wiegreffe ([ 55 ] : figure 4 ) review differences between the amniote and anamniotes , including the relatively smaller sclerotome differentiating at the medioventral corner of the somite and the larger myotome in the latter .
they also note that in anamniotes , the myotome is the first to differentiate .
resegmentation has been recently demonstrated in the amphibians , in the axolotl [ 56 ] , but has not been fully investigated in chondrichthyans or fishes in general , except for the zebrafish [ 57 ] .
observations in the holocephali indicate that somite segmentation occurs normally , because in early ontogenetic stages ( st 23 - 27 ) , separate and distinct vertebrae are developing , indicated by the presence of prechondrogenic cartilage dorsally and ventrally ( neural and haemal elements ) , with associated muscle fibres ( figs 2 and 3 ) .
in later stages , these developing ( differentiating ) vertebrae are associated with the spinal nerves ( red , fig 5a , 5b and 5d ) .
only ventral roots are present in the first three occipital somites , as previously described in the chick and mammals [ 58 ] , and chondrichthyans [ 59 ] .
the first dorsal root ganglion appears in more caudal vertebrae , along with the ventral roots , these meeting to form the spinal nerve crossing the vertebra ( fig 5 ) .
the dorsal and ventral roots innervate the epaxial and hypaxial musculature , respectively .
v - shaped muscles are present , associated with each vertebra .
pectoral fin muscles are developing , as direct bifid extensions of the ventral ( hypaxial ) region of the musculature into the fin , as observed in other chondrichthyans ( scyliorhinus , catshark [ 59 - 61 ]) .
at these stages , it is difficult to see a developing sclerotome , which , if following the anamniote pattern , would be represented by a small cluster of medioventral cells , and so difficult to see in lateral view ( figs 2 - 5 ) .
however , the dominance of the myotomal muscle derivatives corresponds to observations that the myotome differentiates earlier and dominates in anamniotes [ 55 ] .
however , we cannot observe whether resegmentation occurs in callorhinchus ; the presence of resegmentation in amphibians [ 56 ] , and ' leaky ' resegmentation in zebrafish [ 57 ] suggests that resegmentation occurs , phylogenetically , in the group osteichthyes ( bony fishes , including tetrapods ) .
chondrichthyes , including callorhinchus ( holocephali ) and sharks such as scyliorhinus ( elasmobranchii ) form the sister group to the osteichthyes , so resegmenation will have to be investigated further to establish this process as a general character for jawed vertebrates .
nevertheless , the developing vertebrae and skeletal musculature indicate that segmentation has proceeded normally in callorhinchus , with differentiation of the somite into sclerotome and dermomyotome , leading to the normal development of the vertebrae and associated musculature .
our observations of stages 23 - 30 suggest that to this point , fusion occurs with respect to vertebrae that are dorsal to the branchial arches , and more posterior cranial nerves , posterior to the otic capsule and anterior to the pectoral fin ( fig 6 ) .
we suggest that this represents fusion of vertebral elements to the occipital region of the braincase , which is located in this relative position ( cf. reconstructions of callorhinchus embryo ( fig 6d and 6e , [ 53 ]) .
the synarcual , as a fusion of the anteriormost vertebrate into a single structure , develops subsequently from the more posterior vertebrae , with the incorporation of vertebrae on an ongoing basis [ 24 ] .
this is similar to previous observations that in batoid chondrichthyans , the synarcual first forms from separate vertebral centres [ 27 , 29 ] .
in the batoids , claeson [ 27 ] noted that early in ontogeny , the synarcual formed from coalescing vertebral chondrification centres , and was subsequently covered by a prismatic cartilage layer .
in callorhinchus , mineralization of the synarcual occurs as the prismatic layer extends caudally and ventrally , and internally via the nerve foramina ( fig 7 ) .
in the anteroventral part of the synarcual , mineralization outlines individual vertebrae ( fig 7d and 7e ) , supporting the suggestion above that the vertebrae first develop normally and are only later incorporated into the synarcual .
mineralization of the cartilage , as a surficial prismatic layer ( e.g. , fig 7c ) , prevented any further incorporation of these vertebrae , allowing them to still be recognized within the synarcual .
the presence of individual and distinct vertebral elements within the synarcual is an important criterion for distinguishing between vertebral fusion due to irregularities in somite formation ( individual vertebrae would not have formed ) , versus fusion later in ontogeny .
in the latter , somites and vertebrae develop normally before fusion occurs and can be recognised .
this is relevant to extant taxa , but also fossil forms .
in the placoderm synarcual , although ontogenies cannot be directly observed in fossil taxa , perichondral ossification of these elements can ' freeze ' ontogenies and provide evidence for their normal development and subsequent incorporation into the synarcual .
taxa such as the arthrodires cowralepis and compagopiscis , and the ptyctodont materpiscis preserve distinct vertebral morphologies within the synarcual ( distinct rounded arch bases ) or the addition of elements to the synarcual ([ 24 ] : figures 2f , g and 4 ). by comparison , the vertebral elements in the ptyctodont campbellodus retain some evidence of individuality ( flared , rounded bases , rostral ridges ) , but there has been notable modification of these arches as they were incorporated into the synarcual , including a flared dorsal keel ( fig 1 ) .
modification is greatest anteriorly , indicating an ongoing incorporation of vertebral elements , as in callorhinchus .
in austroptyctodus the individual vertebral elements that make up the synarcual cannot be identified , although the rounded bases of the neural arches can still be distinguished ([ 24 ] : figure 2e ) .
clues as to how originally separate and distinct vertebral elements could be added to and incorporated into the synarcual are provided by recent investigations into teleosts such as the salmon ( osteichthyes ) ; these have been intensively studied for defects in the vertebral column , including fusion , caused by environmental factors such as temperature changes and stress .
tissues associated with the vertebral column including bone , cartilage and intervertebral tissues ( notochord ) appear highly plastic under these conditions .
for example , witten et al .
[ 16 , 17 , 14 , 62 ] found that vertebrae developed normally , but response to stresses included a transformation of intervertebral tissues into cartilage and subsequently bone , while osteoblast ( bone - depositing ) cells in the vertebral growth zones underwent a metaplastic change to become chondroblasts ( cartilage - depositing ) cells , depositing cartilage between the vertebrae ( also [ 18 , 19 , 63 ]) .
genes associated with this metaplastic cell transformation during vertebral fusion include matrillin - 1 [ 64 ] and sox9 [ 18 ] .
these observations , in a range of vertebrates , suggest that the synarcual resulted from a transformation of cells and tissues located between vertebrae , rather than a failure of somite segmentation .
among human vertebral disorders , this is more comparable to conditions such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ( fop ) , which involves a metamorphosis of soft connective and muscle tissue associated with the vertebrae into cartilage and endochondral bone , resulting in fusion ( e.g. , [ 38 , 39 ]) .
genes involved in this process include the bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmp ) and their receptors , and noggin ( reviewed in [ 40 ] ; [ 65 ]) .
the transformation into endochondral bone in fop involves a cartilaginous precursor stage , which is related to a gain - of - function mutation in certain bmp receptors , resulting in increased chondrogenic differentiation and thus increased bone formation , to fuse together existing vertebrae ( e.g. , [ 65 ]) .
as well , dittman et al .
[ 66 ] noted that inactivation of inhibitory hedgehog family receptor patched1 resulted in chondrocyte proliferation in the intervertebral discs and fusion of vertebrae .
metamorphic and transformative processes similar to those involved in fop and fusion of teleost vertebrae , affecting initially normally developed vertebrae , could be envisaged for the placoderm and chondrichthyan synarcual ( callorhinchus and the batoid rays ) , specifically with respect to the intervertebral tissues , connective tissues and muscle , and the transformation of these into extra cartilage .
placoderms and chondrichthyans lack the capacity to develop endochondral bone and instead mineralization is surficial ; in placoderms , heterotopic perichondral bone is formed , and in chondrichthyans , heterotopic prismatic cartilage is formed as a thin layer on the cartilaginous surface .
teleosts and chondrichthyans present an opportunity to study genes involved in the fusion of vertebrae in considerable detail , while chondrichthyans allow a particular focus on the cervical region .
candidate genes related to spinal fusion in teleosts have been identified , but fusion depends on environmental conditions generating animal stress ; by comparison , fusion of vertebrae into a synarcual occurs normally as part of development in chondrichthyans such as callorhinchus and the batoids , and consistently in the anterior part of the vertebral column .
this makes these chondrichthyans more suitable as ' evolutionary mutant models' ( see table 1 in [ 42 ] , also [ 43 ]) for studying genetic / developmental mechanisms resulting in spinal fusion in humans , as distinct from trauma / disease processes that cause this fusion .
chondrichthyans possessing synarcuals such as callorhinchus and leucoraja ( little skate ) are becoming new model animals in genetic studies , with a genome now available for both taxa [ 67 , 68 ] .
future work should focus on further identifying genes involved in synarcual development in these taxa , to provide a framework for future medical research into human vertebral disease syndromes .

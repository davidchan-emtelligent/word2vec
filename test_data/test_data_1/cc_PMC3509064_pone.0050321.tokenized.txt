independent studies have shown that candidate genes for dyslexia and specific language impairment ( sli ) impact upon reading / language - specific traits in the general population .
to further explore the effect of disorder - associated genes on cognitive functions , we investigated whether they play a role in broader cognitive traits .
we tested a panel of dyslexia and sli genetic risk factors for association with two measures of general cognitive abilities , or iq , ( verbal and non - verbal ) in the avon longitudinal study of parents and children ( alspac ) cohort ( n > 5,000 ) .
only the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus showed statistically significant association ( minimum p = 0.00009 ) which was further supported by independent replications following analysis in four other cohorts .
in addition , a fifth independent sample showed association between the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus and white matter structure in the posterior part of the corpus callosum and cingulum , connecting large parts of the cortex in the parietal , occipital and temporal lobes .
these findings suggest that this locus , originally identified as being associated with dyslexia , is likely to harbour genetic variants associated with general cognitive abilities by influencing white matter structure in localised neuronal regions .

introduction dyslexia ( or reading disability , rd ) and specific language impairment ( sli ) are common neurodevelopmental disorders , reflecting specific deficits in the acquisition of literacy skills and oral language , respectively [ 1 ] .
for both disorders , a diagnosis is achieved by excluding known causes of the deficits , such as co - occurring sensory or neurological impairment or lack of educational opportunity .
rd and sli are complex traits resulting from the interaction of multiple factors of both genetic and environmental origin , yet the biological underpinnings and cascading cognitive deficits remain poorly understood .
several genes have been proposed as susceptibility candidates for both rd and sli .
the rd candidates include the robo1 , kiaa0319 , dcdc2 and dyx1c1 genes and the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus [ 2 ] .
the sli candidates include the cmip , atp2c2 and cntnap2 genes [ 3 ] .
it has been shown that most of the dyslexia risk genes ( kiaa0319 , dcdc2 , dyx1c1 and robo1 ) are involved in cortical development and specifically in neuronal migration [ 4 ] .
an important unanswered research question is how genes involved in such a general process as cortical development contribute to the risk for specific neurodevelopmental disorders .
several studies have addressed this research question by investigating whether candidate genes implicated in a specific disorder show pleiotropic effects , which could , for example , help explain the high comorbidity observed between sli , rd and adhd [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
to date only modest associations have been reported for shared genetic factors across these separate conditions [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
recently we conducted an association study in the avon longitudinal study of parents and children ( alspac ) cohort to explore potential genetic overlaps between sli and rd [ 11 ] .
we analysed a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , previously reported to be associated with either rd or sli , and tested them for association with literacy and language related phenotypes .
we reported highly specific effects for dcdc2 , kiaa0319 and cmip with measures of single - word reading and spelling [ 11 ] .
these data suggested genetic effects on specific and independent aspects of cognitive function rather than on multiple or more generalised phenotypes .
a direct genetic effect of the impact on broader cognitive abilities for rd and sli candidate genes has never been tested .
general cognitive ability , assessed with standardised intelligence tests , is a highly heritable trait [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , yet very few genes have been identified that impact upon these trait [ 14 ] .
most of the reported candidate genes have lacked adequate sample size and replications [ 15 ] .
a recent genome - wide association study ( gwas ) supports the strong heritability of cognitive abilities , but with effects that are spread across a large number of genetic factors and therefore not easily detectable in isolation [ 16 ] .
in the present study , we used a candidate gene approach to investigate a precise question , namely whether genetic risk factors for rd and sli have a broader impact on general cognitive function .
this hypothesis is supported by the consistent observation of significant correlation between reading abilities and general cognition .
we analysed rd and sli candidate genes for association with general cognitive ability in the alspac cohort and detected a statistically significant association at the chromosome 2p12 dyslexia - associated locus .
the effect size was small but reproducible in independent samples .
given previous associations between white matter structure and both language - related phenotypes [ 17 ] and iq [ 18 ] , we looked for any correlations between genotypes at the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus and white matter structure .
we found associations in the posterior corpus callosum and cingulum , connecting large sections of the parietal , occipital and temporal cortices .
the widespread connectivity of this white matter region is consistent with a more general effect on both language and intellectual function .
results we analysed 19 snps for association with verbal iq ( viq ) and non - verbal iq ( performance iq ; piq ) in the alspac child cohort ( table 1 ) across the mrpl19 / c2orf3 , kiaa0319 , dcdc2 , atp2c2 and cmip genes ( table 2 ) .
these markers were selected for previously reported associations with reading - and language - related phenotypes [ 11 ] .
we detected significant associations ( p - values < 0.001 ) with viq and the snps rs714939 ( mrpl12 / c2orf3 locus ) and rs6935076 ( kiaa0319 ) .
the rs714939 snp was also the only marker that showed a trend for association with piq ( p = 0.006 ) .
a marker in cmip , rs6564903 , also showed a trend of association for viq ( p = 0.004 ) .
our previous study [ 11 ] showed that kiaa0319 and cmip are associated with a measure of single word reading ( read ) [ 19 ] in a subset of the alspac sample .
given the high correlation between viq and read ( r = 0.571 ; table 1 ) [ 11 ] , it is plausible that the association we observed here was driven by reading ability .
therefore , we included read as covariate when analysing the association with viq ( table 2 ) .
this analysis showed that the associations with rs6935076 ( kiaa0319 ) and rs6564903 ( cmip ) became attenuated , whereas rs714939 remained significantly associated with viq .
therefore , while the association with the kiaa0319 and cmip markers may have been driven by the correlation with reading , the associations at the 2p12 locus appeared to be specific to iq .

another snp at the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus , rs917235 , also showed a trend of association with viq ( table 2 ) .
for both rs917235 and rs714939 , the g alleles are associated with lower performance .
these were the same alleles associated with dyslexia in the original report [ 20 ] .
the most robust association in this previous study was reported for two haplotypes , in different populations , that overlapped for rs917235 and rs714939 ; specifically , the " gg " haplotype formed by these two markers increased susceptibility to dyslexia .
accordingly , we also tested the rs917235 / rs714939 haplotypes for association with viq ( table 3 ) in the alspac cohort .
the " gg " haplotype gave the strongest association with lower viq scores ( p = 0.00009 ) .
when read was used as a covariate , the association became weaker but remained significant ( p = 0.00024 ) .
furthermore , the " aa " haplotype showed significant association with higher viq scores and with an effect size of similar magnitude .

to replicate these results , we tested the mrpl19 / c2orf3 markers for association with viq and piq in four independent samples ( table 4 ) .
we consistently found a trend of association across the four collections , where either of the two originally associated markers had the g allele associated with lower performance .
associations were particularly evident in the sli families ( rs714939 ; p = 0.009 ; piq ) and in the unrelated cases with dyslexia ( rs917235 ; p = 0.0004 ; viq ) .
the same snps did not show association with single word reading measures in previous studies using the same samples [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 21 ] excluding the possibility that these associations are driven by the high correlation between viq and reading ability .
we also re - analysed all of the samples for association with reading using iq as covariate , but again none of the samples including the alspac cohort showed any associations ( data not shown ) .
the unrelated cases with dyslexia was the only sample that showed stronger association with viq , while the other samples showed associations mainly with piq .
the dyslexia families and raine samples only showed a modest trend of association , but it was in the same allelic direction ( rs917235 ; p = 0.064 and rs714939 ; p = 0.059 , respectively ) .
haplotype analysis in all replication sets revealed a similar trend , with the " gg " haplotype associated with lower performance , but did not show associations stronger than single snp analyses ( data not shown ) .

we assessed the effect of genetic variants at the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus on white matter structure in the swedish cohort .
among seven genotyped markers , only rs917235 showed significant association with variation in white matter volume ( pcorrected = 1.27x10 - 3 at cluster level with the threshold of p < 0.01 ) .
specifically , the g allele , already shown to be associated with lower iq , was associated with lower white matter volume .
this white matter cluster was located bilaterally and confined mainly to the posterior part of the corpus callosum and the cingulum ( figure 1a ) .

the significant cluster in the posterior corpus callosum ( figure 1a ) was then used as a seed region for fiber tracking ( see figure 1b for tracking in one individual ) performed in 30 randomly selected subjects .
the pathways from each subject were then overlaid on a common template to identify the most consistent localization of pathways ( figure 1c ) .
next , we identified the parts of cortex that were closest to the end - points of the white matter tracts .
this analysis showed that the pathways passing through the region connected the right postcentral gyrus , superior parietal lobule , precuneous , lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus to analogous areas in the left hemisphere ( figure 1d ) .
discussion we evaluated the effect of candidate genes for rd and sli on measures of general cognitive ability in the alspac cohort .
the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus showed a statistically significant association with general cognitive abilities ( viq and piq ) .
kiaa0319 and cmip variants also showed associations , but these genes have previously been found associated with reading ability in the alspac sample [ 11 ] , hence the associations detected here could be an artefact due to the correlation between viq and measures of single word - reading .
indeed , the associations between the kiaa0319 and cmip markers and viq were attenuated when a reading measure was used as a covariate .
conversely , mrpl19 / c2orf3 markers did not show any association with single - word reading in the alspac cohort [ 11 ] .
furthermore , this association remained significant when reading ability was used as a covariate and is supported by a consistent trend of association with iq in four independent samples .
the association would not stand a genome - wide correction for significance level , but this would be consistent with a recent gwas that predicts multiple and small - size factors contributing to iq [ 16 ] .
our candidate gene approach was based on the selection of previously reported disorder - associated genotypes , suggesting a more generalised effect across multiple cognitive traits .
our interpretation is that the chromosome 2 locus has an effect on cognition by influencing neurodevelopment .
the effect on specific endophenotypes will depend on ascertainment criteria , methodology for phenotypic assessment and differences in genetic background .
all these elements will have a significant role in the outcome of association analyses when sample sizes are relatively small .
to date , only a few common genetic variants have been associated with measures of verbal and nonverbal reasoning .
these include variants in the chrm2 , comt and bdnf genes [ 14 ] .
gwass , which have recently had an enormous success in identifying genetic variants contributing to complex traits , had little success in mapping variants associated with cognitive abilities , with no indication of major genetic contributing loci [ 16 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
the generally accepted model proposes that cognitive abilities are influenced by many genes of small effect [ 24 ] and are therefore difficult to map in the relatively small - sized samples currently available .
gene group - base analysis might be more effective by testing biological functions determined by multiple genes [ 25 ] .
both rs714939 and rs917235 are within an intergenic region between the fam176a and mrpl19 / c2orf3 loci .
the original study associating this locus with dyslexia showed an effect on gene expression of the co - regulated genes mrpl19 and c2orf3 , and differential expression across a set of brain regions [ 20 ] .
these genes are transcribed in a head - to - head orientation on chromosome 2p12 .
visualisation of mrpl19 and c2orf3 in the allen brain atlas ( a resource of human gene expression data derived from 3 post - mortem males aged 24 to 57 years old at time of death ; http :// www.brain - map.org /) , show that these two genes are most highly expressed in white matter of the corpus callosum and the cingulum when compared to all other regions .
this is in contrast to kiaa0319 , cmip and atp2c2 which show very low expression in white matter , and fam176a which shows moderate expression .
there is no direct evidence that these two snps are the causative variants and it is likely that together they tag the effect of a nearby functional factor .
the fam176a gene , also expressed in fetal brain , cannot be ruled out as being influenced by these two snps .
interestingly , rs714939 is located in a region of high h3k4me1 marks ( encode chip - seq data , grch37 / hg19 assembly visualised in the ucsc genome browser ( http :// genome.ucsc.edu / cgi - bin / hggateway )) .
h3k4me1 is a monomethylation of lysin 4 of the h3 histone protein and this modification is often found near regulatory elements .
this region of high h3k4me1 spans 9 - 10 kb and could be involved in the cis - regulation of any of the three neighbouring genes .
the imaging results provide a neural correlate to the genetic polymorphism .
our interpretation is that the genetic variants contribute to structural variation in a relatively large area of white matter which affects both reasoning and reading .
it should be pointed out , however , that this is an association study that does not provide any direction of causality .
it cannot be excluded that genes affect behavior , which in turn affect the white matter .
our neuroimaging analysis revealed a significant association between rs917235 and white matter volume of the posterior part of the corpus callosum and cingulum .
the g allele , associated with lower iq in the behavioural analysis , was specifically associated with lower white matter volume in this region .
previous studies have reported correlations between white matter structure and measures of iq [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , supporting the idea that neural connectivity of the brain is an endophenotype underpinning general intellectual ability [ 18 ] .
tract tracing of fibers passing through the correlated white matter region showed that they establish long - range connections with large regions of the parietal and occipital cortices , and a smaller region within temporo - occipital cortex .
intra - and superior parietal have been associated with performance on reasoning tasks [ 30 ] and the inferior parietal cortex is important for language - related functions [ 31 ] .
the thickness of the splenium of the corpus callosum , which connects large parts of the occipital , parietal and temporal lobes , has been previously associated with intelligence [ 32 ] .
based on parieto - frontal integration theory of intelligence ( p - fit ) [ 30 ] , the lateral cortex and fusiform gyrus from the temporal lobe are involved in cognitive ability since they participate in visual perception , recognition and imagination .
the superior parietal , supramarginal and angular gyri are involved in structural symbolism and abstraction .
these regions are also important for language - related functions .
the posterior part of the corpus callosum has been previously reported as a white matter region with structural differences between normal and dyslexic readers .
[ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
it has been also shown that the posterior part of the corpus callosum is bigger in children with dyslexia rather than in typically developing children [ 37 ] the widespread connectivity of the white matter region associated with rs917235 is thus consistent with the previous neuroimaging associations to both language and general cognitive abilities .
however , substantially more cortical regions and associated brain functions are likely to underlie general cognitive abilities .
the integration of genetics with structural and functional imaging approaches holds potential for further elucidating the effects of genes on the normal and atypical development of cognitive function. with a similar approach we showed that three dyslexia susceptibility genes dyx1c1 , dcdc2 and kiaa0319 are associated with white matter volume in distinct but overlapping regions of the left temporo - parietal hemisphere , and that the white matter volume in these regions also correlated with reading ability [ 38 ] .
a recent study found association between candidate genes for language and reading impairment ( foxp2 and kiaa0319 , respectively ) and regionally specific brain activations assessed with fmri [ 39 ] .
another study reported two independent snp associations , both on chromosome 12 , with brain volume measures as well as suggestive evidence of an effect on cognitive abilities [ 40 ] .
most recently , a study has found a genome - wide significant association between a snp ( rs2298948 ) within c2orf3 ( called gcfc2 in that study ) and hippocampal volume [ 41 ] .
the hippocampus plays an important role in learning and spatial memory , and this is correlated with hippocampus volume .
the association of cognitive abilities with a genetic locus , originally identified as a candidate for dyslexia susceptibility , is independent from a clinical diagnosis of dyslexia and sli .
the association was statistically significant in the alspac sample , which represents the general population , and we did not observe any associations with reading - related measures in either alspac or the other replication samples , including the ones selected for dyslexia or sli .
it is possible that the original association with developmental dyslexia at the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus [ 20 ] was due to a sampling effect and the high correlation between the verbal component of cognitive abilities and reading .
alternatively , the same genetic variants may have different phenotypic effects when combined with alternative genetic or environmental factors and would become apparent in separate sample subgroups .
multivariate genetic analysis have consistently suggested a correlation of about 0.6 between general cognitive ability and learning [ 42 ] but there is less agreement in estimating the effects across the range of the entire phenotypic distribution [ 43 ] .
this would imply that some factors may have specific effects only at the extremes of the phenotype where disorder diagnosis would apply .
in summary , we report an association of measures of general cognitive abilities with the chromosome 2p12 locus implicated in dyslexia .
we show , for the first time , that the same genetic locus is associated with white matter volume in the posterior corpus callosum .
furthermore , fibers throughout this region connected cortical regions involved in both language and general cognitive abilities .
follow - up studies might identify the functional genetic variant ( s ) and the gene ( s ) implicated .
such findings will contribute to our understanding of the biological pathways underlying normal and atypical cognition and the possible shared factor ( s ) mediating general cognitive functions and highly prevalent developmental disorders such as dyslexia .
materials and methods ethics statement informed written consent was obtained from the parents , with the option for them or their children to withdraw at any time .
ethical approval for the alspac cohort was obtained from the alspac law and ethics committee and the local research ethics committees .
ethical approval for the slic cohort was granted by local ethics committees .
ethical approval for the oxford / reading and aston studies was acquired from the oxfordshire psychiatric research ethics committee ( oprec o01.02 ) .
for the raine study , participant recruitment and all follow - ups of the study families were approved by the human ethics committee at king edward memorial hospital and / or princess margaret hospital for children in perth .
for the swedish sample , the study was approved by the ethics board of the karolinska university hospital ( stockholm ) .
initial sample the alspac cohort consists of over 14,000 children from the southwest of england that had expected dates of delivery between 1st april 1991 and 31st december 1992 [ 44 ]. from age 7 years , all children were annually assessed for a wide range of physical , behavioural , and neuropsychological traits , including reading and language - related measures .
dna is available for approximately 11,000 children .
for this study , individuals with a non - white ancestry were excluded and after filtering for missing genotypic or phenotypic data we conducted the analysis in a sample of 5905 children .
cognitive ability was assessed using the wechsler intelligence scales for children ( wisc - iii ) [ 45 ] for both verbal and performance iq ( viq and piq , respectively ; table 1 ) .
the viq scale included the subtests for information , similarities , arithmetic , vocabulary , comprehension and digit span .
the piq scale included the subtests for picture completion , coding , picture arrangement , block design and object assembly .
replication samples the sli consortium ( slic ) cohort has been described in detail previously [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
this family - based sample includes approximately 400 individuals from 181 families .
the samples were assessed at one of five separate centres across the uk : the newcomen centre at guy 's hospital , london , the cambridge language and speech project ( clasp [ 49 ]) , the child life and health department at the university of edinburgh [ 50 ] , the department of child health at the university of aberdeen and the manchester language study [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
cognitive ability of all children in the slic sample was assessed using the wisc - iii [ 45 ] applying the same viq and piq subtests listed for alspac .
in the slic sample , the piq score ( cut - off at piq > 80 ) was used to exclude children whose language problems were accompanied by deficits in non - verbal skills .
the dyslexia - based sample has been described previously [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
it includes 684 siblings from 288 unrelated nuclear families and 282 unrelated cases with dyslexia , recruited through the dyslexia research centre clinics in oxford and reading , and the aston dyslexia and development assessment centre in birmingham .
viq and piq were obtained from the bas similarities and bas matrices subtests respectively [ 55 ] .
the similarities sub - scale of the wechsler adult intelligence scales ( wais ) , a measure analogous to the bas similarities test , was used when age was > 17.5 years [ 45 ] .
the western australian pregnancy cohort ( raine ) study is a longitudinal investigation of 2900 pregnant women and their offspring recruited between 1989 and 1991 [ 56 ]. from the original cohort , 2868 children have been followed over two decades .
the raine sample is representative of the larger australian population ( 88 % caucasian ) ; only those children with both biological parents of white european origin were included in the current analyses .
verbal and non - verbal ability was assessed at 10 years of age using the peabody picture vocabulary test - revised ( ppvt - r ) [ 57 ] and the raven 's coloured progressive matrices ( rcpm ) [ 58 ] , respectively .
the ppvt - r provides a measure of receptive vocabulary , requiring children to select which of four pictures corresponds to an aurally presented word .
raw scores are converted to a verbal iq , standardized for age 2 years and above ( based around a mean of 100 and a sd of 15 ) .
rcpm is a 36 item multiple choice test that presents a matrix - like arrangement of figural symbols and requires the child to select the missing symbols from a set of six alternatives .
raw scores are converted to percentiles , which provide an indication of performance relative to other children of a similar age .
this assessment is standardized for children between 4.9 and 12.0 years of age .
the swedish sample used for neuroimaging consists of 76 swedish speaking children and young adults ( age range 6 to 25 years ) randomly selected from the " brainchild " study , a longitudinal study of typical development [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
the participants were from the population register in the town of nynashamn , sweden , and showed no evidence of neurological or psychological disorders .
dna was available for all subjects .
genotyping and statistical analysis we analysed 19 snps across the mrpl19 / c2orf3 , kiaa0319 , dcdc2 , atp2c2 and cmip loci that were recently genotyped in the alspac child cohort [ 11 ] .
the sample size in the present study is larger because we did not apply an iq filter as described in the previous analysis .
snps were genotyped using either sequenom iplex assays according to the manufacturer 's instructions or the kbiosciences service using their in - house technology ( http :// www.kbioscience.co.uk /) .
the genotyping in the samples selected for dyslexia and sli was conducted with sequenom iplex assays as part of previous studies [ 9 ] .
for the raine study , dna samples were genotyped on an illumina 660 quad array [ 61 ] .
for the swedish sample , seven snps ( rs3088180 , rs4853169 , rs917235 , rs6732511 , rs714939 , rs17689640 and rs17689863 ) located at the mrpl19 / c2orf3 locus were genotyped using the sequenom iplex system as previously described [ 59 ] .
quantitative analyses were performed within plink ( 1.07 ) [ 62 ] using additive tests of association .
we included two additional phenotypes ( viq and piq ) to the multiple testing correction applied in our previous study of the alspac sample [ 11 ] which corrected for the analysis of 11 clusters of snps showing significant linkage disequilibrium ( ld ; r2 > 0.6 ) and 2 phenotypes .
therefore we corrected here the significance level of p = 0.05 for 44 independent tests ( 11 snp clusters analysed for four phenotypes ) resulting in p = 0.001 .
the alspac cohort has been tested previously for other snps and phenotypes , therefore these tests should be considered in calculating a significant threshold p - value , or the genome - significant threshold of 5x10 - 8 should be applied .
however , this would be too conservative for the scope of this study which analyses previously reported genetic markers and tests a specific hypothesis rather than conducting an explorative exercise .
family - based cohorts were analysed using qtdt [ 63 ] .
image analysis for the swedish sample , three - dimensional structural t1 - weighted imaging with magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo sequence ( tr = 2300 ms , te = 2.92 ms , 256x256 mm , 176 sagittal slices and 1 mm3 voxel size ) with the field of view of 256x256 mm , 256 slices , and 1 mm3 voxel size was carried out on all the participants and repeated two years later for 69 subjects .
white matter segmentation , followed by an alignment technique , was performed on the structural data using the diffeomorphic anatomical registration using exponentiated lie algebra ( dartel ) toolbox in spm ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm / software / spm5 ) .
images were then spatially smoothed with an 8 mm gaussian kernel .
the dartel outputs are white matter segmented images which reflect the signal intensity modulated by volume transformations applied to individual images to register them into the mni template .
diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) was also acquired using a field of view 230x230 mm , matrix size 128x128 mm , 19 slices with 6.5 mm thickness b - max 1000 s / mm2 in 20 directions .
eddy current and head motion were corrected using affine registration to a reference volume using fsl ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk / fsl /) .
the diffusion tensors were then computed for each voxel and the dti and fractional anisotropy ( fa ) data were then constructed .
the seven snps were entered separately as a main factor in a flexible factorial design second - level spm analysis .
this included both the individual images with and without repeated measures , to assess the variation of white matter with respect to the genetic markers and was corrected for the effect of age , sex , handedness and total white matter volume .
age x gene and gender x gene interaction effects were also included in the model .
as a part of this exploratory analysis , the significance level was corrected at the cluster level using non - stationary cluster extent correction [ 64 ] for multiple comparisons resulting from searching the entire white matter volume as well as for the seven snps ( bonferroni correction , pcorrected < 0.0014 for comparison of searching the entire brain with a threshold of p < 0.01 , as implemented in the spm software ) .
the region showing the significant effect was saved as a binary region of interest ( roi ) .
this roi was then transformed to each individual 's dti space , to be used as a seed roi for white matter fiber tracking .
deterministic fiber tracking was applied on 30 randomly selected subjects by starting tractography from the roi following the principal eigenvector direction using 1 mm steps , considering thresholds of 0.15 for fa values and 30 for angular degree using exploredti v4.7.3 .
( www.exploredti.com ) .
computed tracts from all individuals were then averaged across all 30 participants to derive a probabilistic map of the white matter pathways passing through the overlapping areas .

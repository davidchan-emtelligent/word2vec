spw - rs are known to result from a complex interplay between local and upstream hippocampal ensembles .
however , the key mechanisms that underlie these events remain partly unknown .
in this work , we introduce a reduced , but realistic multi - compartmental model of the macaque monkey 's hippocampal ca3 - ca1 network .
the model consists of two semi - linear layers , each consisting of two - compartmental pyramidal neurons and one - compartmental perisomatic - targeting basket cells .
connections in the network were modeled as ampa synapses , based on physiological and anatomical data .
notably , while auto - association fibers were prevalent in ca3 , ca1 connectivity - inspired by recent findings - implemented a " feedback and reciprocal inhibition " , dominated by recurrent inhibition and pyramidal cells - interneurons synapses .
spw - r episodes emerge spontaneously in the ca1 subfield lfp ( which is assumed proportional to transmembrane currents across all compartments and medium resistivity ) : episodes of short - lived high - frequency oscillations ( ripples , 80 - 180 hz ) on top of a massive dendritic depolarization (< 20 hz ) with visual and quantitative characteristics observed experimentally [ 1 ] .
concomitantly , the ca3 subfield lfp presents episodes of quasi - synchronous neuronal bursting in the form of gamma episodes ( 25 - 75 hz ) .
the model reveals a lower bound for the minimal network that may generate spw - r activity , and predicts a large number of features of in vivo hippocampal recordings in macaque monkeys [ 1 ] .
spike - lfp coherence analysis in ca1 displays reliable synchrony of spiking activity in the ripple lfp frequency band , suggesting that modeled spw - r episodes reflect a genuine network oscillatory regime .
interestingly , interneuronal firing shows coherence increases concomitant with the beginning and the end of the spw - r event , together with increases over gamma frequencies .
the model suggests that activity of both pyramidal neurons and interneurons is critical for the local genesis and dynamics of physiological spw - r activity .
unlike other models , we found that it is interneuronal silence , not interneuronal firing that triggers these fast oscillatory events , in line with the fact that unbalanced excitability of selected pyramidal cells marks the beginning of single network episodes .
interneuronal silence quickly increases population firing of pyramidal cells .
the interneuronal population activity increases with some latency due to the unbalanced excitatory drive , becoming pivotal to pyramidal cell activity , and further pacing pyramidal cells due to interneuronal fast kinetic properties .
our modeled data suggests that this effect is possibly mediated by a silencing - and - rebound - excitation mechanism , maintaining the frequency of the field oscillation bounded to the ripple range .
the reduced model suggests a simple mechanism for the occurrence of spw - rs , in light of recent experimental evidence .
we provide new insights into the dynamics of the hippocampal ca3 - ca1 network during ripples , and the relation between neuronal circuits' activity at meso - and microscopic scales .
finally , our model exhibits characteristic cell type - specific activity that might be critical for the emergence of physiological spw - r activity and therefore , for the formation of hippocampus - dependent memory representations .

the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of methylthiouracil ( mtu ) on the proliferation and apoptosis of rat bone marrow stromal cells ( bmscs ) .
rat bmscs were isolated , cultured in vitro and treated with various concentrations of mtu .
cell growth curves were determined using the cell counting kit - 8 method and the effect of mtu on bmscs in a logarithmic growth phase was observed .
bmsc apoptosis following mtu treatment was detected by flow cytometry .
the experimental results demonstrated that the proliferation - inhibition effect was gradually enhanced with increasing mtu concentrations and the extension of treatment time .
statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment and the control groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , the bmsc apoptosis rate gradually increased with increasing drug concentrations and treatment time extension ; statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment and the control groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
therefore , the results of the present study demonstrated that mtu inhibited the proliferation of bmscs and promoted apoptosis , indicating the cytotoxic effects of mtu on bmscs .
methylthiouracil bone marrow stromal cells proliferation apoptosis introduction hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) are an important index that reflect the function and status of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow , the growth of which requires a number of stimulation factors ( 1,2 ) .
it has been reported that > 10 types of cell growth factors exist with various stimulation effects .
cell growth factors are part of a complex system that has several influencing factors ( 3 - 5 ) .
the secretion , release and function of cell growth factors depend on the hematopoietic microenvironment , which is important for hsc growth and development .
bone marrow stromal cells ( bmscs ) are the main components of the hematopoietic microenvironment .
thus , studying the effects of bmscs on hematopoiesis is important for investigating the hematopoietic function and microenvironment status .
bmscs constitute the main backbone of the bone marrow microenvironment ( bmm ) and perform a variety of functions involved with extracellular matrix secretion , cell surface adhesion , cytokine solubility and membrane connectivity .
bmscs can regulate and control their proliferation , differentiation and survival by adhering to hscs ( 6,7 ). whether under physiological status or stress conditions , the structural and functional integrity of bmscs is important for maintaining stability and reconstructing hematopoietic function in organisms ( 8,9 ) .
a lack of bmscs may result in the apoptosis of partially immature b lymphocytes ( 10 ) .
methylthiouracil ( mtu ; chemical name , 6 - methyl - 2 - thiourea pyrimidine ; aladdin co. , ltd. , chengdu , china ) is one of the mostly commonly used medicines for the treatment of hyperthyroidism ( 11 ) .
antithyroid drugs have been shown to damage and poison the circulatory system , among which myelosuppression is the most severe effect ( 12,13 ) .
these factors indicate that mtu affects hscs to a varying degree .
however , there are no studies investigating whether mtu affects the bmm , which hscs depend on to survive , as well as the essential components of the bmm , which are the bmscs .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of mtu on bmsc proliferation and apoptosis .
materials and methods animals specific - pathogen free sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats were provided by the laboratory animal center of guangdong medical college ( zhanjiang , china ) .
the rats were aged between 3 and 4 weeks , weighed 100 - 120 g and were selected without gender limitation .
the study was conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health .
the animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of guangdong medical college .
isolation and cultivation of bmscs in vitro sd rats weighing 100 - 120 g were selected for the study .
bone marrow mononuclear cells were extracted and the karyocyte concentration was adjusted to 2x105 cells / ml. the samples were then inoculated in 25 cm2 plastic culture flasks .
these cells were the primary cells and designated as the p0 generation .
the p0 generation was cultivated in an incubator with conditions of 5 % co2 under a saturated humidity of 37degreesc .
following inoculation for 72 h , semiliquid exchange was conducted and the medium was changed every 2 days until 80 - 90 % of the cells fused with each other , at which the digestion passage was able to be processed .
inoculative cell passage was then performed at a ratio of 1:2 and the cells were designated as the p1 generation .
the culture fluid of the cell passage was changed every 2 or 3 days until the cells fused with each other and spread over the bottom of the flask .
the aforementioned procedure was then repeated. by parity of reasoning , the next generation was considered the second bmsc generation and marked as the p2 generation .
subsequent cells following the p2 generation were all cultivated with 10 % cell culture fluid .

next , 10 mul mtt solution ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to each well and the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37degreesc following mixing .
the supernatant was removed and 150 mul dimethyl sulfoxide solution was added to each well .
following oscillation using a microdosis oscillator for 10 min , the optical density ( od ) of each group was detected with a danny microplate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. the results were recorded and the bmsc growth curve was plotted with time as the x - axis and od as the y - axis .
detection of bmsc proliferation well - grown bmscs in a logarithmic growth phase were collected for the experimental study .
the cell concentration was adjusted to 3 - 5x104 cells / ml and the samples were inoculated in a 96 - well plate with six repeated wells for each group .
the celliferous nutrient solution of the negative control group was added to 100 mul cell culture fluid ( 10 %) , whereas the cells of the experimental groups were added to 90 mul cell culture fluid ( 10 %) with 10 mul mtu solution at a concentration of 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 or 320 mmol / l. a blank control well was prepared for each group .
following inoculation , the cells were cultivated in an incubator with 5 % co2 at 37degreesc for 12 , 36 or 48 h. subsequently , 10 mul cell counting kit - 8 ( cck - 8 ; guangzhou weijia bio co. , ltd. , guangzhou , china ) solution was added to each well and further incubated for an additional 2 or 3 h at 37degreesc .
the od values of each group were detected using a danny microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm. the results were recorded and the bmsc growth curve was plotted with the mtu concentration as the x - axis and od as the y - axis .

results morphological observations of bmscs the extracorporeal whole bone marrow adherent method is an effective and practical method for isolating and cultivating bmscs .
the method is based on various morphological observational studies on bmscs under an inverted phase contrast microscope ( 14,15 ) .
the inoculated bmscs were spherical and had various volumes .
the cells had transparent somas , but exhibited the appearance of cell growth process and were suspended in a culture flask with peripheral hemocyte series , including erythrocytes .
bmscs partially adhered to the flask wall after 12 h of cultivation .
in the initial stage , the bmscs had a short rod - like shape , which became short and fusiform and gradually presented with a fibroblast appearance .
rapid cell growth was observed between day 5 and 7 with typical colony formation .
these cells were colony forming unit - fibroblasts .
cells in the center of the colony steadily increased between day 8 and 10 , with close permutation and homogeneous morphology of spindle and polygon shapes. between day 12 and 14 , with the increase in the number of cell colonies , cells closely attached with each other and arranged in a direction along the long axis of the cell body , presenting with reticulate or vorticose shapes .
the cells were due for passage when they fused to the monolayer gradually until they spread over the bottom of the flask .
the cells began to adhere to the flask wall following cell passage for 1 - 2 h , with cell morphology ranging between round and spindle shapes .
the cells spread over the bottom of the flask between day 3 and 4 and exhibited more homogeneous morphology .
the next passage was then processed , at which the suspended erythrocytes and other hemocyte series were removed along with fluid exchange , consequently achieving cell purification .
the bmscs were partially adhered to the flask wall after 12 h of cultivation .
in the initial stage , the bmscs had a short rod - like shape , which became short and fusiform , and gradually presented with a fibroblast appearance .
rapid cell growth was observed between day 5 and 7 with typical colony formation .
these cells were colony forming unit - fibroblasts , in the center of the colony steadily increased between day 8 and 10 , with close permutation and homogeneous morphology of spindle and polygon shapes. between day 12 and 14 , with the increase in the number of cell colonies , cells closely attached with each other and arranged in a direction along the long axis of the cell body , presenting with reticulate or vorticose shapes .
the cells were due for passage when they fused to the monolayer gradually until they spread over the bottom of the flask ( fig. 1 ) .
detection of cell surface antigens by fcm fcm results are shown in fig. 2. the positive rates of cd34 , cd45 and cd90 were 3.9 , 5.00 and 95.60 % , respectively .
growth curve of bmscs the proliferative growth rates of the p3 and p5 bmsc generations were observed and the results were plotted as growth curves using the mmt method .
the results are shown in fig. 3. common features with similar sigmoid growth curves were identified. fig. 3 demonstrates that the od values varied slightly between day 1 and 2 following inoculation .
proliferation was not evident , whereas the od values varied markedly between day 3 and 5 , indicating that cell proliferation was more intensive than during the logarithmic growth phase .
od values started to increase from day 6 and gradually entered the platform phase .
cells in a logarithmic growth phase were selected for further experimental study .
effect of mtu on bmsc proliferation mtu solutions of various concentrations ( 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 and 320 mmol / l ) were incubated with bmscs for 12 , 36 and 48 h. the effects on proliferation were detected using the cck - 8 method ( table i and fig. 4 ) and the results indicated that mtu inhibited bmsc proliferation .
at an mtu concentration of 40 mmol / l , the cell proliferation - inhibition rate steadily increased with increasing drug concentrations .
significant differences were identified between the control and the various treatment groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
the proliferation - inhibition effect was most significant when the action time was 48 h. effect of mtu on bmsc apoptosis following the incubation of bmscs with mtu solutions of various concentrations ( 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 and 320 mmol / l ) for 48 h , the apoptosis effect was detected by fcm ( table ii and fig. 5 ) .
the results indicated that at an mtu concentration of 40 mmol / l , the cell apoptosis rate steadily increased with increasing drug concentrations .
significant differences were identified between the control and the various treatment groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
discussion the present study adopted a whole bone marrow adherent method to conduct in vitro separation and cultivation of bmscs in sd rats .
as normative surgery , the method was able to complete the separation , extraction and cultivation within a short time , thus , promoting rapid cell proliferation and passage stabilization .
in addition , the method was convenient , economical , less invasive and obtained various types of matrix cell groups ( 16 ) .
in the present study , when the bmscs adherently grew , the suspended hscs and other cells were gradually eliminated with the solution replacement. through cell passage , purified and amplified fibroblast - like cells were finally obtained with adherent growth and rapid proliferation ( fig. 1 ) , according to the observed morphological features .
fcm results indicated that the obtained cells showed positive expression for cd90 , whereas negative expression was observed for cd34 and cd45 .
this result was in accordance with previous studies ( 17,18 ) and indicated that cultivated cells conform with the immunological marker features of bmscs ( 19 ) .
the mtt method was used in the current study ( 20 ) to detect the proliferation of p3 and p5 bmsc generations .
the corresponding growth curves are shown in fig. 3. proliferation was solely observed during the incubation period , whereas multiple proliferations occurred during the exponential phase .
this phase is the most vital period and was also the optimum phase for the current study .
as the cells approached inhibition , they entered a plateau phase at which cell density saturation was reached .
cell proliferation stopped with the gradual depletion of nutrient sources in the culture solution and the accumulation of metabolites .
therefore , cells in an exponential phase were selected for empirical study .
bmscs are the other type of stem cell present in the bone marrow , aside from hscs .
bmscs provide indispensable support for the survival and functionalization of hscs .
currently , various methods are available for the isolation of bmscs , which can then be used for further study ( 16 ) .
however , different methods result in varying effects ( 18,21 ) .
the present study demonstrated that a delay in bone marrow recovery may be relevant to the injury of bone marrow stroma .
a leukemic mouse model previously demonstrated that a leukemic microenvironment can inhibit the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells , thus , improving and maintaining the proliferation and long - term survival of leukemic cells ( 22 ). by inhibiting the immunosuppressive function of cyclin d2 , bmscs can block leukemic cells at the g0 / g1 phase of the cell cycle ( 23 ) .
a cck - 8 kit was used in the current study to detect the effects of various concentrations of mtu on the proliferation - inhibition rate of bmscs following incubation for 12 , 36 and 48 h. mtu may be dissolved in ammonia solution or hydroxide alkaline solution .
in the present study , 1 mol / l sodium hydroxide solution was selected to prepare the mtu solution and 10 % fresh cell culture solution was diluted to the required concentration .
several concentrations of mtu were used at relatively large gradients since no previous studies on the application of mtu for in vitro cell experiments were identified .
the cck - 8 method was performed to observe the proliferation status and to narrow the selection for a suitable medical concentration , according to the observational results .
when 640 mmol / l mtu solution was added to the culture solution containing the cells , a large number of floating bmscs were observed under an inverted phase contrast microscope .
therefore , this concentration was disregarded .
the detection results of the cck - 8 kit are shown in table i. at a final concentration of 10 or 20 mmol / l , the od values gradually increased , but there were no statistically significant differences when compared with the control group ( p > 0.05 ) .
this result indicates that low concentrations of mtu have no effect on cell proliferation .
at an mtu concentration of 40 mmol / l , the od values decreased with increasing drug concentrations and this difference was statistically significant when compared with the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
comparisons among the groups that had been subjected to various action times also revealed statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) , indicating that cell proliferation inhibition with mtu was time - dependent .
the 48 h group exhibited the lowest od value and showed statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) when compared with the 12 and 36 h groups .
this result may be relevant to the chronergy of drug metabolism .
therefore , an action time of 48 h can be selected for follow - up empirical study of cell apoptosis .
an annexin v - fitc / pi double - color apoptosis kit was used to detect changes in cell apoptosis following the incubation of bmscs with various concentrations of mtu for 48 h. as shown in fig. 2 , when compared with the control group , no statistically significant differences were observed at mtu concentrations of 10 and 20 mmol / l ( p > 0.05 ) , indicating that these concentrations had no effect on the early apoptotic rate of the cells .
at an mtu concentration of 40 mmol / l , the apoptotic rate increased with increasing drug concentrations ; the differences were statistically significant when compared with the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
differences identified through comparisons among the various groups were statistically significant , indicating that mtu solutions at a certain concentration can dose - dependently promote the apoptosis of bmscs .
in conclusion , mtu inhibits bmsc proliferation and promotes bmsc apoptosis .
bmscs are an important element in the bmm , indicating that mtu may cause changes in the medullary hematopoiesis microenvironment .
this effect can influence the proliferation , differentiation and maturation of stem cells and their peripheral blood release or apoptosis ( 22,23 ) .
the promotion effect of mtu on bmsc proliferation and apoptosis also indicates that mtu may exert certain toxic effects on bmscs ( 24 ) .
this observation indicates that a side effect of bone marrow suppression may result from the treatment of hyperthyroidism with mtu .
however , the toxicity of mtu has provided novel ideas in the search for cytotoxic drugs .

psoriasis is a common , genetically determined inflammatory and proliferative disease of the skin .
psychological stress can exacerbate the disease .
this study sought to investigate the depression and anxiety disorders among patients with psoriasis and control group. method .
in this hospital - based case - control study , one hundred patients with psoriasis ( case ) referred to the dermatology department and 100 patients with otolaryngology problems and dermatological healthy volunteers ( control ) who referred to the otolaryngology department of bouali sina hospital in sari , iran , in 2007 were studied .
demographic characteristics were recorded .
beck depression inventory and spielberger state - trait anxiety scale i - ii were administered to the patients in both groups .
data were analyzed using spss statistical software and descriptive statistical tests. results. from one - hundred patients in each group , 44 ( 45 %) were men .
depression score was 67 % and 12 % in psoriatic patients and control , respectively .
the beck depression scores of patients with psoriasis were significantly higher than scores of the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
based on spielberger state - trait anxiety scale , anxiety was found in 45 % of patients in case group and 18 % of controls. conclusion .
the results revealed that psoriatic patients reported significantly higher degrees of depression and anxiety than controls .
in addition , psoriatic women were more depressed than psoriatic men .
1. introduction psoriasis is a skin disorder affecting approximately 1 - 6 % ( mean 3 %) of populations in the world .
two - peak age of onset was considered for the disease ; the early age of onset is between 16 - 22 years , and latent age of onset is between 57 - 60 years .
the incidence of psoriasis in adult men and women and among different races is equal .
however , females tend to develop the disease earlier than males .
there are several classes of psoriasis including : psoriasis vulgaris , guttate psoriasis , generalized pustular psoriasis , disseminated erythrodermic psoriasis , scalp psoriasis , palms and soles psoriasis , nail psoriasis , arthropathic psoriasis , and verse psoriasis .
it is believed that a combination of several factors contribute to the development of this disease .
genetic factors , trauma , infection , certain medicines , such as nonsteroid anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , beta - blockers , antimalaria medicine , and lithium , endocrine factors , sunlight , metabolic factors , alcohol , cigarette , and psychological factors have been found in development of psoriasis [ 1 ] .
there is strongly clinical evidence that stress can play a role on the onset and exacerbation of psoriasis [ 2 - 5 ] .
in a study on psoriatic patients , 60 % of the patients strongly believed that stress was a causal factor for their psoriasis [ 6 ] .
psoriasis makes stress itself , and in turn , stress can worsen psoriasis .
however , most psoriatic patients who reported episodes of psoriasis precipitated by stress describe disease - related stress , resulting from the cosmetic disfigurement and social stigma of psoriasis [ 1 ] .
psoriasis is associated with a variety of psychological problems .
so , considering the psychosocial aspects of the disease is very important in psoriatic patients [ 7 ] .
according to previous controlled studies , the prevalence of depression was ranged from 0 to 58 % in psoriasis patients [ 3 ] .
one study has demonstrated that female psoriatic patients appear to be more vulnerable to develop depression than males .
the prevalence of anxiety is higher than depression in psoriatic patients .
even psoriatic patients have reported significantly higher degrees of anxiety than other chronic diseases such as cancers .
furthermore , the severity of anxiety would be greater in patients with palms and soles psoriasis [ 3 ] .
psoriasis is associated with a variety of personality disorders .
on the other hand , psychological stress can induce resistance to regular psoriatic treatment and causes psoriasis to appear worse .
in this view , psoriasis is an inflammatory disease with expensive and long - term therapies , and as mentioned before , psychosocial stress can exacerbate the disease .
so that , recognition and treatment of the psychosocial problems can decrease _ health care costs and shorten the therapeutic period .
therefore , we decided to compare depression and anxiety disorders in patients with psoriasis and the control group .
2. materials and methods in this hospital - based case - control study , all participants were patients who referred to department of dermatology at booali sina hospital in sari / iran during 2007 .
the ethics committee of mazandaran university of medical sciences approved the study protocol .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants .
diagnosis of psoriasis was based on clinical examination by a dermatologist and confirmed by histological examination of the lesions by a pathologist .
the control group consisted of 100 patients referred to the otolaryngology department of the hospital with no dermatology problems at the same time .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : other dermatologic diseases , individuals with mental retardation or cognitive and speech disorders .
each group were matched by variables including age and sex .
a dermatologist confirmed the diagnosis of psoriasis based on observations and clinical findings .
biopsy was taken from suspected lesions and sent to the pathology center of the hospital .
for the patients whose samples were positive after h & e stain and microscopic examination ( hyperkeratosis , severe parakeratosis , hypogranulosis or absence of granular layer , suprapapillary epidermal thinning , dilated tortuous papillary capillaries , microscopic collection of polymorphonuclear white blood cells in stratum corneum layer ( munro abscess ) or in the malpighian layer ( kogoj abscess ) , pericapillary infiltration of lymphocyte and neutrophils ) appropriate treatment was started .
in addition , a dermatologist examined the control group for presence of dermatological diseases .
demographic characteristics such as sex , age , job , level of education , type and site of lesions , and extension of the disease were recorded .
then the patients in both case and control groups were evaluated by the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) and spielberger state - trait anxiety scale ( stai i - ii ) questionnaires .
suspected cases with depression or anxiety based on bdi and stai i - ii tests were referred to a psychiatrist for clinical diagnosis .
the psychiatrist performed semi structural clinical interview according to dsm iv - tr to determine existence and / or type of disorder .
the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) is a 21 - item self - reporting scale developed to measure the severity of depression .
each item gets scores ranging from 0 - 3 .
the score for depression can vary from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 63 .
in this study , the bdi score of more than 17 was considered as presence of depression and referred to the psychiatrist .
then clinical interview was performed to identify type of psychiatry disorders based on dsm iv. content validity of bdi has been extensively tested and confirmed by previous studies [ 8 ] .
the state - trait anxiety inventory ( stai ) is a self - report assessment device , which includes separate measures of state and trait anxiety .
it is a 40 - item scale made up of two 20 - item subscales ( one state and one trait ) to assess the anxiety .
the state anxiety scale describes the individual 's feelings at a particular time and under particular conditions , whereas the trait anxiety scale describes the usual feelings of the individual .
each stai item is given a weighted score of 1 to 4 .
a rating of 4 indicates the presence of high levels of anxiety for some items , and the scoring weights for the anxiety - absent items are reversed .
scores for both the s - anxiety and the t - anxiety scales can vary from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 80 .
the score > 43 was considered as presence of anxiety and was referred to the psychiatrist .
to identify type of psychiatric disorders , clinical interview was done using dsma iv. content validity of stai has been confirmed by previous studies [ 9 ] .
known psoriatic patients were followed and they received proper treatment .
all analyses were performed using spss software and chi 2 tests .
3. results there were 100 patients ( 44 males ( 45 %) and 56 females ( 55 %)) in the case and control groups .
their age range was between 20 and 50 with a mean of 34.28 +/ - 15.50 and 34.45 +/ - 14.4 in case and control , respectively .
in the control group , 5.2 % were at elementary - junior high school education level , 9.3 % were in grade high school , 24.7 % were diploma , and 60.8 % had university education level .
the education levels in the case group were as follows : elementary - junior high school 23.5 % , high school 15.3 % , diploma and university education level were 34.7 % and 26.5 % , respectively .
there was no evidence for chronic diseases such as hypertension , diabetes , asthma , and rheumatic disorders in history of the patients in the case and control groups .
there was no history of drug users in either of the studied groups .
ninety - nine ( 99 %) were on topical therapy while the other one ( 1 %) were receiving systemic as well as topical therapy .
ninety - five ( 95 %) were plaque psoriasis ( psoriasis vulgaris ) , three ( 3 %) guttate [ guh - tate ] psoriasis , one ( 1 %) inverse psoriasis , and one ( 1 %) pustular psoriasis .
there was no erythrodermic psoriasis or psoriasis arthritis .
duration of the disease was less than one year among all the psoriatic patients .
the spielberger questionnaires indicated that 45 % and 18 % of case and control groups had anxiety , respectively ( figure 1 ) .
this finding was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) .
psoriatic patients showed higher level of anxiety than the control group .
there was no relationship between anxiety and sex , education level , and employment in the case group , and we found no significant statistical differences ( table 1 ) .
the beck depression questionnaires indicated that 67 % and 12 % of the patients in the case and control groups had depression , respectively .
this result demonstrated significant differences between both case and control groups ( p < 0.001j ) ( figure 1 ) .
the case group was assessed for relationship between depression and sex , education level , and employment , but there was no statistical significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) .
in the case group , depression was found in 11 of employer 's patients , 11 school or university students , 9 homemakers , and 2 unemployed .
this finding was also significant statistically ( p = 0.008 ) .
excluding demographic characteristics such as age , sex , job , and education , the risk of psoriatic disease related to anxiety and depression would have been 4.6 times ( 2.11 - 11.7 ) and 6 times ( 2.37 - 17.41 ) of healthy subjects , respectively .
according to semi - structural interview by the psychiatrist , psychiatry disorders included 43 mixed anxiety and depression disorder ( 43 %) , 9 mild major depression disorder ( 9 %) , 7 adjustment disease ( 7 %) , 4 social phobia ( 4 %) , and 37 no mental disorder ( 37 %) in the case group , but 8 mixed anxiety depression ( 8 %) , 4 adjustment disease , and 88 no mental disorder were found in the control group which signifies the difference between the two groups ( p < 0 / 001 ) .
4. discussion according to beck depression inventory ( bdi ) and spielberger state - trait anxiety scale ( stai ) , psoriatic patients had higher degrees of depression and anxiety than normal subjects .
in addition , psoriatic women reported higher degrees of depression than psoriatic men.that is similar to the results of akay et al. [ 10 ] .
naldi et al .
[ 11 ] , in a case - control study , found that family history of psoriasis , stressful life events , and recent infectious diseases ( like streptococcal pharyngitis group b ) are risk factors for a first episode of guttate psoriasis ; the results of our study confirm this finding .
the role of stressful life events in the development of guttate psoriasis is estimated 1.7 % ( 0.8 - 3.6 ) and an increased comorbidity with pharyngeal infection was found in patients with guttate psoriasis , whereas our results revealed that comorbidity with anxiety and different kinds of psoriasis is 4.6 % ( 2.11 - 11.7 ) .
sampogna et al. in 2006 have studied the effects of age , gender , quality of life , and psychological distress in 936 hospitalized patients with psoriasis .
they divided patients into two age groups : younger than 65 years , and older than 65 years .
they found that the older psoriatic patients had lower quality of life and they were exposed to more stressful life events .
in addition , women reported more depression than men [ 1 , 12 ] .
in another study by zachariae et al. , on quality of life ( qol ) in 6497 nordic patients with psoriasis , psoriatic women had lower qol than psoriatic men [ 13 ] .
similar to ours , o'leary et al. ' s study showed that the magnitude of anxiety and depression in patients with psoriasis is higher than that in healthy individuals , but they found no association between severities of psoriasis with anxiety [ 14 ] , whereas harvima et al. found an association between psychological stress and clinical severity and symptoms in psoriatic patients .
they had found patients with significant psychological distress who had more severe dermatologic lesions and particular defects .
the sample size in o'leary and harvima studies was 141 and 38 patients , respectively .
therefore , the sample size may lead into different results [ 13 , 15 ] .
taner et al. in 2007 compared the rate of depression and anxiety in patients with behcet 's disease and in patients with psoriasis .
the results of their study revealed that the prevalence of anxiety in young patients with behcet 's disease was higher than that in the psoriatic patients [ 16 ] .
furthermore , there was a positive correlation between the severity of psychological symptoms and longer duration of the disease in patients with behcet 's disease .
however , there was no correlation between the duration of illness and psychological symptoms in patients with psoriasis .
our study had two unique aspects .
although all previous studies believed that anxiety and depression have been effective on incidence of psoriasis , in our study , the risk of developing psoriasis at presence of anxiety and depression was investigated regardless to age , sex , profession , and education level of the patients .
a clinical interview was performed to identify the type of psychiatry disorders based on dsm iv. in addition , we investigated the correlation between job and education level on incidence of depression and anxiety in the psoriatic patients .
though there was no correlation between the education level and incidence of depression and anxiety , lower depression levels were observed in employed patients .
there were some limitations in our study .
for example , the profession and education levels were interventional variables that were not matched between the two studied groups .
besides , the study only included the new cases of psoriatic patients with depression and anxiety who referred to the psychiatrist after completing the questionnaire .
in addition , psychiatry problems such as schizophrenia , mdd , and personality disorders in subjects with mental retardation , cognitive and speech disorders as exclusion criteria in the present study had not been diagnosed after clinical interview .

keywords transcatheter aortic valve replacement heart failure cardiorenal syndrome issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( tavr ) is an efficient treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis ( as ) at high risk with surgical aortic valve replacement [ 1 ] .
severe as can lead to acute decompensated heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome resistant to medical treatment in some cases .
acute heart failure accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome is the complex physiological , biochemical , and hormonal derangements manifested by worsening renal function during heart failure treatment and diuretic resistance .
however , limited data are available to suggest effective treatment options for these patients .
here , we report the successful use of emergent tavr for a patient presenting with decompensated severe as accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome .
case presentation an 82 - year - old man presented at our emergency department because of aggravated dyspnea classified as new york heart association functional class iv. he has been diagnosed with severe as 1 year previously , at which time surgical aortic valve replacement was recommended .
however , the patient refused open heart surgery at that time .
his physical examination showed a blood pressure of 94 / 56 mmhg , pulse rate of 110 beats per minute , and drowsy mental status .
electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with occasional premature ventricular complex , and chest x - ray showed cardiomegaly with bilateral pulmonary edema ( fig. 1 ) .
laboratory examination revealed acute kidney injury , creatinine level of 3.8 mg / dl , and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) of 16 ml / min / 1.73 m2 .
his n - type pro - brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 20,774 pg / ml. transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) revealed low - flow , low - gradient tricuspid aortic valve stenosis ( aortic valve area of 0.69 cm2 based on 2d planimetry , 0.86 cm2 based on the continuity equation , and mean systolic pressure gradient of 16.3 mmhg ) with decreased left ventricular ( lv ) systolic function ( lv ejection fraction , 34 %) ( fig. 2 ) .
annulus diameter measured by 2d - tte was 20.6 mm. fig. 1 preoperative findings .
a chest x - ray .
b electrocardiography fig. 2 two - dimensional echocardiography findings .
a before the tavr procedure , echocardiography showed degenerative change in the aortic valve with severe calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy .
b the aortic valve area was 0.69 cm2 based on 2d planimetry .
c the mean systolic pressure gradient was 16.3 mmhg and aortic valve area was 0.86 cm2 based on the continuity eq. ra : right atrium ; lv : left ventricle ; la : left atrium with the clinical diagnosis of acute decompensated severe as accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome , surgical aortic valve replacement was indicated .
however , the patient was considered very high - risk candidate for open heart surgery based on the society of thoracic surgeons predicted risk of mortality score ( 21.153 %) [ 2 ] .
furthermore , his clinical status had not improved despite intravenous dobutamine infusion with furosemide infusion .
therefore , we ultimately decided to perform emergent tavr .
the tavr procedure was performed under general anesthesia .
in general , ct should be required to determine the procedure approach and prosthesis size , but it might be dangerous for a patient with decompensated heart failure accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome .
before the tavr procedure , we attempted to obtain accurate information about annulus diameter by 3d - transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) .
the tee annulus diameter measurement of 23.5 mm corresponded to that of the corevalve transcatheter valve ( 26 - mm ; evolute - r ( tm ) , medtronic , ny , usa ) ( fig. 3 ) .
we punctured the left common femoral artery using the standard percutaneous access techniques , and peripheral angiogram was performed using judkins right 4.0 coronary catheter .
fortunately , peripheral angiography showed adequate size of the right iliofemoral artery for vascular access for the corevalve delivery .
coronary angiography also showed no significant luminal narrowing .
then , we inserted a 26 - mm self - expanding corevalve through the right common femoral artery sheath and deployed it at the aortic valve under fluoroscopic guidance without rapid pacing .
the immediate post - procedural aortogram and tee showed mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation ( fig. 4 ) .
the patient 's vital signs were stable during the procedure. fig. 3 three - dimensional transesophageal echocardiography findings .
annulus diameter was 23.5 mm fig. 4 immediate post - procedural findings .
a the aortogram revealed mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation ( arrow ) .
b transesophageal echocardiography showed mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation ( arrow ) the patient 's dyspnea was dramatically improved after the procedure , and chest x - ray showed marked improvement .
the post - procedural tte revealed improved lv systolic function ( lv ejection fraction , 45 %) with well - functioning corevalve ( aortic valve area of 2.15 cm2 based on the continuity equation and mean systolic pressure gradient of 3.22 mmhg ) .
urine output was also increased , creatinine level was decreased to 1.4 mg / dl , and egfr increased to 52 ml / min / 1.73 m2 .
he was discharged 7 days after the procedure , and his 3 - month follow - up echocardiography showed no significant interval change from his immediate post - procedural findings .
discussion and conclusions there is a high prevalence of severe as in elderly patients , usually combined with multiple risk factors .
in elderly patients with severe as , surgery is contraindicated in about 30 % of cases because of older age and lv dysfunction , which are associated with increased operative risk and a poor late outcome after surgery [ 3 ] .
tavr is currently the " gold - standard " treatment for these high - risk elderly patients with severe as , and the indications have been extended to intermediate - risk patients [ 4 , 5 ] .
patients with severe as may experience acute decompensated heart failure accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome that is resistant to medical treatment .
heart failure and renal failure have synergistic effects that increase the adverse outcomes compared to those of either disease alone [ 6 ] .
the present case report illustrates the effectiveness of emergency tavr in the setting of decompensated severe as accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome .
bongiovanni et al. investigated the early outcome of emergency tavr versus emergency balloon aortic valvuloplasty for the treatment of patients with acute as and severe decompensation [ 7 ] .
emergency tavr showed high immediate procedural and 30 - day mortalities compared with emergency balloon aortic valvuloplasty , but tavr was associated with a trend toward lower mortality at the 2 - year follow - up [ 7 ] .
frerker et al. reported outcomes of tavr as a rescue therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock due to acute decompensated heart failure caused by severe as and found that 1 - year survival did not differ between emergency and elective tavr among 30 - day survivors ( 89.6 % vs. 88.9 %) [ 8 ] .
this finding suggests that emergency tavr might be a reasonable therapeutic option for patients with acute decompensated severe as. procedural complications following tavr , such as paravalvular regurgitation , stroke , permanent pacemaker implantation , vascular access injury , and renal failure , are commonly reported as previous literature .
especially , significant postprocedural aortic regurgitation after tavr observed 10 % to 20 % is reported one of the strongest independent predictor of mortality [ 9 ] .
peri - prosthetic aortic regurgitation result from under - expansion of the prosthesis stent frame , which might be caused by calcification of the annulus or the cusps of the native valve , malposition with too shallow or too deep implantation depth of the prosthesis , or annulus - prosthesis size mismatch [ 10 ] .
for successful tavr , multimodality imaging examination , including computed tomography ( ct ) , is necessary to determine the procedure approach and prosthesis size [ 11 , 12 ] .
however , contrast - enhanced ct may aggravate renal impairment in patients with cardiorenal syndrome .
a previous study of imaging techniques for the measurement of aortic annulus diameter before tavr reported that 3d - tee provided similar results to those obtained by ct [ 13 ] .
in this case , annulus diameter measured by 2d - tte was 20.6 mm , which is smaller than that measured by 3d - tee ( 23.5 mm ) .
we selected the prosthesis size based on 3d - tee findings , and we ultimately successfully implanted a corevalve of adequate size with only mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation .
in the clinical setting of severely decompensated patients with severe as , emergency tavr can be performed using 3d - tee imaging , if ct is not possible .
this case report is important as it reports on effectiveness of emergent tavr in the clinical setting of acute decompensated heart failure accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome , which requires immediate decision making .
in conclusion , this case report presents an effective strategy for successful emergent tavr in a patient with decompensated severe as accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome .
thus , emergent tavr using only echocardiography measurements is a feasible and safe option for treating decompensated heart failure accompanied by cardiorenal syndrome in the clinical setting .

identification of insect species is an important task in forensic entomology .
for more convenient species identification , the nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ( coi ) gene have been widely utilized .
we analyzed full - length coi nucleotide sequences of 10 muscidae and 6 sarcophagidae fly species collected in korea .
after dna extraction from collected flies , pcr amplification and automatic sequencing of the whole coi sequence were performed .
obtained sequences were analyzed for a phylogenetic tree and a distance matrix .
our data showed very low intraspecific sequence distances and species - level monophylies .
however , sequence comparison with previously reported sequences revealed a few inconsistencies or paraphylies requiring further investigation .
to the best of our knowledge , this study is the first report of coi nucleotide sequences from hydrotaea occulta , muscina angustifrons , muscina pascuorum , ophyra leucostoma , sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis , sarcophaga harpax , and phaonia aureola .

introduction the postmortem interval ( pmi ) is a key piece of information that needs to be determined in the investigation of a death .
in fresh bodies , early postmortem changes such as body cooling , rigidity , and lividity are used for the estimation of pmi [ 1 ] .
in putrefied bodies , however , these early changes cannot be used for pmi estimation , and it is not possible to estimate pmi from the degree of putrefaction [ 1 ] .
as a result , pmi estimation in putrefied bodies is one of the most difficult tasks for forensic scientists and pathologists .
many kinds of arthropods , especially insects belonging to the orders diptera ( flies ) and coleoptera ( beetles ) , are attracted to the bodies of dead animals .
flies , particularly blow flies ( family calliphoridae ) , are typically the first to arrive and oviposit into animal carcasses [ 2 ] .
in addition to blow flies , 2 other families , muscidae ( house flies and allies ) and sarcophagidae ( flesh flies ) , are important in forensic entomology .
although house flies are not commonly attracted to putrefied meat as blow flies and flesh flies are , they are often important indicators of pmi particularly in indoor deaths [ 2 ] .
when larvae or pupae in various stages of development are collected from the site of investigation and the growth rates of samples are known , an approximate time of oviposition or larviposition can be estimated [ 3 ] .
species identification is essential for determining growth rates , as these rates are species - specific [ 2 ] .
therefore , species identification is a key step in estimating the pmi from entomological evidence .
the traditional species identification method is dependent on the morphological features of insects and is not easily applicable to immature samples such as eggs , larvae , and pupae [ 4 - 9 ] .
moreover , only a few expert taxonomists specialize in forensically important insect species , not only in korea but also worldwide .
dna - based approaches have been developed in an effort to improve accessibility to methods of species identification .
sperling et al. developed a method to identify 3 forensically important fly species by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ( coi ) gene and its flanking loci [ 10 ] .
although mitochondrial coi nucleotide sequence analysis frequently yields species - level or even genus - level paraphylies in forensically important flies , this locus is still used as the standard method of identification [ 11 , 12 ] .
two previously reported studies have used the full - length dna of the coi gene for calliphoridae species in korea [ 13 , 14 ] .
however , there has been little effort to characterize the coi haplotypes of korean muscidae and sarcophagidae fly species .
this study examined the full - length nucleotide sequences of the coi gene of 10 muscidae and 6 sarcophagidae fly species collected in korea .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
sample collection and preparation fly samples were collected between 2004 and 2008 in seoul , guri , pyeongtaek , and jeju island regions of korea by using insect nets or traps with pork liver bait .
because fly collection was performed in private lands except for in jeju island , no specific permission was required in seoul ( korea university college of medicine ) , guri ( jjh 's private residence ) , and pyeongtaek ( pwg genetics company ) .
the gps information for the collection sites in seoul , guri , and pyeongtaek is 37.59,127.03 , 37.58,127.11 , and 37.05,126.97 , respectively .
for jeju island , we acquired permission from the ministry of environment of korean government .
pork liver bait and our collection method did not involve endangered or protected species .
species identification was performed by an expert dipterological taxonomist ( jo , th ) by using a dissecting microscope [ 4 , 15 - 17 ] .
taxonomic information and the sample sizes of the flies analyzed are listed in table 1 .
flies were first frozen in liquid nitrogen , and the whole bodies were ground using a skmill - 200 ( tokken , chiba , japan ) .
genomic dna was extracted from the ground samples by using a qiaamp dna mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
2.2 .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and automatic sequencing universal primer sequences for the coi gene were taken from the literature ( table 2 ) [ 13 , 14 , 24 - 26 ] , and pcrs were performed using a 2720 thermal cycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
the pcr reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95degreesc for 11 min , followed by 35 cycles at 95degreesc for 30 s , 50degreesc for 1 min , and 72degreesc for 1 min , and then a final elongation step at 72degreesc for 15 min .
each reaction mixture was prepared using 50 ng of template dna , 2.5 mul 10x amplitaq gold buffer , 0.5 u amplitaq gold dna polymerase ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , 10 pmol ( each ) upstream and downstream primers , 62.5 nmol mgcl2 , 5 nmol ( each ) dntps , and sterile distilled water to a final volume of 25 mul .
after purification of the pcr products , cycle sequencing reactions were performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions using a bigdye v3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
the sequencing products were analyzed using an abi 3730xl genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
assembled sequences were deposited into the ncbi genbank database ( jx861406 - jx861482 ) .
2.3 .
phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison phylogenetic trees were generated for 2 fly families by using the maximum likelihood method with 1,000 replicates of bootstrapping based on the tamura - nei model using mega6 software [ 27 ] .
initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained by applying the neighbor - joining method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood ( mcl ) approach .
to make a root for each tree , coi sequences for lucilia sericata ( ncbi accession number eu880212 ) , calliphora vicina ( eu880188 ) , and drosophila melanogaster ( nc _ 001709 ) were introduced as outgroup taxa .
average intraspecific and interspecific sequence distances were calculated for sequence comparison .
sequences obtained in this study were also compared to previously announced sequence data ( table 3 ) .
3. results 3.1 .
nucleotide sequence distances a pairwise percentage distance matrix of 10 muscidae fly species is shown in table 4 .
because only 1 individual coi sequence was obtained for h. occulta , intraspecific variation was not estimated for this species .
interspecific distance was the lowest between o. chalcogaster and o. leucostoma ( 6.3 %) and the highest between musca domestica and phaonia aureola ( 15.3 %) .
intraspecific distances were 0.3 % or less .
a pairwise percentage distance matrix for the 6 sarcophagidae fly species is shown in table 5 .
interspecific distance was the lowest between sarcophaga similis and sarcophaga peregrina ( 6.4 %) , whereas it was the highest between sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis and s. peregrina ( 8.9 %) .
intraspecific distances were 0.3 % or less .
3.2 .
phylogenetic analysis maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated from coi nucleotide sequences of 10 muscidae and 6 sarcophagidae fly species .
all taxa were clustered according to species and genera , without any species - or genus - level paraphyly ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
although a few internal nodes display low bootstrap values under 50 % , every bootstrap value at the species level was 100 % .
4. discussion as shown in tables 4 and 5 , korean muscidae and sarcophagidae fly species showed average intraspecific sequence distances of 0.0 - 0.3 % .
the phylogenetic trees did not show any species - level paraphylies ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
although our sampling was limited to a few areas of korea in a relatively short period , these findings suggest that korean muscidae and sarcophagidae fly species are identifiable using the coi nucleotide sequences .
in this study , h. dentipes showed intraspecific sequence distances of 0 - 0.1 % ( average 0.0 %) .
the only previous coi sequence of h. dentipes ( fj025623 ) in the ncbi genbank ( table 3 ) showed intraspecific distances of 3.5 - 3.6 % from the conspecific sequences in this study [ 18 ] .
according to cognato , who reported intraspecific sequence distances of 0.04 - 3.5 % in 8 fly species , this range of intraspecific distances ( 3.5 - 3.6 %) may be valid and not a result of misidentification [ 28 ] .
further sampling from other geographic regions will be required , however , to confirm the variability of coi haplotypes of h. dentipes .
because only 1 h. occulta coi sequence was identified in this study , and there are currently no coi sequences from this species in the ncbi genbank , it is impossible to determine the validity of this sequence .
as expected , however , h. occulta formed a genus hydrotaea clade with h. dentipes ( figure 1 ) .
previously reported sequences from h. cyrtoneurina , h. irritans , and h. dentipes in the ncbi genbank ( table 3 ) showed interspecific distances of at least 7.4 % compared with the h. occulta sequence determined in this study [ 18 ]. m. domestica , the common house fly , exhibits a cosmopolitan distribution [ 6 ] .
the coi gene has been widely studied in this species , and 28 coi sequences of this species from the ncbi genbank ( table 3 ) are highly homologous to conspecific sequences in this study ( average distance = 0.2 %) [ 19 , 20 ] .
as reported by shinonaga , 5 species of the genus muscina have been identified in japan [ 6 ] .
three of these species were analyzed in this study. of these , m. stabulans ( stable fly ) is the most forensically important species , and it is more often attracted to decaying animals than are other muscina flies [ 6 ] .
all 3 muscina flies showed very low intraspecific sequence distances ( 0.1 - 0.2 %) and interspecific distances of at least 8.5 % ; hence , identification of korean muscina fly species was relatively straightforward .
compared to previously reported conspecific data , in this study , m. stabulans sequences were very similar to 2 previously reported conspecific sequences ( eu627711 and aj879595 ; sequence distance 0.1 - 0.3 %) but very divergent from another reported sequence ( ef531210 ; sequence distance 5.0 - 5.1 %) [ 21 ] .
because only ef531210 is inconsistent with other conspecific sequences , the validity of this sequence should be reviewed by analysis of the voucher specimen and the morphological features used for identification .
the m. assimilis sequence ( eu627712 ) does not match any muscina sequences reported in this study .
three ophyra species were analyzed in this study , each with low intraspecific distances and at least 6.3 % interspecific distances .
therefore , identification of these 3 korean ophyra species is plausible .
compared to previously reported conspecific sequences , the o. nigra sequence obtained in this study was monomorphic with eu627714 ( distance 0.3 %) , whereas o. chalcogaster showed distances of 1.2 - 1.3 % from eu627715 .
since the o. leucostoma coi gene has not previously been analyzed , conspecific comparison is not possible at this time .
there are no nucleotide sequences in the ncbi genbank database that match the o. leucostoma sequences reported in this study. s. haemorrhoidalis showed a very low intraspecific average sequence distance ( 0.1 %) and interspecific distances of at least 6.8 % ( table 5 ) .
there are currently no other coi nucleotide sequences in the ncbi genbank for this species name .
however , a coi sequence of a synonymous species , sarcophaga africa ( gq223343 ) , is available [ 17 ] .
since the sequence distance between s. haemorrhoidalis and s. africa is only 0.8 % , the dna result also supports that they are conspecific. s. peregrina sequences in this study showed a very low intraspecific average sequence distance ( 0.1 %) and interspecific distances of at least 6.4 % ( table 5 ) .
because s. peregrina was once categorized in the old genus boettcherisca , a phylogenetic tree was generated from s. peregrina sequences in this study and the coi sequences of old genus boettcherisca submitted by other authors .
the phylogenetic tree showed a species - level paraphyly of s. peregrina , with 2 malaysian s. peregrina sequences , submitted by tan et al. , clustering with 2 malaysian s. javanica sequences ( figure 3 ) [ 22 ] .
because these 2 malaysian s. peregrina sequences are divergent from other conspecific sequences from korea and china ( sequence distance 2.4 - 3.0 %) , further consideration , such as a review of the voucher specimens , would be necessary .
sarcophaga melanura showed a very low intraspecific average sequence distance ( 0.1 %) and interspecific distances of at least 6.5 % ( table 5 ) .
compared with the 6 short s. melanura coi sequences shown in table 3 , the s. melanura coi sequences reported in this study showed intraspecific distances of only 0.0 - 0.7 % [ 23 ] .
three species previously classified as the old genus parasarcophaga , that is , s. similis , sarcophaga harpax , and sarcophaga albiceps , showed very low intraspecific average sequence distances ( 0.0 - 0.1 %) and interspecific distances of at least 6.4 % ( table 5 ) .
compared with other conspecific species in the ncbi genbank ( table 3 ) , s. albiceps and s. similis showed intraspecific sequence distances of only 0.3 - 0.7 % and 0.2 - 0.4 % , respectively [ 22 ] .
additionally , s. harpax and its known sister species s. dux are closely related with sequence distances of 1.4 - 1.6 % [ 22 ] .
in conclusion , 10 muscidae and 6 sarcophagidae fly species collected in korea were identifiable using coi sequence analysis .
however , a few inconsistencies with previously reported sequences require further evaluation .
to our knowledge , the present study provides the first report of the coi nucleotide sequences of h. occulta , m. angustifrons , m. pascuorum , o. leucostoma , s. haemorrhoidalis , p. harpax , and p. aureola .

background : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) is a type of nephrotic syndrome which is diagnosed by renal biopsy .
degree of the proteinuria , renal dysfunction , histologic findings and the response to therapy are some factors used for evaluating the prognosis of fsgs .
objectives : in the present study , we attempted to discover some protein candidates for disease prognosis related to glomerular filtration rate ( renal dysfunction ) .
patients and methods : urine samples were collected from ten patients .
urine proteome was extracted and trypsinated .
digested peptides were separated and identified by nano - flow lc - ms / ms. protein content were determined using label - free quantification method .
protein profiles were analyzed using supervised multivariate statistical method .
results : output of a predictive model was 54 significant proteins of which ribonuclease 2 and haptoglobin had the greatest fold change in terms of overrepresentation and underrepresentation in patients with the best and worse prognosis , respectively .
complement and coagulation cascades were the only significant pathways which were impaired in fsgs .
conclusions : urinary biomarkers can potentially be used as non - invasive prognostic markers .
however these candidate biomarkers need further validation by an alternative method and in a larger cohort .

background focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) is a type of nephrotic syndrome which is diagnosed using renal biopsy and may be found as either primary or secondary conditions .
primary fsgs occurs without an identifiable cause and the secondary type occurs in response to previous glomerular injury , glomerular hypertension , or hypertrophy ( 1 ) .
while the clinical presentation of fsgs is often heterogeneous , a characteristic feature of the disease is proteinuria due to loss of filtration barrier of glomeruli ( 2 ) .
histological characteristics of fsgs also include scattered sclerosis of glomeruli in which only a segment of the capillary is affected ( 3 ) .
it is the most common cause of acquired chronic renal insufficiency in children and frequently leads to progression to the end - stage kidney disease ( eskd ) ( 4 ) .
factors that appear to mainly affect the prognosis include the degree of proteinuria and renal dysfunction , histologic findings , and the response to therapy .
in the present study we focused on the discovery of urinary proteins responsible for developing more severe renal dysfunction as a prognostic factor using proteomics tools .
2. objectives in the present study , we attempted to discover urinary excreted proteins which can be used for the differentiation of patients with good and bad prognosis .
these non - invasive biomarker candidates would be useful in the follow - up and detection of disease progression without using biopsy .
3. patients and methods second morning urine samples were collected from 11 patients with biopsy proven fsgs ( male = 7 , female = 4 , mean age = 36.36 ) , at labbafinejad hospital during 2011 .
for each patient egfr was calculated by ckd - epi equation at presentation .
in order to study differential proteins among good and bad prognosis patients , we categorized all patients based on egfr .
since more severe renal dysfunction at presentation is generally associated with poor renal survival ( 5 ) , five patients considered as mild disease state ( egfr > 60 cc / min / 1.73 m2 ) and five patients with advanced disease state and worse prognosis ( egfr < 60 cc / min / 1.73 m2 ) were enrolled .
urine samples were concentrated and desalted with ultrafiltration ( millipore , billerica , ma , usa with a 3 kda cut off ) and then were treated with acetone ( up to 80 % v / v ) , dried and re - suspended in 0.1 m ammonium acetate ( ph 5 ) .
protein concentration was then determined using the bca ( bicinchoninicacid ) protein assay ( pierce , thermo scientific , usa ) and proteins were further digested by trypsin .
digested peptides were suspended in an appropriate buffer and injected to a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( nlc - ms / ms ) coupled online to a q exactive mass spectrometer ( both - thermo scientific , bremen , germany ) .
for details of the sample preparation protocol , ms analysis and label - free quantification procedure see the article of kalantari et al .
( 6 ) .
protein profiles then were analyzed using supervised multivariate statistical analysis .
patients were categorized based on gfr ( renal dysfunction ) .
a predictive model was then constructed and validated by 7 fold cross - validation and significant proteins were determined .
gene - set enrichment and pathway analysis on significant proteins were performed using " david " software .
4. results urinary protein profiles of fsgs patients using 110 protein entries were quantified as described by kalantari et al .
( 7 ) .
differential proteins between the two groups with different prognosis features ( egfr < 60 and > 60 cc / min / 1.73 m2 ) were obtained using orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis ( opls - da ) ( 8 ) .
a predictive model was constructed by this method ( q2 = 0.861 and r2 = 0.619 ) which had 100 % accuracy ( figure 1 ) .
fifty four significant biomarkers were obtained from the predictive model of which top twelve ( six most positively and six most negatively correlating with gfr ) are described in table 1 as putative fsgs progression biomarkers .

discussion prognosis is important to patients , clinicians , public health , and health policy makers and glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) is one of the effective prognostic factors for patients with declining renal function ( 9 , 10 ) and glomerular diseases .
urinary biomarkers derived from a predictive model which reflect the prognosis of glomerular diseases ( based on gfr in the current study ) could be considered as useful noninvasive markers for rapid , reliable and accurate diagnosis and monitoring the progression of the disease in comparison with current traditional invasive approaches , however the causes of up / down regulation of these candidates is not clear and need further experiments .
some of the most significant biomarker candidates are presented here : rnas2 had the greatest - fold change ( 7.32 ) as the overrepresented biomarker in patients with worse prognosis ( egfr < 60 cc / min / 1.73 m2 ) .
a strong correlation between serum rnase levels and renal insufficiency was previously reported by humphrey et al .
( 11 ) .
rnas2 is a 3kda protein which is found in body fluids ( including urine ) ( 12 ) and some tissues .
the pathologic reason of its urinary elevation in glomerulosclerosis is not clear ; however , to the best of our knowledge , it is reported here for the first time as a prognostic candidate marker for fsgs .
hpt ( haptoglobin ) is reported here as the underrepresented biomarker for fsgs progression with the greatest fold change ( 2.26 ) .
an association between the haptoglobin genotypes and renal function decline in individuals with long - standing type 1 diabetes was previously reported by costacou et al .
( 13 ) .
the exact role of haptoglobin in progression of fsgs is not well defined and a wide targeted genomic and proteomic experimental design is required for this purpose .
in the current study , some of the presented biomarkers have reported before as already known proteins implicated in glomerular disease including : b2mg ( 14 ) and ambp ( 15 ) , afam ( 6 ) , but most of the other candidates identified in this study are novel .
gene - set enrichment analysis by " david " software ( 16 ) resulted in identification of eight significant biological processes of which " acute inflammatory response " ( p = 5.3 x 10 - 7 ) , " blood coagulation " ( p = 2.7 x 10 - 4 ) and " regulation of homeostatic process " ( p = 5.3 x 10 - 3 ) are the more specific processes relevant to disease progression .
two of the proteins which were in the panel list ( composed of 50 proteins ) and were enriched in all eight significant processes were a1ag1 ( orosomucoid 1 ) and thrb ( prothrombin ) .
we suggest these two proteins are s important proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of fsgs .
pathway analysis against kegg database using " david " software resulted in two single significant pathways which were also shown to be enriched in the previous study from our group ( 7 ) which are the complement and coagulation cascades ( p = 8.2 x 10 - 5 ) .
it may suggest that impairment of complement pathway regardless of the criterion for judgment prognosis determination ( either gfr or responsiveness to steroids ) plays an important role in the progression and pathogenesis of fsgs .
impairment of this pathway in fsgs progression was consistent with our previous findings in which prognosis was determined based on the response to therapy .
in conclusion , a panel of urinary prognostic biomarkers was reported for fsgs .
the most significant over - and underrepresented proteins in patients with worse prognosis in comparison with patients with a better prognosis were rnas2 and hpt , respectively .
these candidates were obtained from a predictive model which clustered patients based on gfr .
in conclusion , involvement of proteins responsible for acute inflammatory response and also involvement of complement and coagulation pathways in disease progression were confirmed in our study using bioinformatics methods .

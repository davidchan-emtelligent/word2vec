background in switzerland , socio - demographic and behavioural factors are associated with obesity , but no study ever assessed their impact on weight gain using prospective data .
methods data from 4,469 participants ( 53.0 % women ) , aged 35 to 75 years at baseline and followed for 5.5 years .
weight gain was considered as a rate ( kg / year ) or as gaining >= 5 kg during the study period .
results rate of weight gain was lower among participants who were older ( mean +/ - standard deviation : 0.46 +/ - 0.92 , 0.33 +/ - 0.88 , 0.21 +/ - 0.86 and 0.06 +/ - 0.74 kg / year in participants aged [ 35 - 45 ] , [ 45 - 55 ] , [ 55 - 65 ] and [ 65 +] years , respectively , p < 0.001 ) ; physically active ( 0.27 +/ - 0.82 vs. 0.35 +/ - 0.95 kg / year for sedentary , p < 0.005 ) or living in couple ( 0.29 +/ - 0.84 vs. 0.35 +/ - 0.96 kg / year for living single , p < 0.05 ) , and higher among current smokers ( 0.41 +/ - 0.97 , 0.26 +/ - 0.84 and 0.29 +/ - 0.85 kg / year for current , former and never smokers , respectively , p < 0.001 ) .
these findings were further confirmed by multivariable analysis .
multivariable logistic regression showed that receiving social help , being a current smoker or obese increased the likelihood of gaining >= 5 kg : odds ratio ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.43 ( 1.16 - 1.77 ) ; 1.63 ( 1.35 - 1.95 ) and 1.95 ( 1.57 - 2.43 ) , respectively , while living in couple or being physically active decreased the risk : 0.73 ( 0.62 - 0.86 ) and 0.72 ( 0.62 - 0.83 ) , respectively .
no association was found between weight gain and gender , being born in switzerland or education .
conclusions in switzerland , financial difficulties ( indicated by receiving social help ) and current smoking were associated with increases in body weight over a 5 years follow - up. living in couple , being older or physically active were protective against weight gain .

keywords weight gain socio - demographic prospective study switzerland population - based issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background worldwide prevalence of obesity almost doubled between 1980 and 2008 [ 1 ] and a similar trend has been observed in switzerland [ 2 ] .
several socio - demographic and behavioural factors have been shown to influence weight gain .
a consistent positive association between marital status [ 3 ] , occupational position [ 4 ] , low educational level , economic difficulties [ 5 ] and weight gain has been reported .
still , the impact of ses on weight gain might differ according to gender [ 6 ] or to the country 's level of socioeconomic development - while in high income countries a high socioeconomic status ( ses ) is generally related to a lower prevalence of obesity , the opposite association is found in low income countries [ 7 ] .
in switzerland , several cross - sectional studies have shown an inverse association between obesity and socio - demographic and behavioural factors [ 8,9 ] , but whether socio - demographic and behavioural factors have an impact on weight gain has never been investigated prospectively .
indeed , one of the main objectives of the swiss national programme on healthy eating and physical activity ( pnaap ) is achieving a health weight [ 10 ] and such data are important for adequately designing health promotion policies and to evaluate their impact in the target population .
thus , we aimed to assess the socio - demographic and behavioural determinants of weight gain , using prospective data from the swiss population - based colaus study .
methods the cohorte lausannoise ( colaus ) study the colaus study is a population - based study assessing the clinical , biological and genetic determinants of cardiovascular disease in the city of lausanne , switzerland [ 11 ] .
the initial recruitment took place between june 2003 and may 2006 and enrolled 6,733 participants ( 3,544 women ) aged 35 - 75 years ; participation rate was 41 % .
follow - up was conducted between april 2009 and september 2012 and included all participants of the baseline study willing to participate .
at follow - up , participants attended a single visit which included , as in the baseline assessment , an interview , a physical exam , and blood and urine collections in the fasting state .
average follow - up time was 5.5 years .
socio - economic data educational level was categorized as primary , secondary school , apprenticeship and university .
nationality was defined by the country of birth and categorized into swiss and the most frequent nationalities in the canton ( french , italian , portuguese and spanish ) and other .
marital status was categorized into living in couple ( married and other relationship ) or living alone ( single , divorced or widowed ) .
receiving social help was assessed with the question : " do you receive social help ?" .
because all individuals residing in switzerland receive financial compensation when they retire , the response to this variable is not informative beyond the retirement age .
therefore , men older than 65 years and women older than 63 or 64 years were not considered as receiving social help ( n = 638 ) .
in switzerland , social help is provided as financial support to people with disabilities or whose income is insufficient to support themselves or their family , and can thus be considered as an indicator of financial adversity .
clinical and anthropometric data smoking status was defined as never , former and current .
physical activity was self - reported and participants were considered as physically active if they reported practicing leisure time physical activity at least twice per week .
body weight , height and waist circumference ( wc ) were measured using standard procedures [ 11 ] .
the same procedure was used in the baseline and follow - up examinations .
bmi was defined as weight ( kg )/ height ( m ) 2 .
normal bmi was defined as bmi < 25 kg / m2 , overweight as 25 <= bmi < 30 kg / m2 and obesity as bmi >= 30 kg / m2 .
abdominal obesity was defined as wc >= 102 cm for men and wc >= 88 cm for women .
weight gain was considered in two ways .
first , as a continuous variable representing the rate of weight gain , computed as the difference between the follow - up and baseline weight divided by the number of years of the follow - up ( kg / year ) .
second , as having or not having gained 5 kg or more during the follow - up ; the 5 kg cut - off was chosen according to the recommendations of the world health organization that weight gain in adulthood should not exceed 5 kg over the entire adult life [ 12 ] .
ethics the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the university of lausanne and all participants provided written informed consent .
statistical analysis analyses were conducted after excluding participants without bmi at baseline or follow - up , without ses data at baseline .
as illness could lead to involuntary weight loss , participants who reported involuntary weight loss during the last 12 months at follow - up were also excluded .
statistical analyses were performed using stata version 12.0 for windows ( stata corp , college station , texas , usa ) .
descriptive results were expressed as number of participants ( percentage ) or as mean +/ - standard deviation .
bivariate analyses were performed using chi - square or fisher 's exact test for qualitative variables and one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) for quantitative variables .
multivariable analyses were performed using anova or logistic regression and results were expressed as multivariable adjusted mean +/ - standard error for anova or as odds ratio ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) for logistic regression .
in multivariable analyses , several models were considered - adjusted only for age and gender and adjusted for all the variables significantly associated with weight gain .
as bmi and waist were correlated , two separate multivariable models were tested ( one with bmi and another with waist ) .
statistical significance was considered for p < 0.05 .
results characteristics of the participants of the initial 5,064 participants with follow - up data , 67 ( 1.3 %) were excluded because of missing values on bmi at baseline or follow - up and 528 ( 10.4 %) because of involuntary weight loss during the last 12 months .
the socio - demographic and anthropometric characteristics of the remaining 4,469 participants are summarized in table 1 .

statistical analysis by chi - square or analysis of variance .
determinants associated with weight gain bivariate analysis of the baseline factors associated with rate of weight gain or weight gain >= 5 kg are summarized in table 1 .
rate of weight gain decreased with age , and was lower among participants born in switzerland , living in couple or physically active .
obese ( bmi or abdominal ) participants had a lower rate of weight gain , while current smokers had a higher rate .
receiving social help tended to be associated with weight gain ( p = 0.06 ) .
the factors associated with a weight gain >= 5 kg were similar , although the association with being born in switzerland was no longer significant , while receiving social help became significant .
results of multivariable analyses adjusting for age and gender ( model 1 ) and for the main confounders ( model 2 ) are summarized in table 2 .
weight gain rate was negatively associated with age , living in couple and being physically active , and positively associated with current smoking .
weight gain rate was also associated with nationality ( other than portuguese ) , while no significant relationship was found with being swiss born or bmi status .
multivariable logistic regression on gaining >= 5 kg provided similar results , i.e. that older vs. younger participants and those living in couple vs. alone had , respectively , a 62 % ( 95 % ci : 0.28 - 0.51 ) and a 27 % ( 95 % ci : 0.62 - 0.86 ) decreased risk of weight gain , while current vs. never smokers had a 63 % increased risk ( 95 % ci : 1.35 - 1.95 ) .
participants receiving social help had a 43 % higher likelihood ( 95 % ci : 1.16 - 1.77 ) of gaining >= 5 kg. table 2 multivariable analysis of the factors associated with weight gain ( n = 4,469 ) , excluding participants reporting involuntary weight loss at follow - up weight gain ( kg / year ) gain >= 5 kg model 1 model 2 model 2 model 1 model 2 model 2 age group [ 35 - 45 ] 0.46 +/ - 0.02 0.45 +/ - 0.02 0.47 +/ - 0.02 1 ( ref . )

repeating the same analyses on the whole sample ( i.e. including participants who were initially excluded from the analysis ) led to similar findings , except that the difference in rate of weight gain between physically active and non - active participants was no longer significant , and that the increased likelihood of gaining >= 5 kg was borderline significant among participants receiving social help ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
discussion to our knowledge , this is the first study that assessed the socio - demographic determinants of weight gain in the general swiss adult population .
our results suggest that weight gain is negatively associated with age , portuguese nationality , living in couple and physical activity , and positively associated with current smoking , receiving social help and obesity .
conversely , no association between weight gain and educational level was found .
the fact that younger people tend to gain more weight is in accordance with other studies [ 13 ] .
this can probably be explained by the ceiling phenomenon of weight gain through life , which means that because older people are heavier , they are less likely to gain weight .
no difference in weight gain was found between normal weight , overweight and obese participants ; conversely , obese participants had an increased likelihood of gaining >= 5 kg. a possible explanation is that besides the substantial group of obese patients with weight gain >= 5 kg , there was also a large group of obese patients with weight loss , most likely due to medical reasons .
indeed , the prevalence of obese subjects with weight loss ( 40 %) was higher than in overweight ( 36 %) or normal weight ( 29 %) participants (< 0.001 ) .
our results thus suggest that many obese participants tend to lose weight , but that this trend is overcompensated by a significant fraction of obese participants who gained more than 5 kg during the study period .
also , many normal weight or overweight participants tend to gain weight , but less than 5 kg ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 proportion of normal weight , overweight and obese participants who had a weight gain >= 5 kg , 0 <= . < 5 kg and a weight loss between baseline and follow - up ( n = 4469 ) .
being married ( and particularly the marital transition to being married ) has been associated with an increase in body weight in most [ 3,14,15 ] but not all [ 16 ] studies .
in this study , living in couple was strongly protective against weight gain , and adjusting for other family covariates such as having children did not change the results ( adjusted mean +/ - sem : 0.36 +/ - 0.02 vs. 0.29 +/ - 0.02 kg / year for living alone vs. living in couple , p < 0.05 ) .
a possible explanation is the positive effect of living in couple on health - related behaviours [ 17,18 ] , but further studies are needed to better assess this point .
smoking at baseline was positively associated with weight gain , and this association persisted after multivariable adjustment .
a possible explanation is that some smokers quit during follow - up , which led to increased weight [ 19 ] , although this statement has been challenged [ 20 ] .
other explanations include a less healthy lifestyle of smokers ( i.e. less healthy eating and less physical activity ) and also the positive association between number of cigarettes smoked and central fat accumulation [ 21 ] and a j - or u - shaped association has also been found between waist circumference and visceral fat area with total lifetime smoking amount [ 22 ] .
hence , smoking should not be considered as a method for weight maintenance , and the beneficial effects of smoking cessation on health largely overcome the effects of post - cessation weight gain [ 23 ] .
receiving social help was associated with an increased likelihood of gaining >= 5 kg over the follow up. in switzerland , social help is provided as financial support to people with disabilities or whose income is insufficient to support themselves or their family , and can thus be considered as an indicator of financial adversity .
the association between receiving social help and weight gain was only partially attenuated after multivariable adjustment .
similar to other studies [ 5 ] , our results suggest that even in a wealthy country like switzerland , financial difficulties are positively associated with weight gain , and that this association is independent from educational level .
one possible explanation is that financial difficulties might prompt a decrease in diet quality [ 24 ] , but this aspect requires to be further investigated .
low educational level has been shown to be associated with increased weight gain [ 5,25,26 ] .
in this study , no significant association between education and weight gain was found , although participants with university education tended to be at lower risk of weight gain .
a possible explanation might be a low statistical power due to a small sample size .
also , given the large educational differences in obesity at baseline [ 9 ] , ceiling effects may be at play , with people in the lowest educational category already having reached a plateau in obesity prevalence .
strengths and limitations the main strengths of this study are the use of prospective data and of objective anthropometric measurements .
this study also has limitations .
first , 25 % of participants at baseline were not followed - up and were thus not included in this analysis .
participants who accepted to be followed were significantly younger , more educated , more frequently born in switzerland , received social help less frequently , were less frequently smokers and more frequently active than participants who refused follow - up ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
second , no information was available regarding slimming diets at baseline , so it was not possible to adjust for this covariate .
third , a considerable number of participants were foreigners , and education categorization might differ according to the educational system .
however , to reduce this issue , we used broad categorizations of education , and almost all foreigners came from european countries , where the educational system is quite comparable .
finally , changes in some sociodemographic or behavioural factors during follow - up might have influenced weight gain .
still , taking into account the multiple possibilities ( for instance , physical activity would be split in four groups depending on baseline and follow - up status ) would considerably complicate the model and increase the risk of small sized groups , leading to nonsignificant associations due to large confidence intervals of the estimators .
thus , and also considering the relative short follow - up period , we chose to apply a classic analytical method , taking into account only the baseline data .
policy implications our results are important for public health professionals and policy makers for several reasons .
first , being physically active was negatively associated with weight gain , supporting the importance of promoting physical activity , also through environments favouring the practice of physical activity [ 27,28 ] .
second , participants with financial difficulties had a higher tendency to gain weight over the follow - up , probably due to their intake of caloric - dense , less expensive foods [ 29 - 31 ] .
importantly , several randomized controlled trials have shown that education alone does not impact the purchase of healthy foods , and that cost reduction and / or promotions are needed to increase fruit and vegetable intake [ 32 - 34 ] .
thus , efforts should be made in the promotion of healthy eating , namely by decreasing the costs of healthy foods rather than just implementing food education campaigns .
finally , the fact that current smokers have an increased risk of gaining over 5 kg could be used as an additional argument for prompting smoking cessation .
conclusions in switzerland , financial difficulties and current smoking are positively associated with weight gain and living in couple , being older or physically active are negatively associated with weight gain .

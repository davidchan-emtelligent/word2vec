symptomatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( gist ) are infrequent with an incidence of 12.7 per million inhabitants in the western population .
we studied whether the incidence of gist has further increased between 2003 and 2012 and assessed the frequency of mutations , risk groups , histological subtypes and immunohistochemistry results. from palga , the nationwide dutch pathology registry , pathology excerpts from all patients with a gist or gist - like tumour between 2003 and 2012 were retrieved to calculate incidence rates .
full pathology reports were retrieved of resections in 2011 and 2012 to study the frequency of mutations , risk groups , histological subtypes and immunohistochemistry results .
the incidence of gist increased to 17.7 per million inhabitants in 2012 with a median age of 67 years .
mutational analysis was performed in 33.9 % of patients with a resection between 2011 and 2012 ( kit mutation 67.5 % , pdgfra 16.3 % , wild - type 11.4 %) .
the percentage of high risk patients in the different risk classifications varied from 19.9 % to 38.0 % depending on the used classification .
only 35.9 % of patients had diagnosis or revision of pathology diagnosis within three months in a designated gist referral centre .
no increase in proportion of central pathology reviews was found .
proportion of patients with mutational analysis increased over the years .
the registered incidence of gist , 17.7 per million inhabitants in 2012 in the netherlands , is still rising .
despite incorporation in the esmo gist guidelines since 2008 for mutational testing and since 2010 for central review of pathology , both are performed in a minority of patients .

keywords gastrointestinal stromal tumours epidemiology incidence mutation pathology soft tissue neoplasms http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100004336novartisissue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany , part of springer nature 2018 introduction the most common mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract are the gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( gists ) [ 1 ] .
clinical behaviour is predicted by primary localisation , tumour size , mitotic index and tumour rupture [ 2 ] .
the differential diagnosis contains gastrointestinal leiomyoma and leiomyosarcomas , desmoid - type fibromatosis and schwannoma [ 3 ] .
the estimated incidence of gist in the netherlands was 12.7 per million inhabitants in 2003 [ 4 ] .
studies in other countries report incidences between 7.8 and 21.1 / million [ 5 - 10 ] .
most studies were non - nationwide , doctor - driven cancer registry studies [ 11 ] .
primary treatment remains surgery and when non - resectable , imatinib has considerably improved prognosis of these patients [ 2 , 12 - 15 ] .
response to imatinib and progression - free survival depend on mutational status [ 16 , 17 ] .
kit is the most commonly mutated gene ( 76.2 - 83.6 %) , followed by pdgfra ( 3.2 - 11.2 %) [ 18 , 19 ] .
a significant subset of the 10 - 15 % of gists that lack mutations in kit or pdgfra are associated with loss of function of the succinate dehydrogenase complex , the so - called sdh - deficient gist , which has specific histological features [ 20 - 24 ] .
the diagnosis of gist is based on morphology and cd117 and / or dog1 immunohistochemistry [ 2 , 19 , 20 , 25 , 26 ] .
mutational analysis is considered standard of care in the diagnostic work - up for gist for the first time in the 2008 esmo guidelines , and after 2010 , confirmation by an expert pathologist is recommended .
[ 2 , 27 , 28 ] these recommendations are incorporated in the dutch guidelines [ 29 ] .
in 2004 , a nationwide survey was performed in the netherlands to estimate the incidence of gist in 1995 and 1998 to 2003 [ 4 ] .
we repeated this study for the following ten years ( 2003 - 2012 ) during which the diagnosis gist was well established .
our primary objective was to estimate the incidence of gist and the classification into the different risk categories , the frequency of the various mutations , immunohistochemical markers and histological subtypes .
the secondary aim was to compare the current daily practice of pathology reporting with the actual esmo guidelines .
methods patients from the palga , the nationwide network and registry of histo - and cytopathology in the netherlands [ 30 ] , all excerpts were retrieved matching the following search criteria : gist or metastasis of gist or (( malignant ) leiomyoma ( i.e. leiomyoma , leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoblastoma ) and gastrointestinal tract ) .
a second search was performed with the following criteria ( used earlier by goettsch et al .
[ 4 ]) : ( gastro - intestinal tract or abdomen or retroperitoneal or abdominal wall ) and ( liposarcoma or desmoid - type fibromatosis or solitary fibrous tumour or schwannoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour ) .
the standardised excerpts contain encrypted patient identification , age at diagnosis , sex , the date of arrival of the pathology specimen , whether the analysis was done in a clinical centre active in gist ( defined below ) and the conclusion of the pathology report .
patients with a first , incident gist were included .
ajv extracted the data , and uncertain pathology conclusions in the reports were discussed with hg and jvmgb .
for uncertain cases , full pathology reports were retrieved .
because not all questions could be answered with the information in the excerpts , full pathology reports were retrieved for all patients with a primary resection for a gist in 2011 or 2012 .
a clinical centre active in gist was defined as a centre with more than 15 new pathology diagnosis of gist per year and a dedicated multidisciplinary sarcoma team .
five dutch centres met these criteria : the erasmus medical centre , rotterdam , the antoni van leeuwenhoek hospital , amsterdam , the university medical centre groningen , the radboud university medical centre , nijmegen , and the leiden university medical center .
data collection data was collected on age at diagnosis , sex , year of diagnosis , localisation , tumour size , mitotic rate , immunohistochemical staining results ( cd117 , dog - 1 , sdhb , desmin , smooth muscle actin and cd34 ) , mutation analysis and surgical resection margins .
tumour size and mitotic rate were categorised into to the categories used in the various risk classifications , i.e. < 2 , 2 - 5 , 5 - 10 , > 10 cm and 0 - 5 , 6 - 10 , > 10 mitoses per 50 hpf or 5 mm2 , depending on what was reported .
risk stratification scores for the analysis of the different risk stratification scores , patients were grouped according to the criteria of fletcher et al .
[ 31 ] , miettinen et al .
[ 32 ] , revised miettinen / afip [ 33 ] , joensuu [ 34 ] and gold nomogram [ 35 ] .
most risk classifications give a long - term indication of the risk of recurrence , but the gold nomogram specifies the 2 - and 5 - year recurrence - free survival ( rfs ) after surgery .
for comparison , the 5 - year rfs was used .
rfs rates were categorised to a low risk group ( gold nomogram 5 - year rfs 90 - 100 %) , moderate risk group ( 75 - 90 %) and high risk group (< 75 %) , which are comparable to percentages given in the revised miettinen / afip criteria .
because it is not possible in the rfs calculation to have a rfs > 96 % , no very low risk group was identified .
statistical analysis the incidence rate of gist was calculated per million inhabitants , also standardised for 5 year age groups and sex for the dutch population of 2012 and standardised to the who and european ( esr ) standard population [ 36 , 37 ] .
time trends for incidence were either tested for significance with regression analysis or a mantel - haenszel chi2 test for trend .
spearman 's rank correlation coefficient was used to test the correlation between the different risk classifications .
results figure 1 shows the search strategy and numbers of patients identified .
in total , 2456 patients were included for incidence analysis and 489 patients were included for full pathology report analysis. fig. 1 diagram of inclusion and exclusion of patients the mean age of patients was 65 years ( sd 13 ) , median 67 years ( range 3 - 96 ) and 1307 ( 53.2 %) patients were male ( see also supplementary fig. 1 ) .
the localisation of the gists ( patients with excerpts between 2003 and 2012 ) was the stomach in 59.8 % , small intestine in 21.1 % , rectum in 2.2 % , colon in 1.6 % , oesophagus in 0.6 % and intra - abdominal not further specified in 11.0 % .
for the patients with full reports between 2011 and 2012 , the localisation was stomach in 65.0 % , small intestine in 26.8 % , rectum in 3.1 % , colon in 1.6 % , oesophagus in 0.8 % and intra - abdominal not further specified in 1.8 % .
the group with a small intestine gist was further subdivided to duodenum in 6.1 % , jejunum 5.1 % , ileum 1.0 % and not specified 14.5 % ( supplementary table 1 ). of the six patients < 21 years of age , four were female ( 3 , 15 , 18 and 20 years ) and two were male ( 14 and 17 years ) .
localisations were the stomach ( n = 4 ) , colon ( n = 1 ) and intra - abdominal not further specified ( n = 1 ) .
incidence rates the standardised incidence rate increased from 12.2 per million in 2003 to 17.7 in 2012 ( p < 0.05 ) .
age of peak incidence was 70 - 74 years with an incidence of 73.9 per million in 2012 for this age group .
the incidence of gist before the age of 21 was 0.13 per million per year ( table 1 and fig. 2a ) .

b relative incidence of the four tumour diameter groups during the 10 - year study period , the proportion of tumours with a size < 2 cm significantly increased ( p < 0.0001 ) from 4.0 to 13.5 % with at the same time a decrease in the proportion of patients for which tumour size is not reported from 47.1 to 34.8 % ( ns ) with a stable absolute number ( fig. 2b ) .
histology detailed histological findings were only evaluated for patients with a full pathology report. of the 429 patients ( 87.7 % of patients with a full report ) with known morphology , 81.6 % had spindle cell morphology , 9.3 % epithelioid subtype and 9.1 % mixed epithelioid / spindle cell subtype .
no differences in morphology were found for the specified localisations .
for gist patients < 21 years , histologic subtype was mixed morphology in two , epithelioid subtype in two and unknown in two patients .
immunohistochemistry results were analysed for patients with full pathology reports .
cd117 was reported in 89.4 % of patients , and of these , 93.6 % tested positive .
for dog1 , 42.9 % of patients were tested with a positive result in 98.6 % .
for additional results of immunohistochemistry , see supplementary table 2 .
for 49 patients ( 10.0 %) , no positive immunohistochemistry was reported for cd117 and / or dog - 1 in the full pathology reports or excerpts of the patients with a full pathology report .
only one was actually reported as being negative for both cd117 and dog - 1 , and all others had at least one of both not reported .
resection margins were reported in 404 of 489 patients ( 82.6 %) with a r0 resection in 84.9 % , r1 in 11.6 % and r2 in 3.5 % .
risk classification full pathology reports were requested of all resections performed in 2011 and 2012. of the 489 patients with at least one full pathology report , 414 - 444 patients had sufficient data for risk classification depending on the applied risk classification ( because of different criteria not all classifications were able to classify the same patients ) .
although comparison of the incidence of risk categories is difficult because risk classifications differ in the number of patients eligible for risk stratification , both the gold risk assessment and the miettinen 2002 classification seem to allocate more patients to the highest risk group compared with the other risk classifications .
all risk classifications had a significant and good to very good correlation ( p < 0.001 ) with each other , with an r ranging from 0.808 ( gold vs joensuu ) to 0.957 ( miettinen 2002 vs miettinen / afip ) ( table 2 and supplementary table 3 ) .

the presence of pdgfra mutations is relatively high with a frequency of 16.3 % .
supplementary fig. 2 shows the distribution of mutated genes compared with age .
the number of patients with mutational analysis performed increased during the years of study from 5.2 % in 2003 to 29.4 % in 2012 ( p = 0.000 ) .
the frequency of reported mutational analysis increased from low risk tumours ( 24.7 %) to the high risk group ( 67.1 %) ( p = 0.000 ) ( supplementary table 4 and table 3 ) .

most of these patients were not tested for sdh deficiency or braf mutations centres of diagnosis , resection and revision fifty two laboratories diagnosed gist and 49 laboratories had at least one surgical resection specimen during the two years for which we requested full pathology reports .
the pathology department of five gist centres in the netherlands diagnosed and revised more than 30 pathology resection specimens (> 15 / year ) of gist in 2011 and 2012 ( 15 laboratories <= 5 specimens , 25 laboratories 6 - 20 specimens , 4 laboratories 20 - 30 specimens in these 2 years and 3 no specimen ) .
if this cut - off of > 15 pathology specimens of gist / year is used as definition of a gist reference centre and with inclusion of all the regional soft tissue pathology panels , then for 13.2 % of patients , the primary diagnosis was established in a gist centre , surgery was done in 16.2 % of the patients in a gist centre and 35.9 % of the patients were diagnosed or had a revision of their diagnosis within 3 months in a gist reference centre .
no significant increase was found in the number of pathology revisions over the years of study ( 2003 28.7 % , 2012 41.2 % of patients ) , although there seems to be an increasing trend in the number of reviews after the guidelines of 2010 ( supplementary table 5 ) .
it was also assessed whether the pathology specimens revised by a reference centre or specialised soft tissue pathology panel were high risk classified patients according to the miettinen / afip criteria .
only 30.9 % of the patients with a full pathology report with no risk for recurrence had a revision of the pathology diagnosis compared to 67.1 % of the patients with a high risk ( supplementary table 4 ). of all patients with a resection and a revision in a reference centre , 61.2 % had mutational analysis performed compared to 10.4 % of all the other patients .
last , we analysed whether high risk patients diagnosed in 2011 and 2012 had a mutation analysis. of the patients diagnosed in a gist reference centre , 92.3 % had a mutation analysis , but only 16.7 % of the patients diagnosed in one of the other centres .
discussion the current study shows an increase in incidence of pathology proven gist from 12.2 to 17.7 per million inhabitants between 2003 and 2012 .
this increase in incidence is also found in several other studies , like the seer study ( seer database study , standardised to the 2000 us standard population , 2001 : 5.5 / million , 2011 7.8 / million ) [ 8 ] , a taiwanese study ( taiwanese cancer registry , standardised to the 2000 us standard population , 1998 : 11.3 / million , 2008 : 19.7 / million ) [ 6 ] and last a study from shanghai ( shanghai cancer registry , who standardised , 2004 : 10.1 / million , 2008 : 14.5 / million ) [ 7 ] .
none of these studies report a cause for this increase .
studies reporting incidences before 2000 report also an increase in incidence ; however , this is caused by the introduction of cd117 immunohistochemistry to identify gist .
[ 10 ] we can only hypothesise about the cause of the increase in the netherlands .
first , it could be an increased use of diagnostic procedures such as ct scans , gastroscopy and endoscopic ultrasound , which is supported by the increase in number of patients with a small tumour size .
another possible reason is an increased awareness of the diagnosis after the introduction of imatinib as effective treatment .
the last possibility could be a real increase in the incidence ; although this is a possibility , until now no causal factors or risk factors for the development of gist are known .
the difference in crude incidence for 2003 in the goettsch paper [ 4 ] and our paper ( our data 174 patients vs. goettsch 206 patients ) could be explained by the revision of historical pathology specimens after 2003 or by improvements in patient identification by palga , resulting in less double counted patients for incidence analysis .
the incidence of 17.7 per million inhabitants is to the upper limit of reported incidences , although comparison is hampered by a lack of standardised incidence rates [ 5 - 10 ] .
this high incidence rate is probably caused by one of the strengths of our study : the way palga registers diagnoses .
palga is a fully automated archive of pathology reports , with 100 % coverage of all dutch pathology reports and registers also small and incidental gists not appearing in cancer registries. with the addition of the extensive search , the long study period and the inclusion of small and incidentally found gists , this study gives the best possible estimate of gist incidence .
most of the earlier studies used cancer registries that use a health care provider notification system , which is probably biased as small and incidentally found gists are clinically less relevant as was shown in a recent study [ 11 ] .
a dutch cancer registry ( dcr ) study on rare cancers reported an incidence of 9 per million inhabitants for 2004 - 2008 compared to an incidence of 13.8 to 15.8 per million in our study [ 38 ] .
the dcr is probably not registering small gists , explaining the difference .
the esmo guideline of 2010 recommends to perform mutation analysis in all gists , because mutational status is related both to prognosis and efficacy of treatment .
however , only a minority of patients in 2011 and 2012 ( 33.9 %) had mutational status reported .
[ 16 , 17 , 27 ] when considering high risk patients , mutational analysis was performed in 67.1 % of patients [ 16 , 17 ] .
because this study is based on pathology reports , exact reasons for not performing mutational analysis are not known .
almost all patients with a high risk gist and a primary diagnosis or revision in a gist centre had a mutational analysis ( 2011 and 2012 92.3 %) compared with a much lower rate in the non - gist centres ( 2011 and 2012 16.7 %) , explaining the rather low rate of mutational analysis performed in high risk patients and stressing the importance of referring patients to a gist centre .
the frequency of mutations was in line with that reported in a french study [ 5 ] .
pdgfra mutant gist was slightly overrepresented , which may be explained by the imatinib resistance of pdgfra - mutated gist and therefore due to progression leading to an indication for mutation analysis [ 39 ] .
the relative high percentage of patients which were characterised as wild - type could have technical reasons because most patients were only sequenced for kit and pdgfra mutations in the most common hotspots .
in the past , risk classification was not incorporated in the guidelines , and so , mitotic rate and size were often not reported in the conclusion .
to get a better overview of the risk classifications , we requested full pathology reports for all patients with a resection in 2011 and 2012 .
comparing the different risk classifications , it seems that the gold and miettinen 2002 criteria allocate more patients to the highest risk category compared with the other known risk stratifications , but comparison is difficult because these classifications do not include exactly the same patients in our analysis .
for example , both the joensuu and the miettinen 2002 criteria do only provide stratification rules for gastric and intestinal tumours .
also , the number of risk groups differs between classifications .
these factors hamper comparison of the different stratifications .
since 2008 the esmo guideline recommends mutation analysis for all gists and the 2010 guidelines recommends revision of pathology by an expert pathologist , we here show that in 2012 only 41.2 % of patients had a revision of pathology within 3 months and only 29.4 % of patients had mutational analysis performed .
this was much better for high risk patients ( based on the miettinen / afip classification ) with 67.1 % for both mutational analysis and pathology review .
in conclusion , this is the second nationwide gist incidence study ever performed in the netherlands and follows the previous study in the netherlands in 2003 [ 4 ] .
it shows that the registered incidence of gist has risen from 12.2 to 17.7 per million , which can be partly explained by an increase in the incidence of small gists .
both the gold risk assessment and the miettinen 2002 criteria seem to allocate more patients than the other commonly used risk classification systems to a high risk category .
we found that the majority of pathology reports currently do not contain the recommended data of the esmo guideline .
so , the incidence of gists apparently increases , mainly due to the increase of small gist and for these small gists , the guidelines are probably less well adhered to. electronic supplementary material esm 1 ( docx 54.4 kb ) esm 2 ( docx 263 kb ) esm 3 ( docx 13.5 kb ) esm 4 ( docx 12.7 kb ) esm 5 ( docx 13.4 kb ) esm 6 ( docx 12.2 kb ) esm 7 ( docx 12 kb ) for the members of the palga group see below electronic supplementary material the online version of this article ( 10.1007 / s00428 - 017 - 2285 - x ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .

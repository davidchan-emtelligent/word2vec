we report here the draft genome of staphylococcus aureus causing clinical mastitis in a cow from india .
it is a major causative agent of mastitis and , further , livestock - associated strains are emerging as a potential threat to public health , thereby warranting studies to understand the genome of this deadly pathogen .
cover - datejuly / august 2015 genome announcement staphylococcus aureus is a highly opportunistic pathogen causing infections in humans and animals .
it is majorly responsible for bovine mastitis in animals , which results in a decrease in milk quality and leads to economic losses ( 1 ) .
further , the zoonotic potential of s. aureus strains and the few studies on livestock - associated strains make it crucial to understand the genome of the strain for in - depth analysis ( 2 ) .
the s. aureus strain used in this study was isolated from the milk from a cow suffering from clinical mastitis in a dairy herd of india .
the genomic dna was extracted using wizard genomic kit ( promega ) and with the initial addition of lysostaphin ( 100 microg / ml ) and lysozyme ( 100 microg / ml ) for proper lysis of the cells .
multilocus sequence typing ( mlst ) revealed that the strain belongs to a new group , sequence type 3176 ( st3176 ) ( sequence submitted to http :// saureus.mlst.net ) .
here , we report the draft genome of s. aureus strain from a cow infected with mastitis , belonging to a new st group , 3176 .
genomic dna was mechanically sheared , and for 300 - to 350 - bp fragments , paired - end sequencing was done using illumina miseq .
trimming for removing illumina adapter sequences and removal of low - quality bases were done using the cutadapt ( 3 ) and sickle ( 4 ) softwares , respectively .
a total of 4,478,850 reads passed through the quality filter , with an overall g + c content of 37.15 % .
draft genome assembly was performed using spades ( 5 ) assembler , which predicted the size of the genome to be 2.842 mb , composed of 87 contigs .
coding sequences ( cdss ) were predicted from the contigs using glimmer ( 6 ) , which predicted 2,835 coding sequences .
the predicted cdss were compared with ncbi nonredundant protein database using the blastx program , which showed similarity to genes present in other fully sequenced s. aureus genomes .
the predicted cdss were annotated using the contig annotator pipeline ( canopi ) , which considers the best hit ( e value , <= 10e - 5 ; similarity score , >= 40 %) for functional assignment .
blast analysis showed closest similarity of the genome with s. aureus strain c0673 .
this is a first - draft genome sequencing project from india utilizing an s. aureus strain isolated from a bovine mastitis case , and the genome analysis will further help us understand the genome of the pathogenic strain .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
this whole - genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj / embl / genbank under the accession no. lfxb00000000 .
the version described in this paper is version lfxb01000000 .

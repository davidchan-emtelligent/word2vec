background medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood .
the identification of critical genes involved in its pathogenesis will be central to advances in our understanding of its molecular basis , and the development of improved therapeutic approaches .
methodology / principal findings we performed a snp - array based genome - wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines , to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion , which may harbour critical disease genes .
a series of novel and established medulloblastoma defects were detected ( myc amplification ( n = 4 ) , 17q21.31 high - level gain ( n = 1 ) ; 9p21.1 - p21.3 ( n = 1 ) and 6q23.1 ( n = 1 ) homozygous deletion ) .
most notably , a novel recurrent region of genomic amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 was identified ( n = 2 ) , and selected for further investigation .
additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( ifish ) , pcr - based mapping and snp - array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 is independent of myc amplification at 8q24.21 , and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types , suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development .
detailed mapping identified a 3mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes ( zfat1 , loc286094 , khdrbs3 ) and two genes encoding micro - rnas ( hsa - mir - 30b , hsa - mir - 30d ). of these , only expression of hsa - mir - 30b , hsa - mir - 30d and khdrbs3 correlated with copy number status , and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub - sets of primary medulloblastomas , measured relative to the normal cerebellum .
conclusions / significance these data implicate hsa - mir - 30b , hsa - mir - 30d and khdrbs3 as putative oncogenic target ( s ) of a novel recurrent medulloblastoma amplicon at 8q24.22 - q24.23 .
our findings suggest critical roles for these genes in medulloblastoma development , and further support the contribution of micro - rna species to medulloblastoma pathogenesis .
introduction medulloblastoma is an invasive embryonal tumour of the cerebellum , and the most common malignant brain tumour in children .
although overall five - year survival rates of 60 - 70 % are now achieved , a significant proportion of cases will die from their disease , and the intensive chemotherapeutic and radiotherapy regimes employed in treatment are associated with long - term neuroendocrine and cognitive dysfunction in surviving patients .
advances in our understanding of the biology of medulloblastoma will be essential to future improvements in therapeutic outcome , through strategies including the identification of specific targets for the development of novel therapies , and biomarkers for improved treatment stratification [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the identification of specific genetic defects has been central to advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma .
a series of non - randomly mutated genes have been identified , which have , in turn , led to the characterisation of critical roles for their associated biological pathways in sub - sets of cases ; the wnt / wingless ( wnt ) signalling pathway is activated by mechanisms including ctnnb1 mutation in 10 - 15 % cases , and the sonic hedgehog ( shh ) pathway in activated in a further 20 - 25 % , predominantly by mutations in ptch1 [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
the most prevalent genomic amplifications reported to date affect the myc and mycn oncogenes ( each in 5 - 15 % of cases ) , and homozygous deletions of established tumour suppressor genes , including cdkn2a and p14arf , have been described [ 6 ] - [ 8 ] .
importantly , genetic defects have therapeutic relevance ; markers of favourable ( wnt activation ) and poor ( myc / mycn amplification ) prognosis have been identified and validated in clinical trials cohorts [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , and small molecule inhibitors of the shh pathway are under pre - clinical development [ 11 ] .
despite these advances , the critical genes involved in medulloblastoma development are otherwise poorly understood , and specific genetic defects remain to be identified in the majority of cases .
we therefore undertook a comprehensive snp - array based analysis of copy number defects in medulloblastoma cell lines , to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion , which may harbour critical medulloblastoma genes .
we report the validation , mapping and further characterisation of recurrent novel genetic regions identified , in medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumours , and use these data to identify putative target gene ( s ) which may contribute to medulloblastoma development .
methods primary tumours , tissues and cell lines 37 primary medulloblastoma samples were analysed in this study .
the cohort included 22 male and 14 female patients ( 1 unknown ) , aged 1.3 to 40 years at diagnosis ( 1 infant (< 3 years ) , 31 children (>= 3 to 15 years ) and 4 adults (>= 16 years )) .
histopathological review identified 27 cases of classic medulloblastoma , 4 cases of nodular / desmoplastic medulloblastoma , 5 cases of large - cell / anaplastic medulloblastoma and one case of undefined histological variant [ 12 ] .
four non - neoplastic cerebellar samples ( aged 10 months to 67 years ) were also investigated .
all aspects of this study have been approved by the newcastle & north tyneside nhs trust research ethics committee ( approval 07 / q0905 / 71 ) .
written informed consent for tumour collection , storage and research was obtained for all primary medulloblastomas , from participants or their parents / legal guardians .
under the terms of the research ethics committee approval for this study , and the uk human tissue act ( 2006 ) , consent was not required for the normal cerebellar material , as it was collected prior to 2006 .
eight medulloblastoma cell lines were investigated ( daoy , d384med , d425med , d458med , d341med , d283med , mhh - med - 1 , mhh - med - 8a ) , cultured and maintained as previously described ( langdon et al. 2006 ) .
genomic dna from samples was extracted using the nucleon hard tissue kit ( nucleon biosciences ) or by the trizol method ( invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
rna was extracted from samples using the trizol method ( invitrogen ) , and treated with dnase i ( ambion ) to eliminate contaminating dna .
snp - array analysis genomic dna samples from the eight medulloblastoma cell lines were analysed using the genechip ( r ) mapping 10k 2.0 array ( affymetrix ) , and raw data processed using microsoft excel spreadsheets , as previously described [ 13 ] .
the raw snp array data is available freely from the cancer genome project , subject to completion of a data access agreement ( http :// www.sanger.ac.uk / genetics / cgp / archive /) .
data were used to identify markers displaying evidence of genomic amplification or homozygous deletion , which were defined as follows : intensity ratio ( or haploid copy number ( hcn ))> 2.5 , amplification or high - level gain ; hcn < 0.1 , homozygous deletion .
physical positions of probes and genes were identified according to the snp consortium ( tsc ) database ( http :// www.hapmap.org /) and the ncbi database build 36.2 ( http :// www.ncbi.nih.nlm.gov ) .
the estimated maximal regions of continuous defects affecting multiple probes were identified by the physical positions of the nearest flanking unaffected probe at each end .
quantitative real - time pcr analysis of hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d expression , measured relative to a u6 non - coding rna control , was performed using proprietary taqman ( r ) microrna real - time pcr assay primer sets and reagents ( applied biosystems ) , based on absolute quantification , following the manufacturer 's instructions .
all other analyses were performed using real - time pcr , based on the sybr green jumpstart taq readymix system ( sigma ) .
absolute quantification was applied to copy number analysis , whereas relative quantification was applied to expression analysis .
b2m , rplp0 and tbp were used as reference genes for copy number analysis , and 28s rrna was used as the reference gene for expression analysis .
details of primers used for these pcrs are shown in supplementary tables s1 , s2 & s3 .
all real - time pcr assays were undertaken on an abi prism 9700ht ( applied biosystems ) real - time pcr system .
fluorescence in situ hybridisation interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( ifish ) was performed in medulloblastoma cell lines using bac clones rp11 - 383n10 ( representing sequences at 8q24.23 ; obtained from the wellcome trust sanger institute , cambridge ) , dj968n11 ( representing myc [ 6 ]) and pz8.4 ( representing the centromere of chromosome 8 [ 6 ]) , as previously described [ 6 ] , [ 14 ] .
results snp - array based copy number analysis of medulloblastoma cell lines : identification of a novel region of recurrent genomic amplification at 8q23.22 - q23.24 specific to medulloblastoma raw 10k snp - array data generated from 8 medulloblastoma cell lines were analysed and converted to graphical plots , as previously described [ 13 ] .
wider chromosomal defects identified were consistent with our previous genome - wide studies of these cell lines using loss of heterozygosity and conventional comparative genomic hybridisation methods ( data not shown [ 14 ]) .
however , high - resolution snp array identified a number of focal defects for further investigation , and we elected to focus our analysis on these regions of putative genomic amplification or homozygous deletion , which may contain critical oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in medulloblastoma development .
defects affecting at least three consecutive markers were classified as significant and , using these criteria , evidence of both genomic amplifications and homozygous deletions were observed ( figure 1a ) , which are summarised in figure 1b .
the majority of these regions either harboured known critical cancer - related genes or affected previously described features of medulloblastoma ; amplification of myc at 8q24.21 , a well established feature of medulloblastoma [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , was the only recurrent event detected which affected an established cancer - related gene , seen in 4 / 8 cell lines analysed .
homozygous deletions of ( i ) the 9p21.1 - p21.3 region encompassing cdkn2a , cdkn2b and arf and ( ii ) the 6q23.1 region , each observed in a single cell line , have previously been reported in medulloblastoma and other cancer types [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
a novel high level gain / amplification at 17q21.31 , in conjunction with evidence of isochromosome ( 17q ) ( i ( 17q )) ( i.e. gain of the q - arm and loss of the p - arm of chromosome 17 ) , the most common cytogenetic feature of medulloblastoma [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , was found in the d425med line .

in this figure , two independent amplifications / high level gains at 8q24 are shown in d341med and d384med , as well as an amplification / high level gain at 17q21 in d425med and a homozygous deletion at 9p21 in daoy .

hcn , estimated haploid copy number ; hlg / amp , high level gain or genomic amplification ; hd , homozygous deletion .
notably , a single novel region of recurrent genomic high level gain / amplification was observed , at 8q23.22 - q23.24 , in two independent medulloblastoma cell lines ( d341med and d384med ) .
this novel feature at 8q24.22 - q24.23 is of particular interest since ( i ) it was observed in multiple cell lines , and ( ii ) no evidence of amplification at this region was found in the analysis of over 800 other cancer cell lines derived from a wide range of different paediatric and adult cancer types using the genechip ( r ) mapping 10k 2.0 array ( http :// www.sanger.ac.uk / cgi - bin / genetics / cgp / cghviewer / cghhome.cgi ) , suggesting this putative amplicon may contain gene ( s ) specifically related to medulloblastoma development .
additionally , we confirmed the independence of the d341med and d384med cell lines ; each displayed a unique allelotype and harboured distinct genomic defects [ 14 ] .
therefore , we elected to further characterise this novel region in detail , and its role in medulloblastoma .
verification , characterisation and physical mapping of the novel amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 in medulloblastoma cell lines the novel high - level gain / amplification observed at 8q24.22 - q24.23 in d341med and d384med cell lines by snp array was next investigated independently by ifish .
the bac - clone rp11 - 383n10 , which represents dna sequences within this amplicon ( figure 2e ) , was used as a probe , and confirmed the presence of dna amplification (> 10 copies per control centromeric signal ) in both cell lines ( figures 2a & b ) , but not in the other cell lines examined ( data not shown ) .

the relative copy number of each candidate gene is shown relative to the reference gene , b2m , and is shown as a log10 scale .
two replicate analyses of each sample were performed and the mean value is shown .
we noted that amplification of myc at 8q24.21 and the novel region at 8q24.22 - q24.23 was co - incident in both d341med and d384med .
although snp - array data indicate that the regions of amplification are discrete ( figure 1a ) , the relationship between this novel amplification and myc amplification at 8q24.21 , was assessed by co - hybridization of rp11 - 383n10 and bac probe dj968n11 , recognising myc , in d384med cells , to investigate whether their amplification was co - localised on a single amplicon .
the combined result from over 100 cells indicated a mixed pattern of amplification in the cell population ; myc amplification alone was observed in 32 % of cells , while the novel amplification alone was observed in 28 % of the cell population .
22 % of the cells showed amplification of both regions , but in two thirds of these cells , signals generated by the two bac probes were not co - localised ( figure 2c ) .
the amplification status and physical gene content of the novel amplicon was additionally investigated using real - time pcr - based mapping .
analysis of the status of the coding genes within and surrounding the putative amplicon ( figure 2e ) showed that zfat1 , loc286094 and khdrbs3 were amplified in both cell lines d341med and d384med , but not in the non - amplified mhh - med - 8a line .
the flanking genes , st3gal1 and flj45872 , at the proximal and distal ends respectively of the amplified region , did not shown any evidence of amplification in any cell line ( figure 2f ) .
loc100130092 , which encodes a predicted psudogene within the amplified region on the ncbi database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /) , was not investigated. by snp - array , physical mapping identified the amplicon extending from 134,810,164 bp ( tsc0062042 ) to 137,820,222 bp ( tsc0696464 ) in d341med , and from 134,810,164 bp ( tsc0062042 ) to 137,858,383 bp ( tsc1392944 ) in d384med , indicating a maximal common region of 3 mb , extending from 134,810,164 bp to 137,820,222 bp. together , these data indicate that the novel amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 is independent of myc amplification and has consecutive gene content in both d341med and d384med , with the involved regions extending from zfat1 at its proximal end to khdrbs3 at its distal end , and also encompasses loc286094 and two genes encoding micro - rnas ( mi - rnas ) , hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d .
identification of putative target gene ( s ) of the novel amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 : investigation of relationships between gene amplification and transcript levels to identify potential target genes of the novel amplification which may contribute to tumourigenesis , relationships between the transcript levels and copy numbers of genes contained in the novel amplicon were assessed in medulloblastoma cell lines using real - time pcr methods .
high - level expression of hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d was closely correlated with their copy number status ( figures 3a & b ) , suggesting these may represent targets .
no evidence of high - level expression of zfat1 or loc286094 , or correlation with gene copy number , was found in any cell line ( data not shown ) , suggesting these do not represent candidate target genes .
data obtained for khdrbs3 were less clear ; high - level expression was seen in three cell lines , however only one cell line of the three harboured the amplification , while no evidence of high - level expression was observed in the other amplified cell line ( figure 3c ) .
based on these findings , we next investigated the expression of the two mi - rnas and khdrbs3 in primary medulloblastomas and normal cerebellum , to further explore any roles in medulloblastoma development .

transcript levels of candidate amplicon target genes and mirnas in primary medulloblastomas and the normal cerebellum expression of mature hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d , as well as khdrbs3 , was analysed in cohorts of primary medulloblastoma samples , alongside four normal cerebellar samples , and data for medulloblastoma cell lines ( n = 8 ) ( figure 4 ) .
the highest mean level of expression observed in a normal cerebellar tissue sample was used as a threshold for the determination of overexpression in primary tumours and cell lines .
using these criteria , 54 % ( 14 / 26 ) , 12 % ( 3 / 26 ) and 15 % ( 3 / 20 ) of primary medulloblastomas showed evidence of overexpression of hsa - mir - 30b , hsa - mir - 30d , and khdrbs3 , respectively ( figure 4 ) .
high - level expression of hsa - mir - 30b , comparable to levels observed in 8q24.22 - q24.23 amplified cell lines , was observed in a sub - set of primary tumours .
high - level expression of khdrbs3 , equivalent to levels observed in an 8q24.22 - q24.23 amplified cell line , was also observed in a sub - set of primary tumours and other cell lines , but was not restricted to the 8q24.22 - q24.23 amplified cell lines .
although expression levels of hsa - mir - 30d in primary tumours were elevated relative to the normal cerebellum , they did not approach levels observed in 8q24.22 - q24.23 amplified cell lines .

analysis of genetic amplification at 8q24.22 - q24.23 in primary medulloblastomas the relative copy number of khdrbs3 , as a marker of the novel amplicon at 8q24.22 - q24.23 , was determined in all primary medulloblastoma samples in which the expression level was assessed ( n = 37 ) by qpcr ; no evidence of genomic amplification was observed ( data not shown ) .
discussion this genome - wide snp - array based screen has facilitated the characterisation of a series of focal regions of gene amplification and homozygous deletion in medulloblastoma , and the identification of putative target genes which may play critical roles in its development , and have therapeutic significance .
in addition to the identification and further validation of established genomic events in medulloblastoma ( e.g. myc amplification , cdkn2a / b homozygous deletion [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] - [ 8 ]) , defects have been identified which will , following further validation , aid investigations of the critical genetic targets of common medulloblastoma chromosomal aberrations .
i ( 17q ) is the most common chromosomal defect in medulloblastoma , affecting 30 - 40 % of cases , and chromosome 6 loss is characteristic of the molecular disease sub - group defined by activation of the wnt / wingless cell signalling pathway [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
the respective high level gain / amplification identified at 17q21.31 , and the homozygous deletion at 6q23.1 , will yield candidate target genes and facilitate the further mapping and investigation of these chromosomal aberrations .
the novel region of recurrent amplification identified at 8q24.33 - q24.23 formed the focus of our further investigations .
in addition to its recurrent nature , we have demonstrated its high - copy number amplification , independence of myc amplification , and uniqueness to medulloblastoma amongst a panel of > 800 cell lines derived from different tumour types , indicating this novel amplicon contains key gene ( s ) in medulloblastoma development , with the potential to inform critical insights to disease pathogenesis .
the identification of the genetic target ( s ) of this novel amplicon , and their validation in studies of primary tumours , and in functional models , is therefore now paramount .
our detailed genetic mapping of its physical location and gene content , and investigation of their relationship to gene expression in medulloblastoma cell lines , identified khsrbs3 and the genes encoding mi - rna species , hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d , as putative oncogenic targets whose expression is closely correlated with amplification status .
in primary tumours , although we did not detect evidence of amplification of this target region in our cohort of primary medulloblastomas , consistent with data from a recent snp - array screen of 212 primary medulloblastomas [ 8 ] , our investigations of the transcript levels of these target species further support roles in medulloblastoma .
based on these data , all three candidates , khsrbs3 , hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d , could be considered as potential targets of this novel amplification , as all showed elevated expression in a sub - set of primary medulloblastomas , measured relative to the normal cerebellum .
hsa - mir - 30b is arguably of most interest because , in addition to its high - level expression in cell lines which is closely correlated with amplification , it showed the greatest frequency of elevated expression in primary tumours ( over 50 % of cases ) , with expression levels detected in certain cases equivalent to those observed in amplified cell lines .
although such investigations were beyond the scope of the limited initial primary tumour cohort employed in the current study , the clinico - pathological correlates of expression of all candidates in extensive , well characterised , and statistically powered clinical cohorts , is additionally likely to inform any potential roles in medulloblastoma .
importantly , none of the three candidates can be fully excluded at this stage , and further investigations of their functional roles in medulloblastoma are required .
the function ( s ) of khdrbs3 , hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d , and in particular any roles they may play in tumourigenesis , have not been widely investigated , and this is the first study , to our knowledge , to investigate their status in medulloblastoma .
khdrbs3 ( kh domain containing , rna binding , signal transduction associated 3 ) belongs to a rna binding protein family , and regulates the variant splicing of certain target genes [ 17 ] .
although one published study has demonstrated that expression of khdrbs3 positively regulates telomerase activity in human colon cancer hct - 116 cells [ 18 ] , further details of khdrbs3 function and association with cancers are not clear .
similarly , hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d have not been well characterised .
array - based studies have confirmed their expression in human tissues [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] , however on - line databases ( e.g. mirbase ; http :// microrna.sanger.ac.uk /) predict > 800 mrna targets for each species , and their specific functions remain unclear .
nonetheless , the amplification and overexpression of hsa - mir - 30b and hsa - mir - 30d in medulloblastoma further supports an emerging role for the dysregulation of mi - rna species in medulloblastoma development [ 22 ] - [ 26 ] .
in summary , we have described a genome - wide screen of medulloblastoma cell lines to identify and characterise regions of gene amplification and homozygous deletion which may harbour critical genes in its development .
our findings implicate hsa - mir - 30b , hsa - mir - 30d and khdrbs3 as putative oncogenic target ( s ) of a novel recurrent medulloblastoma amplicon at 8q24.22 - q24.23 , which is independent of myc amplification and unique to this disease .
these data suggest specific and critical roles for these genes in medulloblastoma development for wider investigation , and further support the contribution of mi - rna species to medulloblastoma pathogenesis .

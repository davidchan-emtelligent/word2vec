the fight against disease mongering : generating knowledge for action we read with interest the article by moynihan and henry on disease mongering [ 1 ] .
the authors argued that disease mongering is the opportunistic exploitation of a widespread anxiety about frailty and of faith in scientific advance and " innovation. " in south asia there is a widespread preference for " fair skin " and this has been exploited by the manufacturers of " fairness creams . "
" white " skin has a colonial connotation of power and superiority .
the emergence of a " paler " global entertainment industry has served as a fillip to the marketing of an international beauty ideal [ 2 ] .
beauty pageant winners in india are all extraordinarily tall and breathtakingly slim , have light honey - colored skin , and peddle western ideals of beauty [ 3 ] .
south asian culture has carried within itself a capacity for female objectification .
matrimonial columns and web sites reveal the influence of a young woman 's skin color on her marketability to marriage partners [ 3 ] .
the craze for modern fairness creams has emerged in the last fifty years [ 2 ] .
international cosmetics giants were the initial manufacturers , but these days indian and south asian companies are playing an important role in the skin bleaching and cosmetic markets [ 2 , 3 ] .
fairness creams have been estimated to account for up to 40 % of the profits of the cosmetics industry [ 3 ] .
recently , a fairness cream has been launched exclusively for men [ 4 ] .
advertisements aim to produce a hierarchy of values based on the notion that " fairness " is an object of desire [ 2 ] .
being fair has been represented as an active process .
regular use of fairness creams has been claimed to halt the production of melanin and to bring out " natural " beauty .
promoting a particular body image or behavior pattern as the preferred one and then selling medicines or products to help people attain the particular ideal may be regarded as disease mongering [ 5 ] .
fairness cream manufacturers have exploited the preference for fair skin , portrayed it as a necessary prerequisite for success , and promoted the use of their product to achieve the ideal .
controlled studies on the efficacy and safety of fairness creams are lacking .
disease mongering companies form alliances with doctors , consumer groups , and the media to promote sales of their drugs .
fairness cream manufacturers sponsor beauty pageants and carry out an advertising blitz in the print and audiovisual media [ 3 ] .
they create hype about their product .
many leading manufacturers have expanded their range to include lotions , cold creams , and soaps .
most fairness creams are nonprescription products , and the medical profession may not be the main target of marketing professionals .
however , doctors as responsible and respected members of society have an important role to play in spreading awareness about this racial distortion of body image .
fairness creams may satisfy many of the criteria of disease mongering .
the issues of freedom of choice , economic impact ( personal and on the society ) , profits , social issues , and ideal body image should be seriously debated .

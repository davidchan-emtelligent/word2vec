long interspersed element - 1 ( line - 1 or l1 ) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes .
human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate l1 retrotransposition .
the apobec3 ( a3 ) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides ( c - to - u ) in single - strand dna substrates .
among these enzymes , apobec3a ( a3a ) is the most potent inhibitor of l1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays .
however , previous characterization of l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of a3a did not yield evidence of deamination .
thus , the molecular mechanism by which a3a inhibits l1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic .
here , we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that a3a can inhibit l1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single - strand dna that arises during the process of l1 integration .
these data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the a3a cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit l1 retrotransposition .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.02008.001 elife digest transposable elements are often referred to as ' jumping genes' because they can move between different locations within a genome .
these sequences of dna are found in many organisms and can make up a significant proportion of the genetic material : almost 50 % of the dna in the case of the human genome .
transposable elements are grouped by how they move to new locations in a genome .
some move by a cut - and - paste mechanism - - whereby the transposable element dna is removed from one location and inserted back at a new genomic location .
others , termed retrotransposons , move by a copy - and - paste mechanism : the dna sequence is transcribed into an rna intermediate , and then copied back into dna before being inserted into a new location .
retrotransposons can accumulate to great numbers in genomes : and one retrotransposon , called line - 1 , is present at an estimated 500,000 copies in the human genome .
although most copies of line - 1 are inactive , the average human genome contains about 80 - 100 that are predicted to be able to ' jump ' to new locations .
given that these retrotransposons could insert into , and disrupt , vital genes , it follows that our cells would have evolved ways to limit their movement .
an enzyme named apobec3a is known to limit the movement of line - 1 retrotransposons in cells .
apobec3a can alter the letters , or bases , that make up the genetic code .
this enzyme acts on single - strand dna to change ' c ' bases to ' u ' bases , which could explain how apobec3a combats line - 1 .
however , no evidence for such mutation of line - 1 sequences by apobec3a had been found to date .
now , richardson et al. recreate the copying of line - 1 rna back into dna in a test tube - - and reveal that apobec3a can mutate single - strand line - 1 dna .
critically , as long as the rna intermediate and dna copy remain together , the line - 1 dna is protected .
however , when line - 1 inserts into a new location the temporarily exposed single strand of line - 1 dna becomes susceptible to mutation by apobec3a .
human cells can detect and destroy ' u ' bases in dna - - and only by inhibiting this ability were richardson et al. able to observe apobec3a mutations in new line - 1 copies within the genomes of living cells .
richardson et al. speculate that the activity of apobec3 enzymes must strike a balance between limiting the spread of retrotransposons and minimizing the mutation of the cell 's own dna .
future work could address important questions , such as : do apobec enzymes affect the ' jumping ' of line - 1 retrotransposons in human reproductive cells and the early embryo , where new line - 1 insertions could be passed on to subsequent generations ?
also , does a loss of apobec3 activity lead to new line - 1 insertions in cancerous cells ? and does this effect how tumors form and / or progress ?
since apobec3 enzymes can cause mutations in cancers , they have been proposed as new targets for anti - cancer drugs - - therefore , it is crucial to uncover any harmful effects of inhibiting apobec3 enzymes that might limit the effectiveness of such treatments .

introduction long interspersed element - 1 ( line - 1 or l1 ) derived sequences comprise roughly 17 % of human genomic dna ( lander et al. , 2001 ) .
the vast majority of l1 sequences are 5 ' truncated , internally rearranged , or are inactivated by mutations and are unable to mobilize ( i.e. , retrotranspose ) to new genomic locations ( grimaldi et al. , 1984 ; lander et al. , 2001 ) .
however , it is estimated that the average human genome contains 80 - 100 retrotransposition - competent ( i.e. , active ) l1s ( sassaman et al. , 1997 ; brouha et al. , 2003 ) .
active human l1s are approximately 6 kb in length and contain a 5 ' untranslated region ( utr ) , two open reading frames ( orf1 and orf2 ) , and a 3 ' utr that terminates in a poly ( a ) tail ( scott et al. , 1987 ; dombroski et al. , 1991 ) .
orf1 encodes an ~ 40 kda protein ( orf1p ) that binds l1 rna as a trimer ( holmes et al. , 1992 ; hohjoh and singer , 1996 ; martin et al. , 2003 ; khazina and weichenrieder , 2009 ) .
orf1p also has nucleic acid chaperone activity ( martin and bushman , 2001 ; khazina and weichenrieder , 2009 ) .
orf2 encodes an ~ 150 kda protein ( orf2p ) ( ergun et al. , 2004 ; doucet et al. , 2010 ; taylor et al. , 2013b ) with dna endonuclease ( feng et al. , 1996 ) and reverse transcriptase ( mathias et al. , 1991 ) activities .
the development of a cultured cell assay definitively demonstrated that both orf1p and orf2p are required for efficient l1 retrotransposition ( moran et al. , 1996 ) .
subsequent biochemical studies revealed that l1 retrotransposition occurs by a mechanism termed target - site primed reverse transcription ( tprt ) ( luan et al. , 1993 ; feng et al. , 1996 ; cost et al. , 2002 ; kulpa and moran , 2006 ) .
ongoing l1 retrotransposition events contribute to intra - and inter - individual genetic variation and , on occasion , can disrupt gene function , leading to sporadic genetic diseases ( beck et al. , 2011 ; hancks and kazazian , 2012 ) .
given the mutagenic potential of active l1s , it is not surprising that host cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict l1 retrotransposition ( levin and moran , 2011 ) .
previous studies revealed that over - expression of the wild - type ( wt ) apobec3a cytidine deaminase protein ( a3a ) , but not deaminase - defective a3a mutants , could potently inhibit l1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells ( chen et al. , 2006 ; muckenfuss et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ; kinomoto et al. , 2007 ; niewiadomska et al. , 2007 ) .
however , deamination events were not detected in l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of wt a3a ( chen et al. , 2006 ; muckenfuss et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ; kinomoto et al. , 2007 ) .
thus , the molecular mechanism by which wt a3a inhibits l1 retrotransposition has remained a mystery .
here , we employ an in vitro assay ( l1 element amplification protocol or leap ) that recapitulates the first strand cdna synthesis step of the l1 integration to elucidate a mechanism for a3a - mediated inhibition of l1 retrotransposition .
in leap reactions that include rnase h , an enzyme that specifically degrades the rna strand of an rna / dna heteroduplex , we report that single - strand l1 cdnas are rendered susceptible to a3a - mediated deamination .
these data suggest that newly synthesized l1 cdnas remain annealed to their mrna templates after reverse transcription , protecting the l1 cdna from deamination by a3a .
we further demonstrate that engineered l1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co - express a3a and the uracil dna glycosylase inhibitor protein ( ugi ) contain strand - specific , a3a - mediated c - to - u deamination events .
together , these data indicate that a3a can inhibit l1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single - strand dna that arises during the process of l1 integration .
moreover , our results provide direct evidence that a3a can deaminate single - strand genomic dna in human cells .
results we used a cultured cell assay ( moran et al. , 1996 ; wei et al. , 2000 ) to determine the extent to which a3a inhibits retrotransposition of line elements that differ significantly in their nucleotide sequence and structure ( figure 1a ) .
the retrotransposition indicator cassette mneoi ( freeman et al. , 1994 ; moran et al. , 1996 ) was used to tag the 3 ' untranslated regions ( utrs ) of a human l1 ( pjm101 / l1.3 ) ( sassaman et al. , 1997 ) , a natural mouse l1 element ( tgf21 ) ( goodier et al. , 2001 ) , a synthetic mouse l1 element ( l1sm ) ( han and boeke , 2004 ) , and a line - 2 element from zebrafish ( zfl2 - 2 ) ( sugano et al. , 2006 ; figure 1a ) .
the mneoi cassette consists of an antisense neomycin phosphotransferase gene ( neo ) disrupted by an intron , which is in the same transcriptional orientation as the line element ( figure 1a ) .
this arrangement ensures that g418 - resistant foci arise only if the tagged line element undergoes successful retrotransposition ( freeman et al. , 1994 ; moran et al. , 1996 ) .
hela cells do not express endogenous a3a ( wissing et al. , 2011 ) , and therefore provide a system to measure directly the effects of ectopically expressed a3a on l1 retrotransposition .

a3a suppresses retrotransposition of distinct lines , but does not specifically inhibit l1 endonuclease activity .

additional control experiments .
( a ) strategy for a3a toxicity controls : l1 retrotransposition assays ( top schematic : an engineered l1 plasmid co - transfected with either an a3a or beta - arrestin expression vector ) were conducted in parallel with toxicity control assays ( bottom schematic : a linear or circular neo expression vector co - transfected with either an a3a or beta - arrestin expression vector ) .
the percentages of g418 - resistant colonies relative to the beta - arrestin control were determined in both experiments .
the results from the toxicity control experiments were used to normalize data from the corresponding l1 retrotransposition assays .
( b ) a3a expression inhibits l1 retrotransposition despite exhibiting some cytotoxicity : hela cells were transfected with 1 mug of pjm101 / l1.3 or pu6i neo expression vector , and increasing amounts of a3a expression vector ( from 0.0 mug to 3.0 mug ) .
the remaining plasmid mass included the beta - arrestin expression vector .
thus , each co - transfection consisted of a total plasmid mass of 4 mug .

data are expressed as the mean percent g418 - resistant colonies derived from two independent experiments consisting of two technical replicates each , with error bars representing the standard deviation among all four technical replicates .

the y - axis indicates the normalized percent of retrotransposition in the presence of a beta - arrestin ( black bars ) or a3a ( gray bars ) expression plasmid .
data were normalized relative to the linear neo control .
data are expressed as the mean percent retrotransposition derived from two independent experiments consisting of three technical replicates each , with error bars representing the standard deviation among all six technical replicates .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.02008.004 we co - transfected hela cells with retroelement expression constructs and plasmids encoding wt a3a or a deaminase - deficient mutant , a3a - c106s ( chen et al. , 2006 ) .
as a control we included beta - arrestin , which does not significantly affect l1 retrotransposition ( bogerd et al. , 2006b ) .
a3a expression inhibited human l1.3 retrotransposition to ~ 28 % of control levels ( figure 1b ) , in agreement with previous reports ( chen et al. , 2006 ; muckenfuss et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ) .
in comparison to control levels , a3a also inhibited retrotransposition of tgf21 ( to ~ 20 %) , zfl2 - 2 ( to ~ 17 %) , and l1sm ( to ~ 61 %) ( figure 1b ) .
the milder inhibition of a3a on l1sm retrotransposition may be due to the gc - rich nature of the l1sm transcript , the elevated steady state levels of l1sm mrna , and / or an increased number of l1sm retrotransposition events per cell ( han and boeke , 2004 ) .
additional controls revealed that the reduction of g418 - resistant hela cell foci observed in the presence of a3a reflects specific inhibition of l1 retrotransposition , rather than non - specific cytotoxicity ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1a - c ; see methods and materials ) .
a deaminase - deficient mutant , a3a - c106s , did not significantly restrict retroelement mobility ( figure 1b ) , in agreement with previous studies ( chen et al. , 2006 ; muckenfuss et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ) .
moreover , a3a inhibited l1.3 retrotransposition when it was expressed from its native 5'utr on a non - episomal vector ( figure 1 - - figure supplement 1d : pks101 / l1.3 / sv +) .
together , these experiments show that a3a inhibits retrotransposition of diverse line elements in cultured cells .
since line element retrotransposition proceeds by target - site primed reverse transcription ( tprt ) , which requires element - encoded endonuclease ( en ) and reverse transcriptase ( rt ) activities ( luan et al. , 1993 ; feng et al. , 1996 ) , we investigated whether a3a specifically interferes with l1 en or l1 rt activity .
in addition to canonical tprt , human l1s can mobilize by an alternative , endonuclease - independent retrotransposition mechanism ( eni ) in cells that lack p53 activity and are defective for components of the non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) dna repair machinery ( morrish et al. , 2002 , 2007 ; coufal et al. , 2011 ) .
we reasoned that if a3a specifically inhibits l1 en activity , eni l1 retrotransposition events should escape a3a inhibition .
to test this hypothesis , we co - transfected a human l1 ( either wt pad2te1 or en - deficient pad136 [ doucet et al. , 2010 ]) and a wt a3a expression construct into chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cell lines that are nhej - proficient ( 4364a ) or nhej - deficient ( xr - 1 ) ( morrish et al. , 2002 , 2007 ) .
a3a expression inhibited wt l1 retrotransposition in both cell lines , and also inhibited eni retrotransposition in xr - 1 cells ( figure 1c ) .
these data demonstrate a3a can inhibit l1 retrotransposition in a hamster cell line and that the a3a - mediated reduction of l1 retrotransposition is not due to inhibition of l1 en activity .
to test whether a3a inhibits l1 rt activity , we performed in vitro leap assays ( kulpa and moran , 2006 ) with ribonucleoprotein particle ( rnp ) preparations derived from cells transfected with an engineered l1 construct ( figure 2a ) .
we purified recombinant wt a3a ( ra3a ) ( figure 2 - - figure supplement 1a,b ) and deaminase - deficient ( ra3a _ c106s ) ( data not shown ) proteins from escherichia coli .
as expected ra3a had cytidine deaminase activity on single - strand ( figure 2b ) , but not on double - stranded dna ( figure 2 - - figure supplement 1c ) , whereas ra3a _ c106s lacked appreciable deaminase activity ( figure 2b ) .
incorporating increasing amounts of ra3a or ra3a _ c106s into leap or moloney murine leukemia virus ( mmlv ) rt reactions did not significantly affect the synthesis of l1 or mmlv - derived cdna products ( figure 2c , figure 2 - - figure supplement 1d ) .
thus , a3a does not specifically block l1 rt activity .
10.7554 / elife.02008.005 figure 2 .
recombinant a3a ( ra3a ) deaminates l1 cdnas in vitro .
( a ) leap assay rationale : l1 rnp preparations consisting of the l1 rna ( gray ) , l1 orf1p ( white ovals ) , and l1 orf2p ( blue oval ) are incubated with a 3 ' race primer consisting of a unique adapter sequence that contains a single cytidine ( red ) followed by an oligo dt sequence ( black lettering ) .
after reverse transcription ( blue arrow ) , the resultant l1 cdnas ( blue line ) are pcr amplified using primers specific to the engineered l1 and the unique adapter sequence ( green arrows ) .
( b ) recombinant a3a has deaminase activity in vitro : twofold serial dilutions ( 500 ng - 15.62 ng ) of wt ra3a ( left panel ) or deaminase - deficient ra3a _ c106s ( right panel ) were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) labeled single - strand dna oligonucleotide containing a single cytidine residue .

hela indicates untransfected hela cells ; no rnp indicates control reactions lacking rnps .
increasing amounts of ra3a ( ng ) did not significantly affect leap activity .
samples containing a deaminase - deficient ra3a _ c106s , a heat killed ra3a ( hk ) , or without leap products ( h2o ) served as controls .
mmlv rt reactions ( lower gel ) confirm the integrity of purified rna isolated from rnp preps used in the leap assay .
notably , the increased size of the en - rnp rt products is due to a higher molecular weight product generated from pjjh230a / l1.3 , which contains an mblasti indicator cassette instead of an mneoi indicator cassette .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.02008.009 to determine whether a3a can deaminate l1 cdnas in vitro , we sequenced 100 l1 cdna products from leap reactions conducted in the absence of a3a ( no ra3a ) or in the presence of ra3a or deaminase - deficient ra3a _ c106s .
we did not detect significant numbers of c - to - u deamination events in l1 cdnas derived from leap reactions in the absence of ra3a or the presence of ra3a _ c106s ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast , leap products generated in the presence of ra3a contained abundant c - to - u editing that was most frequent at the single 5 ' - tca - 3 ' consensus a3a deamination site ( chen et al. , 2006 ) present in the single - strand oligonucleotide adapter used to prime l1 rt reactions ( figure 2d , figure 2 - - figure supplement 2 , top chart in the middle panel , 91 of 100 ( 91 %) total 5 ' - tca - 3 ' sites within the 100 single - strand oligonucleotide adapters showed evidence of deamination ) .
however , far less deamination was detected within l1 cdna leap products at the six internal 5 ' - tca - 3 ' sites ( figure 2d , figure 2 - - figure supplement 2 , top chart in the middle panel , only 25 of 600 ( 4.2 %) 5 ' - tca - 3 ' sites within the 100 l1 cdna products showed evidence of deamination ) .
the non - uniform pattern of deamination events observed above suggested that the l1 cdna may remain annealed to l1 mrna , generating l1 mrna / cdna heteroduplexes after reverse transcription , thereby leaving only the single - strand oligonucleotide leap adapter susceptible to deamination .
thus , we tested whether inclusion of rnase h into leap reactions renders l1 cdna susceptible to deamination .
in the presence of ra3a and rnase h , 228 of 600 ( 38 %) 5 ' - tca - 3 ' substrates within the l1 cdnas showed evidence of deamination ( figure 2d , figure 2 - - figure supplement 2 , bottom chart in the middle panel ) .
importantly , sequencing revealed differing poly ( a ) tail lengths and unique deamination patterns in each of the 100 leap products , indicating that they were derived from independent l1 cdnas ( figure 2 - - figure supplement 3 , panel e ; figure 2 - - figure supplement 4 ) .
in contrast , in the presence of ra3a _ c106s and rnase h , only 6.7 % of 5 ' - tca - 3 ' substrates within 100 l1 cdnas demonstrated evidence of deamination ( figure 2d , figure 2 - - figure supplement 2 , bottom chart in the right panel ) .
similarly , in reactions conducted with rnase h alone , 4.2 % of 5 ' - tca - 3 ' substrates within 100 l1 cdnas contained signatures of deamination ( figure 2d , figure 2 - - figure supplement 2 , bottom chart in the left panel ) .
the slightly increased number of deamination events observed with rnase h alone may reflect endogenous cytidine deaminase activity present in hela rnp preparations .
apobec3b ( a3b ) might be responsible for these events as it is expressed in hela cells and can suppress l1 retrotransposition ( chen et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ; wissing et al. , 2011 ) .
these results suggest that the l1 cdna , when annealed to the l1 mrna in an mrna / cdna heteroduplex , is protected from mutation by cellular deaminases .
our results demonstrated that ra3a could deaminate single - strand l1 cdnas in vitro .
we therefore hypothesized that a3a may deaminate transiently exposed single - strand dna intermediates that arise during l1 tprt in cultured cells .
uridine residues are efficiently removed from dna through combined actions of uracil dna glycosylase ( ung ) and apurinic / apyrimidinic endonuclease ( ape ) ( krokan et al. , 2002 ) .
in principle , these activities could repair and / or degrade deaminated single - strand dnas that arise during tprt .
degradation of deaminated retrotransposition intermediates would reduce l1 retrotransposition levels in cultured cell assays and could , in principle , eliminate evidence of a3a - mediated deamination events in the resultant retrotransposed l1 sequences .
such a scenario could explain why previous studies failed to detect a3a - mediated deamination events in engineered l1 retrotransposition events ( chen et al. , 2006 ; muckenfuss et al. , 2006 ; bogerd et al. , 2006b ; kinomoto et al. , 2007 ) .
to test whether ung contributed to the inhibition of l1 retrotransposition downstream of a3a activity , we conducted l1 retrotransposition assays in the presence of codon optimized bacteriophage - derived uracil dna glycosylase inhibitor ( ugi ) that selectively inhibits ung activity ( kaiser and emerman , 2006 ; figure 3a ) .
remarkably , ugi expression from a transfected plasmid ( plgcx _ ugi ) alleviated a3a - mediated l1 inhibition by ~ twofold ( figure 3b : from ~ 25 % to ~ 57 % of control levels ) .
in contrast , ugi expression had little effect on l1 retrotransposition activity in assays conducted in the presence of a3a deaminase mutant ( a3a - c106s ) or beta - arrestin control ( figure 3b ) .
similarly , ugi expression did not affect the ability of deaminase - deficient a3b mutants ( bogerd et al. , 2006b ) to inhibit l1 retrotransposition ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 1a : see a3b _ n - term and a3b _ cs data ) .
thus , ugi expression specifically alleviates a deaminase - dependent mechanism of l1 retrotransposition inhibition .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.02008.015 we hypothesized that ugi expression should allow the detection of a3a - mediated c - to - u deamination events in retrotransposed l1s .
thus , we co - transfected hela cells with a3a , ugi , and pjm140 / l1.3 / delta2 / k7 , an engineered l1 vector that contains both an mneoi retrotransposition cassette and a cole1 bacterial origin of replication ( gilbert et al. , 2002 , 2005 ) ( figure 3a ) .
this modified cassette facilitates recovery of engineered l1 retrotransposition events and their associated flanking genomic dna sequences as autonomously replicating , kanamycin - resistant plasmids in bacteria ( gilbert et al. , 2002 , 2005 ) .
characterization of 12 independent retrotransposition events revealed four g - to - a mutations on the l1 coding strand , which correspond to c - to - u deamination events on the ( - ) strand l1 cdna ( figure 3c ) .
notably , the 5 ' target - site duplication ( tsd ) of one insertion contained a c - to - t change within a 5 ' - tca - 3 ' consensus a3a deamination site in flanking genomic dna .
this putative a3a - mediated deamination event led to an inexact tsd flanking a newly retrotransposed l1 ( figure 3d ) .
to gain further evidence for a3a - mediated deamination of l1 retrotransposition events , we employed a stable ugi - expressing u2os cell line ( landry et al. , 2011 ) ( figure 3a : right side ) .
this strategy ensured that ung activity is inhibited before co - transfection of l1 and a3a expression plasmids ( landry et al. , 2011 ) .
in control u2os cells , transfection of a low amount of a3a plasmid ( 25 ng ) inhibited retrotransposition to ~ 28.0 % of control levels without substantial cytotoxicity ( figure 3e , figure 3 - - figure supplement 1b ). by comparison , in u2os _ ugi - expressing cells , a3a only slightly inhibited l1 retrotransposition ( figure 3e : to ~ 83 % of control levels ; figure 3 - - figure supplement 1c ) .
thus , consistent with experiments performed in hela cells , stable ugi expression relieves a3a - mediated inhibition of l1 retrotransposition in u2os cells .
we next analyzed sequences of engineered l1 retrotransposition events .
we used pjm140 / l1.3 / delta2 / k7 to generate a panel of clonal g418 - resistant u2os _ ugi cell lines , isolated the resultant l1 retrotransposition events , and examined them for evidence of a3a - mediated deamination .
characterization of 24 control l1 retrotransposition events did not reveal any g - to - a mutations ( figure 3f , top panel , figure 3 - - figure supplement 2 ) .
similarly , characterization of 30 l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of a3a - c106s revealed only five g - to - a mutations ( figure 3f , middle panel , figure 3 - - figure supplement 3 ) .
in contrast , characterization of 33 l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of a3a revealed 39 g - to - a mutations ( figure 3f , bottom panel , figure 3 - - figure supplement 4 ) .
the a3a - induced mutations occurred in a strand - specific manner ( i.e. , we only detected one c - to - t mutation on the l1 coding strand ) , and far outnumbered any other nucleotide changes in retrotransposed products .
notably , one mutation ( pjm140 / l1.3 / delta2 / k7 : g - 5390 - a ) introduced a premature termination codon into l1 orf2 , which would create a 145 amino acid truncation in orf2p .
this mutation reduced l1 retrotransposition efficiency to ~ 10 % of control levels ( figure 3 - - figure supplement 5 ) .
thus , coupled with identification of a deamination - induced mutation in genomic dna flanking a newly retrotransposed l1 ( figure 3d ) , these data suggest that the detected a3a - mediated deamination events occur on single - strand dna during tprt rather than on l1 mrna or single - strand episomal plasmid dna prior to l1 retrotransposition .
discussion we propose a straightforward model for how a3a inhibits l1 retrotransposition ( figure 4 ) .
in the presence of cellular rnase h , the ( - ) strand l1 cdna becomes vulnerable to a3a deamination ( figure 4a ) .
normally , these events would be repaired by combined actions of ung and ape , which we speculate could lead to the integration of a 5 ' truncated l1 cdna that lacks evidence of deamination .
however , in the presence of ectopically expressed ugi , a3a - mediated deamination events become unveiled in the retrotransposed l1s ( figure 3d,f , 4a ) .
we further propose that a3a can act on transiently exposed single - strand genomic dna flanking l1 integration sites ( figure 4b,c ) .
the deamination of 5 ' - flanking top - strand genomic dna could account for generation of inexact target - site duplications ( figure 3d ) .
interestingly , the structure of the proposed l1 integration intermediate resembles r - loop intermediates , formed during immunoglobulin class switching , that are targeted by an a3a related enzyme , activation - induced cytidine deaminase ( aid ) ( goodman et al. , 2007 ) .
the deamination of 3 ' flanking bottom - strand genomic dna , in principle , could also lead to the generation of inexact tsds ( figure 4c ) .
while we did not observe these events in cultured cells , we did observe deamination events in the single - strand dna oligonucleotide primer used to simulate 3 ' flanking genomic dna in leap assays ( figure 2d ) .
it is intriguing to speculate that , in the absence of ugi , a3a - mediated editing within 3 ' flanking bottom - strand genomic dna could ultimately lead to loss of the l1 cdna .
indeed , the ercc1 / xpf endonuclease has been implicated in limiting l1 retrotransposition by cleaving the transiently exposed single - strand 3 ' flanking bottom - strand genomic dna during tprt ( gasior et al. , 2008 ) .
the dna lesion resulting from cleavage of this region could then be repaired using the top - strand genomic dna as a template , leaving no detectable evidence of thwarted l1 retrotransposition events .

a model for a3a - mediated inhibition of l1 retrotransposition .
the left side of the figure shows l1 integration reactions that occur via tprt .
the right side of the figure shows the predicted structures of the resultant l1 retrotransposition events .
shown are transiently exposed single - strand genomic dna regions that ultimately give rise to target site duplications ( tsds : orange lines ) , the l1 rna ( red line ) , the l1 cdna ( blue line ) , and the a3a protein ( green oval ) .
ugi expression ( red stop sign ) can inhibit ung activity .
( a ) deamination of the l1 cdna : in the presence of cellular rnase h , a3a - mediated deamination of the l1 ( - ) strand cdna ( blue lettering ) in the presence of ugi leads to c - to - t mutations on the l1 non - coding strand and g - to - a mutations on the l1 (+) coding strand .
( b ) deamination of the 5 ' flanking top - strand genomic dna : in the presence of ugi , deamination of the transiently exposed single - strand 5 ' flanking genomic dna ( top orange line ) during tprt results in c - to - t changes in the 5 ' tsd relative to the 3 ' tsd .
( c ) deamination of the 3 ' flanking bottom - strand genomic dna : in the presence of ugi , deamination of transiently exposed single - strand 3 ' flanking genomic dna during tprt , in principle , is predicted to result in a g - to - a change in the 3 ' tsd relative to the 5 ' tsd .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.02008.016 the over - expression of a3a does not abolish l1 retrotransposition completely , but reduces it to ~ 30 % of control levels .
moreover , some l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of a3a and ugi lacked evidence of deamination .
why and how some l1 retrotransposition events evade a3a - mediated deamination requires further study .
however , it is possible that ectopic a3a expression is too low to efficiently target l1 tprt intermediates in some cells or that l1 second - strand cdna synthesis occasionally is completed before a3a can gain access to tprt intermediates to deaminate single - strand l1 cdnas .
in sum , we conclude that deamination of transiently exposed single - strand dna arising during l1 tprt is responsible , at least in part , for a3a - mediated inhibition of l1 retrotransposition .
it is noteworthy that the mobility of an evolutionarily related bacterial group ii intron requires rnase h1 activity ( smith et al. , 2005 ) .
similarly , the related bombyx mori r2 retrotransposon rt can displace rna from rna / dna hybrids during second - strand cdna synthesis in vitro ( kurzynska - kokorniak et al. , 2007 ) .
we hypothesize that annealed l1 mrna protects the first - strand l1 cdna , and that cellular rnase h renders these l1 cdnas vulnerable to a3a deamination during tprt .
mechanistic insights gained from studying deaminase - dependent a3a - mediated l1 inhibition could be applicable to retroelement inhibition by other a3 proteins .
a3a expression is restricted to peripheral blood lymphocytes ( chen et al. , 2006 ; refsland et al. , 2010 ; stenglein et al. , 2010 ; thielen et al. , 2010 ; berger et al. , 2011 ; koning et al. , 2011 ) , suggesting that it does not play a physiological role in restricting heritable l1 retrotransposition events. by comparison , a3b , which like a3a localizes to the nucleus , is expressed in human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) ( bogerd et al. , 2006b ) and can restrict engineered l1 retrotransposition in hescs ( wissing et al. , 2011 ) .
since heritable l1 - mediated retrotransposition events can occur in the early human embryo ( de boer et al. , 2014 ; van den hurk et al. , 2007 ) , a3b may restrict heritable l1 retrotransposition events .
consistent with this notion , recent reports suggest that a3b is expressed at higher levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) when compared to non - human primate ipscs , and that a3b expression may , in part , account for the lower number of recent l1 insertions in the human genome compared to the chimpanzee genome ( marchetto et al. , 2013 ) .
intriguingly , an a3b deletion allele also is present at a high allele frequency in some human geographic populations ( kidd et al. , 2007 ) ; thus , it would be interesting to determine whether the loss of a3b correlates with increased frequency of de novo l1 insertions .
apobec3 activity has been implicated in genome hyper - mutation in numerous cancers ( roberts et al. , 2013 ; burns et al. , 2013a , 2013b ) .
it is interesting to speculate that apobec3 expression in cancers may restrict potentially deleterious l1 retrotransposition events , yet may exact a mutagenic cost by contributing to genome hyper - mutation ( narvaiza et al. , 2012 ) .
indeed , our results suggest that in addition to tprt , a3a may deaminate any transiently exposed single - strand region of genomic dna ( e.g. , those arising at replication forks or during transcription ) .
this hypothesis is consistent with recent reports indicating that resected single - strand dna , around dna breaks , is susceptible to hyper - mutation by apobec deamination ( nik - zainal et al. , 2012 ; roberts et al. , 2012 ; taylor et al. , 2013a ) .

the reduction of g418 - resistant foci in the presence of a3a was determined to be reliable and reproducible .
approximately eighteen hours after plating , transfections were carried out using the fugene 6 transfection reagent ( roche , switzerland ) and opti - mem ( life technologies ) , according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer ( 3 mul fugene and 97 mul opti - mem per one mug of dna transfected ) .
media were replaced the following day .
approximately 72 hr post - transfection , cells were subjected to selection with 400 mug / ml g418 ( life technologies ) .
g418 selection was carried out for 12 - 14 days and the selection media were replaced every other day .

an edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown , indicating the substantive concerns or comments ; minor concerns are not usually shown .
reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent ( see review process ) .
similarly , the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers .
thank you for sending your work entitled " apobec3a deaminates transiently exposed single - strand dna during line - 1 retrotransposition " for consideration at elife .
your article has been very favorably evaluated by a senior editor , a reviewing editor , and 3 reviewers .
the following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity : anne ferguson - smith ( reviewing editor ) , and harmit malik and nina papavasiliou ( peer reviewers ) .
a third reviewer remained anonymous .
the reviewers noted : ' well ( and cleverly ) done - no experimental concerns ' .
' i find the data to be compelling and very clearly presented .
this is a short , crisp and high impact study ' .
' the manuscript is very comprehensive and well written .
materials and methods are well described , and the figures very clear .
i was a real pleasure to review this nice paper ' .
we all agree that the manuscript is suitable for publication and we are delighted to accept it for elife .
we have made some minor comments for your consideration , which we feel would clarify some points and improve the structure and readability of the manuscript .
minor comments : although the choice of format is at the discretion of the authors , perhaps it is not in the best interest of the paper to have a combined results and discussion section .
indeed , although several small discussion points motivate the next experiment , the true discussion begins with the paragraph " we propose a straightforward model ...." and the model figure 4 .
so , please consider splitting the results and discussion .
in addition , the discussion might include three further points : ( a ) the few l1 retrotransposition events that occur in the presence of a3a that are devoid of obvious deamination - is the model that these reflect cases where the tprt events were beyond the ' saturation limit ' or restriction capacity of a3a ?
( b ) are there differences in a3a and a3b ( which has recently become quite prominent in cancer mutagenesis ) which have similar preferences ( and anti anti - l1 activity ) but perhaps slightly different cellular localization ?
finally , it may bear mentioning that whereas a3b is expressed in germline cells , a3a is not ( i think ) .
( c ) is this something that actually happens in real life ?
for instance , if a3a ( and other a3 's for that matter ) have anti - retrotransposon activities in unmanipulated systems , then it follows that their absence would correlate with increased transposition .
mouse has a single a3 and ma3 deficiency , though possibly anti - retroviral , has not led to appreciable defects in transposable element restriction ( though detecting such events is not always easy , a fact which this reviewer certainly appreciates ) .
perhaps the authors can comment on this .
10.7554 / elife.02008.018 author response although the choice of format is at the discretion of the authors , perhaps it is not in the best interest of the paper to have a combined results and discussion section .
indeed , although several small discussion points motivate the next experiment , the true discussion begins with the paragraph " we propose a straightforward model ...." and the model figure 4 .
so , please consider splitting the results and discussion .
we agree with the reviewers' suggestion .
as requested , we have now separated the results and discussion sections .
we agree that this change was in the best interest of the paper .
in addition , the discussion might include three further points : ( a ) the few l1 retrotransposition events that occur in the presence of a3a that are devoid of obvious deamination - is the model that these reflect cases where the tprt events were beyond the ' saturation limit ' or restriction capacity of a3a ?
we thank the reviewers for their scholarly comments .
as requested we have now included a new paragraph that discusses possibilities for why some l1 retrotransposition events are devoid of deamination .
specifically , we state the following in the discussion section of the manuscript : " the over - expression of a3a does not abolish l1 retrotransposition completely , but reduces it to ~ 30 % of control levels .
moreover , some l1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of a3a and ugi lacked evidence of deamination .
why and how these l1 retrotransposition events evade a3a - mediated deamination requires further study .
however , it is possible that ectopic a3a expression is too low to efficiently target l1 tprt intermediates in some cells or that l1 second - strand cdna synthesis occasionally is completed before a3a can gain access to tprt intermediates to deaminate single - strand l1 cdnas . "
( b ) are there differences in a3a and a3b ( which has recently become quite prominent in cancer mutagenesis ) which have similar preferences ( and anti anti - l1 activity ) but perhaps slightly different cellular localization ?
finally , it may bear mentioning that whereas a3b is expressed in germline cells , a3a is not ( i think ) .
again , we thank the reviewers for their comments .
as requested , we have highlighted differences between the expression patterns of a3a and a3b in the discussion section of the manuscript .
we also have highlighted that both a3a and a3b can localize to the nucleus .
specifically , we have added text to our discussion ( paragraph starting " mechanistic insights gained from studying deaminase - dependent a3a - mediated l1 inhibition could be applicable to retroelement inhibition by other a3 proteins ") .
we further agree with the statement that a3b has become quite prominent in cancer mutagenesis and we have added the text starting " apobec3 activity has been implicated in genome hyper - mutation in numerous cancers ( roberts et al. , 2013 ; burns et al. , 2013a ; burns et al. , 2013b )."
( c ) is this something that actually happens in real life ?
for instance , if a3a ( and other a3 's for that matter ) have anti - retrotransposon activities in unmanipulated systems , then it follows that their absence would correlate with increased transposition .
mouse has a single a3 and ma3 deficiency , though possibly anti - retroviral , has not led to appreciable defects in transposable element restriction ( though detecting such events is not always easy , a fact which this reviewer certainly appreciates ) .
perhaps the authors can comment on this .
again , we thank the reviewers for their comments .
because a3a expression is largely restricted to peripheral blood lymphocytes , we agree that it may not restrict germ line l1 retrotransposition events in " real life. " however , we posit that mechanistic insights gained from studying deaminase - dependent a3a - mediated l1 inhibition could be applicable to retroelement inhibition by other a3 proteins .
for example , and as detailed in our response above , we highlight that the related a3b cytidine deaminase protein ( which localizes to the nucleus , is expressed in human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) , and can inhibit the retrotransposition of engineered l1s in hescs ) may restrict germline l1 retrotransposition events .
moreover , we have provided a brief discussion about how differences in a3b expression levels may , in part , contribute to differences in l1 activity reported in human and non - human primate induced pluripotent stem cells .
finally , we raise the possibility that differences in the presence / absence of a3b in humans may contribute to differences in l1 retrotransposition activity .
to the best of our knowledge , no one has conducted an in depth study of l1 retrotransposition activity in a3 deficient mice ; thus , we did not discuss this point in our study .

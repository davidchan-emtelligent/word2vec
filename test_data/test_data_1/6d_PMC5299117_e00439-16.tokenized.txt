abstract tuberculosis is a global threat to which infants are especially vulnerable .
effective vaccines are required to protect infants from this devastating disease .
vpm1002 , a novel recombinant mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette - guerin ( bcg ) vaccine previously shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults , was evaluated for safety in its intended target population , namely , newborn infants in a region with high prevalence of tuberculosis .
a total of 48 newborns were vaccinated intradermally with vpm1002 ( n = 36 ) or bcg danish strain ( n = 12 ) in a phase ii open - labeled , randomized trial with a 6 - month follow - up period .
clinical and laboratory measures of safety were evaluated during this time .
in addition , vaccine - induced immune responses to mycobacteria were analyzed in whole - blood stimulation and proliferation assays .
the safety parameters and immunogenicity were comparable in the two groups .
both vaccines induced interleukin - 17 ( il - 17 ) responses ; however , vpm1002 vaccination led to an increase of cd8 + il - 17 + t cells at the week 16 and month 6 time points .
the incidence of abscess formation was lower for vpm1002 than for bcg .
we conclude that vpm1002 is a safe , well - tolerated , and immunogenic vaccine in newborn infants , confirming results from previous trials in adults .
these results strongly support further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of this vaccination in larger studies .

since then , the tb epidemic has escalated , despite advances in both diagnostic tests and treatment .
in most adults , m. tuberculosis infection is contained by host defense mechanisms , and infection remains latent .
however , among infants (< 12 months of age ) , up to 50 % of those infected develop tb disease in the absence of chemoprophylaxis ( 2 - 4 ) .
in 2015 , 11 % of the 10.4 million incident tb cases occurred in children ( 1 ) .
although pulmonary tb is the most common form of tb in both infants and adults , disseminated tb , mainly miliary tb and tb meningitis , contributes significantly to the tb burden in children ( 3 , 5 - 7 ) .
in addition to this , pulmonary tb in infants can be severe , with extensive lung involvement in up to 75 % of cases ( 8 ) .
the burden of childhood tb is considerable and until recently was underestimated .
a mathematical model to estimate the incidence of pediatric tb in 22 high - burden countries suggested that in 2010 , approximately 7.6 million children in these countries became infected with m. tuberculosis , and roughly 650,000 developed tb disease ( 9 ) .
bacillus calmette - guerin ( bcg ) , an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis , has been used as a tb vaccine since 1921 .
approximately 4 billion doses have been administered subsequently .
various strains of bcg are currently being used worldwide as part of the expanded program of immunization ( epi ) .
in south africa , bcg danish ssi ( 10 ) ( or bcg from the serum institute of india since 2016 [ 11 ]) is administered at birth as a single , intradermal injection .
its protective efficacy against tb meningitis and miliary tb disease in young children ranges between 64 and 86 % ( 12 ) .
this is the main rationale for routine infant vaccination in high - burden countries such as south africa , where coverage is high ( 98 % of infants vaccinated in 2011 ) .
however , severe tb disease is still observed frequently in children .
for example , in a large case series of 244 children with tb meningitis from the western cape , south africa , all but 8 had received bcg ( 13 ) and , of those that survived , > 75 % showed neurological impairment .
the protective efficacy of bcg against pulmonary tb is even less certain ( 1 , 14 - 17 ) , and yet pulmonary tb comprises > 75 % of the disease burden ( 12 ) .
development of a safe and efficacious vaccine has been recognized as a global priority to combat the tb epidemic by the who child tb subgroup ( 18 ) .
such development is challenging given the absence of known , validated biomarkers predictive of vaccine efficacy .
understanding the immunological mechanisms of m. tuberculosis infection and bcg vaccination is therefore vital .
both m. tuberculosis and bcg are phagocytosed by host macrophages ( 19 , 20 ) and retained in the cell 's phagosomes .
mycobacterial antigens primarily enter the major histocompatibility complex class ii ( mhc - ii ) pathway and preferentially induce cd4 + t - cell responses , critical in the control of disease ( 21 , 22 ) .
in addition , mhc - i - restricted cd8 + t cells are thought to play an important role in the immune response to m. tuberculosis infection ( 20 , 23 ) .
cd8 + t - cell responses are , however , only weakly induced by bcg ( 17 , 19 , 20 , 24 - 27 ) .
the recombinant bcg vaccine vpm1002 was developed to enhance mhc - i - related immune responses and , through this , to be more effective and safer than conventional bcg ( 28 ) .
vpm1002 expresses listeriolysin ( hly ) from listeria monocytogenes ( 28 , 29 ) , which perturbs the phagosome , thereby facilitating antigen translocation into the cytoplasm and allowing efficient presentation to cd8 + t cells ( 30 ) .
in addition , the induction of apoptosis and autophagy leads to cross - priming , resulting in further stimulation of cd4 + and cd8 + t - cell responses ( 31 - 33 ) .
importantly , vpm1002 has been shown recently to expand cd4 + central memory t cells ( 34 ) , as well as both t helper 1 ( th1 ) and th17 cells , at a more profound level than bcg ( 35 ) .
similarly , cd8 + t cells are potently induced by vpm1002 ( 30 ) .
moreover , vpm1002 has been shown to be cleared more rapidly from tissue than bcg , resulting in reduced persistence in the host ( 28 , 32 - 34 ) .
hiv - infected and immune - deficient infants are at risk of bcg - related complications ( 36 - 38 ) ( with a risk of disseminated bcg disease [" bcgosis "] in hiv - infected infants of 992 per 100,000 children ) , although in high - burden tb settings bcg vaccination is routinely performed at birth before the infant 's hiv status can be determined .
in this setting , a vaccine safer than bcg is therefore desirable .
during development of vpm1002 , inactivation of the urease c gene was performed to ensure optimal hly activity in an acidic phagosomal environment ( 28 ) .
initially , a hygromycin resistance gene was incorporated into vpm1002 to facilitate clonal selection during vaccine development ( 32 ) .
in 2011 , however , this gene was removed successfully ( 39 ) .
vpm1002 is sensitive to isoniazid , rifampin , and ethambutol , all effective antimycobacterial agents ( 40 ) , in the presence or absence of the hygromycin resistance gene .
vpm1002 - specific human data are available from two clinical phase i trials ( clinicaltrials.gov , nct00749034 and nct01113281 ) .
in a phase ia trial conducted in germany , healthy adult caucasian male volunteers with or without preexposure to bcg received vpm1002 ( n = 30 ) or bcg ( n = 20 ) and were followed up for 6 months .
a single vaccination with up to 5 x 105 cfu was safe and well tolerated .
vpm1002 was immunogenic and induced multifunctional cd4 + and cd8 + t - cell subsets , considered relevant for protection against tb ( 41 ) .
induction of multifunctional cd8 + t cells by vpm1002 appeared to be superior to bcg at comparable doses , but formal statistical testing was not performed .
the immunogenicity of vpm1002 , detected by interferon gamma ( ifn - gamma ) release by stimulated t cells , was dose dependent ( 41 ) .
in a second clinical trial , conducted in south africa , 24 healthy male and female adults , predominantly of indigenous african descent and all with prior exposure to bcg , received vpm1002 at the same dose as in the phase ia trial and were followed up for 6 months .
a single vaccination with vpm1002 was safe , well tolerated , and immunogenic ( clinicaltrials.gov , nct01113281 ) and thus confirmed results obtained in phase ia. the primary objective of the present study ( clinicaltrials.gov , nct01479972 ) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vpm1002 compared to bcg in newborn infants in a setting of tb endemicity .
the secondary objective was to compare immunogenicity of the two vaccines .
bcg forms an integral component of the national epi in this setting and was therefore selected over a placebo as a suitable and ethical comparator .

( i ) vaccination with vpm1002 induces multifunctional cd4 + and cd8 + t cells .
whole - blood restimulation of samples obtained over the 6 - month follow - up demonstrated cd4 + t cells producing multifunctional cytokine responses for both vaccines ( fig. 2a ) .
there were no significant differences between vaccination groups after restimulation with purified protein derivative ( ppd ) at any time point compared to the baseline ( day 14 , p = 0.1301 ; week 6 , p = 0.1122 ; week 18 , p = 0.4950 ; month 6 , p = 1.000 ) .
increases in the proportions of cd8 + t cells after restimulation with ppd were most marked for single - cytokine - producing cells ( predominantly interleukin - 2 [ il - 2 ] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [ tnf - alpha ]) at week 18 and month 6 and were comparable in the two vaccination groups at all time points ( day 14 , p = 0.3546 ; week 6 , p = 0.3481 ; week 18 , p = 0.0916 ; month 6 , p = 0.9431 ) ( fig. 2b ) .

the median proportion of each cytokine - expressing cell subset is represented by the horizontal line , the interquartile range ( iqr ) by the box , and the range by the whiskers .
differences in subset proportions between the vaccination groups were analyzed for each time point using a wilcoxon rank sum test and were not significant ( p > 0.050 ) .
( ii ) vaccine - induced ifn - gamma production peaks at week 6 .
ifn - gamma production was measured at each follow - up visit .
in the 7 - h assay , both bcg and vpm1002 groups had ifn - gamma responses at all time points postvaccination that were significantly higher than baseline ( fig. 3a ) .
these changes were most pronounced at week 6 ( bcg , p = 0.0005 ; vpm1002 , p < 0.0001 ) and were similar in each group ( p = 0.0737 ) .
fig 3 vaccine - induced ifn - gamma responses as determined by elisa in whole - blood samples after stimulation with ppd for 7 h ( a ) and 7 days ( b ) .
medians ( lines ) and ranges ( error bars ) are shown .
both bcg ( n = 12 ) and vpm1002 ( n = 36 ) vaccination groups showed positive ifn - gamma responses to vaccination , peaking at week 6 .
within each group , changes from baseline were analyzed using a wilcoxon signed - rank test and were significant in both assays at all time points excepting bcg at day 14 .
the proliferative ifn - gamma response in the 7 day assay was significantly greater in response to bcg than vpm1002 ( p = 0.0141 ) , as analyzed by a wilcoxon rank sum test .
the proliferative ifn - gamma responses to 7 - day ppd restimulation ( fig. 3b ) reached levels five to six times higher than those from the 7 - h assay .
the change from baseline was significantly greater in the bcg group than in the vpm1002 group at week 6 ( p = 0.0141 ) .
( iii ) cd8 + t cells producing il - 17 are more prominent in the vpm1002 - vaccinated group .
compared to the baseline , significantly increased proportions of cd8 + il - 17 + cells were seen in the vpm1002 group at day 14 ( p = 0.0156 ) and month 6 ( p = 0.0002 ) after restimulation with bcg in the 7 - day proliferation assay but not in the bcg group ( fig. 4a ) .
individual subject changes in proportions of the cd8 + il - 17 + cells are given per vaccination group ( fig. 4b ) .
the median changes from baseline to month 6 were similar in both groups ( p = 0.0836 ) .

( a ) proportions of cd8 + t cells expressing il - 17 after restimulation with bcg for 7 days .
median proportions for bcg ( n = 12 ) and vpm1002 ( n = 36 ) vaccination groups at each time point are expressed by the horizontal line , the interquartile range ( iqr ) by the box , and the range by the whiskers .
corresponding individual responses are illustrated by dots adjacent to each box - and - whisker .
changes from the baseline to each time point postvaccination were assessed using a wilcoxon signed - rank test .
these were significant in only the vpm1002 group at day 14 ( p = 0.0156 ) and month 6 ( p = 0.0002 ) .
( b ) individual longitudinal expression of il - 17 among cd8 + t cells from baseline to month 6 is shown for individual infants in the bcg and vpm1002 vaccination groups .
positive responses were seen in 2 ( 16.7 %) subjects from the bcg and 13 ( 36.1 %) from the vpm1002 vaccination groups .
median responses were similar in the two vaccination groups ( p = 0.0836 , wilcoxon rank sum test ) .
rna expression between vpm1002 and bcg .
gene expression analysis revealed marked changes over time .
gene set enrichment analysis indicated that the most significant changes were in b - cell - related genes ( fig. 5 ) , many of which were expressed at higher levels postvaccination .
these changes were observed from 14 days postvaccination onward .
furthermore , genes related to type i ifn and innate antiviral responses showed higher expression at later time points , whereas several enriched gene modules showed decreased expression of genes over time ( fig. 5 ) .
these changes most likely reflect the maturation of the immune system and increasing proportions or activity of b cells over time .
fig 5 gene set enrichment of differentially expressed genes .
enrichment was calculated for each time point relative to baseline .
red indicates the proportion of genes in a particular module which show significantly increased expression .
likewise , blue indicates significantly lower expression of genes .
modules which are gray are enriched but individual genes in that module are not significantly changed .
the columns on the right indicated by " dif " show differences between the bcg and vpm1002 group at each time point .
no significant differences between the vpm1002 and bcg groups were observed longitudinally ( fig. 5 ) .
the administration of vpm1002 , but not of bcg , resulted in an increase in cd8 + il - 17 + cells ( fig. 4 ) .
however , no overall differences in basal il - 17a gene expression in whole blood were noted ( fig. 6 ) .
in fact , both groups showed a significant overall decrease in il - 17a gene expression level in whole blood over time , with a log2 - fold change of - 0.94 and corrected p value of 1.38e - 06 at month 6 postvaccination .

discussion this phase ii trial confirms the safety and immunogenicity of vpm1002 in hiv - unexposed south african newborn infants .
a single vpm1002 vaccination induced polyfunctional cd4 + and cd8 + t - cell profiles comparable to bcg .
interestingly , the proportions of cd8 + il - 17 + t cells were increased at 6 months postvaccination in the vpm1002 group exclusively .
this subgroup of cd8 + t cells is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli , especially in an il - 6 - rich environment ( 42 ) .
in a recent publication , this cell type was detected in patients with active tb disease , but no correlation with bacterial loads in the sputum could be found ( 43 ) , and it is currently not known to what extent this cell type correlates with pathology or protection during m. tuberculosis infection .
importantly , however , il - 17 - producing cd8 + t cells have been shown to confer vaccine - mediated protection under various conditions ( 44 - 47 ) .
for the first time , we show here that such a cell type is also induced by vaccination with a bcg strain , namely , vpm1002 .
further studies are needed to decipher the exact role of these cells in vpm1002 - mediated responses .
the incidences of adverse events were similar in both groups .
all subjects experienced at least one adverse event regarded as an adverse vaccine reaction ( i.e. , a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with the vaccine ) .
these were predominantly local injection site reactions , and incidence rates comparable to those reported after routine bcg vaccination were expected ( 10 ). of note , abscess formation , an occasional reaction to bcg vaccination , was observed less frequently in vpm1002 - vaccinated infants than in bcg controls .
this may suggest an enhanced safety profile of vpm1002 .
throughout the study , 25 adverse events of severe intensity were reported in 21 subjects .
only one of these events ( abscess formation in a subject vaccinated with bcg ) was considered to be related to vaccination .
elevated bilirubin levels ( grade 3 or 4 ) were reported on day 14 in 2 and 14 subjects from the bcg and vpm1002 groups , respectively .
the division of aids ( daids ) toxicity tables used during the study did not consider bilirubin levels in breast - fed infants , which can remain elevated until 4 weeks of age .
revised toxicity tables were introduced in 2014 , and had these been applied , no infant in the study would have had grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia ( 48 ) .
other abnormal laboratory results were considered unrelated to vaccination .
clinically significant findings related to urinary tract infections ( two subjects ) resolved upon appropriate treatment .
telephonic follow - up over 30 months suggested a high level of tb exposure .
since the study duration was only 6 months , we referred children to community healthcare facilities to manage tb exposures during telephone follow - up. the management was suboptimal , as previously noted in the same setting ( 49 ) , with only four of nine tb contact - exposed children receiving either treatment or isoniazid prevention therapy ( ipt ) .
the profiles of cytokine - producing cells were similar in the bcg and vpm1002 groups .
the pattern of cytokine production ( for ifn - gamma , il - 2 , and tnf - alpha ) by cd4 + and cd8 + t cells was consistent with findings from phase i studies ( 41 ) .
furthermore , levels of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) production by restimulated cd4 + and cd8 + t cells from whole blood were similar in the two groups and highest by week 18 ( data not shown ) .
in whole - blood assays ( wbas ) , a significant increase in the proportion of cd4 + t cells expressing il - 17 was seen in both groups at week 18 and month 6 relative to the baseline , after stimulation with ppd and bcg antigens .
the median increase in the proportion of this subgroup of cells was maximal at week 18 in both groups after stimulation with bcg ( median 0.022 [ p = 0.0059 ] and 0.034 [ p < 0.0001 ] increases , respectively , in bcg and vpm1002 vaccination groups ) ( data not shown ). of particular interest is the increased frequency of il - 17 production by cd8 + t cells noted exclusively in the vpm1002 group postvaccination .
transient il - 17 may contribute to protective immunity against m. tuberculosis ( 17 , 22 , 50 , 51 ) .
several studies have evaluated the importance of il - 17 ( 50 - 53 ) , recently shown to enhance the neutrophil response to m. tuberculosis ( 52 ) .
increasing evidence ( 54 , 55 ) strengthens earlier findings ( 23 , 27 , 33 ) that cd8 + t cells are important for tb protection .
vpm1002 was designed to stimulate cd8 + t cells through increased antigen loading of mhc - i through enhanced phagosome permeability mediated by hly .
although data from this trial support this concept , the protective efficacy of this phenomenon against tb remains to be clarified .
earlier studies argue against a role of multifunctional t cells in protection against tb ( 56 , 57 ) .
a recent review of polyfunctional t cells described the role of such cells during m. tuberculosis infection and vaccine - induced memory responses ( 19 ) .
although important in vaccine - mediated immunity , the production and levels of ifn - gamma ( and other cytokines ) are not considered direct correlates of protection .
our data on t - cell cytokines suggest that vpm1002 is highly immunogenic and induces the favorable polyfunctional t - cell response ( 19 ) .
rna analysis revealed differential regulation of a number of genes following vaccination with vpm1002 and bcg .
genes associated with b - cell development and proliferation were the most significantly regulated and occurred 14 days postvaccination .
in experimental murine tb , preferential induction of antibody responses by vpm1002 over bcg has been observed ( 34 ) .
further investigation into these b - cell genes is important as such a signature may indicate protection from active tb disease in the future ( 58 ) .
our finding supports data from cliff et al .
( 59 ) , who demonstrated that most changes in b - cell gene expression in active tb cases occur between week 4 and the end of successful therapy .
the pipeline of new tb vaccines comprises novel recombinant vectors , adjuvant / protein formulations and live recombinant mycobacteria ( 60 - 63 ) .
vpm1002 is an attractive candidate for the latter approach .
increased il - 17 induction by cd8 + t cells after vaccination with vpm1002 may contribute to protection against active tb disease. conclusion .
vpm1002 was safe , immunogenic , and well tolerated in newborn infants .
the conduct of larger studies , including the enrollment of hiv - exposed infants and possible cohorts across different continents , is recommended to further investigate the efficacy of vpm1002 .
materials and methods study population .
the present study was a single - center , open - label , randomized , controlled , single - administration phase ii study conducted in cape town , south africa , a region where tb is highly endemic .
participants were healthy newborn infants born to hiv - negative mothers and were followed - up for 6 months after vaccination .
( i ) mothers .
after written consent was obtained , pregnant women aged 18 and older were screened at antenatal clinics and postdelivery wards up to 3 weeks prior to their infant 's enrollment into the study .
mothers who had a history of immunodeficiency , had symptoms or signs of active or latent tb , or reported household tb contacts were excluded from participation in the trial .
a maternal mantoux tuberculin skin test ( two units of statens serum institut tuberculin rt23 in 0.1 ml of solution for intradermal injection ) was performed at screening to exclude latent tb infection ; induration of < 10 mm from 48 to 72 h after administration was considered negative .
women testing positive for hiv - 1 infection ( fourth - generation enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay [ elisa ] for hiv antibodies and p24 antigen 2 weeks prior to infant immunization ) , syphilis , or hepatitis b surface antigen , as well as those with current acute infectious diseases , were ineligible for participation .
a maternal history or evidence of diabetes mellitus , as well as reported or suspected substance abuse , were also exclusion criteria .
( ii ) infants .
full - term , newborn infants were screened and vaccinated up to 8 days of age .
infants meeting the inclusion criteria were considered for participation : a birth weight of 3,000 to 4,000 g , an apgar score of >= 9 at 5 min , the absence of eczema or infection at the intended injection site , bcg naive , and the administration of oral polio vaccine according to the epi schedule .
adherence to the epi schedule ( apart from bcg vaccination at birth ) was required for the entire study period .
participation in another clinical trial before and for 6 months after study vaccination was not permitted .
exclusion criteria included significant congenital abnormalities , history or evidence of systemic disease or acute , chronic or intercurrent illness ( including sepsis or malignancy , fever , or hypothermia ) .
concomitant or prior medication significantly affecting immune function ( e.g. , systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs ) , antibiotics given prior to study vaccination , or treatment with blood products precluded participation .
in addition , infants with clinically significant blood or urine laboratory abnormalities at screening were ineligible .
neonatal jaundice not considered clinically significant by the investigator was permitted .
study procedures .
( i ) randomization and safety assessments .
after confirmation of eligibility , infants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 2.5 x 105 ( range , 1 x 105 to 4 x 105 cfu ) of either vpm1002 ( deltaurec hly + hyg + strain [ manufactured at vibalogics gmbh , germany , according to eu - gmp and who trs 979 , annex 3 { 64 }]) ( n = 36 ) or bcg ( danish strain bcg [ statens serum institut , denmark ] , batch 110049a ) ( n = 12 ) .
a block randomization strategy ensured balance in the vaccine treatment group sizes throughout the study recruitment period , with the first subject receiving bcg .
subjects were observed for at least 4 h after vaccination .
safety assessments ( vital signs and monitoring for local reactions and adverse events ) were performed predose ( vital signs only ) and at 0.5 , 1 , and 3 h postdose ( and at 6 h for the first four subjects given vpm1002 ) .
mothers were educated regarding the natural course of bcg ulceration and scarring .
the injection site was covered with a suitable dressing for the postvaccination observational period at the clinic , and the mothers were advised to cover the infant 's upper arm .
direct contact with the vaccination site was to be avoided during the first days postvaccination , and especially in the presence of ulceration , to prevent infection and / or spread to other persons , objects and the environment .
topical applications were not permitted until complete healing of the vaccination site .
the study duration ( including the screening period for mothers ) was approximately 7 months .
regular safety and immunogenicity assessments were conducted during this time .
liver and spleen ultrasound examinations were performed during infant screening and at week 12 postvaccination .
adverse events were coded using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities ( meddra ) , version 15.0 ( http :// www.meddra.org ) .
laboratory abnormalities were graded in accordance with daids criteria ( daids table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric adverse events , version 1.0 [ 65 ]) .
all grade 3 and 4 abnormalities were considered adverse events regardless of their relationship to the study vaccine .
( ii ) sample collection .
blood samples for immunogenicity and safety ( hematology and clinical chemistry ) , as well as samples for urinalysis , were collected during screening and at regular follow - up intervals until month 6 postvaccination .
urine microscopy and culture were performed for samples with abnormal dipstick results .
where residual blood samples were available , a quantiferon - tb gold test was performed to detect latent tb at week 12 and month 6 postvaccination .
immunological analyses .
( i ) whole - blood assays .
assessment of the immunogenicity of vpm1002 and bcg was performed using a well - established assay ( 66 ) .
in brief , whole blood from vaccinated infants was stimulated with bcg ( danish strain ) or ppd ( statens serum institut ) for 12 h or 7 days .
for the 7 - day stimulation , blood was diluted 10 - fold in phosphate - bufered saline ( pbs ) prior to stimulation .
brefeldin a ( sigma - aldrich ) , a protein transport inhibitor , was added for the last 4 h of either the 12 - h or the 7 - day stimulation assay .
supernatant from both stimulation assays was collected prior to the addition of brefeldin a and stored until performance of cytokine analyses .
after 12 h or 7 days of stimulation , the cells were treated using fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) lysing solution to remove red blood cells and then stored for further analyses .
( ii ) flow cytometry .
multicolor flow cytometry was performed to analyze the phenotypes and functions of cells .
samples from wbas were permeabilized , fixed , and subsequently stained with a panel of antibodies from becton dickinson ( bd ) containing anti - cd3 ( pacific blue ) , anti - cd4 ( v500 ) , anti - cd8 ( allophycocyanin [ apc ] - cy7 ) , anti - ifn - gamma ( phycoerythrin [ pe ] - cy7 ) , anti - il - 2 ( peridinin chlorophyll protein [ percp ] - cy5.5 ) , anti - tnf ( apc ) , anti - il - 17 ( alexa fluor 488 ) , and anti - gm - csf ( pe ) or anti - ki - 67 ( pe ) .
stained samples were read on a bd facscanto ii. flowjo , version 10 ( treestar ) , was used for compensation and analysis of data .
( iii ) ifn - gamma elisa .
supernatants from wbas were thawed , diluted , and assayed for ifn - gamma production using an elisapro kit ( mabtech , sweden ) .
the assay kit has an effective range of 3.16 to 3,160 pg / ml and was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
since higher concentrations of ifn - gamma were expected , supernatants were diluted prior to performing the assay .
taking the respective dilution factor into account , concentrations between 31.6 and 10,000 pg / ml and between 158 and 50,000 pg / ml , respectively , could be measured in 12 - h and 7 - day stimulation assays .
rna gene expression .
after preparation of the described safety and immunogenicity assays , residual blood was divided into aliquots and stored in rnalater solution ( sigma - aldrich ) .
one aliquot was used to extract rna for gene expression analysis on agilent whole - genome 8x60k human expression arrays and scanned at 5 mum using an agilent scanner .
analysis of the scanned images was performed with feature extraction software ( version 10.5.1 ; agilent technologies ) .
the data were analyzed using the r package limma ( 67 ) .
expression data were quantile normalized and log transformed .
differential expression between the two groups of infants at various time points postvaccination was calculated based on log2 - fold changes in an average expression .
genes with corrected p values of < 0.01 were considered significant after benjamini - hochberg correction for multiple testing .
functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes was analyzed based on human blood transcriptional modules using the tmod package ( 68 ) .
poststudy follow - up. after completion of study - related procedures , telephonic follow - up continued for 30 months .
mothers were interviewed to obtain information regarding tb symptoms and exposure , as well as the general health of the infant .
the duration of follow - up until 3 years of age was intended to cover the period for which bcg is known to effectively protect children from severe forms of mycobacterial disease ( 12 ) .
statistical analysis .
no formal sample size calculation was performed .
both per - protocol and intent - to - treat analyses were conducted .
demographic and baseline data were presented descriptively .
the fisher exact test and analysis of variance ( anova ) were used to test for statistically significant differences between the vaccination groups for categorical and continuous data , respectively .
for the secondary immunological endpoints , descriptive statistics of the absolute values and change from baseline were presented for each time point .
change from baseline within each treatment group was analyzed for each time point using a wilcoxon signed - rank test .
differences in the mean change from baseline between the treatment groups were analyzed using a wilcoxon rank sum test .
point estimates of the between - group differences were calculated using the hodges - lehman estimate .
all statistical analyses were interpreted as statistically significant for p values of < 0.050 .
statistical analysis was performed using sas ( version 9.2 ; sas institute , inc. , cary , nc ) .
ethical and regulatory approval of the trial .
the medicines control council of south africa and the research ethics committee of stellenbosch university approved the protocol .
the trial was conducted according to the declaration of helsinki ( 69 ) and the ich guideline for good clinical practice ( july 2002 ) .

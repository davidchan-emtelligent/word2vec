background variations in air pollution exposure within a community may be associated with asthma prevalence .
however , studies conducted to date have produced inconsistent results , possibly due to errors in measurement of the exposures .
methods a standardized asthma survey was administered to children in grades one and eight in hamilton , canada , in 1994 - 95 ( n ~ 1467 ) .
exposure to air pollution was estimated in four ways : ( 1 ) distance from roadways ; ( 2 ) interpolated surfaces for ozone , sulfur dioxide , particulate matter and nitrous oxides from seven to nine governmental monitoring stations ; ( 3 ) a kriged nitrogen dioxide ( no2 ) surface based on a network of 100 passive no2 monitors ; and ( 4 ) a land use regression ( lur ) model derived from the same monitoring network .
logistic regressions were used to test associations between asthma and air pollution , controlling for variables including neighbourhood income , dwelling value , state of housing , a deprivation index and smoking .
results there were no significant associations between any of the exposure estimates and asthma in the whole population , but large effects were detected the subgroup of children without hayfever ( predominately in girls ) .
the most robust effects were observed for the association of asthma without hayfever and no2lur or = 1.86 ( 95 % ci , 1.59 - 2.16 ) in all girls and or = 2.98 ( 95 % ci , 0.98 - 9.06 ) for older girls , over an interquartile range increase and controlling for confounders .
conclusion our findings indicate that traffic - related pollutants , such as no2 , are associated with asthma without overt evidence of other atopic disorders among female children living in a medium - sized canadian city .
the effects were sensitive to the method of exposure estimation .
more refined exposure models produced the most robust associations .
background although adverse respiratory health outcomes from exposure to ambient air pollution are biologically plausible , research linking exposure to asthma has been inconclusive [ 1,2 ] .
recent research has emphasized the growing contribution and heightened toxic potential of traffic - related air pollution ( tap ) near major vehicular corridors [ 3 ] , as well as significant associations between exposure to tap and onset of asthma [ 4 ] .
other studies have found positive , significant associations between exposure to tap and adverse respiratory outcomes [ 5 - 13 ] , while others have reported null associations [ 14 - 16 ] .
the inconsistencies in linking tap and asthma may be due to exposure measurement error in some studies , which arise partly from the way exposures to traffic pollution are estimated and derived .
these exposure estimates include : self - reported traffic density at residence [ 11,12 ] ; number of cars passing by per 24 hours on the nearest street to a home or school [ 7,17,18 ] ; distance between the nearest street and home [ 8,9,16,17,19,20 ] ; identification of the street with highest traffic density relative to a child 's school or home [ 10,21 ] ; perception of residential nuisances related to traffic pollution [ 22 ] ; indices which combine traffic and distance [ 14,23,24 ] ; cumulative exposure indices [ 25,26 ] ; and estimation of pollution exposure at the home using geographic information systems ( gis ) and land use regression models [ 27 ] .
susceptibility factors have also been suggested to contribute to these observed inconsistencies , including early life exposure [ 28 ] , duration of residence , parental asthma history , and gender [ 20,29 ] .
additionally , douwes et al [ 30 ] suggest there to be a growing importance of investigating specific subtypes of asthma , namely non - atopic or non - allergic asthma .
nystad et al [ 31 ] show increasing rates of children with non - atopy related asthma , defined as asthma without atopic diseases ( specifically hayfever or eczema ) , compared to atopy - related asthma .
ronmark et al .
[ 32 ] report different patterns of risk factors for atopic and non - atopic asthma , defined as asthma with or without at least one positive skin test for type - 1 allergy .
the separation of atopic and non - atopic asthma is often not considered in the air pollution and asthma literature , and as non - atopic asthma is thought to contribute much of the increased incidence of asthma , it may be accentuating observed inconsistencies in reported results .
further to these complexities , differences exist between the sexes , with girls being more susceptible to asthma than boys [ 20,33 ] ; despite boys having higher prevalence rates .
age also seems to influence the progression toward onset [ 34 ] .
in this article , we examine the relationship between within - city or ' intraurban ' contrasts in air pollution exposure and childhood asthma in hamilton , canada .
further , we test these associations within asthmatic subgroups stratified by the presence or absence of other atopic diseases , gender and age to determine whether these susceptibility factors influence the relationship between air pollution and asthma .
methods study area hamilton is the ninth largest city in canada , with a population of over 660,000 in 2001 [ 35 ] .
the city experiences high levels of pollution exposure for a number of reasons , including traffic and local steel manufacturing plants [ 36 ] .
the city has well - documented spatial variability of air pollution [ 37 - 40 ] .
pollution is higher in the major industrial zone located in the northeast and generally lower in the southern and western parts of the city .
this is mainly due to prevailing winds , the location of industry upwind of major population areas , temperature inversions that trap pollutants near ground level and topographical elevation created by the presence of the approximately 100 m high niagara escarpment [ 41 ] ( see figure 1 ) .
figure 1 locator map of hamilton .
hamilton has been extensively studied in terms of air pollution and mortality , employing ecologic analysis [ 42 ] , time - series [ 43,44 ] ; and cohort study designs [ 39,40 ] .
these techniques have shown that proximity to traffic and higher exposures to ambient air pollution are significantly associated with cardiovascular and stroke mortality rates , but not with respiratory death [ 41 ] .
earlier studies investigated the relationship between air pollution and respiratory health in children [ 45 ] and in the general population [ 46 ] , but both studies were inconclusive .
studies of disease prevalence have reported that hamilton has some of the highest asthma rates for both young adults [ 47 ] and children [ 48 ] in canada ; however , the association of asthma symptoms with detailed intraurban air pollution exposures has not yet been explicitly tested .
study population the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood ( isaac ) phase i questionnaire was administered in 1994 - 1995 to 6388 children who lived in or around hamilton [ 48 ] .
a full description of the isaac study protocol has been discussed elsewhere [ 49 ] .
briefly , it is a validated tool that uses a standardized questionnaire to assess asthma and respiratory symptoms in children aged 6 - 7 and 13 - 14 ( pre - and post - pubescent ) , and allows for uniformity in comparisons across populations [ 34 ] .
sampling was based on complete classes from randomly selected schools within the region .
participation rates were 75.1 % and 68.6 % for the younger and older children , respectively [ 48 ]. from this larger sample , 1467 children were selected , based on the geographic extent of the pollution monitoring data available for analysis .
two age groups were tested ; those corresponding to grades 1 ( ages 6 - 7 ) and 8 ( ages 13 - 14 ) in canadian schools .
parents filled out the questionnaires for the younger children at home , thereby providing parental consent .
the older children completed questionnaires by themselves at school after obtaining written consent from their parents .
the questionnaires used were focused mainly on assessing respiratory health status and did not include extensive information on other risk factors .
location of residence was recorded at the level of the 6 - digit postal codes , which supply block centroids that are positioned near the front of residential properties .
children that had answered " yes " to the question " have you ever had asthma " were classified as asthmatic and a variable was created as ' asthma ever ' .
the same classification (" have you ever had ....") was applied for wheeze and hayfever , creating ' wheeze ever ' and ' hayfever ever ' .
asthma not associated with hayfever was defined as answering " yes " to asthma ever , but " no " to hayfever ever .
other indicators of probable atopic disease present in the isaac questionnaire included the questions " have you ever had eczema " and " have you ever had runny or blocked nose not associated with having a cold or the flu. " similarly , ' asthma without eczema ' and ' asthma without runny nose ' variables were created for further sensitivity analyses .
variables indicating the presence of ' wheeze ever ' and ' current wheeze ' ( wheeze in the last 12 months ) with and without atopy related symptoms were also created .
specific testing for atopy ( skin allergen prick tests or serum immunoglobulin e ( ige ) levels ) was not performed in the phase i isaac study .
hence , to examine the possibility of different effects in atopic and non - atopic asthma , these symptom - related variables were created .
air pollution exposure models we estimated exposure to air pollution using four techniques .
first , we created buffers of 50 m and 100 m from major roadways to proxy for traffic pollution exposure based on the dmti spatial data coverage ( dmti spatial , markham , on ) .
children living within the specified buffer distance from a major road were assigned the number 1 ; those who did not were assigned the number 0 .
second , we created pollution surfaces for particulates ( pm10 ) , sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen oxides ( nox ) and ozone ( o3 ) , using deterministic interpolators applied to three - year averages corresponding to the time of enrolment in the survey .
these models were derived from between seven and nine ontario ministry of the environment ( moe ) ambient fixed - site pollution monitors located in hamilton , depending on data availability for the period coinciding with the isaac study .
specifically , we derived theissen polygons , bi - cubic spline and inverse distance weighted ( idw ) interpolation techniques [ 50 ] for each of the four pollutants .
the third pollution surface estimation method was based on a detailed network of 107 monitoring locations deployed throughout hamilton for a two - week period in 2002 .
passive no2 ogawa monitors ( ogawa & co. , usa ) were set up in duplicate at each location .
every monitor had two filters , yielding four readings per site .
values at each of the 107 locations were based on an average of these four readings .
after field retrieval and data cleaning , 100 readings remained available for analysis .
pollutant concentrations from these locations were interpolated to estimate the most likely value of no2 occurring between the monitored locations .
we used kriging , an optimal stochastic interpolation method that supplies the best linear unbiased estimate of the variable of interest for this type of exposure calculation [ 50 ] .
while a temporal difference exists between data collection of the isaac study and no2 observations , the spatial trends of pollution in hamilton between 1995 and 2002 have been relatively consistent , based on annual air quality reports [ 39 ] .
the stability of the spatial distribution of pollution with hamilton is also discussed below in terms of the land use regression model .
our fourth assessment method was a no2 surface created using a land use regression ( lur ) model , explained elsewhere in detail [ 51,52 ] .
based on the same 100 readings from the passive monitors mentioned above , the lur model [ 53 ] was implemented to assess the land use characteristics , transportation , population and physical geography variables most strongly associated with ambient no2 concentrations .
our final seven - variable model explained 76 % of the variation in the measured no2 .
variables included : traffic density , open land use within 500 m , industrial land use within 200 m , presence of a highway within 50 m , presence within 1000 m from downtown industrial core , presence downwind from a highway , and distance to the lake .
the variables representing traffic density , industrial land use , meteorology , and other activities thought to predict traffic pollution levels had coefficients with the expected sign .
predicted values were used to generate a detailed exposure surface that captured the small - area variability of pollution within the city .
cross validations indicated that the lur model performed well , demonstrating good predictions for sites not used in model calibration and stable coefficients when assessed with the chow test [ 54 ] .
our seasonal analysis suggested the model was capable of predicting spatial variation within the city for different seasons , probably due to spatial patterns of pollution that remain stable over time [ 51 ] .
confounding variables confounding in air pollution and health research occurs when the pollution exposure and the health outcome of interest are correlated and can lead to spurious observed associations .
variations in health outcomes are due to both individual and area , or place - specific , characteristics [ 55 ] .
diez - roux [ 56 ] categorized these effects within ecological studies as compositional and contextual confounders .
compositional confounders include those affecting health as a function of the underlying population characteristics ( e.g. proportion of smokers ) .
contextual or area effect variables affect health through the social and economic context of populations .
for example , social deprivation in the neighbourhood of residence could exert effects on individual health through a variety of mechanisms [ 57 ] .
in our analysis , we had limited individual level data on confounders , so we used neighbourhood proxies where available and appropriate .
specifically , we used variables shown to affect the air pollution and health association in previous studies .
these included income [ 39 ] and dwelling value [ 37 ] , both of which were obtained from the 1996 census of canada with information available at the census tract level .
the percentage of smokers [ 39 ] has also been shown to affect air pollution and health associations .
our passive smoking data was extracted from a secondary source : a similar asthma study conducted in 1995 among 3369 young adults ( aged 20 - 44 years ) at the same time as the isaac study , where adults were asked about smoking habits [ 47 ] .
sex - specific percentages of ' ever smokers' were calculated and continuous contours were created using the distance mapping and analysis program ( dmap ) point interpolation program [ 58 ] .
as maternal smoking has been shown to have stronger effects on childhood asthma than paternal smoking [ 59 ] , children were assigned the smoking value of the female smokers at the contour closest to their residential location .
as our last compositional variables , we used two proxy variables that account for the state of housing and potential exposure to mold : ( 1 ) percent of houses built pre - 1946 ( hereafter referred to as ' percent old houses ') ; and ( 2 ) rate of repair of housing , intended to relate to older home conditions and therefore the increased occurrence of mold [ 60 ] and damp conditions [ 61 ] .
both of these proxy variables have shown to affect respiratory health .
these data were also available from the 1996 census of canada .
our contextual variable was developed from a deprivation index ( di ) - a previously created variable shown to be associated with cardiovascular mortality in hamilton [ 41 ] .
a similar index was associated with mortality in quebec , canada [ 62 ] .
social deprivation is a multidimensional construct and relevant variables are often collinear .
because the variables are intercorrelated , and each variable cannot be represented separately , principal components analysis ( pca ) is often used to extract the significant dimensions [ 63 ] .
pca was run on average income , unemployment rate and low education variables .
the di was created from extracting the first principal component , representing about 80 % of the variation in all three variables .
the higher the score of the di , the less favourable was the combination of income , education and employment .
to be included as a true confounding variable rather than an effect modifier , the contextual and compositional variables created had to fulfill three requirements .
first , they had to be associated with asthma .
second , variables also had to be associated with pollution exposure .
third , their inclusion in the multiple variable analyses had to change the regression coefficient of the model of asthma related to pollution exposure by more than 10 % ( see [ 64 ] for a similar approach ) .
statistical analyses to understand the inter - relationships among predictor variables , a correlation matrix was created for the individual pollutants and potential confounders .
we conducted bivariate logistic regressions between the dependent variables ( health outcomes ) and all of the independent variables previously discussed .
significant associations between the pollutants and health outcomes were retained and tested further in trivariate logistic regressions with the contextual and compositional variables .
once the confounding variables were identified , they were entered with the pollution exposures in a series of multiple regression models .
sensitivity analyses conducted for the alternative atopy indicators also used the logistic multiple regression models .
we attempted to control for the influence of other confounders with spatial patterns within our data by spatially de - trending to remove the autocorrelation .
we did this within a generalized linear model ( glm ) structure [ 65 ] by applying a natural spline smoother as a sensitivity test for confounding .
these analyses were conducted using spss version 11.0.1 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) and s - plus 2000 ( mathsoft inc , seattle , wa ) .
results the prevalence rates of all asthma and asthma without hayfever are shown in table 1. with an overall prevalence of 18 % , boys had higher prevalence for asthma ( 21 %) than girls ( 15 %) , consistent with other canadian studies on the life course of asthma [ 66 ] .
the difference between the two sexes was more apparent in the younger age group , with boys having higher rates of asthma without hayfever than girls .
prevalence rates for asthma ever were similar to the larger study from which our population was drawn , but our sub - population had slightly lower rates of wheezing ever for the younger children ( data not shown ) .

these included the surfaces derived using the theissen polygon method for o3 , nox , and so2 , and a splined surface developed for pm10 .
figures 2 , 3 and 4 show the surfaces for pm10spline , o3theissen and no2lur .
all surfaces , except o3 , showed a pollution gradient within the city that followed the expected trend of higher intensities in the northeast near the industrial core , and decreasing pollution levels towards the outskirts of the city .
the o3 surface followed the opposite pattern , with lower levels in the downtown area and higher levels at the edges of the city .
figure 2 pm10 spline surface .
figure 3 o3theissen surface .
figure 4 no2lur surface .
the different pollution metrics reflect both different sources and different approaches to modelling exposure .
the so2theissen polygon surface indicates the presence of point - source industries in the northeast end of downtown hamilton .
the theissen polygon surfaces created discrete categories of pollution levels equal to the measurements obtained at the fixed moe sites .
as these are not smooth continuous surfaces , they may not accurately reflect the real variation of pollution - an inherent unavoidable characteristic of creating such polygons around the monitoring locations [ 67 ] .
the o3theissen surface had a similar categorizing effect .
the pm10spline , on the other hand , may have over - smoothed the true variation of pollution , again , due to the nature of this interpolation technique .
both the kriged and lur no2 surfaces were based on a denser network of monitors within the city. with the large variation in concentrations measured by the monitors , the kriging methodology was not able to capture the full spatial variation without incorporating some unavoidable errors included in the estimation .
the highest errors , however , tended to be outside the area encompassing the children 's residence locations .
visually , the no2lur surface appeared most heterogeneous , with the highest variation occurring around roads and densely populated areas of the lower city .
the concentrations of estimated pollutants were then assigned to the postal code of each child 's residential address .
pollution exposures in each group were quite similar for most pollutants ( table 2 ) with the exception of smaller ranges of pm10 exposure for girls and no2lur exposures for boys .
a correlation matrix was constructed for the independent variables ( see additional file 1 ) .
the pollutants had low correlations , except for o3 with nox , which were inversely related due likely to the scavenging effect of ozone by local sources of no [ 68 ] .
as expected , the two measures of no2 were correlated .
the di had a weak positive correlation with the pollutants , except with o3 where there was a weak negative correlation .
dwelling value and average income were highly correlated ( r = 0.73 ) and followed very similar patterns in their correlations with pollutants .
the rate of repair and percent old houses were also highly correlated ( r = 0.72 ) .
to avoid introducing multicollinearity , only one of the two variables in each correlated set was retained for the multivariate analysis .
di and smoking did not have strong associations with the other variables , and thus were kept for further testing in the multiple regression models .

bivariate logistic regression revealed positive , but insignificant , associations between pollution exposures and asthma outcomes when the whole population was tested .
a detailed table is available in the online appendix ( see additional file 2 ) .
the odds ratio ( or ) for asthma with no2lur , for example , was 1.02 per ppb ( 95 % ci , 1.00 - 1.04 ) but the association was insignificant .
samples were stratified based on literature suggesting that differences exist between the sexes [ 69 ] , that rates differ by age , and that asthma and asthma without hayfever have different risk factors [ 31 ] .
when testing the predictive potential of atopy related status for asthma , a positive association was found ; namely that children with hayfever symptoms were more likely to have asthma than those without hayfever symptoms ( or = 3.03 ; 95 % ci , 2.20 - 4.17 ) .
after testing interactions between the pollutants , atopy and subgroups , we found effects suggestive of an interaction between hayfever and pollutants in all girls for no2lur ( p = 0.156 ) .
the power to test for interactions in epidemiological studies is often poor , resulting in researchers missing important interactions due to lower power [ 70 ] .
as noted by selvin [ 71 ] , relaxing the type 1 error p value from the traditional 5 % to 20 % is a common approach in epidemiological studies , one that can allow for interaction tests in studies that are not powered for effect modification .
in this instance , we had substantive reasons to test for interaction , and the sub - group analysis indicates that girls are more susceptible than boys .
given this , the literature of subgroup interaction and the empirical evidence in our data , we subsequently stratified the sample into subgroups by age , sex , and by age and sex .
it is important to note that all subgroups were investigated ; however , due to the large number of tested associations between the subgroups , and the voluminous resulting tables , only the significant results for the susceptible groups are included in this paper to avoid detracting from the main findings by listing tables of insignificant effects .
tables 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 show the associations for the stratified analysis conducted for the non - atopy related asthma population within the subgroups .
asthma without hayfever was associated with no2lur for all girls and older girls .
we also ran trivariate logistic regressions on the significant associations identified in the bivariate tests for asthma without hayfever ( see table 7 ) .
the effects of pollutants remained robust .
no2lur retained significance with asthma without hayfever in all girls for each confounding variable .
for the subpopulation of older girls , the odds ratios were generally stronger after adjustment for potential compositional and contextual variables .
we used these regressions to test for the effect of the compositional and contextual variables on the percent change in the regression coefficients of the models .
testing the most robust group of associations ( no2lur and all girls ) identified the deprivation index ( di ) and rate of repair as the variables that reduced the regression coefficient by more than 10 % .
these were retained as the confounding variables for the multiple variable logistic regressions .

the coefficient changed slightly from 0.128 to 0.130 when the smoother was applied to 10 degrees of freedom ( df ) , and to 0.129 for 20 df ( p < 0.05 ) .
using the natural spline smoother , increasing spans indicated a more localized analysis .
this sensitivity analysis lends further support to the notion that confounding probably does not bias the coefficients as the effects were robust .
for further sensitivity analysis , we tested the alternative indicators of atopic conditions ( eczema and runny nose not associated with a cold ) to assess whether the selection of indicator made a difference in the air pollution and asthma relationship .
the results were sensitive to the selection of other indicators of atopic conditions , as they were positive for the most part , but were no longer significant .
we also assessed the sensitivity of the association of wheeze ever and current wheeze with the same symptom indicators of atopic conditions , and the pattern of effects was similar to that observed for asthma .
after controlling for confounders and copollutants , no2lur remained significant with wheeze ever without hayfever ( or = 1.13 , 95 % ci , 1.01 - 1.23 ) and current wheeze without hayfever ( or = 1.28 , 95 % ci , 1.06 - 1.55 ) for all girls ( or = 1.15 , 95 % ci , 1.00 - 1.31 ) and older girls ( or = 1.35 , 95 % ci , 1.10 - 1.66 ) .
discussion there were no significant associations between any of the exposure estimates and asthma in the whole population , but large effects were detected the subgroup of children without hayfever ( predominately in girls ) .
more specifically , after controlling for confounders we observed significant associations between no2lur and non - atopy related asthma in all girls and older girls .
the no2lur surface provided the only robust associations with all girls and older girls after running the co - pollutant models and glm sensitivity analyses .
sensitivity analyses for the definition of respiratory symptoms without hayfever showed that using wheeze instead of asthma as a respiratory health effect still revealed similar findings ; however , if alternative indicators of atopic disease ( eczema or runny nose without a cold ) were used , the effects were not robust .
the sizes of the effects found in the asthma without hayfever models are significant .
for older girls , the or is 3.46 ( 95 % ci , 1.19 - 10.07 ) for the no2lur ( calculated for mean - minimum pollution ) .
taking the exposure coefficients from the co - pollutant models brings the estimates closer to or = 2.98 ( 95 % ci , 0.98 - 9.02 ) for older girls and to or = 1.85 ( 95 % ci , 0.92 - 3.73 ) for all girls using the same exposure contrast .
the high collinearity between the pollutants probably contributed to the wider confidence intervals in the co - pollutant models .
an analysis among a sub - sample with home - based exposure measurements from the southern california children 's health study ( chs ) revealed an association between asthma prevalence and home and outdoor no2 of or = 1.83 ( 95 % ci , 1.04 - 3.22 ) per increase of one iqr ( 5.7 ppb ) in exposure [ 72 ] .
thus , while both studies observed similarly sized effects , our effects were only within the asthma subgroup without hayfever .
other researchers have also commented on the relevance and importance of non - atopy related respiratory symptoms .
heinrich and colleagues [ 73 ] evaluated tap exposure using self - administered subjective questionnaires assessing traffic intensity in a population of 6896 adults .
high traffic intensity increased the risk for non - allergic asthma , but not for atopic symptoms including allergic sensitization .
non - allergic asthma in this study was identified as having current asthma but a negative screening assay for specific sensitizations to mite , cat , dog , pollen and fungal allergens .
douwes et al .
[ 30 ] highlighted the importance of investigating non - allergic asthma , as allergic asthma contributes to approximately 50 % of asthma cases ; thus , much of the increase in asthma incidence may been attributed to non - allergic asthma .
romanet - manent and colleagues' [ 74 ] estimation of the contribution of non - allergic asthma is slightly lower , at 10 - 30 % of asthmatics .
clinical differences between atopic and non - atopic asthma were initially identified by rackeman et al .
[ 75 ] to include key factors such as gender , increasing age , increased severity of lung function , and chronic rhinosinusitis .
other recent studies support this earlier differentiation of asthma , placing increasing emphasis on the genetic investigations of each subtype [ 76 ] .
douwes et al .
[ 30 ] also hypothesize that exposures to bacterial endotoxins and air pollutants may induce non - allergic or non - atopic asthma .
nystad et al .
[ 31 ] suggest that increases in exposure and adjuvant factors may be contributing to the asthmatic response without triggering atopic symptoms , such as hayfever and eczema .
non - allergic asthma is generally associated with increased neutrophil and interleukin - 8 levels [ 77 ] , but the biological mechanisms in which no2 causes the non - atopic effects to occur are not as clear .
particulate pollution has shown to induce neutrophilic air inflammation [ 78 ] .
seaton and dennecamp [ 79 ] propose that strong correlations between no2 and ultrafine particles ( ufp = particulate matter less than 0.1 micrometre in diameter ) may explain why no2 would appear significant in health studies .
in the most stringent analysis controlling for confounders and co - pollutants , effects were observed in all girls and older girls and only for the no2lur model , a result consistent with recent findings from the chs cohorts in southern california [ 20 ] .
female sex has shown to increase the risk of a non - allergic type of asthma in an adult population [ 74 ] although no mechanism for this difference was suggested .
gold et al .
[ 80 ] have suggested that gender differences in asthma rates might be due to differences inherent in the mechanical properties of the lung and inflammatory responses .
alternatively , venn et al .
[ 81 ] proposed that hormonal changes occurring in early puberty may affect prevalence rates , as well as differential exposures to triggers for wheeze or asthma , such as smoking .
berhane et al .
[ 82 ] have found that duration and age of onset of asthma differs between the sexes , thus having differential impacts on lung function .
there may also be additional factors influencing exposure times to pollution levels that we were not able to account for in this study .
there are limitations in this study that warrant comment .
we had few individual - level covariate data for the children ; thus , we created proxies for true individual factors by the use of information available at the census tract level .
while contextual level data is important [ 83 ] , lack of control for the individual factors , such as smoking at home , which has shown to impact the respiratory health of children , may have biased our results [ 16,84 ] .
the sensitivity analysis with the glm indicated that some confounding might have remained , possibly due to individual level factors with spatial attributes not captured within our proxy variables .
the use of the glm model has , however , reduced this possibility as the removal of spatial structures in the data reduces residual confounding .
non - atopic asthma is widely - accepted to be identifiable from the absence of positive skin prick tests for ige mediated sensitizations to common allergens which include dust mites , pet and particular foods [ 30 ] .
in the absence of this objective evidence relative to atopic indicators , we had to rely on associated symptoms .
upton et al .
[ 85 ] suggest that clinicians and epidemiologists often use other allergic manifestations such as hayfever to identify atopy when the skin test data is unavailable ; indeed they use that same definition to identify 20 year intergenerational trends in prevalence of asthma and hayfever .
they do , however , emphasize that the difference between atopic and non - atopic asthma cannot be validated solely on the presence or absence of hayfever .
ronmark et al .
[ 32 ] defined atopic asthma as asthma with at least one positive skin prick allergy test , while romanet - manent et al .
[ 74 ] defined this as allergic asthma .
to avoid adding to these differences and complications , we chose to report our outcome as asthma without hayfever , rather than non - atopic or non - allergic asthma , and acknowledge the fact that we cannot be certain of the atopic / non - atopic difference with the available data .
since the isaac study took place in 1994 and 1995 , and the monitoring for the kriging and lur modelling was conducted in 2002 , temporal discontinuity exists between the health outcomes and both of our no2 surfaces .
in spite of this potential limitation , research shows that there has been little change in pollution levels within this time period , and , more importantly , that the spatial variation of pollution has not changed substantially from 1995 to 2002 [ 42 ] .
hamilton 's distinct topography ( especially the niagara escarpment ) , downtown industrial core , and prevailing wind direction contribute to a consistent spatial pattern of pollution that has long been known to decrease from the industrial core outwards to the rest of hamilton [ 86 ] .
similar to european findings [ 87 ] , although pollution levels may fluctuate , the spatial pattern of no2 appears consistent over time .
conclusion we found significant associations between exposure to modeled no2 and asthma without hayfever outcomes in children living in hamilton .
girls with asthma without hayfever , and particularly older girls , were most susceptible to the effects of no2 or a closely associated co - pollutant .
the effects were sensitive to the method of exposure estimation , and more refined exposure models produced the most robust associations .
given the potential role of non - atopic asthma , further studies should include objective determination of atopic status using skin allergy tests or serum ige levels .
since no2 may proxy for other pollutants that can cause adverse health outcomes such as ultrafine particles [ 79 ] , further research is needed on the identification and measurement of which pollutants may be associated with the observed effects .

the aim of the present study was to optimize the conditions of antibody arrays for detecting hippocalcin - like 1 ( hpcal1 ) , phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 ( pebp1 ) , lectin galactoside - binding soluble 7 ( lgals7 ) , and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade e member 2 ( serpine2 ) as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer detection in a single assay and to investigate antibodies' specificity and cross - reactivity .
capture antibodies against hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 were printed on nitrocellulose coated glass slides .
hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 proteins with different concentrations were incubated with the capture antibodies at different temperatures for different time periods .
biotinylated detection antibodies recognizing a different epitope on the captured proteins and a secondary detection molecule ( streptavidin - pe ) were used to detect fluorescent signals .
the arrays showed the strongest signals when the concentration of the capture antibodies was at 500 microg / ml in pbst0.05 ( pbs with 0.05 % tween - 20 ) , and the slides were incubated overnight at 4degreesc .
the lowest protein concentration for detection was 2 ng / ml. each antibody demonstrated high specificity to the corresponding antigen in detecting a mixture of 4 proteins without significant cross - reactivity .
the fluorescence and biomarker concentration displayed a linear correlation .
the antibody microarray system could be a useful tool for potential biomarker detection for pancreatic cancer .
cancer biomarker hpcal1 pebp1 lgals7 serpine2 antibody microarray introduction in cancer , a biomarker refers to a substance or process that is indicative of the presence of cancer in the body .
great efforts have been put forth to develop new methods for rapid , sensitive and accurate detection of biomarkers .
a biomarker could be either a molecule secreted by tumor or a specific response of the body to the presence of cancer .
genetic , epigenetic , proteomic , glycomic and imaging biomarkers can be used for cancer diagnosis , prognosis and epidemiology study [ 1 ] .
biomarkers measured in a variety of patient samples , including blood , tissue , urine and cerebrospinal fluid , are used in a diverse array of clinical settings .
the application of biomarkers to cancer is leading the way because of the unique association of genomic changes in cancer cells with the disease process .
pancreatic cancer is the sixth highest cause of mortality from malignant tumors in europe and the fourth - highest in the united states [ 2 ],[ 3 ] .
the dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer is due to the late stage at which it is usually diagnosed because pancreatic cancer patients seldom exhibit disease - specific symptoms until late in the course of the disease [ 4 ],[ 5 ] , and the high invasive and metastatic potential of pancreatic tumors result in a low rate of curative resections and a high frequency of relapse .
long - term survival from pancreatic cancer is possible if the disease is identified at an early stage [ 6 ],[ 7 ] .
therefore , biomarkers play an important role in the detection at an early stage .
several serum markers have been investigated for pancreatic cancer .
elevated ca19 - 9 level has been cited as a potential marker of the disease [ 8 ] - [ 12 ] , and other existing biomarkers relate to the inflammation that associates with the tumor and other pancreatic diseases that may be present [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
recently , various microarray formats have been utilized for studying glycosylation patterns [ 16 ],[ 17 ] .
in one study examining serum samples from patients with colon and pancreatic cancers , glycoproteins extracted from the serum were printed on glass slides and hybridized against various lectins to study changes in the glycan patterns during cancer progression [ 18 ],[ 19 ] .
the antibody microarray is a favorable format for high throughput analysis , with high specificity and reproducibility [ 20 ] - [ 22 ] .
in 2007 , the lustgarten foundation undertook an extensive bioinformatics analysis of the published literature to identify the top 60 most promising biomarkers for pancreatic cancer .
in the present study , we selected four biomarkers hippocalcin - like 1 ( hpcal1 ) , phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 ( pebp1 ) , lectin galactoside - binding soluble 7 ( lgals7 ) and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade e member 2 ( serpine2 ) to develop an antibody microarray system that could have potential clinical diagnostic applications .
the current study focused on two areas : one was to optimize the standard curves of these four biomarkers so that they can be used to calculate the concentration of biomarkers quantitatively ; the other was to investigate the cross - reactivity and to further develop array - based assay so that multiple biomarkers can be detected in a single assay .
materials and methods materials hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 proteins and corresponding antibodies were generated as previously described [ 23 ] .
antibody microarrays were prepared as previously described [ 24 ] .
methods an outline of the experiment flow of microarray proecessing is described in fig 1 .
a piezoelectric contact printer ( auson 2470 arrayer ) was used to spot approximately 260 pl of each antibody solution at a certain concentration on the surfaces of nitrocellulose - coated glass microscope slides ( path slides ; gentel biosciences , madison , usa ) .
forty - eight identical arrays were printed on each slide , with each array consisting of two different antibodies at first .
when the conditions were optimized , then coated four antibodies were coated to detect the cross - reactivity .
all of the antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting human proteins hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 .
each capture antibody was printed in triplicate , and biotinylated bsa was printed as control ( fig. 2 ) .
a wax border was imprinted around each of the arrays to define hydrophobic boundaries ( slideimprinter , the gel company , san francisco , ca , usa ) .
the printed slides were stored at 4degreesc in a desiccated , vacuum - sealed slide box until use. fig. 1 an outline of the experiment flow of microarray processing. fig. 2 microarray slides .
the microarray was patterned as follows : 1 ) the first row with anti - hpcal1 ( 5a5 ) , diluted in pbst0.05 ; 2 ) the second row with anti - hpcal1 ( 5a5 ) , diluted in pbs ; 3 ) the third row with anti - pebp1 ( 8e2 ) , diluted in pbst0.05 ; and 4 ) the last row with anti - pebp1 ( 8e2 ) , diluted in pbs .
the antibody concentration was 250 microg / ml. for condition optimization , capture antibodies printed on slides were diluted in two different buffers : pbs and pbst0.05 ( pbs with 0.05 % tween - 20 ) , and with three different concentrations : 250 microg / ml , 500 microg / ml , and 750 microg / ml. for multi - marker detection system , capture antibodies were only diluted in pbst0.05 with one concentration at 500 microg / ml. first , vacuum sealed arrays were equilibrated with ambient temperature for 30 min before use .
slides were washed in pbst0.5 ( pbs with 0.5 % tween - 20 ) for 3 min with gentle shaking , and dried by centrifuging for 2 min at 900 g. then , the slides were blocked with 1 % bsa in pbst0.5 for 1 h in a humidified chamber to prevent from evaporating .
excess capture antibodies were washed away with the blocking buffer by shaking .
a serial dilution of protein or protein mixture samples containing 0.1 % brij - 35 ( pierce , rockford , il , usa ) in pbst0.1 ( pbs with 0.1 % tween - 20 ) were applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature ( rt ) or overnight at 4degreesc with gentle agitation .
excess protein was removed by three washes with pbst0.5 , each for 3 min with shaking .
then biotinylated detection antibodies either along or mixed together , were diluted to 3 microg / ml with 0.1 % bsa / pbst0.1 and added to the corresponding blocks , incubating for 1 h at rt. the arrays were washed with pbst0.5 and blocked briefly with 1 % bsa / pbs before probing with streptavidin - pe. the streptavidin - pe was diluted to 2 microg / ml with pbst containing 0.1 % bsa and probed to the array for 1 h. the labeled slide was washed with pbst0.5 for three times , and dried by centrifugation .
the slides were scanned using a genepix 4000b microarray scanner , and the data were processed using genepix pro 3.0 software [ 25 ] .
results comparison of capture antibodies diluted in pbs and pbst0.05 using the microarray format , we compared the conditions of the experiment .
first , we printed two capture antibodies anti - hpcal1 5a5 and anti - pebp1 8e2 in two different buffers , pbs and pbs with 0.05 % tween - 20 .
after blocking and washing away the excess antibodies , serially diluted hpcal1 and pebp1 proteins were applied to the multiplexed arrays .
following incubation and washes , the arrays were probed with the respective biotinylated detection antibodies anti - hpcal1 1e10 and anti - pebp1 4f10 .
fluorescent signal was generated by incubating the arrays with streptavidin - pe. the experiment was repeated for confirmation .
the results in fig. 3 showed that antibodies in pbst0.05 had much stronger signals than in pbs .
concentration comparison of capture antibodies fig. 3 comparison of capture antibodies diluted in pbs and pbst0.05 .
microarray slides were patterned as in fig 1 .
the two proteins were applied to the arrays , respectively , followed by detecting with detection antibodies and fluorescence labeling with pe. to optimize the concentrations of the capture antibodies , we printed slides with 3 different concentrations of the two capture antibodies , anti - hpcal1 5a5 and anti - pebp1 8e2 at 250 microg / ml , 500 microg / ml and 750 microg / ml. serially diluted hpcal1 and pebp1 were applied to the arrays , respectively .
the results showed , that the concentrations of 500 microg / ml and 750 microg / ml had no significant impact on fluorescent signal ; signals might be saturated at the concentration of 750 microg / ml. so the optimal concentration for the capture antibodies was set to 500 microg / ml ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 concentration comparison of the capture antibodies .
( a ) serially diluted hpcal1 in pbst0.1 containing 0.1 % brij were applied to the arrays which were printed with different concentrations of the capture antibody anti - hpcal1 5a5 .
( b ) serially diluted pebp1 in pbst0.1 containing 0.1 % brij were applied to the arrays which were printed with different concentrations of the capture antibody anti - pebp1 8e2 .
incubation temperature comparison to optimize the incubation temperature conditions of the antibody array , after hpcal1 and pebp1 proteins were applied to the arrays , the slides were incubated either overnight ( o / n ) at 4degreesc , or for 1 h at rt separately with the same other conditions .
the results showed that the signal of overnight incubation at 4degreesc is much stronger than 1 h at rt ( fig. 5 ). fig. 5 comparison of protein incubation for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4degreesc .
the results showed that the signal of overnight at incubation 4degreesc was much stronger than that of 1 h at room temperature .
a : hpcal1 ; b : pebp1 .
antibody specificity and cross - reactivity test after the conditions were optimized ( the capture antibody at 500 ng / ml in pbst0.05 , and incubation overnight at 4degreesc ) , we next investigated the specificities of each antibody , and whether there were cross - reactivity among antibodies to different proteins .
in this experiment , four sets of capture and detection antibodies against four different antigens ( hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 ) were compared and analyzed in all possible combinations .
as shown in fig. 6 , for example , when hpcal1 protein was present , hpcal1 capture ab 5a5 only captured hpcal1 , and its detection ab 1e10 only detected hpcal1 protein .
these results demonstrated that each capture and detection antibody were specific to their corresponding protein , and the cross - reactivity to other proteins was either none or extremely low .
the protein concentrations were set to high at 125 ng / ml or 256 ng / ml to avoid background interference. fig. 6 antibody specificity tests .
firstly , the cross - reactivity was tested between hpcal1 and pebp1 , and the results ( a - e ) showed that there was no cross - reactivity observed .
a : hpcal1 protein was added and the detection antibody was hpcal1 1e10 .
b : pebp1 protein was added and the detection was pebp1 4f10 .
c : hpcal1 protein was added , and the detection antibody was pebp1 4f10 .
d : pebp1 protein was added , and the detection antibody was hpcal1 1e10 .
secondly , the cross - reactivity tests were conducted among hpcal1 - 5a5 , pebp1 - 8e2 , lgals7 - 2a7 and serpine2 - 2g4 .
the results showed that there were no cross - reactivities betweeh each two of the four proteins .
e : cross - reactivity tests between hpcal1 and pebp1 .
f : cross - reactivity tests between hpcal1 and lgals7 .
g : cross - reactivity tests between hpcal1 and serpine2 .
h : cross - reactivity tests between lgals7 and pebp1 .
i : cross - reactivity tests between lgals7 and serpine2 .
j : cross - reactivity test between pebp1 and serpine2 .
cap : capture antibody ; det : detection antibody .
simultaneous detection of hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 our final goal was to establish an assay system which allowed detecting multiple biomarkers in a single setting .
we proved that the antibodies to each protein were specific and did not cross - react with any other proteins ( fig. 6 ) .
in this experiment , capture antibodies were printed onto slide separately ; four different proteins were mixed and incubated with capture antibodies on the slide followed by incubating with mixed detection antibodies .
the results in fig. 7 ( a - h ) showed that the sensitivity reached to 2 ng / ml. when the concentrations of these four biomarkers were below 256 ng / ml , the fluorescence and biomarker concentration displayed a liner correlation shown in fig. 7 ( i - l ). fig. 7 simultaneous detection of hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 by detection cocktail antibodies .
serially diluted mixture of hpcal1 , pebp1 , lgals7 and serpine2 ( a : blank control .
b : 2 ng / ml. c : 4 ng / ml. d : 16 ng / ml. e : 32 ng / ml. f : 64 ng / ml. g : 128 ng / ml. h : 256 ng / ml ) were probed , followed by detection with antibody cocktail .
the other spots not underlined were other different proteins not shown in this paper .
i - l showed that when the concentration of these four markers were below 256 ng / ml , the fluorescence and biomarker concentration displayed a linear correlation ( i : hpcal .
j : pebp1 .
k : lgals7 .
l : serpine2 ) .
discussion in this study we optimized the conditions of antibody arrays .
four potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer diagnosis were chosen , and their corresponding antibodies were printed on coated glass slides .
we found that when the concentration of the capture antibodies was at 500 microg / ml in pbst0.05 and the slides were incubated overnight at 4degreesc , the arrays gave the strongest signals .
simultaneous detection of these four markers worked very well with almost no cross - reactivity .
moreover , the fluorescence and biomarker concentration displayed a linear correlation .
the experimental features of microarrays have advantages for cancer research .
the advantage of low sample volume results in the consumption of small amounts of both precious clinical samples and expensive antibodies .
the assays can be run efficiently in parallel , enabling studies on large populations of samples that are necessary for biomarker discovery and validation .
in addition , the assays have good reproducibility , high sensitivity and quantitative accuracy over large concentration ranges [ 26 ] .
in the future , we hope to establish collaboration with hospitals or clinical diagnostic laboratories , run pancreatic cancer serum samples using antibody array format to identify differences in these potential biomarkers compared to normal and pancreatitis serum samples .
patient sera with different types and stages of pancreatic cancer will also be examined .
pancreatic cancer continues to have a high mortality rate due to detection at a late stage of the disease .
we hope that the antibody array technology would eventually be able to provide a practical means to characterize patterns of variation in hundreds of thousands of different proteins in clinic and research applications .

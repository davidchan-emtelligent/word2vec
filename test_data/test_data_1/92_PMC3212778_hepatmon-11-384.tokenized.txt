rosuvastatin reduces nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis c treated with alpha - interferon and ribavirin 2011 hepat mon rosuvastatin chronic hepatitis c interferon ribavirin dear editor , the prospective randomized clinical trial of malaguarnera and colleagues , published in the current issue of hepatitis monthly , investigates the potential role of a commercially available hmg co - a reductase agent - rosuvastatin ( crestor , astra zeneca ) - in combination with non - pegylated interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c ( hcv ) .
hmg co - a reductase agents , commonly referred to as statins , are popular agents prescribed throughout the world , for their cholesterol lowering effects in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
they are well - recognized to improve liver biochemistry in dyslipidemic patients with non - alcoholic fatty liver disease [ 1 ] ; but recent reports have suggested that they may possess an antiviral effect on hcv independent of their lipid lowering activity .
in an in vitro study [ 2 ] , various statin agents were reported to have differing effects on hcv replication in combination with interferon with fluvastatin ( lescol , novartis ) exhibiting the strongest anti - hcv activity , atorvastatin ( lipitor , pfizer ) had moderate activity whereas pravastatin ( pravachol , bristol myers squibb ) had no activity .
likewise , the combination of statins - specifically simvistatin and mevastatin - in combination with protease / polymerase inhibitor agents were found to clear hcv replicons from culture [ 3 ] .
it is interesting that this in vitro study also found that pravastatin exhibited no antiviral activity [ 3 ] .
clinically , the experience of statin agents in the treatment of hcv has not been very well - studied and the reported outcomes have been interesting yet at times conflicting .
fluvastatin monotherapy was reported to produce a modest 1.75 log decrease in hcv viral load in hcv monoinfected patients [ 4 ] .
the same statin , however , resulted in a paradoxical increase in viral load in a study of 42 hiv - hcv co - infected patients [ 5 ] , presumably , as a result of a statin - dependent up - regulation of low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol receptors that are also required for hcv entry into cells .
in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin therapy , fluvastatin has been reported to be associated with an increased likelihood of rapid virologic response ( rvr ) after 4 weeks if not a sustained virologic response in hiv - hcv co - infected patients [ 6 ] and a small open label single arm study of high viral load hcv monoinfected genotype 1 patients reported a suggestion of an enhanced svr [ 7 ] .
given the lack of published randomized clinical trials in this area , the paper by malaguarnera et al. is therefore of interest .
these investigators from the university of catania , italy , randomized 65 hcv - infected patients , the overwhelming majority of whom had genotype 1 infection , to receive either rosuvastatin 5 mg / day or placebo , in combination with non - pegylated interferon and ribavirin .
improvements were noted in liver biochemistry , lipid profile , markers of insulin resistance and histology ( steatosis and fibrosis ) favoring the rosuvastatin arm. of interest is the reported statistically significant advantage in svr favoring the rosuvastatin arm : an apparent overall svr of 69 % vs. 62 % in the cohort of presumably treatment naive and relapse patients and 51 % vs. 40 % in presumably treatment naive patients .
although these results appear to be impressive , restraint must be advised when interpreting this study .
the absolute numbers of patients are small as the absolute difference in svr between the two study arms was three patients overall and four patients in the treatment naive group .
moreover , the reported svr with non - pegylated interferon and ribavirin is much higher than that one would expect from the registration trial of peginterferon vs. non - peginterferon and ribavirin [ 8 ] .
one would also have to wonder what potential role statin agents would have in the upcoming era of protease inhibitors that promise an svr of 60 % - 75 % in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin [ 9 ][ 10 ] .
nevertheless , the work of malaguarnera and colleagues is certainly hypothesis generating and given that the protease inhibitors are specific for genotype 1 patients , statin agents , that appear to be non - toxic in hcv patients , may have an adjuvant role in non - genotype 1 patients for whom no direct acting antiviral agents ( daa ) are on the horizon .
considering that the previously mentioned in vitro study suggests a role in enhancing the effect of protease and polymerase inhibitors [ 3 ] , it is conceivable that adding a statin to the triple combination of protease / polymerase inhibitor , peginterferon and ribavirin may improve on the impressive svrs of these daa medications .
clearly , more clinical trials are needed with these agents .

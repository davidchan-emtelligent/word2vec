introduction cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) has improved in past decades , but inflammatory activation in this setting is still unpredictable and is associated with several postoperative complications .
perioperative levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( mif ) and other inflammatory mediators could be implicated in adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery .
methods serum levels of mif , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( mcp ) - 1 , soluble cd40 ligand , il - 6 and il - 10 from 93 patients subjected to cpb were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared with specific and global postoperative organ dysfunctions through multiple organ dysfunction score ( mods ) and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) .
results most of the cytokines measured had a peak of production between 3 and 6 hours after cpb , but maximum levels of mif occurred earlier , at the cessation of cpb .
among specific organ dysfunctions , the most frequent was hematological , occurring in 82 % of the patients .
circulatory impairment was observed in 73.1 % of the patients , and 51 % of these needed inotropics or vasopressors within the first 24 hours after surgery .
the third most frequent dysfunction was pulmonary , occurring in 48.4 % of the patients .
preoperative levels of mif showed a relevant direct correlation with the intensity of global organ dysfunction measured by sofa ( rho = 0.46 , p < 0.001 ) and mods ( rho = 0.50 , p < 0.001 ) on the third day after surgery .
mcp - 1 production was associated with postoperative thrombocytopenia , and mif was related to the use of a high dose of vasopressors in patients with cardiovascular impairment and also to lower values of the ratio of partial arterial oxygen tension ( pao2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen ( fio2 ) registered in the first 24 hours after cpb .
conclusion despite the multifactorial nature of specific or multiple organ dysfunctions , mif should be explored as a predicting factor of organ dysfunction , or even as a potential therapeutic target in decreasing postoperative complications .
see related commentary , introduction cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) is known to be associated with many aggressive factors , including operative trauma , cardioplegia , ischemia - reperfusion injury and the contact of blood with bioactive surfaces , potentially related to platelet activation and inflammation [ 1 ] .
lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) has been proved to circulate after cardiac surgery with cpb [ 2 ] and , despite substantial technological improvements in past decades , an acute transcriptional response of genes involved in the innate immune response occurs , which can lead to systemic inflammation and postoperative organ dysfunction [ 3 ] .
several circulating inflammatory mediators , including pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines [ 4 ] and chemokines [ 5 ] , could be associated with postoperative outcomes .
macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( mif ) has been considered a central mediator of the innate immune response as a natural ligand of cd74 and has been implicated in cellular signaling and activation [ 6 ] .
moreover , mif is known to regulate p53 - induced apoptosis , which is one of the main mechanisms of immune activation control [ 7 ] .
constitutively expressed , mif is stored in intracellular granules and is rapidly secreted under inflammatory stimuli , exerting powerful pro - inflammatory actions ( reviewed in [ 8 ]) .
previous studies have demonstrated that high mif levels might have implications for pathological disorders in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome , severe sepsis , and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 9 - 12 ] .
the correlation of poor outcomes and high levels of mif , particularly in patients in an injury setting , could be explained both by the pro - inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties of this cytokine , especially by modulating the expression of toll - like receptor - 4 , a signal - transducing molecule of the lps receptor complex , and the signal transduction cascade inherent in its activation [ 13 ] .
in cardiac surgery , mif levels six hours after cpb were associated with a poorer postoperative pulmonary short - course outcome [ 14 ] .
chemotactic proteins have an important role in evoking inflammatory responses .
monocyte chemoattractant protein ( mcp ) - 1 has the property of chemoattracting mononuclear phagocytes , natural killer cells , t cells , mast cells , and basophils .
deleterious sequelae have been attributed to its expression .
it has been implicated in transendothelial monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation .
moreover , mcp - 1 can induce respiratory burst activity and stimulate lysosomal enzyme release from monocytes and also contributes to tissue damage [ 15 ] .
soluble cd40 ligand ( scd40l ) , a member of the tnf family produced by activated platelets , upregulates the expression of inflammatory adhesion receptors and cellular activators , and circulates in response to cardiac surgery with cpb [ 16 ] .
il - 6 is a cytokine with recognized pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory properties that acts as an indicator of intensity of inflammatory response [ 17 ] .
il - 10 decreases the lps - induced production of pro - inflammatory cytokines by macrophages as an attempt to modulate host response to injury [ 18 ] , which is essential in re - establishing homeostasis after trauma .
the present study attempts to evaluate preoperative , perioperative and postoperative circulating levels of mif and other inflammatory markers , to explore eventual associations between them and postoperative organ dysfunctions .
materials and methods this prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and ethical committee for research of the pro cardiaco hospital , rio de janeiro , brazil , and was performed in a research laboratory associated with the surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary care cardiology hospital .
under informed consent , patients who underwent major cardiovascular thoracic operations from august 2004 to august 2005 , in both elective and non - elective settings , were enrolled consecutively .
we excluded patients with neoplastic or chronic inflammatory diseases , and those under immunomodulatory treatment or drugs , including steroids , aprotinin , coagulation factors , and non - steroid anti - inflammatory agents .
anesthesia was performed in accordance with institutional standards [ 14 ] .
after anticoagulation with sodium heparin , normothermic ( 34 to 37degreesc ) cpb was performed with a continuous - flow membrane oxygenator ( dmg - shunt ; dmg equipamentos medicos , duque de caxias , brazil ) .
the cpb priming solution consisted of mannitol and ringer 's solution , in a final volume of 2,000 ml. cardioplegia was induced and maintained by way of st thomas solutions .
peripheral blood was harvested immediately before anesthesia induction , at the cessation of cpb , and 3 , 6 , 10 , and 24 hours after the end of cpb .
serum and plasma were separated by centrifugation at 800 g for 15 minutes at 4degreesc and were kept frozen at - 70degreesc until assayed .
serum levels of mif , mcp - 1 , il - 6 , il - 10 , and scd40l were assayed by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay sandwich technique ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's recommendations .
clinical characteristics including demographics , past medical history , present surgical intervention , and subsequent hospital course were recorded .
the preoperative risk profile of all patients was assessed with the european system for cardiac operative risk evaluation ( euroscore ) [ 19 ] .
global and specific organ dysfunctions were assessed with the multiple organ dysfunction score ( mods ) [ 20 ] and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) [ 21 ] scales , registered during the first 72 hours after surgery .
statistical analysis for the assessment of sequential variations in circulating levels of the markers studied we used an analysis of variance for repeated measures with the bonferroni test .
data are shown as means +/ - sem when they had a normal distribution , or as median ( range from first to third quartile ) if the distribution was not normal .
differences between groups were analyzed with the mann - whitney u test .
correlations were assessed with the spearman test .
values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic potential by means of the area under the curve and the diagnostic accuracy of the markers at various cutoff points .
the optimal cutoff value was obtained by calculating the maximum value for the product of sensitivity and specificity .
results the 93 patients included in the study were 66.2 +/ - 11.6 years old ; 60 ( 64.5 %) were male , and the body mass index was 25.9 +/ - 6.5 .
the median ( range from first to third quartile ) euroscore was 4.58 ( 2 to 7 ) .
twenty - nine patients ( 31 %) were operated on under non - elective conditions , and did not differ from electively operated patients in age , duration of cpb , or perioperative blood and fluid balance .
patients who were subjected to cardiac surgery in urgent or emergency settings had a higher euroscore ( 6.23 +/ - 0.75 versus 3.70 +/ - 0.35 ; p = 0.001 ) than electively operated patients .
concerning preoperative cardiopulmonary functional status , patients in new york heart association ( nyha ) classes iii and iv ( n = 57 ; 61.2 %) predominated over those in nyha classes i and ii ( n = 36 ; 38.8 %) .
patients were subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery ( cabs ) ( n = 60 ; 64.5 %) , to cabs associated with intracardiac open - heart surgeries ( n = 14 ; 15.1 %) , to valve replacement and / or repair ( n = 16 ; 17.2 %) , or to aortic surgery ( n = 3 ; 3.2 %) .
the duration of cpb was 100 ( 80 to 130 ) minutes .
intraoperative fluid balance was 9.09 ( 6.31 to 11.36 ) ml / kg per hour , and 45 patients ( 48.4 %) received perioperative hemotransfusion .
demographics and preoperative data are summarized in table 1 .
postoperative outcomes the duration of cpb was directly associated with sofa ( p = 0.003 , rho = 0.319 ) and mods ( p = 0.004 , rho = 0.305 ) was measured during the first day after surgery .
for a better understanding of the postoperative outcomes in the first day , indicators of organ dysfunction were individually analyzed .
according to mods criteria for specific organ dysfunction , hematological dysfunction occurred in 82 % of the patients .
circulatory impairment occurred in 73.1 % of the studied population , and 51 % needed inotropics or vasopressors within the first 24 hours after surgery .
the third most frequent organ dysfunction was pulmonary ( 48.4 %) , followed by neurological disturbances ( 25.8 %) and renal impairment ( 16 %) .
postoperative image - documented stroke occurred in three patients ( 3.2 %) .
postoperative levels of bilirubin remained near the normal range , and did not have a relevant effect on postoperative global organ dysfunction .
the levels of c - reactive protein ( crp ) were 4.9 ( 2.6 to 7.4 ) mg / dl on the first day and 14.7 ( 10.7 to 21.2 ) mg / dl on the third day after surgery .
the overall postoperative mortality in this series was 7.5 % ( seven patients ) , with no significant difference between electively and non - electively operated patients .
postoperative kinetic of inflammatory markers as shown by analysis of variance for repeated measures with the bonferroni test ( p < 0.05 ) , mif , mcp - 1 , and il - 6 exhibit remarkable changes related to cardiovascular surgery with cpb .
peak levels of mif were reached at the end of cpb and were directly associated with its time course ( p = 0.001 , rho = 0.391 ) .
nevertheless , maximum levels of mcp - 1 and il - 6 were only observed three hours after cpb .
the levels of scd40l did not change significantly until 6 hours after cpb ; thereafter a decline was observed at 10 and 24 hours after cpb ( figure 1 ) .
il - 10 was detectable in very few samples and no significant change was recorded in its circulating level during the studied period .
no differences were found between inflammatory markers of elective and non - elective surgical settings , except for higher postoperative levels of il - 6 ( p < 0.05 ) and for a tendency toward higher preoperative levels of mif ( p = 0.087 ) in non - elective patients .
preoperative levels of mif are correlated to multiple organ dysfunctions preoperative circulating levels of mif were significantly associated with the intensity of organ dysfunction , as measured by sofa ( p < 0.001 , rho = 0.46 ) and mods ( p < 0.001 , rho = 0.50 ) , on the third day after surgery ( figure 2 ) .
the upper quartile of distribution consisted of patients with sofa and mods values higher than five .
it was observed that preoperative levels of mif were able to identify these subjects demonstrated by areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.767 +/ - 0.065 for sofa and 0.794 +/ - 0.067 for mods .
the best cutoff value for preoperative mif was 1,100 pg / ml ( fourfold the value in healthy controls ) , with sensitivities of 89.5 % and 93.3 % and specificities of 64.9 % and 66.1 % for sofa and mods , respectively .
correspondingly , the retrospective calculations of power were 85 .
3 % and 97.1 % .
pressure - adjusted heart rate , the marker of circulatory dysfunction used in mods , was not associated with circulating mif .
however , higher levels of mif 3 hours after cpb and il - 6 10 hours after cpb were related to the need to use high doses of vasopressors within the first 24 hours after surgery ( p = 0.017 and p = 0.05 , respectively ) .
notably , levels of mif or il - 6 were not significantly different between patients who needed dobutamine or low doses of vasopressors , and those who required no catecholamine infusions .
analysis of the fourth quartile of distribution showed that it was composed of patients with worse postoperative outcomes .
patients who presented worse pulmonary performance ( ratio of partial arterial oxygen tension ( pao2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen ( fio2 ) less than 196 ) exhibited higher levels of mif three hours after cpb ( p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , mif 3 hours after cpb was inversely associated with pao2 / fio2 ratio ( p < 0.001 , rho = - 0.383 ) and was directly associated with the postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation ( p = 0.011 , rho = 0.265 ). with regard to renal function , patients in the fourth quartile exhibited creatinine levels higher than 1.1 mg / dl in association with higher levels ( p < 0.05 ) of mif , mcp - 1 , and il - 6 within the first 24 hours after cpb .
mif , il - 6 , and scd40l levels were not associated with hematological dysfunction .
however , patients with a platelet count lower than 133,000 / mm3 exhibited significantly higher levels of mcp - 1 at 3 , 6 , and 10 hours after cpb ( table 2 ) .
patients who presented minor postoperative neurological dysfunction , especially manifested as behavioral disturbances , had higher levels of mif and mcp - 1 production ( p < 0.05 ) .
discussion this study suggests that higher perioperative levels of mif and other inflammatory mediators could be related to specific postoperative organ dysfunction .
importantly , preoperative mif was directly associated with the intensity of global organ dysfunction measured by mods on the third day after surgery .
previous studies have associated sustained high levels of inflammatory markers with poor outcomes in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis [ 22 ] .
present data showed that circulating levels of mif , il - 6 , and mcp - 1 increased significantly in response to cardiovascular surgery with cpb , and that maximum levels of mif occurred before those of il - 6 and mcp - 1 .
several specific organ dysfunctions had correlations with cytokine production in different times .
first , a significant association between postoperative levels of mif and pulmonary dysfunction has been reported previously in a study including patients without previous organ dysfunction who were subjected to elective coronary artery bypass surgery [ 14 ] .
in contrast , the present study also included high - risk patients subjected to more complex cardiovascular surgery in elective and non - elective settings .
in this population , postoperative levels of mif - especially between three and six hours after cpb - were associated not only with pulmonary dysfunction but also with circulatory dysfunction and mods at the third day after surgery .
experimental models confirmed that mif is , in fact , implicated in lps - induced lung injury [ 22 ] .
second , postoperative neurological dysfunction was was slightly and rarely associated with postoperative circulating levels of mif .
the present study could not reproduce such an association between cytokine levels and major postoperative neurological complications , possibly because of the small population with postoperative stroke presented in this series .
however , minor postoperative neurological complications were associated with higher postoperative levels of mif and mcp - 1 .
third , postoperative levels of mif and il - 6 were higher in patients presenting postoperative vascular hypo - reactivity , requiring a high dose of vasopressors .
there is experimental evidence that mif is involved with the lps - induced upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase , with its consequent production of nitric oxide and vasodilation [ 23 ] .
fourth , mif can also be involved with lps - induced myocardial dysfunction , through gene transcription of il - 6 and tnf - alpha [ 24 ] .
this study was able to demonstrate an association between higher postoperative levels of mif and echocardiographically documented ventricular dysfunction ( data not shown ) , but failed to correlate mif levels with clinical outcomes such as pressure - adjusted heart rate and the need for inotropic agents .
fifth , as regards postoperative hematological dysfunction , mcp - 1 was the only marker to exhibit a consistent relation to postoperative low platelet counts in this study .
previous data indicated that contact with platelets or mesangial cells stimulates the production of mcp - 1 through the cd40 / cd40l pathway and may contribute to the inflammatory response [ 25 ] .
in the present study , levels of scd40l were not directly associated with platelet count but were negatively associated with mcp - 1 , which could reflect a higher conservation of cd40l on the membrane surface , and therefore would be more liable to intercellular stimulation .
some questions pertinent to this work could limit its interpretation .
the volume of priming solution can be seen as a limitation because of its hemodiluting effect .
this procedure could underestimate the early postoperative values of circulating levels of cytokines .
moreover , the lack of determination of the specific sources of cytokines could also interfere with its kinetics , especially considering the cardiopulmonary wash - out at the end of cpb .
in spite of these limitations , the main objectives were achieved .
another limitation was the high variability of preoperative levels of scd40l , which could be attributed to in vitro activation of platelets in a population with high - grade atherosclerotic disease ; this variation possibly jeopardized the reliable evaluation of perioperative kinetics of this marker and eventual associations between the circulating levels of this substance and postoperative outcomes .
last , the lack of a quantitative analysis of cd40l in cell surfaces would be a better way of clarifying scd40l kinetics .
it has recently been stated that the pattern of cellular reactivity might be implicated in postoperative organ dysfunction after cardiac surgery in newborns [ 26 ] .
in addition , the development of postoperative organ edema - and presumably dysfunction - after cbp surgery could be predicted preoperatively , suggesting that it develops in the background of a pre - existing immune activation [ 27 ] .
one might therefore speculate that the inflammatory milieu , especially reflected by circulating levels of mif , could render patients susceptibility to an increased inflammatory response [ 28 ] .
our results support these findings , suggesting that preoperative immune assessment , focusing especially on circulating levels of mif , might be associated with postoperative outcome .
despite of the multifactorial nature of specific or multiple organ dysfunctions , mif shall be explored as a potential therapeutic target in decreasing postoperative complications .
conclusion this study demonstrates that preoperative mif is consistently associated with multiple organ dysfunction after cardiovascular surgery with cpb .
the reproduction of these results in larger and different populations can contribute to the confirmation of its value as a preoperative risk stratification tool .
key messages * cardiopulmonary bypass provokes a systemic spread of inflammatory mediators , which may be related to postoperative organ dysfunction .
* preoperative circulating levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( mif ) , which is potentially involved in a sustained inflammatory response , may be associated with postoperative organ dysfunction .
* the reproduction of these results in a larger population might ratify that mif is a valuable tool in the prediction of postoperative outcome .

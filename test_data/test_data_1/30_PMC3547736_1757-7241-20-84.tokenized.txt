background although there are numerous supraglottic airway alternatives to endotracheal intubation , it remains unclear which airway technique is optimal for use in prehospital cardiac arrests .
we evaluated the use of the laryngeal tube ( lt ) as an airway management tool among adult out - of - hospital cardiac arrest ( ohca ) patients treated by our ambulance services in the haukeland and innlandet hospital districts .
methods post - resuscitation forms and data concerning airway management in 347 adult ohca victims were retrospectively assessed with regard to lt insertion success rates , ease and speed of insertion and insertion - related problems .
results a total of 402 insertions were performed on 347 ohca patients .
overall , lt insertion was successful in 85.3 % of the patients , with a 74.4 % first - attempt success rate .
in the minority of patients ( n = 46 , 13.3 %) , the lt insertion time exceeded 30 seconds .
insertion - related problems were recorded in 52.7 % of the patients .
lack of respiratory sounds on auscultation ( n = 100 , 28.8 %) , problematic initial tube positioning ( n = 85 , 24.5 %) , air leakage ( n = 61 , 17.6 %) , vomitus / aspiration ( n = 44 , 12.7 %) , and tube dislocation ( n = 17 , 4.9 %) were the most common problems reported .
insertion difficulty was graded and documented for 95.4 % of the patients , with the majority of insertions assessed as being " easy " ( 62.5 %) or " intermediate " ( 24.8 %) .
only 8.1 % of the insertions were considered to be " difficult " .
conclusions we found a high number of insertion related problems , indicating that supraglottic airway devices offering promising results in manikin studies may be less reliable in real - life resuscitations .
still , we consider the laryngeal tube to be an important alternative for airway management in prehospital cardiac arrest victims .
out - of - hospital cardiac arrest intubation airway management supraglottic airway device sga laryngeal tube lt lts ems background no studies have shown significant improved survival or outcome in out - of - hospital cardiac arrest ( ohca ) patients receiving prehospital intubation [ 1 - 6 ] .
the latest european resuscitation council ( erc ) guidelines ( 2010 ) reduce the emphasis on early endotracheal intubation ( eti ) unless this intervention can be achieved by highly skilled individuals with minimal interruption of chest compressions [ 1 ] .
numerous studies have described the adverse effects associated with prehospital endotracheal intubations performed by emergency medical technicians ( emts )/ paramedics due to intubation attempts [ 7 - 11 ] .
also , higher incidences of difficult airways , failed laryngoscopy and factors associated with increased difficulty in obtaining an airway have been reported in the prehospital setting [ 12 - 16 ] .
supraglottic airway devices ( sga ) have been increasingly and successfully used in resuscitation [ 1 ] .
the most commonly used being the classical laryngeal mask airway ( lma ) , the proseal lma , the laryngeal tube and recently the i - gel [ 17 - 19 ] .
several studies have shown that the sga 's are suitable alternatives for securing the airway , both in manikins during simulated cardiac arrest and in patients during anaesthesia ; however , only a few small cohort studies have described lt use in ohca patients [ 20 - 24 ] .
the lt is reported to be easy for inexperienced individuals and requires minimal instruction prior to first use [ 25 - 28 ] .
supraglottic airway devices have also shown low no - flow times and rapid airway control compared to eti or bag mask ventilation ( bmv ) in cardiac arrest scenarios [ 22,29 ] .
finally , the lt is reported to be promising as a rescue device after failed eti and in restricted patient access situations [ 25,30,31 ] .
there is limited evidence regarding the optimal airway technique during cardiac arrest or which level of competence is needed for individuals managing the patient 's airway .
the lt was introduced as our primary airway management tool during the initial phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) in haukeland and innlandet districts in 2002 / 2005 .
the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the lt in ohca victims treated by our ems .
methods study setting and design the study was designed as a dual - centre , retrospective evaluation of a single new airway device : the laryngeal tube .
the recruited centers comprise two of the national health trust regions , the haukeland university hospital region and the innlandet hospital region , covering a population of around 900 000 people and 70,000 km2 ( roughly half the size of england ) with approximately 75 ground ambulance units .
being a retrospective study , we did not have a formal written protocol establishing the sequence of actions using the lt in ohca .
however , both participating ambulance services have similar standard operating procedures ( sop ) for ohca , stating the sequence of actions to be taken in these situations .
the actual lt procedure with emphasis on minimising hands - off time during cpr , the lt was inserted directly without previous bmv , during on - going chest compressions .
successful attempt is defined as completed insertion of the lt combined with adequate ventilation of the patient assessed by inflation of the lungs , or visible chest movement , and confirmed by auscultation or capnography .
if the attempt is not successful within 30 seconds , the patient has to be ventilated / oxygenated with bmv or pocket mask before a new attempt can be made .
after a maximum of three lt attempts the method is abandoned , returning to bmv or pocket mask .
ems organization the norwegian ems is organised in an uniform way where the emergency medical communication centres ( emcc ) are accessed by a national three digit number ( 113 ) , from which the nearest ambulance and / or primary care doctors on - call are alarmed .
the emcc use the norwegian index of medical emergencies as a decision tool for level of emergency , and dispatch health resources accordingly [ 32,33 ] .
in pre - hospital cardiac arrests , the emcc provides telephone guided cpr to lay people if the patient is unconscious with abnormal breathing .
simultaneously , the nearest ambulance / primary care doctor on - call and first - responder with automated external defibrillator ( aed ) are dispatched to ensure advanced life support ( als ) .
if available , the nearest helicopter emergency medical service ( hems ) staffed by anesthesiologist may also be dispatched .
ambulance personnel education and training the ambulance system is part of the hospital organization , and all personnel are employed by the health trusts .
the educational background can vary , from basic emts ( emergency medical technicians ) , via paramedics to nurse anaesthetists working in the capacity of ambulance personnel in ems , and also anesthesiologist if the air ambulance service is responding to the actual ohca .
the term " anesthesia - trained providers " refers to nurse anaesthetists and anesthesiologists .
during basic training they are introduced to the lt during their airway management module , in addition to bag - mask - ventilation .
all ambulance personnel received an initial 3 hour lesson on airway management followed by supervised training on manikins with the lt. the training session was followed by a written and practical test in a manikin assessed by supervisors .
the ems personnel also had to take part in an annual formal retest , where lt use was tested in simulated cardiac arrest scenarios .
the laryngeal tube the lt is a sga and comes in single lumen ( lt + lt - d ) or dual lumen versions ( lts ii + lts - d with suction / drain tube ) , both available in reusable or disposable forms ( vbm medizintechnik gmbh , germany ) .
the lt has 2 cuffs inflated by one syringe , sealing both the oesophagus and the oropharynx , and with ventilation holes over the laryngeal inlet .
our ambulance services have used various laryngeal tube models ( lt / ltsii / lts - d ) in accordance with their enhancements , as their primary device for airway management in ohca patients since 2002 ( haukeland ) and 2005 ( innlandet ) .
suitable lt size was in each case chosen based on estimated patient height and according to product guidelines .
lt size 3 , 4 and 5 are used in adults .
data collection and subjects post - resuscitation forms and data on airway management in ohca patients were assessed with regard to lt insertion success rates , insertion time , insertion - related problems , and the ease of insertion .
347 adult non - traumatic out - of - hospital cardiac arrest patients in our 2 regions between 2002 - 2010 , where lt was used as airway method , were included in this study .
all cardiac arrest ambulance personnel were instructed to document the related airway data variables every time of involvement .
data variables included the choice of primary airway method ( mouth - mask - ventilation ( mmv ) , bag - mask - ventilation ( bmv ) , or laryngeal tube ( lt )) and verification of correct placement ( auscultation and end - tidal carbon dioxide measurement ) .
in addition all insertion - related problems like air leakage , problematic initial tube positioning , tube dislocation , absence of respiratory sounds on auscultation , insertion time exceeding 30 seconds , and provider - rated ease of insertion (" easy " , " intermediate " or " difficult ") were recorded .
a provider self - reporting method was used and in our study this covered his / hers perception of the procedure difficulty as a whole , from insertion attempt to confirmation of ventilation .
end tidal carbon dioxide ( etco2 ) measurements were performed using the easy cap ii co2 detector ( r ) ( covidien , usa ) or were available on the lifepak ( r ) 12 defibrillator ( physio - control inc. , usa ) .
data analysis microsoft excel 2011 for mac version 14.0 ( r ) ( microsoft corporation , usa ) and spss version 19.0 ( r ) ( ibm spss inc. , usa ) were used for data analysis and presentation .
ethics the regional committee for medical research ethics ( rek - vest ) exempted the study from ethical approval , regarding it as a quality improvement study .
the ethics committee declared no objections toward the study or the publication of the results .
the data protection official for research ( helse bergen ) approved the study .
permission was only given for anonymous data review , and the post - resuscitation forms and data from airway management were anonymous to personal data .
as such , outcome data and demographics from ems or in - hospital patient medical records could not be obtained .
results lt insertion success rates a total of 402 insertions were performed in 347 ohca patients .
overall , lt insertion was successful in 85.3 % of patients , with a 74.4 % first - attempt success rate .
insertion success is shown in figure 1 .
in the 89 patients ( 25.6 %) where primary insertion attempt failed , the reattempt airway device used was either the lt ( 42.7 %) , eti ( 20.2 %) , bmv ( 6.7 %) , or a combination of the three ( 6.7 %) .
data reporting rescue airway technique in 21 of the primary failed insertions was missing .
in 2.4 % of the successful insertions , the lt was converted to eti by anesthesia - trained providers during the resuscitation .
figure 1 insertion success in 347 patients .
insertion time in a minority of patients ( n = 46 , 13.3 %) , the lt insertion time exceeded 30 seconds .
the mean number of insertion attempts was 1.16 ( range 1 - 4 ) .
insertion time exceeding 30 seconds was a result of difficult single insertions ( n = 15 ) or multiple insertion attempts ( n = 31 ) .
insertion - related problems insertion - related problems were recorded in 52.7 % of patients , as shown in table 1 .

the primary methods used to verify correct placement were auscultation ( n = 252 , 72.6 %) and etco2 confirmation ( n = 213 , 61.4 %) .
the mean age of patients was 66.8 years ( sd +/ - 16.4 years ) .
ease of insertion the difficulty of insertion was scored for 95.4 % of the patients , with the majority of insertions being assessed as " easy " ( 62.5 %) or " intermediate " ( 24.8 %) by the airway providers .
only 8.1 % of the insertions were regarded as " difficult " .
discussion our data suggest that ambulance emts / paramedics in our ems insert the laryngeal tube with acceptable success rates in adult out - of - hospital cardiac arrest patients compared to others [ 23,34 ] .
we consider the laryngeal tube to be an important supraglottic alternative for airway management in prehospital cardiac arrest victims treated by emts / paramedics .
endotracheal intubation has traditionally been regarded as the optimal method for securing the airway during cardiac arrest [ 1 ] .
however , as shown by wang et al , emt and paramedic manned ems have demonstrated low eti success rates of between 72 - 82 % across several patient categories , including ohca as well as intubation - associated cpr interruptions [ 11,35 ] .
the ontario prehospital advanced life support study ( opals ) found no improvement in ohca survival after adding advanced life support ( als ) interventions to an emergency medical services ( ems ) protocol with rapid defibrillation [ 36 ] .
also , a recent cochrane review stated that prehospital intubation in non - traumatic cardiac arrest patients is less likely to benefit patients than early defibrillation and bystander cpr [ 6 ] .
several studies report sga insertion success rates as being relatively independent of the rescuers' competence levels ( i.e. , inexperienced providers can establish an airway as quickly and effectively as more experienced rescuers after simple airway management training ) and that inexperienced providers may establish airways faster and more efficiently with sgas ( e.g. , lt compared with eti or bmv ) [ 20,29,37 ] .
however , in our study we found sga insertion success rates between 74 - 85 % , similar to that described for first - responders and comparable ems - services in other countries , but also not much better than the eti success rates described by wang et al [ 20,34,35 ] .
also , as rescue device after failed primary insertions , renewed attempts with the lt were successful in only half of the cases in our study .
according to our sop , the lt was inserted directly without previous bmv , during on - going chest compressions .
reduced no - flow times using the lt , as shown by wiese et al , did not apply to our study [ 22 ] .
after a patent airway is established , the hands - off time is independent of the actual airway device chosen .
the majority of lt insertions were completed within 30 seconds , and fast insertion times have also been showed by other authors , e.g lanimaki et al and kurola et al [ 20,34 ] .
our study showed a relatively high number of insertion - related problems using the lt in ohca , and to our knowledge these complications have not been described elsewhere .
among the problems described ( table 1 ) , problematic initial tube positioning , leakage , vomit / aspiration and tube dislocation may impede effective ventilation and oxygenation of the patients .
these problems were encountered in over 50 % of our patients which seems high , but some of these may be of less importance .
lack of respiratory sounds ( 28,8 %) on auscultation does not necessarily mean ineffective ventilation if chest movement is observed .
how experienced the participants were in the auscultation technique , combined with a noisy prehospital environment , may influence these results in a synchronous ventilation and chest compression scenario .
endotracheal intubation requires more extensive training than most emts / paramedics receive to obtain adequate skill levels , and the basic bag - mask - ventilation technique used by most ems personnel may be difficult to perform correctly [ 8,24,38 - 41 ] .
in earlier studies , the feasibility of establishing airway and ventilation with sga 's has been demonstrated , and sga 's may be associated with better skill retention compared with eti [ 24,25,34 ] .
our data indicate that devices offering promising results in manikin studies may be less reliable in real - life resuscitations .
we suggest that even the seemingly better and simpler airway solutions may demand better airway training programmes in the future , along with engineering advances in supraglottic devices .
the majority of insertions in our study were rated as easy or intermediate , with only 8,1 % rated as difficult .
similar self - reporting has been used in other studies [ 34 ] .
however , the self reporting of airway management difficulty was in contrast to the amount of insertion related problems experienced , and we believe this may be due to unreliability in self - reporting and the level of provider competence in our study .
the limitations of our study include its retrospective methodology and the evaluation of a single airway device .
limitations in data completeness and compliance issues have also been noted in other reviews of ems patient records , and retrospective chart reviews can miss critical events , e.g. , misplaced tubes due to observation bias and underreporting [ 42 ] .
also , there are no golden standards for measuring procedural difficulties in healthcare , and provider self - reporting may be prone to bias .
furthermore , our study includes only a limited series of adult ohca victims ; thus , the results may not be generalisable to other patients .
nevertheless , being a dual - centre study and among the first to evaluate the performance of emts / paramedics with the lt in nearly 350 ohca patients , we believe that our study offers new information regarding airway management in these patients ; e.g. the insertion related problems recorded .
future studies comparing advanced versus basic airway techniques in adult and paediatric cardiac arrest victims are needed , and the continued development of improved supraglottic devices for ems use are encouraged .
conclusions our study suggests that ambulance emergency medical technicians ( emts ) and paramedics in norwegian emergency medical services ( emss ) insert laryngeal tubes with acceptable success rates in adult ocha victims .
we found a relative high number of insertion related problems , indicating that supraglottic devices offering promising results in manikin studies may be less reliable in real - life resuscitations .
still , we consider the laryngeal tube to be an important alternative for airway management in prehospital cardiac arrest victims .

methods adult inpatients (>= 16 years ) with lab confirmed influenza were enrolled .
variables collected included icu admissions and death attributed to influenza assessed 30 days after initial diagnosis .
results results thirty - seven hospitals submitted data on 701 cases .
the median age of was 49 years ( range 16 - 94 ) .
vaccine history was available for 314 cases , and 21 % ( n = 65 ) reported receiving vaccine .
oseltamivir was given to 90 % of the cases a median of 3 days after symptom onset ( range 0 - 24 ) .
influenza - associated admission to icu was required for 28 % ( n = 197 ) .
the 30 day all - cause mortality was 7 % ; influenza was the primary cause of 20 deaths and contributed to death in a further 22 cases for an influenza - attributed mortality of 6 % .
the mean age at death was 50 years ( sd 13.8 ) .
conclusion the icu admission rate and influenza - attributed mortality were similar to three preceding influenza years , but mean age at death was significantly younger ( p < 0.01 ) .
antivirals were prescribed for more patients with influenza ( 90 %) than in previous seasons ( 35 - 47 %) .
the ph1n1 virus appeared outside the traditional influenza season and impacted a different age group than seasonal viruses circulating in previous years , highlighting the importance of ongoing influenza surveillance .

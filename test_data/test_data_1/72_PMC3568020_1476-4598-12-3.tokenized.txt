background one key step in the development of prostate cancer ( pca ) metastasis is the loss of e - cadherin expression associated with increased cellular motility and tumor invasion .
this loss of e - cadherin expression is also required during normal embryogenesis and similar transcriptional repressors have been identified in both processes .
we have previously reported the presence of one such transcription factor , wt1 in high gleason grade prostate tumor tissues , and its absence in non - neoplastic or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues .
results to better understand the effect of wt1 on e - cadherin expression and migration of pca cells we quantified wt1 and e - cadherin mrna levels in normal prostate epithelial and pca cell lines with varying migratory potential .
in wt1 transfected cells e - cadherin transcript levels were decreased , while they were increased in siwt1 - rna transfected pca cells , suggesting that elevated wt1 expression was sufficient to dampen e - cadherin levels and potentially enhance migratory ability .
to delineate the mechanism of wt1 - mediated repression of e - cadherin , potential wt1 binding sites were tested in vitro and in vivo binding of wt1 to the e - cadherin promoter in the chromatin of lncap and pc3 cells was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation .
the effect of wt1 binding was measured in reporter assays ; in pc3 and du145 cells wt1 decreased the activity of the proximal e - cadherin promoter .
using site - directed mutagenesis , a newly identified wt1 binding site located 146 bp from the transcription start site was shown to be required for this repression by wt1 .
transwell migration and wound healing assays revealed that in lncap cells with low migratory potential , over - expression of wt1 was sufficient to enhance migration , conversely , in the highly migratory pc3 cells silencing of wt1 decreased migration .
conclusions these findings suggested that wt1 expression in high grade prostate cancer may contribute to migration and metastasis .
thus , in prostate cancer wt1 may function as a novel oncogene facilitating development of the lethal metastatic phenotype .
wt1 e - cadherin prostate cancer migration metastasis background prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the usa [ 1 ] .
although patients with localized prostate cancer have high survival and relative low mortality rate , patients with detectable metastases have median survival of 12 - 15 months , suggesting that metastatic process is the main cause of high mortality among pca patients [ 2 ] .
the loss of cell adhesion is a crucial step in the process of metastasis and a critical early event is the conversion of the stationary to the migratory phenotype [ 3 ] .
when cancer cells acquire motility and invasiveness , they undergo drastic changes in their structure : lose epithelial features , such as adhesion , and acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype .
this modification of cancer cells is known as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ 4,5 ] and the loss of cell - cell interaction is caused by suppression of cell adhesion molecules such as e - cadherin , normally expressed by epithelial cells .
loss or down regulation of e - cadherin expression is associated with an increase in the migration and invasiveness of many types cancer cells [ 6 ] including prostate [ 7 - 10 ] .
down regulation of e - cadherin has been reported to occur via hypermethylation [ 11,12 ] , mutations [ 13 ] and transcription factors such as snail [ 14,15 ] , slug [ 16 ] , zeb - 1 and zeb - 2 ( sip - 1 ) [ 17 ] and the bhlh family of factors e12 / e47 and twist [ 18,19 ] .
e - cadherin has also been shown to be regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor wt1 in nih3t3 fibroblasts [ 20 ] and in cardiac epithelial cells undergoing emt , wt1 represses e - cadherin expression both directly and indirectly by the upregulation of the repressor snail [ 21 ] .
although multiple isoforms of wt1 have been identified , those that regulate transcription lack a tripeptide ( kts ) insertion in exon 9 [ 22 ] .
our study focuses on identifying the function of the transcriptionally active isoform lacking both exon 5 and kts in prostate cancer cells .
wt1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor based on its mutational inactivation in wilms' tumors of the kidney [ 23 ] .
in contrast , in other tumor types , wt1 levels are elevated , suggesting an oncogenic role [ 24 - 30 ] .
in pca , it has been reported that wt1 is a marker of human pca progression [ 29 ] , and that wt1 is primarily expressed in high gleason grade pca epithelial cells [ 30 ] .
however the relationship of wt1 to e - cadherin expression in pca has not been characterized .
here we tested the effect of wt1 on endogenous e - cadherin mrna levels by both silencing and overexpressing wt1 .
potential wt1 binding sites in the e - cadherin promoter were characterized using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) and site - directed mutagenesis .
the biological impact of wt1 - mediated repression of e - cadherin was tested by migration and wound healing assays in pca cells with varying migratory potential .
overall , this study was designed to determine whether wt1 transcriptionally regulated e - cadherin and thereby , migration of pca cells .
results transcriptional repression of e - cadherin is mediated through a novel wt1 binding site in the e - cadherin proximal promoter previous studies in our lab demonstrated differences in wt1 mrna levels between normal prostate epithelial ( rwpe - 1 ) and pca cell lines [ 30 ] and others have reported that e - cadherin protein levels were higher in lncap than pc3 [ 31 ] .
thus , we analyzed whether wt1 and e - cadherin mrna levels were inversely related in these cell lines .
quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) was performed to measure the levels of wt1 and e - cadherin mrna in these pca cell lines .
as expected , we found that wt1 ( figure 1a ) and e - cadherin ( figure 1b ) mrna levels were inversely related .
this inverse relationship is consistent with reports of others that wt1 is a regulator of e - cadherin in nih 3t3 [ 20 ] and epicardial cells [ 21 ] .
to determine whether wt1 is a regulator of e - cadherin gene expression in lncap and pc3 pca cells , we transfected the cells with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression vector and measured the effect of wt1 overexpression by taqman qrt - pcr as described below .
our results showed that gfp / wt1 transfection reduced e - cadherin mrna levels 2 - fold in lncap ( figure 1c ) and 1.7 - fold in pc3 ( figure 1d ) cells compared with pcmv4 transfected cells .
these results were reproduced thrice and consistently showed that increased wt1 expression (>= 10 - fold ) is sufficient to repress e - cadherin mrna levels .
to determine the effect of decreased wt1 levels on e - cadherin regulation , we transfected lncap and pc3 cells with scrambled ( risc ) or targeted siwt1 rna oligonucleotides ( dharmacon ) or no rna ( mock ) .
the levels of wt1 and e - cadherin mrna were measured using taqman qrt - pcr .
transfection with siwt1 rna oligonucleotide # 7 ( dharmacon ) reduced wt1 mrna levels by 88 % in pc3 and 81 % in lncap cells ( data not shown ) .
the suppression of wt1 expression increased the levels of e - cadherin mrna 5 - fold in siwt1 rna oligonucleotide transfected lncap ( figure 1e ) , and 2 - fold in pc3 cells ( figure 1f ) cells compared to the scramble oligonucleotides ( risc ) .
these results were reproduced in three independent experiments with similar findings .
additionally , results with oligonucleotide # 7 ( dharmacon ) were confirmed using a differently targeted siwt1 rna oligonucleotide , # 8 ( dharmacon ) that also similarly decreased wt1 mrna levels by 81 % and increased e - cadherin mrna levels in pc3 cells by 1.9 - fold ( data not shown ) .
surprisingly wt1 protein levels were less strongly affected by sirna oligonucleotides and thus e - cadherin protein levels were only modestly increased ( data not shown ) .
overall , these results showed that e - cadherin transcript levels were inversely affected by wt1 over - expression and siwt1 rna knock - down in these two pca cell lines .

experiments were done in triplicate and reproduced twice .

( c and d ) e - cadherin mrna expression levels in lncap ( c ) and pc3 ( d ) pca cells transfected with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression construct were measured using taqman qrt - pcr .
values were normalized as described in ( a and b ) .
data are presented relative to pcmv4 transfected cells .
experiments were done in triplicate and reproduced three times .
student t - test was performed and significance was determined by comparing pcmv4 to gfp / wt1 transfected cells (* p <= 0.05 ) .

data are presented relative to risc transfected cells .
significance was determined by student t - test comparing risc to siwt1 rna oligonucleotides transfected cells (* p <= 0.05 , ** p <= 0.01 ) in three independent experiments .
to determine how wt1 might regulate e - cadherin expression we identified potential wt1 binding sites in the e - cadherin promoter , using the matinspector software .
we identified two potential wt1 binding sites at - 15 and - 146 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( figure 2a ) .
a third wt1 binding site at - 51 bp was previously reported functional in fibroblasts [ 20 ] but not identified by the matinspector software ( figure 2a ) .
moreover , two potential egr - 1 binding sites at - 15 and - 55 and two potential twist binding sites at - 37 and - 87 bp upstream from the start site were predicted by the same software .
additionally , other binding sites in the e - cadherin promoter for transcription factors such as snail have been reported [ 32 ] .
the two predicted egr - 1 binding sites overlap with wt1 sites at - 15 and - 51bp as do two sp1 binding sites previously reported at - 51 and - 146 bp [ 32 ] .
multiple overlapping wt1 , egr - 1 and sp1 binding sites were predicted in promoter regions of genes expressed in pca epithelial cells [ 33 ] .
our previous bioinformatics studies also identified an evolutionarily conserved region containing a potential overlapping wt1 and egr - 1 binding site in the e - cadherin promoter [ 33 ] .
to test whether the region of the e - cadherin promoter containing wt1 sites was functional in pca cells , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) was performed .
lncap and pc3 cells were transfected with the pgfp / wt1 expression construct [ 34 ] to increase the levels of - kts isoform and enhance potential binding to the native chromatin of lncap and pc3 cells .
chromatin of pc3 ( figure 2b ) and lncap ( figure 2d ) cells was immunoprecipitated with anti - wt1 antibodies and amplified by endpoint pcr using primers ( figure 2a ) designed to flank the regulatory region of the e - cadherin gene containing three wt1 potential binding sites .
additionally sybergreen ( agilent , la jolla , ca ) quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) analysis of the e - cadherin promoter region was performed to validate and quantify representative samples of immunoprecipitated chromatin from pc3 ( figure 2c ) and lncap ( figure 2e ) cells .
additional chromatin preparations from both cell lines were also analyzed for confirmation of binding initially using the endpoint pcr method and then validating by qrt - pcr with similar results ( data not shown ) .
specificity of wt1 binding was assessed by endpoint pcr using primers that flanked a region lacking potential wt1 binding sites , located ~ 1kb upstream of the transcriptional start site ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
these results demonstrate specific in vivo dna binding by wt1 , a prerequisite for wt1 mediated regulation of the e - cadherin gene expression in pca cells .

chip assays were performed with chromatin from pc3 ( b ) and lncap ( d ) cells .
cells were transfected with gfp / wt1 construct and harvested after 48 hours .
chromatin was crosslinked and then immunoprecipitated with either igg ( negative control ) , wt1 ( b , d ) or sp1 ( positive control ) ( d ) antibody .
input or immunoprecipitated dna was amplified by endpoint pcr , as described in methods , using primers that amplify a 210 bp region of the e - cadherin proximal promoter .
( b and d ) amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and representative images are shown .
( c and e ) sybergreen qrt - pcr was performed to quantify the wt1 immunoprecipitated dna from pc3 ( c ) or lncap ( e ) cells .
experiments were reproduced twice with different chromatin preparations and representative qrtpcr results are shown as fold enrichment compared to igg .
to determine whether wt1 transcriptionally regulates e - cadherin promoter activity , a reporter construct containing the region 403 bp upstream of the e - cadherin transcription start site was cloned from genomic dna , as described in methods .
to analyze the effect of overexpression of wt1 on the e - cadherin proximal promoter , the e - cadherin reporter construct ( figure 3a ) was co - transfected along with increasing doses of gfp / wt1 expression construct in pc3 cells and luciferase activity was measured as described in methods .
as shown in figure 3b , wt1 repressed the e - cadherin proximal promoter in a dose dependent manner , with 500 ng of gfp / wt1 achieving a greater than 50 % reduction of the promoter activity .
these results together with gene expression studies , suggested that wt1 mediated repression of e - cadherin could maintain low levels of expression of e - cadherin in pca cells .
to confirm the effect of wt1 overexpression on the e - cadherin proximal promoter , the reporter construct was transiently co - transfected along with gfp / wt1 expression construct in both pc3 ( figure 3c ) and du145 ( figure 3d ) cells and luciferase activities were measured .
as shown in figure 3c and 3d , wt1 repressed the activity of the proximal - 403 bp e - cadherin promoter by 5 - fold in pc3 cells and 2 - fold in du145 cells .
these results confirmed that wt1 regulated the activity of the e - cadherin proximal promoter at the transcriptional level , but did not locate the specific wt1 binding sites involved .

( a ) schematic diagram of the e - cadherin proximal promoter with 3 potential wt1 binding sites .
( b ) effect of wt1 on e - cadherin promoter was tested in a dose response in pc3 cells .
250 ng of the e - cadherin proximal promoter reporter construct was cotransfected either with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression construct at 0 , 250 , 500 and 750 ng concentrations .
dna concentrations were held constant by adding increasing amounts of pcmv4 and reporter activity analyzed as described in methods .
( c and d ) e - cadherin proximal promoter reporter construct was cotransfected either with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression construct in pc3 ( c ) and du145 ( d ) cells .
luciferase activity was measured and normalized to protein concentration .
data are reported relative to luciferase activity of pcmv4 transfected cells .
experiments were repeated three times in triplicate .
significance was determined by student 's t - test comparing gfp / wt1 transfected cells to pcmv4 transfected (* p <= 0.05 , *** p <= 0.001 ) .
since three potential wt1 binding sites were identified in the e - cadherin promoter , it was necessary to determine which one mediated the decreased activity of the e - cadherin promoter .
to determine whether the wt1 binding site at - 146bp was responsible for the e - cadherin promoter repression , site directed mutagenesis was performed on the - 403 proximal promoter ( figure 4a ) , as described in methods , using primers containing the altered sequence ( table 1 ) .
cotransfection assays of the proximal promoter construct with the mutated - 146 site , showed that mutation of the wt1 binding site at - 146 bp , eliminated the gfp / wt1 mediated repression of the e - cadherin promoter activity in pc3 cells ( figure 4b ) .
these results were confirmed in another pca cell line , du145 , ( figure 4c ) and showed that the - 146 bp wt1 binding site was required for the repression of the proximal e - cadherin promoter by wt1 .
to determine whether the additional wt1 binding sites located within the g - rich core promoter might also contribute to wt1 mediated repression of the e - cadherin promoter , site - directed mutagenesis was performed as described above .
primers containing the altered sequences for either the - 15 or - 51 bp wt1 binding sites ( figure 4d ) were designed ( table 1 ) .
the mutant core promoter constructs were transiently cotransfected along with gfp / wt1 expression construct and luciferase activity was measured .
despite mutation at either the - 15 bp or the - 51bp wt1 binding sites in the - 108 e - cadherin core promoter construct , co - transfection with gfp / wt1 construct , fully repressed the e - cadherin promoter activity ( figure 4e ) .
these results showed that neither of these two wt1 binding sites in the core promoter were required for repression of the e - cadherin promoter by wt1 .
taken together , these results suggest that the wt1 binding sites in the core promoter do not contribute to the repression of e - cadherin promoter activity by wt1 , rather , the - 146 bp site in the proximal promoter mediates e - cadherin expression in pca cells .

data are reported relative to luciferase activity of pcmv4 .
significance was determined by student 's t - test comparing gfp / wt1 transfected cells relative to pcmv4 transfected cells (*** p <= 0.001 ) in three independent experiments .

wt1 alters migration of pca cells having identified the wt1 site that mediated the repression of e - cadherin , a cell adhesion molecule involved in migration , it was necessary to test the effect of wt1 on cell migration .
silencing of wt1 expression has been shown to inhibit migration of human umbilical vascular endothelial ( huvecs ) cells [ 35 ] .
since knock - down of wt1 increased e - cadherin mrna levels in pca cells ( figure 1e and 1f ) , and e - cadherin is lost during emt when cells increase their migratory potential , we tested the affect of wt1 on cell migration .
a wound - healing assay was carried out in pc3 cells transfected with either risc or siwt1 rna oligonucleotides or mock transfected .
the confluent monolayer was scratched 72 hours after transfection and cells were allowed to migrate for 16 hours .
six pictures were taken at 0 and 16 hours after transfection ( figure 5a ) and images analyzed by t - scratch software [ 39 ] to determine the percentage of wound remaining open at 16 hours compared to 0 hour .
the results were reproduced twice and showed that siwt1 rna oligonucleotides decreased the migration of pc3 cells 4.4 - fold compared to risc control transfection ( figure 5b ) .
representative samples of risc control or siwt1 rna transfected cells were analyzed by qrt - pcr and e - cadherin mrna levels were increased by 1.9 - fold when wt1 was knocked down by 83 % ( data not shown ) .
elevated e - cadherin expression in siwt1 rna transfected cells was consistent with the reduced migration observed .
figure 5 wt1 affects pca cell migration .
( a ) a wound healing assay was performed after transfection with siwt1 rna or risc oligonucleotides or mock in pc3 cells .
migration potential was measured as described in methods .
monolayers were examined with an olympus 1 x 70 microscope at 100x magnification and photographed at 0 and 16 hours after wounding .
representative images are shown and the bar represents 100 mum .
( b ) six images per treatment were measured and analyzed by tscratch software ( 39 ) comparing open area at 16 hours to that at 0 hours .
values are presented as percent of open area of monolayers remaining at 16 hours compared to 0 hours and significance was determined by student t - test (** p <= 0.01 ,*** p <= 0.001 ) in two independent experiments .
( c ) pc3 cells were transfected as described in ( a ) and placed in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 6 hours as described in methods .
representative images of hematoxylin stained membranes containing migratory cells are shown at 100x magnification .
( d ) migratory cells were counted in six images per treatment and data are presented as average number of migratory cells per chamber .
( e ) lncap cells were transfected with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression construct as described in figure 1 .
transfected cells were placed in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 48 hours as described in methods .
( f ) data are presented as per panel d and significance was determined by student t - test (** p <= 0.01 ,*** p <= 0.001 ) comparing siwt1 rna transfected relative to risc transfected pc3 cells ( d ) and gfp / wt1 transfected relative to pcmv4 transfected lncap cells ( f ) in two independent experiments .
to validate the wound healing assay results , pc3 cells were transfected with siwt1 rna or risc oligonucleotides or mock transfected , and after 72 hours , cells were harvested for a transwell migration assay .
cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hours , then six images of stained inserts were taken ( figure 5c ) and numbers of cells that had migrated through the insert pores were counted .
results showed that silencing wt1 decreased the average number of migrating pc3 cells by 50 % , compared with risc transfected , and by 60 % compared with mock ( figure 5d ) .
representative samples were analyzed by qrt - pcr and e - cadherin mrna levels were increased by two - fold when wt1 was knocked down by 88 % ( data not shown ) .
since siwt1 rna decreased the migration of pc3 cells , we asked whether the converse , overexpression of wt1 , would increase migration of lncap cells .
lncap cells were transfected with pcmv4 or gfp / wt1 expression vectors and after 48 hours , cells were harvested for transwell migration assay as described .
cells were allowed to migrate for 48 hours before inserts were removed , processed and six photographs taken ( figure 5e ) to calculate averages for pcmv4 transfected or gfp / wt1 transfected lncap cells ( figure 5f ) .
the results showed that overexpression of wt1 increased migration of lncap by 3 - fold compared with pcmv4 transfected lncap cells .
these results suggested that wt1 expression was required for the high migratory potential of pc3 cells and loss of wt1 dampened cell migration .
conversely , increased expression of wt1 was sufficient to enhance the low migratory potential of lncap cells .
overall these findings link wt1 's role in repression of e - cadherin expression to suppression of cell - cell adhesion and increased migratory potential .
evidence that wt1 mediated repression by binding the e - cadherin promoter in vivo and transcriptionally regulated the proximal promoter in vitro supports the importance of wt1 in pca cell migration .
thus , overexpression of wt1 both suppresses expression of the adhesion molecule , e - cadherin , and enhances cell migration .
discussion in the present study we have provided evidence in support of wt1 transcriptionally repressing e - cadherin in pca cells .
first , we observed an inverse relationship of wt1 and e - cadherin mrna levels in pc3 and lncap cells .
secondly , overexpression of wt1 decreased e - cadherin mrna levels ; and suppression of wt1 expression increased e - cadherin mrna levels .
the titration of wt1 levels by transfection altered both e - cadherin expression and the ability of these cells to migrate .
overexpression of wt1 - kts isoform , and not other wt1 isoforms , has also been proven to increase migration and invasion in human ovarian cancer cells [ 36 ] .
finally , the mechanism whereby wt1 was able to repress e - cadherin promoter activity in pca cell lines was examined .
we identified two new potentialwt1 binding sites in the e - cadherin promoter and found that wt1 bound to the e - cadherin promoter in chromatin of both pc3 and lncap cells in vivo .
specifically , we examined a 220 bp region predicted to have three wt1 binding sites .
although the wt1 binding sites were too closely spaced to resolve single site binding , using site - directed mutagenesis we demonstrated the requirement of the newly identified - 146 bp wt1 binding site for the repression of the proximal e - cadherin promoter .
overall , our study shows that wt1 is sufficient to regulate e - cadherin mrna levels , and our knock - down results demonstrate the necessity of wt1 for regulated e - cadherin expression in pca cells .
importantly , the biological effect of wt1 mediated changes in e - cadherin levels in these prostate cancer cells lines was altered migration , a key step in metastasis .
one of the hallmarks of cancer is the ability to invade and metastasize [ 37 ] , traits that require the emt process and e - cadherin is one of the most important epithelial markers lost in emt .
in the present study , we have shown higher e - cadherin mrna levels in lncap cells compared to pc3 cells , and this is similar to reported levels of e - cadherin protein expression in the same cell lines [ 31 ] .
in contrast to e - cadherin levels , our results showed that wt1 mrna levels are higher in pc3 compared to lncap cells .
thus , the inverse relationship between wt1 and e - cadherin in lncap and pc3 cells lines is consistent with the differences in the aggressive phenotype between these two cell lines [ 38 ] .
our evidence that wt1 transcriptionally repressed e - cadherin in pca cells , led us to examine the functional role of wt1 in migration of pca cells .
our findings that overexpression of wt1 in lncap cells increased their migration potential , is in agreement with those reported in an ovarian cancer cell line [ 36 ] where the constitutive expression of the wt1 a isoform promoted cell migration and invasion .
however , that study was focused on the effect of wt1 on the cell cytoskeleton , not on cell adhesion molecules such as e - cadherin .
migration is dependent upon disruption of cams including integrins , selectins , members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and cadherins. through their interactions with catenins , cadherins form a junctional complex with cytoskeletal structures such as f - actin .
thus , wt1 may affect migration by regulating components of the junctional complex .
not only did we find that wt1 over - expression was sufficient to increase migration of lncap cells , but inhibition of wt1 expression significantly reduced motility of highly migratory pc3 cells .
these results showing that suppression of wt1 by siwt1 rna oligonucleotide transfection reduced migration of pc3 cells in transwell migration assays , were confirmed by a wound - healing assay using the same siwt1 rna .
this is in agreement with another study showing that silencing of wt1 [ 35 ] in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( huvecs ) inhibited cell migration .
however , in huvecs it appeared that wt1 regulated the ets - 1 ( e - twenty six ) gene , a transcription factor involved in angiogenesis and invasion .
thus our results in pca cells suggested a different mechanism whereby wt1 enhanced migration directly through its effect on e - cadherin transcription .
this is the first report to show that wt1 alters migration of pca cells while regulating one of the most important molecules involved in the emt process , e - cadherin .
taken together , overexpression and silencing of wt1 significantly affected pca cell migration , supporting our hypothesis that wt1 could behave as an oncogene and promote the process of pca metastasis .
the mechanism whereby wt1 enhances migration is most likely mediated through transcriptional repression of e - cadherin .
wt1 mediated regulation of e - cadherin had been previously described [ 20,21 ] .
in the study done in murine fibroblasts , wt1 mediated upregulation of e - cadherin in the murine and human e - cadherin promoter [ 20 ] .
in contrast , our results showed wt1 mediated downregulation of e - cadherin human promoter .
this discrepancy could be explained by cell specificity since their study was done in normal murine fibroblast cells , while we used human epithelial cancer cells , which differ in their expression of cadherins .
in agreement with our findings , martinez - estrada et al .
[ 21 ] has shown downregulation of e - cadherin mrna and promoter activity in murine cardiac epithelial cells overexpressing wt1 .
however , they also showed that wt1 mediated indirect downregulation of e - cadherin through the repressor snail , which we did not find in pca cells , possibly reflecting differences between normal murine cardiac epithelial cells vs human pca epithelial cells .
moreover , repression of e - cadherin in cardiac epithelial cells was mediated via the core promoter ( at - 51bp wt1 binding site ) .
in contrast , our results showed that e - cadherin regulation was mediated through the proximal promoter containing the newly identified wt1 binding site located at - 146 bp upstream from the transcription start site .
we have shown that wt1 repressed activity of the e - cadherin proximal promoter in both pc3 and du145 cells , and mutation of the - 146 bp wt1 binding site prevented this repression , while mutation of sites in the core promoter had no effect .
taken together , these results suggest that the wt1 binding sites in the core promoter do not contribute to the repression of e - cadherin promoter activity by wt1 , rather , the - 146 bp site in the proximal promoter is essential for wt1 mediated e - cadherin repression in pca cells .
this is the first report of the newly identified functional wt1 binding site responsible for e - cadherin transcriptional repression and the first demonstrating the effect of wt1 on migration of pca cells .
although wt1 repressed expression of e - cadherin , a gene that must be suppressed prior to cancer cell migration and is lost during emt , it is not clear to what extent wt1 contributes to emt or metastasis of prostate cancer cells .
certainly elevated wt1 expression in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate and bph is consistent with its role as a regulator of key steps in emt and migration .
other reports demonstrating a role for wt1 in emt during epicardial development suggest that its reactivation in prostate cancer epithelial cells may also be associated with emt in cancer .
thus , wt1 appears to be linked to emt , migration and possibly metastasis of prostate cancer cells .
since metastasis is a very complicated process that is still poorly understood , further studies are needed to determine how wt1 is involved in emt and metastatic processes of pca cells .
conclusions we have shown that wt1 bound the e - cadherin promoter in vivo ; wt1 overexpression decreased , and wt1 silencing increased , e - cadherin mrna levels .
moreover wt1 decreased e - cadherin promoter activity and the - 146 bp binding site was required for this decrease .
importantly , increased wt1 expression enhanced migration of lncap cells and silencing wt1 decreased migration of pc3 cells .
thus , we conclude that wt1 both regulates e - cadherin levels and contributes to the migratory potential of prostate cancer cells .
these data are consistent with an oncogenic function for wt1 , enhancing migration and metastasis of prostate cancer cells .

migration assay pc3 cells were transfected with either risc or siwt1 rna oligonucleotides or mock as described above .
lncap cells were transfected with either pcmv4 empty vector or gfp / wt1 expression construct as described above .
after 72 hours ( pc3 cells ) or 48 hours ( lncap cells ) of incubation , migration assays were performed using thincerts migration inserts with 8mum pore size ( bioexpress , kaysville , ut ) .
briefly , 2 x 105 transfected cells in serum free media were added to the top chamber of the insert , while the bottom chamber contained media with 10 % fbs providing the chemoattractant signal .
the cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hours ( pc3 cells ) or 48 hours ( lncap cells ) , then inserts were removed and the remaining non - migrating cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab .
the cells that migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and stained with harris hematoxylin solution ( sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo ) .
after washing , the membrane was peeled off the plastic inserts , placed on glass microscope slides and mounted using histochoice mountaing media ( amresco , solon , oh ) .
migrating cells were examined by microscopy at 200x magnification with olympus 1 x 70 microscope ( center valley , pa ) , then pictures were taken of six different randomly selected fields and migrating cells were counted manually .
the average number of migratory cells for each transfection condition was calculated .
t - test was used to determine significance .
migration assays in both cell lines were reproduced twice .
additionally , to verify efficacy of siwt1 rna oligonucleotides , rna was also collected from representative samples of the above transfected pc3 cells and qrt - pcr analysis of both wt1 and e - cadherin expression was done as described above .
wound healing assay pc3 cells were transfected with either risc or siwt1 rna oligonucleotides or mock as described above .
after 72 hours of treatment , transfected cells formed a confluent monolayer and a 200mul pipette tip was used to scratch a " wound " into the confluent monolayer .
pictures were taken as described above , but at 100x magnification , at both 0 and 16 hours after the " wounding " to provide a comparison of migration over time .
tscratch software [ 39 ] was used to analyze six images , measuring the differences in migration between mock , risc and siwt1 rna oligonucleotides transfected cells .
values were calculated as percentage (%) of open area (" wound ") remaining at 16 hours compared to 0 hour .
t - test was performed to determine significance .
wound healing assays in pc3 cells were reproduced twice with similar results .
as described above , to verify efficacy of siwt1 rna oligonucleotides , rna was also collected from representative samples of the above transfected pc3 cells and qrt - pcr analysis of both wt1 and e - cadherin expression was done as described above .
due to irregular growth of lncap monolayers , analyses by tscratch software was not attempted for gfp / wt1 transfected lncap cells , thus migration data in lncap cells was not confirmed by wound healing assays .

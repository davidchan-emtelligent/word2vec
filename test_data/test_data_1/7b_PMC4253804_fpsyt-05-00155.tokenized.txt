actigraphy sleep disorders polysomnography mslt longtime recording the gold standards for measurement of sleep and wake are polysomnography ( psg ) and the multiple sleep latency test ( mslt ) and will remain so. both tests are labor intensive and expensive when seen from the viewpoint of the sleep laboratory and a heavy burden for the patient , in particular for children and their parents .
furthermore , the use of mslt in children is hampered by the lack of reliable normal values .
actigraphy is a simple technique .
the actigraph looks like a small wristwatch and contains a device , which is sensitive to movements , a memory chip , and a battery. with a bin width that can be chosen dependent on the indication and the period of measurement , movements are detected and recorded by the memory chip .
the idea is that during sleep only few movements will be detected in contrast to a period during wakefulness .
the memory chip can be read through a simple device and plotted using a normal computer , notebook , or tablet .
parameters , such as time in bed ( tib ) , total sleep time ( tst ) , sleep onset latency ( sol ) , awakenings and their duration , and naps during daytime , are calculated and showed automatically .
as only little power is necessary , the actigraph can record continuously over long periods , which may extent to over 1 month in case the bin width is chosen conservatively , for example , every minute .
present day actigraphs record light intensity as well and some sophisticated models even record other parameters , such as heart frequency .
the advantages when compared to the gold standards are obvious : easy to do for the laboratory , low cost ( estimated at 5 % of one psg ) , no restrictions for the patient , and overview of a long period in one glance at the plot and quantification of important parameters of sleep and wake over the same period .
the disadvantage lies in the presumption that little activity means sleep , and the lack of data on sleep stages , accompanying respiration disorders or abnormal movements as periodic limb movements , etc ( 1 ) .
when compared on a day - to - day base , the data provided by actigraphy , differ with wide variations from the results of psg on the parameters mentioned .
in our study , in adults , the results are satisfactory and resembling , when the pooled mean results of at least five consecutive days of actigraphy ( in our sleep center 1 week ) is used for this comparison ( table 1 ) .
for this aspect in children , see hyde et al .
( 2 ) .
although only tested for long - term recording in patients with apnea syndrome , the device is approved and recommended by the aasm for an impression on sleep , but obviously not for the assessment of respiration .
after many thousands of actigraphic measurement of at least 1 week , in our hands , the method provides similar results as mentioned in the aasm report .
our indications are far wider and actigraphy is used in our laboratory on a routine base in patients with insomnia , circadian rhythm disorders , apnea syndromes , restless legs syndrome , and hypersomnia .
this holds for adults and children ( figure 1 ) .
in addition , assessment of the results of therapy for the sleep - wake disorder is easy using actigraphy , for example , in children with insomnia , limit setting disorder , and circadian rhythm disorders .

act overestimates tst and underestimates the other parameters .

comparison of one night polysomnography ( psg ) and mean of six nights actigraphy ( act ) resulting in 22 pairs for comparison .
figure 1 the figure shows three registrations of actigraphy over a period of 7 - 8 days .
each line represents 48 h. the plots are printed in a cascade mode : the right half of each line is printed as well as the left part of the next line in order to show clearly what happens around midnight .
arrows downward represent the moment of lights off ; the upward arrows out of bed .
( a ) a boy , 3 years old , with insomnia and limit setting disorder .
he sleeps from app .
7:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. each night , he is very noisy when awake and terrorizes his parents .
the actigraphy shows his regular bedtimes and the distinct periods of being active .
cognitive and behavioral therapy , in particular strict negation of the events during the night , was given to parents and child with good success .
( b ) a girl , 12 years old , complained about insomnia and tiredness during daytime .
she felt sleepy in the afternoon .
actigraphy shows a prolonged sleep time of app .
12 h ( 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. ) and regular naps after lunch .
the differential diagnosis was long sleeper hypersomnia , bad sleep hygiene , or both .
narcolepsy was not expected due to lack of other phenomena , such as cataplexy and hallucinations .
polysomnography showed many spontaneous arousals and short awakenings .
the main diagnosis was bad sleep hygiene .
cognitive and behavioral therapy resulted in a sleep period of app .
10 h when measured over the full 24 h. sleep quality improved as did the tiredness .
naps were no longer necessary .
this example shows as well that actigraphy has face value for the assessment of hypersomnia .
( c ) a boy 14 years of age .
he ca not sleep before 2 o'clock in the morning and has severe problems to come out of bed before 11 a.m. obviously , he fails at school , in particular in the first hours of morning classes .
actigraphy shows the real sleep / wake pattern .
the diagnosis is delayed sleep phase syndrome .
cognitive and behavioral therapy , endorsed by light therapy , led to a satisfactory situation with timing of sleep between 11.30 p.m. and 8.15 a.m. this example shows the important role of actigraphy in the assessment of disturbances of the biological clock .
the device is in particular useful when used as an extension to a diagnostic psg .
in our lab , we perform psg over two full days ( thus including the wake time ) together with actigraphy , followed by a period of at least 1 week of actigraphy only .
in this way , we get the details on sleep and wake from psg and a global overview over 9 days or more from actigraphy .
as there is some overlap in time , the actigraphy gives background to the psg data and vice versa .
in a formal comparison of history , psg over 24 h and actigraphy , the latter gives also reliable data on naps during daytime ( figure 1 ) .
if psg is not possible , actigraphy is a useful alternative .
patients with mental retardation , elderly patients who cannot come easily to the sleep laboratory , and ( young ) children are patient categories in whom actigraphy is an important way of recording sleep and wake .
for children , our indications are insomnia , including limit setting disorder , hypersomnia , and parasomnia during the night .
in teenagers and adolescents , the major indication is similar and includes the assessment of circadian rhythm disorders as well .
the major restriction in these disorders is that actigraphy only gives an impression on the quality of sleep and wake , but never details of sleep ( sleep stages , arousals , etc. ) , sleep disturbing factors as disorders of respiration or excessive movements ( periodic limb movements ) , or the exact details of parasomnias .
psg and mslt remain the gold standards , but actigraphy really helps when performed in the right way .
conflict of interest statement the author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

systemic mast cell activation disease ( mcad ) comprises disorders characterized by an enhanced release of mast cell mediators accompanied by accumulation of dysfunctional mast cells .
demonstration of familial clustering would be an important step towards defining the genetic contribution to the risk of systemic mcad .
the present study aimed to quantify familial aggregation for mcad and to investigate the variability of clinical and molecular findings ( e.g. somatic mutations in kit ) among affected family members in three selected pedigrees .
our data suggest that systemic mcad pedigrees include more systemic mcad cases than would be expected by chance , i.e. , compared with the prevalence of mcad in the general population .
the prevalence of mcad suspected by symptom self - report in first - degree relatives of patients with mcad amounted to approximately 46 % , compared to prevalence in the general german population of about 17 % ( p < 0.0001 ) .
in three families with a high familial loading of mcad , the subtype of mcad and the severity of mediator - related symptoms varied between family members .
in addition , genetic alterations detected in kit were variable , and included mutations at position 816 of the amino acid sequence .
in conclusion , our data provide evidence for common familial occurrence of mcad .
our findings observed in the three pedigrees together with recent reports in the literature suggest that , in familial cases ( i.e. , in the majority of mcad ) , mutated disease - related operator and / or regulator genes could be responsible for the development of somatic mutations in kit and other proteins important for the regulation of mast cell activity .
accordingly , the immunohistochemically different subtypes of mcad ( i.e. mast cell activation syndrome and systemic mastocytosis ) should be more accurately regarded as varying presentations of a common generic root process of mast cell dysfunction , than as distinct diseases .

introduction systemic mast cell activation disease ( mcad ) comprises disorders characterized by an enhanced release of mast cell mediators accompanied by accumulation of dysfunctional mast cells ([ 1 ] and references therein ) .
according to current classification [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , three subtypes of systemic mcad are distinguished : systemic mastocytosis ( sm ) ; mast cell activation syndrome ( mcas ) ; and mast cell leukemia ( mcl ) .
sm is characterized by specific pathological somatic mutations in exon 17 of the tyrosine kinase kit ( for which kit d816v accounts for the great majority ; reviewed in [ 3 ]) and immunohistochemical findings ( known as the world health organization ( who ) criteria ; [ 4 ]) caused by these mutations .
a diagnosis of mcas [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] is assigned to patients who present with multiple mast cell mediator - induced symptoms , but who do not fulfill the requirements for a diagnosis of sm , and in whom relevant differential diagnoses have been excluded .
mcl is an aggressive mast cell neoplasm , defined by increased numbers of mast cells in bone marrow smears (>= 20 %) and the presence of circulating mast cells ( reviewed in [ 4 ]) .
recently , a prevalence of 1 in 364,000 for sm in europeans has been calculated [ 3 ] .
data from a clinical population suggest that the prevalence of mcl is two orders of magnitude lower than that of sm [ 8 ] .
in contrast to these rare forms of systemic mcad , preliminary evidence suggests that mcas is much more common in the population and may be an underlying cause of various clinical presentations ( e.g. , in subsets of patients with fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome ) and prevalence is hence likely to lie at least within the single - digit percentage range ([ 3 ] ; and references therein ) .
very little is known about the familiality of systemic mcad .
to date , only five familial cases ( three sm and two mcas ) have been reported [ 9 ] - [ 13 ] .
a systematic investigation of familial clustering would be an important step towards defining the contribution of inherited genetic factors to the risk of systemic mcad .
in a preliminary analysis of family data [ 3 ] , solely based on information provided by index patients , we obtained first evidence that familial occurrence of mcad might be a frequent phenomenon .
in the present systematic family study we obtained direct information from first - degree relatives of mcad patients and compared this to data obtained from the general population with the aim of quantifying the familial aggregation of mcad .
in addition , three multiply affected families were investigated in detail to determine the spectrum of clinical affections among family members as well as the variation in kit muations and kit isoforms .
methods subjects one - hundred - and - twenty - four patients ( = index patients ) , who presented to our bonn interdisciplinary research group for systemic mast cell diseases between may , 2005 , and november , 2011 , for diagnostic reasons , were asked to participate in this study and 84 index patients with mcad ( mcas n = 69 , sm n = 15 ) agreed ( table 1 , table s1 ) .
in the index patients sm was diagnosed according to the world health organization criteria for definition of sm [ 4 ] .
diagnosis of mcas was based on the proposed criteria to define mcas [ 1 ] , i.e. the typical clinical symptoms recorded in a standardized manner by our validated questionnaire [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses of mcad which may present with organ - or tissue - related mast cell mediator - induced symptoms , determination of pathologically increased release of specific mast cell mediators , i.e. tryptase , heparin and histamin in blood and n - methylhistamine in urine , and in some cases detection of functionally activating genetic changes in mast cells .
all patients were asked to obtain consent from first - degree relatives to allow us to contact them .
after consent was obtained , first - degree relatives were contacted and asked to complete a questionnaire .
two - hundred - and - fifty - five first - degree relatives were enrolled ( table 1 , table s1 ) .
there were no monozygotic twins among the sample of index patients and first - degree relatives .
a sample of 266 subjects ( those who responded from a total of 1,000 persons contacted ; table s1 ) , randomly recruited from the german inhabi - tants of the city of bonn through addresses provided by the city 's registration office , served as a control group representative of the german population .
information on the ethnicity of all participants was obtained through documenting the country / town of origin of the grandparents of participants .
the characteristics of the study population are listed in table 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0076241.t001 table 1 characteristics of index patients , their first - degree relatives , and healthy controls .
index patients first - degree relatives healthy controls ( n = 84 ) ( n = 255 ) ( n = 266 ) variables n (%) n (%) n (%) females 62 ( 74 %) 142 ( 56 %) 143 ( 54 %) age ( mean +/ - sd , 48.3 +/ - 13.8 52.1 +/ - 20.6 52.7 +/ - 18.3 range ) 21 - 84 8 - 98 20 - 92 age groups ( years ) < 21 0 ( 0 %) 19 ( 8 %) 1 ( 0.4 %) 21 - 39 23 ( 27 %) 51 ( 20 %) 71 ( 27 %) 40 - 49 23 ( 27 %) 35 ( 14 %) 48 ( 18 %) 50 - 59 21 ( 25 %) 38 ( 15 %) 48 ( 18 %) 60 - 69 10 ( 12 %) 52 ( 20 %) 46 ( 17 %) 70 - 79 5 ( 6 %) 36 ( 14 %) 29 ( 11 %) > 80 2 ( 2 %) 24 ( 9 %) 23 ( 9 %) parents : 98 mother 60 ( 61 %) father 38 ( 39 %) siblings : 94 sister 52 ( 55 %) brother 42 ( 45 %) children : 63 daughter 30 ( 48 %) son 33 ( 52 %) diagnostic procedure in all relatives and control participants , a diagnosis of mcad was judged likely , for purposes of our analyses , based on information documented in a self - report questionnaire ( table s2 ) .
this questionnaire was compiled on the basis of our previously published validated questionnaire [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
after exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses mcad was diagnosed , if ( 1 ) 11 or more items of the questionnaire were applicable or ( 2 ) if potentially mast cell mediator - related symptoms occurred in five or more different organs and / or tissues .
the information documented in the self - report questionnaire did not allow assignment of mcad diagnosis to the subtypes sm and mcas , because no data on mediator levels in blood or urine , or immunohistological or molecular findings from biopsies were recorded , and these are required for mcad subclassification .
in the three multiply affected pedigrees in which we characterized somatic kit mutations and expression of kit isoforms , severity of the mcad was defined as recently proposed ( mild : no drug therapy required ; moderate : drug therapy required , but no need for hospitalization ; severe : drug therapy and recurrent hospitalization required ; [ 16 ]) .
ethics statement the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the rheinische friedrich - wilhelms - university of bonn ( no. 260 / 07 ) .
all participants were informed in detail about the purpose of the study .
all index patients and their relatives gave written informed consent prior to the investigation , according to the guidelines of the ethics committee .
due to the anonymous nature of the survey of the control population , the ethics committee waived the need for written informed consent from the control participants .
statistical analyses all data were statistically analyzed using sas version 9.2 .
logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the association of mcad with mast cell - related symptoms and findings .
chi - square analysis was used to compare categorical data to obtain estimates of possible association .
a p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
analysis of somatic kit mutations and kit isoforms in three selected families peripheral blood obtained by venipuncture was drawn into syringes containing edta as an anti - coagulant .
hematopoietic mast cell - committed progenitors were isolated as described previously [ 17 ] .
briefly , mast cell committed - progenitors were separated by density gradient centrifugation using ficollpaque plus ( ge healthcare bio - sciences , uppsala , sweden ) followed by immunomagnetic positive selection with mab against human cd117 ( the tyrosine kinase , kit , encoded by the gene kit ) according to the manufacturers instructions ( magnetic cell sorting , macs ; miltenyi biotech , bergisch gladbach , germany ) .
rna was extracted and reverse - transcribed by standard techniques .
there was no contamination of genomic dna in the rna preparation as proved by control pcrs using primers enclosing intron - exon - boundaries .
specific pcr primers were designed to amplify overlapping fragments of corresponding kit cdnas .
the primer sequences ( table s3 ) were adapted from the human kit reference sequence ( accession number nm _ 000222 ) .
pcr was carried out using cdna , failsafe pcr buffer g ( epicentre , madison , wi , usa ) and 1 u of taq dna polymerase ( invitrogen , karlsruhe , germany ) , in a final volume of 50 microl .
the pcr conditions were 40 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94degreesc , 1 min at the appropriate annealing temperature for the primers ( table s3 ) , and 1 min extension at 72degreesc , followed by a final 5 min extension period at 72degreesc .
pcr products were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 1.8 % agarose gel .
the bands of interest were cut out of the gel , and the dna was extracted using the minelute gel extraction kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
pcr products were directly sequenced at qiagen ( hilden , germany ) .
the expression intensities of two splicing isoforms of transcripts of kit , which are characterized by the presence or absence of the tetra - peptide sequence glycine - asparagine - asparagine - lysine ( gnnk , amino acids 510 - 513 ) in the extracellular part of the juxtamembrane region were determined by agarose gel scanning densitometry .
the ratios of the expression intensity of the splicing isoforms with the deletion of the amino acids 510 - 513 ( gnnk ( - )) over that without this deletion ( gnnk ( - )/(+)) were calculated .
results a total of 84 families were studied. of the index patients , 62 were female ( 74 %) and 22 were male ( 26 %) , with a female to male ratio of 2.8:1 ( table 1 ) .
the age of the patients ranged from 21 to 84 years , with a mean age of 48.3 years ( table 1 ) .
the 84 index patients had a total of 372 first - degree relatives , of which 255 completed the questionnaire ( table s1 ) .
a total of 117 relatives could not be questioned for various reasons , including that they were no longer alive , or had no known contact details ( table s1 ) .
the groups of index patients , first - degree relatives , and healthy controls did not differ significantly in age distribution ( table 1 ) .
familial occurrence of mcad approximately 74 % of our index patients had at least one first - degree relative with systemic mcad , regardless of systemic mcad subtype and gender ( not shown ) .
the prevalence of systemic mcad among first - degree relatives in our sample was 46 % ( table 2a ) , which differed significantly ( p < 0.0001 ) from the prevalence in the control group ( approximately 17 % ; table 2a ) .
there was no significant difference in prevalence of mcad among first - degree relatives of patients with the mcad subtypes , mcas and sm , at 60 % and 44 % , respectively ( p = 0.1048 ) .
a female prepronderance was observed in affected relatives and controls ( 67 % ; 64 %) which was slightly less pronounced than in the index patients ( 74 %) .
the prevalence of mcad was similar among the different groups of first - degree relatives ( parents , siblings and children ) ( table 2b ) .

spectrum of clinical and kit affections within three selected pedigrees in the present study we investigated three selected families with a high familial loading of mcad for variability in disease subtype and severity of disease , for different somatic mutations in the kit gene at the level of mrna and for differences in the expression of isoforms of the tyrosine kinase kit .
the mcad subtype and the severity of the mediator - related symptoms varied , between the members of the families ( fig. 1 and fig. s1 ) .
in addition variable genetic alterations in kit were detected ( fig. 1 and fig. s1 ) .
in two pedigrees , three members possessed a mutation at position 816 of the amino acid sequence of kit ( d816g and d816v , fig. 1 ; d816v , fig. s1a ) , whereas the other mcad - affected family members had varying mutations at other sites of kit .
there was no obvious relation between the kit mutations and the clinical severity of mcad .
however , in our patients with severe mcad the expression intensity ratio for gnnk ( - )/(+) ( the kit isoforms characterized by the presence or absence of the tetrapeptide sequence glycine - asparagine - asparagine - lysine ( gnnk ) in the extracellular part of the juxtamembrane region ) was >= 95 % ( fig. 1 ; fig. s1 ) .

discussion the present study is the first systematic investigation of the familial occurrence of mcad .
our data suggest that the prevalence of systemic mcad is higher among relatives of mcad patients than would be expected by chance , i.e. , on the basis of the prevalence of mcad in the general population .
the prevalence of mcad suspected by symptom self - report in first - degree relatives of patients with mcad and in the german general population was approximately 46 % and 17 % , respectively ( table 2 ) .
although familial occurrence due to shared environmental factors cannot be ruled out , it is likely that there is a significant genetic contribution to this familial occurrence .
a preponderance of females was observed among those affected in all groups .
the 17 % prevalence of mcad suspected by symptom self - report in the german general population is probably due to the common occurrence of the mcas subtype .
evidence has been presented that mcas may be an underlying cause of various frequent clinical presentations ; for example , in subsets of patients with fibromyalgia [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and irritable bowel syndrome [ 20 ] .
accordingly , the prevalence of mcas , and therewith that of mcad , was expected to be at least within the single - figure percentage range [ 3 ] .
in previous studies we have presented indirect evidence for a potentially high prevalence of mcad in the general population : ( 1 ) in human tissues , mast cells are the principal source of heparin .
we found increased heparin levels in blood indicating a pathological increase in mast cell activity in approximately 50 % of mcad patients and and in 17 % of the control subjects ([ 21 ] and references therein ; unpublished data ) .
( 2 ) in our comparative analysis of kit mutations in mast cells from patients with mcad and control subjects we detected potentially functionally activating genetic alterations in 13 of 20 patients ( 65 %) and in 3 of 20 control subjects ( 15 %) [ 22 ] .
in both studies those control subjects exhibiting an increased mast cell activity and kit mutations , respectively , possibly represent individuals affected with mcad at a subclinical stage .
thus , the prevalence of mcad determined in this study fits well to these previous indirect estimations , suggesting that it is likely to reflect the true prevalence of the disease in the german population .
a limitation of our study with regard to this conclusion may be that , in first - degree relatives and healthy control subjects , the diagnosis was made according to self - declared information .
the sensitivity of the questionnaire to detect mcad is high ( reflected in the significantly increased prevalence of reported symptoms in mcad compared with the control group ) but it could not be reassessed whether the information about the absence or presence of relevant further diseases ( differential diagnoses ) were valid .
hence , the prevalence could be overestimated .
in addition it cannot be excluded that recall bias in our controls has resulted in an overestimation of the prevalence of mcad in the general population .
only 27 % of the people whom we originally contacted completed the questionnaire and , since the purpose of the study and the disease were described in the addressing letter , affected people may have preferentially responded to our request .
therefore our estimation of the prevalence must be viewed with caution and should be taken as a stimulus to pursue more epidemiological studies in the future .
for our study of familial aggregation , an overestimation of the true population prevalence had a conservative effect and therefore , does not affect the conclusions drawn from our observation of a significantly increased prevalence among first - degree relatives of patients .
in the three selected pedigrees , the mcad subtype and the severity of the mediator - related symptoms varied between the members of the families .
similarly , in three of the five previous case reports on familial mcad variability in the disease subtype , the severity of mediator - related symptoms , and the age at clinical onset within the mcad sufferers has been described [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 23 ] .
in four of those five case reports [ 10 ] - [ 13 ] functionally activating somatic point mutations were identified in mast cells which , however , were homotypic , i.e. identical between the affected family members .
in contrast , in our pedigrees the genetic alterations detected in kit varied between the affected family members as expected for genetic alterations occurring at the somatic level .
the inherited genetic background leading to the familial occurrence of mcad remains to be detected , and may , for example , involve operator and / or regulator genes of dna synthesis , control and repair .
the genetic mutations detected in the three families included mutations at position 816 of the amino acid sequence of kit ( d816g , fig. 1 ; d816v , fig. 1 and fig. s1a ) .
this finding is remarkable in that it disproves the longstanding ( although unproven ) assertion that the somatic nature of kit d816v and related exon 17 mutations exclude heritability of the disease in the respective case [ 4 ] , [ 24 ] .
in the clinically affected but also in some of the clinically healthy family members of our three pedigrees multiple co - occurring mutations in the exons of the kit gene were detected ( the introns were not investigated ) .
this finding supports our previous suggestion that the clinical presentation of mcad , i.e. subtype , severity and therapy responsiveness , is not determined by one kit mutation alone but by multiple co - occuring mutations in kit and / or other relevant genes [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] .
in fact , there is accumulating evidence for the presence of disease - relevant multiple co - occurring mutations in kit [ 12 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] as well as of a combination of kit mutations with mutations in other genes ( e.g. , jak2 , tet2 , dnmt3a , asxl1 , cbl , u2af1 , srsf2 , ms4a2 ; [ 11 ] , [ 27 ] - [ 31 ]) .
in accordance with this idea that a mutation on its own does not define the clinical phenotype of mcad , there was no obvious relation between the kit mutations detected in the three families and the severity of mcad of the affected family members in the present study .
however , it has been reported that the predominance of a certain kit isoform , nameley of the gnnk ( - ) isoform which is characterized by the absence of the tetrapeptide sequence glycine - asparagine - asparagine - lysine ( gnnk ) in the extracellular part of the juxtamembrane region and which shows tumorigenic potency , may contribute to , or reflect a pathological increase in , the activation of affected mast cells [ 3 ] .
in the present three pedigrees the expression intensity ratio for gnnk ( - )/(+) isoforms was >= 95 % in all patients with severe mcad ( fig. 1 ; fig. s1 ) which is in agreement with previous data [ 3 ] .
although the reason for the predominant expression of the gnnk ( - ) - isoform in those patients is still unknown , its presence may support the diagnosis mcad [ 3 ] .
in conclusion , our data provide evidence for common familial occurrence of mcad .
this makes the future application of systematic molecular genetic studies , such as genome - wide association studies , to mcad very promising .
together with findings of previous studies , which suggested that almost all kit mutations were somatic rather than germline ( reviewed in [ 3 ]) , our present data support the idea that in familial cases ( i.e. , the majority of mcad ) mutated disease - related operator and / or regulator genes could be responsible for the development of somatic mutations in kit and other proteins involved in the regulation of mast cell activity [ 3 ] .
accordingly , the immunohistochemically different subtypes of mcad ( mcas and sm ) should be more accurately regarded as varying presentations of a common generic root process of mast cell dysfunction , than as distinct diseases [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] .

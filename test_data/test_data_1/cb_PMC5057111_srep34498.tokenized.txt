seed treatment with mesa , is an encouraging method to the seed industry to produce more growth and yield .
the aim of our study is to find out the growth , development and disease tolerance of rice seed treated with different concentrations of mesa .
also the seed treatments were studied to determine whether they directly influenced seedling emergence and growth in rice ( oryza sativa l ) cultivars ' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ' under greenhouse condition .
mesa seed treatments at 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 mg / l significantly increased seedling emergence .
effects were stronger in ir 50 , and ir 64 and the effects were dose dependent , although the relationship between dose and effect was not always linear .
mesa seed treated rice plant against bacterial blight were analyzed .
bacterial blight was more effectively controlled by the seed treated with 100 mg / l than others .
these results suggest that seed treatment with mesa alters plant physiology in ways that may be useful for crop production as well as protection .
plants are one of the basic staple food , for all forms of life .
we depend on plants for food and medicine , plant derivatives , regulation of the hydrologic cycle .
plants are essential to the balance of nature1 .
for more than half of the world 's population " rice is life " .
rice is an economic crop for the farmers and major food staple for the world .
rice provides the main source of food energy for at least one third of the world 's population234 .
rice is an essential part of the daily meal in southern and eastern parts of india and asia .
however most the rice plant are affected by the bacterial blight caused by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( xoo ) and it is one of the most important bacterial diseases of rice .
heavy yield losses due to x. oryzae was reported during last one decade356 .
seed germination is one of the early and vital stages in the plant life cycle .
improved germination of seeds is one process which can improve the economic success of crop by ultimately enhancing the yield .
the process of seed germination may be regulated by external factors , including temperature , light , soil moisture and salinity , metal or mineral composition78 .
treatments of seed include applications of chemical agents , biological substances , or physical processes , to increase agricultural production .
the seed treatment helps to protect seedlings from insects and disease which pose devastating consequences to crop production during critical growth stages .
the application of treatments to seeds promotes stronger and healthier roots , leading to uniform seedling emergence , with improved crop performance910 .
seed priming is a method of pre - sowing treatments that exposes seeds to a certain solutions that allows partial hydration until the germination process begins111213.various seed priming techniques have been reported to enhance germination and allow for more uniform seed emergence , increasing nutrient reserves through increased physiological activities and increased yield in the crop14 .
various common methods utilized for priming seeds includes : hydro priming , ( soaking in water ) ; osmopriming ( soaking seed in osmotic solutions ) ; thermopriming ( treatment of seed with low or high temperatures ) ; solid matrix priming ( treatment of seed with solid matrices ) ; and bio priming ( hydration using biological compounds ) 15 .
halo priming ( soaking seed in salt solutions ) , and priming with plant growth hormones are also performed along with thermo priming , and on - farm priming16 .
the mechanism of rice seed priming techniques which uses plant growth regulators may enhance rice performance .
plant hormones or bio - stimulants are also known to improve plant population and increase productivity .
presoaking seeds with optimal concentrations of plant growth hormones , such as auxin ( iaa ) , gibberellins ( ga ) , abscisic acid , ethylene ( et ) , salicylic acid ( sa ) and jasmonic acid ( ja ) have been shown to benefit germination performance and yield of some crop species growth under both normal and stress conditions171819 .
the effects of seed priming by soaking seeds of sorghum , rice , or wheat in water , are reported to enhance germination rates .
some strategies for more vigorous plants report improved seedling emergence under induced stress conditions2021 .
sa is a natural phenolic compound that plays a role in the regulation of physiological and biochemical processes .
sa is chemically known as 2 - hydroxy benzoic acid is a member of phenolic compounds , containing of an aromatic ring bearing a hydroxyl group which is synthesized by the plant22 .
these hydroxyl groups are involved in lignin biosynthesis ; others serve as allelopathic compounds , regulate plant responses to abiotic stress and disease resistance by inducing antimicrobial defense compounds termed phytoalexins or by signaling defense activation23242526 .
exogenous application of sa act as potential antioxidant capacity inducers , also increase the levels of hydrogen peroxide in plants .
these pathways also regulate many physiological processes in plants , such as increased germination rate , cell growth , stomatal opening , photosynthesis and ion uptake27 .
methyl salicylate ( mesa ) is a volatile organic compound which is synthesized from sa. mesa is associated with induced resistance plant defense which has been used in effective disease control methods282930 .
seed treatment with mesa can be used to enhance rice seed germination and seedling growth .
we studied the performance of rice seed priming with different concentrations of mesa ( 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 mg / l ) .
variables assessed include : germination rate , growth of root and shoot heights ( cm ) , biomass of fresh and dry weights of the shoots and roots ( mg ) disease incidence , mean lesion lengths , disease index and disease incidence of different rice varieties under greenhouse conditions .
results germination responses after seed treatment with mesa on rice seed in greenhouse condition the seed pretreatment of different concentration of mesa ( i.e. 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 mg / l ) had significant ( p < 0.05 ) effects on the final germination percentage and germination rates ( figs 1 and 2 ) .
treated seeds with mesa had significantly higher percentage of germination than those in control .
treatment of ' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ' rice varieties with mesa increased the rate of seedling emergence ( fig. 1a - f ) .
emergence of rice varieties were more pronounced in all mesa treatment with 100 mg / l concentration being statistically different with all other treatments .
for example 80 % germination was observed within 8 days in ir 20 rice varieties after seed treated with 100 mg / l. all the rice varieties treated with mesa , had greater emergence values compared with control rice plant .
in ' ir 20 ' 20 % emergence , 40 % emergence , 60 % emergence and 80 % emergence occurred earlier in mesa treated plants than in control plants ( 20 % - f4,30 = 3.08 ; p < 0.0031 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 2.75 ; p < 0.046 , 60 % - f4,30 = 3.56 ; p < 0.08 and 80 % - f4,25 = 5.10 ; p < 0.004 ) ( fig. 2a ) there was a trend towards faster emergence with increased concentration seed treatment rates .
the same developments were observed in rice variety ' ir 50 ' seedling emergence ( 20 % - f4,30 = 2.62 ; p < 0.055 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 3.24 ; p < 0.025 , 60 % - f4,30 = 2.65 ; p < 0.053 and 80 % - f4,29 = 4.24 ; p < 0.008 ) ( fig. 2b ) .
germination percentage was influenced by mesa seed treatment , but influence was more pronounced in 100 mg / l than other treatments .
control seeds emerged at lower than 20 % at 4 days .
however most of the treated rice seeds germinated at 20 % , except ( ir 20 and asd 19 ) , at 4 days , being statistically significant .
the same observation was noticed in rice varieties ' ir 64 ' ( 20 % - f4,30 = 3.28 ; p < 0.024 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 2.48 ; p < 0.065 , 60 % - f4,30 = 2.84 ; p < 0.041 and 80 % - f4,26 = 2.33 ; p < 0.082 ) ( fig. 2c ) , ' asd 16 ' ( 20 % - f4,30 = 3.05 ; p < 0.032 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 2.31 ; p < 0.081 , 60 % - f4,28 = 5.49 ; p < 0.002 and 80 % - f4,13 = 2.95 ; p < 0.061 ) ( fig. 2d ) .
the germination rate of seeds was increased after treatment with mesa in resistant rice varieties asd 19 ( 20 % - f4,30 = 3.06 ; p < 0.031 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 3.80 ; p < 0.013 , 60 % - f4,28 = 5.61 ; p < 0.002 and 80 % - f4,13 = 3.19 ; p < 0.049 ) ( fig. 2e ) and adt 46 ( 20 % - f4,30 = 2.88 ; p < 0.040 ; 40 % - f4,30 = 2.78 ; p < 0.045 , 60 % - f4,27 = 5.46 ; p < 0.002 and 80 % - f4,11 = 3.17 ; p < 0.058 ) ( fig. 2f ) .
compared with control , the seeds showed greater germination rates when treated with mesa .
the germination rates were significantly greater when treated with mesa at 100 mg / l. seed - priming treatments with mesa significantly enhanced the seedling growth of rice compared with non - treated control .
the greatest effect was observed from seed - coating treatments of 100 mg / l mesa ( fig. 3 ) .
on average , seed priming treatments significantly increased the shoot length by 40.78 % ( f4,30 = 14.88 ; p < 0.0001 ) , 24.31 % ( f4,30 = 17.05 ; p < 0.0001 ) , 20.90 %( f4,30 = 10.73 ; p < 0.0001 ) , 35.34 % ( f4,30 = 7.30 ; p < 0.0001 ) , 25.90 % ( f4,30 = 7.88 ; p < 0.0001 ) and 34.82 % ( f4,30 = 11.10 ; p < 0.001 ) for ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 respectively compared with control .
the same trend was also noticed in root length after treatment with 100 mg / l mesa .
for example 54.46 % increased root length was observed in asd 16 after treatment with 100 mg / l mesa which was significantly different from control ( f4 , 30 = 11.25 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
insignificant difference was observed between treatments of 75 and 100 mg / l mesa .
treatment of seeds with mesa also improved root : shoot ratio of the rice seedlings under greenhouse condition .
for ' asd 16 ' , the effect of mesa seed treatment was significant for root : shoot ratio ( f4,30 = 4.44 ; p < 0.006 ) ( fig. 4a ) .
interestingly , there was a non - linear response for ir 50 and ir 64 , root : shoot ratios and they were not significant between 25 - 100 mg / l treatments ( f4 , 30 = 3.73 ; p < 1.00 and f4 , 30 = 3.98 ; p < 1.00 for ir 50 and ir 64 respectively ) ( fig. 4a ) .
further we have observed significant growth of root and shoot morphologically after seed were treated with mesa ( fig. 4b ) .
all the seed treatments had significant effects on fresh and dry weight of shoot and root ( fig. 5 ) .
shoot fresh weight significantly increased in seedlings raised from seeds treated with 75 and 100 mg / l mesa .
maximum shoot fresh weight of 457.4 mg was attained in asd 16 seeds treated with 100 mg / l mesa after 20 days as compare to control ( 361.8 mg ) ( fig. 5 ) .
however minimum shoot fresh weight of 270.66 mg was observed in control seeds of ir 50 after 20 days .
shoot and root fresh and dry weights of ' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 treated and untreated plants are shown in fig. 5a - x. seed treatment with 100 mg / l mesa significantly increased shoot fresh weights ( f4,20 = 14.69 , p < 0.0001 - ir 20 ; f4,20 = 5.75 , p < 0.003 - ir 50 ; f4,20 = 7.69 , p < 0.001 - ir 64 ; f4,20 = 7.18 , p < 0.001 - asd 16 ; f4,20 = 3.22 , p < 0.035 - asd 19 ; f4,20 = 3.91 , p < 0.017 - adt 46 ) and dry weights ( f4,20 = 24.08 , p < 0.0001 - ir 20 ; f4,20 = 69.90 , p < 0.0001 - ir 50 ; f4,20 = 7.88 , p < 0.001 - ir 64 ; f4,20 = 29.06 , p < 0.001 - asd 16 ; f4,20 = 7.60 , p < 0.001 - asd 19 ; f4,20 = 13.31 , p < 0.0001 - adt 46 ) at 22 days post treatment .
the same linear growth pattern was observed both in fresh and dry weight of root after seed treatment with mesa .
in general , a positive relationship was observed between seed treatment concentration rate and root and shoot weights ( fig. 5 ) .
control of bacterial blight under greenhouse condition the effect of mesa seed treatment in suppressing bacterial blight disease was analyzed under greenhouse condition .
bacterial blight disease lesion length ( mm ) ( fig. 6 ) and disease index ( fig. 7 ) was found to be significantly lower in 100 mg / l mesa seed treated rice plant .
however other lower seed treatments also found to be effective than control .
the bacterial blight disease lesion length ( mm ) was 2.94 mm in control but the adt 46 rice seed treated with 100 mg / l was inoculated with x. oryzae lesion length ( mm ) measured as 1.92 mm ( f4,20 = 4.39 , p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 6 ) .
however we did not observe any significant difference between control and 25 mg / l mesa seed treated rice adt 46 plant ( f4,20 = 4.39 , p < 0.93 ) .
the same trend was observed in disease index .
the disease index ( di ) was higher in ( 39.2 %) control ir 20 plant and the di was significantly lower in ir 20 rice plant in which the seed was treated with 100 mg / l mesa ( 26.40 %) ( f4,20 = 6.33 , p < 0.002 ) ( fig. 7 ) .
even though three rice varieties ( i.e. asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ) are resistant to bacterial blight disease , seed treatment with mesa further enhance the resistant against the bacterial blight disease and it was proved by the disease index experiment .
discussion treatment of seeds with mesa increased rate of germination and rice growth .
the amount of effect differed among rice varieties and effects were dose rate dependent .
also , effects appeared to be more pronounced at 75 and 100 mg / l seed treatments under normal greenhouse conditions .
mesa influences seed germination , seedling establishment , cell growth , respiration , stomatal closure , senescence - associated gene expression , basal thermotolerance , nodulation in legumes , and fruit yield2531 .
most consistent response to mesa seed treatment in this research was an increase in rate of emergence of seeds and biomass of the rice plants after sowing .
the effect of mesa was stronger both in ' ir 20 and ir 50 ' than other rice varieties , which produced higher seedling emergence rates ( kalaivani and senthil - nathanunpublished data ) .
this study shows that rice plant could be induced by exogenous application of the signaling compounds mesa .
the allelopathic potential of the root and shoot of rice thus increased after treatment with mesa ( figs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
the same effect was observed in the rice strains iac165 and huajingxian32 .
in the present study mesa treatment with 100 mg / l of rice seed showed enhanced effects on emergence and biomass of rice seedlings .
other studies have also shown that natural plant products can enhance defense system of plant along with protection from pest and diseases333435 .
further plant hormonal and other treatments enhanced seedling vigor as measured in longer shoot and root lengths , with increased fresh and dry weights .
accelerated cell division and enlargement of cell explain the production of vigorous seedlings by pre - sowing seed treatment with plant growth regulators16 .
several studies have shown impact of mesa seed treatment on germination and early seedling growth .
enhanced germination , emergence and growth were recorded in wheat , triticum aestivum l. when the seeds were subjected to pre - sowing seed - soaking treatment in salicylic acid36 .
3 senthil - nathan et al.37 reported that neem treatment on rice resulted in increased production and diseases tolerance than control .
hayat et al.38 observed the grains of wheat ( triticum aestivum l. cv. raj - 3077 ) were soaked in 0 , 10 - 5 , 10 - 4 and 10 - 3 m aqueous solutions of seedlings possessed significantly greater leaf numbers , fresh and dry mass .
the present finding gained support from these previous reports .
shakirova et al.39 conclude that pre - sowing t. aestivum seed treatment with sa leads to an activation of germination and seedling growth .
the enhancement results in the division of root apical cells which is an important contribution to the growth stimulating effect of sa .
shakirova36 has confirmed with field experiments .
in the field , wheat plants pretreated with sa were characterized with increased size of ears , grain yield , indicating prolonged effect of pre - sowing treatment of seeds , which produced stimultative effect on the productivity of wheat , at harvest .
rate of seedling emergence was increased approximately 25 % at seed treatment with 75 and 100 mg / l mesa .
emergence of ' ir 20 , ir 50 and asd 16 ' seedlings was significantly faster in mesa treated seeds , but it is not linear with treatment doses .
the percentage of emergence ( 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 %) at the different seed treatment rates indicated that emergence increased with seed treatment concentration rate , with faster emergence from seeds treated with 100 mg / l mesa .
the increased percentage of emergence and biomass with increasing dose is probably due to increased sa in plant cells , as reported in other crops .
for example , increased percentage of emergence and growth was observed by singh and usha40 and dolatabadian et al.41 in wheat seeds , tavares et al.28 in rice , khodary42 in maize , jadhav and bhamburdekar43 and szepesi et al.44 in tomato , martin - mex et al.45 in african violet , mccue et al.46 in pea seeds , almeida et al.47 in wheat and barley seeds which revealed that mesa accelerates germination greatly .
seed treatment with mesa may help in the metabolic pentose phosphate pathway , benefiting the hydrolysis of reserves and increasing the availability of energy to the germination process and seedling emergence25 .
several reports were published in the last decade demonstrating the role of sa applied as seed soaking treatment on various physiological processes44454647 .
it was shown that the pre - soaking of pea seeds in sa had a beneficial effect on growth and photosynthesis48 .
mesa treatments produced measurable effects on root and shoot growth of rice seedling varieties .
gutierrez - coronado et al.49 reported that foliar application of sa to the shoots of soybean plants positively affected the size of the root .
furthermore sandoval - yepiz50 reported similar findings with tagetus erecta , using low concentrations ( 10 - 10 m ) of sa. increased shoot growth was observed in clitoria sp. after application of salicylates51 .
a more in - depth study would be required to determine the specific modes of action of mesa on non - linear growth of roots and shoots in different crops .
the increase observed in shoot and root weight when treated with mesa , was dose dependent ( 75 and 100 mg / l ) .
this response suggests that a greater portion of photosynthates was distributed to the roots than the shoots in seedlings developing from nontreated seeds as compared with seedlings developing from mesa treated seeds253652 .
the promoting effect of sa on the leaf area was attributed to its important roles on activating cell division , biosynthesis of organic foods , water uptake and stomatal resistance and tolerating water deficit better .
in addition , mentioned that improving effect of sa on the ready availability of nutrients ( i.e. n , p , k , ca , and mg ) to the plant .
increased levels of mineral after treatment with sa were observed in maize53 , tomato44 and cucumber54 .
these results are in support with many other researchers who reported an increased amount of nutrients in roots and shoot after treatments with sa275556 .
according to stout et al.57 and vazirimehr et al.27 plant seeds treated with sa have higher levels of amino acids , plant growth , ion uptake , transport enzyme activity and synthesis of plant hormones , that increase the plant responses to these proteins and these events provide significant increases in production and reduce time for the establishment of the crop field , being more tolerant against abiotic stresses .
the data of the present study support the above hypothesis .
for more than two decades the plant hormone salicylic acid ( sa ) and its derivatives ( mesa ) has been studied for its use to protect the plant .
however , its systemic acquired signaling act in plants , particularly in defense against plant disease causing microbes , has only become more interest during last two decades3157 .
our research has clearly pointed out the mesa has a potential to control the bacterial blight disease .
also seed treated with 100 mg / l has less blight lesion and diseases index .
it was evident that sa and its derivatives act as a critical defense signal has come from analyses of plants in which endogenous sa levels were triggered or altered .
it was proved in series of experiments in arabidopsis ( transgenic tobacoo ) expressing the bacterial nahg gene , encoding the sa - metabolizing enzyme salicylate hydroxylase315859 .
in addition , endogenous sa levels increase in barley resisting infection by the bacterial pathogen p. syringae pv. syringae60 .
also in rice homolog enhances resistance to the bacterial blight - causing x. oryzae616263 .
mesa seed treatments ( 75 and 100 mg / l ) significantly increased the emergence and early growth of rice plants .
but the effect was non - linear across treatment concentrations and rice varieties .
further we conclude that use of mesa in seed treatment has great potential for increasing uniform emergence , root and shoot length , root and shoot biomass .
thus , treatment of seeds with sa may produce favorable effects on rice growth .
also mesa seed treatment has better protection against blight diseases .
methods plant material and seed treatments a commercial formulation of methyl salicylate ( methyl salicylate , sigma - aldrich ) was used for all experiments .
the rice varieties ' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ' were used for this study .
' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 ' are susceptible , conventional , semi - dwarf , long - grain aromatic variety with relatively high seedling vigor , whereas ' asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ' are moderate resistance , conventional , semi - dwarf long grain variety with low seedling vigor .
rice were surface disinfected by immersing in 2 % sodium hypochlorite for about two minutes and washed several times with sterilized water , then dried in sterilized filter paper .
salicylate formulations and treatments consisted of increasing levels of 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 , mg / l of mesa .
a stock solution of mesa 100 mg / l was used for successive dilutions in distilled water .
the seeds were treated by applying 2 ml / kg of seed in each respective mesa concentration according to methodology described by tavares et al.28 .
the solution of mesa with the different doses was directly placed at the bottom of the zip lock plastic bag .
then 250 g of seeds were added into each bag .
they were agitated for 10 minutes .
the seeds were spread out on clean paper and left to dry at room temperature for 24 hours .
treated seeds were used for further experiments .
seed treatments under greenhouse conditions ' ir 20 , ir 50 , ir 64 , asd 16 , asd 19 and adt 46 ' rice plants were grown by sowing five seeds of a single treatment rate ( 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 mg / l ) in 0.5 l pots in a greenhouse .
there were 7 pots ( replicates ) per treatment .
the potting soil was composed of two parts of autoclaved silt loam soil with one part each of sand and peat moss .
the experiment was conducted in early january and , as temperature regulation in the greenhouse was poor , temperatures fluctuated from 22degrees to 32 degreesc .
lighting was ambient , and pots were watered as needed .
pots were observed daily for emergence of hypocotyls above the surface of the soil after sowing .
the experiment was terminated after 12 days .
for statistical analysis , days until 20 % , 40 % and 60 % seedling emergence were calculated for each pot .
at 12th day after sowing , all seedlings were removed from pots , counted , and cleaned with water .
maximum root length ( cm / plant ) shoot length ( cm / plant ) , weight ( both wet and dry weight in mg ) for each plant were determined by using a ruler and monopan balance .
germination was scored daily by counting emerging plant shoots .
the experiment was terminated after 22 days .
percent emergence was calculated as in the greenhouse experiment .
roots and shoots were weighed after cleaning and patting dried with a paper towel .
after taking fresh weights , plants were dried in an oven at 40 degreesc for two days and weighed .
effect of mesa seed treatment on the bacterial blight disease of rice under greenhouse conditions rice seed treated with mesa were sown in earthen pots .
the potting soil was composed of two parts of autoclaved silt loam soil with one part each of sand and peat moss and maintained under greenhouse conditions .
five replicates of five pots , each containing 5 plants , were maintained. x. oryzae inoculum was sub - cultured and grown individually in nutrient broth for 48 h and then centrifuged for 8000 x g for 15 m and then resuspended in sterile distilled water at 2 x 107 cfu / ml. inoculation was done on twenty - day old plant leaves by scissors - dip method30 .
in each pot , the number of plants showing symptoms was counted and lesion length was measured at 14 days post - inoculation .
the values are represented as percent disease incidence ( di ) ( formula 1 ) and mean lesion length ( mll ) ( formula 2 ) .
mean variance of disease index and disease incidence of five replications containing five plants in each pot were determined by tukey - family error test ( p < 0.05 ) by using minitab ( r ) 17 statistical analysis treatment effects on the percentage of emergence , root and shoot weight , and root : shoot ratio , in rice plants were analyzed by analysis of variance ( one - way anova ) , and the treatment means were compared by tukey - family error test ( p < 0.05 ) by using minitab ( r ) 17 software package .
the data on above said experiments were arcsine transformed ( except percentage of emergence ) before undergoing statistical analysis .

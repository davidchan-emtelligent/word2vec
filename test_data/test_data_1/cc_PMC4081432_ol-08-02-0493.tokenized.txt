tumor development is initiated by an accumulation of numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations that promote tumor initiation , invasion and metastasis .
astrocyte elevated gene - 1 [ aeg - 1 ; also known as metadherin ( mtdh ) and lysine - rich ceacam1 co - isolated ( lyric )] has emerged in recent years as a potentially crucial mediator of tumor malignancy , and a key converging point of a complex network of oncogenic signaling pathways .
aeg - 1 / mtdh has a multifunctional role in tumor development that has been found to be involved in the following signaling cascades : i ) the ha - ras and pi3k / akt pathways ; ii ) the nuclear factor - kappab signaling pathway ; iii ) the erk / mitogen - activated protein kinase and wnt / beta - catenin pathways ; and iv ) the aurora - a kinase signaling pathway .
studies have established that aeg - 1 / mtdh is crucial in tumor progression , including transformation , the evasion of apoptosis , invasion , angiogenesis and metastasis .
in addition , recent clinical studies have convincingly associated aeg - 1 / mtdh with tumor progression and poor prognosis in a number of cancer types , including hepatocellular , esophageal squamous cell , gallbladder and renal cell carcinomas , breast , non - small cell lung , prostate , gastric and colorectal cancers , and glioma , melanoma , neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma .
aeg - 1 / mtdh may be used as a biomarker to identify subgroups of patients who require more intensive treatments and who are likely to benefit from aeg - 1 / mtdh - targeted therapies .
the therapeutic targeting of aeg - 1 / mtdh may simultaneously block metastasis , suppress tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatments .
astrocyte elevated gene - 1 metadherin neoplasms metastasis chemoresistance 1 .
introduction tumor development is initiated by an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations , which promote tumor initiation , invasion and metastasis ( 1,2 ) .
during the development of human neoplasms , the hallmarks of cancer are acquired , including the sustainment of proliferative signaling , the evasion of growth suppressors , the resistance to cell death , the enabling of replicative immortality , the induction of angiogenesis , the activation of invasion and metastasis , genome instability and mutations , the tumor promotion of inflammation , the deregulation of cellular energetics and the avoidance of immune destruction .
these hallmarks aid in our understanding of the diversity of neoplastic disease ( 3 ). with the continuous development of cancer research , our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer has been enhanced .
increasing efforts in cancer research have been focused on the study of oncogenes , tumor suppressors and signaling pathways .
since the development of a more in - depth understanding of the molecular etiology of carcinogenesis , specific oncogenes have been identified and have led to the generation of ' molecular - targeted therapy ' ( 4 ) .
the development of a ' pan - cancer ' therapy may be possible by targeting an oncogene which is ubiquitously overexpressed in almost all types of cancer and has a regulatory role in the multistep processes of carcinogenesis ( 5 ) .
a novel gene that has been identified is aeg - 1 [ also known as metadherin ( mtdh ) and lysine - rich ceacam1 co - isolated ( lyric )] , which has emerged as a potentially crucial mediator of malignant tumors , and a key converging point of a complex network of oncogenic signaling pathways ( 6,7 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh presents as an ideal target for the development of the next generation of effective cancer therapeutics .
2. molecular cloning and structure of aeg - 1 / mtdh aeg - 1 / mtdh was first reported by su et al ( 8 ) in 2002 as a neuropathology - associated gene induced in human fetal astrocytes following human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( hiv - 1 ) infection or treatment with recombinant hiv - 1 envelope glycoprotein ( gp120 ) .
subsequently , kang et al ( 9 ) described the full - length cloning and functional characterization of aeg - 1 / mtdh .
next , brown and ruoslahti ( 10 ) used a phage expression library of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cdna ) from a mouse model of the lung metastasis of breast carcinoma to identify a lung homing peptide in aeg - 1 / mtdh that was overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer and promoted the homing of breast cancer cells to the lungs .
in 2004 , britt et al ( 11 ) and sutherland et al ( 12 ) separately reported a novel protein , lyric , that colocalized with the tight junction protein , zo - 1 , in polarized prostate epithelial cells ( 11 ) and was present in the cytoplasm , endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , perinuclear regions and nucleolus ( 12 ) .
full - length aeg - 1 / mtdh cdna includes 3,611 bp , excluding the poly - a tail ( 9 ) .
the open reading frame from nucleotide 220 to 1,968 of aeg - 1 / mtdh encodes a single pass transmembrane protein ( putative 582 - amino acid ) of ~ 64 kda and with an isoelectric point of 9.33 ( 9 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh orthologues are reported in the majority of vertebrate species , but are not detected in invertebrates. with the exception of three putative lysine - rich nuclear localization signals ( nls ) , aeg - 1 / mtdh has no recognizable protein domains ( 13 ) , and the presence of putative ( monopartite or bipartite ) nls between amino acids 79 - 91 , 432 - 451 and 561 - 580 suggests that it may enter into the nucleus ( 6 ) .
the aeg - 1 / mtdh gene consists of 12 exons / 11 introns , as identified through the use of a genomic blast search ( http :// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / blast.cgi ) , and is located at 8q22 where cytogenetic analysis of human gliomas suggests recurrent amplification ( 9 ) .
in a number of malignancies , such as malignant glioma ( 14 ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) ( 15 ) and breast cancer ( 16 ) , the location is significant .
in hcc and breast cancer , genomic amplification of aeg - 1 / mtdh has been found in patients ( 15,16 ) .
several protein motif analysis methods have predicted that aeg - 1 / mtdh has a single transmembrane domain ( 9 - 12 ). with regard to whether aeg - 1 / mtdh is a type i b membrane protein ( with a cytoplasmic c - terminal without a signal peptide ) ( 9,11,12 ) or a type ii protein ( with an extracytoplasmic c - terminal ) ( 10,11 ) , considerable debate remains .
in recent years , functional and clinical evidence significantly support an important function of aeg - 1 / mtdh in cancer development , including transformation , the evasion of apoptosis , invasion and metastasis ( 13 ) .
however , a generous amount of research is required to fully characterize the molecular and biochemical properties of aeg - 1 / mtdh .
3. oncogenic functions of aeg - 1 / mtdh aeg - 1 / mtdh mrna is ubiquitously expressed at varying levels in all organs , as determined by multi - tissue northern blotting ( 9 ) .
the potential role of aeg - 1 / mtdh is to promote tumor progression and metastasis in human hcc cell lines and colorectal cancer ( crc ) ( 17,18 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh localizes in the cell membrane , cytoplasm , er and nucleus , and contributes to a group of signaling pathways , such as the pi3k - akt , nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) , mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) and wnt pathways ( 19 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh is seminal in regulating proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , metastasis and chemoresistance , as determined by ' gain - of - function ' and ' loss - of - function ' studies in human cancer cells and through the analysis of a transgenic mouse model ( 20 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh promotes tumorigenesis by modulating multiple signal transduction pathways and altering gene expression changes ( fig. 1 ) .
integration of oncogenic pathways overexpression of aeg - 1 / mtdh synergizes with oncogenic ha - ras to enhance the soft agar colony formation of non - tumorigenic immortalized melanocytes and provides evidence of the tumor promoting activity of aeg - 1 / mtdh ( 9 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh expression is markedly induced by ha - ras , which activates the pi3k / akt pathway leading to the binding of the transcription factor , c - myc , to the e - box element in the promoter region of aeg - 1 / mtdh and the regulation of aeg - 1 / mtdh transcription ( 21 ) .
aeg - 1 overexpression inhibits serum starvation - induced apoptosis by activating the ras and pi3k - akt signaling pathways ( 22 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh is also crucial in the carcinogenesis of non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) and inhibits apoptosis by enhancing the level of the antiapoptotic protein , bcl - 2 , and activating the pi3k / akt pathway ( 23 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh also downregulates the transcriptional activity of forkhead box ( foxo ) 1 through the pi3k / akt signaling pathway in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 435 breast cancer cells ( 24 ) .
in addition , aeg - 1 / mtdh is important in the aggressiveness of nsclc through the activation of the pi3k - akt and nf - kappab signaling pathways ( 25 ) .
emdad et al ( 26 ) first reported that aeg - 1 / mtdh promotes the anchorage - independent growth and invasion of hela cells by activating the nf - kappab pathway .
at the mrna and protein levels , aeg - 1 / mtdh is upregulated during crc development and aggressiveness ( from normal mucosa to primary crc , followed by lymph node metastasis and finally liver metastasis ) through the nf - kappab signaling pathway ( 27 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh contributes to the chemoresistance of cervical cancer cells by increasing autophagy and the activation of the erk / nf - kappab pathway ( 28 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh also modulates the bccipalpha protein levels in prostate tumor cells through an indirect mechanism involving the nf - kappab signaling pathway ( 29 ) .
in malignant glioma cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh regulates invasion and migration through activation of the nf - kappab signaling pathway ( 30 ) , in which aeg - 1 / mtdh is involved in the lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - induced inflammatory response ( 31 ) and mediates the lps - induced migration and invasion of breast cancer cells ( 32 ) .
in human hcc cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh activates the mapk pathways , including erk and p38 mapk , and is also associated with the wnt / beta - catenin pathway through the activation of the raf / mek / mapk branch of the ras signaling pathway ( 15 ) .
in proximal tubular epithelial cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh is important in tgf - beta1 - induced epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) through activation of p38 mapk ( 33 ) .
a recent study has suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh contributes to the pathogenesis of diffuse large b - cell lymphoma mediated through regulation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway ( 34 ) .
furthermore , in the carcinogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , a novel functional link has been revealed between aeg - 1 / mtdh and aurora a kinase ( aurka ) with regard to akt1 activation ( 35 ) .
in human aml cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression is vital for the maintenance of the malignant state via upregulation of akt1 , which is mediated by aurka activation ( 35 ) .
in breast cancer cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh facilitates cancer proliferation and invasion by upregulating her2 / neu expression ( 36 ) .
angiogenesis and metastasis aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression converts non - tumorigenic human hcc cells into highly aggressive vascular tumors .
in addition , aeg - 1 / mtdh modulates the expression of genes associated with invasion , angiogenesis , metastasis , chemoresistance and senescence , as determined by microarray analysis ( 15 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh has a dominant function in regulating oncogenic transformation and angiogenesis ( 37 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh expression is also increased in multiple cancers and is crucial in oncogenic transformation and angiogenesis ( 38 - 41 ) .
in a phage display study , brown and ruoslahti ( 10 ) identified that a lung homing domain ( amino acids 378 - 440 in mice and 381 - 443 in humans ) in aeg - 1 / mtdh was a mediator of 4t1 mouse mammary tumor cell adhesion to the lung vasculature , and suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh is important in breast cancer metastasis .
in crc , jiang et al ( 18 ) showed that aeg - 1 / mtdh is overexpressed in liver metastasis patients compared with patients without liver metastasis .
in addition , aeg - 1 / mtdh may present as a potential novel biomarker for early liver metastasis .
in a large proportion of epithelial ovarian cancer patients with peritoneal dissemination and / or lymph node metastasis , aeg - 1 / mtdh is overexpressed and is a novel predictor of metastasis ( 42 ) .
in summary , aeg - 1 / mtdh is crucial in lymph node metastasis ( 39,43 - 45 ) and contributes to tumor progression , including transformation , the evasion of apoptosis , invasion and metastasis ( 13 ) .
chemoresistance one of the important hallmarks of aggressive cancers is chemoresistance .
previous studies have suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh contributes to a broad spectrum of resistance to various chemotherapeutics , including 5 - fluorouracil , doxorubicin , paclitaxel , cisplatin and 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide ( 16,46 - 48 ) .
in human hcc cells , the gene expression profiles of overexpressed aeg - 1 / mtdh have been identified in several drug - metabolizing enzymes involved in chemoresistance , including dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , cytochrome p450b6 , dihydrodiol dehydrogenase , atp - binding cassette transporter 11 / mrp8 and transcription factor lsf / tfcp2 ( 15 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh increases multidrug - resistance gene 1 ( mdr1 ) protein expression , which facilitates the association between mdr1 mrna and polysomes , leading to increased translation , the inhibition of ubiquitination and the resultant proteasome - mediated degradation of the mdr1 protein ( 47 ) .
the inhibition of aeg - 1 / mtdh may be an effective method in hcc chemotherapy ( 47 ) .
bhutia et al ( 49 ) also showed that protective autophagy is the cause of aeg - 1 - mediated chemoresistance , and that the inhibition of aeg - 1 / mtdh results in a decrease in the protective autophagy and chemosensitization of cancer cells .
due to the multiple functions of aeg - 1 / mtdh in drug resistance , aeg - 1 / mtdh is a viable target as an anticancer agent for a wide range of cancer types ( 50 ) .
recent results have also indicated that aeg - 1 / mtdh affects the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells ( 51 ) .
in summary , it has become apparent that aeg - 1 / mtdh is an important oncogene , which is overexpressed in numerous human cancer types. through a number of signaling cascades , aeg - 1 / mtdh is involved in several crucial aspects of tumor progression , including transformation , proliferation , the evasion of apoptosis , cell survival , migration and invasion , angiogenesis , metastasis and chemoresistance ( 52 ) .
future studies are required to evaluate the correlation between aeg - 1 / mtdh function and signaling changes and interacting partners in order to highlight novel perspectives for aeg - 1 / mtdh as a significant target for the clinical treatment of various cancers .
4. clinical - translational advances in keeping with the role of aeg - 1 / mtdh in a number of different aspects of malignancy , aeg - 1 / mtdh has been found to correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis in a number of cancer types , including hcc ( 17,53 - 58 ) and breast ( 59 - 64 ) , prostate ( 65 - 67 ) , glioma ( 68 - 70 ) and esophageal cancer ( 71 ) ( table i ) .
these studies indicate that aeg - 1 / mtdh may be a powerful independent marker for poor prognosis and a viable target for anticancer therapeutics .
hcc using transgenic mice with hepatocyte - specific aeg - 1 / mtdh expression , a previous study identified novel aspects of aeg - 1 / mtdh functions , including the induction of steatosis , the inhibition of senescence and the activation of the coagulation pathway to augment aggressive hepatocarcinogenesis ( 53 ) .
the results suggested that the expression of the aeg - 1 / mtdh protein was significantly higher in cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential , such as sk - hep - 1 and mhcc - 97h , than in those with low metastatic potential , such as hepg2 and huh7 .
additionally , aeg - 1 / mtdh has been shown to be closely associated with the abilities of the orientation chemotaxis and adhesion of hcc cells ( 17 ) .
in hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) - related hcc patients , aeg - 1 / mtdh expression has been found to significantly correlate with the american joint committee on cancer ( 7th edition ) ( 72 ) stage , t and n classification , vascular invasion and histological differentiation ( 54 ) .
in addition , patients with high aeg - 1 / mtdh levels have been found to exhibit poor survival rates compared with those with low aeg - 1 / mtdh levels ( 54 ) .
in hbv - related hcc patients , aeg - 1 / mtdh is a potential prognostic marker for overall survival ( os ) and tumor progression , and is a chemotherapeutic target ( 54 ) .
in hcc tumors , the high expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh has also been found to correlate with microvascular invasion , pathological satellites , poor differentiation and tumor - node - metastasis ( tnm ) stages ii to iii .
furthermore , aeg - 1 / mtdh promotes hcc metastasis through induction of the emt process ( 55 ) .
in a nude mouse model , the shrna - mediated downregulation of aeg - 1 / mtdh resulted in reduced migratory capacity in hcc cell lines , and also reduced the number of abdominal and pulmonary metastases ( 55 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression and staphylococcal nuclease domain - containing 1 ( snd1 ) lead to increased levels of rna - induced silencing complex activity and contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis ( 56 ) .
additionally , aeg - 1 / mtdh is a prognostic predictor of hcc following curative hepatectomy ( 57 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has been identified in a high percentage of hepatitis b and c virus - positive hcc cases , and is key in the regulation of hepatocarcinogenesis ( 58 ) .
in summary , the aeg - 1 / mtdh gene is amplified in human hcc patients and promotes chemoresistance , angiogenesis and metastasis .
gastric cancer the high expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh is observed in gastric cancer tissues .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression is associated with tnm stage ( tnm classification of malignant tumors ) ( 73 ) , ki - 67 proliferation index and poor survival , and is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer in multivariate analysis ( 74 ) .
inhibition of aeg - 1 / mtdh expression by specific small interfering rna ( sirna ) clearly inhibits sgc - 7901 cell growth and enhances cell apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of akt and glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta , and decreasing the levels of beta - catenin , lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 and cyclin d1 ( 74 ) .
furthermore , the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest in gastric carcinoma sgc - 7901 cells , mediated by the downregulation of aeg - 1 / mtdh expression , may be closely associated with changes in the expression of cell cycle - related proteins , including cdk2 , cyclin d1 and p21 ( 75 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression is a useful prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer , and the inhibition of aeg - 1 / mtdh may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer .
however , in iranian patients , aeg - 1 / mtdh mrna expression was significantly elevated in 46.6 % of examined tumor tissues , while its expression was low in others ( 36.6 %) ( 76 ) .
there is only a marginal statistical difference between the aeg - 1 / mtdh gene expression in all tumor specimens compared with their paired non - tumor specimens , and no statistically significant association has been identified between the grades and types of tumors ( 76 ) .
at the transcriptional level , aeg - 1 / mtdh levels may be increased in gastric cancer tissue samples , but with considerable heterogeneity , and it may have the potential to be used as a target for diagnostic / therapeutic purposes only in a subset of patients ( 76 ) .
therefore , the status of aeg - 1 / mtdh expression and its significance in gastric cancer remains unclear and requires further investigation .
crc snd1 is a novel aeg - 1 / mtdh - interacting protein , and a functionally and clinically significant mediator of metastasis in breast cancer ( 77 ) .
in colon cancer tissues , a positive correlation has been identified between aeg - 1 / mtdh and snd1 expression by immunohistochemical staining ; aeg - 1 / mtdh - and snd1 - positive expression has been found to significantly correlate with nodal status , pathological stage and differentiation ( 78 ) .
furthermore , os time in colon cancer patients with positive aeg - 1 / mtdh and snd1 expression is significantly shorter than in those without aeg - 1 / mtdh and snd1 expression ( 78 ) .
the positive expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh and snd1 is an independent poor prognostic predictor in colon cancer , as observed by multivariate cox regression analysis , and the increased expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh and / or snd1 is closely associated with the carcinogenesis , progression and prognosis of colon cancer ( 78 ) .
in predicting the prognosis of colon cancer , the coexpression of aeg - 1 / mtdh / snd1 may be a novel distinctive marker .
during crc development and aggressiveness , the aeg - 1 / mtdh mrna and protein levels are upregulated and have been associated with tumor location and stage ( 27 ) .
zhang et al ( 79 ) was the first to show that aeg - 1 / mtdh interacts with beta - catenin in sw480 crc cell lines and that aeg - 1 / mtdh expression closely correlates with the progression of crc .
the aforementioned studies also suggest that aeg - 1 / mtdh may be a potential therapeutic target in crc .
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( escc ) immunohistochemical analysis of 168 escc specimens revealed that 47.6 % of tumors exhibit high levels of aeg - 1 / mtdh expression ( 71 ) .
in escc patients , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has been found to significantly correlate with the tnm stage , histological differentiation and a shorter survival time , and is an independent poor prognostic indicator , as determined by multivariate analysis ( 71 ) .
gallbladder carcinoma ( gbc ) high aeg - 1 / mtdh expression is present in highly invasive gbc - sd cell lines at the protein and mrna levels , and in gbc samples ( 63.4 %) compared with normal gallbladder mucosa .
in addition , aeg - 1 / mtdh has been found to markedly correlate with differentiation degree , nevin stage ( 80 ) , ki - 67 expression and liver infiltration ( 81 ) .
in gbc patients , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression leads to a shorter survival time and is an independent prognostic marker , as determined by multivariate analysis ( 81 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh is a useful marker of gbc progression and may be a potential therapeutic target .
the immunohistochemical analysis of 96 benign and 108 malignant lesions of the gallbladder revealed that the positive expression of erythropoietin - producing hepatoma - amplified sequence receptor a7 ( epha7 ) and aeg - 1 / mtdh is significantly higher in gallbladder adenocarcinoma than in benign lesions ( 82 ) .
in gallbladder adenocarcinoma , the positive expression of epha7 and aeg - 1 / mtdh has been found to significantly correlate with differentiation , tumor masses , lymph node metastasis , invasion and os , and is an independent poor prognostic predictor , as determined by multivariate analysis ( 82 ) .

breast cancer aeg - 1 / mtdh is expressed at low levels or is absent in the majority of normal human breast tissues , but is frequently overexpressed in ductal carcinoma in situ ( 83 ) , breast cancer cell lines or breast tumors ( 9,10,16,59 ) .
the analyses of breast tumor samples collected in the usa and japan revealed strikingly similar patterns of aeg - 1 / mtdh expression and clinical association ( 16,59 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression is significantly associated with estrogen receptor - and progesterone receptor - negative expression , a high nuclear grade , poor disease - free survival , a high ki67 index , poor distant metastasis - free survival and poor os ( 59 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has a particularly negative impact on the prognosis of node - negative patients and is independently associated with poor disease - free and distant metastasis - free survival rates , as determined by multivariate analysis ( 59 ) .
li et al ( 60 ) showed that aeg - 1 / mtdh may promote emt in breast cancer cells in driving the progression of their aggressive behavior .
furthermore , li et al ( 61 ) assessed the variants of the aeg - 1 / mtdh gene and their potential association with breast cancer susceptibility .
the study discovered nine novel variants and found two variants to be associated with the susceptibility of breast cancer .
aeg - 1 / mtdh has a dual function in promoting chemoresistance and metastasis , and is a key functional target of the 8q22 genomic gain that is frequently observed in breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis ( 62 ) .
in summary , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression contributes to an aggressive phenotype , leading to a poor prognosis in primary invasive breast cancer .
blocking aeg - 1 / mtdh and its regulated pathways is likely to be beneficial in breast cancer cells or tissues ( 63,64 ) .
nsclc in nsclc cell lines and tissues , aeg - 1 / mtdh has a crucial function in the aggressiveness leading to a poor clinical prognosis ( 25 ) and promotes nsclc metastasis by modulating matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) expression ( 84 ) .
in nsclc , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has been found to significantly correlate with clinical staging , differentiation , lymph node metastasis and a shorter os time ( 23 ) .
in l - 78 cells , a previous study observed that aeg - 1 / mtdh sirna treatment significantly upregulated caspase - 3 , markedly decreased bcl - 2 , largely attenuated pi3k p110 protein expression and phosphorylated akt ( 23 ) .
these results suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh is crucial in the carcinogenesis of nsclc and that it inhibits apoptosis by enhancing the level of antiapoptotic protein , bcl - 2 , and activating the pi3k / akt pathway ( 23 ) .
renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) a markedly higher expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh was identified in eight cases of rcc tissue compared with the paired normal tissue from the same patient by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis ( 85 ) .
at the mrna and protein levels , the expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh was also increased in four rcc cell lines , in contrast to normal tubular epithelial human kidney hk 2 cells ( 85 ) .
furthermore , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has been found to significantly correlate with tumor grade , clinical staging , t classification , metastasis classification and a shorter survival time , as determined by immunohistochemical analysis ( 85 ) .
a microarray study showed that high aeg - 1 / mtdh and p53 expression correlate with the prognostic parameters in rcc patients and may be associated with tumor progression ( 86 ) .
in conclusion , the aeg - 1 / mtdh protein is overexpressed in rcc and is important in tumor differentiation and progression .
prostate cancer ( pc ) a significantly higher expression of aeg - 1 / mtdh has been identified in pc samples and cell lines compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue samples and normal prostate epithelial cells ( 65,66 ) .
the knockdown of aeg - 1 / mtdh induces pc cell apoptosis through upregulation of foxo3a activity , and also attenuates the constitutive activity of nf - kappab and activator protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) , with a corresponding depletion in the expression of nf - kappab and ap - 1 - regulated genes .
knockdown also significantly decreases the cell invasion properties of pc - 3 and du145 pc cells ( 66 ) .
recent findings have suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh is overexpressed in pc cells and that cryptotanshinone exerts antitumor activity via inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha , aeg - 1 / mtdh and vascular endothelial growth factor in hypoxic pc - 3 cells ( 67 ) .
glioma oncogenic aeg - 1 / mtdh is overexpressed in > 90 % of brain tumors and promotes gliomagenesis , particularly tumor growth and invasion , two primary characteristics of glioma ( 68 ) .
lee et al ( 68 ) found that aeg - 1 / mtdh contributes to glioma - induced neurodegeneration , a hallmark of this fatal tumor , by regulating eaat2 expression .
liu et al ( 69 ) suggested that aeg - 1 / mtdh expression significantly correlates with the clinicopathological stage of the glioma and contributes to glioma progression by enhancing mmp - 9 transcription and promoting tumor cell invasiveness .
aeg - 1 / mtdh expression is significantly elevated in > 90 % of diverse human brain tumor samples , including glioblastoma multiformes and astrocytic tumors , and in human glioma cell lines compared with normal brain tissues and normal astrocytes , as determined by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry ( 70 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh may have a crucial function in the pathogenesis of glioma and may represent a viable potential target for malignant glioma therapy .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression has also been documented in melanoma ( 9 ) , neuroblastoma ( 48 ) , osteosarcoma ( 87 ) and ovarian cancer ( 42,88,89 ) , as well as in other tumors .
however , certain controversy exists regarding the localization of the aeg - 1 / mtdh protein in the nucleus or cytoplasm of cancer cells , and the utility of nuclear or cytoplasmic aeg - 1 / mtdh to predict the course and prognosis of disease ( 20 ) .
future studies are required to evaluate aeg - 1 / mdth interaction partners in various cancer types and their significance in cancer progression .
in summary , aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression markedly correlates with advanced tumor characteristics and a poor clinical prognosis , and is a promising target for novel therapeutics .
5. clinical translation and therapeutic targeting strategy aeg - 1 / mtdh inhibition may be an effective anticancer strategy , considering that aeg - 1 / mtdh is overexpressed in a variety of cancer types and regulates the fundamental processes of carcinogenesis .
aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression can be utilized to identify subgroups of patients who require more intense treatments and who are likely to benefit from aeg - 1 / mtdh - targeted therapies .
patients with aeg - 1 / mtdh overexpression or amplification in different tumors may potentially suffer from metastatic recurrence and require close monitoring for clinical signs of relapse for early therapeutic intervention .
high - risk patients require a higher dose of chemotherapy , the efficacy of which may be increased through the combination of chemotherapy with aeg - 1 / mtdh inhibition .
based on the molecular targeting of aeg - 1 / mtdh , novel cancer treatments consist of several possible avenues .
aeg - 1 / mtdh - knockdown in mg - 63 osteosarcoma cells significantly decreases et - 1 expression ( at the mrna and protein levels ) , cell invasion , mmp - 2 expression and cell survival against cisplatin ( 87 ) .
transfection of a recombinant plasmid containing pcdna - aeg - 1 / mtdh - microrna ( mir ) - 4 significantly suppresses aeg - 1 / mtdh at the mrna and protein levels by > 69 % in mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells , and significantly inhibits proliferation , motility and migration compared with controls ( 90 ) .
silencing aeg - 1 / mtdh expression by rna interference was found to effectively reduce metastasis by 3 - to 10 - fold in a mda - mb - 231 xenograft model of breast cancer lung metastasis , and it was also shown to sensitize chemoresistant mda - mb - 231 breast tumors to paclitaxel or doxorubicin ( 16 ) .
ward et al ( 91 ) observed that aeg - 1 / mtdh is a direct target of mir - 375 , and that aeg - 1 / mtdh - knockdown partially phenocopies the effects of mir - 375 on the sensitivity to tamoxifen and the reversal of emt in breast cancer .
the treatment of tamoxifen - resistant breast cancer may be aided by the development of potential therapeutic approaches , such as the re - expression of mir - 375 or the targeting of aeg - 1 / mtdh ( 91 ) .
in breast cancer cells , aeg - 1 / mtdh - mirna may be important in the downregulation of proliferation , motility and migration , and must be used as a future potential small molecule inhibitor therapeutic targeting strategy .
aeg - 1 / mtdh - knockdown decreases nuclear beta - catenin accumulation and suppresses the migration and invasion of sw620 colorectal carcinoma cell lines ( 79 ) .
adenoviral delivery of aeg - 1 / mtdh - targeting shrna inhibits xenograft primary tumor growth in hcc mice ( 15 ) .
the inhibition of aeg - 1 / mtdh in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings not only increases the response rate of chemotherapy , but also reduces tumor growth and the systemic spread of metastatic cancer ( 13 ) .
in mda - mb231 human breast cancer cells , exposure to cadmium chloride affects aeg - 1 / mtdh expression ( 92 ) .
current and future studies must focus on the translational aspects of aeg - 1 / mtdh , and on the understanding of aeg - 1 / mtdh function in physiological and pathological processes using transgenic and knockout mouse models in cancer .
the knockdown of aeg - 1 / mtdh ( 32,33,41,45,51,93,94 ) or aeg - 1 / mtdh inhibition ( 92,95,96 ) can inhibit transformation , proliferation , the evasion of apoptosis , migration and invasion , metastasis , angiogenesis and chemoresistance .
in summary , the functional characterization of aeg - 1 / mtdh as a novel protein with poorly - characterized functions is urgently required to realize its full therapeutic potential .
6. conclusion and future perspectives accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aeg - 1 / mtdh has clear functions in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes ( 97 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh is an extremely important molecule for the regulation of a variety of pathological and physiological processes by modulating the transcription and translation of factors involved in the signaling pathways ( 97 ) .
it is clear that aeg - 1 / mtdh has a decisive role in the process of tumorigenesis in multiple models , as determined by in vitro and in vivo studies and expression analysis ( 98 ) .
the multiple functions of aeg - 1 / mtdh highlight several important clinical implications .
aeg - 1 / mtdh , as a ubiquitous biomarker for aggressive tumors , may be used for the routine screening of patients ( 13 ) .
aeg - 1 / mtdh is an important regulator in multiple aspects of cancer development and progression .
clinical and functional analyses suggest that the multifunctional gene , aeg - 1 / mtdh , is a potentially valuable target in cancer treatments .
chen et al ( 99 ) showed that the anti - aeg - 1 autoantibody response may be a diagnostic biomarker for cancer patients with aeg - 1 - positive expression , and a possible inducer , with substantial immunity against aeg - 1 by immunization boosting with aeg - 1 vaccines .
in a therapeutic model , the aeg - 1 / mtdh vaccine increased the chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and inhibited breast cancer lung metastasis ( 100 ) .
the aeg - 1 / mtdh vaccine in combination with chemotherapy may offer novel strategies for the treatment of cancer metastasis .
in conclusion , aeg - 1 / mtdh is a valuable diagnostic or prognostic biomarker based on its overexpression and correlations with disease staging and outcome throughout a wide range of cancer types .
however , larger patient studies and a prospective investigation on the correlation between aeg - 1 / mtdh mrna or protein in the blood and circulating tumor cells , and in urine and biopsy samples compared with clinical characteristics are urgently required .

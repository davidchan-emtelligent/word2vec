angina , stable / complications coronary vasoespasm acute coronary syndrome coronary angiography a 56 - year - old caucasian male , came to our hospital complaining of thoracic oppression at exertion and sometimes occurring at rest , lasting for a few minutes .
the patient was an active smoker , with a moderate alcohol consumption habit and had had an episode of unstable angina two months earlier .
at that episode , two drug - eluting stents were implanted , one in the distal anterior descending artery and the other in the proximal first diagonal artery .
the ecg showed mild st - elevation in v1 - v3 and a t - wave inversion in v3 - v5 .
there was a slight increase in troponin i up to 0.24 ng / ml but the blood tests were otherwise unremarkable .
the patient was admitted at the coronary unit and was scheduled for urgent coronary angiogram .
the exam revealed severe and diffuse stenosis in the territories of the right and left coronary arteries with slow flow ( timi 1 - 2 ) , sparing only the stented segments ( picture / video 1 ) .
the administration of 2 mg of intracoronary isosorbite dinitrate reverted all the stenosis but slow flow ( timi 2 ) was still observed in the left coronary artery .
hence , the diagnosis of vasospastic angina was made .
the patient was successfully controlled with calcium antagonists and has remained asymptomatic .
vasospastic angina is commonly misinterpreted as acute coronary syndrome .
although its pathophysiology is not fully understood , it usually has a favorable long - term prognosis , although coronary artery spasms may have an important role in arrhythmia generation and subsequent cardiac arrest .

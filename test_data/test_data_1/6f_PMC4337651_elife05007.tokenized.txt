heterochromatin exerts a heritable form of eukaryotic gene repression and contributes to chromosome segregation fidelity and genome stability .
however , to date there has been no quantitative evaluation of the stability of heterochromatic gene repression .
we designed a genetic strategy to capture transient losses of gene silencing in saccharomyces as permanent , heritable changes in genotype and phenotype .
this approach revealed rare transcription within heterochromatin that occurred in approximately 1 / 1000 cell divisions .
in concordance with multiple lines of evidence suggesting these events were rare and transient , single - molecule rna fish showed that transcription was limited .
the ability to monitor fluctuations in heterochromatic repression uncovered previously unappreciated roles for sir1 , a silencing establishment factor , in the maintenance and / or inheritance of silencing .
in addition , we identified the sirtuin hst3 and its histone target as contributors to the stability of the silenced state .
these approaches revealed dynamics of a heterochromatin function that have been heretofore inaccessible .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.001 elife digest a single cell from a plant , an animal or another eukaryote can contain several meters of dna .
in order to fit this length inside the nucleus of the cell , the dna is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure known as chromatin .
chromatin exists in two forms : loosely packed chromatin tends to contain the genes that are expressed in cells , whereas highly compacted chromatin ( also called heterochromatin ) silences the expression of most nearby genes .
adding small chemical markings to histone proteins can alter how much the chromatin is compacted , and newly formed cells can inherit these markings whenever a cell divides .
this enables the new cell to essentially ' remember ' which genes were active and which were repressed in the original cell .
however , no one has measured how stable heterochromatin is over multiple cell divisions ; as such it is unclear if genes that should remain silent are occasionally expressed after a cell has divided a number of times .
budding yeast is a well - established model for studying heterochromatin .
the genome of this single - celled organism has distinct regions of highly compacted chromatin , which are established and maintained by a number of different proteins .
dodson and rine have developed a new technique to detect when gene silencing is lost in individual yeast cells , even if the loss of silencing only occurs for a brief period .
this approach revealed that genes in supposedly ' silent ' heterochromatin were still expressed but only very rarely - - in about 1 in every 1000 cell divisions .
dodson and rine 's findings suggest that when silencing is lost , it is promptly re - established with the aid of a protein called sir1 .
in addition , the new technique revealed that sir1 helps to prevent losses of silencing in the first place .
as such , the sir1 protein appears to have previously unappreciated roles in the maintenance and the inheritance of heterochromatin in dividing yeast cells .
dodson and rine also discovered that a protein called hst3 - - which acts to remove chemical markings from histone proteins - - also helps stabilize the silenced state. with this technique in hand , it is now possible to test any molecule , environment , or cellular process for its potential effect on the stability of gene silencing .

introduction heterochromatin is a heritable , condensed chromatin structure that silences the expression of most genes within or near it. phenomena such as clonal inheritance of inactivated x - chromosomes in female mammals , as well as position - effect variegation in drosophila and yeast , demonstrate the remarkable ability of cells to propagate heterochromatic repression through mitosis .
as an epigenetic state , heterochromatic gene repression provides a means for genetically identical cells to differentiate into stable , distinct cell types .
however , despite its significance , little is known about the dynamics of heterochromatic repression and which factors contribute to or disrupt its stability .
in saccharomyces cerevisiae , heterochromatin forms at the silent mating - type loci , hml and hmr , through the recruitment and subsequent spreading of sir proteins ( grunstein and gasser , 2013 ) .
dna elements known as the e and i silencers flank each locus and nucleate complexes of sir2 , sir3 and sir4 .
sir complexes then deacetylate histones and bind nucleosomes throughout the region , thereby rendering hml and hmr transcriptionally silenced and largely inaccessible to dna - interacting proteins .
since each locus contains either a or alpha mating - type information , as does the mat locus , heterochromatic repression of hml and hmr ensures that the mat genotype is the only determinant of whether haploids mate as a or alpha cells .
following its initial establishment , sir - mediated heterochromatin can be maintained through the g1 , g2 and m phases and inherited through s phase .
sir2 , sir3 and sir4 are essential for all aspects of silencing ( rine and herskowitz , 1987 ) .
thus , mutants lacking any of these proteins express hml and hmr to the level of the transcriptionally active mat locus .
in contrast , mutants lacking sir1 exhibit a bistable silencing phenotype ( pillus and rine , 1989 ; xu et al. , 2006 ) .
within a population of sir1 cells , hml and hmr exist in one of two phenotypic states : silenced or expressed .
each state is heritable for multiple cell divisions , demonstrating the epigenetic nature of sir - mediated heterochromatin and inspiring the notion that sir1 functions in the establishment of silencing , but not the maintenance or inheritance thereafter .
notably , rare switches occur between the two expression states of hml and hmr in sir1 mutants , during which silencing is either lost or established .
if sir1 functioned exclusively in establishment , then losses of silencing should also occur in wild - type cells , yet no such event has been detected .
wild - type expression levels of genes at the hml and hmr loci are 1000 - fold lower than the expression levels of the same genes when at the mat locus , and efforts to detect expression of hml and hmr by any molecular method have shown the expression signal is indistinguishable from background noise .
moreover , 100 % of mata cells respond to alpha - factor , and diploids homozygous at the mat locus are completely unable to sporulate .
thus , by all previous molecular criteria , the silent mating - type loci are transcriptionally inert .
however , heterochromatin undergoes regular exchange of at least some of its structural components with newly synthesized molecules of the same proteins ( cheng and gartenberg , 2000 ; festenstein et al. , 2003 ; cheutin et al. , 2003 ; ficz et al. , 2005 ) and is subject to perturbations , such as its replication in s phase .
these fluctuations in heterochromatin structure imply that either the mechanism of silencing compensates for these changes and flawlessly reassembles each cell cycle , or that there are rare , as yet undetected losses of silencing resulting from heterochromatin dynamics .
to address whether rna polymerase ever succeeds in transcribing silent chromatin at hml and hmr , we designed an assay capable of detecting short - lived gene expression with single - cell resolution. by capturing the consequences of transcription with a permanent , heritable mark , we detected transient losses of silencing at hml and hmr in wild - type cells , characterized the nature of these losses , and identified genetic determinants of heterochromatin stability .
results to determine the stability of gene repression in heterochromatin , we placed the gene encoding the cre recombinase under control of the alpha2 promoter at either hmlalpha or hmralpha ( figure 1a ) .
rna measurements made by quantitative rt - pcr showed that cre was as repressed as the native alpha2 gene at this location ( figure 1b ) .
on chromosome v of both the hmlalpha : : cre and hmralpha : : cre strains , we integrated a sequence in which two loxp sites flanked the rfp gene and the selectable drug marker kanmx ( figure 1a ) .
the loxp - rfp - kanmx - loxp sequence resided downstream of the strong gpd promoter and upstream of a promoterless gfp gene .
thus , cells carrying this rfp - gfp cassette were rfp - positive , drug resistant , and gfp - negative .
however , in the event that cre repression were lost , the resulting cre protein could mediate recombination at the loxp sites , thereby excising the rfp and kanmx genes and positioning the gfp gene adjacent to the promoter ( figure 1a ) .
it should be noted that the recombination event would be essentially irreversible in that the excised dna lacked an origin of replication and would thereby be lost upon cell division .
therefore , the transient expression of cre would trigger a permanent switch to gfp expression and drug sensitivity in that cell and in all of its descendants. by convention , we refer to cells expressing rfp as red , and cells expressing gfp as green .

to determine the fold repression , mrna levels were also measured in hmlalpha and hmlalpha : : cre strains lacking sir3 ( jry9624 and jry9626 ) .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.003 transient losses of silencing detected at hml and hmr after plating cells with the cre gene at either hml or hmr on non - selective medium , we imaged the fluorescence of the resulting colonies .
we first tested whether the expression of cre from the alpha2 promoter would produce enough recombinase to cause an efficient rfp - to - gfp switch by adding the sir2 inhibitor nicotinamide ( nam ) to the medium .
the nicotinamide - induced derepression of either hmlalpha : : cre or hmralpha : : cre resulted in entirely green colonies ( figure 2a and figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
in contrast , cells that contained the rfp - gfp cassette but lacked any source of the cre gene grew into colonies that were entirely red ( figure 2a and figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
these observations were consistent with the quantification of gfp fluorescence by flow cytometry ( figure 2b ) .
therefore , expression of the cre gene at either hml or hmr was both necessary and sufficient for the switch from rfp to gfp expression .
we then plated hmlalpha : : cre and hmralpha : : cre cells on medium lacking nicotinamide to determine the stability of gene silencing under normal conditions .
the resulting colonies were predominantly red , indicating the majority of cells maintained the repression of cre throughout growth of the colony ( figure 2a ) .
within these colonies , however , we observed discrete green sectors , each of which represented a loss - of - silencing event that occurred in a cell at the vertex of the sector ( figure 2a and figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
although the switch to gfp expression was irreversible , some of the smaller sectors did not extend to the edge of the colony , likely due to a combination of genetic drift ( hallatschek et al. , 2007 ) and the nature of three - dimensional growth of the colony .
gfp expression was also detectable by flow cytometry in a fraction of hmlalpha : : cre and hmralpha : : cre cells ( figure 2b ) .
thus , silent chromatin at hml and hmr was transcriptionally dynamic , exhibiting losses of silencing below the level of detection by all previous assays .

( c ) quantitative rt - pcr measurements of hmlalpha : : cre transcription in red and green sectors .
to determine whether silencing loss was transient , cre and gfp mrna levels were quantified in the gfp - expressing ( green ) and rfp - expressing ( red ) regions of a colony of cells containing hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette ( jry9628 ) .
three independent experiments were performed , each on a different colony with a large green sector .
cells from the red and green regions of each colony were grown to log phase in ypd and harvested for rna isolation .
as a positive control for hmlalpha : : cre expression , mrna levels were also measured in a sir2delta mutant ( jry9633 ) .
all mrna values were normalized to act1 mrna values .
expression levels are shown relative to the corresponding sir2delta values ( set to 1 ) ( orange dotted line ) .

scale bar , 2 mm. doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.005 at least two lines of evidence indicated that these losses of silencing were transient and did not arise from mutations in sir genes .
first , cre and gfp mrna levels were measured in both red and green regions from within the same colony .
if the loss - of - silencing event that resulted in the green sector were temporary , then the level of hmlalpha : : cre repression would be indistinguishable between red and green sectors .
alternatively , if the loss of silencing were permanent , then cre mrna would be detectable in cells from the green sector .
consistent with the efficiency of heterochromatin formation , which occurs de novo in approximately 1 - 2 cell divisions ( osborne et al. , 2009 ) , hmlalpha : : cre repression was fully restored in the descendants of a cell that experienced a loss of silencing ( figure 2c ) .
the slight difference in gfp expression between wild - type cells from the green sector and sir2delta cells may have been due to the constitutive presence of cre protein in the sir2delta mutant , which could have potentially disrupted transcription by binding the loxp site between the promoter and the gfp gene .
in addition , the gfp mrna values in the red population likely reflected a low level of gfp expression since colonies were grown in the absence of g418 selection and therefore rfp - to - gfp switches occurred at a low rate .
as secondary confirmation that losses of silencing were transient , we have never detected green sectors in colonies of a wild - type strain containing the gfp gene under control of the alpha2 promoter at hmlalpha ( unpublished observations ) .
the pattern of colony fluorescence revealed the history of individual lapses in silencing , with the size of each green sector corresponding to how early the silencing loss occurred during colony growth .
colonies that were half red / half green reflected a loss of cre repression in either the mother or daughter cell of the first division that gave rise to the colony ( figure 3a ) .
therefore , the frequency of half - sectored colonies equaled the rate of rfp - to - gfp switches per cell division .
in the hmlalpha : : cre strain , the frequency of half - sectored colonies was 1.6 x 10 - 3 ( table 1 and figure 3b ) .
thus , for every thousand cells , one to two cells temporarily failed to repress hmlalpha .
silencing of hmralpha was slightly more stable than hmlalpha , with a lower rate of 7 x 10 - 4 losses per division ( p = 0.003 ; student 's t test ) ( table 1 and figure 3b ) .

all strains contained a copy of the rfp - gfp cassette .
see supplementary file 1 for full genotypes .
transient transcription of silent chromatin was restricted to low levels and was captured effectively by the cre - based assay in principle , the rates of rfp - to - gfp switches could be compatible with at least three possible distributions of cre expression .
in one model , cre is transcribed at a low level in many cells , but the resulting level of cre protein is sufficient to catalyze recombination of the rfp - gfp cassette in only a subset of those cells .
alternatively , cre transcription could be completely absent in most cells , but in a low fraction of cells , occur at the same level as in a sir - mutant .
finally , cre transcription may be absent in most cells , and limited even in the small fraction of cells that switch from rfp to gfp expression .
thus far , efforts to detect transcription at hml and hmr have relied on quantitative rt - pcr and other population - based assays that report the average level of rna for all the cells in a sample .
however , advances in rna imaging now enable the quantification of individual transcripts in single cells ( itzkovitz and van oudenaarden , 2011 ) .
using a version of fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) with single - molecule sensitivity ( raj et al. , 2008 ) , we hybridized fixed cells with two sets of probes distinguished by their fluorophore label ( figure 4a ) .
one probe set was specific to the cre rna expressed from hmlalpha : : cre .
as an internal control to account for sample variation , the other probe set was specific to kap104 rna , which encodes a protein involved in nuclear transport .
we measured cre and kap104 transcripts by imaging and quantifying fluorescent spots , each representative of a single rna molecule .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.011 as a positive control , we examined cre transcription in a mutant lacking sir4 , a protein integral to heterochromatin structure .
as expected , hml was transcriptionally active in the sir4delta mutant ( figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) , with a mean of 12 cre transcripts per cell (+/ - 2 standard error of the mean [ sem ] calculated from three independent experiments ) , and 98 % (+/ - 1 sem ) of cells containing at least one rna molecule ( table 2 ) .
transcripts of the constitutively active kap104 gene were present in 99.0 % (+/ - 0.3 sem ) of cells ( table 2 , figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
in concordance with previous studies ( zenklusen et al. , 2008 ; gandhi et al. , 2011 ) , kap104 expression approximated a poisson distribution , suggesting that most of the cell - to - cell variation in kap104 rna levels could be explained by stochastic , constitutive transcription .
in contrast , the variance of cre rna abundance was large in relation to the mean ( table 2 ) , perhaps reflecting an alternative mode of transcription .

in a wild - type strain with hmlalpha : : cre , cre transcripts were absent in nearly every cell , whereas kap104 transcripts were present at a level comparable to that in sir4delta cells ( figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
the distribution of kap104 expression in wild - type cells was slightly lower than the distribution in the sir4delta mutant , which may be explained by our observation that sir4delta cells were slightly larger than wild type ( figure 4 - - figure supplement 2 ) , as noted before for sir2delta mutants ( moretto et al. , 2013 ) .
therefore , hml was completely silent in the vast majority of cells , indicating the cre - based assay was sensitive to rare events of transcription .
although we detected an apparent cre signal in 4.2 x 10 - 3 (+/ - 0.7 x 10 - 3 sem ) wild - type cells , we also detected an apparent cre signal at a frequency of 3 x 10 - 3 (+/ - 1 x 10 - 3 sem ) in cells that lacked the cre gene , which were imaged to control for hybridization specificity ( table 2 , figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
the wild - type strain and the negative control strain were distinguishable , however , by the frequency of cells containing more than one spot of cre signal ( table 2 ) .
we observed five wild - type cells across all three replicates ( 13,695 wild - type cells total ) that contained more than one cre spot , ranging from 2 to 4 spots per cell , whereas we never detected more than one cre spot per cell in the negative control strain ( 13,722 no - cre cells total ) .
together , the rna fish analysis and the cre - based assay converged on the same striking conclusion : the low rate of rfp - to - gfp switches reflected the complete absence of hmlalpha : : cre transcription in the vast majority of cells .
there was no evidence of any wild - type cells containing cre rna levels typical of sir4delta cells , suggesting that in the rare cells that lost silencing , the duration of transcription was short , presumably due to continuous nucleation of silent chromatin by sir1 and other factors .
silencing in individual sir1 cells was previously measured by indirect bioassays ( pillus and rine , 1989 ; xu et al. , 2006 ) , and with respect to transcription , the expression levels of hml and hmr underlying the two phenotypically distinct cell types in a sir1 population have never been established .
rna fish allowed us to evaluate sir1delta cells at the level of transcription on a per cell basis to determine whether these two states were molecularly equivalent to the levels of hml expression seen in sir4delta and wild - type cells .
in the absence of sir1 , 46 % (+/ - 7 sem ) of cells expressed hml ( table 2 ) , exhibiting a range in cre rna levels that resembled the sir4delta mutant ( figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
the remaining 54 % of sir1delta cells lacked detectable cre rna molecules , but expressed kap104 at normal levels ( figure 4b,c and figure 4 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
therefore , in approximately half of all cells lacking sir1 , hml was fully repressed , whereas the other half expressed hml at levels indistinguishable from those in a sir4delta mutant .
effects of sir protein availability on the dynamics of silencing although sir1 was defined by its role in the establishment of silencing , and is not required for maintenance or inheritance , the possibility that it contributes to these other processes has never been directly tested .
such a test would require a comparison of the rate of silencing loss in wild - type cells to the rate of silencing loss in the population of sir1 cells in which hml was silenced .
whereas past measurements in wild - type cells were confounded by the role of sir1 in establishment ( xu et al. , 2006 ) , the cre - based assay is sensitive enough to record losses of silencing before re - establishment occurs .
to determine whether sir1 contributes to the maintenance or inheritance of silencing , we sporulated a sir1 hemizygote containing hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette and then imaged the fluorescence of colonies derived from the meiotic products .
if the rate of silencing loss were unaffected by the absence of sir1 , then the sectoring patterns would be indistinguishable between colonies arising from sir1 cells and colonies arising from sir1delta cells in which hmlalpha : : cre was repressed .
however , green sectors were notably more abundant in the colonies of spores lacking sir1 ( figure 5a , figure 5 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
moreover , the frequency of half - sectored colonies in a sir1delta haploid was 35 - fold above the frequency of half - sectored colonies in a wild - type haploid ( table 1 and figure 5b ) , indicating that cells lost silencing at hml at a strikingly higher rate when sir1 was absent .
in strains containing hmralpha : : cre instead of hmlalpha : : cre , sir1delta colonies showed elevated sectoring and a higher abundance of half sectors in comparison to wild - type colonies , as well ( table 1 and figure 5 ) .
thus , beyond its role in establishment , sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing at both hmlalpha and hmralpha .
consistent with the rna fish measurements , which revealed a large population of sir1delta cells that lacked detectable cre transcripts ( table 2 and figure 4c ) , many of the cells within the sir1delta colonies remained red ( figure 5a ) .
therefore , sir1delta cells that were in the silenced state exhibited the same level of repression as wild - type cells , but transitioned to a transcriptionally active state more often than wild - type cells .

to test whether the dynamics of silencing were sensitive to the availability of sir proteins , hmlalpha : : cre expression was monitored in diploids hemizygous for individual sir genes .
while measuring silencing loss in diploids , we noticed that a wild - type diploid with one copy of hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette showed considerably reduced colony sectoring and a fourfold decrease ( p = 1 x 10 - 5 ; student 's t test ) in the frequency of half - sectored colonies in comparison to an isogenic haploid ( table 1 ) , indicating a ploidy effect on the rate of rfp - to - gfp switching .
compared to the wild - type diploid , colonies of the sir1 , sir3 and sir4 hemizygotes showed a modest yet consistent increase in the number of green sectors ( figure 6a and figure 6 - - figure supplement 1 ) and a higher occurrence of half sectors ( table 1 and figure 6b ) .
therefore , reducing the dose of the genes encoding sir3 or sir4 , two structural components of heterochromatin , or sir1 , a protein that recruits these components , rendered silencing at hml less stable .
altered gene dosage of sir1 and sir4 also affects the silencing of a sensitized hmr : : ade2 allele ( sussel et al. , 1993 ) .
hemizygosity for sir2 had no perceivable impact on colony sectoring ( figure 6a and figure 6 - - figure supplement 1 ) .

as measured by mating efficiency , silencing is indistinguishable between wild type and mutants lacking any of the four hst genes ( brachmann et al. , 1995 ; yang et al. , 2008 ) .
however , hst3 and hst4 have been shown to contribute to the silencing of subtelomeric genes ( brachmann et al. , 1995 ; yang et al. , 2008 ) , as well as silencing of a ura3 reporter in a plasmid - borne hmr cassette ( grunweller and ehrenhofer - murray , 2002 ) .
since nicotinamide inhibits all five sirtuins in yeast ( imai et al. , 2000 ; landry et al. , 2000a , 2000b ; smith et al. , 2000 ; tanner et al. , 2000 ; tanny and moazed , 2001 ) , we tested whether other sirtuins , in addition to sir2 , were involved in the nicotinamide - induced loss of silencing observed in figure 2 .
as expected , colonies of cells with hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette turned completely green in the absence of sir2 , a protein essential for the nucleation and maintenance of heterochromatin ( figure 7a and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1a ) .
the colonies of hst1delta , hst2delta and hst4delta mutants exhibited sectoring patterns that were indistinguishable from wild - type colonies ( figure 7a and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1a ) .
in contrast , the hst3delta mutant showed a striking increase in colony sectoring and a sevenfold greater frequency of half - sectored colonies compared to wild type ( table 1 , figure 7a,b and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1a ) .
thus , the hst3 deacetylase contributed to the stability of silenced chromatin at hml .
whereas silencing defects have not been detected at subtelomeric genes in either the hst3delta or hst4delta single mutant , the hst3delta hst4delta double mutant shows a measurable phenotype ( brachmann et al. , 1995 ; yang et al. , 2008 ) .
therefore , it is likely that the deletion of hst4 would enhance the sectoring phenotype of the hst3delta mutant shown in figure 7a .

histone h3 - h4 gene dosage effect on silencing at hml .

scale bar , 2 mm. doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.020 hst3 regulates the deacetylation of acetylated lysine 56 on histone h3 ( h3 k56 - ac ) ( celic et al. , 2006 ; maas et al. , 2006 ; yang et al. , 2008 ) .
to determine whether hst3 stabilized silencing through deacetylation of h3 k56 - ac or through deacetylation of yet undiscovered substrates , we measured the effects of amino acid substitutions that either mimic ( k56q ) or prevent ( k56r ) the acetylation of h3 k56 .
although these histone gene mutations were previously analyzed for their effects on silencing , the outcome varies depending on the locus and the assay ( hyland et al. , 2005 ; xu et al. , 2007 ; miller et al. , 2008 ; yu et al. , 2011 ) .
in our strains , with cre under the native alpha2 promoter at hml , colonies of the k56q mutant showed a dramatic increase in sectoring , whereas the k56r mutant was similar to wild type ( figure 7c and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1b ) .
consistent with the possibility that the hst3delta silencing defects were due to an increase in acetylated histone h3 k56 , the sectoring phenotypes suggested that neutralizing the positive charge at this position on histone h3 impaired the stability of repression. by half - sector analysis , however , both the k56q and k56r mutants showed a significant increase ( p = 3 x 10 - 3 and p = 9 x 10 - 5 , respectively ; student 's t test ) in the rate of silencing loss compared to wild type ( table 1 and figure 7d ) .
the relatively high frequency of half - sectored colonies in the histone h3 k56r mutant was unexpected due to the similarity in sectoring patterns between histone h3 k56r mutant colonies and wild - type colonies ( figure 7c and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1b ) .
however , the histone h3 k56r substitution has previously been shown to decrease silencing under various conditions ( xu et al. , 2007 ; yu et al. , 2011 ) .
differences between sectoring patterns and half - sector frequencies are considered further in the ' discussion ' .
cells expressing the h3 k56q mutant produced similar patterns of colony sectoring regardless of whether hst3 was present ( figure 7c and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1b ) .
this phenotype was slightly less severe than that of hst3delta cells expressing wild - type h3 k56 ( figure 7c and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1b ) , perhaps because glutamine was not quite as disruptive to silencing as acetylated lysine at this residue .
in addition , the h3 k56r substitution in hst3delta cells restored silencing to wild - type levels , as determined by overall colony sectoring ( figure 7c and figure 7 - - figure supplement 1b ) .
therefore , blocking the acetylation of residue 56 suppressed the hst3delta sectoring phenotype .
collectively , the sectoring patterns suggested that hst3 promoted the stability of silencing through the deacetylation of histone h3 k56 - ac. whereas the deletion of hst3 caused a threefold increase in the half - sector frequency of wild type ( p = 3 x 10 - 4 ; student 's t test ) , it did not significantly affect the half - sector frequency of the h3 k56q mutant ( p = 0.3 ; student 's t test ) or the surprisingly high half - sector frequency of the h3 k56r mutant ( p = 0.06 ; student 's t test ) ( table 1 and figure 7d ) .
thus , the state of histone h3 k56 affected the stability of silencing at hml , and amino acid substitutions of this residue were epistatic to the hst3delta mutation .
colonies derived from cells in which the only source of histone h3 - h4 genes was a plasmid - borne copy of hht2 - hhf2 exhibited more sectoring than colonies of cells containing both hht1 - hhf1 and hht2 - hhf2 at their native chromosomal loci ( figure 7 - - figure supplement 2 ) .
assuming the decrease in gene copy number led to a decrease in protein abundance , silencing was likely affected by levels of histones h3 and h4 that were either limiting or improperly balanced with the levels of histones h2a and h2b .
consistent with these possibilities , histone dosage has previously been shown to affect various functions of heterochromatin ( moore et al. , 1979 ; moore et al. , 1983 ; venditti et al. , 1999 ) .
in principle , the effect of histone h3 - h4 gene dosage should sensitize silencing in all genetic backgrounds .
whereas the reduction from two copies of the histone h3 - h4 gene pair to one copy did enhance the sectoring phenotype of hst3delta colonies ( compare panels a and c in figure 7 and panels a and b in figure 7 - - figure supplement 1 ) , it did not increase the half - sector frequency in the hst3delta background as it did in the wild - type background ( table 1 and figure 7b,d ) .
therefore , the degree to which histone h3 - h4 gene dosage affected silencing , at least during the first cell division of colony growth , depended on the genetic background .
live - cell imaging revealed a variety of switching patterns whereas colony sectors revealed the history of heterochromatin dynamics , we sought to also capture these events in real time at single - cell resolution to determine whether observable losses of silencing exhibited a fixed pattern or were more stochastic .
therefore , we monitored the fluorescence of cells containing hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette as they divided in a chamber supplied with fresh medium .
most cells remained red throughout the duration of the time course .
consistent with the sectors observed within colonies , rare rfp - to - gfp switches occurred in a subset of the lineages ( see video 1 for an example ) .
the rate of switching observed with live - cell imaging was within 10 % of the rate of switching determined by the half - sector assay .

nonetheless , a survey of the pattern of switch events allowed some useful inferences .
for each rfp - to - gfp switch , we determined whether cells were unbudded , small - budded , or large - budded at the moment when gfp expression was initially detected .
we observed a fluorescent switch in 24 different cells , nine of which were unbudded and thus in the g1 phase during the onset of gfp expression ( figure 8a,d ) .
multiple occurrences of both patterns 1 and 2 ( figure 8d ) indicated that silencing loss followed by recombination was not restricted to either the mother or daughter cell ( given that pattern 3 was supported by only one example , we refrained from offering an interpretation of this event ) .

cartoons of lineages that showed two rfp - to - gfp switches in directly related cells .
switches are labeled with the numbers 1 and 2 .
in pedigree a , onset of gfp expression ( depicted as yellow ) was detected in a large - budded cell ( 1 ) .
at the same time , gfp also appeared in the daughter cell that arose from the previous cell division ( 2 ) .
due to the assymetry of switch 1 ( only the mother cell remained green , implying that recombination occurred after dna replication ) , switches 1 and 2 must have arisen from independent recombination events .
it is unknown , however , whether the two recombination events resulted from two losses of silencing , or rather one loss of silencing that occurred when the two cells shared a cytoplasm ( earliest stage shown for the pedigree ) .
in pedigree b ( montage shown in figure 8b ) , gfp fluorescence was first detected in a small - budded cell that gave rise to two cells that remained green ( 1 ) .
approximately 40 min later , the daughter cell of the preceding cell division also began to show gfp fluorescence as a small - budded cell .
in pedigree c , gfp expression was first detected in a mother - daughter pair subsequent to cytokinesis , but prior to both cells budding .
whereas the mother cell became green , however , the daughter cell developed a large bud without ever reaching a similar level of gfp expression , at which point the experiment ended .
this pattern could be explained by two switching events , one early asymmetric switch where only the mother inherited a recombined rfp - gfp cassette and the daughter cell inherited gfp molecules along with an intact rfp - gfp cassette , followed by a later switch that occurred in the daughter cell .
alternatively , there could have been only one early switch where the rfp - gfp cassette inherited by the daughter cell either did not undergo recombination and gfp perdurance was especially long , or the cassette did undergo recombination , but gfp expression was weak , perhaps due to an error in recombination .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.05007.023 of the remaining cells that switched , three cells had small buds when gfp fluorescence was first detected and 12 had large buds ( figure 8d ) .
all three small - budded cells gave rise to mothers and daughters that both remained green ( pattern 6 ) ( figure 8b,d ) .
since the bud emerges during early s phase , and there were no cases of only the mother or daughter cell remaining green following the onset of gfp expression in a small - budded cell ( patterns 4 and 5 ) , it was likely that recombination of the loxp sites occurred prior to dna replication .
alternatively , recombination may have occurred shortly after dna replication at both newly synthesized copies of the rfp - gfp cassette .
in contrast , 8 of the 12 cells that expressed detectable gfp as large - budded cells gave rise to mother - daughter pairs in which only the mother or daughter remained green ( patterns 7 and 8 ) ( figure 8c,d ) , indicating that cre catalyzed recombination after s phase and acted on only one of the two rfp - gfp cassettes .
switches that followed patterns 7 and 8 also demonstrated that the time between recombination , which occurred some point after dna replication , and gfp detection , which occurred when a large bud was present , spanned only a fraction of a complete cell cycle .
for three of the rfp - to - gfp switches , we observed a second switch in the daughter cell that arose from the immediately preceding cell division ( figure 8b,d and figure 8 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
these paired switches , which occurred either simultaneously or within 40 min of each other , could have reflected either two loss - of - silencing events in directly related cells , or rather one loss - of - silencing event that happened when the mother cell and its daughter still shared a cytoplasm , assuming there was perdurance of the cre protein in both cells and a delay in recombination .
these patterns are considered further in figure 8 - - figure supplement 1 and the ' discussion ' .
discussion several lines of evidence establish the dynamic nature of heterochromatin structure .
the incorporation of newly synthesized sir3 into silenced chromatin during g1 - phase arrest suggests that at least some sir3 binding to nucleosomes is transient ( cheng and gartenberg , 2000 ) .
similarly , fluorescence - recovery - after - photobleaching experiments have shown that heterochromatin protein 1 ( hp1 ) , a structural component of heterochromatin in other eukaryotes , can rapidly associate and dissociate from heterochromatic loci ( cheutin et al. , 2003 ; festenstein et al. , 2003 ) .
however , the consequences of these structural fluctuations on the underlying functions of heterochromatin remain poorly understood .
here , we showed that heterochromatin dynamics had a functional impact on the transcriptional repression imparted by sir proteins .
moreover , we have established a route to a comprehensive understanding of all factors influencing heterochromatin dynamics .
inherent dynamics of heterochromatic gene silencing at a low rate , the heterochromatic loci hml and hmr underwent losses of silencing that had escaped detection by all previous efforts , due to the combination of their rarity and transience .
independent observations indicated that silencing was promptly re - established following its loss .
first , hmlalpha : : cre was fully silenced in the descendants of cells that switched to gfp expression , showing that cre expression was only temporary .
secondly , single - molecule rna fish did not detect any wild - type cells expressing hmlalpha : : cre to the average level of sir4delta cells , implying that when silencing was lost in wild - type cells , it was restored before cre transcription could reach that level .
these data , taken together with the inability of less sensitive assays to capture expression of hml or hmr , suggested that losses of silencing were rare and short - lived .
the detection of silencing loss in a subset of wild - type cells supported a model where sir proteins and the transcriptional machinery constantly compete for access to the silent mating - type loci .
such a concept is consistent with the dynamic exchange of structural components in heterochromatin , the continuous recruitment of sir proteins by the silencers ( cheng and gartenberg , 2000 ) , and the ability of increased levels of a transcriptional activator to overcome the silenced state ( aparicio and gottschling , 1994 ; ahmad and henikoff , 2001 ; xu et al. , 2006 ) .
this model could explain why losses of silencing were more frequent when cells contained only half the normal gene dosage of sir1 , sir3 or sir4 .
perhaps losses of silencing at hml and hmr resulted from stochastic fluctuations in the local concentration of silencing factors .
alternatively , specific perturbations such as dna replication may have disrupted the binding of sir proteins to nucleosomes , thereby creating an opportunity for rna polymerase to access heterochromatin .
defining the roles of sir1 in silencing the contribution of sir1 to silencing in wild - type cells was previously underappreciated .
heritability of the repressed state in a subset of sir1delta cells showed that sir1 was not absolutely required for the maintenance or inheritance of silenced chromatin , and suggested that sir1 primarily functioned in establishment ( pillus and rine , 1989 ) .
however , the presumed role of sir1 seemed paradoxical under the assumption that wild - type cells never lose silencing and thus do not undergo events requiring re - establishment .
this point of confusion can now be resolved by two key findings .
first , the cre - based assay revealed that transient transcription of hml and hmr occurred at a low rate in wild - type cells .
therefore , sir1 may serve a purpose in the recovery of silencing on the rare occasion that it is lost .
secondly , losses of silencing occurred more often in cells lacking sir1 , indicating that sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing , or both .
previous measurements of silencing established that two phenotypic states exist within a population of sir1 cells ( pillus and rine , 1989 ; xu et al. , 2006 ) , yet the levels of expression in each of the two subpopulations remained unresolved .
for example , in sir1delta cells containing a fluorescent reporter under control of the ura3 promoter at hml , the fluorescence intensity profile of each subpopulation shifted in relation to the profiles of wild - type cells and sir3delta cells depending on whether the ura3 trans - activator ppr1 was present ( xu et al. , 2006 ). by directly measuring the transcription of a gene from the native alpha2 promoter at hml with single - cell and single - molecule resolution , we showed that the silenced subset of sir1delta cells was fully repressed , whereas the expressed subset of sir1delta cells transcribed cre to the level of sir4delta cells .
together , the cre - based assay and the rna fish measurements resolved two separable aspects of silencing : the level of repression and the rate at which it is lost .
deletion of sir1 affected the rate of silencing loss , but not the level of repression since approximately half of all sir1 cells completely lacked cre transcripts .
moreover , the persistence of rfp expression within regions of sir1delta colonies containing either hmlalpha : : cre or hmralpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette underscored the remarkable ability of heterochromatin to template its own replication for multiple cell divisions. is there a role for a dynamic dimension to heterochromatic gene silencing ?
in principle , the dynamic nature of silenced chromatin could result from stochastic processes intrinsic to , for example , the binding constants of sir proteins for their nucleosomes and serve no useful role .
alternatively , the stability of silencing at hml and hmr could be tuned high enough to achieve cell - type specificity , yet just low enough to allow for events such as dna replication or mating - type interconversion .
haploid cells of a homothallic strain can switch mating types through repair of a double - stranded dna break at mat using hml or hmr as a template .
therefore , successful switching requires that the invading mat strand , along with the accessory proteins involved in recombinational repair , gain access to the heterochromatic donor sequence .
we speculate that the dynamics of silenced chromatin may contribute to the efficiency of mating - type interconversion .
role of the hst3 sirtuin and its histone h3 target in heterochromatin stability the stability of silencing at hml depended in part on hst3 and the deacetylation of h3 k56 - ac .
h3 k56 localizes to the dna entry / exit region of the nucleosome ( luger et al. , 1997 ) , and in the acetylated state it is thought to promote transient dna ' breathing ' , during which the dna partially unwraps from the nucleosome ( neumann et al. , 2009 ; simon et al. , 2011 ; north et al. , 2012 ) .
furthermore , h3 k56 - ac is important for transcriptional activation ( williams et al. , 2008 ; varv et al. , 2010 ) , and telomeric heterochromatin is more accessible to the bacterial dam dna methylase in various h3 k56 mutants ( xu et al. , 2007 ) .
collectively , these observations suggest that h3 k56 - ac destabilizes the nucleosome conformation and thereby renders the dna more accessible to rna polymerase .
h3 k56 acetylation and hst3 expression are both regulated by the cell cycle .
whereas h3 k56 acetylation peaks during s phase ( masumoto et al. , 2005 ) , hst3 expression does not peak until g2 / m phase ( spellman et al. , 1998 ; celic et al. , 2006 ; maas et al. , 2006 ) .
therefore , heterochromatin may be especially susceptible to transcription during the time after k56 - acetylated histone h3 is deposited into chromatin , but before hst3 removes the modification .
a tractable tool for measuring the dynamics of heterochromatic repression as previous measurements of hml silencing were unable to distinguish hst3 mutants from wild type , our detection of a stability phenotype in this mutant underscored the importance of measuring fluctuations in repression for a fuller understanding of heterochromatin .
the ability of this assay to capture the existence of transient events through their conversion to permanent , heritable marks can now allow a comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of any and all genes to heterochromatin dynamics. by preserving a historical record of transcription , the cre - based assay also provides the opportunity to measure the effects of transient environmental or cellular stresses on silencing subsequent to their occurrence .
such analyses will inform our understanding of the mechanisms by which cells maintain integrity of the epigenome .
measuring the frequency of half - sectored colonies allowed for quantification of the rate at which silencing was lost .
in general , half - sector frequencies were consistent with the overall patterns of colony sectoring .
however , strains bearing the histone h3 k56r substitution , for example , were indistinguishable from wild type by sectoring pattern , yet showed a significant increase in the frequency of half - sectored colonies .
while we do not fully understand why silencing in histone h3 k56r mutants appeared to be less stable at the two - cell stage of colony growth than at later stages , the complexities of colony development may offer a simple explanation .
the physiology of cells during the first cell division of colony growth , at which point silencing was measured by half - sector analysis , would be expected to differ from the physiology of cells during later divisions .
therefore , it is possible that the histone h3 k56r mutation rendered heterochromatin more sensitive to the physiological state of cells .
overall , both assays were informative , and sectoring patterns in particular provided the opportunity to survey heterochromatin dynamics throughout the various microenvironments and metabolic states of colonies .
a direct comparison could not be made between the rate of rfp - to - gfp switching , as determined by half - sector analysis , and the frequency of wild - type cells expressing hmlalpha : : cre , as determined by fish .
whereas half - sector analysis measured events throughout the duration of an entire cell cycle , the fish method measured expression in a snapshot of time .
furthermore , the background levels of fish signal in the negative control strain , though very low , limited quantitative interpretation of the low cre rna levels in wild - type cells .
the fish measurements did show , however , that any detectable transcription of hmlalpha : : cre in wild - type cells was both rare and restricted to relatively low levels .
these observations implied that a small number of cre transcripts produced enough recombinase to catalyze the rfp - to - gfp switch .
further experiments would be necessary to determine the number of cre rnas sufficient for recombination .
capturing losses of silencing in real time the live - cell imaging of pedigrees of wild - type cells endowed with the cre - based assay reflected our first efforts to visualize in real time the silencing loss events whose history is written in the number and size of green colony sectors .
in principle , rna fish by itself could provide better time resolution , but morphological classification of fixed spheroplasts using brightfield images was unreliable , especially with the high density of cells needed to capture rare events .
despite the time lag between loss - of - silencing events and the production of the gfp chromophore , several points were clear .
first , there was no obvious mother - daughter bias as to which cell contained the more labile hml locus .
secondly , the expression of cre and the subsequent switches from red to green could occur within the same cell cycle .
overall , the variety of patterns we observed were consistent with the possibility that losses of silencing occur at multiple points during the cell cycle , but such conclusions rely on assumptions for which we have no independent verification .
knowing the extent of variation in the time lag between hmlalpha : : cre expression and recombination would help solidify further interpretation .
intriguingly , there were three pedigrees in which a red daughter , born from a mother that switched to green , itself switched to green .
given the low probability of a switch , two switches in such closely related cells implied there was either perdurance of the cre protein following a single loss - of - silencing event , or some ' heritable ' instability shared between these two cells , as has been previously suggested in a different context ( kaufmann et al. , 2007 ) .
future experiments such as live - cell imaging of transcription should reveal the exact timing of silencing loss and address whether the history of a lineage affects stability .
materials and methods yeast strains the strains , plasmids , and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplementary files 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .
all strains were derived from the w303 background .
deletions were made using one - step integration of gene disruption cassettes ( longtine et al. , 1998 ; goldstein and mccusker , 1999 ; gueldener et al. , 2002 ) and confirmed by pcr of the 5 ' and 3 ' junctions .
for analysis of hht2 ( histone h3 ) mutations , the ura3 - marked plasmid ( pjr2657 ) in jry9638 was replaced with a trp1 - marked plasmid ( either pjr2759 , pjr3212 or pjr3213 ) by plasmid shuffle to produce jry9639 , jry9640 and jry9641 .
using the hst3delta : : k.l.leu2 fwd / rev primers and pug73 ( gueldener et al. , 2002 ) , hst3 was deleted in each of these strains to create jry9736 , jry9737 and jry9738 .
the cre gene from bacteriophage p1 was integrated at hml by transformation of a sir4delta strain containing hmlalpha : : k.l.ura3 and counter - selection on medium containing 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - foa ) .
first , the k.l.ura3 gene was amplified by pcr from pug72 ( gueldener et al. , 2002 ) using the hmlalpha : : k.l.ura3 fwd / rev primers and integrated at hmlalpha , replacing the coding sequence of the alpha2 gene .
then , the cre gene was amplified from psh47 ( guldener et al. , 1996 ) using the hmlalpha : : cre fwd / rev primers , and the resulting pcr product was transformed into the strain containing hmlalpha : : k.l.ura3 .
5 - foa was used to select for hmlalpha : : cre cells , which no longer contained k.l.ura3 .
integration of cre was confirmed by sequencing .
the resulting strain was mated with a sir4 strain and sporulated to obtain a haploid containing both sir4 and the hmlalpha : : cre allele .
to construct the hmralpha : : cre allele , the k.l.ura3 gene was amplified by pcr from pug72 ( gueldener et al. , 2002 ) using the hmra : : k.l.ura3 fwd / rev primers and integrated at hmra in a sir4delta strain , thus replacing the coding sequence of the a1 gene with k.l.ura3 .
then , the hmralpha : : cre fwd / rev primers were used to amplify a fragment of hmlalpha : : cre from jry9628 genomic dna that spanned from the x region to the z1 region ( see figure 1a ) , and the resulting pcr product was transformed into the strain containing hmra : : k.l.ura3 .
5 - foa was used to select for hmralpha : : cre cells , which no longer contained k.l.ura3 .
integration of cre was confirmed by sequencing .
the resulting strain was mated with a sir4 strain and sporulated to obtain a haploid containing both sir4 and the hmralpha : : cre allele .
for integration of the rfp - gfp cassette at the ura3 locus , the pgpd - loxp - yemrfp - tcyc1 - kanmx - loxp - yegfp - tadh1 sequence in pjr3214 was amplified by pcr using the ura3delta : : rfp - gfp fwd / rev primers .
pjr3214 contains the following features : the ampr - containing fragment of pug73 ( gueldener et al. , 2002 ) resulting from digestion with restriction enzymes ndei and noti ( 2301 bp ) ; the gpd promoter from p413 - gpd ( mumberg et al. , 1995 ) ; a loxp site ( 5 ' - ataacttcgtatagcatacattatacgaagttat - 3 ') , separated from pgpd by a sali restriction site ( gtcgac ) ; immediately downstream of the first loxp site is the yemrfp gene ( keppler - ross et al. , 2008 ) , followed by a bglii restriction site ( agatct ) and the cyc1 terminator from psh63 ( gueldener et al. , 2002 ) ; the kanmx cassette from pug6 ( guldener et al. , 1996 ) , separated from tcyc1 by a stui restriction site ( aggcct ) ; adjacent to the kanmx cassette is a second loxp site ( 5 ' - ataacttcgtatagcatacattatacgaagttat - 3 ') ; and immediately following the second loxp site is an ecorv restriction site ( gatatc ) and the yegfp - tadh1 sequence from pkt127 ( sheff and thorn , 2004 ) .
the version of the rfp - gfp cassette marked with hphmx instead of kanmx ( in strains jry9729 and jry9730 ) was constructed by transforming strains containing the kanmx - marked rfp - gfp cassette with pcr product amplified from pag32 ( goldstein and mccusker , 1999 ) using the ptef fwd and ttef rev primers .
colony growth and imaging all colonies were imaged using a zeiss axio zoom.v16 microscope equipped with zen software ( zeiss , jena , germany ) , a zeiss axiocam mrm camera and a planapo z 0.5x objective .
the colonies shown in figures 2 , 6 and 7 ( and the associated figure supplements ) were imaged on day 6 of growth , whereas the colonies shown in figures 3 and 5 ( and the associated figure supplements ) were imaged on day 3 of growth .
images were assembled using photoshop ( adobe systems , san jose , ca ) .
in preparation for colony analysis , red cells were selected using medium containing g418 ( geneticin ) ( life technologies , grand island , ny ) .
due to the complete loss of silencing in sir2delta cells , jry9633 was unable to grow in the presence of g418 and was therefore grown on nonselective medium .
cells were then grown to log phase in complete supplement mixture ( csm ) - trp ( sunrise science products , san diego , ca ) , and serial dilutions were performed to spread approximately 10 cells / plate ( csm - trp , 1 % agar ) .
to inhibit sirtuin activity , 200 mul of 0.5 m nicotinamide was spread onto csm - trp , 1 % agar plates prior to plating cells .
for figure 5 and figure 5 - - figure supplement 1 , red cells of jry9729 and jry9730 were selected using medium containing both g418 ( life technologies ) and hygromycin b ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) , and then sporulated for 4 - 5 days at room temperature on 1 % potassium acetate .
the resulting tetrads were dissected on csm - trp plates and grown into colonies for imaging .
for half - sector analysis , red cells were selected using g418 and then grown to log phase in csm - trp .
serial dilutions were performed to plate approximately 100 cells / plate ( csm - trp ) .
on day 3 of growth , plates were scanned , face up , with a typhoon trio ( ge healthcare life sciences , buckinghamshire , england ) using the 488 - nm laser and 520 - nm emission filter to detect gfp fluorescence .
since colonies of cells containing the h3 k56r substitution grew notably slower than colonies of other genotypes , plates were scanned on day 4 of growth for jry9640 and jry9737 .
colonies that were half green or completely green were manually counted .
the total number of colonies was determined with matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma ) by applying a threshold and converting scans to a binary image ( code available upon request ) .
then , the following equation was used to calculate the half - sector frequency : # of half - sectored colonies /(# of total colonies - # of fully green colonies ) three independent experiments were performed for each genotype .
see table 1 - - source data 1 for the total number of colonies , as well as the number of half - sectored colonies and fully green colonies determined for every experiment .
flow cytometry colonies were grown as described above , scraped off the agar surface and resuspended in synthetic complete ( sc ) medium ( sunrise science products ) .
after growth overnight , cultures were diluted back to 0.01 od600 and then grown in sc to approximately 0.2 od600 .
cells were harvested by centrifugation , and then washed and resuspended in pbs , ph 7.4 on ice .
a fc - 500 flow cytometer ( beckman - coulter , brea , ca ) was used to measure the gfp fluorescence intensity of 105 cells / sample .
using flowjo software ( tree star , ashland , or ) cells were gated based on forward and side scatter , and the data were exported as fcs files .
data analysis was performed with matlab ( mathworks ) .
rna preparation for quantitative rt - pcr total rna was isolated from log - phase cells using hot acidic phenol ( collart and oliviero , 2001 ) .
rna was digested with dnase i ( roche diagnostics , indianapolis , in ) and then purified by phenol - chloroform extraction and precipitation with isopropanol .
cdna was synthesized using the superscript iii first - strand synthesis system for rt - pcr ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) and oligo ( dt ) primers .
quantitative pcr of cdna was performed using the thermo scientific dynamo hs sybr green qpcr kit ( fisher scientific , chicago , il ) and a mx3000p machine ( stratagene , acquired by agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) .
samples were analyzed in technical triplicate for three independent rna preparations .
single - molecule rna fish rna fish was performed as described ( raj et al. , 2008 ) using jry9630 , jry9631 , jry9632 and jry4012 .
all probes ( see supplementary file 4 for probe sequences ) were designed , synthesized and labeled by stellaris ( biosearch technologies , novato , ca ) .
probes targeting cre were coupled to quasar 670 dye ( biosearch technologies ) and probes targeting kap104 were coupled to cal fluor red 590 dye ( biosearch technologies ) .
each probe mix ( 5 nmol ) was dissolved in 100 mul of te buffer , ph 8.0 .
for hybridization , 1:10 dilutions of the cre and kap104 probe stocks were made , and 1 mul of each probe dilution was added to 50 mul of hybridization buffer .
cells were grown in csm to 0.2 - 0.3 od600 and then fixed and hybridized using the protocol as described ( youk et al. , 2010 ) with additional guidance ( raj , 2013 ) and the following modification to the spheroplasting procedure : cells were digested with 3 mul of zymolyase ( 2.5 mg / ml ) at 30degreesc and monitored by phase contrast microscopy until approximately 80 % of cells appeared to be digested ( 35 - 50 min ) ( l teytelman , personal communication , january 2013 ) .
the cre and kap104 probes were hybridized to cells overnight at 30degreesc in 10 % formamide buffer .
samples were then washed , stained with dapi , washed again and resuspended in 10 mul of glucose - oxygen - scavenging ( glox ) solution without enzymes .
prior to imaging , 10 mul of glox solution with enzymes ( 1 % [ vol / vol ] catalase [ sigma - aldrich c3515 ] , 1 % [ vol / vol ] glucose oxidase [ sigma - aldrich g2133 ] , 2 mm trolox [ sigma - aldrich 238813 ]) was added to the sample .
images were acquired with a deltavision rt microscope and softworx software ( applied precision , issaquah , wa ) using a 60 x / 1.40 oil - immersion objective ( olympus , tokyo , japan ) , a coolsnap hq ccd camera ( photometrics , tuscon , az ) and the following filters from chroma technology ( bellows falls , vt ) : et402 / 15x , et455 / 50m ( dapi ) ; et555 / 25x , et605 / 52m ( cal fluor red 590 ) ; and et645 / 30x , et705 / 72m ( quasar 670 ) .
series of z - stacks were acquired with a step size of 0.2 mum .
cell boundaries were hand - drawn using imagej software ( nih , bethesda , md ) .
spots were detected and analyzed using matlab ( mathworks ) .
first , a three - dimensional laplacian of gaussian filter ( raj et al. , 2008 ) was applied to raw images of cre and kap104 rna .
then , a fluorescence intensity threshold was selected to identify spots within an expected range of sizes .
given that some sir4delta and sir1delta cells contained a relatively large number of cre transcripts , some of which appeared to overlap each other in a maximum - intensity projection of z - stacks , spot detection was performed in three dimensions to resolve individual spots ( code adapted from l teytelman and available upon request ) .
within each experiment ( three independent experiments were performed ) , the same threshold values ( one for cre rna images and one for kap104 rna images ) were applied across all samples .
live - cell imaging cells containing hmlalpha : : cre and the rfp - gfp cassette ( jry9628 ) were grown to mid - log phase in csm - trp , sonicated once for 5 s at a power output of 10 % , and then imaged over time using the cellasic onix microfluidic platform ( emd millipore , hayward , ca ) .
growth was restricted to a single focal plane within chambers of the y04c microfluidic plate for haploid yeast ( emd millipore ) .
csm - trp flowed through the chambers continuously at a pressure of 3 psi .
brightfield and fluorescence images of 46 different fields were taken every 10 min for 13 hr using metamorph software ( molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca ) and an eclipse ti microscope ( nikon instruments , melville , ny ) equipped with a clara interline ccd camera ( andor technology , belfast , northern ireland ) and a cfi apo tirf 60 x / 1.49 oil - immersion objective ( nikon instruments ) , which was heated to 30degreesc using an objective heater ( bioptechs , butler , pa ) .
exposure times for yegfp and yemrfp fluorescence were each 100 ms. image analysis and video assembly were performed using imagej software ( nih ) .

the reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision , and the reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission .
this manuscript presents extremely interesting results concerning the regulation of transcription of the silent mating type cassettes in s. cerevisiae. by using the cre - regulated rfp - gfp reporter described in the paper , the authors can stably capture exceedingly rare expression from within a silent mating type cassette .
using this tool , they investigate the frequency of expression of these cassettes in both wild - type cells and in a set of mutants .
one highlight of the manuscript is that the system seems to work and work well .
it shows that there is a very low level of expression in wild - type that was not previously detectable .
a second highlight is that the experiments reveal that sir1 is required for more than establishment of silencing , as the data reveal that it is also likely required for maintenance .
other results provide evidence that the histone deacetylase hst3 is required for silencing and that the absolute levels of heterochromatin components - - histones and sir proteins - - are also important .
overall , the development of the reporter system as well as the specific results will be of interest to a large number of scientists .
the referees agreed that the data are interesting and overall of good technical quality .
however , there was also a consensus that the promise of quantitative measurement was not carried forward in the mutant analysis , and that this should be done before acceptance of the manuscript .
this and a few other concerns to be addressed are presented below : 1 ) many of the mutant phenotypes in the manuscript are not described in a very quantitative fashion , as they are described and shown only as increased levels of green sectoring .
this is true for effects of sir protein levels , h3 / h4 levels , hst3 effects , h3k56q mutants , and more .
but one of the important points of this manuscript is the quantitative nature of the assay .
the reviewers see this initial work as the chance to set the standard in the field for all other follow up studies using this assay .
thus before endorsing this work for acceptance , all the mutant analyses should be carried out via a half sector analysis to provide a quantitative measurement for comparison ( rather than the semi - quantitative analysis of relative sectoring that was presented ) .
this will help alleviate uninterpretable comparisons that occur between labs or even between mutants .
2 ) it is clear that the expression of gfp is dependent upon cre expression .
however , the level of cre expression and the efficiency at which it mediates recombination at the lox sites is not clear. that is , the fish experiments tell us that very few wt cells have a cre signal above background ( 2 - 4 spots versus 1 spot ) .
however they do not tell us whether 2 - 4 spots of cre are sufficient for recombination .
at best this can only be inferred from comparing the frequency of fish signals to half - sectors .
please acknowledge / define these limitations of your interpretation in the text .
3 ) there are a few concerns / comments about the hst3 / h3k56 experiments .
first , in figure 10 , the authors conclude that an increased level of sectoring is caused by reduced levels of h3 / h4 based on comparing wild - type strains to those with only one copy of h3 / h4 on a plasmid .
a change in h3 / h4 level seems like the likeliest explanation , but other explanations seem possible in the absence of careful measurements of histone levels .
second , the analysis of the amino acid changes at h3k56 ( figure 9 ) appears to have been done in strains with this same configuration of h3 / h4 genes ; that is , with a perturbation of sectoring levels already in place .
it 's hard to know if the altered histone gene configuration might affect the degree of the change caused by the h3k56 changes .
it is suggested these two sections be combined to present the results and possible caveats more clearly .
ideally , what is currently figures 8 - 10 would be part of the same figure .
finally , there 's evidence that an hst4 deletion causes little phenotype except when combined with an hst3 deletion , in which case it enhances the hst3 phenotype .
did the authors test an hst3 hst4 double mutant for sectoring levels ?
if they did not , it would still be helpful to acknowledge the possibility that the double mutant might show an even stronger phenotype .
10.7554 / elife.05007.029 author response 1 ) many of the mutant phenotypes in the manuscript are not described in a very quantitative fashion , as they are described and shown only as increased levels of green sectoring .
this is true for effects of sir protein levels , h3 / h4 levels , hst3 effects , h3k56q mutants , and more .

this will help alleviate uninterpretable comparisons that occur between labs or even between mutants .
our top priority was to quantify the rate of silencing loss for all mutants by measuring the frequency of half - sectored colonies .
measuring these low rates was a daunting and laborious task that in the end required hundreds of liters of media and the screening of hundreds of thousands of colonies .
hence it took a substantial amount of time to revise the manuscript .
in anticipation of this workload , we excluded the few mutants that did not show a sectoring phenotype ( the sir2 hemizygote and the hst1delta , hst2delta and hst4delta mutants ) from our analysis .
the newly determined half - sector frequencies are represented as bar graphs in new panels of figures 5 , 6 and 7 .
a summary of these values is presented in table 1 , and the raw data are available in table 1 - source data 1 .
for the majority of measurements , the results were straightforward .
differences in sectoring patterns were reflected by differences in the frequency of half - sectored colonies for the genotypes shown in figures 3 , 5 , 6 and 7a .
for figure 7c , however , we found that some genotypes ( in particular , strains containing the histone h3 k56r substitution ) displayed frequencies of half - sectored colonies that were unexpected based upon the sectoring phenotypes , thus challenging us to consider the ways in which half - sector occurrence could have diverged from the overall sectoring pattern .
the most parsimonious explanation for these results was , given that cells experience distinct physiological states between different stages of colony growth and even between different locations within the same colony , these changes in state may have affected silencing in certain genetic backgrounds .
whereas half - sector measurements were restricted to the first cell division of colony growth , the sectoring patterns of developed colonies offered a more complex yet expansive interpretation of heterochromatin dynamics .
we added this point to the discussion .
2 ) it is clear that the expression of gfp is dependent upon cre expression .
however , the level of cre expression and the efficiency at which it mediates recombination at the lox sites is not clear. that is , the fish experiments tell us that very few wt cells have a cre signal above background ( 2 - 4 spots versus 1 spot ) .
however they do not tell us whether 2 - 4 spots of cre are sufficient for recombination .
at best this can only be inferred from comparing the frequency of fish signals to half - sectors .
please acknowledge / define these limitations of your interpretation in the text .
fish measurements showed that in the rare wild - type cells that transcribed hmlalpha : : cre , the level of cre rna ranged from 1 to 4 molecules per cell , which was low in comparison to the average level of cre rna in the sir4delta mutant .
we inferred from this observation that very few cre transcripts were sufficient to induce a rfp - to - gfp switch .
although we stand by this interpretation , we agree with the reviewers that more evidence is needed to confirm this possibility .
therefore , we moved this text from the results to the discussion and elaborated on the limitations of comparing the fish analysis to the cre - based assay .
3 ) there are a few concerns / comments about the hst3 / h3k56 experiments .
first , in figure 10 , the authors conclude that an increased level of sectoring is caused by reduced levels of h3 / h4 based on comparing wild - type strains to those with only one copy of h3 / h4 on a plasmid .
a change in h3 / h4 level seems like the likeliest explanation , but other explanations seem possible in the absence of careful measurements of histone levels .

finally , there 's evidence that an hst4 deletion causes little phenotype except when combined with an hst3 deletion , in which case it enhances the hst3 phenotype .
did the authors test an hst3 hst4 double mutant for sectoring levels ?
if they did not , it would still be helpful to acknowledge the possibility that the double mutant might show an even stronger phenotype .
for the experiments related to hst3 and histone h3 k56 , we combined what were previously figures 8 and 9 into what is now figure 7 to show the sirtuin deletion mutants together with the histone h3 k56 mutants , as suggested .
figure 10 , which showed that a strain containing only one copy of the histone h3 - h4 gene pair on a plasmid exhibited more sectoring than a strain containing the two endogenous histone h3 - h4 gene pairs , was turned into a supplementary figure to accompany the new figure 7 .
we added text to both the legend for figure 7 and the main text to clarify that all strains shown in figure 7c were in the genetic background containing only one copy of the histone h3 - h4 gene pair on a plasmid .
this background did sensitize the sectoring phenotype of hst3delta colonies as it did for wild - type colonies ( compare the hst3delta colonies between panels a and b in figure 7 - figure supplement 1 ) , but it had a more variable effect on the frequency of half sectors , which is now discussed in the results .
a change in histone h3 and h4 levels is indeed the likeliest explanation for the histone h3 - h4 gene dosage effect on silencing .
however , to address the valid point that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out , we adjusted the text to both strengthen support for this model and recognize any inherent assumptions .
finally , since previous publications have shown hst4 to be a minor contributor to the role of its paralog hst3 , we agree with the reviewers that deletion of hst4 would likely enhance the phenotype of the hst3delta mutant .
in recognition of this , we added text to the results .

background glypican - 3 ( gpc3 ) is a cell surface - bound proteoglycan which has been identified as a potential biomarker candidate in hepatocellular carcinoma , lung carcinoma , severe pneumonia , and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
the aim of our review is to evaluate whether gpc3 has utility as a disease - specific biomarker , to discuss the potential involvement of gpc3 in cell biology , and to consider the changes of gpc3 gene and protein expression and regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma , lung cancer , severe pneumonia , and ards .
results immunohistochemical studies have suggested that over - expression of gpc3 is associated with a poorer prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients .
expression of gpc3 leads to an increased apoptosis response in human lung carcinoma tumor cells , and is considered to be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene .
increased serum levels of gpc3 have been demonstrated in ards patients with severe pneumonia .
conclusions glypican - 3 could be considered as a clinically useful biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma , lung carcinoma , and ards , but further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings .

ards is a complex response of the lung to direct and indirect insults associated with high morbidity and mortality , with current treatments mainly being supportive , without accurate targeted therapies [ 1 , 2 ] .
directions of research are concentrating on identifying potential biomarkers or genetic markers to facilitate diagnosis , and to assist in prediction of outcome and treatment response .
recently , our group found that the serum level of glypican - 3 ( gpc3 ) , a proteoglycan anchored to cell surface by glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol , was significantly higher in the circulation of patients with severe pneumonia , as compared with healthy control , and increased even more significantly in patients with severe pneumonia accompanied with ards than those with severe pneumonia alone [ 3 ] .
we proposed that the circulating level of glypican - 3 may correlate with the severity of pneumonia as potential biomarker to predict the occurrence of ards .
gpc3 has been recently reported and suggested as a novel potential oncofetal biomarker for diagnosis in a number of cancer diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma [ 4 ] .
it has previously been demonstrated that gpc3 was over - expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma measured by cdna microarrays , and gpc3 protein was found in serum from 40 % of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma , but not in serum from patients with liver cirrhosis , chronic hepatitis , and healthy donors [ 4 ] .
therefore , gpc3 was proposed as a useful tumor marker for cancer - diagnosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma .
specific role of gpc3 in cancer and inflammatory disease at different times seems to have a clear and reasonable disease control , e.g. , severe pneumonia with or without ards , or virus - infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with other liver diseases [ 3 , 4 ] .
the significant increases in expression of gpc3 in hepatocellular carcinoma and ards raise the question whether gpc3 has utility as a biomarker of disease or disease severity [ 5 - 8 ] .
the present commentary calls for further research into the molecular biology , disease - specific associations , and potential value as a biomarker of gpc3 .
gene organization of gpc3 and its family glypican - 3 , also called oci - 5 , dgsx , gtr2 - 2 , mxr7 , sdys , sgb , sgbs , and sgbs1 , was identified in a rare undifferentiated epithelial cell line oci - 5 [ 9 ] .
it is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan belonging to the glypican - related integral membrane proteoglycan family [ 10 ] , which includes six members ( gpc1 - gpc6 ) .
according to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of gene sequences , these six members are divided into two subfamilies ; one group is gpc3 and gpc5 which show 43 % sequence homology , while the other group contains gpc1 , gpc2 , gpc4 , and gpc6 [ 11 ] .
gpc3 is encoded at chromosome xp26 adjacent to gpc4 , and spans more than 500 kilobases .
four isoforms have been reported , of which isoform 2 ( genbank accession no. : np _ 004475 ) , which encodes a 70 - kda precursor core protein with 580 amino acids , is the most commonly expressed [ 12 ] .
glypicans are composed of a 60 - 70 kda size membrane - associated core protein , a variable number of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide side chains , and a glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol linkage .
the core protein is predicted to form a conserved globular tertiary structure because of several intramolecular disulfide bridges caused by 14 conserved cysteine residues domains .
heparan sulfate chains bind to serine residues of core protein carboxyl terminal protein [ 13 ] , and approximate the core protein to the cell membrane .
a glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol linkage anchor becomes the final connecting link between the core protein and the cell membrane .
gpc3 has one 40 - kda amino terminal protein and one 30 - kda membrane - bound carboxyl terminal protein .
the amino acid sequences for the two different terminal proteins are arg358 and ser359 , which can be enzymatically lyzed releasing a soluble form of gpc3 ( sgpc3 ) .
sgpc3 can be specifically detected in the circulating blood of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [ 14 ] .
secreted gpc3 can also be cleaved by notum , a secreted enzyme , into a released form in the extracellular environment [ 15 ] .
the notum 's cleavage site and glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol linkage - phospholipase c , the glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol linkage anchor of gpc3 , are two distinct soluble gpc3 forms , each having different functions .
roles of gpc3 in diseases glypican - 3 gene is weakly expressed in the placenta and lung , kidney , ovarian , breast , and skin tissue , but not in normal adult liver , heart , brain , spleen , stomach , intestine , testicles , and bladder tissue [ 16 ] .
gpc3 plays important roles in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis during development , e.g. , developmental outgrowth and dysplastic kidneys of simpson - golabi - behmel syndrome [ 17 ] , via wnt / jnk signaling [ 18 ] or fgf signaling pathways [ 19 ] , in the processes of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis via the morphogenetic protein signaling pathway [ 20 ] , and several malignancies as a cancer suppressor gene through a suppression of pi3k / akt pathways and a stimulation of p38 / mapk pathway [ 21 ] ( fig. 1 ) .
gpc3 contributes to cell proliferation and survival , and regulates breast cancer cell growth [ 22 ]. fig. 1 positive and negative effects of gpc3 on its two main signaling pathways .
in the wnt signaling pathway ( left ) , gpc3 suppresses canonical wnt signaling pathway ( wnt / beta - catenin ) while motivating the activation of non - canonical wnt signaling pathway ( wnt / jnk ) .
in the hedgehog ( hh ) signaling pathway ( right ) , this signaling pathway can be triggered by combination of hh and the receptor patched ( ptc ) which leads to the inhibition of ptc on smoothened .
gpc3 competes with ptc for hh binding increasing evidence suggests soluble gpc3 as a novel diagnostic candidate marker in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 13 ] .
gpc3 is expressed in 95 % of hepatocellular carcinomas , but not in neuroendocrine tumor metastatic to the liver , and cholangiocarcinoma , measured by liver cancer tissue microarrays which were constructed from hepatocellular carcinoma , neuroendocrine tumor , and cholangiocarcinoma samples [ 23 ] .
the high positive rate of gpc3 in hepatocellular carcinoma indicates the specificity of gpc3 in hepatocyte - origin carcinogenesis .
gpc3 was considered as important as alpha - fetoprotein in a fast and effective cell sorting strategy to specifically identify hepatocellular carcinoma circulating cells [ 24 ] .
the positive rate of hepatocellular carcinoma circulating cells was above 90 % in combination of gpc3 with alpha - fetoprotein .
the hepatocellular carcinoma cells positive to both gpc3 and cytokeratin 19 were found to have the highest risk of multifocality , microvascular invasion , regional lymph node involvement , shortest recurrence time , and distant metastasis in a retrospective study of immunohistochemical staining [ 25 ] .
the combination of gpc3 and cytokeratin 19 expression in the cancer tissue was suggested as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma .
glypican - 3 was recently suggested to be a critical part of molecular mechanisms by which the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma are regulated and controlled .
microrna - 133b is a small non - coding rna which targets sirt1s , suppressing its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells , increasing the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the activation of e - cadherin expression , and repressing expression of gpc3 and the anti - apoptotic proteins ( bcl - 2 , bcl - xl , and mcl - 1 ) [ 26 ] .
it is questioned whether the gpc3 / wnt beta - catenin signal pathway is mir - 133b / sirt1 - specific regulation or is the hepatocellular carcinoma cell - specific and / or dominated mechanism .
a clinical trial of codrituzumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody against gpc3 , was recently performed in a randomized phase ii trial in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had failed prior systemic therapy [ 27 ] .
it was proposed that gpc3 could interact with cd16 / fcgammariiia and trigger antibody - dependent cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells .
patients with vascular invasion and / or extra - hepatic metastasis were treated with sorafenib and then with codrituzumab or placebo .
this particular study with 125 patients with codrituzumab failed to show any significant improvement of the median progression - free survival and overall survival , even though those patients had high cd16 / fcgammariiia expression on peripheral immune cells and gpc3 expression in the tumor .
oligonucleotide microarray analysis demonstrated that gpc3 is over - expressed in tissues harvested from smokers with lung adenocarcinoma [ 28 ] .
the importance of gpc3 was furthermore validated in lung cancer cell lines .
it was proposed that the over - expression of gpc3 may be induced by smoking , although no direct evidence to support this has been reported .
high expression of gpc3 was noticed in lung cancer tissues , particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma .
gpc3 protein and mrna expression were positive in 55 % of squamous cell carcinoma versus 8 % of adenocarcinoma , but negative in normal lung tissues [ 28 ] .
the suggestion that gpc3 was suggested as a potential candidate marker for early detection of lung squamous cell carcinoma should be questioned , since about half of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma have negative gpc3 staining , and because it is hard to access the lung tissue at the early stage of the disease .
when comparing the sensitivity of tissue markers using immunostaining [ 29 ] , the positive staining of p63 was about 99 % in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma , followed by high - molecular - weight cytokeratin ( hmck ) ( 97 %) , cytokeratin 5 / 6 ( 93 %) , sry - related hmg - box 2 ( 80 %) , thrombomodulin ( 79 %) , desmocollin - 3 ( 72.7 %) , s100a7 ( 71 %) , s100a2 ( 63.3 %) , and gpc3 ( 47 %) , while desmocollin - 3 in lung squamous cell carcinoma alone was 100 % , followed by cytokeratin 5 / 6 ( 98 %) , sry - related hmg - box 2 ( 96 %) , gpc3 ( 92 %) , s100a7 ( 87 %) , thrombomodulin ( 80 %) , s100a2 ( 65 %) , p63 ( 52 %) , and hmck ( 33 %) .
thyroid transcription factor - 1 ( ttf - 1 ) expression was observed in 87.4 % of lung adenocarcinoma cases and 2.0 % of squamous cell lung carcinoma cases .
when analyzing only poorly differentiated tumors , hmck was the most sensitive marker for squamous cell lung carcinoma ( 100 %) , followed by p63 ( 97.8 %) , ck5 / 6 ( 87.0 %) , sox2 ( 71.7 %) , thrombomodulin ( 58.7 %) , desmocollin - 3 ( 52.2 %) , s100a2 ( 50 %) , glypican - 3 ( 45.7 %) , and s100a7 ( 45.7 %) .
desmocollin - 3 was the most specific marker for poorly differentiated squamous cell lung carcinoma ( 100 %) , followed by ck5 / 6 ( 98.3 %) , glypican - 3 ( 94.8 %) , sox2 ( 94.8 %) , s100a2 ( 81 %) , s100a7 ( 75.9 %) , thrombomodulin ( 72.4 %) , p63 ( 48.3 %) , and hmck ( 36.8 %) .
the study by tsuta et al. demonstrated that a number of molecules could be altered according to disease subtypes , differentiations , durations , and severities .
the cytokeratin 5 / 6 was suggested as the best marker for differentiating lung squamous carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma , although gpc3 and others were also differentially expressed compared with controls .
in addition , an early study demonstrated an increased apoptosis response caused by ectopic expression of gpc3 in human lung carcinoma tumor cell , and gpc3 would be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene [ 30 ] , although little has been known on accurate mechanisms of gpc3 in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer .
concerns on disease specificity the specificity of gpc3 as disease biomarkers should be carefully examined and validated in large cohorts , in a comparison among multiple diseases , and in cases of different stages , duration , and severity .
gpc3 was firstly reported as a disease - specific biomarker for ards [ 3 ] .
gpc3 was identified by integrating proteomic profiles of inflammatory mediators with clinical bioinformatics [ 7 ] .
in the research by chen et al. , plasma was collected from the healthy persons as controls or from patients with severe pneumonia infected by bacteria or from patients with severe pneumonia - associated ards on day of the admission , day 3 , and day 7 [ 3 ] .
expression of gpc3 in peripheral circulation of severe pneumonia - associated ards patients progressively increased over time ( admission day , day 3 , day 7 ) compared with healthy persons or severe pneumonia patients alone .
the investigators further showed that circulating levels of gpc3 were increased in ards induced by severe pneumonia as a model of infection - dominated disease , as well as in ards induced by acute pancreatitis as a model of non - infection - based disease .
it seems that altered gpc3 may be more dependent upon the disease stage and severity , rather than the properties of associated pathogens or initiates .
in acute liver injury models induced by lipopolysaccharide , expression of gpc3 genes increased over time after induction , and even more significantly when bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted [ 31 ] .
the mechanism by which gpc3 influences ards is unknown .
based on the known gpc3 - related signaling pathways [ 32 - 34 ] , we propose a possible hypothesis that the gpc3 - wnt pathway may play a significant role in the development and progression of ards ( fig. 2 ) .
gpc3 has opposite effects on the canonical and non - canonical wnt signaling pathways , suppressing canonical wnt / beta - catenin signaling while activating non - canonical wnt signaling pathway ( wnt / jnk ) [ 18 ] .
the wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway can induce transformation of mesenchymal stem cells to alveolar epithelial cells [ 35 ] .
thus , a suppression of wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway by gpc3 may destroy cell integrity , change alveolar epithelial permeability , and aggravate lung edema .
on the other hand , an enhancement of wnt / jnk signaling pathway caused by gpc3 may induce nf - kappab activation , which is a classic proinflammatory transcription factor in many inflammatory diseases including ards [ 36 ] .
we therefore hypothesize that gpc3 may be involved in the tissue / cell - associated auto - defensive processes , repair and recovery , or regeneration. fig. 2 potential mechanisms of gpc3 in acute lung injury .
wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway shows its ability to transform the mesenchymal stem cells to alveolar epithelial cells .
the suppression of wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway by gpc3 may destroy cell integrity , change alveolar epithelial permeability , and aggravate lung edema .
on the other hand , gpc3 can enhance wnt / jnk signaling pathway which may create an increase transcription of nf - kappab conclusion glypican - 3 is involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation and modulation of cell survival during development process of the organ .
it may have value as a biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma , lung carcinoma , severe pneumonia , and ards .
gpc3 was recently selected and proposed as a biomarker in patients with severe pneumonia and ards [ 3 ] .
the potential of gpc3 as a disease biomarker needs further study in different diseases in particular in lung diseases , such as ards , and in cancers including lung and liver cancer .
these studies should involve large cohorts with a variety of disease durations and severity , and in the case of ards , of inducing factors .
the biological functions and roles of gpc3 require further investigation to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning the associations of gpc3 with disease .
we aim to further evaluate the utility of gpc3 as a biomarker , in order to enable producing more precise and accurate medicine .

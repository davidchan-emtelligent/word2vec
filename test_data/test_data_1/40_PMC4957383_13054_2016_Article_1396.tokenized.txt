background it has been shown that the application of a lung - protective mechanical ventilation strategy can improve the prognosis of patients with acute lung injury ( ali ) or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
however , the optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for intensive care unit ( icu ) patients without ali or ards is uncertain .
therefore , we performed a network meta - analysis to identify the optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for these patients .
methods we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) in the cochrane library , embase , medline , cinahl , and web of science for studies published up to july 2015 in which pulmonary compliance or the partial pressure of arterial oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen ( pao2 / fio2 ) ratio was assessed in icu patients without ali or ards , who received mechanical ventilation via different strategies .
the data for study characteristics , methods , and outcomes were extracted .
we assessed the studies for eligibility , extracted the data , pooled the data , and used a bayesian fixed - effects model to combine direct comparisons with indirect evidence .
results seventeen randomized controlled trials including a total of 575 patients who received one of six ventilation strategies were included for network meta - analysis .
among icu patients without ali or ards , strategy c ( lower tidal volume ( vt ) + higher positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep )) resulted in the highest pao2 / fio2 ratio ; strategy b ( higher vt + lower peep ) was associated with the highest pulmonary compliance ; strategy a ( lower vt + lower peep ) was associated with a shorter length of icu stay ; and strategy d ( lower vt + zero end - expiratory pressure ( zeep )) was associated with the lowest pao2 / fio2 ratio and pulmonary compliance .
conclusions for icu patients without ali or ards , strategy c ( lower vt + higher peep ) was associated with the highest pao2 / fio2 ratio .
strategy b ( higher vt + lower peep ) was superior to the other strategies in improving pulmonary compliance .
strategy a ( lower vt + lower peep ) was associated with a shorter length of icu stay , whereas strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) was associated with the lowest pao2 / fio2 ratio and pulmonary compliance .

81402462 wang changsong issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background it has been shown that the application of lung - protective mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume can improve the prognosis of patients with acute lung injury ( ali ) or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) [ 1 - 3 ] .
several clinical studies have attempted to optimize the ventilator management strategy to improve oxygenation and lung compliance , thereby reducing the length of intensive care unit ( icu ) stay and the mortality of icu patients without ali or ards [ 4 - 6 ] .
however , the optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for icu patients without ali or ards is uncertain .
clinical data show that patients without a diagnosis of ali or ards can benefit ventilation with a low tidal volume [ 4 , 7 ] .
schultz et al .
[ 7 ] concluded that the initial ventilator setting , high tidal volume , may be associated with lung injury in patients without ali or ards .
serpa neto et al .
[ 8 ] used a traditional pairwise meta - analysis to systematically evaluate ventilation strategies such as high and low tidal volume .
their conclusions were as follows : compared to ventilation with a higher tidal volume , protective ventilation with lower tidal volumes at the onset of mechanical ventilation was associated with better clinical outcomes , including a shorter length of hospital stay , lower mortality , fewer pulmonary infections , and less atelectasis , among patients without ali or ards .
in addition to tidal volume , there are other factors in the overall ventilation strategy , such as positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) , recruitment maneuver ( rm ) , and respiratory ratio .
tidal volume and peep play important roles .
however , traditional pairwise meta - analysis can only be used to compare specific factors between ventilation strategies and cannot be used to compare the entire set of parameters relevant to different ventilation strategies .
therefore , tidal volume and clinical outcomes of different comprehensive ventilation strategies using a specific tidal volume and peep cannot be compared by traditional pairwise meta - analysis .
accordingly , the results obtained from traditional pairwise meta - analyses have significant limitations .
fortunately , a network meta - analysis is advantageous for the evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of multiple interventions , even when some parameters might not have been directly compared .
additionally , network meta - analysis has the potential to reduce the uncertainty in treatment effect estimates [ 9 , 10 ] .
given these advantages , we used a network meta - analysis to search the literature for data examining the optimal tidal volume and peep in patients without ali or ards .
based on these data , we divided the ventilation mode into six types and considered each ventilation mode as a unique ventilation strategy .
subsequently , the effectiveness and safety of various ventilation strategies were compared to identify the optimal ventilation strategy for icu patients without ali or ards .
methods we conducted our systematic review in accordance with the methods recommended in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses ( prisma ) guidelines [ 11 ] .
literature search the trials were identified through electronic and manual searches .
we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) in the cochrane library , embase , medline , cinahl , and web of science using a combination of mesh terms and text words .
we did not restrict our search based on language or year of publication .
the most recent search date was july 2015 .
we reviewed the reference lists of published meta - analyses .
in addition , we manually searched the bibliographies of randomized controlled trials , meta - analyses , and systematic reviews for relevant studies that may have been missed in the initial electronic search .
inclusion and exclusion criteria the study inclusion and exclusion process was conducted separately by two groups .
when there was a discrepancy between the two groups , the selection committee met to reach a consensus on the inclusion or exclusion of the disputed article .
we first excluded the following types of articles : reviews , retrospective studies , observational studies , case reports , animal studies , studies conducted on children , studies examining only psychological mechanisms , unrelated studies ( such as studies of mechanical ventilation in patients with ards ) , duplicate reports , studies involving repeated experiments ( commentary articles on specific studies or secondary analyses of experimental data ) , and nonrandomized trials .
ultimately , randomized controlled trials examining mechanical ventilation in icu patients without ali or ards were included .
all of the included studies were of relatively high quality with a low risk of bias .
no studies were excluded because of quality concerns .
outcome measures and data extraction the extracted data included basic study information such as the experimental design , experimental period , country of the study , inclusion criteria , age and gender of the included patients , detailed experimental procedures , specific mechanical ventilation settings , clinical outcomes , and safety outcomes of the patients .
the primary outcome of this study was the pao2 / fio2 ratio .
if multiple pao2 / fio2 ratios were presented in a report , the last result was used .
the secondary outcomes of this study were pulmonary compliance and the duration of icu stay .
two groups extracted the data separately and then performed comparison and verification together .
if necessary , we contacted the corresponding authors to seek assistance in the case of missing data and sent a table containing the extracted data to those authors for supplementary data or verification .
ventilation strategies in this network meta - analysis , the parameters of ventilation strategies for icu patients without ards were specified .
lower peep was defined as peep lower than 10 mmhg , and higher peep was defined as peep higher than or equal to 10 mmhg [ 12 ] .
lower tidal volume was defined as lower than or equal to 8 ml per kg predicted body weight , and higher tidal volume was defined higher than 8 ml per kg predicted body weight [ 13 ] .
accordingly , six ventilation strategies were obtained ( table 1 ) .
table 1 six ventilation strategies for intensive care unit patients without ali or ards strategy a lower tidal volume and lower peep ( lower vt + lower peep ) b higher tidal volume and lower peep ( higher vt + lower peep ) c lower tidal volume and higher peep ( lower vt + higher peep ) d lower tidal volume ( lower vt + zeep ) e higher tidal volume ( higher vt + zeep ) f higher tidal volume and higher peep ( higher vt + higher peep ) lower positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) < 10 mmhg ; higher peep >= 10 mmhg ; lower tidal volume ( vt ) <= 8 ml / kg ; higher vt > 8 ml / kg. zeep zero end - expiratory pressure statistical analysis network meta - analysis combines the direct and indirect evidence for all relative treatment effects and provides estimates with maximum power [ 14 - 16 ] .
a network meta - analysis was performed using the gemtc [ 17 ] package in r ( i386 3.0.2 ) .
in this analysis , to maximize accuracy and power , the mean difference ( md ) and 95 % confidence intervals were used to evaluate the effect of each mechanical ventilation strategy on pulmonary compliance and the pao2 / fio2 ratio of icu patients without ards or ali [ 18 ] .
a difference was considered statistically significant when the range of the 95 % confidence intervals did not include zero .
model selection was based on the dias guidelines [ 19 ] for evaluating linear models .
dbar denotes the posterior mean of the residual deviance ; pd denotes the effective number of parameters ( leverage ) ; and dic denotes the deviance information criterion .
a smaller dbar value indicates a better model fit .
however , the model with the lowest dic is generally chosen to aid the interpretation by accounting for model complexity .
a lower dic value indicates a better model fit .
differences between the models of less than 3 to 5 were not considered significant [ 20 ] .
the models were run for 150,000 iterations , and convergence was assessed using the brooks - gelman - rubin diagnostic approach [ 21 ] .
we used a technique referred to as " back - calculation " [ 22 ] to evaluate the consistency of the findings of the network meta - analysis based on direct versus indirect evidence .
during this process , three types of models were estimated : unrelated study effects , unrelated mean effects , and consistency .
the output of the summary function can be plotted for a visual representation .
we investigated the possibility of statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency between the direct and indirect effect estimates by visually inspecting the forest plots and the i2 statistic using the higgins - thompson method ( low heterogeneity 25 % , moderate 50 % , and high 75 %) [ 23 ] .
we also ranked the different interventions in terms of their likelihood of leading to the best results for each outcome [ 12 ] .
in the markov chain monte carlo cycle , each ventilation strategy was ranked based on the estimated effect size .
these probabilities summed to 1 for each treatment and each rank .
x % means that the strategy achieves x % effectiveness .
thus , a higher percentage denotes a more effective intervention , although this ranking refers to only the considered possibilities rather than the actual effectiveness of a given ventilation strategy [ 18 ] .
results we identified 28,160 studies for review based on their titles and abstracts ( fig. 1 ) .
after an initial screen , we retrieved the full texts of 86 potentially eligible articles for a detailed assessment .
ultimately , we excluded 75 irrelevant full - text articles ( additional file 1 ) , and 11 randomized controlled trials [ 4 , 24 - 33 ] were included in the network meta - analysis .
these studies included 575 patients who received one of six ventilation modes ( table 1 ) .
unfortunately , ventilation strategies e ( higher vt + zeep ) and f ( higher vt + higher peep ) were isolated from the other ventilation strategies .
therefore , only the other four ventilation strategies were compared .

discussion serpa neto et al .
[ 8 ] published a traditional pairwise meta - analysis on ventilation strategies for patients without ali or ards in 2012 ; this meta - analysis applied no restrictions on the setting ( icu or operating room ) .
however , considering the effect of the surgical procedure , ventilation during an operation and ventilation in the icu are different , and this difference could lead to heterogeneous results .
therefore , we included only randomized controlled trials of icu patients without ali or ards .
this approach renders this meta - analysis more purposeful and scientific .
however , network meta - analysis has several shortcomings .
it is difficult to understand its methodological aspects .
this method is not perfect and poses various challenges ; for instance , we should carefully assess both conceptual and statistical heterogeneity as well as incoherence between included studies [ 34 ] .
furthermore , the results of a network meta - analysis are presented in two ways : probability ranking and the results of combined direct and indirect comparisons .
the estimates of treatment effects should be interpreted with caution due to their uncertainty because treatment rankings or probabilities can be misleading [ 34 ] , whereas a combined analysis of direct and indirect evidence produces more meaningful results based on published studies .
in this study , the pao2 / fio2 ratio was the primary outcome .
probability ranking showed that ventilation strategy c ( lower vt + higher peep ) was associated with the greatest increase in oxygenation ; in contrast , ventilation strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) ranked last and was associated with the lowest pao2 / fio2 ratio among all of the ventilation strategies examined .
moreover , based on direct and indirect comparisons , compared to strategies a ( lower vt + lower peep ) , b ( higher vt + lower peep ) , and d ( lower vt + zeep ) , ventilation strategy c ( lower vt + higher peep ) was the most effective ventilation strategy in terms of the pao2 / fio2 ratio , and these differences in effectiveness were statistically significant .
ventilator - associated lung injury is a common clinical complication in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation [ 35 ] .
an increased tidal volume can overstretch the alveoli ; this process is termed volutrauma , and overstretching is the main reason for ventilator - associated lung injury [ 35 , 36 ] .
although lower tidal volumes can cause distal alveolar collapse and inadequate ventilation , high peep can significantly compensate for this shortcoming by stimulating recruitment of collapsed alveoli to alleviate focal atelectasis , increase alveolar ventilation , and reduce the alveolar - arterial oxygen difference , thereby effectively relieving the occurrence of pulmonary shunting and ensure the delivery of arterial oxygen [ 37 , 38 ] .
simultaneously , a reduced tidal volume can reduce ventilator - associated lung injury [ 37 - 39 ] .
these phenomena could explain how ventilation strategy c ( lower vt + higher peep ) increased the pao2 / fio2 ratio and restored oxygen saturation .
pulmonary compliance was a secondary outcome in our study .
probability ranking indicated that ventilation strategy b ( higher vt + lower peep ) was associated with the highest pulmonary compliance but that ventilation strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) was associated with the lowest pulmonary compliance .
moreover , based on direct and indirect comparisons , we found that compared to strategies a ( lower vt + lower peep ) , b ( higher vt + lower peep ) , and c ( lower vt + higher peep ) , strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) was significantly associated with the lowest lung compliance .
the finding that ventilation strategy b ( higher vt + lower peep ) was associated with the highest pulmonary compliance could be related to the following reasons : ( 1 ) a high tidal volume during mechanical ventilation can expand small airways , fully open alveoli , and reduce intraoperative focal atelectasis , and peep can further increase the stability of opened alveoli and enhance pulmonary compliance [ 40 ] ; ( 2 ) peep can hold alveoli open at the end of exhalation , significantly increase functional residual capacity , enable the alveoli to begin to expand at a high functional residual capacity , avoid excessive expansion and contraction of the lungs during inhalation and exhalation , and reduce the destruction of lung tissue and its interstitial structure , and damage to the alveoli .
consequently , peep maintains the elastic recoil of the lung and enhances lung compliance [ 38 , 40 , 41 ] .
ventilation strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) was associated with the lowest pulmonary compliance and the smallest increase in oxygenation .
the mechanism underlying this association could be that a lower tidal volume during mechanical ventilation causes the distal alveolar and small airways to close , resulting in alveolar collapse , insufficient ventilation , increased intrapulmonary shunting , and a decreased pao2 / fio2 ratio .
this mechanism is supported by the findings of hu et al .
[ 42 ] .
hedenstierna et al .
[ 43 ] also found that atelectasis and airway closure can explain 75 % of the deterioration in pao2 during mechanical ventilation .
under conditions of alveolar collapse and reduced functional residual capacity resulting from a low tidal volume , lung compliance cannot be enhanced effectively .
this result is consistent with the results presented by bruno enekvist : low pulmonary compliance may be correlated with an increased number of collapsed alveoli [ 44 , 45 ] .
there were three reports on the duration of icu stay in our network meta - analysis , and those reports examined ventilation strategies a ( lower vt + lower peep ) , b ( higher vt + lower peep ) and c ( lower vt + higher peep ) .
compared to strategies b ( higher vt + lower peep ) and c ( lower vt + higher peep ) , strategy a ( lower vt + lower peep ) was significantly associated with a shorter duration of icu stay .
one reason for this benefit of strategy a is that lower tidal volume combined with lower peep can leave areas of alveolar collapse unaltered , avoiding cyclic recruitment / de - recruitment of distal lung units , while avoiding hyperinflation in normal lung regions , thus reducing end - inspiratory stress and lung inflammation and consequently minimizing ventilator - induced lung injury [ 46 - 48 ] .
in addition , the use of a low tidal volume together with lower peep ( 5 cm h20 ) in animal models can result in improved oxygenation [ 49 ] .
this finding is consistent with the results that were described by karsten et al .
[ 50 ] , who stated that lower peep combined with low vt prevents deoxygenation when there is pneumoperitoneum and leads to a lower atelectasis score based on computed tomography up to 2 hours postoperatively .
this study had several limitations .
the initial aim of this article was focused on the development of lung injury , overall survival , the incidence of pulmonary infection and atelectasis , the length of icu and hospital stay , time to extubation , the pao2 / fio2 ratio , and pulmonary compliance ; however , because of the small number of research articles that we included , there were no uniform outcome measures in our study .
aside from pao2 / fio2 ratio and pulmonary compliance , we extracted only one article on hospital length of stay and only two articles on overall survival .
moreover , the original results were incomplete , which indicates that this meta - analysis could only produce relatively simple results rather than comprehensive and diverse results .
we hope that there will be additional clinical research focused on the development of lung injury in the future .
conclusion the results of this meta - analysis showed that for icu patients without ali or ards , strategy c ( lower vt + higher peep ) was associated with the highest pao2 / fio2 ratio ; strategy b ( higher vt + lower peep ) was superior to the other strategies in improving pulmonary compliance ; strategy a ( lower vt + lower peep ) was associated with a shorter length of icu stay ; and strategy d ( lower vt + zeep ) was associated with the lowest pao2 / fio2 ratio and pulmonary compliance .

current test - of - cure practice in patients with chlamydia trachomatis ( ct ) infection is to confirm cure with a single test taken at least 3 weeks after treatment .
effectiveness of single - time - point testing however lacks a scientific evidence basis and the high sensitivity of laboratory assays nowadays in use for this purpose may compromise the clinical significance of their results .
prospectively following 59 treated ct infections , administering care as usual , the presence of ct plasmid dna and rrna was systematically assessed by multiple time - sequential measurements , i.e. on 18 samples taken per patient during 8 weeks following treatment with a single dose of 1000 mg azythromycin .
a high proportion ( 42 %) of ct infections tested positive on at least one of the samples taken after 3 weeks .
patients' test results showed substantial inter - individual and intra - individual variation over time and by type of naat used .
we demonstrated frequent intermittent positive patterns in ct test results over time , and strongly argue against current test - of - cure practice .
introduction current treatment practice in chlamydia trachomatis ( ct ) infections is challenged by a growing concern over the efficacy of azythromycin , currently the recommended antibiotic treatment [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
data indicating sub - optimal effectiveness were presented at the recent meeting of the international society for sexually transmitted diseases research ( quebec , canada july 2011 ) [ 4 ] .
it was also noted that assessment of actual treatment failure is hampered by the difficulty to differentiate between re - infection and antibiotic resistance in vivo .
to confirm clearance of ct infection , and thus deliver a proof of cure , clinicians can apply a single time - point test - of - cure , using nucleic acid amplification assays ( naat ) .
there are currently no data available on the optimal timing of testing for cure ; generally , testing no sooner than 3 weeks and no later than 3 months after treatment is recommended [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
current guidelines by the centers for disease control and prevention , advocate restricted use of a test - of - cure , i.e. only when a patient is pregnant , therapeutic compliance is questioned , symptoms persist , or re - infection is suspected [ 1 ] .
data on the actual use of a test - of - cure are scarce , although results from a recent large - scale us study among women suggested inadequate adherence to current testing guidelines [ 5 ] .
nevertheless , there are data suggesting that test - of - cure practices are by no means uncommon .
in the netherlands for example , 11 % of men and 27 % of women with an initial ct - positive test were retested within the first 3 months ( unpublished south limburg laboratory registry data ) .
in the us , 21 % of all repeat ct tests in women between 15 and 25 years of age who were enrolled in commercial health plans and had two or more ct tests , were performed within the second and third month ( personal communication j. heijne , msc. 2012 university of bern , bern , switzerland ) .
it should be noted though , that in this latter dataset the result of the initial ct test and reason for testing were unknown [ 6 ] .
effectiveness of the current test - of - cure practices using single - time - point testing however lacks a scientific evidence basis .
the current practice of using highly sensitive naat for test - of - cure practice has several well - known shortcomings [ 7 ] .
a positive result may reflect treatment failure with persistent infection , but may also reflect resolved infection by detecting the mere presence of ribosomal rna debris and non - viable ct dna [ 8 ] .
other possible explanations include detection of re - infection or transient ct dna after sex with an infected partner .
even in persistent infection , a positive test may be preceded by a negative post - treatment naat [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
the clinical conundrum of delivering a proof of cure is further addressed here .
we explored consistency in individual test - of - cure results by naat in hypothetical clinical situations , taken to reflect actual test - of - cure practices .
in a cohort of ct treated patients , we systematically assessed the presence of ct plasmid dna and rrna by multiple time - sequential measurements on 18 samples per ct infection taken during 8 weeks following treatment with a single dose of 1000 mg azythromycin .
results taking a test - of - cure at 23 , 26 , 30 , 37 , 44 and 51 days post - treatment , 14 % , 20 % , 16 % , 17 % , 22 % and 24 % , respectively , of the 59 ct infections tested positive for rrna and / or dna .
overall , 42 % ( n = 25 ) of the ct infections tested positive on at least one of the samples taken between 23 and 51 days ; 42 % ( n = 25 ) tested positive for rrna and 27 % ( n = 16 ) for dna .
the test results of these 25 infections showed substantial inter - individual and intra - individual variation over time and by type of naat used , as is shown in fig. 1. most infections tested positive intermittently .
inadequate self - sampling seemed unlikely as a possible explanation for intermediary ct - negative tests as human dna was detected in the majority of ct - negative samples ; samples from 3 ct infections did not contain human dna .
one cervicovaginal and 4 anorectal ct infections consistently tested rrna - positive , of which 2 anorectal infections also tested ct dna - positive in all samples taken between 23 and 51 days post treatment .
in total , 66 % of the 59 ct infections demonstrated test results that were consistently negative ( n = 34 ) or positive ( n = 5 ) for ct rrna and / or dna between 23 and 51 days post treatment .

each row represents a cervicovaginal or anorectal ct infection .
twenty five infections ( out of 59 ) had at least one positive sample between 23 and 51 days post - treatment and these 25 infections are displayed here .
self taken swabs were tested for ct rrna ( tma , tigris ; genprobe , san diego , us ) and plasmid dna ( real - time in house pcr ; amsterdam , the netherlands ) [ 12 ] .
discussion given the pattern of intermittent positive results and substantial variability between different types of naat used , it seems unjustified to interpret a single positive naat taken between 3 to 8 weeks post - treatment as treatment failure / persistence or ( re - ) infection .
likewise , the clinical significance of a single negative naat may be debatable .
our results reinforce the known difficulties in establishing a proof of cure .
a positive naat may occur due to treatment failure , but also due to other causes .
a negative naat may indicate cleared infection , but may also reflect persistent infection .
sexual history is not a reliable tool to confirm or rule out new ct infection , and at present there are no specific laboratory tests that allow clinicians to reliably distinguish between treatment failure / persistence or resistance .
it is a real , perhaps even insurmountable , challenge to overcome this problem .
yet , in current clinical practice a single time - point test - of - cure by naat is taken to reflect a patient 's ct clearance status .
alongside the positive aspects , i.e. reassurance of worried patients and , sometimes , more adequate treatment , the negative consequences of current test - of - cure practices - including unnecessary antibiotic treatment and laboratory testing - should not be overlooked .
considering that clinical significance of a positive test - of - cure by naat is unknown , sequential rather than single - time point testing may not solve the problem either .
the individual and public health gains and cost - effectiveness of test - of - cure practices by naat remain to be established .
treatment practice may need to focus more on improving compliance of the patient and their partners in treatment with state - of - the - art regimens [ 11 ] and increasing the proportion of patients re - tested after 3 to 12 months , in accordance with current recommendations [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .

study population and setting by convenience sampling at our outpatient std clinic ( south limburg , the netherlands ) , 46 non - pregnant women and 6 men were included , contributing 44 cervicovaginal and 15 anorectal infections ; 7 women contributed infections from both anatomic sites .
participants provided a total of 1016 self - taken cervicovaginal and / or anorectal swabs taken over a period from 0 until 51 days post - treatment , at pre - defined points of time .
overall , 94 % of samples were delivered according to schedule , and were laboratory tested .
all patients were negative for hiv , gonorrhea and lymphogranuloma venerum ( the latter was tested in anorectal ct - positive samples only ) .
usual care recommending abstinence or safe sex for one week and providing treatment for steady partners was administered [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
participants provided written informed consent .
analyses swabs were tested for ct rrna ( tma , tigris ; genprobe , san diego , us ) and plasmid dna ( real - time in house pcr ; amsterdam , the netherlands ) [ 12 ] .
all ct - negative samples taken at the 2 time points preceding and following a ct - positive sample between 16 and 51 days post - treatment were re - tested for human dna to rule out that a negative result was due to inadequate sampling .
test results of samples not containing human dna were considered missing in analyses .
the proportion of rrna and / or dna - positive samples was assessed during 23 and 51 days post - treatment the authors thank the participants of this study for their contribution ; the staff of our sti clinic , especially elfi brouwers , msc , marita werner , md , and laura spauwen , msc , for their involvement in the study design , recruitment of participants , and study logistics ; jolein pleijster , msc ( vumc ) and staff of the public health laboratory of amsterdam for sample handling and diagnostics ; sylvia bruisten , phd , ( laboratory amsterdam ) and ingrid van den broek , phd , ( rivm , bilthoven ) for their contributions in the interpretation of the results ; and volker hackert , md , for editing assistance .

background hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) accounts for major cancer - related deaths despite current advanced therapies .
treatment and prognosis of hcc is better in patients with preserved liver function .
many natural products including ajwa dates ( phoenix dactylifera l. ) , are claimed to have hepatoprotective and hcc inhibitory effects , but most lack scientific validation .
to prove our hypothesis , we attempted to evaluate the hcc inhibitory effects , and other beneficial properties of the aqueous extract of ajwa dates ( ade ) in a rat model of diethylnitrosamine ( den ) induced liver cancer .
methods thirty - two male rats were divided into four groups of eight each as follows , group a : untreated control ; group b : den control ( 180 mg / kg bw ) , group c : den + ade 0.5 g / kg bw ; and group d : den + 1.0 g / kg bw. rats from all groups were assessed for liver cancer progression or inhibition by evaluating histological , biochemical , antioxidant enzyme status , cytokines and gene expression profiles .
results den treatment groups ( b , c , d ) showed histological features of hcc and in rats treated with ade ( groups c , d ) partial to complete reversal of normal liver architecture was observed .
antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , glutathione reductase ( gr ) , glutatione peroxidase ( gpx ) and catalase ( cat ) were increased , while the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) and alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) levels and lipid peroxidation were significantly decreased in group c and group d compared to group b. pro - inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( il ) - 1alpha , il - 1beta , , gm - csf ) were increased in the serum of rats in group b while the anti - tumor cytokines ( il - 2 , il - 12 ) were increased in ade treated groups ( c , d ) .
in addition , alpha - feto protein ( afp ) and il - 6 gene expression levels were upregulated in group b , while they were significantly downregulated in ade treated groups ( c , d ) .
conclusions ade helped in the reversal of den damaged liver towards normal .
restoration of anti - oxidant enzymes , liver enzymes , cytokines balance and gene expression to normal levels following ade treatment indicates that ade improves liver function and inhibits hcc .
ade can , therefore , be used together with conventional therapeutics for hcc .

hcc is one of the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ksa ) .
hcc is the 4th most common cancer in males and 8thcommon cancer in females accounting for 4.3 % of the reported cancer cases in the year 2013 [ 2 ] .
a global estimation of 40,710 new cases and 28,920 deaths due to liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers in 2017 highlights the need for improvement in current management strategies [ 1 ] .
common risk factors for liver cancer include heavy alcohol consumption , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) , hepatitis c virus , obesity , tobacco smoking , diabetes and genetic factors .
partial hepatectomy , embolization and sorafenib ( nexavar ( r )) [ 3 ] offer partial to complete success depending upon the stage of the disease .
the incidence of high mortality and associated side effects following chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy increase the demand for alternative medicine for the cancer treatment .
not surprisingly , many potent anticancer compounds were isolated from the plants viz .
doxorubicin , taxol , etoposide , cisplatin , vinblastine , vindesine , vincristine and topotecan [ 4 ] .
given the current interests in alternative medicine , it is imperative that much - concerted effects are undertaken to identify novel compounds that will aid therapy and also help to avoid its unjustifiable use .
date fruit ( phoenix dactylifera l. ) is a native fruit of arid region , largely cultivated as an economical and food crop in the middle east , southern europe , north africa , south america , india , and pakistan [ 5 ]. of the many varieties of date fruits , ajwa dates are unique for its medicinal properties and these are specifically grown in the city of al - madina al - munawwarah , ksa [ 5 ] .
ajwa dates are a rich source of energy , and readily provide sugars , proteins , vitamins , high dietary fibers , minerals and fats [ 6 ] .
they contain various phytochemicals like sterols , polyphenols , flavonoids and glycosides [ 6 ] .
ajwa dates have hypolipidemic , antioxidant , anti - inflammatory , cardioprotective , nephroprotective and hepatoprotective effects [ 7 ] .
in addition , the concentrated polyphenols and ex vivo digested extracts from ajwa dates inhibited growth and proliferation of colon cancer caco - 2 cell line [ 8 ] .
also , ( 1 - - > 3 ) - beta - d - glucan , which is an essential component of dates had an inhibitory effect on sarcoma - 180 in vivo in mice [ 9 ] .
recently , we identified that methanolic extract of ajwa dates inhibited human breast adenocarcinoma ( mcf - 7 ) by causing cell cycle inhibition and induction of apoptosis [ 10 ] .
interestingly , so far no studies have been done to identify the effects of ajwa or other dates on hepatic cancer .
many in vitro and in vivo models of hepatic cancer have been utilized in the past to evaluate various drugs .
in vivo hepatic cancer model development is done using various chemical methods , of which diethylnitrosamine ( den ) is a chemical carcinogen , commonly utilized to induce liver carcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress and liver damage [ 11 ] .
hence in the present study , we used the den - induced hepatic cancer model in wistar rats and evaluated the cancer inhibition effects of the aqueous extract of ajwa dates ( ade ) .

comparisons were made between untreated control ( group a ) and den control ( group b ) and their significance were represented using asterisk (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ) and hash (# p < 0.05 , ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 ) respectively discussion increased incidence of hcc in the west are partly due to an earlier epidemic of hcv , prevalence of obesity and diabetes which are associated with non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) whereas it is declining in the eastern population especially in taiwan and singapore in response of active implementation of hbv immunization , and the prognosis remains poor with an overall survival rate below 9 % [ 12 , 13 ] .
hcc does not respond to chemotherapy and fairly responds to radiotherapy and therefore have limited therapeutic options when the tumor becomes unresectable [ 12 ] .
this opens up the prospects of alternative medicines and natural products or their secondary metabolites , have been demonstrated to have hepatoprotective and anticancer benefits [ 6 , 7 ] .
den is a strong hepatocarcinogenic substance that causes disturbances in nucleic acid repair mechanisms and also generates reactive oxygen species ( ros ) leading to oxidative stress [ 13 ] .
as such in the present study , we utilized den to develop the rat model of hcc , and evaluated the hepatoprotective and antitumour properties of ade .
ade effectively restored the normal liver architecture , oxidative marker status and cytokines balance ( fig. 6 ). fig. 6 summary of the effect of ade on the den - induced liver cancer in wistar rats following den , the characteristic histological features of liver , namely the hexagonal lobular structure with radially arranged hepatocytes , the central vein in the middle and peripheral portal triad were disorganized or lost .
this could be attributed to the chain of events starting with oxidative stress , leading to membrane damage , inflammatory cell infiltration , cellular atypia and eventual transformation into hcc [ 14 ] .
administration of ade not only inhibited the adverse effects of den but also helped in partial to complete restoration of histological features ( fig. 1 ) .
the reversal of the toxic effects of den by ade is probably due to reduction or complete inhibition of the oxidative stress and improvement in the antioxidant status ( fig. 2 ) .
this is supported by the results observed in the present study where , the antioxidant enzymes namely sod , gr , gpx and cat were increased and lpo was reduced .
restoration of the antioxidant system and improvement in both liver structure and function by ajwa dates has been reported in earlier studies in response to different hepatocarcinogens [ 5 , 15 ] .
luteolin , a bio - active flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables are known to inhibit the oxidative stress and restore histopathological features following den toxicity [ 14 ] .
luteolin is present in ajwa dates [ 8 ] , and this probably contributed to the reversal of oxidative stress and restoration of normal liver architecture in the present study .
in response to a hepatotoxic agent the liver enzymes namely alt , ast , alp , gamma glutamyl transpeptidase increase and are indicative of hepatic insufficiency [ 7 , 16 ] .
in the present study too , elevated levels of alt , ast and alp with den treatment were reduced following ade ( 0.5 g / kg bw and 1.0 g / kg bw for 10 weeks ) ( fig. 3 ) .
similar to our findings , pre - and post - administration of date fruit extract to rats treated with dimethoate , a liver toxic agent had helped restoration of alt and ast to near normal levels [ 17 ] .
in yet another study [ 18 ] , where carbon tetrachloride ( ccl4 ) induced hepatotoxicity in rats were used , the elevated levels of the liver enzymes alt , ast and alp returned close to their baseline values upon treatment with date seed extracts ( 1 g / kg bw for 4 weeks ) .
the polyphenolic compounds comprising of phenolics , flavonoids , stilbenes and lignins present in various plants , fruits and vegetables are known to exert hepatoprotective effects [ 7 ] .
the total phenolic content measured as from date palm flesh is approximately 290 mg / 100 g and in date seeds it is 38.8 mg / g [ 8 ] , expressed as gallic acid equivalent .
therefore , the observed hepatoprotective effect following ade treatment in den - induced hcc model ( fig. 6 ) in the present study could probably be due to the high phenolic contents in the palm date flesh .
cytokines are the pleiotropic hormones of the immune system that play a pivotal role in the initiation , maintenance and progression of tumors [ 19 ] .
neoplastic cells and tumor - associated macrophages ( tam ) secrete il - 6 , csf - 1 , il - 10 , tgf - beta , tnf - alpha , il - 1alpha , angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth factors that promote tumor development [ 20 , 21 ] .
in our study , den administration specifically increased the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines , such as il - 1alpha , il - 1beta , gm - csf , and treatment with ade effectively attenuated these cytokines ( fig. 4 ) .
studies have shown that flavonoids have anti - tumor and anti - inflammatory properties and are capable of reducing the serum levels of th1 cytokines [ 22 ] .
the presence of major flavonoids such as apigenin , quercetin , and luteolin in ajwa could be one of the reason for reduced serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , tnf - alpha and il - 6 ) , and hepatoprotection observed in den - induced hcc in rats [ 23 , 24 ] .
furthermore , lower levels of gm - csf by itself effectively reduces the concentrations of other proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta and tnf - alpha [ 25 ] .
in the present study , that the levels of both il - 2 and il - 12 were reduced significantly with den treatment but increased following ade administration .
another pro - inflammatory cytokine il - 4 , which is implicated in tumor promoting activities however , remained unaffected with den treatment compared to untreated normal .
the cytokines il - 2 and il - 12 although considered to be pro - inflammatory , they negatively regulate tumor behavior [ 26 , 27 ] , and are currently in clinical use / trials [ 26 ] .
proanthocyanidins were reported to decrease the inflammation associated with 2,4 - dinitrofluorobenzene and ultraviolet b uvb treatment in mice , by increasing the il - 12 concentration [ 28 ] .
proanthocyanidins are found in dietary fruits including ajwa dates and this could be attributed to the observed increase in the levels of il - 12 [ 7 , 28 ] .
cancer is associated with inflammation and some of the inflammatory markers such as tnf - alpha , il1 , il - 6 become increased in hcc and after den administration [ 29 - 31 ] , as both are associated with inflammation .
in addition , cancer diagnosis or prognosis depends on identification of biomarkers .
afp is a commonly used marker in hcc and its serum [ 32 , 33 ] .
afp and its receptor have been implicated in hbv mediated malignant transformation of hepatocytes and also in their metastasis via pi3k / akt - mediated signaling [ 33 ] .
in the present study we observed that both afp and il - 6 gene expression were downregulated in response to ade treatment ( fig. 5 ) .
administration of luteolin ( 20 mug / kg bw , intraperitoneally ) in mice decreased the plasma levels of afp that was initially increased after den treatment [ 22 ] .
similarly , luteolin administration ( 30 mg / kg bw , orally ) decreased the gene expression levels of il - 6 in den and ethanol - mediated hepatic inflammation in mice [ 34 ] .
ajwa dates or its constituents namely luteolin thus appears to have beneficial properties against hcc .
conclusions ade demonstrated significant beneficial effects against den induced hcc in rats .
the anti - inflammatory , hepatoprotective and anticancer properties observed in the present study could be due to the presence of flavonoids such as luteolin , apigenin , quercetin and proanthocyanidins in dates which are rich in polyphenolic compounds .
as such dates and or its constituents can be taken together with conventional chemotherapeutics , for synergistic benefits against hcc .

background thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytological features on fine needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology have a 20 % risk of thyroid cancer .
the aim of the current study was to determine the diagnostic utility of an 8 - gene assay to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid neoplasm .
methods the mrna expression level of 9 genes ( kit , syngr2 , c21orf4 , hs.296031 , ddi2 , cdh1 , lsm7 , tc1 , nath ) was analysed by quantitative pcr ( q - pcr ) in 93 fna cytological samples .
to evaluate the diagnostic utility of all the genes analysed , we assessed the area under the curve ( auc ) for each gene individually and in combination .
braf exon 15 status was determined by pyrosequencing .
an 8 - gene computational model ( neural network bayesian classifier ) was built and a multiple - variable analysis was then performed to assess the correlation between the markers .
results the auc for each significant marker ranged between 0.625 and 0.900 , thus all the significant markers , alone and in combination , can be used to distinguish between malignant and benign fna samples .
the classifier made up of kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , tc1 , hs.296031 and braf had a predictive power of 88.8 % .
it proved to be useful for risk stratification of the most critical cytological group of the indeterminate lesions for which there is the greatest need of accurate diagnostic markers .
conclusion the genetic classification obtained with this model is highly accurate at differentiating malignant from benign thyroid lesions and might be a useful adjunct in the preoperative management of patients with thyroid nodules .
thyroid fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) area under the curve ( auc ) computational model preoperative diagnosis background thyroid nodules represent a very common problem .
the majority (> 95 %) of them are benign ; however , malignancy risk increases with female gender , nodule size , extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years ) , personal or family history of thyroid malignancy and radiation exposure [ 1 ] .
the advent of thyroid ultrasound allowed for an increasing number of nodules to be diagnosed , and it is now recognized that nodules are present in an estimated 50 % of the general population and are detected at subclinical level .
however , since only 10 % of these nodules will be a true malignancy , preoperative testing to differentiate benign from malignant nodules are needed [ 2,3 ] .
currently , fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology is the most accurate and cost effective diagnostic test to exclude a thyroid cancer diagnosis .
in general , a thyroid nodule on fna cytology can be classified as benign , malignant , suspicious , indeterminate , or non - diagnostic [ 4 ] .
unfortunately , about 30 % of fnas are indeterminate and often require a diagnostic thyroidectomy to establish the diagnosis on permanent histological examination .
only 20 % of diagnostic thyroidectomies in patients with indeterminate fna cytology demonstrates malignant lesions on permanent histology , and these patients often require a completion thyroidectomy [ 5 ] .
therefore , because of this obvious limitation of fna cytology in the preoperative diagnosis , there is a clinical need for reliable preoperative molecular markers to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules .
a 10 - gene ( kit , syngr2 , c21orf4 , hs.296031 , hs.24183 , fam13a1 , c11orf8 , kiaa1128 , impact , cdh1 ) and a 6 - gene ( kit , lsm7 , syngr2 , c21orf4 , hs.296031 , hs.24183 ) assays have been proposed to have high diagnostic accuracy to distinguish thyroid nodules [ 6 ] .
those assays have been developed from microarray analyses of tumor specimens obtained after surgical removal of thyroid nodules .
since only 20 % of patients undergoing surgery have malignant lesions , preoperative tests are needed to avoid unnecessary surgery .
gene expression profiling studies have identified many other possible markers with high accuracy , however the clinical application of these markers is limited to the use of post - surgical samples .
fna cytology represents a useful tool in the preoperative evaluation of a thyroid nodule , especially because of the knowledge of the amount of tumor cells per sample .
in a previous paper [ 7 ] we showed the clinical relevance of kit expression to the diagnosis of thyroid tumors , whose rna was extracted from cytological preoperative fna specimens .
although kit expression resulted to increase the diagnostic accuracy of 15 % compared to the cytology alone , there were samples still remained indeterminate .
the aim of the current study was to build a q - pcr - based computational model able to preoperatively diagnose benign and malignant thyroid tumors on the basis of the expression profiles of the genes mentioned above ( kit , syngr2 , c21orf4 , hs.296031 , hs.24183 , cdh1 , lsm7 ) , plus two other genes ( tc1 , nath ) known to be involved in thyroid carcinogenesis from the literature [ 8 - 10 ] .
in addition , since braf sequencing is so far the best molecular test used in the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules malignancy , we also built a model including braf mutational status .
in the last years , a new class of techniques known as bayesian neural networks ( bnn ) have been proposed as a supplement or alternative to standard statistical techniques .
for the purpose of predicting medical outcomes , a bnn can be considered a computer intensive classification method and , in addition , bnns do not require explicit distributional assumption ( such as normality ) [ 11 ] .
as previously described by us , kit is down - regulated in malignant thyroid tumors compared to the benign ones .
syngr2 has been characterized as an integral vesicle membrane protein [ 12 ] and the only data available indicate its up - regulation in fetal mouse ovaries [ 13 ] .
lsm7 has been described in the family of sm - like proteins , involved in pre - messenger rna splicing and decapping [ 14 ] .
the interaction of lsm7 with the tacc1 complex may participate in breast cancer oncogenesis [ 15 ] .
c21orf4 encodes a predicted trans - membrane protein ( tmem50b ) and is one of few genes significantly over - expressed during cerebellar development in a down syndrome mouse model [ 16 ] .
the role of syngr2 , lsm7 and c21orf4 in thyroid carcinogenesis has not yet been explored .
e - cadherin ( cdh1 ) expression is reduced in thyroid carcinomas [ 17 ] and its promoter resulted to be hypermethylated in thyroid neoplasm [ 18 ] .
hs.24183 ( now hs.145049 ) has been identified as part of the 3'utr of ddi2 ( dna - damage inducible 1 homolog 2 ) gene in h. sapiens , but no data exists about its role in thyroid .
for hs.296031 the only information available refers to gene sequence and mapping , but no gene and protein function are known yet .
in contrast , the expression of the thyroid cancer - 1 ( tc1 ) gene resulted to be related to malignant transformation in thyroid and the potential use of tc1 gene expression as a marker of malignancy has also been shown in literature [ 19 ] .
nath ( n - acetyl transferase human ) is involved in protein acetylation which represents an important post - translational modification regulating oncogenesis , apoptosis and cell cycle .
nath resulted to be over - expressed at the mrna level in papillary thyroid carcinomas compared to non - neoplastic thyroid tissue [ 8 ] .
in this study we used 87 fna cytological samples to build several preoperative computational models and 6 unknown samples to test in order to find the most discriminative one .
a correlation analysis between the markers was also performed in order to investigate their biological importance and to find a link that could give us a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid cancer development .
methods thyroid specimens preoperative thyroid fna slides of a total of 93 patients carrying thyroid lesions ( 49 malignant , 38 benign , 6 unknown ) were selected from archived materials of the section of cytopathology , division of surgical , molecular and ultrastructural pathology , s. chiara hospital , pisa .
for ethical reasons we used only cases with two or more slides per patient and the molecular analysis was performed on only one of the available smears .
in all cases fna was performed using ultrasonography guidance .
all smears were reviewed by a senior cytopathologist .
diagnosis was carried out on the basis of the following criteria broadly suggested in the literature : smear background , cell arrangements , cell shape , nuclear / cytoplasmic features , presence of nucleoli and mitosis .
the histological diagnosis assessed ultimately the malignancy or benignity of the 93 thyroid lesions .
ethical board this study was approved by the internal review board of the university of pisa .
all patients gave their consent for the participation to the study .
rna and dna isolation archival fna slides stained with papanicolaou technique were kept in xylene for 1 to 3 days , depending on the time of storage , in order to detach slide coverslips .
the slides were then hydrated in a graded series of ethanol followed by a wash in distilled h2o for 1 minute .
the slides were finally air dried .
rna extraction was performed using a commercial kit ( high pure rna paraffin kit , roche ) .
the lysis solution was poured on the slide to scrape off the cytological stained sample .
whole scraped tissue was then collected in a microcentrifuge tube and processed for rna extraction .
the quantity / quality of rna was estimated with nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer using 1 mul of undiluted rna solution .
rna was treated with dnase iota recombinant , rnase - free ( roche ) .
rna was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 mul , containing 5x rt buffer , 10 mm dntps , 50 ng / mul random primers , 0.1 m dtt , 40 u / mul rnaseout , 50 mum oligo ( dt ) , depc - treated water , 15 u / mul cloned amv reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
dna was isolated directly from stained cells using a commercial kit ( nucleospin , macherey - nagel , duren , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
gene expression analysis the level of kit , syngr2 , c21orf4 , hs.296031 , ddi2 , cdh1 , lsm7 , tc1 , nath expression was analysed by quantitative pcr ( q - pcr ) on the rotor - gene 6000 real time rotary analyzer ( corbett , life science , australia ) following the manufacturing instructions .
endogenous reference gene ( b2m , beta 2 microglobulin ) was used to normalize each gene expression level .
pcr products were previously sequenced using the applied biosystems 3130xl genetic analyzer ( foster city , ca ) to confirm gene sequence .
pcr was performed in 25 mul final volume , containing 5 mul of cdna , 12.5 mul of mesa green qrt - pcr mastermix plus ( eurogentec , san diego , ca ) , 40 pmol of each primer ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) per reaction with the following cycling conditions : initial denaturation 95degreesc for 5 min ; 40 cycles at 95degreesc for 15 sec , 61degreesc for 40 sec , 72degreesc for 40 sec ; final step 25degreesc for 1 min .

to verify primers specificities , melting curve analysis was performed .
fluorescent data were acquired during the extension phase .
after 40 cycles , a melting curve for each gene was generated by increasing the temperature from 50degreesc to 99degreesc ( 1degreesc for each step ) , while the fluorescence was measured .
for each experiment a no - template reaction was included as a negative control .
for each cdna sample the ratio between the expression value of the gene of interest and the expression value of b2m was calculated .
mean values and standard deviations of malignant and benign groups were calculated as well .
braf status braf sequence was screened for v600e mutation by pyrosequencing .
dna was first amplified using " rotor - gene 6000 " ( corbett research ) and then sequenced using pyromark q96 id system .
pcr was performed with the following conditions : initial denaturation 95degreesc for 3 min ; 40 cycles at 95degreesc for 30 sec , 55degreesc for 30 sec , 72degreesc for 30 sec ; final step 60degreesc for 5 min with takara ex taq ( qiagen ) .
pcr amplification and mutational analysis were performed in accordance to the diatech manual ( anti - egfr moab response braf status ) .
statistical analysis gene expression analysis mann - whitney test and student 's t - test were used to determine differences between mrna expression levels of kit , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , syngr2 , tc1 , hs.296031 and cdh1 and nath , respectively .
all the analyses were performed using statgraphics centurion ( v. 15 , statpoint , inc. ) .
roc analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the molecular computational model , we calculated the area under the curve ( auc ) of the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve for each gene individually and in combination using logistic regression analysis ( medcalc 11 , medcalc software , stata software ) .
bnn classifier several computational models ( neural network bayesian classifiers ) were built in order to find the best combination of markers able to discriminate benign from malignant thyroid samples using statgraphics centurion ( v. 15 , statpoint , inc. ) .
molecular diagnosis fisher 's test was used to compare samples correctly classified by the bnn model according to their probability score (> 90 % and < 90 %) .
the diagnostic gain was then calculated after applying molecular tests ( braf , kit and bnn model ) .
correlation analysis in order to evaluate the biological importance of the markers analysed , a multiple - variable correlation analysis was performed between the markers ( partek software ) .
results gene expression levels kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 mrna expression levels were significantly different between benign and malignant tumors , p ( kit ) < 0.0001 ; p ( cdh1 ) = 0.004 ; p ( lsm7 ) = 0.03 ; p ( c21orf4 ) = 0.01 ; p ( ddi2 ) = 0.0001 .
no statistically significant difference was found for nath , syngr2 , tc1 , hs.296031 .
among the markers , all but tc1 resulted expressed higher in benign samples compared to the malignant ones ( figure 1a ) .

braf status among the 49 malignant samples , 28 carried the v600e mutation .
all the benign samples were wild - type .
sensitivity and specificity of braf test were 57 and 100 % , respectively .
roc analyses we employed receiver - operated characteristics ( roc ) curve analyses to determine model robustness for predicting malignancy in thyroid samples using the expression of each gene individually ( figure 1b , table 1 ) .
among the markers , kit showed the highest auc ( 0.9 ) .
we also performed a roc analysis for the statistical significant markers ( kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 ) and braf status in combination , the auc resulted to be 0.8824 , the sensitivity 91 % and specificity 63 % ( figure 1c ) .
although the auc resulted quite similar to the kit one , the predictive power increased when the markers were combined together .

neural networks the expression data of the markers were used to build bayesian neural networks ( bnn ) in order to estimate the probability of thyroid malignancy .
we built several bnns in order to find the most predictive one .
this procedure uses a probabilistic neural network ( pnn ) to classify cases into malignant and benign categories , based on 9 input variables ( kit , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , syngr2 , tc1 , hs.296031 , cdh1 , nath ) , by implementing a nonparametric method for classifying observations into one of benign and malignant groups based on the observed expression variables .
the neural network bayesian classifier made up of all markers has a predictive power of 80 % , while the classifier made up of kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , tc1 and hs.296031 resulted to have a predictive power of 87.7 % .
the analysis was then conducted on 6 unknown samples .
the pathological diagnosis for each sample was kept blinded until after the analysis was completed .
when the blind was broken , we found that 5 of the 6 unknown samples were diagnosed by the model in concordance with the diagnosis determined by standard pathological criteria .
we also built a neural network classifier made up of the markers used in the most predictive model ( kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , tc1 and hs.296031 ) plus braf status .
this classifier had a predictive power of 88.8 % , and , more importantly , it resulted to completely discriminate the 6 unknown samples when the blind was broken ( table 2 ) .
when applying the bnn model , no classification errors came out when the probability of diagnosis was higher than 90 % , thus allowing us to use this model as a correct predictor of samples with a probability score > 90 % ( p < 0.0001 ) .

among the indeterminate samples ( ifp and sptc ) at the cytological level , 11 sptc were correctly diagnosed as malignant by braf test , 4 additional samples were correctly classified by kit model as 1 malignant and 3 benign , and 9 additional samples were diagnosed by the bnn model as 1 malignant and 8 benign .
as shown in table 4 , when applying the molecular analysis , 13 malignant samples were moved to the diagnostic group of ptc and the total number of ptc raised from 30 ( 61 %) to 43 ( 88 %) with a malignancy diagnostic gain of 27 % .
similarly , 11 ifp samples were moved to the diagnostic group of bn and the total number of bn rose from 19 ( 50 %) to 30 ( 79 %) with a benignity diagnostic gain of 29 % .
finally , if we consider both ptc and bn diagnoses , the whole diagnostic gain is of 28 % with a statistically significant p - value of 0.0001 .
correlation analysis a multiple - variable analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the markers .
the knowledge of the correlation of the markers could give us a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying thyroid cancer biology .
in fact , the statistical correlation may reflect biologically correlation between markers .
pearson 's correlations between pairs of variable are reported in figure 2 .

discussion many candidate markers of thyroid cancer have been identified in microarray studies that require analytic and clinical validation in a cohort large enough to permit evaluation of their clinical utility .
q - pcr has become a highly reliable technique that allows precise quantification of gene expression levels identified by microarray studies from various laboratories [ 20 - 22 ] .
moreover , q - pcr has been in clinical use as a diagnostic test in various fields of medicine .
currently , the diagnosis of thyroid nodules relies primarily on cytology .
for the majority of patients with ptc , fna - based cytology can make a diagnosis with high accuracy [ 3 ] .
however , there is a significant proportion of neoplasm in which the fna - based preoperative cytological diagnosis fails .
the primary aim of this study was to find a diagnostic accurate preoperative assay able to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid neoplasm .
we found 5 out of 9 proposed gene markers ( kit , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , cdh1 ) differentially expressed in malignant and benign thyroid samples with a significant p - value (< 0.05 ). of particular interest is the down regulation of kit and cdh1 in malignant samples .
we previously showed that the expression silencing of kit gene is associated with the malignant phenotype of thyroid nodules and kit expression may represent a useful tool in the preoperative management of thyroid lesions [ 7 ] .
kit is a well - known proto - oncogene .
other studies obtained findings similar to ours [ 6,23 ] .
we speculated that in some cell types kit expression positively regulates mitogenesis and is selected for in neoplastic transformation ; in other tissues ( such as thyroid tissue ) kit is involved in morphogenesis and differentiation and is , therefore , negatively selected in the course of tumor progression .
although the functional consequences of this modulation are unknown so far , kit is likely to be relevant in regulating thyrocyte differentiation and survival , however further work is needed to elucidate the biological meaning of kit down - expression in ptcs .
cdh1 encodes for e - cadherin .
we found a down regulation of cdh1 expression in malignant samples and this is in perfect concordance with the literature .
loss of e - cadherin function or expression has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis [ 24 - 26 ] .
in fact , e - cadherin down - regulation decreases the strength of cellular adhesion within a tissue , resulting in an increase in cellular motility .
this in turn may allow cancer cells to cross the basement membrane and invade surrounding tissues .
regarding tc1 , several studies reported a higher expression of this protein in thyroid malignancies compared to benign nodules .
concordant to the literature , we observed a tendency of tc1 to be overexpressed in our cohort of malignant samples , though not statistically significant .
tc1 has been shown to interact with chibby ( cby ) [ 27 ] , which regulates the beta - catenin - mediated transcription antagonistically and thereby enhances the signaling pathway through relieving the suppression by cby .
tc1 regulation of cby is of considerable biological significance in the wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
indeed tc1 up - regulates beta - catenin target genes implicated in invasiveness and aggressive behaviour of cancer .
for the other markers it is difficult to speculate since their function and role in thyroid carcinogenesis are still largely unknown .
additional functional studies are needed to elucidate their role in thyroid cancer initiation and progression .
when assessing the diagnostic utility of the markers , kit , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , and cdh1 had a high diagnostic accuracy .
thus , all the significant markers , alone and in combination , can be used to distinguish between malignant and benign fna samples .
recently , a new class of techniques known as bayesian neural networks ( bnn ) have been used as a supplement or alternative to standard statistical techniques [ 11 ] .
since they do not require explicit distributional assumptions , bnns have been employed for the classification of medical outcomes [ 11 ] .
we developed a bayesian artificial neural network model based on data collected from fna samples .
bayesian classification has been applied across the spectrum of medicine , from optimization of pharmacotherapy dosing [ 28,29 ] , predicting cancer screening [ 30 ] and diagnostic test results [ 31,32 ] , to determining injury severity [ 33 ] , assessing operative risk [ 34 ] and predicting surgical outcomes [ 35 - 38 ] .
we built several neural networks and the most predictive one has resulted to be made up of kit , cdh1 , lsm7 , c21orf4 , ddi2 , tc1 and hs.296031 , with a power of 87.7 % .
the network was then validated on 6 unknown samples .
the model determined the accurate diagnosis of 5 of 6 unknown samples tested , based on a comparison to the gold standard pathological diagnosis as determined by clinical pathologists .
it 's important to notice that we have put in the model also two non - significant markers ( tc1 , hs.296031 ) , because their contribution to the predictive power seemed to be relevant .
in fact , some variables although not significant may increase the discriminative power to a model refining the predictions .
the classifier built using also braf mutational status resulted to have a predictive power of 88.8 % and to successfully discriminate the unknown samples when the blind was broken ( table 2 ) , thus the gene expression analysis combined to the braf mutational analysis may represent a very useful test to preoperatively discriminate benign from malignant thyroid tumors .
the probability of the prediction of diagnosis for almost all the samples resulted to range between 95 % and 100 % , thus , although the general prediction value is 88.8 % , the predictive power to assess each sample individually can reach a value of 100 % .
these data also strengthen the importance of the 8 - markers model as an adjunctive tool for the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules .
we also stratified the samples depending on both the histological and cytological diagnoses ( table 3 ) .
the diagnostic gain obtained by applying braf molecular analysis , kit expression model and bnn model was then calculated. by applying the bnn model , no classification errors came out when the probability of diagnosis was higher than 90 % , thus allowing us to use this model as a correct predictor of samples with a probability score > 90 % ( p < 0.0001 ) .
we then calculated the diagnostic gain after applying molecular tests ( table 4 ) .
among the uncertain samples ( ifp and sptc ) at the cytological level , 11 were correctly diagnosed by braf test , 4 additional samples by kit model and 9 additional samples by the bnn model .
it is important to point out that ifp lesions are often very difficult to diagnose even at frozen section and in this study we developed a molecular approach that is able to correctly classify as certain benign 46 % ( 11 / 24 ) of ifp lesions .
therefore using molecular approaches these patients would have been clinically enrolled to the follow up group instead of sent to surgery .
thus , the combined use of the molecular tests resulted to produce a diagnostic gain of 28 % ( table 4 ) .
basically , what we propose in this paper is the use of braf molecular analysis ( after uncertain cytological diagnosis ) to assess the malignancy of thyroid nodules in the first place , then the use of kit model for the indeterminate nodules and at last the use of the 8 - gene model to ultimately assess the diagnosis of the nodules that otherwise would remain suspicious ( figure 3 ) .
the combinatorial power of these tools could definitely increase the percentage of thyroid nodules correctly classified while decreasing the ones remained indeterminate .

all these findings strengthen the importance of molecular pathology where morphology and molecular alterations represent a powerful approach to diagnosis .
in this line , this study aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of the 8 - gene expression model as an adjunctive tool in the preoperative management of thyroid nodules .
we demonstrated that the 8 - gene expression model provides an increased diagnostic power to the molecular pathology approach based on braf mutation and kit expression analysis .
we also performed a multiple variable analysis among all the markers , independently on the diagnostic classification , in order to evaluate a possible functional correlation among the markers ( figure 2 ) .
in literature there is no evidence about the biological correlation among the well - studied markers ; however it is interesting to note that the unknown marker hs.296031 statistically correlates with nath , c21orf4 , ddi2 , syngr2 and tc1 .
this may reflect also a biological correlation , thus , further studies are needed to explore this phenomenon .
conclusion the genetic classification obtained with the model here presented is highly accurate and may provide a tool to overcome the difficulties in today 's preoperative diagnosis of thyroid malignancies .
we hoped that the quantitative nature of this test will be a useful gene - based objective adjunct to the preoperative diagnosis of a disease that currently relies solely on cytology .

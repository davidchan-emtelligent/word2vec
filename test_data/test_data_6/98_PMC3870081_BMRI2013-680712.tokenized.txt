1. introduction breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women that ranks second as the cause of cancer death after lung cancer and as a result there are a large number of studies performed to find novel and effective treatments .
presently combination of chemotherapeutic agents has been developed for breast cancer therapy [ 1 - 3 ] .
doxorubicin is among the most active anticancer agents widely used in treatment of solid tumors and leukemia [ 1 ] with cytotoxic , cytostatic , and antineoplastic effects .
it works by attacking cells that grow quickly such as cancer cells , but due to its no specificity in inducing cell death some side effects such as bone marrow depression , reduced immunity , cardiovascular toxicity , and several side effects are arisen [ 4 , 5 ] .
since then , much research has been done for targeting this drug to decrease its side effects , increase its toxic dose in targeted tissues , and deliver the drug exclusively [ 6 - 10 ] .
one strategy for improving the antitumor selectivity and toxicity profile of cytotoxic agent is use of magnetic carriers [ 11 - 15 ] .
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( fe3o4 ) with a core ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm in diameter are powerful targeted delivery vehicles in various biomedical applications [ 12 ] .
these particles have organic or inorganic coating , on or within which a drug may be loaded and they are delivered by an external magnetic field to their target tissue .
furthermore , when the external magnetic field is removed they do not exhibit any residual magnetic interaction at room temperature and hence they are unlikely to agglomerate and so uptake by phagocytes .
therefore , they remain in the circulation after injection and pass through the capillary systems of organs and tissues avoiding vessel embolism and thrombosis [ 13 , 16 ] .
some of these nanoparticles coated by synthetic and natural polymers or stabilized in micro - and nanogels , colloidal systems , liposomes , micelles , and microcapsules or transferred by cationic lipids , polylysine , and protamine sulfate have low entrapment efficiency of drug molecules , release drug molecules immediately not at the appropriate site , or make the particle size larger than the desirable range .
therefore , they do not show enough stability and have tendency to aggregate which leads to toxicity [ 17 ] .
such formulations are predominantly taken up by phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system and cleared from blood circulation before they are able to reach the site of the tumor cells and finally reduce the magnetic nanoparticles efficiency [ 18 ] .
recently various anticancer drugs including paclitaxel , methotrexate , mitoxantrone , and doxorubicin have been conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles to enhance tumor targeting [ 15 , 19 - 21 ] .
there are a number of suitable methods for drug delivery in nanoparticulate systems such as physical complex with hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug [ 15 , 22 , 23 ] and cleavable covalent linkage [ 21 ] that release the drug molecule at the target site .
drugs loaded by hydrophobic interactions typically attach to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles and limit unspecific cellular interaction .
this approach provides solutions to drugs that interact with healthy tissue .
there are several methods for drug targeting ; it can be achieved either by passive targeting or by active targeting [ 18 ] .
conjugating the therapeutic molecules such as methotrexate that has affinity to target cells on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles is helpful , but in other cases the use of physical interactions such as electrostatic interactions and hydrophilic / hydrophobic interactions is more useful for coupling of drug molecules on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles .
there are some reports that use magnetic nanoparticles for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents .
hence , they should be capable not only for drug delivery but also for protecting the loaded drug .
as a result , coating and loading methods are essential to release drug in appropriate site and at a desired rate .
superparamagnetic iron oxide loaded into polymeric micelles assembled from a copolymer of polyethylene glycol and poly - epsilon - caprolactone has been used for increasing mri sensitivity [ 24 ] .
magnetic nanoparticles modified by 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane have been reported for methotrexate delivery and mri imaging .
these magnetic nanoparticles are capable of targeting folate receptors in mcf - 7 cell line in breast cancer [ 21 ] .
due to the overexpression of the folate receptors in a number of malignant cell lines such as ovary , breast , brain , lung , and colorectal cancers [ 25 , 26 ] and low expression of the folate receptor in a number of normal human tissues [ 27 ] in the present study we used this targeting agent that is overexpressed at breast cancer tissues of the type of mcf - 7 to internalize the designed drug delivery system through endocytosis .
hence mcf - 7 cells were used as the cell lines that express folate receptors more than mda - mb - 468 cells to comprise the effect of folic acid targeting on internalization of optimal formulation in breast cancer .
for this purpose micelle forming fa / dex - ra copolymer was used to coat the magnetic nanoparticles and load doxorubicin to target the breast cancer cells dually .
this copolymer provides micelles with a core architecture wherein the hydrophobic core served as a carrier for hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticle coated with oleic acid , while the hydrophilic shell interacted with doxorubicin hcl as a hydrophilic drug .
previous studies on fa / dex - ra showed that this copolymer was nontoxic and had high capacity to produce micelles enabling the particle stabilization in aqueous solutions [ 7 ] .
the aim of this study was production of a dual targeted drug delivery system of doxorubicin for breast cancer treatment which could reduce the side effects of the drug in nontargeted tissues while accumulating it in the cancerous locations .
for this purpose , fa / dex - ra was used as the coating biomaterial for the magnetic nanoparticles which was loaded with doxorubicin and further application of an external magnetic field could localize them in target tissues and internalize them within the desired cells .

3. results and discussion 3.1 .
synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles there are several methods to produce stable superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles [ 11 , 12 , 28 ] .
although most of these methods provide convenient way to synthesize mnps , but they also face some disadvantages such as large particle size distribution , aggregation , poor crystallinity , complicated purification , large amount of solvent required , and cost of their production and require exhaustive control of experimental conditions [ 12 , 18 , 28 ] .
in this study , the hydrothermal method was used to develop mnps since this method has some advantages like feasibility of large scale production and relative cost effectiveness .
besides there is well control on the agglomeration of metal nanoparticles and the nanoparticles are easily modified for synthesis in the presence of oleic acid and other surfactants [ 29 , 30 ] .
hence , this method finally results in synthesis of mnps coated with oleic acid which can be encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of prepared micelles .
3.2 .
characterization of oa - coated mnps and micelles of fa / dex - re loaded with mnps and doxorubicin oa - coated mnps and anticancer drug of doxorubicin were loaded into the folate targeted micelles , as shown in scheme 1 .
3.2.1 .
particle size and zeta potential the particle size and distribution measurements of mnps coated with oleic acid were obtained using a dynamic light scattering ( dls ) instrument .
they showed the mean particle size of 20 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.2 which indicates low diversity of the particle size .
the routes of synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles play an important role in determination of the particle size , shape , and size distribution [ 12 , 28 ] .
adjusting parameters such as total concentration of cations , temperature , pressure , and ph can lead to monodisperse particles and desirable size by using hydrothermal method [ 31 , 32 ] .
in this respect , the temperature used was set at 180degreesc for 20 h which produced nanosized particles with well - defined crystal shape and high homogeneity [ 24 , 33 ] .
besides , the surface of the iron oxide core was coated with oleic acid which led to minimize the size distribution and aggregation of the magnetic cores in the process of hydrothermal method [ 34 ] .
the results of physicochemical properties of different formulations of micelles loaded with mnps and doxorubicin are shown in table 3 .
as seen polydispersity index ( pdi ) of the prepared magnetic micelles was between 0.3 and 0.5 ( table 3 ) which indicates low diversity of the particle size .
pdi is calculated from the square of the standard deviation / mean diameter ; thus less value of pdi indicates enhanced homogeneity of the magnetic micelles [ 7 ] .
as it can be seen in figure 1 , the most effective parameter on the particle size of the magnetic micelles was the interaction between shaking rate and polymer content and the other parameters had no significant effect on the particle size .
variety groups of polymers with different concentration have been used to coat mnps to serve functional goals [ 11 ] .
changing the polymer content besides polymer type may affect the particle size and pdi [ 22 ] .
furthermore , the particle size could be decreased with increasing the shaker rate [ 7 ] due to aggregation of particles in their medium [ 35 , 36 ] .
it is reported that temperature and medium type are two important factors that control the particle size [ 37 , 38 ] , but in the present study the effect of temperature was rare ( figure 1 ) .
our previous studies on the physicochemical properties of fa / dex - re copolymer showed that the drug concentration had a significant impact on particle diameter of micelles [ 6 , 7 ] .
however , in the present study the drug content of magnetic micelles was kept constant .
after entrapping the mnps in the copolymeric micelles the particle size grew ( table 3 ) .
it can be considered that the polymer content can have important effect on particle size .
3.2.2 .
icp analysis the icp analysis confirmed the entrapment of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles into micelles ( table 3 ) .
as figure 2 indicates many factors affected the fe3o4 loading in nanoparticles such as shaking time , fe3o4 / polymer ratio , shaking rate , polymer content interaction , and temperature , but as it can be seen in figure 2 temperature was the most important factor affecting loading efficiency of fe3o4 , while the role of other factors was negligible and changing temperature from level 1 to level 2 , that is , increasing the temperature , decreased the fe3o4 loading in micelles due to increasing the particle size and aggregation of oa - coated mnps .
some studies reported that environmental factors such as temperature have a main effect on shape , zeta potential , particle size , magnetic properties , and morphology [ 32 ] .
so an appropriate range of temperature is suggested to load magnetic nanoparticles in each particular formulation .
although the increased temperature in current study led to decrease fe3o4 loading efficiency but in another study worked on carboxylated polyamidoamine dendrimers it has been shown that elevated temperature caused highly stable and soluble magnetodendrimers [ 12 ] .
moreover , previous report indicated that the temperature played an important role in controlling the swelling state of the poly - n - isopropylacrylamide ( pnipam ) as a thermoresponsive polymer which influenced the drug release and loading efficacy [ 39 ] .
in other words , enhanced loading of the magnetic nanoparticles in some polymers by increasing the temperature may be due to the swelling properties of the carrier polymer in response to the temperature and consequently higher loading of fe3o4 is reported .
however , in our study no swelling depended on temperature was seen in the copolymeric micelles and hence no extra loading of fe3o4 was seen by temperature enhancement , but on contrary it was reduced .
3.2.3 .
determination of doxorubicin loading in the magnetic micelles considering the studied variables , that is , shaking rate ( 75 - 150 rpm ) , shaking time ( 0.5 - 1 h ) , temperature ( 40 - 60degreesc ) , and fe3o4 / copolymer ( 25 - 33 % of copolymer weight ) , it can be seen in figure 3 that the shaker rate was the most important factor affecting the drug loading efficiency .
so that by increasing the shaker rate , the loading efficiency decreased effectively .
therefore , it may be concluded that magnetic nanoparticles coated with fa / dex - ra copolymer which have negative charged functional groups can couple with ionized doxorubicin via electrostatic interaction in an optimized appropriate shaker rate [ 7 , 11 , 12 ] .
as seen in figure 3 , the other effective factors on loading efficiency are shaking time and the interactions of shaker rate with fee % and temperature .
these results show that there are different effective factors on the loading of drugs in different carriers that may be generally divided into two categories , that is , ( i ) environmental factors and ( ii ) the manner in which the drug interacts with the specific polymeric carriers such as polymeric nanoparticles , liposomes , and micelles [ 12 ] .
although our previous study [ 7 ] showed that increased polymer content resulted in less drug loading efficiency , in the present study the effect of polymer content on this parameter was lower than the environmental factors such as shaking rate and time and their interaction ( figure 3 ) .
this might be because the amount of polymer used in this study was nearly in the optimum range like the pervious study .
as a result , using fa / dex - ra copolymer in a desirable range can ensure high loading efficiency .
the nature and amount of the drug are the other factors that affected the loading efficiency ( figure 3 ) .
morales et al .
[ 40 ] reported that the high hydrophobicity of paclitaxel made it difficult to develop into an effective drug delivery system .
in the current study we cannot represent the effect of the drug content on the loading efficiency due to a constant concentration of doxorubicin used in all formulations , but obviously , as mentioned before , the positive charge of doxorubicin caused its attachment to the corona of magnetic micelles .
however , yoo and park [ 6 ] reported that doxorubicin loading efficiency in polyethylene glycol - folate conjugate polymer gradually decreased as the initial applied drug was increased .
as a result it may be concluded that the environmental factors along with the polymer type and concentration , the way that the drug binds to the polymer , and the nature and amount of the drug play an important role in controlling the drug loading efficiency and lead to success release of the drug molecule at the target site .
3.2.4 .
in vitro release of doxorubicin from magnetic micelles figure 4 shows the release profiles of doxorubicin versus time for each studied magnetic micellar formulation .
this figure indicates that all formulations except for p 20 f 25 t 1 r 75 t 60 , p 20 f 33 t 1 r 75 t 40 , and p 30 f 25 t 0.5 r 75 t 40 released almost 100 % of the loaded drug during 120 min , 75 min , and 105 min , respectively .
in the others drug release lasted for more than 3 h. in all of them after a rapid burst release the remaining drug was released with a near zero order kinetic .
this may be interpreted as doxorubicin dissolved in the corona of magnetic micelles was leaked promptly into the release medium and the next slow release phase was due to the drug diffusion through the inner layer of the magnetic micelles [ 19 , 41 ] .
in this study the ph of the release medium was considered to be constant by using phosphate buffer solution ( pbs ) ( 0.2 m , ph 7.4 ) containing 2 % of tween 20 , but previous studies [ 18 , 41 ] reported that the release of doxorubicin from magnetic micelles was ph dependent ; for example , yang et al .
[ 42 ] reported that doxorubicin release at ph 5.0 was much faster than that at ph 7.4 from both formulations containing poly ( ethylene glycol ) and poly ( 3 - caprolactone ) copolymers .
as seen in figure 5 polymer concentration and fe3o4 / polymer ratio were two important parameters that affected the release efficiency .
increasing the polymer concentration ( i.e. , changing from level 1 to level 2 ) led to decrease the release efficiency possibly by enhanced electrostatic interactions between doxorubicin and the polymer .
hayama et al .
[ 43 ] reported that in release of camptothecin from polymeric micelles modified by folate - peg - lipid the higher folate surface density led to the lower drug release due to the affinity interactions of folate coupling .
furthermore , zhang and misra [ 44 ] demonstrated that an acid - labile hydrazine bond between carbonyl group of doxorubicin and hydrazide group of dextran - g - poly ( n - isopropylacrylamide - co - n,n - dimethylacrylamide ) affected the release efficiency in acidic environment .
as mentioned earlier , the other main effective factor on release efficiency was fe3o4 / polymer ratio , increasing this ratio decreased the release efficiency from the micelles ( figure 5 ) .
considering this fact that the drug release is governed mainly by two mechanisms of drug molecules diffusion and polymer matrix degradation , it can be concluded that every variable that affects the polymer nature can change the drug release behavior .
zhu et al .
[ 45 ] represented that increasing the polymer concentration effectively prevented 5 - fu release by forming the thicker polymer wall .
since drug release can be magnetically triggered from the drug - conjugated magnetic nanoparticles [ 18 ] , it has been shown that at appropriate temperature range and by using thermosensitive polymers with magnetic core drug diffuses out of the micelles under temperature control [ 14 ] .
zhang and misra [ 44 ] reported that dextran - g - poly ( nipaam - co - dmaam ) as a thermosensitive smart polymer can regulate drug release in response to temperature changes by swelling and deswelling in the vicinity of lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) ~ 40degreesc .
however , in our study as figure 5 indicates that increasing the temperature from level 1 to level 2 decreased the release efficiency and consequently we may conclude that the lower ratio of fe3o4 / polymer along with the lower level of temperature led to enhanced drug release .
decreasing the temperature in the production process of the micelles that increased the drug release efficiency probably has caused the loose arrangement and less coiling of the hydrophilic dextran blocks of fa / dex - ra around the core and easier release of the entrapped drug .
this effect agrees well with what nayebsadrian et al .
[ 7 ] have reported before .
thus , under our experimental conditions , the drug release is influenced by the copolymer content , fe3o4 / polymer ratio , and temperature ( figure 5 ) .
notably , another aspect for future research is using magnetic field and studying its effect on the controlled release of the trapped drug .
3.2.5 .
physical characterization of magnetic nanoparticles and micelles to confirm the presence of oleic acid on the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles , ft - ir analysis was done ( figure 6 ( a )) .
the core of magnetic nanoparticles produced a sharp signal in 592 cm - 1 due to fe - o bonds and it is attributed to supramagnetic properties of fe3o4 nanoparticles [ 44 , 46 , 47 ] .
in this spectrum the asymmetric ch2 and the symmetric ch2 stretching bonds shifted from 2921 and 2851 cm - 1 , to a lower frequency region , respectively , compared to pure oleic acid ( figure 6 ( b )) .
this is because of a crystalline state caused by the monolayer of oleic acid as a hydrocarbon molecule surrounding the magnetic nanoparticles [ 46 ] .
the adsorption bond around 1700 - 1730 cm - 1 in the spectrum of pure oleic acid ( figure 6 ( b )) is due to the c = o stretching bond of the carboxyl group that is absent in the spectrum of the coated magnetic nanoparticles ( figure 6 ( a )) .
instead , it shows two new bonds at 1434 and 1528 cm - 1 revealing the asymmetric ( coo - ) and the symmetric ( coo - ) stretching that is caused by the bonding of the oleic acid molecules to the magnetic nanoparticle surface [ 48 ] .
pure oleic acid exhibited that a broad peak at 2400 - 3400 cm - 1 ( figure 6 ( b )) corresponds to o - h stretching vibration of carboxylic acids [ 47 ] , but it became much weaker that it is assigned to the chelating bidentate type interaction between the coo - group and the fe atoms [ 46 ] .
figure 6 ( c ) represents the ft - ir spectra of mnps coated with fa / dex - ra copolymer .
in this spectrum the distinctive peaks are seen at 596 cm - 1 ( characteristic peak of fe3o4 ) , 2922 and 2857 cm - 1 the asymmetric ch2 stretching and the symmetric ch2 stretching bonds of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( fe3o4 ) coated with oleic acid , respectively , and the major peaks for fa / dex - ra ( figure 6 ( d )) that were represented in a previous study [ 7 ] .
figure 7 shows xrd pattern of the oa - coated mnps .
the crystal size was calculated to be 20.17 nm using scherrer 's equation : particle size = 0.9lambda / betacos theta , where lambda is the x - ray wavelength and equal to 0.1546 nanometer , beta is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity equal to 311 , and theta is the bragg angle equal to 35.5 / 2 = 17.75 .
six characteristics peaks are seen in figure 7 for fe3o4 nanoparticles ( 2theta = 30.1,35.5,43.2,53.4,57.5,62.7 ) marked by their indices ( 220,311,400,422,511,440 ) .
as can be seen the position and relative intensity of all peaks match well with diffraction data of standard fe3o4 powder , indicating that the sample is fe3o4 crystal [ 22 , 47 ] .
thermogravimetric analysis was performed to further confirm the presence of oleic acid and fa / dex - ra copolymer on the surface of the oa - coated mnps and optimal micelles , respectively .
hence , the freeze - dried powder was used to achieve this analysis .
as it can be seen in figure 8 oa - coated mnps had a weight loss of ~ 46.14 wt % ( iron oxide core content 53.86 wt %) , whereas optimal micelles lost ~ 75.37 wt % ( iron oxide core content 24.63 wt %) and this data agreed with what was reported by icp method that was used for measuring the loading efficiency of fe3o4 in the micelles ( table 3 ) and can confirm that additional weight loss in the case of optimal micelles is due to fa / dex - ra coating copolymer .
it is clear from the data that the oa - coated mnps contained nearly 50 wt % .
figure 8 indicates that two desorption processes occurred in the oa - coated mnps in the vicinity of 210 and 685degreesc .
these different desorption processes were explained by zhang et al .
[ 46 ] so that the oleic acid was adsorbed as a bilayer structure on the surface of iron oxide particles .
the external layer is expected to be absorbed by physical bonds and the internal layer has a chemically bonding pattern [ 22 ] .
figure 9 shows the dsc thermogram of oa - coated mnps and indicates the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of oa - coated mnps as a function of temperature .
a large endothermic transition was found at 655.6degreesc for oa - coated mnps , which may be related to the oleic acid molecules binding chemically and directly to the mnps nanoparticle .
furthermore , the melting point of oleic acid attached physically on the surface of mnps was observed around 20degreesc that agrees well with gonzales and krishnan 's report [ 49 ] .
this finding is interestingly agreeable with the tga results seen in figure 8 that showed that oleic acid was coated on the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles as a bilayer adsorption .
in the study reported by zhao et al .
[ 50 ] on characterization of magnetic nanoparticles of fe3o4 and cofe2o4 , they found that the oleic acid molecules were coated as a bilayer adsorption on the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles , while it was a single layer adsorption for cofe2o4 nanoparticles .
3.2.6 .
particle size and morphology particle size and morphology of mnps can be seen in figure 10 ( a ) by tem study .
according to the scale bar of the graphs , the results of particle size are in agreement with scherrer 's result discussed before in xrd results .
the nanoparticles are obviously discrete spherical shapes and separate from their neighbors by the organic ligands adsorbed on the particles surface .
a typical tem photograph of fa / dex - ra coated mnps is shown in figure 10 ( b ) .
results suggest that micelles were fairly smooth and spherical in shape , and the size was ranging between 200 and 250 nm. according to the stability test data ( figure 15 ) , the particle size was expected to shift to 200 - 300 nm after 24 - 48 h and it is the reason for much larger particle size obtained from the tem micrographs compared to dls method ( table 3 ) .
in another aspect , tem micrograph shows that the fe3o4 nanoparticles coated with oleic acid are entered into the micelles core due to their hydrophobic properties [ 51 ] .
3.2.7 .
magnetic properties figure 11 displays the superparamagnetic property of oa - coated mnps and fa / dex - ra magnetic micelles in the powder state at room temperature .
the saturation magnetization ( sigma s ) was determined to be 53.6 and 12.58 emu / g for oa - coated mnps and fa / dex - ra magnetic micelles , respectively .
according to the reduction in sigma s value of magnetic micelles compared to oa - coated mnps ( figure 11 ( a )) , it can be concluded that the presence of an organic coating on the surface of oa coated iron oxide has led to a decrease in saturation magnetization [ 35 , 51 ] .
the nature of the curves at small magnetic fields shows the coercivity of 26 oe due to the non - superparamagnetic property at room temperature ( figure 11 ( b )) .
3.3 .
optimization computer optimization process by design expert software ( version 7.2 , usa ) and a desirability function determined the effect of the levels of independent variables on the responses .
all responses were fitted to the linear model .
table 3 shows that the constraint of particle size was 109.0 +/ - 4.3 nm <= y1 <= 164 +/ - 7.6 nm with targeting the particle size on minimum , for drug loading efficiency the constraint was 73.0 +/ - 0.4 % <= y3 <= 100.0 +/ - 0.0 % with the goal set on maximum , the re3 % constraint was 57.4 +/ - 2.45 % <= y4 <= 100.2 +/ - 0.99 % with the target set at the range of the obtained results , and for fee % it was 2.5 % <= y5 <= 13.5 % with the goal set at the maximum .
twelve different formulations were designed with design expert software by an irregular factorial design ( table 3 ) and optimized magnetic micelles processing situation was suggested by desirability of 100 % as using fa / dex - ra copolymer content of 20 mg , fe3o4 / polymer ratio of 25.4 % , temperature of 40.4degreesc , shaking time of 0.5 h , and shaking rate of 75 rpm .
the predicted and actual values of responses are shown in table 4 .
these results showed that the error percent was - 0.84,0.15,0.02 , and - 0.04 for particle size , loading efficiency , re3 % , and fee % , respectively .
as seen in table 4 the actual results were in close accordance with the predicted values by the software .
3.4 .
protein binding the magnetic nanoparticles developed for preclinical setting and human application should be formulated into a suitable delivery system with appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters .
different proteins of the blood serum such as albumin bind to the surface of such particles due to their high hydrophobicity and change their fate before reaching the intended target [ 52 ] .
in the present study , fa / dex - ra polymer was used as a biodegradable organic coating [ 12 , 18 ] to reduce protein adsorption .
figure 12 shows the total amount of the absorbances of the blank magnetic micelles and the bsa solutions are almost the same as the absorbance of the mixture of these two solutions .
the small deviation or increase in the absorbance may be related to the spectrophotometer error .
the mnps demonstrate no significant change in the uv absorbance of the optimal formulation before and after incubation with bsa as an in vitro protein binding test .
if the protein binding was observed , it was expected that the absorbance to be reduced , but obviously the data indicates that each solution represents its own absorbance at lambda max = 277.5 nm. in the study reported by sun et al .
[ 53 ] on the poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( peg ) coated iron oxide nanoparticles , they found that peg coating played an essential role to reduce protein adsorption .
on the other hand , yallapu et al .
[ 52 ] observed a slight change in the surface morphology and particle size of magnetic nanoparticles loaded with curcumin and coated by beta - cyclodextrin and pluronic 68 after incubation with mouse or human serum .
although many coating materials can reduce protein adsorption , prolong serum half - life , and thus increase efficiency of the particles internalization by target cells [ 21 , 22 , 47 ] , it has been shown that dextran coated particles have completely different adsorption behavior [ 44 ] .
this makes dextran an appropriate coating material for molecular targeting due to its minimizing of the interaction between the magnetic core and plasma proteins and therefore slower clearance from circulation system [ 44 ] .
3.5 .
in vitro cytotoxicity tests cell survival percentages of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 468 cells are shown in figure 13 .
doxorubicin loaded magnetic micelles targeted with folic acid in the absence and presence of magnetic field were compared with free doxorubicin .
to show the effect of folate targeting , mcf - 7 overexpressing folate receptors [ 20 , 42 , 54 ] were compared with mda - mb - 468 cells often considered as negative folate receptor breast cancer cells [ 54 ] .
as can be seen from figure 13 ( a ) in mcf - 7 cells the survival percentage was decreased in targeted micelles both in absence and presence of magnetic field compared to free doxorubicin .
the folate targeted micelles showed the lowest ic50 of 0.05 mum compared to free doxorubicin which showed the ic50 of 0.5 mum .
this effect agreed with what was reported by previous studies and showed that the presence of magnetic external fields besides targeting with special ligands led to increasing cytotoxic effects of different formulations [ 6 , 42 , 43 , 55 ] .
figure 13 also shows that the magnetic field led to efficient internalization of magnetic micelles within the cells .
so that the highest inhibitory growth effect was observed in cells treated with fa / dex - ra mnps in the presence of magnetic field at 1 mum concentration that is approximately two and four times greater than the effect observed with fa / dex - ra mnps without local magnetic field and free doxorubicin at the same concentration , respectively .
figure 13 ( b ) indicates that in mda - mb - 468 cells the most cytotoxic effect occurred at 1 mum concentration of fa / dex - ra mnps with applied magnetic field compared to free doxorubicin and fa / dex - ra mnps without application of the magnetic field .
interestingly , there were no significant difference between magnetic targeted micelles without magnetic field and free doxorubicin , due to ineffective internalization of fa / dex - ra mnps within the folate receptor negative cells ( figure 13 ( b )) .
yang et al .
[ 41 ] worked on superparamagnetic iron oxide doxorubicin loaded micelles targeted to folic acid receptors and reported that applying an external magnetic field localized the magnetic micelles in kb cells after which folic acid as a targeting ligand would allow their binding to the cell membrane receptors and enhance the micellar uptake inside the tumor cells .
in another study , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of mcf - 7 and l929 cells indicated negative contrast enhancement for mcf - 7 cells over l929 cells ( folic acid negative receptor ) when methotrexate - conjugated magnetic nanoparticles were used [ 20 ] .
it is noteworthy that as a whole , the dual targeting effect of folate conjugated micelles and loaded fe3o4 was more effective in cell growth inhibition because of increasing the concentration of doxorubicin loaded magnetic nanoparticles at the desired site [ 12 ] .
3.6 .
cellular uptake of magnetic micelles figure 14 represents the cellular uptake of doxorubicin loaded fa / dex - ra mnps in the absence and presence of external magnetic field determined by using fluorimetry method .
the quantitative measurement of magnetic micelles uptake by mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 468 cells demonstrates higher uptake by mcf - 7 cells in the presence of magnetic field .
these data are in agreement with results obtained in the mtt assay ( figure 13 ) and revealed once more the dual targeting effect of fe3o4 - loaded and folate - conjugated dextran / retinoic acid copolymer to target cells in the presence of a suitable magnetic field .
there is significant difference between mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 468 in terms of folate targeting ( p < 0.05 ) .
however , further investigation on the several concentrations of folic acid targeted micelles in different magnetic field strengths is necessary to establish the efficacy of the developed magnetic micelles for various therapeutic applications [ 41 ] .
3.7 .
stability test the stability study was performed by measuring the size of the optimized formulation of magnetic micelles at the various designated time points under room temperature .
as it can be seen in figure 15 that the particle size of the micelles measured by zetasizer versus time increased with time which is probably due to the aggregation of the micelles with time , but the dispersion was very stable for almost one month .
whereas in the study reported by chandrasekharan et al .
[ 51 ] at its best condition the particle size of micelles was just observed to be stable for 12 days .
in the current study the optimal formulation showed great stability for one month and neither any aggregation nor sedimentation was observed .
furthermore , these data indicate that the optimal formulation is much stable until 30 days and a gradual increase in particle size from 132 to 698 nm was observed .
the results obtained from this test agreed with what was reported by previous studies on dextran micelles [ 7 ] .
4. conclusions fa - dex / ra magnetic micelles were prepared for dual targeted delivery of doxorubicin for breast cancer cells .
a micellar carrier from a block copolymer , folate - conjugated dextran / retinoic acid copolymer , has been developed to encapsulate oa - coated magnetic fe3o4 and to deliver doxorubicin as the anticancer drug .
oa - coated mnps were synthesized successfully by hydrothermal method .
the best formulation of fa - dex / ra magnetic micelles prepared by direct dissolution method was that containing 20 mg of fa / dex - ra copolymer , fe3o4 / polymer ratio of 25.4 % , fabrication temperature of 40.4degreesc , shaking time of 0.5 h , and shaking rate of 75 rpm .
the highest growth inhibitory effect was observed in mcf - 7 cells treated with fa / dex - ra mnps in the presence of magnetic field at 1 mum concentration , so these micelles demonstrated the potential to achieve dual tumor targeting ( i.e. , magnetic field - guided and folate - targeting ) of micelles to breast cancer cells .
this may reduce the required dose of doxorubicin and consequently reduces the side effects of this drug .
the results should be checked in vivo to confirm the promising results obtained from the cell culture tests .

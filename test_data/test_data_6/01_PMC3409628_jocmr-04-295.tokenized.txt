a 68 year - old - male with hepatitis c - positive liver cirrhosis was admitted because of liver abscess .
after metronidazole was initiated against the infection , mental disturbance appeared .
hepatic encephalopathy was suspected at first , however , the brain mri showed hyperintense lesion of the bilateral basal dendric nuclei which indicated metronidazole - associated encephalopathy .
the symptoms became well after cessation of the drug .
metronidazole is a widely used medicine against various infections .
recent case reports describe that this medicine can induce reversible encephalopathy .
however , there have been few reports regarding metronidazole - induced encephalopathy occurred in patients with cirrhosis .
here we report on a case of hepatic cirrhosis and abscess in which reversible metronidazole - induced encephalopathy developed .
metronidazole encephalopathy liver cirrhosis introduction metronidazole ( mnz ) is a widely used medicine against various infections .
recent case reports show that this medicine can induce reversible encephalopathy [ 1 - 4 ] .
however , there have been few reports regarding mnz - induced encephalopathy occurred in liver cirrhosis .
here we report on a patient suffered from liver cirrhosis with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy who developed mnz - induced neurotoxicity .
case report a 68 year - old - male , who had suffered from liver cirrhosis due to hepatic c virus infection , was referred to teikyo university hospital ( tokyo , japan ) in august 2004 , because of continuous fever rising .
he had several hospitalization episodes for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma including transarterial chemo - embolization therapy , and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy in recent five years .
on admission , the body temperature reached up to 39.7 degreesc , the blood pressure was 105 / 72 mmhg , the heart rate was 95 beats / minutes , and inflammatory change and marked hepatic dysfunction was seen in the blood tests ( table 1 ) .

blood culture showed klebsiella pneumonia and clostridium perfringens , then imipenem and clindamycin was administered at first .
since the inflammatory change continued , clindamycin was changed to mnz 1500 mg / day .
infection began to be improved after initiation of mnz , however , speech and gait difficulty with mental disturbance suddenly appeared on the 19th day after mnz administration .
although hepatic encephalopathy was suspected at first , the serum ammonia level did not show higher value than ever ( 56 mg / dl ) and neurological findings were not compatible with the disease .
brain mri showed hyperintense lesion of the bilateral basal dendric nuclei which was specific for those of metronidazole - associated encephalopathy ( fig. 3 , fig. 4 ) , as well as hyperintensity of basal nuclei showing chronic hepatic encephalopathy ( fig. 5 ) .
after mnz was ceased , the neurological abnormalities were improved gradually .
mr image showed disappearance of hyperintensity of the dendric nuclei one month later ( fig. 6 ) .
the patient was discharged by walking alone three months later .

figure 2 computed tomography with contrast medium ( portal phase ) .
the presence of abscess was suspected at the right lobe of the liver .
figure 3 brain mr imaging ( flair ) showed hyperintense area of the bilateral basal dendric nuclei which was specific for those of metronidazole - associated encephalopathy .
figure 4 mr imaging ( flair ) also showed hyperintense lesion of the brain stem .
figure 5 brain mr imaging ( t1wi ) showed hyperintensity of basal nuclei indicating chronic hepatic encephalopathy .
figure 6 the hyperintensity of the dendric nuclei in mri was disappeared one month later .
discussion metronidazole is a widely used antimicrobial agent against several infections due to clostridium difficile , amoeba , helicobacter pylori , and so on. the serious adverse effects of the drug include bone marrow suppression , liver or renal injury , and peripheral nerve injury .
incidence of the side effect regarding central nerve system is considerably rare , however , recent case reports showed reversible neurological disorders diagnosed by specific mri of the finding of hyperintensity at the dendric nuclei and the brain stem [ 1 - 4 ] .
although the pathophysiology of the phenomenon remains unclear , some have suggested the rna binding , dna binding of intermediate metabolites of mnz , or the modulation of gamma - aminobutyric acid receptor as possible mechanisms [ 5 - 7 ] .
in the present case , severe liver dysfunction due to cirrhosis would facilitate the occurrence of the side effects because mnz is mainly metabolized by the liver [ 8 , 9 ] .
diagnosis of the disease can be made by the specific mr imaging mentioned above .
regarding this patient , although past history of hepatic encephalopathy made us think the recurrence at first , the neurological findings were different from the condition .
effective treatment for mnz - induced neurotoxicity is cessation of the drug .
although severely ill case was reported , it recovered finally .
the recovery of this case seemed slower than other reported cases , probably because the liver dysfunction prolonged metabolism and excretion of the drug .
in conclusion , we experienced mnz - induced encephalopathy developed in patients with liver cirrhosis .
brain mri demonstrated the specific finding of the hyperintensity at the dendric nuclei , which seemed good tool for its diagnosis and evaluation of the improvement .
since patients with liver dysfunction are feasible for the adverse event of mnz , physicians should pay attention to this possible neurological side effect .

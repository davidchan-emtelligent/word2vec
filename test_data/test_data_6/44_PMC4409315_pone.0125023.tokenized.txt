background protein - energy malnutrition ( pem ) can lead to growth hormone ( gh ) resistance .
leucine supplementation diets have been shown to increase protein synthesis in muscles .
our study aimed at investigating if long - term leucine supplementation could modulate gh - insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) - 1 system function and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) - related signal transduction in skeletal muscles in a rat model of severe malnutrition .
methodology / principal findings male sprague - dawley rats ( n = 50 ; weight , 302 +/ - 5 g ) were divided into 5 treatment groups , including 2 control groups ( a normal control group that was fed chow and ad libitum water [ con , n = 10 ] and a malnourished control group [ mc , n = 10 ] that was fed a 50 % chow diet ) .
after undergoing a weight loss stage for 4 weeks , rats received either the chow diet ( mc - con , n = 10 ) , the chow diet supplemented with low - dose leucine ( mc - l , n = 10 ) , or the chow diet supplemented with high - dose leucine ( mc - h , n = 10 ) for 2 weeks .
the muscle masses of the gastrocnemius , soleus , and extensor digitorum longus were significantly reduced in the mc group .
re - feeding increased muscle mass , especially in the mc - l and mc - h groups .
in the mc group , serum igf - 1 , igf - binding protein ( igfbp ) - 3 , and hepatic growth hormone receptor ( ghr ) levels were significantly decreased and phosphorylation of the downstream anabolic signaling effectors protein kinase b ( akt ) , mtor , and ribosomal protein s6 kinase 1 ( s6k1 ) were significantly lower than in other groups .
however , serum igf - 1 and igf binding protein ( igfbp ) - 3 concentrations and hepatic growth hormone receptor ( ghr ) levels were significantly higher in the mc - l and mc - h groups than in the mc - con group , and serum igfbp - 1 levels was significantly reduced in the mc - l and mc - h groups .
these changes were consistent with those observed for hepatic mrna expression levels .
phosphorylation of the downstream anabolic signaling effectors akt , mtor , and s6k1 were also significantly higher in the mc - l and mc - h groups than in the mc - con group .
conclusion / significance our data are the first to demonstrate that long - term supplementation with leucine improved acquired growth hormone resistance in rats with protein - energy malnutrition .
leucine might promote skeletal muscle protein synthesis by regulating downstream anabolic signaling transduction .

introduction protein - energy malnutrition ( pem ) has long been recognized as a common problem among children in developing countries , hospitalized ( and especially elderly hospitalized ) patients , and cancer patients [ 1 - 3 ] .
several reports have shown that pem results in an impaired response to therapeutic planning [ 4 ] , inefficient and delayed wound healing , increased wound bursting strength related to sutures , immune system dysfunction [ 5,6 ] , increased frequency of infectious and noninfectious complications [ 7 ] , prolonged hospitalization duration , and increased mortality rates [ 8,9 ] .
in patients with severe protein restriction ( kwashiorkor ) or protein - energy deprivation , growth retardation is associated with low serum insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) - 1 levels despite elevated or normal serum growth hormone ( gh ) concentrations [ 10 ] .
igf - 1 is a member of the insulin super - family [ 11 ] .
it was originally discovered as a mediator of gh action on somatic cell growth but it has also been shown to be an important regulator of cell metabolism , differentiation , and survival .
igf - 1 is mainly synthesized in the liver .
it is found in blood and other body fluids as a complex with specific high - affinity igf - binding proteins ( igfbp - 1 to igfbp - 6 ) [ 12,13 ] .
nutritional status is a key regulator of circulating and tissue - bound igf - 1 [ 14 ] .
protein and energy content of the diet influences plasma igf - 1 concentrations [ 15 ] , and igf - 1 levels are reduced during conditions of energy restriction such as short - term fasting [ 16 ] and malnutrition [ 17 ] .
furthermore , it was shown that igf - 1 promotes protein synthesis within the body [ 18 ] .
igf - 1 synthesis is a well - regulated process that depends on the availability of energy and amino acids .
leucine activates the phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) anabolic pathway , which in turn triggers a cascade of intracellular signals that culminate in the activation of protein translation .
our previous study found that leucine - enriched high - protein enteral nutrition could promote igf - 1 system synthesis in a rat model of trauma - hemorrhagic shock [ 19 ] .
although some studies have demonstrated that intravenous infusion or ingestion of leucine can acutely increase the protein synthesis rate [ 20,21 ] , only few studies have tested whether long - term supplementation with leucine promotes significant changes in the gh - igf - 1 system during severe malnutrition .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to investigate if long - term dietary supplementation with different doses of leucine could regulate gh - igf - 1 system function and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) - related signal transduction in skeletal muscles in a rat model of severe malnutrition .
materials and methods animals male sprague - dawley rats with an initial weight of 302 +/ - 5 g were provided by the medical experiment animal center of the jinling hospital , nanjing , china .
animals were housed in individual cages in a climatized environment at 23 +/ - 2degreesc and a relative air humidity of 55 +/ - 10 % under a 12 - h light / 12 - h dark cycle ( lights were on from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ) for 8 weeks .
animals had free access to water throughout the experiment .
all animal experiment protocols and procedures were approved by the animal care and use committee of the jinling hospital ( no201346 ) and complied with the principles of laboratory animal care ( nih publication no. 86 - 23 , revised 1985 ) .
diet and study design the chow diet was prepared according to the 1993 recommendations of the american institute of nutrition for adult rats ( ain - 93m ) .
initially , animals were fed the ain - 93m diet ad libitum for 2 weeks to let them adapt to the new environmental conditions and to determine their food intake .
the rats' mean food intake was used to determine the amount of chow offered daily during the food restriction phase .
animals were randomized into 5 groups : the control group ( con , n = 10 ) receiving a chow diet for 6 weeks and ad libitum water , the malnourished control group ( mc , n = 10 ) subjected to 50 % food restriction for 4 weeks , the mc - con group ( subjected to 50 % food restriction for 4 weeks , followed by 2 weeks of receiving a chow diet , n = 10 ) , the mc - l group ( subjected to 50 % food restriction for 4 weeks , followed by 2 weeks of receiving a chow diet supplemented with low - dose leucine [ 0 .
675 g leucine / kg of body weight ] by oral gavage , n = 10 ) , and the mc - h group ( subjected to 50 % food restriction for 4 weeks , followed by 2 weeks of receiving a chow diet supplemented with high - dose leucine [ 1.35 g leucine / kg of body weight ] by oral gavage , n = 10 ).( see s1 fig ) sample collection all animals were sacrificed by anesthesia with ketamine ( 100 mg / kg , i.p. ) , and blood ( about 3 ml ) was immediately collected in a dry tube .
blood samples were allowed to clot for 2 h at room temperature and were then centrifuged for 20 min at 2,000 x g. serum was removed , and the samples were stored at - 80degreesc until further analysis .
after blood collection , a part of the liver and the entire gastrocnemius , soleus , and extensor digitorum longus muscles were collected , weighed , wrapped , and immersed in liquid nitrogen .

however , no statistically significant difference in ghr levels was observed among the mc - l , mc - h , and con groups .
discussion in our study , the significantly reduced skeletal muscle masses caused by malnutrition were increased during re - feeding , especially in rats receiving leucine supplementation .
moreover , serum igf - 1 , igfbp - 3 , and hepatic ghr levels were significantly higher in the mc - l and mc - h groups compared to the mc - con group at the study end point .
we also showed that phosphorylation levels of the signaling effectors akt , mtor , and s6k1 were significantly higher in the mc - l and mc - h groups .
our data thus indicate that long - term leucine supplementation improved acquired growth hormone resistance in rats with pem .
pem is classified as slight ( 10 - 25 %) , moderate ( 25 - 39 %) , or severe (> 40 %) based on the amount of weight loss [ 22 ] .
our study used a 50 % food restriction , resulting in severe malnutrition in our animal model .
after 4 weeks , the mc animals lost 40 % of their body weight , which equals severe malnutrition , indicating that our experimental model was successfully established .
low igf - 1 levels were associated with increased serum gh levels in the mc group .
similar data have been previously reported by others [ 23,24 ] .
patients suffering from malnutrition with gh hypersecretion and low igf - 1 levels are considered gh - resistant .
this hormonal pattern is characteristic of a catabolic state [ 25 ] .
our study revealed that leucine supplementation resulted in the rapid recovery of the igf - 1 system in rats with severe malnutrition .
we also observed muscle mass maintenance , downstream mtor pathway activation , and ghr synthesis , indicating effective stimulation of muscle and liver protein synthesis .
these results provide valuable insight into how long - term supplementation with only leucine can improve gh resistance in patients with malnutrition .
our study clearly demonstrated that serum igf - 1 and igfbp - 3 levels were dramatically lower in rats with malnutrition .
the plasma concentration of igf - 1 , which is primarily determined by hepatic synthesis and secretion of the peptide hormone , is also dramatically decreased during protein and energy restriction diets .
numerous clinical and animal experiments have shown that pem not only decreases the synthesis rate of igf - 1 but also enhances its serum clearance and degradation [ 10 ] .
igfbp - 3 binds the majority of circulating igfs together with an acid labile protein subunit ( als ) and forms a stable ternary complex that prolongs igf half - life , functions as a reservoir for igfs , and limits their extravascular transit .
reduced hepatic igf - 1 and igfbp - 3 mrna expression and serum protein levels observed in the rats with malnutrition in our study confirm the findings of previous studies [ 10,26 ] .
our study indicated that food deprivation resulted in significantly increased hepatic igfbp - 1 mrna and serum protein levels .
a number of studies have examined the effects of caloric and / or protein restriction on igf bioactivity .
jackson smith and colleagues showed that energy restriction decreased igfbp - 3 levels in children but not adults , and that protein restriction decreased igfbp - 3 levels in adults only [ 27 ] .
in an animal study , oster et al. noted a significant decrease in igfbp - 3 levels only in rats with a caloric intake that was restricted to 40 % of that of controls or those that experienced severe protein restriction [ 28 ] .
data from a northern hybridization analysis showed that igfbp - 3 mrna levels declined by 30 % in rats with protein restriction , and that serum igfbp - 3 levels paralleled this decrease , suggesting transcriptional regulation [ 29 ] .
in another study by jackson smith et al. , a rapid increase in igfbp - 1 levels was observed in calorically restricted adults .
this increase was reversed with re - feeding [ 27 ] .
this clinical finding contrasts data from a study by straus et al. who demonstrated that prolonged protein restriction in a rat model caused a greater induction of igfbp - 1 gene expression than did short - term fasting [ 30 ] .
these authors also demonstrated that amino acid restriction increased the abundance of igfbp - 1 mrna in rat hepatoma cells , stressing the importance of both insulin and protein substrate in the regulation of igfbp - 1 .
these findings suggest that igfbp - 1 may function to decrease igf bioactivity during low nutritional substrate availability .
previous studies using leucine - enriched formula or leucine alone to investigate the stimulatory effect of these compounds on skeletal muscle protein synthesis did not demonstrate changes in serum igf - 1 and igfbp levels .
meanwhile , acute dosing of leucine solution alone during inadequate nutrient availability is not sufficient for stimulation of igf - 1 production .
our study indicates that re - feeding with a leucine supplementation diet ( in the mc - l and mc - h groups ) resulted in significantly higher serum igf - 1 and igfbp - 3 levels than those found in mc - con rats ( that did not receive leucine ) .
this is a desirable outcome , since igf - 1 plays an important role in gh resistance during malnutrition .
we also found that igf - 1 and igfbp - 3 mrna levels significantly increased in the mc - l and mc - h groups .
previous studies have found that re - feeding with a diet consisting of essential amino acids ( e.g. , leucine ) resulted in a larger increase in serum igf - 1 levels than re - feeding with non - essential amino acids , further supporting our findings [ 31 ] .
our data show that hepatic ghr and ghr mrna levels were clearly lower in the mc group than in the con group , providing one explanation for decreased serum and hepatic igf - 1 mrna levels .
straus and takemoto showed that ghr mrna abundance in the liver declined during fasting and responded to re - feeding [ 32 ] .
in our study , hepatic ghr and ghr mrna levels after re - feeding were significantly higher in the mc - l and mc - h groups than the mc group , but not significantly different to the con group .
the pi3k - akt pathway , which acts upstream of mtor , can be phosphorylated by the ligand igf - 1 , which in turn stimulates mtor phosphorylation to induce liver protein synthesis .
previous studies demonstrated the rapid development of gh resistance along with a decrease in ghr during malnutrition [ 26 ] .
therefore , the diminished signal transduction associated with the pi3k - akt pathway may be partially responsible for gh resistance during severe malnutrition .
our study indicates that leucine plays an important role in gh resistance in rats with severe malnutrition .
after re - feeding with the chow diet for 2 weeks , we found that rats with severe malnutrition recovered weight up to levels that were close to those of the con group .
in addition , our results show that leucine supplementation caused significant improvement in some indicators of protein nutritional status , as observed by the increase in skeletal muscle protein masses .
it was not surprising to us that the wet weight of skeletal muscle proteins in the mc - l and mc - h groups did not exhibit a difference to those of the control group , since some studies provided evidence indicating that an increase in leucine intake may help protein loss [ 21,33 ] .
we also showed that leucine supplementation significantly enhanced the activation of the mtor signaling pathway .
phosphorylation of mtor and its downstream effector s6k1 in rats receiving leucine significantly increased compared with rats receiving the chow diet .
recently , a large body of evidence has established that amino acids , especially leucine , can be considered as signaling molecules stimulating protein translation through an akt - independent pathway .
acute leucine ingestion can effectively increase protein synthesis and promote mtor - related signal transduction [ 21,33 ] .
previous studies demonstrated that igf - 1 administration effectively attenuates the inhibition of protein synthesis during malnutrition and ameliorates the loss of muscle mass .
therefore , in addition to the nutrient - dependent mechanism described above , the increased mtor anabolic signaling in the rats receiving the leucine supplementation diet in our study may have been partially caused by the activation of the igf - 1 signaling pathway .
in conclusion , oral administration of leucine improved gh resistance in rats with malnutrition by promoting igf - 1 , reducing igf - 1 degradation , and facilitating ghr synthesis in the liver .
leucine might activate muscle protein synthesis by regulating mtor anabolic signaling transduction .

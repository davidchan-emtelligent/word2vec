25 - 29 august 200211th international symposium on the cells of the hepatic sinusoid and their relation to other cellstucson , arizona , usa introduction we previously reported that when the high - functioning human hepatoma cell line , flc - 5 , immortalized sinusoidal endothelial cell line , m1 , and immortalized hepatic stellate cell line , a7 , were cultured in the 3 - dimensional filled type bioreactor , tissue reorganization resembling that seen in the live liver occurred , with the appearance of pores in the sinusoidal endothelial cells ( secs ) [ 1 ] .
the process and mechanism of formation of these pores remain unclarified .
the presence of actin at the margin of these pores has been demonstrated by electron microscopic study [ 2 ] .
swinholide - a , which is actin inhibitor synthesized from okinawa sponge , increase the number of pores on primary culture on secs derived from the rat [ 3 ] .
in present study , we examine whether or not the pores on secs under three - dimensional perfusion co - culture treatment with swinholide - a behave like those in primary culture cells .
methods 2 - 107 flc - 5 cells were inoculated into the reservoir , and they were perfused slowly in bioreactor for 2 hours in closing circuit to induce the cells to adhere to the porous cellulose beads ( asahi kasei co. , ltd. ) that served as the carrier .
five days later , 2 - 107 a7 cells were added in a similar manner , followed another 5 days later by the addition of the m1 cells .
after perfusion for 1 hour with medium supplemented with 100 nm swinholide - a , or for 2 hours with the medium supplemented with 200 nm swinholide - a , the cellulose beads along with the adherent cells were withdrawn from bioreactor .
for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , cultured cells ware fixed 1.2 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ( pb ) , ph7.4 and postfixed with 1 % oso4 in 0.1 m pb. the fixed cells were rinsed twice with pbs , subsequently dehydrated in ascending concentration of ethanol , critical point - dried using carbon dioxide and coated by vacuum evaporated carbon and ion - spattered gold .
specimens were observed by jsm - 35 ( jeol , tokyo ) at an accelerated voltage of 10 kv. for transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , cultured cells were fixed with 2.0 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m pb and postfixed with 1 % oso4 in 0.1 m pb. specimens were dehydrated in ethanol , and embedded in mixture of epon - araldite .
thin sections were made with a diamond knife mounted on a lkb ultratome , and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate .
specimens were examined with a jeol 1200ex electron microscopy .
results when m1 cells were incubated in plastic dish or independently in radial - flow bioreactor filled with glass beads [ 4 ] , no pores were observed .
however , pits with a diameter of nanometers were visible in both cases .
flc5 , a7 , and m1 were co - cultured in radial - flow bioreactors , and m1 cells grew to cover the entire surface of the perfused side of culture medium .
under sem , the cells treated with swinholide - a ( 100 nm ) for 1 hour showed an increased number of pores of 100 - nm diameter and with 200 nm for 2 hour had an even larger number of pores and some of them had a large number of the larger pits about 1 micrometer and depressions ( fig. 1 ) .
figure 1 scanning electron microscopy views of m1 cell .
large pores can be observed on surface of m1 cell .
small pores are noted in the large pores .
small pores were abundant in the depressed area .
under tem , vacuoles , coincident with vesiculo - vacuolar organelles ( vvos ) about 200 nm in size , were noted .
junctional complex were observed between m1 and a7 , m1 and m1 .
invaginations of plasma membrane like caveola can be observed ( fig. 2a ) .
we could also observe that caveola was fused and made the interconnected labyrinth - like structure ( fig. 2b ) .
figure 2 transmission electron microscopic of m1 cell .
a : invagination of plasma membrane like caveolae ( arrow ) and fenestrae like pores can be observed .
b : the pores are fused and interconnected labyrinth - like structure .
discussion the number of pores on m1 cells in co - culture using rfb was increased by the effect of actin inhibitor .
it is possible that the mechanism of formation of pores can be investigated by using rfb with actin inhibitor .
several authors reported that share stress alternated the cellular cytoskeleton such as actin .
nevertheless , we could not observe the fenestrae on m1 cells that was monocultured by rfb [ 4 ] .
it is suggested that both of share stress and cell - to - cell interaction are important factors of reappearance of fenestrae in immortalized endothelial cell .
the 3 - dimensional perfusion co - culture using rfb is useful for reconstruction of liver tissue in vitro and increasing responsibility of drug .

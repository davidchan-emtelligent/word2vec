background heartworm ( dirofilaria immitis ) in dogs is considered endemic in australia , but the clinical heartworm disease caused by the heartworm is rare and prevalence is low .
the mainstream prevention of the heartworm is based on macrocyclic lactone ( ml ) administration .
the aim of this study was to confirm endemism of the heartworm under current australian conditions using a cohort of recent microfilaria - positive dogs which were on variable heartworm prevention .
methods a hotspot of canine heartworm antigen - positive and microfilaria - positive dogs has been detected recently in queensland , australia .
blood samples from 39 dogs from queensland and two dogs from new south wales were investigated for canine filarioids .
rapid antigen diagnostic tests capable of detection of d. immitis and real - time pcr for quantification and differentiation between d. immitis from acanthocheilonema reconditum with quantification of microfilariae in canine blood samples , together with d. immitis specific real - time pcr assay , were applied to microfilaria - positive dogs .
the p - glycoprotein genotype was determined to test whether australian - sourced heartworm shared the same genetic markers as those suspected of ml - resistance in north america .
results only d. immitis was detected in the samples from queensland and new south wales , australia .
using high resolution melt real - time pcr and d. immitis specific real - time pcr , the calculated microfilaria concentration ranged from 1 to 44,957 microfilariae / ml and from 7 to 60,526 microfilariae / ml , respectively .
dna sequencing of the pcr products confirmed d. immitis .
fifteen of the examined dogs were on putative , rigorous ml prevention .
for the remaining dogs , compliance with heartworm prevention was unknown or reported as inconsistent .
wild - type genotype aa - gg of the p - glycoprotein locus of d. immitis sequence has been obtained for three blood samples .
due to the incomplete history , any suggestion of a loss of efficacy of mls must be treated as ' remotely possible ' .
in the immediate future , records of preventative administration and annual antigen testing would be required to determine any problems with the efficacy of preventatives .
conclusions the prevalence of canine heartworm in australia remains poorly understood .
it is generally assumed to be low by veterinary practitioners .
the localised increase in the study area confirms endemism of canine heartworm and a requirement for ongoing vigilance through annual heartworm testing to better understand the changing distribution of canine heartworm , client compliance , as well as to detect any change in ml - susceptibility .

transmitted from host - to - host via mosquito bites , infection largely affects the cardiopulmonary system resulting in severe and potentially fatal disease .
the disease is well - established , mostly affecting temperate , tropical and subtropical areas of north , central and south america , southern europe , as well as australia [ 1 - 7 ] .
the prevalence of the disease is influenced by climate and topography , but most importantly , by the presence of mosquito vectors - ubiquitous culex spp. , aedes spp. and anopheles spp .
[ 6 , 8 ] .
transmission occurs when mosquitoes ingest d. immitis microfilariae ( l1 ) as they circulate the blood of infected animals .
in the mosquito , the microfilariae moult before migrating to the proboscis as d. immitis infective third - stage larvae ( l3 ) [ 9 ] .
these larvae ( l3 ) are transferred to hosts during blood meals , where migrate throughout the blood and body towards the pulmonary arteries and reach sexual maturity in large blood vessels [ 10 ] .
the microfilariae are first seen in 6 - 7 month after the initial infection and the life span of adult female ( 230 - 310 mm in length ) and male ( 120 - 190 mm in length ) heartworms is 5 - 10 years [ 8 - 10 ] .
the principal prevention for heartworm in dogs is based on monthly oral or topical administration of macrocyclic lactones ( ml ) or yearly injections of moxidectin microspheres ( also ml ) .
canine heartworm is considered endemic in australia , with the principal mosquito vectors being aedes notoscriptus and culex annilirostris in southeast australia [ 11 ]. between 1970 and 1990 , there was a reported increase in heartworm prevalence from 5 % to a peak of 30 % in new south wales [ 12 - 14 ] .
heartworm was consistently found across all states and territories with highest rates of prevalence found in queensland ( 36 %) and northern territory ( 90 - 100 %) [ 1 , 15 - 18 ] .
current prevalence is low even in sentinel populations such as aboriginal community dogs [ 19 ] .
australian dingos / wild dogs potentially represent a reservoir in northern queensland based on recent small scale survey [ 20 ] .
a recent 2011 heartworm antigen survey found only 2 ( 0.3 %) heartworm - positive dogs out of 783 pound dogs from new south wales , queensland and south australia with no known history of prophylaxis ( sarah cooper , australian veterinary association annual conference , 20 - 25 may 2012 , canberra ) .
based on the above surveys , australia should be considered a region of low prevalence for heartworm in dogs .
since 2005 , a lack of efficacy of mls to prevent heartworm infection has been reported in the usa , suggesting the possibility that heartworm is developing resistance to ml - preventatives [ 21 ] .
studies since have been focused on identification of potential molecular changes that could be associated with ml lack of efficacy [ 22 - 25 ] .
comparisons of ml - resistant and susceptible d. immitis have identified possible single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) such as the gg - gg genotype in the p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) with ivermectin - resistance [ 22 , 23 , 26 ] .
more recently , whole genome scans discovered over 150 markers potentially associated with ml - resistance [ 27 ] .
however , further research is required to validate these genetic markers and their utility for diagnostic screening [ 7 ] .
at present , no genetic test is available to differentiate ml - susceptible from ml - resistant field specimens .
compared to usa , lack of efficacy of mls to prevent canine heartworm has not been reported in australia .
the aim of this study was to confirm endemicity of the canine heartworm under current australian conditions using a cohort of recent heartworm - positive dog material which were on variable heartworm prevention .
rapid diagnostic tests capable of detection , differentiation and quantification of microfilaria and species specific real - time pcr assays were applied to blood or microfilaria from positive dogs .
the p - gp genotype was determined to ascertain whether these australian heartworms shared the same genotype as suspected ml - resistant heartworm in north america .
methods samples samples tested included two cohorts .
the first cohort , samples ( fvs - cn , n = 39 ) were from those that tested positive using in clinic antigen tests .
the second cohort , samples ( fvs - hw , n = 2 ) were from recent clinical cases currently treated for canine heartworm at the faculty of veterinary science , university of sydney .
blood samples fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 were collected in april to june , 2015 , from dogs in queensland , australia ( table 1 ) .
dogs were located in the mackay region ( fvs - cn # 1 , fvs - cn # 3 to fvs - cn # 34 , fvs - cn # 36 to fvs - cn # 39 ) , cairns ( fvs - cn # 2 ) and toowoomba ( fvs - cn # 35 ) ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
all samples initially tested positive using an in - clinic witness dirofilaria ( r ) ( zoetis , australia ) , a rapid immuno - migration ( rim ( r )) assay for detection of adult female d. immitis ( heartworm ) antigen in dogs positive by veterinary practitioners .
to confirm the result , we performed dirochek ( r ) ( zoetis , australia via vetpath laboratory services , western australia ) an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) for the detection of adult d. immitis antigen and knott 's test ( vetpath laboratory services , western australia ) .
for each dog only locality , the age , presence of suspected heartworm associated clinical signs and history of heartworm prevention were available .
heartworm prevention compliance was reported as ' rigorous' if the client indicated year round administration with appropriate product ( no actual evidence of purchase and administration was provided ) , ' inconsistent ' if heartworm preventions were missed or intermittently administrated or incorrect dose administered , and ' unknown ' if such information was not available or was unknown .
anonymous refrigerated blood samples fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 were processed at the faculty of veterinary sciences , university of sydney for this study ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .

both dogs were previously domiciled in queensland , australia .
for both fvs - hw # 1 ( 1,300 microfilariae / ml ) and fvs - hw # 2 ( 14 microfilariae / ml ) the microfilaria concentration was evaluated using microcapillary test .
briefly , the buffy coat was observed for the presence of microfilaria under the microscope in microhematocrit tubes after centrifugation of edta blood .
fvs - hw # 1 positivity was also assessed with modified knott 's test .
dog fvs - hw # 1 was referred to uvths for heartworm disease prior to treatment , blood was collected and tested positive using anigen rapid canine heartworm ( chw ) ag 2.0 test kit ( bionote ; life bioscience , oakleigh , australia ) a chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of canine d. immitis antigen ; the dog stayed in mackay , queensland prior to arriving in sydney , new south wales .
dog fvs - hw # 2 was undergoing heartworm treatment with melarsomine ( immiticide ( r ) , merial ) , and blood was collected prior to second treatment , at the time blood of fvs - hw # 2 was negative using anigen rapid canine heartworm ( chw ) ag 2.0 test kit ; the dog was from brisbane , queensland but it was rehomed from elsewhere ( unknown source ) in queensland .
for both fvs - hw # 1 and fvs - hw # 2 , heartworm prevention was intermittent .
in addition , canine dna isolated from a dog domiciled in nadi , fiji ( fiji - hw # 1 ) from 2009 was included in the study as initial positive control .
isolation and confirmation of canine blood dna blood samples ( edta , 70 - 200 mul ) from fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 were kept frozen for 8 - 10 months at - 20 degreesc and refrigerated blood ( 200 mul ) from fvs - hw # 1 and fvs - hw # 2 was used for dna isolation .
the genomic dna from samples fvs - cn # 7 to fvs - cn # 39 , fvs - hw # 1 and fvs - hw # 2 was isolated using a combination of mobio powermag ( r ) blood isolation kit ( lysis ) and powermag ( r ) microbiome rna / dna isolation kit ( magnetic separation ) ( mo - bio laboratories ; geneworks , thebarton , australia ) optimised for kingfisher ( r ) duo ( thermo - fisher scientific , scoresby , australia ) .
isolation was processed in batches of 11 blood samples and an extraction blank .
initial lysis was according to the blood kit isolation part with modification to the step of white blood cell ( wbc ) lysis ( 650 mul of the red blood cell lysate and 450 mul of powermag ( r ) wbc lysis solution ) .
dna isolation was processed with 700 mul of the wbc supernatant in the kingfisher ( r ) microtiter deep well 96 plate as suggested by the microbiome kit protocol .
samples were eluted in 70 mul of clearmag ( r ) rnase - free water .
genomic dna from samples fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 6 was isolated using isolate ii blood dna kit ( bioline , australia ) and eluted in 100 mul tris buffer ( ph = 8 ) as per the manufacturer 's protocol .
dna concentrations were determined by the nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer ( thermo - fisher scientific , scoresby , australia ) .
dna was stored in aliquots at - 20 degreesc until further use .
buffy coat with 1 - 2 microfilaria from fvs - hw # 2 was collected using a tuberculin syringe and needle from the micro - haematocrit tube after centrifugation .
dna was isolated using the mobio kits on kingfisher as described above .
to verify presence of dog dna , we utilised a real - time pcr to amplify partial ( 276 bp ) canine beta - actin , primers ( s0588 ) actin f2 : 5 ' - acc act ggt att gtc atg gac tct g - 3 ' and ( s0589 ) actin r2 : 5 ' - gct ctt ctc cag gga gga cga - 3 ' [ 28 ] .
the pcr cycling conditions included initial step at 95 degreesc for 3 min followed by 40 two - step cycles at 95 degreesc for 5 s and 60 degreesc for 15 s. the real - time pcr reaction mixture ( 20 mul ) included 10 mul of sensifast sybr no - rox kit ( bioline , eveleigh , australia ) , each primer at 400 nm concentrations , pcr - grade water , and 2 mul of dna template .
the real - time pcr was carried out on a cfx96 touch ( tm ) real - time pcr detection system with the corresponding cfx manager v.3.1 software ( biorad , gladesville , australia ) .
the arbitrary real - time pcr threshold was determined automatically using default settings and ct - values reported .
arthropod - borne filarioids real - time pcr a high - resolution melt ( hrm ) , real - time pcr assay was performed using primers designed by wongkamchai et al .
[ 29 ] for the detection of dirofilaria immitis , brugia malayi and b. pahangi in blood samples .
primers ( s0579 ) ( f : 5 ' - ttt aaa ccg aaa aaa tat tga ctg ac - 3 ') and ( s0580 ) ( r : 5 ' - aaa aac taa aca atc ata cat gtg cc - 3 ') target approximately 110 - 120 bp long partial sequence of the filarioid mitochondrial 12s rrna gene .
the assay is capable of amplifying potentially all filarial nematode species [ 29 , 30 ] .
the real - time pcr reaction mixture ( 20 mul ) included 10 mul of sensifast hrm mix ( bioline ) , each primer at 400 nm concentrations , 4.4 mul of pcr - grade water , and 4 mul of dna template .
positive control plasmids with dna for d. immitis and acanthocheilonema reconditum 12s rrna gene were synthetised by geneart ( thermo - fisher scientific , scoresby , australia ) .
to optimize conditions with sensifast hrm mix ( bioline , australia ) , real - time pcr efficiency was evaluated across thermal gradient from 59 degreesc to 62 degreesc against ten - fold serial dilutions ( ranging from 1.96 x 105 to 1.96 x 100 copies per reaction ) of a known concentration of plasmid dna containing the d. immitis 12s rrna gene analysed in triplicate .
the reaction conditions were set with an initial polymerase activation step at 95 degreesc for 3 min followed by 40 two - step cycles at 95 degreesc for 5 s and 59 degreesc to 62 degreesc for 15 s. the hrm cycle was set between 60 degreesc and 90 degreesc , with increments at 0.2 degreesc intervals .
the real - time pcr was carried out on a cfx96 touch ( tm ) real - time pcr detection system with the corresponding cfx manager v .
3.1 software ( biorad , australia ) .
for each sample cfx manager v .
3.1 reported ct - values and copy numbers based on standard curve of the positive control .
the arbitrary real - time pcr threshold was set to a single threshold at 100 rfu .
to plot a normalised curve of decreasing fluorescence with increasing temperature the precision melt software v .
1.2 ( bio - rad , australia ) was used .
each run included at least one negative ( ntc , non - target control ) control .
the optimised filarial 12s rrna gene real time pcr was run as above with annealing temperature set to 62 degreesc with reaction efficiency ( 90 - 110 %) and the limit of detection determined to be greater or equals to 196 gene copies of 12s rrna gene per reaction .
the optimised real - time pcr was used to quantify microfilaria concentrations in blood samples and sample fvs - hw # 2 ( 1,300 microfilariae / ml ) used to calibrate conversion to microfilaria for each sample ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
each real - time pcr run included duplicate serial dilutions of plasmid dna ( d. immitis , a. reconditum plasmids ) .
all dna samples were run once .
if no or > 35 ct - values ( negative samples and late amplifiers , respectively ) were returned , the reactions were re - run .
all samples with < 35 ct - values were sent for dna purification and subsequent dna sequencing with amplification primers at macrogen inc .
( seoul , korea ) .
to generate normalised melting curves and difference melting curves , pre - ( 70 - 71 degreesc ) and post - ( 76 - 77 degreesc ) melt normalisation regions were set to define the main temperature boundaries of the normalised and difference plots .
the precision melt software v .
1.2 then assigned each sample to a cluster using default settings .
dirofilaria immitis specific real - time pcr a real - time pcr assay was performed for detection of d. immitis using primers designed by rishniw et al .
[ 28 ] and applied by rojas et al .
[ 30 ] .
primers ( s0582 ) ( f : 5 ' - agt gta gag ggt cag cct gag tta - 3 ') and ( s0583 ) ( r : 5 ' - aca ggc act gac aat acc aat - 3 ') specifically target a cox1 gene fragment (~ 203 bp ) for d. immitis .

first , a thermal gradient pcr assay from 59 degreesc to 62 degreesc was performed to determine optimum annealing temperatures for the pair of primers using sensifast sybr no - rox kit ( bioline , australia ) .
the reaction was run with triplicate ten - fold serial dilutions ( 1.96 x 102 to 1.96 x 107 copies per reaction ) of a known concentration of plasmid dna containing the d. immitis cox1 gene synthetised by geneart ( thermo fisher , australia ) and with negative ( no template ) controls .
amplification was performed as follows : initial denaturing step at 95 degreesc for 3 min , followed by 40 cycles of denaturing ( 5 s at 95 degreesc ) , annealing ( 15 s from 59 degreesc to 62 degreesc ) .
a final melting curve was produced by heating the product from 60 degreesc to 90 degreesc for 5 s at 0.5 degreesc increments .

characterisation of dirofilaria immitis p - glycoprotein locus sequence to obtain pcr amplicons of p - glycoprotein locus of d. immitis ( p - gp ) we initially used dna directly isolated from blood pcr .
to improve success of the p - gp amplification , we then used a whole genome amplification step of the dna isolated from blood .
whole genome amplification ( wga ) was carried out using the illustra genomiphi v2 dna amplification kit ( ge healthcare , parramatta , australia ) using 1 mul of gdna extracted from the canine blood .
for wga , we primarily focused on dna samples with reported rigorous compliance with heartworm preventatives ( table 1 ) .
amplification of the p - pg fragment was accomplished with primer pair , pgp1sens ( s0592 ) ( 5 ' - gga caa tta tcc ggt ggt ca - 3 ') and pgp1antisens ( s0593 ) ( 5 ' - tcg caa att tcc tcc cac tt - 3 ') [ 22 , 23 ] .
all pcr amplifications were carried out using mytaq ( tm ) red mix ( bioline , australia ) .
primers were added at a final concentration of 0.25 mum each .
a final reaction volume of 25 mul for the first pcr was run using the following cycling conditions : 95 degreesc for 15 s , 56 degreesc for 5 s , and 72 degreesc for 15 s for 35 cycles with 2 mul of the isolated dna or 2 mul of 1:50 dilution of the genomiphi amplified dna .
all reactions were initiated at 95 degreesc for 5 min and concluded with 72 degreesc for 5 min .
the pcrs were run in a veriti pcr cycler ( life sciences , australia ) alongside sterile pcr - grade water as negative control .
resulting products were resolved in 1.5 % ( w / v ) agarose gel .
the pcrs were run in a veriti pcr cycler ( life sciences , australia ) alongside sterile pcr - grade water as negative control .
resulting products were resolved in 1.5 % ( w / v ) agarose gel .
pcr products were directly sequenced using amplification primers at macrogen ltd .
( seoul , korea ) .

results patent microfilaraemic dogs in coastal queensland , australia all 39 dogs ( fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 ) were initially positive using an in - clinic witness dirofilaria ( r ) ( zoetis , australia ) test for presence of female d. immitis antigen .
a reference elisa dirochek ( r ) ( zoetis , australia ) confirmed presence of female d. immitis antigen in 95 % ( 37 / 39 , 2 false negative samples : fvs - cn # 13 and fvs - cn # 18 ) of dogs and microfilaria were demonstrated in all 39 samples using a modified knott 's test ( table 1 , fig. 1 ). fig. 1 canine heartworm dirofilaria immitis in australian dogs .
heartworm prevention compliance for 39 dogs was reported as ' rigorous' compliance if client indicated year round administration with appropriate product ( no actual evidence of purchase and administration was provided ) , ' inconsistent ' compliance if heartworm preventions were missed or intermittently administrated or incorrect monthly dose administered , and ' unknown ' if such information was not available or was unknown .
the active in prevention of dog heartworm is colour indicated ( a ) .
the age of dogs is colour indicated ( b ) in the dataset presented with microfilaria ( fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 ) , 41 % of dogs were apparently compliant with monthly heartworm prevention ( n = 15 ) ( fig. 1a ) .
for the remaining dogs compliance with heartworm prevention was unknown or reported as inconsistent ( table 1 ) .
most heartworm prevention was based on milbemycin oxime ( 67 % , n = 10 ) followed by ivermectin ( n = 2 ) , moxidectin ( n = 2 ) and selamectin ( n = 1 ) .
the average age of the dogs was 5 years 6 month ( min .

13 years ) ; seventeen dogs ( 43 %) were three years or less ( five on monthly milbemycin oxime , one on monthly moxidectin ) ( fig. 1b ) .
eight dogs were in the category of over six years and up to nine years ( two on monthly milbemycin oxime , and single dogs on moxidectin , selamectin and ivermectin ) ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
dna from fvs - cn # 1 to fvs - cn # 39 was successfully purified and canine beta - actin amplified ( ct values : 22.44 to 28.84 ) from 72 % ( 28 / 39 ) canine blood samples .
nine ( 23 % , 9 / 39 ) dna from blood samples amplified dna with higher ct - value (< 30 ) , and two ( 5 % , 2 / 29 ) dna samples ( fvs - cn # 1 and fvs - cn # 2 ) did not amplify canine beta - actin control gene ( table 1 ) .
fvs - hw # 1 , fvs - hw # 2 and fiji - hw # 2 returned adequate ct - values 25.88 , 29.76 and 25.31 in canine beta - actin assay , respectively .
all blank dna samples remained negative in the canine beta - actin assay .

the calculated microfilarial concentration ranged from 1 ( fvs - cn # 24 ) to 44,957 ( fvs - cn # 36 ) microfilariae / ml ( table 1 ) .
three distinct clusters were produced with the hrm analysis of 12s rrna gene assay performed on 35 positive samples that returned ct - values and positive control dirofilaria immitis and acanthocheilonema reconditum ( fig. 2 , additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
a single sample fvs - cn # 24 was excluded from hrm analysis , because of calculated low copy number ( 5 ) and non - reliable melt profile .
cluster 1 included d. immitis positive control ( high copy numbers ) and the majority of dog blood samples ( n = 30 ; 3 - 44,957 microfilariae / ml ) .
cluster 2 included d. immitis positive control ( low copy numbers ) and 4 dog blood samples ( fvs - cn # 10 , # 27 , # 31 , # 32 ; 15 - 177 microfilariae / ml ) .
the remaining dog sample fvs - cn # 3 clustered within cluster 3 of a. reconditum controls , but with a variable hrm profile due to late amplification ( ct - value = 36.29 ) ( fig. 2 ; additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
to confirm the species identification , 33 pcr products were submitted for dna sequencing .
only 17 / 33 ( 51 %) samples yielded dna sequencing data denoting d. immitis and a. reconditum .
all dna sequence data were identical to d. immitis 12s rrna gene reference sequence ( fn391554 ) , including the suspected sample fvs - cn # 3 that clustered within cluster 3 of a. reconditum controls ( table 1 , additional file 1 : table s1 ). fig. 2 hrm real - time qpcr analysis for the identification of arthropod - borne filarioids in australia dogs .

single dog sample was assigned to a. reconditum ( light green ; note the ambiguous melting profile in differential melting graph b ) , however dna sequencing matched d. immitis 12s rrna gene reference sequence ( fn391554 ) presence of dirofilaria immitis using diagnostic real - time pcr and dna sequencing in total 36 fvs - cn samples ( 36 / 39 ) were considered d. immitis - positive returning < 37 ct - value ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
the calculated microfilarial concentration ranged from 7 ( fvs - cn # 1 ) to 60,526 ( fvs - cn # 11 ) microfilariae / ml ( table 1 ) .
one sample ( fvs - cn # 14 ) was considered suspect for d. immitis with ct - value of 39.93 ( 0.035 microfilariae / ml ) ; a repeated run yielded no ct - value .
all positive ( n = 36 ) samples yielded dna sequences matching d. immitis cox1 gene ( table 1 , additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
all but sample fvs - cn # 29 had dna sequences 100 % identical with d. immitis cox1 gene reference sequence ( nc _ 005305 ) .
fvs - cn # 29 included unambiguous aat > agt ( asn > ser ) single nucleotide non - synonymous polymorphism at position 539 according to the reference gene .
fvs - hw # 1 , fvs - hw # 1 and fvs - fiji # 1 returned positive result of d. immitis ( ct - values : 25.76 , 29.82 and 35.47 , respectively ) , dna sequences were 100 % identical with d. immitis cox1 gene reference sequence ( nc _ 005305 ) .
wildtype form of dirofilaria immitis p - glycoprotein locus in australia wild - type genotype aa - gg of the p - glycoprotein locus of d. immitis ( p - gp ) sequence has been obtained for three blood samples ( rigorous prevention group : fvs - cn # 11 , fvs - cn # 34 and inconsistent prevention group : fvs - cn # 37 ) .
other samples did not yield sufficient p - gp pcr product for dna sequencing .
whole genome amplification prior pcr amplification using p - gp primers yielded dna sequence with top blast hits from the dog genome .
discussion it is important for the control of canine heartworm that preventatives remain efficacious , and compliance with treatments and heartworm antigen testing is practised .
in this study , a large proportion of the dogs with microfilariaemia were reportedly on rigorous monthly heartworm prevention with either milbemycin oxime , ivermectin or selamectin .
all monthly heartworm preventatives undergo rigorous experimental testing prior to their registration [ 31 ] .
it is expected that such preventatives are demonstrated to have 100 % efficacy [ 31 ] .
two important caveats need to be taken into account when considering rational prevention and compliance : ( i ) residual activity and ( ii ) age of d. immitis present in the dog .
for ( i ) , the residual activity of milbemycin oxime , ivermectin or selamectin lasts only several days , therefore it is expected that monthly doses remove all larval stages that accumulated over the past 30 days , implying that all d. immitis need to be less than 30 days old .
subsequently , the efficacy for d. immitis , of the various mls depends on the age of the parasite ( ii ) .
the efficacy is 100 % for 30 day - old d. immitis based on registration for products with milbemycin oxime , ivermectin or selamectin .
a single dose of ivermectin or selamectin applied 60 days after the infestation remains 100 % efficacious but decreases to 95 % for milbemycin oxime ( see table 1 in [ 32 , 33 ]) .
in other words , compliance with monthly administration has to be strict with milbemycin oxime , because comparative studies have shown that milbemycin oxime is not as effective for >= 30 day - old d. immitis in dogs when compared with ivermectin [ 8 , 33 , 34 ] .
therefore , if a monthly treatment with milbemycin is missed , a small proportion of d. immitis may be able to develop to adults and produce microfilaria .
an incomplete compliance is a real possibility in our cohort , because a large portion of d. immitis - positive dogs was on milbemycin oxime .
inadvertently missing three consecutive monthly doses means potentially four month - old d. immitis exist before the next 12 doses are applied ; in such circumstances , mccall et al .
[ 34 ] demonstrated only 41 % efficacy of milbemycin oxime against d. immitis .
alternatively , it can be a reflection of larger market share of products with milbemycin oxime for heartworm prevention over other mls in the locality .
to document any loss of efficacy to mls , a full history of prevention and annual antigen test would be required [ 35 ] .
therefore , a reduced efficacy of mls in these australian cases must be treated as ' remotely possible ' due to incomplete information [ 21 ] .
the putative ' rigorous' canine heartworm prevention should have halted development of d. immitis adults and abrogated any microfilariaemia .
loss of efficacy for milbemycin oxime , ivermectin or selamectin would be a major concern for veterinarians , pet owners and suppliers in australia .
the current study documents the presence of a focus of heartworm prevalence , but much more complete histories and testing regimes are needed to indicate whether resistance is present or developing in the region .
in future suspected cases in australia , a ' microfilaria suppression test ' should be considered [ 23 ] .
for example a microfilaricide , either ivermectin ( 50 - 200 mg / kg ) or milbemycin oxime ( 500 - 1,000 mg / kg ) , should be applied to dogs to eliminate microfilaria .
in such a microfilaria suppression test , loss of efficacy would be demonstrated , if > 75 % of microfilariae remain one week after administration of the microfilaricide [ 23 ] .
currently , it is not known whether microfilaria suppression tests have been considered for these microfilaria - positive dogs .
only the wild - type p - gp genotype of d. immitis was detected in australian samples .
in this study we did not document the gg - gg p - gp genotype of d. immitis associated with ivermectin - resistance [ 7 , 22 , 23 ] .
despite the published association , any direct causal effect of the gg - gg genotype has not been demonstrated [ 7 , 22 , 23 ] .
our p - gp amplification varied from the original approach [ 22 , 23 ] .
firstly , only stored frozen blood was available and therefore we could not assess individual microfilaria .
secondly , published p - gp amplification used full genome amplification using repli - g ( r ) ( qiagen ) , while we employed genomiphi v2 dna amplification kit ( ge healthcare ) .
both kits use multiple displacement amplification , but have been shown to give different yields of dna and variable genome amplification coverage [ 36 ] .
it is plausible that the use of genomiphi to amplify dna caused miss - priming of the p - gp oligonucleotides and subsequent pcr amplification of non - specific products .
further investigations into the genetic identity of australian d. immitis isolates are potentially valuable for comparative purposes with those from north america and europe .
conclusion for patent microfilariaemic dogs , administration of heartworm preventatives without treatment with melarsomine dihydrochloride to eliminate adult worms has the potential to select a population of d. immitis resistant to heartworm preventatives [ 31 ] .
in australia , heartworm prevention is ubiquitous and annual testing or testing prior yearly ml administration is only rarely undertaken , because heartworm disease is now rare .
therefore , this situation may allow for the detection of asymptomatic microfilariaemic dogs that are on monthly prevention .
most of the monthly doses will rapidly remove microfilaria , however the non - lethal effect on the adult d. immitis female may result in the reappearance of microfilariae before the next monthly dose is administered and especially if further doses are missed .
these microfilariaemic dogs represent local reservoirs , increasing the likelihood of transmission to dogs that missed more than one monthly heartworm prevention .
this scenario is plausible for the present cohort of dogs which were domiciled within a small area in coastal queensland , australia .
currently , no information is available about the extent of this phenomenon in australia .
these findings demonstrate that heartworm is endemic in australia .
strict prevention according to the label of the preventative and annual heartworm test should be practiced across australia , despite most areas are currently considered of low prevalence .
the low endemic status of heartworm status in australia is currently a limiting factor for the development of a transmission model for heartworm .

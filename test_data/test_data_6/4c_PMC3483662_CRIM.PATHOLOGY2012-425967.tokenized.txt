metastatic carcinomas involving the lung are a common specimen encountered in surgical pathology .
these metastases may have different morphologic , and architectural patterns and may mimic primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma , especially the intra - alveolar ( lepidic ) pattern of spread which may simulate a primary pulmonary bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( adenocarcinoma in situ ) .
we present the case of a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that morphologically mimicked bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung in that the tumor had an exclusive intra - alveolar pattern of spread and had an immunophenotype that was noninformative as to the site of origin ( cytokeratin 7 + , cytokeratin 20 - , ttf - 1 - ) .
in this case , we used kras gene mutation analysis to support that the lung carcinoma represented a metastatic pancreatic carcinoma as they both possessed identical codon 12 kras mutations .
we show that this method may be a useful way to prove site of origin of metastatic carcinoma - - particularly if standard morphologic or immunohistochemical analysis is not definitive .
1. introduction the lungs are a frequent site of both metastatic and primary carcinoma .
many different patterns of metastases to the lungs have been described : nodules / masses , lymphangitic carcinomatosis , tumor emboli , endobronchial growth , and intra - alveolar ( lepidic ) spread .
in intra - alveolar spread , the tumor cells replace the lining of alveoli , mimicking bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( adenocarcinoma in situ ) .
metastases from gastrointestinal tract carcinomas , including the pancreas , are known to have an intra - alveolar pattern of spread [ 1 , 2 ] .
immunohistochemical studies are usually helpful in distinguishing between these entities .
for example , if the tumor expresses thyroid transcription factor - 1 ( ttf - 1 ) this is strong evidence that the tumor is a pulmonary primary .
however , in many instances immunohistochemistry may not be as useful , particularly when one encounters an adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation that is ttf - 1 negative .
in this setting , morphology and immunohistochemistry may not be definitive and clinical correlation is often relied on to make the distinction .
mutations involving the kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( kras ) gene are present in the vast majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas ( more than 90 %) and less frequently in pulmonary adenocarcinoma ( 15 - 30 %) [ 3 - 6 ] .
in this paper , we used the identification of a kras mutation as a molecular signature of a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the lung and thus show that this technique can be used to identify site of origin of metastatic carcinoma .
2. case report a 60 - year - old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease , abdominal aortic aneurysm , and 60 pack - year smoking history developed painless jaundice one year before evaluation .
his ca 19.9 was elevated at 2770 u / ml ( reference interval 0 - 25 u / ml ) .
computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis showed a 3.0 cm mass involving the head of the pancreas associated with dilation of the main pancreatic duct .
multiple small nodules were noted in the lungs that initially were felt to represent pneumonia ; antibiotics were administered .
one month after presentation the patient underwent laparotomy for his pancreatic mass .
the lung lesions noted on ct scan persisted and the patient underwent ct guided lung biopsy .
3. materials and methods 3.1 .
histology and immunohistochemistry standard hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) stained sections of the pathologic specimens were examined .
the immunohistochemical studies were performed at our hospital laboratories .
these included thyroid transcription factor - 1 ( ttf - 1 , 8g7g3 / 1 clone , cell marque , rocklin , ca , usa ) , cytokeratin 7 ( ov - tl clone , dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) , and cytokeratin 20 ( k520.8 clone , dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) .
the immunostaining was performed on the ventana benchmark xt ( ventana medical systems , tucson , az , usa ) using the standard procedures per the manufacturer 's instructions .
hematoxylin counterstain was used .
3.2 .
dna extraction and pcr amplification manual dissection of regions containing greater than 50 % tumor was performed from the formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) block .
dna extraction was performed according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( trimgen waxfree paraffin dna extraction kit , sparks , md , usa ) .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was performed on a geneamp pcr system 9700 .
the primers used to amplify the kras gene codon 12 were biotin labeled forward pcr primers 5 ' - biotin - tgactgaatataaacttgtggtagttg - 3 ' and reverse primer 5 ' - tcgtccacaaaatgattctgaa - 3 ' .
the sequence primers were 12p1 : 5 ' - gca ctc ttg cct acg cca c , 12p2 : 5 ' - gca ctc ttg cct acg cca , and 13p2 : 5 ' - gca ctc ttg cct acg .
the pcr program was as follows : 95degreesc 5 minutes ; 95degreesc for 20 seconds , 58degreesc , hold for 30 seconds , 72degreesc , hold for 20 seconds ; for 40 cycles , 72degreesc for 5 minutes .
3.3 .
detection of kras mutations by pyrosequencing a 20 ul of biotinylated pcr product was immobilized on streptavidin coated sepharose beads ( streptavidin sepharose high performance , ge healthcare , piscataway , nj , usa ) .
the mixtures were spun at 1300 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes , and then the beads that contain pcr products were cleaned , denatured , and washed .
sequencing primers were annealed to the single strand dna fragments .
the sequence reaction and the detection were performed by pyrosequencer id ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) .
the results were reported as percentage of the mutation versus the wild type .
4. results 4.1 .
pathologic findings intraoperative evaluation of whipple resection revealed a 3.0 cm mass in the head of the pancreas that grossly wrapped around the bile duct .
microscopic sections from the tumor showed a moderate to poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
the tumor cells showed both well defined gland formation and other areas with a more sheet like growth .
metastatic carcinoma was present in regional lymph nodes .
immunohistochemical stains of the adenocarcinoma involving the pancreas revealed strong expression of cytokeratin 7 .
microscopic sections of the lung biopsy showed a well - differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma involving the lung with an intra - alveolar ( lepidic ) spread ( figure 1 ( a )) .
the hyperchromatic tumor cells were cuboidal to tall columnar with deep eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged along the alveolar walls .
necrosis was not present .
angiolymphatic invasion of tumor was not seen .
the lung tumor resembled the well differentiated areas of the pancreatic tumor ; however the bulk of the pancreas tumor was more poorly differentiated .
the lung tumor stained strongly with cytokeratin 7 ( figure 1 ( b )) but was negative for cytokeratin 20 and ttf - 1 .
on morphological and immunohistochemical grounds alone we could not definitively distinguish between a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a nonmucinous bronchioalveolar carcinoma .
4.2 .
pyrosequencing / molecular studies pyrosequencing of the kras gene in codon 12 and 13 revealed that both the pancreatic carcinoma and the lung carcinoma harbored an identical codon 12 c .
35 g > t ( gly12val ) kras mutation .
in this clinical and pathologic context , the presence of identical kras mutations in the pancreas and lung was felt to be supportive of a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the lung .
5. discussion k - ras is a protein encoded by the kras gene with gtpase activity that is involved in signal transduction of the cells and acts downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) .
it is important for cell growth and differentiation .
if the kras gene is mutated , it becomes oncogenic leading to the activation of ras signaling .
kras mutations are one of the important events in the tumorigenesis of carcinomas of different organs including the pancreas , colon , and lung [ 3 , 7 , 8 ] .
the most frequent tumor to have a kras mutation is pancreatic adenocarcinoma which is present in more than 90 % of the cases [ 3 ] .
in one study , it was shown that both primary pancreatic carcinoma and its corresponding metastasis carry the same kras mutation [ 3 ] .
codon 12 is the most common site for kras gene mutation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with most being c .
35 g > t ( gly12val ) mutations [ 3 ] .
the percentage of kras mutation is much lower in pulmonary adenocarcinoma ( 15 - 30 %) , the particular mutation seen in this case c .
35 g > t ( gly12val ) represents a subset of the kras mutated lung carcinomas [ 4 - 6 ] .
many studies have shown that kras mutation is more common in mucinous than nonmucinous bronchioalveolar carcinomas , especially in smokers [ 9 , 10 ] .
it has been shown that metastatic foci of tumor should have the same kras mutation as their original primary tumor [ 7 ] .
however , metastatic lesions might show new mutations that were not present in the primary .
in one study of colorectal adenocarcinoma , the frequency of different mutations ( kras , braf , nras , and pik3ca ) were found to vary significantly with the location of the metastasis ( lung , brain , and liver ) [ 7 ] .
analysis of the mutation in the primary and metastases showed concordance in 88 % of cases ( 86 out of 97 cases ) for all 4 genes analyzed .
in the discordant cases , 9 out of 11 cases had mutations that were present only in the metastatic foci .
the lungs are a common site of carcinoma metastasis .
several patterns of metastasis to the lung have been described : discrete nodules , lymphangitic carcinomatosis , tumor emboli , and the intra - alveolar ( lepidic spread ) pattern .
the intra - alveolar pattern is the most difficult to distinguish from a primary pulmonary carcinoma - - principally bronchioalveolar carcinoma ( adenocarcinoma in situ ) .
it is well known that metastases from the gastrointestinal tract will often exhibit an intra - alveolar spread [ 1 , 2 ] .
this can create a significant diagnostic dilemma .
distinguishing primary lung adenocarcinoma from metastatic carcinoma is not always straight forward , and additional immunohistochemical studies can be helpful .
the most useful immunohistochemical stains to differentiate gastrointestinal carcinoma from lung carcinoma are ttf - 1 , cytokeratin 7 , cytokeratin 20 , cdx2 , and villin [ 11 - 14 ] .
ttf - 1 is positive in the vast majority of conventional pulmonary adenocarcinomas including nonmucinous type bronchioalveolar carcinoma ( bac ) .
however , among mucinous bac only 21 % were positive for ttf - 1 [ 15 ] .
both lung and upper gastrointestinal tract ( stomach , pancreas ) often express cytokeratin 7 while colorectal carcinomas are less likely to be positive .
cytokeratin 20 is expressed in most colorectal carcinomas and less frequently in upper gastrointestinal tract carcinomas .
the expression of cytokeratin 20 is uncommon in conventional primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma , however , most mucinous bac express cytokeratin 20 [ 11 ] .
the transcription factor cdx2 is a reliable marker of intestinal differentiation along with the expression of villin .
among primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma however , both cdx2 and less commonly villin may be expressed in primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas particularly those with mucinous differentiation [ 16 , 17 ] .
despite these markers , in many cases it may be difficult to definitively distinguish a primary from a metastatic carcinoma , particularly those with mucinous differentiation .
in this paper we demonstrate that mutational analysis of kras can be used diagnostically to more definitively determine the site of origin of a metastatic carcinoma - - in this instance a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the lung .
using kras mutation analysis as a means to support site of origin of a metastatic tumor has not been previously reported .
mutational analysis of p53 mutations were used in a study of metastatic carcinomas to the lung in which the primary site could not be identified. by comparing the p53 mutation to those present in the known primary tumor , p53 mutation analysis could correctly classify seven of nine tumors in the lung in which it was unknown if this represented a primary tumor versus a metastases [ 18 ] .
a similar method was used by nakazato et al. who used p53 mutation analysis to demonstrate that a patient with multiple lung tumors harbored both a lung carcinoma and a metastatic breast carcinoma [ 19 ] .
since the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are associated with kras mutations and the pattern of metastasis to the lung of pancreatic carcinoma often mimics bronchioalveolar carcinoma , we feel that kras mutational analysis can be a useful adjunct to definitively determine the site of origin .
this method is advantageous in that it can easily be used on ffpe tissue samples .
one drawback to this method is that the metastatic tumor might harbor mutations that are not present in the primary tumor [ 7 ] .
also , theoretical treatment could induce changes within the tumor or select for certain clones of tumor cells that possess a different mutation than those present in the primary tumor .
ideally , the use of kras mutational analysis would be most helpful if the mutation was mutually exclusive to the lung adenocarcinoma , but there also exists a possibility that the patient may develop two distinct primaries that harbor identical kras mutations .
this method along with conventional morphologic comparison and immunohistochemistry could provide an additional level of support that the tumor represents a metastatic carcinoma .
another drawback is the requirement of having both tumor tissue from a primary tumor and the metastases for comparison .
this approach should be used with caution if molecular testing is only performed on the tissue suspected to be of metastatic origin .
6. conclusion we demonstrate that the mutational analysis of kras can be useful to help determine the site of origin of a metastatic carcinoma to the lung in a case in which the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were not definitive .
further studies on a larger series of cases may help to validate this approach .

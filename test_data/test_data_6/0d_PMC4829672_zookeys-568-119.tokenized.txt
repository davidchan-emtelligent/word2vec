the new species is distinguished by a combination of the following character states : 1 ) the lamina circularis at the base of the pectoral fin in adult male having a simple roundish plate form ; 2 ) a narrowing of the upper segments of the first branched ray of the pectoral fin ; 3 ) a short maxillary barbel whose length equals diameter of the eye ; 4 ) 14 prepelvic myotomes , and 5 ) l3 and l5 well developed , forming longitudinal obvious stripes in males during the spawning season .

doi : 10.3897 / zookeys.568.7733 introduction the genus cobitis linnaeus , 1758 ( cypriniformes : cobitidae ) includes small , slender - bodied benthic freshwater fishes .
the genus is characterised by the following features : the suborbital spine is erectile ; the mouth is small and inferior with three pairs of barbels ; body pigmentation is organised in one dorsal and four lateral longitudinal lines or rows of blotches ; and the presence of the lamina circularis at the base of the pectoral fin in adult males ( nalbant 1963 , kottelat and freyhof 2007 , kim 2009 ) .
approximately 80 species of the genus have been identified in eurasia and northwestern africa ( kottelat 2012 , nakajima 2012 , chen and chen 2013 , chen et al. 2013 , buj et al. 2014 , erkakan and ozdemir 2014 , chen et al. 2015 , mousavi - sabet et al. 2015 , nakajima and suzawa 2016 ) .
nine species within cobitis , namely 1 ) cobitis biwae jordan & snyder , 1901 , 2 ) cobitis striata ikeda , 1936 , 3 ) cobitis matsubarae okada & ikeda , 1939 , 4 ) cobitis takatsuensis mizuno , 1970 , 5 ) cobitis shikokuensis suzawa , 2006 , 6 ) cobitis magnostriata nakajima , 2012 , 7 ) cobitis minamorii nakajima , 2012 , 8 ) cobitis kaibarai nakajima , 2012 and 9 ) cobitis sakahoko nakajima & suzawa , 2015 , and six subspecies , namely 1 ) cobitis minamorii tokaiensis nakajima , 2012 , 2 ) cobitis minamorii oumieneis nakajima , 2012 , 3 ) cobitis minamorii yodoensis nakajima , 2012 , 4 ) cobitis minamorii saninensis nakajima , 2012 , 5 ) cobitis striata fuchigamii nakajima , 2012 , and 6 ) cobitis striata hakataensis nakajima , 2012 have been described in japan ( nakajima 2012 , hosoya 2013 , nakajima and suzawa 2016 ) .
previously , takeno et al .
( 2010 ) reported a cobitis species from tango district , honshu island , japan , which they tentatively named as a ' tango tetraploid form ' of cobitis striata .
this species had clearly distinctive differences in body colouration patterns and mitochondrial dna sequences as compared to other japanese species of spined loach .
therefore , they concluded that the species was an unknown new species ( takeno et al. 2010 ) .
however , to date , this spined loach remained undescribed .
in the current paper , i describe it as a new species on the basis of 11 type specimens .
materials and methods i examined 11 specimens collected from a small river in tango district , kyoto prefecture , honshu island , japan ( figs 1 , 2 ) .
there is a risk of this new species being commercially overfished for the ornamental fish market ( takeno et al. 2010 , kitagawa 2015 ) .
therefore , the precise locality of the population is not revealed in the current paper so as to protect the species .
all specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin and preserved in 70 % ethanol .
the methods used for counting and measurement of body morphological features followed kottelat and freyhof ( 2007 ) and nakajima ( 2012 ) .
all measurements performed using a digital calliper and were recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. the last two branched rays articulating on the last complex pterygiophore of the dorsal and anal fins were counted as one ray .
the prepelvic myotome number ( pmn ) was defined as the number of muscle segments between the base of the pectoral fin and the origin of the pelvic fin ( nakajima 2012 ) .
the right pectoral fin of holotype and some paratypes was resected and was made transparent by placing it in 4 % koh for 24 h. after staining with alizarin red s + 1 % koh for 24 h , the lamina circularis and the upper segments of the first branched ray of the pectoral fin ( usp ) were observed and sketched using a stereomicroscope .
the dorsal and lateral colour patterns were organised in five longitudinal lines of pigmentation , which were abbreviated as lines l1 to l5 according to the scheme of takeda and fujie ( 1945 ) ( see also nakajima 2012 ) .
the black spots at the caudal - fin base and the markings of the dorsal and caudal fins are additionally described .

this new species is distinguished from nine species of cobitis in the japanese archipelago ( cobitis biwae , cobitis striata , cobitis matsubarae , cobitis takatsuensis , cobitis shikokuensis , cobitis magnostriata , cobitis minamorii , cobitis kaibarai and cobitis sakahoko ) by a combination of the following character states : a short maxillary barbel equaling in length the eye diameter ( vs. longer than the eye diameter in cobitis matsubarae , cobitis takatsuensis , cobitis shikokuensis and cobitis sakahoko ) ; a simple roundish lamina circularis ( vs. beak - shaped or narrow in cobitis biwae ; quite narrow in cobitis takatsuensis and cobitis shikokuensis ; rectangular with a neck in cobitis sakahoko ) ; a narrow usp ( vs. broad in cobitis matsubarae , cobitis takatsuensis , cobitis shikokuensis , cobitis magnostriata and cobitis sakahoko ) ; pmn 14 ( vs. commonly 12 in cobitis minamorii ; commonly 13 in cobitis striata and cobitis kaibarai ) ; a l5 formed of blotches out of spawning season ( vs. stripe - like in and out of spawning season in cobitis takatsuensis and cobitis magnostriata ) ; both spots at caudal base obvious ( vs. lower spot inconspicuous in cobitis striata and cobitis kaibarai ) ; and ploidy tetraploid ( vs. diploid in cobitis striata , cobitis takatsuensis , cobitis shikokuensis , cobitis minamorii and cobitis kaibarai ) .
these comparative data were summarised from nakajima and suzawa ( 2016 ). remarks .
till date , cobitis takenoi has only been found in one small river system , and the habitat is under threat from river improvement .
in addition , some threatened freshwater fishes are captured and sold illegally in japan ( e.g. parabotia curtus , watanabe et al .
2015 ) , and this new species is similarly at the risk of being commercially overfished for the ornamental fish market ( takeno et al. 2010 ) .
therefore , the species is ranked as a critically endangered species ( cr ) - as cobitis sp .
- in the japanese red list ( kitagawa 2015 ) .
the distribution pattern , suitable habitat and life history of this species are not well - known .
basic biological investigations are required for its effective conservation .

patients and methods .
we studied 287 spa patients : 131 had as , 110 had psa , and 46 had sapho .
we assessed extra - articular symptoms in all cases .
in 191 spa patients , we measured serum interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , interleukin - 18 ( il - 18 ) , interleukin - 23 ( il - 23 ) , endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , and epidermal growth factor ( egf ). results .
patients with acute anterior uveitis ( aau ) had higher vas ( p = 0.0008 ) , badsdai ( p = 0.0001 ) , asdas - esr ( p = 0.04 ) , crp ( p = 0.006 ) , il - 6 ( p = 0.02 ) , and il - 18 ( p = 0.03 ) levels .
patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) had higher vas ( p = 0.03 ) , crp ( p = 0.0009 ) , and il - 6 ( p = 0.0003 ) levels .
patients with skin psoriasis had lower vas ( p = 0.001 ) and basdai ( p = 0.00007 ) levels .
patients with psoriatic onycholysis had lower vas ( p = 0.006 ) , basdai ( p = 0.00001 ) , and crp ( p = 0.02 ) and higher il - 23 ( p = 0.04 ) levels .
patients with ppp had lower basdai ( p = 0.04 ) and higher et - 1 ( p = 0.001 ) levels. conclusions .
spa patients with increased serum il - 18 and decreased serum et - 1 had an increased risk of extra - articular symptoms .
in spa patients , increased disease activity was associated with an increased risk of aau and ibd and a decreased risk of skin psoriasis , psoriatic onycholysis , and ppp .

introduction ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) , psoriatic arthritis ( psa ) , and sapho syndrome ( sapho ) are seronegative spondyloarthropathies ( spa ) which are connected with the presence of hla - b27 antigen [ 1 - 3 ] .
in the course of the diseases different extra - articular clinical symptoms could appear , such as acute anterior uveitis aau , inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , psoriasis , psoriatic onychopathy , and palmoplantar pustulosis ( ppp ) [ 1 - 3 ] .
the presence of different extra - articular symptoms in the course of spa has an influence on the course of spa and therapeutic decisions [ 4 - 9 ] .
several proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , interleukin - 18 ( il - 18 ) , interleukin - 23 ( il - 23 ) are considered to play a role in pathogenesis of spa [ 10 - 14 ] .
also cytokines involved in angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , and proinflammatory peptide endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) are considered to be involve in inflammatory process in spa [ 15 - 17 ] .
there are data that development of different extra - articular symptoms is connected with elevated levels of different markers of inflammatory process [ 4 , 6 , 13 ] .
additionally vascular abnormalities and endothelial dysfunction are considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of aau , ibd , and psoriasis [ 18 - 20 ] .
2. objectives the aim of our study was to assess extra - articular symptoms in constellation with selected serum cytokines and disease activity in spa .
we selected cytokines that play a role in the pathogenesis of spa and are involved in angiogenesis and endothelial function .
3. materials and methods this study was approved by the ethics committee of the pomeranian medical university in szczecin ( kb - 0012 / 106 / 10 ; 27sep2010 ) .
informed consent was obtained from all patients .
we studied 287 spa patients : 131 had as , 110 had psa , and 46 had sapho .
all patients were caucasian .
the following data were recorded : age , sex , disease duration , and extra - articular symptoms : acute anterior uveitis ( aau ) , inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , skin psoriasis , psoriatic onychopathy , and positivity for hla b27 .
the diagnosis of as was made according to modified new york criteria [ 1 ] .
the diagnosis of psa was made according to the caspar classification criteria [ 2 ] .
the diagnosis of sapho syndrome was made according to the kahn criteria [ 3 ] .
in the psa group , skin changes were assessed according to the psoriasis area and severity index ( pasi ) [ 21 ] .
the patient 's pain due to the disease at the time of examination was assessed using a visual analogue scale ( vas ) .
we also assessed the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index ( basdai ) .
this index has a possible score of 0 - 10 , with a higher score indicating greater disease activity .
we regarded patients as active if the basdai score was > 4 [ 22 ] .
the ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score ( asdas ) was assessed using esr .
the asdas - esr was calculated , in as patients and psa patients with axial joint involvement , using online calculator available at the assessment of spondyloarthritis international society website .
disease activity score calculation , in psa patients , were made use of free online disease activity score 28 ( das28 ) calculator .
in the first 191 spa patients , 81 had as , 76 had psa , and 34 had sapho ; we studied serum levels of selected cytokines : il - 6 , il - 23 , il - 18 , endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) , vegf , and egf .
additionally , we studied crp and esr .
the controls were 30 healthy volunteers .
the methods of assessment of these cytokines were presented in our previous paper [ 13 ] .
data distributions were assessed using the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
data are described as mean +/ - standard deviation and median ( q1 and q3 ) .
the r values of correlations were determined and corresponding p values < 0.05 were considered significant .
the groups were compared using student 's t - test , mann - whitney u test , and kruskal - wallis test .
to assess parameters pearson 's chi - squared test ( chi 2 ) , logistic regression analysis , and step - wise analysis were performed .
the level of significance was set at p < 0.05 .
the statistical analysis was performed using statistica version 8.0 , statsoft , inc. , tulsa , united states .
4. results the clinical characteristics of spa patients and the prevalence of extra - articular symptoms are presented in table 1 .
data presenting serum levels of selected cytokines and markers of disease activity in subgroup of 191 spa patients and 30 controls are presented in our previous paper by przepiera - bedzak et al .
[ 13 ] .
4.1 .
acute anterior uveitis aau was observed in 12.1 % of spa patients , in 26.0 % of as , and in 0.9 % of psa .
no one patient with sapho had aau ( table 1 ) .
the prevalence of aau was higher in as than in psa ( p < 0.000001 ) and in as than in sapho ( p = 0.0001 ) .
we compared spa patients with aau to those without aau .
spa patients with aau had longer disease duration ( p = 0.0002 ) and higher prevalence of hla - b27 antigen ( p = 0.0001 ) .
spa patients with aau had higher disease activity as assessed using the vas ( p = 0.0008 ) , badsdai ( p = 0.0001 ) , asdas - esr ( p = 0.04 ) , and crp ( p = 0.006 ) .
additionally , they had lower disease activity as assessed using the das28 ( p < 0.0001 ) ( table 2 ) .
in spa patients increased crp ( p = 0.01 ) and basdai ( p = 0.005 ) were associated with increased risk of aau ( table 4 ) .
spa patients with aau compared to those without aau had higher serum il - 6 ( p = 0.02 ) and il - 18 ( p = 0.03 ) levels ( table 2 ) .
spa patients with aau compared to healthy controls had higher serum il - 6 levels ( p = 0.02 ) .
spa patients with aau compared to healthy controls had higher serum il - 18 levels ( p = 0.00009 ) .
in spa patients as compared to healthy controls , increased serum levels of il - 6 ( p = 0.02 ) , il - 23 ( p = 0.03 ) , and il - 18 ( p = 0.0006 ) were associated with increased risk of aau ( table 5 ) .
in spa patients as compared to healthy controls , decreased serum levels of et - 1 ( p = 0.0007 ) were associated with increased risk of aau ( table 5 ) .
4.2 .
inflammatory bowel disease ibd was present in 3.5 % spa patients and in 7.6 % as patients .
no one patient with psa or sapho had ibd ( table 1 ) .
the prevalence of ibd was higher in as than in psa patients ( p = 0.004 ) .
we compared spa patients with ibd to those without ibd .
spa patients with ibd had higher prevalence of hla - b27 antigen ( p = 0.04 ) and higher disease activity as assessed using the vas ( p = 0.03 ) , crp ( p = 0.0009 ) , and il - 6 ( p = 0.0003 ) .
additionally , they had lower disease activity as assessed using the das28 ( p < 0.0001 ) ( table 2 ) .
spa patients with ibd compared to healthy controls had higher serum il - 6 levels ( p = 0.007 ) .
when spa patients were compared to controls , increased serum levels il - 18 ( p = 0.03 ) were associated with an increased risk of ibd ( table 5 ) .
4.3 .
skin psoriasis skin psoriasis was present in 32.4 % of spa patients , in 82.7 % psa patients , and in 1.5 % as patients ( table 1 ) .
we compared spa patients with skin psoriasis to those without skin psoriasis .
spa patients with skin psoriasis had shorter disease duration ( p = 0.004 ) , lower prevalence of hla - b27 antigen ( p = 0.00004 ) , and lower disease activity as assessed using the vas ( p = 0.001 ) , and basdai ( p = 0.00007 ) ( table 3 ) .
in spa patients , increased vas ( p = 0.003 ) and basdai ( p = 0.002 ) were associated with decreased risk of skin psoriasis ( table 4 ) .
there were no differences in serum levels of il - 6 , il - 23 , il - 18 , vegf , and egf between spa patients with and without skin psoriasis ( table 3 ) .
there were no correlations between serum il - 6 , il - 23 , il - 18 , and pasi score ( all p > 0.05 ) .
in spa patients as compared to healthy controls , increased serum levels of il - 18 ( p = 0.0002 ) and decreased serum levels of et - 1 ( p = 0.006 ) were associated with increased risk of skin psoriasis ( table 5 ) .
4.4 .
psoriatic onychopathy psoriatic onychopathy was present in 25.4 % spa patients and 66.4 % psa patients ( table 1 ) .
we compared spa patients with psoriatic onychopathy to those without psoriatic onychopathy .
spa patients with psoriatic onychopathy had shorter disease duration ( p = 0.009 ) , lower prevalence of hla - b27 antigen ( p = 0.0004 ) , and lower disease activity as assessed using the vas ( p = 0.006 ) , basdai ( p = 0.00001 ) , crp ( p = 0.02 ) , and il - 23 ( p = 0.04 ) ( table 3 ) .
spa patients with psoriatic onychopathy compared to healthy controls had higher il - 23 level ( p = 0.02 ) .
spa patients with increased basdai ( p = 0.002 ) had lower risk of psoriatic onychopathy ( table 4 ) .
in spa patients , compared to healthy controls , increased serum levels of il - 18 ( p = 0.0002 ) and decreased serum levels of et - 1 ( p = 0.008 ) were associated with increased risk of psoriatic onychopathy ( table 5 ) .
4.5 .
palmoplantar pustulosis ppp was present in 14.6 % spa patients and in 91.3 % sapho patients ( table 1 ) .
we compared spa patients with ppp with those without ppp .
spa patients with ppp had shorter disease duration ( p = 0.0009 ) , lower prevalence of hla - b27 antigen ( p = 0.0008 ) , and lower disease activity as assessed using the basdai ( p = 0.04 ) .
they had higher esr ( p = 0.004 ) and higher serum et - 1 ( p = 0.001 ) ( table 3 ) .
there were no differences in serum et - 1 between spa patients with ppp and healthy controls ( p = 0.4 ) .
in spa patients compared to healthy controls increased serum levels of il - 18 ( p = 0.01 ) were associated with increased risk of ppp ( table 5 ) .
5. discussion we presented extra - articular symptoms in constellation with disease activity and selected serum cytokines which are involved in disease activity , angiogenesis , and endothelial function in spa patients .
the percentage of aau in spa patients and as patients in our study was similar to those presented by other authors [ 4 - 6 , 9 ] .
the most important genetic factor associated with aau is hla - b27 [ 8 ] .
we confirmed these associations in our study too .
in our study aau was the most frequent in as patients .
additionally , spa patients with aau had higher levels of asdas - esr and lower das28 .
these confirm observations of other authors that aau is more frequent in axial spa [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] .
these suggest that there is association between severity of axial , but not peripheral arthritis with aau occurrence in spa .
we also confirmed as other authors that patients with aau had longer disease duration and higher disease activity [ 4 , 8 ] .
il - 6 plays role in arthritis but its role in spa pathogenesis is controversial .
kramer et al .
[ 23 ] presented increased serum levels of il - 6 in patients with active uveitis .
in our study we found that spa patients with aau had higher serum levels of il - 6 .
additionally , increased serum il - 6 was associated with increased risk of aau in spa .
in our previous study by przepiera - bedzak et al .
[ 14 ] we showed increased serum il - 6 in spa patients and positive correlation with markers of disease activity such as esr and crp .
these could suggest the role of il - 6 in pathogenesis of aau in spa .
il - 18 is considered as one of proinflammatory cytokine which also activate and deregulate endothelial function .
in our previous study we confirmed higher levels of il - 18 in spa patients and as patients [ 13 ] .
in current study we additionally confirmed that serum il - 18 was higher in spa patients with aau and compared to healthy controls .
additionally , increased serum il - 18 increased risk of aau .
these suggest the role of il - 18 in the pathogenesis of aau in spa by influence on inflammatory process and endothelial function .
the percentage of ibd in spa patients in our study was similar to those presented by other authors [ 4 , 5 ] .
patients with ibd had longer disease duration and higher disease activity , which correspond with other authors observations [ 6 ] .
additionally we observed that spa patients with ibd had lower das 28 .
this confirmed data presented by others that ibd is less frequent in spa patients with peripheral arthritis [ 6 ] .
these suggest that there is association between severity of axial , but not peripheral arthritis and ibd occurrence in spa .
the percentage of spa patients with skin psoriasis in our study was similar to the results presented by others [ 6 , 9 ] .
peluso et al .
[ 7 ] presented that 89.2 % of psa patients had psoriasis , and that psa patients with skin psoriasis had longer disease duration and more frequent axial disease .
in our study the percentage of psa patients with psoriasis was the same , but data concerning disease activity and disease duration were reversible .
we found that patients with skin psoriasis had shorted disease duration and lower asdas - esr which suggest that they had lower activity of axial spa .
on the other hand essers et al .
[ 4 ] in study of 216 as patients found that history of psoriasis was associated with grater age and lower crp .
in our study we found the same associations in spa patients with skin psoriasis .
additionally , we confirmed that increased disease activity measured by vas and basdai decreased risk of skin psoriasis .
these suggest that there is no association between severity of axial and peripheral arthritis and skin psoriasis occurrence in spa .
we also found that spa patients with skin psoriasis , compared to spa group without that symptom , had lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 6 , il - 23 , il - 18 , vegf , and egf .
nevertheless , we confirmed that increased serum il - 18 levels were associated with increased risk of skin psoriasis in spa .
these foundlings suggest that some markers of disease activity did not influence on prevalence of psoriatic skin changes .
on the other hand it can confirm the role of il - 18 in pathogenesis of skin psoriasis by influence on disease activity and endothelial function .
il - 23 is produced by keratinocytes and is considered to play a role in spa pathogenesis .
in our previous study by przepiera - bedzak et al .
[ 14 ] we showed increased serum il - 23 levels in spa patients .
it was interesting that we did not find correlation between serum il - 23 and pasi [ 14 ] .
in current study there were no differences in serum level of il - 23 between patients with and without psoriasis , which suggested that serum il - 23 could influence pathogenesis of skin psoriasis but did not reflect a presence of skin disease in spa patients .
psoriatic onychopathy was observed only in psa group .
peluso et al. have presented psoriatic onychopathy in 89.2 % psa patients [ 7 ] .
in spa patients 66.4 % had psoriatic onychopathy .
in our study we fund that longer disease duration and higher disease activity were associated with decreased risk of psoriatic onychopathy .
these suggest that there is no association between severity of axial and peripheral joints arthritis and psoriatic onychopathy occurrence in spa .
the axis il - 17 / ilk - 23 is considered to play the crucial role in spa pathogenesis .
in our study we presented association between psoriatic onychopathy and serum il - 23 .
spa patients with psoriatic onychopathy had higher serum il - 23 than healthy controls .
in our previous study by przepiera - bedzak et al .
[ 14 ] we confirmed that spa patients had higher serum il - 23 than healthy controls .
results of our study confirm the role il - 23 in pathogenesis of psoriatic onychopathy .
there were data which confirmed increased serum il - 18 in sapho .
these suggested role of il - 18 in pathogenesis of saho [ 12 , 13 ] .
in our study increased serum il - 18 was associated with increased risk of ppp .
this could confirm the role of il - 18 in pathogenesis of ppp by influence on disease activity and endothelial function .
et - 1 plays a role in inflammation and vasculopathy .
kuryliszyn - moskal et al .
[ 24 ] presented increased serum et - 1 in rheumatoid arthritis patients with extra - articular symptoms .
in a previous study by przepiera - bedzak et al .
[ 13 ] , serum et - 1 levels were lower in spa patients than in controls , but levels were significantly higher in sapho than in as or psa .
in our current study spa patients with ppp compared with those without ppp had higher et - 1 level .
so we can speculate that maybe et - 1 by its influence on vasculopathy and inflammation can play a role in ppp pathogenesis in spa patients .
6. conclusion the analysis of serum levels of selected cytokines in spa patients with and without extra - articular symptoms and healthy controls confirmed the following : patients with aau had higher serum il - 6 and il - 18 ; patients with ibd had higher levels of il - 6 ; patients with nail psoriasis had higher levels of il - 23 ; patients with ppp had higher levels of et - 1 .
in spa patients , increased serum il - 18 and decreased serum et - 1 were associated with an increased risk of extra - articular symptoms .
additionally , increased serum il - 6 and il - 23 increased the risk of aau .
among spa patients , increased disease activity was associated with an increased risk of aau and ibd and a decreased risk of skin psoriasis , psoriatic onycholysis , and ppp .

here , we suggest that electromagnetic emissions before rupture may be the mechanism for the explanation of abnormal behavior of animals before earthquakes .
groundwater chemistry anomalous animal behavior electromagnetic fields precursors 1 .
introduction we share the opinion of the authors of ref .
[ 1 ] that many changes in the environment prior to major earthquakes have been documented .
actually these changes have been observed on the land surface , in water , in the air and in the ionosphere .
some of these changes , and in particular the electric and magnetic field precursory changes , have been used in practice in the 1990s [ 2,3 ] and 2000s [ 4 ] to announce the parameters ( epicenter , magnitude and time - window ) of impending major earthquakes in greece .
the authors of ref .
[ 1 ] suggest that the key to understanding these diverse pre - earthquake phenomena has been the discovery that , when tectonic stesses build up in the earth 's crust , highly mobile electronic change carries are activated .
these carries , which are positive holes , can flow out of the stressed rock volume and spread into the surrounding unstressed rocks .
when these positive holes arrive at the earth 's surface , they cause a range of follow - on reactions resulting in air ionization , injecting massive amounts of primarily positive air ions into the lower atmosphere .
when they arrive at the rock - water interface , they act as o radicals , oxidizing water to hydrogen peroxide .
in addition , other reactions take place which include the oxidation or partial oxidation of dissolved organic compounds .
the authors of ref .
[ 1 ] suggest that some of compounds thus formed , may be irritants or toxins to certain species of animals , which are possibly the origin of their anomalous behavior before major earthquakes .
in the above frame , the authors of ref .
[ 1 ] explain the unusual behavior of common toads , bufo bufo before the devastating earthquake of magnitude ( m ) 6.3 at l ' aquila , italy that occurred on 6 april 2009 .
in particular , a few days before this destructive event grant and halliday reported [ 5 ] that the toads disappeared from their breeding site ( in a small lake located around 75 km from the epicenter ) and returned after the aftershock series .
in short , potential changes in groundwater chemistry prior to seismic events and their possible effects on animals are discussed in ref .
[ 1 ] .
here , we point out that an alternative point of view has been published several months before the occurrence of l ' aquila earthquake .
in particular , philippetis [ 6 ] , after reviewing the mechanisms through which electromagnetic radiation can markedly influence living organisms , deduced that the most likely candidate is the recent mechanism proposed by panagopoulos et al .
[ 7 ] , which foresees that low frequency ( i.e. , of the order of 1 khz or lower ) external electric fields of amplitude of a few v / m can cause significant biological effects .
then philippetis , by considering that such low frequency electric field variations have actually been detected ( e.g. , see refs [ 8,9,10,11 ]) before major earthquakes , finally concluded that the latter electric variations ( which of cource are accompanied by magnetic field variations ) constitute the origin for the anomalous biological effects observed before earthquakes , thus providing an explanation for the abnormal preseismic behavior of some animals .
philippetis' suggestion seems to be strengthened by the following fact : low frequency electric signals were actually detected before l ' aquila earthquake , which occurred several months after the publication of ref .
[ 6 ] .
in particular , it has been reported [ 12,13 ] that in a broad frequency range , well documented electromagnetic emission have been detected some days in advance , i.e. , on 26 march 2009 and on 4 april 2009 , respectively .
the analysis presented by grant et al .
[ 1 ] approaches the coincidence of unusual toad behavior and precursory ionospheric disturbances from a different perspective .
both phenomena are driven by a physical process in the earth crust , in the future focal volume , by the activation of h * charge carriers ( a process advanced by freund and coworkers [ 14,15,16 ] usually termed peroxy defects model ) during the rapid increase in tectonic stress prior to the earthquake .
as h * charge carriers spread out , they cause different secondary processes at the land surface and at the rock - water interface .
it is the process at the rock - water interface consisting of changes in the ground - water and presumably lake water chemistry , which seems to have provided the toads with an impetus to leave and seek refuse on higher ground .
thus , it seems that the peroxy defects model [ 14,15,16 ] provides a consistent framework for the explanation of both the toads unusual behavior and the generation of the em precursory phenomena , the latter being attributed to the generation of electric currents .
we note that such a generation of electric currents basically agrees with the pressure - stimulated currents model advanced in ref .
[ 17 ] ( and further treated in ref. [ 18 ]) which suggests that a co - operative orientation of the electric dipoles ( formed due to point defects ) occurs when the stress in the future focal area reaches a critical value .
this is in agreement with studies [ 19,20 ] showing that precursory electric signals have a scale - invariant structure which is a hallmark of criticality .
finally , we just note that the electrical measurements in ref .
[ 21 ] at a site lying only a few tens of km from the epicenter of l'aquila earthquake , which showed electrical oscillations of amplitude of the order micro - volts / meter in the range of hundreds of hz ( not being sufficient according to the work of ref .
[ 7 ] to enable the passage of ions across the cell membrane ) , do not preclude the alternative possibility we point out here in view of the following : first , the aforementioned monitoring site may not constitute ( due to the electrical geoelectrical structure in the area ) a station appreciably sensitive to the recording of precursory seismic electric signals as advocated in refs [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] .
note that the ses sensitivity may greatly vary among neighboring sites , e.g. , see the different response to the sites a , b , c ( differing by no more than 1 km ) in ioannina station in northwestern greece to the ses recordings as reported in a series of publications refs [ 22,23,24,25,26 ] .
furthermore , note that the frequency range of the ses activities is <= 1 hz which does not overlap with that in ref .
[ 21 ] , in which " signatures have revealed horizontally oriented electric fields , between 20 hz to 400 hz ( lasting from several minutes to up to two hours )" .
second , concerning the possible consequences of the presence of electric fields in the elf band on the behavior of organisms , there are no yet studies that connect the possibility of the passage of ions into the cell membranes .

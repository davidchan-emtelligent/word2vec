due to the lack of conclusive evidence in superiority in efficacy among various types of vasopressors , the choice of vasopressor use mainly depends on the physician preference .
objectives this study aims to describe the prevalence of vasopressor use and the trend in the use of each vasopressor medication in micu over the past 7 years .
methods this is a descriptive study conducted at a tertiary referral hospital .
all micu admissions at our institution between january 2007 and december 2013 were included in this study .
the use of vasopressor within given icu day ( 12.00 am - 11.59 pm ) during icu stay was reviewed .
vasopressors were defined as the continuous intravenous administration of norepinephrine , epinephrine , dopamine , phenylephrine , or vasopressin regardless of duration and dosage .
the use of each vasopressor was reported as the vasopressor utilization index ( vui ) , using the following formula vasopressor utilization index ( vui ) = the total number of icu days on a given vasopressor / the total number of icu days on any vasopressor .
results a total of 16,863 unique patients had 17,164 micu admissions in the course of study , ( 55,391patient * icu day ). out of 7,739 icu days with vasopressor use , norepinephrine was used for 6,414 ( 83 %) , vasopressin for 1,960 ( 25 %) , phenylephrine for 772 ( 10 %) , dopamine for 623 ( 8 %) , and epinephrine for 323 ( 4 %). from 2007 through 2013 , there was an increasing trend in the use of norepinephrine ( vuinorepinephrine was 0.69 in 2007 and 0.91 in 2013 ) and an slight increasing trend in the use of epinephrine ( vuiepinephrine was 0.01 in 2007 and 0.06 in 2013 ) .
there was a decreasing trend in the use of dopamine ( vuidopamine was 0.15 in 2007 and 0.03 in 2013 ) , vasopressin ( vuivasopressin was 0.42 in 2007 and 0.22 in 2013 ) , and a slight downward trend in the use of phenylephrine .
conclusions norepinephrine is the most commonly used vasopressor in micu .
the use of norepinephrine and epinephrine are in upward trajectory .

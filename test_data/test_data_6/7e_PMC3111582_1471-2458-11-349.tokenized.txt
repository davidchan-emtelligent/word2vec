background depression and diminished health status are common in adults with diabetes , but few studies have investigated associations with socio - economic environment .
the objective of this manuscript was to evaluate the relationship between neighborhood - level ses and health status and depression .
methods individual - level data on 1010 participants at baseline in look ahead ( action for health in diabetes ) , a trial of long - term weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes , were linked to neighborhood - level ses (% living below poverty ) from the 2000 us census ( tracts ) .
dependent variables included depression ( beck inventory ) , and health status ( medical outcomes study ( sf - 36 ) scale ) .
multi - level regression models were used to account simultaneously for individual - level age , sex , race , education , personal yearly income and neighborhood - level ses .
results overall , the % living in poverty in the participants' neighborhoods varied , mean = 11 % ( range 0 - 67 %) .
compared to their counterparts in the lowest tertile of neighborhood poverty ( least poverty ) , those in the highest tertile ( most poverty ) had significantly lower scores on the role - limitations ( physical ) , role limitations ( emotional ) , physical functioning , social functioning , mental health , and vitality sub - scales of the sf - 36 scale .
when evaluating sf - 36 composite scores , those living in neighborhoods with more poverty had significantly lower scores on the physical health ( beta - coefficient [ beta ] = - 1.90 units , 95 % ci : - 3.40 , - 0.039 ) , mental health ( beta = - 2.92 units , - 4.31 , - 1.53 ) and global health ( beta = - 2.77 units , - 4.21 , - 1.33 ) composite scores .
conclusion in this selected group of weight loss trial participants , lower neighborhood ses was significantly associated with poorer health status. whether these associations might influence response to the look ahead weight loss intervention requires further investigation .
background despite the surge of literature evaluating the neighborhood environment and general health , there is only a smaller , growing body of literature evaluating neighborhood and mental health outcomes [ 1 ] .
most previous studies have examined the perception of neighborhood problems with depression , anxiety , and health status [ 2 - 7 ] , with only a few using objective measures of the neighborhood environment [ 8 ] .
overall , most studies were multi - level and showed that more neighborhood problems or detrimental aspects of the physical environment are associated with worse mental health , particularly , depression .
it is well known that individuals with diabetes experience more depression and diminished health status compared to those without diabetes [ 9,10 ] .
therefore , to explore potential contributions to this relationship , it is important to understand the association between objective neighborhood context , health status , and depression among individuals with diabetes .
we conducted a multi - level , cross - sectional analysis at baseline in the look ahead study ( a multicenter controlled trial in 5,145 overweight adults with type 2 diabetes designed to determine the long - term health effects of interventions to achieve intentional weight loss ) to determine the association between neighborhood and weight - related health behaviors [ 11 ] .
results showed several significant associations with neighborhood and weight control behaviors for food and physical activity .
in this manuscript , we evaluated the association between neighborhood poverty and the expanded outcomes of individual - level health status and depression .
methods study population of the parent study the primary objective of the look ahead ( action for health in diabetes ) study [ 12,13 ] is to examine , in overweight volunteers with type 2 diabetes , the long - term effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention program designed to achieve and maintain weight loss by decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity .
the intervention group is compared to a control condition involving a program of diabetes education and support .
the primary basis for the comparison is the incidence of serious cardiovascular events .
other outcomes , including cardiovascular disease risk factors , diabetes - related metabolic factors and complications , and the cost - effectiveness of the intensive intervention are also studied .
participants are 5,145 volunteers with type 2 diabetes who are 45 - 75 years of age and overweight or obese ( body mass index [ bmi ] >= 25 kg / m2 ) .
study population of the ancillary study this ancillary study was conducted using baseline ( before the intervention ) data from look ahead participants at 4 clinical sites ; baltimore ( n = 302 ) , philadelphia ( n = 293 ) , pittsburgh ( n = 321 ) , and new york ( n = 303 ) .
sites were chosen because of their close geographic proximity relative to all of the look ahead clinical sites and similar demographic profile ( predominately white and african - american ) .
the total study sample for this ancillary consists of 1010 participants with complete data on neighborhood environment and other key variables .
addresses were used to identify the corresponding census tracts for each participant ( neighborhood ) as defined by the 2000 us census using a process called geocoding and software program arcgis ( tm ) .
the program matches imported addresses to geographic maps and other geographic data .
matches are rated with scores from 0 ( no match ) to 100 ( perfect match ) ; we accepted matches with 80 % certainty or more .
once we identified the census tracts and corresponding data for each participant , these data were linked to the individual - level participant data collected during the look ahead trial .
main data sources data are derived from the 2000 us census long form and include demographic characteristics ( age , race , sex ) , housing characteristics ( housing structure , number of rooms ) , economic characteristics ( occupation , place of work and journey to work ) and financial characteristics ( value of home , rent , utilities cost ) for each census tract .
participants in the look ahead study underwent extensive data collection at baseline , including interview , physical examination , and blood and urine assays [ 12 ] .
although the trial will last over 10 years , this manuscript is restricted to data collected at baseline only .
the look ahead trial was approved by the johns hopkins school of medicine institutional review board .
key independent variables using the census data , indices of neighborhood socio - economic status ( ses ) developed by diez - roux and winkleby / cubbin were created using variables such as the % of persons living below poverty , % of adults with a college degree , median household income , % of persons earning interest income , % of adults in executive / managerial occupations , and % of adults who are unemployed .
to produce comparable data for the diez - roux and cubbin indices used in previous studies [ 14 - 16 ] , we presented them along with the single item "% of individuals in the census tract living below the federal poverty line " because this measure is highly correlated with other census - based indices and has been shown to be similarly predictive of health outcomes [ 16 ] .
covariates were individual - level socio - demographic characteristics : sex , age in years , education in years , race ( black , white , hispanic or other ) , and categories of yearly , personal income .
body mass index ( bmi ) was presented to show that , per look ahead eligibility criteria , all participants were overweight or obese .
key dependent variables the medical outcomes study ( mos ) short form - 36 health survey ( sf - 36 ) , a multidimensional scale of health status designed for self or interviewer administration was used to measure health status [ 17,18 ] .
the sf - 36 has demonstrated reliability and validity and is widely used in health outcomes research [ 19 ] .
the sf - 36 measures 8 health domains : 1 ) physical functioning , 2 ) role limitations because of physical health problems , 3 ) bodily pain , 4 ) social functioning , 5 ) general mental health ( psychological distress and psychological well - being , 6 ) role limitations because of emotional problems , 7 ) vitality ( energy / fatigue ) , and 8 ) general health perceptions .
sf - 36 responses were recorded on 5 - point scales .
scores for each health domain scale range from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better functioning or well being .
composite scores for global , physical , and mental health were also calculated [ 19 ] .
depressive symptoms were measured using the beck depression inventory [ 20 ] ; higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms .
statistical analysis in this analysis , the main independent variables were the neighborhood factors and the main dependent variables were individual - level depression and health status from the look ahead study .
descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population .
multi - level linear models were used to analyze the aggregate and individual level data [ 21 - 23 ] .
recognizing that when studying group - level variables , individuals are nested within those groups , multi - level analyses are designed to account for this clustering .
in the current study , intercept terms were allowed to vary for each cluster ( random effect ) while all other variables were considered as fixed effects .
multilevel models were used specifying census tract as the cluster variable .
they were fit first with the neighborhood level factor (% poverty ) as the independent variable and individual - level depression and health status as outcome variables in separate models .
subsequently , individual - level ses ( personal yearly income and education ) were added while also controlling for potential confounders ( age , sex , race ) .
this enabled us to determine the independent contribution of neighborhood ses entered into the models as tertiles and beta coefficients comparing the highest tertiles ( most poverty ) to the lowest tertile ( least poverty ) are shown in the table .
we also examined if neighborhood was associated with weight and a number of other clinical variables ( including glycemic control ) .
since this ancillary study was set within a randomized controlled trial at baseline , the participants had similar health profiles at the beginning of the study and most of those associations were not significant .
therefore , we did not feel that it was appropriate to adjust for these variables in the analysis .
all analyses were conducted using stata statistical software , version 10 .

when evaluating sf - 36 composite scores ( table 2 ) , those living in neighborhoods with more poverty had significantly lower scores on the physical health ( beta - coefficient [ beta ] = - 1.90 units , 95 % ci : - 3.40 , - 0.039 ) , mental health ( beta = - 2.92 units , - 4.31 , - 1.53 ) and global health ( beta = - 2.77 units , - 4.21 , - 1.33 ) composite scores .
likewise , those in neighborhoods with more poverty had higher scores ( indicating worse symptoms ) on the beck depression inventory ( beta = 0.68 units , - 0.12 , 1.48 ) , although this finding was not statistically significant .
no significant differences were shown for those in the middle tertile of poverty compared to the lowest for health status or depression .
although the associations between the cubbin and diez - roux neighborhood scores and health status were in the hypothesized direction , few were statistically significant .

these conclusions are supported by results from this study that included a diverse range of neighborhoods , detailed individual - level data , and a large percentage of minority participants .
there were , however , a few limitations .
first , using the census tract as a proxy for neighborhood has been criticized , however , many studies have used this indicator , allowing us to compare our findings across studies .
furthermore , the wealth of data available from the us census provides a comprehensive view of this geographic entity .
similarly , the neighborhood data may not have represented the entire baseline time - period for the look ahead study .
data used were from the 2000 census and 2004 consumer database ; look ahead participants were recruited from 2001 - 2004 .
neighborhoods are constantly changing , however the time - frame for the data used was close to the study recruitment period .
second , given the eligibility criteria for entry into the study , the population was fairly homogeneous with respect to some factors .
one example was weight and clinical variables such as glycemic control , which had little variation by neighborhood .
in a future study , we plan to conduct longitudinal analyses and determine how neighborhood influences response to the weight loss intervention .
the longitudinal analyses should show more variation in the dependent variables as individuals respond differently to the intervention .
conclusion this study supports the previous literature and gives more evidence for a consistent association between neighborhood poverty and its association with poorer mental health outcomes .
moreover , it gives weight to a strong association when using an objective measure of neighborhood ses which supports the prior studies that focused mostly on perceived measures of neighborhood .
furthermore , this study was conducted in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes .
persons with diabetes are known to have higher rates of depression [ 9,10,24 ] , and understanding how other factors influence depression in this population will ultimately contribute to strategies for prevention .
two recent systematic review articles summarized the state of the literature on neighborhood and mental health , particularly in relation to depression or depressive symptoms [ 25,26 ] .
although the consistent theme was that few studies attempted to quantify potential mechanisms , many different pathways and mediating variables were hypothesized .
for example , kim and colleagues outlined a conceptual framework that considered several pathways as potential mediators including : 1 ) physical health as a result of environmental hazards , 2 ) health behaviors that may be inhibited by features of the physical environment , 3 ) psychosocial stress as a result of neighborhood disorder and crime , and 4 ) resources and social capital that might be lacking as a result of suboptimal social environment [ 26,27 ] .
mair and colleagues support these hypotheses and suggest that developing more theory on these process features and empirically testing them is fundamental to strengthening causal inference [ 25 ] .
consequently , future studies should pay careful attention to these mechanisms order to identify areas for intervention .
a recent qualitative assessment using concept mapping has begun this process [ 1 ] and should provide the foundation for further development .

background parainfluenza virus type 3 ( piv3 ) was isolated from dairy buffaloes ( bubalus bubalis ) naturally affected with respiratory and reproductive clinical conditions .
results examination of nasal and vaginal swabs collected from 12 diseased buffaloes led to the isolation of three paramyxovirus isolates from two animals .
antigenic , morphological and biological characteristics of these three isolates were essentially similar to those of members of the paramyxoviridae family .
antigenic analysis by direct immunofluorescence and cross neutralization test placed these isolates together with bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 ( bpiv3 ) .
nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic analysis of partial matrix gene sequences of the buffalo isolates and six field bpiv3 isolates from bovines in argentina were studied .
buffalo isolates were similar to genotype b ( bpiv3b ) while the six bpiv3 isolates were similar to genotypes a ( bpiv3a ) and c ( bpiv3c ) .
conclusions this is the first characterization of bpiv3 in water buffalo .
according to the samples analyzed , in argentina , the genotype b was found in buffalo and the genotypes a and c were found in cattle .
background paramyxoviruses are well - known pathogens of the central nervous and respiratory systems of many host species .
in the last few decades , many novel paramyxoviruses have emerged causing devastating illnesses in different aquatic and terrestrial animals , including in some cases a species jump to humans [ 1 ] .
parainfluenza virus type 3 ( piv3 ) is an enveloped , single - stranded negative sense rna virus within the respirovirus genus of the paramyxoviridae family [ 2,3 ] .
the respirovirus genus includes human parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 ( hpiv1 and hpiv3 , respectively ) , sendai virus ( murine piv1 ) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 ( bpiv3 ) [ 2 ] .
in some instances when animals are subjected to high stressful conditions , infection with bpiv3 can contribute to tissue damage and immunosuppression , resulting in severe bronchopneumonia from secondary bacterial infections [ 4 ] .
the resulting disease is part of the bovine respiratory disease complex ( brdc ) and is considered as the most significant illness associated with feedlot cattle in the usa [ 5 ] , and possibly worldwide .
other respiratory viruses such as bovine herpesvirus 1 , bovine viral diarrhea virus ( bvdv ) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus ( brsv ) have also been associated with brdc development in feedlot cattle [ 6 ] .
the clinical presentation of bovine infections with bpiv3 can vary considerably , ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illness .
in most cases where bpiv3 is implicated in disease , usual clinical signs include coughing , fever and nasal discharge [ 6 ] .
three genotypes , a ( bpiv3a ) , b ( bpiv3b ) and c ( bpiv3c ) have been described , based on genetic and phylogenetic analysis [ 7 ] .
the bpiv3b genotype could hypothetically be a lineage from a strain that recently crossed from another host species into cattle [ 8 ] .
piv3 infections were found in a wide variety of mammals including cattle , humans , sheep [ 9 ] , goats [ 10 ] , bison [ 11 ] , guinea pigs [ 12 ] , black and white rhinoceros [ 13 ] , moose [ 14 ] , bighorn sheep [ 15 ] and camels [ 16 ] .
cross - species infections have been reported in numerous instances , including hpiv - 3 in guinea pigs [ 12 ] , bpiv3 in a human , bpiv3 in sheep , and ovine piv3 in cattle [ 17 ] .
in argentina , serological studies conducted in 1980 and 1984 showed a high incidence of antibodies against bpiv3 ( 77 %) in cattle from the main livestock breeding regions [ 18,19 ] .
in addition , positive serology was reported in domestic and wild south american camelids [ 20 - 22 ] and the virus was isolated from cattle and sheep [ 23 ] .
however , little is known about the circulation of bpiv3 in cattle and other ruminants in argentina , as well as about the genotypes that are present in this southern american country .
production systems have evolved to mixed managements , where alternative production species , such as the water buffalo ( bubalus bubalis ) , coexist in the same habitat as with cattle .
water buffalo breeding represents an important economic alternative in argentina , which allows access to national and international markets .
this species is susceptible to several viral infections [ 20,24,25 ] including bpiv3 as reported in a very early in 1966 in egypt [ 26 ] .
in addition to its potential relevance with respect to water buffalo health , this finding bears epidemiological significance due to the risk of transmission of the virus to cattle .
the aim of this study was to characterize antigenically and genetically bpiv3 isolates from a respiratory and reproductive syndrome outbreak in dairy buffaloes and compare the buffalo isolate with contemporaneous bpiv3 circulating in cattle .
results morphological and biological properties of buffalo viral isolates piv3 was successfully isolated from two out of twelve water buffaloes studied , in one case from both nasal ( 7 n ) and vaginal ( 7 v ) swabs , and in the other only from the vaginal swab ( 2 v ) .
isolates produced characteristic cytopathic effects ( cpe ) on mdbk cells , similar to those of the bpiv3 reference strain , with many scattered , rounded , refractory cells and small syncytia .
cpe were first visualized on the second passage , after three days post inoculation ( dpi ) , and cpe were observed at day 4 or 5 dpi .
both bovine polyclonal anti - bpiv3 serum and fitc - anti - bpiv3 igg reacted with the cells infected by these isolates ( figure 1 a ) .

b : electron micrograph of two purified virions of the 7 n isolate , morphologically indistinguishable from paramixoviruses .
transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical to pleomorphic virions , approximately 100 - 300 nm in diameter , which were morphologically indistinguishable from paramyxoviruses .
intact virions were enveloped and densely packed , as has been described for bpiv3 .
nucleocapsids were visible and exhibited a typical " herringbone " pattern ( figure 1 b ) .
the three isolates ( 7 n , 7 v and 2 v ) were able to agglutinate red blood cells ( rbcs ) , with uha titers of 16 , 8 and 4 respectively .
the agglutinated rbcs eluted after 1 h suggesting neuraminidase function / activity .
the hi test showed 58 % of positive reactions , with titers ranging between 1.6 and 2.5 ( data not shown ) .
molecular characterization rt - pcr and sequencing a fragment of the m gene , consistent with the expected size of 328 bp was amplified from the 3 virus isolates ( 7 n , 7 v and 2 v ) by rt - pcr .
as expected , the primer pairs did not amplify using genomic material of brsv as template .
analysis of the alignments of 271 pb of the corresponding sequences revealed that they are related to bpiv3 strain q5592 from australia with 94 % nucleotide identity ( figure 2 ) and 100 % predicted amino acid identity ( table 1 ) .

data and phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic analysis of the m gene fragment of the three argentinean buffalo isolates ( 7 n , 7 v and 2 v ) together with other paramyxoviruses , placed the buffalo isolates in the same clade as bpiv3 ( figure 3 ) .

phylogenetic analysis was performed using mega 4 software with 1,000 bootstrap replicates .

the argentinean isolates are indicated in bold .
genbank accession numbers are presented in materials and methods .
in particular , the isolates grouped with the bpiv3b genotype represented in the tree by an australian isolate ( q5592 ) .
bpiv3b is distinct from the previously characterized members of bpiv3 represented by genotypes a and c. in order to determine whether the piv3 genotype found in buffalo is also circulating in cattle , the same gene fragment was amplified by rt - pcr using as template bpiv3 rna isolated from six bovines of the buenos aires region .
three of the six isolates show 98 % nucleotide identity and 100 % amino acid identity with bpiv3c ( sd0835 strain ) reference isolate , and the remaining three , 99 % nucleotide identity and 100 % amino acid identity with bpiv3a ( sf strain ) reference isolate ( table 1 ) .
phylogenetic characterization showed that the bovine isolates belong to the bpiv3a and bpiv3c genotypes , which have been reported so far in north america , europe and china ( figure 3 ) .
serum neutralization test buffalo sera ( n = 24 ) were analyzed by cross - neutralization , three were negative for both viruses , bpiv3a and b , 9 showed higher titers against bpiv3b isolated from buffalo , 4 showed higher titers against bpiv3a and the remaining 11 had same titers for both viruses .
( table 2 ) .
in general , sera from buffaloes showed higher antibody titers against the isolated buffalo virus than against the reference virus .

each cell contains the number of animals with the antibody titers against each virus .
discussion in the present study , we describe the isolation of bpiv3 from two water buffaloes with respiratory and reproductive signs .
the virus was isolated from nasal and vaginal swabs from two out of twelve animals with reproductive and respiratory signs studied .
to our knowledge little is known about the pathogenesis of this virus in buffalo .
should there be a syndrome similar to that present in cattle where the virus is transiently excreted [ 27 ] , the unsuccessful virus isolation from the then remaining symptomatic animals could be related to the time point of sampling , which could have taken place at the end of the acute infection .
the if assay showed strong and specific binding of anti - bpiv3 antibodies to cells infected with these three positive clinical isolates .
sera from buffaloes were able to neutralize the activity of the 7 n , 7 v and 2 v isolates and that of the reference bovine virus ( bpiv3 strain sf ) , but the neutralization titers against the latter were lower than against buffalo isolates , suggesting antigenic differences .
the sequence of the m amplified fragment showed 94 % nucleotide identity between buffalo isolates and bpiv3b strain q5592 from australia [ 8 ] .
this is the first report of molecular characterization of a bpiv3 isolated from buffaloes .
in order to determine homology between piv3 isolates from argentinean bovine and buffaloes , we characterized retrospectively six isolates collected from bovine respiratory outbreaks that occurred in 2009 and 2011 .
these isolates showed high percentages of nucleotide and amino acid identity with a and c genotypes ( table 1 ) .
there are only few reports about bpiv3 circulation in argentina , epstein et al described the isolation , virological and physicochemical characterization of piv3 from argentinean cattle and sheep in 1974 [ 23 ] .
however , phylogenetic studies of these isolates were not carried out .
phylogenetic reconstructions based on the alignment of the m - gene nucleotide sequences demonstrated that the 7 n , 7 v and 2 v isolates clustered in the b genotype group .
so far , this genotype has only been previously reported in australia [ 8 ] .
the phylogenetic position of the argentinean buffalo isolates might be correlated with the antigenic differences observed by cross - neutralization studies , where the reference strain belonging to the bpiv3a group was lesser neutralized than the buffalo viral isolates by sera of buffaloes .
therefore the serological and molecular characterization of buffalo bpvi3 isolates show that these viruses are more similar to b than to a ( sf reference strain ) and c bpvi3 genotypes ( sd0835 reference strain ) .
interestingly , the genotype b isolated from buffaloes was not found among the bovine samples , analyzed in this work , that clustered with genotypes a and c. genotype b was until now observed only in australia with the hypothesis of a recent crossing from another species into cattle [ 8 ] .
this evidence of genotype b in buffaloes should need further investigation to know if this species could be one of the host species of this genotype .
therefore analysis of a larger number of isolates from cattle and buffaloes is needed to determine whether the three genotypes circulate in both species , or if the distribution observed is representative .
importantly , this is the first report of bovine b and c genotype circulation out of australia and china , respectively .
the circulation of genotype c only in china was attributed to a geographic restriction [ 7 ] .
this hypothesis can be ruled out by our results and this observation was most likely due to the relative frequencies of these genotypes with respect to the samples analyzed .
to our knowledge this is the first report of the isolation of a parainfluenza virus type 3 from vaginal secretions .
however , it is important to highlight that the presence of the virus in the secretions could be due to oro - genital contact between animals .
evidence of viral replication in the genital mucosa needs new investigations .
conclusion the isolation and characterization of bpiv3 from water buffaloes were reported .
we identified the isolates as bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 genotype b that differs from genotypes a and c circulating in argentinean cattle herds reported so far .
further studies would be required to determine if a and c genotypes also circulate in buffalo herds , as well as to elucidate the role of buffalo as reservoirs , especially of the b genotype , and in the transmission of this virus to cattle .
methods samples nasal and vaginal swabs were obtained from 12 water buffaloes of a dairy farm in the argentinean province of chaco , during an outbreak of respiratory and reproductive disease in july 2009 .
these animals had white stringy mucus in the nose and vulva .
these samples were inoculated on madin darby bovine kidney ( mdbk ) cell cultures .
the sf strain of bpiv3 was used as reference .
cells were daily examined under optical microscope to observe the appearance of cytopathic effects .
bovine isolates were obtained from cattle with respiratory syndromes , 5 of them in the year 2009 and the remaining isolate in 2011 .
they were collected and amplified from azul laboratories ( azul - buenos aires province ) from outbreaks of buenos aires province .
immunofluorescence test virus isolates were inoculated into confluent mdbk cells in 8 - well chambers at a moi of 1.0 , 0.1 , and 0.01 .
for direct if test , cells with cytopathic effects were fixed with 99.5 % acetone and then incubated with fitc anti - bpvi3 igg ( ames ) .
for indirect if , cells were incubated with antibovine piv3 polyclonal antibody ( nvsl ) diluted 1:100 in pbs at 37 degreesc in a moist environment for 1 h. then , cells were incubated with fitc antibovine igg ( kpl ) .
in both cases , slides were layered with buffered glycerin and observed under epifluorescence in an olympus bx 40 + h hal microscope .
transmission electron microscopy twenty - five mul of viral suspension ( 16 hau ) were placed on a collodion membrane supported on a copper grid , negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid , and observed with a jeol 1200 ex ii transmission electron microscope [ 28 ] .
hemagglutination assay ( ha ) and haemagglutination inhibition assay ( hia ) serial two - fold dilutions of culture supernatants from infected mdbk ( 50 ul ) were titrated against 50 ul guinea pig erythrocytes in v - bottom microtiter plates ( nunc ) .
after incubation at 4degreesc for 4 h , hemagglutination was evaluated by the appearance or absence of a red cell button .
results were expressed as hemagglutinating units / 50 mul ( hau / 50 mul ) .
the last dilution at which hemagglutination was observed was taken as the endpoint of the hemagglutinating activity .
the reciprocal of this dilution expresses the number of hemagglutinating units or virus titer in uha .
for the hi assay serial two - fold dilutions of sera from buffaloes were allowed to react with a fixed dose of reference viral haemagglutinin ( 8 uha ) , followed by the addition of guinea pig agglutinable erythrocytes .
titers were expressed as the log10 of the reciprocal of the highest dilution hemagglutination inhibitory multiplied by a constant factor of 8 .
rt - pcr and sequencing infected mdbk cells were scraped off the plates and homogenized by three cycles of freezing and thawing .
after an initial centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 min , polyethylene glycol 8000 ( sigma ) , 10 % ( w / v , final concentration ) was added to the cell lysates , followed by incubation for 4 h at 4degreesc .
the virus was pelleted at 12,000 g for 60 min at 4degreesc .
viral genomic rna was extracted from the virus pellet using rneasy mini kit ( qiagen ) .
oligonucleotide primers for bpiv3 detection and identification ( mfwd : 5'agtgatctagatgatgatcca 3 ' nt - 3960 and mrev : 5'gttattgatccaattgctgt - 3 ' nt - 4288 ) were designed based on a 328 bp segment of the consensus bpiv3 matrix ( m ) gene .
cdna was synthesized using the specific oligonucleotide primer ( mfw ) and mmlv reverse transcriptase ( promega ) .
subsequently , go taq dna polymerase ( promega ) was used to amplify the m gene fragment .
mfw and mrev primers were tested for specificity by rt - pcr on brsv ( bovine respiratory syncytial virus ) rna , giving negative results .
pcr products were purified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen ) .
sequencing reactions were performed twice in both directions with bigdye terminator v3.0 kit ( applied biosystems , lennik , belgium ) and analyzed with abi prism 3730 dna analyzer ( applied biosystems ) .
phylogenetic analysis m fragment nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of buffalo isolates were edited and analyzed with bioedit version 7.0.5.3 [ 29 ] .
alignments of these sequences together with other from representative isolates of previously identified bpiv3 and human parainfluenza virus type 3 ( hpiv3 ) were created by clustal w. nucleotide sequence alignments of the m gene fragment were used for phylogenetic analyses using mega software , version 4 [ 30 ] .
phylogenetic relationships were investigated by bootstrap analysis ( 1000 replicates ) using the neighbor joining method with the kimura two - parameter model for nucleotide data analysis .
genbank accession numbers of the sequences used in the phylogenetic tree are as follows : bpiv3 reference strains : bpiv3 strain kansas / 15626 / 84 , d84095 ; bpiv3 strain , nc 002161 , af178654 ; sf strain af178655 ; q5592 , eu277658 ; sd0835 , hq530153 ; bpi3 jcu strain , ef 108221 ; bp4158 stain ef 108222 ; bp4159 strain , ef 108223 ; bp6121 strain , ef 108224 ; bp6128 strain , ef 108225 ; bp7393 , eu266069 ; isu92 , eu439428 ; texas - 81 , eu439429 and hpiv3 reference strains : hpiv strains , m16458 , m16569 ; hpiv3 - gpv strain , nc 001796 and 14702 strain , eu424062 .
sendai virus ( ab005795 ) as outgroup .
serum neutralization test cross - neutralization tests were performed in mdbk 96 - well plates , by overnight incubation of 200 tcid50 on 50 ul of 7 n buffalo virus isolates or bpiv3 reference strain ( sf ) with 50 ul heat - inactivated two - fold diluted sera .
the plate was incubated for 5 days at 37 degreesc , under 5 % co2 , and then screened for the presence or absence of cytopathic effects under optical microscope ( 400x magnification ) to determine the virus - neutralization titers .
neutralization titers were calculated as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the last serum dilution with clear cytopathic effects .

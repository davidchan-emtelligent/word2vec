national heatwave plans are aimed at reducing the avoidable human health consequences due to heatwaves , by providing warnings as well as improving communication between relevant stakeholders .
the objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of key stakeholders within plans in belgium and the netherlands on their responsibilities , the partnerships , and the effectiveness of the local implementation in brussels and amsterdam .
key informant interviews were held with stakeholders that had an important role in development of the heatwave plan in these countries , or its implementation in brussels or amsterdam .
care organisations , including hospitals and elderly care organisations , had a lack of familiarity with the national heatwave plan in both cities , and prioritised heat the lowest .
some groups of individuals , specifically socially isolated individuals , are not sufficiently addressed by the current national heatwave plans and most local plans .
stakeholders reported that responsibilities were not clearly described and that the national plan does not describe tasks on a local level .
we recommend to urgently increase awareness on the impact of heat on health among care organisations .
more emphasis needs to be given to the variety of heat - risk groups .
stakeholders should be involved in the development of updates of the plans .
heatwaves health protection perception key informant interviews 1 .
introduction the effects of heatwaves on health in europe have been investigated in a number of studies .
an increase in mortality and years of life lost in european cities during the nineties has been observed , even after adjusting for the harvesting effect [ 1 ] .
a main risk group for mortality consists of elderly people [ 2 ] .
although there is little evidence that directly describes the impact of heat on socially isolated individuals , including homeless people , they are considered a risk group due to the lack of social control and a relatively high proportion of morbidities .
it was estimated that , due to the very severe heatwave in 2003 in western europe , between 1400 and 2200 individuals died in the netherlands [ 3 ] , and more than 70,000 in europe [ 4 ] .
apart from mortality , heatwaves have a considerable impact on morbidity .
mastrangelo et al. reported an increase in respiratory diseases and heat diseases during heatwaves , but no increase in circulatory diseases [ 5 ] .
amongst the elderly , an increase in heat - related symptoms , such as fatigue , sleep disturbance and annoyance due to heat , was shown in a recent study by van loenhout et al. as a consequence of increasing indoor temperatures [ 6 ] .
due to climate change , there is an expected increase in heatwaves in western europe , both in frequency and intensity [ 7 ] .
the severe heatwave that hit europe in 2003 prompted many countries to implement heatwave early warning systems with response plans [ 8 ] .
these heatwave plans usually feature timely accurate warnings , tailored communications and notifications of adaptation actions to the most vulnerable populations and heat avoidance advice to general populations [ 9 ] .
the main aim of the heatwave plans is to reduce the avoidable public health consequences of heatwaves .
a study in the florentine area ( italy ) showed a general reduction in heat - related mortality from the four years before 2003 to the four years after 2003 in elderly (>= 75 years ) people [ 10 ] .
in addition , a french study showed that mortality during a 2006 heatwave was lower than predicted by a model , which could partially be due to the introduction of a heat warning system [ 11 ] .
a systematic review from 2014 looked at studies that assessed the impact of heat prevention plans and climate adaptation strategies , and found a reduction of adverse effects during extreme heat in places where preventive measures have been implemented [ 12 ] .
in contrast , a recent study on heat - related mortality in nine european cities before and after the 2003 heatwave showed that improvement in adaptation was achieved by only a third of these cities , and two of these worsened their adaptation capacity while the other one remained unchanged [ 13 ] .
both belgium and the netherlands have developed national plans in 2005 and 2007 , respectively , as public health measures against heatwaves [ 6,14 ] .
in the belgian region of wallonia , a recent survey assessed the familiarity of stakeholders and end users with protection and adaptation measures to heat .
however , no specific assessment of local implementation was undertaken [ 15 ] .
since the successful implementation of a national heatwave plan locally depends largely on the participation and collaboration of relevant stakeholders , we interviewed key informants from those organisations with the aim of assessing their perceptions on the heatwave plans in terms of responsibilities , partnerships , and effectiveness of the local implementation in brussels and amsterdam .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
desk evaluation of national heatwave plans a desk evaluation was performed on the national heatwave plans in belgium and the netherlands in december 2014 .
we evaluated whether the plans have described ( i ) main collaborating partners ; ( ii ) different levels of alert ; and ( iii ) stakeholders and responsibilities .
for the topics that were included in the plans , we described the level of detail .
2.2 .
key informant interviews we decided to focus on stakeholders who had important roles in the development of the national heatwave plan in belgium or the netherlands , or its implementation in brussels or amsterdam .
these cities were selected as major metropoles of belgium and the netherlands , respectively , where the effects of heatwaves are stronger due to the urban heat island effect [ 16 ] .
in both countries , we contacted representatives at the following stakeholder organisations : national institutes of public health , regional health and environment agencies , municipalities , the red cross , elderly and homecare organisations , hospitals , overarching childcare centre networks , and circles of general practitioners .
key informants were identified through networks of the researchers , snowballing and internet searches .
the aim was to interview stakeholders from each of three categories in each country , representing the hierarchical and communication organisation , which we defined as : ( i ) activators , or those stakeholders who were ( co - ) responsible for developing and setting up the national heatwave plan in their country ; ( ii ) intermediaries , as those responsible for rolling out information from the activators to a ( large ) group of care providers and end users ; and ( iii ) care providers , those organisations or professionals directly responsible for health of risk groups with respect to heat .
stakeholders were contacted by email with a short explanation about the study , and the request to participate in an interview .
non - responders received a single reminder after 2 - 3 weeks , also by email .
an interview format was designed , containing the topics and questions for the key informant interviews ( appendix a ) .
interviews in the netherlands were held in dutch , and they were carried out between december 2013 and february 2014 .
in belgium , interviews were conducted in dutch or french , depending on the stakeholder 's language proficiency or preference , between march 2015 and may 2016 .
interviews were not recorded to create a more informal interview situation .
instead , written notes were taken during the interview , and a written report was sent to the stakeholders afterwards for approval .
for stakeholders who felt little affinity with the topic of heat and health and who did not see the need to participate in an interview , but still wanted to provide some input , a shortened version of the interview was administered via email .
thematic analysis was used to examine the data obtained in this study [ 17 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
desk evaluation of national heatwave plans national heatwave plans for belgium and the netherlands were found on websites of the respective national governments [ 14,18 ] .
the belgian national heatwave plan is developed by the federal public service for health , food chain safety and environment ( fod ) .
it is available in french as well as dutch .
main collaborating partners that are described in the plan are the national meteorological institute ( kmi ) , the belgian interregional environment agency ( irceline ) and the belgian regional governments ( flanders , wallonia and brussels ) .
the heatwave plan is aimed at heatwaves as well as ozone , although the focus of our study was heatwaves .
the plan contains information on heat - related health effects and their treatment , risk groups and aggravating factors .
risk groups for heat that are mentioned in the plan are young children , elderly , socially isolated individuals and persons who perform heavy physical exercise .
in addition , different upscaling phases are described , as well as actions that will be taken during those phases ( table 1 ) .
the dutch national heatwave plan is developed by the national institute for public health and the environment ( rivm ) , in collaboration with the ministry of health , welfare and sport ( vws ) , the royal dutch meteorological institute ( knmi ) , the overarching organisation for regional public health institutes ( ggd the netherlands ) , the overarching organisation for healthcare institutes ( actiz ) and the dutch red cross ( nrk ) .
the plan is available in dutch and contains information on risk groups and situations , heat - related health effects , recommendations to prevent heat stress and communication strategies towards vulnerable groups .
risk groups for heat that are mentioned in the plan are elderly people living in care organisations , the chronically ill , socially isolated individuals , overweight people and children .
also , it describes stakeholders and their role in the plan , as well as different upscaling phases ( table 1 ) .
the dutch national heatwave plan seems more comprehensive than the belgian plan .
sections that appear only in the dutch plan are recommendations to prevent heat stress and communication strategies .
in addition , the intended tasks of all stakeholders , also specifically during each of the upscaling phases , are described in the dutch plan , but not in the belgian plan ( table 2 ) .
the levels of alert and the criteria for activation differ between the two countries , since the two national heatwave plans were created independently from each other .
3.2 .
key informant interviews in the netherlands , we were able to plan interviews with two activators of the national heatwave plan : the national institute for public health and the environment ( rivm ) , and the dutch red cross ( drc ) .
intermediary organisations in amsterdam that collaborated were the municipal health service amsterdam ( mhsa ) and the municipality of amsterdam ( moa ) .
we contacted the biggest organisation on elderly care in amsterdam , cordaan , and they agreed to an interview as well .
the biggest tertiary hospital in amsterdam , the academic medical centre ( amc ) answered some of our questions by email , but did not participate in an interview .
the total number of positive responses was six ( table 3 ) .
in belgium , we were able to carry out interviews with several activators of the national heatwave plan , namely the fod public health , food safety and environment ( fod ) , public service wallonia ( psw ) , and leefmilieu brussels ( lb ) .
intermediary stakeholders whom we interviewed were from red cross brussels ( rcb ) and two municipalities within the brussels capital region , namely etterbeek ( moe ) and saint - gilles ( mos - g ) .
a big homecare organisation in brussels , familiehulp , did not want to participate in an interview but answered some of our questions by email .
the total number of positive responses was seven ( table 4 ) .
overall , it is noteworthy that most non - responding organisations belonged to the category of care providers ( e.g. , general practitioners , childcare centres ) .
3.2.1 .
familiarity with the national heatwave plans we found that the three care organisations that participated in our study were not familiar with the existence of the national heatwave plan , both in brussels and amsterdam. with the exception of those , all other organisations were aware of the plan , although not always of the exact content ( table 3 and table 4 ) .
3.2.2 .
involvement in national heatwave plan development from the data collected , we detected that the national heatwave plans were developed without involvement of local organisations , including government , health and social care ( table 3 and table 4 ) .
3.2.3 .
heat as a public health priority perception on heat as a priority for public health was observed as varying largely across stakeholders ( table 3 and table 4 ) .
heatwaves were considered by some stakeholders to be a lower priority than other public health risks , such as air pollution ( mos - g ) and infectious diseases ( cordaan ) ; heatwaves have a seasonal pattern of presentation and a low probability of occurrence ( fod ) ; and that sufficient measures to cope with heatwaves were already in place ( rivm ) .
on the other hand , reasons for placing heat as a high priority were that measures against heat are cost - effective and require a low investment ( drc ) ; the likelihood of more frequent and severe heatwaves will increase due to trends in climate change ( mhsa ) and urbanisation ( moa ) ; a direct increase in mortality can be observed during heatwaves ( moe ) ; and heatwaves are perceived as more important than other public health issues , such as ozone ( lb , rcb ) .
overall , care organisations did not give high priority to heat as a public health issue .
3.2.4 .
involvement in warning at - risk populations one observation was that some of the organisations directly involved in caring for heat - risk groups ( cordaan , familiehulp ) reported few or no activities aiming at warning these groups on the risks of heat .
we also observed that , although a detailed description on all risk groups is available within national heatwave plans , some municipalities do not focus on all of them .
3.2.5 .
success in reaching the at - risk populations perceived reasons were varied .
some stakeholders found the plan reached the at - risk population adequately due to a high level of media attention ( rivm ) and others concurred that televised information adequately reaches targeted groups ( fod , rcb ) .
moreover , some stakeholders received positive feedback from regional public health organisations ( rivm ) and citizens ( mos - g ) .
in contrast , others felt that there is limited awareness from informants and risk groups on the topic of heat ( drc , moe ) , and that the list of stakeholders involved in the care of risk groups was incomplete ( lb ) .
homeless people did not fall under the responsibility of the municipality and were therefore excluded in municipal actions ( fod ) .
the effectiveness of warning at - risk populations was not evaluated , according to a stakeholder interview ( mhsa ) .
3.2.6 .
responsibilities described in national heatwave plan dutch stakeholders reported overall that responsibilities were not clearly described and that the plan is non - committal .
however , an updated version of the plan would be implemented in 2015 , which would put more emphasis on describing tasks of different stakeholders .
similar results were found for belgium , where most stakeholders felt that the national plan does not describe tasks on a local level .
3.2.7 .
collaboration between stakeholders we observed a clear trend in our results , suggesting that stakeholders on a higher level ( i.e. , activators ) had a much more positive perception towards the quality of collaborations compared to intermediaries , which in turn were more positive than care organisations , the more local level of stakeholders considered in our study .
this pattern was consistent across both study countries .
one stakeholder pointed out that the quality of collaborations may suffer from the lack of sufficient budgets ( moe ) .
3.2.8 .
strengths and weaknesses of the national heatwave plan one strength consistently reported about the dutch national heatwave plan was the inclusion of a description on relevant stakeholders .
both national heatwave plans were considered to offer a good evidence base on the links between heat and health .
especially for belgium , stakeholders felt that the description of roles and responsibilities in the plan was not optimal .
all care organisations reported lack of awareness with the plan as an issue ( figure 1 ) .
4. discussion the most striking finding was the mismatch between the intended and the actual familiarity with the national heatwave plans among the care organisations under study .
even though elderly care institutes , homecare organisations and hospitals were listed in the national heatwave plans of both countries , representatives from these organisations were not aware of the existence of the plan , and did not receive alerts during a hot period .
additionally , among all respondents , care organisations gave the lowest priority to heatwaves .
both findings are consistent with a uk study , where a large majority of care organisations in london were not familiar with the national heatwave plan , even though these organisations were specifically mentioned in the heatwave plan for england [ 19 ] , and the majority of these respondents did not regard heatwaves as high priority [ 20 ] .
a study among care institutions in amsterdam , which showed that less than 10 % of the residents' rooms in these institutions had air conditioning , suggests that heat is not considered an important factor for the health of this vulnerable population [ 21 ] .
as care organisations have the closest contact with at - risk populations out of all the stakeholders , this low priority brings about a dilemma .
based on our findings , awareness of the impact of heat on health among stakeholders working in these types of organisations should be urgently addressed .
it became apparent that several risk groups for heat are not sufficiently addressed by the national heatwave plans .
homeless people in the netherlands fall under the responsibility of the municipality , but in belgium there is no governmental organisation responsible for them .
however , homeless people are a risk group due to them having poorly controlled chronic diseases , respiratory diseases and mental illnesses , which render them vulnerable [ 22 ] .
one stakeholder pointed out that individuals with little social contact do not receive enough attention in the national heatwave plan , and a survey held in the wallonia region in belgium came to a similar conclusion [ 15 ] .
there is a discrepancy between the risk groups being targeted among the two municipalities in belgium in our study : one targets all risk groups mentioned in the national heatwave plan , while the other focuses only on the elderly .
we believe that there should be more emphasis on the variety of risk groups for heat , such as socially isolated individuals , and the organisational structures responsible for their care .
although most stakeholders welcome the national heatwave plan , since it describes the different stakeholders and provides information on heat and health , it is considered a general weakness that the roles and responsibilities are not clearly described .
stakeholders can decide not to undertake any actions , since none of the intended actions is enforced by law .
although it is a conscious decision by the activators not to assign responsibilities , there is no consensus among the stakeholders that this is the best approach .
the lack of contact between different stakeholders was also mentioned as a weakness by key informants from each country .
we recommend the involvement of representatives from relevant stakeholders for a more effective uptake , as recent research suggests [ 15 ] .
in belgium , implementation on a local level is not included in the national plan , and should be taken up fully by the local stakeholders .
similarly , a previous study showed that the uk national heatwave plan , although considered an important source of disaster risk knowledge , was not successful in steering sustainable change in the way that heat risk is planned for at the local level [ 23 ] .
this results in large variation in the number of activities between different municipalities , as was observed in our study .
sharing best practices and lessons learnt about implementation at a local level could be useful .
for example , the municipality of etterbeek had developed a very comprehensive local heatwave plan , in which they raised awareness towards risk groups , established a contact point for the general public and provided information to professionals .
lessons can be learnt from these pioneering municipalities by others .
there is also a need for more detailed studies , describing the effectiveness of local heatwave plans in averting local excess mortality .
recent research has found no real adaptation to heat between the 2003 and 2007 heatwaves [ 13 ] .
as this study shows , there is a substantial room for improvement in terms of local implementation of national heatwave plans , since these plans have a potential to improve adaptation to heat and heatwaves .
the question then remains how well both countries are prepared to react to the next heatwave .
as evaluation remains one of the largest gaps in research [ 12 ] , this question is difficult to answer .
however , this study does provide early insights into professional organisations that seem to be unaware of heat and its health impact , even though they tended to be those closest to the most vulnerable .
this study uncovers the reality that information does not flow downstream and this might be an extraordinary source to avert morbidity and mortality in the future .
to achieve this , we encourage local studies to be undertaken , which should include surveillance and evaluation .
5. limitations our study does not give a complete overview on national heatwave plan perception in brussels and amsterdam , since only one or few key informants were interviewed for each type of organisation .
therefore , the results should be considered as indicative of the general situation .
we did not get any insight into the extent of general practitioners and childcare centres that receive a heat warning or act after receiving it. the fact that we never received a reply from these organisations from either country could imply that they do not see this topic as a priority or simply have little knowledge about it. due to differences between our two studied countries , the responsibilities of parallel organisations might differ , e.g. , the local / regional implementation of the national heatwave plan in belgium is coordinated by the municipality , while in the netherlands this falls under the responsibility of the municipal health organisation .
therefore , a valid comparison of national heatwave plan perception between the two countries is not always possible .
however , we would still encourage belgium and the netherlands to collaborate , e.g. , by streamlining the phases and activation criteria for the national heatwave plans .
6. conclusions we found a lack of familiarity with the national heatwave plan among care organisations in both belgium and the netherlands .
among all stakeholders , care organisations also prioritised heat the lowest .
we recommend urgently increasing awareness on the impact of heat on health among these stakeholders , which should be the priority of the activators in both countries .
some groups of individuals , such as the homeless and other socially isolated individuals , do not seem to be sufficiently addressed by the current national heatwave plans and most local plans , which is why more emphasis needs to be given to the variety of heat - risk groups and how to reach them .
more clarity should be given to the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the plans .
this can be ensured by involving them in the development of updates of the plan .
implementation of the plan on a local level is not described in the belgian national heatwave plan , and its success depends fully on the priority that is given to it by local stakeholders .
sharing best practices could be a way to achieve more harmonised and higher quality plans , which are fully applicable in real settings , taking into consideration that resources vary between municipalities .
finally , due to several representatives being excluded from our study , there is a lack of insight in how messages from the national heatwave plans are perceived by e.g. , general practitioners and childcare centres .
we suggest a detailed quantifiable survey among a large sample of representatives from these groups , to obtain clarity in their perception of the messages and potential barriers that should be addressed by activators of the national heatwave plans .

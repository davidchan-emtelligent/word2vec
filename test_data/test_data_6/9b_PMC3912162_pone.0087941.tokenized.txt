the female steroid , 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) , is important for pancreatic beta - cell function and acts via at least three estrogen receptors ( er ) , eralpha , erbeta , and the g - protein coupled er ( gper ) .
using a pancreas - specific eralpha knockout mouse generated using the cre - lox - p system and a pdx1 - cre transgenic line ( peralphako - / - ) , we previously reported that islet eralpha suppresses islet glucolipotoxicity and prevents beta - cell dysfunction induced by high fat feeding .
we also showed that e2 acts via eralpha to prevent beta - cell apoptosis in vivo .
however , the contribution of the islet eralpha to beta - cell survival in vivo , without the contribution of eralpha in other tissues is still unclear .
using the peralphako - / - mouse , we show that eralpha mrna expression is only decreased by 20 % in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus , without a parallel decrease in the vmh , making it a reliable model of pancreas - specific eralpha elimination .
following exposure to alloxan - induced oxidative stress in vivo , female and male peralphako - / - mice exhibited a predisposition to beta - cell destruction and insulin deficient diabetes .
in male peralphako - / - mice , exposure to e2 partially prevented alloxan - induced beta - cell destruction and diabetes .
eralpha mrna expression was induced by hyperglycemia in vivo in islets from young mice as well as in cultured rat islets .
the induction of eralpha mrna by hyperglycemia was retained in insulin receptor - deficient beta - cells , demonstrating independence from direct insulin regulation .
these findings suggest that induction of eralpha expression acts to naturally protect beta - cells against oxidative injury .

introduction the female steroid , 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) , is important for pancreatic beta - cell function in mammals [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
e2 acts through at least three estrogen receptor ( er ) s in beta - cells , eralpha er beta and the g - protein coupled er ( gper ) .
these ers are expressed in rodent and human beta - cells in both sexes , where they exhibit a predominant extranuclear localization [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] .
the islet eralpha is important for enhancing insulin biosynthesis in vivo via an extranuclear eralpha - dependent mechanism that amplifies the effect of glucose in stimulating the insulin gene promoter [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
the islet eralpha also suppresses excess de novo lipogenesis , which prevents glucolipotoxic beta - cell failure in rodent models of type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) [ 8 ] .
e2 also acts as a survival hormone that prevents beta - cell apoptosis in vivo in both sexes at physiological concentrations .
this protection is lost in mice globally deficient in eralpha [ 9 ] .
in cultured mouse and human islets , e2 protection is mediated mainly via eralpha and gper , and it protects from diabetes - associated injury resulting from oxidative stress and pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 5 ] , [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
further , during pancreatic islet transplantation , use of an eralpha - selective agonist enhances human islet graft survival , thus protecting islet functional mass [ 12 ] .
overall , global expression of eralpha is necessary for islet survival in mice , and pharmacological activation of eralpha protects islet survival in culture and following in vivo treatment .
nonetheless , the direct and singular impact of eralpha in islet beta - cells on islet survival in vivo - without contribution from the effects of eralpha action in other tissues - has not been addressed .
in this study we used the peralphako - / - mouse to examine the role of islet eralpha in islet survival from alloxan induced - oxidative stress in vivo .
materials and methods generation of mutant mice and animal care pancreas specific eralpha knockout mice were generated using the cre - lox - p system and a pdx1 - cre transgenic line ( peralphako - / - ) as previously described [ 7 ] .
pdx1 - cre mice were bred onto the cre - inducible rosa26 - lacz line at the university of michigan .
animal had free access to food and water .
they were kept on a 12 - h light / dark cycle .
all animal experiments were approved by northwestern university or university of michigan institutional animal care and use committee .
induction of experimental diabetes and tissue collection diabetes was induced in 10 - 12 week - old female and male mice by a single intraperitoneal ( ip ) injection of 150 mg / kg of alloxan ( alx ) ( 2,4,5,6 - tetraoxypyrimidine ) ( sigma - aldrich ) freshly prepared in sterile cold saline ( 0.9 %) .
mice eralphalox +/+ were used as control for peralphako - / - mice .
blood glucose was measured every 48 h after alx injection using one touch ultra glucose monitor ( lifescan ) .
at day 11 after alx injection , mice were killed and blood and pancreata were collected .
in vivo drug administration 17beta - estradiol ( 4 microg / 25 g ) ; tocris biosciences ) and vehicle ( 10 % ethanol and 90 % sesame oil ) were administered subcutaneously ( s.c. ) twice daily for two days .
pancreas insulin concentration tails of the pancreata were collected , weighed , and homogenized in acid / ethanol .
then , pancreas homogenates were centrifuged , and supernatants were used to measure pancreas insulin concentration by radioimmunoassay ( linco ) as described [ 7 ] .
plasma insulin concentrations plasma insulin concentrations were measured by elisa ( millipore ) .
pancreas immunohistochemistry deparaffinized pancreatic sections ( 5 microm ) were blocked for 30 min with blocking solution ( 20 % fetal bovine serum + 2 % roche blocking reagent ) .
sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies and 1 - 2 h with secondary antibodies at room temperature with the following primary antibodies : guinea pig anti - human insulin ( 1:1000 ; linco research ) , rabbit anti - glucagon ( 1:1000 , linco research ) , rat anti - mouse cd31 ( 1:400 ; bd biosciences ) .
secondary antibodies fitc - conjugated donkey anti - guinea pig , cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit , amca - conjugated donkey anti - guinea pig , and cy3 - conjugated goat anti - rat ( jackson immunoresearch laboratories ) were used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer .
the nuclei were stained with dapi ( invitrogen , molecular probes ) .
images were obtained with either nikon eclipse e400 microscope or tissue genostics tissue / cell high throughput imaging and analysis system at northwestern university cell imaging facility .
brain immunohistochemistry perfusion and immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described [ 13 ] .
briefly , mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of intraperitoneal pentobarbital ( 150 mg / kg ) and transcardially perfused with sterile pbs and then either 4 % paraformaldehyde or 10 % formalin .
brains were removed , post - fixed overnight and dehydrated in a 30 % sucrose solution .
following cryoprotection , brains were sectioned into 30 microm coronal slices , collected in four consecutive series and stored at - 20degreesc until further use .
for immunohistochemistry , brain sections were pretreated with ice - cold methanol , 0.3 % glycine and 0.3 % sds before blocking .
sections were then incubated with primary antibodies either rabbit anti - eralpha ( 1:1000 , sigma ) or goat anti - betagal ( 1:1000 , biogenesis ltd ) overnight at 4degreesc .
detection of primary antibodies was done by either immunofluorescence using secondary antibodies anti - rabbit alexa 488 , anti - goat alexa 568 , both 1:200 dilution ( invitrogen ) or using the avidin - biotin / diaminobenzidine method ( secondary antibody anti - rabbit - biotin , 1:200 dilution ) .
cell counts and statistic stained sections were imaged using leica microscope using 10x and 20x air objectives and processed using adobe photoshop csii ( adobe systems , san jose , ca ) .
photoshop was only used to overlay matched images in different rgb channels such that dual - labeled cells would become apparent and could be quantified as described [ 13 ] .
calculation of pancreatic beta - cell mass beta - cell area was measured in insulin - stained 5 microm thick pancreatic sections .
three to four sections per tissue were randomly chosen for morphometric analysis .
insulin positive area was determined by using imagej 1.37v program .
to calculate beta - cell mass ( mg ) , insulin positive area was divided by pancreas area and then multiplied by pancreas weight .
calculation of vessel density in islets blood vessel density was calculated by dividing the mouse - cd31 - positive area by the insulin - positive islet area by using imagej 1.37v program .
rat model of glucolipotoxicity two - month and 6 - month old male wistar rats ( charles river , st .
- constant , qc ) , were maintained hyperglycemic and hyperlipedimic for 72 hours , following a co - infusion of 70 % dextrose plus 20 % intralipid , compared to their 0,9 % saline infused controls as described [ 14 ] .
islets isolation at the end of infusion , islets were isolated by pancreas collagenase digestion as described [ 14 ] .
rat islets culture wistar rat islets were pre - cultured for a week in serum - free rpmi medium supplemented with 5 g / l bsa ( 37degreesc , humidified atmosphere containing 5 % co2 ) .
islets were further cultured for 18 h or 1 week in the same medium containing 5 , 10 or 30 mm glucose ( medium was renewed every other day ) [ 15 ] .
mouse model of moderate hyperglycemia to study eralpha expression under mild hyperglycemia conditions , a 4 days glucose infusion in mice was performed as is described in [ 16 ] .
briefly , c57bl / 6j male mice of 8 - 12 weeks - old and 20 - 25 g received a 4 days infusion of saline or 50 % glucose .
after this , mice were anesthetized and islets isolated by digestion with 1.7 ml / cc collagenase p ( sigma ) [ 9 ] .
betairko cell culture we used insulin - secreting cell lines established from groups of betairko , and lox control mice as was described previously [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .

experiments were performed using 80 - 90 % confluent cells .
lox and betairko cells were seeded in 6 - well plates and incubated for 24 h to recover .
cells were first washed with pbs before incubating in 16.7 or 33 mm glucose in dmem containing 10 % serum and penicillin and streptomycin for 3 days .
q - pcr total rna was extracted using rneasy ( r ) micro kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) for islets or rneasy ( r ) kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) for cells according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
cdna was prepared from 1 microg of total rna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( invitrogen ) with random hexamer primers , according to the manufacturer 's instructions real - time pcr amplification of eralpha and tbp ( tata - box binding protein ) cdnas was carried out i on a cfx96 using iq - sybr green supermix ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) .

results recombination of eralpha in hypothalamic neurons of peralphako - / - mice to investigate the role of pancreatic eralpha on beta - cell biology in vivo , we used peralphako - / - mice in which eralpha was inactivated in all pancreatic lineages using a pdx1 - cre transgenic mouse [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
because pdx1 - cre transgenic mice were reported to promote recombination in nutrient sensing hypothalamic neurons [ 19 ] , we first sought to determine whether recombination of eralpha occurs in the hypothalamus of peralphako - / - mice .
accordingly , using a transgenic pdx1 - cre / lacz mouse [ 19 ] , we observed that pdx1 is co - expressed with eralpha in ~ 26 % of neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus ( vmh ) , ~ 17 % of neurons in the preoptic area ( poa ) , and ~ 15 % of neurons of the arcuate nucleus ( arc ) ( fig. 1a - b ) .
female peralphako - / - mice exhibited a 20 % decrease in the number of eralpha positive cells in the arc , without a parallel decrease in the vmh ( fig. 1d - f ) .
they also exhibited decreased fertility ( data not shown ) , suggesting that eralphaexpression was also decreased in the poa .

no alteration in islet vascularization in absence of eralpha e2 stimulates angiogenesis and promotes endothelial cell recovery after injury [ 13 ] - [ 17 ] .
we previously observed that estrogens improve islet revascularization during islet transplantation [ 12 ] .
thus , prior to exploring islet predisposition to oxidative stress , we sought to determine whether islet vascularization was altered in female peralphako - / - mice .
because loss of eralpha in beta - cells or in endothelial cells can alter endothelial cell function via paracrine or endocrine mechanisms , respectively , we studied vascular density in peralphako - / - and mice globally deficient in eralpha ( eralphako - / - ) .
when we quantified the endothelial cell area in pancreas section using the mouse endothelial cell marker cd31 , we observed no difference in islet vascularization among eralphako - / - , peralphako - / - and female control mice ( fig. 2 ) .
the absence of islet vascular defects demonstrated that eralpha was not essential for islet angiogenesis in mice .

the absence of islet eralpha predisposes to oxidative stress - induced diabetes in mice we induced oxidative stress in beta - cells in vivo using a single high - dose injection of alloxan ( alx ; 150 mg / kg of body weight ) , which augments the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in pancreatic islets [ 20 ] .
we initially observed that female c57bl / 6 mice were protected from alx - induced diabetes ( fig. 3 ) .
next , we induced oxidative stress in beta - cells of peralphako - / - female mice .
in basal conditions ( time = 0 , prior to alx injection ) , control and peralphako - / - female mice displayed similar blood glucose ( fig. 4a - b ) and insulin concentrations ( data no shown ) .
they also exhibited normal islet architecture , with insulin - producing beta - cells in a central location and glucagon - producing alpha - cells at the periphery ( fig. 4d ) .
peralphako - / - female mice showed a trend toward decreased pancreatic insulin concentration , an observation that was consistent with the known effect of eralpha in stimulating insulin synthesis [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
following exposure to alx , control female mice showed relative protection compared to peralphako - / - female mice .
control female mice displayed only a minor increase in blood glucose despite hypoinsulinemia and an 87 % decrease in beta - cell mass and pancreatic insulin concentration ( fig. 4c - f ) .
this finding was consistent with the fact that only 20 % of beta - cells are needed to maintain euglycemia [ 12 ] .
in contrast , relative to controls , exposure of peralphako - / - female mice to alx , induced marked hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency that resulted from a more severe beta - cell destruction ( 97 %) and decrease in pancreatic insulin concentrations ( fig. 4a - f ) .
thus , peralphako - / - female mice exhibited a predisposition to alloxan - induced beta - cell destruction .
note that we did not observe differences in alpha - cell density between alloxan - injected control and peralphako - / - female mice .

regarding males , control and peralphako - / - mice were normoglycemic and normoinsulinemic in basal conditions ( fig. 5a - c ) , and displayed normal islet architecture ( fig. 5d ) .
after alx exposure , both control and peralphako - / - male mice developed hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency and exhibited decreased beta - cell mass and pancreatic insulin concentrations .
however , the reduction in all of these parameters was more dramatic in peralphako - / - than in control mice ( fig. 5a - f ) .
in addition , after e2 administration , we observed partial protection from alloxan - induced beta - cell destruction and insulin deficiency in both controls and peralphako - / - male mice ( fig. 5a - f ) .
thus , as observed in females , male peralphako - / - mice exhibited a predisposition to alloxan - induced beta - cell destruction ( although to a lesser extent ) , but estrogen still provided some protection from alloxan in the absence of islet eralpha .
note that unlike in the case of fig.3 , experiments of alx injections described in fig.4 and 5 were performed independently in male and female mice .
therefore , males and female mice described in in fig.4 and 5 are not comparable with regard to the female protection from diabetes observed in fig.2 .

altered islet eralpha expression during hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia having determined that islet eralpha is important to oxidative stress protection in vivo , we next sought to determine whether eralpha mrna expression was altered in islets during hyperglycemia - induced oxidative stress in vivo .
we used two established rodent models of glucotoxicity and glucolipotoxicity .
we first studied eralpha mrna expression in islets from non - diabetic wistar rats that received a 72 h glucose and intralipid co - infusion to mimic glucolipotoxicity ( mean glucose 15 mm ) [ 14 ] .
under these conditions , hyperglycemia was associated with increased eralpha mrna expression in 2 month - old rat islets ( fig. 6a ) .
however , hyperglycemia did not increase eralpha mrna in islets from 6 month - old rats .
we next studied eralpha mrna expression in a mouse model of mild hyperglycemia that was achieved by a 4 - day glucose infusion ( mean glucose 7 mm ) [ 16 ] .
in this model , we observed no increase in islet eralpha mrna ( fig. 6b ) .
to ascertain whether eralpha mrna induction under severe hyperglycemic conditions resulted from a direct glucose effect on islets , we further studied eralpha mrna expression in wistar rat islets cultured one week in hyperglycemic conditions [ 15 ] .
eralpha expression was increased when glucose was raised from 5 mm to 10 mm , but there was no further increase at 30 mm ( fig. 6c ) .
therefore , moderate to severe hyperglycemia [ 15 ] is associated with increased eralpha mrna expression in vitro and in vivo in rats .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0087941.g006 figure 6 messenger rna levels of eralpha were measured by qt - pcr from ( a ) 2 and 6 months - old male wistar rats after 72 h glucose and intralipid co - infusion. ( b ) c57bl / 6j male mice of 8 - 12 weeks - old after a 4 day glucose infusion .

eralpha expression in insulin resistant beta - cells we hypothesized that the increased eralpha mrna expression in islets exposed to hyperglycemia could be due to the stimulatory effect of high glucose or to the impact of elevated insulin on the ir in the islets .
to address this question , we quantified eralpha expression in beta - cells isolated from normal and beta - cell ir knockout ( betairko ) mice [ 18 ] .
these islets were cultured in hyperglycemic conditions to increase insulin secretion .
consistent with the effect of glucose described above ( fig. 5a ) , eralpha mrna expression was increased in both control ( lox / lox ) and betairko beta - cells when glucose was increased from 16.7 mm to 33 mm ( fig. 6d ) .
however , at both glucose concentrations , eralpha mrna expression was higher in betairko compared to lox / lox beta - cells , demonstrating that insulin action in beta - cells inhibits eralpha mrna expression .
discussion having established that eralpha is not essential to islet angiogenesis in mice , we focused on the role of eralpha in protecting islets from glucotoxicity and oxidative stress in vivo and report that both male and female mice lacking eralpha selectively in the pancreas are more susceptible to alloxan - induced beta - cell destruction , insulin deficiency , and hyperglycemia .
although these experiments demonstrated a mild decrease in eralpha mrna expression in hypothalamus of peralphako - / - mice , the absence of alteration in energy homeostasis [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and the pancreas - specific phenotype observed in this model both suggest that the peralphako - / - phenotype results exclusively from pancreatic elimination of eralpha .
since alloxan induces oxidative stress , these findings demonstrate that normal islet eralpha expression is required to protect beta - cells from oxidative stress - induced apoptosis in vivo in both sexes .
the harmful effect of eralpha deletion is more pronounced in female mice , presumably as a result of higher e2 serum concentrations that are required to activate the islet eralpha in this gender .
nonetheless , the negative effect of eralpha deletion on islet cells is also observed in males , demonstrating that islet protection by eralpha is sex independent .
we previously reported that mice of both sexes globally lacking eralpha ( alphaerko - / - ) were predisposed to streptozotocin - induced beta - cell apoptosis and insulin - deficient diabetes [ 9 ] .
however , the beneficial actions of estrogen on glucose homeostasis results from the combined actions of eralpha in different tissues [ 2 ] .
thus alphaerko - / - mice globally lacking estrogen action in skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , and the brain become obese and insulin resistant as well as mildly hyperglycemic .
this could produce additional beta - cell stress that would synergize streptozotocin toxicity to alter beta - cell survival .
the current study demonstrates that loss of eralpha selectively in islets - while eralpha is normally expressed in other tissues - is sufficient to induce beta - cell destruction in the presence of another beta - cell stress and without any influence of altered body weight [ 2 ] , [ 7 ] .
given the mild decrease in eralpha expression observed in peralphako - / - hypothalamic arc , this abnormality is unlikely to play a role in the peralphako - / - phenotype .
we previously reported that eralpha gene dosage plays a role in the islet protection from streptozotocin injury because heterozygous alphaerko - / - mice of both sexes were predisposed to streptozotocin - induced diabetes [ 9 ] .
thus , increased eralpha expression could function to protect beta - cells against oxidative stress .
to evaluate this hypothesis , we used established models of glucolipotoxicity and moderate hyperglycemia .
we observed that in both cultured rat islets and in mouse islets in vivo , moderate to severe hyperglycemia increased eralpha mrna .
in cultured mouse islets and min6 cells , short term exposure to high glucose is also associated with an increase in eralpha mrna expression [ 21 ] .
overexpression of eralpha prevents apoptosis in pc12 neuronal cells , [ 22 ] and in the sk - n - mc human neuroblastoma cell line [ 23 ] .
in contrast , in a model of moderate hyperglycemia , eralpha mrna is not upregulated in islets .
during hyperglycemia , is eralpha induced by glucose itself or by insulin ?
in ir - deficient beta - cells cultured in high glucose , eralpha mrna was increased compared to normal cells .
this demonstrates that compared to hyperglycemia , insulin action in beta - cells is unlikely to play a direct role in inducing eralpha mrna in beta - cells .
thus , the induction of eralpha expression by hyperglycemia could function as a beta - cell protection against oxidative injury when hyperglycemia reaches a threshold beyond which oxidative injury occurs .
further , glucolipotoxicity , upregulates eralpha mrna in young rats , but this feature is lost in older animals .
since eralpha improves beta - cell survival [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 9 ] , the loss of eralpha induction in old islets may alter their resistance to diabetic injuries , as we observe in the peralphako - / - mouse .
this weakness may further increase beta - cell susceptibility to oxidative injuries such as glucotoxicity , setting the stage for beta - cell failure in old age .
eralpha protection from oxidative stress could involve a combination of rapid antiapoptotic actions that are independent of nuclear events and that potentially lead to alteration in protein phosphorylation [ 3 ] , [ 24 ] .
alternatively , it could involve a more classical genomic mechanism that induces an anti - inflammatory cascade via expression of the liver receptor homolog [ 25 ] .
in conclusion , eralpha mrna expression is induced in islets from young mice by exposure to hyperglycemia and oxidative stress , and mice of both sexes that selectively lack eralpha in the islets are susceptible to both oxidative stress in beta - cells and insulin - deficient diabetes .

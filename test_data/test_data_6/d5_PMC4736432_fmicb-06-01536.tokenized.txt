resistance developed by microbes is challenging success stories of treatment of infectious diseases with anti - microbials .
developing new antimicrobials against these resistant organisms does not progress at the same speed .
in an effort to address this key issue , this work overviews the role of different stakeholders and discusses preventative and control measures for effective management of available resources .
roles and concerns of physicians , pharmacists and the public are also discussed .
more than anything , this situation requires immediate action to establish antimicrobial stewardship program , control over the counter sale and promote public awareness .
the paper also confronts the idea of curbing the use of antimicrobials using mass media , while detailing the consequences of non - therapeutic use .
the role of policy makers in taking global action is essential to establishing authority or agency for formulating national guidelines and regulations for prudently using antimicrobials .
to do this , this paper recommend the establishment of a global fund .
in conclusion , the race against resistance is a collective responsibility requiring coordinated action at local , national , regional and international levels to ensure sustained utilization of antimicrobials .
antimicrobials resistance stewardship growth promotors therapeutic use introduction antimicrobials are naturally occurring or synthetic chemical agents that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms .
they are one of the most successful forms of chemotherapy used in the treatment of infectious diseases .
although evidence suggests the existence of antimicrobials back to 350 - 550 ce ( bassett et al. , 1980 ; nelson et al. , 2010 ) , their effective use began in the mid - 1940s making revolutionary changes in treating infectious diseases .
they remain the method of choice for such treatment .
however , their success stories are being challenged by resistance development due to misuse / overuse of antimicrobials .
though observed even before the first clinical use of penicillin in the early 1940s ( wright , 2010 ) ; the current situation on resistance to almost all the antimicrobial agents poses alarming risks to human and animal health worldwide .
microbial resistance is a natural evolutionary processual response to selective pressure ( wright , 2010 ) .
as a result , antimicrobial agents fail to act against microbes ( bacteria , fungus , parasites , or viruses ) resulting in persistent infection .
microbes acquire resistance by the incorporation of resistance genes into the microbial genome or plasmids through conjugation , transformation , or transduction ( tenover , 2006 ) .
it also occurs due to spontaneous mutations at the locus that control drug susceptibility .
although it is a natural process , excessive and prolonged use facilitates resistance and creates a serious threat .
antimicrobial consumption increased drastically between 2000 and 2010 ( world health organization [ who ] , 2014a ) .
in particular , brics countries ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) recorded the highest usage at around 76 % with an overall global increase of 36 %. between 2010 and 2030 , antimicrobial consumption is expected to increase by 67 % worldwide .
in particular , the amount of antimicrobials given to farm animals will likely increase by two - thirds over the next 15 years without intervention ( van boeckel et al. , 2015 ) .
studies have found that countries with high consumption rates also have high resistance rates ( ferech et al. , 2006 ) .
to this end , developers of new antimicrobials against these resistant microbes have failed to progress at the same speed .
in fact , only three new classes of antimicrobials have been introduced since 2000 for human use ( spellberg et al. , 2008 ) .
resistance is viewed as a global threat and therefore , necessitating control to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials by all possible means to continue to reap the benefits traditionally associated with them .
given this background , this work provides an overview of the role of different stakeholders and discusses preventive and control measures for effective management to minimize the development of resistance .
controlling therapeutic overuse in general , antimicrobials are received for therapy or prophylaxis during the course of infection , but at least one - half of patients are receiving them unnecessarily or inappropriately ( hogerzeil , 1995 ) .
for instance , the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract is associated with viral agents ( zoorob et al. , 2012 ) , where antimicrobials are ineffectual .
nevertheless , general practitioners often prescribe antimicrobials for this ailment ( bagger et al. , 2015 ) .
studies from the gulf cooperation council countries ( bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar , saudi arabia , and the united arab emirates ) indicated that inappropriately prescribing and overusing , including self - medication , appears to be the main cause of resistance development ( memish et al. , 2007 ; aly and balkhy , 2012 ) .
however , from the physician 's perspective , it is difficult to diagnose in the early stages whether an infection is viral or bacterial , especially in the cases of upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhea ( kotwani et al. , 2010 ) .
behavioral characteristics also play a crucial role in misuse and / or overuse .
for instance , patients sometimes demand medication on the basis that it was effective in previous illnesses - physicians may comply .
the role of pharmacists in dispensing over the counter ( otc ) sale of antimicrobials is noteworthy. by law , it is prohibited in many countries ( wirtz et al. , 2013 ) but is nevertheless poorly enforced and results in unlicensed distribution ( pan american health organization [ paho ] , 2004 ) .
while each stakeholder plays a key role in restricting usage , according to a new survey from the world health organization ( who ) , pharmacists are among the best positioned to promote appropriate use of antimicrobials ; they can play a crucial role in combating resistance along with policy - makers and health practitioners ( world health organization [ who ] , 2014b ) .
encouraging pharmacists through awareness programs and incentives would arrest the point of sale .
achieving compliance with otc laws , stricter enforcement and monitoring measures should all be applied .
there must also be severe penalties for non - compliant pharmacies .
an example of this is the retention of the operating manager 's license or closure of the business in the most extreme of circumstances .
the infectious disease society of america and the society for health care epidemiology of america published guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in 2007 to establish better management of clinical treatment resources .
these guidelines aim to provide information on how to establish such programs within health care institutions ( dellit et al. , 2007 ) .
the primary goal is to prevent or slow down resistance - these guidelines are a logical first step to facing the issue .
results from previous studies suggest that the systematic stewardship program not only helps to curb unnecessary usage , but also reduces the treatment cost considerably .
in one study , the program saved approximately us $ 1 million in 18 months ( bantar et al. , 2003 ) .
similarly , goff et al .
( 2012 ) showed that they achieved annual cost savings of $ 832,590 .
many countries have established national stewardship programs and experienced beneficial impacts even in resource - limited settings .
such a program is not the only way to combat mis - and overuse of antimicrobials .
mass media campaigns in belgium resulted in a 36 % decline in antimicrobial prescriptions and prompted france to initiate a similar campaign directed toward the public and general practitioners , particularly in the implementation of rapid strep diagnostic tests for upper respiratory infections ( sabuncu et al. , 2009 ) .
in general , education and awareness lead to better knowledge and also predicts positive attitude ( awad and aboud , 2015 ) .
countries lacking such initiatives need to implement media campaigns to educate the public , while stewardship programs can help physicians in hospitals to curb the unwanted use of antimicrobials .
countries like india have many private practitioners as an important source of medical care , especially in rural areas .
awareness programs targeting these practitioners should therefore be considered since they are generally the first contact preference for medical care in a local community ( rao , 2005 ) .
thus , effective programs targeting the reduction of antimicrobials at all levels should be considered failing which would result in a higher number of deaths ( world health organization [ who ] , 2014a ) in comparison to mortalities caused by other major illnesses ( figure 1 ) .

antimicrobial resistance : tackling a crisis for the health and wealth of nations .
review on antimicrobial resistance , london , uk. controlling non - therapeutic use initially , antimicrobials were administered to animals for prophylactic and curative reasons .
in the mid - 1950s , small quantities of antimicrobials such as penicillin and tetracycline were found to enhance the feed - to - weight ratio and increase growth rate in poultry , swine , and beef while reducing mortality and morbidity ( stokestad and jukes , 1950 ) .
as a result , the food and drug administration of the united states ( us fda ) approved these drugs in 1951 ( jones and ricke , 2003 ) .
this resulted in the extensive use of anti - microbial drugs in farm animal practice .
the adverse effect of the non - therapeutic use of antimicrobials was not realized until smith and crabb ( 1957 ) reported that diets containing tetracycline in pig and chicken resulted in tetracycline resistant escherichia coli .
studies quickly proceeded to elucidate the impact of the non - therapeutic use of antimicrobials in farm animals ( langlois et al. , 1984 ; aarestrup , 1999 ; funk et al. , 2006 ) .
although misuse and over - use in both human medicine and intensive animal production have been recognized as one of the important factors in the current crisis of resistance , non - therapeutic use has led to multi - drug resistance on agents never previously associated with farms ( levy , 2002 ) .
as a result , the first ban on farm use of antimicrobials as growth promoters was enacted in 1986 , in sweden followed by denmark , united kingdom , and other countries of the european union ( cogliani et al. , 2011 ) .
however , many countries refuse to take a firm position , despite the european experience that the ban has reduced overall consumption in animals ( casewell et al. , 2003 ) .
on the contrary , proponents argue that the withdrawal of small quantities of antimicrobials resulted in heavy use of antimicrobials to tackle the emergence of pathogens like salmonella sp. and campylobacter sp .
( hao et al. , 2014 ) .
this has made some countries skeptical about the ban .
infectious diseases' pervasiveness is generally linked to poor hygiene and management practices .
for instance , strong sanitation and hygiene procedures along with biosecurity measures helps alleviate antimicrobials in addition to health checks and vaccination programs .
likewise , frequent visits and checks by animal health professionals ensures the well - being of animals and is a key element in successful animal husbandry .
however , in reality antimicrobials are often used in farm animals with little or no veterinary consultation .
a survey in the usa reported that only 42 % of pig farms used the services of veterinary medical practitioners .
it is noteworthy to point out the role of veterinary medical practitioner here .
for instance , not all sick animals are infected , nor do all infections require treatment with antimicrobials ( weese et al. , 2015 ) .
in this way , correct prognoses and diagnoses are primary elements in decision making regarding their usage .
this rests ideally with veterinarians on the basis of symptoms and appropriate laboratory investigation , including culture and sensitivity tests as they pertain to individual animals or groups .
such practices not only protect the animals against diseases , but also provides economic benefits .
the animal health practitioner is responsible for educating farmers and ensuring that routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials should never be a substitute for good animal health management .
for instance , good weaning practices and avoiding excessive herd or flock size reduces stress and improves animal 's natural ability to fight infectious diseases without assistance ( humphrey , 2006 ) .
role of policy regulation in preserving antimicrobials policy - makers play a key role in tackling the fast - emerging public health problem of resistance .
the who has declared antimicrobial resistance as a global concern , insisting national surveillance systems .
harmonized integrated surveillance of antimicrobial resistance has been implemented in a limited number of countries , despite several international recommendations during the last two decades ( world health organization [ who ] , 2014a ) .
poor laboratory capacity , infrastructure , and data management prevent effective surveillance , making it difficult to discern patterns of resistance and identify disease trends and outbreaks in many countries .
each country should therefore establish an authority or agency to formulate national guidelines and regulations in an effort to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials .
measures should be consistent in these programs with the existing international guidelines and codes of practice such as the codex guidelines for risk analysis of foodborne antimicrobial resistance ( cac / gl 77 - 2011 ) ( fao / who , 2011 ) , and the codex code of practice to minimize and contain antimicrobial resistance ( cac / rcp 61 - 2005 ) ( fao / who , 2005 ) .
decision makers must terminate non - therapeutic use of antimicrobials that are also used in treatment of humans due to mounting evidence that it contributes to antimicrobial resistance development and endangers humanity .
continuous surveillance and data integration of microbial isolates are key components in assessing the current status of resistance .
the world organization for animal health ( oie ) has developed standards toward this purpose that help to detect the emergence and spread of resistant microbes that may cause foodborne disease ( world health organization [ who ] , 2014b ) .
establishing surveillance and monitoring programs therefore addresses two key issues : early warning and drug resistance .
developed nations may lend financial / technical support and help to develop a set of action plans to combat rapidly developing antimicrobial resistance in coordination with the who .
international financial institutions need to organize to develop a global fund toward creating an enabling environment for underdeveloped and developing countries to implement effective , evidence - based programs .
since many countries lack basic surveillance and laboratory capacity , technical , and monetary support is crucial to creating a culture of awareness and battling antimicrobial resistance .
current status , achievements , and challenges in an effort to address this alarming issue , the us fda has established a list of " qualifying pathogens " with the potential to pose a serious threat to public health .
generating antimicrobial incentives now ( gain ) has been signed as part of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs .
these are required to treat serious or life - threatening infections , whereas the act provides incentives like designating eligibility as fast - track products , or an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods ( food and drug administration , 2014 ) .
as of march 2015 , 36 new antimicrobials with a potential to treat serious bacterial infections are under various stages of clinical trials .
nevertheless , only 60 % of drugs entering phase 3 get approvals , resulting in about 5 new drugs or so. recently , the us fda approved three new antimicrobials : dalbavancin , oritavancin , and tedizolid to treat patients with bacterial infections ( the pew charitable trusts , 2015 ) .
while new drugs are being developed to meet the current crisis , resources need to be allocated to meet the twin challenges of preserving the existing antimicrobials and developing new ones .
social media networking can contribute to preserving existing antimicrobials. by targeting active users , it is possible to communicate consequences of inaction more frequently , efficiently , and on an unignorably mass scale .
as an example of a social media campaign , a recent report from south africa showed twitter as a useful tool to improve awareness of antimicrobial resistance ( goff and van den bergh , 2015 ) .
the world health assembly recently endorsed a global action plan with five major objectives , including : better awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance , strengthening surveillance and research , reducing the incidence of infection , optimizing the use of antimicrobial medicines and ensuring sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance ( world health organization [ who ] , 2015 ) .
it is the responsibility of member states to initiate the plan and monitor its success .
several initiatives are also being made specifically to combat non - therapeutic use , including the us fda 's proposal to phase out use over the course of three years .
companies have indicated their compliance , despite it being only an unenforced recommendation ( food and drug administration [ fda ] , 2015 ) .
the companies have agreed to change the marketing status of their products from otc to veterinary feed directive or prescription .
a recent report from an oie survey shows that 51 % of 152 participating countries have completely banned growth promoters , while 19 % have committed to a partial ban ( rushton , 2015 ) .
although legislation , surveillance systems , and bans on non - therapeutic use are on the rise ( diaz , 2013 ) , complete elimination of this type of use is impossible without alternative solutions .
using antimicrobials for growth promotion generates more profit than their use for disease control .
hence , it has been a common practice in livestock sector for the last half century .
however , in the case of good housing and hygiene , differences in the growth rates were insignificant between consumers and non - consumers of antimicrobials ( rushton , 2015 ) .
in some cases as in the case of poultry , american farmers have actually experienced economic loss when using antimicrobials ( graham et al. , 2007 ) .
it is therefore obvious that antimicrobials have little impact as growth promoters and can in general be substituted with better and more hygienic living conditions .
in the case of farm animals , whole herd health is the ultimate goal and to prevent infectious disease , it is common to medicate the drinking water of the whole herd , a commonly recognized means animals receive infectious agents .
alternative treatments have proven effective in treating farm water quality .
ozone is an extremely reactive oxidant and a very effective sanitary agent in the food and agricultural industries ( de candia et al. , 2015 ; pierron et al. , 2015 ) .
this would be an effective substitute to antimicrobials .
although it is difficult to substitute antimicrobials in animal husbandry and , prudent use is the only choice , possible measures to minimize their use at all levels should be applied .
research and development of new antimicrobials are yet another vital area progressing at a slower rate because of challenges encountered by pharmaceutical companies .
regulatory obstacles and economic disincentives force companies to focus on more lucrative areas like cardiology and oncology ( bettiol and harbarth , 2015 ) .
international groups have been aiming to create and test a new economic model for antimicrobial research autarky .
sooner or later , such models should accelerate research and development of new classes of antimicrobials to control infectious agents .
in an era of mounting antimicrobial resistance , priority among researchers needs to be targeted toward novel agents that circumvent , or at least , minimize resistance .
figure 2 depicts the race against resistance and how it is a complex issue facing a plenitude of factors ; as a result , every stakeholder must intervene by all possible means in order to manage this crisis .
figure 2 factors influencing race against antimicrobial resistance .
concluding remarks antimicrobial resistance is an alarming threat to global health ( laxminarayan et al. , 2013 ) , where 10 million deaths are estimated to occur annually by 2050 without appropriate intervention .
the who has drafted a sector - wide action plan to be implemented globally to attempt this .
considering the current situation , it is inevitable to establish legal frameworks and monitoring programs on regional and national levels to ensure appropriate usage of antimicrobials , which also means reducing their use drastically .
governments and ngos alike must develop nationwide education and awareness programs , while regulatory authorities should monitor the use of antimicrobials in hospitals and health care centers .
incentive programs may be incorporated to encourage appropriate usage , which will trigger stakeholders' compliance .
antimicrobial use as growth promoters need to be terminated .
quality management programs in farms should be enforced to prevent infection by improving sanitation , cleaning up water supplies , etc .
in addition , accelerating antimicrobial development needs to be a priority .
international collaboration and capacities for prevention , surveillance , and control of antimicrobials should be enhanced .
in conclusion , racing against antimicrobial resistance is a collective responsibility requiring coordinated action at all levels to ensure sustained benefits of antimicrobials and head off any threats to humanity 's future .

background : the most frequent form of inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) in dogs is represented histologically , by lymphoplasmacytic enteritis ( lpe ) , a histological category , often associated with other morphologic alterations including lymphangiectasia ( le ) .
however , literature data on this latter topic are quite scarce and have mostly been obtained in single reports or in small series .
aim : we evaluated some morphologic parameters of intestinal villi and lacteals in a large cohort of dogs , and correlated them with serum albumin and cholesterol values .
patients and methods : we investigated 136 dogs ( 94 with lpe , and 42 with gastrointestinal problems different from ibd ) and analyzed their clinical , laboratory ( albumin and cholesterol values ) , endoscopic , and histologic variables .
results : the lpe group showed significantly impaired clinical , laboratory , endoscopic , and histologic variables compared to controls .
affected dogs showed significant correlations between canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index ( cibdai ) scores and endoscopic and histologic variables .
moreover , the grade of hematologic changes were strongly related to the intestinal histologic variables , in particular those concerning villous and lacteals morphology .
conclusion : dogs with lpe had intestinal histologic abnormalities ( height , width , height / width ratio , calculated for both villi and lacteals ) , whose degree correlated with the severity of hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia .
evaluation of endoscopic and histologic variables in association to the clinical findings may reveal useful insights for the pathogenesis of lpe and , hopefully , might lead to more targeted therapeutic approaches .
key words dogs histology intestine lymphangiectasia lymphoplasmacytic enteritis introduction similarly to humans , dogs may be affected by chronic intestinal pathologies ; among these , inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) play a prominent role ( 1 ) .
ibd in dogs present some peculiar aspects compared to those seen in humans , especially from a histological point of view ( 2 ) .
indeed , the most frequent histological form associated to ibd in dogs is lymphoplasmacytic enteritis ( lpe ) ( 3 , 4 ) .
this histological category of enteritis , often associated with other morphological alterations ( 5 ) , results frequently associated with lymphangiectasia ( le ) ( 6 ) , and protein - losing enteropathy ( ple ) ( 7,8 ) .
lymphangiectasia in the dog is assumed to be an acquired disease , and its etiology is generally idiopathic ( 4 ) .
it may also result from any type of obstruction to lymph flow in the lacteals , mesenteric lymph vessels or nodes , most frequently secondary to inflammation .
venous hypertension as seen with congestive heart failure can also lead to impairment of lymph flow ( 4 , 7 , 9 ) .
lacteal dilation is not the primary problem ; however , as the lacteals in the villi dilate and enlarge , the normal absorption ability of the intestine is compromised ( 7 ) .
the subsequent effects of hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia can then harm or potentially cause the death of the animal .
breeds most commonly reported to be affected by le are the basenji , the norwegian lundehund , wheaten terriers , yorkshire terriers , shar - peis , and rottweilers .
there is no reported sex predisposition ( 7 ) .
it can be difficult to differentiate le from other associated diseases or pathological entities that may occur simultaneously ( 7 ) .
indeed , it could be diagnosed concurrently with an ibd , but it is uncertain whether one precedes the other or if they both may stem from the same pathogenetic process .
it is debatable whether intestinal le should be broken down into two categories : idiopathic versus le secondary to inflammation. whether the inflammatory process often observed with le is primary and contributory , or if it is an associated but separate pathological process has not been determined yet .
however , data on this topic are relatively scarce , and have been mostly obtained from single case reports or from small patient series .
currently , there are no objective pathological parameters that indicate a value of cut - off above which the diameter of the lacteals can be considered indicative of biochemically ( serum albumin and cholesterol concentration ) , but not yet clinically relevant le. thus , the purpose of the present study was the evaluation of some morphological parameters of intestinal villi and lacteals , in association with some laboratory findings in a large cohort of dogs with lpe , with particular emphasis on the association between clinical , histologic , and hematologic findings , and their relationship with histologically detected le. patients and methods data from dogs investigated for suspected ibd , and with a diagnosis of lpe in the period january 2002 - january 2009 were retrieved .
inclusion criteria were : compatible clinical findings ( i.e. , weight loss , persistent or recurrent vomiting and / or diarrhea ( 2 , 10 ) , exclusion of other possible causes of chronic enteritis including intestinal parasites ( 2,11,12 ) , blood chemistry ( see below ) , and with endoscopic investigation ( see below ) and histology showing lpe .
subjects with incomplete data were not included in the study .
clinical data the severity of clinical signs was assessed by the standard canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index ( cibdai ) , represented by the sum of the score of six different clinical signs ( attitude / activity , appetite , vomiting , stool consistency , stool frequency , and weight loss ) ( 13 ) .
laboratory studies blood samples were collected from the cephalic vein and , after sampling , were transferred in both plain and edta - containing vials .
for the purposes of the study only albumin and cholesterol values were assessed .
these variables were analyzed by means of a laser counter ( sysmex xt2000iv , sysmec corporation , kobe , japan ) validated in dogs ( 14,15 ) , and by an automated spectrophotometer ( cobas mira , rochediagnostics , basel , switzerland ) with reagents provided by real diagnostics srl ( viterbo , italy ) .
endoscopic studies as a general procedure in our institution , to maximize the likelihood of visualizing le , dogs ( all ibd / lpe and non - ibd ) undergoing endoscopy fasted for a minimum of 12 hours ; then , 8 - 9 hours before the procedure they were fed a small fatty meal ( using canned , not dry food , to which corn oil cream was mixed ) .
endoscopic procedures were carried out under general anesthesia ( premedication with medetomidine , 2 - 3 microg / kg , induction with propofol , 2 - 2.4 mg / kg , and maintenance with a mixture of isofluorane / oxygen administered by an orotracheal tube ) .
at least five images showing representative findings through the descending duodenum were obtained for every dog ; these images were assessed blindly by one of the authors who did not perform endoscopic procedures .
the findings were graded as mild , moderate and severe for each parameter ( figure 1 ) , according to the scores for endoscopic parameters for animals proposed by the wsava gastrointestinal standardization group ( 16 ) ( table 1 ) .
at least 10 biopsy samples from the small intestine ( duodenum ) were obtained from each dog .
table 1 endoscopic variables and scoring according to the wsava gastrointestinal standardization group ( adapted from ref .
16 ) ability to distend the lumen edema hyperemia / vascularity discoloration friability texture hemorrhage erosion / ulcer lacteal dilatation contents score : 0 = normal ; 1 = mild ; 2 = moderate ; 3 = severe figure 1 endoscopic aspects of intestinal lymphangiectasia in dogs .
note the different degrees of severity characterized , in the early phase ( a ) by white villi with scattered white spots interspersed in an inflamed mucosa .
in a more severe case ( b ) the milky aspect of the intestinal mucosa and the fluid content is diffuse , with edematous and well - evidenced villi .
the advanced stage ( c ) characterized by many white spots and nodules , associated with submucosal elevation and a diffuse white aspect of the mucosa .
histological studies immediately after sampling , intestinal biopsies were adhered to cellulose acetate paper and oriented in two ways : 5 longitudinally ( submucosal side down and villi up on paper ) and 5 perpendicularly ( with the free side containing villi ) .
then , after fixation into iso - osmotic 10 % buffered formalin , the specimens were embedded in paraffin maintaining the same orientation and cut to obtain 3microm thick sections , which were subsequently stained with hematoxylin - eosin .
histologic analysis was carried out by an experienced pathologist , blinded to the clinical and endoscopic data , employing histologic criteria recently proposed by the wsava gastrointestinal standardization group for diagnosing gastrointestinal inflammation in dogs and cats ( 17 ) .
these criteria were implemented by a previously described adjunctive scoring system ( 18 ) , used for a better definition of the concentration of inflammatory cells in intestinal inflamed areas and to evaluate the proportion of different types of leucocytes within the infiltrates .
inflammatory cells ( neutrophils , mononucleate cells ) and their organization in lymphoid aggregates were evaluated in 10 high - power fields ( hpf , magnification x400 ) .
for inflammatory cells the following score ( number of cells / hpf ) was used : 0 = < 5 cells ; 1 = 5 - 10 cells ; 2 = 11 - 50 cells ; 3 = 51 - 100 cells ; 4 = > 100 cells .
lymphoid aggregates were scored as : 0 = absent and 1 = present .
for scoring inflammatory cells , leucocytes were quantified in different intestinal compartments ( intestinal lamina propria , and epithelium of villus , basal crypt area , villus - crypt junction ) .
all cellular types were calculated using a light microscope ( carl zeiss italia , arese , italy ) , a x 40 objective , a x 10 eyepiece , and a square eyepiece graticule ( 10 x 10 squares , with a total area of 62,500 mum2 ) .
at present , cases of lacteal dilation are evaluated as suggested by wsava criteria , and scored from 0 to 3 as follows : 0 = normal , when the central lacteal represented up to 25 % of the villous lamina propria width on the longitudinal section ; 1 = mild dilation , when this width represents up to approximately 50 % ; 2 = moderate dilation , when this width represented up to 75 % ; and 3 = marked dilation , when central lacteal represented up to 100 % of the villous lamina propria ( 17 ) .
an aim of this study was to find morphological parameters by which to define in a more precise manner the values starting from which lacteal dilation can be considered , with regard to the criteria proposed by the wsava standardization group .
thus , we focused on the degree of correlation between the parameter of morphological dilation ( height , width , height / width ratio , calculated for both villi and lacteals ) and clinico - pathological findings ( cibdai , endoscopic and histologic - inflammatory infiltrate - score , and albumin and cholesterol values ) .
in this respect , the morphology of villi and lacteals ( figure 2 ) was evaluated by measuring three randomly selected and morphologically well - preserved villi / ducts for each of the 10 ( 5 coronal and 5 longitudinal ) sections .
to calculate villous or lacteals height , the latter was obtained from the length from the tip of the villus or duct to the bottom , not including the crypt .
villi and lacteals width was calculated in both coronal and longitudinal sections .
for the latter , the width was measured at about half the height of the villus .
at this level , in fact , the diameter has a value intermediate between the diameter of the apex and the base of the villus / lacteal .
these data were then compared with the measure of the width , obtained from the evaluation carried out on coronal sections .
both height and width values were obtained by means of an image analyzer ( nikon cosmozone 1s7 ctr , nikon instruments spa , campo bisenzio , italy ) .
moreover , the height / width ratio ( h / w ) was calculated for both villi and lacteals .
controls this group was represented by dogs that in the same time period underwent endoscopic procedures and had laboratory screening , including assessment of albumin and cholesterol , always for signs related to gastrointestinal tract diseases , but diagnosed with foreign bodies ( or suspected foreign bodies ) , esophageal dysfunctions , or acute - subacute gastritis or gastroenteritis ( excluded from the diagnosis of ibd ) necessitating of endoscopy .
all dogs belonging to the control group received the same pre - endoscopical preparation described above for the study group , including the administration of a small fatty meal before endoscopy , since after this procedure also apparently healthy dogs can show small foci of lacteal dilatation ( 19 ) .
statistical analysis since values were not normally distributed , nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis .
differences between patients and controls were assessed by means of the mann - whitney u test .
correlations between the various variables in lpe dogs were evaluated using the spearman 's rank correlation coefficient .
values of p < 0.05 were chosen for rejection of the null hypothesis .
data are presented as medians ( 95 % ci ) .
ethical considerations all dogs were evaluated in accordance with protocols approved by the university of camerino institutional animal care and use committee .
the university of camerino institutional review board approved the routinely used clinical protocol in both ibd / lpe and non - ibd animals .
according to the guidelines of the institutional ethical committee of university of camerino ( comitato etico tutela animali - ceta ) it was not necessary to require formal approval from the ceta , since all dogs were studied under the owner 's written informed consent , for diagnostic or check - up purposes .
results overall , complete data from 136 dogs ( 94 with ibd / lpe and 42 non - ibd ) were available for the study .
table 2 summarizes the results obtained in lpe and non - ibd dogs .
the lpe group showed significantly impaired clinical , laboratory , endoscopic , and histological variables compared to non - ibd dogs .
in lpe dogs , not all patients presented the same alterations of variables considered ; in particular , not all were hypoalbuminemic .
all lpe dogs showed lacteal dilation ( moderate to severe ) at endoscopy , compared with 36 % of mild findings found in the non - ibd group .

abnormalities of villous height and width are evident in longitudinal ( a ) and coronal ( b ) sections .
in normal mucosa ( c and d ) lacteals are small and sometimes difficult to observe in both longitudinal and coronal sections .
h & e , scale bars 800 microm ( a and c ) and 200 microm ( b and d ) .
concerning the various variables in lpe dogs : a ) cibdai score significantly correlated with both endoscopic ( rho = 0.67 , p < 0.0001 ) and histological ( rho = 0.68 , p < 0.0001 ) score ; b ) there was a strong correlation between endoscopic and histological scores ( rho = 0.83 , p < 0.0001 ) ; c ) there was an inverse relationship between the histological score and albumin ( rho = - 24 , p = 0.017 ) and cholesterol ( rho = - 0.43 , p < 0.0001 ) levels ; d ) the height of the intestinal villi inversely correlated with albumin ( rho = - 0.23 , p = 0.025 ) but not with cholesterol ( rho = - 0.03 , p = 0.8 ) levels ; e ) the width of intestinal villi did not correlate with albumin ( rho = 0.17 , p = 0.1 ) and cholesterol ( rho = 0.002 , p = 0.98 ) levels ; f ) the height of lacteals was inversely correlated with albumin ( rho = - 0.23 , p = 0.03 ) but not with cholesterol ( rho = - 0.04 , p = 0.7 ) levels ; g ) the width of the lacteals was inversely correlated with both albumin ( rho = - 0.73 , p < 0.0001 ) and cholesterol ( rho = - 0.65 , p < 0.0001 ) levels ; h ) the villous h / w ratio was inversely correlated with albumin ( rho = - 0.24 , p = 0.018 ) , but not with cholesterol ( rho = - 0.004 , p = 0.9 ) levels ; i ) the lacteals h / w ratio was significantly correlated with albumin and cholesterol levels ( rho = 0.6 , p < 0.0001 for both variables ) .
discussion this study , conducted on a large sample of dogs with lpe showed that affected animals show several peculiar clinical and pathological features compared to non - ibd dogs .
these features may be of interest in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the condition .
several studies have evaluated the normal canine and feline duodenal mucosa with haematoxylin & eosin and immunohistochemical staining , and showed that the normal villus length for an adult dog is 722 +/ - 170 microm , the normal crypt depth is 1.279 +/ - 203 microm , and the normal villus to crypt ratio is 0.7 +/ - 0.3 ( 20,21 ) .
a scoring system for lacteal dilation has also been suggested ( 17 ) , but more precise reference values above which to consider dilated both villi and lacteals are still lacking .
in our series lacteal dilatation ( lymphangiectasia ) was frequent , even though it was not always clinically suspected , considering that clinical signs are highly variable , and diarrhea , the most frequent clinical sign , is common to many other diseases .
in hypoalbuminemia was not present ; however , even though this finding is suggestive of lymphangiectasia , it does not exclude the disease .
clinically , dogs included in this study presented symptoms in different association with each other ; the classical signs of lymphangiectasia ( i.e. , ascites , edema , and hydrothorax ) were observed only in a few cases , which showed severe morphological abnormalities of the intestinal mucosa and profound hypoalbuminemia .
table 2 clinical , endoscopic , and histological variables observed in ibd / lpe and non - ibd dogs .
data are presented as median ( 95 % ci ) .
lpe ( n = 94 ) non - ibd ( n = 42 ) males / females (%) 51 / 43 ( 54.2 / 45.7 ) 23 / 19 ( 54.7 / 45.2 ) degrees age ( yr ) 7.2 ( 7 - 8 ) 5.2 ( 3 - 8 ) degreesdegrees cibdai 5 ( 4 - 7 ) 1 ( 1 - 2 )* albumin ( 2.7 - 4.4 g / dl ) 2.7 ( 2.3 - 2.9 ) 3.4 ( 3 - 3.5 )** cholesterol ( 129 - 148 mg / dl ) 138 ( 127 - 145 ) 166 ( 148 - 195 )* endoscopic score 21 ( 19 - 22 ) 0 ( 0 - 1 )* histologic score 2 ( 2 - 3 ) 0 ( 0 - 0.8 )* villous height ( microm ) 610 ( 613 - 659 ) 795 ( 724 - 831 )* villous width ( microm ) 273 ( 261 - 290 ) 153 ( 136 - 171 )* lacteals height ( microm ) 532 ( 517 - 582 ) 604 ( 598 - 689 )* lacteals width ( microm ) 256 ( 245 - 262 ) 121 ( 119 - 225 )* villous h / w 2.3 ( 2 - 2.5 ) 5 ( 4.5 - 5.6 )* lacteals h / w 2 ( 1 - 2.5 ) 5 ( 1 - 6 )* degrees p = 0.89 compared to lpe ; degreesdegrees p = 0.29 compared to lpe ; * p < 0.0001 compared to lpe ; ** p = 0.005 compared to lpe all of the variables investigated here in lpe dogs were significantly different from control animals .
in particular , the endoscopic and histological scores showed the greatest differences. with respect to clinical variables , higher cibdai scores suggested worse endoscopic and histological outcomes , as shown by a significant statistical correlation ( table 2 ) .
however , there is recent evidence that the endoscopic aspect alone may not be sufficient in this setting , especially concerning intestinal le ( 9 ) , and that other data ( such as histological assessment ) are needed .
multiple endoscopic variables were taken into consideration in lpe dogs , according to standard criteria ( 16 ) , and the endoscopic score was compared to the clinical and histological ones , as well as to laboratory variables suggesting protein - losing ( albumin and cholesterol ) enteropathy .
thus , a direct correlation was found between the clinical variables ( cibdai ) and both endoscopic and histological scores , suggesting that a high cibdai may herald severe endoscopic and histological damage .
moreover , a worse histological score suggests lower levels of albumin and cholesterol ; in particular , this may be due to damaged intestinal villi and lacteals , whose involvement was significantly related to albumin and cholesterol loss .
interestingly , lacteals wider than 108 microm were constantly associated with a severe (< 2g / dl ) loss of albumin .
according to our observations , when the average value of the h / w ratio is below of 2.3 microm for villi and 10 microm for lacteals respectively , it is reasonable to consider already a condition of lacteal dilation , even if the values of albumin and cholesterol are still normal .
also , we want to stress the importance of excluding secondary causes of lymphangiectasia , especially those related to some parasites that , as in human beings , may be clinically insidious ( 22 ) .
in conclusion , this large study in lpe dogs showed that hypoalbuminemia was correlated to intestinal histological abnormalities , and particularly to those related to the height and width of the villi and lacteals .
these findings , together with other abnormalities ( such as alterations of the intestinal barrier ( 19 )) may be of importance in the pathogenesis of lpe and in the origin of signs .
we feel that the above evaluations ( villous height and width , chylous - ducts height and width , villous h / w ratio and chylous - ducts h / w ratio ) could be helpful when dogs presenting clinical sings but not hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia are diagnosed histologically with " mild dilated " ( score 1 ) or even " normal " ( score 0 ) lacteals .
it will be interesting to establish whether , in such cases , followed over time , the histologic evaluation ( also taking into account the above variables ) , could predict a possible future development of clinically evident lymphangiectasia. of course , to further validate the parameters we investigated , comparative studies with the criteria previously proposed by the wsava standardization group ( 17 ) would be needed .
in our opinion , these data may be important not only for a better understanding and treatment of the veterinary pathology but also , as shown in other conditions ( 23 ) , be useful to increase knowledge of human diseases .

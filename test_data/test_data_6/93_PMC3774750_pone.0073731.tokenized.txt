chronic hypoxia during gestation has profound adverse effects on the adaptation of uteroplacental circulation in pregnancy .
yet , the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood .
the present study tested the hypothesis that enhanced production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in uterine arteries plays a critical role in the maladaptation of uterine circulation associated with chronic hypoxia .
uterine arteries were isolated from nonpregnant and near - term pregnant sheep maintained at sea level (~ 300 m ) or exposed to high - altitude ( 3801 m ) hypoxia for 110 days .
hypoxia significantly increased ros production in uterine arteries of pregnant , but not nonpregnant , sheep .
this was associated with a significant increase in nadph oxidase ( nox ) 2 , but not nox1 or nox4 , protein abundance and total nox activity in uterine arteries of pregnant animals .
chronic hypoxia significantly increased pressure - dependent uterine arterial myogenic tone in pregnant sheep , which was abrogated by a nox inhibitor apocynin .
additionally , the hypoxia - induced increase in myogenic reactivity of uterine arteries to phorbol 12,13 - dibutyrate in pregnant sheep was blocked by apocynin and tempol .
in consistence with the myogenic responses , the hypoxia - mediated down - regulation of bkca channel activity in uterine arteries of pregnant animals was reversed by apocynin .
the findings suggest that heightened oxidative stress in uterine arteries plays a key role in suppressing the bkca channel activity , resulting in increased myogenic reactivity and maladaptation of uteroplacental circulation caused by chronic hypoxia during gestation .

introduction uterine vascular myogenic reactivity is a key physiological mechanism in regulating basal vascular tone and uterine blood flow , and reduction in pressure - dependent uterine vascular myogenic tone contributes significantly to the adaptation of uteroplacental circulation in pregnancy [ 1 ] - [ 7 ] .
increased ca2 + - activated k + ( bkca ) channel activity plays a key role in attenuating myogenic tone of the uterine artery in pregnancy [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
chronic hypoxia during pregnancy is a common stress to maternal cardiovascular homeostasis and has profound adverse effects on uteroplacental circulation , leading to a 2 - 4 fold increase in the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal intrauterine growth restriction [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
our recent studies have demonstrated that chronic hypoxia during gestation results in inhibition of bkca channel activity and an increase in pressure - dependent myogenic tone and protein kinase c ( pkc ) - mediated myogenic reactivity of uterine arteries in pregnant sheep [ 14 ] - [ 17 ] .
however , the molecular mechanisms underlying gestational hypoxia - mediated alterations of uterine vascular function are not fully understood .
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , serving as important signaling molecules in vascular smooth muscle cells , mediate numerous physiological processes. of importance , ros have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of vascular dysfunctions , including pulmonary hypertension and preeclampsia [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] .
hoffmann et al [ 21 ] demonstrated an important causative role for increased ros in the development of hypertension and in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in an animal model that spontaneously develops the disease .
although intracellular ros may be generated by various sources , nadph oxidase ( nox ) appears to be the major ros generator in the vasculature .
recent studies indicate that hypoxia increases ros generation via nox signaling pathways , and nox inhibition reduces hypoxia - mediated responses in the vasculature [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
in addition , pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of ros generation blocked hypoxia - induced activation of pkc and myogenic response [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
the role of ros in the regulation of uterine vascular function in response to chronic hypoxia in gestation has not been investigated , however .
herein , we present evidence that heightened nox - mediated ros production suppresses bkca channel activity and results in an increase in pkc - mediated myogenic reactivity and myogenic tone of uterine arteries in pregnant sheep acclimatized to long - term high altitude hypoxia .
materials and methods tissue preparation uterine arteries were obtained from nonpregnant and near - term (~ 140 days' gestation ) pregnant sheep maintained at sea level (~ 300 m ) or exposed to high - altitude ( 3801 m ) hypoxia ( arterial po2 : 60 mmhg ) for 110 days [ 15 ] .
animals were anesthetized with thiamylal ( 10 mg / kg , i.v. ) followed by inhalation of 1.5 % to 2.0 % halothane .
an incision was made in the abdomen and the uterus exposed .
uterine arteries were isolated and removed without stretching and placed into a modified krebs solution .

tissue slides were incubated with dhe ( 5 microm ) at 37degreesc for 30 min .
the slides were viewed with an olympus bh - 2 microscope , and images were captured with a spot digital camera imaging system .
total ros in uterine artery segments were measured with the oxiselect ( tm ) in vitro ros / rns assay kit ( cell biolabs , inc .
san diego , ca ) following the manufacture 's instruction , as described previously [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
measurement of myogenic tone pressure - dependent myogenic tone of resistance - sized uterine arteries (~ 150 microm in diameter ) was measured as previously described [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 29 ] .
briefly , uterine arteries were dissected , mounted and pressurized in an organ chamber ( living systems , burlington , vt ) .
the intraluminal pressure was controlled by a servo - system and arterial diameter was recorded using the softedge acquisition subsystem ( ionoptix llc , milton ma ) .
following the equilibration period , the intraluminal pressure was increased in a stepwise - manner from 10 to 100 mmhg in 10 - mmhg increments .
to determine the maximum passive diameter , the passive pressure - diameter relation was conducted in ca2 + - free physiologic saline solution containing 3.0 mmol / l of egta .
the following formula was used to calculate percent myogenic tone at each pressure step : % myogenic tone = ( d1 - d2 )/ d1x100 , where d1 is the passive diameter in ca2 + - free physiologic saline solution ( 0 ca2 + with 3.0 mmol / l of egta ) and d2 is the active diameter with normal physiologic saline solution in the presence of extracellular ca2 + .
contraction studies fourth branches of main uterine arteries from both pregnant and nonpregnant sheep were isolated , and cut into 2 - mm ring segments and mounted in 10 - ml tissue baths containing modified krebs solution equilibrated with a mixture of 95 % o2 and 5 % co2 .
phorbol 12,13 - dibutyrate ( pdbu ) - induced concentration - dependent contractions were obtained by cumulative additions of pdbu in approximate one - half log increments , in the absence or presence of a nox inhibitor apocynin or a sod mimetic tempol , as described previous [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 29 ] .
western immunoblotting uterine arteries were homogenized in a lysis buffer , followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g at 4degreesc for 10 min .

the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4degreesc .
the pellet was suspended in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and manually homogenized on ice .
nox activity was measured by a luminescence assay in a 50 mmol / l phosphate buffer , ph 7.0 , containing 1 mmol / l egta , 150 mmol / l sucrose , 5 mumol / l dark - adapted lucigenin as the electron acceptor , and 100 mumol / l nadph as the substrate .
the chemiluminescent signal was measured using a synergy ht luminmeter ( biotek , vermont ) .
the data were normalized to the protein content in each sample .
electrophysiology smooth muscle cells were enzymatically dissociated from resistance - sized uterine arteries , and whole - cell k + currents were recorded using an epc 10 patch - clamp amplifier with patchmaster software ( heka , lambrecht / pfalz , germany ) at room temperature , as previously described [ 8 ] , [ 14 ] .
briefly , cell suspension drops were placed in a recording chamber and adherent cells were continuously superfused with hepes - buffered physiologic salt solution .
micropipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 2 to 5 momega when filled with the pipette solution containing ( mmol / l ) 140.0 kcl , 1.0 mgcl2 , 5.0 na2atp , 5.0 egta , 10.0 hepes ( ph 7.2 ) .
cells were held at - 50 mv and whole - cell k + currents were evoked by voltage steps from - 60 mv to + 80 mv by 10 - mv stepwise depolarizing pulses .
bkca currents were recorded with continuous perfusion of hepes - buffered physiologic salt solution containing 5 mmol / l 4 - aminopyridine ( 4 - ap ) that block voltage - gated k + channels .
the k + currents were normalized to cell capacitance and were expressed as picoampere per picofarad ( pa / pf ) .
data analysis results were expressed as means +/ - sem obtained from the number ( n ) of experimental animals given .
concentration - response curves were analyzed by computer - assisted nonlinear regression to fit the data using graphpad prism ( graphpad software , san diego , ca ) to obtain pd2 ( - log ec50 ) and the maximum response ( emax ) .
differences were evaluated for statistical significance ( p < 0.05 ) by anova or t - test , where appropriate .
results chronic hypoxia increased hif - 1alpha expression hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 ( hif - 1 ) is a key transcription factor for response to low oxygen .
in order to determine whether chronic hypoxia had direct effect on uterine vascular function , we measured hif - 1alpha protein expression in uterine artery .
as shown in figure 1 , chronic hypoxia significantly enhanced hif - 1alpha protein levels in both pregnant and nonpregnant uterine arteries as compared with the control ones .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0073731.g001 figure 1 effect of chronic hypoxia on hif - 1alpha protein expression in uterine arteries .

chronic hypoxia upregulated nox2 expression and total nox activity nox is a major source of ros generation in the vasculature .
among 7 isoforms of the nox family , nox1 , nox2 , and nox4 predominantly expressed in the vasculature , and play an important role in the regulation of vascular function .
to determine whether chronic hypoxia affects the nox expression in uterine arteries , protein abundance of nox1 , nox2 , and nox4 was determined in uterine arteries of both normoxic and hypoxic animals using western blotting analysis .
as shown in figure 3a , chronic hypoxia had no significant effect on nox1 and nox4 protein expression , but significantly increased nox2 protein abundance in uterine arteries of pregnant sheep .
in contrast , none of the three nox isoforms were significantly altered by chronic hypoxia in uterine arteries of nonpregnant animals ( figure 3b ) .

inhibition of ros abolished hypoxia - enhanced pkc - mediated contractions previous studies have demonstrated that pkc plays an important role in pressure - dependent myogenic response of resistance uterine arteries , and chronic hypoxia significantly increased pkc - mediated myogenic reactivity in uterine arteries of pregnant sheep [ 7 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 29 ] .
as shown in figure 6 , pdbu - induced contractions of uterine arteries of pregnant sheep were significantly increased in animals acclimatized to long - term high altitude hypoxia , as compared with the control animals ( emax : 66.1 +/ - 2.5 % versus 39.7 +/ - 3.1 % , p < 0.05 ) .
apocynin had no significant effect on pdbu - induced contractions in normoxic pregnant sheep ( emax : 45.0 +/ - 5.6 % versus 39.7 +/ - 3.1 % , p > 0.05 ) , but significantly decreased the pdbu - induced maximal response in hypoxic animals ( emax : 46.9 +/ - 1.5 % versus 66.1 +/ - 2.5 % , p < 0.05 ) .
in the presence of apocynin , there was no significant difference in pdbu - induced contractions of uterine arteries in normoxic and hypoxic pregnant animals ( emax : 45.0 +/ - 5.6 % versus 46.9 +/ - 1.5 % , p > 0.05 ) .
in nonpregnant animals , neither hypoxia nor apocynin had significant effects on pdbu - induced contractions ( figure 6 ) .
similar results were obtained with a sod mimetic tempol ( figure 7 ) .

inhibition of ros reversed hypoxia - downregulated bkca channel activity our previous study demonstrated a functional link of the bkca channel in pregnancy - mediated downregulation of pkc and myogenic tone in uterine arteries [ 8 ] .
figure 8 shows the effect of apocynin on the bkca channel activity in uterine arterial myocytes of pregnant sheep .
consistent with the previous finding [ 14 ] , chronic hypoxia inhibited bkca channel activity and significantly decreased whole - cell k + currents in uterine arterial myocytes ( 55.3 +/ - 2.0 pa / pf versus 39.2 +/ - 0.9 pa / pf at + 80 mv , p < 0.05 ) .
apocynin had no effect on whole - cell k + currents in uterine arteries of normoxic animals ( 55.6 +/ - 2.4 pa / pf versus 55.3 +/ - 2.0 pa / pf at + 80 mv , p > 0.05 ) , but significantly increased k + currents in uterine arteries of animals acclimatized to long - term high altitude hypoxia ( 47.1 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf versus 39.2 +/ - 0.9 pa / pf at + 80 mv , p < 0.05 ) .
to further determine the specific effect of apocynin on bkca channel activity , the voltage - gated k + channel was blocked with 4 - aminopyridine .
in the presence of 4 - aminopyridine , whole - cell k + currents were decreased from 55.3 +/ - 2.0 pa / pf to 31.2 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf in normoxic animals , and from 39.2 +/ - 0.9 pa / pf to 18.9 +/ - 1.6 pa / pf in hypoxic animals , respectively , and the remaining k + currents represent mainly the component of bkca channels .
apocynin showed no effect on the bkca channel activity in normoxic animals ( 31.2 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf versus 32.3 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf at + 80 mv , p > 0.05 ) , but significantly increased it in hypoxic animals ( 26.5 +/ - 2.2 pa / pf versus 18.9 +/ - 1.6 pa / pf at + 80 mv , p < 0.05 ) .
whereas in the absence of apocynin , there was a significant decrease in the bkca channel activity in hypoxic ( 18.9 +/ - 1.6 pa / pf ) , as compared with the normoxic ( 32.3 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf ) animals ( p < 0.05 ) , in the presence of apocynin , there was no significant difference in the bkca channel activity between hypoxic ( 26.5 +/ - 2.2 pa / pf ) and normoxic ( 31.2 +/ - 1.5 pa / pf ) animals ( p > 0.05 ) .
neither hypoxia nor apocynin affected the bkca channel activity in uterine arterial myocytes of nonpregnant animals ( data not shown ) .

discussion the present study presents evidence for the first time that high - altitude chronic hypoxia during gestation enhanced uterine arterial ros production .
heightened ros generation coincided with an increase in nox2 protein expression in uterine arterial walls of pregnant animals. of importance , the hypoxia - induced impairment of bkca channel activity and increase in pkc - mediated myogenic reactivity of uterine arteries in pregnant animals were reversed by the inhibition of ros production and / or removal of ros .
these findings provide functional evidence of a causative role of heightened oxidative stress in the maladaptation of uterine circulation caused by chronic hypoxia during gestation .
in the present study , our findings that chronic hypoxia increased hif - 1alpha expression in the uterine arteries , suggest that hypoxia can directly regulate uterine vascular molecular signaling pathways and vascular function .
the current findings that chronic hypoxia significantly enhanced ros production in uterine arteries during pregnancy , are consistent with previous findings in pulmonary arteries exposed to hypoxia [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
these observations suggest vascular smooth muscle cell can sensor low o2 concentration and signal hypoxic hif - 1 by release of ros , and support the notion that hypoxia causes vascular dysfunction due to an upregulation of ros levels in the vasculature .
ros consist of a diverse family of small molecules such as superoxide anion ( o2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide , and the enzyme nox is the primary generator of ros in blood vessels .
our present findings that chronic hypoxia significantly increased total nox activity in pregnant uterine arteries , further suggest that nox may be the major generator of ros and contribute to aberrant uterine arterial responses in sheep exposed to chronic hypoxia .
although nox1 , nox2 , and nox4 were expressed in uterine arteries , chronic hypoxia selectively up - regulated the expression of nox2 in pregnant animals .
this finding suggests that nox2 - derived ros may functionally attribute to chronic hypoxia - induced alterations of uterine myogenic reactivity and vascular tone .
furthermore , chronic hypoxia enhanced nox2 protein expression in uterine arterial walls only in pregnant but not in nonpregnant animals , suggesting that sex steroid hormones may participate in regulating nox2 gene expression .
indeed , nox expression in human endothelial cells was inhibited by estrogen [ 33 ] .
ovariectomy resulted in increased blood pressure and an enhanced oxidative stress in aorta of dahl salt - sensitive rats due to an increased expression of nox , which was rescued by estrogen supplementation [ 34 ] .
in addition , estrogen also regulates nox activity .
it was demonstrated that estrogen attenuated ischemic oxidative damage via an estrogen receptor alpha - mediated inhibition of nox activation [ 35 ] .
therefore , estrogen plays an important role in protecting the cardiovascular system against ros - mediated adverse impacts .
chronic hypoxia during gestation significantly suppressed the expression of estrogen receptor alpha in uterine arteries due to heightened promoter methylation [ 16 ] , [ 36 ] .
thus , the inhibition of estrogen on nox expression and / or activity in uterine arteries is likely to be removed by chronic hypoxia , leading to enhanced ros generation .
in the present study , we found that chronic hypoxia significantly enhanced nox2 ( gp91phox ) protein expression in uterine arteries of pregnant animals .
it has been shown that nox2 requires the assembly of at least five additional components for its activation [ 37 ] .
these additional proteins include the membrane - bound p22phox , which helps stabilize the nox proteins and the cytosolic proteins p47phox , p67phox , the small gtpase rac , and p40phox , which together modulate and lead to the activation of the nox enzyme .
recent studies have demonstrated that acute hypoxia significantly increases nox activity and translocation of p47phox protein to the plasma membrane in pulmonary arteries .
furthermore , deletion of p47phox gene attenuated hypoxia - induced nox activation and ros production in pulmonary arteries [ 38 ] .
these findings suggest that nox - associated subunits may play an important role in hypoxia - mediated ros production .
future studies are needed to further investigate the interaction among these nox - related proteins and their roles in chronic hypoxia - induced ros production and increased uterine vascular tone .
consistent with previous studies [ 7 ] , [ 29 ] , the present study demonstrated attenuation of pressure - induced myogenic tone of uterine arteries during pregnancy .
the mechanisms of pregnancy - mediated decrease in the uterine myogenic tone are not fully understood .
myogenic tone is an intrinsic property of the smooth muscle and is independent of neural , metabolic , and endothelial influences .
nonetheless , myogenic tone can be modified by different physiological and pathological factors .
our previous study revealed that steroid hormones and upregulated downstream signaling pathways coupled to the hormones during pregnancy played a key role in the attenuated myogenic tone of uterine artery [ 29 ] .
the present finding that inhibition of ros generation did not alter pressure - induced myogenic reactivity of uterine arteries in both nonpregnant and pregnant sheep of normoxic animals ( data not shown ) suggests that basal ros levels may not contribute to the regulation of uterine vascular tone under physiological conditions .
however , elevated levels of ros resulted in vascular complications in diabetes mellitus and inhibition of ros production reversed the heightened myogenic tone in diabetic cerebral artery [ 39 ] , suggesting that increased ros may contribute to altered vascular myogenic tone under pathophysiological conditions .
this notion was supported by our findings that the inhibition of enhance ros generation resulted in attenuation of pressure - induced myogenic tone of uterine arteries in pregnant animals acclimatized to long - term high altitude hypoxia .
the finding that ros inhibition abrogated the difference in uterine arterial myogenic tone between normoxic and hypoxic pregnant animals suggests a major causative role of increased ros production in the heightened uterine arterial myogenic tone in response to chronic hypoxia .
further evidence comes from the finding that the inhibition of ros production and / or removal of ros abolished hypoxia - induced up - regulation of pkc - mediated myogenic constriction of uterine arteries in pregnant animals .
previous studies demonstrated that down - regulation of pkc significantly contributed to the reduced myogenic tone of uterine arteries during pregnancy , which was abrogated by chronic hypoxia [ 7 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 29 ] .
the present finding that enhanced uterine myogenic vasoconstriction induced by pkc activation in hypoxic pregnant animals was abolished by a nox inhibitor apocynin or a sod mimetic tempol , re - enforces the notion that hypoxia - mediated ros production is a cause of heightened myogenic reactivity of uterine arteries in pregnant animals .
a possible mechanism of ros - induced increase in uterine arterial myogenic reactivity is via inhibition of the bkca channel activity .
bkca channels play a key role in regulating myogenic tone of uterine arteries in pregnancy , as well as in response to chronic hypoxia [ 8 ] , [ 14 ] .
chronic hypoxia during gestation selectively impaired bkca channel activity in uterine arteries of pregnant animals [ 14 ] .
the present study demonstrated that inhibition of ros by apocynin reversed the chronic hypoxia - induced suppression of bkca channel activity in uterine arteries of pregnant animals , providing a mechanistic link of the bkca channel between the elevated oxidative stress and heightened myogenic tone in uterine arteries of pregnant animals acclimatized to long - term high altitude hypoxia .
inhibition of the bkca channel activity by ros has also been observed in recombinant expressing systems , vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells [ 40 ] - [ 44 ] .
ros likely exert their inhibitory effect on bkca channels by targeting a cysteine residue near the ca2 + - bowl of the bkca channel alpha subunit to alter ca2 + sensing [ 43 ] .
perspectives chronic hypoxia during gestation increases incidence of preeclampsia and fetal intrauterine growth restriction due to maladaptation of the uteroplacental circulation .
however , mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood .
heightened oxidative stress is associated with a variety of pathophysiological conditions including preeclampsia .
the present study demonstrates that chronic hypoxia during gestation upregulates nox2 expression in uterine arteries leading to increased ros production , which in turn results in suppressed bkca channel activity and increased uterine arterial myogenic tone .
thus , the present finding provides a mechanistic understanding of heightened oxidative stress in maladaptation of the uteroplacental circulation associated with chronic hypoxia during gestation , and may shed light on a causative factor in pathophysiology of preeclampsia .

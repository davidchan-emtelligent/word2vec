objective : to present self - assessments of knowledge about mechanical ventilation made by final - year medical students , residents , and physicians taking qualifying courses at the brazilian society of internal medicine who work in urgent and emergency settings .
methods : a 34 - item questionnaire comprising different areas of knowledge and training in mechanical ventilation was given to 806 medical students , residents , and participants in qualifying courses at 11 medical schools in brazil .
the questionnaire 's self - assessment items for knowledge were transformed into scores .
results : the average score among all participants was 21 % ( 0 - 100 %). of the total , 85 % respondents felt they did not receive sufficient information about mechanical ventilation during medical training .
additionally , 77 % of the group reported that they would not know when to start noninvasive ventilation in a patient , and 81 % , 81 % , and 89 % would not know how to start volume control , pressure control and pressure support ventilation modes , respectively .
furthermore , 86.4 % and 94 % of the participants believed they would not identify the basic principles of mechanical ventilation in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome , respectively , and would feel insecure beginning ventilation .
finally , 77 % said they would fear for the safety of a patient requiring invasive mechanical ventilation under their care .
conclusion : self - assessment of knowledge and self - perception of safety for managing mechanical ventilation were deficient among residents , students and emergency physicians from a sample in brazil .
artificial respiration medical education emergency medicine introduction mechanical ventilation is an expensive intervention with high morbidity and mortality , and the complexity of the procedure requires a specially trained working team 1,2 .
the manner in which mechanical ventilation is applied affects both primary and secondary patient outcomes 3 - 5 , and best practices are not consistently applied 6 .
this inadequacy is partially due to the lack of proper training received by physicians in mechanical ventilation 7 .
even when inadequate mechanical ventilation practices are used for only brief periods , hospital stays are often prolonged , and patients can experience mechanical ventilation - induced injuries 8 - 10 .
these consequences are becoming increasingly common across various hospital departments 11,12 .
exacerbating the situation , many physicians with no formal training in mechanical ventilation end up managing critically ill patients undergoing this intervention 13 - 16 .
we conducted a cross - sectional , descriptive study wherein final - year medical students , residents and physicians who work in emergency rooms in brazil were asked to assess their knowledge about mechanical ventilation .
methods following approval by the ethics and research committee of universidade federal de sao paulo ( unifesp ) , an observational , cross - sectional , descriptive study was conducted in which final - year medical students , residents , and emergency physicians were asked to assess their knowledge about mechanical ventilation through a 34 - question semi - structured questionnaire ( appendix 1 ) .
in the first phase , a committee was formed by the main investigator , four physicians who specialize in adult intensive care , a pulmonologist , and a professor of graduate and post - graduate courses at the medical school of unifesp to create the questionnaire .
standardization was achieved using delphi 's technique , which was used to define the content needed to describe competent practice of mechanical ventilation .
this version of the questionnaire contained 56 items on the following topics : learning objectives 17 , respiratory physiology ( mechanics ) , ventilation modes , patient - ventilator interactions , noninvasive ventilation , mechanical ventilation in ( copd ) and ( ards ) , and mechanical ventilation weaning .
in the second phase , a pilot project was carried out with sixth - year students from unifesp and intensive care senior physicians .
following this , adjustments in the wording of the questions were made , and certain items were excluded or included based on observations from the first phase .
the final revision of the questionnaire contained 34 items .
the third phase of the study occurred from from august 2013 to july 2015 and focused on data collection .
during this phase , questionnaires and informed consent forms were sent to students and coordinators of 24 institutions .
individuals from the following eleven institutions agreed to participate : school of medicine of the city of fernandopolis , school of medical sciences of the state of minas gerais , school of medicine of unichristus , federal university of the state of paraiba , school of medicine of uniceuma , santa casa de ribeirao preto , federal university of the state of piaui , school of medicine of the city of pouso alegre , school of medicine of the city of blumenau , unievangelica of the city of anapolis , federal university of the state of minas gerais and federal university of the state of sao paulo ( unifesp ) .
other participants in the study were emergency physicians enrolled in courses at the brazilian society of internal medicine and the brazilian association of urgency and emergency : vmurgem ( mechanical ventilation in emergency services ) , located in the cities of fortaleza , juazeiro do norte , belo horizonte , juiz de fora , porto alegre , sao paulo , camboriu and teresina .
these participants were physicians working in emergency services who were not residents or in a residency program , were not students and did not work in the icu .
the distribution of the participants by employment is shown in table 1 .
the questionnaires were distributed to 1251 individuals only after the coordinators of the various programs confirmed their interest in participating .
the questionnaires were considered complete when more than 32 questions were answered .
all physicians selected from the training courses agreed to participate in the survey directly through the main investigator .
the remaining questionnaires were distributed only after agreement to participate by the program coordinator .
after the participants assessed their knowledge , scores were created based on their answers .
all answers that were considered positive according to self - perceived knowledge or that had positively contributed to self - perceived knowledge were summed and converted into a percentage with the same individual weight ( 0 - 100 %) .
the study used spss ( statistical package for social sciences ) , version 21.0 for data analysis .
the responses of all participants for each item were described .
scores among the categories were compared using the kruskal - wallis nonparametric statistical test .
spearman 's correlation analysis was used to correlate the year of medical residency with the questionnaire score .
results a total of 806 questionnaires were completed and included in the study .
the respondents included 448 students ( 56 %) , 103 first - year residents ( 13 %) , 96 second - year residents ( 12 %) , 32 third - year residents ( 4 %) and 127 emergency physicians ( 16 %) .
the mean score across all categories for the physicians who answered the questionnaire was 21 % ( table 1 ). of all the participants , 720 ( 89 %) felt that they did not receive sufficient information during training to manage a patient on mechanical ventilation .
additionally , 46 % felt that there was a lack of professionals available for teaching , 69 % ( 546 ) said that they would have difficulty turning on a ventilator , and 77 % ( 621 ) stated they would fear for the safety of a patient if they had to start mechanical ventilation ( figure 1 ) .
regarding the specific skills needed to initiate mechanical ventilation , 77 % said that they would not know how to begin non - invasive ventilation in a patient , and 81 % , 81 % and 89 % said they would not be able to start pressure - controlled ventilation ( pcv ) , volume - controlled ventilation ( vcv ) , or pressure support ventilation ( psv ) , respectively ( tables 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
regarding patient monitoring , 79 % did not feel able to deliver adequate sedation to patients , 85 % had never used a pain scale , and 89 % , and 88 % did not feel able to set alarms or to properly react when facing patient - ventilator asynchrony .
additionally , 59 % stated they would start ventilation based on a patient 's weight in kilograms , and 82 % said they would not feel capable of conducting ventilation weaning .
furthermore , 86 % of the participants felt incapable of starting mechanical ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and 94 % said they would not know how to start ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome .
regarding respiratory monitoring , 84 % , 93 % , 87 % , 85 % and 92 % were not aware of the concepts of resistance , compliance , time constant , plateau pressure and driving pressure , respectively .
additionally , 83 % were not aware of the concept of auto - peep , and 96 % would not know how to estimate it at bedside .
the overall mean score of the participants was 21 % .
performance by category is shown in table 1 .
there was a significant difference between the different groups ( p = 0.0001 ) .
comparing the groups , the poorest performance was found among students ( 17 %) .
first - year residents and physicians working in emergency services showed similar self - assessment scores of 21 % and 22 % ( p = 0.52 ) , while second - year residents had a mean score of 31 % and third - year residents a mean score of 45 % .
the third - year residents felt more secure in their knowledge regarding mechanical ventilation compared with the other groups ( r3 , 71.0 % ; students , 15.0 % ; r2 , 36.1 % ; r1 , 16.0 % ; physicians , 34.6 % ; p < 0,0001 ) ( figure 1 ) .
discussion the present study evaluated the self - assessed knowledge of mechanical ventilation held by various groups of physicians .
few studies have evaluated this topic using validated instruments 18 .
studies performed in residency training centers for emergency services have typically revealed that there are no specific educational programs regarding mechanical ventilation 19 - 21 .
in brazil , there is no emergency medicine specialty , and most physicians working in this area of health are relatively recent graduates ( having graduated less than five years before entering the field ) .
as such , they have not received any specific training in mechanical ventilation 22 .
the average scores among the different assessed categories were very low .
the average overall knowledge score did not exceed 45 % in any group .
the best scores were found for third - year physicians training in internal medicine , but their average score was still only 45 % .
the knowledge scores for first - year residents and emergency physicians were similar , at 21 % and 22 % , respectively ( p = 0.52 ) .
most students ( 77 %) had never handled an artificial ventilator , and 45 % indicated that there was a lack of specialists available to teach this subject in the programs they attended .
ventilation strategies for setting tidal volume , peep , and opening airway pressure and the monitoring of auto - peep , plateau pressure , driving pressure and peak pressure can affect mortality 23 - 27 and cause mechanical ventilation - induced injury 28,29 .
only 14.8 % of the respondents indicated they knew how to measure plateau pressure at bedside , 93 % rated themselves as not knowledgeable of the concept of driving pressure , and 6.3 % reported not knowing how to calculate static compliance .
mechanical ventilation is used to manage patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 22,30 , severe acute asthma 31 and acute respiratory distress syndrome 32,33 .
most physicians stated they did not know the principles for applying ventilation to these patients : 87 % did not know how to manage mechanical ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients , and 94 % did not know how to manage it for acute respiratory distress syndrome patients .
noninvasive mechanical ventilation can reduce the mortality of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and severe respiratory failure 34 , acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema 35 , and other emergent respiratory acute cases .
despite this , 77.2 % of the physicians in training , active physicians , and medical students surveyed in this work did not know how to initiate the intervention .
in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation , evaluation and treatment with sedation and analgesia should be routinely performed 36 .
this systematic evaluation of the level of sedation and pain should be performed with the aid of behavioral 37 - 39 and sedation 40,41 scales adapted and translated into portuguese .
such monitoring decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation , reduces nosocomial infections , and lessens the incidence of pain and agitation 42. of all the respondents , 86 % had never used a pain assessment scale during training or in their professional work , and 79 % did not feel able to administer sedation and analgesia to mechanically ventilated patients .
delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation lengthens the duration of mechanical ventilation and increases mortality 43,44 .
several factors 45 have been reported to increase the success of this process , but 83 % of the study participants reported not knowing the principles involved .
knowledge concerning conventional modes of mechanical ventilation , namely , pcv , vcv , and psv , was very low in the sample , as was knowledge regarding ventilation strategies for special situations such as in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute respiratory distress syndrome. of the third - year residents , who had the highest overall scores , 52 % expressed that they would be able to ventilate an obstructive patient , whereas only 22 % felt able to ventilate a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome .
increased exposure time to mechanical ventilation during training increased the feeling of confidence .
unfortunately , there is no formal program for teaching this subject in medical school , which might explain the low scores .
in intensive care practice , 70 % of adverse events related to mechanical ventilation are related to human errors 46 .
as there are reports that adverse events are underreported among active physicians and residents in clinical practice 47,48 , it is likely that this value is even higher in the field of emergency service .
in our sample , 29.9 % of respondents had never handled an artificial ventilator , and 60.9 % thought they would have difficulty even turning such a device on. furthermore , 80 % did not know what a regulating or reducing valve was , and 89 % did not know any technical standards for using medical gases .
this implies the need to develop educational programming for risk management among training and active physicians .
limitations one limitation to the present study is the use of a questionnaire for self - assessment of knowledge rather than a direct measure of competence in mechanical ventilation .
furthermore , our use of convenience sampling among participants with heterogeneous characteristics may have influenced our results .
it is possible that scores were underestimated due to the greater likelihood of residents , students and physicians with low levels of knowledge regarding mechanical ventilation refusing to participate in the study .
the level of knowledge about various components of mechanical ventilation was low among the participants in the sample .
specifically , there was a low level of knowledge about respiratory mechanics , conventional modes , monitoring , strategies for special situations , and weaning from mechanical ventilation .
the participants also felt that teaching about mechanical ventilation in medical school and in medical residency programs was lacking .
additional studies evaluating competence in using mechanical ventilation among training and active physicians are needed .
our results indicate the need for a dedicated medical education program for mechanical ventilation for all medical students and an extended training program for physicians practicing emergency care .

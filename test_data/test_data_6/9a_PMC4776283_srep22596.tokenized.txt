here , we isolated a non - antibacterial metabolite from the culture fluid of b. heleia pak1 - 2 that was able to suppress b. plantarii virulence and subsequently identified as indole - 3 - acetic acid ( iaa ) .
iaa suppressed the production of tropolone in b. plantarii in a dose - dependent manner without any antibacterial and quorum quenching activity , suggesting that iaa inhibited steps of tropolone biosynthesis .
consistent with this , supplementing cultures of b. plantarii with either l - [ ring - 2h5 ] phenylalanine or [ ring - 2h2 ~ 5 ] phenylacetic acid revealed that phenylacetic acid ( paa ) , which is the dominant metabolite during the early growth stage , is a direct precursor of tropolone .
exposure of b. plantarii to iaa suppressed production of both paa and tropolone .
these data particularly showed that iaa produced by b. heleia pak1 - 2 disrupts tropolone production during bioconversion of paa to tropolone via the ring - rearrangement on the phenyl group of the precursor to attenuate the virulence of b. plantarii. b. heleia pak1 - 2 is thus likely a microbial community coordinating bacterium in rhizosphere ecosystems , which never eliminates phytopathogens but only represses production of phytotoxins or bacteriocidal substances .
troponoids are a unique group of natural products containing a seven - membered aromatic ring with various substitutions1234 .
these compounds have various bioactivities , including antiviral , antitumor , antioxidant , anti - inflammatory , and insecticidal effects4 .
tropolone , which is produced by burkholderia plantarii , is the phytotoxin responsible for rice seedling blight5 .
this was demonstrated when treatment only with exogenous tropolone was able to phenocopy b. plantarii infestation , which manifests as chlorosis , shoot - stunting , and root inhibition67 .
the potent iron - chelating property of tropolone not only accounts for its broad - spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi8 but also contributes to its virulence and the symptoms associated with the onset of bacterial rice seedling blight69 .
when this phytotoxin accumulates in culture fluid , or is exogenously added to the culture medium , it triggers production of extracellular polysaccharide by bacteria10 .
despite its key role in virulence , the tropolone biosynthetic pathway in b. plantarii remains unclear .
in phytopathogenic eubacteria , production of virulence factors is often under the control of a sophisticated regulatory system11121314 .
in several human - pathogenic burkholderia species , virulence factors , including capsular polysaccharide i15 , helicase inhibitor16 , and actin polymerization bimabm gene17 are regulated by quorum - sensing molecules181920 .
we previously performed a screen to identify tropolone - and catechol - tolerant microbial isolates7 .
here , we screened 15 of these isolates for their efficacy as biocontrol agents against b. plantarii .
one of these isolates , burkholderia heleia pak1 - 2 , suppressed blight symptoms when topically applied to rice seedlings .
a thin - layer chromatography and nmr analysis - guided bioassay that monitors tropolone production identified a non - antibacterial metabolite , indole - 3 - acetic acid ( iaa ) , that was produced by b. heleia pak1 - 2 and alleviated b. plantarii virulence .
we show that iaa inhibits the metabolism of an intermediary compound in tropolone biosynthesis to prevent the ring re - arrangement required for the conversion of phenylacetic acid ( paa ) to tropolone .
results burkholderia heleia pak1 - 2 is a potent biocontrol agent that blocks b. plantarii - dependent rice seedling blight we determined that pak1 - 2 was an irregular rod - shaped gram - negative bacterium of class betaproteobacteria ; alignment of its 1.5 kbp 16s rrna gene sequence revealed homology with burkholderia species ( accession no. ab787501 ) .
phylogenetic analysis for the species identification was done using multiple - aligned sequences of burkholderia sp .
pak1 - 2 and other burkholderia species including some type - strains ( figure s1 ) .
accordingly , pak1 - 2 formed a small clade together with another burkholderia heleia strain ( nbrc 101817t ) 21 in the phylogenetic cluster of genus burkholderia .
this allowed us to positively identify pak1 - 2 as a b. heleia strain .
in the dual culture system , point - inoculated b. heleia pak1 - 2 showed a weak growth - inhibitory activity against b. plantarii ( figure s2 ) .
in addition , b. heleia pak1 - 2 significantly repressed the symptoms of blight on rice seedlings infested with b. plantarii .
the effective biocontrol properties of b. heleia pak1 - 2 in vivo were observable both in the shoots and in the roots ( fig. 1 ) .
in particular , rice seedlings inoculated with b. heleia pak1 - 2 had accelerated root growth and lateral root development even in the absence of b. plantarii infection .
inhibition of tropolone biosynthesis by iaa produced by b. heleia pak1 - 2 to isolate the active substance produced by b. heleia pak1 - 2 capable of inducing b. plantarii cellular responses , we performed semi - quantification of tropolone production in b. plantarii that was exposed to fractionated metabolites of b. heleia pak1 - 2 .
in contrast to untreated cells , production of tropolone by b. plantarii was repressed by fractions obtained by silica gel column chromatography ( see materials and methods ) at 100 mug disc - 1 ( fig. 2a ) , and we established that this was linked to repression of cell growth ( fig. 2b,c ) .
however , we were unable to obtain reproducible production of any growth - inhibitory compounds from large - scale cultures of b. heleia. by contrast , fraction 2 did not repress b. plantarii growth , but retained the ability to inhibit tropolone production ( fig. 2c ) .
the active chemical compound in fraction 2 was subsequently identified as iaa ( table s1 ) .
in support of this , tropolone production was inhibited in monocultures of b. plantarii directly supplemented with exogenous iaa ; this occurred in the absence of effects on cell growth ( fig. 2b ) .
tropolone production of b. plantarii is under the control of the n - acyl - l - homoserine lactone ( ahl ) - qs regulatory system10 .
therefore , we evaluated whether iaa - dependent repression of tropolone production was due to its modulation of the b. plantarii ahl - qs - associated genes , plai and plar ( figure s3 ) .
because iaa did not elicit any statistically significant repression of both plai and plar transcription , it was concluded that iaa does not disrupt ahl - qs in b. plantarii .
identification of phenyl acetic acid produced by b. plantarii at the early growth stage b. plantarii shake - cultured for 24 h yielded a mixture of ethyl acetate ( etoac ) - soluble secondary metabolites , which were subjected to 1h - nmr and ms analyses for metabolic profiling as described by clarke and haselden22 .
in direct electron impact ionization ( ei ) - ms , tropylium cation ( m / z 91 ) appeared as the base fragment and the parent ion was predicted at m / z 136 ( figure s4a ) , whereas direct field ionization ( fi ) - ms gave a molecular ion ( m +) peak at m / z 136 as the base peak ( figure s4b ) .
in gc - ms analysis of the metabolite mixture , the most dominant peak was detected at tr 4.19 min in the total ion chromatographic profile ( figure s4c ) .
for this main peak , ei for gc - ms showed a molecular ion at m / z 136 ([ m ]+ , 31 %) and tropylium cation at m / z 91 ([ m - cooh ]+ , 100 %) ( figure s4d ) consistent with phenylacetic acid ( paa ) reported by kim et al.23 ( 2004 ) .
in addition , the dominant compound gave the molecular ion ([ m ]+) peak at m / z 136 by gc - ms under fi mode ( figure s4e ) .
1h - nmr spectrum of the etoac soluble mixture also showed aromatic proton and equivalent methylene proton signals , assignable to the phenyl group and the c2 methylene moiety of paa ( figure s5 ) .
the most dominant metabolite produced at the early culture stage was thus identified as paa .
linkage of tropolone biosynthesis to accumulation of phenylacetic acid gc - ms and nmr - based metabolic profiling showed that , before the appearance of tropolone , paa was the major metabolite produced by b. plantarii during the exponential phase ( fig. 3a ) .
further quantitative analysis for paa in the medium supplemented with l - phenylalanine revealed that paa production by b. plantarii was sustained over 24 h , where it reached a maximum concentration of 895.3 mum .
however , paa levels decreased significantly in cultures beyond 24 h and fell to 2 % ( 13.2 mum ) of the maximum by 72 h. concomitant with the rapid decrease of paa , tropolone production accelerated robustly beginning at 24 h and reached its maximum level ( 763.9 mum ) at 60 h ( fig. 3a ) .
tropolone production dose - dependently increased when b. plantarii was fed with 0.5 - 2 mm paa ( fig. 3b ) .
together , these qualitative and quantitative data reveal a close link between upstream paa production and downstream tropolone production , and strongly suggest that paa is the direct precursor of tropolone .
paa can be derived from shikimic acid or via an oxidative decarboxylation - coupled deamination of l - phenylalanine .
therefore , conversion of l - phenylalanine to tropolone via paa by b. plantarii was also confirmed by supplementing medium containing the phytopathogen with l - phenylalanine instead of paa ( fig. 3c ) .
however , paa induced greater tropolone production than that observed with l - phenylalanine at the same concentration ( 2 mm ) .
after growth in pd broth media supplemented with l - phenylalanine - [ ring - 2h5 ] for 36 h , the paa produced was extracted from the acidified culture fluid .
paa - [ ring - 2h5 ] from labelled l - phenylalanine and non - deuterated paa from l - phenylalanine or shikimate originally in the medium or biosynthesized by b. plantarii from ingredients in the plain medium were present in a ratio of 3.6:1 ( calculated from the relative peak intensity in fi - ms spectrum ) ( fig. 4 ) .
the incorporation rate of l - [ ring - 2h5 ] phenylalanine into paa was 78.3 % .
further incorporation of deuterium atoms of [ ring - 2h5 ] paa into tropolone led to tropolone - d4 and tropolone - d3 with a ratio of 1.6:1 .
these data are consistent with paa being the direct precursor of tropolone .
treatment of paa with tfod yielded a mixture of deuterated paa with 2 - and 5 - substituted deuterium atoms on the benzene ring .
gc - ms / ms analysis revealed that a mixture of [ ring - 2h2 - 5 ] paa was converted by b. plantarii to tropolone - d2 ~ 4 ( figure s6 ) .
this experiment provided evidence that paa is the direct precursor of tropolone in b. plantarii .
the absence of one deuterium on the labelled tropolone molecule may indicate that the benzene ring is rearranged concomitantly with an aromatic proton exchange .
interference of the tropolone biosynthetic pathway of b. plantarii by indole - 3 - acetic acid and its analogous compounds in the presence of 500 mum iaa , paa levels decreased from 980 mum to 240 mum , representing 76 % repression of paa production ( lc50 = ca. 125 mum ) ( fig. 5a ) .
iaa likely prevents the metabolism of l - phenylalanine , but it is also likely that the suppression of decarboxylation - coupled deamination on l - phenylalanine by iaa is not the main mode of action in the inhibition of tropolone production by b. plantarii .
conversely , 500 mum iaa prevented 92 % of tropolone production ( lc50 = ca .
90 mum ) , mainly from paa , showing that the repressive effect of iaa against tropolone production is mediated through inhibition of the rearrangement of the benzene ring of paa into a seven - membered tropolone ring ( fig. 5b ) .
neither indole nor a series of the other indolic analogues tested suppressed paa production by b. plantarii cells , whereas tropolone production was slightly repressed upon exposure to the indole derivatives , except for iaa .
iaa reduced tropolone levels by two fold .
cell growth of b. plantarii was unaffected by the indole derivatives , including iaa ( figure s7 ) .
interference of the tropolone biosynthetic pathway of b. plantarii by paa analogues in the paper disk assay using pd agar medium impregnated with b. plantarii cells , paa analogues were loaded on a paper disk as 10 mul of each 1 mum solution or the respective diluted solutions .
among the paa analogues tested , p - tolylacetic acid , ( r ) - ( - ) - 2 - methylphenylpropionic acid , and ( p - isopropylphenyl ) acetic acid inhibited tropolone production as effectively as iaa at the same concentration ( fig. 6 ) .
discussion iaa is a well - known pro - growth plant phytohormone that induces cell division and lateral root development24 .
here , we show that iaa is a non - antibacterial diffusible component that blocks tropolone synthesis and suppresses rice seedling blight disease .
this finding reveals that iaa is not simply a hormone but actually a key mediator between plant and tropolone - producing b. plantarii to regulate virulence of the phytopathogen .
this may be the mechanism by which indole suppresses shigatoxin production in escherichia coli25 .
based on a report on tropone biosynthesis in the marine bacterium phaeobacter gallaeciensis , class alphaproteobacteria26 , we investigated the mechanism by which iaa interferes with tropolone production .
paa is an aromatic metabolite that is produced when b. plantarii are fed l - phenylalanine , and it accumulates in the culture fluid27 .
paa production by b. plantarii is thus directly linked to tropolone production , and levels of paa were particularly elevated in pd broth cultures in the present study ( fig. 5 ) .
the main carbon source in pd broth medium is glucose , whereas the nitrogen source is a mixture of amino acids primarily composed of non - aromatic l - leucine , l - aspartic acid , l - glutamic acid , and l - glutamine ; only a minor amount of aromatic amino acids , i.e. , l - phenylalanine and l - tyrosine , is present2829 .
we also confirmed production of paa by b. plantarii in minimum salt medium9 ( data not shown ) .
therefore , we attribute the high productivity of paa in b. plantarii to an active shikimate pathway30 along with decarboxylation - coupled deamination of exogenous l - phenylalanine31 , suggesting that paa is the direct precursor of tropolone .
feeding experiments using deuterium - labelled l - phenylalanine showed that l - phenylalanine is effectively converted to not only deuterium - labelled paa but also deuterium - labelled tropolone ( fig. 4 ) .
furthermore , direct feeding of deuterium - labelled paa to b. plantarii led to incorporation of deuterium on the phenyl group into the tropolone seven - membered ring ( figure s6 ) .
thus , tropolone biosynthesis in b. plantarii involves bioconversion of paa to tropolone via an aromatic ring - rearrangement .
this process is similar to the steps in the biosynthetic pathway of a tropolone - type metabolite , tropodithietic acid , in p. gallaeciensis ( e.g. , transamination and oxidative decarboxylation of phenylalanine to paa ) 26 .
paa production in p. gallaeciensis was not observed when it was cultured in medium containing no l - phenylalanine , suggesting that l - phenylalanine is the most important precursor of paa in p. gallaeciensis30 .
the reason why four but not five carbons were labelled in tropolone converted from [ ring - 2h5 ] - paa remains unclear ; however , the mechanisms of ring rearrangement should be investigated in future studies by using 13c - labeled paa at the c2 - position .
exposure of b. plantarii to iaa during the exponential phase of culture growth suppressed paa production , whereas iaa more effectively decreased paa - derived tropolone production ( fig. 5 ) .
iaa is structurally analogous to paa and acts as a competitive inhibitor mainly against ring rearrangement on paa for conversion into tropolone .
iaa produced by the potent antagonistic bacterium b. heleia against bacterial rice blight disease thus demonstrated disturbance of virulence - associated phytotoxin production by the bacterial pathogen without any antibacterial mode of action .
these data suggest that iaa - mediated biological and chemical control strategies against virulence of b. plantarii via tropolone production could attenuate symptom development and restore growth and extension of the roots .
similarly , iaa is known as the mediator of attenuation of potato tuber lesions by fusarium solani f. sp. eumartii , where activity of the chymotrypsin - like fusarium extracellular serine protease was shown to be dose - dependently inhibited by exogenous iaa without any fungal growth repression32 .
in summary , the insight that we have provided into microbial interspecies interaction in the rhizosphere ecosystem may lead to the development of novel biocontrol agents .
such agents may reduce the symptoms caused by phytopathogens while allowing them to survive and contribute to a well - balanced rhizosphere ecosystem .

( tokyo , japan ) .
thirteen bacterial species previously screened from the rice rhizosphere as tolerable to 10 mm catechol7 were tested for biocontrol efficacy against rice seedling blight .
all of the bacterial species were routinely grown at 25 degreesc in the dark in potato dextrose ( pd ) broth ( ph 6.2 ) either statically or with agitation at 110 rpm .
alternatively , cultures were grown on a pd agar plate that was solidified with 1.5 % agar ( wako , osaka , japan ) .
biocontrol test against bacterial rice seedling blight seeds of rice ( oryza sativa var .
japonica cv. koshihikari ) surface - sterilized with 0.5 % hypochlorite and 70 % ethanol were subjected to inoculation with b. plantarii by means of soaking in 10 ml of b. plantarii cell suspension ( 103 colony forming units ( cfu ) ml - 1 ) in petri dishes .
for treatment with test bacteria , the seeds were simultaneously inoculated with 50 mul of the bacterial cell suspension ( 106 cfu ml - 1 ) and antagonistic efficacy was evaluated .
surface - sterilized rice seeds infested with b. plantarii only ( control ) or the testing bacterium only were also prepared along with those that were not inoculated with bacteria .
all of the rice seeds were incubated , transplanted , and subsequently cultivated as previously described10 .
after 5 d of cultivation , the length of shoots and roots and the appearance or abrogation of symptoms such as discoloration of the shoot were measured .
metabolic changes of b. plantarii following co - culture with b. heleia pak1 - 2 b. heleia pak1 - 2 was point - inoculated at the centre of a pd agar plate impregnated with b. plantarii cells as previously described10 .
after 3 - d incubation , colony morphology was observed under a light microscope ( olympus ix70 , tokyo , japan ) .
plain pd agar plates point - inoculated with b. plantarii only or b. heleia only were used as controls .
pd broth medium inoculated with b. plantarii and b. heleia pak1 - 2 ( both at 103 cfu ml - 1 ) or b. plantarii only ( for control ) was quantitatively monitored for tropolone production .
after 72 - h - shake - culturing , the culture fluid was subjected to solid - phase extraction and hplc .
tropolone production assay using b. plantarii - cell - impregnated agar plates pd - agar medium containing 0.1 mm feso4 and viable cells of b. plantarii were prepared for bioassay to identify tropolone production inhibitors as follows : pd broth medium supplemented with 1.0 % agar was autoclaved at 120 degreesc for 20 min and cooled to below 50 degreesc ; then , 1 ml of 10 mm feso4 solution filtered through a sterile membrane ( 0.4 mum cellulose acetate , millipore , darmstadt , germany ) was added and mixed well .
the liquefied pd agar mixed well with the cell suspension of pre - cultured burkholderia plantarii ( 10 ml of bacterial cell suspension as 106cfu ml - 1 ) was then cast on plastic petri plates ( bio - bik , ina - optika co. ltd , osaka , japan ) .
this agar medium impregnated with b. plantarii cells was used in the screening assay for inhibitors against production of tropolone .
for a more sensitive assay , winogradsky 's medium - based gellan plate ( 50 g l - 1 sucrose , 0.5 g l - 1 yeast extract , 10 g l - 1 gellan gum ) containing 0.1 mm feso4 was used instead .
a paper disk with a diameter of 9 mm and thickness of 0.5 mm , on which a solution of a test compound was loaded , was placed on a 9 - cm sterile petri plate containing 10 ml of medium .
in the test , paper disks that had absorbed 10 mul of a test compound solution at each concentration and then been air - dried were placed on the assay plates followed by incubation at 28 degreesc for 5 days .
when the test compounds showed inhibitory activity against tropolone production observed as tiny but visible particles of dark reddish precipitated crystals , the assay plate around the paper disc was visible as a turbid background area without any dark crystalline particles of tropolone because b. plantarii cell growth was permitted .
metabolic profiling of b. plantarii using 1h - nmr , gc and mass spectroscopy b. plantarii was inoculated into 50 ml of pd broth medium ( 103 cfu ml - 1 ) and shake - cultured for 24 h at 25 degreesc .
after removal of bacterial cells , the culture fluid was adjusted to ph 3.5 with 2 m sulphuric acid and extracted twice with 50 ml of etoac .
the organic layer was dried over anhydrous na2so4 , concentrated , and re - dissolved in etoac for metabolic profiling according to the method described by clarke and haselden22 .
a half portion of the etoac solute was concentrated and re - dissolved in methanol - d4 for 1h - nmr analysis without any purification process .
the other half of the etoac solute was further concentrated to 100 mul , of which 0.2 mul was subjected to gc - ms analysis using agilent 7890a gc in combination with jms - sx - 102 ms spectrometer to obtain a gc profile of total ion chromatography .
the ei fragmentation pattern of the most dominant chemical component was recorded by the gc - ms analysis .
in parallel , the concentrated sample of the crude mixture was directly applied for fi - ms and ei - ms analyses .
isolation and identification of the b. heleia pak1 - 2 - derived compound iaa that represses tropolone production in b. plantarii to collect secondary metabolites produced by b. heleia pak1 - 2 , 3 ml of b. heleia pak1 - 2 cell suspension ( 106 cfu ml - 1 ) was inoculated into a 3 - l culture of pdb and shake - cultured for 3 d at 25 degreesc in the dark .
bacterial cells were separated by centrifugation at 8 500 x g for 10 min .
the culture fluid was passed through cosmosil 75c18 - opn ( 250 g , nacalai tesque , kyoto , japan ) on a buchner funnel previously conditioned with meoh ( 2 l ) followed by an excess of milli - q water ( 3 l ) .
after removal of the void water by vacuum , the substances trapped by the cosmosil particles were eluted with a sufficient volume of meoh ( 2 l ) .
the eluates ( 318 mg ) were concentrated and suspended in chloroform ; then , they were subjected to silica gel column chromatography ( 50 g , gf60 35 to 70 mesh , merck , darmstadt , germany ) by stepwise elution with 1 % to 100 % meoh in chloroform to obtain 10 fractions .
fractions exhibiting similar thin - layer chromatography profiles were combined to obtain three main fractions ( fractions 1 , 2 , and 3 for 5 - 20 % , 25 - 50 % , and 60 - 100 % meoh / chloroform respectively ) .
to search for active principles that repressed tropolone production , these fractionated metabolites were subjected to an agar diffusion assay on b. plantarii - impregnated pd agar containing 0.1 mm fecl310 .
physicochemical properties of the active principle isolated from fraction 2 are shown in table s1 .
identification and quantification of phenyl acetic acid produced by b. plantarii phenylacetic acid ( paa ) was identified as the main metabolite of b. plantarii in the early growth stage ( fig. 2 ) .
cultures of b. plantarii in pd broth medium were sampled at 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 60 and 72 h in a time - course experiment .
each culture was sampled ( 2 ml ) in triplicate and centrifuged at 8 500 x g for 10 min , and then the resulting supernatant ( 1.5 ml ) was then subjected to solid phase extraction with a preconditioned c18 cartridge of 200 mg resin ( sep - pak vac 3cc , waters , milford , ma , usa ) .
the resulting cartridge column was washed with water ( 3 ml ) , the water was voided , and then the column was eluted with methanol ( 3 ml ) .
the methanolic elutes were concentrated and re - dissolved in 150 mul of methanol , of which 10 mul was injected into an hplc system with an isocratic mobile phase of meoh : 10 mm phosphoric acid ( 85:15 ) and a photodiode array detector ( at 260 nm ) .
the retention time ( tr ) of paa was 3.9 min .
standard solutions ( 10 mul ) of paa ( 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 and 10 mm ) were also subjected to hplc for preparation of a paa standard curve .
this yielded an equation of y = 0.0001x - 0.216 ( r2 = 0.996 ) .
y = concentration of paa ( mm ) , x = absolute peak intensity of paa .
a conventional feeding experiment for tropolone production was performed for b. plantarii using pd broth media supplemented with l - phenylalanine at 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mm in triplicate at each concentration , and pd broth media containing exogenous paa at 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mm were run in triplicate .
after 36 h of shake - culture , each culture medium was also subjected to hplc analysis for quantification of tropolone production .
deuterium - labelled precursors and feeding experiments additional feeding experiments were performed using deuterium - labelled substrate candidates. b. plantarii was shake - cultured in 50 ml of pd broth medium supplemented with 2 mm commercially available l - phenylalanine - [ ring - 2h5 ] .
etoac extracts from the 36 - h - shake - cultured fluid were subjected to fi - ms analysis ( jeol jms - t100gcv ) without further purification .
deuterium - labelled paa was obtained by treatment of authentic paa ( 500 mg ) with tfod ( 6.5 ml , 20 equivalents ) at room temperature for 12 h according to a previously reported approach33 .
the reaction mixture was gently diluted in 50 ml of milli - q water and subjected to liquid - liquid partition with chloroform ( 50 ml , twice ) .
the organic layer was dried with anhydrous na2so4 , concentrated , re - dissolved in meoh and purified by agilent 218 preparative hplc to yield paa - [ ring - 2h2 - 5 ] ( 419 mg ) ( fig. 4 ) .
the mixture of deuterated paa was further added to pd broth media at ~ 1.4 mm ( 200 mg l - 1 ) for shake - culture of b. plantarii .
the culture fluid after 36 h of incubation was extracted with etoac ; concentrated substances were re - dissolved in etoac ( 100 mul ) and subjected to fi - ms and gc - ms / ms ( in 1 mul portions ) for detection of deuterated tropolone and qualitative analysis for the deuteration ratio .
gene expression analysis using quantitative real time - pcr for plai and plar genes associated with the ahls - qs system to investigate the mechanism by which tropolone production is repressed by iaa , we examined the expression of qs - associated genes , particularly those related with ahl .
to this end , b. plantarii was shake - cultured for 12 h in plain pd broth medium ( control ) or pd broth that contained iaa ( 200 mum ) and examined for expression of plai ( ahls synthase gene ) and plar ( ahls receptor gene ) using real - time quantitative reverse transcription pcr ( qrt - pcr ) .
isolation of total rna , digestion of the remaining genomic dna , cdna synthesis , and removal of remaining rna were sequentially conducted as reported previously10 , and qrt - pcr was performed in a steponeplus real - time pcr thermal cycling block ( applied biosystems , ca , usa ) .
specific - primers for the qrt - pcr were plai rt - forward ( 5 ' - gga aga cga aaa att cga g - 3 ')/ plai rt - reverse ( 5 ' - tac acc ggt atc gtc g - 3 ') ; plar rt - forward ( 5 ' - gag atc aac agc ctg ac - 3 ')/ plar rt - reverse ( 5 ' - agc gaa tgc gag aga t - 3 ') ; and rpod rt - forward ( 5 ' - cta caa gtc gaa gtc cta c - 3 ')/ rpod rt - reverse ( 5 ' - atc gac atc agt tcg ttc - 3 ') .
an initial step of 30 s at 95 degreesc followed by 30 cycles of 5 s at 95 degreesc , 30 s at 52 degreesc , and 1 min at 72 degreesc w performed .
fold changes in the expression of each target gene was calculated in comparison to those in the internal control gene rpod ( rna polymerase sigma factor rpod ) according to the 2 - deltadeltact method34 .

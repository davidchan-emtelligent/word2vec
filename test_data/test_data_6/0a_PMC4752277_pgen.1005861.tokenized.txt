temperate phages , the bacterial viruses able to enter in a dormant prophage state in bacterial genomes , are present in the majority of bacterial strains for which the genome sequence is available .
although these prophages are generally considered to increase their hosts' fitness by bringing beneficial genes , studies demonstrating such effects in ecologically relevant environments are relatively limited to few bacterial species .
here , we investigated the impact of prophage carriage in the gastrointestinal tract of monoxenic mice .
combined with mathematical modelling , these experimental results provided a quantitative estimation of key parameters governing phage - bacteria interactions within this model ecosystem .
we used wild - type and mutant strains of the best known host / phage pair , escherichia coli and phage lambda .
unexpectedly , lambda prophage caused a significant fitness cost for its carrier , due to an induction rate 50 - fold higher than in vitro , with 1 to 2 % of the prophage being induced .
however , when prophage carriers were in competition with isogenic phage susceptible bacteria , the prophage indirectly benefited its carrier by killing competitors : infection of susceptible bacteria led to phage lytic development in about 80 % of cases .
the remaining infected bacteria were lysogenized , resulting overall in the rapid lysogenization of the susceptible lineage .
moreover , our setup enabled to demonstrate that rare events of phage gene capture by homologous recombination occurred in the intestine of monoxenic mice .
to our knowledge , this study constitutes the first quantitative characterization of temperate phage - bacteria interactions in a simplified gut environment .
the high prophage induction rate detected reveals dna damage - mediated sos response in monoxenic mouse intestine .
we propose that the mammalian gut , the most densely populated bacterial ecosystem on earth , might foster bacterial evolution through high temperate phage activity .
author summary dormant bacterial viruses , or prophages , are found in the genomes of almost all bacteria , but their impact on bacterial host fitness is largely unknown. through experiments in mice , supported by a mathematical model , we quantified the activity of escherichia coli prophage lambda in monoxenic mouse gut , as well as its impact on its carrier bacteria .
lambda carriage negatively impacted its hosts due to frequent reactivation , but indirectly benefited its host by killing susceptible bacterial competitors .
the high prophage activity unraveled in this study reflects a constant rate of sos response , resulting from dna damage in monoxenic mouse intestine .
our results should motivate researchers to take the presence of prophages into account when studying the action of specific bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals .

introduction bacterial viruses , called bacteriophages or phages , are present in all bacterial communities and have profound impact on bacteria either by killing them or by mediating horizontal gene transfer through lysogeny .
lysogeny refers to the ability of temperate phages , as opposed to virulent ones , to repress their lytic multiplication after infection and stably segregate with the bacteria .
in most cases , the repressed phage , or prophage , is integrated into the bacterial chromosome , but it can also replicate as an extrachromosomal element in the bacterium .
nearly all bacterial genomes contain one or multiple prophages , which can constitute up to 14 % of the genome for escherichia coli strains [ 1 ] .
active prophages can be induced , i.e. switch back to lytic multiplication in response to a signal such as dna damage and subsequent sos response ( reviewed in [ 2 ]) .
induction rates are usually too low to result in a cost to their host , and prophages were generally found to have positive impacts on lysogenic bacteria [ 3 - 6 ] .
the benefits of lysogeny can result from three distinct mechanisms : ( i ) lysogenic conversion , by which phages bring useful bacterial accessory traits [ 4,7 ] ; ( ii ) immunity , i.e. protection against other phages , as the prophage protects its carrier bacterium against the same , and sometimes other , phages [ 8 ] ; and ( iii ) allelopathy , by releasing infectious virions that are able to kill susceptible bacterial competitors .
while induction results in the death of the lysogen , it can provide a competitive advantage for the remaining lysogenic population .
a large number of major bacterial toxins , such as the diphtheria , panton - valentine , cholera , shiga - or scarlatin toxins are encoded on temperate phage genomes ( reviewed in [ 7 ]) .
however , pathogenicity does not always increase bacterial fitness in a human host , suggesting that some pathogenic traits can be coincidental ( reviewed in [ 9 ]) .
to our knowledge , except for staphylococcus aureus , only a small proportion of prophages were demonstrated to carry beneficial traits for their bacterial host , such as improvement of the colonization of body surfaces - - like intestine [ 10,11 ] , nasopharynx [ 12 ] , or skin [ 13 ] - - or resistance to protozoa grazing [ 14,15 ] .
the allelopathic character of temperate phages has been demonstrated by in vitro experiments and mathematical modelling [ 16,17 ] , but also recently during insect infection [ 18 ] .
however , very few data exist concerning the impact of prophages on the fitness of their hosts in the most densely populated bacterial ecosystem , the intestine of mammals .
metagenomic studies have shown that gut bacteria harbor many temperate phages [ 19 ] , but whether carrying a prophage is generally costly or advantageous for its host has been rarely investigated in the intestinal environment [ 20,21 ] .
a well documented case of beneficial interaction is the filamentous temperate phage of vibrio cholerae vpiphi , which encodes factors essential for bacterial adherence and intestine colonization [ 10,11 ]. e. coli prophages carrying shiga toxin stx genes are known to be active in the intestine , but their excision and lysogenization rates were not quantified [ 22,23 ] .
another study demonstrated that a prophage of an enteroccocus faecalis strain provided a 1.5 - fold growth advantage after 24 hours of mouse gut colonization [ 24 ] , but the mechanisms involved were not entirely explored , nor the impact of prophage presence after the first day of colonization .
the costs or benefits of lysogeny in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be inferred from in vitro studies , since the parameters that rule phage - bacteria interactions vary greatly with the environment , bacterial physiology and medium structure .
for example , the lysogenization rate of phage lambda , i.e. the proportion of infected e. coli bacteria that are lysogenized upon infection , varies from 10 - 3 when infecting cells in optimal growth conditions , to 0.5 when infecting starved cells [ 25 ] .
this rate also varies with temperature and multiplicity of infection [ 26 ] .
three other main interaction parameters can be distinguished : ( i ) the induction rate , ( ii ) the adsorption rate onto the bacterial host , i.e. affinity of the phage for its receptors , a parameter that greatly depends on ionic conditions [ 27 ] , and ( iii ) the multiplication rate within the host .
up to now , none of these parameters has been determined for a temperate phage in the gut environment .
yet , characterizing temperate phage activity is essential to estimate their impact on lysogenic bacteria , and to evaluate the extent of the horizontal gene transfer they mediate in this environment .
this point is of paramount importance because temperate phages are major actors of bacterial genome evolution , and as such they participate to the emergence of new pathogenic strains .
moreover they are suspected to be important disseminators of antibiotic resistance genes [ 28 ] .
the extreme complexity of the gut microbiota prevents any exhaustive characterization of all the virus - host systems it hosts .
it is thus necessary to first characterize specific virus - host systems in a controlled microbiota to bridge the existing gap between in vitro studies and the functional characterization of natural gut microbial communities .
we used monoxenic mice , i.e. mice associated with a single bacterial species , to perform competition experiments between two isogenic e. coli strains , one carrying the lambda prophage and the other devoid of it. these experiments , supported by a mathematical model consisting of five ordinary differential equations , allowed disentangling the different components of the impact of the prophage on bacterial reproductive fitness .
we obtained quantitative estimations of the main parameters driving phage - bacteria interactions in monoxenic mouse intestine .
moreover , we demonstrate that efficient phage spreading enabled rare events of phage - mediated gene capture by homologous recombination , and transmission to new bacteria .
results monoxenic mouse gut environment allows for rapid phage multiplication to characterize phage - bacteria interactions in the mouse digestive tract , we colonized germ - free mice with two isogenic e. coli mg1655 strains , except for antibiotic resistance markers and the presence of the lambda prophage ( lambdable phage confering phleomycin resistance to the lysogen ) .
populations of free phage ( v ) , bacteria from the lysogenic lineage ( l ) , from the susceptible lineage ( s ) and newly lysogenized by lambda ( sl ) were quantified in mouse feces for one week , based on their differential antibiotic resistance levels .
during the first day of colonization , phage propagation , via free phage production and lysogenization of the susceptible bacteria , was highly efficient : after 24 hours of colonization , an average 73 % of the bacteria from the initially susceptible lineage were either killed or lysogenized , and a transient increase in free phage had occurred ( fig 1a ) .
to determine what fraction of free phage was produced by multiplication on susceptible bacteria , as opposed to free phage produced by spontaneous induction in lysogens , the same experiment was repeated with lamb derivatives of the two strains , devoid of the phage receptor and resistant to phage infection ( fig 1b ) .
in such conditions all free phages result from the spontaneous induction of prophages in lysogenic bacteria .
at the peak of free phage production , the free phage over lysogen ratio was 20 - fold lower than in the experiment with wt strains ( fig 1c ) , indicating that the transient increase of free phage observed with these strains resulted from multiplication on susceptible bacteria , and not from a transient increase in induction rate .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005861.g001 fig 1 rapid phage propagation occurs during the first day of colonization .
a ) temporal evolution of bacterial lineages s , l and sl and free phage v densities in mouse feces : l bacteria ( red ) , bacteria from the susceptible lineage ( s + sl , blue ) , sl bacteria ( green ) , free phage ( purple , v ) .

means +/ - standard deviations from 6 mice are indicated .
c ) temporal dynamics of the free phage ( v ) over total lysogen ( l + sl ) ratio in mouse feces .
mice were colonized either with the two strains of panels a ( wt , full line ) , or with their lamb derivatives described in panel b ( dashed line ) .
means +/ - standard errors from 8 and 6 mice for the wt and lamb strains respectively are indicated .
d ) temporal dynamics of bacterial lineages s , l , sl and free phage v subjected to serial transfers in lb flasks .
phage propagation is very limited , as observed by the low density of sl bacteria and free phage v. e ) same populations in lb supplemented with 5 mm mgso4 .
means +/ - standard deviations of ratios on 4 independent cultures are indicated. by comparison , when the same s and l strains were co - cultured in vitro , in standard rich lb medium , phage propagation was almost undetectable ( fig 1d ) , in line with previously published results [ 29 ] .
this absence of propagation was due to low mg2 + concentration in lb , drastically limiting lambda adsorption ([ 27 ] and fig 1d and 1e ) .
addition of maltose did not improve phage propagation , suggesting that lamb expression in lb is sufficient for phage infection [ 30 ] .
phage propagation is impeded by malt mutations after 1.5 days of colonization in mice , phage propagation stopped before the complete lysogenization of the s lineage .
to test whether this resulted from changes in gut bacteria impairing infection , mice were monocolonized with the susceptible strain s only , and bacteria from feces were tested for affinity to lambda ( fig 2a ) .
after one day , lambda adsorption rate on bacteria from mouse feces was measured at 3.10 - 7 ml h - 1 , which is similar to the value measured at day 0 in vitro .
therefore the phage receptor lamb is highly expressed in the mouse gut , and favorable ionic conditions allow for efficient binding .
later on however , the adsorption rate diminished continuously , suggesting a decrease in lamb expression ( fig 2a ) .
to investigate this phenomenon further , we determined the susceptibility to lambda of s clones isolated from mouse feces two days after colonization .
nine out of the twelve clones tested turned out to be genetically resistant to lambda , and were moreover unable to use maltose , as revealed by their inability to grow on minimal medium containing maltose as the unique energy source .
in subsequent colonization experiments , we quantified the increase in maltose - deficient bacteria ( mal - ) by using maltose agar plates containing a tetrazolium dye that turned red in mal - colonies ( fig 2b ) .
mal - bacteria were selected in the s and l lineages ( fig 2c ) .
a similar rise in mal - bacteria occurred in mice monocolonized with the phage - free strain s , demonstrating unambiguously that their selection is not caused by lambda ( fig 2c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005861.g002 fig 2 resistant mutants invade independently of phage presence .

on day 1 the adsorption rate was close to its maximal theoretical value .
means +/ - standard errors from three mice are indicated .
b ) detection and enumeration of mal - colonies on tetrazolium maltose plates after 2 days of colonization : white , wild - type mal + colonies ; red , mal - colonies .
mal - colonies have mutations in malt , the positive regulator of the maltose operon , and do not express the phage receptor lamb .
c ) evolution of the proportion of mal - bacteria with time in the s and l lineages .
in addition to the results of the co - colonization experiments , the proportion of mal - bacteria during two independent monocolonization experiments are indicated : black line , monocolonization with the s strain ; dotted line , monocolonization with a lamb strain .
means +/ - standard deviations of four mice in each experiment are indicated .
mal - and lambda resistance phenotypes , as well as previously published results [ 31 ] , guided our identification of mutations in the malt gene .
malt is the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon .
it notably controls expression of the lambda receptor lamb .
all six resistant clones studied carried a mutation in malt , among which three led to a truncated protein ( s1 fig ) , which explains that the selected mutations prevent phage infection .
the reason for the selection of these mutants might be linked to the lamb - induced envelope stress associated with osmoregulation [ 30 ] since bacteria in the gastrointestinal lumen are continuously exposed to osmotic stress ( reviewed in [ 32 ]) .
they are specific to monoxenic mice , as malt mutations are not selected for in the mg1655 e. coli strain when colonizing mice with a conventional microbiota [ 33 ] .
mathematical modelling of phage - bacteria interactions in monoxenic mouse gut the rise of malt mutants was nevertheless sufficiently delayed to permit observation phage infection of the majority of s bacteria during the first two days .
in order to provide quantitative estimations of the parameters governing phage - bacteria interactions , we developed a mathematical model representing the dynamics of the different microbial populations in this model ecosystem ( fig 3 ) .
the model is based on the one in [ 17 ] and adapted to take into account our experimental settings .
it consists of five coupled differential equations , representing time evolution of five population densities : s ( susceptibles ) , l ( lysogens ) , sl ( newly - lysogenized susceptibles ) , v ( free phage ) , as well as latent bacteria q in which the phage undergoes lytic multiplication .
invasion of malt mutants is not included in the model .
s1 text gives a detailed description of the main modeling assumptions behind its construction , as well as a mathematical analysis of its dynamical behavior .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005861.g003 fig 3 quantitative mathematical modelling of temperate phage - bacteria interactions .
a ) diagram representing the interactions between the different populations .
s and l lineages grow with a common maximal growth rate r and carrying capacity k. lysogenic populations ( l and sl ) switch to lysis at a rate x entering latent population q. phage binding on bacteria is determined by the adsorption constant a. infection of susceptible leads either to lysogenization with probability g , or to lytic cycle with probability 1 - g. latency rate l and burst size y determine the production of free phage v. the dilution term d accounts for the mouse gastrointestinal flux .
b ) system of differential equations governing the dynamics of the five populations ( variable n denotes total population l + s + sl ) .
c ) numerical simulations of the model with estimated values of table 1 : the lines represent the temporal evolution of population densities s + sl ( blue ) , l ( red ) , sl ( green ) and v ( purple ) , with different initial conditions : l0 = 1x106 cfu / g and , from left to right , s0 = l0 , s0 = 10xl0 , s0 = 100xl0 .
a careful examination of the effect of the eight model parameters onto the dynamics enabled the quantitative estimation of six of them from our experimental datasets ( table 1 ). with these estimated values , numerical simulations of the model ( fig 3c ) are in good agreement with experimental observations on the first two days , before invasion of malt mutants , suggesting it captures most of the relevant information contained in our data .
the main discrepancy observed is in the initial velocity of the temporal evolutions , faster in the model than in experimental data .
this might result either from incorrect estimation of some parameters , or from the neglect of a phenomenon not taken into account in the model , such as the binding of free phage on some intestinal components .
such binding would result in a " loss " of phage that would slow the dynamics , as exemplified by the effect of reduced burst size ( s2 fig ) .

g lysogenization rate 0.19 - high lysogenization limits the final gain of the original prophage carrier strain upon infection of a susceptible bacterium , lambda goes to lysogenization with a high probability around 19 % , leading to a very rapid rise of sl bacteria both in data and in numerical simulations ( fig 4a ) .
the remaining infected susceptibles were lysed , resulting in an increase of the l lineage relative to the s one , independently of the initial l / s ratios ( fig 4b ) .
lamb deletion abolished the competitive advantage of the l lineage ( fig 4b , dotted line ) , confirming that the advantage of lysogens only stemmed from the lysis of susceptible competitors , and not from the presence of putative bacterial fitness genes in the lambda genome that would improve growth in mice .
however , the gain of the l lineage over the s one is limited by the lysogenization of susceptible , independently from the rise of lambda resistant mutants .
its final value , as predicted by the model , seems to be directly proportional to the inverse of g at population equilibrium ( fig 4c ) .
interestingly , other parameters governing phage - bacteria interaction have very modest impact on the final gain of the l lineage ( s3 fig and s1 text ) .

c ) impact of the lysogenization rate g on the final l over s lineages ratio , as predicted by the mathematical model .
a high prophage induction rate in the gut decreases lysogen fitness prophage induction rate in the mouse gastrointestinal tract was estimated to be 1.6 % , several orders of magnitude higher than usually assumed .
this high induction leads to a slight but systematic decrease of lysogens ( l and sl lineages ) in mice when bacteria are resistant to infection , either because of malt or lamb mutations ( figs 1a and 1b and 5a ). by contrast , in vitro , induction rate is 3 x 10 - 4 ( table 2 ) , and competitions under conditions that did not permit phage infection resulted in a stable proportion over time of lysogenic ( l and sl lineages ) and non - lysogenic s bacteria ( figs 1d and s3a ) .
in mouse , model - based estimation of the induction rate was derived from latent q cell counts in mouse colonized with lamb strains .
because of the small data set available ( one experiment with three mice ) , the confidence interval is relatively large ( 0.6 % - 3.6 % , see table 1 and s1 text ) .
in order to strengthen the estimation , we also computed the induction rate from the relative fitness of l compared to s lamb lineages ( material & methods ) .
the value found ( 1.7 % +/ - 0.5 %) was very close to that estimated by the model .

10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005861.t002 table 2 induction rate per lysogenic bacteria growing on rich medium ( lb ) .
the induction rate was measured on ampicillin plates by scoring infective centers , as described in the materials and methods section .
since bile salts were shown to cause dna damage in bacteria [ 34 ] , and to induce a salmonella prophage [ 35 ] , we measured their effect on lambda induction rate , but no change was detected .
bile salts were added at a final concentration of 0.8 % .
mean +/ - standard deviation of three independent experiments are indicated .

as expected , in standard in vitro conditions , the ciind - mutation decreased the induction rate 1,000 - fold ( table 2 ) .
in the mouse gastrointestinal tract , the mutation abolished the decrease in proportion of lysogens ( fig 5b ) , demonstrating unambiguously that high prophage induction explains the disadvantage of lysogens .
moreover , in a lamb genetic background , s and lambdaciind - lysogenic strains presented no reproductive fitness differences over 9 days ( s4b fig ) , validating the model hypothesis that in the absence of lysis and induction , the presence of the prophage makes no difference in growth rate .
interestingly , lambdaciind - experiments also validated the absence of a rarity threshold to phage multiplication in the mouse gut : since phage amplify on susceptible bacteria , even a very low initial number of phage can lead to killing of a significant part of s lineage ( fig 5b and 5c ) .
transient selection of lambda virulent mutants in lambdaciind - the switch from lysogenic to lytic cycle requires ci autocleavage , catalyzed by reca nucleofilament formed by dna damage [ 36,37 ] .
in the lambdaciind - lysogens , reca mediated ci autocleavage is prevented , and the few phage produced are ci low expression mutants [ 36 ] .
indeed , free phage isolated from feces of mice colonized with lambdaciind - lysogens formed clearer plaques than lambda wild - type , which suggest they have a lower lysogenization rate .
sequencing of the ci gene from 9 phages isolated at day 2 either from free phage in feces or from sl bacteria revealed they all had a point mutation in the - 35 box of ci promoter , prm ( g - > t , - 33 relative to the ci start of transcription ) .
interestingly , this prm mutation was previously shown to enable lambda prophage induction in the absence of sos activation , by decreasing by 80 % intracellular ci levels , leading to much higher switching rates from the lysogenic to the lytic states [ 36 ] .
indeed , these prm mutants , named lambdaci * , had an induction rate 50,000 - fold higher than that of the ancestral lambdaciind - phage and 300 - fold higher than the wild - type ( table 2 ) .
measurement of induction rate from 12 other sl bacteria revealed they were all lysogenized by lambdaci * .
the high induction of this virulent mutant enabled its propagation during the first days of colonization .
however , in agreement with evolutionary epidemiology theory , that predicts that selection for virulence decreases with the pool of susceptible hosts [ 38 ] , the virulent lambdaci * mutant was counter selected later on in the prophage form , due to killing of its host through induction ( fig 6 ) .

high phage propagation permits de novo horizontal gene transfer detection we next investigated whether this high phage activity allowed for gene exchange between the phage and bacterial genomes .
we have previously reported that lambda captures bacterial genes by homologous recombination during the lytic cycle , at frequencies ranging between 10 - 4 and 10 - 6 depending on the extent of homology between the dna segments ( fig 7 and [ 20 ]) .
in our experimental system , recombination can lead to the incorporation of the chloramphenicol resistance gene ( cat ) of the l strain into the phage genome , since l bacteria have the cat gene in a chromosomal region of partial homology with lambda ( 88 % identity ) .
we investigated the occurrence of this phenomenon in mice .
recombinant phages can be detected in their lysogenic form as they confer chloramphenicol resistance to the bacteria they are integrated in. on days 1 and 2 , recombinant prophages were detected in all mice , at frequencies around 5.10 - 8 relative to the number of new lysogens ( sl ) .
pcr analysis confirmed that the cat gene was placed at the expected position in the lambda prophage .
no recombinants were detected with a lambda phage deleted of its main recombination gene , bet ( or redbeta ) , indicating the importance of phage recombination function for gene acquisition .

bacteria lysogenized by a recombinant phage are resistant to chloramphenicol .
discussion complete genome sequencing of thousands of gut bacteria has shown that most harbor prophages , yet their impact on strain fitness in the gastrointestinal tract has rarely been investigated .
colonization experiments , supported by a mathematical model of phage / bacteria interactions , show that the advantage of lambda lysogeny in monoxenic mice gut is valid only when susceptible bacteria are present ; a situation that might be only occasional in the gut microbiota .
indeed , it is supposed that only one or two e. coli strains cohabit at the same time in the human gastrointestinal tract [ 39,40 ] , and moreover , to our knowledge lambda phage infects only a small proportion of e. coli strains .
in the absence of susceptible competitors , the prophage was costly for its host , due to frequent induction caused by dna damage .
prophages were generally shown to positively impact their host fitness , and our study is , to our knowledge , the first demonstration that a prophage can be detrimental to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract .
the level of phage lambda induction observed in monoxenic mice was remarkable : 1 to 2 % of lysogenic bacteria were lysed per generation , which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than in standard laboratory conditions , in which induction was too low to constitute a measurable fitness cost ( figs 1c and s4 ) .
this result is reinforced by another study showing that the induction rate of 933w lambdoid prophage is higher in the mouse gastrointestinal tract than in vitro , and constant over time [ 41 ] .
however , the reporter assay used did not permit direct estimation of the induction rate and the associated cost for the bacteria [ 41 ] .
we observed that the lambda repressor mutation ciind - , which abolishes ci auto - cleavage , dramatically decreased prophage induction in the intestine .
many reports over a long period of time have proven unambiguously that for such cleavage to occur , a reca nucleoprotein filament ( also called " activated reca ") must catalyze the reaction [ 36,42,43 ] , so lambda prophage induction reflects dna damage .
since reca nucleoprotein filament also triggers the general sos response [ 44 ] , our results indicates that this response is activated in 1 to 2 % of bacteria in the intestine of monoxenic mice .
dna damage sensing is not only responsible for the induction of most prophages [ 2 ] , but it also triggers activation of other mobile genetic elements such as integrative and conjugative elements or ices [ 45 ] , transposons [ 46 ] and integrons [ 47 ] .
moreover , the large number of defective prophages in e. coli genomes , i.e. prophages incapable of independent induction or particle formation [ 48 - 51 ] , suggests a regular selection in favor of bacteria having lost or inactivated these prophages , possibly in response to their frequent induction in the intestine .
interestingly , at least in the simplified gut environment used in this study , induction cost is not compensated by the putative adaptative genes lom , bor and rex described in the lambda genome [ 52,53 ] .
the low induction rate lambdaciind - phage used in this study was on the contrary beneficial to its host , since it confers no induction cost while still enabling efficient killing of competitors through amplification on susceptibles .
however , phage mutants with higher induction are strongly selected for when susceptible bacteria are present [ 38 ] , as exemplified in our study by the selection of the lambdaci * virulent phage ( fig 6 ) .
interestingly , all e. coli lambdoid phages tested have comparable levels of induction [ 54 ] , close to that of lambda , suggesting they have all evolved toward the same optimal induction rate for propagation .
alternatively , it was proposed that optimal induction rates evolved to benefit the bacterial host - and thereby prophage vertical transmission - by a " bacterial altruism " mechanism [ 55 ] .
indeed , in the case of shiga - toxin carrying prophages , prophage induction leads to the release of toxins killing bacterial protozoan predators , benefiting the bacterial host even in the absence of susceptible competitors .
the level of phage lambda lysogenization unraveled was also remarkable : we estimated that in monoxenic mice gastrointestinal tract the lysogenization rate is close to 20 %. by comparison , in vitro , lysogenization rate is close to 0.1 % in bacteria growing rapidly [ 54 ] , but almost 50 % in starved bacteria [ 25,56 ] .
this lysogenization rate estimated in mouse is therefore much higher than generally measured or assumed [ 16,17,57,58 ] .
since the final gain of the original phage carrier on the susceptible strain is inversely proportional to the lysogenization rate ( our results and [ 57 ]) , in the gastrointestinal tract high lysogenization results in a smaller gain of the original phage carrier than previously described .
theory predicts that high lysogenization optimizes phage reproduction in an environment where the density of susceptible hosts is low or variable [ 58,59 ] .
although the gut microbiota is the densest bacterial community on earth , it includes hundreds of different species and thousands of bacterial strains , possibly making highly specific phage infection relatively rare .
low phage susceptibility seems to be the conclusion of a large - scale study of phage - bacteria interactions in a gnotobiotic mouse model [ 60 ] : in mice raised with a simplified microbiota composed of 15 strains belonging to dominant human species , only two were attacked by a cocktail of thousands of different phages isolated from a human gut microbiota .
moreover , a higher proportion of temperate phages was found in gut viromes than in other environments [ 19,61 ] .
altogether , these data support our results , suggesting that in the gastrointestinal tract the lysogenic life cycle of phages is favoured compared to lytic multiplication .
temperate phages being major actors of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria , a concern emerged recently regarding their role in the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes [ 62 ] .
indeed , some phage particles are vectors of antibiotic resistance genes [ 28 ] .
most of the time , gene transfer occurs by generalized transduction , the erroneous encapsidation of bacterial dna .
such errors are rare : for instance , the proportion of e. coli phage p1 capsids leading to the production of an antibiotic - resistant clone is between 10 - 5 and 10 - 6 [ 63,64 ] .
the incorporation of a bacterial gene into phage genome , and afterwards transfers by lysogenization is a much rarer event , that we could detect only when the gene was located in a defective prophage sharing homology with lambda [ 20 ] .
in the present study , we estimated the frequency of such gene capture ( cat gene , conferring chloramphenicol resistance ) by lambda in mice to be 10 - 8 .
interestingly , up to now very few cases of phages encoding resistance genes have been reported [ 65 - 67 ] , suggesting that even if the lysogenization rate in the intestine is very high , the risk of antibiotic resistance spread mediated by temperate phage is low .
here we found that in monoxenic mouse gastrointestinal tract , lysogeny initially benefits its host during competitions with susceptible bacteria , in line with previous studies in other environments [ 16 - 18 ] .
the mathematical model highlighted that the benefit of the original lysogenic strain depends critically on the lysogenization and induction rates : the lower these parameters , the higher the benefit .
we also show that in monoxenic mice gastrointestinal tract , dna damage leads to high prophage induction , which results in a significant cost for the lysogen .
provided that dna damage observed in monoxenic mice gut also occurs in conventional animals , since all e. coli lambdoid phages tested have comparable levels of induction [ 54 ] - and since most e. coli prophages are lambdoid [ 68 ] - our results might prove to be general .
due to the highly specific phage - bacteria interactions , we hypothesize that the absence of bacteria susceptible to a particular phage in the gastrointestinal tract might regularly occur , and that on the long term , the parasitic aspect of at least some active prophages prevails .
materials and methods bacterial strains all bacterial strains are described in s1 table .
all strains were constructed by modifying the mg1655 deltaflic deltaompf strain .
this strain was used because ompb mutations are rapidly and systematically selected in the mg1655 strain in the mouse gut as a result of their effects on flagellin ( flic ) repression and of decreased membrane permeability via repression of the major porin ompf [ 69 ] .
as ompb mutants also display a reduced expression level of lamb [ 31 ] , a maltoporin used by phage lambda for infection , we used a deltaompf deltaflic strain in which no ompb mutations were selected [ 69 ] .
the stfr : : cat mutation was introduced in this strain by phage p1 transduction from the md19 strain described in [ 20 ] .
the deltalamb strains were constructed by phage p1 transduction of the lamb : : kanr cassette from the keio collection strain jw3996 [ 70 ] .
in the md56 and md74 strains , the kanr cassette was excised as described in [ 71 ] .
the lambda receptor being absent in deltalamb strains , lambda prophage was introduced by transformation with urlambdable purified dna .
phage strains the lambdable phage strain used in this study was constructed by insertion of the phleomycin resistance gene ble into the urlambda strain of lambda , as described in [ 20 ] .
the lambdaciind - mutant contains a mutation ( a111t ) in the reca cleavage site : the alanine in position 111 is replaced by a threonine [ 72 ] .
this mutation was introduced by recombineering with the oligonucleotide at111 ( gtaaaggttctaagctcaggtgagaacatgccggtttggacatgagaaaaaacagggtactcatacc ) .
small letters represent changes in the dna sequence .
several neutral differences were added to the one necessary for the amino acid change in order to avoid recognition by muts .
recombineering was performed in the hme57 strain [ 73 ] , which carried plasmid pkd46 [ 71 ] , and lysogenized with lambdable .
the strain was co - transformed with two oligonucleotides , at111 and court 's lab oligonucleotide 144 , conferring it the ability to use galactose [ 74 ] .
after transformation , colonies were isolated on m9 minimal galactose plates .
96 gal + clones were screened for the absence of spontaneous phage induction , by scoring the absence of infectious phage particles in culture supernatants .
1 out of 96 clones had the expected mutation , which was confirmed by sequencing of the ci gene .
the lambdaciind - phage was next introduced into the mg1655 deltaflic deltaompf stfr : : cat strain by p1 transduction and selection on phleomycin plates .
mouse and in vivo competition experiments germ - free c3h / hen mice were bred at the germ - free animal facilities of the inra micalis institute , anaxem .
mice were reared in isolators and fed ad libitum on a commercial diet sterilized by gamma irradiation ( 40 kgy ) and supplied with autoclaved tap water .
for colonization experiments , 8 week - old germ - free female mice were gavaged with 106 bacteria from the chosen strain , or the appropriate mixture of the two strains , in 0.1 ml of m9 minimal medium .
the cassettes used to differentiate strains during competition confer resistance to chloramphenicol or to kanamycin .
their expression is known to have no significant cost during e. coli intestinal colonization , so no inversion of markers was performed [ 31,75 ] .
bacterial and phage populations in feces were monitored by colony forming unit ( cfu ) and plaque forming unit ( pfu ) counts in freshly harvested individual fecal samples , as described below .
feces were homogenized in a 10 - fold volume of sterile water before dilution in lb and plating on lba plates with the appropriate antibiotics .
pfus were enumerated in the supernatant of suspended feces centrifuged 3 minutes at 12,000 g. all procedures were carried out in accordance with the european guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals .
the project received the agreement of the local ddpp ( ndegrees a48 - 195 ) and from the local ethic committee for animal experimentation , the comethea ( ndegrees 13 - 05 ) .
phage and bacterial counts after serial dilutions , bacterial populations were determined by plating on selective antibiotic - lb agar plates ( 1.5 % agar ) .
antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : kanamycin ( 50 mug / ml ) , chloramphenicol ( 20 mug / ml ) , and phleomycin ( 5 mug / ml ) .
pfus were determined by spotting 10 mul of serial dilutions of diluted feces on a lawn of the indicator bacteria in top agar ( 0.4 % agar , 10 mm mgso4 ) .
the indicator bacterial culture was fresh md5 culture grown in lb containing 0.2 % maltose .
latent bacteria were counted similarly but after elimination of free phage by centrifugation .
cfus and pfus were counted after 12 - 16 hours of incubation at 37degreesc .
the ability to use maltose was monitored in tetrazolium maltose ( tm ) indicator plates .
mal + and mal - clones respectively form white and red colonies on these plates .
the tm medium was composed of tryptone ( 10 g / l ) , yeast extract ( 1 g / l ) , nacl ( 5g / l ) , agar ( 16g / l ) , maltose ( 5 g / l ) and tetrazolium dye ( 50 mg / l , sigma ) .
s and l lineages competition in vitro for comparison with the in vivo results , s and l strains were co - cultured in vitro in rich lb medium , with a starting 1:1 ratio .
co - cultures were diluted 1,000 - fold twice a day in 10 ml of lb , with or without 5 mm mgso4 , in 50 - ml plastic tubes and incubated at 37degreesc with agitation ( 200 rpm ) .
1,000 fold dilution corresponds to a number of bacterial generations per 24 hours comparable to that in mouse gut ( about 20 generations compared to 16 in mice ) .
adsorption rate measurements the technique was essentially that of hendrix [ 76 ] , with minor modifications .
adsorbing bacteria from feces were prepared as described for enumeration .
a control culture was grown at 37degreesc with shaking in lb + 0.2 % maltose + 10 mm mgso4 up to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.2 ( about 6.108 bacteria / ml ) .
aliquots of 200 mul of culture were added to 50 - mul aliquots containing 500 phage particles in 400 - mul pcr tube strips , and mixed at 37degreesc .
several strips were prepared , one for each time point .
at the chosen time points , the bacteria were separated from the free phages by centrifugation .
the pfu in the supernatants were enumerated as described above .
pfus at time zero were estimated by titering the phage suspension .
the slope of a graph plotting the logarithm of the number of bacteria remaining unadsorbed as a function of time allowed us to calculate the adsorption rate a according to the equation nt = n0 x e - bat , where nt and n0 are the numbers of phage particles unadsorbed at time t and at time zero respectively , b is the number of bacteria per millilitre , and t is time in hours .
quantitative estimation of mathematical model 's parameters to calibrate the mathematical model , we used different datasets and versions of the model , aiming at the disentanglement of the eight parameters ( see s1 text for details ) .
we identified four groups of parameters , which were estimated sequentially .
the first group consists of parameters r , k and d that directly control the general growth of bacterial populations .
as a global parameter , independent of the bacterial strains , the dilution rate was fixed to d = 0.25 , in line with [ 77 - 79 ] .
subsequently , parameters r and k were estimated from single species experiments in mice , using a mono - dimensional logistic equation and nonlinear least square minimization .
the second group consists of parameters x and l. a closer look at the equations points out the central role of these two parameters on the dynamics of latent cells q. to further separate the estimation from phage - dependent parameters , we considered a lamb - version of the model ( i.e. with a = 0 ) implying only variables l , s and q. this simplified model was then fitted to lamb - experimental data .
the third group gathers phage - dependent parameters y and a. based on the formula for the equilibrium population of free viruses , a linear relationship was obtained between the two .
using a value of y calculated from in vitro data , the corresponding value for the adsorption constant was deduced .
finally , the last parameter g ( probability of lysogenization ) was estimated by fitting the ratio l /( s + sl ) in l - s competition experiments .
the best fit was obtained at 36 h. all estimated values are listed in table 1 .
when possible , bootstrap techniques were used to compute 95 % confidence intervals ( see s1 text ) .
all numerical computations have been performed with matlab ( the mathworks , inc. ) .
experimental estimation of burst size burst size was estimated in vitro in conditioned lb , i.e. the supernatant of a bacterial culture grown in lb (+ 0.2 % maltose , + 10 mm mgso4 ) at 37degreesc up to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.5 .
in such conditioned media we measured a growth rate of 1.1 h - 1 , close to that measured in the mice gastrointestinal tract during the first 24 hours of colonization .
for single burst experiments , 100 mul of a culture at od600 of 1.5 is mixed with 1x105 lambda phage .
the mix of phage and bacteria is incubated 7 minutes at 37degreesc , centrifuged and washed twice to eliminate free phage , and then diluted 1,000 times in conditioned lb at 37degreesc .
samples were taken every 10 minutes , mixed with 200 mul of exponentially growing susceptible bacteria and 3ml of top agar ( 4.5 g / l , 0.2 % maltose , 10 mm mgso4 ) , and then poured on lb agar plates .
plaque - forming units ( pfu ) were counted .
the burst size ( y ) is the factor between maximum and initial pfu counts .
we determined that y = 12.1 +/ - 8 .
model - independent estimation of induction rate since induction rate is the sole parameter differentiating growth of s and l lamb lineages , the induction rate ( x ) was determined from the evolution of the l / s ratio between days 0 and 9 in function of the number of generations .
the number of generations was estimated by assuming that growth rate is equal to r , 1.1 h - 1 , during the first 24 hours , and after equal to excretion rate d , 0.25 h - 1 .
a linear regression on data from 6 mice ( lm function in r software ) gave x = 0.0170 +/ - 0.0046 .
in vitro induction rate measurements we adapted a method allowing for an measurement of the induction rate per bacterium [ 80 ] .
lysogenic bacteria were diluted 200 fold in lb and grown at 37degreesc with shaking .
when specified , 0.8 % w / v bile salts ( cholic acid - deoxycholic acid sodium salt mixture , sigma - aldrich ) were added when the absorbance at 600 nm of the culture was 0.2 or 0.1 .
when the absorbance reached 0.4 , cultures were swirled on ice for 5 minutes and washed twice at 4degreesc to eliminate free phages .
washed lysogenic bacteria were then mixed at the appropriate dilution with 100 mul of a saturated culture of the indicator strain , 3 ml of top agar were added , and the mix was plated on lba - ampicillin plates ( 50 mug / ml ) .
the indicator bacteria were ampicillin - resistant ( strain jc10990 recf : : tn3 ampr ) .
ampicillin prevents further lysogen growth but does not prevent the completion of the lytic cycle if already started , which results in an infective centre .
the induction rate was calculated by dividing the number of infective centres by the number of plated lysogenic bacteria .
supporting information s1 fig map of the six mutations identified in the malt gene .
3 mutations interrupt the coding sequence , resulting in a truncated protein .
the three other mutations are found in the maltotriose sensor domain dt3 , and two have been selected independently , as they are found in two mice from two different cages .
interestingly , 24 out of 29 point mutations in this domain were observed to abolish of very significantly diminish malt activity [ 81 ] .

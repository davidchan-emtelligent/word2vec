electrospinning is an effective method in preparing polymeric nanofibrous drug delivery systems ( ddss ) for topical wound healing and skin burn therapy applications .
the aim of the present study was to investigate a new synthetic graft copolymer ( soluplus ) as a hydrophilic carrier polymer in electrospinning of nanofibrous ddss .
soluplus ( polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer ( pcl - pvac - peg )) was applied in the nonwoven nanomats loaded with piroxicam ( prx ) as a poorly water - soluble drug .
raman spectroscopy , x - ray powder diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) were used in the physical characterization of nanofibrous ddss .
according to the sem results , the drug - loaded pcl - pvac - peg nanofibers were circular in cross - section with an average diameter ranging from 500 nm up to 2 microm .
electrospinning stabilized the amorphous state of prx .
in addition , consistent and sustained - release profile was achieved with the present nanofibrous ddss at the physiologically relevant temperature and ph applicable in wound healing therapy .
in conclusion , electrospinning can be used to prepare nanofibrous ddss of pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) and to stabilize the amorphous state of a poorly water - soluble prx .
the use of this synthetic graft copolymer can open new options to formulate nanofibrous ddss for wound healing .
1. introduction modern polymeric drug delivery systems ( ddss ) for wound therapy are systems which are designed to release drug ( s ) to wound sites in a consistent and sustained fashion [ 1 , 2 ] .
in recent years , electrospun polymeric nonwoven nanomats have found multiple uses as ddss in wound healing and skin burn therapy [ 3 - 7 ] .
electrospinning is the method of choice for preparing polymeric nanofibrous ddss with unique characteristics including ultrafine structure , a large surface area to volume ratio , and a high porosity with a small pore size [ 8 - 12 ] .
the working principle of electrospinning is relatively simple : a polymer solution is ejected from a capillary toward a grounded metal collector plate by applying high voltage between the capillary and the plate [ 13 ] .
established polymers , such as cellulose derivatives , polyvinylpyrrolidone , polyvinyl alcohol , poly - l - lactic acid , poly ( epsilon - caprolactone ) , and chitosan , have been applied as carriers in the electrospinning of nanomats for drug delivery applications .
the selection of a carrier polymer for electrospinning is crucial since the type of polymer and drug - polymer - solvent interactions influence the formation , morphology , mechanical properties , drug release ( including burst effect ) , and biocompatibility of the final nanofibrous ddss [ 10 , 12 , 14 - 18 ] .
among current nanofabrication methods , electrospinning is considered the process with potential for industrial - scale mass production [ 19 ] .
soluplus ( polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer ( pcl - pvac - peg )) ( figure 1 ) is a new pharmaceutical excipient designed originally for preparing solid solutions of poorly water - soluble drugs by hot - melt extrusion technology [ 20 ] .
soluplus is a water - soluble copolymer with the average molecular weight ranging from 90,000 to 140,000 g / mol , and it is capable of solubilizing poorly water - soluble drugs [ 21 ] .
to date , there is only little information available about the use of soluplus in electrospinning and other nanofabrication - based methods .
recently , nagy et al .
[ 22 ] compared electrospun and extruded soluplus - based oral solid dosage forms for improving the dissolution of a poorly water - soluble drug .
to our knowledge , soluplus has not been applied as a carrier polymer in electrospun drug - loaded polymeric nanofibers and nanofibrous mats designed as topical ddss for wound healing and burn therapy .
a water - soluble carrier polymer allows aqueous - based environment - friendly electrospinning process and water - soluble drug loadings in the topical nanomats .
in addition , porous hydrophilic nanofibrous membranes have been shown to provide better wound healing performance than hydrophobic ones [ 23 ] .
in this study , soluplus ( pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ) was investigated as a potential novel water - soluble carrier polymer in electrospinning .
furthermore , a strong hypothesis was that the present graft copolymer can be used as a carrier polymer in the aqueous - based electrospinning of nonwoven nanofibrous ddss for wound healing .
in the present study , soluplus was used in the nanomats loaded with piroxicam ( prx ) as a model drug .
raman spectroscopy , x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) were applied for the physical characterization of nanofibrous ddss .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
materials soluplus ( polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer ( pcl - pvac - peg )) was kindly gifted from basf se pharma ingredients & services , ludwigshafen , germany .
piroxicam ( anhydrous prx pure form i , prxah i , letco medical , inc. , usa ) was used as a model drug when preparing electrospun nanomats .
acetone ( sigma - aldrich c.c. ) was applied as solvent in electrospinning .
physical mixtures of prx and pcl - pvac - peg were prepared at a ratio of 1 : 13 ( w / w ) to study the effects of electrospinning on the solid - state properties of the materials .
2.2 .
electrospinning of nanofibrous ddss the electrospinning setup and experimental conditions used to prepare the nanofibrous ddss are shown in figure 2 .
an automatic syringe pump kd scientific ( model number : kds - 250 - ce , geneq inc. , usa ) provided a feed rate of 2 ml / h. the high - voltage power supply gamma high voltage research ( model number es3op - 10w / dam , usa ) generated the dc voltage of 9 kv. the size of the needle used was 23 g. the distance between the spinneret and the fiber collector plate was 10 cm. the ratio of prx and pcl - pvac - peg used in the nanofibers was 1 : 13 ( w / w ) , and the total polymer concentration in acetone was 33 % w / v. the final theoretical concentration of prx in the electrospun nanofibers was 7.5 % ( w / w ) .
2.3 .
scanning electron microscopy a high - resolution scanning electron microscope ( sem ) ( zeiss evo 15 ma , germany ) was used to investigate the diameter of fibers and surface morphology of nanofibrous ddss .
samples were mounted on aluminum stubs with silver paint and were magnetron - sputter coated with a 3 nm gold layer in an argon atmosphere prior to microscopy imaging .
2.4 .
x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) x - ray diffraction patterns of the starting materials and electrospun nanofibers were studied with a x - ray diffractometer ( d8 advance , bruker axs gmbh , germany ) .
the xrpd experiments were carried out in symmetrical reflection mode ( bragg - brentano geometry ) with cukalpha radiation ( 1.54 a ) .
the scattered intensities were measured with the lynxeye one - dimensional detector including 165 channels .
the angular range was from 5degrees to 30degrees 2 - theta with the step size of 0.2degrees 2 - theta .
the total measuring time was 498 s / step .
the operating current and voltage were 40 ma and 40 kv , respectively .
experimental results on nanofibers were compared to the theoretical patterns in the cambridge structural database ( csd , cambridge , uk ) .
ref codes biyseh [ 24 ] and biyseh02 [ 25 ] were used as reference crystal structures for prxah i and prx form ii ( prxah ii ) , respectively .
2.5 .
raman spectroscopy raman spectra on both starting materials , their physical mixtures , and electrospun nanofibers were collected using a raman spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectrically cooled ccd detector ( 1024 x 64 ) and a fiber optic probe ( b & w tek inc. , usa ) .
a 300 mw laser source at 785 nm was used ( b & w tek inc. , usa ) .
spectra were recorded between 200 and 2200 cm - 1 with an integration time of 12 s , and each spectrum was the average of three scans .
b & w tek software ( b & w tek inc. , newark , de , usa ) was used for the collection of raman spectra .
2.6 .
differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) thermal properties of the starting materials , their physical mixtures , and produced nanofibers were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter ( dsc 4000 , perkin elmer ltd. , shelton , ct , usa ) .
the dsc system was calibrated for temperature and enthalpy using indium as a standard .
samples of 2 - 3 mg were sealed in an aluminium pan .
in case of pure prx , the sample size of 0.2 mg was used to be comparable with the other samples tested .
a nitrogen purge with a flow rate of 20 ml / min was used in the furnace .
the scans were obtained by heating from 30degreesc to 220degreesc at a rate of 20degreesc / min .
each run was performed in triplicate .
2.7 .
in vitro drug release the in vitro drug release experiments were carried out in an automated dissolution system ( termostat - sotax at7 , sotax ag , switzerland ) equipped with rotating baskets ( usp xxviii , apparatus 2 ) [ 26 ] .
an internal standard was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of prxah in 0.02 m sodium hydroxide solution .
the sample size of the nanofibers was 140 +/ - 3 mg ( containing theoretically 10 mg of prx ) .
the concentration of prx in the dissolution medium ( 900 ml ) was measured at 354 nm by using a uv - vis spectrophotometer ( ultrospec iii , biochrom ltd. , uk ) .
since prx has two pka values ( pka 1.86 and 5.46 ) and the different forms of the molecules have different solubility and dissolution in the release media , it was important to perform in vitro dissolution tests in more than one ph [ 27 , 28 ] .
sink - conditions were maintained at all time in the in vitro dissolution tests .
the dissolution media used were purified water , the usp xxviii phosphate buffer solution ph 7.2 , and the usp xxviii buffer solution ph 1.2 at 37 +/ - 0.5degreesc .
the ph of the buffer solutions was confirmed by the ph meter hi 9024 ( hanna instruments , usa ) .
the basket rotation speed was set at 50 rpm .
the samples were collected using an automated sampling and filtering system at 3 min intervals over a period of 2 hours .
five parallel tests were performed for each nanofiber system .
3. results and discussion according to boateng et al .
[ 1 ] , the use of hydrophilic polymers as medicated wound dressings has great promise because of the potential advantages they offer .
such advantages include , for example , drug delivery to wound sites in a consistent fashion , avoidance of high systemic doses , and patient compliance in chronic wound management .
these polymers are also easily washed off from the wound surface .
in the present study , a new hydrophilic synthetic pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) was studied as a carrier polymer in the electrospun nanofibrous ddss ( nonwoven nanomats ) intended for wound healing applications .
synthetic polymers are preferred ( over natural polymers ) for electrospinning since they are strong , cheap , and reliable and exert physicochemical characteristics that can be controlled through the production process [ 29 ] .
3.1 .
electrospinning of pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) the major bottle neck for using new carrier polymers in electrospun nanofibers is a limited knowledge of their behavior in electrospinning , selection of a proper solvent system , and the physical solid - state properties of the materials in the final nanomats .
moreover , electrospinning process conditions ( i.e. , relative humidity and temperature ) can affect the structure and mechanical properties of the electrospun nanofibers and alter their applications [ 30 ] .
in the present study , the method development involved the solubility screening tests of drug and copolymer ( data not shown ) and subsequent electrospinning trials to find an electrospinnable solvent system and optimal process parameters , respectively .
the drug loading of nanofibers was successfully made by electrospinning of drug / copolymer blends 1 : 13 ( w / w ) and using the total copolymer concentration of 33 % w / v in acetone .
acetone was selected since a quick solvent evaporation is essential for the formation of homogeneous nanofibrous mats .
in comparison to other electrospinnable polymers described in the literature , soluplus could enable fabrication of " greener " nanofibers for pharmaceutical ddss through aqueous - based ( or less toxic solvent - based ) processing .
to date , frequently used solvents in electrospinning of polymeric ddss are , for example , dichloromethane , hexafluoroisopropanol , trifluoroacetic acid , and trifluoroethylene [ 31 ] .
3.2 .
physical appearance , fiber size , and surface morphology the drug - loaded nanomats of pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) exhibited a 3d layered fiber mesh structure , nonwoven pattern , and the absence of beads .
according to sem shown in figure 3 , the nanofibers were circular in cross - section with an average diameter ranging from 500 nm up to 2 mum .
the nanofibers were yellow in color suggesting that prx existed in amorphous form [ 32 , 33 ] .
the amorphous form of drug exhibits random position of molecules relative to another , shows short - range order over a few molecular dimensions , and has physical properties ( including solubility ) quite different from those of the corresponding crystalline state [ 34 ] .
the presence of amorphous prx in the nanofibers was confirmed by xrpd and raman spectroscopy ( data shown in the following section ) .
the absence of beads (= equals the processing defects ) suggested the appropriate solvent and process parameter selection for the present medicated nanofibrous system .
according to the literature , the beads are readily formed in electrospinning if the surface tension of a solution ( solvent system ) is high or if the viscosity of a solution is low [ 15 ] .
readers are referred to two excellent review articles for details on the effects of polymeric solutions on electrospinning [ 29 , 35 ] .
3.3 .
solid - state and thermal properties application of electrospinning and hydrophilic carrier polymer ( s ) could be an interesting approach for the stabilization of poorly water - soluble drugs in amorphous state , and consequently , modifying their delivery rate to the site of action in wound therapy .
since the drug is simply dissolved in the polymer solution prior to electrospinning , the formation of an amorphous drug is evident during the process [ 29 ] .
the amorphous form of drug exhibits an enhanced solubility compared to the crystalline state , but being physically unstable it has a tendency to spontaneously recrystallize [ 34 ] .
in the present study , electrospinning was found to be the method to form and stabilize the amorphous state of prx when preparing the nanofibrous ddss of prx and pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer .
xrpd results revealed that the nanofibers contained prx in amorphous form immediately after fabrication and after a six - month aging period , when stored at low temperature ( 3 - 8degreesc ) and humidity ( rh 0 %) ( figure 4 ) .
thus , these results were also verified by raman spectroscopy ( figure 5 ) .
the electrospun nanofibers showed different raman spectra compared to their respective physical mixture. with the physical mixture of prx and carrier polymer ( 1 : 13 w / w ) , the characteristic raman spectroscopy peaks for prxah i were displayed at 1282 , 1338 , 1435 , and 1525 cm - 1 ( figure 5 ( a )). with the electrospun nanofibers , the raman spectroscopy peaks for the crystalline prxah forms disappeared and the presence of the characteristic peaks for amorphous prx was observed at 1237 , 1477 , 1531 , and 1561 cm - 1 ( figure 5 ( b )) .
these characteristic peaks for amorphous prx ( peak position , intensity , and the sharpness of the peaks ) differ from all known prx crystalline forms .
in electrospinning , a large specific surface area of nanofibers results in a fast and efficient evaporation of solvent , and consequently , molecules have no time to ( re ) crystallize and hence they most likely obtain an amorphous supermolecular structure [ 14 , 36 ] .
dsc thermographs ( figure 6 ) confirmed the presence of prx in amorphous form in the electrospun nanofibrous mats .
no melting endotherm was observed at the expected melting point range of prxah i at approximately 199 - 201degreesc .
in the literature , the crystallization of drugs in electrospun polymeric nanofibers has been related to a phase separation and salt formation even with only a 1 - 2 % ( w / w ) of drug loading [ 7 , 36 , 37 ] .
as shown in figure 6 , both pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) and prx - loaded polymeric nanofibers presented a broad dehydration endotherm in a range of 30degreesc - 110degreesc , which was attributed to the removal of water adsorbed by hydrophilic carrier polymer .
this broad dehydration endotherm also overlapped with the characteristic glass transition temperature , t g ( 70degreesc ) of a pure pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) [ 20 ] .
interestingly , the prx - loaded polymeric nanofibers exhibited the second ( even wider ) endotherm ranging from 100degreesc to 220degreesc , presumably suggesting that a physical interaction or fusion of prx into the pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) had occurred .
recently , lust et al .
[ 38 ] reported that the dehydration endotherm of amorphous solid dispersions of prx and pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) was narrower than that of the respective physical mixtures .
the latter was attributed to the increased temperature used to prepare the solid dispersions by melting method [ 38 ] .
they also showed a broad endotherm ranging from 125degreesc to 185degreesc with the physical mixtures of prx and the present carrier polymer , but in contrast to the present results on nanofibers , lust et al. did not observe an endotherm at higher temperatures with the amorphous solid dispersions prepared by melting method .
3.4 .
drug release in vitro the ideal modern wound dressing should provide both immediate ( anesthetic ) drug delivery for pain alleviation and sustained ( antibiotic ) activity for prophylaxis against bacterial infections [ 7 ] .
in the present study , the electrospun nanofibrous ddss of prx and pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer provided drug delivery ranging from two to several hours and exhibited an absence of lag time in the dissolution test in vitro ( figure 7 ) .
it is evident that the amorphous state of prx in the nanofibers leads to a relatively short lag time for the drug release in vitro .
the in vitro drug release profiles of the present nanofibers were found to be also ph and ionic - strength dependent .
as shown in figure 7 , the drug release rate was significantly decreased when the ph of a dissolution medium was increased from ph 1.2 to ph 7.2 , exhibiting a sustained fashion drug release profile at the ph close to the physiological ph of the skin .
the burst release of drug ( in the first hour ) followed by a plateau was observed at lower ph 1.2 , and the drug release rate of prx was slightly decreased when the dissolution medium was changed to purified water .
these findings are in agreement with a recent study by hughey et al .
[ 39 ] .
hughey et al. investigated the effects of kosmotropic salts ( anions ) on the gel strength and solubility behavior of soluplus and stated that at the physiologically relevant temperature of 37degreesc , the cloud point of soluplus was reached in deionized water and phosphate buffer ( ph 6.8 ) but not in 0.1 n hydrochloric acid ( ph 1.2 ) [ 39 ] .
this most likely explains the prolonged drug release profile of the nanofibrous ddss obtained in the present study at ph 7.2 ( phosphate buffer solution ) .
the dissolution of nanofibers at ph 7.2 ( i.e. , close to skin ph ) , however , showed zero - order kinetics and a clear increase in the total time of drug release ( figure 7 ) .
this result is in agreement with the behavior of a water - soluble polymer or of a low - molecular - weight polymer , and suggests an erosion - controlled drug release mechanism from the present nanofibrous mats .
4. conclusions electrospinning can be used to prepare nanofibrous ddss based on a new synthetic pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) with potential application in wound therapy .
moreover , electrospinning and the present copolymer stabilize the amorphous state of prx .
no significant solid - state incompatibilities are expected in the electrospun binary mixtures of prx and the present synthetic graft copolymer .
consistent and sustained - release fashion drug delivery was achieved at the physiologically relevant temperature and ph regions applicable in wound healing and burn therapy .
this sustained - release fashion drug release can be useful in medicated wound dressings for a long - term pain relief or prophylaxis against bacterial infections .
the drug release behavior of the present nanofibers are ph and ionic - strength dependent due to the solubility behavior of pcl - pvac - peg graft copolymer ( soluplus ) .
further studies will be needed on the applicability and performance of these nanofibrous ddss in wound healing and burn therapy applications .

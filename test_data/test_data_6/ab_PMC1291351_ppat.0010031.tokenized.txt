the pulmonary collectin , surfactant protein a ( sp - a ) , is a broad spectrum opsonin with microbicidal membrane permeabilization properties that plays a role in the innate immune response of the lung .
however , the factors that govern sp - a 's microbial specificity and the mechanisms by which it mediates membrane permeabilization and opsonization are not fully understood .
in an effort to identify bacterial factors that confer susceptibility or resistance to sp - a , we used comparative signature - tagged mutagenesis to screen a library of 1,680 pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants for evidence of differential pulmonary clearance in sp - a - sufficient ( sp - a +/+) and sp - a - deficient ( sp - a - / - ) mice .
two sp - a - sensitive p. aeruginosa mutants harboring transposon insertions in genes required for salicylate biosynthesis ( pch ) and phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase ( ptsp ) were recovered .
the mutants were indistinguishable from the parental wild - type pa01 with regard to opsonization by sp - a , but they exhibited increased susceptibility to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
these results suggest that bacterial gene functions that are required to maintain membrane integrity play crucial roles in resistance of p. aeruginosa to the permeabilizing effects of sp - a. synopsis everyday , normal breathing deposits numerous microorganisms on the surfactant membrane that lines the air - exchanging surfaces of the lung .
surfactant protein sp - a , a component of the surfactant membrane , helps to maintain the lung in a germ - free state by aggregating inhaled microorganisms and facilitating their ingestion by immune cells , and by increasing the permeability of their cell membranes .
however , the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa is resistant to sp - a - mediated membrane disruption .
using a genetic tool called comparative signature - tagged mutagenesis , the authors have identified two p. aeruginosa genes , pch and ptsp , that are required to resist sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
molecular analyses indicate that the pch gene encodes an enzyme that synthesizes salicylate , a compound utilized by bacteria to acquire essential metal ions .
the ptsp gene encodes an enzyme called phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase .
the loss of salicylate and phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase weakens the p. aeruginosa cell membrane , which allows sp - a to poke holes on the membrane and kill the bacteria .
this is the first known report of the roles played by salicylate and phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase in maintenance of bacterial membrane , and consequently , protecting bacteria from killing by sp - a , through disruption of membrane integrity .

( 2005 ) comparative signature - tagged mutagenesis identifies pseudomonas factors conferring resistance to the pulmonary collectin sp - a. plos pathog 1 ( 3 ) : e31 .
introduction pulmonary surfactant is a protein - phospholipid complex that lines the air - liquid interface of alveoli , forming the first point of contact with inhaled microbial pathogens [ 1,2 ] .
a multitude of in vitro studies have demonstrated that the pulmonary collectins , surfactant protein a ( sp - a ) and surfactant protein d ( sp - d ) , bind and aggregate bacterial , fungal , viral , and mycobacterial organisms , directly activate macrophages , and enhance the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of a variety of pulmonary pathogens [ 3,4 ] .
recognition of diverse microbial species by the pulmonary collectins is mediated by the c - type lectin domain , which selectively binds to carbohydrates that are prevalent on the surface of microbes , but not to the predominant terminal sugars on surface molecules of mammalian cells [ 5 ] .
more recently , sp - a and sp - d have been reported to possess potent antimicrobial properties [ 6 - 8 ] .
they directly inhibit the proliferation of bacteria and fungi in a macrophage - and aggregation - independent manner , by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane .
in particular , rough strains of gram - negative bacteria , containing truncated lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) domains are uniquely vulnerable to permeabilization by the collectins [ 6 ] , as has been well known for other antimicrobial peptides and proteins .
although the collectins inhibit microbial growth , the factors that govern the specificity and the mechanisms of membrane disruption by the collectins are not understood .
in this study , we employed comparative signature - tagged mutagenesis ( stm ) as a tool to identify bacterial factors required to resist sp - a - mediated clearance , in vivo .
stm relies on the ability of the pathogen in question to replicate in vivo as a mixed population and allows for the identification of the mutants whose phenotypes cannot be trans - complemented by other virulent strains present in the same inoculum [ 9 ] .
two pseudomonas factors that are specifically required to protect p. aeruginosa from killing by sp - a were identified and characterized .
results sp - a - / - mice are susceptible to infection by p. aeruginosa levine et al [ 10 ] have reported that outbred sp - a - / - mice exhibit delayed clearance of a clinical p. aeruginosa strain from the lung , suggesting that sp - a plays a role in pulmonary innate immunity against this organism .
we also found that the inbred c3h / hen sp - a - / - mice were more susceptible to p. aeruginosa infection , in this case by strain pa01 .
sp - a +/+ mice cleared 63 - fold ( 1.8 log ) more of intranasally inoculated pa01 by 16 h ( figure 1a ) .
in contrast , the bacterial load increased by 22 fold ( 1.34 log ) in sp - a - / - mice ( figure 1a ) .
in the absence of infection , sp - a - / - mice are healthy , and the histopathological analyses of their non - infected lungs revealed no significant differences when compare to the lungs of sp - a +/+ mice ( unpublished data ) .
when infected with pa01 however , sp - a +/+ mice developed broncho - pneumonia with mild pulmonary infiltrates ( figure 1b ) .
in contrast , sp - a - / - mice developed more extensive consolidation with areas of lobar pneumonia .
figure 1 sp - a deficient mice are more susceptible to infection by p. aeruginosa ( a ) sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice ( group of six ) were infected intranasally with 1 x 107 p. aeruginosa pa01 .
bacteria were recovered from homogenized lung tissue 16 h after inoculation .
p < 0.01 .

original magnification : 10 x. identification of p. aeruginosa genes conferring resistance to sp - a by comparative stm screening we exploited the pcr - based stm technique and the p. aeruginosa pa01 stm mutant library [ 11 ] to identify putative microbial targets for sp - a. sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice , in groups of three , were intranasally challenged with pools of 72 oligo - tagged stm mutants .
lungs were harvested at 16 h , homogenized , and plated .
at least 10,000 bacterial colonies grown on luria broth ( lb ) agar plates were harvested from each lung for bacterial genomic dna extractions and oligo - tag amplification .
we screened for differential clearance of individual stm mutants using pcr .
if the pcr product of a mutated gene was absent on the output gel in sp - a +/+ mice , but present in sp - a - / - mice ( figure 2a , see arrows ) , we postulated that the bacterial protein encoded by the mutated gene was required to overcome the host defense activities of sp - a. figure 2 pcr - based signature - tagged mutagenesis ( a ) schematic drawing of pcr - based stm .
pools of 72 uniquely tagged mutants were intranasally inoculated into sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice ; 16 h later , lungs were harvested , homogenized , and plated .
approximately 10,000 colonies were harvested from the plates for genomic dna extraction .
pcr - amplification of tags was performed on the genomic dna to screen for the presence or absence of dna tags of each of the 72 mutants .
mutants whose dna tags were present in the input pool and in the sp - a - / - pool , but absent in the sp - a +/+ pool ( see white arrows ) were further screened for susceptibility to sp - a .

attenuation in the first sp - a +/+ mouse ( right panel , m1 ) was confirmed in two additional sp - a +/+ mice ( right panel , m2 and m3 ) .
( c ) genetic loci of p. aeruginosa , when mutated , conferred increased sensitivity to in vivo killing by sp - a. dna regions flanking putmini - tn5 transposon insertions were cloned and sequenced .
similarity blast searches were performed against p. aeruginosa pa01 genomic sequence on ncbi and on http :// www.pseudomonas.com .
black arrows indicate the approximate insertion site within the mutated orfs .
( d ) tlc analyses indicate that the pch stm mutant is unable to synthesize pyochelin ( see arrows ) .
wild - type pa01 grown in lb and the pch mutant grown in lb supplemented with 1 mm salicylate produced green color pyochelin ( see arrows ) .
in contrast , no observable pyochelin was produced by the pch and pa06331 strains .
pure pyochelin was used as control .
( e ) restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis between parental wild - type pa01 and stm mutants confirmed that mutations in pch and ptsp were caused by a single insertion .
we comparatively screened 1,680 stm mutant strains in sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice .
two mutants with increased sensitivity to sp - a ( i.e. , failed to survive in sp - a +/+ mice ) were recovered , for a 0.12 % recovery rate .
we have cloned and sequenced both stm mutants by plasmid rescue [ 11 ] .
dna sequences were analyzed by comparison with online databases ( http :// www.pseudomonas.com ) .
the output from pool 4 ( mutant pch , see below ) is shown in figure 2b ( left panel ) .
in the presence of sp - a , the pch mutant , which is disrupted in a gene required for salicylate biosynthesis , was unable to survive in the sp - a +/+ lung ( missing band in the box , figure 2b ) .
in absence of sp - a , the pch mutant was able to grow in the lung , as indicated by the presence of an oligo - tag amplified by pcr ( figure 2b , left panel , sp - a - / - lane ; right panel , lane m1 ) .
the results were confirmed by pcr analysis of the output pool of two additional mice ( figure 2b , right panel , lanes m2 and m3 ) .
the pch stm mutant carries a transposon putminitn5km2 insertion within an intergenic region in between the 10th and 11th nucleotide after the stop codon of the pcha ( pa4231 ) gene ( figure 2c ) .
the pcha gene encodes an isochorismate synthase that participates in the biosynthesis of the siderophores , salicylate , and pyochelin [ 12 - 14 ] .
because transposon inserted within the intergenic region immediately downstream of the pcha gene , it might have affected the mrna stability of the pchdcba transcript .
thus , we named the stm mutant as pch .
we examined whether the pch mutant had lost the ability to synthesize pyochelin by using thin layer chromatography ( tlc ) assays .
tlc analysis of pyochelin extracted from bacteria cultured in m63 minimal medium confirmed that the pch mutant is unable to synthesize the green - colored pyochelin ( figure 2d , pch lane ) .
in contrast , the parental wild - type pa01 produced pyochelin ( figure 2d , pa01 lane ) .
when the pch stm mutant was grown in the presence of 1 mm salicylate , however , the ability to synthesize pyochelin was restored ( figure 2d , pch + 1mm salicylate lane ) .
the expression of the genes within the downstream operon ( pa4232 and pa4233 ) , which is transcribed in opposite orientation to the pchadcba operon , was found to be unaffected by transposon insertion as assessed by mrna expression analyses ( unpublished data ) .
collectively , these data suggest that susceptibility to sp - a - mediated clearance is caused by the loss of pch gene function , most probably by affecting the mrna stability of the pchdcba operon .
the second sp - a - susceptible stm mutant had the transposon putminitn5km2 inserted in between the 2,213th and 2,214th nucleotides of the ptsp ( pa0337 ) gene ( figure 2c ) .
the ptsp gene encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase , a homolog of the e. coli enzyme initrogen ( eintr ) [ 15 ] .
the transposon putminitn5km2 insertion into ptsp is predicted to cause polarity and interrupt the transcription of pa0338 .
both stm mutants were judged to harbor a single transposon putminitn5km2 insertion after hybridization with the transposon vector ( unpublished data ) .
dna fragments that flanked both ends of the transposon integrations in pcha and ptsp genes were cloned from the wild - type pa01 .
they were used to confirm gene interruption by the integrating transposon , by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflp ) between wild - type pa01 and the stm mutants .
as shown in figure 2e , transposon - flanking dna probes hybridized to dna fragments with higher molecular weights in the chromosomes of both the pch and ptsp mutants than their parental strain pa01 , indicating transposon insertion .
sp - a - sensitive stm mutants are as virulent as parental wild - type in sp - a - / - mice apart from confronting pulmonary host defenses , our stm screens require each mutant to compete with 71 other stm mutants within individual library pools .
competitive mixed infection assays have been widely used to assess the fitness of individual mutants versus their parental strains during in vivo infection [ 16,17 ] .
as shown in figure 3a , when co - administered with the parental wild - type pa01 by intranasal inoculation into mice , both stm mutants were less competitive than pa01 in sp - a +/+ mice .
specifically , mutant strains pch and ptsp were only 53 % and 46 % as competitive as pa01 , respectively .
in contrast , both mutants performed equally well as , if not better than , the wild - type strain in sp - a - / - mice ( figure 3a ) .
figure 3 sp - a - sensitive p. aeruginosa stm mutants compete effectively with parental wild - type pa01 in sp - a - / - , but not in sp - a +/+ mice ( a ) in vivo competition assays between the wild - type and individual stm mutants after intranasal pulmonary inoculation of 6 - wk - old sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice .
the mean cfu recovered from four mice in each group is shown .
the ci is defined as the output ratio of mutant to wild - type bacteria divided by the input ratio of mutant to wild - type bacteria .
* p < 0.013 , # p < 0.011 .
( b ) single respiratory tract infection of pch and ptsp mutants in sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice was performed as described for figure 1 .
attenuation is defined as the log10 difference in cfu between wild - type and mutant bacteria recovered from lung tissue 16 h after inoculation .
the mean +/ - standard error of six mice is shown .
* p < 0.019 , # p < 0.045 .
we further tested the mutants , pch and ptsp , in single infection studies .
when infected singly into wild - type mice , the viable bacterial counts of pch and ptsp mutant bacteria were 32 - fold ( 1.5 log ) and 25 - fold ( 1.4 log ) higher , respectively , in sp - a - / - mice than in sp - a +/+ mice ( figure 3b ) .
our results indicate that sp - a plays an important role in clearance of pa01 mutants with defective pch or ptsp gene function .
preferential clearance of the stm mutants from sp - a +/+ lung is independent of macrophages previous studies have suggested that sp - a opsonizes p. aeruginosa and increases uptake by macrophages [ 10,18 ] .
to determine if sp - a - mediated opsonization contributes to the early clearance of stm mutants , we compared the phagocytosis of pch and ptsp to pa01 in the presence and absence of sp - a. when live , green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) - expressing bacteria were exposed to mouse alveolar macrophages in the presence of sp - a , the uptake of pa01 , its pch , or ptsp mutant was increased by 1.8 , 1.3 , and 1.6 fold , respectively , over that which occurred in the absence of sp - a ( figure 4a ) .
however , the sp - a mediated increase in opsonization was only statistically significant in pa01 ( p < 0.01 ) .
the magnitude of the increase in the uptake of pa01 in the presence of sp - a was similar to previously published reports [ 10,18 ] .
although the addition of sp - a increased the macrophage uptake of stm mutants , enhancement of phagocytosis was slightly lower than that of wild - type pa01 .
therefore , it does not appear that sp - a - mediated opsonization is responsible for the preferential clearance of pch and ptsp mutants from sp - a +/+ mice .
figure 4 bacterial opsonization by sp - a does not result in differential in vivo phagocytosis and killing of stm mutants ( a ) in vitro phagocytosis assays were performed using live , gfp - expressing pa01 and isogenic pch and ptsp bacteria , with alveolar macrophages isolated from sp - a +/+ mice .
internalized bacteria were counted using a phase contrast fluorescence microscope .
the means of three experiments are shown .
two hundred macrophages were counted for each mouse .
p = 0.0058 ( pa01 vs pa01 + sp - a ) , p = 0.075 ( pch vs pch + sp - a ) , and p = 0.109 ( ptsp vs ptsp + sp - a ) .
( b ) in vitro phagocytosis of pa01 , pch , and ptsp by human neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers .
phagocytosis experiments were performed as described for ( a ) .
p = 0.037 ( pa01 vs pa01 + sp - a ) , p = 0.577 ( pch vs pch + sp - a ) , and p = 0.919 ( ptsp vs ptsp + sp - a ) .
( c - e ) sp - a did not affect uptake or killing of stm mutants .
pa01 ( c ) , but not the stm mutants pch ( d ) and ptsp ( e ) were killed in significant amounts by neutrophils , independent of sp - a. the mean of three separate experiments is shown .
p < 0.001 when comparing pa01 versus pa01 + neutrophils , and when comparing pa01 - sp - a versus pa01 - sp - a + neutrophils .
preferential clearance of the stm mutants in sp - a +/+ lung is independent of neutrophils neutrophils are known to play a major role in protecting the lung against bacterial infection .
we examined whether bacterial phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils might have led to preferential clearance of pch and ptsp .
as shown in figure 4b , the uptake of pa01 and the pch and ptsp mutants was not increased in the presence of sp - a. in fact , sp - a - opsonized pa01 bacteria were phagocytosed less efficiently by neutrophils than untreated bacteria .
interestingly , only wild - type pa01 bacteria were susceptible to killing by neutrophils , with approximately 73.7 % killed in the absence of sp - a , and 57.2 % killed in the presence of sp - a ( figure 4c ) .
in contrast , both pch and ptsp mutants were not susceptible to neutrophil killing ( figure 4d and 4e ) .
these results indicate that neutrophils kill p. aeruginosa by using a mechanism independent of sp - a opsonization , and lend support to the notion that neutrophils play a less critical role in the preferential clearance of pch and ptsp mutants from the sp - a +/+ mice than other anti - pseudomonal mechanisms .
the loss of pch and ptsp gene functions render p. aeruginosa susceptible to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization recent studies have indicated that sp - a is capable of directly killing bacteria and fungi by membrane permeabilization and inhibition of macro - molecular synthesis , independent of macrophage - mediated phagocytosis [ 6,7 ] .
we examined whether direct membrane permeabilization contributed to the clearance of the sp - a - sensitive mutants .
due to the previously described importance of lps in resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization [ 6,19 ] , we used a lps mutant wbpl , which is deficient in the production of " initial " glycosyltransferase essential for the biosynthesis of both the a - band and b - band o - antigen of lps [ 20 ] , as positive control for membrane permeabilization assays .
permeabilization of the wbpl mutant was approximately 2.7 - fold greater than the wild - type strain pa01 at 60 min ( figure 5a ) .
in contrast , stmg2a7 , an irrelevant mutant that is virulent in both sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice , was found to be as resistant as parental wild - type pa01 to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability ( figure 5b ) .
figure 5 the pch and ptsp mutants are preferentially permeabilized and killed by sp - a ( a ) fluorescence of a cleavage - activated phosphatase substrate elf97 was examined in the presence or absence of 50 mug hsp - a for a period of 60 - 90 min .
human sp - a ( hsp - a ) preferentially permeabilized lps mutant wbpl , but not the parental wild - type pa01 .
the wbpl strain was used as positive control for membrane permeability .
the difference in membrane permeabilization between wbpl mutant and pa01 was significant from the 28th min onward .
* p < 0.05 .
( b ) a mutant strain stmg2a7 that is virulent in both sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice was as resistant to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization as the parental wild - type pa01 .
( c - d ) membrane permeability of the stm mutant pch and pa06331 , a p. aeruginosa strain which is deleted in all of the structural genes required for pyochelin biosynthesis ( table 1. ) .
the difference in membrane permeabilization between the mutants against wild - type pa01 was significant from the 35th and 18th min onward for mutant strains pch and pa06331 , respectively .
* p < 0.05 .
( e - f ) membrane permeability of the stm mutant ptsp and the deltaptsp , a p. aeruginosa strain with a nonpolar , inframe deletion of the ptsp gene .
the difference in membrane permeabilization between the mutants against wild - type pa01 was significant from the 29th and 28th min onward , for mutant strains ptsp and deltaptsp , respectively .
* p < 0.05 .
table 1 bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work the stm mutant pch , and a mutant strain , pa06331 , in which the pyochelin biosynthetic genes encompassing pchdcba , pchr , and pchefghi operons had been removed [ 14 ] , were permeabilized by sp - a to an extent that was 3.4 - and 2.55 - fold greater than the wild - type strain pa01 , respectively ( figure 5c and 5d ) after 60 - 90 min exposure to sp - a. similarly , stm mutant ptsp , and an in - frame , nonpolar deletion mutant , deltaptsp , were permeabilized by sp - a to an extent that was 3.0 - and 3.8 - fold greater than the wild - type strain pa01 , respectively ( figure 5e and 5f ) , at 60 - 90 min post - exposure to sp - a. these data are comparable to the approximately 3 - fold increase in membrane permeability that sp - a exposure induces in e. coli k12 [ 6 ] .
sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization directly kills the pch and ptsp mutants we next determined if sp - a mediated permeability kills stm mutants .
live / dead staining , based on exclusion of propidium iodide from the live cells , was performed on bacterial cells following membrane permeability assays .
viable cells are stained green while dead cells are stained red .
as shown in figure 6a , sp - a did not kill wild - type pa01 ( green stained ) .
in contrast , mixtures of green - and red - stained cells of pch and ptsp were visible following treatment with sp - a. approximately 11 % and 9 % of pch and ptsp cells , respectively , were killed ( figure 6b ) within 60 min , in comparison to about 40 % of e. coli k12 ( unpublished data ) .
in addition , in contrast to the robust sp - a - induced aggregation of e. coli k12 ( figure 6a ) , sp - a did not aggregate p. aeruginosa pa01 , pch , or ptsp .
these results suggest that the loss of intact lps ( i.e. rough lps ) , or the inability to synthesize salicylate and phosphoenolpyruvate - protein - phosphotransferase , renders the cells vulnerable to membrane permeabilization and killing by sp - a. furthermore , bacterial aggregation does not play a role in preferential clearance of the pch and ptsp mutants .
figure 6 sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization directly kills the pch and ptsp mutants ( a ) live / dead staining was performed on e. coli k12 , pa01 , pch , and ptsp cells , following 1 h membrane permeabilization with 100 mug / ml sp - a. green - stained cells are alive whereas red - stained cells are dead .
( b ) enumeration of live or dead bacteria following a 1 h exposure to hsp - a. at least 600 - 1,000 bacterial cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope .
the mean of two experiments is shown .
complementation of the pch and ptsp mutants restores their resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization the susceptibility of stm mutants to sp - a mediated membrane permeabilization can be exploited for complementation analyses .
as the pch mutant is disrupted in a gene required for salicylate biosynthesis , we performed complementation analysis by growing the pch mutant bacteria in the presence of 1 mm sodium salicylate .
as shown in figure 7a , the pch mutant bacteria grown in lb were susceptible to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
in contrast , the pch mutant bacteria grown in lb supplemented with 1 mm sodium salicylate were fully resistant to membrane permeabilization by sp - a. we further examined whether the increased susceptibility to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability was due to the inability pch bacteria to synthesize the siderophore pyochelin .
the pch bacteria cultured in pyochelin - supplemented lb or iron - deficient minimal medium were still membrane permeabilized by sp - a ( unpublished data ) .
collectively , these results suggest that the increased susceptibility to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability in the pch bacteria is due to their inability to synthesize salicylate , or both salicylate and pyochelin .
however , we cannot completely rule out the possibility that pyochelin may be involved in resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability until we have exhausted all the growth conditions and optimal pyochelin concentrations for the assays .
figure 7 complementation studies of sp - a - sensitive mutants pch and ptsp ( a ) culturing pch bacteria in lb supplemented with sodium salicylate restored its resistance to sp - a mediated membrane permeabilization .
( b ) in control experiments , we demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of bacterial phosphatases in ptsp bacterial cells was not inhibited by 1 mm sodium salicylate .
( c ) provision of the wild - type ptsp gene on the pucp19 in trans ( pucp - ptsp ) restores the ability of stm mutant ptsp to resist sp - a mediated membrane permeabilization .
in contrast , ptsp mutant expressing gfp gene on the pucp19 ( pstp - gfp ) is permeabilized to similar levels as ptsp .
to rule out the possibility that 1 mm sodium salicylate may inactivate the enzymatic activity of the periplasmic phosphatases that cleaves the impermeant substrate , elf97 , in our permeability assay , we also tested ptsp mutant bacteria cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mm sodium salicylate .
the ptsp mutant bacteria were permeabilized to the same extent , regardless of whether they were grown in the presence or absence of 1 mm sodium salicylate ( figure 7b ) , suggesting that salicylate did not inactivate phosphatase .
these results suggest that the loss of pch gene function results in susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to clearance by sp - a by rendering the organism susceptible to membrane permeabilization .
we next tested if providing the wild - type ptsp gene in trans to the ptsp stm mutant bacteria could restore the resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
as shown in figure 7c , the resulting strain , pucp - ptsp was as resistant to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization as the wild - type pa01 .
in contrast , providing an irrelevant gfp gene in the ptsp bacteria ( ptsp - gfp ) did not restore the resistance of ptsp stm mutant to sp - a , nor did it alter the resistance or susceptibility of the parental wild - type pa01 ( pa01 - gfp ) to permeabilization by sp - a ( figure 7c ) .
these results suggest that ptsp gene function protects p. aeruginosa from membrane permeabilization by sp - a. lps profiles of stm mutants previous studies in e. coli [ 6 ] and bordetella pertussis [ 19 ] have demonstrated that the structures of lps on the surface of bacterial cells determine resistance to sp - a - mediated aggregation and membrane permeabilization. p. aeruginosa lps mutants are also sensitive to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability , but are not aggregated by the collectin ( figure 5a ; unpublished data ) .
to examine if the pch and ptsp mutants have lps defects , we compared the lps profiles after separation by sds - page and silver staining .
the lps from wild - type pa01 and the pch mutant were indistinguishable ( unpublished data ) .
however , the two major lps core bands of the ptsp mutant showed a reversal in relative abundance compared with the pa01 ( unpublished data ) .
thus , there may be changes in lps , at least in terms of the proportion of two different cores made .
more detailed molecular analyses will be required to determine if lps modification occurs within pch and ptsp mutants .
discussion the genome - wide mutagenesis scheme called stm was originally developed to identify novel vaccine and antibiotic targets [ 9 ] .
stm relies on the ability of the pathogen in question to replicate in vivo as a mixed population , and allows the identification of the virulence genes whose mutant phenotypes cannot be trans - complemented by other virulent strains present in the same inoculum .
hundreds of virulence factors and putative drug targets have been identified by stm in at least 20 different bacterial and fungal pathogens [ 21 ] .
in all of these screens , a pathogen of interest is mutated by transposon or suicide vector - based insertional strategies .
the vectors are each individually tagged with a dna oligonucleotide to allow mutant identification after selection within the host .
attenuated insertion mutants that are killed by host defense mechanisms such as exposure to sp - a , will fail to amplify from lung homogenates harvested 16 h after intratracheal inoculation ( figure 2a ) .
comparative stm screening using wild - type and genetically altered mice , as presented herein , represents a novel application of the stm technique .
this approach allows the identification of bacterial determinants targeted by specific components of host defense , rather than the entire immune system as a whole .
thus , in contrast to conventional stm screens in wild - type mice , which yield an attenuated mutant recovery rate of 2 % - 10 % [ 21 ] , our comparative stm screen to identify factors that protect bacteria against a specific host innate immunity protein , sp - a , had a yield of only 0.12 % .
as stm screens , by definition , only recover mutations in non - essential genes , another reason for detecting few mutants in this screen is that these genes involved in resistance to sp - a may be essential .
in this study , we have employed stm technology to identify bacterial factors that are required for p. aeruginosa strain pa01 to confer resistance to sp - a. both mutants were susceptible to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization , confirming that disruption of membrane integrity is one of the mechanisms by which sp - a mediates bacterial clearance .
the degree of bacterial membrane permeabilization of the stm mutants by sp - a was comparable to that of e. coli k12 , which has rough lps [ 6 ] .
based on the results of in vitro assays , macrophages and neutrophils do not seem to play important roles in preferential clearance of the pch and ptsp mutants .
however , we cannot exclude the possibility that phagocytosis contributes to the differential clearance of these two mutants in vivo .
thus far , we have not recovered stm mutants that are susceptible to sp - a - mediated opsonization , or mutants that are disrupted in the genes required for lps biosynthesis , which play critical roles in resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeability .
the lack of recovery of opsonization - sensitive and lps mutants are not particularly surprising , considering that we screened only approximately 30 % of the 5,570 mutants required for 1 x genome coverage ( http :// www.pseudomonas.com ) .
additional screenings are being carried out to catalog other p. aeruginosa factors conferring resistance to sp - a. the mechanisms by which mutations in pch and ptsp genes result in susceptibility to sp - a - mediated clearance are briefly discussed below .
the pchdcba gene encodes enzymes involved in the synthesis of iron - chelating siderophores salicylate and pyochelin [ 12 - 14 ] .
in another closely related pathogen , burkholderia cepacia , salicylate is a major siderophore [ 22 ] .
salicylate has also been reported to chelate magnesium ( mg2 +) and calcium [ 23 ] .
thus , it is possible that p. aeruginosa requires salicylate and its downstream product pyochelin to acquire cations .
divalent cations , especially mg2 + , are required to structurally stabilize lps on the outer membrane .
the recently resolved structure of sp - a protein indicates that there are two metal binding domains within sp - a , which are most likely occupied by calcium [ 24 ] .
thus , sp - a may sequester cations from alveolar lining fluid and result in a growth disadvantage for the salicylate - deficient pch mutant .
furthermore , inability to acquire cations may potentially alter the expression , stability , and modification of various transmembrane proteins and glycolipids by enzymes that require cations as cofactors .
thus , we speculate that the pch mutation may have contributed to its increased sensitivity to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization through direct or indirect effects on lps integrity and membrane stability .
the ptsp gene encodes phosphoenolpyruvate - protein phosphotransferase eintr [ 15 ] , a transcriptional regulator of rpon - dependent operons [ 25 ] .
rpon is known to regulate the expression of variety of virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria , including the upregulation of the rfah gene , which is required for increased production of the o - antigen of lps in salmonella enterica serovar typhi during the stationary phase of growth [ 25 ] .
the additional o - antigen production during the stationary phase of bacterial growth may be necessary for resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
ptsp also coordinates carbon and nitrogen metabolism and is required for virulence in p. aeruginosa , by an unknown mechanism [ 26 ] .
mutational inactivation of the azotobacter vinelandii ptsp ortholog affects lipidic poly - hydroxybutyrate accumulation within its cytoplasm as a carbon source for long - term starvation survival [ 27 ] .
interestingly , poly - hydroxybutyrate is found in the plasma membranes of e. coli complexed to calcium polyphosphate , and forms divalent cation - selective channels [ 28 ] .
thus , increased sensitivity to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization in ptsp mutants may be caused by its reduced ability to transport divalent cations necessary to maintain lps and outer membrane integrity .
our results suggest that the killing of p. aeruginosa pa01 and stm mutants is more robust in vivo than in vitro .
one potential explanation for this discrepancy is that our in vitro membrane permeability conditions do not accurately model the environment in the lung .
in addition , it is possible that multiple factors contribute to the killing of p. aeruginosa including sp - a , sp - d , lactoferrin , beta - defensins , and other antimicrobial peptides and proteins [ 29,30 ] .
we are currently examining whether these peptides act synergistically or cooperatively with sp - a in clearance of p. aeruginosa .
decreased sp - a levels have been found in several respiratory diseases including bacterial pneumonia , adult respiratory distress syndrome [ 31,32 ] , and cystic fibrosis [ 33 - 35 ] .
there is some in vitro evidence to suggest that decreased sp - a and sp - d levels in some of these disease states result from degradation by neutrophil proteases of the host [ 36,37 ] , or by proteases of bacterial origin [ 38 ] .
these proteases include bacterial elastases , and neutrophil - derived cathepsin g , elastase , and proteinase - 3 .
the reduced levels of sp - a and sp - d in these lung diseases may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections by variety of microbial pathogens .
degradation of sp - a by p. aeruginosa proteases may also explain our failure to develop informative in vitro stm screens ( unpublished data ) .
antibiotic - resistant p. aeruginosa is an emerging clinical problem that can lead to denial for lung transplantation and death [ 39 ] .
thus , there is an added urgency to explore the use of novel , non - antibiotic - based , anti - pseudomonal peptides to combat life - threatening infections with this organism .
the discovery of factors governing resistance or susceptibility to sp - a may ultimately have therapeutic value .
materials and methods bacterial strains , media , and growth conditions .
shaking cultures of e. coli dh5 - alpha [ 40 ] , sm17lambdapir [ 41 ] , and p. aeruginosa strain pa01 [ 42 ] were grown in lb broth at 37 degreesc .
when needed , lb was supplemented with 1.5 % of bacto agar .
antibiotic selections were performed for e. coli or p. aeruginosa using the following concentrations : carbenicillin ( 50 or 300 mug / ml ) , kanamycin ( 50 or 250 mug / ml ) , and tetracycline ( 5 or 15 - 30 mug / ml ) .
animal husbandry .
the c3h / hen sp - a - / - mice were developed as previously described [ 6,7 ] .
c3h / hen control ( sp - a +/+) mice were purchased from charles river laboratory ( boston , massachusetts , united states ) .
all infections were performed intranasally with age - matched , 6 - wk - old mice .
animals were housed in positively ventilated microisolator cages with automatic recirculating water , located in a room with laminar , high - efficiency , particle accumulation - filtered air .
the animals received autoclaved food , water , and bedding .
mice used in experimental procedures were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at university of cincinnati college of medicine .
comparative screening of the p. aeruginosa stm library in sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice .
the p. aeruginosa pa01 stm library and screening methods were previously described [ 11 ] .
an adapted acute mouse lung pneumonia model of infection was employed , where adult mice rather than the infant mice were used [ 16 ] .
in earlier experiments , we detected no significant difference in sp - a expression by elisa assays at 8 , 16 , and 24 h in sp - a +/+ mouse lungs infected with bacteria ( 1 x 107 cells ) from a representative pool of stm library ( unpublished data ) .
we chose the 16 h time point to screen the stm library because it gave us the most reproducible pcr amplification of dna tags from mutants , with >= 10,000 colony forming units ( cfu ) still recoverable from the sp - a +/+ mice ( unpublished data ) .
in contrast , prolonged infection (>= 36 h ) with 1 x 107 bacteria from stm pool frequently killed sp - a - / - mice ( unpublished data ) .
briefly , sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice [ 6,7 ] were anaesthetized using isofluorane , and were intranasally inoculated with 50 mul ( 1 x 107 cells ) of each individual stm pool .
after 16 h , lungs were removed from sacrificed mice , and homogenized tissues were plated on lb agar plates .
at least 10,000 bacterial colonies recovered after in vivo selection were used for multiplex pcr as described previously [ 11 ] .
twenty sets of 72 mutants ( total = 1,440 ) were pooled and screened .
an additional 240 mutants previously shown to be attenuated in a chronic model of rat lung infection [ 11 ] were also screened .
the mutants that were differentially cleared by sp - a during the in vivo passaging were subsequently retested by single pcr in bacterial cells recovered from three separate mice .
in vivo competitive and single infection assays .
for competition assays , mouse lungs were inoculated intranasally with bacterial cells ( 1 x 107 in 50 mul ) composed of a 1:1 ratio of wild - type pa01 and its isogenic stm mutants .
infected lungs were recovered 16 h after infection for bacterial load determination .
the competitive index ( ci ) is defined as the output ratio of mutant to wild - type bacteria divided by the input ratio of mutant to wild - type bacteria [ 16,17 ] .
thus , if a mutant strain is less competitive than the parental strain from which it was derived , a ci value of < 1 will be achieved , indicating that the mutant is attenuated .
single organism inoculations with individual bacterial strains were performed by the intranasal route in sp - a +/+ and sp - a - / - mice ( group of six ) .
attenuation was defined as the log10 difference in cfu between wild - type and mutant bacteria recovered from lung tissue 16 h after inoculation .
mutant cloning and bioinformatics analysis .
cloning of putative stm mutants were performed as previously described [ 11 ] .
the dna sequences were analyzed with macvector or dna star software .
sequence data was compared with the database available for p. aeruginosa at http :// www.pseudomonas.com .
non - polar deletion and complementation of the ptsp mutant .
non - polar , in - frame deletion of ptsp was generated by pcr : 0.802 and 1.155 - kb 5 ' and 3 ' segments were amplified from target pa01 genomic dna , and each amplicon , which included an engineered restriction site , was ligated into pex18ap [ 43 ] to produce replacement plasmids .
inframe deletion mutants were generated in pa01 via homologous recombination by sucrose resistance selection , and confirmed by hybridization and pcr analysis ( unpublished data ) .
to complement the ptsp mutation , a 4.5 - kb dna fragment containing both the promoter and the ygdp - ptsp - pa0338 operon ( figure 2c ) was pcr - amplified from the wild - type parental strain pa01 using the expand long template pcr system ( roche diagnostic , basel , switzerland ) , and cloned into e. coli - p. aeruginosa shuttle plasmid pucp19 [ 44 ] to obtain pucp19 - ptsp .
the cloned fragment was sequenced to rule out any mutation that was introduced during the amplification .
the pucp19 - ptsp was introduced into p. aeruginosa stm mutant strain ptsp by heat shock .
carbenicillin - resistant transformants were selected , and verified by southern hybridization and pcr methods ( unpublished data ) .
complementation was assessed by resistance to sp - a - mediated membrane permeabilization .
complementation of the pch stm mutant .
complementation of the pch mutant was performed by culturing the bacteria into stationary phase in lb supplemented with 1 mm sodium salicylate .
pyochelin extraction and detection .
pyochelin production in p. aeruginosa was analyzed using the method previously described [ 45 ] .
m63 minimal medium ( 5 ml ) was inoculated with fresh colonies of individual p. aeruginosa strains and incubated at 37 degreesc for 24 h with shaking .
a fresh 30 ml of m63 supplemented with 0.5 % w / v casamino acids was then inoculated with 0.3 ml of starter culture , and incubated for 36 h at 37 degreesc with shaking .
the culture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in 1.5 ml aliquots in a microcentrifuge .
the supernatants were removed into a 50 ml polypropylene screw - capped centrifuge tube , pooled , adjusted to ( ph 2.0 ) with 1m hcl , using universal indicator paper to estimate ph , and filter sterilized through a 0.22 mum membrane .
pyochelin was extracted by the addition of 0.4 volumes of ethyl acetate , followed by vigorous vortexing .
the two phases were separated by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min in a bench top centrifuge , and the upper , organic phase was removed to a separate tube .
pyochelin extract was concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 degreesc in 100 ml round bottomed flasks , and the residue was dissolved in 300 mul of methanol .
pyochelin extracts ( 10 mul ) was separated by tlc ( silica gel 60 , plastic backed , from sigma , st. louis , missouri , united states ) , using acetone : methanol : 0.2m acetic acid ( 5:2:1 ) as a development solvent .
the chromatography tank was left to stand for several minutes with its lid on to allow the air inside to become saturated with solvent vapor .
pyochelin , which is fluorescent , naturally occurs as two stereoisomers .
when visualized under a uv transilluminator , it is revealed as two green fluorescent bands .
pyochelin standard was generously provided by dr. j. m. meyer ( universite louis pasteur ) .

assays of p. aeruginosa permeability .
the effect of the sp - a on p. aeruginosa cell wall integrity was assessed by determining permeability to a phosphatase activity substrate , enzyme - labeled fluorescence 97 ( elf - 97 , molecular probes , eugene , oregon , united states ) as described [ 7 ] .
sp - a was incubated with 1 x 108 bacterial cells / ml in 100 mul of 5 mm tris , 150 mm nacl for 15 min at 37 degreesc , and 100 mum elf97 phosphatase substrate was added .
fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 535 nm , respectively , for a period of 60 - 90 min .
in vitro macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis assays .
freshly lavaged mouse macrophages (~ 5 x 105 from 3 spa +/+ mice ) were cultured on chamber plastic culture slides , coated with 5 % poly - d - lysine with 200 mul rpmi ( dulbecco 's , containing 2.5 mg / l gentamycin and 0.1 % bsa ) and used immediately .
macrophages were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 .
live gfp - expressing pa01 or isogenic stm mutants in rpmi were opsonized with or without 25 mug / ml human sp - a for 1 h at 37 degreesc with rotation .
the medium was removed from each well and replaced with 250 mul of opsonized pa01 or stm mutants , and incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 at a ratio of 100 bacteria to 1 macrophage .
chamber slides were washed three times with pbs containing 1 mm cacl2 .
extracellular bacteria were quenched with crystal violet ( 0.8 mg / ml ) .
following two additional washes , cells were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde in pbs plus 1 mm cacl2 for 10 min , and stained with evans blue for 2 min .
the percentage of macrophages with engulfed bacteria was quantified under a phase contrast fluorescence microscope .
at least 200 macrophages were counted .

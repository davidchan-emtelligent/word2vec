n 6 - benzoyladenine - cyanoborane ( 2 ) , and 6 - triphenylphosphonylpurine - cyanoborane ( 3 ) were selected for investigation of cytotoxicity in murine and human tumor cell lines , effects on human hl - 60 leukemic metabolism and dna strand scission to determine the feasibility of these compounds as clinical antineoplastic agents .
compounds 2 and 3 both showed effective cytotoxicity based on ed50 values less than 4 mug / ml for l1210 , p388 , hl - 60 , tmolt3 , hut - 78 , hela - s3 uterine , ileum hct - 8 , and liver hepe - 2 .
compound 2 had activity against ovary 1 - a9 , while compound 3 was only active against prostate pl and glioma um. neither compound was active against the growth of lung 549 , breast mcf - 7 , osteosarcoma hso , melanoma sk2 , kb nasopharynx , and thp - 1 acute monocytic leukemia .
in mode of action studies in human leukemia hl - 60 cells , both compounds demonstrated inhibition of dna and protein syntheses after 60 min at 100 mum .
these compounds inhibited rna synthesis to a lesser extent .
the utilization of the dna template was suppressed by the compounds as determined by inhibition of the activities of dna polymerase alpha , m - rna polymerase , r - rna polymerase and t - rna polymerase , which would cause adequate inhibition of the synthesis of both dna and rna .
both compounds markedly inhibited dihydrofolate reductase activity , especially in compound 2 .
the compounds appeared to have caused cross - linking of the dna strands after 24 hr at 100 mum in hl - 60 cells , which was consistent with the observed increased in ct - dna viscosity after 24 hr at 100 mum .
the compounds had no inhibitory effects on dna topoisomerase i and ii activities or dna - protein linked breaks .
neither compound interacted with the dna molecule itself through alkylation of the nucleotide bases nor caused dna interculation between base pairs .
overall , these antineoplastic agents caused reduction of dna and protein replication , which would lead to killing of cancer cells .

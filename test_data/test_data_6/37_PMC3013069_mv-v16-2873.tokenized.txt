purpose whereas much information is available on rod outer segment phagocytosis by the retinal pigmented epithelium ( rpe ) , corresponding data for cones are quite limited , especially in laboratory models of normal rats and mice with very low cone numbers .
to characterize the light and circadian control of cone photoreceptor phagocytosis in mice , we capitalized on the blue cone - like phenotype of neural retina leucine zipper gene ( nrl ) null mice ( nrl - / - ) .
methods nrl - / - mice were maintained under standard cyclic light ( 12h : 12h light - dark [ ld ] cycle ; light = 300 lux ) for one month , then divided into two groups : 1 ) continued maintenance in ld ( 36 mice ) ; or 2 ) transferred to constant darkness ( dd ; 21 mice ) for 36 h. animals were sacrificed every 3 h over 24 h , and their eyes were rapidly enucleated and fixed .
cryosections were stained using specific cone short - wavelength opsin antibodies .
phagosome numbers in the rpe were quantified with a morphometric system .
we monitored the expression of c - mer proto - oncogene tyrosine kinase ( mertk ) in wild - type and knockout mice using a specific mertk antibody .
results in ld , cone phagocytosis showed a statistically significant peak of activity 1 h after light onset , 2 - 3 fold higher than at other times .
in constant darkness , the temporal phagocytic profile resembled that of ld ( significant peak at 1 h of subjective day ) , but the number of phagosomes was decreased at all time points .
immunostaining of mertk in wild - type and nrl - / - mice showed expression at the apical surface of the rpe .
conclusions cone - like outer segment phagocytosis in nrl - / - mice shows a similar profile to that of rods in normal mice and other species .
these data are the first to quantify blue cone - like photoreceptor phagocytosis under different lighting conditions in mice , and suggest this model may constitute a valuable system for investigating circadian regulation of cone function .
galleystatusexport to xmlcorr - authorhicks introduction retinal photoreceptors ( rp ) are composed of two different populations , rods , and cones .
rods are used for nocturnal vision because of their high light sensitivity [ 1 ] , whereas cones require a relatively high light level to activate them , and are used for diurnal vision [ 2 ] .
the latter are responsible for color discrimination and high - acuity vision , and are of utmost importance in human vision .
in humans and old world primates , there are three types of cones , containing blue , green , and red light - sensitive pigments ( or short wavelength sensitive ( s ) cones [ 3 ] , and middle / long wavelength sensitive cones , respectively ) .
in the great majority of mammals , there are only two cone types : a short wavelength - sensitive and a mid / long wavelength - sensitive population [ 4 ] .
both rods and cones are known to undergo continuous cyclic turnover , involving the addition of new membranes at the base of the outer segment ( os ) and the removal of aged membranes at the distal pole [ 5 ] .
this removal is achieved by the opposing retinal pigmented epithelium ( rpe ) , which phagocytose and digest the shed os membranes [ 6 ] .
in recent years , much progress has been made in identifying molecular components of the phagocytic pathway , including membrane - bound receptors such as mertk and alphavbeta5 integrin , and ligands [ 7 - 9 ] .
mutations in the mertk receptor lead to inherited retinal degeneration in animals [ 7,10 ] and humans [ 11 ] .
the great majority of data have been obtained for rods , in part because conventional laboratory rodent ( mouse and rat ) retinas are composed of 97 % rods and only ~ 3 % cones [ 12,13 ] .
a genetically modified mouse line has become available for the study of rod differentiation , the neural retina leucine zipper gene ( nrl ) knockout mouse ( nrl - / - ) [ 14 ] .
deletion of the transcription factor nrl results in the complete absence of rods , as revealed by histology , immunocytochemistry , electrophysiology , and gene expression analysis [ 14,15 ] .
morphological , molecular , and electrophysiological features of the nrl - / - photoreceptors seem to be identical to blue or short wavelength light - sensitive s cones [ 14 ] .
hence , this retina provides a potential means for the investigation of blue cone function and cone - specific genes [ 16 ] .
in the present study , we have used homozygous nrl - / - mice to ask whether cone phagocytosis shows daily rhythms , if any such rhythms resemble or differ from those known for rods , and whether these rhythms are maintained under constant darkness .
we show that rhythmic phagocytosis does indeed occur , in both cyclic light and constant darkness , and that it resembles rod behavior .
methods animals and handling this study was conducted with nrl - / - mice , raised in our animal facilities .
the strain was originally obtained from dr. c. grimm at the laboratory of retinal cell biology , university hospital , switzerland , with permission from dr. a. swaroop ( nih , bethesda , md ) .
the colony was maintained on a 12 h : 12 h light - dark ( ld ) cycle in an ambient temperature of 22 degreesc for four weeks .
young adult wild - type c57bl / 6 mice ( n = 3 ) , the strain on which the knockout line was created , were used as a positive control for antibody binding and specificity .
all experiments were conducted according to ethical guidelines in operation at the institute , and adhered to the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research .
two experimental series were made ( shown schematically in figure 1 ) : in the first group , a total of 36 knockout mice were used , composed of mostly young adults ( 2 months , n = 30 ) , with some individuals of 5 months ( n = 6 ) .
older individuals were spread equally among sample points to eliminate any age - related bias .
animals were euthanized every 3 h during the ld cycle ( n = 4 for each time point ) .
lights were turned on at 7 am , defined as zeitgeber time , hour zero ( zt0 ) .
animals were killed at zt1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , and 22 , and at an additional point in the following 24 h cycle ( zt24 + 1 ) .
the second group of animals ( n = 21 ) was raised in ld until they reached young adulthood ( 2 months ) .
the animals were then placed in total darkness ( constant darkness [ dd ]) , for 36 h , and therefore experienced a complete cycle of subjective day and night before sample collection .
euthanasia commenced at circadian time ( ct ) 1 ( i.e. , 1 h after subjective light onset ) , and continued every 3 h at ct4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , and 16 ( n = 3 per time point ) .

arrow in series 2 indicates times at which animals were switched to constant darkness condition .
thin vertical bar joined by a horizontal bar indicates the beginning and end of the sampling period .
series 1 is the control condition , with animals maintained under light - dark conditions ( alternating white bars [ 12 h light = 300 lux ,] and black bars [ 12 h dark ]) throughout the experiment .
series 2 represents total darkness ( alternating black dots on a white background [ subjective day ] and black bars ) .
in both groups during the night time ( i.e. , zt12 - 24 for ld cycles and permanently for dd ) , darkness was total ( no background dim red light ) , and euthanasia and enucleation were performed using night vision goggles .
for every time point and in both groups , eyes were rapidly removed by dissecting the surrounding ocular muscle and optic nerve .
a small hole was made with a 25 - gauge hypodermic needle at the level of the ora serrata , and eyeballs were fixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde in buffered phosphate saline ( 0.1 m pbs ; l .
91 , nacl 7.34 g / l , kcl 270 mg / l , na2hpo4 10 mg / l , nah2po4 3 mg / l , ph 7.3 ) , at 4 degreesc .
immunohistochemistry and quantification eyes were rinsed in cold pbs for 1 h , then transferred to an ascending series of sucrose solutions ( 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % , each for 2 h ) and embedded in optimal cutting temperature resin ( tissue tek ; sakura fintek , tokyo , japan ) , and 10 mum thick cryostat sections were prepared and stored at - 20 degreesc until ready for use for staining .
immunostaining and quantification of phagosomes was performed as published previously by us [ 17 ] .
briefly , sections were permeabilized and then saturated with pbs containing 3 % bsa , 0.1 % tween - 20 , and 0.1 % sodium azide ( buffer a ) for 30 min .
sections were incubated overnight at 4 degreesc with polyclonal anti - mouse s - cone opsin antibody [ 18 ] ( the generous gift of dr. cheryl craft , doheny eye institute , university of california , los angeles , ca ) at a ~ 1 microg / ml final concentration in buffer a. antibody binding was visualized using secondary fluorescent conjugated anti - rabbit igg - alexa 594 ( molecular probes ltd. , eugene , or ) .
since the nrl - / - retina exhibits partial degeneration with a scalloped appearance of the outer nuclear layer and the formation of rosettes [ 14 ] , quantitative measurements were performed only in areas devoid of rosettes and degenerated cells .
any immunopositive structure with a diameter of >= 1 mum lying within the rpe sub - cellular space ( visualized by faint background lighting to show pigmentation ) was scored as a phagosome .
counting of phagosomes was performed by aligning a 150x150 mum grid placed within the eyepiece , parallel with the rpe layer [ 17 ] .
the phagosome counts are expressed as the sum of all four sections per eye .
for comparative studies on phagocytic activity among different species , we also processed frozen sections of adult wistar rats and adult c57bl6 mice , from animals killed at zt1 .
these sections were only stained with anti - rhodopsin ( rho4d2 ) antibody [ 19 ] as described above , and analyzed for rod phagosome numbers using the same morphometric grid procedure .
we also performed immunostaining for mertk using a rabbit polyclonal mertk antibody ( the generous gift of dr. g. lemke , scripps institute , la jolla , ca ) [ 20 ] to verify the expression and distribution of mertk in the rpe of nrl - / - mice , compared to wild - type mice .
wild - type mouse retinal sections were double - immunolabeled with mertk and monoclonal anti - rhodopsin antibody rho - 4d2 .
antibody binding was detected with anti - rabbit igg - alexa 594 and anti - mouse igg - alexa 488 , following the protocol given above .
nrl - / - mouse retinal sections were processed differently , to visualize the correspondence of mertk and cone os : consecutive serial sections of retina were immunostained with mertk ( detected with anti - rabbit igg - alexa 594 ) and anti - s - cone opsin ( detected with anti - rabbit igg - alexa 488 ) , and the two patterns aligned .
in all experiments , 4,6 - di - amino - phenyl - indolamine was added during the second incubation to stain nuclei .
slides were washed thoroughly with pbs , then mounted in pbs : glycerol ( 1:1 ) and observed under a fluorescence microscope ( optiphot 2 ; nikon , melville , ny ) .
images were obtained by charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera video capture linked to a dedicated personal computer containing image analysis software ( bia ; nikon ) .
statistics all graphical analysis for phagocytosis was done with excel software , and all statistical analysis was done with r and statistica 8 software ( statsoft , creteil , france ) using an analysis of variance ( anova ) test .
when anova indicated significant differences ( p = 0.05 ) , a post hoc analysis ( tukey test ) was performed .
results figure 2 shows a representative image of nrl - / - mouse retinal sections stained with anti s - cone antibody .
heavy staining of the cone os ( cos ) region is seen , corresponding to concentration of s - cone pigment in this cellular compartment .
in sections made from mice killed at zt1 under ld conditions , there are scattered discrete fluorescent dots visible within the pigmented band of rpe ( arrows , figure 2a ) .
in sections made at zt19 , cos staining is unchanged , but there are fewer fluorescent inclusions seen in the rpe ( figure 2b ) .
similarly , in sections made from mice maintained in dd and killed at ct1 , there are also immunopositive spots in the rpe ( arrows , figure 2c ) , whereas retinal sections from mice killed at ct19 contain fewer such profiles within the rpe layer ( figure 2d ) .
immunostaining of wild - type mouse retinas with antis - cone opsin shows the occasional labeled cos ( figure 2e ) .

c and d : these two sections were taken from animals killed under total darkness conditions at , respectively , hour 1 and hour 10 circadian time. .
sections immunolabeled with s - cone opsin antibody show the continuous row of cone outer segments across the section , and the presence of numerous immunoreactive inclusions ( phagosomes = ph ) within the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ; short arrows ) at zt1 and ct1 , but not at zt10 and ct10 .
e : s - cone opsin immunostaining of wild - type mouse retina ( zt6 ) shows the presence of occasional labeled cos ( long arrows ) .
rpe , retinal pigment epithelium ( the approximate level of the basal surface of the rpe ) is shown by a dashed line in panels a - d. scale bar in e represents 10 mum for all panels .
quantification of fluorescent inclusions within the rpe layer showed marked fluctuations as a function of time of day .
under ld conditions , there was a distinct peak at zt1 , with phagosome numbers between 2 and fourfold higher than at all other time points ( figure 3a ) .
this value was highly significantly different from all other time points in the day or night .
phagosome numbers fell quickly to baseline levels , to roughly 50 % lower at zt4 and 70 % lower by zt7 .
there was a tendency toward a smaller second peak at zt13 ( 1 h after lights - off ) , but this did not attain statistical significance .
thereafter , phagosome numbers were minimal ( 30 % - 40 % the values at zt1 ) , before rising steeply again following the night - day transition .
a very similar temporal profile was seen when nrl - / - mice were maintained under dd conditions for 36 h before sampling .
although the amplitude of phagocytosis was reduced by approximately 40 % - 50 % at all time points , the shape matched closely that seen in ld , with a pronounced peak at ct1 , some 2 - 4 fold higher than other points ( figure 3b ) .
figure 3 cone shedding in nrl - / - mice shows rhythmic activity in both cyclic light and constant darkness .
phagosome counts were made made every 3 h throughout both the light and dark periods under light - dark ( ld ) conditions ( a ) and through subjective light and dark periods under constant darkness ( dd ) conditions ( b ) .
a burst in the number of cone phagosomes was seen at zt1 ( ld ) and at circadian time ( ct1 ; total darkness ) , significantly different from all other values (*** p < 0.001 ) .
phagosome numbers were lowest in late daytime .
to see whether nrl - / - mice expressed the mertk receptor , we also performed immunolabeling of wild - type and knockout mice retinal sections with a specific mertk antibody .
wild - type mouse retinas underwent double immunolabeling against rhodopsin and mertk .
the rod os were intensely immunolabeled with anti - rhodopsin antibody ( figure 4a ) .
the mertk immunostaining pattern was similar , with staining of the sub - retinal space corresponding to the apical microvilli of the rpe ( figure 4b ) .
merged images showed that the mertk distribution extended almost the length of the os ( figure 4c ) .
in nrl - / - mice retinas , as before , s - cone opsin staining was prominent in the shortened cone os ( figure 4d ) .
mertk was localized to the interface between the rpe monolayer and outer nuclear layer ( onl ) , the staining being limited to a narrow band and not extending into the sub - retinal space as in the wild - type retina ( figure 4e ) .
the general morphology of the posterior pole in nrl - / - mice is shown in figure 4f .
figure 4 expression of mertk in retinal pigmented epithelium ( rpe ) of wild - type and nrl - / - mice .
in wild - type mice , the photoreceptor outer segment ( pos ) is intensely stained by rhodopsin antibody ( a ) , and mertk overlaps to a large extent with this stain ( b ) .
however , the mertk label does not extend all the way to the base of the photoreceptor os , so the merged image ( c ) shows a mixture of green ( overlapping stain ) and green ( rhodopsin only ) .
this is further illustrated by the two arrows ( white to show the width of the rhodopsin stain , gray to show the width of the mertk stain ) .
s - cone opsin immunostaining in nrl - / - retinas shows aligned short pos ( d ) , and the pattern of mertk expression in nrl - / - rpe is much reduced , compared to wild - type retinas , appearing as a discontinuous thin band running along the interface between the rpe and outer nuclear layer ( onl ; arrow in e ) .
f : the general structure of the nrl - / - retina is seen by 4,6 - di - amino - phenyl - indolamine ( dapi ) staining of nuclei , showing the monolayer of rounded nuclei within the rpe ( arrow ) .
scale bar represents 10 microm .
to see whether the overall phagocytic activity of blue cones in nrl - / - mice resembled values for " normal " rods and cones from other rodent species and strains under similar conditions , we calculated the number of phagosomes ( rods and cones ) seen at peak amplitude ( zt1 / ct1 ) , and normalized this to the number of rod - or cone - cell bodies within the same region .
to reduce variability from the use of different techniques , we analyzed samples from normal wild - type mice , laboratory wistar rats , and the diurnal rodent arvicanthis ansorgei , all assayed with our immunohistochemical procedure .
we also included data from published reports on two other species in which cat and chicken cone phagocytosis has been examined : .
table 1 expresses these values per 100 cell bodies .
in four of the five species examined , peak cone activity was quite similar ( 8 - 12 phagosomes / 100 cones ) ; only in the cat were numbers considerably higher ( 20 phagosomes / 100 cells ) .
rod phagosome frequencies in normal mice and rats were very close to the values for cone phagosomes in nrl - / - mice , whereas rod activity was much higher in arvicanthis ( 38 phagosomes / 100 rods ) .
table 1 comparison of phagosome numbers between rods and cones and between different species .
species peak cone value peak rod value references cat ~ 20 per 100 cones - [ 25 ] chick ~ 12 per 100 cones - [ 21 ] arvicanthis ~ 9 per 100 cones ~ 38 per 100 rods present study wistar rat - ~ 7 par 100 rods present study c57bl6 - ~ 6 par 100 rods present study nrl - / - ~ 8 per 100 cones - present study to compare numbers between different retinas , these were calculated as a fraction of 100 cell bodies , either from our own data ( rats , mice , arvicanthis ) or from previously cited information ( cat , chicken ) .
the percentage of phagosomes is quite similar between most of the different examples , except the elevated rod phagosome number in arvicanthis .
discussion we have used the all - cone nrl - / - mouse to document the temporal profile of cone phagocytosis under two lighting conditions - - standard cyclic light and permanent darkness .
the data show that mouse s cone - like photoreceptors , like rods , exhibit a daily rhythm in os debris shedding / uptake by the rpe , and that this process shows a marked peak in activity shortly after light onset .
cyclic light and / or circadian - driven rhythms in photoreceptor os phagocytosis have been extensively explored in many species .
peak rod phagocytosis seems to be invariable , and occurs shortly after light onset in every species ( nocturnal and diurnal ) that has been studied , ( e.g. , chickens [ 21 ] , mice [ 22 ] , rats [ 23 ] , ground squirrels [ 24 ] , cats [ 25 ] , and rhesus monkeys [ 26 ]) .
data on cone phagocytosis are less abundant but show more irregularity .
most studies show maximal cone shedding in the night , as in diurnal chickens [ 21 ] , fence lizards [ 27 ] , tree squirrels [ 28 ] , ground squirrels [ 24 ] , and rhesus monkeys [ 26 ] .
some studies show the maximal cone peak at the beginning of the day , both in nocturnal species such as cats [ 25 ] and in diurnal species such as tupaia [ 29 ] and arvicanthis ansorgei [ 17,30 ] .
since mammals contain , in the great majority , mid / long wavelength cones [ 4,31 ] , these studies have not provided information on the numerically minor s cones .
indeed , before the present investigation , it was not even known whether s cones underwent phagocytic turnover .
the nrl - / - mouse thus represents a unique opportunity to analyze this population .
it should be stated that cone identity in such mutant mice may not be strictly normal , and that the retina of this strain undergoes partial degeneration at an early age [ 14 ] .
however , by a range of structural and functional criteria , they appear to be true cones [ 14,15 ] .
our results show that in nrl - / - mice , rhythmic phagocytosis occurs under normal cyclic conditions , where it may be regulated by light and / or an endogenous circadian clock .
under conditions of constant darkness , rod shedding continues with a profile similar to that of cyclic light [ 22,23,30,32 ] .
data for cone phagocytosis under constant darkness are scarce .
in the cone - dominated retinas of fence lizards , rhythmic shedding continued when animals were placed in prolonged darkness , and the amplitude of shedding was greatly reduced [ 27 ] , as seen in the present study .
in our own studies on the diurnal rodent , arvicanthis ansorgei , cone shedding also continued with the same profile in dd as in ld , but overall activity was actually enhanced by about 50 % [ 30 ] .
in this latter case , only mid / long wavelength cones were studied , and so the contrasting results may have reflected the altered responses of the two spectral types .
but rod shedding also shows variable responses to prolonged darkness in terms of amplitude , with some studies showing increased activity [ 30,33 ] and others showing decreased activity [ 32 ] .
regardless , the continued cyclic shedding during constant darkness demonstrates the functioning of an endogenous circadian clock , capable of generating rhythmic behavior in the absence of light cues .
this clock is able to synchronize peak shedding to the approximate beginning of day , at least after a single 24 h period of complete darkness .
some observations on s - cone shedding as a function of lighting conditions deserve comment .
according to our observations in wild - type mice , rats , and arvicanthis ansorgei , and using previously published data from cats [ 25 ] and chickens [ 21 ] , the relative maximal rate of phagocytosis is overall quite similar between rods and cones , and between species .
these values are approximate , given that our data collection points may not have coincided precisely with actual peak activity , that we did not take into account differences in cell body or os size , and that actual turnover rates for rods and cones are not known for all these species .
but given the reduced cell density of ~ 80 % , compared to the wild type [ 14 ] , the length of os [ 14 ] and rpe microvilli (~ 5 - 7 microm in wild - type : [ 20 ] ; ~ 3 microm in nrl - / - : [ 14 ]) in nrl - / - retinas , it is perhaps surprising that the phagocytic amplitude is so high ( comparable to that of rods in normal mice ) .
this is different from arvicanthis , in which there is a clear difference in the turnover rates of rods and cones .
cone phagocytosis cannot be quantified in wild - type mouse retinas , because of the low cone numbers ( 3 % - 4 %) [ 12 ] and diffuse distribution .
furthermore , rods are absent from the nrl - / - retina , so we are unable to compare data between the two strains .
for the moment , we can only speculate that phagocytosis rates are perhaps related to relatively high turnover in s cones , or to a particular feature of the mutant retina ( e.g. , ongoing degeneration ) .
finally , the variability between species in terms of daily cone phagocytosis profiles , with in some cases an evening peak [ 21,24,26 - 28 ] , and in others a morning peak overlapping with rods [ 25,29,30 ] , makes it difficult to predict what the corresponding temporal cone profile would be in normal mice .
the question is important , since two theoretical scenarios are possible : ( 1 ) normal mice have an evening cone peak ( similar to most species studied ) , in which case the developmental switch from rods to cones in the nrl - / - mouse leaves the s cone - like cells with a partial functional rod phenotype ; or ( 2 ) normal mice also have a morning cone peak , and the nrl - / - strain has a more fully cone - like functional phenotype .
although the level of expression is reduced compared to wild - type mouse eyes , mertk is clearly present at the apical rpe surface in nrl - / - mice , where it presumably participates in the binding and uptake of shed cone membranes , as in rats [ 7 ] and wild - type mice [ 34 ] .
the distribution of the staining patterns for mertk and s - cone opsin , showing shortened microvilli and os respectively , suggests that rpe / os interactions must be less intimate than in wild - type retinas .
in summary , the nrl - / - mouse presents a unique opportunity to examine cone shedding ( moreover , blue cone shedding ) in the otherwise highly rod - dominant mouse retina , and represents a valuable model to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in cone recycling .

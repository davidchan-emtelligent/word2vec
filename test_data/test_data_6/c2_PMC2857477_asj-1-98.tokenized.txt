there are no reports of a 7 - day delay in the onset of neurological deterioration because of a spinal epidural hematoma ( seh ) after a spinal fracture .
a hematoma was detected from the t12 to l2 area in a 36 - year - old male patient with a t12 burst fracture .
on the same day , the patient underwent in situ posterior pedicle instrumentation on t10 - l3 with no additional laminectomy .
on the seventh postoperative day , the patient suddenly developed weakness and sensory changes in both extremities , together with a sharp pain .
a mri showed that the hematoma had definitely increased in size .
a partial laminectomy was performed 12 hours after the onset of symptoms .
two days after surgery , recovery of neurological function was noted .
this case shows that spinal surgeons need to be aware of the possible occurrence of a delayed aggravated seh and neurological deterioration after a spinal fracture .
spinal epidural hematoma spine fracture neurology introduction a spinal epidural hematoma ( seh ) is a rare entity that was first reported by jackson in the 17th century1 .
an seh occurs spontaneously in most cases .
however , in some cases , an seh occurs due to vascular abnormalities such as an arterio - venous malformation ( avm ) , a vertebral hemangioma , obstetrical birth trauma , and a spinal trauma2 .
the frequency of an seh related to spinal fractures has been reported to range from 0.5 to 7.5 % 1,3 .
foo and rossier3 reported that although an seh caused by a spinal fracture is rare , it requires surgical decompression because an acute progressive neurological deficit appears in most cases .
we encountered a patient who did not show any neurological deficit immediately after a spinal fracture .
however , 7 days after the spinal fracture fixation , the patient suddenly developed delayed neurological deterioration on both lower extremities .
this is the first report showing an increase in size of an epidural hematoma on a repeated mri after the exacerbation of the neurological deficit .
case report a 36 - year - old male patient was admitted to our hospital with paraparesis on both lower extremities that had developed suddenly 2 hours prior to admission .
seven days prior the patient had suffered back pain as a result of a direct fall on the lumbar region , and was diagnosed with a burst fracture with a distraction force on t12 ( fig. 1c ) .
the patient underwent an mri examination on the thoraco - lumbar area on the same day at another hospital ( fig. 1d ) .
the mri showed a collapse of the t12 vertebral body and t12 - l1 inter - spinous widening .
the lesion was isointense on t1 - weighted images and hyperintense on t2 - weighted images .
a hematoma was detected from the t12 to l2 area .
the hematoma displaced the spinal cord and cauda equina ( fig. 2 ) .
no neurological deficits were noted .
on the same day , the patient underwent in situ posterior pedicle instrumentation on t10 - l3 but a laminectomy was not performed .
non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , which influence blood coagulation , were not administered after surgery .
a postoperative neurological status was not detected .
three days after surgery , the patient was encouraged to ambulate , and could walk without difficulty .
seven days after surgery , the patient suddenly developed weakness and sensory changes in both extremities together with a sharp pain .
consequently , the patient was transferred to the emergency room .
in the initial neurological examination performed in the emergency room , the strength of the hip flexion on the right side was trace ( 1 / 5 ) and was zero below the knee ( 0 / 5 ) .
on the left side , the ankle dorsiflexion was poor ( 2 / 5 ) , and was zero below the ankle ( 0 / 5 ) .
the sensory was decreased to below the l1 dermatome .
the knee and ankle jerk were decreased , and the bulvocavenous reflex and anal tone were also decreased .
medical records revealed that the patient had been treated in our hospital for an unstable l1 burst fracture 3 years prior using posterior instrumentation on t12 - l2 and anterior interbody fusion with an autoiliac bone graft .
one year ago , the patient had the posterior instrument removed ( fig. 1a and b ) .
no bleeding tendency was noted in the medical history .
a laboratory test showed that the blood profile i.e. the platelet count , prothrombin time , activated prothombin time , bleeding time , and coagulation time were within the normal ranges .
an mri performed 6 hours after the development of symptoms in the emergency room showed a heterogeneous isointense lesion on t1 - weighted images , and a hematoma that was heterogeneous hypointense on t2 - weighted images that had definitely increased in size , as detected on the sagittal plane and axial plane images ( fig. 3 ) .
twelve hours after the development of symptoms , a partial t12 - l3 laminectomy was performed under general anesthesia .
the hematoma filled the epidural space completely and ranged from the t12 to l2 level .
a hematoma evacuation was performed , and no definite bleeding focus was detected .
two days after surgery , a recovery of neurological function was noted .
one year after surgery , the hypoesthesia was below the right l5 dermatome , the ankle dorsiflexion on the right side was good ( 4 / 5 ) but was slightly lower than normal .
however , the other neurological functions had returned to normal .
discussion since a spinal epidural hematoma was first reported in the 17th century , there have been more than 260 case reports1 .
many cases have been spontaneous and most often there has been an association with coagulopathy or the use of anticoagulant therapy .
however , rare cases of an seh due to a spinal fracture , obstetrical birth trauma , lumbar puncture , post - surgical bleeding , epidural anesthesia , and missile injury have also been reported2,3. of these cases , an seh associated with a spinal fracture is rarer , and the incidence has been reported to range from 0.5 % to 7.5 % 3,4 .
the most common site of an seh in males is the lower cervical and thoracolumbar spine , and the lower thoracic spine is the most common site of an seh in females .
the bleeding associated with an seh is known to originate from the venus plexus in the epidural space .
the causality has been reported to be an obstruction of the valveless epidural vein plexus in response to trauma or transmission of a suddenly increased intrathoracic or intraabdominal pressure4,5 .
in addition , epidural hemorrhage is frequently located dorsal to the spinal cord because of the tight fixation of the dura to the vertebral bodies6,7 .
it has been reported that in most cases of an seh accompanying a spinal trauma particularly fractures , acute sensory and motor deficits develop within minutes to hours , and within 3 days in rare cases .
the seh subsequently progresses to complete paralysis or the loss of urinary control or sphincter function3,8 .
foo and rossier3 reported that in a comparison of patients with accompanying spine fractures and those without fractures , the interval of the trauma and the onset of paresis was shorter in those patients with accompanying spine fractures .
in our case , mri was performed immediately after the trauma , and the seh was detected from the t12 to l2 level .
however , a neurological deficit did not develop for 7 days .
although we are unable to explain the pathomechanism of the delayed onset of the neurological deterioration , compared with the mri taken after the development of the neurological deficit , an increase in the size of the epidural hematoma was detected at the same level .
therefore , it is speculated that the result of such an increased hematoma may be the instability caused by the encouragement of early walking , and the increase may mediate the neurological deterioration .
uribe et al.2 reported that the incidence of delayed symptomatic seh cases after spinal surgery increased significantly in patients with a prior surgical history .
these investigators attributed this to the reduced elasticity of the scar tissues resulting in decreased blood absorption ability .
a similar effect may be applied to our patient who had a prior burst fracture on the l1 vertebra .
this report is the first to describe the delayed onset of neurological deterioration due to an seh after a spinal fracture .
an increase in the hematoma volume , where the neurological symptoms might have developed after the spinal fracture ( even after 7 days ) , was demonstrated on repeated mri performed after the exacerbation of the neurological symptoms .

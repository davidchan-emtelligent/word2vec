mesoporous silica molecular sieves are a kind of unique catalyst support due to their large pore size and high surface area .
several methods have been developed to immobilize heteropolyacids ( hpas ) inside the channels of these mesoporous silicas .
the mesoporous silica - supported hpa materials have been widely used as recyclable catalysts in heterogeneous systems .
they have shown high catalytic activities and shape selectivities in some reactions , compared to the parent hpas in homogeneous systems .
this review summarizes recent progress in the field of mesoporous silica - supported hpas applied in the heterogeneous catalysis area and preparation of nanostructured metal oxides using hpas as precursors and mesoporous silicas as hard templates .
mesoporous silica heteropoly acid polyoxometalates heterogeneous catalysis nanostructured metal oxide 1 .
introduction in the last decades , heteropolyacids ( hpas ) and related polyoxometalate compounds have attracted much attention as economically and environmentally friendly catalysts [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ] .
hpas have very strong bronsted acidity , approaching the superacid range and they are also efficient oxidants .
hpas are very soluble in polar solvents such as water , alcohols , ketones , etc .
therefore , hpas are employed in homogeneous systems as acid and oxidation catalysts and , particularly , they show higher catalytic activity than mineral acids [ 2,6,9 ] .
on the other hand , hpas are nontoxic and mildly to non - - corrosive , so they are generally recognized as clean and safe catalysts .
although homogeneous catalytic processes are efficient for a wide variety of reactions , they have some disadvantages .
the difficulty in separation of catalyst from the product has led to economical and environmental problems , which is also inconvenient in continuous production .
to solve these problems , scientists have mainly explored three different ways to prepare heterogeneous hpa catalysts .
the first preparation method is to prepare water - insoluble hpa salts by partial substitution of acidic protons with cs + , k + , nh4 + , etc .
[ 10,11 ] .
these hpa salts exhibit microporous / mesoporous structures and larger surface area than the pure acids [ 12,13 ] .
the acidic cs + salt , cs2.5h0.5pw12o40 , was demonstrated as an excellent solid catalyst for various reactions [ 12,14 ] .
the second method is to support hpas on acidic or neutral supports such as sio2 [ 15,16 ] , tio2 [ 17 ] , zro2 [ 18,19 ] , acidic ion - exchange resin [ 20 ] , or active carbon [ 21 ] .
impregnating hpas on these supports significantly increases the specific surface area , which is very important for heterogeneous catalysis processes .
the supports also influence the acidity and catalytic activity of hpas .
it has been found that the basic solids like mgo [ 3,15 ] and al2o3 [ 22 ] tend to decompose the hpas , causing a significant decrease in their catalytic activities .
silica is the most often used support since it is relatively inert towards hpas .
the third method is to introduce hpas on mesoporous silica molecular sieves .
it has long been a challenge to incorporate hpas into zeolites to carry out shape - selective catalysis as the pore size of zeolites is normally too small to accommodate large hpa molecules (> 1.2 nm ) .
since the report of the mesoporous silica molecular sieves , such as mcm - 41 [ 23,24 ] , sba - 15 [ 25,26 ] , and hms [ 27,28 ] , mesoporous materials have attracted much attention for their potential applications in the fields of catalysis , functional materials , and nanodevices [ 29,30,31 ] .
they have uniform channels , large pore size , high specific surface area and high thermal stability .
mesoporous silica molecular sieves are considered to be ideal supports for hpas compared with zeolites .
the pores are large enough for hpa molecules to enter their mesoporous channels .
loading of hpas on mesoporous silica not only allows transfer of hpa - catalysed reactions from homogeneous to heterogeneous systems to avoid the difficulty in catalyst separation , but also effectively increases the surface area of hpas [ 32 ] .
the large pore size of mesoporous silica has a high mass transfer efficiency , which benefits the reactions involving large organic molecules .
furthermore , the supported hpas can be transformed into metal oxides under controllable thermal treatment conditions. with high loading of hpas , nanowires and even three - dimensional nano - structured metal oxide ( s ) can be fabricated by reverse replication of the channels of mesoporous silica .
this is a powerful way to prepare nanostructured metal oxides with uniform morphology .
here we review the applications of mesoporous silica supported hpas in heterogeneous catalysis and the preparation of nanostructured metal oxides .
2. heterogeneous catalysis by hpas supported on mesoporous silicas 2.1 .
impregnation of hpa on mesoporous silica a mesoporous silica supported hpa may be easily obtained by the wet impregnation technique [ 32 ] .
after stirring the mixture of mesoporous silica and hpa in water / methanol , hpa molecules can be introduced in the channels through the interaction between si - oh and hpa molecules [ 33 ] .
the supported hpa materials have high surface area and large pore size .
hpa is highly dispersed without formation of crystal phases , even at quite high hpa loading .
the highly dispersed hpa exhibits high density of bronsted acid sites in the channels [ 34,35 ] .
mesoporous silica supported hpas have been demonstrated to be efficient catalysts in heterogeneous reactions , such as friedel - crafts , dehydration , aldol condensation and oxidation reactions , as well as acetalization , beckmann rearrangement and syntheses of heterocyclic compounds .
2.1.1 .
friedel - crafts and related reactions the conventional catalysts for the friedel - crafts reaction in homogeneous systems are alcl3 , h2so4 and bf3 , which cause serious environmental and operational problems , such as high toxicity , corrosion , difficulty in separation and recycling , etc .
hpas have shown their advantages over the traditional ones as eco - friendly homogeneous catalysts in early research .
recently , mesoporous silica supported hpas also have been proven to be efficient catalysts for friedel - crafts reactions in heterogeneous system .
murugesan et al .
[ 36,37,38 ] prepared a series of supported hpas by impregnation of phosphotungstic acid ( pta ) on mesoporous aluminophosphate ( alpo ) , al - mcm - 41 , and sba - 15 .
their catalytic activities in t - butylation of phenol with tert - butanol ( scheme 1 ) in the temperature range of 190 - 200 degreesc were studied .
the products obtained were o - tert - butyl phenol , p - tert - butyl phenol , and o,p - di - tert - butyl phenol or tert - butyl phenyl ether , with high selectivity towards p - tert - butyl phenol ( 78.0 - 83.7 %) .
the acidity of the catalysts can be controlled by adjusting the loading amount of hpas and is directly correlated to the density of bronsted acid sites .
the optimal catalytic activity was achieved over the catalyst with the highest bronsted acid density .

mesoporous silica supported hpas have also been applied in the synthesis of monoalkylbenzenes attached to long chain olefins .
wang et al .
[ 39 ] found that the sba - 15 supported pta catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity , selectivity and stability than hy zeolite in alkylation of 1 - dodecene with benzene at the reaction temperature of 80 degreesc ( scheme 2 ) .
the reaction involves a carbonium ion mechanism which results in the formation of five monoalkylbenzene isomers among the products .
the selectivity of 2 - phenyldodecane ( 37.3 %) was higher than those for other isomers at 89.7 % conversion of 1 - dodecene .
llanos et al .
[ 40 ] investigated the catalytic activities of pta / mcm - 41 ( si ) and pta / mcm - 41 ( si / al ) in the alkylation of toluene with 1 - dodecene .
the mcm - 41 /( si ) supported hpas have higher acid concentration than the mcm - 41 /( si / al ) supported ones due to the strong interaction between pta and the al sites of the mcm - 41 /( si / al ) supports .
the activities also depend on the acid concentration .
the selectivity of monoalkylated products reached 100 % at 28 % conversion of 1 - dodecene using 60 % pta / mcm - 41 ( si ) as the catalyst .

[ 41 ] reported the liquid phase alkylation of toluene with 1 - octene ( scheme 3 ) catalyzed by bulk and mcm - 41 - supported keggin - type hpas , such as pta , silicotungstic acid ( sta ) , and phosphomolybdic acid ( pma ) .
all supported catalysts , especially mcm - 41 supported sta and pta , exhibited higher activity than the bulk hpas .
the conversion of 1 - octene was 100 % and selectivity for monoalkylation products was 99.9 % after 2 h of reaction at 120 degreesc over sta / mcm - 41 .
the catalysts retained their catalytic activity for five runs , indicating only slight leaching of hpas in a low polarity solvent .

sugi et al .
[ 42 ] investigated the benzylation of benzene and substituted aromatics with benzyl alcohol ( bnoh ) ( scheme 4 ) using a series of hpas supported on mcm - 41 , fsm - 16 , and sba - 15 .
the conversion of bnoh and the yield of diphenylmethane decreased in the order of pta > sta > pma .
this result showed that the activities were related to the acidic strength of the hpas .
the conversion of bnoh increased with temperature and reached 100 % at 90 degreesc .
the yield of diphenylmethane reached 80 % when 50 wt % pta / mcm - 41 was used as a heterogeneous catalyst .
the turnover number ( ton ) of pta / mcm - 41 after 1 h reaction time was 4 - 6 times higher than that of unsupported pta .
the catalytic activity gradually decreased from 86 % to 75 % after five reaction cycles .

the catalytic activity of bulk pta and supported pta in the reaction of aniline with various aromatic aldehydes under liquid - phase condition was studied ( scheme 5 ) .
the activity of the supported pta was slightly lower than the bulk one , but much higher than that of zeolites .
the reusability and stability of the supported catalysts were higher in non - polar solvents than in moderately polar solvents [ 43 ] .

wang et al .
[ 44 ] reported isopropylation of naphthalene with isopropanol over sba - 15 - supported pta .
the pta / sba - 15 showed much higher conversion and selectivity to diisopropylnaphthalene , beta - isopropylnaphthalene , and beta , beta - products than that of pure acid .
the activity of 50 wt % pta / sba - 15 was comparable with the usy catalyst , much higher than bulk hpa and h - mordenite catalysts .
it was revealed that the conversion decreased drastically from 84.3 % to less than 20 % after the fourth reaction cycle due to the leaching of pta from the support caused by the polar isopropanol and water in this reaction .
2.1.2 .
dehydration reactions mcm - 41 and mcm - 41 ( si / al ) - supported sta can catalyze the dehydration of ethanol to form ethylene and diethylether ( dee ) ( scheme 6 ) .
ethylene yield showed an increasing trend with temperature , reaching to ca .
100 % above 250 degreesc and dee was formed at lower temperatures , reaching to a yield of about 70 % at 180 degreesc over sta / mcm - 41 .
in contrast , with increasing temperature the yield of dee passed through a maximum at ca .
220 degreesc and the ethylene yield reached 100 % at 220 degreesc for the sta / mcm - 41 ( si / al ) .
the difference should be attributed to the effect of lewis acid of the mcm - 41 ( si / al ) support .
at low temperature , the formation of dee and ethylene are probably taking place in parallel pathways involving bronsted and lewis acids , respectively .
at high temperature , the main product is ethylene which is formed by the decomposition of dee [ 45 ] .

mcm - 41 - supported pta displays high activity in the gas phase preparation of methyl tert - butylether ( mtbe ) ( scheme 7 ) .
the 50 wt % pta / mcm - 41 shows nearly the same activity as the commercial amberlyst - 15 catalyst .
the catalyst is stable , without any deactivation being observed after up to 100 h of reaction time [ 46 ] .

the mcm - 41 - supported pta also shows higher conversion than the parent pta for esterification of the long - chain lauric acid with butanol ( scheme 8 ) .
the catalytic activity is slightly higher than the commercial amberlyst - 15 in the first two reaction cycles but decreased significantly due to the leaching of the pta [ 47 ] .

condensation reactions supported hpas may be applied in catalytic condensation reactions .
pandurangan et al .
[ 48 ] investigated the acetalization of carbonyl compounds with pentaerythritol catalyzed by pta / mcm - 41 at reflux temperatures ( scheme 9 ) .
the activity of 15 wt % pta / mcm - 41 was comparable to that of homogeneous pta catalyst .
when loading the pta on the as - prepared mcm - 41 ( with template in the channels ) , the activity decreased significantly .
this phenomenon indicates that the reaction occurs mainly within the pores of the catalyst .

[ 49 ] synthesized a series of xanthenedione derivatives by condensation of dimedone and various aromatic aldehydes using mcm - 41 - supported pta as solid acid catalyst ( scheme 10 ) .
the yield of xanthenedione reached 94 % in ethanol at 90 degreesc .
there was a significant loss of hpa species for the first cycle , but the loss diminished for later cycles and the product yield was gradually decreased to 84 % .

[ 50 ] reported the vapor - phase beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to epsilon - caprolactam on a supported pta catalyst ( scheme 11 ). between 300 and 325 degreesc , a conversion of > 99 % with epsilon - caprolactam selectivity of 75 % was achieved on 30 wt % pta / simcm - 41 .
the conversion and selectivity were much higher than the early reported homogeneous catalysts [ 51 ] .

2.2 .
grafting of hpas on amino - functionalized mesoporous silica the wet impregnation technique is a feasible method to introduce hpas onto silica supports. through this method , hpas can be highly dispersed on the support with large surface area which improves their catalytic performances .
however , there is no strong chemical interaction between hpas and the silica support , hence , hpas tend to leach out of the supports , especially in polar reaction media , leading to deactivation of the catalysts [ 53 ] .
in order to avoid leaching , the grafting method has been adopted to immobilize hpa on the supports .
as reported by vansant and coworkers [ 54 ] , the silica surface may be modified with aminoalkoxysilanes , which provides functional amino groups on the silica surface .
hpas and the basic amine groups form the = si ( ch2 ) nnh3.hpa salt [ 55 ] , which results the strong anchoring of hpas and prevents the leaching of hpas [ 56 ] .
this type of heterogeneous catalysts ( scheme 13 ) are solvent - tolerant in the reactions involving polar reaction media , even photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water .

the conversion of n - butanol over the grafted hpa catalysts was lower than the corresponding ones prepared by impregnation method due to the low loading of hpa in the former .
however , after several reaction cycles the grafted catalysts only deactivated slightly although water was formed in the dehydration reactions [ 57,58 ] .
in contrast , for the impregnated catalysts serious leaching was observed .

[ 60,61 ] investigated the vapor - phase ethanol conversion reaction catalyzed by aptes - modified mesoporous mcf supported pma ( scheme 16 ) .
the pma / aptes / mcf catalyst showed a remarkably enhanced ethanol conversion compared to the bulk pma catalyst .
the interaction between the pma and amino groups suppressed the acid catalytic activity of pma to form ethylene and diethylether , leading to a high selectivity to the oxidation catalytic product ( acetaldehyde ) .

richards and co - worker [ 62,63 ] immobilized [ fe4 ( h2o ) 10 ( beta - xw9o33 ) 2 ] n - ( n = 6 , x = asiii , sbiii ; n = 4 , x = seiv , teiv ) on aptes - modified sba - 15 .
the catalysts showed excellent catalytic performance for solvent - free aerobic oxidation of long - chain n - hexadecane using air as the oxidant under ambient conditions ( scheme 17 ) .
the conversion of n - hexadecane was the highest over fe4se2w18 / aptes / sba - 15 ( ca. 18 %) , whereas the selectivities to c16 ketones ( ca. 50 %) and c16 alcohols ( ca .
28 %) were similar for all fe4x2w18 / aptes / sba - 15 catalysts .
the large polyanion [ cu20cl ( oh ) 24 ( h2o ) 12 ( p8w48o184 )] 25 - ( cu20 ) immobilized on the aptes / sba - 15 also showed activity in aerobic oxidation of n - hexadecane .
the heterogeneous cu20 / aptes / sba - 15 catalyst was very active , with 29.4 % conversion of n - hexadecane and 52 % selectivity to ketones , with an exceptionally high turnover - frequency of 20,000 h - 1 .

siw9co3 / aptes / mcm - 41 exhibited significantly higher activity to produce cyclohexene oxide than the monosubstituted pw11co / aptes / mcm - 41 due to more coii centers in the former available for the reaction .
the selectivity for cyclohexene oxide approached 100 % [ 64 ] .

rare earth metal sandwiched keggin - type heteropolyoxometalates , k11 [ re ( pw11o39 ) 2 ] ( repw11 , re = la , ce , pr , nd , sm , eu , dy and y ) , were anchored onto aminosilylated sba - 15 and the resulting repw11 / aptes / sba - 15 materials were applied in the oxidation of cyclohexene using h2o2 as oxidant ( scheme 19 ) .
the catalysts showed higher catalytic efficiency per polyoxometalate ( pom ) unit than the bulk pom .
the repw11 can be strongly anchored onto sba - 15 .
the leaching of repw11 species was negligible in reaction cycles [ 65,66 ] .
these results suggest that the anchoring of rare - earth metal substituted pom on the grafted silica surface is possibly due to the coordination of metal ions with amino - groups .

aptes - functionalized sba - 15 - supported h4pmo11vo40 , h5pmo10v2o40 and h6pmo9v3o40 are also efficient catalysts in the oxidation of acetaldehyde by molecular oxygen under ambient conditions .
the acetaldehyde conversion approached 71.7 % at 20 degreesc [ 67 ] .
the oxidation of norbornene , cyclooctene , cyclohexene and styrene with aqueous h2o2 has been carried out with the immobilized h4pmo11vo40 catalyst ( pmo11v / aptes / sba - 15 ) .
the selectivities of the desired products were higher than with the bulk pmo11v [ 68 ] .
halligudi et al .
[ 69 ] reported the immobilization of h3 + xpmo12 - xvxo40 ( x = 0 - 3 ) onto mesoporous silicas such as mcm - 41 , mcm - 48 , and sba - 15 , through aptes linkers .
these heterogeneous catalysts were tested in the liquid - phase oxidation of anthracene ( an ) with tert - butylhydroperoxide oxidant in benzene ( scheme 20 ) .
among the catalysts , h5pmo10v2o40 immobilized onto amine - functionalized sba - 15 gave 60 % an conversion with 100 % selectivity for anthraquinone .
the high activity of aptes / sba - 15 supported catalyst is attributed to its lower diffusion constant than that of mcm - 41 and mcm - 48 .

20 % conversion was achieved over the co - pom / aptes / sba - 15 catalysts .
in the case of alpha - pinene and isobutyraldehyde ( iba ) co - oxidation , the amino groups on the support neutralized the formation of carboxylic acid , leading to the high selectivity of alpha - pinene epoxide .

photocatalytic degradation the amino - functionalized mesoporous silica hpas may be applied in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants , such as rhodamine b , hexachlorobenzene and methylparathion .
the catalytic activities of supported hpas are better than those of the bulk ones .
the major advantage of the supported hpas over homogeneous catalysts is not their reactivity , but rather the ease of separation and recovery of the catalysts from the solutions .
only limited leaching of hpas was detected .
the catalysts may be recycled several times without significant changes in activity [ 71,72 ] .
2.3 .
entrapping of hpas in porous silica matrix via a sol - gel method hpas can be incorporated into the silica matrix through sol - gel processes .
these are a simple route to prepare silica - supported hpa materials in comparison with the grafting methods .
hpa can be immobilized into the silica matrix strongly by electrostatic or complex interactions between the silica support and the hpa .
the obtained hpa - in - sio2 materials are insoluble , highly thermal stable and readily separable .
hpa in silica matrix exhibits resistance to leaching , even after hot water extraction at 373 k. it was observed that the incorporation of the hpas molecules lead to the decrease of the pore size and surface area .
they have been proved to be efficient heterogeneous catalysts for dehydration [ 73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80 ] and oxidation reactions [ 81,82,83 ] .

the surface areas of the pta - in - sba - 15 samples were larger than the same pta - containing samples prepared by an impregnation method because the existence of considerable amount of pta in the pore walls of the pta - in - sba - 15 sample .
in the esterification reactions between alcohols and acetic acid , the conversions over the catalyst prepared by the sol - gel method was comparatively constant ( 40 %) after a sharp decrease at the first reaction cycle .
in contrast , the impregnated catalyst lost its activity rapidly due to the easy leaching of hpas in the reaction system .
castanheiro et al .
[ 79 ] immobilized pma and sta on silica through a sol - gel technique .
it was observed that the catalytic activity for esterification of fatty acid with methanol decreased in the order of pta - silica > sta - silica > pma - silica , indicating that their activities depended on the acid strength of the hpa precursors .

the catalysts were prepared by a templating method using h5pmo10v2o40 as precursor and co - acid , followed by calcination at 873 k. the p : mo : v molar ratio of 1:10:2 in the catalysts indicated that there was no significant composition change from the hpas precursor to the mixed oxide and catalysts with defined v / mo / p ratio may be obtained by choosing suitable pom precursor .

3. preparation of nanostructured metal oxides based on hpas as precursors and mesoporous silicas as hard templates due to the diversity of structure and property , transition metal oxides , such as wo3 , v2o5 , and moo3 , have wide applications in the fields of catalysis and functional materials .
[ 84,85,86 ] .
when the particle size in one or more dimensions is in the nanometer range , the oxides will show special properties .
compared with the metal nanomaterials , the crystallization of the nanostructured metal oxides is difficult .
nanocasting , using mesoporous silica as template , has brought about great possibilities in preparing nanostructured materials .
ryoo and co - workers [ 87 ] reported the first fabrication of mesoscopically ordered nanoporous ( or mesoporous ) carbon molecular sieves by carbonizing sucrose inside the pores of mesoporous silica mcm - 48 .
different from the previous nanocasting strategy using organic amines or surfactants as templates , this method uses highly ordered mesoporous silica as the hard template .
mesoporous silicas with pore sizes of 2 - 50 nm and high surface area serve as nanoscaled reactors for preparation of various nanomaterials with controllable size and shape .
besides mcm - 48 , sba - 15 [ 25 ] , sba - 16 [ 26 ] , fdu - 5 [ 88 ] or kit - 6 [ 89 ] with hexagonal or cubic pore structures can also be used as templates for duplication of nanostuctures .
the filling of precursors into the hard template channels is a key process which affects the final quality of nanostructures .
the precursor may be incorporated into the channels of mesoporous silica by various methods , such as impregnation , sorption , and grafting .
upon thermal treatment , the precursor is decomposed and crystallized inside the channels. by a simple impregnation method , au [ 90 ] , ag [ 91,92 ] , and pt [ 93 ] nanowires were prepared through thermal decomposition of precursors in mesopores of sba - 15 .
using this method and metal nitrates as precursors , tian et al .
[ 94 ] obtained a number of metal oxide nano - arrays .
however , this method has certain drawbacks , i.e. the precursors and the templates are not closely integrated , leading to relatively poor filling of mesopores and formation of imperfect nanostructured materials .
in order to improve the filling of precursor within mesoporous silica , the grafting method was applied to strengthen the interaction between precursors and templates .
the channel surface of mesoporous silica was modified by aminoalkoxysilanes , such as 3 - aminopropyltriethoxy silane ( aptes ) [ 54 ] .
the strong interaction between the amino groups and the protons may firmly anchor hpa molecules inside the channels of mesoporous silica with high loading .
the nanostructured early transition metal oxide can be obtained through decomposition of hpa under controlled thermal treatment .
according to this route , a series of nanostructured metal oxides have been successfully prepared using amino - functionalized mesoporous silica sba - 15 as hard template .
in addition , in this method transition metal salts may be used as precursors .
3.1 .
preparation of one - dimensional metal oxide nanowires based on hpas with the aptes - functionalized sba - 15 as hard template and hpas as precursors , one - dimensional ( 1d ) v2o5 , moo3 - v2o5 , and wo3 nanowires were obtained .
the 1d v2o5 [ 95 ] and moo3 - v2o5 nanowires [ 96 ] were prepared by introducing isopolyacid , decavanadoacid and keggin - type molybdovanadophosphoric acids into the channels of amino - functionalized sba - 15 , respectively , followed by thermal treatment .
the tem images of the nanowires indicate that the hpas disperse uniformly inside the sba - 15 channels ( figure 1a ) .
in the preparation of moo3 - v2o5 nanowires , it was found that the silica wall of sba - 15 was fragmented by penetration of sublimated moo3 at high temperature ( 700 degreesc ) .
these two types of nanowires cannot be kept intact during removal of the sba - 15 template by aqueous solution of naoh or hf .
1d wo3 nanowires were also synthesized with h3pw12o40 as precursor [ 97 ] .
the wo3 nanowires are stable after removal of the silica template by aqueous solution of hf ( figure 1b ). from hrtem study the prepared wo3 nanowires are single crystal and uniform in diameter .

3.2 .
preparation of three - dimensional nanoporous metal oxides based on hpas when using the amino - functionalized sba - 15 as the hard template and cr2o72 - as the precursor , where cr2o72 - can considered as the smallest polyoxoanion [ 98 ] , three - dimensional ( 3d ) cr2o3 mesoporous single crystals were obtained after thermal decomposition of cr2o72 - inside the mesoporous channels and removal of the silica template , [ 99 ] .
the structure of the products is an array of hexagonally ordered nanorods linked by nanosized bridges to form a 3d open framework ( figure 2 ) .
the products can be regarded as single crystals that are carved with a honeycomb pattern .
it is also noticeable that the diameter of the nanorods exceeds the pore diameter of sba - 15 , indicating that the nanorods would continue to grow and eventually decompose the surrounding silica framework .
it is even possible to form nonporous large single crystals when the temperature of the crystallization is too high and / or the time of the crystallization is too long .
this phenomenon implies that the space between the nanorods may be tuned by controlling the experimental conditions .
the pore size can be further enlarged during the crystallization .
the formation of the bridges between the nanorods should contribute to the micropores on the sba - 15 silica wall .
the dichromic acid is able to locate in these inter - channel micropores and became the bridges during thermal treatment .
it is obvious that the size of the inter - channel micropores on the mesoporous silica wall is too small to accommodate large size hpa molecules .
in order to prepare 3d meso - structured metal oxides based on hpas , the amino - functionalized 3d sba - 15 [ 100,101 ] with larger micropores was chosen as hard template .
h3pw12o40 was immobilized in the aptes / 3d sba - 15 followed by thermal treatment to form wo3 [ 102 ] .
after removal of the silica template , the morphology of the product is an array of hexagonally ordered nanorods linked by nanosized bridges to form a 3d open framework as an inverse replication of sba - 15 channels .
figure 3 shows typical tem images of si - free 3d mesoporous single crystals of wo3 .
the nanorods are connected by many short bridges , so that the original porous stucture of sba - 15 is maintained .

4. conclusions mesoporous silica supported hpas have attracted much attention in heterogeneous catalysis .
the selected examples demonstrate their applications as heterogeneous catalysts with high catalytic activity , which results from the high dispersion of hpas on the mesoporous silica with large pore size and high surface area .
the mesoporous silica supported hpas has a high mass transfer efficiency with better shape - selectivity than the bulk hpas , which benefits the reactions involving large organic molecules .
however , the leaching of hpa from the support in the reaction system containing polar solvents has limited their applications .
the catalysts prepared using amino - functionalized mesoporous silica as support to anchor hpa or co - synthesis method through the sol - gel technique are more solvent - tolerant than the impregnated ones .
although the hpa catalysts prepared through these two modified methods show higher catalytic performance ( specially much better recycle property ) , some limitations still exist , such as the decrease of the mass transfer efficiency in the amino - functionalized catalysts due to the reduction of pore size and the influence on synthesis and quality of mesoporous silica after adding hpas in the sol - gel process .
new progress is , therefore , expected to develop novel heterogeneous hpa catalysts with better catalytic performance .
furthermore , hpa can be used as the precursors to prepare nanostructured metal oxides using mesoporous silica as the hard template .
the functionalization of the mesoporous silica is an efficient way to improve the filling of hpas in the mesoporous channels .
the crystalline nanostructured metal oxides can well replicate the channels of the mesoporous silica hard template .

biological agents represent an important addition to the therapies for immuno - inflammatory conditions and have a great impact on the disease course and quality of life of these patients .
however , recent reports of serious infections like tuberculosis , demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases , pancytopenia , cardiovascular diseases , etc .
after anti - tnf therapy raised questions on their safety .
hence , focus is shifted towards drugs targeting cytokine checkpoints in the inflammatory cascades beyond tnf - alpha .
existing therapeutic targets include the biological agents acting as antagonists of various inflammatory cytokines ( anakinra , tocilizumab , atlizumab ) and modulators of cd80 or cd86 - cd28 co - stimulatory signal ( abatacept ) , cd2 receptors on t - cells ( alefacept ) , cd11a , subunit of leukocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( efalizumab ) , vitronectin receptor and cd20 antigen on pre - b , immature and mature b cells ( rituximab ). with the introduction of these novel molecules the future for immunomodulatory intervention in rheumatology , asthma , crohn 's disease , septic shock etc .
looks very promising .
these novel therapeutic agents could truly give a new hope to the clinician to modify the disease and achieve tangible improvements in the lives of the patients .
biological agents cytokines cd20 antigen rheumatology t - cells biologicals are proteins produced by living organisms to target specific sites of the inflammatory cascade , including antibodies against cell surface markers , cytokines and adhesion molecules. [ 1 ] the biological agents represent an important addition to the therapies for immuno - inflammatory conditions and have a great impact on the disease course and quality of life of these patients .
however , recent reports of reactivation of tb ( tuberculosis ) after anti - tnf therapy raised question on their safety .
tnf - alpha plays an important role in the host defense against mycobacterial infection , particularly in granuloma formation and inhibition of mycobacterial dissemination. [ 2 ] fda recommended a black box for tb on the product labeling of infliximab. [ 4 ] other serious infections reported with etanercept include sepsis secondary to listeria monocytogenes and histoplasma capsulatum. [ 2 ] severe disseminated opportunistic infections have been reported in the hiv positive patients. [ 2 ] sle syndrome , demyelinating diseases , neurodegenerative diseases , pancytopenia , cardiovascular diseases , new onset or flare - up of chronic iridocyclitis , thyroid cancer , hypoglossal nerve paralysis , severe cytomegalovirus pulmonary infection , reactivation of crohn 's disease etc. are the other important adverse effects reported with anti - tnf - alpha therapy. [ 45 ] however , the success of tnf blockade clearly indicates that there are various checkpoints in cytokine - mediated inflammation .
hence , the identification and development of molecules targeting such critical ' regulatory cytokines' ( beyond tnf ) may have the potential to become a novel addition in the armamentarium against various immuno - inflammatory conditions .
hence , in the present article we are reviewing some of these non - tnf - alpha biological .
search methodology : prominent rheumatology and general / internal medicine journals ( medline , embase , pubmed between 2000 and 2006 ) were searched for review papers and clinical trials published on drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines other than tnf - alpha .
all the data was collected and important evidences regarding pharmacology and uses of non - tnf - alpha biologicals were summarized in the present article .
cytokine networks and their therapeutic targets in clinical practice [ 6 - 8 ] cytokines are soluble ( glyco ) proteins , non - immunoglobulin in nature , released by living cells of the host , which act non - enzymatically in picomolar to nanomolar concentrations through specific receptors to regulate host cell function .
cytokines are pleiotropic in their biological activities and play pivotal roles in a variety of responses , including the immune response , hematopoiesis , neurogenesis , embryogenesis and oncogenesis .
the main types of cytokines are lymphokines , interleukins , monokines , tumor necrosis factors ( tnf ) , interferons , colony - stimulating factors , transforming growth factors , peptide growth factors , heat shock and other stress proteins .
cytokines have been classified on the basis of their biological responses into pro - or anti - inflammatory cytokines , depending on their effects on immunocytes [ table 1 ] .
tnf , interleukin ( il ) - 1 , il - 6 , il - 7 , il - 8 , il - 12 , il - 15 , il - 17 , il - 18 , il - 23 , lymphotoxin , macrophage migration inhibitory factor , resistin , interferon - gamma , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor , macrophage colony - stimulating factor , fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor are the proinflammatory cytokines .
whereas , il - 1ra , il - 18 binding protein , il - 10 , transforming growth factors , il - 11 , il - 13 , osteoprotegerin , adiponectin , etc are the anti - inflammatory cytokines .
il - 22 , oncostatin m etc are equivocal .
cytokines can be released not only by immune cells but also by host tissue cells .
various molecules ( anakinra , tocilizumab , atlizumab , abatacept , alefacept , efalizumab , rituximab ) targeting these cytokines are in clinical development .
table 1 cytokines and their role [ 6 - 84344 ] cytokines function il - 1 activates apc and cd4 + lymphocytes ; affects the differentiation of the b and t - cells and other immunocompetent cells , takes part in the regulation of productions of other cytokines and gmcsf .

il - 13 inhibits the proliferation of leukemic pro - b - cells il - 14 bcgf and the hyper production of this interleukin enables the progression of nhl - b. il - 15 increases the antitumor activities of t - killers and nk - cells , and the production of cytokines cd4 + lymphocytes .
il - 17 takes part in the regulation of many cytokines and can reinforce the antibody dependant tumor cell destructions .
il - 18 synergist with il - 12 , especially in the induction of ifn - gamma production and inhibition of angiogenesis .
il - 19 regulates the functions of macrophages and suppresses the activities of th1 and th2 .
il - 21 promotes a high production of t - cells , fast growth and maturation of nk - cells and b - cells population .
il - 22 similar to il - 10 , but does not prohibit the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines through monocytes .
tnfs activates macrophages , inhibits apoptosis of neutrophils and eosinophils , induces vascular endothelial cells to bind to phagocytes , induce proliferation of nk - cells and stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses .
on activation nk cells release ifn - gamma .
resistin promote tnf and il - 6 release .
adiponectin it modulates tnf - induced inflammation .
apc = antigen presenting cell , gmcsf = granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor , th2 = t helper type - 2 , th1 = t helper type - 1 , nk = natural killer , inf = interferone , il = interleukins , bcgf = b - cell growth factor , nhl - b = b - cell type non hodgkin 's lymphoma .
existing therapeutic targets include the biologicals acting as antagonists of various inflammatory cytokines and modulators of cd80 or cd86 - cd28 co - stimulatory signal , cd2 receptors on t - cells , cd11a , sub - unit of leukocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( lefa - 1 ) , vitronectin receptor and cd20 antigen on pre - b , immature and mature b cells [ table 2 ] .

anakinra :[ 9 - 11 ] it is recombinant form of nonglycosylated human il - 1 receptor antagonist expressed in escherichia coli .
natural il - 1 receptor antagonist is produced by macrophages and activated monocytes in response to various inflammatory stimuli .
anakinra competitively binds to both type - i and type - ii il - 1 receptors , at least partially blocking cellular responses mediated by il - 1 - alpha and il - 1 - beta .
it has a binding affinity similar to il - 1 , but it lacks il - 1 agonist activity .
its daily dose is 100 mg / day subcutaneously ( sc ) .
prior hypersensitivity to anakinra or e - coli derived proteins and active infection are the important contraindications with the use of anakinra .
common adverse reactions reported with it are headache , nausea , diarrhea , sinusitis , erythema , ecchymosis , pruritis at injection site , influenza like symptoms , production of anti - anakinra antibodies , neutropenia , cardiopulmonary arrest and serious infections .
live vaccines should not be administered concurrently with anakinra .
it should be used with caution in patients with neutropenia , immuno - suppression , moderate to severe renal impairment , pregnancy or breastfeeding period , and concomitant use of tnf blocking agents .
clinical trials : in a dosage ranging multi - center placebo controlled trial patients of rheumatic arthritis ( ra ) on 1 - 2 mg / kg / day of anakinra with mtx 15 - 25 mg / week achieved more acr ( american college of rheumatology preliminary criteria for improvement ) 20 response than mtx alone at 12 weeks. [ 12 ] in another study with 100 mg / day of anakinra in combination with mtx showed more efficacy in retarding radiographic progression than mtx alone. [ 13 ] in a two - year prospective , in part retrospective , cohort study drug survival was 78 % , 54 % , and 14 % after 3 , 6 and 24 months , respectively. [ 14 ] however , national institute of clinical excellence of the united kingdom recommended its use in patients who are not responding to anti - tnfalpha therapy alone or in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. [ 1215 ] in a clinical trial on 419 patients with moderate - to - severe active ra , who were receiving mtx for six consecutive months , the acr20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment ( 0.04 , 0.1 , 0.4 , 1.0 , or 2.0 mg / kg of anakinra ) plus mtx groups demonstrated a statistically significant ( p = 0.001 ) dose - response relationship compared with the acr20 response in the placebo plus mtx group. [ 16 ] in another trial 218 patients received subcutaneous injections of anakinra ( 30 , 75 , or 150 mg ) once daily. [ 17 ] the acr20 response was 51 % at week 24 and 46 % at week 48 and this effect was consistent across all dose groups .
anakinra was well - tolerated for 76 weeks. [ 17 ] role of anakinra in chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular ( cinca ) syndrome with a novel missense mutation in exon 4 of the cias1 gene ( unresponsive to several treatments including prednisolone , immunosuppressants , dmards and tnf - blocker infliximab ) has been documented. [ 18 ] anakinra , has a positive impact on both function and quality of life of the patients with ra. [ 19 ] however , further clinical studies are needed to establish the additive benefits of the combination of tnf - alpha blockade plus il - 1 receptor antagonism in ra. abatacept :[ 20 ] it is a recombinant fusion protein comprising of the extra - cellular domain of human ctla4 ( cytotoxic t - lymphocyte antigen 4 ) and a fragment of the fc domain of human igg1 , which has been modified to prevent complement fixation .
it modulates the cd80 or cd86 - cd28 co - stimulatory signal required for full t - cell activation .
it is given in a dose of 10 mg / kg by iv infusion ( three doses at the interval of two weeks , followed by infusion after every four weeks ) .
clinical trials : in a phase iib multi - center international study in ra patients with inadequate response to mtx , acr 20 response was achieved in 60 % , 41.9 % and 35.3 % patients with abatacept in a dose of 10 mg / kg , 2 mg / kg and placebo respectively after 6 months of the treatment as add on therapy to mtx. [ 12 ] in a randomized double blind phase - iii trial on patients with active ra refractory to anti - tnf - alpha therapy , abatacept therapy for 6 months , in addition to at least one dmrds ( disease modifying antirheumatic drugs ) produced acr 20 response rate of 50.4 % as compare to 19.5 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.001 ).[ 20 ] at six months , significantly more patients in the abatacept group than in the placebo group had a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function ( 47.3 percent vs 23.3 percent , p < 0.001 ) with incidence of serious infections as 2.3 % in both the groups. [ 20 ] alefacept :[ 2 ] alefacept is approved by us food and drug administration ( fda ) in january 2003 for treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis , who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy .
it is a bivalent recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extra - cellular domain lymphocyte function antigen 3 ( lfa - 3 ) , fused to the hinge ch2 domain and ch3 domain of human igg1 .
the lfa - 3 portion of alefacept binds to cd2 receptors on t - cells , thereby blocking their natural interaction with lfa - 3 .
the igg1 portion of alefacept binds to fcgammar on natural killer cells to induce t - cell apoptosis .
its dose is 10 - 15 mg im ( intramuscular ) weekly or 7.5 mg iv ( intravenous ) weekly and a 12 week course is recommended .
clinical trials : in a double - blind rct ( randomized clinical trial ) two 12 - week courses of once - weekly iv alefacept 7.5 mg and placebo were given and patients were followed for 12 weeks after each course. [ 21 ] significantly more patients achieved greater reduction in the pasi ( psoriasis area and severity index ) than placebo both after first and second course of therapy. [ 21 ] in an international , double - blind , placebo - controlled , rct , 507 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis , were randomized to receive either 10 mg or 15 mg of alefacept once weekly for 12 weeks , followed by 12 weeks of observation. [ 22 ] thirty three percent and 28 % patients achieved 75 % reduction in pasi , two weeks after the last dose in 15 mg and 10 mg group respectively. [ 22 ] the selective immuno - modulatory effect of alefacept against potentially pathogenic t - cells is associated with maintenance of immune function to fight infection and response to vaccinations. [ 23 ] it has been reported that it reduces total lymphocyte count and cd4 + and cd8 + cell counts .
hence , it is recommended to monitor cd4 counts weekly during therapy .
efalizumab :[ 23 ] it is approved by the us fda in october 2003 for the treatment of psoriasis .
it is a recombinant humanized monoclonal igg1 antibody that binds to cd11a , subunit of leukocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( lefa - 1 ) .
it interferes with the interaction between lefa - 1 and intercellular adhesion molecules ( icam - 1 ). by destabilizing the binding of apcs ( antigen presenting cells ) and t - cells , it reduces the efficiency of initial t - cell activation in lymph nodes .
it interferes with the secondary activation of memory - effector t - cells in the target tissues .
its dose is 1 mg / kg ( max 200mg ) weekly , subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks , following a first conditioning dose of 0.7 mg / kg. clinical trials : in four large phase iii studies in 2000 patients with moderate - to - severe chronic plaque psoriasis , efalizumab ( 1 mg / kg weekly ) produced pasi 75 (> 75 % in reduction in baseline pasi score ) in 27 % of patients as compared to 4 % patients in placebo group by week 12. [ 24 - 27 ] continuation of therapy beyond 12 weeks increased the response rate further in efalizumab group .
the relapse of psoriasis was evident after 2 months of discontinuation of therapy with rebound in approximately 5 % of the patients , as defined by flaring > 125 % of baseline.acute flu - like symptoms including headache , chills , fever , nausea and myalgia , an exacerbation of psoriasis after discontinuation of therapy , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , and thrombocytopenia are the common adverse events reported with its use. [ 2 ] rituximab :[ 28 - 30 ] rituximab is a specific mouse and human chimeric monoclonal antibody .
this igg1 has a long half - life of 76 to 200h and targets the cd20 antigen .
the cd 20 antigen is present on pre - b , immature and mature b cells and is important for b - cell activation and proliferation .
binding of rituximab to cd 20 results in complement and antibody - dependent cyto - toxicity ( apoptosis ) of cells exhibiting this antigen .
cd20 is not expressed on stem cells and plasma cells .
hence , depletion of the b - cell subpopulation is transient and does not affect immunoglobulin synthesis .
normal levels of total serum igg are maintained and antibody levels against hsv ( herpes simplex virus ) 1 / 2 and vzv ( varicella - zoster virus ) are not significantly affected after rituximab treatment .
rituximab was the first therapeutic antibody approved for treating cancer .
a supplemental biological license application ( sbla ) was approved for it in april 2001 , adding several new uses related to b - cell non - hodgkin 's lymphoma .
in 2006 rituximab in combination with mtx is approved for adult patients with moderately - to - severely active ra , who have had an inadequate response to one or more tnf antagonist therapies .
clinical studies : reflex , a phase iii clinical study of rituximab in ra , met its primary endpoint and underpins the fda 's approval. [ 29 ] it is also being evaluated in phase ii / iii clinical trials for primary progressive and relapsed remitting multiple sclerosis , anca - associated vasculitis , systemic lupus erythematosus. [ 29 ] in an open label study rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone in five patients of refractory ra showed dramatic and sustained clinical improvement. [ 31 ] in a phase iii multi - center double blind trial on 161 patients rituximab in combination with mtx or cyclophosphamide showed more efficacy than mtx alone. [ 31 ] rituximab is the first treatment for ra that selectively targets immune cells known as cd20 - positive b - cells .
atlizumab :[ 1232 - 35 ] it is a humanized anti - il - 6 receptor monoclonal antibody .
it is efficacious in management of ra in a dose of 2 - 8 mg \ kg \ dose iv once every two weeks .
it is a well - tolerated drug without any increase in antinuclear , anti - dna or anti - atlizumab antibody .
however , increase in blood cholesterol levels has been reported after its use for 24 weeks .
clinical trial :[ 12 ] in a phase i / ii double blind rtc , atlizumab ( 5 mg / kg with mtx single dose ) produced acr20 response in 50 % patients of ra as compare to placebo at week two .
improvement was maintained for eight weeks .
in a multi - center double blind rct , 78 % , 57 % and 11 % ra patients achieved acr20 response after three months of therapy with atlizumab 8 mg / kg , 4 mg / kg and placebo respectively .
tocilizumab :[ 3637 ] it is a recombinant humanized anti - il - 6r monoclonal antibody .
phase i and ii studies of tocilizumab in children with jia ( juvenile idiopathic arthritis ) , showed significant improvement in the typical symptoms of inflammation and laboratory abnormalities .
amg714 ( previously humax - il15 ):[ 6 ] il - 15 enhances synovial t - cell proliferation and cytokine release and optimizes cognate interactions between t cells and macrophages .
il - 15 induces synovial neutrophil activation , granule release from natural - killer cells , activation and migration of endothelial cells and prevents fibroblast apoptosis .
amg714 , a fully human igg1 monoclonal anti - il - 15 antibody , neutralizes soluble and membrane - bound il - 15 in vitro .
clinical trials : in a 12 - week , dose - ascending , placebo - controlled study , amg714 ( 0.5 - 8 mg / kg ) produced significant improvement in disease activity in ra patients as compared to placebo. [ 38 ] in another dose - finding study 60 % of recipients receiving higher doses of amg714 ( 160 mg or 240 mg ) showed significant improvement as compared to lower doses. [ 6 ] no significant alterations in the levels of circulating leukocyte subsets , including natural - killer cells and cd8 + memory t cells , were observed .
alternate approaches to targeting il - 15 include the use of soluble il - 15r - alpha - derived proteins or antagonistic il - 15 - fc fusion proteins .
crb - 15 , an il - 15 - fc fusion protein , suppressed delayed - type hypersensitivity and allograft transplant rejection in rodent models. [ 39 ] vitaxin ( medi - 522 ):[ 4 ] it is humanized monoclonal igg1 antibody that binds to a conformational epitope formed by both the integrin alpha v and beta 3 subunits .
alpha v and beta 3 integrin ( vitronectin receptor ) is expressed in low levels in most of the normal tissues ( intestinal , vascular and smooth muscle cells ) and in high levels in bone , mid - menstrual cycle endometrium , placenta , inflammatory sites and invasive tumors .
vitronectin receptors have major role in osteoclast mediated bone resorption , angiogenesis and macrophage dependent inflammation .
in ra , activated macrophages are increased in both subchondrial bone and inflamed synovial tissue ; whereas , osteoclasts are increased in subchondrial bone at the site of bone erosion and resorption .
hence , antagonists of alpha v and beta 3 integrin have a potential role in the therapeutics of ra. echistatin is another molecule under development .
anti interleukins in critical pathological conditions bronchial asthma :[ 4041 ] accumulation of eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of individuals with asthma is considered to be a central event in the pathogenesis of asthma .
mepolizumab is a humanized anti - il - 5 monoclonal antibody .
in animal models , airway eosinophil recruitment and airway hyperresponsiveness in response to allergen challenge are reduced by specific targeting of il - 5 .
however mepolizumab treatment does not appear to add significant clinical benefit in patients with asthma with persistent symptoms despite inhaled corticosteroid therapy .
in a clinically relevant model of chronic allergic asthma in mice neutralizing antibodies to il - 13 effectively suppressed eosinophil recruitment and accumulation of chronic inflammatory cells in the airways .
it also partially suppressed changes of airway wall remodeling , including goblet cell hyperplasia / metaplasia and subepithelial fibrosis , but had limited ability to inhibit airway hyperreactivity ( ahr ) .
however , treatment with anti - ifn - gamma markedly suppressed ahr .
crohn 's disease :[ 43 ] crohn 's disease is characterized by increased production of il - 12 by antigen - presenting cells in intestinal tissue and interferon - gamma and tnf - alpha by intestinal lymphocytes and macrophages .
anti - il - 12 monoclonal antibody therapy induces clinical response and remission in patients with active crohn 's disease .
in a clinical trial 79 patients with active crohn 's disease were randomized to receive seven weekly subcutaneous injections of anti - il - 12 human monoclonal antibody ( 1 mg / kg body weight or 3 mg / kg body weight ) or placebo , in an interrupted ( one - month span after first dose , n = 40 ) or continuous regimen ( n = 39 ) .
continuous weekly therapy with 3 - mg / kg anti - interleukin - 12 resulted in significantly higher response rates at seven weeks compared with placebo .
acute respiratory distress syndrome :[ 42 ] anti - il8 antibodies are high in patients of acute respiratory distress syndrome and molecules targeting them can be of potential help in these patients .
septic shock : [ 44 ] patients with septic shock have t cell hyporesponsiveness and immune suppression , which , if persistent , are associated with increased mortality .
in the murine cecal ligation and puncture ( clp ) model of sepsis , it has been reported that early treatment with the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 delays the onset of irreversible shock .
cytokine targets in preclinical development interferon ( ifn ) - gamma blockade using a polyclonal anti - ifn - gamma antibody has been shown to produce suppression of ra disease activity in a small rct. [ 45 ] suppression of il - 17 , anti - il - 18 antibody and the inhibition of il - 18 secretion via inhibition of caspase 1or antagonism of the proinflammatory purinergic receptor p2x7 are other approaches under development .
[ 646 - 49 ] several adipokines ( adeponectin ) have been shown to modulates tnf - induced inflammation. [ 5051 ] resistin is a cysteine - rich secretory protein originally implicated in insulin resistance and atherogenesis .
it is expressed at high levels in ra synovial tissues , can promote tnf and il - 6 release. [ 651 ] therapeutic targeting of resistin offers the potential to modify not only local inflammation , but also the systemic insulin resistance that is characteristic of ra and other chronic inflammatory conditions .
a number of biological agents are being studied actively at the present time and it is hoped that they may generate novel therapies for and a greater understanding of immuno - inflammatory diseases ( table 3 ) .
the future for immunomodulatory intervention in rheumatology looks very promising .
greater understanding of the intricacies of the immune response that underlie the disease should continue to yield viable , specific targets for novel therapies .
advances in biopharmaceuticals should generate treatments that maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity .
these novel therapeutic agents could give new hopes to the clinician truly to modify the disease and achieve tangible improvements in the lives of the patients .

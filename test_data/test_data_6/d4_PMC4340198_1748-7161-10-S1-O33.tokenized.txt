the need for corrective surgeries for degenerative lumbar scoliosis has been increasing these days and some of those cases are pre - existing type scoliosis .
however , it is said to be difficult to differentiate pre - existing type scoliosis from de novo type scoliosis .
the purpose of this study is to analyze the relevant x ray metrics of degenerative lumbar scoliosis and to discover differences between pre - existing and de novo type scoliosis .
methods of 54 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as candidates for corrective surgery for left convex thoracolumbar / lumbar scoliosis since december 2008 , 19 patients over age 50 were included in this study .
the average age was 60 years old ( 50 - 80 years old ) .
all patients were female .
coronal and sagittal parameters were contrasted between two groups divided according to the existence of scoliosis in their adolescence ; clear ( ais ) and unclear ( de novo ) .
results eleven were ais , and 8 were de novo .
the average age was 54.0 years old for ais and 67.4 for de novo ( p < 0.05 , fig. 1 ) .
cobb angles ( 69degrees , 49degrees ) and l4 tilt ( 30degrees , 22degrees ) were found to be significantly greater in ais ( fig. 2 ) .
nash - moe rotation assessment showed that rotational deformity was greater in ais type than in de novo type .
lumbar lordosis ( 28degrees , 32degrees ) , thoracolumbar kyphosis ( 24degrees , 12degrees ) , sagittal vertical axis ( 37mm , 58mm ) , and pelvic incidence ( 51degrees , 60degrees ) showed no significant difference between the groups , however , pelvic tilt ( 24degrees , 33degrees ) showed significant difference ( fig. 3 ) .
figure 1 age distribution of both group the average age was significantly higher for de novo than for ais .
figure 2 cobb angle cobb angle was found to be significantly greater in ais .
figure 3 pelvic tilt pelvic tilt showed significantly larger in de novo .
conclusion among patients over 50 with degenerative thoracolumbar / lumbar scoliosis , those with pre - existing type scoliosis were found to have greater cobb angle , greater l4 tilt , greater rotational deformity , less pelvic tilt , and were candidates for surgery at a younger age than those with de novo type scoliosis .
in other words , those with de novo type scoliosis have less coronal deformity and worse sagittal pelvic alignment than those with pre - existing type scoliosis and are not considered candidates for surgery until a more advanced age .
this study demonstrates some differences between pre - existing and de novo type scoliosis , contrasts the natural history of the two types of candidates for thoracolumbar / lumbar scoliosis surgery , and suggests the importance of performing surgery for lenke 5c type adolescent idiopathic scoliosis at a younger age .

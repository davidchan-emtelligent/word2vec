the conspicuousness of animal signals is influenced by their contrast against the background .
as such , signal conspicuousness will tend to vary in nature because habitats are composed of a mosaic of backgrounds .
variation in attractiveness could result in variation in conspecific mate choice and risk of predation , which , in turn , may create opportunities for balancing selection to maintain distinct polymorphisms .
we quantified male coloration , the absorbance spectrum of visual pigments and the photic environment of poecilia parae , a fish species with five distinct male color morphs : a drab ( i.e. , grey ) , a striped , and three colorful ( i.e. , blue , red and yellow ) morphs .
then , using physiological models , we assessed how male color patterns can be perceived in their natural visual habitats by conspecific females and a common cichlid predator , aequidens tetramerus .
our estimates of chromatic and luminance contrasts suggest that the three most colorful morphs were consistently the most conspicuous across all habitats .
however , variation in the visual background resulted in variation in which morph was the most conspicuous to females at each locality .
likewise , the most colorful morphs were the most conspicuous morphs to cichlid predators .
if females are able to discriminate between conspicuous prospective mates and those preferred males are also more vulnerable to predation , variable visual habitats could influence the direction and strength of natural and sexual selection , thereby allowing for the persistence of color polymorphisms in natural environments .

introduction the expression of exaggerated male traits , such as colorful ornaments or elaborate songs , often evolves under conflicting selective pressures [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
females may favor males with highly elaborate traits , but predators and other natural enemies may likewise prefer to target these attractive males [ 4 ] .
under such scenarios , the tradeoff in attractiveness to females and susceptibility to predators can favor the evolution of reduced conspicuousness [ 2 ] or alternative ways of communicating only detectable to conspecifics [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
the perception of elaborate signals depends on the physical properties of the habitat ( e.g. , ambient light and background , transmission spectrum of the medium ) and the sensory parameters of the receivers assessing the signals [ 7 ] .
therefore , variation in any of these two components of the signaling environment may influence the trade - off between attractiveness and susceptibility to predation , and favor the evolution of alternative signal design ( e.g. , color , song frequency ) that correspond to the variable environment [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
several studies offer support for this hypothesis by showing that variation in the photic environment ( manakins [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , african cichlids [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , bluefin killifish [ 15 ] , anoles lizards [ 16 ] , pentamorphic sulawesi fish [ 17 ]) and visual physiology ( african cichlids [ 18 ] , sticklebacks : [ 19 ] , bluefin killifish [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , guppy [ 22 ] , passerine and avian predators [ 23 ] , crab spider [ 24 ]) can favor the transmission of specific signals that can be used by conspecifics and / or predators , and therefore promote the evolution and maintenance of color polymorphisms ( see also [ 25 ]) .
although there is an established association between the photic environment and sensory physiology ( e.g. , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ]) , only few studies have examined the simultaneous effects of these two factors on the outcome of female choice and male competition ([ 17 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] ; see also [ 9 ]) .
these studies suggest that variable sexual selection is an important selective force that can lead to the maintenance of male color polymorphisms .
however , studies in which sexual selection may act in conjunction with natural selection via predation to maintain multiple color phenotypes are scarce ( but see [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ]) .
here , we explore whether variable visual backgrounds and sensory physiology can directly affect the discrimination of distinct color phenotypes , as perceived by conspecific females and visual predators , and therefore maintain multiple color morphs in a single species .
males of the poeciliid fish poecilia parae exhibit five discrete y - linked color morphs ( figure 1 ) [ 34 ] .
these morphs include : ( i ) immaculata , the smallest and drab - colored males that resemble juvenile females , ( ii ) parae , the largest males that exhibit a striped tail and black vertical body bars that intensify during social interactions , and the ( iii ) blue , ( iv ) red , and ( v ) yellow males with colorful body flanks and intermediate body size [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
drab immaculata males use a sneaker strategy to gain copulations with females [ 37 ] .
the other four male color morphs , in contrast , perform sigmoid courtship displays to advertise their color patterns to attract females for mating .
during these sigmoid displays , males position their bodies to the front and sides of the receptive females with their dorsal and caudal fins fully extended [ 35 ] .
although the exposure of colorful sexual signals through elaborate courtships serves to attract females , such displays may also attract the attention of potential predators and thus may be costly in terms of increasing individual risk of mortality .

reflectance curves are from the means of 5 females and 5 males of each color morph .
field and laboratory studies suggest that the male color polymorphism in p. parae is stable across time [ 34 ] and may be maintained by a complex balance between the opposing effects of sexual and natural selection [ 36 ] .
laboratory experiments that controlled for male - male competition and standardized the photic environment ( i.e. , sun - glo linear fluorescent bulbs , hagen , ma ; ~ 25 microe s - 1 m - 2 mimicking natural , clear day light spectrum ) revealed repeatable and variable female mating preferences for the colorful red , yellow and blue morphs. that is , most test females strongly preferred either red or yellow males but a few showed consistent preferences for blue males [ 36 ] .
likewise , aequidens tetramerus , a common visual cichlid predator of p. parae , exhibited a visual bias for red and yellow males , suggesting that selective predation may offset the mating advantages of red and yellow males thus keeping them relatively rare in natural populations [ 36 ] .
the large parae morph excludes sexual competitors through agonistic behaviors that are directed preferentially towards red , yellow and blue males , and rarely at drab immaculata males [ 38 ] .
exclusion of competitors resulted in increased mating success for parae males , indicating that these males use aggression as an alternative tactic to enhance their mating success .
in contrast , the drab immaculata morph , is least preferred by females but can circumvent both female mate choice and male - male competition by mimicking juvenile females to deceive competitors and sneak copulations [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
finally , blue males are able to gain mating opportunities by winning some aggressive interactions and by attracting some females [ 36 ] , [ 38 ] .
however , these small advantages may not fully explain the persistence of blue males at higher frequencies than red and yellow males in natural populations ( see figure 2 in [ 36 ]) .
here , we test whether the heterogeneity of the visual environment impacts the conspicuousness of color signals by altering the perception of male color morphs by conspecifics and predators .
variation in perceived conspicuousness , in turn , may lead to variation in female choice and risk of predation .
as such , we predict that observed variation in the visual background will result in variation in which color patches would be most conspicuous to females and cichlid predators .
such countervailing selection can promote the maintenance of striking and multiple male color morphs in natural populations .

materials and methods ethics statement the research was conducted under the syracuse university institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) protocol number 06 - 014 .
permit for field studies and collection of live individuals was issued by the environmental protection agency , republic of guyana ( ref. 111207 br 086 ) .
the present study only included the use of poecilia parae , one of the most common poeciliids inhabiting freshwater coastal areas and did not involve any endangered or protected species .
study sites study populations were located on the east ( 6degrees 47.2 ' n , 58degrees 09 ' w ) and west ( 6degrees 41 ' n , 58degrees 12 ' w ) sides of the demerara river , republic of guyana ( see [ 36 ] for characterization of sampling sites ) .
we used the terms " east " and " west " populations to refer to two geographic locations where p. parae is found .
although both populations are contiguous , the east and west populations are separated by the demerara river ( ca .
1851 m wide ) , the third largest river in the republic of guyana that likely reduces gene flow between individuals of p. parae inhabiting the east and west populations .
in january 2006 , we established 15 permanent sampling sites ( i.e. , segments of the stream or drainages ) at each population .
sampling sites were ca .
100 - 150 m apart from each other. from january to august 2006 , we recorded the relative abundance of the five p. parae male color morphs , and that of their common predator , aequidens tetramerus at 15 sites in the east and 15 sites in the west study populations .
in january 2010 , with the exception of individuals used for reflectance measurements ( see below ) , males and females of p. parae were collected from the sampling sites and were transported to our laboratory at syracuse university .
fish were maintained in 20 gal aquaria with treated water at 27 +/ - 1degreesc , on a 12:12 h light : dark cycle , and fed daily with live brine shrimp and tetra - min ( melle , germany ) flakes two times per day until used for microspectrophotometry analysis .
reflectance measurements from our 2010 field collection and immediately after capture , individuals of p. parae were sorted by sex and morph type , and housed in separate aquaria .
spectral reflectance of five randomly drawn females and five males of each morph were measured within 4 h of capture , allowing fish to acclimate and recover from stress due to handling / capture .
each specimen was individually anesthetized in an ice bath (~ 2 - 3degreesc ) .
the anaesthetized fish was then placed on its right flank on ice separated by a wet cloth , and its color patches on the flanks were measured using a portable spectrophotometer .
we focused on color patches that are conspicuous , used during courtships and preferred by females ( e.g. , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ]) .
we excluded the measurements of color patches on the caudal and dorsal fins from our analyses because of the difficulties in gathering repeatable spectrometry readings of these small and translucent patches .
the reflectance of color patches was illuminated by a pulsed xenon flash source ( ocean optics px - 2 ; as in [ 10 ]) and measured with an ocean optics usb2000 spectrometer ( ocean optics inc. , dunedin , fl , usa ) at a 45degrees angle to reduce specular glare .
reflectance scans were taken across 300 - 700 nm spectral range with the probe housed in a hollow , black anodized aluminum sheath with a 45degrees angled tip that contacted the fish 's skin .
the anodized sheath insured that the xenon flash was the only light source illuminating the color patch , that the distance between the probe and the color patch was constant at 0.5 cm , and that the angle of measure and size of the opening were constant at 45degrees and 1 mm diameter circle , respectively .
to allow for comparison across scans , each reflectance scan was standardized with a spectrally flat 97 % reflecting spectralon white standard ( labsphere ; north sutton , nh , usa ) and a dark standard .
microspectrophotometry to characterize the spectral sensitivity of p. parae cones , seven adult males ( immaculata : n = 2 , parae : n = 2 , blue : n = 2 and yellow : n = 1 morphs ) and 10 adult females were used for microspectrophotometry ( msp ) analyses at cornell university , ithaca , new york .
methods for msp readings are described in detail in [ 39 ] .
in brief , fish were housed in complete darkness for 24 hours .
then , individual fish was euthanized and the eyes enucleated under dim red light ( safelight ndegrees 2 , 15 w bulb , kodak ( c ) , usa ) .
all samples were prepared under infrared illumination (> 800 nm , safelight ndegrees 11 , kodak ( c ) , usa ) using image converters .
the eyes were hemisected and the retinae removed while in buffer solution ( cold phosphate buffer solution ph 7.4 supplemented with 6 % sucrose ) .
retinae were then separated from the retinal pigment epithelium and macerated using razor blade fragments and tungsten needles [ 39 ] .
a small sample of the retina was transferred to a cover slip and placed under a second cover slip edged with silicone grease .
the 1.5 microm2 rectangular measuring aperture was produced by demagnification using a leitz ( oberkochen , germany ) 180x quartz mirror objective .
a zeiss 100x ultrafluar ( 0.85 na ) collected the transmitted light and focused it onto the photomultiplier photocathode .
retinal cells were selected individually .
determination of double cones was based on intact pairs of examined cells only .
msp scans were collected at 1 nm intervals scanning from 750 to 350 nm , and back from 350 to 750 nm [ 39 ] .
comparisons of both scans are commonly used to control for over - filtering and bleaching .
the msp settings and functioning used in this study is provided in detail in [ 40 ] .
we used template fitting to determine the lambdamax ( the wavelength at maximum absorbance for a template - derived visual pigment best fitting the experimental data as defined by [ 20 ] and [ 39 ]) .
the process of determination of lambdamax involved the following steps : ( i ) smooth the data , ( ii ) determine the peak absorbance ( x max ) , ( iii ) normalize the absorbance curve , ( iv ) fit the templates , ( v ) calculate the standard deviation of lambdamax , and ( vi ) compare with the actual data and choose the best fit [ 39 ] .
then , pre - selected spectra were smoothed prior to normalization with the digital filter routine using smooft [ 41 ] .
for instance , a smoothed spectrum was overlaid on the raw data and visually compared for over - filtering or for spurious data points that had shifted the apparent maximum .
if shifts were perceived , then the unsmoothed data were used .
the peak absorbance ( x max ) used in the normalization represented the calculated maximum of the best fit gaussian to the data points 20 nm either side of the estimated - by - eye absorbance maximum of the alpha band .
using x max , the data were then normalized using standard methods [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
finally , normalized data were best - fitted using the a1 templates [ 44 ] .
since msp wavelength error is +/ - 1 nm , all visual pigments are reported to the nearest integer .
absorbance spectra from 30 - 40 % of cells measured were retained for analysis since the information from other cells was of insufficient quality for template fitting .
hence we inspected more cells than the sample sizes we report in this study .
characterizing the photic environment : ambient light and visual background we collected irradiance ( i.e. , ambient light ) and radiance ( i.e. , background ) scans at all sampling sites ( east : n = 15 sites and west : n = 15 sites ) , where p. parae was common and all male color morphs present .
measurements were taken early in the morning ( 600 - 800 h ) when male and female p. parae are most socially active [ 35 ] .
we used a submersible planar irradiance collector ( hydro - optics , biology , and instrumentation laboratories , wa , usa ) attached to an ocean optics usb2000 spectrometer ( ocean optics inc. , dunedin , fl , usa ) to collect ambient light .
at each site , irradiance was collected horizontally ( i.e. , downwelling ) at a depth of 20 cm because p. parae inhabits shallow waters and most social and foraging activities occur within this depth [ 35 ] .
background radiance was measured by modifying the submersible irradiance probe with a black opaque cap of 40 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter to reduce the field of view ( i.e. , < 5degrees ) so that only light from a small solid angle can reach the detector surface .
radiance scans were taken every 15degrees angle until completing a semicircle , starting at an approximate location where an individual of p. parae was observed or likely to interact with females .
the aim of these radiance scans was to measure the average visual background against which an individual would be perceived by a conspecific or predator .
to allow for direct comparison among scans , the spectrophotometer fitted with the irradiance and radiance probes was calibrated with a standard light source ( licor 1800 - 02 ; see [ 45 ]) .
to characterize the spectral distribution of the ambient light and background for each sampling site in the east and west populations we calculated the spectral index lambdap50 , the wavelength that halves the total number of photons between 300 - 700 nm [ 46 ] .
the lambdap50 specifies a single value per habitat sampled in which the majority of photons are likely to be most concentrated .
a high lambdap50 index suggests that the spectrum is more shifted to longer wavelengths .
the lambdap50 index has been more recently used to determine the predominant spectral components characterizing different underwater photic regimes to examine fish visual signaling ( e.g. , [ 17 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 47 ]) .
we used one - way anovas to test for differences in the estimated lambdap50 indices for the ambient light and visual backgrounds between sample sites at the east ( n = 15 ) and west populations ( n = 15 ) .
modeling the visual system of poecilia parae to quantify the chromatic deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrasts of male color morphs as viewed through the eyes of p. parae conspecifics , we used the ( i ) reflectance spectra of a color patch ( figure 1 ) , ( ii ) radiance spectra of the visual background , ( iii ) irradiance spectra of the ambient light illuminating the color patch , and ( iv ) spectral sensitivity of p. parae .
our msp data indicated that p. parae has seven types of cone photoreceptors located within single and double cones ( see results section ) .
because it remains unclear if all seven of these cones are used in color or luminance discrimination , and if the double cones interact , we first modeled the visual system of p. parae as pentachromatic , assuming that double cones are neurally linked and able to operate as a single receptor channel ( e.g. , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ]) .
for this purpose , we considered the following combinations of photoreceptors : ( i ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 533 , ( ii ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 543 , ( iii ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 553 ; iv ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 533 - 543 , ( v ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 533 - 553 .
we then modeled a hexachromatic eye by including all photoreceptor types and assuming that individual members of double cones are used in color vision as independent spectral channels ( e.g. , [ 49 ]) .
possible hexachromatic eyes would be composed of the following photoreceptors combinations ( i ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 533 - 543 ; and , ( ii ) 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 533 - 553 .
the choice of these two modeling approaches is based on our current knowledge of the differential expression of the sws1 , sws2b , sws2a , rh2 and lws opsin subfamilies ( often expressed in double cones ) in cyprinodontiformes , which suggests either a penta - or hexachromatic vision for these fishes ( e.g. , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ]) .
as required by the vorobyev - osorio model , we also included ( i ) the relative frequencies of the cone classes and ( ii ) estimation of the weber fraction for lws cones in p. parae .
the estimation of visual cone class densities were derived from published data on guppy retina based on the relative encounter rates of different cone classes inspected during retina preparations [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
in the absence of behavioral data on the visual thresholds of p. parae , the weber fraction of the lws cone was set at 0.05 .
this value was chosen as a conservative measure of visual performance , assuming that subjects can reliably detect a 5 % change in stimulus intensity between objects or color patches ( see other fish vision studies using a 5 % weber fraction : [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] , [ 58 ]) .
all these data were processed using extended versions of receptor noise - limited color vision models for p. parae as developed by morehouse et al .
[ 33 ] and based on the vorobyev - osorio model [ 59 ] .
details of the extended models used to analyze penta - and hexachromatic visual systems are provided in appendix b of the electronic version of morehouse et al .
[ 33 ] .
we evaluated the results of chromatic ( deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrasts of male color phenotypes as estimated by penta - and hexachromatic eye models using one - way anovas .
the pentachromatic model should represent a visual system with a limited subset of msw / lws photoreceptors compared to a hexachromatic model .
thus , we ask whether the exclusion of a msw / lws visual photoreceptor ( i.e. , turn a hexachromatic model to a pentachromatic model ) will result in differences in color and luminance discrimination .
we did not find any significant differences in color ( all p > 0.92 ) and luminance ( all p > 0.91 ) discrimination between pentachromatic and hexachromatic eye models .
for simplicity , we therefore use the deltas and l estimations based on hexachromatic eye for exploring the role of variable visual habitats in mediating variation in perceived conspicuousness of male signals ( see below ) .
to test for perceived differences in conspicuousness of male color morphs within - and between populations by conspecifics , we used the 355 - 407 - 456 - 526 - 533 - 543 hexachromatic eye .
we compared the color ( deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrast of the five morphs and females using nested anovas .
the independent variables included : population ( east and west ; n = 2 ) , sites ( sampling sites within - populations ; n = 30 or 15 per population ) and ' morphs' ( male color morphs and female of p. parae ; n = 6 ) .
the dependent variables were the color ( deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrasts estimated for each male color morph .
' population ' and ' morph ' were considered as fixed factors given that we sampled two populations in guyana , and that all male color morphs were present at all sampling sites .
' sampling sites' were nested within ' population ' and considered as a random factor .
we used fisher 's lsd pairwise tests to test for posthoc differences in the perceived conspicuousness or luminance of p. parae color morphs by conspecifics .
predator visual modeling cichlid fishes are common visual predators of colorful poeciliids and so oppose positive sexual selection ( e.g. , [ 2 ] , [ 60 ]) .
current evidence suggests that cichlids have trichromatic color vision and are capable of detecting short - wavelength light [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 61 ] .
hence , we specifically asked 1 ) whether the most conspicuous color morphs to p. parae are also conspicuous to a common predator , the cichlid aequidens tetramerus , and 2 ) whether predators may play a role in mediating selection .
using the vorobyev - osorio trichromatic visual model [ 62 ] , we quantified the color ( deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrasts of male color morphs against natural backgrounds as viewed through the eyes of a cichlild predator .
because we do not have data on the spectral sensitivity of the cichlid a. tetramerus cones , we used published data from a. pulcher , a closely related , voracious predator of adult guppies in trinidadian streams [ 31 ] .
we used the following parameters for a. pulcher cone spectral sensitivity : sws = 453 nm ; mws = 530 nm ; lws = 570 nm ( as determined by [ 63 ]) .
the absorbance functions of a. pulcher were calculated using the govardovskii 's pigment absorbance template equations [ 64 ] .
for this purpose , we considered that the a. pulcher visual proteins are primarily composed of vitamin a2 ( porphyropsin ; [ 65 ]) .
the relative densities of photoreceptors used to estimate the perceptual threshold of the cichlid predator come from data collected for the south american cichlid , amphilophus longimanus , a species that also inhabits clear freshwater streams [ 8 ] , [ 66 ] .
all the calculated perceived differences in conspicuousness of male color morphs within - and between populations by a. tetramerus were analyzed with nested anovas , as detailed above .
predicting morph frequencies as an indirect assessment of the effects of variable mate choice and predator susceptibility on the frequency of male color morphs , we constructed a backward , stepwise multiple regression model for each of the five morphs using morph frequencies as the dependent variable and the estimates of male conspicuous to conspecifics and predators as possible predictors .
morph frequency was estimated by dividing the total number of males counted for each morph by the total number of all males counted at each sampling site .
as predictor variables , we used the color ( deltas ) and luminance ( l ) contrast values of the particular male color morph at the sampling sites' visual environments perceived by conspecifics or predators , as well as the relative abundance of predators .
morph frequency and predator abundance data were arcsine square root and log transformed , respectively .
for each of the models , we inspected the variance inflation factors ( vif ) , which indicated little evidence of collinearity .
all variables included in the model did not deviate significantly from normality ( all p > 0.46 ) .
results microspectrophotometry the absorbance spectra of all the cone classes and individual rod cells from poecilia parae [ immaculata ( n = 2 ) , parae ( n = 2 ) , blue ( n = 2 ) , and yellow ( n = 1 ) morphs , as well as 10 adult females ] fit well with vitamin a1 pigment templates .
our msp study revealed the presence of seven spectrally distinct types of cone photoreceptor arranged either as single or double cones .
most notably , the retina of poecilia parae contains single cones with uv absorption at 355 +/ - 1.4 nm (" uvs " ; n = 11 individuals ) and a violet / blue at 407 +/ - 1.6 nm (" sws " ; n = 17 individuals ) .
values for lambdamax of double cones ranged from 456 to 553 nm : 456 +/ - 1 nm ( n = 17 individuals ) , 526 +/ - 0.8 nm ( n = 17 individuals ) , 533 +/ - 2 nm ( n = 11 individuals ) , 543 +/ - 1 nm ( n = 17 individuals ) , and 553 +/ - 1.9 nm ( n = 5 individuals ) .
the different types of double and twin cones were commonly found as 456 / 526 nm , 456 / 533 nm , 456 / 543 nm , 526 / 533 nm , 533 / 533 , 543 / 543 , and 553 / 553 .
rod cells were also observed and had an estimated lambdamax 503 +/ - 1.2 nm ( mean +/ - sd , n = 17 individuals ) .
example msp absorbance curves for these photoreceptor types are provided in figure 2 and figure s1 .
characterizing the photic environment : ambient light and visual background unstandardized irradiance and radiance spectra of p. parae visual habitats are shown in figure 3 .
the lambdap50 of the ambient light in the east ( mean +/ - s.e. : 568 +/ - 3.64 nm ) and west ( 576 +/ - 3.64 nm ) populations were not statistically different ( anova : f 1,28 = 2.78 , p = 0.11 ) .
however , the lambdap50 of the visual background ( radiance ) significantly differed between the east ( 545 +/ - 2.68 nm ) and west ( 562 +/ - 4.45 nm ) populations ( anova : f 1,28 = 9.81 , p < 0.001 ) , indicating more yellow shifted light in the west compared to the east population .
the intensity of ambient light ( east : 0.42 +/ - 0.05 , n = 15 sites and west : 0.72 +/ - 0.14 , n = 15 sites ) and visual background ( east : 0.18 +/ - 0.03 , n = 15 sites and west : 0.28 +/ - 0.05 , n = 15 sites ) was consistently lower in the east population ( figure 3 ) , which is consistent with the presence of more open habitats in the west compared to the east population .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0101497.g003 figure 3 mean ( a ) irradiance and ( b ) radiance spectra characterizing the sampling habitats in the east ( solid line ) and west ( dotted line ) populations where p. parae and their predators are found .
modeling the visual system of poecilia parae when viewed through p. parae visual system , our models suggest significant differences in the perceived chromatic ( f5,145 = 16.75 , p < 0.001 ; figure 4a ) and luminance ( f5,145 = 41.62 , p < 0.001 ; figure 4b ) contrasts among the five male color morphs .
these results were consistent between the pentachromatic and hexachromatic visual models .
specifically , on the average , blue and red males had the greatest color and luminance contrast values against their visual background , followed by yellow , parae and immaculata males ( figure 4a , b ) .
comparison of color contrast within ( f28,145 = 28.18 , p < 0.00 ; figure 5 ) populations ( i.e. , among sites ) and between the east and west ( f1,145 = 87.29 , p < 0.001 ) populations indicate significant variation in the conspicuousness of each male morph at each site , suggesting a strong effect of the ambient light and / or visual background .
for instance , in the east population , blue males were more conspicuous than red males in localities 4 , 7 , 11 , 12 and 13 , while red males were more conspicuous than blue males in localities 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 14 ( figure 5a ) .

predator visual modeling modeling a freshwater cichlid predator with a trichromatic color vision capable of detecting short - wavelength light during prey search , our results suggest that the male color morphs most preferred by p. parae females are also more conspicuous to cichlid predator , as estimated by perceived color ( f5,145 = 35.92 , p < 0.001 ; figure 6a ) and luminance ( f5,145 = 700.59 , p < 0.001 ; figure 6b ) contrasts .
as in the modeling of p. parae perception , we found that the variable habitats also resulted in variation in the perception of males by cichlid predators within ( f28,145 = 3.99 , p < 0.001 ) and between ( f1,145 = 18.44 , p < 0.001 ) the east and west populations .

considering the perception of immaculata and parae males , and females by a cichlid predator , they appear less conspicuous compared to other male color morphs against all natural visual habitats in terms of color contrast ( figure 6a ) and luminance contrast ( figure 6b ) .
however , our models suggest that the male color morphs of p. parae present lower color contrast but higher luminance contrast values to the visual predator ( figure 6a , b ) .

predicting morph frequencies the factors that predicted morph frequency varied among color morphs ( table 1 ) .
for blue males , their chromatic conspicuousness ( deltas ) to conspecifics emerged as the only significant predictor of the frequency of blue males ( table 1 ). that is , blue males were found in higher frequencies in areas where their color contrast is relatively high , explaining 21 % of the variation in blue male frequency across sites .
for red and yellow males , the relative abundance of predators emerged as a significant predictor of their frequencies across sampling sites ( table 1 ) .
finally , the frequencies of the parae and immaculata morphs were predicted by their conspicuousness to cichlid predators ( table 1 ) .

discussion our results indicate that the perceived conspicuousness of the five p. parae male color morphs , as estimated by their color and luminance contrasts against the natural visual background and visual parameters of conspecifics , varied across sampling sites within populations .
such variation was primarily driven by the spectral properties of the variable visual background .
in some localities , for instance , blue males were more conspicuous to conspecifics than the carotenoid - based red and yellow males ( table 1 , figure 5 ) , which are the most attractive males under controlled laboratory conditions with full - spectrum light and a brown background [ 34 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 67 ] .
if female mate choice is influenced by male conspicuousness , as shown in several fish species ( e.g. , [ 17 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 69 ]) , variation in color and luminance conspicuousness of the different male morphs mediated by variable visual habitats may result in variable female mate choice .
variation in female mate choice , in turn , should allow for the persistence of distinct male color polymorphisms within populations ( e.g. , [ 9 ] , [ 70 ] , [ 71 ]) .
consistent with this hypothesis , we found that the perceived color contrast of blue males by conspecifics positively predicted their relative abundance across sampling sites within populations ( table 1 ) .
variation in sensory physiology our results suggest the presence of seven cone types in p. parae , representing the uv , sws , mws and lws cone classes .
we are confident that we have identified all the opsins expressed in recordable amounts in p. parae retinae .
the msp data further suggests that some individuals may be expressing at least one different lws as a double cone with peak absorption at 526 / 533 nm or as a twin cone with lambdamax of 553 / 553 nm but never both .
at this point , we have no conclusive evidence suggesting that the lws photopigments are either polymorphic or sex - linked ( as in guppies [ 22 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 54 ] , [ 72 ] , [ 73 ] , [ 74 ]) , despite the extreme male color polymorphism .
our sample size is low and more in depth sampling across populations may perhaps reveal a sex - linked pattern of polymorphism .
at the molecular level , there is evidence indicating that p. parae expresses two lws opsins ( i.e. p180 and s180 ) found also in guppies and other poeciliids [ 75 ] .
in guppies , for instance , the p180 lws is expressed at a lambdamax of 512 nm , whereas the s180 lws may have a lambdamax of 560 nm. from these two opsins only the latter appears to differ among populations [ 76 ] .
at this stage , a combination of msp , opsin gene sequences and spectral analysis of recombinant pigments among populations may help identifying cone complements and offer a better understanding of how visual sensitivities can influence the maintenance of color polymorphism in p. parae .
interaction between natural and sexual selection allows for the maintenance of 5 color morphs courtship traits are expected to evolve under conflicting selective forces .
sexual selection should favor the evolution of conspicuous traits , whereas natural selection via predation should agonistically work to decrease trait conspicuousness [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] .
in fact , several studies indicate that females and predators share a sensory bias for conspicuous signals ( e.g. , [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 77 ]) .
under such constraints , males should evolve less elaborate signals .
alternatively , signals can evolve ways to be more conspicuous to conspecifics than predators .
for instance , at specific visual backgrounds , colorful plumage in songbirds can remain conspicuous to conspecifics while remaining inconspicuous to predators [ 23 ] .
likewise , ultraviolet signaling in northern swordtails ( xiphophorus spp ) appear to work as a ' private channel ' of communication between conspecifics , as predators do not see well in the uv spectrum [ 6 ] .
indeed , there is evidence that a voracious guppy cichlid predator ( i.e. , the trinidadian pike : chrenicicla frenata ) lacks sws1 opsin ; therefore , this species may be relatively insensitive to the uv visual spectrum [ 61 ] .
thus , the existence and the role of a " private channel " in poecilia parae remains an interesting open question to be resolved .
in p. parae , laboratory experiments of predator preferences show consistent bias for the carotenoid - based red and yellow males , which are also attractive to females ( e.g. , [ 36 ]) .
our visual models confirm that indeed the red and yellow , as well as blue , color patches are more conspicuous to a piscivorous fish than the duller immaculata morph and females in their natural environment .
these differences , however , depend on whether cichlid predators use either their color or luminance contrasts in detecting prey .
the color contrast values indicates , for instance , that under some visual backgrounds a male color morph that is most conspicuous to conspecifics may be the least conspicuous to the predator .
however , using luminance contrast , our results suggests that the colorful morphs appear very conspicuous to predators and thus may be preferentially targeted as prey .
this hypothesis is supported by our results indicating that the relative abundances of yellow and red males are negatively predicted by their perceived luminance contrast to predators .
these differences in perceived conspicuousness appear to translate into differences in risk of predation mediated by variation in the background against which a particular male color morph is viewed .
however , p. parae color patches were always more conspicuous to conspecifics and apparently less to predators , which may suggest that males reduce the costs of bearing colorful traits by displaying in visual conditions more conspicuous to conspecifics but less conspicuous to predators ( as in [ 31 ]) .
combining our current results with our previous work [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , we can propose a more complete scenario of the mechanisms that interact to favor the persistence of the five distinct male color morphs in p. parae .
first , both red and yellow males ( i.e. , carotenoid - based patches ) are strongly preferred by females as potential mates under standardized laboratory conditions .
red and yellow males , however , are also preferentially targeted by visual predators under the same visual conditions [ 36 ] .
indeed , the results of the multiple regression models ( table 1 ) suggest that red and yellow morph frequencies are limited by the relative abundance of predators across different habitats .
this tradeoff between natural and sexual selection could explain why red and yellow males are consistently rare throughout the years ( e.g. , [ 2 ]) , and may provide opportunities for alternative mating strategies to invade .
second , drab immaculata males that resemble juvenile females are least attractive to females ( e.g. , [ 67 ]) , and so they use a sneak copulation strategy to circumvent both female mate choice and male - male competition ( e.g. , [ 37 ]) .
in further support of this hypothesis , we found that immaculata males are similar to females in perceived color contrast , which likely enhances their ability to sneak copulations and avoid male - male aggression .
the sneaker strategy of immaculata males is also enhanced by a relatively larger investment in testes , making them perhaps more competitive in sperm competition [ 37 ] .
third , the parae morph gain mating through elaborate courtships , and more significantly , by preventing other males from gaining access to females and / or modifying female choice after successful aggressive interactions with competitors [ 38 ]. that is , parae males specialize in agonistic interactions to enhance their mating success .
finally , our results in this study suggest that blue males , in certain visual conditions , are more conspicuous than all other morphs , including the highly - preferred red morph ( figure 5 ) , and that perceived conspicuousness to conspecifics positively predicts blue male frequency ( table 1 ) .
these results suggest that conspicuousness may influence female mate choice ( as in [ 68 ]) and thus the reproductive success of blue males ( as in [ 17 ]) .
variable visual conditions may therefore allow blue males to invade and persist in the population .
these advantages , however , may be offset by predation , as blue males are also more conspicuous to predators , perhaps explaining why the three colorful males are found in lower abundances compared to the drab immaculata and less colorful parae morphs [ 36 ] .
for instance , pike cichlid targets male guppies exhibiting large / numerous blue / iridescent spots as prey [ 2 ] , and it has been currently established that pike cichlids are capable of detecting short - wavelength light [ 61 ] .
all together , our results here and from previous work suggest that a complex interaction between natural and sexual selection allows for the remarkable persistence of five p. parae color morphs in nature .
conclusions recent studies provide support for the role of the visual background in generating and / or maintaining color polymorphisms by altering the direction of natural and sexual selection .
in the guppy poecilia reticulate the visual background varies with the lighting environment in natural streams , affecting the spatial and temporal operation of sexual selection .
this , in turn , generates opportunities for the maintenance of quantitative variation in male coloration [ 68 ] .
likewise , in the pentamorphic sulawesi fish telmatherina sarasinorum , yellow and blue males are highly abundant in habitats that enhance their contrast from the visual background , which presumably augments their reproductive fitness [ 17 ] .
in our study in p. parae , conspecifics perceive red males as the most conspicuous color morph , followed by blue then yellow males .
however , variation in the visual habitat results in the blue morph being more conspicuous than red and yellow males , which in turn , predicts their relative abundances across sampling sites .
sexual selection favoring the most conspicuous males can therefore favor different color morphs under variable lighting conditions. that is , variation in the visual environment could lead to changes in the strength and direction of sexual selection .
our study therefore suggests an important role for environmental heterogeneity in favoring the maintenance of striking color polymorphisms .

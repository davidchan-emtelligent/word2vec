background the lack of an antidote against factor xa inhibitors in case of major bleeding or need for urgent surgery is a concern to clinicians .
guidelines on managing major bleeding in patients under anticoagulation with a factor xa inhibitor suggest several hemostatic agents to reverse the effect , but there is no consensus regarding the choice of drug or appropriate dose .
the ability of prothrombin complex concentrate , activated prothrombin complex concentrate , and recombinant factor viia to reverse the effect of factor xa inhibitors has been evaluated in animal studies , in vitro studies , and healthy volunteers , but not yet in randomized clinical studies .
case presentation we report a consecutive case series of patients under factor xa inhibitor ( apixaban ) treatment who received activated prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the anticoagulation effect before emergency cardiovascular surgery .
patient 1 , a 63 - year - old white man , was operated with replacement of the aortic valve ; patient 2 , a 65 - year - old white man , underwent heart transplantation ; patient 3 , a 68 - year - old white man , was operated for acute type a aortic dissection .
they all received activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 iu / kg immediately before surgery .
in two of the cases , the global coagulation assay thromboelastometry ( rotem ( tm )) was performed before and after administering activated prothrombin complex concentrate .
the rotem ( tm ) clotting time was reduced from 1900 seconds to 740 seconds and from 1482 to 807 seconds , respectively , after administering a dose of 25 iu / kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate .
the apixaban concentration before reversal was within the range considered to be the therapeutic level in all cases .
no bleeding complications occurred during surgery , but one case was complicated with bleeding postoperatively .
no thromboembolic complications were observed during or after surgery .
conclusions activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 iu / kg reversed the anticoagulation effect of apixaban effectively and safely before emergency cardiovascular surgery .
keywords fxa inhibitors apixaban emergency surgery reversal activated prothrombin complex concentrate issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background factor xa ( fxa ) inhibitors are direct oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) and safe and effective alternatives to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and treating venous thrombosis [ 1 ] .
apixaban ( eliquis ( c ) ; bristol - myers squibb / pfizer eeig , uxbridge , united kingdom ) is an oral , direct - acting fxa inhibitor with a half - life of approximately 12 hours .
the treatment is less complicated than warfarin treatment , as it consists of a fixed dose which does not require monitoring [ 2 ] .
because of the convenience and proven efficacy , the prescription rate of doacs is increasing worldwide [ 3 ] .
consequently , the number of patients who are anticoagulated with doacs and need emergency surgery for coexisting conditions increases accordingly .
however , reversal of the effect of fxa inhibitors is still a matter of debate .
the antidote andexanet alfa has shown promising results in clinical studies , but it is still not commercially available [ 4 ] .
furthermore , this antidote is not a good option for reversing the fxa inhibitor effect before cardiovascular surgery , as it is unspecific and reverses all fx inhibitors , including heparinization , that are required during cardiopulmonary bypass .
guidelines providing a strategy to manage bleeding complications or emergency surgery in fxa inhibitor - treated patients are not conclusive and suggest 4 - factor prothrombin complex concentrate ( 4 - pcc ) or activated prothrombin complex concentrate ( apcc ) as reversal agents [ 5 ] .
4 - pcc contains factor ii , vii , ix , and x in their inactive zymogen forms and is used to reverse the anticoagulation effect of warfarin .
apcc is used to treat hemophiliacs with inhibitor and contains activated fvii in addition to factor ii , ix , and x. the documentation of the ability of these reversal agents to reverse the anticoagulation of fxa inhibitors is limited , and apart from one cohort study evaluating the effect of 4 - pcc as reversal agent in apixaban - treated patients undergoing major bleeding [ 6 ] , only animal studies , in vitro studies , and case reports exist [ 7 - 12 ] .
in the following case series we present three patients in whom apcc was used to reverse the anticoagulation effect of apixaban before emergency cardiovascular surgery .
the reversal effect was assessed both clinically by the surgeon and by coagulation tests .
case presentation case 1 a 63 - year - old white man under treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily due to atrial fibrillation was hospitalized after rapidly developing symptoms of heart failure .
four weeks earlier he had had a re - implantation of a biological aortic valve because of infectious deposits on the mechanical valve and was still under antibiotic treatment at the time of admission .
he had no previous history of bleeding disorders .
he had taken his morning dose of apixaban and presented with respiratory distress , fever , and hypotension .
his blood samples showed a hemoglobin level of 97 g / l , leukocyte count of 10.3 x 109 / l , thrombocyte count of 157 x 109 / l , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) of 45 ml / minute , and c - reactive protein concentration of 337 mg / l. he had normal liver function tests .
both prothrombin time ( pt ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) were prolonged ( table 1 ) .
an echocardiography revealed an extreme aorta stenosis and a left ventricle dysfunction .
his condition deteriorated rapidly , and surgery to replace the aortic valve was needed immediately .
there was no time to await the wash - out effect of apixaban .
due to recent apixaban tablet intake and need for major surgery with potentially large blood loss , apcc ( feiba ( c )) 3000 iu ( 25 iu / kg ) was administered over a 10 - minute period prior to surgery to reverse the anticoagulation effect of apixaban .
afterwards , cardiopulmonary bypass was established with full heparinization , which was monitored with aptt .
before and after the apcc treatment , but before starting the heparin infusion , blood samples were collected in citrated test tubes prefilled with corn trypsin inhibitor ( cti ) and in test tubes containing only citrate .
the apixaban concentration was measured by anti - fxa activity ( afxa ) assay , and coagulation status was assessed by thromboelastometry ( rotem ( r ) ; tem innovations , munich , germany ) using minimal tissue factor activation [ 13 , 14 ] , pt , and aptt before and after apcc treatment .
rotem ( tm ) clotting time ( ct ) was shortened from 1900 to 740 seconds , and clot formation time ( cft ) was shortened from 353 to 191 seconds .
pt and aptt were reduced from 62 to 20 and 58 to 48 , respectively .
surgery was performed successfully without excessive bleeding or thromboembolic complications .
hence , administering apcc improved hemostasis , which was assessed clinically by the surgeon and measured by global coagulation tests ( fig. 1a , b ) ( table 1 ) .

he had no other comorbidities and had no previous history of bleeding disorders .
on the day a heart from a deceased donor was available , he had taken his morning dose of apixaban .
heart transplantation surgery was coordinated the same evening .
his blood test results at the time of admission showed normal blood counts , creatinine level of 156 mumol / l , estimated gfr 40 ml / minute , pt 26 seconds and aptt 33 seconds .
the apixaban concentration was 152 mug / l. because of the recent tablet intake and the great bleeding risk during and after the procedure , it was decided to administer apcc 3000 iu immediately before surgery .
his body weight was 108 kg , which means that the dose administered was 28 iu / kg. the surgery was uncomplicated , and so was the postoperative period .
no bleeding complications or thromboembolic events were seen .
ct was reduced by more than 50 % ( from 1482 seconds to 807 seconds ) , and cft was reduced accordingly ( fig. 1a , b ) .
pt and aptt were also reduced after apcc treatment ( table 1 ) .
case 3 a 68 - year - old white man taking apixaban 5 mg twice daily because of atrial fibrillation was hospitalized with acute chest pain .
he had no other comorbidities and no prior bleeding disorders in the past .
a quickly performed computed tomography scan showed a type a aortic dissection , and acute surgery was required .
he had taken the last dose of apixaban the same morning , 8 hours earlier .
he had normal kidney function at the time of admission .
for the same reasons as in the previous cases , it was decided to administer apcc 3000 iu ( 29 iu / kg ) prior to surgery .
the surgery went well without excessive bleeding , but after 4 hours postoperative pericardial bleeding occurred , causing tamponade .
he was re - operated twice the same night because of bleeding , and he received massive transfusion with erythrocytes , thrombocytes , plasma , and , later , prothrombin complex concentrate , fibrinogen , apcc , and recombinant activated fvii. by the next morning , approximately 8 hours later , he stopped bleeding and was stabilized .
unfortunately , the blood samples were contaminated with heparin , so there are no rotem ( tm ) results in this case .
the apixaban concentration was 98 mug / l , but this value was not known at the time of surgery and did not influence the treatment before or after surgery .
postoperatively , no thromboembolic complications were observed , but he died of septic shock after 6 weeks in the intensive care unit .
discussion the optimal method to reverse the effect of fxa inhibitors in cases of emergency surgery or major bleeding is not known .
in this case series , we report on the cases of three patients anticoagulated with apixaban who required emergency cardiovascular surgery. by administering apcc prior to surgery , the anticoagulation effect was reversed successfully , according to measurements of global coagulation assays and clinical assessment .
the therapeutic level of apixaban is not yet established , but afxa in patients anticoagulated with apixaban 5 mg twice daily have peak values of 91 to 321 mug / l and trough values of 41 to 230 mug / l [ 2 ] .
in the cases reported here , the afxa level calibrated for apixaban was between 68 and 152 mug / l at the time of admission , which confirms that the patients were fully anticoagulated .
cardiovascular surgery has a high risk of bleeding complications and involves cardiopulmonary bypass treatment , including full heparinization .
for this reason it was decided to reverse the anticoagulation effect of apixaban .
in the acute setting , apcc 3000 iu ( 25 - 30 iu / kg ) was administered over 10 minutes immediately before initiating heparinization and cardiopulmonary bypass treatment to perform major cardiovascular surgery .
this dose was chosen to minimize the risk of thromboembolic complications .
in vitro studies have shown that apcc at the suggested dose might overcorrect the hemostatic parameters [ 7 , 9 ] , and patients treated with apixaban already have a risk of thromboembolic complications .
another study has shown that 25 iu / kg reverses the hemostatic parameters altered by apixaban quickly and sufficiently [ 10 ] .
a single case report also supports the use of this dose [ 15 ] .
in addition to a clinical assessment of hemostasis , the reversal effect of apcc was measured by thromboelastometry , which provides information about time until clot formation and the viscoelastic properties of the clot .
previous studies performed with the same method have shown that the healthy , not anticoagulated control group obtained an average ct of 705 seconds (+/ - 210 seconds ) [ 9 ] .
this means that the reported cases of patients obtained a ct corresponding to normal value after receiving apcc .
afxa activity was , not surprisingly , unaltered after apcc treatment , as the activated clotting factors improve the hemostasis by bypassing the fxa inhibition of apixaban but do not directly influence the apixaban concentration .
the fact that the conventional coagulation tests pt and aptt are not valuable indicators of the doac effect [ 16 ] was confirmed in this case series .
in cases 2 and 3 the values of aptt were within the normal range before reversal of the apixaban effect , but in case 1 , aptt was higher than expected when taking the apixaban concentration in consideration .
we do not know the reason for this , but one possible explanation may be that there was a situation with disseminated intravascular coagulation , as the patient had an infection at time of admission .
in patient 1 , the concentration of apixaban was surprisingly high 24 hours after last intake , which may be explained by the impaired kidney function .
the main limitation of this case series is that only a few cases are described .
the risk of selection bias , however , is reduced by consecutively including patients .
the lack of a control group is another limitation ; however , the patients served as their own controls because laboratory tests were performed before and after treatment .
in two of three patients , the reversal was successful , and this may also have been the case in the third patient .
the postoperative bleeding could have been caused by an arterial bleeding , and reversing the anticoagulation effect would not have prevented this .
the case report only described the use of one of the suggested treatment options , and randomized studies are needed to provide us with the optimal treatment in cases of major bleeding or the need for emergency cardiovascular surgery in fxa inhibitor - treated patients .
conclusions this case series describes the use of apcc in a setting where reversal of the anticoagulation effect of apixaban was needed before acute cardiovascular surgery .
our report demonstrates that hemostasis markedly improved , as assessed clinically and by coagulation tests after administering apcc 25 - 29 iu / kg. none of these surgeries was complicated by excessive bleeding during surgery .
however , one of the cases was complicated by postoperative bleeding .
the safety of the treatment was demonstrated , as in none of the cases did thromboembolic complications occur ( table 2 ) .

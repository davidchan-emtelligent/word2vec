ecthyma gangrenosum ( eg ) involves necrotic cutaneous lesions caused by bacteria , mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa , and is usually seen in immunocompromised patients with septicemia .
however , clinically similar infections have been published with fungi as etiologic agents .
we present a case of an eg - like lesion due to fusarium oxysporum confirmed by clinical diagnosis , culture and molecular identification and discuss the definition of eg. keywords fusarium oxysporum ecthyma gangrenosum definition immunocompetent ministry of health ( oman ) 28 / 2014 al - hatmi abdullah m. s. issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media dordrecht 2016 introduction ecthyma gangrenosum ( eg ) is generally defined as an infection with multiple necrotic cutaneous ulcers caused by species of pseudomonas , mainly p. aeruginosa , or aeromonas .
the disorder is usually seen in immunocompromised patients , particularly those with underlying malignant disease .
occurrence in immunocompetent individuals is highly exceptional [ 1 ] .
since 1980s , data have accumulated on a wider bacterial spectrum of gram - negative agents like escherichia coli,citrobacter freundii , klebsiella pneumonia , morganella morganii and various pseudomonas species [ 2 , 3 ] .
also some fungi have been reported to cause clinically similar lesions , e.g. , species of candida , aspergillus , and curvularia [ 4 ] .
thus , the disease definition for some authors is determined by the etiologic agent and for others by clinical features .
nevertheless , the name is infrequently applied to fungal infections .
this confusion may mask a wider prevalence of eg - like infections , which otherwise may have been reported under a wide spectrum of fungal diseases .
we present a fungal case of an eg - like infection in an immunocompetent patient caused by fusarium oxysporum and discuss the definition of eg. case presentation a 17 - year - old male from southwestern china with epilepsy presented with a painless ulcer on his right leg which was clinically suspected as being dry gangrene .
the lesion started 2 months earlier when he was injured during an epileptic insult by a wooden bench .
initial lesions were in the form of small , painless papules which quickly progressed to a painless ulcer with a black eschar over a period of 2 weeks .
all laboratory investigations were within normal ranges , and in particular , no immune deficiency was apparent .
however , the patient had a history of epilepsy for which he was on carbamazepine for 7 years .
examination of the skin lesion showed a 5 x 13 cm skin ulcer with black eschar , i.e. , the ulcer edge appeared to " roll over " and took the shape of a tough , erythematous and fibrous ring .
the black eschar adhered tightly without discharge of pus or granules ( a1 , a2 ) .
upon first visit , the case was diagnosed as eg ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 a1 initial infection ; a2 after 2 weeks of treatment ; b1 , b2 koh mount of the swab collected from the lesion showing fungal hyaline hyphae ( magnification , x40 ) ; c1 , c2 fungal hyphae seen with h & e stain from the biopsy ; d1 growth of white colonies and purple pigmentation on mea at 25 degreesc. ; d2 - d4 septate macroconidia and microconidia .
all scale bars 10 mum identification of the fungal etiological agent a skin biopsy was taken from the lesion and direct examination ( koh 10 %) showed multiple thin hyaline hyphae ( b1 , b2 ) .
histopathological examination showed irregular , hyaline hyphae in the h & e - stained tissue ( c1 , c2 ) .
culture on sabouraud 's glucose agar ( sga ) showed white colonies with a light brown pigment excreted into the medium .
phenotypic identification of this isolate resulted in a fusarium species .
since fungal hyphae were visible in histopathological slides , the medical judgment of the case was changed from eg to an eg - like fungal infection .
subsequently , voriconazole ( 400 mg / day orally ) was added to the therapeutic plan at day 14 after admission .
two weeks after the start of antifungal treatment , the patient received surgical debridement and continued on oral voriconazole for another 2 weeks with noticeable improvement .
the patient did not return for follow - up visits .
the isolate was preserved and deposited in the cbs - knaw reference collection with accession number cbs 140424 .
subculturing of the isolate for a more thorough morphological study was performed on malt extract agar ( mea ) and oatmeal agar ( oa ) with incubation times of 1 week at 25 , 33 and 37 degreesc .
rapidly growing , hairy , pink - violet colonies were observed after incubation on mea after 5 days at 28 degreesc .
microscopic morphology showed short , single , lateral monophialides ( flask - shaped projections ) in the aerial mycelium .
macroconidia were fusiform , slightly curved , 1 - 3 septate , 21.4 - 38.5 microm in length and 3.2 - 4.5 microm in width .
microconidia were abundant , not arranged in chains , 0 - 1 septate , 6.4 - 14.3 microm in length and 2.8 - 4.3 microm in width ( d1 - d4 ) .
optimal growth was observed at 27 degreesc ; maximum growth temperature was 37 degreesc .
on the basis of culture and microscopy , the fungus was provisionally identified as f. oxysporum .
genomic dna was extracted from a culture grown on mea following a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide protocol as described previously [ 5 ] .
the rdna internal transcribed spacer region ( its ) was analyzed as routine marker using primers its1 and its4 .
since its is not a recommended locus for reliable identification of fusarium species , the partial translation elongation factor 1 - alpha ( tef1 ) and the partial rna polymerase second largest subunit ( rpb2 ) were also analyzed .
pcr amplification and sequencing of the partial fragments were , respectively , done for tef1 with primers ef1 and ef2r and for rpb2 with primers rpb2 - 7cr and rpb2 - 5f2 [ 5 ] .
to perform identification , a similarity search with the sequences of each gene was done using the blast tool of the ncbi database , the fusarium - id database and the fusarium mlst database .
these blast searches yielded 100 % similarity scores with several submissions under the name f. oxysporum .
the its , tef1 and rpb2 nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank with accession numbers kt794176 , kt794174 and kt794173 , respectively .
antifungal susceptibility testing antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to clsi m38a ( clinical and laboratory standards institute 2008 ) method , slightly modified by al - hatmi et al .
[ 6 ] and demonstrated that the fungus had a low minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mics ) of 1 microg / ml against amphotericin b and high mics above published epidemiological cut off values ( ecvs ) [ 7 ] , for itraconazole (> 16 microg / ml ) , voriconazole ( 8 microg / ml ) , posaconazole (> 16 microg / ml ) , isavuconazole ( 8 microg / ml ) , anidulafungin (> 16 microg / ml ) , micafungin (> 16 microg / ml ) , and fluconazole (> 64 microg / ml ) .
discussion at present eg is generally defined as a condition pathognomonic for pseudomonas aeruginosa or related bacteria in immunocompromised patients .
in the current literature , a much wider definition is often maintained , including variable etiology and variable host factors , also including immunocompetent .
in our view , the gangrenous clinical appearance is the unique feature of the infection and should determine the definition , as follows : ( 1 ) pathogens , which may be bacteria but also fungi , yeasts or mycobacteria are isolated from blood cultures and skin biopsies [ 8 ] , ( 2 ) the host is immunocompromised .
( 3 ) clinically , the lesions demonstrate hemorrhagic pustules that lead to necrotic ulcers which evolve into gangrenes with black scab and in a later stage become surrounded by a red halo .
( 4 ) histopathology shows a necrotic epidermis and papillary dermal edema ; venules are congested and red blood cell extravasation is noted in the papillary dermis ; secondary thrombosis of the arterioles , tissue edema and separation of the epidermis leads to the specific picture of eg. consequently , our case was interpreted as eg - like , with presence of fungal hyphae , but a difference was noted in the fact that our patient was an immunocompetent individual .
although fungal agents are mostly reported from immunocompromised patients with eg , an immunocompromised status was judged not necessary [ 8 ] .
this makes the clinical appearance of local gangrene even less specific .
while originally pseudomonas bacteria were part of the definition , now also other agents including fungi such as the general opportunist genus fusarium can be involved , and the immune status of the host also appears variable .
for all these reasons , it seems to us that a definition of eg by medical aspects of clinical features , and histopathology is most appropriate .
reported fungal opportunists of eg - like and eg infections are aspergillus fumigatus , candida albicans , c. tropicalis , curvularia sp. , exserohilum sp. , fusarium solani , metarhizium anisopliae , mucor pusillus , scedosporium boydii and neoscytalidium dimidiatum [ 4 ] .
to this list , f. oxysporum can be added .
histopathology showed that local invasion with fungal elements was present in epidermis and dermis .
an extensive literature search revealed six cases since 1975 in neutropenic patients due to f. solani or other fusarium species that were listed as eg [ 9 - 14 ] .
our patient , without known immune deficiency , had a history of trauma during which the fungus could have been implanted in the skin .
the eschar was tightly attached to the ulcer , suggesting that fungal eg might be different from bacterial eg , which would favor reference to fungal infections as " eg - like. " though , more cases have to be studied to confirm this clinical difference .
in most eg and eg - like cases , the clinical picture is specific ; differential diagnosis should consider warfarin - induced skin necrosis , cocaine - induced skin necrosis , calciphylaxis , septic emboli , loxoscelism , diabetic microangiopathy , disseminated intravascular coagulation , paraneoplastic extensive necrotizing vasculitis , pyoderma gangrenosum , livedoid vasculopathy , antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - associated vasculitis , cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis due to familial mediterranean fever , and necrosis secondary to the use of vasoactive drugs [ 15 , 16 ] .
treatment of our patient was only for 2 weeks with voriconazole , but the beginning of a curative effect was seen during this short period .
the loftiness around the lesion became flatter and the surface of the eschar became dry .
eg is an ominous sign in immunocompromised patients , especially with p. aeruginosa .
however , dermatologists should be aware that other pathogens such as fungi can cause clinically indistinguishable lesions .
in most cases , the cutaneous appearance constitutes an important physical clue to the clinical diagnosis as an eg or eg - like lesion , that is black scab and surrounded by a red halo .
given the fact that the etiologic agent can be of bacterial and of fungal nature , it is essential that the pathogen is identified .

heparanase is an endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate , the main polysaccharide constituent of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and basement membrane .
expression of the heparanase gene is associated with the invasion and metastatic potential of a variety of tumor - derived cell types .
however , the roles of heparanase in the regulation of gene expression and the subsequent cell function changes other than invasion are not clear .
in the current study , we overexpressed the human heparanase gene in a human u251n glioma cell line .
we found that heparanase - overexpression significantly increased cell invasion , proliferation , anchorage - independent colony formation and chemotactic migration towards fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) - supplied medium and stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( sdf - 1 ) .
these phenotypic appearances were accompanied by enhanced protein kinase b ( akt ) phosphorylation .
focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) and extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 ( erk1 ) signaling were not altered by heparanase - overexpression .
these results indicate that heparanase has pleiotropic effects on tumor cells .
introduction tumor cell invasion and metastatic spread depend on the ability of cancer cells to invade tissue barriers by degrading extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and basement membrane structures [ 1,2 ] .
the primary components of the basement membrane and ecm are structural proteins , such as collagen iv , laminin , fibronectin , and heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( hspgs ) .
heparan sulfate ( hs ) is a glycosaminoglycon ( gag ) chain present in hspgs [ 3 ] .
hs chains interact through specific attachment sites with the main protein components of basement membrane and ecm .
heparanase is a mammalian endo - beta - d - glucuronidase responsible for hs degradation [ 4 - 7 ] .
heparanase activity may therefore play an important role in fundamental biological processes associated with ecm remodeling and cell invasion [ 8,9 ] .
increased expression of heparanase mrna and protein has been reported in a variety of metastatic cell lines and human tumor tissues , whereas adjacent normal - looking tissue does not exhibit detectable levels of heparanase [ 10 - 15 ] .
moreover , increased heparanase mrna expression correlates with reduced postoperative survival of cancer patients [ 12,15,16 ] .
overexpression of heparanase cdna in tumor cells with low metastatic potential confers a high metastatic potential after injection of these cells into the experimental animals [ 4 ] .
heparanase has also been shown to elicit an angiogenic response by releasing heparan sulfate - bound angiogenic factors sequestered in the ecm , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) [ 17,18 ] .
recently , it was reported that heparanase is translocated into the cell nucleus where it may degrade the nuclear heparan sulfate and thereby affect nuclear functions ( i.e. regulation of gene expression and signal transduction ) that are thought to be regulated by heparan sulfate [ 19 ] .
thus , the function of heparanase seems not to be only limited to degrading extracellular matrix .
cellular function may be affected by heparanase through regulating gene expression .
there are accumulating evidences that certain signal transduction cascades are altered under heparanase stimulation [ 20 - 22 ] .
however , genes and cellular functions involved in heparanase regulation , other than cell invasion , is still unclear .
in the present study , we demonstrate that heparanase overexpression in stably transfected human u251n glioma cells results in a marked increase of cell chemotactic migration toward fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) - supplied medium and stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( sdf - 1 ) .
cell proliferation and anchorage - independent growth are also increased in heparanase - overexpressing cells .
these phenotypic changes are combined with elevated protein kinase b ( akt ) phosphorylation .

results heparanase increases u251n cell invasion to understand the role of heparanase on the regulation of cell function , the full length human heparanase gene was stably transfected into u251n cells .
western blot analysis using cell lysates from heparanase - overexpressing u251n - hpa cells showed a great increase of protein expression of both latent ( 65 kda ) and active ( 50 kda ) forms of heparanase .
heparanase expression was confirmed by analyzing u87 and hf2303 cells ( figure 1a ) .
u251n - hpa cells exhibited a 100 fold increase of mrna expression ( figure 1b ) and a 12 - fold increase of heparanase activity in cell lysates compared to u251n - pc cells ( figure 1c ) .
heparanase cleaves hs residues , participates in ecm degradation , and thereby may facilitate tumor cell invasion [ 4 ] .
using the bd matrigel invasion assay , we evaluated the invasion ability of u251n cells .
matrigel , a reconstituted basement membrane containing hspg , was used as a relevant barrier .
as expected , the heparanase - overexpressing u251n - hpa cells exhibited a 10 - fold increase in cell invasion as compared to control u251n - pc cells , and the increased cell invasion was significantly blocked by the heparanase inhibitor heparin at a concentration of 40 mug / ml ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2a ) .
in order to distinguish the role of heparanase on cell invasion , mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 , members of the mmp family that is also involved in glioma invasion [ 24 ] , was measured using zymography assay and real - time pcr in both heparanase - overexpressing and control cells .
no significant changes were observed in both enzyme activity and mrna expression levels between u251n - pc and u251n - hpa cells ( figure 2b and 2c ) .
figure 1 overexpression of heparanase in u251n cells .
( a ) heparanase expression of u251n , u87 and primary cultured glioma cells ( hf2303 ) were detected by western blot .
both u251n and u87 exhibited baseline level of heparanase expression .
latent form of heparanase was detected in hf2303 cells .
increased heparanase expression , both the latent ( 65 kda ) and active ( 50 kda ) forms , was observed in cell lysate derived from u251n - hpa cells , as compared to u251n - pc control cells .
( b ) u251n - hpa cells expressed about 100 times more mrna than u251n - pc cells .
( c ) increased heparanase activity was detected in u251n - hpa cells .
figure 2 heparanase overexpression increases cell invasion .
( a ) cell invasion of u251n - hpa was significantly increased as compared to u251n - pc cells , measured by bd invasion assay .
increased cell invasion was greatly inhibited by 40 mug / ml heparin .
** , p < 0.01 , compared with u251n - pc cells .
# , p < 0.01 , compared with u251n - hpa group of no heparin treatment .
( b ) mrna levels of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 showed no significant difference between u251n - pc and u251n - hpa cells .
( c ) no significant differences were detected in mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 activity between u251n - hpa cells and u251n - pc cells as measured by zymography assay .
heparanase enhances u251n cell chemotactic migration apart from the traditional function of heparanase on cell invasion , cell migration towards chemoattractants was detected .
our results showed that migration of u251n - hpa cells was significantly increased towards dmem medium supplied with 5 % and 10 % fbs as compared to u251n - pc cells ( p < 0.01 ) , while cell migration was significantly blocked by 40 mug / ml heparin ( figure 3a ) ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results indicate that increased migration is heparanase - induced cellular function change which is independent of ecm degradation .
since sdf - 1 and its receptor cxcr4 ( cxc chemokine receptor ) system was reported to be correlated with cancer cell migration [ 25 - 27 ] , sdf - 1 was also tested as a chemoattractant .
more cells were migrated when sdf - 1 was added into the 10 % fbs medium than 10 % fbs medium alone ( p < 0.01 ) , and total number of migrating cells of u251n - hpa group was significantly higher than that of u251n - pc group ( p < 0.01 ) .
the number of migrating cells was not increased when sdf - 1 was added into 0 % fbs medium ( figure 3b ) , indicating that sdf - 1 induced migration needs the activation of other cellular signals .
figure 3 overexpression of heparanase increases u251n cell chemotactic migration .
( a ) heparanase - overexressing u251n - hpa cells showed increased migration towards fbs dose - dependent manner ( 5 % and 10 % fbs ) , and increased migration was significantly blocked by 40 mug / ml heparin .

( b ) sdf - 1 significantly increased cell chomatactic migration in the presence of 10 % fbs medium .
increased migration was not observed when sdf - 1 was added in serum free medium .
** , p < 0.01 , compared with the same treatment of u251n - pc cells .
# , p < 0.01 , compared with 10 % fbs group of each cell line .
heparanase overexpression increases u251n cell growth to test the possibility of heparanase on cell growth , cell proliferation and anchorage - independent growth was therefore evaluated .
growth curve was measured during 4 days in culture .
initially 4 x 103 cells were plated in each well of a 96 - well plate , and cell numbers were determined daily by mtt assay .
four days after seeding , the cell number of the u251 - hpa group was significantly higher than that of the u251n - pc group ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 4a ) .
furthermore , the anchorage - independent cell growth was determined by colony formation in soft agar .
u251n - hpa cells formed significantly higher numbers of colonies in soft agar and the colonies were generally bigger than those of control u251n - pc cells ( figure 4b ) .
figure 4 overexpression of heparanase enhances u251n cell growth .
( a ) u251n - hpa showed increased cell proliferation as measured by mtt assay .
four days after cell seeding , the numbers of u251n - hpa cells were significantly increased as compared to u251n - pc cells .
** , p < 0.01 , compared with u251n - pc cells .
( b ) u251n - hpa cells developed more and bigger colonies than u251n - pc cells as measured by colony formation assay .
** , p < 0.01 , compared with u251n - pc cells .
heparanase overexpression induces phosphorylation of akt to investigate the involvement of signaling cascades that might be activated by heparanase , the phosphorylation levels of akt , erk1 , integrin - mediated fak and beta1 integrin were examined by western blot analysis .
the phosphorylation levels of akt were noticeably increased in heparanase - overexpressing u251n cells .
to confirm the change of p - akt in heparanase overexpressing cells , akt downstream targets , p - enos and p - gsk3 , were determined by western blot .
increased phosphorylstion of enos and gsk3 were found in correlation with the change of p - akt in u251n - hpa cells .
the beta1 integrin , phosphorylation of fak and erk1 appeared unchanged ( figure 5 ) .
figure 5 heparanase regulates signal pathways .
u251n - hpa cells showed increased phospho - akt and akt downstream targets , phospho - enos and phospho - gsk3 .
beta1 integrin , phospho - fak and phospho - erk levels were not significantly changed .
discussion in addition to proteolytic enzymes like mmps and serine proteases , heparanase , given its ability to degrade hspgs , may play a role in cancer cell invasion .
using u251n cells , we provide evidence that enhanced heparanase significantly increases cell invasion .
the increased cell invasion can be significantly blocked by heparin , a heparanase inhibitor [ 28 - 31 ] , indicating that cell invasion is a direct effect of heparanase enzyme activity .
apart from its traditional function , heparanase shows a potential in regulating cell chemotactic migration , cell proliferation and anchorage - independent colony formation which seems to be independent of the degradation of ecm .
heparanase may involve in regulation of gene expression through its enzyme activity .
like what have been found in this work , increased akt phosphorylation might be one of the targets of heparanase regulation .
we have no direct evidences to conclude that increased cell migration and growth by heparanase - overexpression is the results of elevated akt phosphorylation .
as akt is involved in multiple cellular functions [ 32 ] , the increased akt phosphorylation may contribute to the changes of these cell function .
in fact , heparanase has been reported in the regulation of various signal transduction pathways [ 19,21,22,33 ] .
however , the transduction pathway likely differs in different cell types .
for glioma cells , overexpression of heparanase in u87 cells causes increased phosphorylation of fak and akt , decreased phosphorylation of erk and unchanged phosphorylation of p38 [ 20 ] .
in another study , overexpression of heparanase in rat c6 glioma cells shows increased phosphorylation of p38 , but phosphorylation of erk remain unchanged [ 21 ] .
our results demonstrate that overexpression of heparanase in u251n cells increases phosphorylation of akt , while phosphorylation of erk1 and fak is not altered .
thus , heparanase may affect several key signaling components essential for tumor progression .
a key issue is to determine the heparanase binding site and how heparanase regulates gene expression and various signaling proteins .
in summary , using well described human glioma cell line u251n [ 34,35 ] , we found that heparanase has the potential to regulate tumor cell invasion , chemotactic migration and proliferation .
akt signaling might be the target of heparanase .
further studies on different tumor cell lines are warranted .

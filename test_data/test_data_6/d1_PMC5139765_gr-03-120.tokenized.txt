background this study was to investigate the pathological significance of protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase - 1 ( mmp1 ) and matrix metalloproteinase - 3 ( mmp3 ) in colon tissues of remission patients of steroid - dependent uncreative colitis ( sduc ) .
methods to test the possible involvement of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in sduc , western - blot and immunohistochemistry were applied to examine the protein expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in the colonic healing region from 10 remission patients with sduc as well as from 10 remission patients with non - sduc .
ten specimens from normal colon tissues were used as controls .
results compared with the control group , the protein expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 from non - sduc remission patients slightly increased ( p > 0.05 ) , in contrast , those from sduc patients significantly increased ( p < 0.01 ) .
conclusions over - expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of sduc .
ulcerative colitis metalloproteinase steroid - dependent introduction the etiology of ulcerative colitis ( uc ) is unclear , the lesions of uc mostly locate in the mucosa and submucosa of colorectal region with chronic unspecific inflammation .
though the steroid is the key agent commonly used for remission of uc , the long - term administration of corticosteroid may reduce its efficacy and incur much side - effects , therefore , currently the steroid is not recommended for the maintenance therapy of uc [ 1 ] .
approximately , 20 % of uc patients are steroid - dependent ulcerative colitis ( sduc ) , sduc is characterized by effective response to corticosteroid ( cs ) initially but followed by relapse of symptoms if dosage reduction or withdrawal of cs. usually , several courses of treatment are needed to control the symptoms and achieve remission [ 2 ] .
undoubtedly , to elucidate the pathogenesis of sduc is of utmost importance for overcome this illness .
at present , it is generally accepted that the imbalance of synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) is an essential factor in the ulcer formation of uc , during this process , the matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) play important roles .
mmps belong to a family of zinc - dependent endopeptidase , which are mainly produced and secreted by connective tissue , endothelial cells , mononuclear macrophages , neutrophils and tumor cells .
the mmps participate in the degradation of ecm components [ 3 ] .
many animal and clinical studies showed that in the uc lesion area , several mmps express increasingly , however , their expression are relatively low in the normal area [ 4 - 7 ] , all these evidences indicate that mmps play key roles in the onset of uc. within the mmp family , mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 participate the tissue repair , and play roles in the uc occurrence [ 8 ] .
however , to our knowledge , there is no report regarding whether the mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 are associated with the onset of sduc .
in this study , we determined the expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in sduc , in order to investigate their roles in sduc .
patients and methods patients twenty uc patients were from inpatient or outpatient department in our hospital from july 2006 to december 2008 .
all cases meet the uc diagnostic criteria amended in national ulcerative colitis conference ( chengdu , china ) in the year of 2000 .
among these 20 cases , 10 non - sduc patients were controlled effectively by sulfasalazine ( sasp ) treatment ; 10 sduc patients were treated with prednisone as maintenance therapy .
all 20 uc patients achieved remission after treatments .
ten cases from healthy group were used as controls .
this study was approved by the hospital ethical committee , and informed consent was obtained from each patient .
reagents monoclonal anti - mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 antibodies were purchased from santa cruz ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , california , usa ) .
monoclonal anti - glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) antibody was from kangcheng company ( shanghai , china ) .
horseradish peroxides ( hrp ) goat anti - mouse antibody tag was from jingmei biotechnology company ( shanghai , china ) .
marker for western blot was purchased from new england biolabs inc ( shanghai , china ) .
electrogenerated chemiluminescence ( ecl ) kit was purchased from pierce company ( usa ) .
immunohistochemistry kit was purchased from boshide company ( wuhan , china ) .
sample collection and processing specimens from 20 cases of uc patients were taken from multiple points ( 8 - 10 points per case ) in healing region of colon based on the previous colonoscopy reports .
the control samples were taken from 8 - 10 points in sigmoid colon in each case .
partial samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 degreesc , the rest were fixed in 10 % neutral formalin .
western blot western blot was used to detect the expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 .
firstly , total protein was extracted from specimens .
the protein sample was boiled for 5 min at 95 - 100 degreesc and resolved in 10 % sds polyacrylamide gel ( running for 2.5 h ) .
the gel was then transferred to a membrane , followed by incubation of the membrane with primary antibody solution , 4degreesc overnight .
after washing , the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody for 1h at room temperature .
for the last step , the membrane was washed and detected by ecl .
the same procedure was repeated using the same membrane except using anti - gapdh as primary antibody ( 1:5000 dilution ) for internal standard .
the bands were analyzed using biology electrophoresis analysis system fr - 980 , which can automatically read and record the value of each band .
the ratio of sample to internal standard was used for statistic analysis .
immunohistochemical staining ( polymeric method ) the sample sections were deparaffinized and hydrated , followed by incubation with 0.3 % h2o2 in pbs for 10 minutes at 37 degreesc , then rinsed in 0.01 m pbs ( ph 7.35 - 7.4 ) for 3 times ( 5 min each ) .
after applied to heat antigen retrieval , the sections were rinsed in 0.01m pbs ( ph 7.35 - 7.4 ) for 3 times ( 5 min each ) , then were incubated in 5 % goat serum for 20 min at 37 degreesc to block non - specific bindings .
the primary antibody was applied to the sections for 1 hour at 37 degreesc , then rinsed 3 times ( 5 min each ) in 0.01m pbs ( ph 7.35 - 7.4 ) , incubated with hr coupled secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 degreesc , and rinsed in 0.01m pbs ( ph 7.35 - 7.4 ) for 3 times ( 5 min each ) , followed by incubation with dab solution for 10 min .
finally , sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 - 10 min .
for the control , pbs ( ph 7.4 ) was applied to replace primary antibody .
semiquantitative scoring of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 expression for mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 expression evaluation , a semiquantitative scoring system was used according to the grading immunostaining patterns .
five high - power fields ( 400x ) were randomly chosen for each slide .
the percentage of stained cells was scored on a semiquantitative scale of 0 - 4 , using the following criteria : 0 , 0 % ; 1 , less than 25 % for the stained cells ; 2 , 25 - 50 % ; 3 , 50 - 75 % ; 4 , more than 75 % .
the intensity of immunostaining was scored as : 0 , no staining ; 1 , weak ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , intense .
the final immunohistochemical score results were derived from multiplying the percentage score by the staining intensity score , with minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 12 .
statistical analysis the software spss16.0 ( spss , chicago , usa ) was used for statistical analysis .
the values were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( x +/ - sd ) .
the statistical differences among multiple group data were determined by one - way anova .
a non parametric analysis was used to compare the immunostaining scores .
a p < 0.5 was considered statistically significant .
results mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 protein expression in colonic tissue compared with control , mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 protein expression were not increased in the healing region of colon in the group of non - sduc patients ( p > 0.05 ) , however , significant increase of the proteins was detected in the sduc group ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 1 , 2 ) .

semiquantitative assay of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 expression the semiquantitative analysis showed that the expressions of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in sduc group were significantly higher that of non - sduc group ( p < 0.5 ) .
discussion the steroid dependency of ulcerative colitis is one of the causes of refractoriness in ulcerative colitis .
to date , the mechanisms of this disease are not well understood .
recently , the role of mmps in pathogenesis of uc has brought more attentions .
mmps participate both the enteric impairment and repair , this was confirmed in an experiment using human fetal intestine culture model , in which the poke week mitogen ( pwm ) can induce the t lymphocytes to produce mmps , and the latter impair the intestinal mucosal tissue , presented with epithelial removal and villi disappearance [ 9 ] .
according to the structure and substrate specificities , the mmps can be divided into six groups , namely , collagenase , gelatinase , interstitial lysin , elastase , membrane protease and other types of mmp [ 10 ] .
the evidences have indicated that over - expression and increased activities of mmps could lead to injury and inflammation in colonic mucosa [ 11 ] .
among these mmps , the mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 , located in fibroblast and macrophages , are playing outstanding roles ; they impair the intestinal mucosa after being activated by certain inflammatory factors , such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha , nuclear factor - kappabeta , pro - inflammatory interleukins [ 8 ] .
within the mmp family , mmp - 1 is also known as an interstitial collagenase and mainly acts in degradation of collagen i , ii , iii , iv and proteoglycans , which renders them sensitive to gelatinase ; while the mmp - 3 belongs to the family of mesenchymal lysine , it can degrade most of the ecm components and activate other mmps [ 12 ] .
previous studies have reported that the mmp activities significantly increased in both uc and crohn 's disease [ 13 ] .
further studies have also reveled that mrna expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 correlates the degree of inflammation in uc patients , and the level of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 mrna expression in inflicted region is 15 - fold higher than that in normal colonic mucosa , indicating that over - expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in uc patients plays important roles in tissue injury and repairing processes [ 4 , 8 ] .
in this study , we have demonstrated that the protein expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 significantly increased in healing region of colon tissue in sduc remission patients but not in non - sduc remission patients , suggesting that over - expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 is not only a key factor in the pathogenesis of uc , but also a critical feature in steroid - dependency of uc. further investigations on this issue are of great significance in clarifying the mechanisms of steroid - dependency in sduc .

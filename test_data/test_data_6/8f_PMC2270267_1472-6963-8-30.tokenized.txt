background paediatric ent services in regional areas can be provided through telemedicine ( tele - ent ) using videoconferencing or with a conventional outpatient department ent service ( opd - ent ) in which patients travel to see the specialist .
the objective of this study was to identify the least - cost approach to providing ent services for paediatric outpatients .
methods a cost - minimisation analysis was conducted comparing the annual costs of the two modes of service provided by the royal children 's hospital ( rch ) in brisbane .
activity records were reviewed to analyse volume of activity during a 12 month period in 2005 , i.e. number of clinics , duration of clinics , number of consultations via telemedicine and in outpatient clinics , diagnoses , and travel related information .
a sensitivity analysis was conducted using factors where there was some uncertainty or potential future variation .
results during the study period , 88 ent consultations were conducted via videoconference for 70 patients at bundaberg base hospital .
177 ent consultations were conducted at the rch for 117 patients who had travelled from the bundaberg region to brisbane .
the variable cost of providing the tele - ent service was a $ 108 per consultation , compared with a $ 155 per consultation for the conventional outpatient service .
telemedicine was cheaper when the workload exceeded 100 consultations per year .
if all 265 consultations were conducted as tele - ent consultations , the cost - savings would be $ 7,621 .
conclusion the cost - minimisation analysis demonstrated that under the circumstances described in this paper , the tele - ent service was a more economical method for the health department of providing specialist ent services .
background delivering specialty care to children living in the vast region of queensland is challenging and often requires patients to travel to tertiary centres for specialist consultations .
in some circumstances , specialists travel to regional hospitals to conduct outreach clinics .
the cost to families and the healthcare system is substantial .
for example , the state government 's health department in queensland ( queensland health ) provides financial assistance to patients who need access to specialist medical services , through the patient travel subsidy scheme .
in the 2005 - 2006 financial year , $ 28 million was spent on patient travel [ 1 ] .
ear , nose and throat ( ent ) disorders are common and represent a large proportion of healthcare problems in children .
consequently , there is a high rate of referrals to ent specialty clinics [ 2 - 5 ] .
in north queensland , the prevalence of childhood ent problems , especially otitis media , is extremely high ( 66 % - 95 %) among aboriginal children [ 6 - 8 ] .
the royal children 's hospital ( rch ) in brisbane is one of two major paediatric tertiary referral hospitals which service queensland .
in 2005 , there were 4,819 ent outpatient department consultations ( opd ) and 1,980 ent inpatient admissions to the hospital .
telemedicine has been used for the pre - screening of potential ent surgical patients as part of a research project facilitated by the university of queensland 's centre for online health ( coh ) [ 9 ] .
since 2003 , patients in selected regional areas have been referred by their local primary healthcare providers to a telemedicine clinic at their local hospital .
instead of travelling to brisbane to see the specialist , an ent consultation is conducted via videoconference .
during the videoconference appointment , an ent examination is carried out using a video - otoscope connected to the videoconference system .
the specialist is able to view real - time ent images at a bandwidth of 384 kbit / s as well as hearing test results and x - rays transmitted via a document camera .
connected at a distance by a videoconference system , the specialist can discuss the history and clinical findings with the patient / family and the local paediatrician in order to make a decision about diagnosis and clinical management ( figure 1 ) .
a coordinator based at coh travels to the regional site and provides technical support during each clinic session .

the specialist is able to view video - otoscopic images during a videoconference appointment .
bundaberg is the region where the pilot tele - ent work has been carried out .
bundaberg is a coastal region situated approximately 385 km north of the brisbane ( figure 2 ) .
the population of bundaberg and surrounding area is about 74,000 [ 10 ] .
in 2005 , the rch conducted 177 conventional outpatient ent ( opd - ent ) consultations for children referred from bundaberg .
in addition , a total of 88 ent consultations were conducted by telemedicine .
figure 2 map of queensland .
there are very few studies which have compared the clinical outcomes and costs of telemedicine services to the costs of conventional outpatient services ; there are almost none in the area of tele - ent .
pedersen first reported the use of endoscopic cameras and videoconferencing systems in norway [ 11,12 ] .
tele - ent has also been described as a useful application in military medicine [ 13 ] .
previous work done in queensland demonstrated the feasibility of videoconferencing for the assessment of otolaryngology conditions during the pre - screening of potential surgical patients .
the study described potential savings from the use of telemedicine and suggested that further studies were required on the cost - effectiveness [ 9 ] .
the objective of the present study was to identify the least - cost approach to providing ent services for paediatric outpatients in a regional town in queensland .
methods we conducted a cost - minimisation analysis to compare the cost of the tele - ent service in bundaberg to the cost of providing the conventional rch outpatient service for patients travelling from bundaberg .
we analysed the annual cost of the tele - ent service for the 2005 calendar year .
this was compared with the cost of the conventional outpatient service during the same 12 - month period .
the outcomes of the consultations were assumed to be the same whether delivered face - to - face or by telemedicine .
study subjects were : a. patients who attended tele - ent clinics in bundaberg for their appointments .
these patients were referred by the paediatrician who participated in the tele - ent clinics. b. patients who travelled to brisbane and visited opd - ent clinics at rch for their regular appointments .
they were referred by other physicians in bundaberg .
ent service information was obtained from the rch information system and the telepaediatric service activity records maintained by the coh .
clinical information was collected from rch medical records .
travel costs and reimbursement information was obtained from the bundaberg base hospital travel office and from the patient travel subsidy scheme ( ptss ) .
the following data were collected : number of clinics , duration of the clinic , number of patients and consultations via telemedicine , number of patients visiting rch and outpatient consultations provided , diagnoses , travel distance and travel mode ( e.g. by car , rail or air ) , and travel reimbursement information .
cost minimisation analysis we calculated the fixed and variable costs of providing the ent services using a costing model similar to other reported studies [ 14 - 19 ] .
tele - ent service costs were classified as either fixed or variable costs .
fixed costs are those that are independent of the number of patients using the service , such as equipment and facilities .
variable costs are the associated costs of conducting each consultation .
all costs were described in 2005 australian dollars ( a $ 1 =~ us $ 0.80 ) .
fixed costs were a video - otoscope ( flexiscope microvision ent camera , inline systems ) and a document camera used to transmit images of hard copy documents such as hearing tests and x - rays .
annual equivalent costs were calculated over a period of five years using an annual discount rate of 5 % .
since both the rch and the regional centre had existing videoconferencing equipment and isdn lines ( for other telehealth services and education programmes ) , the proportion of the fixed costs of these items ascribed to ent would have been very small and therefore they were ignored .
facility costs were also excluded as both services utilized existing hospital infrastructure .
variable costs were based on the standard charges and rates in queensland .
these included staff salaries and travel costs , isdn line charges and patient travel costs .
the time and duration of a consultation depends on the sub - specialty and nature of the consultation .
the average tele - ent consultation time per patient was about 10 minutes , i.e. it was similar to an outpatient face - to - face ent consultation time .
therefore , the cost of the ent specialist 's time was about the same , regardless of mode of consultation , and was excluded .
patients who were referred to the rch for outpatient consultations were eligible for reimbursement for part of their travel cost through the ptss .
the bundaberg hospital travel office reported that most patients who visited rch travelled by rail in 2005 .
the cost calculation for travel was therefore based on the rail fare .
for an outpatient visit , the patient / family was funded for a return trip and accommodation for one night .
however , only some families lodged claims or made travel arrangements through the hospital travel office in bundaberg .
therefore , we calculated the annual costs to the health department based on the number of consultations conducted during 2005 , rather than ptss bookings or claims through the travel office .
additional costs to the family , such as time off work , parking , fuel and meals were not analysed during this study .
because this study was designed as a cost - minimisation analysis , the threshold ( break - even point ) at which the tele - ent service became less costly than the opd - ent service was estimated .
a sensitivity analysis was conducted using factors where there was some uncertainty or potential future variation .
these factors were related to the cost and usage of the video - otoscope , isdn line charges and the proportion of patients who utilised the ptss .
the tele - ent project was approved by the appropriate ethics and hospital committees .
ethics permission was not required for the cost analysis .
results in 2005 , nine tele - ent clinic sessions were conducted and a total of 88 ent consultations were provided via videoconference for 70 patients at bundaberg base hospital .
the average number of consultations was 7 per month over the 12 - month period , ranging from 7 to 13 consultations each month ( excluding case discussion sessions when patients were not present ) .
the average number of consultations via telemedicine was 1.3 per patient over the 12 - month study period ( table 1 ) .

the average number of consultations in this group was 15 per month , ranging from 4 to 27 consultations each month .
the average number of consultations per patient was 1.5 in 2005 ( see table 1 , figure 3 ) .
figure 3 ent clinical activity in 2005 ( both modalities ) .
clinical categories medical chart reviews confirmed that the types of cases diagnosed during the tele - ent and opd - ent clinics were similar ( table 2 ) .
the main diagnoses were otitis media , recurrent tonsillitis , obstructive sleep apnoea , grommets review , hearing loss , allergic rhinitis and cleft palate reviews .
we found that there were substantial differences in the proportion of certain conditions diagnosed in each group , which we suspect was mainly because subjects were sorted according to mode of consultations rather than actual clinical conditions .

the initial cost of the video - otoscope was $ 15,000 and the cost of a document camera was $ 5,000 .
assuming these pieces of equipment both have a life of five years , and using a discount rate of 5 % , the annual equivalent cost of the equipment was $ 4,620 ( table 3 ) .

other variable costs included a technician 's salary of $ 30 per hour for one working day ( 8 hours ) , the technician 's return airfare and isdn line charges at a rate of $ 110 per hour .

the annual cost of providing 88 consultations was $ 14,160 .
the estimated total annual costs would have been $ 33,348 if all ent consultations ( 265 ) had been conducted via telemedicine at a variable cost of $ 108 each plus fixed costs of $ 4,620 .
opd - ent service costs the queensland health ptss reimbursement for bundaberg patients was $ 94.60 ($ 30.80 for a child plus $ 63.80 for the escort ) for travel by rail to brisbane .
accommodation assistance was provided to the patient and an approved escort of up to $ 30 per person per night .
thus , for a paediatric opd appointment , the accommodation cost was $ 60 .
for the 177 opd consultations conducted in 2005 , the estimated costs of travel by train and accommodation were $ 16,744 and $ 10,620 respectively .
thus , the average estimated travel cost per opd consultation was $ 155 .
assuming all ent consultations conducted in 2005 were conducted in outpatients ( opd - ent ) , the estimated annual travel costs would have been $ 41,075 ( i.e. 265 consultations at $ 155 each ) .
threshold during the study , the total cost for an opd consultation was $ 155 per consultation and for tele - ent the cost was $ 161 per consultation .
the variable costs were less for tele - ent compared with opd ($ 108 vs $ 155 ) .
thus , tele - ent was slightly more costly than opd due to the fixed costs for the video - otoscope and document camera .
we calculated the threshold ( break - even point ) at which the tele - ent service became less costly than the opd - ent service ( figure 4 ) .
the threshold point was 100 consultations. that is , additional tele - ent consultations above this threshold were cost - saving for the health department compared with outpatient consultations .
the difference between conducting all 265 consultations conventionally and all 265 by telemedicine was a cost - saving of $ 7,621 .
figure 4 threshold analysis .
sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis showed that the expected useful life of the video - otoscope was a key factor ; the effect on the results of changes in the life of the instrument was greater than the effect of changes in the initial cost of the instrument .
the costs of accommodation and travel were also important factors ; when these costs were increased , fewer opd - ent consultations were required for tele - ent to become cost - saving .
similarly , when the costs of isdn line charges were reduced by 50 % , fewer consultations were required for tele - ent to be cost - saving .
the travel costs for a technician had a relatively substantial effect on the result .
for example , when these were increased by 50 % , 147 consultations would need to be performed by tele - ent for the service to be cost - saving .
however , if a local technician could be employed or seconded on a pro - rata basis , travel costs would reduce towards zero .
under this scenario , tele - ent becomes cost - saving when 60 consultations are undertaken .
the discount rate had a relatively small effect only ( table 5 ) .

if a tele - ent service was to be introduced to a location that did not have this infrastructure , additional expenditure would be required .
to establish a new site , the fixed costs would increase to include basic videoconferencing equipment and installation of telecommunications .
we estimate these would cost an annual equivalent of $ 12,750 over a five - year period ( see table 6 ) .

discussion there is an emerging literature on the utility and efficacy of telemedicine .
however , studies of the cost effectiveness of telemedicine practice have been limited .
according to a number of systematic reviews , there is a lack of persuasive evidence about whether telemedicine is a cost - effective way of delivering health care [ 20,21 ] .
the present study suggests that from the perspective of the health service provider , the tele - ent service is less expensive than the conventional opd service in existing telehealth facilities as shown in table 3 .
the tele - ent service was cheaper when the workload exceeded 100 consultations per year .
this is significant to the region of bundaberg where 265 ent consultations took place in 2005 .
our finding is consistent with other studies that suggest that with a higher number of telemedicine consultations , greater savings are made by the health service provider [ 14,17,19 ] .
in the case of bundaberg , 33 % of all ent consultations were conducted via telemedicine in 2005 .
if each telemedicine consultation was a direct substitute for an outpatient consultation , then the tele - ent service was cost - saving .
this suggests that potential savings to the health system could be obtained if telemedicine was utilized on a wider scale for paediatric ent services , particularly for regions with similar patient referral rates and at similar or greater distances from the specialist centre .
in principle , the service could be expanded to other suitable sites without a major increase in fixed costs , especially in locations with existing telemedicine facilities .
however , there are a number of factors that need to be considered should tele - ent services be expanded .
these include the availability of ent specialists , involvement of regional clinical staff and technical support .
the service also relies on an adequate telemedicine infrastructure .
although not formally measured in the present analysis , the family costs of not having to travel to brisbane to see a specialist should be acknowledged .
this is certainly the case for families living in the rural areas where specialist services are lacking .
smith et al ( 2003 ) compared the family costs of attending hospital outpatient appointments via videoconference and in person .
the results of that economic study suggested that it was much more expensive and inconvenient to travel to the rch for an outpatient consultation than it was to attend a telepaediatric consultation at a regional hospital [ 22 ] .
travel to brisbane from bundaberg usually takes 5 - 6 hours by car or train - one way. from the health department 's perspective , tele - ent cost an additional a $ 6 per consultation more than opd during the study period ; however , each additional tele - ent consultation would save the health department $ 46 because all fixed costs have been covered .
in addition , many regional families have no choice but to take time off work to attend an appointment in brisbane and children are unable to attend school .
there are also out - of - pocket expenses which are not reimbursed by the health service such as child care costs , meals and parking fees .
if all of these costs were taken into consideration , the overall societal economics of doing telemedicine would have been even more favourable .
few studies have examined the clinical outcomes of tele - ent in comparison to opd - ent consultations .
several studies have investigated the accuracy of pre - recorded digital images and found over 80 % concordance compared with follow - up and real - time consultations [ 23,24 ] .
there are a number of studies which have compared real - time and store - and forward ent tele - consultations .
these studies found a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy using real - time methods [ 25,26 ] .
a recent study examined the accuracy of real - time telemedicine for paediatric ent pre - admission screening .
data on the patient 's initial videoconference diagnosis and management strategy were compared to eventual primary diagnosis and patient care .
the diagnostic and treatment agreement were both over 90 % [ 27 ] .
there are certain limitations in the present study .
we assumed that the clinical outcome from a tele - ent consultation was similar to that from an outpatient consultation .
also there were substantial clinical variations between the two study groups since the clinical case - mix was not controlled .
finally , it was an observational study and not a randomised controlled trial .
thus the economics of using telemedicine for paediatric ent assessments will require further investigation before definitive conclusions can be drawn .
conclusion in summary , the present study compared the costs of a tele - ent service to the costs of providing opd - ent services in the conventional manner .
the cost analysis was based on the annual activities during 2005 , and suggests that savings to the health care system could be made when actual workload exceeded 100 tele - ent consultations .
the variable cost of tele - ent consultation was less than the cost of travel to brisbane from a regional area to attend opd - ent clinics .

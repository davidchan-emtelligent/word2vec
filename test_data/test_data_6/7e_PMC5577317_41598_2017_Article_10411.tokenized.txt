this study was aimed at investigating the chemical stability ( the thermal , light and ph stability ) of phenylethanoid glycosides ( phgs ) in osmanthus fragrans lour .
flowers , identifying the degradation products of acteoside and salidroside ( major phgs in o. fragrans flowers ) by uplc - qtof - ms and studying the anti - hypoxia activity of phgs after degradation .
the degradation of phgs followed first - order reaction kinetics , and the rate constant of acteoside ( 4.3 to 203.4 x 10 - 3 day - 1 ) was higher than that of salidroside ( 3.9 to 33.3 x 10 - 3 day - 1 ) in o. fragrans flowers .
salidroside was mainly hydrolyzed to tyrosol during storage , and the degradation products of acteoside were verbasoside , caffeic acid , isoacteoside , etc .
in a model of cobalt chloride ( cocl2 ) - induced hypoxia in pc12 cells , the anti - hypoxia ability of phgs decreased after degradation , which resulted from the reduction of phgs contents .
particularly , caffeic acid exhibited stronger anti - hypoxia ability than acteoside and could slightly increase the anti - hypoxia ability of degraded acteoside .
the results revealed that high temperature , high ph and light exposure caused phgs degradation , and thus the anti - hypoxia ability of phgs reduced .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction osmanthus fragrans ( thunb. ) lour .
( sweet osmanthus ) , belonging to the oleaceae family1 , is widely planted in south and middle china2 , 3 .
osmanthus fragrans is famous for its fragrant flowers , which are small flowers with four - lobed corolla and varies in colors , such as white , pale yellow , yellow and orange - yellow3 .
they are widely cultivated as ornamental plants1 , 4 .
in china , o. fragrans flowers have been used as foods ( such as beverage , pastry , paste , etc. ) 5 , 6 and traditional chinese medicine1 for a long time .
in recent studies , the extracts of o. fragrans flowers have showed the abilities of neuroprotection7 , anti - aging8 , anti - inflammatory2 , 9 , antioxidantion10 - 13 and inhibiting melanogenesis10 .
previous studies revealed that the anti - aging and antioxidant activities of o. fragrans flowers were well correlated with phenylethanoid glycosides ( phgs ) , especially the acteoside ( also named verbascoside ) 8 , 12 , 13 .
phgs are a class of naturally occurring phenols , which are abundant in o. fragrans flowers with the total phenylethanoid glycoside ( tpg ) content ranged from 92.66 to 130.57 milligrams of acteoside equivalents ( ae ) per gram of dry weight ( mg ae / g dw ) 12 .
acteoside and salidroside were two main phgs in o. fragrans flowers with the content of 32.78 to 71.79 mg / g dw and 4.72 to 16.08 mg / g dw12 , respectively .
acteoside has the ability of protecting nerve cells , for instance , acteoside protects pheochromocytoma ( pc12 ) neuronal cells against 1 - methyl - 4 - phenylpyridinium ion ( mpp +) - induced apoptotic or necrotic death14 .
also acteoside can protect the human neuroblastoma sh - sy5y cells from beta - amyloid - induced cell damage15 and mpp + - induced injury16 .
salidroside shows similar neuroprotective effects17 - 19 .
particularly , salidroside can protect pc12 cell from cocl2 - induced hypoxia damage20 , 21 .
thus , we consider acteoside and phgs in o. fragrans flowers have the potential ability of anti - hypoxia in pc12 cell .
considering the benefits mentioned above , phgs in o. fragrans flowers have potential to be used in functional food or medicine .
however , acteoside in solution is unstable , and is easy to be destroyed by a number of factors such as temperature22 , 23 , ph24 , 25 and light23 , 25 during storage .
there is no more available information in previous literatures on the degradation kinetics and degradation products of acteoside and salidroside .
therefore , the objectives of this work were ( 1 ) to evaluate the effects of temperature , ph and light on the degradation kinetics of acteoside , salidroside and tpg in o. fragrans flower extracts ( ofe ) ; ( 2 ) to identify the degradation products of acteoside and salidroside by uplc - qtof - ms / ms ; ( 3 ) to investigate the anti - hypoxia activities of acteoside , salidroside and tpg after degradation .
results and discussion degradation kinetics of phenylethanoid glycosides as shown in fig. 1a,b and c ( contents at 0 day ) , the tpg , salidroside and acteoside contents in ofe were 117.23 mug ae / ml , 7.46 mug / ml and 76.61 mug / ml , respectively .
the acteoside content was slightly higher than that determined by jiang et al.12 , which might be due to the different origin of o. fragrans flowers and / or extraction conditions ( solvent , 80 % aqueous acetone vs 95 % ethanol ; temperature , 40 degreesc vs 20 degreesc ; solid : solvent ratio , 1:15 vs 1:10 ) .
for thermal stability of tpg , the contents ( after 90 days ) decreased by 17.64 % , 35.39 % , 76.90 % and 87.00 % at 4 , 20 , 37 and 50 degreesc , respectively .
as for 80 degreesc , the tpg content decreased by 84.25 % after 7 days .
it showed that the degradation of tpg accelerated with the elevation of temperatures .
besides temperature , light and ph also affected the tpg stability , and the degradation of tpg increased with light exposure and the elevation of ph values .
the degradation of salidroside and acteoside exhibited similar pattern .

the degradation of phgs fitted to the first - order kinetic equation with r 2 higher than 0.94 for all treatments ( table 1 ). with temperature increasing , the first - order reaction rate constant ( k ) values increased rapidly and the half - life time ( t 1 / 2 ) values decreased ( table 1 ) .
it revealed that greater degradation of phgs occurred at higher temperature .
at the same temperature ( 20 degreesc ) , the t 1 / 2 value of phgs in the light was lower than that in the dark , indicating phgs were less stable in the light than those in the dark .
the ph level also influenced the stability of phgs .
considering the ph of some products , tea beverages are generally 5 to 726 , while detergents such as soap can reach 9 .
therefore , ph was set from 5 to 9 in present study .
as shown in table 1 , the increase of ph ( from 5.0 to 9.0 ) hastened the phgs degradation .

the k values and t 1 / 2 values of tpg ( including 6.36 % salidroside and 65.35 % acteoside ) in ofe ranged from 2.1 x 10 - 3 to 251 x 10 - 3 day - 1 and 2.8 to 330.1 day ( table 1 ) , respectively .
at lower temperatures ( 4 degreesc and 20 degreesc ) and lower ph values ( ph 5.0 and ph 6.0 ) , the t 1 / 2 values of tpg were higher , while they decreased drastically at high temperatures ( 50 degreesc and 80 degreesc ) and high ph values ( ph 9.0 ) .
the t 1 / 2 values of salidroside in ofe ranged from 20.8 to 177.7 day .
at the same condition , the t 1 / 2 value of acteoside in ofe was lower than that of salidroside , indicating that acteoside was less stable than salidroside .
it was attributable to the different molecular structures of salidroside and acteoside .
salidroside is phenylethanoid monosaccharides , while acteoside is phenylethanoid disaccharide and has ester linkage , which is easy to be hydrolyzed .
the calculated activation energy ( ea ) values of tpg , salidroside and acteoside in ofe were 50.40 , 21.63 and 69.14 kj / mol , respectively ( table 1 ) .
higher ea values indicate stronger temperature dependence , that is the reaction running slowly at low temperature but fast at high temperature27 .
so acteoside in ofe was more susceptible to temperature elevation during heating .
the t 1 / 2 values of salidroside and acteoside standards were higher than those of salidroside and acteoside in ofe with same treatments .
the results showed that the standards of salidroside and acteoside were more stable than those in ofe under the same storage condition .
as the ofe was crude extract ( including enzyme , organic acids , etc. ) , some of these compounds might accelerate the degradation28 of salidroside and acteoside in ofe , compared with the standards .
these findings revealed that the degradation of phgs follows first - order reaction kinetic , which could be used to predict their contents during storage .
phenylethanoid glycosides were unstable at high temperature , high ph and light exposure conditions , therefore phgs should be stored in the dark at low temperature and ph. main degradation products of salidroside and acteoside for tentative identification of the degradation products , the degraded salidroside and acteoside were analyzed by uplc - qtof - ms / ms. tyrosol , salidroside , caffeic acid , acteoside and isoacteoside were further identified using standards , and other degradation products were tentatively identified using the ms data .
as shown in fig. 2 and supplementary fig. s1 , salidroside degradation product ( sd ) was the main degradation product of salidroside for all experiment treatment .
comparing the mass data with tyrosol standard , sd was identified as tyrosol , which was the aglycone of salidroside ( structures shown in fig. 3a ) .
it indicated that salidroside was mainly hydrolyzed to tyrosol during storage .
the ms / ms spectrum and proposed fragmentation pathway of salidroside and tyrosol are shown in supplementary fig. s2 .

sd : salidroside degradation product .
figure 3 chemical structures of salidroside ( a ) , acteoside ( b ) and their possible degradation products .
acteoside generated more degradation products ( supplementary fig. s3 ) than salidroside during storage .
as shown in fig. 3b , acteoside was composed of four chemical moieties , including caffeic acid , hydroxytyrosol ( phenylethanoid aglycone ) , glucose ( central saccharide ) and rhamnose .
the ester linkage , linking caffeic acid and glucose , could be easily hydrolyzed under some conditions .
at the lower temperatures (<= 37 degreesc ) , acteoside was hydrolyzed to verbasoside and caffeic acid ( fig. 4a , table 2 and supplementary fig. s3a ) , and also isomerized into isoacteoside , while at high temperatures ( 50 and 80 degreesc , fig. 4b ) , acteoside were hydrolyzed to verbasoside and isomerized into isoacteoside .
acteoside and isoacteoside were further oxidized to campneoside ii and isocampneoside ii , respectively .
acteoside was also oxidized to beta - oxoacteoside , and the degradation products of ad1 , ad5 and ad6 were identified as unknown compounds ( table 2 ) according to the current information .

exposure to light compared to the dark , it increased hydrolysis of acteoside to verbasoside and caffeic acid , and isomerization to isoacteoside ( fig. 4a , table 2 and supplementary fig. s3b ) .
in previous study , d'imperio25 found that acteoside was quite unstable at ph 7 and could isomerize to isoacteoside .
in the present study , when ph values ranged from 5.0 to 7.0 ( all samples stored in the dark ) , we found the main degradation products of acteoside were verbasoside , caffeic acid and isoacteoside ( fig. 4a , table 2 and supplementary fig. s3c ) , indicating that acteoside was mainly hydrolyzed and isomerized in acidic or neutral solution at 20 degreesc .
however , in alkaline solution ( ph 9.0 ) , acteoside were hydrolyzed to cistanoside f and isomerized into isoacteoside ( fig. 4c , table 2 and supplementary fig. s3c ) .
further , acteoside was oxidized to campneoside ii and cyclized to oraposide , while isoacteoside was oxidized to isocampneoside ii and cyclized to isocrenatoside .
the degradation product of ad5 could not be tentatively identified according to the current information .
the ms / ms spectrum and proposed fragmentation pathway of acteoside and its degradation products are shown in supplementary fig. s4 .
at low temperature , acteoside isomerized into isoacteoside , and was hydrolyzed to verbasoside and caffeic acid in acidic or neutral solution , irrespective of storage in the dark or light .
however , under high temperature and alkaline conditions , acteoside could also be cyclized to oraposide , and oxidized to campneoside ii and beta - oxoacteoside .
protective effect of phenylethanoid glycosides against cocl2 - induced death in pc12 cells the 400 mum cocl2 treatment for 12 h induced significant decrease in cell viability ( 52.52 +/ - 0.31 % viability ) of cultured pc12 cells ( fig. 5 ) , as compared with that of control cells ( 100 % viability ) .
as shown in fig. 5 , treatment with salidroside ( 5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ) , acteoside ( 5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ) and ofe ( tpg contents : 5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ) significantly attenuated the cocl2 - induced decrease in cell viabilities in a concentration dependent way .
the treatment with 50 mug / ml ( 167 mum ) salidroside showed the maximum protection ( 81.15 +/ - 1.33 % viability ) among the given concentrations of salidroside , slightly higher than that of the treatment with 90 mum salidroside ( 79.6 % viability ) in a previous study21 .
also , the treatment with 25 mug / ml ( 83 mum ) salidroside showed lower cell viability ( 71.74 +/ - 0.93 %) than that in the previous study .
the cell viabilities of pc12 cells treated with 5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml acteoside ( equal to 8 , 40 and 80 mum ) were 61.67 % , 75.24 % and 86.13 % , respectively , higher than those of salidroside ( 58.44 % , 71.74 % and 81.15 % for 17 , 83 and 167 mum , respectively ) .
it revealed that acteoside could protect pc12 cells against cocl2 - induced hypoxia damage , even stronger than salidroside .
in addition , the tpg , salidroside and acteoside contents showed good correlation with anti - hypoxia activities , with correlation coefficients of 0.945 , 0.982 and 0.983 ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively .

as mentioned in the first part of result and discussion , the tpg , salidroside and acteoside contents decreased after degradation .
obviously , the cell viability of pc12 cells treated with degraded phgs was lower compared with that of undegraded phgs ( fig. 6 ) .
the cell viabilities of pc12 cells treated with ofe at high temperatures ( fig. 6a ) and high ph values ( fig. 6c ) were similar to that of model group , for acteoside and salidroside had almost disappeared in these treated samples .
as shown in fig. 6 , treatment with degraded salidroside significantly attenuated the cocl2 - induced decrease in cell viabilities of pc12 cells , though the cell viabilities of pc12 cells treated with degraded salidroside were lower , compared with that of undegraded salidroside ( fig. 6 ) .

for the degraded acteoside , the cell viabilities decreased ( fig. 6 ) as the acteoside concentrations declined. of particular note , the concentrations of acteoside at light ( ph 6.0 , 25 degreesc , fig. 1j ) and ph 7.0 ( 25 degreesc , dark , fig. 1o ) were 33.13 mug / ml and 31.41 mug / ml , respectively .
the final acteoside concentrations of these samples were approximately 3 mug / ml in the cell experiment .
however , we found that the cell viabilities in the presence of degraded acteoside by light ( 62.88 % , fig. 6b ) and ph 7.0 ( 64.00 % , fig. 6c ) were higher than that of 5 mug / ml acteoside ( 61.67 %) .
under these storage conditions , the degradation products of acteoside were caffeic acid , isoacteoside and verbasoside .
as shown in fig. 5 , the cell viability of pc12 cells treated with 5 mug / ml ( equal to 28 mum ) caffeic acid ( 81.22 %) were higher than that of acteoside ( 75.24 % for 40 mum ) , whereas the cell viabilities of pc12 cells treated with 5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ( equal to 8 , 40 and 80 mum ) isoacteoside ( 56.81 % , 61.19 % and 68.99 % , respectively ) were significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than those of acteoside .
the caffeic acid and isoacteoside contents also showed good correlation with anti - hypoxia activities , with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.96 ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively .
we considered that caffeic acid might increase anti - hypoxia ability of degraded acteoside .
in conclusion , the degradation of phgs ( tpg , salidroside and acteoside ) fitted to the first - order reaction kinetics , and temperature had the greatest effect on the k and t 1 / 2 values , followed by ph. it suggested that phgs should be stored at low temperature , low ph and dark condition .
during storage , salidroside was mainly hydrolyzed to tyrosol , and acteoside was hydrolyzed to verbasoside and caffeic acid .
acteoside also could isomerize into isoacteoside , cyclize to oraposide , and oxidize to campneoside ii , beta - oxoacteoside , etc .
the degradation attenuated the anti - hypoxia ability of phgs , though caffeic acid could slightly increase the anti - hypoxia ability of degraded acteoside .
it is necessary to use some methods to increase the stability of phgs in the further study .

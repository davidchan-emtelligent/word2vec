here we wanted to investigate predictive value of neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) and platelet / lymphocyte ratio ( plr ) in the diagnosis of brucellosis .
thirty - two brucellosis patients diagnosed with positive serum agglutination test and thirty - two randomized healthy subjects were enrolled in this study retrospectively .
result with roc analyzes the baseline nlr and hemoglobin values were found to be significantly associated with brucellosis ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.01 , resp. ) .
herein we demonstrated for the first time that nlr values were significantly associated with brucellosis .
this situation can help clinicians during diagnosis of brucellosis .
1. introduction brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that is transmittable to humans from infected animal reservoirs especially from milk and milk products [ 1 ] .
brucellosis may present with a broad spectrum of unspecific clinical manifestations , for example , fever , chills , sweating , malaise , arthralgia , weakness , back pain , and headache [ 2 ] .
many organ systems may be involved and it can be severe like endocarditis [ 3 ] .
most commonly serum agglutination test is used for diagnosis of brucellosis and its result conforms with complement fixation or coombs' test [ 4 ] .
in the diagnosis of brucellosis the gold standard test is culture of brucellosis [ 5 ] .
which patients must we suspect for brucellosis ?
in our clinic we suspect feverish patients with a history of milk and milk products intake .
laboratory and clinic findings are unclear in brucellosis patients .
because brucellosis patients show unspecific symptoms and unspecific laboratory findings , we aimed to investigate predictive contribution value of neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) and platelet / lymphocyte ratio ( plr ) in diagnosis of brucellosis .
2. methods and statistics we collected clinical and laboratory data of thirty - two patients with brucellosis diagnosed with serum agglutination test and randomized thirty - two healthy people 's data from hospital records retrospectively .
we collected patients' blood samples at the admission and then we analyzed laboratory parameters that consist of haematological , biochemical , and serological tests .
the white blood cell ( wbc ) and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were recorded and nlr and plr were calculated from these parameters .
the cut - off titer value for serum agglutination test was 1 / 160 in diagnosis of brucellosis .
we compare haematological parameters that consist of nlr and plr between two groups .
all analyses were performed using spss for windows ( version 21.0 ; spss / ibm , chicago , il ) .
student 's t - test , pearson 's chi - squared test , and logistic regression test were used when suitable .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
3. results the mean age of brucellosis patients was 41,7 +/ - 16,1 .
62,5 % of patients were male and 37,5 % female , respectively .
the most common brucellosis symptoms at the time of diagnosis were fatigue ( 37,5 %) , anorexia ( 34,4 %) , joint pain ( 34,4 %) , myalgia ( 31,3 %) , fever ( 25 %) , chills ( 18,8 %) , and feeling cold ( 18.8 %) , respectively ( table 1 ) .
we compare haematological parameters that consist of nlr and plr between brucellosis patients and healthy groups .
result with roc analyzes the baseline nlr and hemoglobin values were found to be significantly associated with brucellosis ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.01 , resp . )
( table 2 ) .
there were no observed significant correlations with result of fisher 's exact test for nlr and hemoglobin values ( table 3 ) .
result with student 's t - test , the plr , neutrophil , lymphocyte , platelet count , wbc mean values was not significantly different between two groups ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 4 ) .
4. discussion we know that laboratory parameters and clinical symptoms are unspecific in brucellosis .
high nlr values were found in inflammatory processes compared to noninflammatory processes in the literature [ 6 - 8 ] .
nlr has been investigated for many diseases [ 9 - 16 ] but there are few studies between nlr and infectious diseases and there is not any study between brucellosis and nlr .
therefore , we investigated predictive contribution value of nlr , plr , and the other haematological parameters in diagnosis of brucellosis .
we compare nlr , plr , and the other haematological parameters between brucellosis and healthy subjects .
result with roc analyzes the baseline nlr and hemoglobin values were found to be significantly associated with brucellosis ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.01 , resp. ) .
there were no observed significant correlations with result of fisher 's exact test for nlr and hemoglobin values ( p > 0.05 ) .
result with student 's t - test , the plr , neutrophil , lymphocyte , platelet count , wbc mean values was not significantly different between two groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
in a study conducted on patients with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis , iliaz et al. demonstrated that the nlr was higher in patients with tuberculosis compared to the patients with sarcoidosis [ 17 ] .
in a study conducted on patients with tuberculosis and bacterial community - acquired pneumonia , yoon et al. showed that nlr levels were significantly lower in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis than in patients with bacterial community - acquired pneumonia [ 18 ] .
in a study conducted on patients with behcet disease , rifaioglu et al. demonstrated that the nlr was higher in patients with active behcet disease compared to controls and those with inactive behcet disease [ 19 ] .
in a study conducted on patients with sjogren 's syndrome , which is a chronic inflammatory disease , nlr was found significantly higher compared to the control group [ 20 ] .
additionally , in many studies on coronary artery disease , which is also an inflammatory process , a positive correlation was found for the nlr [ 21 , 22 ] .
in the literature high nlr values were found in inflammatory processes compared to control .
in contrast with the literature data we found low nlr in brucellosis patients compared to control .
in our study we demonstrated for the first time that nlr values were significantly associated with brucellosis .
major limit of our study was the retrospective study that was considered .
single blood sampling was the other limitation of our study .
for these reasons new prospectively controlled and randomized trials with multiple blood sampling must be performed to confirm our results .
in spite of that we have suggested that low nlr may be useful data for brucellosis .

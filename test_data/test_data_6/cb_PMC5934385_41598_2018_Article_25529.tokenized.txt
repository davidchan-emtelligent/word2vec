it is well established that brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder ( mdd ) and in therapeutic mechanisms of antidepressants .
we aim to identify genetic vairiants related to mdd susceptibility and antidepressant therapeutic response by using gene - based association analysis with genes related to the neurotrophic pathway .
the present study investigated the role of genetic variants in the 10 neurotrophic - related genes ( bdnf , ngfr , ntrk2 , mtor , vegfa , s100a10 , serpine1 , arhgap33 , gsk3b , creb1 ) in mdd susceptibility through a case - control ( 455 mdd patients and 2,998 healthy controls ) study and in antidepressant efficacy ( n = 455 ) .
measures of antidepressant therapeutic efficacy were evaluated using the 21 - item hamilton rating scale for depression .
our single - marker and gene - based analyses with ten genes related to the neurotrophic pathway identified 6 polymorphisms that reached a significant level ( p - value < 5.0 x 10 - 3 ) in both meta - and mega - analyses in antidepressant therapeutic response .
one polymorphism was mapped to bdnf and 5 other polymorphisms were mapped to vegfa .
for case - control association study , we found that all of these reported polymorphisms and genes did not reach a suggestive level .
the present study supported a role of bdnf and vegfa variants in mdd therapeutic response .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction depression is a severe mental disorder and the leading cause of disabilities worldwide1 .
the reported prevalence throughout the world of depressive episodes is 1,607 per 100,000 per year for males and 2,552 per 100,000 per year for females2 .
currently , the main medical treatment for depression is antidepressant medication .
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) , including fluoxetine , sertraline , fluvoxamine , paroxetine and citalopram , are a popular family of antidepressants frequently prescribed at present .
however , as with all antidepressant treatments , about 30 - 40 % of major depressive disorder ( mdd ) patients do not respond sufficiently to ssris3 .
as evidence from earlier studies had indicated , genetic factors may play important roles in antidepressant responses4,5 , and pharmacogenetic ssri studies have attempted to identify genetic variants which predict antidepressant treatment response .
pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to heredity , generally focusing on polymorphisms of genes related to the drug metabolizing - enzyme , drug action or disease pathophysiology6 .
for candidate genes related to antidepressant therapeutic action , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) has been a main focus of antidepressant pharmacogenetic research .
bdnf , a member of the neurotrophin family , is a small dimeric protein widely expressed in adult mammalian brains with the highest levels found in the hippocampus7 .
bdnf plays a key role in the regulation of neuronal survival , differentiation , growth , and apoptosis by binding to two types of receptors ; namely , tyrosine kinase b ( trkb ; encoded by the ntrk2 gene ) receptor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75ntr ; encoded by the ngfr gene ) .
earlier animal studies have demonstrated that stress of immobilization can lower bdnf mrna levels in the hippocampus and other brain regions8 .
the role of bdnf in depression treatments was first revealed in research conducted by nibuya and colleagues , where long - term administration of several types of antidepressants , including ssris , increases in bdnf expression in the rat hippocampus9 .
furthermore , centrally administered bdnf produces antidepressant - like activities in animal models of depression10 .
in humans , post - mortem studies demonstrated an increase in bdnf immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of mdd subjects treated with antidepressant medication at the time of death , compared with untreated controls11 .
many clinical studies also found that bdnf levels were significantly lower in mdd patients than in controls , and decreased serum levels of bdnf in mdd patients recovered to normal levels associated with the recovery of depression after treatment with antidepressant medication12 .
the above findings suggest that bdnf may be implicated in the pathogenesis of mdd and in antidepressant actions13 , and may be a good candidate gene for antidepressant pharmacogenetic study .
the human bdnf gene has been mapped to chromosome 11p13 .
a common single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) consisting of a missense change ( g196a ) , producing a non - conservative amino acid change ( valine to methionine ) , has been identified in the coding exon of the bdnf gene at position 66 ( val66met , rs6265 ) .
the replacement of 66val by 66met disrupts cellular processing , trafficking , and activity - dependent secretion of bdnf14 .
in our 2003 study on 110 mdd patients , we examined the association between the bdnf val66met polymorphism and response to 4 - week antidepressant ( fluoxetine ) treatment15 .
we found a trend showing better therapeutic response for the val / met - heterozygote patients in comparison to those bearing the homozygote ( val / val or met / met ) .
while similar findings have been reported in some of the subsequent studies , other studies found a better response in patients carrying the met variant16,17. with the importance of bdnf in antidepressant therapeutic mechanism , bdnf gene has been the focus of antidepressant pharmacogenetic studies .
most of the bdnf - antidepressant pharmacogenetic studies investigated only the bdnf val66met polymorphism which may overlook other bdnf polymorphisms .
furthermore , a single gene may play only a small part in the antidepressant therapeutic response .
genes related to the bdnf function may interact with bdnf in response to antidepressant treatment .
several genes related to neurotrophic pathway have also been implicated in the mechanisms underlying depression and drug action .
for example , we have demonstrated that the ntrk2 genetic variants interact with the bdnf val66met polymorphism contributing to the risk of geriatric depression18 .
one missense ngfr polymorphism ( s250l ) showed association with antidepressant therapeutic response19.we found that polymorphisms in the gsk3b gene ( encoding glycogen synthase kinase - 3 beta protein ) , an important component in the bdnf pathway , were associated with the antidepressant therapeutic response20 .
we also found that genetic variants in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene ( encoded by the serpine1 gene ) , which is involved in the cleavage of pro - bdnf to mature bdnf in the brain , are related to antidepressant therapeutic response and depression susceptibility20 .
vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) is known to play a role in the process for neuroprotection and neurogenesis , and may be involved in the pathogenesis of some neurological disorders21 .
vegf is encoded by vegfa .
s100 calcium - binding protein a10 ( protein encoded by the s100a10 ) , also known as p11 , has a possible role in major depression 's pathophysiology22 and may also be involved in the cleavage of probdnf to bdnf23 .
arhgap33 is a new type of regulator for the intracellular trafficking of trkb signaling and is essential for synapse development .
dysfunction of this mechanism may be a new molecular pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders24 .
creb protein ( encoded by creb1 ) , a cellular transcription factor , plays a crucial role in turning on the bdnf gene25 .
mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor protein encoded by mtor ) , a large serine / threonine kinase , regulates the initiation of protein translation in the body .
a clinical study has found that ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in depressive patients26 .
an animal study demonstrated that ketamine stimulates ampa receptor transmission and activates bdnf / trkb - akt / erk - mtor signaling cascades , leading to a sustained increase in synaptic protein synthesis and strengthening of synaptic plasticity27 .
pharmacogenomics , which is derived from genome - wide association ( gwa ) studies and pharmacogenetics , are proving to be increasingly useful in personalized medicinal research .
despite the progress from single snp studies to gwa studies in antidepressant treatment response , results were not as expected as they were often inconsistent28 .
gwa studies have a much lower power when the number of snps increases and the snps are correlated , especially when their effect sizes are small29 .
gene - based analysis is the snp - based method , in which each snp is tested for association , and multiple testing corrections based on the bonferroni procedure are applied to control the type - i error rate .
the concept of a gene - based association test has been broadly applied to pharmacogenomics studies30 .
the most important merit of snp / gene - based analysis for pharmacogenomic studies over gwa studies is that we can target the genotyping of snps / genes efficiently provided the mechanisms of drug action are known .
these selected snps / genes are connected with treatment responses , which can help in predicting the progress of a disease and use to the selection of targeted therapies in pharmacogenetic studies31 .
the strategy of snp / gene - based analysis for pharmacogenetic studies provides clinicians to better use of knowledge of a list of genetic susceptible loci to link candidate genes and clinical drug related responses in order to make a rational treatment decision32 .
in this study , we conducted gene - based as well as single marker analyses in 10 genes related to the bdnf signaling pathway to identify genetic variation that may affect mdd risk or antidepressant therapeutic response .
materials and methods samples we recruited 455 patients , 268 from nhri ( the national health research institutes ) and 187 from tvgh ( taipei veterans general hospital ) , who met dsm - iv criteria for major depressive disorder .
the diagnosis was made by board - certified psychiatrists who interviewed patients and family members , and obtained records where possible .
all subjects were taiwanese .
subjects were part of the international ssri pharmacogenomics consortium ( ispc ) project , which included seven member sites from five countries33 .
other inclusion criteria were minimum baseline score of 14 on the 21 - item hamilton rating scale for depression ( hrsd ) , and presence of depressive symptoms for at least two weeks before entry into the study without antidepressant treatment during that period ( patients were fresh cases or had quit antidepressants for more than 2 weeks ) .
exclusion criteria were additional current dsm - iv axis i diagnoses ( including substance abuse , generalized anxiety disorders , panic disorders , or obsessive compulsive disorders ) , personality disorders , pregnancy , recent suicide attempt , and major medical and / or neurological disorders .
these patients were treated with ssris , which include escitalopram ( 38.5 %) , paroxetine ( 38.5 %) , fluoxetine ( 18.3 %) and citalopram ( 4.8 %) .
treatment was initiated with a recommended starting dose ( for example , the escitalopram dose was 10 mg / day in the beginning ) , and based on the clinical response after 2 - week treatment the investigator could adjust the antidepressant dosage .
the final mean antidepressant doses were 12.0 mg / day for escitalopram , 16.9 mg / day for paroxetine , 20.0 mg / day for fluoxetine and 19.0 mg / day for citalopram .
all participants were evaluated using the 21 - item hrsd to measure depression severity .
patients were assessed repeatedly at baseline and week 2 , 4 , and 8 .
all raters for the hrsd received the same investigators' training module .
for the evaluation of the nhri subjects , the inter - rater reliability coefficient was consistent , with a value of 0.9 .
the tvgh patients were evaluated by a senior psychiatrist ( ywy ) .
healthy controls were drawn from the taiwan biobank with a taiwanese han ancestry34 , consisted of 2,998 participants in the current study ( nearly equal proportions of males and females ) , whom were interviewed by trained interviewers with standard questionnaires to collect information of demographic variables , life - style and physical health conditions as well as clinical data .
all controls were found to have no definite diagnosis of any major medical or mental illnesses , they underwent genotyping at the genome - wide level and were thus treated as controls in the current study .
experiments were conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of taipei veterans general hospital ( vghirb no. : 2014 - 06 - 001b ) .
written informed consents were obtained from all participants ensuring adequate understanding of the study .
measurement we used four repeated phenotypes to measure different treatment responses , including remitted , response , and stem - depressed .
first , we calculated the sum score of 21 - item hrsd at week 8 , and recoded as 1 if the sum score greater than 7 and 2 ( i.e. , remitted ) otherwise .
second , we calculated the percentage change of hrsd ( i.e. , % deltahrsd ) , and recoded the results as 1 if the percentage change greater than - 50 % and 2 ( i.e. , response ) otherwise .
third , we also used the percentage change of hrsd as a treatment - response index .
last , we used the score of ' depressed mood ' item to measure depression , and recoded the results as 1 if the score greater than or equal to 3 and 2 ( i.e. , stem - depressed ) otherwise .
for detailed definitions of treatment - response phenotypes , please refer to lin et al.35 .
genotyping data and quality controls all participants were genotyped using illumina humanomniexpressexome beadchips in the international ssri pharmacogenomics consortium .
a total of 455 subjects were genotyped with 951,123 snps .
we selected 10 ssris treatment - responses or depression related candidate genes ( bdnf , ngfr , ntrk2 , mtor , vegfa , s100a10 , serpine1 , arhgap33 , gsk3b , creb1 ) , which are related to the neurotrophic pathway .
a total of 1,251 and 2,656 snps were mapped into the 10 selected candidate genes in mega - and meta - analysis , respectively .
quality control procedures were done firstly with each individual , including sample quality , kinship and population stratification .
we first check plate - wise genotyping biases .
samples with plate pass rate greater than 97 % were retained in the analysis .
a total of 18 samples ( 11 from nhri and 7 from tvgh ) were removed during this step .
second , we checked the inbreeding coefficient and identity by state ( ibs ) , so that samples with strong kinship were eliminated .
in total , 9 individuals ( 4 from nhri and 5 from tvgh ) were removed from the samples due to having similar measures which are far away from the clustering .
third , we used a multidimensional scaling analysis on the genome - wide ibs pairwise distance to eliminate samples with outliers .
our results showed that none was away from the clustering on the scatter plot .
finally , 7 patients treated with sertraline ( ssri ) and venlafaxine ( snri ) were excluded from the analysis .
as a result , 421 ( mean age of 43.7 years and 71.3 % of females ) mdd patients were retained .
we also performed quality control procedures for markers .
we removed markers which failed the hardy - weinberg tests with a p - value less than 0.0001 , genotype missing rate greater than 5 % , minor allele frequency ( maf ) smaller than 0.05 , or ones with bad calling in clustering .
as a result , a total of 647,030 snps in the samples were retained for imputation .
the genotyping call rate was 99.9 % for all subjects .
imputation and gene mapping imputation was carried out using impute2 v336 , with haplotype reference panels released in march / april 2012 from the 1000 genomes project on the basis of hapmap build 37 ( https :// mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk / impute / data _ download _ 1000g _ phase1 _ integrated _ shapeit2.html ) .
only imputed snps with high genotype information content ( i.e. impute info score > 0.5 ) were used in association analyses .
in total , 30,040,257 snps were imputed with high confidence for each individual in the samples .
following the same quality control procedures for markers , a total of 4,241,701 snps were retained for analyses .
gene - mapping was conducted using 50 kb upstream and downstream of the gene boundaries .
multiple imputation method for missing phenotypic data to deal with the issue of missing data , we used multiple imputation approach to account uncertainty of the imputed data .
we first created multiple - imputed datasets , by fitting regression models based on observed complete data from other variables to predict missing data multiple times ( number of iterations was set to 30 by default ) to account for uncertainty .
second , we performed standard statistical analyses on each of imputed datasets .
third , we pooled the results of each of these analyses to produce one set of results .
the method of multiple imputation overcame the limitations of single imputation ( e.g. locf ) to provide more realistically estimated precision and less biased results .
this approach is beneficial with several advantages , including unbiased parameter estimates , robust departures from normality assumptions , adequate results when sample size is small or high rates of missing data , computationally simple , and tractable solution to missing data problems .
genetic association analyses we performed single - marker association and gene - based association tests for treatment - response phenotypes .
both linear and logistic regression analysis were conducted with additive genetic model .
all models were adjusted for gender and age to correct for different distributions in gender and age across treatment - response phenotypes in mdd patients .
gene - based association analyses were conducted to obtain gene - level empirically significant estimations .
information from a set of snps ( association p - value < 0.1 by default ) within a gene was aggregated .
to account for the linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) among markers , only snps having r2 < 0.5 with each other were retained for each gene .
we also fitted both linear and logistic regression models to perform gene - based association tests .
empirical p - values were calculated with 50,000 permutations .
to combine individual association results ( i.e. p - values ) from the two samples ( i.e. , nhri and tvgh ) , meta - analysis was applied using the inverse gamma model with a shape parameter ( alpha ) of 1 , that is , the fisher 's method37 to summarize association information across the two samples .
alternatively , we conducted association analyses to an integrated database of nhri and tvgh .
we adopted a method of ld adjusted multiple testing correction developed by duggal et al.38 to account for the interdependence among snps to balance between false - negative and false - positive findings .
only snps and genes with p - values less than 5.0 x 10 - 4 ( or 5.0 x 10 - 3 ) and 5.0 x 10 - 2 ( or 1.0 x 10 - 2 ) , either in mega - analysis or in meta - analysis , were considered to be significant ( or suggestive ) , and were reported in single - marker association analysis and gene - based association analysis , respectively .
additionally , we conducted a case - control ( 455 mdd patients and 2,998 healthy controls ) study using snp - based and gene - based association analyses to investigate whether the treatment - response associated loci were also mdd susceptible loci .
all aforementioned analyses were conducted with r version 3.0.2 , plink version 1 .
90b3.37 64 - bit , and haploview version 4.1 .
additionally , to explore the potential roles of these six snps as expression quantitative trait locus ( eqtl ) , we used haploreg ( http :// compbio.mit.edu / haploreg ) to search gene regulation databases .
results among 428 subjects , 394 ( 92.06 %) cases were observed at all four time points ; 30 cases ( 7.02 %) were missing at just one time - point of follow - up ; and the remaining 4 cases ( 0.92 %) were missing at two or more time - points of follow - up. table 1 exhibits detailed patterns of missing data in phenotypes across different time points , indicating the issue of incomplete data .
here we conducted multiple imputation method to impute these missing data using available observed data , such that our data are complete .
furthermore , we excluded 7 subjects ( 4 treated with sertraline and 3 with venlafaxine ) from the analysis .
as a result , 421 mdd patients were retained for the following analyses .
table 2 represents summary statistics for treatment - response phenotypes .
all three treatment - response phenotypes ( remitted , response , and stem - depressed ) showed significant difference ( p - value < 2.2 x 10 - 16 ) between treatment responders and treatment non - responders .
we found that 373 ( 88.6 %) treatment - responders had moderate or less depressed mood compared to 48 ( 11.4 %) treatment non - responders who had moderately severe or severe depressed mood .
no gender difference was observed among all treatment - response phenotypes .

bdifference tests were conducted using student t - test ( for continuous data ) or chi - square test ( for categorical data ) .
in single - marker association analyses , 64 snps with odds ratios ( ors ) ranged from 0.18 to 2.88 in nhri samples and ranged from 0.19 to 4.22 in tvgh samples ( 0.92 - 1.99 in combined samples ) were reported to have suggestive signals with treatment - response phenotypes , which reached p - value < 5.0 x 10 - 3 either in mega - analysis or in meta - analysis ( table 3 ) .
among them , only six snps reached significant levels ( p - value < 5.0 x 10 - 3 ) in both meta - analysis and mega - analysis .
one snp , chr11:27682769 : d ( mapped to bdnf ) was significantly associated with remitted ( score ) ( please see figs 1 and 2 for their manhattan plot of meta - analysis and mega - analysis ) , and 5 snps ( rs6920449 , rs1535507 , rs833051 , rs833052 , and rs2148252 ) , which were mapped to vegfa , were significantly associated with response (% deltahrsd , continuous ) ( please see figs 3 and 4 for their manhattan plot of meta - analysis and mega - analysis ) .
other 58 snps were significantly associated with treatment - response phenotypes in either meta - analysis or mega - analysis .
results of gene - based association analyses are listed in table 4 .
only bdnf gene in remitted ( score ) and vegfa gene in response (% deltahrsd , binary and continuous ) showed suggestive signals ( p - values < 5.0 x 10 - 2 ) in mega - analysis and / or meta - analysis .
these indicated that the possible mechanisms of association may be due to the neurotrophic pathway and serotonin system pathway .
furthermore , the most studied polymorphism val66met ( rs6265 ) in bdnf is included in particular and the results of single - marker association and gene - based association were non - suggestive .

discussion the major finding is that 64 snps were reported to have suggestive signals with treatment - response phenotypes either in mega - analysis or in meta - analysis .
among them , 6 snps reached a significant level ( p - value < 5.0 x 10 - 3 ) in both meta - analysis and mega - analysis .
the genetic association directions of the 6 snps are the same in both study groups .
the other 58 snps were significantly associated with treatment - response phenotypes in either meta - analysis or mega - analysis .
further , among the 10 genes tested , bdnf gene ( in remitted ) and vegfa gene ( in response ) were suggestive markers for treatment - response phenotypes using samples from nhri , tvgh , and the combined .
bdnf is essential for the mechanism of pharmacological therapies currently used to treat mdd39,40 .
both bdnf mrna and protein expressions are increased after long - term medication with antidepressants , including ssris , in the hippocampus in animal models9,41 .
moreover , infusion of bdnf into the dentate gyrus of hippocampus produced antidepressant - like behaviors42 .
in support of these findings , a recent study demonstrated that knockdown of trkb , but not bdnf , in the dorsal raphe nucleus of mice results in loss of antidepressant efficacy43 .
recent meta - analyses showed strong evidence that peripheral bdnf levels were lower in mdd subjects than healthy control subjects , and bdnf levels significantly increased after antidepressant treatment12,41. from the above findings , bdnf has been tested in many antidepressant pharmacogenetic studies , especially the functional bdnf val66met polymorphism16,44 .
however , most studies showed no association between this polymorphism and antidepressant response16 .
meta - analysis of seven studies and the star * d data including a total of 3,128 subjects showed that the bdnf val66met polymorphism was not significantly associated with antidepressant therapeutic response45 .
in this study we found no association between this bdnf val66met polymorphism and ssri therapeutic response .
however , we found one snp , chr11:27682769 : d ( mapped to bdnf ) , to be significantly associated with the remitted ( score ) .
this snp had ors that were in the same direction in nhri samples and tvgh samples , and our results of meta - analysis and mega - analysis suggested a statistically significant association between this snp and the remitted .
there was no eqtl effect for this snp .
it is still not clear how the mechanism of the chr11:27682769 : d snp is related to the ssri therapeutic mechanism .
further studies are required to explore the functions of this bdnf snp .
the other 5 snps ( rs6920449 , rs1535507 , rs833051 , rs833052 , and rs2148252 ) , which were significantly associated with ssri therapeutic response , were mapped to vegfa .
vegf is a member of growth factor family and has been implicated in neurotrophy and neurogenesis , which plays a pivotal role in brain development46 .
an animal study found that antidepressant drugs were shown to induce hippocampal expression of vegf and that vegf signaling through the flk - 1 receptor is required for antidepressant - induced cell proliferation47 .
in addition , the same research group demonstrated that infusions of inhibitors of vegf - flk - 1 receptor signaling blocks the antidepressant - like activity of fluoxetine47 .
study involving 30 mdd patients found that plasma vegf levels significantly increased its association with clinical response with antidepressant48. with the significant role of vegf in antidepressant action , we have tested 7 vegfa polymorphisms and ssri antidepressant response in 351 mdd patients49 .
no significant association with ssri antidepressant therapeutic effect was shown in the alleles and genotypes of single loci , or haplotypes constructed from these polymorphisms .
in this study , we also found no significant association between the 5 vegfa snps and ssri antidepressant response in both snp - based and haplotype - based ( data not shown ) analyses using binary outcome ( i.e. , dichotomized % deltahrsd ) , which is similar to the 7 vegfa polymorphisms reported in our previous study .
however , the 5 vegfa snps found to be associated with ssri antidepressant response using continuous outcome ( i.e. , % deltahrsd ) were different from the 7 vegfa polymorphisms reported in our previous study , suggesting its simplicity of dichotomizing continuous variables gained at some cost ( i.e. , some of the information lost ) in pharmacogenetic research .
one benefit of using high - density imputed snp mapping of antidepressant candidate genes is that some potentially significant signals for antidepressant treatment response could not be missed in pharmacogenetic studies .
we used haploreg to predict a possible functional role of these 5 vegfa snps .
we found that 4 snps ( rs1535507 , rs833051 , rs833052 , and rs2148252 ) exhibited direct eqtl effects. of note , functional annotation by haploreg indicated that transcriptional regulation activity exists at the rs1535507 , rs833052 , and rs2148252 loci for the vegfa gene in blood tissue and / or dendritic cells .
their functional impacts in antidepressant mechanism still need to be elucidated by further experimental studies .
neurotrophic factors comprise major regulatory mechanisms controlling normal brain plasticity and neurogenesis .
dysfunctions of these systems form the basis for development of mdd50 .
for case - control association study using samples from nhri and tvgh ( 421 mdd patients ) and hccgb ( 2,998 healthy controls ) , all these reported snps and genes did not reach significant level .
this suggested that these tested snps and genes related to the neurotrophic pathway were not associated with mdd susceptibility .
mdd is a complex mental disorder with a partly genetic etiology and each risk genetic locus confers relatively small increments in risk51 .
the negative association finding could be due to our sample size which lacks the statistical power to detect common variants of mdd susceptibility .
the major limitation of this study is the lack of a placebo lead - in design .
it is well known that the placebo response plays an important role in antidepressant therapeutic response52 .
the second limitation of this study is that some potential confounding factors , such as side effects , incompliance or drop - out , were not under consideration , which might disturb the analysis in detecting a difference between the two treatment response groups .
the third limitation is that our inclusion criterion for hrsd minimum score is 14 , which is lower than other studies .
finally , plasma levels of antidepressants were not analyzed .
poor antidepressant response may result from sub - therapeutic plasma drug concentrations53 .
in conclusion , our gene - based association identifies loci in bdnf and vegfa as potential genetic predictors for ssri therapeutic response in mdd patients .
future studies are needed to delineate the precise mechanism by which these genetic variants may influence antidepressant therapeutic response .

aims the effect of carotid endarterectomy on the patency of the external carotid artery is unknown .
we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the long - term changes in the external carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy .
methods data was prospectively recorded for all patients who had carotid endarterectomy between 1997 and 2006 in our vascular surgical unit .
these patients had follow - up with carotid duplex ultrasound to assess the patency of the internal and external carotid artery .
the data were retrieved and evaluated for patency and flow characteristic in both arteries before and after surgery .
results carotid endarterectomy was performed on 255 occasions in 236 patients over the ten year study period .
immediate and long - term outcome of carotid endarterectomy is comparable to results at other major centers .
stenosis of the external carotid artery as detected by duplex scan occurred in 5.5 % of patients and was totally asymptomatic .
conclusion our results of carotid endarterectomy are comparable to other centers .
long - term follow up of the external carotid artery with duplex scan showed asymptomatic stenosis in a small percentage of patients .
background during carotid endarterectomy , surgeons often perform avulsion endarterectomy to the external carotid artery .
there is limited data supporting the routine use of this technique .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the long term anatomical changes that occur to the external carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy [ 1 ] .
trans - catheter embolization and ligation the external carotid artery is often undertaken to cut the blood supply of large hypervascular tumours , and for bleeding in severe epistaxis and trauma [ 2 ] .
this procedure is safely performed with no ischaemic consequences to tissues in the head and neck region .
previously some surgeons routinely performed endarterectomy of the external carotid artery during carotid surgery .
however lack of data to support the necessity of that prompted vascular surgeons to do only limited external carotid endarterectomy regardless of its degree of stenosis [ 1 ] .
the anastomosis between the middle meningeal artery ( a branch from the maxillary artery ) and the ophthalmic artery is a well described anatomic feature but the incidence is not known [ 3 - 5 ] .
in rare cases , the main contribution to the ophthalmic circulation is from the middle meningeal artery .
this variation in origin of the ophthalmic artery can result in catastrophic consequence following occlusion of the external carotid artery [ 4 ] .
pathologic changes in the external carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy are not well studied .
ascer et al [ 5 ] reported data on 114 carotid endarterectomies and concluded that avoiding external carotid endarterectomy during standard carotid endarterectomy does not result in significant progression of external carotid artery stenosis or occlusion .
methods the hospital electronic data system was searched for patients who had carotid endarterectomy between january 1997 and december 2006 .
patients were included if they had carotid endarterectomy performed for symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis that was more than 70 % .
prospectively recorded data was reviewed retrospectively about these patients and included demographic details , presenting symptoms , duplex ultrasound scan , surgery outcome , complications , and the presence of contralateral carotid artery disease .
all patients were followed up with duplex ultrasound imaging at regular intervals to monitor the patency and flow characteristics of blood flow in the internal carotid artery , common carotid and external carotid arteries .
the duplex ultrasound was usually performed at 6 weeks following surgery , and then at three monthly intervals for a year and six monthly intervals for up to five years .
the occurrence of stroke or transient ischaemic attack during follow up was recorded from the hospital data system .
procedure internal carotid endarterectomy was performed in symptomatic patients who had severe carotid artery stenosis (>= 70 % stenosis involving the carotid artery bifurcation ) .
this was established by duplex ultrasound imaging .
none of the external carotids had stenosis before surgery .
preoperative cardiac risk was assessed , and cardiac investigations undertaken as appropriate .
operative procedures were performed under general anaesthesia .
symptomatic patients who had recurrent transient ischaemic attacks were treated with heparin preoperatively .
prior to carotid clamping , all patients were given a therapeutic dose of heparin ( 100 unit per kg body weight ) .
all carotid endarterectomies were performed by longitudinal arteriotomy through the common and internal carotid arteries .
selective carotid shunting was used in patients who had an internal carotid artery back - flow pressure of less than 60 mmhg .
temporary shunt was also used for patients who had recently had a stroke .
the arteriotomy was closed primarily or with synthetic patch angioplasty .
anticoagulation was generally not reversed with protamine .
patients were continued on aspirin in the immediate postoperative period .
results there were 255 carotid endarterectomies on 236 patients ( 143 males ) .
the median age was 72 years ( range 52 - 92 ) .
median hospital stay was 3 days .
mean follow up with duplex ultrasound scan 3 years ( 95 % confidence interval 2.7 - 3.3 ) .
one patient died in hospital due to postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage , which was preceded by hypertension .
hypertension that required intravenous vasodilator in the intensive care unit was seen in 30 patients ( 12 %) ; one of these patients had severe confusion , and another had grand mal seizures .
acute myocardial infarction ( defined as raised cardiac troponin with or without ecg changes ) complicated 11 ( 4.3 %) operations ; two of these patients developed atrial fibrillation and one developed acute left ventricular failure .
three patients had to return to theatre after developing neurological symptoms ; two were found to have occluded internal carotid arteries , whilst the third had patent endarterectomy site .
all three had minimal residual disability .
temporary dysfunction of the hypoglossal nerve ( that usually manifested as dysarthria ) occurred in seven ( 2.7 %) patients .
three patient had injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve , of which two patients made full recovery ( table 1 ) .
table 1 complications of carotid endarterectomy ( 255 procedures ) complication number percentage death 1 0.4 % stroke 3 1.2 % tia 7 2.7 % myocardial infarction 11 4.3 % hypertension 30 11.7 % recurrence of stenosis 30 11.7 % hypoglossal nerve damage 7 2.7 % recurrent laryngeal nerve damage 1 0.4 % duplex ultrasound imaging of the external carotid artery showed new stenosis (> 50 %) in 14 patients ( 5.5 %) .
stenosis was considered moderate if there was 50 - 69 % reduction of the cross sectional area and severe when there was 70 % or more reduction of the cross sectional area .
the stenosis was 50 - 69 % in five patients and more than 70 % in nine patients ; five of these had total occlusion of the external carotid artery .
the mean time for the progression to stenosis of 50 % or more was 9 months ( median time was 9 months ; quartile range 6 and 15 months ) .
none of these patients reported any symptoms of ischaemia or ophthalmic symptoms ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 ( stenosis of the external carotid artery , mean and 95 % confidence intervals ) .
restenosis (> 50 % narrowing of the lumen ) of the internal carotid artery occurred in 30 patients ( 11.7 %) , of which five were completely occluded .
median time for restenosis in the internal carotid artery was 15 months ( quartile range 6 and 18 months ) .
seven of those recurrences were symptomatic ( five had transient ischaemic attacks and 2 had strokes ) and three patients required carotid stenting .
dilatation of the internal carotid artery was seen in two patients and was asymptomatic ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 ( stenosis of the internal carotid artery , mean and 95 % confidence intervals ) .
discussion the results of carotid endarterectomy at our urban community hospital are comparable with reports from other western countries specialized vascular units [ 7,8 ] .
the mortality and stroke rates is low at 0.4 % 1.2 % respectively .
external carotid artery stenosis was asymptomatic ; the frequency of this is comparable to the few other published studies [ 1,6,7 ] .
carotid endarterectomy remains a low - risk operation for the treatment of severe symptomatic carotid disease , with excellent long - term results and durability [ 9 - 11 ] .
the rate of cranial nerve injury remains low and is comparable to other studies [ 10 ] .
we had 11.7 % recurrence of stenosis , which is comparable to other studies ; however , those studies had shorter follow - up of 1 - 2 years and demonstrated rates of re - stenosis of 4 % - 14 % [ 12 - 14 ] .
archie et al [ 14 ] reported 9 % of patients had severe (> 70 %) stenosis of the external carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy ; and found that the repair of severely stenosed or occluded external carotid artery identified during carotid endarterectomy had a poor outcome , and suggested that technique and management of the external carotid artery during routine carotid endarterectomy needs further investigation and modification .
occlusion of the external carotid artery is known to occur after carotid endarterectomy and is usually without consequences .
in some individuals , however , the external carotid artery is the primary source of arterial blood flow to the eye via the middle meningeal artery [ 15,16 ] .
authors have therefore suggested that surgeons should avoid causing external carotid artery occlusion , by meticulously removing not only the ica plaque , but also the entire external carotid artery plaque [ 17 ] .
ocular ischaemic syndrome is also known to occur in patients with bilateral occlusion of the external carotid arteries even in the presence of a patent common and internal carotid arteries .
unilateral ocular ischaemic symptoms can follow consecutive bilateral carotid endarterectomies .
it can also be exacerbated after ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy in the setting of pre - existing contralateral external carotid artery occlusion .
ricco et al described performing intraoperative completion arteriography following 605 carotid endarterectomies .
this study demonstratedn stenosis in 114 cases ; including 17 involved the internal carotid artery and 73 involving the external carotid artery [ 18 ] .
ascher et al described major technical defects using intraoperative duplex scanning (> 30 % luminal internal carotid artery stenosis , free - floating clot , dissection , arterial disruption with pseudo - aneurysm ) were repaired .
no clinically detectable postoperative thromboembolic events occurred in this series of 605 endarterectomies [ 8 ] .
no similar data were available on the external carotid artery .
in conclusion this retrospective report shows carotid endarterectomy results in stenosis of the external carotid artery in a small proportion of patients , but this stenosis was totally asymptomatic .
competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

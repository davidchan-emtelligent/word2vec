background accurately monitoring adherence to treatment with recombinant human growth hormone ( r - hgh ) enables appropriate intervention in cases of poor adherence .
the electronic r - hgh auto - injector , easypod ( tm ) , automatically records the patient 's adherence to treatment .
this study evaluated adherence to treatment of children who started using the auto - injector and assessed opinions about the device .
methods a multicentre , multinational , observational 3 - month survey in which children received r - hgh as part of their normal care .
physicians reviewed the recorded dose history and children ( with or without parental assistance ) completed a questionnaire - based survey .
children missing <= 2 injections per month ( 92 % of injections given ) were considered adherent to treatment .
adherence was compared between gh treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children .
results of 834 recruited participants , 824 were evaluated .
the median ( range ) age was 11 ( 1 - 18 ) years. from the recorded dose history , 87.5 % of children were adherent to treatment over the 3 - month period .
recorded adherence was higher in treatment - naive ( 89.7 % , n = 445 / 496 ) than in treatment - experienced children ( 81.7 % , n = 152 / 186 ) [ fisher 's exact test fi ( x ) = 7.577 ; p = 0.0062 ] .
according to self - reported data , 90.2 % ( 607 / 673 ) of children were adherent over 3 months ; 51.5 % ( 421 / 817 ) missed >= 1 injection over this period ( mainly due to forgetfulness ) .
concordance between reported and recorded adherence was 84.3 % , with a trend towards self - reported adherence being higher than recorded adherence .
most children liked the auto - injector : over 80 % gave the top two responses from five options for ease of use ( 720 / 779 ) , speed ( 684 / 805 ) and comfort ( 716 / 804 ) .
although 38.5 % ( 300 / 780 ) of children reported pain on injection , over half of children ( 210 / 363 ) considered the pain to be less or much less than expected .
given the choice , 91.8 % ( 732 / 797 ) of children / parents would continue using the device .
conclusions easypod ( tm ) provides an accurate method of monitoring adherence to treatment with r - hgh .
in children who received treatment with r - hgh using easypod ( tm ) , short - term adherence is good , and significantly higher in treatment - naive children compared with experienced children .
children / parents rate the device highly .
the high level of acceptability of the device is reflected by a desire to continue using it by over 90 % of the children in the survey .
background recombinant human growth hormone ( r - hgh ) is used to treat growth hormone deficiency ( ghd ) in adults and short stature in children [ 1 - 3 ] .
treatment improves growth in children whose short stature is caused by ghd , or in those for whom short stature is associated with conditions such as turner syndrome ( ts ) , chronic renal failure ( crf ) or being born small for gestational age ( sga ) [ 1 ] .
early intervention with long - term r - hgh treatment improves adult stature , with some patients reaching target final height .
however , lack of adherence hampers growth potential [ 4,5 ] .
maintaining commitment to r - hgh treatment is difficult , as the short - term burden of injection administration is often more apparent than the long - term benefits of therapy [ 5 ] .
daily injections or needle - free administration is required , and treatment must be sustained over a prolonged period .
treatment fatigue may have a negative impact on adherence for patients taking r - hgh medication on a long - term basis , as suggested by the observation that chronicity of disease is a factor that influences adherence to therapy [ 6 ] .
studies looking at adherence to r - hgh treatment have been constrained by the problem of recording adherence , but results have shown that non - adherence is a problem in some patients [ 4 - 7 ] .
one uk study highlighted how frequent poor adherence with r - hgh therapy can be : more than 1 injection / week was missed by 39 % ( 29 / 75 ) of children , whilst 23 % ( 17 / 75 ) missed > 2 injections / week [ 5 ] .
the accurate monitoring of adherence rates is important as it enables poor adherence to be detected and acted upon [ 8 ] .
it can enable the physician to eliminate poor adherence as a reason for sub - optimal growth response and be more confident in their patient management decisions .
innovation in r - hgh delivery devices has sought to improve adherence by simplifying injection administration , making it less painful and more convenient , thereby improving patient acceptability of devices [ 9 - 12 ] .
the electronic auto - injector device , easypod ( tm ) , has a number of features , such as preset dosing , an electronic skin sensor and adjustable injection settings , designed to make daily administration of r - hgh easier , more comfortable and convenient ; it also allows accurate monitoring of treatment adherence [ 13 ] .
easypod ( tm ) has an injection log that automatically records injection history .
this information can be accessed by patients or downloaded at their clinic to show which injections , if any , have been missed .
although patient opinion of the electronic auto - injector has been previously studied , albeit in a limited number of patients ( n = 61 ) [ 14,15 ] , adherence to treatment whilst using this device has not been explored at all .
we report here the results from the first study of adherence to treatment as recorded by the auto - injector .
the primary objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to r - hgh therapy over 3 months of use .
in addition , the survey explored perceptions of the electronic auto - injector device in a large multinational cohort .
study outcomes were also assessed separately for children who were either new to or had experience with r - hgh therapy , in order to identify any differences in adherence to therapy or opinions of the device .
methods participants eligible children were aged <= 18 years and were either treatment - naive or already receiving gh treatment , but dissatisfied with their current self - injection device .
all children had conditions for which treatment with r - hgh ( saizen ( r ) , merck serono s.a .
- geneva , switzerland , an affiliate of merck kgaa , darmstadt , germany ) was indicated , based on local licensing ( ghd , ts , crf or sga ) .
children were excluded if they were currently participating in a therapeutic trial or had done so in the preceding 3 - month period .
children were also excluded at any point during the survey if they failed to bring their electronic auto - injector to a consultation .
recruitment took place in 206 centres , across 15 countries , specializing in the management of growth disorders in children .
study design this was a multicentre , multinational , observational study .
treatment with r - hgh was initiated in accordance with the registered dosage regimen for those new to treatment , or continued as usual for children already receiving this therapy .
no treatment changes were made .
similarly , no specific procedures , examinations or follow - up visits were required for the survey .
where applicable , according to local regulations , institutional approvals and appropriate consents were obtained .
the guardians of the children consented to the survey .
objectives the primary objective was to assess adherence to r - hgh treatment , following introduction of the electronic auto - injector , comparing adherence patterns of treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children .
the secondary objective was to assess the acceptability of the device .
outcome measures adherence to treatment was measured using data recorded by the injection device and reported via the survey .
for reported adherence , children or their parents completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to tick one of a selection of boxes to indicate how many doses they had missed during each month of the 3 - month period , and to give the main reason for missing doses .
recorded adherence data ( from the auto - injector ) were compared with reported adherence data ( from the survey ) .
acceptance of the electronic auto - injector device was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire administered by the nurse or investigator after 3 months of use ( table 1 ) .
children or their parents were asked to rate the device ( with respect to ease , speed , comfort of use , specific device features and future use ) using 5 - point scales or multiple - choice responses .
the survey was completed by the child or parent based on each family 's preference .
this information was not collected during the survey ; hence no psychometric properties of the survey were made available .

1silent 2quiet 3average 4quite noisy 5noisy statistical analysis sample size the sample size was based on the primary assessment criterion of treatment adherence ( the definition of treatment adherence used is given below ) and the objective was to demonstrate the equivalence between treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children in terms of treatment adherence .
however , as the type of patient ( treatment - naive or treatment - experienced ) recruited could not be controlled for , there was a bias towards a greater proportion of treatment - naive children .
it was therefore decided to perform the statistical analysis in a descriptive way .
data analysis adherence was evaluated over the 3 - month survey period as a whole and for each month separately to explore short - term changes in adherence .
the number of injections prescribed per week was taken into account in the calculation of adherence .
since adherence is expected to be high ( 80 - 95 % [ 6 ]) during the first 3 months of treatment , children were considered adherent to treatment if they received more than 92 % of the prescribed doses over a specified period ; i.e. a maximum of two daily injections missed per month or six daily injections for the 3 - month period .
three different imputations for missing data were used .
first , if the number of injections scheduled per week was not known , the most conservative case scenario ( i.e. seven scheduled injections per week ) was assumed .
second , when calculating percentage adherence using the ' number of missed injections' questionnaire box selected , the midpoint value for each tick box was imputed , i.e. when the tick box ' 1 - 3 injections missed ' was ticked , the value ' 2 ' was imputed .
third , for data related to the number of doses missed , the following imputation rule was applied : for respondents answering ' no ' to the question " did you miss at least one injection ?" , but not completing answers for the number of injections missed during each of the three 4 - week periods , it was assumed that the first answer was correct ( i.e. zero injections were missed ) .
furthermore , when information on the number of injections missed per 4 - week period was completely missing , imputation analyses were performed using data from completed periods .
analyses of parents' and children 's device acceptance were descriptive .
however , for the mean adherence values , 95 % confidence intervals were calculated .
the following statistical tests were performed : fisher 's exact test was used to compare adherence between treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children and the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare recorded adherence and reported adherence .
the significance level of the tests was set at 5 % .
results participants overall , 834 children using the electronic auto - injector were recruited over a period of 1.5 years. of these , 824 children were included in the evaluable population , with four children excluded due to incomplete data ( age missing [ n = 1 ] , status missing [ n = 3 ]) and six children excluded due to being aged > 18 years. of the 824 evaluable children , 601 were treatment - naive and 223 were treatment - experienced .
in total , 682 / 824 ( 82.8 %) children provided 3 months of data : 496 / 601 ( 82.5 %) of treatment - naive children and 186 / 223 ( 83.4 %) of treatment - experienced children .
the remaining children had incomplete information for the numbers of reported and recorded injections .
the 824 children were recruited from 206 centres across 15 countries .
the number of children recruited from each country is shown in figure 1 .
characteristics of the survey population are shown in table 2 .
parents administered the injections for 52.8 % ( 430 / 815 ) of children .
the median ( range ) age of children administering their own injections was 13 ( 5 - 18 ) years and for children whose parents took control of injections was 9 ( 1 - 18 ) years .
most children ( 564 / 798 ; 70.7 %) were prescribed seven injections per week , with the remaining children prescribed only six injections per week .

( b ) adherence as recorded by easypod ( tm ) over each month of the 3 - month survey * overall adherence calculated by imputation of missing period ( s ) using non - missing period ( s ) over the 3 - month period , there was a slight , non - significant difference in the proportion of children adherent to treatment according to who administered the injections : 84.8 % in all children for whom their parents administered the injections versus 82.7 % in all children who administered the injections themselves ( using imputed data ) .
this trend was driven by adherence data from month 3 , as adherence was similar during months 1 and 2 .
over the whole 3 - month period , 51.4 % ( 397 / 772 ) of children were recorded to have missed one or more injections .
there was a gradual increase in the number of children missing injections from one month to the next ( figure 2 ) .
in month 1 , 75.1 % ( 535 / 712 ) of children were recorded as missing no injections , in month 2 , 66.7 % ( 481 / 721 ) , and in month 3 , 66.7 % ( 480 / 720 ) .
the number of children missing 1 - 3 injections per month increased over the same period ( from 18.5 % [ 132 / 712 ] to 24.4 % [ 176 / 720 ]) .
few children missed > 10 injections : only 3.1 % ( 22 / 720 ) in month 3 .
figure 2 missed injections during each month of the survey according to the downloaded dose history ( after imputation for missing data ) .
the mean recorded adherence was also assessed for individual countries ( only in countries for which data were available for > 50 children ). of these countries , overall recorded adherence was greatest in spain ( 96.9 %) and lowest in argentina ( 75.4 % ; figure 3 ) .
adherence was higher for treatment - naive children than treatment - experienced children in all countries with the exception of the nordic countries ( finland , norway and sweden ) , portugal and spain , for which adherence was more comparable between the two patient types ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 recorded adherence according to country ( after imputation for missing data using non - missing period ( s )) .
reported adherence the self - reported adherence results indicated that 90.2 % of children were adherent to treatment over the 3 - month period ( table 3a ) .
using the self - reported survey data , 51.5 % ( 421 / 817 ) of children were reported to have missed >= 1 injection over the 3 - month period .
the most common reason ( given by 43.7 % of eligible respondents ) for missing a dose was forgetfulness ; other reasons ( cited by > 10 % of eligible respondents ) included the device not working , running out of cartridges / needles and being away from home ( table 4 ) .

an assessment of difference and concordance between reported and recorded adherence revealed that over months 1 - 3 , the recorded and reported adherence values were equal for 84.3 % of all children , but in 16 % of children , reported adherence values were different to recorded adherence values : reported adherence was higher than recorded adherence for 12.8 % of children and recorded adherence was higher than reported for 3.0 % ( mean percentage difference between recorded and reported adherence - 0.85 ; p < 0.0001 using the signed rank test ) .
similar trends were observed in treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children .
a similar number of questionnaires were being administered prospectively and retrospectively ; however , an exploratory analysis showed no differences in adherence between the two approaches were observed .
acceptability of the electronic auto - injector device device preparation overall , 82.5 % ( 664 / 805 ) of participants found the electronic auto - injector easy / very easy to prepare .
only 2.2 % ( 18 / 805 ) of respondents rated the injection preparation as not easy at all ( table 5 ) .
the majority ( 684 / 806 , 84.9 %) of respondents also rated the duration of injection preparation as short / very short ( table 5 ) .

device use when questioned about the ease and duration of injection , 92.4 % ( 720 / 779 ) of respondents said that it was easy / very easy to use and 85.0 % ( 684 / 805 ) rated the duration of injection as short / very short ( table 5 ). of the possible choices for injection location ( thighs , belly , buttocks or arms ) , the thighs were the preferred site ( 88.3 % [ 686 / 777 ] of children injected in the thighs , whereas other sites were used by less than 53.8 %) .
overall , the default setting ( medium ) was preferred for both injection depth ( 72.3 % [ 562 / 777 ] when injecting in the thighs ; 35.7 % [ 231 / 647 ] when injecting in the belly ; 41.9 % [ 279 / 666 ] when injecting in the buttocks ; and 43.5 % [ 285 / 656 ] when injecting in the arms ) and injection speed ( 71.1 % [ 566 / 796 ] when injecting in any location ) .
the device was described by 89.1 % ( 716 / 804 ) of participants as comfortable / very comfortable to use ( table 5 ) .
the majority of respondents ( 61.5 % [ 480 / 780 ]) reported experiencing no pain when injecting with the electronic auto - injector .
those patients who experienced pain were then asked whether the injection hurt as much as they were expecting ( although this question was also answered by some of those who said that they did not experience pain ) .
over half ( 57.9 % [ 210 / 363 ]) of respondents to this question described it as being less or much less painful than expected .
few respondents ( 13.5 % [ 49 / 363 ]) reported that the injection hurt more / much more than they thought it would .
device features survey participants were also asked to answer questions concerning specific features of the electronic auto - injector .
in total , 85.8 % ( 687 / 801 ) and 82.9 % ( 671 / 809 ) stated that the cartridge and needle , respectively , were easy / very easy to change ( table 5 ) .
most participants found the device easy to hold and compact , as well as attractive and silent / quiet on injection ( table 5 ) .
future use of the device at the end of the 3 - month survey period , 91.8 % ( 732 / 797 ) of respondents stated a desire to continue using the electronic auto - injector : 92.7 % ( 542 / 585 ) of treatment - naive and 89.6 % ( 190 / 212 ) of treatment - experienced children .
for children who did not want to continue using the device , 74.6 % ( 44 / 59 ) were recorded as being adherent to treatment .
discussion this multinational , observational survey of over 800 children using an electronic auto - injector device for up to 3 months found a good level of adherence to therapy .
the dose history that had been automatically recorded by the device and reviewed by the physician showed that 87.5 % of children were adherent to therapy ( injecting at least 92 % of doses over the 3 - month period ) .
furthermore , 75.1 % of all children did not miss any injections in month 1 , 66.7 % in both months 2 and 3 .
adherence to treatment has an important impact on overall treatment outcome .
in a group of poorly compliant patients , growth rates were found to be significantly lower compared with patients who missed fewer doses [ 4 ] : height velocity in patients missing > 15 injections per month ( equivalent to > 3 - 4 per week ) was 6.3 cm / year compared with 9.4 cm / year in those missing 11 - 15 doses per month ( p < 0.03 ) .
it has also been estimated that growth velocity suffers a significant decline if > 2 injections per week are missed [ 5 ] .
in this survey , it was possible to monitor how many injections were missed during each month of the survey by looking at the dose - history data from the electronic auto - injector. by scaling up to find a comparable figure for the proportion of patients who missed > 2 injections per week , only a relatively small percentage of children had a level of non - adherence that would have a serious impact on growth ( < 5 % of children missed >= 7 injections in month 3 ) .
adherence was higher in treatment - naive children compared with treatment - experienced children ( 89.7 % vs 81.7 %) over the course of the survey .
this observation suggests that a drop in adherence may occur with increasing duration of treatment : longer - term users may be less enthusiastic or motivated about adhering to treatment compared with those users new to treatment , who may be more diligent .
this agrees with previous studies with gh [ 5 ] and other therapies taken on a long - term basis [ 16,17 ] .
even within the short duration of the survey , a moderate decline in adherence rates was observed .
the very good levels of recorded adherence during the first month , when 75.1 % of children missed no injections , fell in the second and third months , with 66.7 % of children missing no injections at month 3 .
as this survey only followed children for 3 months , an evaluation of adherence over a longer time period is currently planned .
self - reported adherence , collected via the survey , showed slightly higher rates of adherence than the dose - history data ( 90.2 % vs 87.5 %) .
although asking the user about their injection habits may be the most straightforward approach to evaluating adherence , these results show that it may not always be a reliable and accurate method .
missed doses may be forgotten and adherence overestimated .
electronic recording of the dosing history using a device with an integrated dose log offers an improved , objective method of accurately monitoring adherence .
the rates of compliance reported here compare well with previous studies [ 4,5 ] .
data from an american gh registry based on physician - reported adherence , indicate that 76 - 85 % missed 0 - 3 doses per month , over a 24 - month period [ 4 ] .
in the current survey , a child was considered adherent to treatment if they missed a maximum of two injections per month .
therefore , a proportion of the children considered adherent in the american gh registry ( those who missed three injections per month ) will not have been considered adherent in our study .
in a study of 75 children attending a uk clinic , an assessment of adherence was based on prescriptions over 12 months [ 5 ] .
the frequency of missed injections was estimated to be 0 in 36 % of children , up to 1 per week in 25 % of children , > 1 - 2 per week in 16 % of children and > 2 per week in 23 % of children .
although the factors influencing adherence and persistence in gh treatment were not explored here , misperceptions about the consequences of missed gh doses , discomfort with injections , dissatisfaction with treatment results and inadequate contact with healthcare providers are among the key reasons reported in other studies [ 6,7 ] .
coaching by healthcare professionals and ongoing discussions about the benefits of treatment are important to achieve good adherence [ 18 ] .
better patient autonomy in managing their own condition is also predictive of treatment adherence , as is involving the patient in treatment decisions [ 19 ] .
patients may be more likely to be adherent to treatment if they are allowed to choose the delivery device [ 5,20 ] .
potential barriers to better adherence include the use of complicated delivery devices [ 18 ] , suggesting that having a good perception of the delivery device is a factor that may also influence adherence .
the current survey also showed that children and their parents had a very good perception of the electronic auto - injector after 3 months of use , rating specific features of the device highly .
the majority considered the device to be quick , easy and comfortable to use .
there was little difference between treatment - naive and treatment - experienced children in their responses to questions .
these results support the findings of previous , smaller ( up to 61 patients ) , shorter - term ( up to 60 days ) studies , which together indicate a high level of patient acceptance of the electronic auto - injector for daily administration of r - hgh [ 14,15 ] .
results from an open - label multicentre survey that included 61 patients showed that the majority of patients had a good overall impression of the device after 60 days of use [ 14 ] .
in addition , the nurses / physicians who trained them how to use the device also rated the device favourably with respect to participants' ease in learning to use the device [ 14 ] .
unlike previous user trials of the electronic auto - injector [ 14,15 ] , the current study is the first to include data on adherence as captured using the device .
in a survey conducted at a uk hospital , patients commencing gh therapy were given the freedom to choose their delivery device [ 20 ]. of those switching devices , 74 % changed to the electronic auto - injector .
none of the patients who started on this novel device later switched to using another device .
although the present survey did not provide children or their parents with a free choice of injection device , at the end of the survey , 92 % of children / parents stated that they would like to continue using it. interestingly , adherence in children who did not want to continue using the device was slightly lower than that in the overall population ( when considering all children in the evaluable population , 74.6 % vs 84.1 % , respectively ) .
conclusions this survey of 824 children showed a high level of compliance to daily r - hgh administration using easypod ( tm ) over a 3 - month period , with almost 90 % of children meeting the criterion for adherence to treatment .
a significantly higher adherence rate was observed in treatment - naive children compared with treatment - experienced children .
in addition , children / parents liked the device and found it easy to use for daily administration of r - hgh even if they did not have any previous experience of injecting .
moreover , almost all wanted to continue using it. such acceptance of devices for r - hgh administration should reduce the burden of daily treatment and may improve adherence to therapy .
good adherence , as demonstrated here , should lead to optimal efficacy and allow children to reach their height potential .

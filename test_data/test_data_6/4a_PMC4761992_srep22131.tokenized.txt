to view a copy of this license , visit http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 / although cord blood transplantation has significantly extended the lifespan of mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 ( mps1 ) patients , over 95 % manifest cornea clouding with about 50 % progressing to blindness .
as corneal transplants are met with high rejection rates in mps1 children , there remains no treatment to prevent blindness or restore vision in mps1 children .
since mps1 is caused by mutations in idua , which encodes alpha - l - iduronidase , a gene addition strategy to prevent , and potentially reverse , mps1 - associated corneal blindness was investigated .
initially , a codon optimized idua cdna expression cassette ( opt - idua ) was validated for idua production and function following adeno - associated virus ( aav ) vector transduction of mps1 patient fibroblasts .
then , an aav serotype evaluation in human cornea explants identified an aav8 and 9 chimeric capsid ( 8g9 ) as most efficient for transduction .
aav8g9 - opt - idua administered to human corneas via intrastromal injection demonstrated widespread transduction , which included cells that naturally produce idua , and resulted in a > 10 - fold supraphysiological increase in idua activity .
no significant apoptosis related to aav vectors or idua was observed under any conditions in both human corneas and mps1 patient fibroblasts .
the collective preclinical data demonstrate safe and efficient idua delivery to human corneas , which may prevent and potentially reverse mps1 - associated cornea blindness .
mucopolysaccharidosis1 ( mps1 ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by null or nonsense mutations in the gene encoding alpha - l - iduronidase ( idua ) , a ubiquitous intracellular and secreted enzyme that breaks down glycosaminoglycans ( gags ) .
in the absence of functional idua , gags accumulate in lysosomes and disrupt the normal intracellular trafficking of lipids , sugars , and proteins causing multisystem end organ damage .
the incidence of mps1 is approximately 1 in 100,000 and the disease is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , cardiac insufficiency , bone and joint deformities , dwarfism , mental retardation and serious nervous system problems , which commonly result in death by 10 years of age .
additional symptoms include hearing loss , joint stiffness , and clouding of the cornea which results in loss of vision1 .
current mps1 treatments include idua enzyme replacement therapy ( ert ) ( aldurazyme ) via intravenous injections , which has proven useful in reducing hepatosplenomegaly , and in improving myocardiac function , pulmonary symptoms and motility in mps1 patients with mild disease .
a more promising treatment relies on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) which has been used for the past 2 - 3 decades in mps1 patients .
hsct has proven successful at improving cognitive function , reducing hepatosplenomegaly , preventing ischemic cardiac disease and prolonging the patient 's lifespan , in some cases by decades .
clinical outcomes are best when myeloablative chemotherapy and cord blood donors are utilized , as it increases the extent of sustained donor chimerism .
a third mps1 treatment approach that is still under preclinical evaluation relies on an adeno - associated virus ( aav ) idua gene addition strategy .
central nervous system ( cns ) targeted aav - idua gene therapy has been explored in murine , feline , and canine mps1 models following administration via several routes including the carotid artery , intraparenchymal , intraventricular and intrathecal234 .
these gene therapy studies independently report histological , biochemical , and in particular cognitive improvements while , importantly , idua - related toxicity was not observed .
however , ert , hsct and aav cns - targeted or systemic gene therapy exhibit a common deficiency ; the inability to correct mps1 - associated maladies in privileged compartments including the joint and eye .
regarding the ocular abnormalities , approximately 90 % of mps1 children lose vision due to corneal clouding , which has been attributed to the abnormal presence of vacuolated stroma cells5 .
detailed analyses of mps1 human corneas demonstrated an accumulation of chondroitin and dermatan sulphate gags , which alter the uniform distribution , organization , and size of collagen fibrils67 .
cornea transplantation in mps1 children has been used to address the corneal blindness , however the high rejection rate has , in recent years , discouraged this treatment as standard practice .
on the contrary , isolated reports using hsct have demonstrated the capacity to stabilize , improve , and in some cases restore corneal clarity789101112 .
these data strongly support our hypothesis that cornea abnormalities can be prevented or reversed in the presence of idua8 .
cornea targeted aav gene therapy has been investigated in animal models primarily following 2 routes of administration ; topical applications in wound healing assays and direct injection to the corneal stroma .
regarding topical applications , aav serotype 9 ( aav9 ) was reported most efficient for stromal transduction , however , this was nearly entirely localized to the epithelial / stromal boundary13 .
regarding aav gene delivery following intrastromal injection into human cornea explants , it was observed that aav8 was more efficient than aav2 or aav1 for stromal transduction , which encompassed multiple cell types including cd34 + keratocytes and macrophages14 .
importantly , both of these routes of drug administration observed no deleterious consequences related to the aav vector131415 .
the purpose of the present study is to explore aav - mediated idua delivery as an effective treatment for mps1 cornea clouding .
towards this end , we engineered an aav vector cassette that efficiently restores idua to mps1 patient fibroblasts in a dose - dependent manner .
normal , and supraphysiological , idua activity was demonstrated in both cellular lysates and in culture supernatants .
then , as mps1 corneal disease has been attributed to stroma abnormalities5 , the aav serotypes reported most efficient for stromal transduction were evaluated in human corneas .
the results demonstrate efficient transduction ( aav9 > aav8 ) , however , an aav8 / 9 chimeric ( 8g9 ) capsid performed significantly better than either parental serotype .
using aav8g9 , idua was over - produced in the human corneal stroma with widespread distribution in multiple cell types , which included cells that naturally produce idua .
functional assays in human corneas demonstrated a 10 - fold elevation of idua activity seven days post - injection without any indications of toxicity .
given the popularity of aav gene therapy in ocular clinical trials , the soluble nature of idua , and the potential for compassionate use of aav - idua in mps1 children , our preclinical data herein provides encouraging results for a potential treatment of mps1 - associated corneal clouding .
results to develop an aav idua expression cassette , the human idua cdna ( nm _ 000203 ) was codon optimized for human production ( opt - idua ) and situated between the cmv promoter and the sv40 poly - adenylation sequence in an aav inverted terminal repeat serotype 2 plasmid context ( fig. 1a ) .
production of idua protein by the ptr - cmv - opt - idua plasmid was confirmed , after performing transfection and western blot experiments with human embryonic kidney 293 cells and mps1 patient fibroblasts ( fig. s1a,b ) .
additionally , idua protein levels from the codon optimized open reading frame were similar to that generated by wild type idua cdna in both 293 cells and mps1 patient fibroblasts ( fig. s1 ) .
aav2 - opt - idua vectors were prepared as described16 and used for characterization in mps1 patient derived fibroblasts .
immortalized normal human fibroblasts ( nhf ) served as the control cell line17 .
in dose escalation experiments , aav2 - opt - idua transduction of mps1 fibroblasts resulted in increasing levels of idua restoration , in both cellular lysates and in the culture supernatant ( fig. 1b ) .
in fact , as resting levels of idua in nhf are relatively low , a dose of 5,000 viral genomes / cell resulted in already supraphysiological levels in both cell lysates and in culture supernatants ( fig. 1b ) .
consistently , idua function was restored and elevated in transduced mps1 patient fibroblasts with a 10 - fold and 30 - fold increases in cellular lysate and supernatant , respectively , at the highest investigated dose ( fig. 1c,d ) .
despite idua overproduction following aav vector transduction , no toxicity was observed in patient fibroblasts at any dose using a dye exclusion assay ( fig. s2 ) .
importantly , these results demonstrate the functionality and safety of aav2 - opt - idua in a mps1 patient context .
an analysis of mps1 patient corneas attributed stromal abnormalities as the cause of the corneal opacity that results in vision loss5 .
therefore , direct administration of aav - opt - idua should restore idua activity in the corneal stroma compartment of mps1 patients , hopefully preventing or reversing the mps1 phenotype .
previous reports demonstrated the utility of both aav814 and aav913 for human keratocyte transduction , one of the most prevalent cell types present in the cornea .
as such , these capsids , carrying a self - complementary ( sc ) aav - cmv - gfp genome , were evaluated in normal human corneal explants , which remain viable for weeks post - mortem .
preliminary experiments demonstrated that a volume of 50mul injected into the stroma was tolerated with minimal tissue distension and a distribution across =~ 50 % of the adult cornea using the vector vehicle containing india ink ( fig. s3 ) .
therefore , aav serotypes 8 or 9 containing a gfp reporter gene were administered to human cornea stroma by injection ( 1e10 vg in 50 ul ) and analyzed seven days later by western blotting .
given the reports of both 8 and 9 for cornea transduction , an aav8 / 9 chimeric capsid ( 8g9 ) , containing the galactose receptor of aav9 engrafted on the aav8 capsid was also investigated in the same manner1314 .
western blotting suggested that aav8g9 - gfp resulted in greater transduction than either parent serotype ( fig. 2a ) .
in order to quantify the degree of viral transduction of the different serotypes on the human corneas , we performed a quantitative elisa gfp assay ( fig. 2b ) .
single stranded versions of the aav serotypes 8 , 9 and 8g9 carrying the cmv - gfp cassette were used for cornea infection for seven days .
after that time , viral transduction was determined according to the amount of gfp expressed by the infected cells .
statistical analysis revealed that aav8g9 was able to infect the human cornea to a higher extent , compared to the transduction obtained by the parental capsids aav8 or aav9 ; p <= 0.05 for both cases .
this analysis was performed with a total of five human corneas of mixed gender .
in order to determine the biodistribution of single - strand aav8g9 - gfp transduction ( final volume 50 mul ) , gfp immunofluorescence was performed on human corneal cross sections .
the results demonstrate a lateral spread of vector transduction across the cornea with penetration into the deeper stromal layers , including some endothelial cell transduction ( fig. 2c ) .
co - staining with cd34 , a marker of keratocytes , with alpha - smooth muscle actin ( alpha - sm ) , indicative of differentiated keratocytes , and with f4 / 80 , a macrophage marker , demonstrated the corneal cell promiscuity for the aav8g9 capsid ( fig. 2d ) .
following confirmation that the aav8g9 capsid was the most efficient for corneal stroma transduction , we determined if the cell types transduced by aav8g9 naturally produce idua .
to do this , dual staining for the cell type marker and the idua protein was performed in normal untreated human corneas .
the results indicate that all of the confirmed corneal cell types transduced by aav8g9 naturally produce idua ( fig. 3a ) .
next , aav8g9 - opt - idua preclinical vector preparations were produced by the unc vector core and evaluated in normal human corneas ex vivo .
for these experiments , injection of single - strand aav8g9 - gfp was evaluated and pbs served as the negative control .
seven days post - injection ( 1e10 vg in 50 mul ) , total protein was recovered and idua abundance was investigated by western blotting .
in whole corneal lysates , it was observed that the resting levels of idua are relatively low and that vector - derived idua , both the precursor and cleaved forms , was readily detected ( fig. 3b ) .
consistently , a 10 - fold elevation of idua activity was observed in the aav8g9 - opt - idua injected corneas when compared to the normal levels found in human corneas ( fig. 3c ). by immunofluorescence staining and detection on human cornea cross sections , the resting levels and distribution of idua were determined ( fig. 4 ) .
as mps1 patient corneas are rare , staining under the same conditions but without the idua primary antibody served as the negative control .
the results demonstrate relatively low levels of idua within the corneal stroma that were also present in the corneal epithelia and to a lesser extent , in the endothelial cell layer ( fig. 4 ) .
idua staining was also performed on human cornea cross sections that were injected with aav8g9 - opt - idua .
the results correlate to those of the idua western blot and the functional assay ( fig. 3 ) in that there is an approximate 5 - 10 fold increase in idua in normal human corneas treated with aav8g9 - opt - idua compared to the resting level in human corneas ( fig. 4 ) .
furthermore , similar to the results observed with aav8g9 - gfp , vector derived idua appeared well distributed ( figs. 2c and 4 ) .
considering restoration of idua to the mps1 patient cornea , it is critical to determine any vector or idua related toxicity .
due to unavailability of a small animal model for mps1 that develops cornea clouding , we performed apoptosis experiments in normal human corneas following aav8g9 - gfp or aav8g9 - opt - idua stromal injection ( 1e10 vg ) .
tunel staining , which detects fragmented dna indicative of cellular apoptosis , was performed on day 7 post - injection .
although the nuclease - treated positive control samples demonstrated extensive tunel staining , the staining of corneas in which idua abundance / function were significantly elevated did not show a significant difference to the ones non - injected or injected with aav8g9 - gfp ( fig. 5 ) .
these results are consistent with those obtained using mps1 patient fibroblasts and collectively suggest the safety of aav8g9 - opt - idua gene therapy in mps1 patient corneas .
however , a complete toxicity study should be performed in an in vivo mps1 model , where immune responses and / or liver toxicity could be evidenced .
discussion hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , after myeloablative chemotherapy using allogeneic bone marrow or umbilical cord blood donors has been shown to extend life and improve its overall quality , particularly when performed in mps1 children under 2 years of age1819202122 .
engrafted donor cells provide a source of systemic idua and , through engraftment of donor microglial cells , enzyme replacement in the brain .
transplanted children , surviving 1 - 2 decades after hsct with full donor chimerism , have normal blood idua levels with normal , to near normal , cognitive and cardiac functions .
later , and ongoing , manifestations of mps1 after transplantation do occur and generally are limited to the joints , bones , and the eye , all of which are organs with lower profusion and lower delivery of donor - derived idua .
as such , our preclinical corneal approach explored herein , was designed as a supplemental mps1 therapy to address the shortcomings of stem cell transplantation and aav gene therapy targeting the cns .
as mps1 patient corneas are rarely available , we initially investigated disease correction in mps1 patient fibroblasts .
the data demonstrate restoration of idua function using a low vector dose .
this is , in part , due to the relatively low level of idua in normal fibroblasts which is presumably sufficient for normal cellular physiology ( fig. 1 ) .
consistently , the abundance of idua found in normal human corneas was also modest .
in fact , in whole cornea lysates , idua abundance by western blotting was not readily detected , however , tissue histology identified resting levels of idua in corneal epithelia , endothelia and the majority in multiple cell types found in the stroma ( figs 3 and 4 ) .
this evaluation of idua abundance and aav - mediated restoration highlights a very important aspect to our corneal gene therapy approach : mainly that only a low amount of idua is necessary to restore wt idua function in the corneas of mps1 children .
this evidence is supported by studies with the mps1 canine model , in which cornea clouding was significantly improved in presence of low levels of idua , meanwhile higher levels of idua did not provide further benefit23 .
in our experiments , our chosen aav dose in the cornea explants ( 1e10 vg ) was found to be excessive and resulted in a 10 - fold supraphysiological elevation of idua function .
however , even at this high idua level no apoptosis was detected ( figs 3 - 5 ) .
given the ability of secreted idua to cross - correct neighboring cells , the low resting levels in normal human corneas , and the efficiency of aav8g9 - opt - idua for human cornea transduction , the data herein suggest that a low vector dose will result in normal levels of idua in mps1 patient corneas .
furthermore , reported complications associated with a neutralizing antibody response to the idua transgene product ( idua ) are not anticipated as there are no antibodies in the human cornea24 .
however , at this point we are not able to predict the occurrence of any type of immune reaction or liver - associated toxicity .
given the collective data herein , restoring idua function in mps1 corneas seems quite feasible .
furthermore , it appears that aav8g9 elicits idua production in stromal cells that naturally produce idua , as well as in the endothelial layer ( fig. 4 ) .
despite the ability to restore idua in the cornea , the question of whether or not restoration of idua in the cornea will reverse corneal clouding remains unanswered .
however , several lines of evidence suggest that idua in the mps1 cornea will reverse the corneal blindness723 .
in particular , the reduction of corneal opacity , but not complete correction , was reported in mps1 patients receiving hsct5 .
in that work it was hypothesized that the partial correction was due to restoration of idua in the corneal endothelium but not in the stroma .
as our aav - opt - idua strategy is capable of transducing both of these compartments ( fig. 4 ) , the likelihood of reversing or preventing mps1 - associated corneal blindness , as a supplemental therapy to hsct or aav systemic gene delivery remains a viable possibility .
materials and methods production of aav vectors for cell culture experiments , a previously described triple transfection method was used to generate the vectors used herein25 .
this method used the pxr2 or pxr8g9 ( manuscript submitted ) plasmids , which all contain rep2 of aav and individually the capsid genes of the indicated serotype .
the plasmid containing the intended aav genome was first constructed by substituting the egfp gene in ptr - cmv - egfp with the codon optimized idua cdna ( provided by genscript ) at the agei and sali sites ( now called ptr - cmv - opt - idua ) , or the wild type full - length hidua cdna ( kindly provided by dr. aronovich26 ) ( now called ptr - cmv - wtidua ) .
following aav production and cesium chloride gradient separation25 , peak fractions were dialyzed against pbs , and titered by quantitative pcr ( cmv _ f caa gta cgc ccc cta ttg ac , cmv _ r aag tcc cgt tga ttt tgg tg ) which was confirmed by southern dot blot25 .
for the experiments in human explants , gmp grade vector preparations were provided by the unc vector core .
cell culture and vector transduction human embryonic kidney 293 cells , mps1 patient fibroblasts , and normal human fibroblasts17 were maintained at 37 degreesc in a 5 % co2 atmosphere in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 u / ml ) .
transduction of cultured cells was performed in a 24 well plate in a fixed volume .
for these experiments , vector was added to the wells at the indicated viral genome per cell dose and was not removed for the duration of the experiment .
human cornea experiments all experimental protocols were approved by the university of north carolina at chapel hill .
human corneas were provided by the miracles in sight tissue procurement bank .
these unidentified post - mortem tissue experiments were performed in accordance with the human subjects research office of human research ethics at the university of north carolina at chapel hill ( irb - 14 - 1019 ) .
the corneas of both genders were maintained in the supplied opti - mem at 37 degreesc in a 5 % co2 atmosphere .
injections were performed with a 31 gauge insulin syringe .
india ink was used as a dye to verify the injections .
corneas were then cultured for 7 days and analyzed as described in the text .
for detection of gfp by elisa , human corneas were trimmed into several pieces of similar size and each piece was incubated in a separate well in a certain condition .
quantitative gfp detection by elisa human cornea pieces were infected with 1 x 1010 viral genomes of each serotype : 8 , 9 , or the 8 / 9 chimeric 8g9 for seven days .
cell lysates were obtained by cutting each cornea into pieces and incubating the pieces with 200 mul m - per ( r ) mammalian protein extraction reagent ( pierce , catalog number : 78503 ) and 2 mul halt ( tm ) protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 minutes , followed by repeating freezing and thawing procedures .
an aliquot of 100 mul of each lysate was incubated at 4 degreesc overnight with the anti - gfp antibody coated plate ( cell biolabs , inc , catalog number akr - 121 ) .
following extensive washes , a second incubation with an anti - gfp antibody , but this time biotinylated , was performed for 2 hours at room temperature .
wells were washed and streptavidin - enzyme conjugate was added to each well .
the reaction took place by adding the substrate for the enzyme and once the color was developed , the reaction was stopped and absorbance at 450 nm was measured .
functional idua assay quantitative idua enzyme activities were measured as previously described27 .
briefly , 10 mul of a supernatant or cell lysis solution , obtained the same way as for the detection of gfp by elisa , were incubated with 50 mum 4 - methylumbelliferyl alpha - l - iduronide made in 0.4 m sodium formate buffer , ph 3.5 , containing 0.2 % triton x - 100 at 37c for 60 min in the dark .
reactions were stopped by adding 80 mul of 0.5 m naoh / glycine buffer ph 10.3 .
the 96 well plates were centrifuged for 1 min 13000 rpm at 4c and supernantans were transfered to a black 96w plate , clear bottom with lid for measuring fluorescence at 450 nm , following excitation at 365 nm. the amount of cleaved substrate was calculated from a standard curve , previously established with 4 - methylumbelliferone and expressed as nmol / h / mg for enzyme activity in cell lysates , or nmol / h / 10 mul for analysis of supernatants . the protein amount for each sample was determined with the bca assay ( pierce ( tm ) bca protein assay kit , catalog number : 23225 ) .
tunel assay apoptotic cells generated due to the cellular cytotoxicity during aav infection of human cornea explants were determined by deoxynucleotidyltransferase ( tdt ) - mediated dutp - biotin nick end labeling with dab .
tunel assay was performed with tacs2 tdt - blue label in situ apoptosis detection kit ( trevigen , gaithersburg , md. ) .
briefly , following deparaffinization and rehydration , the human cornea sections were digested for 20 min in proteinase k. slides were washed with 1 x pbs and the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the tissues with 3 % h2o2 solution in methanol .
after washing the slides with 1 x pbs , tissue sections were incubated with 1x tdt labeling buffer for 5 min .
the labeling reaction consisting of incubating the cornea tissues with tdt enzyme , dntps with biotinylated dutp , and 1 x manganese chloride in 1 x tdt labeling buffer for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37c .
the reaction was completed by incubating with 1 x tdt stop buffer .
the fragmented dna was visualized by treating the sections with streptavidin - conjugated horseradish peroxidase and dab solution .
immunofluorescence staining human cornea tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 mum using a microtome .
in order to stain the slide with immunofluorescence antibodies , sections were deparaffinized by incubating the slides in xylene for 5 min , two times total , followed by rehydration by immersing them sequentially in 100 % , 95 % and 70 % ethanol solutions , 5 min each , and finally in water for 5 min .
before staining the sections , antigen retrieval procedure was performed in order to guarantee the exposure of epitopes , which were previously masked due to the paraffin embedding process .
specifically , slides were immerse into pre - heated antigen retrieval solution ( dako ) at 98c for 7 min .
non - specific binding sites within the tissues were then blocked by incubating the slides with 10 % ngs , in 1x pbs for 1 hour at rt. slides were washed twice for 5 minutes each with 2 % ngs in 1x pbs .
sections were then incubated overnight at 4 degreesc with primary antibody diluted appropriately in a solution consisting of 2 % ngs in 1x pbs .
after incubation with primary antibody , slides were washed three times , for 5 minutes each , in order to remove non - specifically bound primary antibody .
the washing solution contained 2 % ngs in 1x pbs .
an appropriate fluorescently - labeled secondary antibody ( 5 mug / ml ) was then added to the slides diluted in 2 % ngs in 1x pbs , and slides were incubated for 1 hour at 4 degreesc .
finally , slides were washed twice with 2 % ngs in 1x pbs three times , for five minutes each , followed by a last wash with 1x pbs at 4 degreesc .
a couple of drops of hoechst ( molecular probes - life technologies , h3569 hoechst 33258 , pentahydrate - 1 mug / ml ) were added for 7 minutes to counterstain the nuclei within the section , followed by a wash with water .
slides were then coverslipped with cytoseal 60 ( thermo fisher scientific ( nyse : tmo )) .

background thermostable enzymes from thermophiles have attracted extensive studies .
in this investigation , a nuclease - encoding gene ( designated as gbsv1 - nsn ) was obtained from a thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv1 for the first time .
results after recombinant expression in escherichia coli , the purified gbsv1 - nsn exhibited non - specific nuclease activity , being able to degrade various nucleic acids , including rna , single - stranded dna and double - stranded dna that was circular or linear .
based on sequence analysis , the nuclease shared no homology with any known nucleases , suggesting that it was a novel nuclease .
the characterization of the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn showed that its optimal temperature and ph were 60degreesc and 7.5 , respectively .
the results indicated that the enzymatic activity was inhibited by enzyme inhibitors or detergents , such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid , citrate , dithiothreitol , beta - mercaptoethanol , guanidine hydrochloride , urea and sds .
in contrast , the nuclease activity was enhanced by tritonx - 100 , tween - 20 or chaps to approximately 124.5 % - 141.6 % .
the km of gbsv1 - nsn nuclease was 231 , 61 and 92 mum , while its kcat was 1278 , 241 and 300 s - 1 for the cleavage of dsdna , ssdna and rna , respectively .
conclusion our study , therefore , presented a novel thermostable non - specific nuclease from thermophilic bacteriophage and its overexpression and purification for scientific research and applications .
background nucleases are defined as a group of enzymes which are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphodiester linkages of nucleic acids .
according to the substrates they hydrolyze , nucleases are divided into two groups : sugar specific nucleases ( deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases ) and sugar non - specific nucleases [ 1 ] .
sugar non - specific nucleases , characterized by their ability to hydrolyze both dna and rna without exhibiting pronounced base preferences , have been detected from a wide variety of sources , such as virus , bacteria , fungi and animals [ 1 - 4 ] .
many of them are extracellular , but some have been found in nuclei , vacuoles , mycelia , mitochondria , conidia , microplasmodia and periplasm [ 5 - 11 ] .
sugar non - specific nucleases play very important roles in different aspects of basic genetic mechanisms , including their participation in mutation avoidance , dna repair , dna replication and recombination , scavenging of nucleotides and phosphates for the growth and metabolism , host defense against foreign nucleic acid molecules , programmed cell death and establishment of an infection .
due to their important roles in nucleic acid metabolisms , the sugar non - specific nucleases have been extensively used in molecular biology researches , for example the determination of nucleic acid structure , the rapid sequencing of rna , the removal of nucleic acids during protein purification and the use as antiviral agents [ 1,12 - 14 ] .
up to date , more than 30 nucleases have been obtained from microorganisms , such as staphylococcal nuclease from staphylococcus aureus , s. marcescens nuclease from serratia marcescens , s1 nuclease from aspergillus oryzae , p1 nuclease from penicillium citrinum , bal31 nuclease from alteromonas espejiana and nuca from anabaena [ 15 - 17 ]. with regard to virus , only the pc1 protein from fowlpox virus and rwssv - nsn from shrimp white spot syndrome virus are identified as non - specific nucleases [ 2 ] .
however , all the non - specific nucleases are obtained from mesophiles or mesophilic viruses .
no study has reported on nucleases from thermophilic viruses .
compared with mesophilic enzymes , thermostable nucleases may possess novel properties in structures and biological functions .
in the present study , a non - specific nuclease gene ( termed as gbsv1 - nsn ) was cloned from a thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv1 for the first time .
the sequence homology analysis revealed that it was a novel nuclease .
the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn nuclease was further characterized .
it was shown that the gbsv1 - nsn enzyme was thermostable .
results recombinant expression and determination of a novel non - specific nuclease gbsv1 - nsn based on genome sequence analysis of thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv1 , an open reading frame ( orf ) [ genbank : ef079892 ] of gbsv1 shared homologies with phage replication proteins ( fig. 1 ) , which contained a dnad - like domain , suggesting that the protein encoded by this orf had the dna binding capacity .
in order to identify its biological function , the orf ( termed as gbsv1 - nsn gene ) was expressed as gst fusion protein in e.coli .
after induction with iptg at 37degreesc , the induced and non - induced recombinant bacterium ( containing gbsv1 - nsn gene ) and control bacterium ( vector only ) were analyzed by sds - page .
a band ( about 59.8 kda ) corresponding to the gst - gbsv1 - nsn fusion protein was observed in the induced recombinant bacterium containing gbsv1 - nsn gene ( fig. 2 , lane 4 ) , while no protein was found in the same positions in the induced and non - induced controls ( vector only ) , showing that the gbsv1 - nsn gene was expressed .
after purification by affinity chromatography , a gst - gbsv1 - nsn fusion protein was obtained ( fig. 2 , lane 5 ) .
the fusion protein gst - gbsv1 - nsn was efficiently cleaved by thrombin , yielding the purified gbsv1 - nsn with a molecular mass of 33.8 kda ( fig. 2 , lane 6 ) .

phage proteins containing dnad - like domain were from geobacillus phage gbsv1 [ genbank : abk63794 ] , bacillus anthracis phage lambda ba01 [ genbank : aap24466 ] , bacillus phage spp1 [ genbank : np _ 690731 ] , streptococcus phage 370.3 [ genbank : aak33864 ] , streptococcus phage ej - 1 [ genbank : np _ 945250 ] and clostridium phage phic2 [ genbank : yp _ 001110781 ] .
the dnad - like domain of gbsv1 - nsn held positions 158 - 227 .

in an attempt to determine the dna binding capacity of the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn , the purified gbsv1 - nsn protein was incubated with the genomic dna of bacteriophage gbsv1 .
surprisingly , the dna was degraded by the gbsv1 - nsn protein , suggesting it might be a nuclease .
to evaluate its substrate specificity , the purified gbsv1 - nsn protein was incubated with various nucleic acids including the circular pgex - 4t - 2 plasmid dsdna , the linear pgex - 4t - 2 plasmid dsdna , the phix174 virion ssdna and the baker 's yeast rna .
the results showed that all the nucleic acids could be degraded by the gbsv1 - nsn protein ( fig. 3 ) , indicating that it was a non - specific nuclease .

the purified gst protein was used as negative control .
the commercial rnase a ( a ) or dnase i ( b , c and d ) was also included as positive control .
the protein solutions were shown on the top and the nucleic acids were indicated on the right .
1 mug of nucleic acids were respectively incubated with 1.5 mug of the purified gbsv1 - nsn protein in 20 mul of reaction buffer at 37degreesc for six hours .
homology analysis revealed that the gbsv1 - nsn protein shared low identities with known nucleases .
it had 10.0 % , 13.3 % , 13.5 % , 10.9 % and 12.1 % identities with those of staphylococcus aureus thermonuclease [ genbank : p00644 ] , serratia marcescens nuclease [ genbank : p13717 ] , anabaena sp. pcc 7120 nuclease [ genbank : yp _ 227663 ] , homo sapiens endog [ genbank : q14249 ] and wssv - nsn nuclease [ genbank : aaw88443 ] , respectively .
these data suggested that the gbsv1 - nsn was a novel non - specific nuclease .
the effects of temperature and ph on gbsv1 - nsn enzymatic activity the nuclease activity estimated at different temperatures indicated that the optimum temperature for the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn was 60degreesc ( fig. 4a ) .
the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease activity was decreased with higher temperatures above the optimum .
thermostability assays showed that the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease was most stable at 60degreesc ( ph 7.5 ) , retaining more than 80 % of its enzymatic activity for at least 2 hours ( fig. 4b ) .

the nuclease activity of gbsv1 - nsn was assayed at various temperatures ranging from 20degreesc to 80degreesc .
to evaluate the thermostability , the residual enzymatic activities were monitored after incubation of the enzyme solutions ( 295 mug / ml ) in the absence of herring dsdna ( 100 mug / ml ) at 40 , 50 , 60 or 70degreesc ( ph 7.5 ) for 15 , 40 , 60 , 90 or 130 min .

based on the effects of ph on enzymatic activity , the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease exhibited optimal activity at ph 7.5 ( fig. 5a ) .
the recombinant nuclease was stable in the neutral ph ranging from 7.0 to 8.0 ( fig. 5b ) .
it presented higher stability after incubation at 60degreesc for 3 hours , showing 66 , 74 and 71 % residual activity at ph 7.0 , 7.5 and 8.0 , respectively ( fig. 5b ) .

the optimum ph was assayed after incubation in various ph buffers ( ph 3.0 to 10.0 ) at 60degreesc for 15 min .
for ph stability experiments , the gbsv1 - nsn was pre - incubated in a series of ph buffers ( ph 5.0 to 10.0 ) for 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 or 180 min before assay .
each reaction mixture consisted of 100 mug / ml herring dsdna and 295 mug / ml of the purified gbsv1 - nsn protein .
each point represented the mean of triplicate assays and the error bars indicated the standard deviations .
responses of the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease to metal ions , enzyme inhibitors and detergents the effects of different metal ions on the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease activity were evaluated as shown in table 1 .
in the absence of metal ion , the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease was active .
the enzymatic activity was obviously stimulated in the presence of mn2 + and zn2 + at 10 mm concentration each .
metal ions li + , na + , k + , cs + , ca2 + , mg2 + , ni2 + , sr2 + and ba2 + at different concentrations showed very slight inhibition of the gbsv1 - nsn activity , retaining more than 80 % of its initial activity .
however , its activity was strongly inhibited by cu2 + and fe3 +. with the increasing in cu2 + or fe3 + concentration , the nuclease activity decreased sharply .

among them , 10 mm of dtt and 0.6 m of guanidine hydrochloride led to a significant reduction of enzyme activity by 34.1 % and 51.0 % , respectively .
in contrast , the nuclease activity was enhanced by tritonx - 100 , tween - 20 or chaps to approximately 124.5 - 141.6 % .

discussion driven by increasing industrial demands for thermostable biocatalysts , thermophiles have attracted more and more attention as a valuable source of novel enzymes [ 18 ] .
most thermophilic enzymes were extensively studied from thermophilic archaea and bacteria .
however only a few enzymes from thermophilic bacteriophages have been characterized , for example thermostable rna ligase [ 19 ] , polynucleotide kinase [ 20 ] and lytic enzyme [ 21 ] .
therefore , thermophilic bacteriophages are a considerable resource of thermophilic enzymes .
in this investigation , the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn protein from the thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv1 exhibited non - specific nuclease activity .
the results showed that the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease was active at temperatures ranging from 20degreesc to 80degreesc with an optimal temperature of 60degreesc , which was higher than those of most of the reported non - specific nucleases .
in the respect of effects of metal ions on the enzymatic activity , the gbsv1 - nsn was similar to the nuclease alpha from u. maydis and wheat chloroplast nuclease that did not show an obligate requirement of metal ions for their activities [ 22 ] .
it was found that mn2 + or zn2 + could stimulate the gbsv1 - nsn activity .
this stimulation was also observed in the cole7 nuclease which bound a transition metal ion mn2 + or zn2 + in its h - n - h motif [ 23 ] .
however edta had a mild effect in reducing the activity of the gbsv1 - nsn enzyme .
the data suggested that metal ions had a stimulatory effect but were not obligatory for nuclease activity and that they might play roles in stabilizing the enzymatic structure .
it could not be ruled out whether the gbsv1 - nsn enzyme was copurified with some tightly bound metal ions , as was the case of some other nucleases .
this point remained to be further addressed .
the amino acid sequence analysis of the gbsv1 - nsn revealed the existence of two cys residues , indicating that the nuclease might contain a disulfide bridge .
it was found that the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease activity was inhibited by thiol reagents dtt or beta - me , suggesting that its disulfide bridge could play an important role in determining the activity of this nuclease .
however the enzyme was stimulated by tritonx - 100 , tween - 20 and chaps .
comparisons of the catalytic properties of the gbsv1 - nsn with the known nucleases suggested that it had a similar efficiency in dsdna hydrolysis as the serratia nuclease ( smnase ) [ 24 ] and f. succinogenes dnase a [ 3 ] .
however , it had lower catalytic efficiency than that of anabaena nuca in cleavage of various nucleic acids and than that of staphylococcus nuclease ( snase ) in cleavage of ssdna ( table 3 ) .

our data indicated that the gbsv1 - nsn was a novel member of non - specific nuclease family , which was thermostable and disulfide bridge - dependent .
based on sequence analysis , the gbsv1 - nsn protein was highly homologous with the phage replication protein and contained a dnad - like domain , suggesting that it might play important roles in bacteriophagic dna replication .
as well known , dna replication is divided into three main stages , that is initiation , elongation and termination .
in some gram - positive bacteria with low g + c content , the dna replication initiation involves remodeling of a replication origin through the action of the main initiator protein dnaa and primosomal multiprotein cascades including dnad .
these initiator proteins interact with helicases to recruit the dna primases .
dnad is believed to be involved in the cascade for helicase recruitment [ 25 ] .
considering that the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease contained dnad domain , this protein might possess multiple biochemical activities , including the nuclease activity and involvements in the dna replication initiation , as well as in mismatch bacteriophagic dna repair .
up to date , the non - specific nucleases already available are obtained from mesophiles .
the discovery of thermostable gbsv1 - nsn nuclease in this study would facilitate the applications of nucleases in molecular biology researches and in industry at high temperatures , such as the determination of nucleic acid structure , the removal of nucleic acids during protein purification and the use as antiviral agents .
those are merited to be further studied .
conclusion in this study , we have determined a novel thermostable non - specific nuclease from thermophilic bacteriophage for the first time , which shared no homology with any known nucleases .
the characterizations of the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn showed that it was a thermostable nuclease .
in this investigation , the recombinant gbsv1 - nsn could be obtained in large quantity by expression in e. coli .
this would facilitate its biotechnological applications .

the concentrations of metal ions in the incubation solutions with the nuclease and in the final nuclease reactions were 0.1 , 1.0 or 10 mm and 0.05 , 0.5 or 5 mm , respectively .
the assays were carried out for three times .
effects of metal chelators , thiol reagents and detergents on gbsv1 - nsn activity to determine the effects of metal chelators , the nuclease was pre - incubated with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) or citrate at 60degreesc for 10 min , followed by the nuclease activity assay .
the effects of thiol reagents and detergents on the nuclease activity were also monitored by the same procedure as described above .
the concentrations of edta , citrate , dithiothreitol ( dtt ) and beta - mecaptoethanol ( 2 - me ) were 1 mm or 10 mm in the incubation solution with the nuclease and 0.5 mm or 5 mm in the final nuclease reaction , respectively .
the concentrations of sds , tritonx - 100 , tween - 20 or 3 - [( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dimethylammonio ] - 1 - propane sulfonate ( chaps ) were 0.1 % or 1 % ( w / v ) in the incubation solution with the nuclease and 0.05 % or 0.5 % in the final nuclease reaction , respectively .
the concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride and urea were 0.6 m and 1 m in the incubation solution with the nuclease and 0.3 m and 0.5 m in the final nuclease reaction , respectively .
all assays were performed in triplicate .
kinetic parameters of gbsv1 - nsn the protein concentration of purified gbsv1 - nsn was determined based on the dye - binding assay method of bradford [ 26 ] , with bovine serum albumin ( sigma , usa ) as a standard .
steady - state kinetic parameters for the gbsv1 - nsn nuclease were determined using the kunitz assay with herring sperm dna ( dsdna ) , heat - denatured herring sperm dna ( ssdna ) and baker 's yeast rna .
in order to determine km and vmax , the nucleic acid concentrations were varied in the range of 0 - 100 mug.ml - 1 .
all nuclease activity assays were conducted at 60degreesc in a tris / hcl buffer ( 20 mm , ph 7.5 ) .
typical lineweaver - burk plots were obtained when 1 /[ v ] was plotted against 1 /[ s ] [ 27 ] .
kinetic parameters were estimated by linear regression from lineweaver - burk plots .
all assays were conducted for three times .
to compare the km and kcat of gbsv1 - nsn with those of the known nucleases , the km values were converted from mug.ml - 1 to mum by using a mean molar mass of 330 g.mol - 1.nt - 1 [ 28 ] .
the vmax values were converted to kcat by assuming that the molar mass per nucleotide was 330 g.mol - 1 and that a change in absorbance of 0.3 a260 accompanied the degradation of 50 mug.ml - 1 dna and 0.25 a260 accompanied the degradation of 50 mug.ml - 1 rna [ 24 ] .
statistical analysis all the numerical data were analyzed by one - way anova and expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation .

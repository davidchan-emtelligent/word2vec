pyogenic sacroiliitis ( ps ) is an acute form of sacroiliitis that mostly starts with very painful buttock pain .
here in this case , the followup magnetic resonance ( mr ) images of a 49 - year - old male patient with ps is displayed .
after his sacroiliitis was documented by mr images , he was treated with the combination of rifampicin plus streptomycin and moxifloxacin .
serial mr investigations were done to disclose acute and subsequent imaging changes concerning sacroiliac joint and surrounding bone structures .
although after treatment all the symptoms were completely resolved , 20 months later changes suggesting active sacroiliitis on mr images were continuing .
1. introduction pyogenic sacroiliitis ( ps ) is a relatively rare condition , representing only 1 - 2 % of all cases of septic arthritis [ 1 , 2 ] .
nonspecific initial symptoms and physical examination findings sometimes make it difficult to diagnose , thus delaying appropriate treatment .
it is a treatable condition with few long - term complications if appropriate treatment is initiated promptly [ 3 , 4 ] .
low awareness of the clinical presentation and lack of knowledge of the diagnostic procedure usually lead to delay in diagnosis [ 2 , 4 ] .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) appears to be the most useful imaging technique in evaluating early and subsequent changes involving the joint [ 5 ] .
it is important to know distinction between infectious and noninfectious sacroiliitis in terms of treatment options .
here , we reported an adult patient who presented with signs , symptoms , and radiologic evidence of unilateral ps that resolved with antibiotic treatment .
in this case , we aimed to show the time course of the ps through mr images from the time of first diagnosis to the treatment .
in this aspect , this is the first case demonstrating the long - term course of ps with mri .
2. case report a 49 - year - old man without significant medical history was admitted to hospital with a 7 - day history of pain in the right hip and buttock , and low - grade fever .
he said his pain began acutely one week ago while sleeping .
the pain was severe , sharp and progressed over the next several hours .
there was no history of trauma .
the radiographs showed no abnormalities in the pelvis and hip .
the patient was treated with suspected infection in the right hip joint and had been given antibiotics ( cefazolin sodium 3 x 500 mg / day plus ciprofloxacin 2 x 500 mg / day ) and anti - inflammatory medications on his discharge from the emergency department .
he was admitted to hospital one week after because of worsening buttock pain and associated lower back pain .
at the time of admission , he had a mild low - grade fever with a peak temperature of 38degreesc , and he reported night sweats .
the right sacroiliac joint showed tenderness on pelvic compression .
right hip flexion , internal , and external rotation was very painful and limited .
the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , and white blood cell ( wbc ) count were 65 mm / h , 228 mg / l , and 8.2 x 109 / l , respectively .
bone scan showed an increased uptake in the right sacroiliac joint .
a rose bengal test for brucellosis was positive and a wright agglutination test titer was > 1 / 320 .
hla - b27 was negative .
blood , urine , and stool cultures were negative .
on mr imaging , mild expansion of the right sacroiliac joint ( sij ) space , along with effusion and bone marrow edema on the joint surfaces indicating active inflammation were detected .
an accompanying increased signal in the iliopsoas muscle neighboring right sacroiliac joint was also detected .
these findings were yielded to the impression of infective sacroiliitis ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the patient was diagnosed as pyogenic sacroiliitis due to brusellosis based on imaging , and clinical and laboratory findings , and he was started on antibiotic therapy with moxifloxacin ( 400 mg daily , for 2,5 months ) , rifampicin ( 600 mg daily for 2.5 months ) , and streptomycin ( 1 g daily , for 21 days ) , along with nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) .
following treatment his symptoms and complaints improved dramatically .
serial mr images were performed to disclose subsequent changes concerning sacroiliac joint and surrounding structures .
three months following the institution of treatment , he had mild pain in the right gluteal region , but no fever and back pain .
acute phase response was within normal limits .
at this time on mr images , the signal intensity of inflammation and contrast enhancement pattern at the subchondral bone and the iliopsoas muscle were detected to be mildly decreased .
six months later , he had only mild pain on right gluteal region .
after that time , the patient received nsaids on as needed basis .
chronic changes ( not shown ) including joint surface irregularity , sclerosis , and fatty infiltration were first observed on mri images obtained at this time .
some active inflammatory changes such as bone marrow edema and contrast enhancement were still observed , yet diminished .
same findings were noticeable on mr images on the twelfth month control as well ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
twenty months following the initial diagnosis , bone marrow edema suggesting acute inflammation around the sacroiliac joint was evident on mr images ( not shown ) .
these findings were the same with twelfth month control .
the patient 's clinical and mri findings and their changes over time were shown in table 1 .
3. discussion pyogenic sacroiliitis is considered to be an uncommon condition and can be seen in patients of any age .
female patients tend to have a higher incidence than do male patients , especially in the elderly [ 2 ] .
the diagnosis of ps requires a degree of clinical suspicion and should be confirmed by imaging methods .
it has been reported that the varied presentation of symptoms and signs of ps were always remote from the site of infection [ 3 ] .
plain radiograms may be normal in early stages of the disease .
in one of the cohort patients with ps , only 63.6 % of the patients presented with the full clinical symptoms typical of ps [ 2 ] .
therefore , it is suggested that physicians should keep a high index of suspicion while evaluating adult patients with atypical presentations .
in the previous series , the blood culture yield rate was low .
however , local synovial fluid cultures had a high yield rate for pathogens [ 2 ] .
synovial fluid aspiration was not universally performed in patients owing to the difficulty in the application of the technique .
in our case , we did not perform sacroiliac joint synovial fluid aspiration .
body fluid cultures did not display any bacterial growth .
although the definitive diagnosis requires bacteria isolation from blood or joint fluid cultures , acute onset , one - sided involvement of the joints , and severe gluteal pain accompanied by high fever as in this case were considered as findings supporting ps. therefore , mr imaging is probably the imaging method of choice to detect ps [ 6 - 8 ] .
it provides a detailed evaluation of the joint and surrounding soft tissues [ 3 , 8 ] .
as in our case , together with clinical findings , unilateral involvement , bone marrow edema adjacent to the sij surfaces and edema in the neighborhood soft tissues help to diagnose and distinguish infectious from noninfectious sacroiliitis ( i.e. , some spondyloarthropathies ) .
after a course of intravenous antibiotics , the symptoms completely resolved , thus supporting our diagnosis of infective sacroiliitis .
mr imaging of sijs has evolved as the most relevant imaging modality for diagnosing early sij changes , particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) .
active inflammatory lesions such as bone marrow edema ( bme )/ osteitis , synovitis , enthesitis , and capsulitis can be detected by mri .
among these , the clear presence of bme / osteitis was considered essential for defining active sacroiliitis .
structural damage lesions such as sclerosis , erosions , fat deposition , and ankylosis can also be detected by mri , which are accepted as chronic changes [ 9 ] .
although the course of mri changes was comprehensively defined for patients having as , little is known for patients with infective sacroiliitis .
in this case , consecutive mris of a 49 - year - old male diagnosed with ps was displayed .
we showed that although clinical findings disappear within three months , the mri findings of suggesting active sacroiliitis did not resolve completely .
even twenty months following the initial diagnosis , bone marrow edema suggesting acute inflammation around the sacroiliac joint was evident on mr images .
interestingly , the patient did not have any complaints at this time ( table 1 ) .
we did not perform histologic evaluation to correlate the imaging and clinical findings .
indeed , there is a lack in the literature concerning infective sacoiliitis and its clinical and histologic findings in the time course .
histology - based studies to match the mr imaging findings were conducted mainly in patients with noninfective sacroiliitis [ 10 , 11 ] .
in one of these studies , despite the findings of positive histopathologic results indicating active inflammation , interestingly , it was reported that no mri findings may be observed [ 10 ] .
in conclusion , our case demonstrated that in patients with infective sacroiliitis , correlation of the clinical and radiological findings might be far from being perfect .
considering this case , it is obvious that radiological recovery takes longer and it would be more appropriate to rely on clinical and laboratory findings instead of radiological images for the followup of those patients .

the transforming growth factor beta ( tgf - beta ) family of growth factors are key regulators of mammalian development and their dysregulation is implicated in human disease , notably , heritable vasculopathies including marfan ( mfs , omim # 154700 ) and loeys - dietz syndromes ( lds , omim # 609192 ) .
we described a syndrome presenting at birth with distal arthrogryposis , hypotonia , bifid uvula , a failure of normal post - natal muscle development but no evidence of vascular disease ; some of these features overlap with mfs and lds .
a de novo mutation in tgfb3 was identified by exome sequencing .
several lines of evidence indicate the mutation is hypomorphic suggesting that decreased tgf - beta signaling from a loss of tgfb3 activity is likely responsible for the clinical phenotype .
this is the first example of a mutation in the coding portion of tgfb3 implicated in a clinical syndrome suggesting tgfb3 is essential for both human palatogenesis and normal muscle growth .

clinical report the proband is a 9 - year - old european - american female born to nonconsanguineous , healthy parents with two older healthy children and no previous miscarriages .
mother was 34 years old and father was 42 at delivery .
no cytogenetic abnormality was observed on chromosome samples obtained at 19 weeks gestation by amniocentesis .
the pregnancy was unremarkable and the mother reported that the fetus moved in utero similarly to older siblings .
the child was born at full term by repeat caesarian ; apgars were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min , respectively .
the birth weight was 2.9 kg ( 5th centile ) , length was 51 cm ( 50th centile ) , and ofc was 35.75 (> 50th centile ) .
the physical exam showed contractures in the right hand , most severe in the 3rd and 4th fingers ( see fig. s1 in supplementary online material ) and all toes .
the digits on the left hand and foot showed minimal contractures .
range of motion of knees , hips , elbows , jaws , and back were considered normal .
hands and feet appeared long and narrow although no measurements were taken .
there was a midline facial nevus flammeus and mild hypotonia .
at age 3 months , the patient was evaluated for failure - to - thrive because of low weight ( 4.2 kg < 5th centile ) and a delay in gross motor function .
an evaluation at 17 months showed that she did not crawl or roll , but could stand with support .
she weighed 7.5 kg (< 1st centile ) and was 76 cm in height ( 5th centile ) ( fig. 1 , left picture ) .
also noted was bilateral pes planus , mild pectus excavatum , hyperextensibility of multiple large joints , and mild retrognathia .
eyes appeared prominent and hypertelorism was present with an outer canthal distance of 7.8 cm and an inner canthal distance of 2.8 cm (> 97th centile ) .
her skin had normal texture , tension , and wound healing .
head circumference was 45 cm ( 25th centile ) with normally placed and well - formed ears .
a bifid uvula with intact hard palate , normal arch , and normal voice quality were present .
a small metopic ridge and normal teeth were observed .
the sclerae were blue .
she had marked contractures at the proximal phalangeal joints of the right second and third digits and toes bilaterally ( r > l ) .
her motor examination revealed decreased bulk in all appendicular and axial muscles , strength 1 / 5 , low tone , and diminished reflexes throughout .
markedly reduced subcutaneous fat was noted .
figure 1 pictures of the proband at ages 17 months , 36 months , and 6 years .
evident at age 17 months are the prominent eyes , hypertelorism , tubular nose , and retrognathia .
evident at age 36 months are a normal ear , retrognathia , and less pronounced hypertelorism .
at age 6 years the inner canthal distance was within normal limits .
the patient could stand independently with a positive gower sign at 20 months , and walked at 24 months in a " hip waddle " fashion .
her neurocognitive development was appropriate for age .
slit lamp examination of both eyes was normal .
radiographic studies of the hands and pelvis showed age - appropriate ossification and bilateral coxa valga deformity , respectively .
at age 3 years , a 3 - year trial of losartan at a dose of up to 2.0 mg / kg / day produced no change in muscle strength or mass ( figs. 1 , middle picture and 2 ) .
at the age seven , she weighed 15.5 kg (< 1st centile ) and was 115 cm ( 5th centile ) in height ; the physical exam was otherwise unchanged .
the skin had normal texture , subcutaneous fat was minimal , and marked hyperextensibility was present in elbows and knees .
no abnormal spinal curvature was evident .
a right quadricep muscle biopsy taken at age 7 years showed normal a checkerboard pattern with type 1 fiber predominance but mild and focal type 1 fiber disproportion consistent with disuse or decreased usage ( type 1 : 47 micro vs. type 2 : 50 micro ) ( see figs. s4 - s7 in supplementary online material ) .
figure 2 picture of the proband at age 30 months with v.a. mckusick , m.d. evident in the proband are the blue sclera , the well - placed and normal ear , tubular nose with metopic ridge , mild hyperterlorism , retrognathia , and hypomalar eminences .
yearly echocardiograms beginning at 18 months showed no cardiac defect or dysfunction .
an echocardiographic examination at the age 6.5 years measured the aortic annulus and aortic root at 1.34 cm ( z score 0.59 ) and 1.72 cm ( z score 0.39 ) , respectively ; the pulmonary artery dimensions were also consistently within the normal range .
visual acuity remained normal .
the proband had physical and occupational therapy since the age 6 months , and has worn orthotic foot appliances since age 2 .
although digit contractures persist , at age 9 she has very functional hands .
methods genomic dna was extracted from peripheral mononuclear blood cells from the proband , two unaffected sibs , and parents .
the details of the exome and sanger sequencing and the xenopus and cultured cell methods are described in supplementary online material .
the focus of the sequence data filtering was for novel non - synonymous variants that were unique .
these included heterozygous novel missense and nonsense substitutions and frame - shifting insertions and deletions ( in / dels ) not detected in other family members .
in addition , we looked for homozygous non - synonymous variants ( missense or nonsense substitutions or frame - shifting in / dels ) where she was the only family member homozygous for the damaging allele , and where both parents were heterozygous .
finally , we looked compound heterozygosity of deleterious alleles in genes associated with heritable disorders of connective tissue .
results the proband shared the clinical feature of low muscle mass with hypotonia with three related conditions : marfan , loeys - dietz , and beals - hecht syndrome ( bhs , omim # 121050 ) .
she was hyperteloric and had a bifid uvula , the two non - vascular findings that define lds ; the skeletal findings typical of mfs included arachnodactyly , pectus excavatum , pes planus , and hyperextensible large joints .
the proposita did not meet the diagnostic criteria established for mfs , bhs or lds .
among the inconsistencies with these diagnoses were significant growth retardation , the absence of cardiovascular findings , and the distinct muscle histopathology .
these three syndromes are allied in their pathophysiology .
tgf - beta signaling is dysregulated in the first two conditions and analogous pathophysiology is suspected in bhs , given the similar functions of fbn1 and fbn2 .
the clinical overlap with these autosomal dominant syndromes and the unaffected status of the parents suggested a de novo mutation acting as a dominant trait in a gene affecting tgf - beta signaling .
analysis of the six genes ( tgfb2 , tgfbr1 , tgfbr2 , smad3 , fbn1 , fbn2 ) associated with mfs , lds , or bhs identified no mutation .
we sought to identify de novo mutations through exome sequencing ; consistent with expectations [ neale et al. , 2012 ] , we found two nucleotide changes unequivocally unique to the proband , in cdh2 and tgfb3 .
a nonsense mutation was found at codon 70 in cdh2 ( c.208c > t , pq70x ) , encoding the 907 amino acid protein cadherin - 2 or n - cadherin .
seventeen cdh2 snvs predicted to be damaging by polyphen are reported in the nhlbi exome variant server ( evs ) database .
in dermal fibroblasts isolated from the proband , the concentration of n - cadherin by western blot was not statistically different from six age - matched , passage - matched controls ( see supplementary online material , fig. s8 ) .
a second de novo mutation was found in tgfb3 ( c.1226g > a ; pc409y ) .
validation by sanger sequencing confirmed that this mutation was de novo in the proband .
no ligand - coding sequence variants have been reported in tgfb3 including dbsnp130 , evs , or the 1000 genomes dataset .
to determine the effect of the cysteine - to - tyrosine substitution on tgfb3 function , we co - transfected an epitope - tagged wild - type ( w - t ) tgfb3 cdna or a similarly tagged tgfb3g1226a cdna under the control of a cmv promoter into 293t cells ( see supplementary online material ) .
conditioned medium ( cm ) was collected , the tagged tgfb3 species purified by immunoprecipitation and the relative tgf - beta signaling activities compared using hela cells transfected with the reporter plasmid , p3tplux , a smad2 - responsive reporter .
figure 3 shows that the wild - type ( w - t ) tgfb3 gene generated a transcriptional tgf - beta signal , whereas the tgfb3g1226a gene construct did not .
we conclude that the mutant allele encodes a tgfb3 ligand that is not functional .
figure 3 tgfb3c409y does not activate tgf - beta signaling .
constructs containing flag - tagged tgfb3wt and tgfb3c409y were expressed in hek293t cells and secreted flag - tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated under native conditions and normalized to anti - flag reactivity .
serial dilutions of these proteins were applied to hek293t cells transfected with p3tp - lux ( tgf - beta reporter ) and prl - cmv ( normalizer ) .
error bars are standard error of the mean ( n = 3 ) .
xenopus embryos provide a sensitive assay system for assessing effects of ectopically expressed proteins on tgf - beta ( smad2 and erk1 / 2 ) and bmp ( smad1 ) signaling .
to examine how tgfb3g1226a altered tgf - beta signaling in xenopus embryos , rna from the w - t human tgfb3 allele and the tgfb3g1226a allele were injected into fertilized xenopus eggs either separately or together using a constant amount of rna from the w - t allele with an increasing amount of rna from the mutant allele .
prospective ectodermal tissue from late blastula embryo was examined by western blot for phosphorylation of smad2 and erk1 / 2 ( psmad2 and perk1 / 2 , respectively ) .
figure 4 shows that rna from the w - t human tgfb3 allele results in a significant increase in psmad2 and perk1 / 2 signals by western blot as expected ( see supplementary online material fig. s9 for controls ) .
the tgfb3 - dependent psmad2 and perk1 / 2 signals are significantly diminished , however , with increasing amounts of the mutant rna relative to wild - type .
a 1:1 ratio of mutant - to - wild - type tgfb3 rna diminished the psmad2 and perk1 / 2 signals to approximately 40 % and 60 % , respectively , of that generated by the w - t tgfb3 rna alone .
gastrula stage embryos require activation of smad1 by endogenous bmp2 / 4 / 7 for normal dorsal - ventral patterning .
ectopic expression of tgfb3g1226a had no effect on either smad1 phosphorylation ( psmad1 ) or dorsal ventral patterning in xenopus gastrulae ( fig. 5 ) .
we conclude that in the frog system the mutant tgfb3g1226a allele , when co - expressed with w - t tgfb3 , has a dominant negative effect on tgf - beta signaling measured by psmad2 and perk1 / 2 , but does not affect signaling by bmp2 / 4 / 7 ligands measured by psmad1 .
figure 4 tgfb3c409y acts as a dominant inhibitor of tgf - beta signaling .
indicated amount of synthetic mrnas were microinjected into xenopus embryos after fertilization , and embryos harvested at stage 9 for western blot analysis .
a representative western blot is shown in a. b - d : quantitation of densitometric analysis of three independent experiments is shown , measuring phosphorylated smad ( psmad2 ) activation ( psmad2 / total smad2 ratio ) , perk activation ( perk / erk ratio ) , and total smad2 , erk , and cytoplasmic actin levels , respectively , following injection of mrnas as indicated .
data are presented with error bars representing standard error of the mean .
for each experiment , the intensity western signal was standardized relative to the wild type tgfb / tgfbr2 co - injected condition ( lane 3 of panels b - d ) .
figure 5 tgfb3c409y does not disrupt bmp signaling during xenopus gastrulation .
indicated amounts of synthetic mrnas for human tgfb3 , tgfb3c409y and xenopus noggin were injected into xenopus laevis embryos to assay perturbations of bmp signaling during gastrulation .
the levels of c - terminal phosphorylated smad1 ( psmad1 ) were examined by immunoblotting .
smad1 and actin were used as loading controls .
pictured in the lower panel are intact embryos ; the bmpr antagonist noggin disrupts gastrulation while tgfb3c409y does not .
discussion the principal clinical concerns for this patient have been growth retardation , weakness related to decreased muscle mass and uncertainty about her risk for vascular disease .
distal arthrogryposis indicative of reduced fetal movement suggested an inborn error of development affecting muscle mass and other developing mesenchymal tissues , including the soft palate .
a muscle biopsy showed essentially normal fiber size and architecture .
there was no evidence of chronic dystrophic or inflammatory changes presenting a strikingly different histologic picture compared to the myopathic findings in congenital or classical mfs in which endomysial thickening , fat deposition , split fibers , fibrosis , and marked fiber size disproportion are consistent histopathological observations .
the phenotypic discordance in the proband - - significant underdevelopment of muscle mass or hypomyoplasia with the absence of abnormal cardiac or aortic findings by age 8 years - - suggests a pathophysiology distinct from that caused by excess tfg - beta signaling observed with fbn1 mutations in mfs .
furthermore , in one mouse model of mfs , muscle mass was normal and there was complete histologic restoration of muscle architecture after treatment with pan - anti - tgfb antibodies or losartan , suggesting that excess tgf - beta signaling in mfs has its major pathological effects on muscle during the post - natal growth phase of muscle development [ cohn et al. , 2007 ] .
the proband had no change in strength or muscle mass after a significant therapeutic trial of losartan , further suggesting a pathophysiology distinct from mutations enhancing tgf - beta signaling .
the proband was heterozygous for two de novo mutations .
the cdh2 levels were not statistically significantly different from control fibroblasts ( see supplementary online material ) .
mice heterozygous for a null mutation in cdh2 were phenotypically normal at 2 years ; specifically , muscle mass was not affected [ garcia - castro et al. , 2000 ] .
we conclude that the proband 's mutation in cdh2 ( c.208c > t ) is unlikely to be driving the clinical phenotype , though we cannot exclude some modifying effects .
the second de novo mutation was tgfb3g1226a , a novel variant occurring in the last exon of tgfb3 .
the mature tgfb3 ligand is a homodimer of the c - terminal 112 amino acids of the tgfb3 mrna translation product [ derynck and miyazono , 2008 ] .
the mutation , tgfb3g1226a , substitutes a tyrosine for a cysteine ( tgfb3c409y ) .
this penultimate cysteine is conserved in all tgfb family member ligands including orthologues in caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster defining a structure called the " cysteine knot " , a conformation essential for normal ligand activity [ daopin et al. , 1992 ; mittl et al. , 1996 ] .
site - directed mutagenesis has established the essentiality of this cysteine in tgfb isoforms [ brunner et al. , 1992 ] .
the tgfb3g1226a allele coded for a ligand with no apparent signaling activity ( fig. 3 ) and the mutant allele , when co - expressed in embryos with the w - t allele , reduced tgf - beta signaling activity to approximately 40 % ( fig. 4 ) .
in the presence of the w - t and mutant allele there was no apparent effect on bmp2 / 4 / 7 signaling ( fig. 5 ) , which is essential for normal skeletal muscle development [ wang et al. , 2010a - 2010b ] .
we conclude that the loss of cys409 in tgfb3 destroys tgfb3 signaling activity and when the mutant ligand is present with the wild - type tgfb3 protein , tgfb signaling is reduced .
based on these biochemical data in the context of the clinical findings , we conclude that the tgfb3 mutation most likely accounts for the clinical findings .
what mechanism might account for hypomyoplasia ?
one pathophysiologic explanation centers on the critical role tgf - beta signaling plays at specific embryonic stages of early mesenchymal development , including myogenesis and palatogenesis involving an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ kalluir and weinberg , 2009 ; pelton et al. , 1990 - 1991 ] .
tgfb3 is essential for palatal confluence [ nawshad and hay , 2003 ; proetzel et al. , 1995 ] and mutations in tgfb3 have been linked to cleft palate .
tgf - beta signaling is also required for normal myogenesis following formation of the paraxial somite , the source of skeletal muscle precursors for myogenesis in the trunk and limbs [ derynck et al. , 2008 ] .
tgfb3 is the most abundant tgfb isoform in developing skeletal muscle [ pelton et al. , 1991 ] .
the dorsal portion of the somites retains an epithelial structure called the dermomyotome which undergoes progressive emt forming myogenic precursors that later generate embryonic skeletal muscle .
partial or incomplete emt may diminish the number of embryonic muscle precursor cells , ultimately reducing post - natal myofibril mass but not affecting muscle architecture .
thus , a deficiency of tgfb3 during early myogenesis could result in hypomyoplasia throughout development that clinically mimics , but is etiologically and histologically distinct from , the myopathy caused by excess tgf - beta signaling found in mfs .
given the role gdf8 ( myostatin ) might play in embryonic muscle development , we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced tgfb3 signaling via its cognate type i receptor ( tgfbr1or alk5 ) allows gdf8 to signal through the same receptor relatively unopposed , effectively enhancing the negative effect myostatin has on muscle precursor cell expansion [ lee et al. , 2004 ; amthor et al. , 2006 ; manceau et al. , 2008 ] .
similarly , given that tgfb3 is reported to induce smad1 / 5 as well as smad2 / 3 phosphorylation , we cannot exclude the possibility that diminished psmad1 / 5 signaling permits premature myocyte differentiation at the expense of expansion of the adult satellite cell population [ daly et al. , 2008 ; ono et al. , 2011 ; lee et al. , 2012 ] .
these possible mechanisms in which tgfb3 might influence muscle development and growth could be operative together ; none are exclusive of the others .
in summary , we describe a clinical syndrome characterized by abnormal development of several mesenchymal - derived tissues including muscle and cranio - palato - facial structures accompanied by low muscle mass , growth retardation , distal arthrogryposis and other secondary changes .
though the proband shares some clinical features with known syndromes that enhance tgf - beta signaling , such as mfs and lds , her findings are clinically distinct [ holm et al. , 2011 ] .
we identified a mutation in tgfb3 and demonstrate in model systems that the altered tgfb3 ligand results in a decrease in canonical and non - canonical tgf - beta signaling , suggesting that the phenotype is a consequence of a hypomorphic allele .
the full phenotypic spectrum and natural history of tgfb3 mutations must await other cases ; we can , however , assert from these observations that the development of normal muscle mass appears to require a minimum of tgfb3 signaling , as does complete palatal fusion .
while loss - of - function mutations in the tgfb2 - tgfbr - smad3 axis appear to enhance tgfb1 or tgfb2 expression in vascular tissue with at times catastrophic consequences , mutations in other components of the pathway , such as tgfb3 may not have the same effects on vascular tissue or developing muscle .
clearly , ligand and tissue - specific factors contribute to the distinct clinical findings that render each syndrome unique .

distribution of size in type 1 and type 2 fibers in representative sections of the proband 's muscle. fig. s8 .
n - cadherin expression levels .
protein expression levels of n - cadherin in whole cell lysate from human skin fibroblasts analyzed by western blot .
b - tubulin was used as a loading control .
values expressed are normalized to loading controls. fig. s9 .
tgfb3 signaling in xenopus embryos .
indicated amount of synthetic mrnas were microinjected into xenopus embryos after fertilization , and embryos harvested at stage 9 forwestern blot analysis .
this representative western blot is shown to indicate that any of the injected synthetic mrnas are not sufficient along to trigger phosphorylation of smad2 .
as seen in figure in the text , human tgfb3 and the tgfbr2 are required together to trigger the phosphorylation of smad2 .

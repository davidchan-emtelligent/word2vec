aims nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are the cornerstone of pain management .
there are no detailed data on nsaids use in poland , especially in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency , circumstances , and causes of nsaids use as well as knowledge of their side - effects in patients with ckd .
method this cross - sectional study was conducted in 972 individuals with ckd , enrolled in a written survey originally developed by the authors .
there were 574 patients with ckd stage i - iv , 414 patients after renal transplantation stage ii - iv ( ckdt ) and 84 dialyzed patients ( 44 peritoneal , 40 hemodialysis ) .
results among the entire study group , 16.9 % of patients used nsaids every day , or several times a week .
the average number of tablets taken within a month was 21.8 .
subgroup analysis revealed that nsaids were taken most often by patients on hemodialysis : 35 % of them used nsaids every day or several times a week ( 43.15 pills per month ) .
the most common reason for using nsaids were bone - joint pain ( 29.3 %) and headache ( 26.2 %) .
side effects of painkillers such as renal function deterioration and the possible promotion of stomach ulcers were experienced by 43.6 and 37.6 % of respondents , respectively .
conclusion patients with ckd often take nsaids .
this applies especially to the group of people undergoing hemodialysis , which is mainly associated with chronic osteo - articular pain .
the results also show a low awareness of painkillers' adverse effects .
keywords chronic kidney disease nsaids pain side effects issue - copyright - statement ( c ) italian society of nephrology 2017 introduction almost 40 % of patients visit primary care providers due to mild to moderate acute pain [ 1 ] .
moreover , about 70 % of emergency departments' interventions are associated with pain complaints [ 2 ] .
in poland , 24 % of the general population , in the case of discomfort or pain , prefer self - treatment using pharmaceuticals , including non - steroid anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , to the doctor 's advice [ 2 ] .
nsaids are mostly available in poland without prescription ( over the counter , otc ) .
reports show also that poland is in the 6th position in europe in terms of otc sales of painkillers [ 3 ] .
nsaids are the cornerstone of pain management in patients who have inflammatory pain , acute pain ( e.g. headache , postoperative pain , and orthopedic fractures ) or chronic pain ( e.g. rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis , and gout ) [ 4 ] .
approximately 70 % of people aged over 65 years use nsaids at least once a week , and half of them take at least 7 doses per week .
both traditional nsaids , and the second generation cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors offer superior efficacy compared with acetaminophen , but they also carry a significant risk for serious gastrointestinal , cardiovascular and renal adverse events [ 5 , 6 ] .
nsaids use has been associated with both acute kidney injury in the general population , and chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) progression in those with chronic nephropathies [ 7 ] .
in addition , nsaids interact unfavorably with some commonly prescribed medications in ckd patients , including loop diuretics , angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors , and angiotensin receptor blockers , leading to their reduced effectiveness along with an increased risk of renal impairment [ 8 ] .
despite these potential adverse effects of nsaids in ckd patients , little is known about the patterns of nsaids use in this population .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency , circumstances , and causes of nsaids' use , as well as knowledge of their side - effects in patients with ckd .
materials and methods a cross - sectional survey study was conducted in the first 6 months of 2014 in patients with ckd who were under the care of the department of nephrology , medical university of gdansk , poland .
this survey was offered to all 1,300 patients who were under the care of the local outpatient unit , and the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis units .
the written survey was originally developed by the authors .
it consisted of 22 questions .
aspirin used in small doses ( i.e. 75 mg ) was excluded from our primary definitions of nsaids because of its relatively low adverse effects rate , and because its use is commonly recommended for the prevention of comorbid cardiovascular complications .
to anyone having difficulty completing the written survey , support was given from students of the medical faculty , medical university of gdansk .
data was evaluated using a statistica ( version 12.0 stat soft inc. ) software package .
the results are presented as mean value +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) , median , interquartile range and numbers or percent frequency , as appropriate .
the quantitative variable differences were assessed by analysis of variance ( anova ) or the non - parametric kruskal - wallis test .
in order to measure the differences in prevalence between selected categories , we used the chi square ( chi2 ) test for the contingency tables .
a p < 0.05 ( two - tailed ) was considered statistically significant .
results a total of 972 individuals ( 74.8 %) responded to the survey .
there were 574 patients with ckd stage i - iv ( all patients with ckd stage v were under renal replacement therapy ) , 314 patients after kidney transplantation ( ckdt ) , and 84 dialyzed patients : 44 peritoneal ( pd ) and 40 hemodialysis ( hd ) .
hypertension , cardiovascular and bone - joint diseases were the most frequent comorbidities of our study population , and occurred in 79 , 27.4 and 21.5 % respectively .
detailed characteristics of the group are presented in tables 1 and 2 .
hemodialysis patients were the oldest compared to the other subgroups ( anova : p < 0.001 ) .

the median number of tablets taken within a month , in persons using nsaids regularly , i.e. every day or a few times a week , was 20 .
use of two nsaids at the same time was reported by 13 % of respondents .
the most common reasons for using nsaids were bone - joint pain ( 29.3 %) , and headache ( 26.2 %) ( table 3 ) .
the decision about taking nsaids was made in 46.71 % of cases by the patients themselves , in 43.41 % by the doctor , and in 9.88 % by a pharmacist .
subgroup analyses revealed that nsaids were taken most often by hemodialysis patients : 17.5 % of them took pills every day , and 17.5 % used nsaids a few times a week ( fig. 1 ) .
the median number of nsaids taken within a month in the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients who used nsaids regularly , i.e. every day or a few times a week , was 30 and 32.5 tablets , respectively ( fig. 2 ). fig. 1 the frequency of use of nsaids in subgroups .

the most common side - effects of nsaids such as a possible deterioration of renal function , peptic ulcer disease ( pud ) , and impairment of blood pressure control were known by 43.6 , 37.6 and 18.2 % of respondents , respectively .
the patients who themselves decided to use nsaids derived their knowledge about these drugs from the media ( 72.5 %) , friends ( 15.0 %) and pharmacists ( 12.5 %) .
subgroup analysis revealed that knowledge about potential deterioration of renal function by nsaids was greatest among pd patients ( chi2 test : p < 0.01 ) , while knowledge about promotion of stomach ulcers was greatest among hd patients ( chi2 test : p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 the knowledge of the adverse effects of analgesics in subgroups .

** chi2 test p < 0.001 ( difference between study subgroups : ckd 1 - 4 vs. ckdt vs. hd vs. pd ) discussion ckd patients seem to be particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of the side - effects of nsaids , in particular , to the adverse effects of nsaids on blood pressure control , decreased renal blood flow , and promotion of pud [ 7 ] .
the prevalence of hypertension may be as high as 90 % in the ckd population. through a variety of mechanisms related to prostaglandin inhibition , including sodium retention and vasoconstriction , nsaids may increase blood pressure .
nsaids have been shown to produce a clinically significant increment in mean blood pressure by 5 mmhg , most marked in patients with controlled hypertension [ 9 ] .
the incidence of pud in patients with ckd is 10 to 12 times higher than in patients without ckd .
in particular , pud affects chronically hemodialyzed persons .
one of the most important risk factors for the development of pud and its complications is the use of nsaids [ 9 ] .
nsaids use is also associated with a threefold greater risk for acute renal failure compared to non - nsaids use , after adjusting for age , sex , body mass index , and several comorbidities [ 6 ] .
in addition , nsaids may cause deterioration in renal function in patients with ckd especially in those treated with renin angiotensin system blockers , or with episodes of hypotension [ 10 , 11 ] .
this may be particularly dangerous for renal transplant recipients , or patients with stage ckd ii - iv. given all these facts , it is not surprising that knowledge concerning the use of nsaids in ckd patients is of great importance .
the study showed that approximately 17 % of patients with ckd , and more than one - third of the hd patients , use nsaids daily or several times a week .
among them , up to 13 % of patients reported using two different drugs at the same time .
the percentage of pd patients taking nsaids regularly is low .
nevertheless , those who take medications regularly use them in large quantities comparable to the number of tablets used by hd patients .
this , despite the fact that the awareness of the side - effects of nsaids is relatively large in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis .
these data seem to be a real cause for concern .
the current use of nsaids , particularly those available otc , is lower in the us ckd population , in whom approximately 5 % of patients with moderate to severe ckd took nsaids regularly [ 12 ] .
in the north west adelaide health study ( nwahs ) in 2004 - 2006 , a longitudinal representative population study from australia , 16 % of patients with ckd were using nsaids regularly [ 13 ] .
nsaids were highly prescribed in ckd patients from the general population of southern italy .
the general practice " arianna " database containing data from 158,510 persons , registered with 123 general practitioners ( gps ) showed that 35.6 % of ckd patients were treated with nsaids for periods exceeding 90 days [ 14 ] .
the most common reason for starting therapy with nsaids in ckd patients is the occurrence of osteoarthrosis , rheumatoid arthritis , ckd - mineral and bone disorders , or arthralgia [ 10 , 17 ] .
pain , as an everyday complaint , is reported to be a very common problem in these comorbidities .
pain may be also a direct result of the hemodialysis procedure , and is reported by 40 - 50 % of hd patients [ 15 ] .
it refers to muscle cramps , pain related to needles and catheters used in dialysis , painful syndromes such as calciphylaxis , nephrogenic sclerosing fibrosis , and dialysis - related amyloidosis [ 16 ] .
the results of our study are consistent with these facts .
bone - joint diseases were very frequent among the study respondents , and occurred in 21.5 % of the entire population , and in as many as 52.5 % of hd patients .
they were also the most common reason for nsaids use in our study .
the wide and easy availability of otc medicines has led to an uncritical use of these agents in poland , where 52 % of the general population consider that the use of otc drugs including nsaids is safe [ 3 ] .
in 46 % of cases , people before taking these agents do not read the accompanying leaflet , or do so only sporadically [ 3 ] .
half of them choose a drug based only on advertising in the media , or on the opinion of family and friends [ 2 ] .
the results of our study indicate that the situation is similar also in ckd patients .
the decision about nsaids is taken in 46.7 % of cases by the patients themselves , and as many as 54.1 % do not reflect on their possible side - effects .
simultaneously , the knowledge about the side - effects of nsaids is not very high , ranging from 18 to 46 % depending on the specific issue .
interestingly , awareness of the side - effects of nsaids is greatest among patients undergoing hemodialysis .
despite this , the consumption of nsaids is the highest in this group .
it may indicate that bone - disease problems are a very important , and still unsolved , issue. of great concern , awareness about the risks arising from the use of nsaids is particularly poor in patients after renal transplantation .
only 19 and 40 % of them were aware that use of nsaids could lead to a possible deterioration of blood pressure control or of graft function , respectively .
given these facts , specific education is urgently required in this population .
intervention strategies to improve the prescribing pattern in ckd patients should be also targeted to gps and pharmacists , who often recommend nsaids in this specific population [ 14 ] .
conclusions patients with ckd quite often take nsaids .
this applies especially to patients undergoing hemodialysis , where nsaid use is mainly associated with their chronic osteo - articular complaints .
in addition , our findings show a low awareness of the adverse side - effects nsiads , which is especially alarming in patients after renal transplantation .

background microrna - 146a ( mir - 146a ) was a key negative regulator of autoimmunity .
v - ets oncogene homolog 1 ( ets - 1 ) was demonstrated to bind to the mir - 146a promoter region and markedly affects mir - 146a promoter activity .
this study aimed to investigate the association of mir - 146a and ets - 1 gene polymorphisms with pediatric uveitis in a han chinese population .
methodology / principal findings a total of 520 patients and 1204 healthy controls were included in the present study .
five single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , mir - 146a / rs2910164 , mir - 146a / rs57095329 , mir - 146a / rs6864584 , ets - 1 / rs1128334 and ets - 1 / rs10893872 were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism assay .
the expression of ets - 1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from genotyped healthy controls was tested by real - time pcr .
two snps ( rs2910164 and rs10893872 ) were associated with pediatric uveitis in this study .
the frequencies of the rs2910164 gg genotype and g allele were significantly increased ( pc = 3.11x10 - 4 ; pc = 2.75x10 - 6 ) while the cc genotype and c allele were significantly decreased ( pc = 0.001 ; pc = 2.75x10 - 6 ) in patients compared with normal controls .
the frequencies of the rs10893872 cc genotype and c allele were significantly increased ( pc = 3.89x10 - 4 ; pc = 0.01 ) while the ct genotype and t allele were significantly decreased ( pc = 0.004 ; pc = 0.01 ) in patients compared with normal controls .
the snp rs2910164 gg genotype and g / c allele were also associated with the presence of microvascular leakage as detected by fundus fluorescein angiography in pediatric uveitis ( pc = 0.01 ; pc = 0.005 , respectively ) .
ets - 1 expression in rs10893872 cc carriers was significantly higher than in ct and tt individuals ( pc = 0.013 ) .
there was no association of the other three snps with pediatric uveitis .
conclusions this study shows that mir - 146a and ets - 1 are both associated with pediatric uveitis in han chinese .
snp rs10893872 may affect the genetic predisposition to pediatric uveitis by modulating expression of ets - 1 .

introduction uveitis is a potentially sight threatening disease and one of the important causes of blindness in the world .
it may occur due to an infection or may be due to an autoimmune etiology [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
children account for 5 %~ 10 % of all uveitis patients [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
although uveitis is less common in children than in adults , patients with pediatric uveitis more often develop serious complications such as cataract and glaucoma that result in visual loss [ 4 ] .
epidemiologic studies indicate that idiopathic uveitis ( 28.8 %) is the most common subtype of pediatric uveitis , followed by juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( jia ) - associated uveitis ( 20.9 %) and pars planitis ( 17.1 %) [ 6 ] .
fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) , rheumatoid factor ( rf ) and anti - nuclear antibody ( ana ) are considered as important markers for pediatric uveitis [ 7 ] .
genetic factors have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of pediatric uveitis and a study of 316 caucasian children demonstrated that human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) - a19 , hla - b22 and hla - dr9 increased the susceptibility of jia - associated uveitis whereas hla - dr1 was protective for uveitis development [ 8 ] .
other hla alleles have also been reported to be associated with jia - associated uveitis such as hla - drw5 , hla - drb1 * 1104 , hla - drb1 * 1301 [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
it is suggested that the genetic factors play important role in pediatric uveitis and investigating proper genetic factors is imperative for pediatric uveitis .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are endogenous ~ 22 nt non - coding rna molecules that function as negative regulators by targeting mrnas for cleavage or translational repression , playing critical roles in diverse biologic processes , such as infection , immune response , inflammation and tumorigenesis [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
the microrna - 146a ( mir - 146a ) was reported as a negative regulator of innate immunity in systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) patients and a key negative regulator of inflammation [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
it was also indicated to be a vital regulator during viral infection [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
the ets1 transcription factor is a member of the ets gene family and is highly conserved throughout evolution .
it is known to regulate a number of important biological processes in normal cells and in tumors and associated with regulation of immune cell function and with an aggressive behavior in tumors [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
moreover , ets1 can bind to the mir - 146a promoter region and markedly affects mir - 146a promoter activity in vitro .
knockdown of ets - 1 impaired the induction of mir - 146a , whereas overexpression of ets - 1 enhanced the induction of mir - 146a [ 21 ] .
single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , located either in the pre - mirnas or within mirna - binding sites , have been shown to affect mirna target expression , thereby possibly contributing to disease susceptibility [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
luo et al. identified 12 variants of mir - 146a , 9 of which were already reported in the dbsnp database build 130 [ 21 ] .
three variants of these 9 had a minor allele frequency ( maf )> 1 % ( rs2910164 , rs57095329 , and rs6864584 ) .
a recent study showed that snps rs1128334 and rs10893872 located in the 3'utr of ets - 1 were on putative mirna binding sites and were both associated with sle in asian populations [ 22 ] .
considering the role of mir - 146a in the development of autoimmune diseases and the role of ets - 1 as a regulator of mir - 146a expression , we investigated the association of mir - 146a / rs2910164 , mir - 146a / rs57095329 , mir - 146a / rs6864584 , ets - 1 / rs1128334 and ets - 1 / rs10893872 with pediatric uveitis in a han chinese population .
we showed a significant association between both mir - 146a and ets - 1 gene polymorphisms and pediatric uveitis in our study population .
materials and methods study population the study group comprised 520 consecutive han chinese pediatric uveitis patients and 1204 unselected , consecutive , ethnically and geographically matched normal controls .
the blood samples of patients and controls were obtained from the uveitis study center of the sun yat - sen university ( guangzhou , p.r. china ) and the first affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university ( chongqing , p.r. china ) .
pediatric uveitis was defined as uveitis first occurring in a child under 16 years old .
children with behcet 's disease , vogt - koyanagi - harada syndrome or with definite infectious uveitis were excluded .
jia was defined as arthritis of unknown etiology presenting in children younger than 16 years old and persisting for at least 6 weeks according to the criteria of international league of associations for rheumatology [ 23 ] .
the study was approved by the local ethics research committee of the first affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university .
the written informed consent from the guardians on the behalf of minor participants and adult subjects involved in the study were obtained .
we adhered to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki during all procedures of this study .
clinical and laboratory observations pediatric uveitis patients underwent a uveitis screening protocol encompassing ana ( n = 34 ; positive rate was 17.8 %) , rf ( n = 32 ; positive rate was 15.5 %) , and ffa ( n = 192 ; microvascular leakage rate detected by ffa was found in 62.1 % of tested patients ) .
an ana titer above 1:100 and an rf level above 20.0 iu / ml were considered positive .
ffa was considered a positive result when dye leakage from a retinal vessel was observed .
all these tests were performed in the first affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university ( chongqing , p.r. china ) .
dna extraction and genotyping genomic dna of patients and healthy controls was extracted by the qiaamp dna blood mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
amplification of the target dna sequence was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and the primers used herein are shown in table 1 .
each pcr reaction was carried out in a 10 microl reaction volume containing 5 microl premix taq ( ex taq version ; takara biotechnology co. ltd. , dalian , china ) , 20 pmol primers , 0.2 microg genomic dna and proper sterile purified water .
genotyping of the five tested snps was carried out by pcr - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) analysis .
pcr products were digested with 2 u of restriction enzymes which are listed in table 1 .
the digestion products were separated on 4 % agarose gels and stained with goldview ( sbs genetech beijing , china ) .
moreover , 10 % of the samples were randomly selected to confirm the pcr - rflp results using direct sequencing ( invitrogen biotechnology co. , guangzhou , china ) .

rna extraction and real - time rcr peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were isolated from venous blood of healthy controls by ficoll - hypaque density - gradient centrifugation .
total rna was extracted from pbmcs using trizol ( invitrogen , san diego , california , usa ) , and then it was reverse transcribed by transcriptase kit ( applied biosystems , abi , foster city , california , usa ) .
real - time pcr was performed to detect the quantity of ets - 1 mrna using the applied biosystems 7500 real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) with the following primers ets - 1f : 5 ' - gcagccagtcatctttcaacagcc - 3 ' ; ets - 1r : 5 ' - tcagcacggtcccgcacata - 3 ' .
the beta - actin ( beta - actinf : 5 ' - ggatgcagaaggagatcactg - 3 ' beta - actinr : 5 ' - cgatccacacggagtacttg - 3 ') and gapdh ( f : 5 ' - gggtgtgaaccatgagaagt - 3 ' ; r : 5 ' - ggcatggactgtggtcatga - 3 ') were chosen as dual internal reference genes to normalize the expression of ets - 1 .
relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 - deltadeltact method .
statistical analysis a hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) calculation was performed to ensure a balance in genotype and allele distribution between patients and normal controls .
hwe was tested in the subjects using the chi2 test .
genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls by chi2 test using spss version 17.0 ( spss , inc. , chicago , il ) .
the p values were corrected ( pc ) with the bonferroni correction by multiplying with the number of analyses performed .
the odds ratio ( or ) was used to determine whether a particular snp is a risk factor for pediatric uveitis patients , and to compare the magnitude of various snps for pediatric uveitis patients ( or = 1 : exposure does not affect odds of pediatric uveitis ; or > 1 : exposure associated with higher odds of pediatric uveitis ; or < 1 : exposure associated with lower odds of pediatric uveitis ) [ 24 ] .
the independent - samples t test was used to compare ets - 1 expression among three genotype groups .
p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant .
results clinical features of pediatric uveitis patients and normal controls detailed clinical findings of the enrolled pediatric uveitis patients and normal controls were presented in table 2 .
age and gender distribution in pediatric uveitis patients and normal controls were also described in table 2 .
only category of jia - associated uveitis ( n = 70 ) can be confirmed in our study .
other cases cannot be confirmed in which category of pediatric uveitis .

genotype and allele frequencies of snps in patients and controls a total of 5 snps of mir - 146a and ets - 1 were successfully genotyped in 520 pediatric uveitis patients and 1204 normal controls .
the distribution of genotype frequencies of 5 snps were accorded with hwe in the controls .
altogether we found two snps ( rs2910164 and rs10893872 ) that were associated with pediatric uveitis ( table 3 ) .
the frequencies of the rs2910164 cc genotype and c allele in pediatric uveitis patients were significantly lower than that in normal controls ( p = 8.93x10 - 5 , pc = 0.001 , or = 0.646 ; p = 5.50x10 - 7 , pc = 2.75x10 - 6 , or = 0.686 , respectively ) .
while the frequencies of the rs2910164 gg genotype and g allele were significantly higher in pediatric uveitis patients compared to normal controls ( p = 2.07x10 - 5 , pc = 3.11x10 - 4 , or = 1.773 ; p = 5.50x10 - 7 , pc = 2.75x10 - 6 , or = 1.457 , respectively ) .
in snp rs10893872 , the frequencies of the cc genotype and c allele were significantly increased ( p = 2.59x10 - 5 , pc = 3.89x10 - 4 , or = 1.582 ; p = 0.002 , pc = 0.01 , or = 1.259 ) in patients compared to controls while the ct genotype and t allele were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls ( p = 2.63x10 - 4 , pc = 0.004 , or = 0.680 ; p = 0.002 , pc = 0.01 , or = 0.794 ) .
there was no statistically significant difference concerning the genotype and allele of the other three snps between pediatric uveitis patients and controls ( table 3 ) .

we subsequently studied the associations of the 5 snps with clinical and laboratory observations of pediatric uveitis including ffa , rf and ana .
an association was found between rs2910164 and patients with microvascular leakage as detected by ffa ( ffa +) .
the gg genotype and g allele frequencies of rs2910164 were significantly increased in ffa + patients compared to controls ( p = 6.84x10 - 4 , pc = 0.01 , or = 1.899 ; p = 9.41x10 - 4 , pc = 0.005 , or = 1.441 ) while the c allele frequency was significantly decreased ( p = 9.41x10 - 4 , pc = 0.005 , or = 0.694 ) ( table 4 ) .
no statistically significant association was found between the other four snps and ffa + patients .
moreover , there was no statistically significant association between the five snps and patient groups that were subdivided according to their rf or ana status or whether they had jia or not ( data not shown ) .

the influence of rs10893872 on ets - 1 expression because a significant association was found between snp rs10893872 and pediatric uveitis patients , we further tested the expression of ets - 1 in pbmcs obtained from 32 healthy individuals with a known genotype for this snp .
the mean expression of ets - 1 in cc carriers was 1.39 - fold higher than that in ct and tt carriers ( p = 0.013 ) ( figure 1 ) .

data are shown as mean +/ - sd. discussion in the present study , we investigated the association of five snps of mir - 146a and the transcription factor ets - 1 with pediatric uveitis patients in a chinese han population .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to investigate the possible associations of mir - 146a and ets - 1 polymorphisms with pediatric uveitis .
it was found that rs2910164 of mir - 146a and rs10893872 of ets - 1 were both associated with pediatric uveitis .
the expression of ets - 1 in individuals carrying the rs10893872 cc genotype was increased compared to the ct and tt genotype , suggesting a functional explanation for the observed association .
the frequencies of the rs2910164 cc genotype and c allele were significantly decreased in patients as compared to normal controls while the gg genotype and g allele were significantly increased .
it was suggested that mir - 146a might be a susceptibility factor for pediatric uveitis .
recently , we studied the mir - 146a rs2910164 polymorphisms in acute anterior uveitis patients with ankylosing spondylitis and found a similar association as shown in the present work for pediatric uveitis patients [ 25 ] .
several similar results were also reported in ocular behcet 's disease [ 26 ] , asthma [ 27 ] and various types of carcinoma [ 28 ] - [ 30 ] .
nevertheless , three snps of mir - 146a / rs2910164 , ets - 1 / rs1128334 , and ets - 1 / rs10893872 were genotyped in han chinese patients with fuchs uveitis syndrome ( fus ) , and no significant difference could be found between patients and the normal controls [ 31 ] .
this is different with results found herein .
moreover , afunctional analysis performed in our previous study showed that carriers of the protective cc genotype showed a decreased expression of mir - 146a and certain proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 17 , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta [ 26 ] .
these results suggest that the rs2910164 cc genotype and c allele and gg genotype and g allele are common predisposing factors for pediatric uveitis despite the fact that the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cancer and pediatric uveitis are totally different .
we also identified an association between snp rs10893872 of ets - 1 and pediatric uveitis in the present study .
the cc genotype and c allele frequencies of this snp were significantly increased in patients compared to controls while the frequencies of the ct genotype and t allele were significantly decreased , indicating that the cc genotype and c allele were predisposing factors for pediatric uveitis .
based on this association , we further designed a study to investigate whether this snp ( rs10893872 ) affected the expression of ets - 1 .
our study demonstrated that the ets - 1 expression was significantly upregulated in healthy individuals carrying the cc genotype of rs10893872 .
we performed this assay in healthy individuals since immunosuppressive treatment in the patient group could possibly alter gene expression .
snp rs10893872 of ets - 1 was found to be highly associated with sle [ 22 ] , [ 32 ] .
differently , there was no significant association of snp rs10893872 of ets - 1 found in ocular behcet 's disease , vogt - koyanagi - harada syndrome , and fuchs uveitis syndrome in chinese han patients with previous works [ 26 ] , [ 31 ] .
the transcription factor ets - 1 , originally discovered as an oncogene ( v - ets ) within the genome of the avian leukemia virus [ 33 ] , shows a dual nature in autoimmune diseases [ 34 ] .
it was reported to be overexpressed in rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) synovial membrane and to be involved in the destructive pathway of ra [ 35 ] .
nevertheless , the expression of ets - 1 in sle was lower in pbmcs as compared with that of healthy subjects [ 36 ] .
ets - 1 also plays important roles in regulating the differentiation of t helper cell subsets , cytotoxic t cells , b cells and other cell types , and controlling the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes in a wide variety of different cellular contexts [ 37 ] .
the regulatory t cell ( treg ) lineage is a key player maintaining peripheral self - tolerance and modulating almost any type of immune responses .
julia k. polansky et. al. have proposed that ets - 1 binds to the cpg - rich treg specific demethylated region only in its demethylated state , thereby restricting stable foxp3 expression to the treg lineage [ 38 ] .
concerning the important roles of ets - 1 , the increased frequency of the rs10893872 cc genotype in patients and the increased expression of ets - 1 in cc genotype carriers suggest that ets - 1 is a predisposing factor in pediatric uveitis .
it is worthwhile to mention that there are several limitations in the present study .
the sample of patients in our study is relatively small and only han chinese cohorts are included .
therefore , the results observed in this study need to be confirmed using a large sample size and should include other ethnic populations .
we have not investigated whether the snp rs10893872 influencing ets - 1 expression can also affect the production of cytokines importantly involved in pediatric uveitis development .
further studies are needed to clarify this issue .
in conclusion , our study has identified the associations of rs2910164 ( mir - 146a ) and rs10893872 ( ets - 1 ) with pediatric uveitis .
furthermore , our study has suggested that snp rs10893872 may affect the genetic predisposition to this disease possibly through modulating the expression of ets - 1 .

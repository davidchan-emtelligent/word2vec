pneumonic plague is the most rapid and lethal form of yersinia pestis infection .
increasing evidence suggests that y. pestis employs multiple levels of innate immune evasion and / or suppression to produce an early " pre - inflammatory " phase of pulmonary infection , after which the disease is highly inflammatory in the lung and 100 % fatal .
in this study , we show that il - 1beta / il - 18 cytokine activation occurs early after bacteria enter the lung , and this activation eventually contributes to pulmonary inflammation and pathology during the later stages of infection .
however , the inflammatory effects of il - 1beta / il - 1 - receptor ligation are not observed during this first stage of pneumonic plague .
we show that y. pestis also activates the induction of il - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) , and this activation likely contributes to the ability of y. pestis to establish the initial pre - inflammatory phase of disease .
author summary inhalation of respiratory droplets containing yersinia pestis results in a rapidly developing and lethal pneumonia .
interestingly , early interactions between y. pestis and host cells in the lung contribute to significant immune evasion , but also ultimately result in severe innate immune activation .
our results demonstrate that y. pestis activates pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 1beta and il - 18 in the lung early during infection .
however , there is very little early pulmonary inflammation while y. pestis continues to multiply in the lung compartment .
we show that the host protein il - 1ra is activated concurrently with il - 1beta , attenuating early immune activation by this cytokine .
we propose that this allows the organism to replicate to high titers , eventually triggering a vigorous inflammatory response and facilitating aerosol transmission .
therefore , evaluating early host activation of il - 1ra by y. pestis may provide therapeutic targets against pneumonic plague .

introduction the innate immune system plays an integral role in controlling microbial infection , providing the first layer of defense against invading pathogens and incorporating multiple levels of threat detection .
sentinel cells such as macrophages and neutrophils use pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that detect pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) , which are common microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) and peptidoglycan .
two major classes of prrs are toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) and nod - like receptors ( nlrs ) .
prr - mediated recognition of microbial ligands leads to the secretion of pro - inflammatory signals that curtail the growth and spread of pathogenic microbes at the initial sites of infection .
recognition of pamps by cell surface or endosomal tlrs results in the activation of pro - inflammatory cytokines including type 1 interferons , il - 6 , tnfalpha , il - 1beta and il - 18 .
pamps that penetrate the host cell cytoplasm are detected by nlrs such as nlrp1 , nlrp3 , nlrc4 , aim2 , nlrc5 , naip proteins , and nlrp12 [ 1 - 7 ] .
intracellular detection of pamps leads to the formation of a complex of proteins known as the " inflammasome. " inflammasome assembly leads to activation of caspase 1 , and ultimately results in the processing and secretion of tlr - primed cytokines il - 1beta and il - 18 .
secreted il - 1beta and il - 18 bind to receptors expressed on the surface of most cells in the body , which leads to cellular nfkappab activation and additional pro - inflammatory cytokine production .
the ability of a pathogen to successfully establish infection often relies upon its evasion and / or suppression of these multi - layered immune detection systems .
yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague .
pneumonic plague is a rapidly progressing , severe pulmonary infection that can be transmitted by aerosol , leading to the classification of y. pestis as a tier 1 select agent .
work by our group and others have characterized the progression of pneumonic plague using both inbred and outbred mouse models of infection [ 8,9 ] .
the syndrome manifested in mice closely mirrors human infection , and thus represents an appropriate model for discriminating both microbial and host mediators of disease .
pneumonic plague presents as two distinct phases of disease : an extended " pre - inflammatory " phase during which bacterial replication occurs in the absence of discernible disease symptoms or inflammatory responses , and a subsequent " pro - inflammatory " phase characterized by the onset of symptoms , dramatic increases in lung cytokines , neutrophils , and inflammatory lung pathology .
the delayed appearance of symptoms combined with the short time course of disease is a major clinical challenge , and the narrow window for effective antibiotic treatment is largely responsible for mortality rates approaching 100 % [ 10 ] .
inflammasome activation is important during bacterial infection as it induces pyroptotic cell death , and can determine the course of host inflammatory responses to invading pathogens .
it has been shown that yersinia species are able to trigger inflammasome activation , and that yersinia effector proteins can inhibit this activation as well as its downstream effects [ 1,5,11 - 13 ] .
we sought to evaluate inflammasome activation in our murine infection model of pneumonic plague to determine if this process is inhibited to facilitate the " immunologically silent " pre - inflammatory phase of disease .
in the work presented here , we show that inflammasome activation occurs early during pneumonic plague and ultimately contributes to progression into the pro - inflammatory phase of disease .
further , we suggest that y. pestis induction of host il - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) is a potential mechanism to maintain the pre - inflammatory state despite inflammasome activation , thus allowing for undeterred bacterial replication in the lung .
results activation of il - 1beta / il - 18 cytokines occurs early during pneumonic plague to examine il - 1beta / il - 18 activation during y. pestis pulmonary infection , we first monitored il - 1beta in the lungs of infected mice at various times during the pre - inflammatory phase of disease .
both unprocessed and secreted forms of il - 1beta protein were observed as early as 6 hpi and persisted through 24 hpi , as confirmed by western blot and elisa analysis of whole lung homogenates ( fig. 1a,b ) .
similar results were observed for il - 18 induction , albeit with a delayed time of activation ( s1 fig ) .
this is surprising , as we ( and others ) have demonstrated a notable lack of pro - inflammatory cytokine induction early during pulmonary y. pestis infection [ 8,9,14 ] .
these data indicate that il - 1beta / il - 18 activation in the lung occurs at least 30 hours before any other signs of inflammation in pneumonic plague .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004688.g001 fig 1 yersinia pestis type iii injectisome activates il - 1beta and il - 18 cytokines early during lung infection. a. il - 1beta western blot analysis performed on total lung homogenate harvested at 6 , 12 , and 24 hpi with ld100 infection of y. pestis strain co92 , compared to uninfected mice. b. il - 1beta elisa performed on total lung homogenates harvested at 6 and 24 hpi. c. bacterial burdens from lungs of mice 24 hpi with 104 cfu / mouse with the strains mentioned ( denoted by t3ss ) or parent stain ( unlabeled ). d. il - 1beta elisa performed on total lung homogenates harvested at 24 hpi with with the strains mentioned .

the bacterial type iii secretion system ( t3ss ) has been shown to play a role in il - 1beta / il - 18 cytokine activation for a number of pathogens , including yersinia species [ 1,4,15,16 ] .
in some cases aberrant secretion of t3ss components was responsible , and for some organisms insertion of the secretion apparatus itself initiated activation of il - 1beta / il - 18 cytokines [ 4 ] .
we sought to investigate the requirement of this system for activation of il - 1beta in response to infection with y. pestis .
to this end , we tested whether y. pestis carrying the genes encoding the injection apparatus but lacking the yop effector proteins ( designated as co92 deltapgm delta1234 ) was able to activate il - 1beta during pneumonic plague .
il - 1beta protein was observed in mouse total lung homogenates at 24 hpi with the parent co92 deltapgm and co92 deltapgm delta1234 strains , but much less il - 1beta was seen in animals infected with the co92 deltapgm pcd1 - strain lacking the t3ss genes ( fig. 1c ) .
this was not due to differential microbial replication , as mean bacterial burdens were relatively equivalent between the three groups ( fig. 1d ) .
we have previously reported that y. pestis preferentially targets alveolar macrophages for injection of type iii effectors within the lung at early times during infection [ 17 ] .
we therefore recapitulated this phenomenon in vitro with infection of bmdms .
our results confirmed that y. pestis induces il - 1beta secretion via a mechanism that requires an intact t3ss ( s2 fig ) .
these data demonstrate that the type iii secretion apparatus is required for optimal y. pestis - mediated activation of il - 1beta .
further , this activation occurred in the absence of all of the yop effector proteins , indicating that the needle apparatus itself is sufficient for activating il - 1beta during pneumonic plague .
inflammasome activation contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonic plague in a tlr4 / nlrc4 - dependent manner il - 1beta and il - 18 secretion is a key marker of inflammasome assembly and activation .
inflammasome activation is an important mediator of host inflammatory responses and has been shown to be important to controlling infection with a number of pathogens , primarily through the secretion of il - 1beta and il - 18 [ 5,18 - 20 ] .
to determine if il - 1beta and il - 18 activation plays a role in controlling y. pestis infection , we infected il - 1beta / il - 18 - / - and wild - type c57bl / 6 mice with a lethal dose ( 104 cfu ) of fully virulent y. pestis strain co92 and monitored survival , bacterial burden and lung histopathology .
in addition , we infected caspase 1 - / - mice to investigate the role of inflammasome activation in controlling y. pestis infection .
mice lacking either caspase 1 or the inflammasome cytokines il - 1beta and il - 18 demonstrated extended survival compared to wild - type c57bl / 6 mice ( fig. 2a ) , suggesting that il - 1beta and il - 18 , and likely inflammasome activation , contribute to the rapid mortality seen during pneumonic plague .
this is surprising , as we expected that the absence of il - 1beta and il - 18 cytokine activation might accelerate time - to - death due to the impairment of this frontline innate immune defense mechanism .
in addition , mice lacking caspase 1 or mice lacking il - 1beta and il - 18 had markedly decreased symptoms of respiratory distress in response to y. pestis infection .
this was not due to differences in bacterial numbers , since bacterial burdens within the lungs of wild - type mice , mice deficient in caspase 1 , and mice deficient in il - 1beta / il - 18 were equivalent ( fig. 2b ) .
h & e staining of lungs from caspase 1 - deficient mice or il - 1beta / il - 18 - deficient mice demonstrated decreased inflammatory lesion formation compared to wild - type mice ( fig. 2c,d ) .
these data suggest that caspase 1 - mediated il - 1beta and il - 18 activation contributes to the severe lung pathology and enhanced mortality seen during pneumonic plague , but does not contribute to host control and / or clearance of y. pestis during pneumonic plague .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004688.g002 fig 2 il - 1beta / il - 18 cytokine activation contributes to pathology of pneumonic plague. a. a survival analysis was performed comparing wild - type ( n = 8 ) , caspase 1 - / - ( n = 15 ) and il - 1beta / il - 18 - / - ( n = 12 ) mice ( on c57bl / 6 background ) after ld100 infection ( 104 cfu / mouse ) of y. pestis strain co92. b. total lung burden ( cfu / lung ) at 48 hpi after ld100 infection with y. pestis strain co92. c. fixed h & e stained lung sections from mice at 48 hpi. d. inflammation from histopathology sections was quantified as described in methods .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.001 .
inflammasome complex assembly is described as a two - signal system : the primary signal requires tlr activation that leads to transcription of pro - il - 1beta and il - 18 , whereas the secondary signal requires detection of microbial ligands by nlrs to assemble the nlr / asc / caspase 1 complex that proteolytically cleaves and activates the pro - forms of il - 1beta and il - 18 for secretion .
the decreased inflammation seen in caspase 1 - / - mice indicates that inflammasome activation contributes to the progression of pneumonic plague .
to identify the host signals responsible for y. pestis activation of the inflammasome , we inoculated macrophages derived from tlr2 - / - , tlr4 - / - and myd88 - / - mice with the fully virulent strain y. pestis co92 .
tlr2 recognizes a variety of pamps including peptidoglycan and lipoproteins , the tlr4 receptor recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , and myd88 serves as a common intermediate signaling protein downstream of most tlrs .
we observed that il - 1beta secretion is not dependent on tlr2 , but requires the presence of tlr4 and myd88 ( s3a fig ) .
these data were confirmed in tlr4 - / - mice inoculated with y. pestis : il - 1beta production ( fig. 3a ) as well as down - stream pulmonary inflammation ( fig. 3b ) both indicated that tlr4 contributes to il - 1beta secretion in vivo .
also , though recent studies have shown that some microbial / host cell interactions lead to a caspase 1 - independent il - 1beta activation , we observed that caspase 1 is necessary for early il - 1beta activation ( fig. 3c )[ 21,22 ] .
these data indicate that y. pestis secretes il - 1beta via tlr4 and caspase 1 - dependent mechanisms .
this is interesting , as y. pestis lps is tetra - acylated at 37degreesc and is therefore significantly less immunostimulatory than that of organisms with the more typical hexa - acylated lps known to bind tlr4 [ 23 ] .

previous literature indicates that nlrp3 - / - is primarily responsible for y. pestis inflammasome activation in vitro [ 7 ] .
to identify the host mediators of inflammasome activation during pneumonic plague , we examined il - 1beta production and y. pestis virulence within the lungs of nlrp3 - / - , nlrc4 - / - and wild - type mice .
at 24 hpi , il - 1beta activation was observed in the lungs was observed in the lungs of both wild - type and nlrp3 - / - mice , but not in nlrc4 - / - mice ( fig. 3c ) .
inflammatory lesion formation was diminished in nlrc4 - / - mouse lungs , but was similar between nlrp3 - / - and wild - type mice ( fig. 3d,e ) .
however , y. pestis replication in the lung was unhindered in the absence of either nlrp3 or nlrc4 ( fig. 3f ) , thus decoupling bacterial burden from pulmonary inflammation .
in summary , these data suggest that y. pestis primes specific cytokines and activates the inflammasome within the lung through both tlr4 and nlrc4 , and this early inflammasome activation plays a significant role in the progression to the pro - inflammatory phase of disease .
il - 1 receptor antagonist protein and il - 18 binding protein are induced by y. pestis early during infection early inflammasome activation by y. pestis is paradoxical : our data show that early inflammasome activation contributes to inflammation in the lung and enhanced mortality , but lung inflammatory responses are delayed at least 30 hours after pro - inflammatory il - 1beta secretion is detected .
we sought to determine the molecular explanation for this extended pre - inflammatory phase of disease .
both macrophages and neutrophils express the il - 1 receptor ( il - 1r1 ) on their surface and are the primary targets of the y. pestis t3ss early during infection [ 17 ] .
secreted il - 1beta activates self and neighboring cells through autocrine and paracrine ligation of il - 1r1 , leading to early innate immune activation and pulmonary inflammation [ 3 ] .
we sought to determine whether y. pestis infection in the lung preferentially down - regulates il - 1 receptors .
we did not observe differences in il - 1r1 surface expression between mock and infected mice or with infected nlrc4 - / - mice ( s4 fig ) , indicating that downregulation of il - 1 receptors is likely not a mechanism for maintaining the pre - inflammatory phase of disease .
the il - 1 receptor antagonist ( ra ) and il - 18 binding protein ( bp ) are decoy proteins generated by innate immune cells to dampen inflammatory responses , typically in response to tissue damage .
il - 1ra has significant homology to il - 1beta but does not have a signaling domain , and is thus non - inflammatory when bound to the cognate il - 1 receptor [ 24 ] .
il - 18bp binds to the cytokine il - 18 and inhibits its ability to bind to the cognate receptor present on epithelial cells , t cells and nk cells , thus inhibiting downstream pro - inflammatory cytokine activation [ 25 ] .
it has been shown that yersinia species can activate the expression of il - 1ra in vivo in the lymph nodes and peyer 's patches of infected mice [ 26 - 28 ] .
we sought to determine if yersinia induced either il - 1ra or il - 18bp production in the lung , and whether this might contribute to the maintenance of the pre - inflammatory disease phase despite clear inflammasome activation .
as a comparison , we also evaluated lungs from animals inoculated with klebsiella pneumoniae , which is known to cause severe pneumonia with early pulmonary inflammation [ 27 - 30 ] .
as early as 12 hpi with y. pestis , il - 1ra gene transcription was 12 - fold higher than mock - infected animals and remained at that level for both the 24 hpi and 36 hpi time points ( fig. 4a ) .
early up - regulation of il - 1ra was also evident at the protein level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , which showed an increase of il - 1ra protein by approximately 11 - fold at 24 hpi with y. pestis ( s7 fig ) .
il - 18bp gene transcription was increased 10 - fold at 12 hpi , but expression substantially decreased at later time points ( fig. 4b ) .
pulmonary infection with k. pneumoniae did not upregulate transcription for either of these genes until 36 hpi despite greater bacterial burdens ( s5a fig ) , indicating that this early induction is not common to all inflammatory respiratory bacteria .
this is interesting , as il - 1beta was significantly activated in the lungs of k. pneumoniae - inoculated animals compared to animals inoculated with y. pestis at 24 hpi ( s5b fig ) .
in summary , y. pestis infection leads to robust and sustained up - regulation of the anti - inflammatory protein il - 1ra , concurrent with early inflammasome activation .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004688.g004 fig 4 il - 1ra is induced in the lung early during pulmonary infection with y. pestis , but not k. pneumoniae .
real time qrt - pcr analysis for ( a ) il - 1ra and ( b ) il - 18bp activation from lungs of mice inoculated with either an ld100 dose of y. pestis ( 1x104 cfu ) or k. pneumoniae ( 2x105 cfu ) , at 12 , 24 and 36 hpi ( n = 3 , per experiment ) .
fold difference calculated as deltadelta ct. il - 1ra suppresses early immune activation to enhance bacterial replication given that the expression of the il - 1ra gene was upregulated early and sustained in the lung after inoculation with y. pestis , we sought to examine whether this protein aided in early host suppression of innate immune responses by y. pestis during pulmonary infection .
we hypothesized that depletion of this protein would lead to an early inflammatory response capable of limiting bacterial replication .
mice were administered il - 1ra neutralizing antibody ( il - 1ra nab ) intranasally , and then inoculated with a lethal dose of y. pestis strain co92 .
in mice treated with il - 1ra nab , small foci of inflammatory cells were visible within lungs at 24 hpi , while animals treated with isotype control antibody had no visible inflammation present ( fig. 5a,b ) .
at the same time , lung bacterial burden decreased by more than 10 - fold in animals treated with il - 1ra neutralizing antibody ( nab ) compared to isotype control antibody - treated animals at 24 hpi ( fig. 5c ) .
importantly , we observed an early increase in pro - inflammatory cytokines tnfalpha , ifngamma , il - 6 and il - 12 in animals treated with il - 1ra nab at 24 hpi ( fig. 5d ) .
these data suggest that il - 1ra neutralization may provide il - 1 receptor access for activation , resulting in early inflammation in the lung .
in summary , these data present a scenario where y. pestis induces il - 1ra in order to partially suppress early host inflammatory responses and colonize the lungs more efficiently during the pre - inflammatory phase of pneumonic plague .

discussion pneumonic plague develops in two distinct stages , beginning with an extended " pre - inflammatory phase. " during this period , y. pestis transforms localized areas of the lung into a permissive environment that allows for significant bacterial growth , and has been characterized as a dominant immunosuppressive state [ 28 ] .
in the current study we demonstrate that y. pestis activates the inflammasome early during the pre - inflammatory phase , triggering il - 1beta secretion in the lung .
this is in contrast to a myriad of other pro - inflammatory cytokines that are not induced until the later stages of infection .
though inflammasome activation has a protective effect against a number of pathogens [ 20,30,31 ] , we show that the inflammasome contributes to pulmonary pathology and lethality during pneumonic plague .
our data also suggest that y. pestis infection concomitantly stimulates production of the anti - inflammatory protein il - 1ra , which may explain how the pre - inflammatory phase can be maintained despite inflammasome activation .
this may be an important mechanism to suppress host immune responses , allowing for enhanced y. pestis colonization of the lung .
we observed that y. pestis is able to activate the inflammasome through host detection of the t3ss injectisome , even in the absence of secreted yops ( fig. 1 ) .
host detection of microbial t3ss systems by nlrs in the absence of secreted effectors can occur by recognition of aberrantly secreted " needle " protein or through pore formation in the host cell outer membrane [ 4 ] .
we show that y. pestis activation of the inflammasome occurs primarily though an nlrc4 - dependent pathway that also involves tlr4 .
previous work has shown the tetra - acylation of y. pestis lps impedes tlr4 activation for a number of inflammatory cytokines , yet the inflammasome cytokines are still primed within lung macrophages [ 23 ] .
this may be a result of direct interactions between the t3ss needle subunit protein and tlr4 , as highlighted recently by jessen et al [ 32 ] .
the y. pestis t3ss injectisome activation of nlrc4 corroborates studies with other respiratory pathogens [ 18,20 ] , and this specificity of activation demonstrates yet another layer of tight control of immune activation .
recent studies with in vitro and in vivo models of infection have demonstrated activation of il - 1ra by y. pestis [ 26,28 ] .
previous work has demonstrated the ability of il - 1ra to attenuate the severity of asthma and ventilator - induced lung injury [ 33 - 35 ] , but a role in pulmonary microbial infection has not been previously demonstrated .
in the work presented here , we describe a potential effect of il - 1ra activation by y. pestis in the lung .
in the case of pneumonic plague , y. pestis induces il - 1ra during the pre - inflammatory phase of disease , thus limiting inflammatory cytokine induction early during infection .
inflammasome activation , though triggered early , does not have pathological consequences until much later , when the bacterial number is extremely high and the disease progresses to the pro - inflammatory stage .
at that point , y. pestis activation of the inflammasome is clearly requisite for the observed lung damage and rapid mortality , as demonstrated by the reduced pulmonary inflammation and enhanced survival observed in caspase 1 - / - and il - 1beta / il - 18 - / - mice .
our data suggests that y. pestis activates both the inflammasome as well as il - 1ra to dynamically regulate immune activation , allowing for enhanced bacterial burden early within the lung .
this may be favorable for disease , as hyper - immune activation later during infection may result in greater pulmonary damage , coughing , and enhanced transmission .
there are a variety of studies , with sometimes disparate conclusions , regarding inflammasome activation during yersinia infection .
the ability of y. pestis to activate the inflammasome is well - documented , and it has been shown that this activation and its downstream effects can be inhibited by various yersinia effectors including yopm and yopk [ 1,11 ] .
this is the first example of y. pestis inflammasome activation in the lung during pneumonic plague .
surprisingly , this activation occurred early during the " immunologically silent " pre - inflammatory phase of disease , thus requiring an explanation as to why the downstream effects of this activation are delayed .
we hypothesize that il - 1ra plays a role in facilitating the pre - inflammatory phase by modulating the ability of the host to respond to y. pestis activation of innate immune mediators .
if the pathology observed during y. pestis respiratory infection requires inflammasome activation , several therapeutic options may be useful for treating human infection .
our work demonstrates that host protein nlrc4 is the primary mediator of y. pestis injectisome detection by the host .
intriguingly , several other gram - negative pathogens including p. aeruginosa have been shown to activate the inflammasome through the nlrc4 complex to enhance pathology [ 16 ] .
therefore , nlrc4 may represent a multipotential target for prophylactic drugs .
as mentioned earlier , the timing of the pneumonic plague syndrome - - a long delay before symptoms followed by the rapid progression of severe pulmonary inflammation - - creates a formidable clinical dilemma : by the time a patient is diagnosed with pneumonic plague , it is often too late to administer antibiotics effectively .
current experiments are underway to examine whether treatment with the il - 1ra analog anakinra can reduce respiratory inflammation and reduce pulmonary pathology in y. pestis - infected animals , extending the window for antibiotic treatment and reducing the high mortality of pneumonic plague .

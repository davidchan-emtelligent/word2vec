isoniazid ( inh ) is a first - line antitubercular drug .
we report a case of a patient who developed a pleural effusion 2 months after starting antitubercular treatment for spinal tuberculosis .
isoniazid was found to be the culprit and its discontinuation caused subsidence of the effusion .
antitubercular drug isoniazid paradoxical response pleural effusion introduction paradoxical response to chemotherapy in tuberculosis is the worsening of a preexisting lesion or the appearance of a new lesion during antitubercular treatment .
such lesions usually disappear on their own but sometimes the administration of steroids or the withdrawal of the offending drug is required .
case history a 24 - year - old male presented to our outpatient department with complaints of fever , chest pain , and shortness of breath of 1 week 's duration .
his clinical examination showed a pulse rate of 90 / min , respiratory rate of 20 / min , and blood pressure of 110 / 80 mmhg .
he was anemic .
cyanosis and icterus were absent .
he had history of spinal tuberculosis for which antitubercular drugs ( rifampicin , isoniazid [ inh ] , pyrazinamide , and ethambutol ) had been started 2 months earlier .
examination of the respiratory system revealed decrease in chest movements on the right side .
on percussion , there was stony dullness on the right side , and the breath sounds were absent on auscultation of the lower lung fields .
the left side of the chest was normal .
laboratory investigation showed hemoglobin of 9 gm % ; the total leucocyte count was 9600 / cu mm , with 74 % neutrophils , 22 % lymphocytes , and 4 % eosinophils .
renal and liver function tests were within normal limits .
test for hiv was negative .
sputum smear was negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis .
the chest x - ray ( pa view ) showed a right - sided pneumonitis with effusion [ figure 1 ] , although there was no evidence of pleuroparenchymal tuberculosis in a chest x - ray that had been taken earlier .
mri of the spine was done and , when compared with the mri that had been done earlier , it showed improvement in the spinal lesion .
figure 1 x - ray chest showing right - sided effusion and pneumonitis on thoracocentesis there was an exudative effusion ; cytology of the fluid revealed lymphocytes - 90 % ; neutrophils - 4 % , and mesothelial cells - 6 % .
le cells were not found in the pleural fluid and the ada level was not elevated ( 12 iu / l ) .
antinuclear antibody ( ana ) titer in the fluid was elevated ( 1:320 ) .
we advised continuation of the antitubercular treatment and added a corticosteroid to his drug regimen ; however , the signs and symptoms of the effusion persisted .
considering the possibility of an inh - induced effusion , inh was stopped , upon which the patient started showing clinical improvement .
a repeat chest x - ray , taken 2 weeks after stopping inh , showed disappearance of the pleural effusion [ figure 2 ] .
figure 2 x - ray chest showing improvement in effusion after withdrawing of inh discussion inh is one of the first - line drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis .
it is a bactericidal drug .
after absorption , it is distributed to all body organs .
the mechanism of action is the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis .
inh is metabolized in the liver by acetylation and is excreted in urine .
the various untoward effects of inh include epigastric discomfort , neurological manifestations , hepatitis , etc .
these effects are dose related .
the lupus phenomenon , which has also been reported with inh , is an idiosyncratic reaction. [ 1 ] there are only a few cases of inh - induced pleural effusion described in literature. [ 2 ] inh - induced effusion usually begins 3 - 12 weeks after starting chemotherapy and regresses after change of therapy or introduction of steroids or both. [ 2 ] although many theories have been put forward to explain the phenomenon , such as immunological rebound [ 3 ] or an interaction between mycobacterial products and improving host immunity ,[ 4 ] none of these theories have been confirmed .
in our case , the elevated ana titer was suggestive of inh - induced lupus ; however , the test for le cells was negative and there was no improvement in symptoms after the introduction of a steroid into the treatment .
the patient showed improvement only after discontinuation of inh , ie , dechallenge was positive .
we , however , did not try reintroduction of inh .
there are increasing reports of cases of drug resistance , but the appearance of new lesions , such as an effusion or a pneumonitis , in a patient on treatment for tuberculosis may also be drug - induced ; this possibility must always be kept in mind .
paradoxical worsening of the lesion can also occur in cerebral tuberculoma and tubercular lymphadenitis. [ 4 ] in our patient , the aspirated pleural fluid was not characteristic of tuberculosis , which suggested that this was not a case of drug - resistant tuberculosis .

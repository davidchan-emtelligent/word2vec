introduction : high - grade obesity raises some specific problems regarding the endourological approach .
the aim of our study was to determine if this pathology might influence the outcome of retrograde ureteroscopy .
materials and methods : we evaluated the outcome of 88 ureteroscopies performed in highly obese patients during the last 5 years .
the data were compared with the results of 88 consecutive ureteroscopies performed in normal weight patients .
results : the success rate in the study group was of 91 % by comparison with 95 % in the normal weight group .
the use of flexible ureteroscopes was imposed in 17 % of the obese group vs. 11 % in the control group .
the complications rate ( all mild ) was of 6.8 % in the obese group vs. 4.5 % in the normal weight patients .
the differences between the two groups , although present , were not statistically significant .
however , in two cases with obesity , the weight of the patients was too high for the operating table , imposing supplementary sustaining measures .
conclusions : ureteroscopic treatment of stones in obese patients is an acceptable treatment modality , with success rates similar to non - obese patients .
sometimes it may require some logistic measures in the operating theatre .
retrograde ureteroscopy prevalence of obesity urolithiasis introduction obesity is a chronic disease with an increasing prevalence .
according to the national center for health statistics , 61 % of the americans are overweight ( body mass index - bmi >= 25 ) , 32 % are obese ( bmi >= 30 ) and 4.7 % are morbidly obese ( bmi >= 40 ) [ 1 ] .
in the united states , the obesity rates increased by 48 % in the last 15 years , while the incidence of morbid obesity grew from 2.9 % ( national health and nutrition examination survey 1988 - 1994 ) to 4.7 % in 1999 / 2000 , thus emphasizing a 62 % increase in one decade .
this situation has major implications for co - morbid diseases , mortality rates and healthcare costs .
obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide .
in the united states , obesity is estimated to cause an excess of 111,909 to 365,000 deaths per year while in europe 1 million deaths ( 7.7 %) are attributed to the excessive weight .
the healthcare costs related to obesity are of approximately $ 100 billion [ 2 ] .
even though data concerning obesity in romania are controversial , statistics reveal that one third of the population suffers from obesity , which puts our country in europe 's top ten classifications in this regard .
obesity is generally considered a risk factor for surgery , as it is assumed that the complication rates are higher .
due to the physiological changes that alter cardiac , respiratory , metabolic and haemostatic functions , obesity predisposes to co - morbidity and increased risk [ 3 ] .
moreover , the increasing prevalence of obesity and morbid obesity suggests that the surgical treatment in these patients will become more common [ 4 ] .
when treating urolithiasis , the use of lithotripsy , rigid and flexible ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy severely decreased the frequency of open surgery .
these modern techniques are minimally invasive , safe and only require short in - patient hospital stays .
high grade obesity pose special problems to the urologist , as the physical examination is more difficult , imaging is limited , special ' heavy ' operating - tables may be required and patient positioning is often problematic .
the present study aimed to determine if this pathology might actually influence the outcome of retrograde ureteroscopy ( urs ) .
materials and methods the last five years ( 2006 - 2011 ) charts were retrospectively reviewed in order to determine the efficacy and safety of the ureteroscopic treatment in a technically challenging group of patients with ureteral stones and a significant morbidity risk .
the outcomes and complications of ureteroscopies performed in a group of highly obese patients were compared to those of a normal weight ' series of cases treated during the same period .
the most common method of defining obesity is the body mass index ( bmi ) .
bmi is a more objective measure of obesity than weight alone , because it accounts for height as well .
the bmi also correlates with other measures of body fat and constitutes a readily available indicator of obesity .
bmi measures the height to weight ratio by taking weight in kilograms and dividing it by height in squared meters ( kg / m2 ) .
according to the world health organization ' guidelines , a bmi of 18.5 to 25 kg / m2 is considered normal , overweight is established by a bmi of 25 to 29.9 , obesity is established at a bmi >= 30 and morbid obesity is present at a bmi >= 40 kg / m2 .
the bmi for this series of patients was calculated by retrospectively examining the medical records .
any patient with a bmi >= 35 kg / m2 who was subjected to a retrograde ureteroscopy for ureteral stones was included in the study .
data regarding the preoperative characteristics , intraoperative features , outcomes and complications were collected .
in total , 88 ureteroscopies performed in 83 obese patients were reviewed and compared with 88 consecutive ureteroscopies performed in 82 normal weight patients .
the storz 10f semirigid and / or olympus urf - vo flexible ureteroscopes were used as required by each procedure ( fig. 1,2 ). fig. 1 semirigid ureteroscopic approach in an obese patient fig. 2 flexible digital uretero - renoscopic approach in an obese patient our standard technique for the ureteroscopic treatment of ureteral calculi included cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram , the placement of a 0.038 - inch floppy - tipped guide wire past the stone ( glide - wire when necessary ) to maintain access , the mounting of a safety wire for flexible approach followed by the actual ureteroscopy with electro - hydraulic lithotripsy .
basket retrieval of stone fragments was employed when necessary .
all procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia .
in order to document the stone size and location , kub and abdominal ultrasound were performed in all patients , while intravenous pyelogram ( ivp ) and computer tomography ( ct ) were used when indicated .
patients were followed postoperatively by x - ray , ct and / or ivp until they became stone - free or received additional treatment .
the patients' age , sex , stone size and outcome were recorded .
the treatment outcomes were defined as radiographic evidence of fragmentation or complete stone disappearance .
a procedure was considered successful when the postoperative imaging revealed fragments of 2 mm or less [ 5 ] .
for each of the treatment groups , 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the treatment 's success rates .
the statistical comparison of two independent percentages was done by means of the fisher 's exact test ( 2 - sided , p = 0.05 ) .
if the resulting p value was < 0.05 , the difference in the sample percentages was considered statistically significant .
results a total of 88 retrograde ureteroscopies were performed in 83 obese patients ( 44 women and 39 men ) with a bmi >= 35 kg / m2 in the study group .
the mean age of the patients was 47 years ( range 22 to 71 years old ) .
the average weight was 122.3 kg ( range 96 to 167 kg ) .
the mean bmi was 38.8 kg / m2 ( range 35.2 to 57.7 kg / m2 ) .
the overall mean individual stone size was of 8 mm , ranging from 4 to 20 mm. a total of 88 retrograde ureteroscopies were performed in 86 normal weight patients ( 41 women and 45 men ) in the control group .
the average age was 49 years ( range 20 to 79 years old ) .
the mean bmi was 22.7 kg / m2 ( range 19.8 to 24.9 kg / m2 ) .
also , the overall mean individual stone size was of 9 mm , ranging between 5 and 22 mm. data concerning the impact of obesity ( bmi >= 35 kg / m2 ) on the stone - free rates were analyzed .
although their stone burdens were slightly smaller , yet not in a significant proportion ( 8 versus 9 mm , p = 0.96 ) , the stone - free rate for the ureter was of 91 % in obese patients and 95.4 % in normal weight cases ( p = ns ) .
no significant differences were found with regard to the success rates .
eight ureteroscopies in the study group and five in the control group were judged as failures ( no stone - free status achieved ) .
practically , there were new renal calculi present postoperatively , consistent with the proximal migration of ureteral stone fragments that did not clear .
the use of flexible ureteroscopy was imposed in 17 % of the obese group versus 11 % in the control study arm ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 stone fragments extraction through a flexible ureteroscope the complication ' rate ( all events of a mild intensity ) was of 6.8 % in the obese series versus 4.5 % in normal weight patients .
the differences between the two groups , although present , were not statistically significant .
however , in two cases of morbid obesity , the patients' weight exceeded the maximum weight supported by the operating table ( 150 kg ) , thus imposing supplementary sustaining measures .
discussion from the very beginning , obesity causes diagnostic problems in the urological field .
symptoms of stone disease may be vague and pain is generalized , thus leading to diagnostic confusions .
the physical examination is difficult .
all imaging suffers from poor image quality : plain x - rays become scattered , renal ultrasound displays a beam ' attenuation while the kidney 's depth makes it difficult to find .
ct machines have weight limits and special operating tables are often required .
the obese patient with urolithiasis presented two specific issues .
the first one was constituted by the technical challenges of stone surgery related to the body habitus , while the second one was represented by co - morbidities affecting the anesthesia and actual operation in obese patients in general .
few reports provided a comparison regarding the outcomes and complications of open stone surgery versus the endoscopic approach [ 6 ] .
the intraoperative morbidity emphasized in obesity cases is related to anesthetic concerns , including altered pulmonary mechanics and oxygen perfusion .
the obese patient may also have decreased preoperative cardiac parameters , susceptible to worsening function during surgery .
postoperatively , the greatest risks are those of thromboembolic complications and wound infection .
although pcnl in supine position is a viable alternative in such cases [ 7 ] , there are some inconveniences which make the procedure possible in experienced centers alone ( too short instruments , difficult positioning ) [ 8 ] .
however , without any doubt , the retrograde approach benefits from a reduced morbidity compared to pcnl .
due to these facts , ureteroscopy can overcome the shortcomings of pcnl and open surgery in obese patients [ 9 ] .
the ideal treatment for ureteral stones is a rather controversial subject , with the non - invasive nature of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( swl ) favored by many over urs .
swl was recommended as first - line treatment of ureteral calculi smaller than 1 cm , resulting in an up to 92.6 % stone - free rate for proximal stones and 97.5 % for mid and distal calculi .
however , in obese patients , the use of swl is often contraindicated due to the weight limits of swl tables .
also , a frequent factor limiting the swl ' success is the positioning of the patient in order to locate the stone at the focal point of the lithotripter [ 10 ] , as the significantly increased skin - to - kidney depth impedes on the ability to focus the shockwaves .
for this reason , swl may not have the same success rates as in non - obese patients .
delakas et al. reported an increased chance of swl failure in obese patients of 1.9 fold when the bmi was > 30 [ 11 ] .
also , munoz et al. found a 72 % stone free rate secondary to swl in these patients .
consequently , swl may constitute a sub - optimal treatment for obese patients [ 12 ] .
one of the greatest benefits of ureteroscopy is represented by its success rates unaffected by patient size , as shown in multiple studies [ 13 ] , including our own .
satisfactory success rates are reported when compared to non - obese patients [ 14,15 ] .
the improved success rates of urs may make it an essential treatment approach from the perspective of an increasingly obese population , with remarkably high stone - free rates .
conclusions the ureteroscopic stone treatment in obese patients is an acceptable therapeutic modality , with success rates similar to those encountered in non - obese patients .
in certain circumstances , specific logistic measures may be required in the operating theatre .

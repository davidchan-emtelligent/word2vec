both lv ejection fraction ( ef ) and lv mass have proven to be prognosticators in hcm .
the literature is inconsistent with respect to in - or exclusion of papillary muscles ( pms ) to lv - mass , which might influence volumetric results .
pms might be part of the hypertrophic process and substantially contribute to lv mass .
we investigated the impact of in - and exclusion of the pms to lv mass in the assessment of prognostic lv parameters in hcm .
methods three groups of subjects were included : 1 ) hcm patients : phenotype + , genotype + ( n = 27 ) 2 ) hcm patients : phenotype + , genotype - ( n = 36 ) 3 ) preclinical hcm mutation carriers : phenotype - , genotype + ( n = 10 ) .
standard cinemri was performed with 10 mm short - axis slices ; images were analyzed , epi - and endocardial and pm contours were manually drawn .
lv volumes and mass were calculated with and without the inclusion of pms to the lv mass .
volumes and mass obtained with and without inclusion of pms were compared using paired samples t - test .
pearson 's correlation coefficient was used to investigate whether pms mass is related to lv mass .
results inclusion of pms to the lv mass , resulted in a significant reduction in lv volumes and an increase in ef ( table 1 ) .
pms - mass for group 1 , 2 and 3 was 5.8 +/ - 1.5 g / m2 , 6.8 +/ - 3.0 g / m2 and 3.9 +/ - 0.9 g / m2 , respectively .
the relative contribution of the pms mass to the absolute lv mass did not differ between groups .
however , pms mass was associated with absolute lv mass in group 1 and 2 , r = 0.639 ( p <. 001 ) and r = 0.800 ( p <. 001 ) , respectively , but not in group 3 .

given the prognostic impact of both ejection fraction and lv mass , our data underscore the importance of standardized assessment either with or without inclusion of the papillary muscles to the lv mass .
given the association between lv mass and papillary muscle mass in patients with hcm , the clinical consequences of assessment with uniform in - or exclusion remains to be determined .

despite recent developments in neuroimaging , alterations of brain functional connectivity in major depressive disorder ( mdd ) patients with suicidal ideation are poorly understood .
this study investigated specific changes of suicidal ideation in functional connectivity of mdd patients .
whole brain functional connectivity in 46 patients with mdd ( 23 with suicidal ideation and 23 without ) and 36 age - and gender - matched healthy controls were compared using resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) analyzed with network - based statistics ( nbs ) and graph - theoretical methods .
decreased functional connectivity in a characterized sub - network was observed in patients with mdd and suicidal ideation ( fdr - adjusted p < 0.05 ) .
the sub - network included the regions of the fronto - thalamic circuits in the left hemisphere .
the network measures of the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis ( r = - 0.40 , p = 0.009 ) , left thalamus ( r = - 0.41 , p = 0.009 ) , and right thalamus ( r = - 0.51 , p = - 0.002 ) were shown , through graph theoretical analysis , to be significantly negatively correlated with severity of suicidal ideation .
the reduced functional connectivity in left orbitofrontal - both thalamic regions with suicidal ideation in mdd were inversely proportional to the severity of suicidality independent from depression severity .
these findings suggest problems with decision - making and information integration in mdd patients with suicidal ideation .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction every 40 seconds , one individual dies from suicide1 while suicide accounts for 1.4 % of all deaths , making it the 15th leading cause of death globally2. and major depressive disorder ( mdd ) is the most researched associative factor with suicide , and is noted in 60 % of psychological autopsy reports3 .
fifty eight percent of patients with a current mdd episode report suicidal ideation , with 15 % attempting suicide4 .
not every suicide attempt is fatal , and suicidal ideation does not always lead to suicide .
a previous suicide attempt may be the most important predictor of completed suicide5,6 .
still , 86 % of suicides occur in people with a low risk of suicidal ideation , suggesting that a suicide attempt over a specific period may not accurately reflect the risk of imminent suicidality , a prime target to prevent suicide7 .
it is important to differentiate between suicide attempt and suicidal ideation .
suicidal ideation is a distinct phenomenon that is not equivalent to depression severity indicators , other dimensions with underlying biology , impact on disability , and risk factors8,9 .
mdd accompanying suicidal ideation is related to a higher rate of previous suicide attempts10 , poorer treatment response11 , and is thought to have different neuropsychological correlates that discriminate it from mdd without suicidal ideation12 .
measuring severity of both depression and suicidal ideation in mdd patients with suicidal ideation may help determine whether severe depression status predicts depression with suicidal ideation .
considering that severity and intensity of suicidal ideation can fluctuate over time , vary according to biological , psychological , and environmental factors13,14 , suicidal ideation should be assessed as a continuous measurement , and real - time neuroimaging could be a promising approach to examine neural network alterations as correlates of the degree and intensity of suicidal ideation15 .
neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that several areas of the brain are associated with suicide attempts at a neuroanatomical level , involving the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortex16,17 .
but few studies have focused on mdd with suicidal ideation , and these studies addressed only verbal fluency with functional near - infrared spectroscopy18 and cognitive control with fmri19 .
few researches reported changes in the fronto - limbic connectivity during the resting state in mdd group with suicidal ideation20,21 but further researches should be accumulated to figure out associative characteristics of functional connectivity to with suicidal ideation .
a recent study highlighted the value of considering mdd as a spatiotemporal disturbance of resting activity related to ruminations and enhanced self - focus22 .
in this view , neuroimaging of mdd is a prudent modality to use .
mdd patients have been classified into different groups based on dysfunctional connectivity findings from resting state fmri23 .
functional connectivity analysis in mdd patients with suicidal ideation would be a useful approach to focus attention on high - risk subgroups24 .
graph theory - based connectivity analysis has been successful in investigations of organizational changes in patients by modeling the whole brain as a network25 - 27 .
network - based statistics ( nbs ) analysis28 is a useful approach for localizing dysfunctional brain connectivity and is frequently applied to clinical applications29,30 .
unfortunately , however , there are few data on suicidal ideation in mdd , using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) with graph theoretical and nbs analyses .
therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the functional organization of whole - brain networks according to suicidal ideation in mdd patients by nbs analysis and graph theoretical analysis using fmri .
we focused on the comparison between mdd patients with suicidal ideation and patients without suicidal ideation , but we also compared healthy control to rule out the pathologic functional connectivity change coming from depression itself , which can find clear associative functional connectivity in suicidal ideation .
we had three hypotheses .
first , mdd patients with suicidal ideation will show different functional connectivity in the whole - brain networks compared with mdd patients without suicidal ideation .
second , the degree of the change in functional connectivity in those networks will correlate with the severity of suicidal ideation independently from depression severity .
third , functional connectivity associated with suicidal ideation will differ between mdd patients and healthy subjects .
results demographic results table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects .
forty - six had moderately severe depression , based on initial median hamilton depression scale ( ham - d ) score of 19 .
seven of the forty - six ( 15.2 %) patients had history of previous suicidal attempt .
patients with suicidal ideation had much higher suicidality outcome measured by the suicidality module of the mini - international neuropsychiatric interview ( mini sm ) than patients without suicidal ideation , but five patients without suicidal ideation had a suicidality score of 1 , leading to a median score of 3.5 in all mdd patients .
patients with suicidal ideation had a history of more suicide attempts and higher scores with the scale for suicide ideation ( ssi ) .
there were no significant differences in gender , age , education , number of episodes , duration of current episode , the korean version of the barrett impulsiveness scale ( bis ) score , ham - d score , and the mood disorder questionnaire ( mdq ) score between the patient groups .

discussion to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study comparing resting state functional connectivity in whole - brain network between mdd patients with and without suicidal ideation .
we observed that a distinct brain network characterized functional connectivity differences identified in patients with suicidal ideation versus patients without suicidal ideation .
this network includes the regions of the orbitofrontal cortex , especially the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , left middle frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and right olfactory cortex .
additionally , the functional networks consisting of the left middle temporal gyrus , left postcentral gyrus , and subcortical regions including both caudate , both thalami , and right putamen were significantly different in mdd patients with suicidal ideation .
there was significant correlation between suicide severity and functional connectivity measures in the subnetwork in the nbs analysis .
these functional networks were completely distinct from the functional networks distinguished between mdd patients and healthy subjects .
regions associated with suicidal ideation among mdd patients observed in our study are involved in decision making31 and information integration32 with self - attribution33 .
the primary regions apparent from nbs analysis were the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and both thalami ; the hub regions are presented in table 2 .
figure 1 illustrates the hub regions and decreased edges included in these regions , representing the reduced amount of functional connectivity between left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and both thalami according to the groups .
the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis is the upper part of the orbitofrontal cortex and is associated with adaptive cognitive and emotional behaviors like decision - making31,34 .
another hub region that showed reduced functional connectivity was both thalami , which are in the central area that is involved with transmitting information through the brain , and communication with many associative brain regions and global multifunctional pathways35 .
the thalamus also contributes to homeostatic brain rhythms that function in basic inhibition and coordination36 .
in the mood - related neural network , the thalamus receives strong dopaminergic projections , playing a critical role for information integration , which is responsible for depression and suicidal behavior37,38 .
poor decision - making coupled with maladaptive information integration is linked with suicidal ideation or behavior39,40 .
decision - making represents a higher level of executive function based on information integration , leading to cognitive flexibility and appropriate social judgement with behavioral control41 .
these impairments of cognitive actions have clinical implications for suicide in depression .
the present results strengthen the view that the alterations in functional networks involved in decision - making with information integration are associated with suicidal ideation .
care is needed in interpreting these results , given that the study was designed to indirectly investigate the association between decision - making , suicidal ideation , and sub - network alterations due to lack of a decision - making task .
reduced functional connectivity in fronto - subcortical circuits involving the regions was observed between the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and both caudate ; between the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and right putamen ; between both thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus , and pars orbitalis ; and between the right thalamus and left postcentral gyrus ( fig. 1 and table 2 ) .
fronto - subcortical circuits are responsible for emotional regulation , executive function , and impulse control ; the findings of impaired fronto - subcortical networks are consistent with other studies associated with suicidal behavior beyond their diagnosis42 .
the hub nodes were limited to reduced fronto - thalamic functional connectivity , consistent with previous studies that demonstrated impaired fronto - thalamic circuitry in suicidal mdd patients through dti43,44 .
dysfunctions in these circuits may also result in the loss of prefrontal cognitive control through the subcortical area .
these disturbances might increase the risk for dysregulation of emotional responsivity and vulnerability to suicidal ideation and behavior .
presently , the left lateralization related to suicidal ideation was limited to the left middle frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , left middle temporal gyrus , and left postcentral gyrus .
the left middle frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus contribute for deductive reasoning , which has been most often observed with left lateralization45,46 .
along with the left postcentral gyrus , three of these regions provide information from a person 's previous experiences and build mental simulation to make decisions .
deductive reasoning based on previous information and simulation is related to self - attribution , and negative attributional style is associated with suicidality that successfully resolves after treatment47 .
hence , reduced functional connectivity in the left lateralized middle frontal and temporal networks could be related to suicidal ideation by altering the appropriate deductive reasoning and self - attribution in depressive patients .
however , this research was not designed to evaluate asymmetry , and so the findings should be carefully interpreted .
our correlation study , with network measures and hubs , provides a complementary view of the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and both thalamic regions .
we applied graph theoretical analysis and measured the capacity of the overall information segregation , represented as functional connectivity. by identifying the brain 's modular structures , this graph theoretical analysis can detect groups of functionally associated regions responsible for specific functions .
this approach ( termed connectomics ) has been applied to differentiate characteristics of healthy brain networks from other networks with disorders48,49 .
node strengths , clustering coefficients , and regional efficiencies displayed significant negative correlations with the severity of suicidal ideation ( table 3 ) , and the betweenness centrality of given nodes was significantly positively correlated with motor impulsivity .
node strength is the sum of weights of links connected to the node and represents the influence of its network50 .
clustering coefficient is a measurement of local segregation of network and is equivalent to the fraction of a node 's neighbors50 .
regional efficiency represents the level of intermodular connectivity , which is responsible for communicating information between modules .
the betweenness centrality of a given node is defined as the number of shortest paths between any two nodes going through this node , and represents the level of influence on information transformation51 .
these results suggest an impaired function of coordinating brain networks in the left superior frontal gyrus , pars orbitalis , and both thalami in patients with higher suicidal severity , and could be an indicator of pathological changes in this region44 .
we did not find any significant network measure associated with other depressive symptom severity scales , anxiety scales , and impulsivity scales .
in between impulsivity scales , only the motor scale representing impetuous action was significantly associated with reduced functional connectivity in mdd patients with suicidal ideation .
the results suggest a possible association with impetuous action in suicidality of mdd and support the previously published association of the bis motor scale with suicidal ideation in bipolar patients52 .
these negative correlations also highlight reduced orbitofrontal - thalamic functional connectivity as an independent finding related to suicidal ideation , free from other depressive features and impulsivity .
however , careful consideration of the findings is needed because of the possibility of false - negative results due to multiple tests and the small sample size .
interestingly , no overlapping regions representing significant alterations were evident upon a comparison of mdd patients with healthy controls , and alterations upon comparison of mdd patients with or without suicidal ideation ( fig. 3 ) .
reduced functional connectivity was apparent in the right posterior cingulate gyrus as hub region , both middle cingulate gyri , left inferior parietal gyrus , left transverse temporal gyrus , right supramarginal gyrus , and right superior temporal gyrus in mdd patients compared with healthy controls .
these regions are the primary compartment of the default mode network , which engages in autobiographical memory retrieval , envisioning the future , and conceiving the perspectives of others53 .
other observations that have been noted in meta - analyses are decreased connectivity between posterior dmn and central executive network54 , especially emphasized in the right hemisphere55 .

connectograms showing subnetworks related to suicidal ideation ( a ) and major depressive disorder ( b ) .
the thickness of connections represents the t - statistics of the network - based statistics test. between two sub - networks , there is no overlapping brain region or connection , which could indicate neurological changes associated with suicidal ideation independent of depressive status .
the classification and abbreviations of brain regions are referred to the references28 .
the complete independent functional connectivity evident in this research suggests that the sub - networks are specifically involved in the development of suicidal ideation , and are not associated with depression status or severity of the disorder .
patients with premorbid reduced functional connectivity in the sub - network might be more at risk to develop suicidal ideation when they experience depressive episodes .
another view is that suicidal ideation has its own neurobiological changes that are independent of specific psychiatric disorders .
beyond the diagnosis , two recent studies generalized the discovery , prioritization , validation , and testing of few suicidality related markers across major psychiatric disorders to understand commonalities and differences of suicide56,57 .
the methodological limitation of our study is the cross - sectional design , which prohibits drawing a conclusion of a causal relationship .
smoking history , as significant risk factor for suicidal behavior58 including suicidal ideation59 , was not evaluated in our study as covariate , but should be considered as an important covariate in further study associated to suicidality .
brain imaging studies that examine superficial phenomena related to suicide - related behavior and more diverse molecular biology techniques for the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior are needed .
interpretation with fmri data , especially negative findings , should be done carefully , recognizing the potential for signal dropout , geometric distortion , and susceptibility artifacts in the orbitofrontal cortex because of its close proximity to the air - filled sinuses60,61 .
in conclusion , reduced functional connectivity in orbitofrontal - thalamic regions in mdd patients with suicidal ideation suggests difficulties in decision making and information integration .
reduced functional connectivity correlated only with suicidality , and was independent from severity of depression , anxiety , and impulsivity .
the correlation between functional connectivity and suicidal ideation score was significant after controlling the effects of those scores as covariates .
this could suggest our finding with pure independent suicidal pathology associated with reduced fronto - thalamic functional connectivity .
it could suggest another perspective on suicidal prevention independent from severe depression leading to suicide , but more focused approach on suicidal risk itself .
supplemented evaluation of attribution style and executive function accompanied with neuroimaging focused on default node network are suggested avenues of future research .

functional images were obtained using a two - dimensional echo planar imaging - sensitivity encoding ( epi - sense ) sequence with the following parameters : voxel size 2.86 x 2.89 mm ; slice thickness of 4 mm , repetition time ( tr ) of 3000 ms , echo time ( te ) of 35 ms , flip angle of 90degrees , and matrix size of 220 x 220 pixels .
images were reconstructed to 128 x 128 over a 220 mm field of view .
during the scan , all subjects were instructed to rest quietly with their eyes closed and not to fall asleep .
a whole - brain three - dimensional fast field echo t1 - weighted structural image was acquired with scan parameters : 1 mm sagittal slice thickness , over - contiguous slices with 50 % overlap , no gap , tr of 9.9 ms , te of 4.6 ms , flip angle of 8degrees , and matrix size of 240 x 240 pixels .
images were reconstructed to 480 x 480 over a 240 mm field of view .
all axial sections were acquired parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure line .
image preprocessing and network construction data from resting state fmri scans were preprocessed using fmri expert analysis tool ( feat ) of the fmrib software library ( fsl , http :// www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk / fsl ) .
motion correction was carried out using mcflirt69 , and temporal high pass filter using gaussian - weighted least - squares straight line fitting with cut - off of 126 s was applied70 .
volumetric regions of interests ( rois ) were defined based on automated anatomical labeling ( aal ) atlas , which includes 40 cerebral cortices and five subcortical regions for each hemisphere71,72 .
all time - series signals in each roi were averaged , so that 90 node - averaged time - series signals in every subject were made .
resting - state functional networks were constructed by measuring pair - wise similarity between two time - series signals in every roi using pearson product - moment correlation coefficients .
all correlation coefficients were transformed to z - scores using fisher r - to - z transformation48,73 - 77 .
we defined the brain functional networks to have only positive coefficients by discarding functional self - and anti - correlations , which are hard to quantify and interpret the network topological measures78 .
statistical analyses clinical and demographic profiles are demonstrated with categorical variables and continuous variables .
categorical variables are depicted with frequencies and proportions .
continuous variables are presented as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) or as median and interquartile range , and according to the normality of the distribution , student 's t test , one - way anova , wilcoxon rank - sum test , or kruskal - wallis test was applied .
nbs was used to detect the significantly different sub - networks between mdd patients with and without suicidal ideation , and between healthy participants and total mdd patients , respectively .
nbs is a mass - univariate testing method based on a network component , rather than an individual link , that controls family - wise error rate ( fwer ) 28 .
in the nbs analysis , we first perform two - sample t - test for all edges , resulting 4005 t - statistics for each subject .
then we randomly re - assigned the entire subject sample \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ n - 1 $$\ end { document } n - 1 times , divided into two groups with same sample sizes again , and computed t - statistics for all permutations .
we computed the maximum component size of sub - networks whose edges had bigger t - statistics than a certain initial threshold for all permutations , and formed a null - distribution of maximum component sizes .
we checked whether the maximum component size of sub - networks in original set was bigger than those of randomly re - assigned sub - networks at certain significance level .
the initial threshold and the number of permutation ( n ) were 4.20 and 10000 , respectively .
hub regions extracted from the sub - networks were identified by comparing mdd patients with and without suicidal ideation .
since hub regions have nodal degrees larger than two standard deviations away from the network mean , they signify the most affected regions .
the network topological measures on these hub regions , including nodal strength , regional efficiency , clustering coefficient , and betweenness centrality , were computed as the measures using the brain connectivity toolbox78 .
in conclusion , correlation analyses were performed between the functional connectivity of the sub - networks and the neuropsychological measures .
correlation tests were also performed between the network topological measures on the hub regions and the neuropsychological measures .
for the correlation analyses , correlation coefficients were calculated using spearman partial correlation after controlling the effects of age , gender , and education years .

bis - arene complexes of technetium represent a fundamental class of organometallic compounds .
detailed insights into their properties are obtained due to novel and convenient synthetic routes .
bis - arene complexes of technetium represent a fundamental class of organometallic compounds .
due to complex synthetic routes , no detailed insights into their properties have been reported so far .
reacting [ 99tco4 ] - with arenes in the exclusive presence of alcl3 gives highly stable [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ in good yields .
these complexes have extraordinarily high stabilities , where oxidation is found to occur at potentials higher than + 1.3 v and reduction at potentials below - 2 v vs. fc / fc + .
the 99mtc analogues are similarly synthesised by applying a novel ionic liquid extraction pathway .
complexes of 99mtc with suitably functionalized arenes will represent new building blocks for bioorganometallic pharmaceuticals in molecular imaging .
introduction the realm of organometallic chemistry emerges from a relatively small number of basic ligand types , co and cyclopentadienyl being two of them .
aromatic hydrocarbons constitute a further fundamental class of ligands , being isoelectronic with [ c5h5 ] - ( cp - ) but providing a different hapticity and different coordinating properties .
whereas cp - is a ubiquitous ligand in organometallic chemistry , complexes with aromatic hydrocarbons c6hnr6 - n are much less explored , likely due to synthetic challenges and lower thermodynamic or kinetic stabilities .
since arene ligands are uncharged , vacancies at the metal center are more easily generated by haptotropic shifts than with cp - . binary arene complexes represent precursors for numerous reactions.1 - 3 after their discovery by fischer and hafner in 1955 , a multitude of synthetic approaches were reported .
a recent , excellent review comprehensively describes these synthetic strategies in detail.4 of particular interest are syntheses starting from metal halides , in the absence or presence of reducing agents such as aluminum or zinc .
where metals such as feii or ruii are already present in the desired oxidation state , no reducing agents are needed ; higher starting oxidation states require reduction for coordination to the arenes.5,6 bis - arene complexes [ re ( eta6 - c6hnr6 - n ) 2 ]+ ( n = 1 - 6 ) are known but have been rarely studied and not in great detail .
the first bis - arene complex of 99tc was prepared by a very uncommon method , namely by element transmutation from [ 99mo ( arene ) 2 ] via beta - - decay 99mo - - > 99mtc - - > 99tc , the latter resulting directly from weighable amounts of 99tccl4 in the presence of al0 and alcl3,7,8 in low yields.9 only recently , kudinov and coworkers reported an improved synthesis of [ re ( arene ) 2 ]+ in moderate yields directly from k [ reo4 ] with zn0 as the reductant , alcl3 as a lewis acid and the arene as solvent.10 for over 50 years , no progress was made in the study of [ 99tc ( eta6 - c6hnr6 - n ) 2 ]+ type compounds , not only due to the radioactivity of this element but also because of synthetic difficulties .
the preparation of binary halides such as 99tccl4 as starting materials for accessing bis - arene complexes has made a significant impact over the past couple of years.11 - 13 their syntheses are well described but their preparation and isolation are still not routine .
a direct , high yield route to [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes from [ 99tco4 ] - salts would therefore be highly desirable since it would allow for the chemical exploration of these fundamental complexes and for classifying their properties in relation to neighboring elements .
in addition , arene complexes with metastable 99mtc are potential molecular imaging agents : phenyl groups are frequent in pharmaceuticals and coordination of a 99mtc fragment to such arenes enables labeling without additional , pendent ligands,14 a concept verified with the { cr ( co ) 3 } moiety bound to e.g. a phenyl ring in estradiol.15,16 the importance of the { m ( arene )} n + moiety is corroborated by the impact of the { ru ( cymantrene )} 2 + fragment in medicinal inorganic chemistry.17,18 among their endeavors for new myocardial imaging agents , wester et al. reported the synthesis of [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes in the early nineties .
however , since the yields were " variable " , the syntheses were multi - step , and the pharmacology was not satisfactory , the compounds were not studied any further.19 enthusiastic about new 99tc chemistry and convinced that the application of [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes will extend beyond myocardial imaging , we developed practical , one step syntheses of [ 99 ( m ) tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes in high yields and radiochemical purities , working towards a deeper understanding of the chemical and reactive properties of fundamental [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes .
results and discussion the reaction of nh4 [ 99tco4 ] , zn0 and alcl3 gave yields of < 15 % when applying reaction conditions analogous to those described for rhenium by kudinov et al. the products were difficult to separate from a black , colloidal material ( esi , section 1 +) .
in contrast to classical fischer - hafner conditions , we carried out the reaction without zn0 , assuming that zn0 could over - reduce the starting material to metallic , colloidal tc0 .
addition of toluene to solid alcl3 and k [ 99tco4 ] immediately produced a brown suspension .
heating the reaction mixture to 85 degreesc for 4 h gave a dark colored suspension .
after extraction with water and precipitation with nh4pf6 , we obtained [ 99tc ( c6h5ch3 ) 2 ]+ as [ 2 ][ pf6 ] in 75 % isolated yield ( scheme 1 ) .
comparable yields were obtained with mesitylene ([ 3 ][ pf6 ]) and tetralin ([ 4 ][ pf6 ]) ( esi , section 1 +) .
only the reaction with benzene to afford [ 99tc ( c6h6 ) 2 ]+ ([ 1 ][ pf6 ]) required zn0 ( vide infra ). with tetralin and alcl3 , we obtained product [ 4 ]+ but also a side product caused by friedel - crafts trans - alkylation reactions .
accordingly , the complex [ 99tc ( tetralin )( ohphen )]+ ( ohphen = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 - octahydrophenanthrene ) ([ 5 ][ pf6 ]) was isolated and structurally characterised as a major side product of the reaction to form [ 4 ][ pf6 ] ( esi section 1 and 4 +) .
scheme 1 reaction sequence for the preparation of [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes .
to confirm the identities of [ 1 ][ pf6 ] , [ 2 ][ pf6 ] , [ 3 ][ pf6 ] and [ 4 ][ pf6 ] , their structures were elucidated by single crystal x - ray diffraction ( esi , section 4 +) .
an ellipsoid representation of the tetralin complex is given in fig. 1. these structures complete the series of bis - arene complexes with respect to the neighboring group 6 and 8 elements and the straight forward preparation paves the way for exploring fundamental chemistry and physico - chemical properties of [ 99tc ( eta6 - c6hnr6 - n ) 2 ]+ type complexes. fig. 1 ortep representation20 of the [ 99tc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ ([ 4 ]+) cation of the [ 4 ][ pf6 ] structure .
thermal ellipsoids are represented at the 50 % probability level .
hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity .
selected bond lengths [ a ] and angles [ degrees ] : tc1 - c1 2.219 ( 2 ) , tc1 - c2 2.228 ( 2 ) , tc1 - c3 2.231 ( 2 ) , tc1 - c4 2.227 ( 2 ) , tc1 - c5 2.250 ( 2 ) , tc1 - c6 2.250 ( 2 ) , c1 - tc1 - c4 77.82 ( 10 ) , c2 - tc1 - c5 78.34 ( 9 ) , c3 - tc1 - c6 78.43 ( 9 ) .
we emphasise that no metallic reducing agent is present in these reactions .
whilst chloride reduces [ 99tcviio4 ] - to tcv or tciv , arenes may also act as reductants under friedel - crafts conditions to achieve oxidation states lower than tciv .
indeed , when the reaction was carried out in cyclohexane and alcl3 with [ nbu4 ][ 99tcocl4 ] and with no arene present , a yellow precipitate formed from a blue solution .
evaporation of the solvent and crystallization of the crude solid under n2 in dimethylformamide ( dmf ) gave large yellow crystals. from x - ray analysis the intermediate was confirmed to be [ al ( dmf ) 6 ][ 99tccl6 ] cl.dmf .
the presence of this tciv complex supports the role of alcl3 as a reducing agent of tcvii or tcvto form tciv .
consequently , the reaction to afford [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes can also be performed from k2 [ 99tccl6 ] with otherwise identical conditions as those from k [ 99tco4 ] ( esi , section 1 +) .
the complexes [ 2 ][ pf6 ] and [ 4 ][ pf6 ] were prepared by this route in good yields .
these reactions represent a new procedure towards bis - arene complexes of group 7 elements .
they combine pure arene substitution with elements already present in the desired oxidation state with concerted reduction - coordination , but without additional reductants such as zn0 or al0 .
only one similar process , for [ fe ( c6h6 ) 2 ] 2 + , has been reported in the literature.21 the reaction of k [ 99tco4 ] in benzene with alcl3 did not lead to [ 99tc ( c6h6 ) 2 ]+ ([ 1 ]+) .
in this reaction , only unidentified products formed and 99tc nmr spectra gave no evidence for tci species .
significant amounts of [ 99tco4 ] - (~ 50 %) could be recovered .
we concluded that substituted alkenes with enhanced donating properties stabilised the intermediate oxidation states better than unsubstituted benzene .
this interpretation is supported by the marked electrochemical differences found between the complexes ( vide infra ) .
complex [ 1 ][ pf6 ] could be synthesized from [ 99tco4 ] - via the fischer - hafner route in moderate yields with zn dust as a reductant .
99tc nmr spectroscopy provides valuable insights into the symmetry and electronic properties of technetium complexes.17,22 tci signals are typically found between - 3000 and - 1000 ppm relative to [ 99tco4 ] - at 0 ppm.23 due to a scalar coupling of the nuclear spin ( i = 9 / 2 ) to the quadrupole moment of the 99tc nucleus , decreasing symmetry of the complexes is accompanied by a strong line broadening .
however , the presented [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes have highly symmetrical first coordination spheres , reflected in their small half line widths ( 8 - 26 hz ) .
the observed 99tc nmr signals , [ 99tc ( benzene ) 2 ]+ at - 1860 ppm ( nu 1 / 2 = 8 hz ) , [ 99tc ( toluene ) 2 ]+ at - 1744 ppm ( nu 1 / 2 = 26 hz ) , [ 99tc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ at - 1586 ppm ( nu 1 / 2 = 11 hz ) and [ 99tc ( mesitylene ) 2 ]+ at - 1532 ppm ( nu 1 / 2 = 14 hz ) , suggest that a higher substitution pattern at the aromatic backbone leads to a shift in the 99tc resonance to lower field .
the 99tc nmr spectrum of [ 4 ][ pf6 ] ( including the side product [ 5 ][ pf6 ]) is shown in fig. 2. all 99tc nmr spectra are given in section 3 of the esi. + 1h nmr spectra show the strong influence of the metal center on the shift of the aromatic protons , which appear in the region around 5.5 ppm .
comparable features are found for isoelectronic complexes of the benzene complexes of ruii and cr0 , for which the arene signals are found at around 6.90 24 and 4.21 ppm 25 respectively. fig. 2 99tc nmr spectrum of [ 99tc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ ( - 1586 ppm , [ 4 ]+) and the side product [ 99tc ( tetralin )( ohphen )]+ ( - 1471 ppm , [ 5 ]+) .
the small but significant chemical shift differences in the 99tc nmr spectra of the complexes are caused by the different numbers of groups with negative hammett constants .
increased electron donation to the 99tc center should be paralleled with corresponding electrochemical properties .
cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) investigations are in agreement with this prediction and reversible oxidation waves for the tci / ii couple were found at surprisingly high values , generally e01 / 2 > + 1.4 v vs. fc / fc + in acetonitrile ( fig. 3 and esi , section 5 +) .
along the series [ 1 ]+ - - > [ 4 ]+ , the oxidation potentials become less positive with an increasing number of donors on the arenes .
irreversible and essentially arene independent reductions assigned to the 99tci / 0 couple appear below - 2 v. as expected from general trends in the triads of the d - block elements , the rhenium homologues of [ 1 ]+ - - > [ 4 ]+ showed the rei / ii couples shifted by about 0.19 - 0.15 v towards more negative potentials as compared to the 99tc compounds ( see esi , table esi5.1.1 +) , i.e. they are more easily oxidised than the 99tc homologues , albeit still at considerably positive potentials .
comparing the herein reported 99tc potentials with those of the neighbouring elements , for those which are available , confirms general trends for d - block elements in the periodic system .
for instance , e01 / 2 for [ cr ( c6h6 ) 2 ] 0 /+ is reported at + 0.82 v vs. ag / agcl , and hence , although to our knowledge unreported , the corresponding molybdenum complex should have an even more negatively shifted potential .
for [ ru ( c6h6 ) 2 ] 2 +/ 3 + , no potentials for the ruii / iii couple are reported , probably because observation of the oxidation is not possible in common solvents .
on the other hand , e01 / 2 for the ruii / i couple is found at - 1.02 v , almost 1 v more positive than the potential of its 99tc analogue ( table esi5.1.1 +). 26 - 28 spectroelectrochemistry measurements in an ottle cell supported the reversibility of the [ re ( arene ) 2 ]+/[ re ( arene ) 2 ] 2 + couple .
the rei complex is oxidised to reii and reduced back to rei as is evident from the isosbestic points detected in the electrochemical experiment ( fig. esi5.10.1 +) .
in agreement with these electrochemical potentials , the [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes are difficult to chemically oxidise and are very stable under ambient conditions .
they are also insensitive to ph changes and do not decompose over the whole ph range even at elevated temperatures , an important feature for their potential application as molecular imaging agents. fig. 3 cyclic voltammograms of [ 99tc ( benzene ) 2 ][ pf6 ] ( green line , e01 / 2 = 1.52 v ) , [ 99tc ( toluene ) 2 ][ pf6 ] ( red line , e01 / 2 = 1.47 v ) , and [ 99tc ( mesitylene ) 2 ][ pf6 ] ( blue line , e01 / 2 = 1.38 v ) in acetonitrile vs. fc / fc + .
the high yields and one step syntheses to [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes are the incentives for translating the reaction conditions to attain short - lived 99mtc complexes .
apart from fundamental interests , conjugation of biologically active groups to the arene ring will open a path to novel , functionalised and targeted spect imaging agents .
in the original preparation of [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes,19 the multiple steps required for transferring [ 99mtco4 ] - from the generator saline eluate into an organic solvent were difficult and time consuming , and ultimately prohibitive for any application .
to facilitate this step , we coated a glass vial with a thin layer of ionic liquid ( il ) by evaporating a dilute solution of [ p ( c6h13 ) 3 ( c14h29 )] br in mtbe .
addition of the generator eluate to this vial resulted in extraction of 80 - 97 % of [ 99mtco4 ] - into the il layer within 10 min by an anion exchange process ( scheme 2 ) .
the saline was removed and the il was dissolved in the corresponding arene and added to a vial charged with alcl3 under n2 .
the vial was heated for 10 min at 100 degreesc in a microwave reactor .
upon addition of water , the [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes were extracted in yields of 35 - 87 % and in radiochemical purities of > 93 % .
loading the aqueous solution onto a seppak column and rinsing with water removed hydrolyzed alcl3 .
the product was then eluted with an aqueous etoh solution and isolated with > 96 % radiochemical purity ( esi , section 1.2 +) .
scheme 2 extraction of na [ 99mtco4 ] from saline ( 0.9 % nacl in h2o ) into an ionic liquid .
the procedure was successfully applied for the toluene and mesitylene complexes .
as described for [ 99tc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ , the yield of the [ 99mtc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ complex was reduced due to formation of the trans - alkylated side product in a 1 : 0.8 ratio ([ 99mtc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ : [ 99mtc ( tetralin )( ohphen )]+) .
comparable to the reactions with 99tc , no additional reducing agent was required ( except for the synthesis of [ 99mtc ( benzene ) 2 ]+) .
we emphasise that the 99mtc bis - arene complexes are extraordinarily stable .
heating in an aqueous solution at 180 degreesc in a microwave oven in the presence of air does not decompose the complexes to a measurable extent .
this stability against oxidation ( and hydrolysis ) is in agreement with the observed redox potentials and makes the complexes resistant to oxidation in air .
assessment of the identities of the 99mtc complexes by hplc coinjection with fully characterised rhenium homologues and subsequent comparison of retention times is an fda accepted procedure .
due to the serial arrangement of the uv - and radio - detectors , the respective gamma - signal ( 99mtc ) is separated by a constant time delay ( here 0.5 min ) from the uv signal ( re ) .
this time delay was quantified with [ 99tc ( toluene ) 2 ]+ ( uv - and beta - - detection for the same compound , fig. 4 ). fig. 4 hplc traces ( uv - / beta - - detection ) of [ 99tc ( toluene ) 2 ]+ ( uv - detection : 16.39 min , black line ; beta - - detection : 16.90 min , red line ) .
despite their isostructural nature and comparable physico - chemical properties , slightly different retention times ( r t ) ( deltar t different from the 0.5 min ) are sometimes observed for homologous 99mtc and re complexes .
this makes their identification by r t comparison somewhat ambiguous .
the reported [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes provide good examples for this ambiguity , where the r t for [ 99mtc ( benzene ) 2 ]+ is 0.58 min shorter than that of the corresponding re complex .
this effect diminishes with the increasing number of arene substituents ([ 99mtc ( toluene ) 2 ]+ : 0.45 min , [ 99mtc ( mesitylene ) 2 ]+ : 0.42 min , [ 99mtc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ : 0.39 min ) .
these small but non - negligible uncertainties in the assessment of the identities of 99mtc complexes can only be ruled out by hplc coinjection with fully characterised 99tc analogues ; deltar t must be approximately 0.5 min ( for our instrumental arrangement ) .
this has additionally been verified by coinjection of [ 99mtc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ and [ 99tc ( tetralin ) 2 ]+ ; the separation of the uv signal ( 99tc complex ) and the gamma - signal ( 99mtc ) showed the expected separation ( deltar t = 0.51 min , esi , section 2 +) .
we emphasise that such direct comparisons between 99mtc and 99tc complexes are very rarely reported , if ever , but are ultimately the only way to truly assess the identity of a 99mtc complex .
conclusions mono - and bis - arene complexes of d - block elements are fundamental in organometallic chemistry .
the difficultly in accessing such complexes , especially for technetium where [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ type complexes have been essentially non - existent , has impeded their detailed chemical studies and their application in molecular imaging .
we now present a new , high yielding synthetic procedure to afford these fundamental organometallic complexes of the group 7 elements .
in our procedure no additional reducing agents are required , with the exception of the synthesis of [ 99tc ( benzene ) 2 ]+ .
alcl3 serves as an oxygen abstracting lewis acid and at the same time as a source of chloride reducing agent in the high valency regime .
the reaction procedure can be fully applied to 99mtc , enabling the introduction of novel organometallic complexes in the area of molecular imaging .
studies with non - alkyl arene substituents are currently ongoing .
experimental section general preparation of [ 99tc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes caution : 99tc is a weak beta - emitter ( e max = 0.292 mev , half life time = 2.12 x 105 y. it should be handled only in appropriately equipped laboratories .

general preparation of [ 99mtc ( arene ) 2 ]+ complexes the ionic liquid [ p ( c6h13 ) 3 ( c14h29 )] br ( 2 mg ) dissolved in 0.1 ml methyl tert - butyl ether ( mtbe ) was added to a capped vial .
under constant rotation of the vial , the solvent was evaporated by a n2 stream .
the [ 99mtco4 ] - eluate ( 1 - 2 ml ) was added and the vial was gently shaken for 10 min .
the aqueous solution was removed and the vial was purged with n2 for 30 min .
80 - 97 % of the [ 99mtco4 ] - remained in the vial .
the ionic liquid was dissolved in the corresponding arene ( 1 ml ) .
this solution was added to a vial charged with alcl3 ( 100 mg ) under n2 .

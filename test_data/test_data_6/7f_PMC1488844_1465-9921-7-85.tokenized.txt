background ozone ( o3 ) , a common air pollutant , induces exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
pulmonary surfactant protein ( sp ) - d modulates immune and inflammatory responses in the lung .
we have shown previously that sp - d plays a protective role in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation .
here we studied the role and regulation of sp - d in o3 - induced inflammatory changes in the lung .
methods to evaluate the effects of o3 exposure in mouse strains with genetically different expression levels of sp - d we exposed balb / c , c57bl / 6 and sp - d knockout mice to o3 or air .
bal cellular and cytokine content and sp - d levels were evaluated and compared between the different strains .
the kinetics of sp - d production and inflammatory parameters were studied at 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hrs after o3 exposure .
the effect of il - 6 , an o3 - inducible cytokine , on the expression of sp - d was investigated in vitro using a primary alveolar type ii cell culture .
results ozone - exposed balb / c mice demonstrated significantly enhanced acute inflammatory changes including recruitment of inflammatory cells and release of kc and il - 12p70 when compared with age - and sex - matched c57bl / 6 mice .
on the other hand , c57bl / 6 mice had significantly higher levels of sp - d and released more il - 10 and il - 6 .
increase in sp - d production coincided with the resolution of inflammatory changes .
mice deficient in sp - d had significantly higher numbers of inflammatory cells when compared to controls supporting the notion that sp - d has an anti - inflammatory function in our model of o3 exposure .
il - 6 , which was highly up - regulated in o3 exposed mice , was capable of inducing the expression of sp - d in vitro in a dose dependent manner .
conclusion our data suggest that il - 6 contributes to the up - regulation of sp - d after acute o3 exposure and elevation of sp - d in the lung is associated with the resolution of inflammation .
absence or low levels of sp - d predispose to enhanced inflammatory changes following acute oxidative stress .
background ozone ( o3 ) , an ubiquitous , oxidizing , and highly toxic air pollutant is generated photo - chemically from nitric oxides and hydrocarbons .
o3 is associated with an immediate impairment of lung function and contributes to increased morbidity in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) [ 1,2 ] .
even in healthy subjects , short - term exposure to o3 increases levels of the vascular adhesion molecules p - selectin and icam - 1 in airway lavages and bronchial tissue and induces influx of neutrophils and mast cells [ 3 ] .
in mouse , it has been shown that the quality and time course of the cellular response vary considerably between different inbred strains .
some strains like 129 / j and dba / 2j respond with an early peak of polymorphonuclear cells six hours after exposure , whereas c57bl / 6j mice reach the peak of inflammation 24 hrs after exposure .
additionally , a / j and c3h / hej mice respond with only minimal cellular influx [ 4 ] .
the o3 - induced acute pathological changes are characterized by an influx of neutrophils and airway hyperresponsiveness ( ahr ) .
long - term or chronic exposure to o3 , however , attenuates inflammatory responses , a phenomenon referred to as adaptation [ 5 ] .
the early adaptive response ( within 18 hrs after o3 exposure ) is largely il - 6 dependent but the late adaptive response ( several days after exposure ) involves mobilization of pulmonary antioxidants and leads to hypertrophy and metaplasia of epithelial cells in the upper as well as in the lower respiratory tract [ 5 - 8 ] .
the mechanisms influencing the severity of the o3 - induced pulmonary reaction and the molecules involved in the modulation of this response are yet to be fully determined .
surfactant protein - d ( sp - d ) , a pattern - recognition molecule of the pulmonary innate immune system , enhances the phagocytosis and clearance of various inhaled pathogens , allergens , and apoptotic cells in the lung and serves as a potent immuno - modulator [ 9 - 11 ] .
sp - d possesses anti - as well as pro - inflammatory functions depending on binding specificities and orientation against cell surface receptors [ 12 ] .
sp - d also inhibits t - cell activation and allergic inflammatory events and it may function as a local regulator of a t - helper type 2 ( th2 ) inflammation [ 13 - 15 ] .
the expression of sp - d is regulated developmentally but sp - d levels increase from baseline constitutive expression under a variety of lung inflammatory conditions [ 16,17 ] .
we have previously shown that sp - d production induced during allergic inflammation is mediated by the th2 cytokine il - 4 [ 13,18 ] .
however , little is known regarding the role and regulation of sp - d in non - antigen - related inflammatory changes of the lung .
recently , casey and colleagues proposed an anti - inflammatory role of sp - d in a mouse model of bleomycin - induced lung injury [ 19 ] .
since different mouse strains not only vary in their airway responses to o3 but also express different levels of sp - d , we hypothesized that there is a causal relationship between these two characteristics .
to test our hypothesis and to better characterize the role sp - d may play in o3 - induced inflammation , we used mice with reportedly different sp - d levels [ 13 ] and mice lacking sp - d [ 20 ] we found that mice expressing high levels of sp - d had significantly less severe inflammatory responses as compared to mice with low or no sp - d. additionally , the o3 - inducible cytokine il - 6 selectively induced the expression of sp - d in vitro .
methods animals all experimental animals used in this study were housed under pathogen - free conditions .
experiments were performed between 8 and 12 weeks of age .
animals received water and food ad libitum .
the protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of pennsylvania and glaxosmithkline .
modes of o3 exposure to evaluate the effects of o3 exposure in mouse strains with different sp - d levels , we used balb / c and c57bl / 6 mice and exposed them to 3.0 ppm o3 for a 2 hrs period .
bal sp - d levels , cellular and cytokine content were evaluated 6 hrs later .
to define the kinetics of the o3 - induced inflammation and sp - d production in more detail , c57bl / 6 mice ( jackson laboratory , bar harbor , me ) were exposed to 3.0 ppm o3 or air for a 2 hrs period and studied 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hrs later .
finally , to study the effects of a complete lack of sp - d , sp - d knockout mice [ 20 ] were exposed to either 3.0 ppm o3 for 2 hrs or to 0.5 ppm o3 for 24 hrs .
bal was performed 12 hrs ( 2 hrs exposure ) and 24 and 48 hrs ( 24 hrs exposure ) later .
in all experiments age - and strain - matched controls were exposed to room air concurrently .
the levels and exposure times were based on a previous pilot study ( unpublished ) and were chosen to accommodate all three different mouse strains and to allow us to study and compare the temporal inflammatory changes .
after exposure , groups of mice ( n = 6 ) were euthanized and bal was performed .
bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) differential cell count bal was performed as previously described [ 13 ] .
briefly , mice were euthanized with an i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine ( 100 mg / kg and 20 mg / kg respectively ) .
a tracheotomy was performed and the trachea was canulated with a 20 gauge blunt end needle .
lavage was carried out once with 0.7 ml and twice with 1 ml sterile pbs .
the recovered bal from three lavages was pooled .
bal was centrifuged at 4degreesc for 10 min .
at 400 g and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of pbs .
total cell counts were determined from an aliquot of the cell suspension .
differential cell counts were done on cytocentrifuge preparations ( cytospin 3 ; thermo shandon , pittsburgh , pa ) stained with kwik ( tm ) diff ( thermo shadon , pittsburgh , pa ) , and 200 - 500 cells were counted from each individual .
cytokine assays , sp - d western blots and elisa cytokine and chemokine levels in the cell - free bal were determined as part of a luminex ( r ) 100 ( tm ) assay system ( luminex corporation , austin , tx ) and endogen ( r ) searchlight ( tm ) mouse cytokine and chemokine arrays ( pierce biotechnology inc. , il ) , respectively , and was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
total protein from cell free supernatant of the bal fluids was assessed using the bradford assay ( biorad , ca ) .
western blots for sp - d levels in cell - free bal fluid were performed as previously described [ 18 ] .
briefly , 4 mug of total protein were loaded and run on an sds - page and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes .
membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti - sp - d antibody ( chemicon int. , temecula , ca ) , followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg ( bio - rad , ca ) .
specific binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with ecl kit ( amersham , il ) .
the intensity of the signals was quantified with gelpro analyzer 4.0 ( media cybernetics inc. , nj ) software .
the band density values obtained from individuals were expressed as percentage of the band intensities of treated animal to non - treated , naive samples .
to be able to compare different mouse strains the mean baseline levels in each strain were assigned the value 100 % (+/ - sem ) .
sp - d protein recovered from bal was quantified by elisa using an in - house rabbit polyclonal anti - sp - d antibody [ 18 ] .
aliquots of the bal samples neat or diluted with blocking buffer ( 1 % bsa , 2 % normal goat serum , 0.5 % tween - 20 in dulbecco 's phosphate - buffered saline ) were applied to 96 - well nunc - immuno max isorp plates ( nalgene nunc international , denmark ) .
each assay plate included a standard of purified sp - d peptide ( 0.31 to 40 ng / ml ) [ 18 ] .
polyclonal anti - sp - d antiserum was applied as a primary antibody ( 1:10,000 ) and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg ( 1:1,000 ) was used as the secondary antibody .
colorimetric detection was performed using abc reagent ( vectastain abc kit , vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
color intensity was measured at 405 nm using an automated microplate reader ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) and analyzed with bio - rad microplate manager software .
overlapping serial dilution curves of the sp - d peptides and the purified sp - d protein showed a semi - logarithmic relationship between od and concentration .
elisa for sp - a was performed as published previously [ 13 ] .
alveolar type ii cell culture lung alveolar type ii cells were isolated from neonatal sprague - dawley rats ( charles river laboratories , wilmington , ma ) as previously described [ 3,18 ] .
our method yields approximately 60 % of type ii cells ( positive for the lamellar body protein abca3 ) .
major contaminating cell types are macrophages and fibroblasts .
the viability of type ii cells in our culture system is about 85 - 95 % .
cells were cultured in serum - free weymouth 's mb 752 / 1 medium ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) containing dci [ dexamethasone ( 10 nm ) , 8 - br - camp ( 100 mum ) and isobutylmethylxantine ( 100 mum ) all from sigma , st. luis , mo )] in the presence or absence of il - 6 ( bd pharmingen , san diego , ca ) for 4 days .
western blots for intra - cellular sp - d were performed as described above .
data analysis statistical analysis was performed with prism4 software ( graphpad inc. , san diego , ca ) .
multiple comparisons were performed by one - way - anova followed by barlett 's test or post test for linear trend .
student t - test was used for two - group comparisons .
data are expressed as mean +/ - sem , p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results a relative sp - d deficiency in balb / c mice was associated with exaggerated inflammatory changes 6 hrs after o3 exposure we have previously reported that sp - d levels in balb / c and c57bl / 6 mice differ under normal conditions as well as upon allergen sensitization and challenge [ 13 ] .
since sp - d is a potent immuno - regulator we were interested in evaluating whether these mouse strains would show quantitative differences in their inflammatory response to o3 .
in these experiments bal sp - d levels in the different moue strains were normalized to 100 % , i.e. their mean baseline level .
we previously published results of a direct comparison between naive balb / c and naive c57bl / 6 mice in which western blot analysis demonstrated that c57bl / 6 mice had approximately twice as much sp - d as balb / c mice [ 13 ] .
as shown in fig. 1a , o3 - exposure caused a significant drop in sp - d levels in balb / c ( but not in c57bl / 6 ) in comparison with air exposed controls ( p = 0.0249 ) .
six hours after o3 exposure , the amount of sp - d recovered from the bal ( and normalized to the baseline ) was significantly lower in balb / c mice compared with c57bl / 6 mice ( p = 0.0027 ) .
figure 1 a decrease in bal sp - d levels was associated with significantly increased inflammation in balb / c mice 6 hrs after o3 exposure .
groups of balb / c ( grey bars ) and c57bl / 6 ( black bars ) mice were exposed to o3 or room air for 2 hrs and bal was performed 6 hrs later .
( a ) ozone exposed balb / c mice had significantly reduced sp - d levels as compared to air exposed balb / c or o3 exposed c57bl / 6 mice .
sp - d was detected by western blot analysis of the cell - free supernatant of the bal ( top panel ) and was performed using our in - house rabbit polyclonal anti - sp - d antibody .
two representative samples out of a total of six are shown in each group .
sp - d expression was quantified by densitometric analysis .
results are expressed as % of naive control levels .
* p = 0.0249 vs. room air ; p = 0.0027 vs. c57bl / 6 .
( b ) balb / c mice had significantly higher numbers of inflammatory cells in their bal as compared to c57bl / 6 mice .
cells were counted using a coulter counter and results are expressed as cell number / ml (* p = 0.0316 ) .
( c ) : the bal total protein content was significantly higher in balb / c mice compared to c57bl / 6 mice .
total protein was measured by bradford assay in the cell - free supernatant * p = 0.028 .
absolute protein contents were 919,6 (+/ - 51,4 ) and 3262,3 (+/ - 281.0 ) in air and o3 exposed balb / c mice , respectively , and 772 (+/ - 26.4 ) and 2110 (+/ - 36.4 ) in air and o3 exposed c57bl / 6 mice , respectively. ( d - g ) : cytokine expression was studied by endogen ( r ) searchlight ( tm ) and luminex ( r ) 100 ( tm ) technologies .
o3 induced the release of il - 12p70 ( 34 pg / ml +/ - 4 in balb / c , 18.7 pg / ml +/ - 1 in c57bl / 6 ) , il - 6 ( 2,393 pg / ml +/ - 119 in balb / c , 412 pg / ml +/ - 68.7 in c57bl / 6 ) , il - 10 ( 110 pg / ml +/ - 16 in balb / c , 14.2 pg / ml +/ - 1.6 in c57bl / 6 ) and kc ( 1,896 pg / ml +/ - 224 in balb / c , 136.8 pg / ml +/ - 27.7 in c57bl / 6 ) .
cytokine and chemokine levels are expressed as % increase from control levels .
the o3 - induced pro - inflammatory cytokine il - 12p70 and kc levels were significantly higher (* p = 0.0134 and * p = 0.0001 , respectively ) whereas the immunosuppressive il - 10 and the immunoregulatory il - 6 levels were significantly lower (* p < 0.0001 and * p < 0.0001 , respectively ) in balb / c mice than in c57bl / 6 mice .
( a - g ) : mean +/ - sem of n = 6 in each groups .
balb / c mice also had significantly more inflammatory cells ( mainly neutrophils , approx. 50 % of total cell counts ) compared to c57bl / 6 mice ( p = 0.0316 ; fig. 1b ) .
moreover , balb / c mice had significantly higher total protein content in their bal as compared to c57bl / 6 , indicating more severe lung injury ( p = 0.028 ; fig. 1c ) .
the levels of the pro - inflammatory cytokine il - 12p70 and the neutrohpil chemo - attractant kc were significantly higher in balb / c as compared to c57bl / 6 mice ( p = 0.0134 and p = 0.0001 , respectively ; fig. 1d - e ) after o3 challenge .
in contrast , c57bl / 6 mice released more il - 10 and il - 6 ( p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ; fig. 1f - g ) .
absolute cytokine levels are indicated in the figure legend .
kinetics of sp - d during o3 - induced inflammatory changes to study the kinetics of sp - d changes in the context of o3 - induced inflammation we used c57bl / 6 mice ( the " sp - d high " strain ) and followed the onset and resolution of the inflammation at 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hrs after o3 exposure .
elisa for sp - d and sp - a recovered from the bal fluid of o3 - exposed mice showed significant elevation of sp - d levels with approximately 50 % increase from baseline 12 hrs post - exposure .
sp - d continued to increase until the last time point of the experiment ( 72 hrs ) when sp - d levels were about 150 % above control levels ( p = 0.0022 ; fig. 2a ) .
sp - a levels on the other hand did not change significantly .
the sp - d elisa results were verified using western blot analysis .
the two different methods showed a significant positive spearman correlation r = 0.86 ( p = 0.0238 ) .
inflammatory cells were detected 2 hrs after o3 - exposure , and the numbers were significantly increased compared to naive animals and peaked around 12 hrs post - exposure ( p < 0.0001 ; fig. 2b ) .
a slight increase in the numbers of lymphocytes ( up to 3 % of total cell counts ) was also observed with a time course comparable with that of neutrophilic cells ( p = 0.0003 ; not shown ) .
eosinophil counts showed a transient peak at 6 hrs , but their number remained less than 1 % of total cell counts at all time points ( not significant ; not shown ) .
airway neutrophilia resolved markedly within 72 hrs after o3 exposure indicating an inverse relationship between the rise of sp - d levels and the decrease of inflammatory cells , including neutrophils and lymphocytes ( fig. 2a and 2b ) .
there was however no statistical correlation between these parameters .
the neutrophil influx was preceded by a significant increase in kc levels but there was no significant correlation between this chemokine and neutrophil recruitment .
release of kc into the airways started 2 hrs after o3 challenge and reached a peak at 6 hrs ( p < 0.0001 ; not shown ) .
kc levels were back to baseline by 24 hrs .
interestingly , il - 6 was highly induced , with a peak at the 6 hrs time point and a return to baseline levels 48 hrs post - exposure ( p < 0.0001 ; fig. 2c ) .
release of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 was delayed by several hours .
il - 10 levels were slightly but significantly increased with highest values between 6 - 24 hrs after o3 challenge ( p = 0.0007 ; fig. 2d ) .
figure 2 kinetics of o3 - induced sp - d and inflammatory changes in c57bl / 6 mice .
groups of c57bl / 6 mice were exposed to 3 ppm o3 or room air and studied 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hrs later .
( a ) : sp - d and sp - a recovered from the bal were quantified by an in - house elisa .
results are expressed as % change from naive controls .
sp - d levels gradually increased until the 72 hrs time point ( p = 0.0022 , anova and post test for linear trend ) whereas sp - a levels did not change significantly .
( b ) : the number of neutrophilic granulocytes was assessed by counting total number of bal cells in the bal fluid and performing differential cell counting on kwick ( tm ) diff cytospin preparations .
results are expressed as absolute cell number / ml of bal fluid .
neutrophilic inflammation peaked around 12 hrs post exposure ( p < 0.0001 ) and largely resolved by 72 hrs after o3 exposure .
( c - d ) il - 6 and il - 10 levels were assessed as part of a luminex ( r ) 100 ( tm ) assay and showed significant increases 2 - 6 hrs after o3 exposure ( p < 0.0001 ) and 6 - 24 hrs after o3 exposure ( p = 0.0007 ) , respectively .
( a - d ) : mean +/ - sem of n = 6 in each groups .
sp - d deficient mice have increased cellular inflammation following o3 exposure to further evaluate the anti - inflammatory role of sp - d in the o3 - induced immune response we used sp - d deficient mice and compared them with age - and sex - matched c57bl / 6 wild - type controls .
sp - d deficient mice showed a baseline inflammation that was further increased after o3 exposure .
the o3 - induced cellular response was significantly higher in sp - d - / - mice compared to wt c57bl / 6 mice 12hrs after acute o3 exposure ( p = 0.0106 ; fig. 3a ) .
in addition , when mice were exposed to o3 for 24 hrs ( 0.5ppm o3 ) , a sub - acute exposure , this finding was confirmed , since sp - d - / - mice had increased numbers of inflammatory cells both 24 and 48 hrs after cessation of o3 exposure ( fig. 3b , p = 0.0082 ) .
unlike after acute o3 exposure ( fig. 2b ) , neither the wild type nor the sp - d - / - mice showed signs of resolution of cellular infiltration at the 48 hrs time point after sub - acute exposure .
on the contrary , inflammatory cell numbers were further increased ( fig. 3b ) .
figure 3 sp - d deficient mice have increased airway inflammation following o3 exposure .
( a ) sp - d - / - mice and age - matched c57bl / 6 controls were exposed to 3 ppm o3 for 2 hrs or ( b ) to 0.5 ppm for 24 hrs .
influx of neutrophilic granulocytes was assessed on cytospin preparations stained with kwick ( tm ) diff .
in both models cellular inflammation in sp - d - / - mice was significantly higher compared to wt mice ( a ) student t - test * p = 0.0106 ( b ) anova and barlett 's test * p = 0.0082 .
il - 6 selectively induces the production of sp - d in vitro we have shown previously that sp - d induction in allergic inflammation is dependent on il - 4 and il - 13 [ 15,18 ] .
although , none of these th2 type cytokines was induced in the present model of o3 challenge , the production of sp - d was highly up - regulated .
therefore we tested the possibility that one of the o3 - inducible cytokines is capable of promoting sp - d expression .
since il - 6 showed the most pronounced changes following o3 challenge , and since it is a pluripotent immuno - regulatory cytokine , we chose to investigate its effects on sp - d gene expression in vitro .
as shown in fig. 4a , in vitro stimulation of primary rat alveolar type ii cells revealed that il - 6 is indeed capable of directly up - regulating sp - d production .
the effect of il - 6 was dose dependent ( fig. 4b ) and selective for sp - d , because sp - a production was not changed ( fig. 4a ) .
figure 4 in vitro production of sp - d by alveolar type ii cells after il - 6 stimulation .
( a ) primary rat alveolar type ii cells were cultured in the presence or absence of dci and il - 6 for up to 4 days and intra - cellular sp - d and sp - a levels were assayed by western blot analysis .
day 0 sp - d and sp - a signals were obtained from freshly isolated alveolar type ii cells .
to maintain the sp - d producing phenotype , cells have to be cultured in the presence of dci ( 10 nm dexamethason , 100 nm ibmx , 10 nm camp ) that in turn stimulates sp - d production .
il - 6 selectively stimulated the production of sp - d but did not induce up - regulation of sp - a .
( b ) increase of sp - d after il - 6 stimulation at day 4 was slightly dose dependent .
all levels were compared to non - stimulated alveolar type ii cells cultured in dci containing medium ( dci control ) .
discussion our results confirm the findings of other investigators showing that acute o3 exposure induces a rapid onset and resolution of airway inflammatory changes characterized by a kc - driven neutrophilic inflammation and moderately increased numbers of lymphocytes , eosinophils and macrophages [ 4,6 ] .
altered levels of surfactant protein d have been reported in association with a number of different pathological conditions of the lung [ 13,15,18,21 - 24 ] .
here we show that o3 exposure induces a delayed expression of sp - d. our data also show that the susceptibility to o3 - induced inflammatory changes varies between different mouse strains and appears to be associated with different levels of sp - d .
c57bl / 6 mice that express high levels of sp - d also produce high levels of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 and high levels of il - 6 .
in contrast , balb / c mice release significantly more kc and il - 12p70 .
elevated levels of sp - d are associated with the resolution of the o3 - induced inflammation and low levels or lack of sp - d predispose to a severe inflammatory response .
the drop in sp - d levels seen in balb / c mice 6 hrs after o3 exposure could be due to a direct damage and / or apoptosis of sp - d producing epithelial cells [ 25 ] .
it is likely that this acute phenomenon affects stored sp - d only , because de - novo mrna expression occurs only about 6 hrs after allergen challenge or pulmonary infection and increased levels of sp - d protein were only detected at about 12 hrs ( fig. 2a ) [ 13,18,26 ] .
additionally , the size of the extracellular sp - d pool might be important in the protection from o3 - induced epithelial injury .
although the authors did not specifically investigate the role of sp - d , li and colleagues demonstrated that endotoxin pre - treatment , which is expected to induce sp - d production , protects against o3 - induced cell death and pulmonary inflammation [ 27,28 ] .
this could explain why c57bl / 6 mice with their higher levels of sp - d were more protected from the acute effects of o3 .
although it has been shown previously that different mouse strains vary in their acute o3 - induced pulmonary response [ 4 ] , no host factors responsible for the individual susceptibility have been identified .
savov and co - workers identified several chromosomal regions that appeared to be associated with the physiologic and biologic phenotypes [ 4 ] .
their in silico genome scan indicates that a locus between 30 and 40 megabases ( mb ) on mouse chromosome ( mmu ) 14 contains one or more relevant genes .
it is noteworthy , that the gene coding for sp - d is located on mmu 14 in the area of 37.2 mb. additionally , two recent reports identified sequence polymorphisms in the human sp - d gene that lead to differences in constitutive serum levels and influence the multimeric assembly and function of sp - d protein [ 29,30 ] .
neutrophils play a vital role in the pulmonary host defense .
however , due to their release of large amounts of histo - toxic and pro - inflammatory agents , these cells can cause significant tissue damage .
hence , a stringent control of neutrophil priming , recruitment , activation , apoptosis and clearance is crucial to confine tissue damage [ 31 ] .
mice genetically deficient in sp - d have chronic inflammation and hyper - activated macrophages further strengthening the important role of sp - d as a local regulator of the innate immune response [ 20,32,33 ] .
in a recent publication white and colleagues demonstrated that sp - d may either inhibit or enhance neutrophil respiratory burst responses to influenza a virus .
their data also suggest that the effects of sp - d are modulated by the presence of other respiratory innate immune proteins such as sp - a , and on the multimerization state of sp - d [ 34 ] .
other studies show that administration of recombinant sp - d enhances the up - take of apoptotic cells and reduces the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 35,36 ] .
in line with those results , our study shows that levels of kc , the main chemo - attractant for neutrophils , significantly dropped in concert with a significant elevation of sp - d 12 hrs after o3 exposure in c57bl / 6 mice .
however , whether or not sp - d has a direct regulatory effect on kc remains to be determined and is the current focus of our studies .
ozone exposure does not induce the release of classical th2 type cytokines such il - 4 or il - 13 which have been shown to stimulate the expression of sp - d [ 18 ] .
however , in our study we show that o3 induced a significant rise in bal sp - d suggesting that there are other mechanisms to promote sp - d expression during a non - allergen induced inflammation .
indeed , our in vitro studies using rat alveolar type ii cells show that il - 6 is capable of inducing sp - d production .
in a different model of airway inflammation , elicited by allergic sensitization and challenge , we have previously shown that a rapid release of pro - inflammatory cytokines is followed by a relatively slow , gradual elevation of sp - d protein levels in the airways , with a peak 48 hours after allergen challenge [ 15 ] .
in accordance to that , sp - d protein levels were still increased at 48 and 72 hrs when il - 6 levels were already back to normal .
il - 6 can transduce its signal either via c / ebpbeta or via stat3 activation .
the sp - d promoter region harbours binding sites for both of these transcription factors [ 37 ]. whether il - 6 - dependent sp - d gene expression is promoted by c / ebpbeta or stat3 or synergistically by both of them remains to be clarified .
interestingly , il - 6 deficient mice have significantly less bal protein , neutrophils and soluble tnf receptors after exposure to sub - acute levels of o3 [ 38 ] .
on the other hand mice over - expressing il - 6 are protected from lung injury caused by chronic hypoxia [ 39 ] .
these findings point out the pluripotent functions of il - 6 as an anti - as well as a pro - inflammatory cytokine .
the reports by johnston et al. and ward et al. also provide indirect support of our findings that il - 6 is important in launching a protective pulmonary response .
our results showed that the neutrophil chemoattractant kc and the immunosuppressive cytokine , il - 10 were also elevated in the bal fluid after o3 exposure .
while the possibility was raised that these mediators could contribute to the up - regulation of sp - d , we found no evidence that lung epithelial cells would express receptor or show any functional response to exogenous il - 10 or kc [ 40 ] .
conclusion strain dependent differences in sp - d production are associated with differences in the severity of the inflammation .
the importance of sp - d in the protection against the initial o3 - induced injury and during the resolution of the inflammation is confirmed in sp - d knockout mice , as the absence of sp - d resulted in enhancement of the inflammation in these animals .
we propose that il - 6 may contribute to the up - regulation of sp - d expression , which in turn inhibits pro - inflammatory changes and promotes resolution of the inflammation following o3 exposure .

the trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 ( h3k27me3 ) by polycomb repressive complex 2 ( prc2 ) is essential for the repression of polycomb target genes .
however , the role of enzymatic demethylation of h3k27me3 by the kdm6 - family demethylases utx , uty , and jmjd3 is less clear .
studies in both mice and worms led to the proposal that kdm6 proteins , but not their h3k27me3 demethylase activity , is critical for normal development .
here , we investigated the requirement of the demethylase activity of the single kdm6 family member utx in drosophila .
we generated drosophila expressing a full - length but catalytically inactive utx protein and found that these mutants show the same phenotypes as animals lacking the utx protein .
specifically , animals lacking maternally deposited active utx demethylase in the early embryo show stochastic loss of hox gene expression that appears to be propagated in a clonal fashion .
this suggests that utx demethylase activity is critical for the removal of ectopic h3k27 trimethylation from active hox genes during the onset of zygotic gene transcription , and thereby prevents the inappropriate installment of long - term repression by polycomb .
conversely , maternally deposited catalytically active utx protein suffices to permit animals that lack zygotic expression of enzymatically active utx to develop into morphologically normal adults , which eclose from the pupal case but die shortly thereafter .
utx demethylase activity is therefore also essential to sustain viability in adult flies .
together , these analyses identify the earliest embryonic stages and the adult stage as two phases during the drosophila life cycle that critically require h3k27me3 demethylase activity .
polycomb trithorax utx h3k27me3 demethylation drosophila chromatin modifications have emerged as central mechanisms by which polycomb group ( pcg ) and trithorax group ( trxg ) protein complexes regulate the expression of genes that control development in animals and plants .
a key step for polycomb repression is the trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 ( h3k27me3 ) , which polycomb repressive complex 2 ( prc2 ) deposits across extended regions of chromatin at repressed genes .
h3k27me3 is thought to mark nucleosomes for interaction with prc1 , another pcg protein complex .
the central role of this methylation is illustrated by the finding that a histone h3k27r point mutation in drosophila reproduces the phenotype of mutants lacking prc2 or prc1 function ( pengelly et al. 2013 ; mckay et al. 2015 ) .
h3k27me3 appears to be a stable modification and h3k27me3 - containing nucleosomes have been shown to be transmitted to daughter - strand dna during dna replication ( alabert et al. 2015 ; coleman and struhl 2017 ; laprell et al. 2017 ) .
however , such transmitted h3k27me3 - modified nucleosomes provide only a short - term memory for polycomb repression ; long - term maintenance of this repression requires that prc2 methylates k27 on the newly incorporated h3 histones after every replication cycle ( coleman and struhl 2017 ; laprell et al. 2017 ) .
cell division - coupled dilution of h3k27me3 in the absence of methylation by prc2 would therefore provide a possible mechanism for converting a previously polycomb - repressed gene into an active gene .
about a decade ago , members of the lysine - specific demethylase 6 ( kdm6 ) family of histone demethylases were identified as enzymes that remove the h3k27me3 mark from nucleosomes ( agger et al. 2007 ; de santa et al. 2007 ; hong et al. 2007 ; lan et al. 2007 ; lee et al. 2007 ; walport et al. 2014 ) .
this discovery suggested that active demethylation of h3k27me3 might provide an alternative mechanism for activating polycomb - repressed genes .
the number of kdm6 paralogs varies between species .
the best - characterized kdm6 family member in animals is utx ( also known as ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein , x chromosome ) , a subunit of the mll3 / 4 complex in mammals and the orthologous trithorax - related complex in flies ( cho et al. 2007 ; issaeva et al. 2007 ; lee et al. 2007 ; mohan et al. 2011 ) .
genetic studies showed that utx and other kdm6 family proteins have important functions during the development of mice , flies , and worms .
however , the role of their h3k27me3 demethylase activities for these different functions is not well understood .
first , in mice , females homozygous for a deletion allele of the x - linked utx gene die as early embryos , but hemizygous males develop into viable and fertile adults .
the lack of a phenotype in males has been ascribed to compensation by the y - linked kdm6 protein uty ( also known as ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat - containing protein , y - linked ) , which has only poor catalytic activity in vitro and appears largely inactive in vivo ( shpargel et al. 2012 ; walport et al. 2014 ) .
consequently , the utx mutant phenotype in female mice was proposed to be due to the lack of utx protein and not a lack of its demethylase activity ( shpargel et al. 2012 ) .
second , male mice lacking both utx and the kdm6 paralogue jmj domain - containing protein 3 ( jmjd3 ) do not show more severe phenotypes than jmjd3 single mutants , suggesting that the two proteins do not act in a redundant fashion ( shpargel et al. 2014 ) .
finally , utx catalytic activity was reported to be dispensable for mesoderm differentiation in an embryonic stem cell model in vitro ( wang et al. 2012 ) .
collectively , these studies have therefore questioned the functional relevance of h3k27me3 demethylation by kdm6 proteins in mice .
similarly , in c. elegans , utx - 1 is essential for viability , but this phenotype was fully rescued by a transgene expressing a catalytically inactive utx - 1 protein , even in animals that also lacked the three jmjd3 paralogs ( vandamme et al. 2012 ) .
this led to the conclusion that h3k27me3 demethylation by kdm6 proteins is also dispensable in worms .
unlike in caenorhabditis elegans and mice , drosophila only contains a single kdm6 ortholog , called dutx ( smith et al. 2008 ; herz et al. 2010 ) .
drosophila utx null mutants that contain maternally deposited utx protein during the early stages of embryogenesis develop into adults that show normal morphology but die shortly after eclosing ( copur and muller 2013 ) .
however , animals lacking both maternally deposited and zygotically expressed utx protein die during larval development , and they fail to maintain expression of multiple hox genes in different tissues ( copur and muller 2013 ) .
such utx null mutant animals therefore show classic trxg phenotypes .
in this study , we used a genetic rescue strategy to investigate whether these phenotypes are due to the lack of utx h3k27me3 demethylase activity .
our analyses show that utx catalytic activity is essential for the viability of drosophila and plays a prominent role in the regulation of hox gene expression .
materials and methods a genomic bac clone ( ch321 - 26e08 ) that contains the entire utx gene was obtained from the bacpac resources center .
the wild - type gutxwt rescue construct contained sequences from the ch321 - 26e08 bac clone , which we amplified with the 5 ' - gacggtacccagggctacaccaatatcaaccaattg - 3 ' and 5 ' - gatcggattcccgagcaaacacatctaaggccaaaggag - 3 ' primers ( genomic coordinates r1.17 chr2l : 10272223 - 10279218 ) and subcloned into a topo cloning vector ( thermofisher ) .
to generate gutxcd , the cac and gag codons for his883 and glu885 , respectively , were mutated to gcc and gcg , respectively , to generate the his883ala , glu885ala mutant .
gutxwt and gutxcd dna inserts in the topo vector were then cloned into an attb vector and inserted into the 86fb attp landing site by using the phic31 - based integration method .

results and discussion the active site of the fe ( ii ) - and alpha - ketoglutarate - dependent dioxygenase utx is highly conserved between flies and humans .
structural and biochemical studies on human utx established that the his1146 and glu1148 residues form the fe ( ii ) - binding motif , and that mutation of these two residues to ala abolishes h3k27me3 demethylase activity of utx in vitro ( sengoku and yokoyama 2011 ) .
moreover , mutation of the corresponding his914 and asp916 residues in c. elegans utx - 1 was shown to abolish its demethylase activity in vivo ( vandamme et al. 2012 ) .
we analyzed the phenotype of drosophila expressing a catalytically inactive utx protein with the fe ( ii ) - binding his883 and glu885 residues mutated to ala , as follows .
we generated transgenes containing a genomic utx fragment expressing either the wild - type utx protein ( gutxwt ) , or the catalytically inactive utx protein with the his883ala / glu885ala mutations ( gutxcd , figure 1a ) .
the gutxwt and gutxcd transgenes were then introduced into the genetic background of animals carrying a deletion of the endogenous utx locus ( utxdelta ) .
as previously reported , utxdelta animals lack detectable levels of full - length utx protein ( figure 1b , lanes 1 and 2 ; copur and muller 2013 ) .
importantly , the transgene - encoded wild - type and utxcd mutant proteins were both expressed at wild - type levels in such utxdelta animals ( figure 1b , lanes 3 and 4 ) .

( b ) western blot analysis of total extracts from imaginal disc and central nervous system tissues from third - instar larvae of the indicated genotypes probed with antibodies against utx protein and , as loading control , caf1 protein .
note that in utxdelta homozygotes ( utxdelta z - ) , the transgene - encoded utxwt and utxcd proteins ( lanes 3 and 4 ) are present at levels comparable to the levels of utx protein in wild - type ( wt ) larvae ( lane 1 ) .
( c ) survival of wt animals and of animals of the indicated genotypes to adulthood .
utxdelta m - z - animals obtained using the ovod technique all arrest development before reaching the pupal stage ( 0 animals surviving into adults , asterisk ) .
utxdelta homozygous animals carrying the gutxwt transgene ( utxdelta m - z - + gutxwt ) can be maintained as a healthy strain with survival rates comparable to wt. utxdelta m - z - animals carrying the gutxcd transgene ( utxdelta m - z - + gutxcd ) , obtained using the ovod technique , all arrest development before reaching the pupal stage ( 0 animals surviving into adults , asterisk ) .
for each genotype , the value of survival to adulthood was calculated by collecting three independent batches with of 100 first instar larvae , transferring the three batches of larvae into independent vials and determining the number of eclosed adults in each vial .
survival to adulthood values (%) represent mean values from the three batches and error bars indicate sd .
( d ) haltere imaginal discs from larvae that were wt or the indicated utx genotypes stained with antibody against ubx protein ( ubx ) and hoechst ( dna ) .
in wt animals , ubx is expressed in all cells of the haltere disc with the strongest levels detected in cells in the pouch .
in utxdelta m - z - animals , ubx protein is undetectable in clone - like large contiguous patches of cells ( asterisk marks the single large patch seen in this disc ) , whereas adjoining cells express apparently undiminished levels of ubx protein .
in utxdelta m - z - + gutxwt animals , ubx expression is indistinguishable from wt animals .
utxdelta m - z - + gutxcd animals show loss of ubx protein expression in clone - like large patches of cells ( asterisk marks the single large patch seen in this disc ) , similar to utxdelta m - z - animals .
we first analyzed the requirement for utx catalytic activity for adult viability .
utxdelta homozygous animals derived from heterozygous mothers ( utxdelta z - ) die as adults , shortly within 1 - 2 days after eclosing from the pupal case .
this phenotype was fully rescued by the utxwt but not by the catalytically inactive utxcd protein .
specifically , utxdelta homozygous animals carrying the gutxwt transgene ( utxdelta gutxwt ) were viable , fertile , and could be maintained as a healthy strain .
in contrast , utxdelta gutxcd animals developed into morphologically normal - looking adults that died within 1 - 2 days after eclosing from the pupal case ( n > 500 ) , like utxdelta animals carrying no transgene ( n > 500 ) .
this shows that utx demethylase activity is essential for adult viability .
previous studies demonstrated a critical role of utx protein during the earliest stages of drosophila embryogenesis ( copur and muller 2013 ) .
specifically , utxdelta mutant animals that are derived from females with utxdelta mutant germ cells and therefore lack not only zygotic expression of utx but also maternally deposited utx protein ( utxdelta m - z - animals ) are unable to complete development and die as larvae ( copur and muller 2013 ) .
because the utxdelta gutxcd animals described above still contained maternally deposited wild - type utx protein , we next generated mutant embryos in which both the maternally deposited and the zygotically expressed utx protein were catalytically inactive ( utxdelta m - z - gutx cd ) .
as illustrated in figure 1c , utxdelta m - z - gutx cd animals failed to develop into adults and died during the larval stages , like utxdelta m - z - animals ( figure 1c ) .
as noted above , utxdelta m - z - gutxwt animals could be maintained as a healthy strain with survival rates comparable to wild - type ( figure 1c ) .
we conclude that utx demethylase activity is critically required for normal embryonic and larval development .
next , we investigated whether utx demethylase activity is required for the normal regulation of hox gene expression .
we monitored the expression of the hox gene ultrabithorax ( ubx ) in utxdelta m - z - , utxdelta m - z - gutx wt , and utxdelta m - z - gutx cd mutant larvae .
in wild - type larvae , ubx protein is expressed in all cells of the haltere imaginal discs ( figure 1d ) .
in utxdelta m - z - mutant larvae , ubx expression is lost in a patchy pattern from large areas of both haltere discs in each larva ( n = 56 larvae ; figure 1d ) .
the transgene - encoded utxwt protein restored the normal ubx expression pattern in all utxdelta m - z - gutxwt animals ( n = 45 larvae ; figure 1d ) .
in contrast , the utxcd protein was unable to rescue the phenotype , and utxdelta m - z - gutx cd animals showed the same patchy loss of ubx expression as utxdelta m - z - mutants ( n = 52 larvae ; figure 1d ) .
utx demethylase activity is therefore important for normal hox gene expression .
conclusions an important genetic test to understand the mechanism of proteins that possess enzymatic activities is to validate that mutants expressing a catalytically inactive but otherwise intact form of the protein show the same phenotype as mutants lacking the protein .
this is particularly critical for enzymatic subunits that are part of multi - protein assemblies where they often also play an architectural role , as is the case in many chromatin - modifying complexes .
here , we show that drosophila expressing catalytically inactive but full - length utx protein reproduce the phenotype of an utx gene deletion mutant .
unlike in c. elegans ( vandamme et al. 2012 ) , lack of utx demethylase activity in drosophila is deleterious to development and viability .
here , we focused on the role of utx enzymatic activity for the regulation of the hox gene ubx , which we previously identified as a prominent target gene requiring utx function ( copur and muller 2013 ) .
like in mutants lacking utx protein , animals that lack utx h3k27me3 demethylase activity during the earliest stages of embryogenesis develop into third - instar larvae that show loss of ubx expression in imaginal disc tissues .
the loss of ubx expression in large contiguous regions of these tissues , juxtaposed to cells with apparently undiminished levels of expression ( figure 1d ) , implies that ubx expression was stochastically lost in a fraction of cells early in development and that this loss was then clonally propagated .
recent studies have reported that h3k27me3 present at polycomb target genes in the oocyte is maintained and propagated throughout the early cleavage cycles , and is required to prevent precocious transcription of these genes during zygotic gene activation at the blastoderm stage ( zenk et al. 2017 ) .
during subsequent development , in postblastoderm embryos , the h3k27me3 profiles are then resolved , as recently demonstrated at hox genes ; in cells where hox genes are repressed , their chromatin becomes fully decorated with h3k27me3 , thus enabling long - term polycomb repression , and in cells where they are transcribed , their chromatin becomes devoid of h3k27me3 ( bowman et al. 2014 ) .
we propose that h3k27me3 demethylation by utx is critical during the establishment of these h3k27me3 - deficient chromatin states .
we envisage that , in the absence of h3k27me3 demethylation by utx , prc2 also establishes high levels of h3k27me3 at target genes in some of the cells where these genes should be expressed .
the stochastic loss of hox gene expression in utx mutants in those cells would therefore reflect aberrant installment of polycomb repression , analogous to what has been observed in mutants that lack other trxg regulators ( klymenko and muller 2004 ; papp and muller 2006 ) .

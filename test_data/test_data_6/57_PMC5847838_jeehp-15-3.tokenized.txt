the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) has clearly emphasized the importance of pediatricians communicating and collaborating with primary and secondary schools on the clinical care of their patients .
the aap has published the seventh edition of " school health : policy and practice " [ 1 ] , which outlines specific competencies and roles that pediatricians should undertake in coordinating care with schools and school providers , including nurses , counselors , school psychologists , teachers , and administrators .
the aap endorses the need for collaboration with schools in other ways as well , such as through their practice parameter guidelines for specific behavioral health conditions ; for example , the aap guidelines for attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) emphasize that a consideration of the school environment , program , or placement should be part of any treatment plan [ 2 ] .
the purpose of this opinion piece was to assess residents' attitudes towards and experiences with communication and collaboration with schools in a pediatric residency training program at geisinger medical center in the united states .
all residents included in this study provided informed consent for participation in the study .
it was approved by the institutional review board of geisinger medical center ( irb no. , 2015 - 0432 ) .
the survey participants consisted of 40 of the 42 pediatric residents at geisinger medical center , danville , pennsylvania , usa ( 14 of the 14 first - year residents , 13 of the 14 second - year residents , and 13 of the 14 third - year residents ) .
the 2 missing residents were excluded by chance ( scheduled vacation or off day ) .
surveys were administered during residents' morning report time slot during the july 2016 to july 2017 training year .
the participants completed the attitudes and experiences in school health collaboration survey ( table 1 ) .
this survey consisted of 9 total items and took approximately 6 minutes to complete .
data were analyzed descriptively to evaluate how often the participants endorsed the 4 - point likert - type scale items pertaining to " attitudes " and the items pertaining to " experiences " in school health collaboration .
item no .
6 was an open - ended question asking participants to list the barriers that they perceived in collaborating with school personnel .
(" what barriers , if any , are there in collaborating with school personnel ?") these items were grouped into a total of 6 categories that were created for each set of similar responses .
the survey results are presented in table 1 .
raw data were available from supplement 1 .
more than half of the respondents collaborated and / or communicated with school personnel .
four - fifths strongly or very strongly felt that collaboration / communication with schools contributed to improved patient care .
the most important topic of communication with schools was reported to be adhd .
based on the results from the open - ended item , the following themes , which were reflected by more than 1 response , were identified : lack of time ( n = 22 ) , incompatibility of work schedules ( n = 7 ) , do not know who to contact ( n = 8 ) , do not know how to contact ( n = 6 ) , perception of schools as unable to provide adequate support ( n = 4 ) , and privacy / health insurance portability and accountability act concerns ( n = 2 ) .
specific responses are available in supplement 1 .
the results should be interpreted in light of the limitations of this study .
the survey instrument was developed by the author , and a psychometric validation of the measure was not conducted due to the small sample size .
data were self - reported .
although these findings are from a single pediatric residency training program in the united states , they offer some interesting findings and suggest the need for further exploration .
residents generally recognized the value of collaborating / communicating with schools regarding patient care and believed that doing so contributed to a higher standard of care ( table 1 ) .
early exposure to the local schools and school personnel through school - based immersion experiences should be provided through methods such as shadowing , presentations , and shared - care projects with medical and school providers .
activities of this type may provide an imprinting function by demonstrating the relevant school personnel and through the choice of a topic that is ideal for collaboration .
sufficient time for communicating with school teachers , school nurses , counselors , or school psychologists should be allocated during the pediatric resident training program .
conflict of interest no potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported .

data from randomized clinical trials with metabolic outcomes can be used to address concerns about potential issues of cardiovascular safety for newer drugs for type 2 diabetes .
this meta - analysis was designed to assess cardiovascular safety of glp - 1 receptor agonists .
design and methods .
medline , embase , and cochrane databases were searched for randomized trials of glp - 1 receptor agonists ( versus placebo or other comparators ) with a duration >= 12 weeks , performed in type 2 diabetic patients .
mantel - haenszel odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval ( mh - or ) was calculated for major cardiovascular events ( mace ) , on an intention - to - treat basis , excluding trials with zero events. results .
out of 36 trials , 20 reported at least one mace .
the mh - or for all glp - 1 receptor agonists was 0.74 ( 0.50 - 1.08 ) , p = . 12 ( 0.85 ( 0.50 - 1.45 ) , p = . 55 , and 0.69 ( 0.40 - 1.22 ) , p = . 20 , for exenatide and liraglutide , resp. ) .
corresponding figures for placebo - controlled and active comparator studies were 0.46 ( 0.25 - 0.83 ) , p = . 009 , and 1.05 ( 0.63 - 1.76 ) , p = . 84 , respectively. conclusions .
to date , results of randomized trials do not suggest any detrimental effect of glp - 1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular events .
specifically designed longer - term trials are needed to verify the possibility of a beneficial effect .
1. introduction cardiovascular safety is a growing concern for drugs used for chronic conditions , such as diabetes .
among glucose - lowering agents , sulfonylureas [ 1 , 2 ] , insulin [ 3 , 4 ] , and thiazolidinediones [ 5 - 7 ] , have been suspected of adverse cardiovascular effects , although some of those preoccupations have not been confirmed [ 8 - 11 ] .
following these concerns , the food and drug administration issued a guidance for companies submitting new chemical entities as treatments for type 2 diabetes , requiring that , either in phase ii - iii trials , or in a subsequent phase iv specifically designed randomized clinical trial , a sufficient amount of information is collected so as to exclude a risk increase of over 30 % ( i.e. , the upper limit - - two - sided - - of 95 % confidence interval for major cardiovascular events , in comparison with placebo and / or other treatments , should not exceed 1.30 ; http :// www.fda.gov / downloads / drugs / guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation / guidances / ucm071627.pdf ) .
two glp - 1 receptor agonists ( exenatide and liraglutide ) have been approved for human use , and several others are currently under clinical development .
it has been observed that chronic stimulation of glp - 1 receptors could produce beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors [ 12 ] ; furthermore , preliminary data on humans suggest that glp - 1 could have direct effects on myocardial function [ 13 ] .
however , no major trial assessing the effects of glp - 1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is available to date , nor will it be for a few years .
in the meantime , the information on incident cases recorded as adverse events during trials designed for metabolic endpoints could provide some hints on the possible cardiovascular profile of these drugs .
this meta - analysis was designed to assess the effect of glp - 1 receptor agonists , compared with placebo or active hypoglycemic drugs , on major cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients , as derived from randomized controlled trials .
2. research design and methods 2.1 .
data sources and searches an extensive medline , embase , and cochrane database search for " exenatide ," " liraglutide ," " albiglutide ," " taspoglutide ," " lixisenatide ," and " semaglutide " was performed , collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to november 1th , 2010 .
the identification of relevant abstracts , the selection of studies based on the criteria described above , and the subsequent data extraction were performed independently by two of the authors ( e. mannucci and m. monami ) , and conflicts resolved by the third investigator ( n. marchionni ) .
completed but still unpublished trials were identified through a search of http :// www.clinicaltrials.gov / website .
food and drug administration ( fda , http :// www.fda.gov /) and european medicines agency ( emea , http :// www.ema.europa.eu /) reviews of approved drugs , as well as published information provided to fda in response to queries during the approval process , were also searched for retrieval of unpublished trials .
2.2 .
study selection a meta - analysis was performed including all randomized clinical trials with a duration of at least 12 weeks , either with a cross - over or a parallel series design , enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes , comparing glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor agonists with placebo or active drugs ( oral hypoglycemic agents and / or insulin ) of other classes .
trials enrolling nondiabetic , or type 1 diabetic , subjects were also excluded .
no review protocol was published elsewhere .
2.3 .
data extraction and quality assessment results of unpublished trials ( characteristics of patients enrolled , treatments , and major cardiovascular events ) were retrieved , if available , on http :// www.clinicaltrials.gov / , http :// www.novonordisk - trials.com / website / content / trial - results.aspx , http :// www.lillytrials.com / results / results.html , or http :// www.clinicalstudyresults.org / ; food and drug administration ( fda , http :// www.fda.gov /) and european medicines agency ( emea , http :// www.ema.europa.eu /) reviews of approved drugs , as well as published information provided to fda in response to queries during the approval process , were also searched for retrieval of unpublished information .
all those sources were also used to complete information on results of published trials , when not reported in publications .
for all published trials , results reported in papers were used as the primary source of information , when available .
the quality of trials was assessed using some of the parameters proposed by jadad et al .
[ 14 ] .
the score was not used as a criterion for the selection of trials whereas some items were used only for descriptive purposes .
2.4 .
data synthesis and analysis the principal outcome was the effect of glp - 1 receptor agonists , compared with other hypoglycemic agents or placebo , on major cardiovascular events ( mace ) as defined in the list provided by fda for this purpose ( http :// www.fda.gov / downloads / advisorycommittees / committeesmeetingmaterials / drugs / endocrinologicandmetabolicdrugsadvisorycommittee / ucm148659.pdf ) , including cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke , and hospitalizations due to acute coronary syndromes and / or heart failure .
predefined separate analyses were performed for trials with different glp - 1 receptor agonists , whenever possible .
mantel - haenszel odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval ( mh - or ) was calculated for each of the events defined above , on an intention - to - treat basis , excluding trials with zero events .
a random effect model was used because of the impossibility of a reliable assessment of heterogeneity , due to the small number of events in each trial [ 15 ] .
publication bias was not assessed , considering that the small number of adverse cardiovascular events in each study was irrelevant for the decision to publish trials with metabolic endpoints .
the main expected bias is represented by the fact that the trials included were designed for noncardiovascular ( metabolic ) endpoint ; this means that cardiovascular events were reported only as adverse events , without any systematic screening or predefined diagnostic criteria .
the meta - analysis was reported following the prisma checklist [ 16 ] .
all analyses were performed using comprehensive meta - analysis version 2 , biostat ( englewood , nj , usa ) and spss 16.0 .
this research was performed independently of any funding , as part of the institutional activity of the investigators .
3. results the trial flow is summarized in figure 1 .
a total of 36 trials , 3 of which unpublished , were retrieved .
information on major cardiovascular events was reported in 33 trials , 20 of which with at least one event .
the analysis on mace was therefore performed on 20 trials , enrolling 6,490 and 3,995 patients ( 3.467 and 2.172 patient * years ) in the glp - 1 receptor agonist and comparator groups , respectively .
the characteristics of the retrieved trials , and of those which resulted to be complete but were undisclosed , or did not report information on mace , are summarized in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 .
the total number of patients with events was 65 ( 0.01 %) and 49 ( 0.01 %) in the glp - 1 receptor agonists and comparator groups , respectively .
treatment with the experimental drugs was not associated with an increased incidence of mace ( mh - or.0.74 ( 0.50 - 1.08 ) ; p = . 12 ) .
a significant reduction of cardiovascular events with glp - 1 receptor agonists was observed in placebo - controlled trials but not in studies versus active comparators ( figure 2 ) .
no consistent pattern suggesting differences between exenatide and liraglutide emerged across analyses .
in comparisons with insulin ( 5 trials with events ) and sulfonylureas ( 4 trials with events ) , the mh - or for glp - 1 receptor agonists was 1.77 ( 0.91 - 3.44 ) , p = . 09 , and 0.49 ( 0.22 - 1.10 ) , p = . 085 , respectively .
all - cause mortality was reported in 33 trials , 9 of which with at least one event ( 8 and 7 ) in glp - 1 receptor agonists and comparator , respectively ; mh - or for experimental drugs was 0.67 [ 0.26 - 1.78 ] , p = . 43 .
4. conclusions the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is one of the main aims of long - term treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes .
therefore , the possibility of an increased cardiovascular risk associated with some hypoglycemic treatments [ 1 , 3 - 7 ] is almost paradoxical .
although some data on adverse cardiovascular effects of specific drugs were not confirmed by subsequent investigations [ 8 - 11 ] , the concerns of health authorities about the safety of new compounds appear to be justified ( http :// www.fda.gov / downloads / drugs / guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation / guidances / ucm071627.pdf ) .
in order to reach definitive conclusions on cardiovascular safety of any drug , large - scale , long - term trials should be performed prior to marketing ; unfortunately , this effort would be economically unfeasible for pharmaceutical companies .
the fda accepted a compromise , allowing the organization of such trials after drug approval , as a condition for the maintenance of marketing authorization .
the limit of this approach is that cardiovascular safety of new drugs will be established only several years after their approval , leaving clinicians without reliable information on this critical point in the meantime .
meta - analyses of cardiovascular events recorded as adverse events in randomized clinical trials designed for other purposes can represent an additional source of information .
this approach has several limitations , most notably the lack of predefined diagnostic criteria and screening methods for incident cardiovascular disease , with the risk of misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis .
it should also be recognized that in some of the trials included , cardiovascular events were reported only as adverse events , without being prospectively adjudicated .
moreover , the limited duration of trials designed for metabolic purposes can impair their ability to detect longer - term effects on atherogenesis .
furthermore , the meta - analysis of small trials with few events each poses some specific , and complex , statistical problems [ 17 ] .
all these limitations affected the reliability of results of some meta - analyses [ 6 , 7 ] on cardiovascular safety of hypoglycemic drugs [ 10 , 17 , 18 ] .
those considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the results of the present meta - analysis , which exclude , at least in the short term , any major adverse effect of glp - 1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular morbidity .
interestingly , those drugs , as a class , are below to the 1.3 threshold chosen by the fda for the upper limit of 95 % confidence interval to establish the cardiovascular safety of a new drug .
interestingly , a significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity with glp - 1 receptor agonists was observed in comparison with placebo .
this result should be discussed with great caution , considering the limitations highlighted above ; in fact , a meta - analysis of trials performed for different ( noncardiovascular ) endpoints provides reliable information on safety , but not on efficacy .
speculatively , several mechanisms could underlie a beneficial effect of glp - 1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular risk .
reduction of blood glucose , body weight , and blood pressure , as well as favorable effects on lipid profile , have all been reported .
direct myocardial effects of glp - 1 receptor stimulation could theoretically reduce the functional impact of myocardial ischemia [ 13 ] , leading to clinical improvements .
however , the possibility of a beneficial action of glp - 1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular events should be confirmed through specifically designed randomized clinical trials .
in conclusion , glp - 1 receptor agonists do not appear to increase cardiovascular morbidity in comparison with placebo or other active drugs .
any possible beneficial action should be assessed in further trials .

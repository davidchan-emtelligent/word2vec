background there is emerging evidence that antidepressants may be effective in preventing patients with non - specific and psychotic - like prodromal symptoms , defined as patients at ultra - high risk ( uhr ) of psychotic disorder , from transitioning to psychosis .
however , the mechanism of such an effect is still unknown .
methods we report the case of a 19 - year - old japanese man determined to be at uhr of psychotic disorder in whom fluvoxamine ( one of the antidepressants with sigma - 1 receptor agonism ) showed preventive effects on psychotic - like prodromal symptoms .
results our patient 's depressive symptoms were reduced and maintained below remission as a result of treatment with 100 mg / day of fluvoxamine .
in addition , it is likely that an additional dose of fluvoxamine ( 50 mg / day ) improved his psychotic - like prodromal symptoms directly , independent of its antidepressive effects .
conclusion fluvoxamine , a sigma - 1 receptor agonist , may be effective in preventing patients at uhr of psychotic disorder from onset of psychosis via its neuroprotective / neurotropic actions , independent of its antidepressive effects .
background in the past decade there has been increasing interest in the potential benefit of early pharmacological intervention in psychotic disorders .
patients with psychotic disorders show non - specific and psychotic - like prodromal symptoms preceding the onset of frank psychosis .
interestingly , there is emerging evidence that antidepressants may be effective in preventing patients who are at ultra - high risk ( uhr ) of psychotic disorder from transitioning to psychosis [ 1 ] .
however , it is still unknown whether such prevention of psychosis onset by antidepressants is due to their antidepressive effects , such as mood improvement , or other pharmacological effects , such as neuroprotection .
we present the case of a patient at uhr of psychotic disorder in which fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( ssri ) administered alone , prevented the onset of psychosis , independent of its antidepressive effects .
case presentation the patient was a 19 - year - old japanese unmarried office worker with no personal or familial history of psychiatric problems .
on presentation he complained of deterioration of his work performance .
he had suffered from anhedonia , insomnia , loss of appetite , concentration deficit , and a sense of guilt for over 1 month , and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , 4th edition , text revision ( dsm - iv - tr ) criteria .
his baseline score on the 17 - item hamilton depression rating scale ( ham - d ) was 23 points [ 2 ] , and his global assessment of functioning ( gaf ) score was 55 points [ 3 ] .
treatment with 50 mg / day of fluvoxamine was started .
then , 3 weeks later , his depressive symptoms improved and his fluvoxamine dose was increased to 100 mg / day .
at 7 months after the start of treatment , his depressive symptoms disappeared ( ham - d score : 6 ) .
during the next 5 months , his quality of life ( qol ) remained stable with satisfactory performance in his work ( gaf score : 80 ) .
about 1 year after the start of treatment , the patient 's work performance deteriorated suddenly ( gaf : 65 ) despite continuous treatment with 100 mg / day of fluvoxamine , without any concurrent symptoms of depression such as depressive mood or anhedonia .
then , 2 months later , he reported having a peculiar , highly confusing sensation that two work colleagues who were living in the same dormitory had spoken ill of him , unfairly accusing him of wearing unwashed clothes , among other things .
in response , he had begun to delay his meal and bath times in order to shun contact with them , and to do his laundry several times a day .
his qol was highly disturbed and his work performance had worsened accordingly ( gaf : 50 ) .
his disordered thoughts of persecution persisted for several months , and he was therefore diagnosed with uhr ( attenuated psychosis group ) under the criteria of the comprehensive assessment of at - risk mental states [ 4 ] .
his fluvoxamine dose was increased to 125 mg / day .
then , 1 month later , he began to relax his efforts to avoid his colleagues and his qol improved ( gaf : 65 ) .
his fluvoxamine dose was further increased to 150 mg / day .
at 1 month after that , he said brightly ' i do n't care about them so much ' , and his qol improved still further ( gaf : 80 ) .
treatment with 150 mg / day of fluvoxamine was maintained , and his qol remained stable with satisfactory performance in his work , which lasted for more than 2 years of follow - up. ethical approval the treatment of the reported case was made according to standard clinical practice , and ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of sodegaura satsukidai hospital , japan .
discussion to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report showing that fluvoxamine alone prevented a uhr patient from onset of psychosis .
in this case , the patient 's depressive symptoms were reduced and maintained below remission as a result of treatment with 100 mg / day of fluvoxamine .
therefore , it is estimated that the additional dose of fluvoxamine ( 50 mg / day ) improved his psychotic - like prodromal symptoms directly , independent of its antidepressive effects .
although the treatment with fluvoxamine modified the natural course of the case , psychotic - like symptoms never appeared during the major depressive episode .
furthermore , the patient 's idea of persecution by his colleagues was odd and incongruent with his mood .
therefore , we estimated that both his psychotic - like symptoms and depressive symptoms were the prodromal symptoms of a uhr patient , rather than symptoms of psychotic major depression .
previously , hafner et al. studied untreated psychotic and depressive symptoms retrospectively from onset until first admission , and demonstrated that delusional misinterpretations or delusional references were highly specific to schizophrenia ( 80.3 % schizophrenia vs 6.2 % unipolar depression ) , although the frequency of depressive symptoms showed surprising similarities between the two studied groups [ 5 ] .
although most antidepressants share blockade of serotonin transporters as a core mechanism , we reported that some antidepressants possess high to moderate affinity for the endoplasmic reticulum protein sigma - 1 receptors [ 6 ] , which are implicated in neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity [ 7 - 10 ] .
among all antidepressants , including ssris and typical tricyclic antidepressants , fluvoxamine has shown the most potent action at sigma - 1 receptors , suggesting that sigma - 1 receptors might be involved in fluvoxamine 's mechanisms of action [ 6 ] .
in cell culture systems , fluvoxamine , but not sertraline or paroxetine , stimulated nerve growth factor - induced neurite outgrowth in pc12 cells , and the effect of fluvoxamine was antagonized by treatment with the selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonist ne - 100 [ 11,12 ] , suggesting that the agonism of fluvoxamine plays a role in neuronal plasticity .
we have previously hypothesized that the sigma - 1 receptor agonist fluvoxamine might reduce the risk of subsequent transition to psychosis via its neuroprotective / neurotrophic actions [ 13 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report supporting our hypothesis .
conclusions this case suggests that fluvoxamine , a sigma - 1 receptor agonist , may be effective in preventing patients at uhr of psychotic disorder from onset of psychosis .
more detailed randomized , double - blind placebo - controlled studies using a large sample size will be needed to confirm this .

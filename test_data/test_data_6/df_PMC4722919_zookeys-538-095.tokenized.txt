doi : 10.3897 / zookeys.538.6722 introduction the corixoidea , known as water boatmen , are moderately large to small aquatic insects , belonging to the true bug infraorder nepomorpha .
according to schuh and slater ( 1995 ) , corixoidea include the only family corixidae , with six subfamilies : corixinae , cymatiainae , diaprepocorinae , heterocorixinae , stenocorixinae , and micronectinae .
nieser ( 2002a , b ) raised diaprepocorinae and micronectinae to a family rank , meaning that corixoidea is comprised of three families only : corixidae , micronectidae , and diaprepocoridae .
the validity of nieser 's ( 2002b ) system was criticised by andersen and weir ( 2004 ) , but accepted by the majority of other authors ( tinerella 2008 , grozeva et al. 2008 , konopko et al. 2010 , weirauch and schuh 2011 , fent et al. 2011 ) .
chromosome data is currently available for micronectidae as well as for the corixid subfamilies corixinae and cymatiainae .
in micronectidae all four hitherto studied species were reported to have achiasmate male meiosis and no m - chromosomes : three species of micronecta kirkaldy , 1897 display 2n = 24 ( 22a + xy ) , while one species of tenagobia bergroth , 1899 has 2n = 30 ( 28 + xy ) ( ituarte and papeschi 2004 , grozeva et al. 2008 ) .
in corixinae , all 30 studied has species from eight genera were shown to share common characteristics in males : chiasmate meiosis , sex chromosome post - reduction , presence of a pair of m - chromosomes , and karyotype with 2n = 24 ( 20 + 2m + xy ) ( ueshima 1979 , waller and angus 2005 , bressa and papeschi 2007 ) .
cymatiainae consist of two genera , cymatia flor , 1860 with dispersed holarctic and oriental distributions and the monotypic cnethocymatia jansson , 1982 from northern australia and new guinea ( stys and jansson 1988 ) .
for the only studied species of cymatiainae , cymatia bonsdorffi ( sahlberg , 1819 ) , the karyotype with 2n = 26 ( 24 + xy ) was reported with no information on m - chromosomes and presence / absence of chiasmata in male meiosis ( slack 1938 , southwood and leston 1959 ) .
in meiosis , the chiasmata are known to tie homologous chromosomes together until their separation in the reductional division .
however , in some animal groups , instead of chiasma formation , an achiasmate type of meiosis is observed , being , as a rule , restricted to the heterogametic sex ( white 1973 ) .
in true bugs , when achiasmate meiosis presents , it seems to be stable and marks taxa at the rank of family ( grozeva et al. 2008a ) .
until the present time , this meiotic pattern has been found in seven families of heteroptera , belonging to the infraorders nepomorpha , leptopodomorpha and cimicomorpha ( see kuznetsova et al. 2011 for references ) .
in the present paper , the karyotype and male meiosis of other two cymatia species , cymatia rogenhoferi ( fieber , 1864 ) and cymatia coleoptrata ( fabricius , 1777 ) , were studied .
the focal point of this work was to clarify the presence or absence of chiasmata in spermatocyte meiosis of these species .
material and methods five males of cymatia rogenhoferi and two males of cymatia coleoptrata were collected by light trap and hydrobiological net in different localities ( table 1 ) .
males of cymatia coleoptrata were fixed in 3:1 fixative ( 96 % ethanol : glacial acetic acid mixture ) in the field immediately after capturing .
males of cymatia rogenhoferi were fixed in the field in 95 % ethanol for subsequent sequencing , and the abdomen was transferred in 3:1 fixative for chromosome analysis , as it has been done recently by nokkala et al .
( 2015 ) for cacopsylla myrtilli ( w. wagner , 1947 ) ( psylloidea ) .
the gonads were dissected out and squashed in a small drop of 45 % acetic acid .
the cover slip was removed using dry ice .
slides were dehydrated in fresh fixative ( 3:1 ) and air dried .
the preparations were stained using schiff - giemsa method ( grozeva and nokkala 1996 ) .

all preparations and remains of the specimens are stored at the institute of biodiversity and ecosystem research ( iber ) , bas in sofia , bulgaria .
results cymatia rogenhoferi , 2n = 33 ( 28a + 2m + x1x2y ) the testes of the adult males were full of sperm , with a small number of well - synchronised dividing cells .
no spermatogonial metaphases were observed .
when condensing from a diffuse stage ( figs 1a , b , c ) , the autosomal bivalents consisted of side - by - side aligned homologous chromosomes without chiasmata , and the sex chromosomes appeared as a positively heteropycnotic body .
no diplotene and diakinesis were present .
at metaphase i ( mi ) , the bivalents laid parallel to the equatorial plane , with the homologous chromosomes facing opposite poles without any sign of chiasmata .
clearly , male meiosis of this species is achiasmate .
both mi and mii were radial ( figs 2 , 3 ) .
at mi , 14 autosomal bivalents and three univalent sex chromosomes ( two x and one y ) formed a ring with , a pair of very small and negatively heteropycnotic m - chromosomes inside .
in contrast to mi , the mii ring was formed by 14 autosomes and one m - chromosome , while the sex chromosomes formed a pseudo - trivalent placed inside the ring .
the y chromosome was clearly larger than each of the two x chromosomes ( fig. 3 ) .
the first division was thus reductional for the autosomes and m - chromosomes , but equational for the sex chromosomes ( post - reduction ) .
the chromosome formula of cymatia rogenhoferi was determined as 2n = 33 ( 28a + 2m + x1x2y ) .

male meiosis in cymatia species .
1 - 3 cymatia rogenhoferi : a - c early condensation stages 2 mi from the pole .
the bivalents ( consisting of two side - by - side aligned chromosomes facing the opposite poles ) and three univalent sex chromosomes ( two x and one y ) form a ring , with a pair of very small and negatively heteropycnotic m - chromosomes in its centre 3 mii .
the autosomes and m - chromosome form a ring , with pseudo - trivalent of the sex chromosomes in its centre 4 - 7 cymatia coleoptrata : a , b early condensation stages 5 mi from the pole .
the bivalents ( consisting of two side - by - side aligned chromosomes ) and two univalent sex chromosomes ( x and y ) form a ring , with a pair of very small and negatively heteropycnotic m - chromosomes in its centre 6 mi from the equator.the homologous autosomes can be seen lying parallel 7 late mi and ai plates .
scale bar = 10 microm .
cymatia coleoptrata , 2n = 24 ( 20a + 2m + xy ) the behaviour of chromosomes during the first spermatocyte division was quite similar to that in cymatia rogenhoferi .
unfortunately , we found no second division stages in the two males explored here .
when condensing from the diffuse stage ( figs 4a , b ) , the autosomal bivalents consisted of parallel aligned homologous chromosomes without traces of chiasmata , and the sex chromosomes appeared as a positively heteropycnotic body .
no diplotene and diakinesis were observed .
at metaphase i ( mi ) , the bivalents were aligned parallel to the equatorial plane , with the homologous chromosomes facing opposite poles without any signs of chiasmata .
the mi plates were radial ( fig. 5 ) , with 10 autosomal bivalents and two univalent sex chromosomes ( x and y ) forming a ring and a pair of very small and negatively heteropycnotic m - chromosomes placing inside it. the x chromosome was larger than the y. side by side association of homologous autosomes was still preserved at mi ( figs 5 , 6 ) and anaphase i ( ai ) ( fig. 7 ) , when the homologs moved in parallel to the opposite poles .
clearly , male meiosis of this species is achiasmate .
the first division was reductional for the autosomes and m - chromosomes , but equational for the sex chromosomes ( post - reduction ) .
the chromosome formula of cymatia coleoptrata was determined as 2n = 24 ( 20a + 2m + xy ) .
discussion the main goal of this paper was to address the cytogenetic features of two species of cymatia and compare them with those encountered within the superfamily corixoidea .
this entailed at least four related issues , namely : 1 ) whether the karyotypes are conservative in respect to chromosome number and sex chromosome system , 2 ) whether m - chromosomes are present , 3 ) whether the post - reduction of sex chromosomes is present , and 4 ) whether the chiasmata are formed in male meiosis .
both corixidae and micronectidae are known to be characterised by an xy sex chromosome system and an inverted sequence of x and y chromosome divisions in spermatocyte meiosis , i.e. the sex chromosome post - reduction ( for references see ueshima 1979 , ituarte and papeschi 2004 , waller and angus 2005 , bressa and papeschi 2007 , grozeva et al. 2008 ) .
post - reduction means that the sex chromosomes behave as univalents during the first round of meiosis and undergo equational separation at ai whereas they form a pseudo - bivalent at mii and undergo reductional segregation at anaphase ii. the species here studied , cymatia rogenhoferi and cymatia coleoptrata , were found to share the same characteristics with corixidae and micronectidae , i.e. an xy system and the sex chromosome post - reduction in male meiosis .
multiple x1x2y mechanism found in cymatia rogenhoferi might have originated by fragmentation of the initial x chromosome .
the inverted sequence of sex chromosome divisions in spermatocyte meiosis is characteristic of the heteroptera as a whole ( ueshima 1979 ) , with rare exceptions ( e.g. golub et al. 2015 ) .
other cytogenetic features , including chromosome numbers and presence or absence of m - chromosomes , whose origin , nature and significance are questionable ( e.g. nokkala 1986 , kuznetsova et al .
2011 ) , and presence or absence of chiasmata in male meiosis , are distributed variously among different taxa of corixidae and micronectidae .
in corixinae , each of 30 species studied display ten pairs of autosomes , a pair of very small m - chromosomes , and x and y chromosomes : the karyotype formula of these species can be expressed as 2n = 24 ( 20a + 2m + x + y ) .
meiosis is of a standard chiasmate type in males ( ueshima 1979 , waller and angus 2005 , bressa and papeschi 2007 ) .
compared to corixinae , the family micronectidae is less well studied .
the karyotypes are currently known in micronecta ( dichaetonecta ) scholtzi ( fieber , 1860 ) , micronecta ( micronecta ) poweri ( douglas & scott , 1869 ) , and micronecta ( micronecta ) griseola horvath , 1899 , each with 2n = 24 ( 22a + xy ) ( grozeva et al .
2008 ) , and in tenagobia ( fuscagobia ) fuscata ( stal , 1859 ) , with 2n = 30 ( 28 + xy ) ( ituarte and papeschi 2004 ) .
based on the data available , micronectidae differ from corixinae in that they have alternative numbers of autosomes and no m - chromosomes .
furthermore , the species studied in micronectidae show the achiasmate meiosis in males .
cymatia rogenhoferi and cymatia coleoptrata studied in this paper , were found to have 2n = 33 ( 28a + 2m + x1x2y ) and 2n = 24 ( 20a + 2m + xy ) respectively and achiasmate meiosis of an alignment type in males .
in another cymatia species , cymatia bonsdorffi ( sahlberg , 1819 ) , studied by slack ( 1938 ) and later by southwood and leston ( 1959 ) , the karyotype of 2n = 26 ( 24 + xy ) was reported .
unfortunately , the authors provided no information on the special features of meiosis , including sex chromosomes' behaviour .
thus , on the basis of the current state of knowledge , the cymatiainae share a presence of m - chromosomes with corixinae , while the absence of chiasmata is shared with micronectidae .
due to their very small size and negative heteropycnosis during meiosis , m - chromosomes are easily overlooked by researchers , and subsequently information about the distribution of these puzzling structures in different true bug taxa can hardly be used for inferences .
the first ( reductional in the majority of organisms ) division involves several meiosis - specific events the most important being the formation of chiasmata , the points of genetic crossing - over , between homologous chromosomes .
when meiosis is achiasmate and chiasmata are not formed , no diplotene or diakinesis stages can be recognised .
the existence of achiasmate meiosis in phylogenetically unrelated true bug families , i.e. micronectidae from the infraorder nepomorpha ( ituarte and papeschi 2004 , grozeva et al .
2008 ) , saldidae from the leptopodomorpha ( nokkala and nokkala 1983 ) , and in several families of the cimicomorpha ( nokkala and nokkala 1984 , nokkala and nokkala 1986a , b , nokkala and grozeva 2000 , grozeva and nokkala 2002 ) , argue for its repeated and independent origin in the evolution of heteroptera .
at the same time , the achiasmate meiosis in true bugs is probably of very ancient origins , since some divergence has occurred in its cytological characteristics during the evolution ( nokkala and grozeva 2000 , grozeva et al. 2008 ) .
consequently , true bugs evolved a diversity of achiasmate meiosis types that include a variety starting from an alignment type to a colochore type , including an intermediate type ( nokkala and nokkala 1983 , nokkala and nokkala 1984 , nokkala and nokkala 1986a , b , kuznetsova et al. 2007 ) .
comprehensive classification of different types of achiasmate meiosis can be found in kuznetsova et al .
( 2011 ) .
the most common type is achiasmate meiosis of the alignment type characterised by the tight side - by - side alignment of homologous chromosomes throughout prophase until mi. meiosis of this type has been described in the saldidae , nabidae , anthocoridae , microphysidae , corixoidea : micronectidae ( for references see grozeva et al .
2008 ) , and now also in another corixid group , the cymatiainae ( present study ) .
the cymatiainae were erected for the first time as a separate taxon ( as cymatiini ) in corixidae on the basis of the shape and hairiness of the pala , the chitinisation of the pharynx , the length of maxillary stylets , and their position against pharynx ( walton in hutchinson 1940 ) .
later , the labium structure , the position of the labial sensilla , and absence of the strigil and stridulation mechanism , and the ability of sound production , as well as some other characters of the pala and embolium ( table 2 ) were added to the diagnosis ( jansson 1973 , 1986 , schuh and slater 1995 , nieser 2002b , chen et al. 2005 , hadicke 2012 , brozek 2013a , b , 2014 ) .

2004 , hadicke 2012 , brozek 2014 ) the position of cymatiainae varies from being considered a sister group of corixidae s. str .
( corixinae + heterocorixinae ) or a basal taxon ( together with diaprepocoridae ) in the whole superfamily corixoidea .
it has repeatedly been shown that the absence of chiasmata during spermatocyte meiosis is evolutionarily stable in true bugs , and marks taxa at the rank of family ( for references see grozeva et al. 2008 , kuznetsova et al. 2011 ) .
in this context , the finding of achasmate meiosis in micronectidae ( grozeva et al .
2008 ) clearly supports the familial status of this group , earlier proposed by nieser ( 2002a , b ) .
both achiasmate meiosis and a number of morphological diagnostic characters ( table 2 ) distinguish cymatiainae from the rest of corixidae .
however , more comprehensive studies on morphological and cytogenetic aspects of corixoidea as a whole are required to decide on the rank that should be assigned to cymatiainae .
the special focus must be on the genus cnethocymatia from the same subfamily , the genus diaprepocoris kirkaldy , 1897 considered the most basal taxon of corixoidea , and the genus stenocorixa horvath , 1926 showing morphological similarities with cymatiainae ( hebsgaard et al. 2004 , hadicke 2012 , brozek 2014 ) .

summary groundwater pollution is a serious worldwide concern .
aromatic compounds , chlorinated hydrocarbons , metals and nutrients among others can be widely found in different aquifers all over the world .
however , there is a lack of sustainable technologies able to treat these kinds of compounds .
microbial electro - remediation , by the means of microbial electrochemical technologies ( met ) , can become a promising alternative in the near future .
met can be applied for groundwater treatment in situ or ex situ , as well as for monitoring the chemical state or the microbiological activity .
this document reviews the current knowledge achieved on microbial electro - remediation of groundwater and its applications .

opportunities for microbial electrochemical technologies in groundwater treatment groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking water all over the world .
however , its usage as drinking water is threatened by the presence of different pollutants that have reached the aquifer due to anthropogenic or geologic sources ( katsoyiannis et al. , 2007 ; bohlke et al. , 2009 ; van halem et al. , 2009 ; sprague et al. , 2011 ) .
the pollutants can be accumulated in the aquifer by the lack of a suitable electron donor / acceptor .
but they need to be removed because of a further usage of drinking water or by means of environmental sustainability .
the most used strategies are based on pollutant separation ( membrane technologies or ion exchange ) or external addition of chemicals for abiotic or biologic catalysis [ e.g. organic matter for treating nitrates ( mcadam and judd , 2006 ) or oxygen / nitrate for treating hydrocarbons ( bamforth and singleton , 2005 )] .
however , these technologies present some drawbacks .
on the one hand , separation - based technologies have a high energy cost and they concentrate the pollutant into a waste brine of difficult disposal ( twomey et al. , 2010 ) .
on the other hand , the application of traditional remediating strategies that requires external chemical addition in situ or ex situ is limited by ( i ) undesired side reactions , ( ii ) poor chemical distribution ( in situ strategies ) and ( iii ) the addition of some chemicals can have collateral damages ( e.g. organic matter addition can generate sludge that needs to be removed ) .
therefore , new sustainable strategies can have a golden opportunity on groundwater bioremediation if they have ( i ) low cost ; ( ii ) no / low chemical consumption ; and ( iii ) non - invasive and selective electron donor / acceptor dosing .
these characteristics can be met in microbial electrochemical technologies ( met ) , which are an emerging technology platform where microbiology meets electrochemistry ( schroder et al. , 2015 ) .
in this technological approach , electroactive bacteria are able to use a solid electrode as electron donor or electron acceptor ( rabaey et al. , 2009 ) .
the electrode is the alternative to oxygen / nitrate as electron acceptor ( bamforth and singleton , 2005 ; oremland and stolz , 2005 ) , or organic matter / hydrogen as electron donor ( mcadam and judd , 2006 ; karanasios et al. , 2010 ) .
depending on the pollutant and groundwater 's characteristics , a met system can be operated as a microbial fuel cell ( mfc ) or as a microbial electrolysis cell ( mec ) ( schroder et al. , 2015 ) .
mfc is an autonomous device from where energy can be extracted , while a mec is a device where energy is supplied to allow / enhance a bioelectrochemical process .
different commercial opportunities can be found for microbial electro - remediation of contaminated groundwater ( fig. 1 ) .
the most studied application is the ex situ treatment. through this strategy , groundwater has to be pumped to the treatment plant ( either a permanent / off - site or a movable / on - site plant ) , where an intensive treatment is applied for a fast contaminant removal .
the faster the treatment is , the smaller the plant volume is needed ( with the corresponding decrease in the capital cost ) .
the treated water can be either used for human purposes ( i.e. drinking water ) or re - injected into the aquifer ( i.e. to avoid salinity intrusion or to control the phreatic level ) .
however , these ex situ strategies might not be recommended for some applications .
in some scenarios , an in situ met that allows the treatment and immobilization of the contaminant in the subsurface might be more suitable .
for example , in aquifers with geochemical u ( vi ) solubilization ( williams et al. , 2013 ) , its in situ conversion into an insoluble form u ( iv ) and consequent immobilization in the subsoil might be preferred .
for an in situ met implementation , a less intensive treatment can be applied .
electrodes can be directly introduced in the aquifer to stimulate the native microorganisms and , in consequence , to accelerate the aquifer bioremediation ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) .
an approach can be followed similar to already available technologies like electrokinetic remediation ( acar et al. , 1995 ) or vitrification ( mulligan et al. , 2001 ) .
figure 1 framework of opportunities for microbial electrochemical technologies in groundwater .
last but not least , small met systems can also be used as biosensors to monitor the microbial activity in the aquifer ( williams et al. , 2010 ; wardman et al. , 2014 ) or to evaluate its chemical state ( feng et al. , 2013 ; webster et al. , 2014 ; velasquez - orta et al. , 2017 ) .
considering these different met configurations , the treatment of different groundwater pollutants has been investigated using a solid electrode either as electron sink [ e.g. for oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons ( zhang et al. , 2010 ; friman et al. , 2013 ) or dissolved metals ( pous et al. , 2015a )] or as electron donor ( e.g. for reduction of nitrates ( pous et al. , 2013 ; zhang and angelidaki , 2013 ) , metals ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) or chlorinated hydrocarbons ( aulenta et al. , 2007 ) .
this review explores the met platform for groundwater bioremediation .
organic contaminants aromatic compounds the presence of aromatic compounds in groundwater is mainly attributed to anthropogenic contamination , mostly derived from petrochemical activities ( turney and goerlitz , 1990 ; teuten et al. , 2009 ). with a lack of electron acceptors , these substances can remain in the environment for a long time .
although the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons is usually found at low concentrations [ mug.l - 1 level ( rakoczy et al. , 2013 )] , they are already toxic at these levels .
for example , the guideline value for nitrobenzene in drinking water is 17 mug l - 1 in the united states ( environmental protection agency ( epa ) , 2004 ) .
therefore , a highly specific and effective treatment for this kind of compounds is needed , which can be difficult to achieve by conventional biologic treatments .
the versatility of met in terms of operational mode [ microbial fuel cell ( mfc ) , microbial electrolysis cell with 2 - or 3 - electrode configuration ( 2 - mec , 3 - mec )] , working electrode potential or active microbiome allows a plethora of aromatic contaminants to be treated ( table 1 and fig. 2 ) .
both mfc and mec have proved to be an effective strategy to catalyse either polycyclic [ e.g. phenantrene or naphthalene ( zhang et al. , 2010 ; yan and reible , 2015 )] or monocyclic aromatic compounds [ e.g. benzene , phenol or nitrobenzene ( mu et al. , 2009 ; zhang et al. , 2010 ; friman et al. , 2013 ; rakoczy et al. , 2013 )] .
although electricity can be harvested from an mfc , it requires of stable and reliable counterelectrode reaction , which implies extramaintenance and surveillance .
thus , mec operation might be preferred for bioremediation , as it allows focusing on aromatic compounds removal .
moreover , if an electrode control strategy is chosen ( 3 - mec ) , a better control of the reaction and the remediation rates could be reached .

john wiley & sons , ltd figure 2 summary of electrochemical reactions for the different pollutants treated in groundwater .
like in other met applications , this field of research became wider after it was found that geobacter was able to oxidize aromatic compounds using an electrode as electron acceptor ( zhang et al. , 2010 ) .
the ability of geobacter sp. on dealing with aromatics can accelerate met application in this field , as it is a well - known and well - studied model electroactive genus ( lovley et al. , 2011 ) .
in fact , geobacter species had already been detected in aquifers contaminated with aromatic compounds ( rooney - varga et al. , 1999 ) , thus suggesting their capacity to anaerobically oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons .
some years later , anaerobic benzene oxidation by geobacter was successfully proven ( zhang et al. , 2012 ). and even the genes for anaerobic benzene oxidation were identified for geobacter metallireducens ( zhang et al. , 2014 ) .
thus , it was not surprising that one of the first met experiences on aromatics removal evaluated the ability of geobacter metallireducens to oxidize toluene , benzene or naphthalene to carbon dioxide using a graphite electrode as electron sink ( zhang et al. , 2010 ) .
nevertheless , oxidation of anaerobic aromatic hydrocarbons using met is not an easy task .
only one pure microorganism not belonging to geobacter genus has been reported to be able to oxidize phenol using an electrode as electron acceptor , cupriavidis basilensis ( friman et al. , 2013 ) .
the study of pure cultures is important for their understanding , but for real groundwater bioremediation applications , the usage of pure cultures might not be feasible .
then , the usage of mixed cultures gains interest .
one of the most successful examples is the treatment of benzene .
benzene remediation has been successfully applied for either ex situ ( rakoczy et al. , 2013 ; wei et al. , 2015a,2015b ) or in situ experiences using mixed communities ( chang et al. , 2016 ) .
an interesting finding was described by rakoczy et al .
( 2013 ) .
the authors proved the simultaneous oxidation of sulfide and benzene in an anode mostly dominated by delta - proteobacteria ( 31 %) .
isotopic analyses revealed that small amounts of oxygen might be required to activate the benzene oxidation in their system ( rakoczy et al. , 2013 ) .
thus , in real practical applications for aromatic hydrocarbon treatment , a positive coexistence of different microbial metabolisms is expected to happen .
the complexity of aromatics can increase with the presence of n - or s - functional groups , leading to the need for developing different strategies for their treatment .
one example of functionalized aromatics treatment in met is nitrobenzene degradation .
in the ideal case , nitrobenzene would be converted into co2 and nh4 - . however , nitrobenzene complexity makes this task hard , and its solely reduction into aniline can be already seen as a success ( mu et al. , 2009 ; wang et al. , 2011 ; yun et al. , 2017 ) .
in fact , nitrobenzene reduction to aniline already reduces the water toxicity .
following a similar strategy , toxicity reduction instead of full oxidation , mets have been used for azo dye orange 7 reduction into sulfanilic acid ( yun et al. , 2017 ) and the toxicity of waters containing dibenzothiophene or atrazine has also been decreased ( rodrigo et al. , 2014 ; dominguez - garay et al. , 2016 ) .
atrazine is an interesting example , as it has been successfully mineralized ( dominguez - garay et al. , 2017 ) .
this example shows the potential of mets over the treatment of complex aromatic compounds .
in conclusion , a big window of opportunities can be opened for microbial electro - remediation of aromatic hydrocarbons , as mets are capable to treat not only homoaromatic hydrocarbons , but also those containing n - or s - functional groups or heteroaromatic hydrocarbons .
nevertheless , there are still relevant challenges to be addressed .
as a general overview of microbial electro - remediation , there is a lack of experiences at pilot - scale level , which is also occurring in the field of aromatic compounds removal .
in this case , as aromatics contamination is mostly derived from petrochemical activities ( turney and goerlitz , 1990 ; teuten et al. , 2009 ) , the most appropriate strategy would be in situ bioremediation , but field testing is still scarce ( daghio et al. , 2017 ) .
this lack of experience is relevant for aromatics bioremediation , as more hurdles are expected to be found when moving to the field .
for example , in a real petrochemical spill , there are several polyaromatic hydrocarbons species , some of which might not be bioavailable for bacteria due to its high hydrophobicity , and some others might also be toxic ( bamforth and singleton , 2005 ) .
nevertheless , laboratory testing is still needed to find the catalytic routes .
toluene , benzene or naphthalene has been already successfully converted into carbon dioxide ( zhang et al. , 2010 ) , but when treating more complex compounds such as nitrobenzene , azo dye or dibenzothiophene , the conversion to carbon dioxide could not be reached .
chlorinated hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons can be found in groundwater at ppb level due to solvent spills that have leaked into the aquifer ( squillace et al. , 2002 ; moran et al. , 2007 ) .
chlorinated hydrocarbons have been conventionally removed from groundwater by means of separation technologies ( i.e. ion exchange , reverse osmosis or nanofiltration ) ( altalyan et al. , 2016 ) or through permeable reactive barriers ( obiri - nyarko et al. , 2014 ) .
but there is a biologic alternative to deal with these compounds : reductive dechlorination ( holliger and schraa , 1994 ; holliger et al. , 1998 ) .
in the ideal scenario , it allows turning the chlorinated hydrocarbons into ethene and chloride .
following this approach , the removal of chlorinated compounds using met platform has been widely investigated by operating the system as a mec ( aulenta et al. , 2008 ; strycharz et al. , 2008 ) .
bioelectrochemical dechlorination of some aromatic hydrocarbons , like chlorophenol ( strycharz et al. , 2010 ; wen et al. , 2013 ) , has also been reported .
however , most of the studies have been focused on the removal of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons ( cahs ) , the occurrence of which is high in groundwater .
tetrachloroethene / perchloroethene ( pce ) reduction using a polarized cathode as electron donor has been demonstrated by either mixed cultures ( yu et al. , 2016 ) or a pure culture ( geobacter lovleyi ) ( strycharz et al. , 2008 ) .
the main objective is to reduce pce into ethene ( chambon et al. , 2013 ) .
however , pce is reduced through a sequence of reactions where trichloroethene ( tce ) , cis - dichloroethene ( cis - dce ) and vinyl chloride ( vc ) are stable intermediates that can be accumulated ( chambon et al. , 2013 ) .
when using geobacter lovleyi at a poised cathode potential of - 300 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode ( she ) , pce was reduced at a maximum rate of around 25 mumol day - 1 , which was similar to the values observed when using acetate as electron donor ( strycharz et al. , 2008 ) .
however , pce was only converted into cis - dce , which is still a toxic compound and needs further degradation .
positively , when using a mixed culture at - 500 mv versus she , pce could be finally degraded into ethene in batch mode ( yu et al. , 2016 ) .
however , a minimum of 50 % of initial pce was accumulated as vinyl chloride , indicating that further process optimization is needed .
the most studied chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon using met is trichloroethene ( tce ) ( aulenta et al. , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 ; verdini et al. , 2015 ; lai et al. , 2017 ). from the initial proof - of - concept ( aulenta et al. , 2007 ) , research has evolved towards the understanding of the whole process [ electron transfer mechanism ( aulenta et al. , 2007 , 2010 ) , cis - dce role as intermediate ( aulenta et al. , 2010 , 2013 ; lai et al. , 2015 ) or electron competitors such as methane generation ( aulenta et al. , 2008 , 2011 ) and nitrate / sulfate presence ( lai et al. , 2015 )] .
process optimization through cathode potential , mass transport or continuous - flow operation has also been evaluated ( aulenta et al. , 2011 ; verdini et al. , 2015 ; lai et al. , 2017 ) , and it has allowed to increase the bioelectrochemical dechlorination rates from 14.2 - 22.4 mueq l - 1 day - 1 ( aulenta et al. , 2010 ) to 121.8 mueq l - 1 day - 1 ( lai et al. , 2017 ) in the last years .
these rates are similar to values obtained in conventional reductive dechlorination ( shukla et al. , 2014 ) , which highlights the competitiveness of bioelectrochemical reductive dechlorination .
however , despite ethene is the desired product of reductive dechlorination , vc has been commonly observed as the main final product ( aulenta et al. , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 ) .
in order to solve this issue , an interesting approach where tce is reduced to vc in the biocathode and vc is further aerobically oxidized to carbon dioxide in the anode has been successfully implemented and demonstrated ( lai et al. , 2017 ) .
the list of chlorinated aliphatic compounds treated in met can be further extended to the successful treatment of 1,2 - dichloroethane ( 1,2 - dca ) ( leitao et al. , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 ) .
initially , the 1,2 - dca conversion to ethene was evaluated at different cathode potentials from - 300 to - 900 mv versus she using a dehalococcoides - enriched microbial culture .
the authors observed 1,2 - dca conversion to ethene at - 300 mv versus she , a potential at which it was deduced that direct electron uptake was the mechanism driving this process ( leitao et al. , 2015 ) .
the work was further extended by investigating the effect of supplementing an external mediator [ anthraquinone - 2,6 - disulfonate ( aqds )] in a biocathode polarized at - 300 mv versus she ( leitao et al. , 2016 ). through aqds addition , the 1,2 - dca dechlorination rate increased from 20 mumol l - 1 day - 1 in the first work ( leitao et al. , 2015 ) to 65 mumol l - 1 day - 1 in the last one ( leitao et al. , 2016 ) .
aqds could even be immobilized on the electrode surface for an easier application ( leitao et al. , 2017 ) .
in conclusion , the experience on bioelectrochemical reductive dechlorination is already broad in met field .
in the recent years , a positive evolution took place that allowed increasing the removal rates up to values similar to conventional reductive dechlorination and a better understanding of the underlying fundamentals of bioelectrochemical dechlorination was obtained ( i.e. thermodynamics or the reductive pathway ) .
although important challenges still need to be addressed for becoming a market product , such as more studies at pilot - scale level or a higher specificity to ethene as final product , microbial electro - remediation is a promising approach for treating chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater .
inorganic contaminants metallic compounds metals can be present in groundwater mainly because of the aquifer 's geochemistry , but also due to leakages from industrial contamination .
mets have been used as a technological approach to deal with different metals such as hexavalent uranium ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) , hexavalent chromium ( huang et al. , 2010 ) , arsenite ( pous et al. , 2015a ) or selenite ( catal et al. , 2009 ) ( table 2 and fig. 2 ) .
in these cases , the objective is to change the metal oxidation state to one that presents lower toxicity and / or lower solubility .
different strategies can be explored depending on the metal that needs to be treated .
in geologic - associated contamination [ such as u ( vi ) , as ( iii ) , v ( v ) or se ( iv )] , in situ microbial electro - remediation might be the best strategy with the aim to immobilize the chemical species in their natural habitat .
while in anthropogenic contamination [ such as cr ( vi ) , cd ( ii ) or cu ( ii )] , the ex situ operation can be more appropriate to decontaminate the aquifer or , in the case of copper , to further recover it ( ter heijne et al. , 2010 ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd one of the most studied applications is the microbial electro - remediation of uranium - contaminated sites ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) .
in these sites , uranium is present in form of u ( vi ) and the most desirable strategy for its bioremediation is the in situ conversion of u ( vi ) to u ( iv ) , which is relatively insoluble and allows uranium immobilization in the aquifer ( gavrilescu et al. , 2009 ) .
one of the most common strategies to promote uranium immobilization is to spike acetate or ethanol into the aquifer to stimulate native microbial u ( vi ) reduction ( gavrilescu et al. , 2009 ) .
the interesting finding for met applications was that geobacter genus had been abundantly detected and enriched in sites where uranium bioremediation was implemented ( anderson et al. , 2003 ; shelobolina et al. , 2008 ; holmes et al. , 2015 ) .
bioremediation of u ( vi ) using met instead of dosing acetate could decrease the ecological impact of the treatment as well as their cost , as it would only require the implementation of electrodes to stimulate bacterial activity .
for this reason , the bioelectrochemical reduction of u ( vi ) using geobacter has been proved in controlled laboratory experiments , as well as in real contaminated aquifers ( in situ experiences ) ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) .
the results obtained were promising , as 87 % of uranium was recovered on the electrode surface ( gregory and lovley , 2005 ) .
moreover , bioelectrochemical u ( vi ) reduction represented a breaking point for the met field .
until that moment , met research had been focused on developing systems that relied on microbes able to deliver electrons to an electrode ( microbial bioanodes ) .
but the finding that the well - known geobacter was also able to get electrons from an electrode to perform bioelectrochemical reduction of u ( vi ) , fumarate or nitrate opened a new field of research : microbial biocathodes ( gregory et al. , 2004 ; gregory and lovley , 2005 ) .
although the understanding of microbial electron transfer fundamentals in bioanodes is abundant , the knowledge for biocathodes is still scarce ( rosenbaum et al. , 2011 ) .
for this reason , investigations over how geobacter is able to get electrons from an electrode can be seen as a lighthouse for biocathodes in general .
for example , the finding that geobacter sulfurreducens requires outer - surface c - type cytochromes , but not conductive pili ( microbial nanowires ) , for the reduction of u ( vi ) is a relevant contribution to the understanding of microbial reduction of soluble extracellular electron acceptors ( orellana et al. , 2013 ) .
moreover , the geobacter versatility can also be used to hypothesize future pollutants to be evaluated using met - based bioremediation .
for example , as geobacter is also able to reduce the soluble v ( v ) to the more insoluble v ( iv ) , met could also become an alternative process for bioremediating vanadium - contaminated sites ( ortiz - bernad et al. , 2004 ) .
however , until now , only one experience of biocathodic v ( v ) reduction has been reported so far , getting a removal efficiency of 76.8 % ( zhang et al. , 2015 ) .
met is also contributing on the bioremediation of one of the most harmful and abundant metallic contaminants , arsenic , which is found in groundwater as arsenite [ as ( iii )] .
its chemistry is different from the two metals discussed above , uranium and vanadium , where the highest oxidation state ( u ( vi ) and v ( v ) , respectively ) , were mobile , and thus , a reduction was needed for immobilization .
in the case of arsenic , as ( iii ) is highly mobile , while as ( v ) ( arsenate ) is more insoluble .
thus , the purpose is to use a bioanode able to oxidize arsenite to arsenate using a solid electrode as electron acceptor .
the first study on arsenite oxidation using met did not rely on arsenite - oxidizing microorganisms .
it was focused on coupling a mfc with zero valent iron to produce h2o2 , which was further used to oxidize as ( iii ) to as ( v ) ( xue et al. , 2013 ) .
in 2014 , webster et al .
( 2014 ) engineered shewanella oneidensis to develop an arsenite - specific biosensor ( webster et al. , 2014 ) .
one year later , the biologic arsenite oxidation using an electrode as electron acceptor was evaluated and proved ( pous et al. , 2015a ) .
a biofilm predominantly covered by gamma - and delta - proteobacteria was able to perform the as ( iii ) conversion at a poised anode potential of + 497 mv versus she. from there on , the arsenite bioanode oxidation has been further investigated .
the as ( iii ) oxidation performance has been improved , and a maximum as ( iii ) oxidation rate of 29.6 mgas l - 1 day - 1 has been achieved ( nguyen et al. , 2016d ) .
moreover , it has been obtained additional knowledge about the microbial ecology responsible of microbial as ( iii ) electro - remediation , and arsenite oxidation has been successfully coupled to cathodic nitrate reduction ( nguyen et al. , 2016d , 2017 ) .
microorganisms able to catalyse arsenic oxidation are usually considered together with selenium players ( stolz et al. , 2006 ) .
however , a different approach for dealing with se , which is commonly found as selenite [ se ( iv )] , has been tested in mets .
in this case , selenite was successfully reduced to elemental selenium in microbial biocathodes , which allowed its immobilization ( catal et al. , 2009 ; nguyen et al. , 2016c ) .
moreover , the finding that the well - known electroactive shewanella oneidensis mr - 1 has the ability to convert se ( iv ) into se ( 0 ) opens the door for more investigations on selenium - contaminated groundwater treatment ( li et al. , 2014 ) .
shewanella sp. has also been associated to chromium electro - remediation ( hsu et al. , 2012 ; xafenias et al. , 2013 , 2015 ) .
chromium is commonly used in different industries , and it can finally be released in their effluent streams as cr ( vi ) .
as a result , it can be found in some groundwater bodies .
in microbial biocathodes , cr ( vi ) can be converted into cr ( iii ) using either a mfc ( huang et al. , 2010 ; hsu et al. , 2012 ; xafenias et al. , 2013 , 2015 ; wu et al. , 2015 ; song et al. , 2016 ) or a mec configuration ( xafenias et al. , 2013 ; huang et al. , 2015 ) .
the basis of the process is to convert the soluble cr ( vi ) into a less soluble form , cr ( iii ) .
however , chromium can precipitate on the shewanella surface ( kim et al. , 2014 ) , which could be seen as a limiting factor at long - term operation .
nevertheless , the ability of met to convert and anchor cr ( vi ) can allow effluent concentrations below 5 ppb , which is below the guideline values for drinking water ( hsu et al. , 2012 ) .
in conclusion , microbial electro - remediation is a versatile technology that allows the treatment of different metal contaminants , and it can be applied in situ or ex situ depending on the contaminant .
non - metallic inorganic contaminants - nutrients the presence of inorganic non - metallic contaminants can be found in different groundwater bodies .
met has been proposed as an alternative method for nitrates ( pous et al. , 2013 ; zhang and angelidaki , 2013 ) , ammonium ( wei et al. , 2015a ) , sulfates ( coma et al. , 2013 ; pozo et al. , 2016 ) and perchlorates ( butler et al. , 2010 ) ( table 2 and fig. 2 ) .
nitrate ( mencio et al. , 2011 ; sprague et al. , 2011 ) , ammonium ( mastrocicco et al. , 2013 ; scheiber et al. , 2016 ) and perchlorate ( bohlke et al. , 2009 ; izbicki et al. , 2015 ) are mainly found in groundwater due to anthropogenic activities .
in contrast , sulfates can also be accumulated because of aquifer 's geology ( burg et al. , 2017 ) and seawater intrusion ( bottrell et al. , 2008 ) , but it poses a lower risk for human health ( liamleam and annachhatre , 2007 ) .
nitrates are one of the most widespread contaminants threatening groundwater 's usage as drinking water .
it can be found in several regions around the world as the bad face of intensive agriculture and livestock production ( mencio et al. , 2011 ; sprague et al. , 2011 ) .
separation - based technologies , such as reverse osmosis , reverse electrodialysis and ion exchange have been used to deal with nitrates in groundwater .
these technologies are effective on removing nitrate , but they are energy - intensive and they produce waste brine concentrated with nitrates of difficult disposal ( twomey et al. , 2010 ) .
for this reason , technologies based on converting nitrates ( to dinitrogen gas preferably ) are being investigated .
they can be divided into two main groups : abiotic and biologic .
the abiotic alternatives are mainly based on electrocatalysis or the usage of a chemical catalyser , such as zero valent iron ( zvi ) ( duca and koper , 2012 ; fu et al. , 2014 ) .
besides they could become effective strategies for removing nitrate , their main challenge is the low reduction specificity to dinitrogen gas ( n2 ) as end - product .
nitrate is converted into ammonium in most of the cases , which requires a post - treatment ( duca and koper , 2012 ; fu et al. , 2014 ) .
on the contrary , biologic treatments rely on bacteria , which are considered to be low - cost and self - renewable catalysers .
bacteria are able to convert nitrate into dinitrogen gas through the denitrification process .
biologic nitrate removal in mets has been widely studied because of its possible application to wastewater treatment ( clauwaert et al. , 2007 ; virdis et al. , 2010 ; puig et al. , 2011 ; pous et al. , 2015b ; vilajeliu - pons et al. , 2015 ) .
although bioelectrochemical dissimilatory nitrate reduction ( i.e. nitrate conversion to ammonium ) has been described ( sander et al. , 2015 ) , nitrate removal in mets naturally follows the conventional denitrifying pathway in most of the cases ( clauwaert et al. , 2007 ; virdis et al. , 2008 ) .
nitrates are reduced to dinitrogen gas in the cathode compartment .
however , literature regarding the treatment of nitrate - polluted groundwater using met is not abundant .
the difference between treating nitrate in wastewater or groundwater using met is relevant , as it has been demonstrated that the low conductivity of groundwater (<= 1 ms cm - 1 ) limits the met performance ( puig et al. , 2012 ) .
thus , groundwater treatment is expected to have higher restrictions compared to wastewaters with higher conductivities and buffer capacities .
in the first studies regarding microbial electro - remediation of nitrate , the mechanism was based on electrochemical water splitting to provide hydrogen to hydrogenotrophic denitrifiers ( sakakibara and kuroda , 1993 ; prosnansky et al. , 2002 ) .
this process was considered an alternative to conventional hydrogenotrophic denitrification ( karanasios et al. , 2010 ) , in which hydrogen gas is directly supplied to a biological reactor .
but this process is mass transfer limited due to the low solubility of hydrogen [ 1.6 mg l - 1 at 20 degreesc ( soares , 2000 )] .
sakakibara and kuroda ( 1993 ) demonstrated that the complete reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas could be accomplished by applying different currents from 0 to 40 ma , which lead to increase the denitrification rate up to 0.15 mmol h - 1 .
although the authors stated that denitrification was mediated by h2 ( produced in situ by electrochemical water splitting ) , it cannot be excluded that denitrification using the electrode as electron donor was taking place simultaneously .
besides the fact that the in situ electrochemical production of hydrogen for nitrate reduction was effective [ nitrate removal rates up to 394 mgn l - 1 day - 1 ( prosnansky et al. , 2002 )] , it implied a certain lack of process control .
the hydrogen generated in the cathode may or may not be used for nitrate reduction .
hence , lower columbic efficiency can be expected for this type of configuration .
in 2004 , gregory and co - workers observed that autotrophic denitrifiers were able to use a poised cathode electrode ( - 500 mv versus ag / agcl , - 303 mv versus she ) as electron donor , getting an electrode predominantly covered by geobacter sp .
( gregory et al. , 2004 ) .
electron uptake from an electrode to perform denitrification was also demonstrated in groundwater ( park et al. , 2005 ) .
in this case , by applying 200 ma , a nitrate removal rate of 435 mgn l - 1 h - 1 ( 10440 mgn l - 1 day - 1 ) was achieved in batch mode ( park et al. , 2005 ) .
in groundwater , the electrode was predominantly covered by alpha - , beta - , gamma - proteobacteria and flavobacteriia , which indicated that not only geobacter sp .
( gregory et al. , 2004 ) were capable to perform bioelectrochemical denitrification. from there on , the investigation of nitrate removal in groundwater has been focused on determining the best operational strategies to increase nitrate removal rates .
if a mfc strategy is chosen to treat nitrate - polluted groundwater , organic matter needs to be dosed into the anode compartment .
despite organic matter is not directly added to groundwater ( it is added in a different compartment ) , it implies an extra cost .
hence , to convince future stakeholders that a bes operated as a mfc is suitable for groundwater bioremediation ( pous et al. , 2013 ; zhang and angelidaki , 2013 ) , the denitrification rates should be objectively higher than those obtained in conventional heterotrophic denitrification systems. by now , the highest denitrification rate reported in a denitrifying mfc has been around 500 mgn l - 1 day - 1 treating either groundwater ( zhang and angelidaki , 2013 ) or synthetic wastewater ( clauwaert et al. , 2009 ) .
a conventional heterotrophic treatment of nitrate - polluted groundwater as membrane bioreactors ( mbr ) can reach values up to 1700 mgn l - 1 day - 1 ( wasik et al. , 2001 ) .
met can be a market alternative for treating nitrate - contaminated groundwater if it moves towards the idea of developing a fully autotrophic treatment .
in this sense , a mec operation is preferred , where external energy can be used to directly empower the denitrifying activity ( sakakibara and kuroda , 1993 ) .
the fully autotrophic nitrate removal in groundwater has been evaluated in both mec 2 - electrode ( sakakibara and kuroda , 1993 ; feleke et al. , 1998 ; park et al. , 2005 , 2006 ; huang et al. , 2013 ; kondaveeti and min , 2013 ; kondaveeti et al. , 2014 ; nguyen et al. , 2015 ) or 3 - electrode arrangement ( pous et al. , 2015c ; nguyen et al. , 2016a,2016b ) .
except for the case of park et al .
( 2005 ) , who reported 435 mgn l - 1 h - 1 in a 2 - mec , and pous et al .
( 2017 ) , who reported 849 mgn l - 1 day - 1 in a 3 - mec , the other authors obtained nitrate removal rates below 200 mgn l - 1 day - 1 .
a lower capital cost is required for a mec 2 - electrodes , as it only needs a conventional power supply ( e.g. power supply 0 - 30 v , 0 - 3 a has a cost of around 150 euro ) .
but mec 2 - electrodes have a risk of side reactions ( i.e. hydrogen evolution ) .
on the contrary , the capital cost is higher for a mec 3 - electrodes because a potentiostat is needed ( e.g. potentiostat 0 - 20 v , 0 - 1 a has a cost of around 5000 euro ) .
however , in mec 3 - electrodes , the cathode potential is controlled , which gives a better control over the electrode reactions .
thus , with both presenting advantages and disadvantages , the decision of choosing one or another will depend on each real application case .
in order to deliver drinking water , the plethora of configurations to deal with nitrate in groundwater is usually thought as ex situ applications ( intensive treatment ) .
however , experiences on in situ microbial electro - remediation have also been explored , giving promising results ( tong and he , 2013 ; zhang and angelidaki , 2013 ; nguyen et al. , 2016b ) .
another less common , but sometimes present , nitrogen compound is ammonium .
it is a contaminant that can be found in subsurface waters that have received industrial or petrochemical pollution ( voyevoda et al. , 2012 ) .
in those spills where oxygen is at low concentrations , ammonium is not oxidized into nitrate at the surface neither during the percolation ( buss et al. , 2004 ) .
the main strategy to treat ammonium using mets is based on oxidizing ammonium aerobically into nitrate , which is then reduced into dinitrogen gas in a denitrifying biocathode ( virdis et al. , 2008 , 2010 ; vilajeliu - pons et al. , 2015 , 2017 ) .
this strategy has been used to treat ammonium from real contaminated groundwater with satisfactory results in terms of ammonium oxidation , but low efficiencies of nitrate removal ( wei et al. , 2015a,2015b ) .
wei et al. , 2015a observed a 100 % ammonium oxidation ( 20 mgn l - 1 ) but an insufficient nitrate removal in a 0.16 - l reactor .
while wei et al. , 2015b reached an stable ammonium removal of 100 % during an operation time of 200 days in a met presenting a 26 l volume and operated at 15 days hrt , but again an insufficient nitrate removal was observed .
another strategy that is being developed for treating ammonium is the ammonium oxidation using the anode as the final electron acceptor ( zhan et al. , 2012 , 2014 ; zhu et al. , 2016 ) , but still low ammonium oxidation rates have been obtained [ around 60 mgn l - 1 day - 1 ( zhan et al. , 2014 )] .
perchlorate is an emerging pollutant in groundwater , which consumption can cause a depression of thyroid hormone formation ( greer et al. , 2002 ) .
the biologic treatment of perchlorate is performed by perchlorate - reducing bacteria , which are able to convert clo4 - into cl - . besides no literature is available on perchlorate treatment in real groundwater , electro - remediation of perchlorate in organic matter - free media has been already proved ( butler et al. , 2010 ) .
like other biocathode - based processes , the investigation of clo4 - reduction has been evaluated in mfc and mec modes .
butler et al .
( 2010 ) were able to obtain electrical current by perchlorate cathodic reduction at a maximum rate of 24 mg l - 1 day - 1 ( butler et al. , 2010 ) .
under mec mode , the perchlorate reduction was also possible at poised cathode potential of - 500 mv versus ag / agcl ( - 303 mv versus she ) ( 3 - electrodes ) ( thrash et al. , 2007 ) or by supplying a fixed current ( 2 - mec ) ( wang et al. , 2014 ) .
however , the way to enrich this kind of reactors is one of the critical steps for met application .
for this reason , different inoculation strategies have been tested , such as the enrichment perchlorate - reducing bacteria fed with acetate ( mieseler et al. , 2013 ) or the adaptation of a denitrifying met to perform perchlorate reduction ( shea et al. , 2008 ) .
both of them showed promising results , which should encourage further research on perchlorate bioremediation using mets .
sulfates occurrence in groundwater also presents interest for microbial electro - remediation , despite its low risk for human health .
some subsurface waters can present sulfate concentrations above the guideline value , and it also represents a risk for the utility infrastructure because of its possible conversion into hydrogen sulfide , even at low concentrations .
because of its low reduction potential [ e0 ( so42 - / hs - ) = 0.252 v versus she , e0 ( so42 - / s0 ) = 0.357 v versus she ( rabaey et al. , 2009 )] compared to organic matter oxidation [ e0 ( ch3coo - / hco3 - ) = 0.187 v versus she ( logan et al. , 2006 )] , the reduction of so42 - in the cathode of a mfc is not feasible ( coma et al. , 2013 ) .
hence , it is necessary to apply external power to reach relevant removal rates .
for example , coma et al .
( 2013 ) observed a sulfate removal rate of 2 gso42 - m - 3 day - 1 when operating as mfc ( 0 v applied ) , but a removal of around 65 gso42 - m - 3 day - 1 when operating as mec and applying 0.7 v. not only the achievement of sulfate removal rates is important , but it is also important to determine which reduction product has been produced .
in order to remove the sulfates from water using met , two strategies have been evaluated : ( i ) sulfate conversion to sulfide , which could be extracted by promoting its precipitation as metal sulfide ( su et al. , 2012 ; coma et al. , 2013 ; pozo et al. , 2016 ) ; ( ii ) sulfate conversion into elemental sulfur , which would allow s recovery for further usage if a cheap strategy for extraction is developed ( blazquez et al. , 2016 ; chatterjee et al. , 2017 ) .
nevertheless , the highest importance of studying sulfates bioelectrocatalysis for groundwater application is its coexistences together with other contaminants that posses higher risks for human health [ e.g. together with chlorinated hydrocarbons ( lai et al. , 2015 ) or with nitrates ( nguyen et al. , 2016a )] .
therefore , the importance of the understanding of microbial electro - remediation of inorganic non - metallic pollutants in groundwater relies not only on the capacity of met to treat these contaminants , but also on the possible interferences that these common contaminants can provoke to the electro - remediation of others .
hurdles and challenges for groundwater microbial electro - remediation the scarcity of nutrients is one of the main hurdles that microbial electro - remediation of groundwater has to face. from a chemical - specific sight , n'guessan et al .
( 2010 ) investigated the effect of phosphate limitation in geobacter sp. the authors demonstrated that g. sulfurreducens is able to reduce u ( vi ) at phosphate - limiting conditions ( 0.217 mm phosphate ) ( n'guessan et al. , 2010 ) .
thus , the electroactive microorganism g. sulfurreducens was not limited by low nutrient availability , which gives good perspectives for their survival when treating groundwater. from a general perspective , a clear indication of the low availability of chemical species itself is the low conductivity of groundwater (<= 1.6 ms cm - 1 ) .
the low conductivity can have a negative impact on met , it implies higher ohmic and transport losses ( logan et al. , 2006 ) .
for example , in the case of met - based nitrate removal , the decrease in conductivity from 4.3 to 1.3 ms cm - 1 implied a decrease of 44 % on nitrate removed ( from 13.5 to 7.5 mgn l - 1 ) ( puig et al. , 2012 ) .
moreover , the low conductivity can also lead to ph gradients by promoting to acidic phs in the anode and basification in cathode .
ph shifts can directly harm the electroactive bacteria and their removal performance ( clauwaert et al. , 2008 ; fornero et al. , 2010 ) , and it can lead to additional problems for the specific application of groundwater treatment .
depending on the aquifer 's geochemistry , groundwater can present a high concentration of calcium , magnesium and bicarbonate ( i.e. hardness ) ( briggs and ficke , 1977 ) .
the reductive nature of cathodes , together with the low buffering capacity of groundwater , can promote basified zones on the electrode surface .
this induces scaling with the consequent blockage of the cathode electrodes , which can end up in met deactivation ( santini et al. , 2016 ) .
besides it could be seen as a new application for met ( water softening ) ( gabrielli et al. , 2006 ; zeppenfeld , 2011 ) , strategies for solving this issue must be explored .
another challenge for met treatment of groundwater is the presence of mixtures of different contaminants ( squillace et al. , 2002 ) .
the study of electro - remediation of co - contaminants in met is limited , and few examples , such as perchlorate / nitrate ( xie et al. , 2014 ) or cis - dce / nitrate / sulfate ( lai et al. , 2015 ) , can be found .
the cocktail perchlorate / nitrate is of a high interest , as they both can occur simultaneously ( dasgupta et al. , 2005 ) .
on the one hand , anthropogenic perchlorate contamination has been linked to ammonium perchlorate ( a missile propellant ) ( hogue , 2003 ) and to nitrate - based fertilizers , which also contain perchlorate ( susarla et al. , 1999 ; urbansky et al. , 2000 ) .
it is relevant the case of the chilean nitrate , since its perchlorate content is about 0.05 - 0.2 wt % clo4 - ( urbansky et al. , 2001 ) .
on the other hand , perchlorate can be naturally produced by sea salt aerosol photolysis in the atmosphere .
this process can also involve nitrogen oxides , which can end up with nitrate deposition ( dasgupta et al. , 2005 ) .
xie et al .
( 2014 ) evaluated the occurrence of both nitrate and perchlorate in a met .
the experiments were performed in a perchlorate - reducing biocathode grown at a poised cathode potential of - 252 mv versus she ( - 500 mv versus sce ) .
after testing the perchlorate removal ( initial concentration of 0.70 mmclo4 - ) together with different nitrate concentrations ( 0 - 2.10 mmno3 - ) , the authors observed lower perchlorate reductions when higher nitrate concentrations were present .
in batch experiments , a perchlorate concentration of 0.70 mm was totally consumed in 4 days when spiked alone .
twelve days were needed for its removal when 0.07 mm of nitrate was added , and perchlorate reduction was totally suppressed when nitrate was added at 2.10 mm ( xie et al. , 2014 ) .
this inhibition of perchlorate reduction in the presence of nitrate is not specific of bioelectrochemical perchlorate reduction , and it has also been observed when using organic carbon or hydrogen as electron donors ( zhao et al. , 2011 ; ricardo et al. , 2012 ) .
the reduction potentials of nitrate and perchlorate are similar ( e0 no3 - / n2 = 1.25 v ; e0 clo4 - / cl - = 1.28 v ) , which make them electron competitors ( bardiya and bae , 2011 ) .
in fact , most of the perchlorate - reducing bacteria identified so far are also able to denitrify ( nozawa - inoue et al. , 2011 ) .
however , nitrate consumption allows higher cell growth .
in consequence , the perchlorate reduction starts only after nitrate is depressed in most of the cases described ( bardiya and bae , 2011 ) .
hence , the decrease in perchlorate reduction in the presence of nitrate is linked to a substrate preference over nitrate .
thus , the tendency of bacteria over denitrification should be taken into account when dealing with a perchlorate / nitrate cocktail , and strategies for allowing perchlorate reduction should be implemented .
on the removal of cis - dce , the presence of nitrate and sulfate can also be possible , as they are one of the most widespread contaminants .
for this reason , lai et al .
( 2015 ) investigated whether nitrate and sulfate presence could affect bioelectrochemical reductive dechlorination of cis - dce ( lai et al. , 2015 ) .
they observed that the cathode potential had a key role on selecting the target pollutant .
in the cathode potential range evaluated ( - 550 / - 750 mv versus she ) , nitrate reduction always took place .
as cathode potential was lowered , sulfate reduction and methanogenesis increased their activity .
besides reductive dechlorination was not inhibited , the electricity consumption incremented due to crossed reactions at lower cathode potentials .
in this case , reductive dechlorination contribution was < 1 % of the electrons consumed .
the effect of sulfate was also evaluated on bioelectrochemical nitrate reduction ( nguyen et al. , 2016a ) .
nguyen and co - workers compared the denitrifying activity with or without sulfate ( 50 mgs - so42 - l - 1 ) , and they observed that the presence of sulfate suppressed , somehow , the overall denitrifying activity .
not only the nitrate removal rate decreased but also nitrite was accumulated as undesired denitrification intermediate .
therefore , it would be welcomed a further understanding on chemical species that coexist with the target pollutant in groundwater .
outlook for the future of microbial electro - remediation of groundwater microbial electro - remediation represents a unique opportunity to develop a robust , resilient and sustainable technology in a circular economy context to deal with different contaminants that are already present in our groundwater bodies .
a considerable development has been done in the last 20 years in this field .
contaminants of different chemical nature ( e.g. polycyclic heteroaromatic hydrocarbons , nutrients or metals ) have been successfully treated using microbial electrochemical technologies .
the technology proved its flexibility , as it has been adapted for ex situ or in situ treatment applications depending on the target pollutant .
moreover , met - based knowledge can also be applied to develop biosensors for contaminant or microbial monitoring in groundwater .
however , in order to keep paving the way to its future implementation , specific development might be required for each specific pollutant , as their characteristics require different operational strategies .
strategies to overcome the restricting characteristics of groundwater and to face problems like carbonate scaling or those related to cocktails of contaminants need to be investigated and implemented .
moreover , testing at pilot plant level is still scarce , which demands an increase in scaling - up orientated research to avoid technological stagnation .
conflict of interest none declared .

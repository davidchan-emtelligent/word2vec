insects' fat bodies are responsible for nutrient storage and for a significant part of intermediary metabolism .
thus , it can be expected that the structure and content of the fat body will adaptively change , if an insect is going through different life stages .
bumblebee queens belong to such insects as they dramatically change their physiology several times over their lives in relation to their solitary overwintering , independent colony foundation stage , and during the colony life - cycle ending in the senescent stage .
here , we report on changes in the ultrastructure and lipid composition of the peripheral fat body of bombus terrestris queens in relation to seasonal changes in the queens' activity .
six life stages are defined and evaluated in particular : pharate , callow , before and after hibernation , egg - laying , and senescence .
transmission electron microscopy revealed that the fat body contained two main cell types - adipocytes and oenocytes .
only adipocytes reveal important changes related to the life phase , and mostly the ration between inclusion and cytoplasm volume varies among particular stages .
both electron microscopy and chemical analyses of lipids highlighted seasonal variability in the quantity of the stored lipids , which peaked prior to hibernation .
triacylglycerols appeared to be the main energy source during hibernation , while the amount of glycogen before and after hibernation remained unchanged .
in addition , we observed that the representation of some fatty acids within the triacylglycerols change during the queen 's life .
last but not least , we show that fat body cell membranes do not undergo substantial changes concerning phospholipid composition in relation to overwintering .
this finding supports the hypothesis that the cold - adaptation strategy of bumblebee queens is more likely to be based on polyol accumulation than on the restructuring of lipid membranes .

introduction bumblebees ( hymenoptera : apidae : bombini ) are pollinators of prime importance in moderate climates .
this feature has long been exploited by humans , and bumblebees are responsible for a significant increase in the quality and quantity of harvests both in greenhouses and in the field [ 1,2 ] .
a bumblebee colony is an annual phenomenon that is established by a sole queen in the spring and dies off during the autumn .
the queen has the longest life of all colony members , and this can be divided into several phases that differ considerably in terms of the queen 's activities , energy and environmental requirements , and utilization of fat body ( fb ) reserves [ 3 ] .
the queen spends the first days of her adult life in the natal nest and later ( july to august ) leaves it in order to copulate with usually a single unrelated male , chosen based on the quality of the sexual and arrestment signal produced in the labial glands [ 4 - 7 ] .
only a fraction of young fertilized queens survive the winter , and their success is often linked to the amount of energy stored in their fb [ 8 - 10 ] .
in spring , the queen first restores her energy reserves and then begins laying eggs and nurturing her first offspring .
she stops collecting food after the first workers have emerged and remains within the nest for the rest of her life .
in bombus terrestris , the production of a new generation of reproductives starts approximately 4 weeks after the first workers' emergence , and the nest founder usually dies during this period [ 11 ] .
knowledge as to the composition of bumblebee energy reserves consists in only a few studies , reporting namely quantifications of glycogen content in freshly emerged queens and workers [ 12 ] and male triacylglycerols ( tg ) profile in several bumblebee species [ 13 - 15 ] .
unlike short - lived males with a single dominant activity , queens are exposed to many energy - demanding processes .
we hypothesized that the queen 's fb , as a major energy storage organ and a site of intermediary metabolism , undergoes extreme changes in structure and function over the course of the queen 's life , with lipid accumulation before and after hibernation , lipid consumption during hibernation and colony founding , and adaptation to low temperatures [ 16 - 19 ] .
cold adaptation runs through two basic mechanisms , i.e. polyol accumulation and / or restructuring of membrane phospholipids ( pl ) .
a similar adaptation may occur in bumblebees .
thus , we hypothesized that bumblebees' cell membranes restructure in response to cold during overwintering .
to the best of our knowledge , none of the above hypotheses have been verified nor have the phenomena been studied in detail .
therefore , we focused on studying structural changes in the fb as well as changes in lipid composition [ intact tg , pl , fatty acids ( fa )] in six life stages of b. terrestris queens , namely in pharate , freshly emerged , pre - hibernating , post - hibernating , young , and senescent queens .
materials and methods biological material bombus terrestris terrestris ( linnaeus , 1758 ) queens ( buff - tailed bumblebee ) originated from laboratory cultures at the research institute for fodder crops , ltd .
troubsko , czech republic [ 20 ] .
the laboratory conditions of nest development simulated a natural photoperiod .
the studied queens ( 198 specimens ) were used in the following stages : pharate queens ( immature individuals black in color extracted from pupal cuticles shortly before emerging ) , callow queens ( the first day of adult stage ) , mated queens before hibernation ( age 5 days ) , queens during hibernation ( age 15 weeks , 3 weeks at 28degreesc , and 3 months at 4degreesc ; only for membrane pl investigation ) , queens after hibernation ( after 5 months at 4degreesc ) , egg - laying queens ( 5th day after the first eggs were laid or on the day when the first cocoon of the brood spooned into cocoons ) , and senescent queens ( from colonies already producing their own sexuals ) .
microscopy analyses two living queens of each age were subjected to structural study .
these were submerged into fixative ( a mixture of 2 % glutaraldehyde and 2.5 % formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ) , and several pieces of abdominal tergites and sternites ( together with the underlying fb ) were cut out with fine scissors .
further steps were taken similarly to those in a previously published protocol [ 5 ] .
to evaluate adipocyte size , three sections per sample were analyzed and each originated at least 50 mum ( 100 sections ) from other studied semi - thin sections of the same sample .
we determined the three largest adipocyte sections , because these probably represent the real size of original cells , and measured the length and width of each .
adipocyte shape was considered to be ellipsoid and its volume was calculated from two measured cell dimensions ; the third was approximated as the mean of the other two .
to evaluate the proportion of each particular inclusion type ( lipids , glycogen , and proteins ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images were analyzed quantitatively by manually evaluating each kind of inclusion according to the specific characteristic of each : proteins appear as heavy electron - dense biocrystals or granules , lipids as moderately electron - dense droplets located freely in the cytoplasm , and glycogen in the form of small berry - like rosettes .
other lipid classes ( diacylglycerols , pl , etc. ) were not included into the semi - quantification because identifying these analytes is beyond the capability of the tem methodology .
imagej software ( national institutes of health , usa , public domain http :// www.scijava.org /) was used to count up the selected areas .
cumulative areas were expressed as a percent of the total adipocyte section and at least 10,000 mum2 of adipocytes sections were analyzed per sample ( between 20,000 and 35,000 mum2 per stage ) .
chemicals standards of tg ( purity 99 %) were purchased from larodan fine chemicals ( malmo , sweden ) and nu - chek prep ( elysian , mn , usa ) .
gradient grade acetonitril - chromasolv ( r ) for high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) as well as gradient grade methanol and n - hexane ( merck , kenilworth , nj , usa ) were used as received ; other solvents ( chloroform , diethyl ether , and 2 - propanol ) were distilled in glass from analytical - grade products ( penta , prague , czech republic ) .
2,6 - di - tert - butyl - 4 - methylphenol ( butylated hydroxytoluene ) and ammonium acetate were purchased from fluka ( buchs , switzerland ) .
sample preparation queens were frozen at - 18degreesc and their abdomens were then cut off .
within 24 h , the fb were dissected by scraping from the inner side of the abdominal cuticle , extracted in chloroform : methanol ( 1:1,v / v ) , and treated as previously reported [ 21 ] .
fb extracts were evaporated to dryness and total lipids were weighed .
the remainder of the body ( head , thorax , and legs ) was dried for 2 h at 80degreesc followed by 1 h at 110degreesc and then weighed .
several replications ( 5 - 7 specimens ) of each life stage were used for tg analyses .
samples were stored at - 80degreesc prior to analyses .
crude extracts were separated using thin - layer chromatography and the tg fractions were treated as previously described [ 13 ] .
for the study of cold adaptation , two groups of queens ( n = 5 ) were used : 1 ) queens after mating and prepared for hibernation ( pre - overwintering ) , and 2 ) queens during overwintering ( at 4degreesc for 3 months ) in laboratory conditions .
fb were dissected and extracted directly as the queens were taken from the refrigerator .
high performance liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry ( hplc / ms ) hplc / ms with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ( apci ) was used for the tg analyses as described by jiros et al .
[ 15 ] .
in order to evaluate the total lipid composition , we used hplc combined with electrospray ionization mass - spectrometry ( ms - esi ) ( modified according to ref. 19 ) .
this method is especially useful for studying membrane pl and their changes during overwintering .
lipids were separated on a gemini hplc column ( 150 x 2.0 mm , 3 mum ; phenomenex , torrance , ca , usa ) .
the mobile phase was composed of ( a ) ammonium acetate in methanol ( 5 mmol / l ) , ( b ) water , and ( c ) 2 - propanol .
a linear gradient of a : b : c changing from 92:8:0 to 50:0:50 within 80 min was used with a flow rate of 150 mul / min .
the mass spectrometer was operated with esi source in the positive ion detection mode at + 4 kv and capillary temperature at 220degreesc .
nitrogen was used as both the shielding and the auxiliary gas .
mass range 440 - 1100 da was scanned every 0.5 s to obtain the esi mass spectra .
for the investigation of glycerolipid structures , the collision - induced decomposition multi - stage ion trap tandem spectra ms2 were recorded with respective 5 and 3 da isolation windows .
maximum ion injection time was 100 ms and collision energies were 30 % ( ms2 ) .
statistical evaluations to evaluate differences in adipocyte size among the queen stages , the log - transformed data were subjected to one - way anova with tukey 's post - hoc multiple comparison test performed using r package , version 2.14.2 ( http :// www.r - project.org /) .
the data obtained from the tem analysis ( glycogen , lipid droplets and protein granules ) , as well as tg and pl peak areas were statistically evaluated using ordination methods as follows : for all data - detrended correspondence analysis ( dca ) ; for linear data - principal component analysis ( pca ) , redundancy analysis ( rda ) , and monte - carlo permutation test ( unrestricted permutations , n = 999 ) ; and for unimodal data - correspondence analysis ( ca ) , constrained correspondence analysis ( cca ) , and monte - carlo permutation test .
for each , the relative inclusion areas and peak areas were calculated in the deconvoluted total cell and peak area .
in the canonical analyses ( rda , pca ) , the queens' age , or stage , stood as a categorical predictor .
monte - carlo permutation tests were used to determine statistical significance .
canoco 4.5 statistical software ( biometris , plant research international , wageningen ur , netherlands ) was used for the dca , ca , cca , pca , rda , and monte - carlo permutation test analyses .

fat body structure the two principal cell types in the fb of b. terrestris queens are adipocytes and oenocytes ( s1 fig ) .
adipocytes are very large ( for a comparison of adipocyte sizes among the studied stages , see s1 table and s2 fig ) and more abundant compared to oenocytes .
the two cell types are often intermingled , although some areas with predominance of a single cell type were observed .
oenocytes can be distinguished from adipocytes by the absence of both glycogen and lipid droplets and the presence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and large amounts of irregular electron - dense granules .
the ultrastructure of adipocytes in b. terrestris queens of various life stages is shown in fig 1 .
the following description is based on the adipocytes of callow queens .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142261.g001 fig 1 ultrastructure of adipocytes in b. terrestris queens : pharate ( a ) , callow ( b ) , before hibernation ( c ) , after hibernation ( d ) , egg - laying ( e ) , and senescent ( f ) .
scale bars represent 10 mum .
note the flat and highly condensed nucleus prior to hibernation and the initial phase of nucleus elimination in senescent queen .
abbreviations : cv , central vacuole ; g , glycogen ; ld , lipid droplet ; m , mitochondria ; n , nucleus ; pg , protein granule ; rer , rough endoplasmic reticulum .
each adipocyte is enclosed in a basement membrane formed by a single lamina about 70 nm thick .
basal invaginations are well - developed , up to 2 mum deep .
nuclei are highly irregular , formed by dispersed chromatin , and with only a few larger aggregates .
the cytoplasm is rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum ( rer ) and free ribosomes ; other secretory organelles were not observed .
mitochondria are abundant , scattered throughout the cytoplasm .
three kinds of inclusions were observed , with lipid droplets being the most abundant ( up to 30 mum in diameter ) .
glycogen accumulations ( in the form of moderately electron - dense rosettes ) are located predominantly at the cell periphery .
proteins occur in two forms , as electron - dense granules and heavy electron - dense biocrystals , and both of these are relatively rare .
other observed structures comprise some microtubules and rarely lysosomes ( small vacuoles of heterogeneous content ) .
each cell is equipped with a central vacuole [ 22 ] of variable size ( between approximately 5 and 40 mum at the largest dimension ) , in which lipid droplets were infrequently observed to dissolve .
differences in fb structure among stages are summarized below .
adipocytes in pharate queens reveal higher biosynthetic activity , as evidenced by more abundant rer , higher proportion of protein granules , and slightly larger nuclei filled with more dispersed chromatin with scarce aggregates .
also lysosomes are more abundant compared to callow queens .
queens before hibernation possess the largest adipocytes of all stages ( see s1 table , s2 fig ) , due to accumulation of enormous amounts of lipid droplets and glycogen .
nearly the whole cell volume is filled with these inclusions ; lipid droplets become irregular due to their crowding .
there is a low volume of cytoplasm , located only around highly condensed nucleus .
also the number of mitochondria decreases .
the central vacuole is absent from this stage on. adipocytes in queens after hibernation are relatively small .
the cells contain high amounts of glycogen , but the amount of lipid droplets is relatively low .
nuclei stay highly condensed , but the volume of the cytoplasm increases , as well as the number of mitochondria .
adipocytes of egg - laying queens contain high amounts of rer and populous mitochondria .
there is also a high amount of proteins ( both , granules and biocrystals ) .
other inclusions comprise low amounts of glycogen and lipid droplets .
basal invaginations are very well - developed , often associated with mitochondria and reaching up to 10 mum deep .
nuclei are large , filled with dispersed chromatin and few larger aggregates .
senescent queens reveal similar structure as observed in egg - laying queens , with exception of lower amounts of glycogen and lipid droplets , lower number of protein granules , and higher numbers of biocrystals .
rare observations suggest the possibility of adipocyte apoptosis , as few nuclei were observed containing electron dense vesicles representing probably lysosomes ( fig 1f ) .
the individual life stages differ in the representation of storage inclusions ( lipids , glycogen , and proteins ) .
in most stages ( pharate , callow , before and after hibernation ) , these inclusions formed almost the entire cell section ( more than 90 %) .
during the egg - laying and senescent stages , on the other hand , the fb contained just 10 - 20 % of inclusions .
the later life stages include well - developed machinery for protein production ( voluminous rer ) , but they also contained a large volume of organelle - free cytoplasm .
the results of semi - quantitative measurement of glycogen , tg ( i.e. , lipid droplets ) , and proteins ( electron - dense granules ) obtained from tem are shown in fig 2 .
subsequent monte carlo testing of the cca analyses of quantification data considered as unimodal ( i.e. , with gradient value higher than 1.5 ) revealed significant differences among particular age stages ( p = 0.001 ) ( s3 fig ) .
the greatest lipids content was found in queens before hibernation , pharate queens , and callow queens , while the largest amounts of glycogen were detected in queens before and after hibernation and in pharate queens ( fig 2 ) .
surprisingly , the amount of glycogen is comparable in queens before and after overwintering. that is in contrast to a dramatic decrease in tg content ( fig 2 ) .
egg - laying and senescent queens are the most similar stages and had the lowest contents of lipids and glycogen ( s3 fig ) .
on the other hand , the content of proteins and other cell parts ( cytoplasm , endoplasmic reticulum , etc. ) was greatest in older queens ( fig 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142261.g002 fig 2 comparison of cell volume and the proportions of glycogen , lipid droplets , and proteins at each life stage from transmission electron micrographs .
since only two individuals per stage were used for structural analyses , the significance of statistical results should not be overestimated , and these results serve as a comparison to chemical data .
trends in total lipids , tg , and body weights during the queen 's life , the greatest changes occur in the abdomen where the fb is located .
the highest amount of total lipids was obtained from queens before hibernation ( 35.5 +/ - 17.0 mg ) , while the lowest amount ( 6.1 +/ - 4.1 mg ) was recorded after hibernation ( table 1 , fig 3 ) .
after egg - laying and further aging , the amount of lipids again showed a slightly increasing trend .
the hplc / ms ( apci and esi ) analyses of all lipid classes ( polar and nonpolar lipids ) showed that reproductive stages contained higher proportions of polar lipids compared to others ( s4 fig ) .
while tg were fairly abundant at all stages , pl and diacylglycerol content increased considerably in egg - laying and senescent queens ( s4 fig ) .
the ratio between tg and pl varies among stages , the lowest value being observed in egg - laying queens .
the body weight ( without abdomen ) changes only little during the queen lifespan with an insignificant maximum before hibernation ( s2 table ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142261.t001 table 1 total lipid and tg weights in the fb of queens at different life stages ( mean +/ - sd ) .
total lipids tg life stage weight [ mg ] ( number of samples ) pharate 19.3 +/ - 5.2 ( 17 ) 17.6 +/ - 1.5 ( 5 ) callow 11.9 +/ - 2.7 ( 27 ) 8.8 +/ - 0.5 ( 6 ) before hibernation 35.5 +/ - 17.0 ( 19 ) 21.1 +/ - 3.9 ( 6 ) after hibernation 6.1 +/ - 4.1 ( 19 ) 4.5 +/ - 3.9 ( 6 ) egg - laying 7.7 +/ - 2.1 ( 34 ) 1.3 +/ - 0.5 ( 6 ) senescent 9.1 +/ - 4.1 ( 16 ) 3.8 +/ - 3.7 ( 7 ) tg , triacylglycerols 10.1371 / journal.pone.0142261.g003 fig 3 trends of changes in adipocyte size , total lipid weight , and triacylglycerol ( tg ) weight in queens at different life stages ( mean values , cf. table 1 and s1 table ) .
adipocyte volume in mum3 ; lipid weight in mg ; tg weight in mg. tg analysis and fatty acid composition altogether , 46 tg were identified and their equivalent carbon number ( ecn ) ranged between 40 and 52 .
the substances with lower ecn ( 40 , 42 ) were present in smaller proportions ( below 1 %) , while the most abundant tg were those of ecn 44 or 46 ( s3 table ) .
the composition of tg blends differed both qualitatively and quantitatively among life stages ( s5 fig and s3 , s4 tables ) .
detailed study of the obtained dataset revealed that some of the most abundant tg showed stable relative proportions through the queens' lifespan ( s4 table , group a ) .
several tg are obviously accumulated in relation to overwintering ( especially those containing monounsaturated fatty acids ; group b ) , while their saturated associates displayed the opposite trend ( group c ) ( fig 4a and s4 table ) .
other components in the samples were present in amounts less than 1 % or were not detectable at all at some stages ( s3 table ) .
cca statistical analysis of tg composition and the semi - quantification dataset followed by monte carlo testing revealed significant differences in particular life stages ( p < 0.01 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142261.g004 fig 4 ( a ) trends in proportions of the most abundant triacylglycerols ( tg ) .
upper diagram shows the accumulation of particular tg in life stages involved in overwintering .
lower diagram shows a significant reduction in particular tg at the indicated life stages .
( b ) trends in proportions of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids ( fa ) obtained by recalculation of hplc / ms - apci data .
diagrams are focused on the most abundant fa , and some trends connected with overwintering are also observed .
generally , accumulation of monounsaturated fa and a decreased level of saturated fa in after - and before - hibernation life stages are obvious .
relative percentages were calculated from integrated peak areas of particular chromatographic peaks .
the most abundant fa was oleic acid ( 18:1 , 32 - 52 %) followed by palmitic acid ( 16:0 , 10 - 28 %) and myristic acid ( 14:0 , 2 - 12 % ; s5 table ) .
rda statistics and subsequent monte carlo testing of the recalculated fa dataset did not show significant differences in the fa composition of fb at particular life stages .
particular fa did , however , display certain trends over the lifespan ( fig 4b ) .
the proportion of saturated fa decreased in life stages connected to hibernation while the proportion of monounsaturated fa showed the opposite trend .
the proportion of polyunsaturated fa ( namely 18:3 ) did not change substantially during hibernation either in structural pl or in the storage tg ( s5 table and s6 table ) .
across the lifespan , however , the proportions followed a pattern similar to that of saturated fa , reaching the lowest point before hibernation ( s5 table ) .
a detailed study examined membrane pl identification and quantification in relation to queen hibernation .
we determined 6 species of lyso - pl , 18 species of phosphatidylethanolamines ( pe ) , 13 species of phosphatidylcholines ( pc ) , and 4 species of phosphatidylserines using hplc / ms - esi .
the dominant lipid species was dioleoyl pc ( pc 18:1 / 18:1 ) , comprising almost 40 % of all pl , followed by dioleoyl pe ( pe 18:1 / 18:1 ) ( at 15 %) .
the result of the monte carlo testing revealed no significant differences between pl of queens before and during hibernation , and furthermore no trends were noted in our datasets ( s6 table ) .
discussion our results show that the fb physiology of bumblebee queens changes dramatically several times during their lifes .
both electron microscopy and chemical analyses of lipids highlighted seasonal variability in the amounts of stored lipid and showed those values reaching a maximum before hibernation .
the results match the earlier work of alford [ 23 ] , who noted that queens possess the largest fb , that these increase in size as well as fat content after emergence , and that up to 80 % of reserves are used during overwintering .
there were significant differences among life stages in the content of basic inclusions .
this is true especially for glycogen and tg observed in the form of lipid droplets [ 24 ] .
the principal cells of the fb , the adipocytes ( often called trophocytes , but the same term is also applied to the nurse cells of meroistic ovarioles ) , store large amounts of energy in the form of glycogen ( a readily utilizable source of energy ) or tg ( a slowly accessible energy source but also the most dense in terms of energy - content [ 24 ]) .
the adipocytes also produce hexamerins ( storage proteins ) , vitellogenins ( glycolipoproteins , major components of yolk ) , and many other classes of proteins [ 25 ] .
in other social hymenoptera , the queen 's fb consists of up to 11 different fb cell types ( monomorium [ 26 ] ; for review see haunerland and shirk [ 27 ]) .
oenocytes are known to synthesize non - storage hydrocarbons [ 28 ] .
they also reveal just a slight ultrastructural variation during the queen 's life , thus suggesting that they perform a similar function irrespective of age .
while oenocytes occur in b. terrestris only in the peripheral fb , scarce adipocytes are present also near the gut and among the malpighian tubules , and these differ considerably in their ultrastructure from peripheral adipocytes ( js , unpublished observation ) .
protein content in adipocytes revealed a u - shaped development , with large amounts observed in the youngest and the oldest age categories .
the dominant form of proteins in pharate queens ( and to a lesser extent also in callow queens ) consisted of electron - dense vesicles of heterogeneous content and less abundant biocrystals , probably linked with finalization in building basic body structures .
in queens before and after hibernation , protein content is very low .
on the other hand , large amounts of protein granules and biocrystals occur in reproductively active queens and , since the ultrastructural features of these inclusions are very similar to those of vitellogenins , which are proven to comprise part of the adipocytes in solenopsis queens [ 26 ] , we expect that these proteins form a substantial part of the developing egg yolk .
over a queen 's lifetime , tg composition changes both quantitatively and qualitatively ( see s5 fig ) , and multivariate analysis of all detected tg ( s3 table ) showed significant differences in tg profiles among particular life stages .
previous studies in insects have considered changes only in fa composition but not in intact lipids [ 29 - 31 ] .
in bumblebee queens , the composition of intact tg molecules showed highly significant trends in association with overwintering .
studies on fa composition of various insect tissues [ 32 ] , as well as fa utilization during energy stress [ 33 ] , development [ 24,32,34 ] , and reproduction [ 33 ] indicate that particular fa indeed perform different roles in insect metabolism .
beenakkers et al .
[ 35 ] reported on the existence of two different acylglycerol pools in fb with expected differences in the manner of their utilization .
metabolic tg belonging to group a ( fig 4 ) dominate also in the males' fb [ 15 ] while queen - specific tg change during the queens' life .
this may indicate their relationship to overwintering and possibly also to future egg formation and / or development with their special metabolic requirements beyond the needs of short - lived males .
the most significant changes in lipid composition are undoubtedly connected to hibernation ( fig 4a ) .
the fat reserves are clearly of great importance for insects in order to meet their energy demands during hibernation [ 36 ] .
naturally occurring queens could be expected to deplete even more energy reserves during diapause as hibernation lasts longer in nature ( ca 8 weeks compared to 5 weeks in laboratory conditions ) .
the amount of fat used during hibernation also depends on overwintering temperature .
vesterlund et al .
[ 37 ] found that at higher winter temperatures metabolism ( in terms of enzyme activity ) is faster and more fat is therefore metabolized compared to cold winters .
as for fa composition , we could see clear trends in qualitative changes : monounsaturated fa level increased before hibernation at the expense of saturated analogues that are preferably consumed during winter ( fig 4b ) .
therefore , the utilization of fa for energy demands during hibernation is nonrandom and involves lipases with selective preferences .
a similar phenomenon has been described in locusta migratoria showing selective mobilization of fa by adipokinetic hormones [ 33 ] .
substantial amounts of glycogen are present in three of queens' life stages : pharate , before hibernation , and after hibernation .
pharate queens deplete glycogen storage for metamorphosis such that only traces remain in freshly emerged queens' fb. after emergence and during their sexually active life phase , queens build up glycogen again ( fig 2 ) .
the level of glycogen surprisingly does not drop during hibernation , indicating that hibernation expenses are covered exclusively by tg. glycogen stores may also be used as a source of polyol cryoprotectants [ 18,37 ] .
the common response of an insect to low temperatures consists in membrane restructuring [ 16,19 ] and / or the accumulation of polyols [ 17,18 ] .
inasmuch as our hplc / ms - esi data on pl membrane composition in overwintering queens revealed no significant changes , carbohydrate - based cryoprotectant accumulation is expected to take place in overwintering processes .
low temperatures may promote the conversion of glycogen stores into glycerol [ 38 ] , sorbitol , or ribitol [ 18 ] .
on the contrary , the gall fly eurosta solidaginis is known to reconvert carbohydrate - based cryoprotectants back into glycogen at the end of the cold season [ 39 ] .
similar mechanisms should not therefore be excluded in overwintering queens , and this may explain the high levels of glycogen before and after hibernation .
a combination of optical and transmission electron microscopy with analytical chemistry techniques provides detailed insight into the structural and functional changes of b. terrestris queens' fb during adulthood .
in relation to overwintering and reproduction , bumblebee queens undergo substantial physiological changes which are accompanied by changes in lipid amounts and composition as well as changes in glycogen content .
the most pronounced changes and trends in cell structure as well as lipid composition are definitely connected to hibernation , the stage imposing the highest energy demands during the queen 's life .

lung cancer is the commonest cause of acrometastatic disease to the fingers .
here we describe a case of occult lung cancer presenting as unrelenting finger pain and swelling from a metastatic phalangeal fracture .
the patient 's management was largely palliative and he died soon after discovery of the primary tumor .
digital acrometastatic disease rarely becomes symptomatic before the primary lung cancer is diagnosed and , as observed in this case , carries a very poor prognosis .
clinicians should be cognizant of the strong association between digital acrometastases and bronchogenic carcinoma and vigilant in screening high - risk patients with importunate finger symptoms .
1. introduction the bones of the finger rarely harbor metastatic disease , but when they do , it is a revealing clinical finding .
most bony metastases , including nondigital acrometastatic disease , arise from a wide array of primary tumors ( e.g. , prostate , lung , kidney , breast , gastrointestinal ). by contrast , the etiology of digital acrometastases is almost exclusively bronchogenic carcinoma [ 1 ] .
fortunately , digital acrometastatic lung cancer is seldom seen , accounting for approximately one out of 500 lung cancers with bony metastases [ 2 ] .
it carries a grim prognosis , with a mean survival of three to six months after presentation [ 3 , 4 ] .
here we describe a case of occult lung cancer presenting as metastatic disease to the finger .
2. case presentation a 53 - year - old guamanian - american man with seven pack - years of smoking , asbestos exposure as a child , and a family history of lung cancer suffered from a swollen , erythematous , painful tip of the left third finger .
he first blamed the swelling on an embedded splinter , which he quickly dislodged with warm compresses and tweezers .
however , the swelling persisted and the erythema deepened ( see figure 1 ) .
after two months of unremitting finger pain , he developed right hip pain subsequent to falling off a ladder .
his primary care physician attributed the finger and hip pain to trauma , prescribed etodolac , and ordered a radiograph of the hip , which was unremarkable .
two weeks later , the patient presented to the emergency department with sudden - onset chest pain , exacerbated by deep breathing .
he was tachypneic , tachycardic , and slightly hypoxic .
computed tomography revealed a right upper lobe lung mass and right hilar adenopathy .
poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma , characterized by positivity to mucin , ck7 , ttf1 , p63 , and ck5 / 6 , was seen on lung pathology .
the patient received high - dose intravenous narcotics but nonetheless reported persistent finger pain .
orthopedics was consulted .
two radiographic views of the left hand showed a highly aggressive lytic lesion involving the distal phalanx with permeative margins and slight immature periosteal reaction .
there was significant associated soft tissue swelling or mass , as well as an associated minimally displaced pathologic fracture through the midportion of the phalanx .
additionally , there were adjacent tiny ossific or calcific fragments , possibly displaced bony fragments or dystrophic soft tissue calcification ( see figure 2 ) .
taken together , the radiographic findings argued strongly against a traumatic injury , but instead supported a destructive and infiltrating process , such as lytic metastasis .
the patient declined biopsy , elected comfort measures only , and died one month later .
3. discussion acrometastasis is reported infrequently , with only one out of 1000 bony metastases traveling to the hand [ 5 ] .
the primary tumors most implicated , in order of prevalence , are lung , kidney , breast , and gastrointestinal [ 4 ] .
men are more likely to be affected than women , with solitary phalangeal lesions commonly observed [ 4 ] .
the tumor cells are thought to migrate to the bones of the hand via blood , not lymphatics [ 6 ] .
although the wide hematogenous spread of many visceral organ tumors is often restricted by the hepatic and pulmonary capillary beds , malignant cells of the lung have unimpeded access to the distal arterial system .
this may explain why the commonest source of acrometastic disease is bronchogentaic carcinoma [ 6 ] .
while acrometastatic lung cancer is rare , occult lung cancer presenting as metastasis to the finger is even more exceptional .
although good epidemiologic data for lung cancer are unavailable , one small study found that approximately 10 % of acrometastases became symptomatic before the primary tumor was identified [ 7 ] .
the presentation of digital acrometastatic lesions varies .
the affected finger may appear infected , with tenderness , erythema , heat , and swelling [ 8 ] .
in addition , the overlying skin may weep , bleed , or ulcerate [ 3 , 9 ] .
terminal phalanges of the dominant hand are most commonly involved [ 4 , 10 ] .
importantly , bronchogenic metastases to bone are usually lytic in nature [ 4 ] .
although the current case did not have a biopsy - proven acrometastatic lesion , radiographic differential considerations were narrow and supported an aggressive lytic metastasis to bone in a patient with known lung cancer .
nonetheless , another process , such as acute osteomyelitis or primary neoplasm , could not be excluded without biopsy .
as seen in this case , patients may report a history of trauma to the affected finger .
interestingly , some authors argue that a history of trauma is causal , not coincident , by introducing malignant cells to the bone through increased blood flow and the release of local chemotactic factors [ 11 ] .
these factors , including prostaglandins , promote cell migration and adhesion to bone , and may create a conduit for metastatic disease .
given the bleak prognosis of digital acrometastatic lung cancer , treatment is largely palliative .
amputation and chemotherapy have been used , but recent literature suggests that localized radiotherapy can successfully relieve pain and return function to the affected finger [ 4 ] .
there may also be a targeted role for bone - remodeling pharmacotherapies , such as bisphosphonates or denosumab , which have demonstrated utility in treating other bony metastases [ 12 , 13 ] .
as this case illustrates , clinicians must be mindful in screening patients at risk for lung cancer with persistent digital symptoms .

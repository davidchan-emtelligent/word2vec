patas monkeys ( erythrocebus patas ) living in african savanna woodlands and grassland habitats have a locomotor system that allows them to run fast , presumably to avoid predators .
long fore - and hindlimbs , long foot bones , short toes , and a digitigrade foot posture were proposed as anatomical correlates with speed .
in addition to skeletal proportions , soft tissue and whole body proportions are important components of the locomotor system .
to further distinguish patas anatomy from other old world monkeys , a comparative study based on dissection of skin , muscle , and bone from complete individuals of patas and vervet monkeys ( cercopithecus aethiops ) was undertaken .
analysis reveals that small adjustments in patas skeletal proportions , relative mass of limbs and tail , and specific muscle groups promote efficient sagittal limb motion .
the ability to run fast is based on a locomotor system adapted for long distance walking .
the patas' larger home range and longer daily range than those of vervets give them access to highly dispersed , nutritious foods , water , and sleeping trees .
furthermore , patas monkeys have physiological adaptations that enable them to tolerate and dissipate heat .
these features all contribute to the distinct adaptation that is the patas monkeys' basis for survival in grassland and savanna woodland areas .
1. introduction patas monkeys ( erythrocebus [ cercopithecus ] patas ) live in dry , seasonal habitats in grass and woodland savannas across northern africa between the equator and sahara , from ethiopia to senegal and southwards into northern tanzania [ 1 ] .
their adaptation to these landscapes contrasts with that of sympatric vervet monkeys ( cercopithecus aethiops ) and baboons ( papio cynocephalus ) [ 2 ] .
the discovery that patas monkeys run at high speeds was interpreted as a unique locomotor adaptation to avoid predators [ 3 , 4 ] .
skeletal features - - lengthened limbs , short digits , and digital foot postures - - have been cited as the anatomical bases ( e.g. , [ 3 , 5 - 7 ]) .
compared to new world monkeys ( ceboidea ) and apes ( hominoidea ) old world monkeys ( cercopithecoidea ) are remarkably uniform in body dimensions and share a " generalized quadrupedal " locomotor pattern [ 8 ] .
due to anatomical similarities , we incorporate soft tissue associated with the locomotor system to tease out potential species - specific patterns .
two studies stand out in adding new details to patas locomotor function .
based on dissections of the leg and foot and radiography and cine - film , wood [ 9 ] linked the musculoskeleton of the hindlimb with locomotor biomechanics .
compared to baboons , patas monkeys have reduced motion at the ankle joint , longer tarsals and metatarsals , shorter phalanges , and fore - and hindlimbs oriented in the parasagittal plane .
wood interpreted this anatomy as convergent with cursorial mammals .
in a later study , hurov [ 10 ] compared patas and vervet monkey vertebral columns .
using cine - film , he measured the flexibility of the back during fast running and found that the patas vertebral column has limited flexion - extension compared to that of vervets .
he found that vervets have thicker intervertebral discs and a broader transverse rib cage that promotes greater back mobility and a significantly increased stride length .
patas monkeys have thinner intervertebral discs and a narrower and deeper rib cage that decreases sagittal bending ; patas monkeys rely on lengthened fore - and hindlimbs for increased stride length .
these regional studies clarify the role of leg , foot , and back structures in locomotor function .
to date there have been no studies of complete patas locomotor anatomy , including forelimbs as well as hindlimbs , and musculature as well as the skeleton .
the research presented here adds to previous studies and provides new data on functional anatomy of patas with comparisons to vervet monkeys .
dissections of entire animals give holistic information on limbs , back , tail , and musculoskeletal system .
vervet monkeys serve as a useful comparison because ( 1 ) they represent a generalized quadruped ; 15 million year old fossil monkeys , victoriapithecus , most closely resemble vervet body size and limb bone traits [ 11 , 12 ] ; ( 2 ) they are the closest relatives to patas with a recent divergence of 2 - 4 million years ago [ 13 - 15 ] ; ( 3 ) they are sympatric with patas at study sites so that behavioral ecologies can be compared .
we address the following questions : how unique are patas monkeys and how have they diverged from vervet monkeys in limb proportions , muscle distribution , and muscle groups ?
how well do these data support the concept that patas monkeys converge with cursorial mammals ?
given the close evolutionary relationship of patas and vervet monkeys , we expect patas to show overall anatomical similarity to vervet monkeys .
we also expect that differences that do exist will be slight , but when taken together will show a distinct functional pattern .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animal sample two patas monkeys from the university of california , berkeley colony for research on social behavior died of natural causes and became available for postmortum study .
the vervet monkeys were acquired for teaching and donated to this study.all animals were dissected unpreserved ( table 1 ) .
the male patas was a well - muscled adult with fully erupted canine teeth and all long bones fused ; he showed no sign of illness or disease .
his body weight at 11.3 kg is in the range reported for captive and wild males ( e.g. , 7.4 - 12.6 kg , [ 3 , 10 , 16 , 17 ]) .
the female patas was immature ( 1.5 yr old ) and at 4.1 kg is close to but not yet at adult weight ( e.g. , 4.4 - 7.6 kg , [ 10 , 17 ]) , an indicator of how quickly female patas monkeys mature [ 18 ] .
the vervet monkeys were well - muscled adults .
the male weight at 6.4 kg is in the range of published reports ( 4.3 - 6.6 kg , [ 10 , 17 , 19 ]) and the female at 3.5 kg similarly ( 2.9 - 5.8 kg , [ 17 , 19 ]) .
only the males are compared in muscle distribution and proportions to avoid the confounding variable of sex , and in the case of the patas female , age differences [ 19 , 20 ] .
2.2 .
methods of dissection and data collection prior to dissection , photographs and external measurements ( after [ 21 ]) are taken on head / trunk length ( vertex to ischium ) and tail length .
standardized dissection methods provide quantitative information on body segments , body composition , and muscle groups [ 22 - 24 ] .
one side of the body is dissected by segments .
the forelimb is detached from the trunk at the shoulder joint , the hindlimb , and at the hip joint .
the tail is weighed as a unit .
each limb is then separated into arm , forearm , and hand and thigh , leg , and foot segments .
each is weighed and further divided into muscle , bone , and skin ; each tissue is weighed separately and recorded with its associated segment ( figure 1 ) .
on the other side , individual muscles are dissected with tendon intact and weighed immediately .
skin , bone , and other tissues are separated and weighed .
similarly , the head / trunk muscles , including the back extensors and tail muscles , are separated and weighed .
after the skeleton is cleaned using dermestid beetles , the bones are measured .
2.3 .
methods of analysis ( 1 ) segment mass analysis on the forelimb , hindlimb , and tail masses are each calculated relative to total body mass ; segments within each limb are calculated relative to total limb mass .
( 2 ) body composition is determined by adding all the muscle , bone , and skin tissues from the entire dissection .
each is then calculated as a percentage of total body mass .
( 3 ) total body bone is taken as 100 % .
its distribution to the body is determined as follows .
forelimb : humerus , radius , ulna , and hand bones from both sides of the body are taken as a percent of total body bone ; similarly in the hindlimb , femur , patella , tibia , fibula , and foot bones are taken as percent of total bone .
bone from the tail is calculated separately .
skull , trunk , pectoral , and pelvic girdles comprise the head / trunk segment .
total body muscle is taken as 100 % .
its distribution to limb and tail segments is determined as follows .
forelimb : all forelimb muscles plus those that attach to the humerus ( latissimus dorsi , pectoralis major , teres major , teres minor , supraspinatus , infraspinatus , and subscapularis ) are added together , doubled , and taken as a percent of total body muscle .
similarly , all hindlimb muscles plus hip muscles that attach to the femur ( the gluteals , iliopsoas , obturator internus and externus , and gemelli ) are taken as a percent of total body muscle .
tail muscle is taken as a percent of total body muscle .
( 4 ) muscles are grouped according to their relationship to movement , and a ratio of antagonists is determined , for example , flexors to extensors .
relative mass of individual muscles or muscle groups serves as a gross approximation of functional importance at the joint .
only the adult male patas and male vervet are compared in limb segment , muscle distribution , and muscle mass due to possible confounding variables of age and sex in these dimensions ( e.g. , [ 20 , 25 , 26 ]) .
( 5 ) indices are calculated from bone lengths : claviculohumeral index ( clavicle as percent of humerus length , after [ 27 ]) ; humerofemoral ( humerus to femur length ) ; intermembral ( humerus plus radius as a percent of femur plus tibia lengths ) ; brachial ( humerus to radius length ) ; crural ( femur to tibia length ) .
foot bones are measured , and relative lengths are calculated after schultz [ 28 ] .
relative tail length is taken as a percentage of total body length ( trunk length plus tail length ) .
3. results external assessment of the body is made prior to dissection .
the patas chest is narrow and deep which is reflected in the lowest chest index ( 84 ) reported for old world monkeys by schultz [ 29 ] .
the skin fold at the axillary region attaches low on the arm segment to bring the forelimb close to the trunk ( figure 1 ) .
the male patas tail is 47.4 % of total body length , the male vervet is 59.2 % and female vervet 58.8 % .
these measurements were not available for the female patas .
the contribution of muscle , bone , and skin , components of the locomotor system is reported in table 2 .
both the female patas and the female vervet have relatively less muscle mass than do the males , a sex difference noted in some old world monkey species [ 19 , 20 ] .
these three tissues together comprise 68.1 to 74.7 % of total body mass .
in relative mass of body segments , the two species are similar , although the patas monkeys have a slightly heavier head / trunk segment and lighter tail .
the relatively lighter forelimb of the female patas may be due to her younger age or to being female ( figure 2 ) .
within the segments , patas monkey limbs are slightly more tapered , with heavier arm and thigh segments and lighter hand and foot ( figure 3 ) .
distribution of bone to the segments is the same in the female and male of each species , and the two species differ in that patas monkeys have relatively heavier bones ( table 2 , figure 4 ) .
distribution of muscle to the segments is similar in the male patas and male vervet , though the patas has slightly more muscle in the hindlimb and less in the back and tail ( figure 5 ) .
muscle groups at key joints show differences .
patas and vervet differ in relative proportions of extensors to flexors at the elbow joint and extrinsic digital extensors and in the hindlimb , plantar flexors ( ankle extensors ) , subtalar invertors , and extrinsic digital extensors ( table 3 , figure 6 ) .
the indices calculated from bone lengths are shown in table 4 .
the high humero - femoral index indicates that the forelimb and hindlimb are similar in length , whereas the lower index in vervets reflects a shorter humerus and longer femur .
the intermembral shows a pattern similar to that of the humero - femoral index .
the brachial and crural indices indicate that the radius and tibia are somewhat longer relative to the humerus and femur , respectively , than in the vervets .
the claviculohumeral index reflects the narrow chest breadth and the closer approximation of the shoulder joints in patas .
patas hands and feet have longer carpal and tarsal regions , longer metacarpals and metatarsals , and shorter digits compared to vervets ( figure 7 ) .
4. discussion what does this comparative approach with the addition of soft tissue and body proportions reveal about the uniqueness of patas monkey locomotor anatomy and behavior ?
remarkably , even with notable differences in body mass , patas monkeys are built on the same plan as other old world monkeys .
body proportions , for example , forelimb mass ( 11 - 13 %) and hindlimb mass ( 20 - 24 %) , are not only characteristic of vervets [ 30 ] but also of macaques ( macaca fuscata and m. mulatta , [ 22 , 25 ]) , baboons ( papio cynocephalus , [ 9 ]) , and langurs ( semnopithecus entellus , [ 31 ]) , with variation among species in tail proportions .
the similar body plans reflect a shared anatomy that underpins old world monkey quadrupedal locomotion .
patas and vervet monkeys also share similar body compositions and distributions of bone and muscle mass .
hence , the addition of soft tissue data supports and adds to schultz 's general conclusions on structural uniformity of old world monkeys .
however , small differences in the patas body shape affect locomotor function .
patas limbs are aligned under the trunk to ensure movement in the parasagittal plane .
this alignment is achieved by a combination of vertically oriented scapulae against a narrow and deep chest , shoulder joints close together indicated by short clavicles , and attachment of the skin that binds the arm segment close to the trunk .
these features reduce abduction of the limbs and keep them functioning in the fore and aft plane .
limb length proportions also affect body shape .
patas locomotion depends upon a long stride and relatively efficient gait .
the relatively longer radius and carpals and metacarpals and a digitigrade hand posture lengthen the forelimb .
the slightly lengthened tibia and tarsals and metatarsals , and a digitigrade foot posture , all contribute to a longer hindlimb .
the combination of forelimb and hindlimb lengths function to increase stride .
the lighter hand and foot segments reduce the force needed during recovery phase of the stride .
the distribution of limb mass and muscle proportions affects power and mobility .
the proximal shift of muscle to the shoulder and hip joints is reflected in a somewhat greater mass of arm and thigh segments , compared to vervets .
the shorter and lighter tail in patas also keeps body and muscle mass closer to the hip joints .
proportions of muscle mass suggest greater propulsive action .
heavier elbow extensors , triceps brachii , and manual digital extensors underscore extension and deemphasize flexion during recovery phase of gait .
lighter back extensor muscles correlate with the less flexible back in patas [ 10 ] .
plantar flexors , or ankle extensors , ( gastrocnemius , soleus , and plantaris ) are five times the mass of the dorsiflexors ( tibialis anterior ) in patas compared to vervets' ratio of three .
in addition to power at the knee joint , the plantar - flexors assist in maintaining a digitigrade foot posture and along with heavier digital extensors of the toes reflect the absence of a plantigrade foot posture during walking [ 9 ]. by cine - film and radiography wood showed that the patas foot moves little when the lower limb is suspended during recovery , unlike the baboon 's foot which inverts during recovery .
patas foot invertor muscles are relatively heavy and may compensate for the bony configuration at the ankle by maintaining joint mobility for climbing .
the slender digits are straight and short , and the sole narrow with the thickest cushion of fat over the metatarsal heads [ 9 ] .
how well does patas monkey anatomy fit with the notion of convergence with cursorial mammals ?
cursors are generally defined by speed [ 32 ] , and it was the ability of patas monkeys to run fast that first called attention to this aspect of their locomotion .
features of cursorial mammals include a deep thorax to accommodate a long vertically oriented scapula , narrow shoulder breadth often with reduced or absent clavicles , long limbs relative to trunk length , long and light distal segments , digitigrade posture , and muscle mass concentrated at the shoulder and hip joints [ 22 , 32 ] ; however , animals that have these features are not necessarily cursorial [ 33 ] .
patas monkey anatomical features have shifted somewhat in this direction .
the digitigrade foot posture is perhaps the most noted .
however , the hand is also digitigrade in walking but becomes palmigrade in running [ 34 , 35 ] .
the convergence of patas with cursorial mammals is slight because of the need to retain limb joint mobility , particularly in the forelimb , which is needed for climbing , manipulation during foraging and catching insect prey , and grooming .
overall , the comparison is superficial , and what predominates is the primate heritage of patas as old world monkeys and particularly as guenons ( e.g. , [ 36 , 37 ]) .
the locomotor behavior of patas monkeys has been of interest since hall 's field study in uganda called attention to their ability to run fast , presumably to avoid predators .
later research at sites in cameroon ( e.g. , [ 38 - 40 ]) and kenya ( e.g. , [ 41 - 43 ]) provided a detailed picture of behavioral ecology of patas monkeys and comparisons with sympatric vervet monkeys .
patas monkeys have a variety of means to cope with predators in addition to running .
in the grasslands , with predators such as jackals , hyenas , lions , cheetahs , and wild dogs , patas monkeys depend upon vigilance from tall trees , giving and responding to alarm calls , crypticity , and rapid flight into the safety of woodlands ; at night when leopards hunt , patas monkeys disperse into several sleeping trees and avoid using the same trees in consecutive nights when arboreal predators are present [ 3 , 18 , 39 - 41 , 44 ] .
patas monkeys utilize grasslands and open acacia woodlands but avoid riverine woodlands , whereas vervet monkeys and baboons prefer woodlands and riverine edges [ 3 , 39 - 41 ] .
the majority of patas daily activities are spent on the ground in search of food .
field researchers emphasize the long distances patas monkeys travel on the ground and characterize their locomotion as one of continual walking rather than running [ 40 , 45 - 47 ] .
patas monkeys cannot digest fiber - rich foods of herbaceous plants as most species do that inhabit the savanna .
their grassland foods are small , highly nutritious items like grasshoppers , ants , acacia gums , and seeds which are dispersed with low density and therefore require more time to cover a wide area each day [ 42 , 47 - 50 ] .
patas groups are mobile throughout the day and forage for insects as they walk .
they stand bipedally to gnaw and scrape gum and collect ants from tree trunks and branches [ 41 ] .
their diet yields substantial amounts of energy , protein , and minerals from acacia gum and crematogaster ants [ 43 , 48 ] .
in the dry season patas monkeys can expand their range to include areas with water and therefore are not limited to where water is readily available [ 40 ] .
furthermore , patas monkeys have enhanced heat tolerance due to physiological properties of the skin .
a higher density of eccrine sweat glands on the chest and larger though less numerous glands on the lateral thigh than rhesus monkeys result in higher sweat rates , which are more efficient at dissipating heat [ 51 - 53 ] .
in summary , compared to vervet monkeys and baboons , which overlap in some areas of the patas habitat , patas monkeys have larger home ranges and longer daily travel and spend more time moving and foraging .
vervets spend less time moving , more time resting , eat less animal matter , focus more on fruits , flowers , leaves , and lipid - rich seeds .
they spend more time feeding in trees than on the ground and in the dry season are confined to readily available water sources in their immediate home range .
the way that patas monkeys live , move , and exploit resources that occur in savanna habitats is unique among african monkeys and contrasts with the behavior of the smaller vervets and the larger baboons .
5. conclusions the patas adaptation involves anatomical structures of muscle , bone , and skin devoted to the locomotor system , which together make up about 70 % of body mass .
their skin is multifunctional .
not only does the skin cover the musculoskeleton , but it mechanically restricts the forelimbs to the parasagittal plane .
physiologically it contains sweat glands that dissipate heat and contribute to heat tolerance in environments with less continual tree cover where patas monkeys travel .
efficient long distance walking is enhanced through a mosaic of musculoskeletal characters , including body shape , limb length , joint orientation and movement , and muscle function .
long legs and digitigrade foot posture are key features but so are changes in the forelimb .
their locomotor abilities underpin and support their adaptation to an unusual old world monkey ecology and allow patas to forage effectively for insects , seeds , and gums as they move widely across their range between these small packets of dispersed food and water sources .
the emphasis on patas locomotion - - or baboon or vervet locomotion - - is not just one of " terrestriality " but of utilizing life on the ground in a particular , species - specific way .
taking into account the entire animal , its structures , and their functions as they are integrated into the totality of their behavior in the environmental context provides a more complete analysis of the unique adaptation of this unusual monkey species .

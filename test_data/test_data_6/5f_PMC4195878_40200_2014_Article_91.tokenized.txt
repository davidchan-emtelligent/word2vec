keywords trabecular osteoblast osteoclast turn over osteoporosis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction osteoporosis is characterized by a reduction in bone mass and the micro - architectural deterioration of bone tissue , resulting in bone fragility and an increase in susceptibility to fracture [ 1 ] .
bone loss occurs with increasing age in females is directly linked to loss of ovarian function .
the pathophysiology of this " ovary - related ' bone loss is very complicated and cannot be simply explained by either increased bone resorption or decreased bone formation [ 2 ] .
ovariectomized rats and dogs have been used extensively in osteoporosis models [ 3 ] .
the model of bilaterally ovariectomized rats mimics the accelerated bone loss observed in postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency [ 4 ] .
ovariectomized animals suffer from accelerated bone turnover , showing stimulated osteoclastic bone resorption , and reactive osteoblastic bone formation with a net result of bone loss [ 5 ] .
atomic mineral is the smallest component of trabecular bone .
each atomic mineral was able to substitute another atomic mineral due its similarity in the atomic radius [ 6 ] .
ren et al. , [ 7 ] showed that zn substitution on hydroxyl apatite crystal was found to inhibit crystal growth due to its smaller atomic radius as compared with ca. ovariectomized rats showed significant gradual increase in serum calcium and phosphorus level [ 8 ] .
also , blood zinc and copper levels in ovariectomized rats were significantly increased compared to the sham control [ 3 ] .
change of atomic mineral composition would be modify the hydroxyapatite crystal structure .
finally , all process have involved would be determined the mesostructure of trabecular bone .
although calcium is main mineral in bone , previous study in human showed there is hypermineralization and higher calcium level in hydroxyapatite crystal structure from osteoporosis patients [ 9,10 ] .
there is no study to evaluate the effect of time course ovariectomized on tibia bone properties .
we hypothesize that there is difference of bone mineral elements , bone turn over markers , bone microstructure , and boe histomorphometry in time course of ovariectomized rats compared with control .
material and methods animal and treatments thirty adult albino female wistar rats , weighing 150 - 200 g were used in this study .
the animals were acclimatized for one week to our laboratory conditions prior to experimental manipulation and were exposed to a 12 - h light and 12 - h dark cycle at room temperature of 24degreesc .
they had free acces to standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum .
the animals were randomly assigned into three groups ( n = 10 each ) : control group , ovariectomy group follow up for one month ( ovx - 1 ) , and two month ( ovx - 2 ) .
all animals procedures was according to animal ethics guidelines and approval by ethic committee of the medical faculty , lambung mangkurat university which obtained prior the study .
surgical procedure under ketamine ( 50 mg / kg ) and xylacine ( 8 mg / kg ) anesthesia , thirty four ovx groups underwent bilateral ovariectomy by ventral incisions and eight were sham - operated ( control ) [ 11 ] .
at the end of the experiment , animals in all groups were sacrificed .
serum and bone tissues were removed .
tissue preparation at the end of the treatment , rats in all groups were anesthetized ; their blood was drawn by cardiac puncture .
both tibia were collected , weighed , and latter rinsed with physiological saline .
all samples were stored at glutaraldehyde until analyzed .
analysis of bone turn over markers the serum bone formation markers osteocalcin was measured using rat osteocalcin / bone gla protein ot / bgp elisa kits from novateinbio , inc ( cambridge , ma , usa ) .
the serum bone resorption marker c - telopeptide of type i collagen kit was purchased from novateinbio , inc ( cambridge , ma , usa ) .
analysis of bone mineral elements calcium ( ca ) , phosphorus ( p ) , iron ( fe ) , copper ( cu ) , zinc ( zn ) , nickel ( ni ) levels was evaluated by x - ray fluorescence ( xrf ) .
for xrf analysis , the tibia bones inserted in bone tube , then put in proper place in equipment .
the processed bones were then analyzed at 20 kv accelerating voltage by a xrf ( panalytical minipal 4 ) [ 12 ] .
analysis of bone hydroxyapatite crystale characterization of the x - ray diffraction results was performed by means of pananalytical x'pert pro - mpd , for ovariectomized and sham - operated rats proximal tibia .
subsequent analysis was by means of the software programs high score plus , crystal maker and ddview , complemented with the latest version of pdf2 .
diffraction spectra were recorded at an angle of 2theta , from 200 to 60o , with a cu - k alpha radiation source ( wave length = 1.54056 a , 40 ma , 40 kv ) and step size of 0.05degrees [ 13 ] .
analysis of bone mesostructure mesostructure analysis was evaluated by scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .
for sem evaluation , tibia from all groups were cut vertically from the proximal metaphysis area .
then the tibia bones were fixed with phosphate formalin buffer , dehydrated with graded concentration of ethanol and coated with gold and palladium .
the processed bones were then analyzed at 20 kv accelerating voltage by a sem ( fei inspect tm s50 ) [ 12 ] .
analysis of bone histomorphometry histomorphometric measurements were carried out according previous study with modification [ 13 ] .
measurements at distal tibia were made at 500x objective magnification using a scanning electron miscroscope ( fei inspect tm s50 ) than analyzed by an image analyzer ( bonej , usa ) .
the parameters measured in this study were trabecular bone volume , trabecular thickness , trabecular number , and trabecular separation .
trabecular bone volume ( bv / tv ) is the number of trabecular bone within the spongy space ( expressed as a percentage ) .
trabecular thickness ( tb.th , in micrometers ) was derived from trabecular perimeter ( b.pm ) and b.ar ( tb.th = 1.99 b.ar / 2 / b.pm ) .
trabecular number ( tb.n , expressed per millimeter ) and trabecular separation ( tb.sp , expressed per micrometer ) were calculated assuming that trabecular bone can be modeled by the parallel plates and bar model ( tb.n = tb.ar 10 / tb.th ; tb.sp = 1000 / tb.n - tb.th ) .
all the formula , symbols , units , and nomenclature used for bone histomorphometry were in accordance to the guidelines by the american society for bone and mineral research ( asbmr ) histomorphometry nomenclature committee [ 14 ] .

discussion bone matrix can be considered a composite material , comprised of mineral and organic phases .
the mineral phase largely accounts for the stiffness of bone [ 15 ] , whereas the organic phase , mainly constituted of type i collagen , provides bone its ductility and toughness , i.e. its ability to undergo deformation and absorb energy after it begins to yield [ 16,17 ] .
bone collagen can also undergo a series of nonenzymatic transformations including the advanced glycation end products and the isomerization of aspartic acid residues within the c - telopeptides , which have also been shown to be associated with bone mechanical properties in ex - vivo experiments [ 18 - 22 ] .
in this study the level of ctx decrease significantly in one and two months after ovariectomized compared to sham control , but not difference between ovariectomized groups .
this reduction indicated that cross linked to collagen as dominant organic molecules in bone is decreased or indicated rupture of crosslinks in the collagen fibrils [ 23 ] .
osteocalcin was a protein secreted by osteoblast as indicator of osteoblast activity .
in this study , we found a decreasing of osteocalcin as indicator of reduction of osteoblast activity to secrete protein due to low population or low activity of osteoblast .
these decreased levels of serum osteocalcin , are consistent with histological studies reporting decreased osteoblast number [ 24 ] .
after secretion of newly synthesized intact osteocalcin by osteoblastic cells , part of the molecule is secreted in the blood and part is incorporated in bone tissue , through the binding of its gamma carboxyglutamic acids to hydroxyapatite .
thus , if the fraction of newly synthesized osteocalcin captured into bone is altered - because of lattice parameter in the hydroxyapatite crystal structure - this would also influence circulating levels .
in this study we found no difference of mineral elements and mineral composition in hydroxypatite crystale structure , but the lattice parameter is changed .
this finding indicated that ovariectomized modify the arrangement of atomic mineral in in hydroxypatite crystale .
subsequently this mineral phase transformations or rearrangements modification [ 25 ] would determined bone mesostructure .
this study showed that ca , p , fe , cu , zn , ni , ca / p , and cu / zn levels in ovariectomized rats was not change significantly different compared to control rats .
previous studies showed that bone calcium and total mineral element will decreased after one month ovariectomized [ 25,26 ] .
in this study , we found contradictive with literature .
our finding indicated that mineralization is adaptive homeostatic process to compensate the effect of estrogen deficiency .
although reduced in mass , the bones are normal with respect to mineralization .
in addition , substitution of atomic mineral may also contribute to bone mineralization [ 27 ] .
mesostructure of sham - operated rats presented rod like trabecules with honey comb appearance and minimal holes .
at one month after ovariectomized procedure we found reduction of trabecular integrity , lacunae , and decreased thickening of trabecular wall .
the surface of trabecular showed granules structured .
the trabecular breaking and stump structure , which contributed to massive hole , was found in tibia bone at two month from ovariectomized procedure .
beside , the loosing of granule structure also obeserved .
we also found that trabecular volume were lower significantly on ovx - 1 and ovx - 2 groups compared with sham group ( p < 0.05 ) .
this finding indicated that ovariectomized increased the porocity of trabecular .
the changes of lattice parameter in hydroxyapatite crystale determined the porocity of trabecular bone .
in this study , the trabecular thickness and spacing were increase significantly on ovx - 1 and ovx - 2 groups compared with sham group ( p < 0.05 ) .
besides , the trabecular number were significantly decrease ovx - 1 and ovx - 2 groups than that sham group ( p < 0.05 ) .
this finding partially confirmed previous study reported that ovariectomized rats exhibit significant decreases in the thickness of the cortex and the number and size of trabecular [ 8 ] .
resorption process was also observed to be intensified in the examined trabecular bone [ 28 ] .
conclusions we found that two month after ovariectomized decrease serum osteocalcin but not change bone mineral elements in rats .
also , we found the difference of lattice parameter of hydroxyapatite crystale structure and trabecular properties which determined bone mesostructure .

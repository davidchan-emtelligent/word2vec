small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency but trichobezoar as an etiology , rarely reported .
a seven year old school going female child presented with acute intestinal obstruction with a palpable and mobile mass in the abdomen .
at exploration , a 10 cm long trichobezoar was found in the distal ileum which was removed through enterotomy .
postoperative course remained uneventful .
further probing revealed that child used to eat her own scalp hairs at the age of 2 years and the habit persisted for about 18 months which resulted in alopecia at that time .
later on she started showing normal behavior .
trichobezoar intestinal obstruction child introduction trichobezoar is a ball of swallowed hairs usually found in stomach .
it is not an uncommon condition .
it usually is limited to stomach or may have its extension into small bowel in a form of tail - the rapunzel syndrome .
presence of trichobezoar in small bowel without a trace in stomach is a rare occurrence [ 1 , 2 ] .
delayed presentation after many years of presence of trichobezoar in alimentary tract is a rare event .
we are reporting a case of delayed presentation of trichobezoar which presented with acute small bowel obstruction .
case report a seven - year - old female child presented with acute onset of colicky abdominal pain and non bilious vomiting for the preceding three days .
there was no history of fever and passage of round worms in stool .
on examination the child was alert and of normal built .
abdomen was not distended .
it was soft with a palpable elongated mobile minimally tender mass .
a provisional diagnosis of mesenteric / ovarian cyst was made .
x - ray abdomen was suggestive of mechanical obstruction .
ultrasound showed mass to be non cystic .
abdominal lymph nodes were not enlarged and other viscera were reported as normal .
at laparotomy an intraluminal mass was found in distal ileum .
it was compressible .
rest of bowel and stomach were normal .
an enterotomy was made and a large trichobezoar was removed .
it was 10 cm long ( fig. 1 ) .
the enterotomy was then closed .
figure 1 : enterotomy and removal of trichobezoar the postoperative course remained uneventful .
further probing revealed that child had habit of eating her own hairs from the age of 2 years which persisted for about 18 months .
alopecia was reported at that age .
presently she is a normal looking average built school child interested in surroundings and quite social ; but parents were concerned about her jealous behavior as to her younger sister .
child was also consulted with a psychiatrist who following a session declared that at present she has no ailment and being jealous of younger sibling is a normal phenomenon .
discussion trichobezoar is a unique rare condition predominantly of childhood and adolescence .
it is a black , glistening , foul smelling mass , made up of hairs present in the alimentary tract , commonly in stomach .
there is usually a preceding history trichotillomania ( pulling own hairs ) followed by trichophagia ( ingestion of hairs ) .
not all the cases of trichotillomania have trichophagia nor all the trichophagia develop trichobezoar .
although the exact cause of trichotillomania is not clear certain psychosocial , behavioral , and biological theories have been proposed like childhood trauma , stress and neurochemical imbalances ( like of serotonin ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
hairs are non absorbable or digestible and also due to smooth slippery texture not easily pass out of the alimentary tract .
they remain stuck in the folds of alimentary tract and usually jumbled up in stomach .
this bunch of hair can have extension in to distal bowel as a result of peristaltic propulsion .
it may get detached as satellite in distal intestine with main part in the stomach .
there are recurrent episodes of non specific pain in abdomen , loss of appetite , vomiting and weight loss .
alopecia is the most significant associated symptom in patients with this condition [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .
the patient in this report had onset of trichotillomania at a very early age ( 2 years ) which has been reported , though rarely .
contrary to the usual cases , where these children have behavioral disturbances and failure to thrive , our patient showed normal physical and mental health .
she started pulling and eating her hairs at the age of two years and left after 18months without any specific reason or change of environment , which shows that it is not always the underlying behavioral or psychological disturbance that leads to this habit .
this could be " short term habit of hair pulling " which is quite different from trichotillomania .
jealously with the other siblings is a normal phenomenon ( as the psychiatrist pointed out in our case ) [ 9 ] .
isolated intestinal trichobezoars are rare but do occur and can have delayed presentation , even after many years of leaving trichophagia .
in the index case the trichobezoar might remained in the stomach for years and then dislodged from stomach and stuck in the small bowel , therefore , presented with the acute intestinal obstruction .
it is also an interesting fact that in the stomach the trichobezoars do not produce any kind of symptoms for years .
to conclude , delayed presentation of trichobezoar is a rare event .
ileal trichobezoar should be placed in differential of mobile abdominal masses in young girls .

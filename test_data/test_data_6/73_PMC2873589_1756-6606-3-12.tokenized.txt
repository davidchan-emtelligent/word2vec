background parkinson 's disease ( pd ) is the most common movement disorder .
while neuronal deposition of alpha - synuclein serves as a pathological hallmark of pd and dementia with lewy bodies , alpha - synuclein - positive protein aggregates are also present in astrocytes .
the pathological consequence of astrocytic accumulation of alpha - synuclein , however , is unclear .
results here we show that pd - related a53t mutant alpha - synuclein , when selectively expressed in astrocytes , induced rapidly progressed paralysis in mice .
increasing accumulation of alpha - synuclein aggregates was found in presymptomatic and symptomatic mouse brains and correlated with the expansion of reactive astrogliosis .
the normal function of astrocytes was compromised as evidenced by cerebral microhemorrhage and down - regulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters , which also led to increased inflammatory responses and microglial activation .
interestingly , the activation of microglia was mainly detected in the midbrain , brainstem and spinal cord , where a significant loss of dopaminergic and motor neurons was observed .
consistent with the activation of microglia , the expression level of cyclooxygenase 1 ( cox - 1 ) was significantly up - regulated in the brain of symptomatic mice and in cultured microglia treated with conditioned medium derived from astrocytes over - expressing a53t alpha - synuclein .
consequently , the suppression of cox - 1 activities extended the survival of mutant mice , suggesting that excess inflammatory responses elicited by reactive astrocytes may contribute to the degeneration of neurons .
conclusions our findings demonstrate a critical involvement of astrocytic alpha - synuclein in initiating the non - cell autonomous killing of neurons , suggesting the viability of reactive astrocytes and microglia as potential therapeutic targets for pd and other neurodegenerative diseases .
background alpha - synuclein ( alpha - syn ) is a major component of lewy bodies ( lb ) and lewy neurites ( ln ) appearing in the postmortem brain of parkinson 's disease ( pd ) and other synucleinopathies [ 1,2 ] .
genetic mutations in alpha - syn , including point mutations ( a53t , a30p and e46k ) and multiplications have been linked to familial pd and dementia with lb [ 3 - 7 ] .
although the precise function of alpha - syn remains elusive , overwhelming evidence indicates that malfunction of alpha - syn , especially the aggregation of misfolded alpha - syn , plays an important role in the process of neurodegeneration [ 5,8 ] .
neuronal expression of either human wild - type or pd - related mutant alpha - syn induces neurodegeneration associated with pathological accumulations of alpha - syn and reactive astrogliosis [ 9 - 13 ] .
in addition , alpha - syn - containing inclusion bodies are present in oligodendrocytes of multiple system atrophy ( msa ) [ 14 ] .
transgenic mice over - expressing wild - type alpha - syn in oligodendrocytes display severe neurological alterations and neurodegeneration [ 15,16 ] .
previous studies also reveal that alpha - syn - containing inclusion bodies present in astrocytes of sporadic pd [ 17 - 19 ] and over - expression of wild - type or c - terminally truncated alpha - syn in u373 astrocytoma cells induces apoptotic death of astroglial cells [ 20 ] .
however , whether the astrocytic expression of pd - related a53t alpha - syn contributes to neurodegeneration is unknown [ 21 ] .
here we generated a new line of alpha - syn inducible transgenic mice in which the pd - related a53t alpha - syn was selectively expressed by astrocytes .
interestingly , the mutant mice developed rapidly progressed paralysis , likely resulting from widespread astrocytosis , severe microglial activation , and especially midbrain dopaminergic and spinal cord motor neuron degeneration .
these results demonstrate that alpha - syn - mediated cytotoxicity to astrocytes is critical for inducing the non - cell autonomous degeneration of neurons , suggesting that the maintenance of normal function of astrocytes is important in ameliorating the progression of neurodegeneration in pd and other neurodegenerative diseases .
results generation of human alpha - synuclein inducible transgenic mice that selectively express exogenous alpha - synuclein in astrocytes alpha - syn is most abundant in neurons [ 22 ] .
however , the expression of alpha - syn in astrocytes has not been rigorously examined .
here we prepared the astrocytic and neuronal cell cultures from postnatal day 1 pups and compared the expression of alpha - syn in these cells .
consistent with previous findings [ 22 ] , alpha - syn was highly expressed in neuronal cultures ( fig. 1a ) .
interestingly , a lower level expression of alpha - syn was consistently detected in astrocytes ( fig. 1a ) .

western blot analysis of endogenous alpha - syn expression in primary cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes .
protein extracts ( 8 mug ) from cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes were immunoblotted using antibodies against human / mouse alpha - syn ( c20 ) , beta iii - tubulin ( neuronal marker ) , and gfap ( astrocyte maker ) .

to reveal the potential contribution of astrocytic expression of alpha - syn in the pathogenesis of pd , we generated new lines of alpha - syn inducible transgenic mice that selectively expressed the human wild - type ( wt ) or pd - related a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes .
as outlined in fig. 1b , we crossbred the human glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) promoter - controlled tetracycline transactivator ( gfap - tta ) transgenic mice [ 23 ] with the tetracycline operator ( teto ) - regulated alpha - syn transgenic mice ( teto - wt or teto - a53t ) to generate the gfap - tta / teto - wt ( wt ) and gfap - tta / teto - a53t double transgenic ( a53t ) mice .
the expression of exogenous alpha - syn in the double transgenic mice was demonstrated by western blot using an antibody specifically against human alpha - syn .
we have obtained one wt and two a53t lines of transgenic mice ( fig. 1c ) .
since most of studies focused on the a53t - e2 line , we refer this line as a53t mice in later description .
the a53t transgenic mice displayed significant elevation of alpha - syn expression throughout the cns , including olfactory bulb , cerebral cortex , striatum , midbrain , hippocampus , cerebellum , brainstem and spinal cord ( fig. 1d ) .
using an alpha - syn antibody that recognizes both mouse and human alpha - syn , western blot analysis revealed about 10 - fold increase of alpha - syn expression in the brain of a53t mice as compared to non - transgenic ( ntg ) littermate controls ( see additional file 1a ) .
moreover , at the cellular level , the expression of a53t alpha - syn was restricted to gfap - positive astrocytes as demonstrated by co - staining of human alpha - syn with gfap but not other cell type markers in the brain sections of a53t mice ( figs. 1e - h ; additional file 1b - d ) .
the a53t transgenic mice developed an early onset rapidly progressed movement disability to investigate whether over - expression of a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes caused any behavioral abnormalities , we monitored the body weight and examined the spontaneous locomotor activities and motor coordination of a53t mice .
the a53t mice were viable but appeared smaller and weighted significantly less compared to age - matched ntg , as well as gfap - tta and teto - a53t single transgenic mice at one and two months of age ( see additional file 2a - b ) .
the spontaneous locomotor activities of a53t mice measured by the open - field test were progressively declined from one month to two months of age compared to control mice ( fig. 2a ; additional file 2c - d ) .
the grip strength of a53t mice was also significantly reduced in both fore and hind limbs at two months of age ( fig. 2b ) .
the motor coordination of two - month old a53t mice seemed , however , not affected in the rotarod test ( see additional file 2e ) .
after two and a half months of age , the progression of movement disability of a53t mice was greatly accelerated .
one of the four limbs paralyzed with the average age of onset at 71.6 +/ - 2.0 days ( fig. 2c , additional files 3 , additional file 4 ) .
the paralysis quickly spread to the remaining limbs , and the affected mice experienced difficulties in eating and drinking after showing paralysis in two or more limbs .
as a result , the body weight of symptomatic mice continued to drop during the disease progression ( see additional file 2f ) , and eventually , the animals died with the average lifespan at 90.4 +/ - 2.9 days ( fig. 2d , additional file 5 ) .
the penetrance of paralysis was 100 % in a53t mice .

the average age of onset was 71.6 +/ - 2.0 days .
( d ) line graph depicts the survival rate of a53t mice ( n = 7 ) .
the average lifespan of the a53t mice was 90.4 +/ - 2.9 days .
previous studies also indicated that gfap is expressed in neuronal precursor cells during development [ 24,25 ] .
to assess the impact of developmental expression of a53t alpha - syn on the neurological dysfunction , a cohort of a53t mice were administered with doxycycline ( dox ) , a tetracycline derivative , to block the expression of a53t alpha - syn from embryonic stages to postnatal day 21 ( p21 ) .
the dox - exposed a53t mice behaved normally at one and two months of age ( see additional file 6 ) .
however , two months after removal of dox , 43 % of these mice started to lose body weight and displayed less spontaneous locomotor activities ( see additional file 6 ) .
all of these dox - treated a53t mice eventually progressed to complete paralysis with an average age of onset at 102.1 +/ - 2.8 days and average lifespan at 110.0 +/ - 3.8 days .
these data suggest that the paralysis developed by a53t mice is not dependent on the developmental expression of a53t alpha - syn .
astrocytic expression of a53t alpha - synuclein induced widespread astrogliosis to reveal the cause of neurological dysfunction , we checked whether a53t alpha - syn affected astrocytes in the brain .
brain sections of both asymptomatic ( a53t 1m ) and symptomatic mice ( a53t *) were examined for gfap staining ( fig. 3 ) .
the number of gfap - positive astrocytes was dramatically increased in the gray matter of cerebral cortex ( figs. 3b - c ) , striatum ( figs. 3b - c ) , brainstem ( figs. 3e - f ) , spinal cord ( figs. 3h - i ) , midbrain ( figs. 3k - l ) , and other brain areas of a53t mice as compared to age - matched ntg mice ( figs. 3a , d , g and 3j ) .
the increase of gfap expression was also confirmed by quantitative rt - pcr and western blot analyses in which the level of gfap expression was further elevated in the symptomatic mice ( see additional file 7 ) .
moreover , the soma size of gfap - positive astrocytes was also significantly increased in the brainstem , spinal cord , and midbrain of symptomatic a53t mice ( ntg , 27.8 +/ - 5.7 mum2 ; a53t * , 132.0 +/ - 34.9 mum2 ; p = 0.0051 ) ( figs. 3a ' - c ' , d ' - f ' , g ' - i ' and 3j ' - l ') .
taken together , these results demonstrate that exogenous expression of human a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes induced severe astrogliosis in mice .

astrocytic expression of a53t alpha - synuclein disrupted the normal function of astrocytes astrocyte plays an important role in maintenance the homeostasis of extracellular environment of neurons [ 26 ] .
the processes of astrocyte end - feet encircle the endothelial cell of blood vessels for maintenance of blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) and withdrawal of nutrients from the blood [ 27,28 ] .
the astrocyte - endothelial cell interaction plays a major role in regulating brain water and electrolyte metabolism under both normal and pathological conditions [ 27 ] .
in search for the signs of bbb damage in the brain of symptomatic a53t mice , we examined the expression and subcellular distribution of aquaporin 4 , glucose transporter 1 ( glut1 ) and von willebrand factor ( vwf ) in astrocyte and vascular endothelial cells .
as shown in the brainstem of ntg mice , aquaporin 4 was normally confined to the end - foot of astrocytes that outlined the blood vessels in the brain ( figs. 4a , c and 4e ) .
in the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic a53t mice ; however , aquaporin 4 was redistributed to the soma and proximal processes of astrocytes ( figs. 4b , d and 4f ) .
the redistribution of aquaporin 4 to the soma of astrocyte has been shown before to impair the shielding of end - foot around blood vessels [ 29 ] .
in addition , abnormal accumulation of glut1 and vwf in the vascular endothelial cell was observed at the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic a53t mice ( figs. 4g - j ) , indicating the dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells .
together these data indicate that astrocytic expression a53t alpha - syn may cause damage to bbb .
in support of this notion , focal deposition of immunoglobulin ( ig ) g was observed in the brainstem of a53t symptomatic mice ( fig. 4l ) .
moreover , prussian blue staining from symptomatic mice identified deposits of hemosiderin , a hemoglobin derivative , in the brainstem ( fig. 4n ) , suggesting the occurrence of microhemorrhage in these mice .

astrocytes also express excitatory amino acid transporters , which are responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the brain and its dysfunction has been associated with multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders [ 30 ] .
here we found that the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and 2 ( glast , glt1 ) was significantly decreased in asymptomatic and symptomatic a53t mice ( figs. 4o - p ) , indicating that excitotoxicity may occur in a53t mice .
astrocytic expression of a53t alpha - synuclein induced activation of microglia in the cns astrocytes are active players in cerebral innate immunity [ 31 ] .
to investigate whether reactive astrocyte in symptomatic a53t mice triggered inflammatory response , we examined whether microglia , the immune defense cell in the cns , were activated .
progressive activation of microglia was observed in the brain of a53t mice ( figs. 5a - c ) as evidenced by enlarged soma and by the appearance of microglia clusters ( figs. 5a - c ) .
clusters of activated microglia with large , amoeboid shape and fewer branches were spotted firstly in the peduncle of cerebellum at asymptomatic stage , and later in the brainstem ( figs. 5b and 5d - e ) and midbrain ( figs. 5c and 5d - e ) at symptomatic stage .
although astrocytosis was observed in the forebrain regions ( fig. 3 ) , interestingly , no obvious activation of microglia was observed in the cortical areas ( figs. 5a and 5d - e ) .
consistent with the morphology change of the microglia , the expression of iba1 was dramatically up - regulated in the a53t mice as evidenced by quantitative rt - pcr and western blot analysis ( see additional file 7 ) .
more interestingly , clusters of activated microglia were found adjacent to spinal motor neurons and dopaminergic neurons in substantial nigra pars compacta ( snpc ) ( see additional file 8 ) .
these data indicate that activated microglia may attack neurons in the spinal cord and snpc and lead to neurodegeneration .

astrocytic expression of a53t alpha - synuclein caused neurodegeneration to examine whether neuronal loss occurred in the brain of symptomatic a53t mice , unbiased stereological analysis was employed to estimate the remained neurons in the cortex , striatum , snpc , and spinal cord .
while the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) - positive dopaminergic neurons in snpc and ventral tegmental area ( vta ) were not altered in the a53t mice at 1 month of age ( see additional file 9 ) , they were decreased by 60.5 % in snpc and by 26.1 % in vta of symptomatic a53t mice as compared with age - matched ntg littermates ( figs. 6a , c ) .
similarly , the numbers of motor neurons were significantly reduced in both cervical and lumber spinal cord of symptomatic a53t mice compared to control mice ( figs. 6b , d ) .
in contrast , the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex and striatum area symptomatic a53t mice remained unchanged ( see additional file 9 ) .
taken together , significant neuronal loss was detected in the midbrain and spinal cord of a53t symptomatic mice , which may underlie the movement disability developed in these animals .
in addition , the close correlation of regional distribution between the occurrence of neurodegeneration and microglial activation indicate that activated microglia may play an important role in triggering the loss of neuron .

microglia - mediated inflammatory responses were involved in the neurodegeneration of a53t mice increasing studies demonstrate the involvement of inflammation in the degeneration of neurons [ 32 ] .
since inflammation is often in accompany with increased expression of cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , interleukin - 1beta ( il - 1beta ) , and interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , we quantified the expression of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 in the cortex and brainstem of a53t mice at both presymptomatic and symptomatic stages .
at the presymptomatic stage when little activated microglia were observed , there was no significant alteration of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 expression in the cerebral cortex and brainstem of a53t mice ( figs. 7a - c ). by contrast , at the symptomatic stage , a dramatic increase of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 expression was observed in the brainstem but not in the cerebral cortex of a53t mice ( figs. 7a - c ) , which is closely correlated with the presence of activated microglia ( figure 5 ) .
these results indicate that the increase production of cytokines is mainly from activated microglia .
consistently , the expression level of cyclooxygenase - 1 ( cox - 1 ) , which expression is restricted to microglia , was also up - regulated in the brainstem of symptomatic a53t mice ; while the expression level of neuron - enriched cox - 2 was not affected ( figs. 7d - e ) .

to further demonstrate the origin of cytokines from activated microglia , we compared the expression of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 in primary cultured astrocytes from the brainstem of symptomatic a53t mice and age - matched littermate controls .
no significant increase of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 expression was observed in cultured astrocytes from a53t mouse brainstem compared to control cultures ( fig. 7g ) , indicating a limited contribution of astrocytes in the direct production of cytokines .
in contrast , the expression level of il - 1beta and cox - 1 was significantly up - regulated in cultured microglia treated with conditioned medium derived from cultured astrocytes of a53t mouse brainstem ( fig. 7h ) .
these results indicate that substances released from a53t alpha - syn - expressing astrocytes may induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines from microglia .
cox - 1 is the key and rate - limiting enzyme in conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins ( pgs ) and plays an important role in the neuroinflammatory process [ 33 ] .
to evaluate the contribution of cox - 1 activity in the progression of paralysis in a53t mice , we treated presymptomatic 2 - month old a53t mice with sc - 560 ( 30 mg / kg , i.p. ) , a selective inhibitor of cox - 1 [ 34 ] once a day for 7 days .
compared to that of vehicle - treated mice , the lifespan of sc - 560 - treated a53t mice was significantly extended ( fig. 7f , p = 0.035 ) , suggesting that microglia - mediated inflammatory responses directly contribute to the neurodegeneration in a53t mice .
the accumulation of aggregated and truncated forms of alpha - synuclein in a53t mice the aggregated or truncated forms of alpha - syn has been indicated in initiating the downstream pathogenic events of neurodegeneration [ 35 ] .
we decided to examine the correlation between each form of alpha - syn and the progression of paralysis in a53t mice .
we first checked the presence of alpha - syn aggregates in the brain , which appeared as alpha - syn - positive high molecular weight bands in western blot analysis and resistant to triton - x100 ( tx ) extraction in tissue fractionation studies .
the aggregation of alpha - syn was significantly increased in the brain of symptomatic a53t mice compared with ntg controls and asymptomatic mice ( fig. 8a ) .
moreover , in agreement with the above neuropathological studies , the ratios of tx - insoluble alpha - syn were significantly higher in the brainstem as compared to the cerebral cortex of a53t mice ( figs. 8b - e ) .
a similar phenomenon was also observed for truncated form of alpha - syn , which was selectively up - regulated in the brainstem of symptomatic a53t mice ( figs. 8f - g ) .
taken together , these data suggest that the aggregated and truncated forms of alpha - syn may impair the normal function of astrocytes and initiate the downstream pathogenic cascades leading to the loss of neurons in a53t mice .

discussion although alpha - syn is less abundant in glial cells [ 36 ] , alpha - syn - containing inclusion bodies are present in astrocytes of postmortem pd brains [ 17 - 19 ]. by using a " tet - off " inducible transgenic approach , we selectively expressed pd - related a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes to investigate the pathological consequence of astrocytic expression and aggregation of alpha - syn in vivo .
we show here that the presence of excess a53t alpha - syn in astrocyte caused severe astrogliosis , which disrupted the normal function of astrocytes critical for maintaining the integrity of blood - brain barrier and homeostasis of extracellular glutamate .
the a53t alpha - syn induced astrogliosis also led to inflammation and microglial activation , particularly in the midbrain , brainstem and spinal cord .
we further revealed a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and motor neurons in the spinal cord of symptomatic mice , which may underlie the paralysis phenotypes developed by these mutant mice .
in addition , cox - 1 - mediated inflammatory pathways may contribute to the neurodegeneration as evidenced by the beneficial effect of cox - 1 inhibitor in extending the lifespan of a53t mice .
finally , the more severe pathological abnormalities shown in the brainstem of a53t mice were correlated with the more abundant accumulation of aggregated as well as truncated forms of alpha - syn in this region .
together , our findings demonstrate that astrocytic expression of pd - related a53t alpha - synuclein causes non - cell autonomous killing of neurons implicated in pd and motor neuron diseases , suggesting that reactive astrocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of these movement disorders .
it is rather surprising to find that over - expression of a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes induced more robust loss of midbrain dopaminergic neuron than other published a53t alpha - syn transgenic mice in which the expression of mutant alpha - syn is under the control of neuronal promoters [ 10,12,37,38 ] .
astrocytes may have to keep a lower level expression of alpha - syn for their normal functions .
therefore , over - expression of alpha - syn in astrocytes may cause more severe phenotypes compared to that in neurons .
it is also possible that astrocyte is less able to detoxify the excess alpha - syn because of its lower level of cathepsin d which is recently proved to effectively degrade alpha - syn [ 39 - 41 ] .
to address the importance of expression level of exogenous a53t alpha - syn in astrocytes in determining the onset of behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes in a53t mice , we also examined the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes of a53t - a8 mice ( the low expression line ) .
compared to the early onset paralysis exhibited in a53t - e2 mice ( the high expression line ) , no obvious behavior abnormalities were observed in a53t - a8 mice up to 12 months of age ( data now shown ) .
however , astrogliosis and modest microglial activation were detected in the brainstem and snpc area of a53t - a8 mice at 12 months of age ( see additional file 10 ) .
the milder phenotypes of a53t - a8 mice clearly indicate that the expression level of exogenous alpha - syn determines the onset and severity of observed behavioral and pathological abnormalities in these mutant mice .
this observation is also consistent with the earlier genetic studies that multiplications of alpha - syn gene in patients cause early - onset familial pd [ 3,4 ] .
astrocytic expression of a53t alpha - syn appears to affect multiple functions of astrocytes , resulting in decreased glutamate transporter expression , and disruption of brain - blood barrier .
astrogliosis happened throughout the brain and spinal cord at both asymptomatic and symptomatic stages .
however , the activation of microglia was relatively confined to the midbrain , brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic mice .
it remains to determine why microglia responds differently to the dysfunction of astrocytes in different regions of the brain .
alternatively , under the stress of excess a53t alpha - syn , astrocytes may react differently in the brainstem compared to the cerebral cortex .
in line with this notion , more aggregated and truncated forms of alpha - syn were detected in the brainstem than in the cortex .
astrocytes in the brainstem are perhaps less capable to remove the toxic alpha - syn species from the cells and are thereby more vulnerable to alpha - syn - mediated cytotoxicity , which may generate greater damage to surrounding cells , including enhanced activation of microglia and loss of neurons .
the degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and spinal motor neurons may account for the paralysis of symptomatic a53t mice .
although the precise molecular mechanism of this rather selective loss of dopaminergic and motor neurons remains to be elucidated , it is possible that the survival of these neurons is more dependent on the normal function of astrocytes than other types of neurons .
for instance , both midbrain dopaminergic neurons and motor neurons are preferentially vulnerable to the dysfunction of glutamate transporters [ 42 ] , which were also down - regulated in our a53t mice .
interestingly , microglial activation was mainly detected in regions where neurodegeneration happened in a53t mice .
the activated microglia is known to promote neurodegeneration by producing proinflammatory or potentially neurotoxic effectors , including il - 1beta , no , or reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 43 - 45 ] .
microglia presents the most highest density in snpc [ 46 ] .
thus the loss of snpc dopaminergic neurons in a53t mice may attribute to the activation of nearby microglia .
this hypothesis is in line with recent reports that lipopolysaccharide , an activator of microglia , causes snpc dopaminergic neuron degeneration in vivo [ 47 - 49 ] .
nonetheless , it will be interesting to determine which factor is more important in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a53t mice .
our findings firmly support the non - cell autonomous toxicity which is well documented in neurodegenerative disease including pd , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , huntington 's disease ( hd ) and alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) [ 50 ] .
alpha - syn expression in oligodendrocytes causes neuronal degeneration [ 16 ] , while astrocytes expressing mutant cu / zn superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) drive disease progression [ 51 ] .
recent study shows that mutant huntingtin in glial cells induces hd neurological symptoms even when it is not overexpressed [ 52 ] , strongly indicating the critical role of mutant huntingtin in glial cells .
given the non - cell autonomous toxicity caused by glial cells in neurodegenerative disease , glial cells in particular reactive astrocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of these movement disorders conclusions our studies from this new line of a53t alpha - syn transgenic mice not only provide strong evidences for the critical involvement of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of pd and motor neuron diseases , but also provide a very useful in vivo system to test novel therapeutics for preventing the loss of dopaminergic and motor neurons .
methods mice to generate human a53t alpha - synuclein ( alpha - syn ) inducible transgenic mice , a dna fragment containing human wild - type ( wt ) or a53t alpha - syn coding sequence was inserted into a tetracycline operator - regulated gene expression vector ( tet - o ) to generate the wt or a53t inducible expression construct .
the insert was then purified and microinjected into fertilized oocytes derived from c57bl6 / j mice .
one wt and two a53t founders were obtained , which were used to cross with gfap - tta mice [ 23 ] to generate gfap - tta / teto - alpha - syn double transgenic mice .
the mice were housed in a pathogen - free climate - controlled facility with ad libitum access to regular diet and water .

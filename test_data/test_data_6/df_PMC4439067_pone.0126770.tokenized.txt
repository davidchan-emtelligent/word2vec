objective china has implemented a free - service policy for tuberculosis .
however , patients still have to pay a substantial proportion of their annual income for treatment of this disease .
this study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis ; identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models ; and provides policy recommendation for tuberculosis control reform in china .
methods there are three tuberculosis management models in china : the tuberculosis dispensary model , specialist model and integrated model .
we selected zhangjiagang ( zjg ) and taixing ( tx ) as the study sites , which correspond to areas implementing the integrated model and dispensary model , respectively .
patients diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis since january 2010 were recruited as study subjects .
a total of 590 patients ( 316 patients from zjg and 274 patients from tx ) were interviewed with a response rate of 81 % .
the economic burden attributed to tuberculosis , including direct costs and indirect costs , was estimated and compared between the two study sites .
the mann - whitney u test was used to compare the cost differences between the two groups .
potential factors related to the total out - of - pocket costs were analyzed based on a step - by - step multivariate linear regression model after the logarithmic transformation of the costs .
results the average ( median , interquartile range ) total cost was 18793.33 ( 9965 , 3200 - 24400 ) cny for patients in zjg , which was significantly higher than for patients in tx ( mean : 6598.33 , median : 2263 , interquartile range : 983 - 6688 ) ( z = 10.42 , p < 0.001 ) .
after excluding expenses covered by health insurance , the average out - of - pocket costs were 14304.4 cny in zjg and 5639.2 cny in tx. based on the multivariable linear regression analysis , factors related to the total out - of - pocket costs were study site , age , number of clinical visits , residence , diagnosis delay , hospitalization , intake of liver protective drugs and use of the second - line drugs .
conclusion under the current " free of diagnosis and treatment " policy , the financial burden remains heavy on tuberculosis patients .
policy makers need to consider appropriate steps to lessen the burden of out - of - pocket costs for tuberculosis patients in china and how best to improve service delivery for poor patients .

introduction tuberculosis ( tb ) is a global health problem and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries [ 1 ] .
china has the world 's second largest tuberculosis epidemic , accounting for 12 % of the total number of cases .
in 2012 , there were 1 million new cases and 44000 tuberculosis - related deaths in china [ 1 ] .
the rising multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) tuberculosis is increasing an already heavy burden on china 's health system [ 2 , 3 ] .
tuberculosis has been regarded as a " poverty - related disease " due to the association with poverty and malnutrition , which are more prevalent in developing countries .
for example , in south africa , tuberculosis is referred to as a " barometer of poverty " [ 4 ] .
tuberculosis - affected patients and their family members face many economic and social problems , such as high medical costs , loss of productivity , stigmatization and social isolation [ 5 , 6 ] .
in 1992 , china initiated its modern national tuberculosis control program ( ntp ) with directly observed treatment , short - course ( dots ) [ 7 ] .
recently , especially after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 , the chinese government has taken a series of measures to strengthen its public health system with great efforts towards tuberculosis control. by 2005 , china achieved the global targets for tuberculosis control with 100 % dots coverage and over 90 % treatment success [ 8 ] .
each year in china , more than 1 million tuberculosis patients receive dots therapy [ 9 ] .
to reduce the financial barriers to and burdens on patients seeking essential healthcare , a " free - tb service policy " has been implemented gradually throughout the country [ 10 , 11 ] .
under this policy , tuberculosis suspects are provided a free diagnosis and anti - tuberculosis treatment , including a free chest x - ray examination , sputum smear test and designated first - line anti - tuberculosis drugs [ 12 ] .
initially , the free - service policy was only performed for sputum smear - positive patients .
now it has expanded to sputum smear - negative patients .
moreover , the government has taken more measures to reduce the patient burden , including the establishment of universal health coverage and increasing the reimbursement rate for patients with tuberculosis [ 13 ] .
the central government 's spending on tuberculosis control increased from 40 million chinese yuan ( cny ) in 2001 to 580 million cny in 2010 [ 14 ] .
china has established universal health coverage for 830 million rural residents through the rapid expansion of the new cooperative medical scheme ( ncms ) .
moreover , a free - service policy has been gradually adopted in order to lighten the economic burden of patients with tuberculosis .
despite these policy changes , previous studies have revealed that patients still bear a high financial burden , which could affect their health care - seeking behaviors and treatment outcomes [ 10 , 15 - 18 ] .
the revenue - driven practices in some health facilities , such as over - prescription of medication , poor referral and high hospitalization rates not only influence a patient 's economic burden but also affects the entire tuberculosis control program [ 19 , 20 ] .
there are three common types of tuberculosis management models in china : the tuberculosis dispensary model , specialist model and integrated model [ 21 ] .
for the dispensary model , patients are diagnosed and treated in tuberculosis dispensaries , which are usually affiliated with local cdc ( center for disease control and prevention ) .
the specialist model is similar to the dispensary model , but a specialized hospital is also responsible for treating the patients .
for the integrated model , tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment is integrated into a general hospital which is referred to as a " designated hospital " [ 22 ] .
this study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis , identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models , and provides a policy recommendation for the tuberculosis control system in china .
subjects and methods ethical consideration the institutional review board ( irb ) of nanjing medical university approved the study .
written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants .
ethical practices were used throughout the study period .
study design and settings a descriptive study was performed in two counties of jiangsu province , china .
one county , zhangjiagang ( zjg ) , is located in the southern part of jiangsu , which is a relatively rich area and ranked as the third most developed county of china in 2013 .
another county , taixing ( tx ) , is located in the middle of jiangsu , which is a moderately developed county .
in 2010 , the per capita gdp was 129535 chinese yuan ( cny ) in zjg and 36994 cny in tx ( http :// www.jssb.gov.cn /) .
in the same year , the per capita gdp was 30567 cny in china ( http :// www.stats.gov.cn / tjsj / ndsj /) .
zjg adopted the integrated model , and the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis are provided by the designated county - level general hospital .
tx implemented the dispensary model , and tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated at the local cdc ( tuberculosis dispensary ) .
in zjg , the free service covered the first - line anti - tuberculosis drugs , four liver function tests , three chest x - ray examinations and all sputum smear microscopy tests .
moreover , each patient could receive a reimbursement of 150 cny for liver protection drugs and each migrant patient with tuberculosis could receive an additional subsidy of 120 cny .
in tx , the free service policy covered the first - line anti - tuberculosis drugs , two liver function tests , one chest x - ray examination and all sputum smear microscopy tests .
hospitalization and second - line anti - tuberculosis drugs were not free of charge in either area .
baseline characteristics of the two study settings were listed in table 1 .

three hundred and forty patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis since january 2010 were recruited for the investigation .
the patients had already completed the standard anti - tuberculosis treatment prior to march 2013 .
in tx , we randomly selected 34 villages as study sites .
three hundred and ninety patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis since january 2010 were enrolled .
patients with mdr - tb were excluded from the study .
due to the gradually evolving tuberculosis management models in tx since 2012 , the recruited patients were limited to those who had finished anti - tuberculosis treatment prior to 2012 .
a total of 590 patients ( 316 patients from zjg and 274 patients from tx ) were successfully interviewed and involved in the analysis with a response rate of 81 % .
data collection with the patients' informed consent , trained investigators interviewed them at their homes using a structured questionnaire to gather information , including demographic characteristics , socioeconomic status , health insurance , health care - seeking history and costs related to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment .
estimation of economic burden the economic burden of the patients with tuberculosis consisted of direct and indirect costs .
the direct costs were medical costs related to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment ( including outpatient and inpatient expenses ) , transportation , accommodation and food [ 23 , 24 ] .
the indirect costs were calculated as a loss of income due to an inability to work due to the disease .
we examined the loss of income ( or decreased earning ability ) for both patients of the labor force and their caregivers [ 23 ] .
the total out - of - pocket costs were calculated by excluding reimbursement through medical insurance .
the out - of - pocket direct costs were direct costs calculated by excluding reimbursement through medical insurance .
the costs are expressed in the chinese yuan ( cny ) .
in 2014 , 1 cny was equal to 0.16 usd .
in order to calculate the costs for outpatient visits to the doctor , the number and costs of the visits made for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment were obtained from the patients and their family members .
if the patients could not remember the costs of the doctor 's visits , medical records and invoices were checked .
the hospitalization cost of the patients was computed based on the cost that they paid when being discharged from the hospital .
non - medical , direct costs included transportation ; commuting and food costs ( of patients and their families ) during their visit to health facilities ; the cost of purchasing extra health products that were required due to the tuberculosis ; the cost of residing in other cities for treatment and nursing patients at home .
indirect costs depended on daily income ; the number of sick leaves ; the average daily income of each patient 's companion ; and the duration of absence from work resulting from nursing and caring for the patient .
the individuals' wages were used to calculate lost income .
for patients who were not willing to declare their income and also for housekeepers , the local average daily wage was used .
data analysis we used epidata 3.1 ( http :// epidata.dk ) software to input data with double entry for consistency .
statistical analyses was performed using stata 12.0 software ( college station , texas , usa ) .
considering the distribution of costs , we used the mean and median ( interquartile range , iqr ) to describe a patient 's economic burden .
the mann - whitney u test was used to compare the cost difference between the two groups .
the cost was logarithmically transformed as the dependent variable , and a multivariate linear regression model was performed to analyze potential factors related to the out - of - pocket costs of patients with tuberculosis .
we included product terms in our model to individually account for each possible two - way interaction , considering as statistically significant those interactions with a p - value < 0.05 .
results general information this study recruited 590 tuberculosis patients , including 425 men ( 72.0 %) and 165 women ( 28.0 %) .
among them , 316 ( 53.6 %) resided in zjg , and 274 ( 46.4 %) resided in tx. in zjg , there were many young , migrant patients with tuberculosis , and fewer patients had a treatment history .
the proportion of hospitalized patients and patients taking liver protective drugs were also higher in zjg than tx ( table 2 ) .

discussion tuberculosis has historically been endemic in china , primarily due to limited health resources and government neglect [ 14 ] .
in recent years , the political commitment to public health has significantly increased [ 25 ] .
china is moving towards primary health care based on community services [ 14 ] .
for example , the government pays sustainable funds per person for the prevention of disease , and some funds are allotted to tuberculosis control .
financial concern is the most important factor guiding health care seeking behavior among the chinese population [ 26 - 28 ] .
however , as demonstrated in the current study and previous reports [ 10 , 13 , 16 , 20 ] , most of the patients have complained about paying a major part of the treatment cost through out of pocket payments .
to modify the current tuberculosis control strategies , policy makers must identify the factors related to patient economic burden .
in this study , we selected two counties from the jiangsu province using different tuberculosis management models .
zjg adopted the integrated model .
one advantage of this model is that it can shorten the delay time of diagnosis and treatment [ 22 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated that multiple clinical visits and a delay of diagnosis can increase the financial burden on patients and influence the successful control of tuberculosis [ 29 ] .
patient delay also occurs due to a lack of knowledge or negligence in seeking health care services until their symptoms deteriorate [ 30 - 32 ] .
the inability of doctors to diagnose tuberculosis during the patient 's early visits leads to an institutional delay [ 15 ] .
suspected patients are usually provided symptomatic treatment resulting in increased expenses .
the who recommends outpatient treatment for non - complicated tuberculosis patients .
however , unnecessary hospitalization has been reported , which not only leads to higher inpatient expense , but also results in extra costs related to accommodation and transportation .
the integrated tuberculosis management model may increase the hospitalization rate of suspected patients in the designated hospital .
a study demonstrated that in tuberculosis patients without concomitant disorders , the initiation of treatment at a hospital adversely influenced the outcome of treatment , as reflected by the percentage of completers [ 33 ] .
however , for patients with complicated or severe symptoms , hospitalization can be advantageous .
the intake of liver protective drugs and second - line anti - tuberculosis drugs were two common factors influencing a patient 's economic burden .
one of the most adverse reactions caused by anti - tuberculosis drugs is drug - induced liver damage .
to avoid this reaction , clinical doctors in china usually prescribe protective drugs .
these drugs include herbals , manufactured herbal products , and combinations of vitamins and other non - herbal substances ( although their preventive effects have not been proven ) [ 34 , 35 ] .
liver - protecting drugs are not free .
over - prescription of these medications also increases the patients' out - of - pocket costs [ 10 ] .
currently , in many settings in china , the prescription of second - line drugs primarily depends on the treatment history of the patients rather than the drug susceptibility test .
as reported in one cross - sectional study conducted in five provinces within china , approximately 23.8 % of the patients had a history of taking second - line drugs [ 36 ] .
even worse , there was no significant association between the prescription of second - line drugs and the drug resistant statuses of the patients .
abuse of second - line drugs merely based on clinical judgments not only increases the risk of mdr - tb and xdr - tb but also results in extra economic burden on the patients [ 17 ] .
in addition to the medical costs due to the disease , the loss of working time experienced by patients and their family members should not be ignored .
a dutch study demonstrated that patients lose ( on average ) 2.7 months ( 81 days ) of productive days due to tuberculosis [ 37 ] .
in developed areas , the indirect costs would be much higher .
for example , in our study , patients in zjg had nearly four times higher indirect costs compared with patients in tx , which might be attributed to a higher level of economic development and per capita income in zjg .
besides the common factors related to the total out - of - pocket costs in zjg and tx , the univariate analysis revealed that age , treatment history , adverse drug reactions and number of clinical visits were significant factors in tx but not in zgj .
these particular factors may play different roles in a patient 's economic burden in different areas .
for example , a significant interaction was found between the clinical visits and study setting .
the number of clinical visits was more important in tx as compared with zjg .
also , the relatively small sample size in zjg may reduce the statistical power , resulting in nonsignificant findings .
some limitations existed in this study .
first , we selected zjg and tx as the study sites representing areas using the integrated model and tb dispensary model .
however , the socio - economic status and local health system may also influence a patient 's direct and indirect costs .
the cost differences between these two areas could not be completely attributed to the disparity of tuberculosis management models .
second , although we estimated the expenses by interviewing patients and their family members and checking medical records , recall bias should not be neglected .
third , the mean costs may not be reflective of the median .
considering the non - normal distribution of the costs , we used the mean and median ( interquartile range , 25 % - 75 %) to describe a patient 's economic burden .
we also applied a non - parametric test to compare the cost differences between groups .
a logarithmic transformation was performed to normalize the distribution when we performed a step - by - step multivariate linear regression analysis .
in this study , we revealed several common and specific factors affecting the economic burden of patients' with tuberculosis .
health policy makers should consider these factors by enhancing financial support , strengthening health facilities and involving human resources to achieve success in tuberculosis control .
tuberculosis control in china is a long - term , public health challenge and needs the support of affordable and sustainable health resources .
community health resources within a strengthened health system might be the best approach [ 38 ] .
evidence - based measures to improve healthcare - seeking behavior , reduce patient and detection delays , address financial and system barriers , improve the quality of direct observed therapy and increase the access to health promotion are urgently needed [ 39 ] .
policy makers need to further document their challenges when implementing tuberculosis management models [ 21 ] .
conclusion under the current " free diagnosis and treatment " policy , the financial burden remains heavy on tuberculosis patients .
policy makers need to consider appropriate steps to lessen the burden of out - of - pocket costs for tuberculosis patients in china and how best to improve service delivery for poor patients .

the chlamydiaceae are widespread pathogens of both humans and animals .
chlamydia trachomatis infection causes blinding trachoma and reproductive complications in humans .
chlamydia pneumoniae causes human respiratory tract infections and atypical pneumonia .
chlamydia suis infection is associated with conjunctivitis , diarrhea , and failure to gain weight in domestic swine .
chlamydial infections in humans and domesticated animals are generally controlled by antibiotic treatment - - particularly macrolides ( usually azithromycin ) and tetracyclines ( tetracycline and doxycycline ) .
tetracycline - containing feed has also been used to limit infections and promote growth in livestock populations , although its use has decreased because of growing concerns about antimicrobial resistance development .
because sandoz and rockey published an elegant review of chlamydial anti - microbial resistance in 2010 , we will review the following : ( i ) antibiotic resistance in c. suis , ( ii ) recent evidence for acquired resistance in human chlamydial infections , and ( iii ) recent non - genetic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that may contribute to treatment failure .
keywords chlamydia trachomatis chlamydia muridarum chlamydia suis treatment failure tetracycline resistance gastrointestinal infection nih / niaidr01al095637nih / ncrr1c06 rr030651swiss national fund310030 - 147026issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer international publishing ag 2016 introduction the chlamydiaceae are gram - negative , obligate intracellular bacteria with a complex developmental cycle .
after the infectious elementary body ( eb ) enters a host cell , eb - containing endosomes fuse to form a membrane - bound , cytoplasmic inclusion .
within the inclusion , eb develop into larger , non - infectious reticulate bodies ( rb ) .
rb use host cell metabolites to grow , and divide .
after 30 - 70 h , rb mature into infectious eb , which are released from the infected host cell .
under adverse environmental conditions , developing chlamydiae may enter a state referred to as persistence or , more recently , as chlamydial stress or the aberrant rb phenotype [ 1 ] .
stressed chlamydiae remain viable , but do not develop into eb and are non - infectious .
they have a characteristic appearance and are termed aberrant rb / aberrant bodies ( ab ) .
antibiotic exposure is one stressor that can induce this response .
for example , penicillin g elicits the ab phenotype for up to 9 months in culture .
when penicillin is removed , the chlamydiae resume normal development and produce eb ( reviewed in [ 2 , 3 ]) .
exposure to other beta - lactam antibiotics , including amoxicillin , induces the ab phenotype in culture [ 4 ] and in vivo [ 5 ] .
chlamydiae cause asymptomatic infection , as well as acute and chronic diseases affecting different tissues , in humans and other animal species .
chlamydia trachomatis serovars a - d cause trachoma , the most common infectious form of human blindness .
in 2009 , there were =~ 40 million cases of active trachoma worldwide [ 6 ]. c. trachomatis serovars d - k and l1 - l3 primarily cause human genital tract infections , with =~ 105.7 million cases worldwide in 2008 [ 7 ] .
manifestations of genital c. trachomatis infection range from urethritis and epididymitis in men to cervicitis , infertility , and ectopic pregnancy in women [ 8 ]. c. trachomatis may be the most costly non - viral sexually transmitted infection , with cases from 2008 alone resulting in a total lifetime direct medical cost of =~ $ 516 million in the us [ 9 ] .
chlamydia pneumoniae causes human respiratory infections and atypical pneumonia .
recent seropositivity studies [ 10 - 12 ] indicate that > 50 % of adults have been c. pneumoniae exposed , confirming earlier observations [ 13 ] .
in the usa , azithromycin ( azm ) and doxycycline ( dox ) are treatments of choice for c. trachomatis infections in adults , though erythromycin , levofloxacin , and ofloxacin are alternatives .
azm is recommended for treatment of pregnant women , with amoxicillin and erythromycin as alternatives [ 14 ] .
atypical pneumonia is often treated empirically with azm because it covers multiple organisms , including c. pneumoniae .
dox is also a first - line antibiotic for c. pneumoniae ( reviewed in [ 15 **]) .
chlamydial infections occur in a wide range of animal species , including mammals , birds , fish , marsupials , insects , and amoebae .
pigs are of particular economic importance and can become infected with chlamydia suis , chlamydia pecorum , chlamydia psittaci , and chlamydia abortus. c. suis is the major pig pathogen , often occurring in mixed infections with other chlamydial species .
manifestations of c. suis infection include respiratory disease , diarrhea , conjunctivitis , and reproductive disorders , while sub - clinical intestinal infections may impair health and cause economic loss ( reviewed in [ 16 ]). c. suis is endemic in pig farms and wild boar populations worldwide .
though zoonotic transmission of c. suis from pigs to humans has not yet been demonstrated [ 16 ] , its dna has been detected in conjunctival swabs of nepalese trachoma patients [ 17 ] and belgian slaughterhouse workers [ 18 ] .
however , the low amount of c. suis dna detected in slaughterhouse employee eye swabs may result from hand - to - eye " contamination " rather than true infection [ 18 , 19 ] .
though limited information [ 20 - 22 ] is available concerning antibiotic sensitivity / resistance in other veterinary chlamydiae , we will focus on that in c. suis because of space constraints .
antibiotic resistance in c. suis the c. suis prototype strain s45 was isolated from feces of an asymptomatic pig in austria in the late 1960s and is tetracycline ( tet ) sensitive. c. suis strains are generally regarded as genetically diverse with variations in virulence , however , genomic data to support this prediction are unavailable .
only one partial draft c. suis genome ( strain md56 isolated from a pig with conjunctivitis ) has been published [ 23 ] .
other c. suis strains isolated in the usa , austria , germany , and italy , ( except s45 ) originated from pigs presenting with conjunctivitis , enteritis , respiratory disease , or reproductive failure [ 16 ] .
tetracyclines have been used since the 1950s to treat human and animal chlamydial infections , particularly in livestock .
in the past , livestock feed has been tet - supplemented to prevent infections and promote growth .
tetracyclines inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the small ribosomal subunit , have broad - spectrum anti - microbial activity , are inexpensive , and have low toxicity [ 24 , 25 ] .
however , their wide use in pig production has facilitated selection of resistant bacteria , with significant implications for human health .
increasing concerns about this practice led to a ban of the sub - therapeutic application of tetracyclines in europe in the 1970s [ 24 ] .
the mechanisms by which bacteria obtain resistance to tetracyclines include efflux pumps , drug - modifying enzymes , target mutation , and the employment of specialized ribosomal protection proteins [ 25 ] .
genetically stable tet resistance ( tetr ) was first described in c. suis strains from diseased and apparently healthy pigs in the usa .
eight tetr strains were isolated from pig farms in nebraska and iowa and homotypic tetr was retained after ten to 15 passages in tet - free medium .
six of these eight strains were also sulfadiazine resistant [ 26 ] .
two of these tetr strains ( r19 and r27 ) grew in culture at up to 4 mug / ml tet , but not at 5 mug / ml. in contrast , c. suis s45 was sensitive to 0.25 mug / ml tet .
chlamydial inclusions exposed to increasing tet concentrations contained larger numbers of ab. upon tet removal , the ab reverted to typical rb and continued normal development .
furthermore , c. suis r19 and c. trachomatis l2 occupied the same intracellular vacuole when hela cells were sequentially infected with both species [ 27 ] .
the stable c. suis tetr phenotype was later associated with the resistance gene tetc [ 28 ] .
seven tetr strains from the usa each contained one of four related , chromosomally - inserted genomic islands .
all 7 resistant isolates carried the tetc gene , encoding a tet efflux pump , as well as the tet repressor gene tetr .
the genomic islands also shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other gram - negative bacterial resistance plasmids .
these integrated c. suis tetr genomic island / plasmid - like elements were the first example of antibiotic resistance acquired in an obligate intracellular bacterium through horizontal gene transfer .
three of the four tetc islands also carried a novel insertion sequence homologous to the iscs605 family of insertion sequences of gram - negative bacteria .
all of these genomic islands were inserted at the same position within the chromosome of tetrc .
suis strains , interrupting a homologue of the invasion gene ( inv ) from the yersiniae [ 28 ] .
given that most c. suis strains are tet sensitive , from where did tetrc .
suis strains acquire these genomic islands ?
the chlamydial tetc islands have > 99 % identity with a resistance plasmid ( pras3.2 ) from aeromonas salmonicida [ 28 ] .
the plasmid is integrated into the genomic island iscs605 , which also encodes the transposase responsible for integration of these genomic islands into the chlamydial chromosome [ 29 ] .
more recently , the gram - negative bacterium laribacter hongkongenesis , which is associated with human gastroenteritis and found in freshwater fish , has been viewed as a potential donor for iscs605 .
the l. hongkongenesis iscs605 shared 100 % nucleotide identity to that from c. suis .
pig industry feeding practices that rely upon prophylactic tet delivery and use of fish as a feeding source may have facilitated acquisition of dna from fish bacteria , like a. salmonicida or l. hongkongenesis , by c. suis infecting the pig gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract ( reviewed in [ 30 ]) .
however , the proposed mechanism of acquisition of the tetr islands by c. suis remains speculative .
in vitro experiments have demonstrated horizontal transfer of tetr from c. suis to human clinical strains of c. trachomatis following co - culture .
in contrast , tetr transfer from c. suis to chlamydia caviae , the guinea pig chlamydial pathogen , was not observed [ 31 ] .
in a more recent study examining horizontal gene transfer of 16s rrna in prokaryotic organisms , four strains of c. trachomatis were found to have 16s rrna genes from c. suis [ 32 ] .
these data indicate gene transfer between c. suis and c. trachomatis occurs in nature and increases concern that antibiotic resistance genes will be transferred into c. trachomatis , either from c. suis or from other chlamydiae .
after tetrc .
suis strains were described in the usa , similar strains were reported in italy [ 33 ] , belgium [ 16 ] , and switzerland [ 34 ] .
in italy , 14 c. suis strains isolated from pigs with conjunctival and / or reproductive disorders reared in four different farms carried a tetc gene identical to tetc from the original us strains [ 33 ] .
in vitro dox minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) and minimal bactericidal concentration ( mbc ) values ranged from 4 - 8 mug / ml for 12 of these isolates .
interestingly , two of the 14 tetc - positive c. suis strains ( ms9 and ms14 ) showed lower mic and mbc values ( 0.5 and 1.0 mug / ml , respectively ) indicating partial dox sensitivity [ 33 ] .
the same 14 c. suis isolates were later tested against levofloxacin , dox , and rifaximin , an antimicrobial that is non - absorbable after oral administration and locally active inside the intestinal tract [ 35 ] .
rifaximin showed good in vitro activity against all 14 tetr strains , with mic and mbc values from 0.25 - 1 mug / ml. levofloxacin mic and mbc values ranged from 0.5 - 1 mug / ml , whereas those for dox ranged from 4 - 16 mug / ml , except for the ms9 and ms14 strains described above [ 35 ] .
a recent report by borel et al. was the first description of tetrc .
suis isolation from swine with conjunctivitis and diarrhea on a swiss farm .
ocular and fecal excretion was observed both before and after tet treatment .
though clinical signs disappeared after treatment , c. suis was not eliminated and strains harboring the tetc gene were positively selected .
this rapid selection for tetrc .
suis strains was surprising and possibly facilitated by close contact between pigs and tet - mediated selective pressure [ 34 ] .
more recently , tetrc .
suis strains were identified in sow vaginal / rectal swabs and boar semen obtained from four pig breeder - fattener farms located in israel , cyprus , and belgium reporting reproductive failures .
notably , the israeli farm used boar semen imported from a german pig insemination center [ 36 ] .
in another recent study , c. suis was detected via real - time pcr in vaginal swabs from dutch pigs with reproductive failure and in conjunctival swabs of asymptomatic employees from a belgian pig slaughterhouse .
the tetc gene was present only in dutch porcine c. suis isolates and not in human isolates from belgium [ 19 ] .
in an additional study , three of 15 c. suis strains isolated from rectal swabs of belgian slaughter pigs ( from three of ten farms ) were tetc positive .
however , none of the employees' eyes harbored resistant strains [ 18 ] .
thus , whether tetrc .
suis strains infect humans , thereby potentially facilitating transfer of tet resistance genes to human chlamydiae , remains an open question .
antibiotic resistance and treatment failure in chlamydial species that impact human health c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae have in vitro sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotic classes , including macrolides , tetracyclines , rifamycins , and quinolones ( reviewed in [ 15 **]) .
in vitro exposure to several beta - lactam antibiotics causes c. trachomatis rb to convert to the ab phenotype [ 4 ] .
when cultured in the presence of sub - inhibitory antibiotic concentrations , c. trachomatis can become resistant to rifamycins [ via mutations in the rna polymerase beta - subunit gene rpob ] , macrolides [ via 23s rrna gene mutations ] , and quinolones [ via mutations in the dna gyrase gene gyra ] .
however , as of 2010 , there was no convincing evidence for in vivo development of homotypic resistance in human chlamydial species ( reviewed in [ 30 ]) .
more recent studies of chlamydial strains isolated from infected patients after therapy have also failed to identify resistant organisms .
hong et al. compared c. trachomatis serovar a / b strains isolated during an ethopian trachoma control effort .
analysis of seven strains isolated from previously azm - or tet - treated patients showed no mic increase for either drug compared to control strains from untreated communities [ 37 ] .
a larger study confirmed these results , with none of 15 strains isolated post - treatment failure showing dox or azm resistance after a tanzanian mass - treatment program [ 38 *] .
additionally , a study of 24 c. trachomatis genital strains collected in croatia , which has the highest azm use in europe , identified no azm - or dox - resistant strains [ 39 ] .
similar studies conducted from 1994 - 2000 on c. pneumoniae strains isolated from patients with community - acquired pneumonia also revealed no evidence for homotypic resistance ( reviewed in [ 15 **]) .
thus , despite the observation of acquired tetr in c. suis , human chlamydial species have , fortunately , not yet crossed this rubicon .
published data suggest that treatment failure is a significant problem during human chlamydial infections .
for example , golden et al. observed an 8 % failure rate using recommended treatment regimens for genital c. trachomatis infection in women who had not reported subsequent sexual activity [ 40 ] .
more recently , 13.7 % of women experienced treatment failure for c. trachomatis genital infection , despite reporting no post - treatment sexual contact and full medication compliance [ 41 ] .
a recent review suggests treatment failure rates from 5 - 23 % , depending upon the patient population examined [ 42 ] .
although it remains difficult to discriminate from post - treatment reinfection or lack of treatment compliance , most retrospective studies suggest true treatment failure occurs in humans [ 43 ] .
since homotypic antibiotic resistance has not yet been documented in c. trachomatis or c. pneumoniae , investigators are exploring alternative mechanisms including the following : ( i ) development of heterotypic antibiotic resistance ( perhaps due to slower growth in certain environments or entry into a stress response in which the organisms are refractory to antibiotic treatment ) and ( ii ) infection of anatomic sites where chlamydiae are protected from antibiotics .
notably , these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and could occur in vivo , increasing the difficulty of determining which ( if any ) contribute to treatment failure .
heterotypic resistance , in which a subset of individual organisms within a population exhibit reduced antibiotic sensitivity , is one proposed mechanism for treatment failure in humans ( reviewed in [ 42 , 44 ]) .
such resistance can be conferred by phenotypic changes in a stressed bacterial population .
bhengraj et al. isolated c. trachomatis strains from recurrently infected female patients that had in vitro mic values for azm and dox of up to 8 mug / ml , compared to 0.12 - 0.25 mug / ml for a sensitive serovar d control strain .
in the absence of genetic data , the authors postulate heterotypic rather than homotypic resistance [ 45 ] .
o'neill et al. recently published a sensitivity and genomic analysis of two clinical c. trachomatis strains ( iu824 and iu888 ) previously reported to be tetr .
mic and titer assays revealed that neither strain exhibited phenotypic tetr in vitro .
whole genome sequencing did not reveal any known tetr element , although single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the 23s ribosomal rna ( rrna ) gene in both strains .
the authors concluded that the observed resistance was heterotypic and unlikely to result from genetic changes [ 46 ] .
thus , it seems likely that heterotypic resistance contributes to treatment failures observed in humans .
several recent cell culture studies have also illuminated mechanisms by which developing chlamydiae might escape antibiotic action .
tormakangas et al. infected calu - 3 human lung epithelial cells cultured on either semi - permeable inserts ( polarized orientation ) or plastic dishes ( flat , non - polarized cultures ) with c. pneumoniae .
polarized calu - 3 cultures produced fewer infectious eb than did " flat " cultures , suggesting that c. pneumoniae development differs when host cells are grown in the more biologically relevant polarized condition .
notably , the dox mbc ( minimal antibiotic concentration that eliminated eb production ) was > 33 - fold higher in polarized compared to flat calu - 3 cells , indicating that c. pneumoniae is less antibiotic sensitive when growing in polarized cells [ 47 ] .
oxygen concentration also alters chlamydial antibiotic sensitivity in culture .
although mics for dox , azm , moxifloxacin , and rifampin for c. trachomatis l2 are essentially identical under normoxic ( 20 % o2 ) and hypoxic ( 2 % o2 ) conditions ; mbc assays reveal that dox and azm are significantly less effective at reducing eb titer during hypoxia .
in contrast , moxifloxacin and rifampin mbcs are similar under hypoxic and normoxic conditions .
hypoxia upregulates expression of the host cellular atp - binding cassette ( abc ) transporter protein mdr - 1 , which may reduce the anti - chlamydial effect of dox [ 48 ] .
interestingly , when cultures of non - replicating , interferon - gamma - stressed c. trachomatis are used as drug targets , dox is more efficient at reducing eb production under hypoxic , compared to normoxic , conditions [ 49 ] .
therefore , local differences in o2 concentration or infected host cell developmental state could provide protected " pockets " within infected tissues where chamydiae can survive antibiotic exposure .
in culture , chlamydial stress response initiation halts the developmental cycle and the chlamydiae enter a reversible , non - replicating but viable state .
entry into the ab phenotype also increases resistance of ( i ) c. pneumoniae to azm and ofloxacin [ 50 ] , ( ii ) c. trachomatis serovar e to azm [ 51 ] , and ( iii ) c. trachomatis l2 to dox [ 52 ] .
stressed chlamydiae are more azm - resistant in vivo as well .
developing chlamydiae within the genital tract of chlamydia muridarum - infected , amoxicillin - treated mice enter the stressed state [ 5 ] .
furthermore , the azm therapy failure rate increases from 9 % in productively infected animals to 22 % in mice infected with amoxicillin - stressed chlamydiae [ 53 *] .
chlamydial forms with morphologic alterations consistent with stress induction have been observed in tissue samples from chlamydia - infected humans [ 54 , 55 , 56 *] , pigs [ 57 ] and mice [ 5 , 58 ] .
notably , nutrient - starvation , as well as interferon and beta - lactam antibiotic exposure , all induce chlamydial stress in culture ( reviewed in [ 2 , 3 ]) and occur in vivo .
thus , variation in local conditions may also increase treatment failure in vivo via chlamydial stress - induced heterotypic resistance [ 42 , 44 ] .
another intriguing possibility is that chlamydiae infecting specific anatomical sites are protected from antibiotics .
these tissues then serve as a reservoir from which the genital tract is " reseeded " after treatment cessation .
recent work has provided compelling data indicating the gi tract is one such protected site .
natural gi infection by chlamydial species that infect animals is well documented ( reviewed in [ 59 **]) .
in an extension of previous studies demonstrating long - term chlamydial gi colonization in mice [ 60 , 61 ] , yeruva et al. demonstrated that oral inoculation with as little as 100 ifu of c. muridarum established gi infection in mice for at least 75 days pi [ 62 ] .
a single oral 80 - mg / kg azm dose eliminated vaginal eb shedding from c. muridarum vaginally infected mice but failed to eradicate infectious eb from cecal tissue in orally infected animals .
hplc analyses indicated azm levels in cervical and cecal tissue were similar , suggesting similar drug penetration in both tissues .
conversely , dox treatment eliminated both genital shedding from vaginally infected mice and cecal eb production in orally infected mice .
the authors concluded that : ( i ) chlamydiae harbored within the gi tract are more azm resistant than those in the genital tract and ( ii ) dox more effectively eradicates gi chlamydial infection .
they also hypothesized that infectious chlamydiae shed from the gi tract after azm treatment may re - infect the genital tract [ 63 **] .
over 70 % of women with genital chlamydial infection tested positive for rectal infection in the absence of reported anal - receptive intercourse [ 64 , 65 ] , which is consistent with prediction that gi / genital auto - inoculation occurs in humans .
importantly , azm treatment failure in rectal infections may be as high as 22 % [ 66 ] .
both a recent meta - analysis [ 67 **] and a mathematical modeling study [ 68 ] support use of dox rather than azm for c. trachomatis rectal infection treatment .
though the need for additional case controlled studies was stressed , this recommendation was also echoed in a recent review by hocking et al .
[ 44 ] .
in humans , genital to gi chlamydial transmission seems most likely to occur during oral sex , though if pharyngeal colonization occurs [ 69 ] , such contact could also promote gi to genital transmission .
in contrast , post - treatment gi to genital auto - inoculation in women most likely results from genital contact with eb - containing gi secretions ( reviewed in [ 59 **]) .
if so , post - treatment auto - inoculation should be more frequent in women than men - - which is supported by data demonstrating lower treatment failure in genitally infected men than women [ 40 ] .
in female mice , auto - inoculation is likely mediated by contaminated gi secretions ( gi to genital ) or grooming ( genital to gi ) .
recent in vivo imaging studies , however , suggest an additional route .
luciferase - expressing c. muridarum rapidly colonizes the murine gi tract for up to 100 days after vaginal inoculation .
when auto - inoculation is prevented by fitting mice with elizabethan collars , or chlamydiae are introduced directly into the upper genital tract , gi infection is still observed .
these data suggest that c. muridarum may spread to the gi tract via a systemic route , though the authors point out that c. muridarum and c. trachomatis may differ in this respect [ 70 *] .
however , it seems prudent to evaluate whether systemic spread of c. trachomatis from the genital tract to the gi tract occurs in humans .
conclusions the recent emergence of tetrc .
suis strains raises concerns that pigs might be a reservoir for chlamydial tetr determinants .
however , detailed assessments of ( i ) the distribution of tetr chlamydial strains in wild and domestic pigs , and ( ii ) herd - related risk factors associated with tetr acquisition are lacking .
the possibility that other animal chlamydiae , such as c. abortus or c. psittaci , carry tet ( or other ) resistance determinants is also unexplored .
finally , the largely - environmental chlamydia - like organisms ( clos ) , are also emerging pathogens [ 71 *] .
those clos tested to date appear to have antibiotic resistance patterns similar to those of the traditional chlamydiaceae , with the exception of estrella lausannensis , which carries a single mutation in the 23s rrna gene and is azm - resistant [ 72 ] .
unlike c. trachomatis , clos are also generally fluoroquinolone resistant [ 73 , 74 ] .
thus , additional studies are needed to determine whether chlamydial veterinary pathogens and environmental clos can transfer antibiotic resistance genes to c. suis , c. trachomatis , or c. pneumoniae .
recent studies suggest treatment failure during human genital infection results from incomplete eradication of simultaneous chronic gi infection , which re - establishes genital tract infection after therapy .
rank and yeruva proposed a number of interesting mechanisms by which chlamydiae in the gi tract might escape azm therapy [ 59 **] .
however , it is also important to consider the role of ( i ) varied local gi o2 or nutrient concentrations , ( ii ) infection of gi cells in different developmental states , and / or ( iii ) induction of ab formation by stressors in the gi environment , the latter of which is consistent with the observation of c. suis ab within the gi epithelium of infected pigs [ 57 ] .
it seems likely that chlamydiae infect multiple host cell types / locations within the gi tract , which vary in physiological status and / or extracellular environment .
in certain host cell types or nutrient - rich areas , chlamydial development would progress rapidly - - releasing infectious eb. in other host cell types , or more stressful micro - environments , chlamydial development would be slowed or halted by the stress response - - which could provide a treatment - resistant reservoir of chlamydiae .
thus , further dissection of the mechanisms by which chlamydiae establish chronic gi infection and evade antibiotic action is warranted .
more importantly , though dox appears more effective than azm for eradicating gi / rectal chlamydial infection [ 63 ** , 67 **] , more extensive case - controlled studies in humans are a high priority .
though many advances in understanding chlamydial biology have been made over the last decade , the spectrum of effective anti - chlamydials has remained nearly unchanged ( reviewed by [ 15 **]) .
sustained azm therapy has also been associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events in patients [ 75 ] , raising the possibility that higher or repeated azm doses to eliminate gi carriage might be contraindicated .
finally , emergence of homotypic antibiotic resistance in human chlamydiae remains a threat .
thus , development of novel anti - chlamydials is a high priority .
the dozens of recently identified candidates are beyond the scope of this review but include type iii secretion ( t3s ) inhibitors , chlamydial enzyme inhibitors , and compounds that block essential host cell functions .
for example , modified forms of a salicylidene acylhydrazide t3s inhibitor inhibit c. muridarum , c. pneumoniae , and c. trachomatis serovar d inclusion development and eb production in culture [ 76 ] .
the peptide deformylase inhibitor gm6001 inhibits c. trachomatis l2 inclusion development in culture and reduces vaginal shedding from c. muridarum - infected mice by > 100 - fold [ 77 ] .
the antiviral compound st - 669 also reduces c. muridarum , c. trachomatis l2 , and chlamydia caviae growth in culture , possibly by a host lipid droplet - dependent mechanism [ 78 ] .
interestingly , exposure to jo146 , an inhibitor of the chlamydial protease htra , significantly reduces c. trachomatis eb production when stressed chlamydiae re - enter developmental cycle [ 79 ] .
jo146 also inhibits growth of c. trachomatis clinical strains in culture [ 80 ] .
thus , if chlamydial stress induction contributes to treatment failure in vivo , htra inhibitors might be used to increase azm therapy success .
though recent studies indicate that peptidoglycan ( ppg ) synthesis inhibitors disrupt cell division in both chlamydiae and clo [ 81 ** , 82 ] , caution in targeting ppg synthesis as a potential drug target is warranted due to the observation that beta - lactams induce chlamydial stress [ 4 , 83 , 84 ] .
regardless , given the recent rectal / gi infection data , it is particularly important that potential anti - chlamydials be tested for efficacy in animal models of gi and genital infection before proceeding to clinical trials .

background rapid and uneventful postoperative recovery following general anesthesia in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery may offer challenges to anesthesiologists. with improved surgical techniques and shorter pneumoperitoneum , regional anesthesia may be considered for this laparoscopic procedure in selected cases .
case description the first patient was a 60 - year - old male ( body mass index : 39 kg / m2 ) who was scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy .
the second patient was a 46 - year - old female ( body mass index : 47 kg / m2 ) who was scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass .
after standard intraoperative monitoring was applied , epidural anesthesia was performed at thoracic level t9 - t10 .
surgical technique modification included insufflation of co2 at a low flow rate and avoidance of orogastric tube use .
during the procedure , both patients breathed spontaneously without difficulty .
one hypotension episode occurred and was successfully treated with a 12 - mg bolus of ephedrine in case 1 .
shoulder pain occurred intraoperatively in case 2 and was successfully treated with a 50 - mug bolus of fentanyl .
postoperatively , 2 mg epidural morphine was administered for postoperative analgesia .
both patients were satisfied with the anesthesia technique and was discharged uneventfully .
discussion and evaluation this anesthetic technique may maintain pre - operative respiratory function , increase alertness , and reduce the use of rescue analgesics , which is crucial for optimal outcomes in morbidly obese patients .
conversion of epidural anesthesia to general anesthesia may be required if patients can not tolerate the laparoscopic procedure ( e.g. intolerable shoulder pain ) or the increased respiratory rate during pneumoperitoneum leading to difficulty in performing laparoscopic surgery .
further studies are needed to elucidate this issue .
conclusions general anesthesia is widely used for laparoscopic bariatric surgery , but epidural anesthesia may be a viable alternative to general anesthesia in selected cases .
further prospective studies may be required to elucidate the relative advantages and disadvantages of epidural anesthesia in this surgical population .
keywords epidural anesthesia laparoscopic bariatric surgery obesity issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background bariatric surgery , the only proven , effective , and durable treatment for morbidly obese patients ( brolin 2002 ) , is commonly performed under general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics and neuromuscular blockade .
however , general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade increases upper airway collapse risk , pulmonary atelectasis , and postoperative pulmonary complications in this population ( pelosi et al. 1997 ) .
acute respiratory failure , if occurs after bariatric surgery , may significantly increase in - hospital mortality ( masoomi et al. 2013 ) .
we report two case of successful laparoscopic bariatric surgery under epidural anesthesia. with improved surgical techniques and shorter pneumoperitoneum , regional anesthesia may be considered as be a viable alternative to general anesthesia in selected cases .
case report the first patient was a 60 - year - old male ( weight : 115 kg ; height : 172 cm ; body mass index : 39 kg / m2 ) who was scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy .
his past history included tobacco - related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) and asthma .
preoperative pulmonary function tests revealed severe obstructive impairment , with forced vital capacity ( fvc ) 1.29 l , one - second forced expiratory volume ( fev1 ) 0.76 l , and fev1 / fvc 59 % .
the second patient was a 46 - year - old female ( weight : 115 kg ; height : 157 cm ; body mass index of 47 kg / m2 ) who was scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass .
her past history included diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and obstructive sleep apnea .
both patients had an asa physical status 3 and physical examination was unremarkable .
the airway , assessed with the patients in the sitting position , was judged to be mallampati class i - ii. both patients were scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery because of failing conservative weight loss measures .
the operative criteria were based on the asia - pacific guidelines for bariatric surgery , i.e. body mass index >= 32 kg / m2 in the presence of comorbidities and body mass index >= 37 kg / m2 with or without comorbidities .
at the preoperative visit , both patients opted for epidural anesthesia after a detailed explanation regarding postoperative pulmonary complication risks .
epidural anesthesia and the possibility of intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia were explained .
standard intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiography , noninvasive blood pressure , and pulse oximetry .
after obtaining baseline vital signs , oxygen ( 6 l / min ) was commenced through a face mask .
both patients received ketorolac 30 mg and meperidine 30 mg as an analgesic premedication to relieve procedural discomfort .
before epidural anesthesia , they received ringer 's lactate solution ( 500 ml ). with both patients at the right lateral decubitus position , an 18 - gauge tuohy - huber needle was introduced at the t9 / t10 intervertebral space using the paramedian approach under full aseptic precautions .
after " loss of resistance " to air was identified , a 20 - gauge epidural catheter was threaded into place .
the tip of the catheter was advanced 4 - 6 cm cephalad beyond the needle tip .
after the catheter was taped to the patient 's back , they were turned to the supine position .
thigh - length antiembolic stockings and sequential pneumatic compression devices were placed on both lower extremities for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis .
urine catheter was not inserted .
after intravascular / intrathecal injection was excluded by injecting a 3 - ml test dose of 2 % lidocaine and epinephrine ( 1 : 200,000 ) , an intermittent bolus of 0.5 % bupivacaine and 5 microg / ml fentanyl was injected to obtain segmental sensory block ( pinprick ) till the fourth thoracic dermatomes .
the laparoscopic bariatric surgery was performed by an experienced surgeon , who performed 250 - 300 cases of laparoscopic bariatric surgery per year .
pneumoperitoneum was established with carbon dioxide at an intra - abdominal pressure of 13 mmhg .
to avoid vasovagal reflex and shoulder pain , the carbon dioxide was insufflated at a low flow rate ( 2 l / min ) ( yuksek et al. 2008 ) .
then both patients was placed in reverse trendelenburg position at 30degrees - 45degrees angle .
calibrating orogastric tube was not used for gastric pouch formation .
laparoscopic bariatric surgery was performed according to the technique described before ( zachariah et al. 2013 ) .
no other intraoperative sedatives were administered .
in case 1 , one episode of hypotension ( systolic blood pressure < 90 mmhg ) occurred after epidural anesthesia , and a 12 - mg ephedrine bolus was intravenously administered .
afterward , his hemodynamic changes were minimal .
the patient was alert and breathed spontaneously without difficulty .
intraoperatively , no shoulder pain or other discomfort was described .
in case 2 , shoulder pain occurred during penumoperitoneum and fentanyl 50 mug was given intravenously to relieve the shoulder pain .
no episode of hypotension or desaturation was observed during the procedure .
the surgeon considered the abdominal relaxation was acceptable in both patients .
however , increased respiratory rate in case 1 caused a slight disturbance during laparoscopic exploration .
the procedure was completed without complications ( operative time : 49 min ) .
in case 2 , the laparoscopic procedure was completed without difficulty ( operative time : 56 min ) .
at the end of the operation , 2 mg morphine plus 14 ml normal saline was administered via the epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia in both patients .
then , the epidural catheter was removed .
both patients were able to move unassisted from the operating table to their bed after the operation .
postoperative recovery was uneventful .
they did not experience nausea , vomiting , itching , urine retention , or respiratory depression .
rescue analgesics for pain were not required within 24 h postoperatively .
both patients were satisfactory with the anesthetic technique at the postoperative visit , and were discharged on postoperative day three .
discussion obese patients often have poor pulmonary functional residual capacity and other spirometric parameters .
as general anesthesia may cause increased intrapulmonary shunting and atelectasis , postoperative pulmonary complications are common in morbidly obese patients after laparoscopic bariatric surgery ( reinius et al. 2009 ) .
respiratory failure in morbidly obese patients is associated with greater in - hospital mortality after bariatric surgery ( masoomi et al. 2013 ) .
patients under regional anesthesia usually develop fewer pulmonary complications than those under general anesthesia ( pedersen et al .
1992 ) ; this is why we chose epidural anesthesia for this procedure .
carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum may adversely affect intraoperative pulmonary mechanics ( nguyen et al. 2004 ) .
therefore , our patient was at risk of intraoperative pulmonary distress .
in a previous small feasibility study ( n = 23 ) , symeonidis et al .
( 2013 ) , found that obese patients ( mean body mass index : 36 kg / m2 ) tolerate laparoscopic ventral hernia repair well without intraoperative pulmonary complications .
also , there are several reported cases of uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomies that used regional anesthesia in patients with severe pulmonary disease ( kim et al. 2007 ; van zundert et al. 2006 ; pursnani et al. 1998 ) .
pneumoperitoneum - induced respiratory distress did not occur in our patients .
to maintain the reverse trendelenburg position at 30degrees - 45degrees angle during procedure and short duration of pneumoperitoneum may have also contributed to this .
there are several advantages to using regional anesthesia for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in both cases .
first , preoperative pulmonary function parameters may be maintained throughout the surgery ( kim et al. 2007 ; van zundert et al. 2006 ; pursnani et al. 1998 ) .
in contrast , pulmonary function parameters may not return to preoperative levels until the seventh postoperative day in patients receiving general anesthesia ( nguyen et al. 2001 ) .
secondly , both the laparoscopic procedure ( nguyen et al. 2002 ) and invasive tracheal intubation ( carron et al .
2012 ) may induce significant systemic stress response , which can have a potential detrimental effects in high co - morbidity obese patients .
using epidural anesthesia for our patient helped avoid airway intervention and attenuated sympathetic responses caused by the surgical insult ( aono et al .
1998 ) ; this likely improved his postoperative outcomes and accelerated baseline function return .
finally , morbid obesity is generally concluded to be a risk factor for the development of perioperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism ( wu and barba 2000 ) .
the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is lower with epidural anesthesia than with general anesthesia ( rodgers et al. 2000 ) .
shoulder pain , caused by diaphragmatic irritation by insufflation gas , is common during laparoscopic surgery under regional anesthesia .
a fentanyl bolus dose may relieve the shoulder pain ; however , conversion of regional to general anesthesia may be necessary in some cases .
in a prospective study ( n = 180 ) , the authors reported that the frequency of anesthetic conversions due to intolerable shoulder pain during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is 4.4 % ( bessa et al. 2012 ) .
hypotension caused by neuraxial blockade is also common during laparoscopic surgeries ( lee et al .
2010 ) , but it can be easily controlled with ephedrine , as in our case .
in our patients , 2 mg epidural morphine was administered for postoperative analgesia , which may avoid the risk of ventilatory depression induced by intravenous opioid administration .
because of the absence of side effects , such as vertigo from general anesthesia and intravenous opioids , patients receiving epidural anesthesia and analgesia tend to ambulate earlier than patients receiving general anesthesia .
early ambulation may decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complication in obese patients ( rawal et al. 1984 ) .
in conscious patients , increased minute ventilation during laparoscopic procedures may lead to increased respiratory rate ( ciofolo et al .
1990 ) , creating difficulty in performing the procedure .
although in our cases , the experienced surgeon considered the abdominal relaxation sufficient to continue , increased respiratory rate caused a slight disturbance during exploration in case 1 .
the operative time was 49 min in this patient , which was favorable compared with previous surgeries by the same team .
in their previous study , mean operative time was 60.63 +/ - 27.37 min in patients under general anesthesia ( zachariah et al. 2013 ) .
this may imply that an experienced surgeon can handle a slightly increased respiratory rate .
other studies focusing on laparoscopic cholecystectomy also demonstrated no difference in operative time between regional and general anesthesia ( bessa et al. 2012 ) .
further studies are needed to elucidate this issue .
there are some limitation in this report .
first , difficulty in anesthetic technique may be encountered more frequently in obese patients , which may lead to a high failure rate when performing epidural anesthesia .
secondly , intraoperative conversion of epidural anesthesia to general anesthesia may be required if patients cannot tolerate the laparoscopic procedure ( e.g. intolerable shoulder pain or prolonged surgical time ) .
finally , increased respiratory rate in awake patients during pneumoperitoneum may lead to difficulty in performing laparoscopic surgery .
in this condition , conversion to general anesthesia is also required .
these concern may discourage anesthesiologists and surgeons to perform this anesthetic technique for laparoscopic bariatric surgery .
further prospective studies with large sample size are required to clarify the indication and contraindication ( relative advantages and disadvantages ) of performing regional anesthesia for laparoscopic bariatric surgery .
conclusion this report reminds the anesthesiologists and surgeons that epidural anesthesia may be a viable alternative to general anesthesia for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in selected cases .
this anesthetic technique may maintain pre - operative respiratory function , increase alertness , and reduce the use of rescue analgesics .
a speedy return to baseline function is crucial for optimal outcomes in these patients .

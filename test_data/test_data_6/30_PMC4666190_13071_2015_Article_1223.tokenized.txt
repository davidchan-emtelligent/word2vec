introduction the voltage gated sodium channel mutation vgsc - 1014s ( kdr - east ) was first reported in kenya in 2000 and has since been observed to occur at high frequencies in the local anopheles gambiae s.s. population .
the mutation vgsc - 1014f has never been reported from an. gambiae complex complex mosquitoes in kenya .
findings molecularly confirmed an. gambiae s.s .
( hereafter an. gambiae ) and an. arabiensis collected from 4 different parts of western kenya were genotyped for kdr from 2011 to 2013 .
vgsc - 1014f was observed to have emerged , apparently , simultaneously in both an. gambiae and an. arabiensis in 2012 .
a portion of the samples were submitted for sequencing in order to confirm the vgsc - 1014f genotyping results .
the resulting sequence data were deposited in genbank ( accession numbers : kr867642 - kr867651 , kt758295 - kt758303 ) .
a single vgsc - 1014f haplotype was observed suggesting , a common origin in both species .
conclusion this is the first report of vgsc - 1014f in kenya .
based on our samples , the mutation is present in low frequencies in both an. gambiae and an. arabiensis .
it is important that we start monitoring relative frequencies of the two kdr genes so that we can determine their relative importance in an area of high insecticide treated net ownership .
keywords kdr insecticide resistance pyrethroids anopheles gambiae issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction the two most widely applied vector control tools , insecticide treated nets ( itns ) and indoor residual spraying ( irs ) have contributed greatly to the decline in global malaria rates [ 1 , 2 ] .
pyrethroids are the most commonly used insecticides in control programs due to their low human toxicity and high efficacy against vectors [ 3 , 4 ] .
previously , ddt , an organochlorine , was the most widely used insecticide for vector control with its use spread out over multiple countries for malaria control [ 5 , 6 ] .
the widespread use of these insecticides has likely contributed to the selection of resistance across sub - saharan africa [ 7 ] ( http :// www.irmapper.com /) .
increased resistance to pyrethroids is particularly troubling since this is the only class of insecticides approved by who for use on itns [ 3 ] .
if itns are rendered ineffective , a surge in malaria transmission could follow [ 8 ] .
resistance to pyrethroids has been reported from multiple sites in western kenya [ 9 , 10 ] with both target site and metabolic resistance mechanisms implicated [ 9 - 15 ] .
ddt and pyrethroids function by binding to the voltage gated sodium channels ( vgsc ) on the mosquito 's neurons delaying the closing of the sodium channel ; prolonging the action potential and causing repetitive neuron firing , ultimately resulting in paralysis and death [ 8 , 16 ] .
in anopheles gambiae s.l. , knock down resistance ( kdr ) is commonly caused by mutations in the vgsc - either from leucine ( tta ) to phenylalanine ( ttt ) or leucine to serine ( tca ) [ 11 , 17 ] at codon 1014 .
vgsc - 1014s ( formerly kdr - east ) was first reported in kenya in 2000 and has been observed to occur at high frequencies in the local an. gambiae populations [ 10 , 11 ] .
thus far , there has been no report of the existence of vgsc - 1014f ( formerly kdr - west ) in kenya but has been reported in uganda and tanzania in the recent past [ 18 , 19 ] .
our work demonstrates the emergence of vgsc - 1014f in western kenya in two principal malaria vectors , an. gambiae and an. arabiensis .
findings material and methods this study was conducted in four malaria endemic districts in western kenya with two distinct vector control interventions : rachuonyo and nyando where irs ( deltamethrin in 2011 and lambdacyhalothrin in 2012 ) was combined with itns ( treated with permethrin or deltamethrin ) ; and in bondo and teso where only itns are deployed [ 9 ] .
mosquito collections were performed annually between june and september in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
mosquito sampling , rearing and bioassays of emergent adults were conducted as described in ochomo et al .
[ 9 ] .
species identification & vgsc genotyping dna was extracted from whole specimens and a pcr assay [ 20 ] was used to distinguish between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis .
dna samples were genotyped to identify the kdr genotype at amino acid position 1014 of the vgsc using a modification of the protocol by bass et al. , [ 21 ] as described in mathias et al. , [ 10 ] .
exon sequencing of vgsc previous studies in western kenya have only reported the presence of vgsc - 1014s mutation .
therefore , in order to confirm the presence of vgsc - 1014f and to determine if was a de novo origin , a subsample of the vgsc - 1014f carriers were sanger sequenced .
prior to sequencing , conventional pcr was used to amplify the exon 20 [ 22 ] which contains the 1014 locus ] .
samples were sequenced at centre for genomic research , university of liverpool , uk and resulting sequences aligned using codoncode aligner ( http :// www.codoncode.com / aligner /) .
analysis for the origin of vgsc - 1014f mutation gene sequences obtained from the sequencing exons 20 and 27 were aligned using codon code aligner ( http :// www.codoncode.com /) and the contigs transferred to dnasp ( http :// www.ub.edu / dnasp /) as fasta files .
the files were concatenated and then run using the phase algorithm in dnasp [ 23 ] .
the phased files were exported as a phylip file to tcs , a statistical parsimony software for phylogenetic network estimation ( http :// darwin.uvigo.es / software / tcs.html ) .
results frequency of vgsc - 1014s and vgsc - 1014f in the study sites from 2011 to 2013 we observed low frequencies of vgsc - 1014s in an. arabiensis,even though we had high frequencies of the same allele in an. gambiae , they were much lower than has been reported previously [ 10 ] .
we saw a simultaneous appearance of vgsc - 1014f inboth an. gambiae and an. arabiensis in 2012 in all four study sites ( table 1 ) and thereafter compared the mean frequencies of the genes among the three years ( table 2 ). of these , 19 samples ( 12 an. gambiae and 7 an. arabiensis ) were sequenced .
3 an. gambiae and 3 an. arabiensis were confirmed to be homozygous for vgsc - 1014f with one an. arabiensis heterozygote detected .
the sequences were deposited in genbank ( accession numbers : kr867642 - kr867651 , kt758295 - kt758303 ) .

however it should be noted that our ability to resolve different haplotypes was constrained by the low levels of diversity at this locus and our small amplicon length ( 478bp ). fig. 1 a tcs plot of the three haplotypes present in the populations assayed .
white colour represents an. gambiae while black colour represents an. arabiensis discussion this is the first report of vgsc - 1014f in kenya , which appears to have emerged in both an. gambiae and an. arabiensis around 2012 and is confirmed via dna sequencing in multiple samples .
the gene has previously been observed in uganda [ 18 ] , then much later in tanzania [ 19 ] and now in kenya .
we have developed this report to alert researchers and programmatic staff to the presence of vgsc - 1014f mutation in these two important anopheles vectors so that they can modify their resistance marker screening procedures .
it is important therefore that we start monitoring allele and genotype frequencies so that we can assess their impact in an area of high bednet ownership .

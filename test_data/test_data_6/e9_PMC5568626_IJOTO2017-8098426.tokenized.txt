background prevalence of rhinitis in athletes has frequently been studied and varies widely from 27 % to 74 % .
the aim of this systematic review was to examine the prevalence of rhinitis in athletes , to specifically compare the evidence of rhinitis in land - based and aquatic athletes .
methods systematic search of medline , embase , and the non - medline subset of pubmed was performed from inception to march 8 , 2016 , to identify studies on rhinitis in athletes .
results of the 373 identified unique articles , a total of 13 studies satisfied the criteria for this review .
the final group contained 9 cohort and 4 case - control studies .
we found 10 studies that reported the prevalence of allergic rhinitis ( 21 % - 56.5 %) .
in contrast , nonallergic rhinitis was identified by only 1 author ( 6 %) .
we have also evaluated the prevalence of rhinitis in the separate subgroups ( land , water , and cold air ) where swimmers seem to be the most affected ( 40 % - 74 %) , followed by cross - country skiers ( 46 %) and track and field athletes ( 21 to 49 %) .
conclusion we did not reveal any convincing trend of a higher prevalence in land - based athletes compared to general population. by contrast , aquatic and cold air athletes demonstrate increased prevalence reflecting the irritant effects of their environment on the nasal mucosa .
1. introduction peak sporting performance requires optimal levels of health and fitness .
rhinitis , with its proven detrimental effects on sleep and mood [ 1 ] , and its association with asthma [ 2 ] , has clear potential for compromising athletic ability .
the acute effects of exercise on the nose have been well delineated - - vasoconstriction of the capacitance vessels results in a measurable increase in nasal volume [ 3 ] .
in aerobic exercise , nasal minute ventilation increases absolutely but proportionately contributes less than at rest , as the low resistance oral airway is used preferentially [ 4 ] .
the impact on nasal physiology of repeated exercise training is less well established .
many of the environments and endeavours in which athletes are immersed have the potential for harm to the nasal mucosa .
for example , an exercise which takes place in cold air ( skiers , snowboarders , and ice hockey ) or in chlorinated water ( swimmers , divers , and water polo ) subjects the nasal mucosa to local irritants .
aerobic exercise which takes place outdoors may result in inhalation of above average volumes of aeroallergens , nitrous oxide , or pollution due to the increased minute ventilation required to sustain activity [ 5 , 6 ] .
rhinitis in athletes has frequently been studied in combination with asthma , and although there are many literature estimates of prevalence in the athletic population , the estimates of frequency of rhinitis vary widely - - from 27 % to 74 % [ 7 , 8 ] - - which may in part be attributable to differences in the studied populations ( e.g. , swimmers and runners ) , the aetiology of the rhinitis studied ( irritative , allergic , or undefined ) , or the diagnostic criteria used .
the reported prevalence of ar in normal population differs from country to country .
in a study using the aria definition on the european population , the prevalence was found to be around 25 % and ranged from 17 % to 28.5 % [ 9 ] .
moreover , an increasing trend in prevalence of ar has been observed over the last decades of the past millennium but in the last 25 years this trend seems to be tailed off [ 10 , 11 ] .
the prevalence of nar in the normal population is not as well studied as ar but nar has been reported to account for from 17 to 52 % of all cases of rhinitis in adults [ 12 , 13 ] .
the aim of this systematic review was to examine the prevalence of rhinitis in athletes , to specifically compare the evidence of rhinitis in land - based and aquatic athletes .
2. methods we sought to investigate the prevalence of rhinitis in athletes .
the inclusion criteria were as follows : study must evaluate only human study subjects who reached age of 12 years , contain abstract , and be published in the english language between january 1980 and october 2015 .
we defined an athlete as a person who trains more than 6 hours / week .
we classified sports into three categories which represent their different environments : land , water , and cold air .
our review followed the prisma ( preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analysis ) guidelines for reporting .
p.s. and a.w. performed a systematic search of medline ( ovid ) , embase ( ovid ) , and the non - medline subset of pubmed from inception to march 8 , 2016 , to identify studies on rhinitis in athletes .
both controlled vocabulary ( including mesh - terms ) and words in title , abstract , and author keywords were searched .
we excluded studies indexed with animals , but not indexed with humans , conference abstracts and case reports , and studies with trauma or concussion in the title .
the search consisted of two concepts : athletes ( including all kinds of athletic sports , swimming , and high intensity training ) and rhinitis ( consisting of synonyms for rhinitis and symptoms and underlying mechanisms of and tests for rhinitis ) .
we cross - checked the reference lists and the citing articles of the identified relevant papers and adapted the search in case of additional relevant studies .
the bibliographic records retrieved were imported and deduplicated using endnote .
studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed on quality using the prisma / amstar checklist as a guideline .
the studies which did not discuss the subject were excluded .
no minimum was set on the number of study subjects .
2.1 .
data collection all abstracts and full - text articles were reviewed by two researchers ( p.s. and a.w. ) using the following inclusion criteria : cohort designs ( case report , case series , other noncohort study designs , and nonsystematic reviews were excluded ) .
information obtained from each article included authors , year of publication , number of participants , number of participants per category ( land / water / cold air ) , study design , outcomes , and prevalence .
findings were tabulated and descriptively analysed , listing outcomes measured .
according to the aria document , allergic rhinitis is clinically defined as a symptomatic disorder of the nose , induced after allergen exposure due to an immunoglobulin ige - mediated inflammation .
symptoms of allergic rhinitis include rhinorrhea , nasal obstruction , nasal itching , and sneezing which are reversible spontaneously or with treatment [ 25 ] .
based on duration of symptoms , aria subdivides ar into intermittent or persistent .
nar is defined as symptoms of rhinitis without positive skin prick test [ 26 ] .
in this review , we studied the overall prevalence of rhinitis regardless of the phenotype and also ar and nar separately .
the methods used for diagnosis of rhinitis are markedly heterogeneous and in surveys studying athletes poorly reported .
therefore , we reviewed the literature to find the most suitable definition for rhinitis in athletes .
we included the studies with the diagnosis of rhinitis ( both nonallergic ( nar ) and allergic rhinitis ( ar )) based on the " self - reported physician diagnosis / physician diagnosis " or positive answers in a questionnaire .
in the case of ar , this had to be accompanied with at least one positive skin prick test result / positive serum specific ige - test .
3. results a systematic review of titles , abstracts , and full - text publications was performed as described in figure 1. of the 373 identified unique articles , a total of 13 studies satisfied the criteria for this review .
the characteristics are illustrated in table 1 .
demographic details and efforts to control confounding were incompletely reported .
nine cohort and 4 case - control studies were included .
five authors used for diagnosis the questionnaire with or without spt / positive serum specific ige - test and 8 self - reported physician diagnosis / physician diagnosis .
a quantitative meta - analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of the outcome data .
we found 10 studies that reported the prevalence of ar in which the prevalence ranged from 21 % to 56.5 % .
in contrast , nar was identified by only 1 author ( prevalence 6 %) [ 7 ] .
we have also evaluated the prevalence in the separate subgroups ( land , water , and cold air ) .
rhinitis in swimmers was studied by 3 authors who reported prevalences ranging from 40 % to 74 % [ 8 , 21 , 22 ] .
rong et al. reported prevalence of physician - diagnosed ar in 56.5 % [ 21 ] .
two authors focused on the prevalence of overall rhinitis ( ar + nar ) which was reported as 40 % and 74 % [ 8 , 22 ] .
we identified only one study which distinguished the specific prevalence for athletes training in cold environment , reporting rhinitis in 46 % [ 15 ] .
using track and field athletes to represent the land subgroup does not reveal an increased incidence of ar when compared with the general population ( 21 to 49 %) [ 7 , 17 ] .
4. discussion this systematic review of the literature demonstrates that the analysis of the prevalence of rhinitis in athletes is hindered by a relatively wide range of reported results and heterogeneity of methods used for diagnosis which are in surveys studying athletes poorly reported .
lack of consensus evidence and critical reviews on this topic led us to perform this systematic review to examine the prevalence of rhinitis in athletes .
unfortunately , a quantitative meta - analysis was not possible to perform due to the heterogeneity of the outcome data .
as illustrated in table 1 , athletes as a whole population do not seem to suffer with ar more often than general population .
the prevalence of ar ranged widely between 21 % and 56.5 % .
nar , although evaluated by only 1 author , was found to be 6 % ( table 1 ) .
the true prevalence of nar in normal population is not known , and precise data are difficult to obtain as nar can coexist with allergic rhinitis , and therefore the comparison between athletes and normal population is difficult to perform [ 12 , 27 ] .
noticeable is also the stable prevalence of ar in athletes over the last 25 years which is comparable with the normal population [ 10 , 11 ] .
it is unfortunate that we had to exclude studies dated from the last decades of the past millennium due to poorly reported diagnostic methods , and therefore a long - term comparison with the normal population cannot be achieved .
the wide range of results might also suggest heterogeneity of either the population or sampling methods .
therefore , we have examined the prevalence in the separate subgroups ( land , water , and cold air ) according to the environment where they spent the most training hours .
after doing so , the range narrows and is easier to interpret .
for example , track and field athletes do not suffer from rhinitis significantly more than general population , regardless of being endurance or sprint specialists [ 18 ] .
on the contrary , 48.6 % of athletes who spend training hours in cold environment report rhinitis and the distinctive symptom is rhinorrhea ( 96 %) , often severe [ 15 ] .
aquatic environment causes a similar pattern , with analysis of all studied swimmers reporting rhinitis in 56 % to 74 % [ 8 , 21 , 28 ] .
bougault et al. in the case - control study showed a significant difference of rhinitis prevalence ( ar + nar ) between the swimmers and healthy controls ( 74 % versus 40 % , resp. , p < 0.01 ) [ 8 ] .
the assumption would be that the rhinitis in swimmers is nonallergic in nature due to chlorine irritation and coexists with ar probably in higher prevalence compared to the normal population .
unfortunately , studies which satisfied the inclusion criteria did not examine the prevalence of nar phenotype separately .
athletes are also known to suffer with exercise - induced rhinitis which is characterized by short - term rhinitic symptoms triggered by the exercise [ 29 ] .
interestingly , the prevalence of exercise - induced rhinitis was similar in between swimmers and runners [ 30 ] .
we have excluded studies examining this entity as our study was focused on chronic rhinitis .
moreover , many patients with rhinitis without asthma demonstrate nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness after exercise or methacholine , this being a risk factor for developing asthma which is reported between 3.7 % and 22.8 % in athletes .
if epidemiological studies indicate that rhinitis and asthma often coexist , prospective studies suggest that rhinitis frequently precedes the development of asthma [ 28 ] .
when the two risk factors , sporting activity and atopy , were combined in a logistic regression model , the relative risk of asthma was surprisingly high : 25 - fold in an atopic speed and power athlete , 42 - fold in an atopic long - distance runner , and 97 - fold in atopic swimmers compared with nonatopic controls [ 31 ] .
5. conclusion rhinitis in the athlete is an emerging field of interest .
the published evidence identified in this systematic review illustrates the need for precision when analysing this particular population : to take care to define both the individual studied ( and their exercise environment ) and the condition identified ( allergic or nonallergic ) .
although individual studies suggest an increase in prevalence of rhinitis in the land - based athlete , systematic review of the literature does not reveal any convincing trend of a higher prevalence compared to the general population. by contrast , aquatic and cold air athletes both demonstrate an increased prevalence of rhinitis - - reflecting the irritant effects of their environment on the nasal mucosa .
conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest .

the endocannabinoid system ( ecs ) is involved in many physiological processes and has been suggested to play a critical role in the immune response and the central nervous system ( cns ) .
therefore , ecs modulation has potential therapeutic effects on immune dysfunctional disorders , such as sepsis and cns injury - induced immunodeficiency syndrome ( cids ) .
in sepsis , excessive release of pro - and anti - inflammatory mediators results in multi - organ dysfunction , failure , and death .
in cids , an acute cns injury dysregulates a normally well - balanced interplay between cns and the immune system , leading to increased patients' susceptibility to infections .
in this review , we will discuss potential therapeutic modulation of the immune response in sepsis and cns injury by manipulation of the ecs representing a novel target for immunotherapy .
endocannabinoid system immune dysfunction sepsis central nervous system injury immunosuppression gpr55 cns injury - induced immunodeficiency syndrome introduction the endocannabinoid system ( ecs ) is involved in many physiological processes including metabolism , inflammation , pain , and neurotransmission ( de petrocellis and di marzo , 2009 ; pandey et al. , 2009 ) .
it consists of endogenous cannabinoids ( ec ) , cannabinoid receptors ( cbr ) , and ec metabolizing enzymes ( de petrocellis and di marzo , 2009 ; pertwee et al. , 2010 ) .
two major cbrs are identified : cbr type 1 ( cb1r ) and cbr type 2 ( cb2r ; howlett et al. , 2002 ) .
cb1r are mainly expressed in the central nervous system ( cns ) and a variety of non - neural peripheral tissues , including the vasculature and gut ( pertwee and ross , 2002 ) .
cb2r are primarily expressed on immune cells but are also identified in selected cns areas and some peripheral tissues ( klein , 2005 ) .
recently another g protein - coupled receptor , gpr55 , has garnered much attention due to its activation by ec and its impact on the immune system ( pertwee , 2007 ; yang et al. , 2016a ) .
increasing evidence shows that enhanced ec levels occur during systemic inflammation , such as in sepsis or following a cns injury .
manipulation of the ecs may have therapeutic effects in inflammatory disorders .
in this review , we will focus on modulation of cb2 and gpr55 receptors on immune response in two inflammatory disorders , sepsis , and cns injury .
both sepsis and cns injury cause the immune system to go through rather rapid and dramatic changes from pro - to anti - inflammatory phases , which may end up costing patients their life .
we suggest that the common mechanism for modulating and ultimately controlling the response of the immune system can be achieved through delicate interplay between the endocannabinoid , central nervous and immune systems .
ecs in sepsis sepsis is defined as a life - threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection ( singer et al. , 2016 ) .
an initial infection with the ensuing systemic inflammatory response becomes amplified , resulting in excessive release of both pro - and anti - inflammatory mediators , causing multi - organ dysfunction , failure , and death ( kleinpell et al. , 2006 ; singer et al. , 2016 ) .
recently , the ecs has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment due to its immune modulatory functions .
the effect of modulation of cb1r , cb2r , and gpr55 in sepsis - induced systemic inflammation will be described below .
cb1r cannabinoid receptors type 1 are mainly pre - synaptic receptors in axon terminals and their activation causes post - synaptic inhibition by preventing neurotransmitter release ( chevaleyre et al. , 2006 ; ladak et al. , 2011 ) .
manipulating the activity of cb1r at critical periods may play a therapeutic role in sepsis .
studies have suggested that pre - synaptic cb1r activation on autonomic nerves and vascular walls exacerbates the hypotension associated with septic shock through neurogenic mechanisms ( godlewski et al. , 2004 ) .
however , studies using cb1r knockout mice subjected to endotoxemia showed acute hypotension indicating that other mechanisms are also responsible for hypotension during systemic inflammatory conditions ( batkai et al. , 2004 ) .
in a lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) induced experimental sepsis model , we demonstrated that inhibition of cb1r by its antagonist , am281 , significantly reduced leukocyte activation and improved intestinal microcirculation ( kianian et al. , 2014 ) and iris microcirculation ( kelly et al. , 2010 ; al - banna et al. , 2013 ) .
however , the exact mechanisms of cb1r action in sepsis and septic shock are not yet completely understood and further studies are still required .
cb2r cannabinoid receptors type 2 are primarily expressed on immune cells and represent an ideal target for immune modulation ( klein , 2005 ) .
cb2r are gi - protein coupled receptors and signal primarily through regulating camp levels depending on the duration of activation of the receptor ( rinaldi - carmona et al. , 1998 ; borner et al. , 2009 ; basu and dittel , 2011 ) .
cb2r also signal through the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway by regulating the three major kinases : the extracellular signal - regulated protein kinases ( erk ) , p .
38 , and c - jun nh2 - terminal kinases ( basu and dittel , 2011 ) .
both of these major signaling pathways play important roles in cb2r - mediated immune modulating functions including effects on leukocyte activation , migration , proliferation , apoptosis , and cytokine production ( basu and dittel , 2011 ) .
in general , cb2r activation has shown an immune suppressive action , which can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis .
a variety of in vitro studies have shown contradictory results in terms of modulation of the immune response , mainly due to the use of non - selective cannabinoids ( miller and stella , 2008 ) .
some studies have shown that cannabinoids enhanced leukocyte proliferation in a dose dependent manner ( derocq et al. , 1995 ; carrier et al. , 2004 ) , while other studies have shown inhibitory effects on leukocyte proliferation through the activation of the cb2r ( maresz et al. , 2007 ; basu and dittel , 2011 ) .
this inhibition maybe mediated by cb2r - dependent promotion of apoptosis in dendritic cells , splenocytes , and thymocytes , with some diminished activity when cb2r antagonists are used ( basu and dittel , 2011 ) .
additional evidence also supports the role of cb2r in the promotion of apoptosis .
for example , administration of the cb2r agonist , jwh - 015 , induced apoptosis in thymocytes and diminished the proliferative potential of t cells and b cells ( lombard et al. , 2007 ) .
administration of the cb2r antagonist , am630 , showed a reversal of the induction of t cell apoptosis by jwh - 133 ( another cb2r agonist ) , strongly implicating a cb2r dependent mechanism ( singh et al. , 2012 ) .
this evidence suggests that activation of cb2r may promote immune resolution by inducing apoptosis of immune cells , therefore minimizing excessive damage of the pro - inflammatory cascade that occurs early on in sepsis .
using an experimental sepsis model , we demonstrated that activation of cb2r by the selective cb2r agonist , hu308 , significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion in the microvasculature ( lehmann et al. , 2012 ) .
administration of ec degradation enzyme inhibitors , such as urb597 and jzl184 , also decreased leukocyte activation in endotoxemic animals ( sardinha et al. , 2014 ) .
however , reduced leukocyte activation by jzl184 is still present in endotoxemic cb2r knockout mice , suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved in the ecs - mediated immune regulation in sepsis .
cytokine production by immune cells plays a critical role in the inflammatory response and can be modulated through cb2r .
multiple pro - inflammatory cytokines , such as tnf - alpha , interleukin ( il ) - 1beta , and il - 6 , are released in the early stages of the septic cascade .
however , activation of the cb2r by its agonist hu308 reduced plasma levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines in endotoxemic rats ( lehmann et al. , 2012 ) .
administration of the ec , anandamide , decreased the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines il - 12 and il - 23 in vitro in activated microglial cells ( correa et al. , 2009 ) .
in addition , t cell activation and release of il - 2 were inhibited by administration of the cb2r agonist , jwh - 015 , and this effect was eliminated by administration of the cb2r antagonist , am630 ( borner et al. , 2009 ) .
it was also demonstrated that activation of cb2r by hu308 enhanced the release of il - 10 , a prominent anti - inflammatory cytokine , suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of cb2r ( klein , 2005 ) .
gpr55 gpr55 was initially described as a novel cannabinoid receptor or putative " cb3 " receptor due to its high affinity to cannabinoid ligands such as delta9 - thc , 2 - ag , anandamide , and rimonabant , independent of the presence of cb1r and cb2r ( sawzdargo et al. , 1999 ; begg et al. , 2005 ; pertwee , 2007 ; ryberg et al. , 2007 ) .
however , the limited sequence similarity between gpr55 and cbr does not support this concept ( baker et al. , 2006 ) .
unlike the classical cb1r and cb2r signaling pathway , gpr55 is coupled to galpha12 and galpha13 proteins , signaling through ras homolog gene family member a , rho - associated protein kinase and phospholipase c pathway activation .
increased intracellular ca2 + is followed to activate rhoa , rac , and cdc42 , thereby phosphorylating erk , resulting in modulation of leukocyte chemotaxis , proliferation , and cytokine production ( ryberg et al. , 2007 ; henstridge et al. , 2009 ) .
gpr55 is widely expressed in the cns , immune system , and peripheral tissues and is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes ( ryberg et al. , 2007 ; henstridge et al. , 2011 ) .
in the immune system , gpr55 is highly expressed in the spleen and leukocytes , and its role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses suggests a potential therapeutic effect for sepsis ( staton et al. , 2008 ; lin et al. , 2011 ; schicho and storr , 2012 ; stancic et al. , 2015 ) .
gpr55 acts as an essential regulator in innate immunity via stimulatory effects in neutrophils , mast cells , monocytes , and natural killer ( nk ) cells ( balenga et al. , 2011 ; cantarella et al. , 2011 ; schicho et al. , 2011 ; chiurchiu et al. , 2015 ) .
gpr55 on nk cells and monocytes increase pro - inflammatory cytokines , cell cytotoxicity , and decrease monocyte - mediated endocytosis upon activation by lps ( chiurchiu et al. , 2015 ) .
gpr55 expression was increased in the gi tract during sepsis ( lin et al. , 2011 ) and gpr55 knockout mice showed least severe intestinal inflammation in comparison to cb1r or cb2r knockout mice in experimental colitis ( schicho and storr , 2012 ) .
in studies using adjuvant - induced inflammation , inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia by freund 's complete adjuvant was absent in gpr55 knockout mice with increased levels of il - 4 , il - 10 , and ifn - gamma ( staton et al. , 2008 ) .
importantly , gpr55 antagonist , cid16020046 , diminished inflammation in experimental colitis by reducing the levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 6 , and impairing leukocyte activation and migration ( stancic et al. , 2015 ) .
in our laboratory , we demonstrated that gpr55 antagonists , cid16020046 , and o - 1918 , reduced lps - induced leukocyte - endothelial interactions in experimental models of sepsis in mice ( yang et al. , 2016b ) .
gpr55 pharmacology with regards to ligand affinity and activity has been controversial in the current literature due to ligand - and concentration - specific biased signaling ( henstridge et al. , 2010 ; zeng et al. , 2015 ) .
gpr55 can form heteromers with cb1r or cb2r to elicit different pathways via ligand - and concentration - specific crosstalk ( balenga et al. , 2011 , 2014 ; kargl et al. , 2012 ; martinez - pinilla et al. , 2014 ) .
heteromers of cb1r and gpr55 are reported in cns ( martinez - pinilla et al. , 2014 ) and human embryonic kidney cell lines ( kargl et al. , 2012 ) .
cb1r inhibits gpr55 signaling when they are co - expressed on a cell ( kargl et al. , 2012 ) .
cross - interaction between gpr55 and cb2r modulates partner receptor mediated signaling .
co - expression of cb2r with gpr55 reduces gpr55 agonist - mediated activation of transcription factors , whereas cb2 receptor - mediated signaling was inhibited by co - expression with gpr55 ( balenga et al. , 2014 ) .
gpr55 - cb2r crosstalk in neutrophils was demonstrated by the finding that gpr55 activation led to augmented neutrophil chemotaxis and reduced cb2r - mediated tissue injury in the site of inflammation , suggesting a possible cellular mechanism of gpr55 - mediated immune cell modulation ( balenga et al. , 2011 ) .
consequently , further investigations on ligand - specific signaling pathways are required to develop a specific pharmacological target for precise and designated immune modulation .
ecs in cns injury central nervous system injury includes traumatic brain injury , stroke , cerebral aneurysms , and spinal cord injuries .
survivors from acute cns injury often have complications due to infections .
the incidence of fatal infections is linked to severity of cns injury and the status of immune system ( klehmet et al. , 2009 ; shim and wong , 2016 ) .
following acute cns injury , cell death occurs at the primary site and cytotoxins are released , which trigger significant secondary cell death outside the original injury area .
in addition , function of the blood brain barrier is impaired , allowing systemic inflammatory mediators and cells to enter the normally protected cns tissue , leading to the pathology of a cns injury , i.e. , neuroinflammation .
the level of neuroinflammation is highly dependent on the severity , duration , and the anatomical context of the cns injury .
to prevent the excessive action of pro - inflammatory cytokines after their initial beneficial effects , the immune system releases several anti - inflammatory mediators , such as il - 10 and il - 1 receptor antagonist and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors .
this begins a cascade of compensatory anti - inflammatory response .
onset of an acute cns injury also activates immunoinhibitory pathways , leading to a systemic brain - mediated immunosuppression to minimize secondary damage to healthy cns tissue ( meisel et al. , 2005 ; haeusler et al. , 2012 ) .
systemic immunosuppression is believed to be the main reason for infections , a leading cause of death in patients with acute cns injury .
this increased susceptibility to infections , due to impaired immune function after an acute cns injury , has been termed " cns injury - induced immunodeficiency syndrome " ( cids ; meisel et al. , 2005 ) .
since the discovery of the ecs , its effects on the brain have prompted queries into its potential physiological and pathological roles .
local ecs is activated following cns injury , representing an adaptive mechanism .
the primary ligands produced in the brain are anandamide and 2 - ag , which work on both cb1r and cb2r .
this may play a role in modulation of cns activity and regulation of the immune response after a cns injury ( mechoulam et al. , 1995 ; sugiura et al. , 1995 ; bisogno et al. , 1999 ) .
there are two different directions for the potential therapeutic use of cbr : neuroprotection and immunomodulation to reduce the cns damage and improve the outcome .
one of the potential ways the brain protects itself is by reducing its excitatory activity .
it is proposed that activation of presynaptic cb1r reduces the release of major excitatory neurotransmitters , such as glutamate ( coomber et al. , 2008 ) , which might be one of the earliest neuroprotective mechanisms deployed by the brain to prevent excitotoxicity .
this is further supported by studies that showed blocking cb1r activity increased the vulnerability of neurons to ischemic damage and disrupted neuronal maintenance ( schweitzer , 2000 ; hwang et al. , 2010 ) .
additionally , complete removal of the cb1r and associated signaling pathways causes an increase in susceptibility to ischemic damage , excitotoxin exposure , traumatic brain injury , and exacerbated inflammatory damage ( hillard , 2008 ) .
however , early inhibition of cb1r activation together with increased cb2r activation produces beneficial effects , such as a reduction of immune cells in cerebral vasculature , a reduction in infarct size , and an improved motor function after transient focal ischemia ( nagayama et al. , 1999 ; gilbert et al. , 2007 ; zhang et al. , 2007 ; adhikary et al. , 2011 ) .
the mechanism that may be related to the neuroprotective aspect of cb signaling is related to erk in response to tissue insults and involved in cell survival mechanisms ( scotter et al. , 2010 ) .
erk activation is coupled to the presence of cb1r in hippocampal regions ( marsicano et al. , 2003 ) , suggesting that cb signaling is part of the compensatory response to cns injury .
neuronal maintenance aspects of cb signaling seem to involve mapk .
experimental support for this notion comes from studies that showed treating the hippocampal tissue with cb1r antagonist am281 blocked erk activation through mapk kinase and led to a compromised neuronal survival ( karanian et al. , 2005a ) .
on the other hand , activating the cb1r and promoting cell survival also showed the neuroprotective action of the ecs through erk activity ( jiang et al. , 2005 ) .
cannabidiol , a main non - psychoactive component of cannabis , is suggested to exhibit some of its neuroprotective properties via inhibition of ec deactivation or even through its effects on vanilloid and 5 - ht receptors ( mishima et al. , 2005 ; alvarez et al. , 2008 ; pazos et al. , 2013 ) .
other studies have shown that anandamide , 2 - ag , thc , and synthetic agonists of cb1r also exhibit similar neuroprotective effects ( nagayama et al. , 1999 ; panikashvili et al. , 2001 ) .
endogenous anandamide showed neuroprotective properties in the developing brain through cb1r activity ( van der stelt et al. , 2001 ; shouman et al. , 2006 ) .
administration of 2 - ag to animals with cns injury reduced brain edema , infarct volume , and hippocampal cell death , and improved behavioral scores , suggesting better recovery ( shohami et al. , 1997 ; panikashvili et al. , 2006 ) .
the excitotoxic protective property of ecs activation has been reversed by administration of cb1r and cb2r antagonists , am281 and am630 , respectively .
other cb1r antagonists , such as sr - 141716a have been shown to reduce or completely abolish the neuroprotective properties of ec signaling in transient global cerebral ischemia ( nagayama et al. , 1999 ; marsicano et al. , 2002 ) .
despite piling evidence suggesting the neuroprotective role of ecs , inconsistent results and outcomes are produced .
the inconsistency is due to various factors , such as the delicacy of the physiological conditions , their severity , the timing of the pathologic development of a cns injury and the pharmacological intervention .
therefore , careful consideration needs to be given to pharmacological modulation of ecs via cbr in terms of dosage and timing of administration , otherwise the results may be counterproductive or even harmful .
enhancing ec actions by targeting its degradation represents an alternative therapeutic approach and has shown promising results in neuroprotection .
the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase ( faah ) is responsible for anandamide breakdown .
pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockout of faah promotes neuronal maintenance and function ( hwang et al. , 2010 ; celorrio et al. , 2016 ) .
block of anandamide transport with am404 promotes cb1r signaling and enhances protection against excitotoxicity in hippocampal slices ( karanian et al. , 2005b ) .
moreover , monoacylglycerol lipase ( magl ) hydrolyzes 2 - ag to generate a major arachidonate precursor pool for neuroinflammatory prostaglandins , and is suggested as a potential drug target in neurodegenerative disease ( nomura et al. , 2011 ; fernandez - suarez et al. , 2014 ) .
although there is no direct evidence suggesting the benefit of magl inhibition after cns injury , we can speculate that the involved pathways could be targeted to suppress proinflammatory cascades , which arise after an acute cns injury and contribute to exacerbated cns damage .
due to the changes in the immune status after an acute cns injury and the onset of cids , cb2r expression profile on immune cells and other non - neuronal cells suggested a potential theoretical association between the detrimental effects of cns injury and cb2r activity .
the immune impairment could potentially be modulated through the activity of the cb2r , ultimately making the patient susceptible to common infections and worsening the outcome .
in general , cb2r agonists attenuate the inflammatory response by inhibiting production of pro - inflammatory mediators , decreasing immune cell chemotaxis and reducing extravasation in the vulnerable cns ( shohami et al. , 2011 ; sardinha et al. , 2014 ) .
multiple studies have shown cb2r activation to be associated with neuroprotection and even improved blood brain barrier function ( ramirez et al. , 2012 ) .
while many studies have established that the cb2r activation initiates immunosuppressive mechanisms and potentially limits neuroinflammation ( benito et al. , 2008 ) , others have suggested that the time - course of cb2r activity may hold the solution by avoiding the negative effects of neuroprotective immunosuppression , while still receiving the neuroprotective aspects of reduced neuroinflammation ( lehmann et al. , 2014 ) .
specifically , it is suggested that the inhibition of cb2r that is done too early could potentially increase the size of cns injury , as the proinflammatory cascades and neutrophil infiltration will continue to develop .
in our laboratory , we have demonstrated inhibition of cb2r by the selective antagonist , am 630 , significantly increased immune function as indicated by an increased leukocyte adherence to endothelia in animals challenged with lps after hypoxia - ischemia ( hi ) - induced cns injury .
the cb2r inhibition did not affect the magnitude of infarct size in the injured brain ( burkovskiy et al. , 2016 ) .
this outlines both the complexity of the cns injury pathology , as well as the associated ecs signaling pathways , which remain to be fully explored .
conclusion although it has been shown that the ecs plays a vital role in the function of the immune system , controversial results exist for its regulatory role in sepsis , mainly due to the variety of methods employed to activate the receptors and the lack of truly selective ligands .
in addition , in vivo studies using cb2r knockout mice showed conflicting results , which might be attributed to the complexity of the inflammatory models used in mimicking a septic state .
there is a growing body of evidence for a pro - inflammatory role of gpr55 in sepsis , suggesting that selective gpr55 antagonists have a potential as a modulators of the immune response , and can be designed as a therapeutic target in sepsis. with regards to the role of the ecs following cns injury one may feel that cannabinoid signaling entails the " magic bullet " approach to many of the detrimental impairments associated with cns injury .
however , not all aspects of cannabinoid signaling have been fully explored and extensive pre - clinical testing is essential to find the correct ligand ( or combination of ligands ) .
moreover , many of the studies have demonstrated a close association between ecs activity and improved functional outcome , reduced neurotoxicity , reduced infarct volume , and other beneficial effects .
while this definitely suggests a bright future for this field , potential detrimental effects of ecs modulation need to be studied in more detail to prevent unwanted side effects .

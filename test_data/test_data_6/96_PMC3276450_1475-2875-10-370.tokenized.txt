background in malaria endemic areas , individuals are frequently asymptomatic and may be undetected by conventional microscopy or newer , rapid diagnostic tests .
molecular techniques allow a more accurate assessment of this asymptomatic parasite burden , the extent of which is important for malaria control .
this study examines the relative prevalence of sub - microscopic level parasite carriage and clonal complexity of infections ( multiplicity of infection ) over a range of endemicities in a region of north - eastern tanzania where altitude is an established proxy of malaria transmission .
the pcr prevalence was then compared against other measures of transmission intensity collected in the same area .
methods this study used 1,121 blood samples collected from a previously conducted cross - sectional malario - metric survey during the short rainy season in 2001 from 13 villages ( three at < 600 m , four at 600 - 1,200 m and six at > 1,200 m in altitude above sea level ) .
samples were analysed by pcr for carriage of parasites and multiplicity of infection .
these data were compared with other measures of transmission intensity collected from the same area .
results parasite prevalence was 34.7 % by pcr and 13.6 % by microscopy ; a 2.5 - fold difference in line with other recent observations .
this fold difference was relatively consistent at the different altitude bands despite a marked decrease in parasite prevalence with altitude : < 600 m 70.9 vs 28.6 , 600 - 1,200 m 35.5 vs 9.9 , > 1,200 m 15.8 vs 5.9 .
the difference between parasite prevalence by pcr was 3.2 in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years ( 34.5 vs 10.9 ) compared with 2.5 in those aged 1 - 5 ( 34.0 vs 13.5 ) though this was not statistically significant .
multiplicity of infection ( moi ) ranged from 1.2 to 3.7 and was positively associated with parasite prevalence assessed by both pcr and microscopy .
there was no association of moi and age .
village level pcr parasite prevalence was strongly correlated with altitude , sero - conversion rate and predicted entomological inoculation rate .
conclusions asymptomatic , low density , multi - clone malaria infection was common in this study area .
these infections are important as potential contributors to the infectious reservoir of parasites and need to be identified by control programmes especially in this era where malaria elimination is a focus .
high throughput standardized pcr approaches are needed to identify individuals who are malaria carriers .
background microscopy is routinely used for malaria diagnosis and epidemiological studies [ 1,2 ] .
however , it has limitations due to the subjective nature and sensitivity of slide reading and its time - consuming nature when carrying out studies involving a large number of individuals [ 1,3 - 5 ] .
there is an increase in the use of rapid diagnostic tests ( rdts ) that are based on detection of parasite antigens , although they too have limitations related to sensitivity and discriminating current from recent infections [ 2 ] .
molecular diagnostic tools , such as those based on pcr , have 10 - 100 greater sensitivity compared to microscopy and have been used increasingly for assessing infection [ 4 - 6 ] .
in malaria endemic areas , asymptomatic malaria parasite carriers especially adults are not uncommon and , as potential gametocyte carriers , represent an important reservoir for malaria transmission [ 7 ] .
many of these asymptomatic infections are present at densities below the limit for microscopic detection and , therefore , use of microscopy is likely to lead to underestimation of the malaria burden .
indeed , in a meta - analysis of community - based studies that use pcr detection of parasites , okell et al showed that microscopy only detected 50 % of the infections identified by pcr [ 8 ] .
this current study was conducted in order to examine the relationship between pcr and microscopy in a defined geographical area where altitude has been shown to be a proxy for malaria transmission intensity [ 9 ] .
risk factors for pcr carriage were examined at the individual and village level and the correlations between pcr prevalence and other measures of transmission intensity were examined .
methods study site and sample collection the study area , study design , and sampling have been described elsewhere with parasitological , haematological , serological and entomological measures all demonstrating malaria transmission intensity decreases with altitude [ 9 - 11 ] .
briefly , the study area is based in north - eastern tanzania and runs from kilimanjaro , through the eastern arc pare and usambara mountains to tanga on the coastal plain .
malaria prevalence has been shown to decrease with altitude and with distance from the coast , which is linked to average annual precipitation .
in 2001 , cross - sectional surveys were conducted during the short rainy season ( october to november 2001 ) and finger - prick blood samples were collected into edta - coated tubes from an age - stratified sample of approximately 250 people from each of 13 villages ( figure 1 ) from three different age groups : 0 - 4 ( n = 80 ) , 5 - 14 ( n = 80 ) and 15 - 45 ( n = 90 ) years old .
the villages were situated at differing altitudes and in transects selected to be as similar as possible in terms of ethnic group , socio - economic status and accessibility to health care .
full details of demographic and clinical procedures can be found in drakeley et al [ 9 ] .

the villages in red were selected for analysis in this study .
those in the kilimanjaro region include : mokala , machame aleni , ikuini , kileo ( rombo transect ) , bwambo , mpinji , lower goha , kadando ( south pare transect ) and those in the tanga region include : kwadoe , funta , tamota , mgila ( west usambara transect ) , and mgome ( tanga coast ) .
for pcr analysis , samples were chosen at random from the 13 villages to include a minimum of 60 samples from each village , with 20 from each of three age groups : 0 - 4 , 5 - 14 and 15 - 45 years old .
a total of 1,121 samples were analysed for the carriage of plasmodium falciparum using nested pcr parasite .
prevalence by microscopy had been determined previously and results published in drakeley et al [ 9 ] .
dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction dna was extracted from the archived , pelleted samples , using nucleon kit protocol for dna extraction according to manufacturer instructions http :// www.tepnel.com .
a nested pcr was used to amplify species - specific sequences of the small sub - unit ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( 18s ssu rrna ) genes of p. falciparum as described [ 12,13 ] .
dna from the culture of p. falciparum ( 3d7 strain ) as a positive control , dna from blood samples of an individual never exposed to malaria as a negative control , and no template as a negative control , were included in each set of pcr for quality control .
the pcr was carried out in a tetrad thermo - cycler ( ptc - 0240 , the dna engine tetrad2 ( r ) thermal cycler , bio - rad , hercules , california , usa ) , followed by gel electrophoresis to assign individuals as either parasite positive or negative .
moi genotyping nested pcr was carried out to determine the numbers of msp2 ( fc27 and ic / 3d7 ) clones .
to amplify dna , a primer pair corresponding to the outer conserved region of the polymorphic repetitive block 3 of msp2 was used .
then the pcr product was re - amplified in a pair of reactions using primers specific for fc27 and ic / 3d7 allelic types of msp2 as described by snounou et al [ 14 ] .
number of products , corresponding to number of infecting fc27 and ic / 3d7 clones , was counted after visualization on ethidium bromide ( etbr ) stained 2.5 and 1.5 % agarose gel , respectively .
data analysis the difference in pcr - based parasite prevalence in different villages was assessed by using chi - square and logistic regression to determine the association of parasite prevalence by pcr with different predictors as independent variables , such as age , distance from the coast ( a crude proxy for rainfall ) and altitude .
pcr prevalence and moi were examined for correlation with altitude , sero - conversion rate ( scr ) for age related acquisition of antibodies to apical membrane antigen - 1 ( ama - 1 )[ 15 ] and measured and extrapolated entomological inoculation rate ( eir ) [ 15 ] that had been collected previously .
regression analysis was conducted in stata using the ' svy ' function to allow for stratified analysis with village as the primary sampling unit .
ethical considerations ethical clearance was obtained from the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine ( lshtm ) , kilimanjaro christian medical centre , tanzania ( kcmc ) and the tanzanian national medical research institute ( nimr ) .
results microscopy and pcr results the comparison between the 1,116 samples with both pcr and microscopy results is shown in table 1. of these , 62.8 % were negative and 9.2 % positive by both methods , however , pcr identified more parasite - positive individuals than microscopy : 34.4 vs 12.0 % respectively .
thirty - one of 1,116 ( 2.7 %) samples were positive by microscopy but negative by pcr ; the majority of these samples ( 22 ) had parasite densities <= 80 parasites / mul .
the samples that were microscopy positive but p. falciparum negative by pcr were analysed for other species .
two of the samples were plasmodium malariae positive .

the positive and negative predictive values were 78.4 % ( 105 / 134 ) and 71.2 % ( 699 / 982 ) .
comparison between microscopic and pcr parasite prevalence in the study area the 2.5 - fold difference in the prevalence of parasitaemia by pcr compared to microscopy is in line with other recent observations .
the difference was observed in all villages at different altitudes ( table 2 and figure 2 ) and was relatively consistent at the different altitude bands despite a marked decrease in parasite prevalence with altitude : < 600 m 70.9 vs 28.6 , 600 - 1,200 m 35.5 vs 9.9 , > 1,200 m 15.8 vs 5.9 .
the difference between parasite prevalence by pcr was 3.2 in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years ( 34.5 vs 10.9 ) compared with 2.5 in those aged 1 - 5 ( 34.0 vs 13.5 ) , though this was not statistically significant .
the highest prevalence was observed in the middle ( 5 - 14 years ) age group and was lowest in adults ( 15 - 45 years ) ( table 3 ) .

a total of 117 samples were analysed for mixed infections by pcr , 12 % of individuals had co - infections of p. falciparum and either p. malariae or p. ovale , and all were from lowlands .
none of the samples analysed was plasmodium vivax .
the majority of samples ( 85.7 %) with mixed infection were of p. falciparum and p. malariae .
six samples had plasmodium ovale infection and out of these , four samples had mixed infection of p. falciparum , p. malariae and p. ovale .
factors related to carriage of sub - microscopic parasites in the study area after excluding individuals who were microscopically parasite positive , a total of 982 individuals were further involved in the analysis using logistic regression .
in uni - variate logistic regression ( table 4 ) , residents in the tanga region were five - fold more likely to carry sub - microscopic parasites ( or , 5.00 [ 95 % ci , 3.72 - 6.73 ] ; p < 0.0001 ) .
this was also apparent within the tanga region with both west usambara and tanga coast ( mgome village ) transects , which were associated with increased carriage of sub - microscopic parasites ; the magnitude being approximately four - fold ( or , 4.46 [ 95 % ci , 0.88 - 22.49 ] ; p = 0.067 ) and more than ten - fold ( or , 23.86 [ 95 % ci , 7.00 - 81.29 ] ; p < 0.0001 ) respectively .
analysis based on altitude band , regardless of region , indicated that individuals living in areas where the altitude was 600 m - 1,200 m ( or , 0.28 [ 95 % ci , 0.08 - 1.01 ] ; p = 0.052 ) and above 1,200 m ( or , 0.10 [ 95 % ci , 0.02 - 0.43 ] ; p = 0.005 ) were less likely to carry sub - microscopic parasites as compared to individuals living in the area of < 600 m. use of bednets , sex , fever and treatment were not associated with sub - microscopic parasite carriage in individuals ( p > 0.05 ) .

individuals with sub - microscopic parasites had significantly lower mean haemoglobin levels ( 11.4 vs 12.1 g / dl respectively , f = 19.2 p < 0.0001 ) , suggestive of longer term or chronic infections .
however , an interaction with of other factors ( such as iron deficiency anaemia , helminth infections , hiv , red blood cell polymorphisms ) that are associated with decreased levels of haemoglobin cannot be ruled out .
no significant difference in prevalence of sub - microscopic parasites was seen between the sexes or in those who reported fever or recent anti - malarial treatment .
multiplicity of infection ( moi ) the results showed that the majority of pcr positive subjects carried multiple strains ; 76.2 % ( 189 / 248 ) .
the moi in pcr positive samples was significantly higher in high transmission / low altitude area ( p = 0.025 ) .
there was no significant association between age and moi ( p > 0.05 ) .
the distribution of msp2 allelic families with more than one clone , differed between the two allelic families ; 46.8 % ( 116 / 248 ) of parasites from 3d7 / ic , 37.9 % ( 94 / 248 ) of parasites from fc27 and 55.6 % ( 138 / 248 ) of clones from both allelic families .
the use of different measures to correlate malaria and transmission intensity comparison of the different measures of transmission intensity ( table 5 , figure 2 ) indicates that all measures were strongly correlated .
relevant to this study , highly significant correlation co - efficients were observed between altitude and parasite rate by pcr and by microscopy , predicted eir and sero - conversion rate .

p - values are present in brackets discussion accurate quantification of the malaria parasite reservoir is important for control given the renewed focus on transmission reduction leading to elimination .
assessment of this reservoir by microscopy has limitations , and molecular techniques , largely based on the pcr , have been increasingly widely used to measure parasite prevalence .
in this study , samples were analysed from previously conducted malario - metric surveys in an area where there is a very broad range of transmission intensity , i.e. microscopic parasite rates ranging from 2 to 50 % and estimated entomological inoculation rates from < 1 to > 100 infectious bites per person per year .
this variation occurs in a relatively small geographical area within similar ethnic groups , such that a number of confounders are minimized .
overall , a 2.5 - fold higher parasite prevalence was observed with pcr compared to microscopy and this fold difference was consistent across the different transmission levels .
the scale of the difference described here compares well with the two - fold difference documented in the meta - analysis by okell and colleagues [ 8 ] and also from individual studies in cambodia [ 16 ] and solomon islands [ 17 ] .
the consistency of these observations on sub - microscopic parasitaemia suggests that this is a robust finding and one that has important implications for control measures .
a study by schneider et al [ 18 ] found that the contribution of sub - microscopic parasites to malaria transmission in individuals was similar to those individuals having microscopic gametocytes .
though gametocyte carriage was not assessed directly in this study , several studies document a high prevalence of concomitant gametocytes in individuals with asexual parasites ( e.g. [ 19 ]) .
although , gametocytes are likely to be present at lower densities [ 20 ] than asexual parasites , one interpretation of these observations is that using pcr for asexual parasites could be taken to equate to potential infectiousness .
other studies [ 21,22 ] have reported that sub - microscopic carriage differs in relation to transmission intensity and age .
strong correlations with malaria transmission intensity , as characterized by altitude and transect ( a proxy for rainfall which increases with increasing proximity to the indian ocean ) [ 9 ] were observed with carriage of sub - microscopic parasites .
on a micro - epidemiological level , differences were observed between villages that were similar in altitude and distance from the coast ( e.g. kadando and kileo ) showing that local factors that favour transmission will influence both microscopic and sub - microscopic parasite carriage .
similar findings have been encountered in the highlands in kenya [ 23,24 ] indicating that small differences in altitude and other factors can influence the ecological environments of mosquitoes .
in this study , older age was not associated with increased carriage of sub - microscopic parasites .
the reasons for this are not as obvious as one might expect that individuals with higher levels of immunity ( i.e. older ages ) would maintain parasites at lower densities [ 5,16 ] .
at the lowest transmission intensity ( highest altitude band ) individuals older than 15 were 3.0 times more likely to have sub - microscopic parasites than younger individuals ( chi sq 4.01 , p = 0.0425 ) but this was not significant in multi - variant analysis .
other individual level factors such as sex , history of fever and recent treatment were not associated with parasite carriage .
use of bed nets was found to be inconsistently protective against sub - microscopic carriage ; at higher transmission intensities where 50 % net users were pcr positive compared to 75 % of non net users at the lowest altitude , with the corresponding figures of 14 and 40 % in the middle altitude band .
however , the effect was not significant in stratified , multi - variate analysis .
the moi results reported in this study provide a rough estimate of the genetic diversity of msp2 , a polymorphic marker , and suggest diversity was pronounced .
multiple parasites genotypes in individuals living in endemic areas are frequently observed , as was the case in other studies in senegal [ 21,22 ] and ghana [ 25 ] .
a study in ghana indicated that moi increases the gaining of immunity and the ability to control parasitaemia and protection from subsequent clinical episodes [ 25 ] .
moi did not correlate to age ; similar findings observed in a more restricted age range of 2 - 10 years in senegal [ 22 ] .
sub - microscopic parasite carriage was strongly correlated with moi and other previously collected measures of transmission intensity such as parasite prevalence by microscopy , extrapolated eir and scr .
the relationship presented in table 5 is for the antigen ama - 1 and , the correlation between pcr prevalence and moi for merozoite surface protein - 1 is similarly strong ( 0.8525 , p = 0.0004 & 0.7716 , p = 0.017 respectively ) .
this is not surprising as microscopy and pcr parasite prevalence were highly correlated ( coefficient r2 = 0.9 , p < 0.001 ) and the relationship between microscopy and the other measures has been demonstrated previously [ 10 ] .
however , as pcr methodology becomes increasingly more widespread , it will be important to calibrate pcr prevalence across the full range of transmission intensity .
the observations made here and in other papers suggest that pcr prevalence will have a greater dynamic range than microscopy and thus will be an important parameter for assessing progress in low endemicity and pre - elimination settings .
conclusions this study shows that a large number of individuals carried sub - microscopic parasites in a malaria endemic area of tanzania .
these individuals are a potential reservoir of infection in the population .
there is , therefore , a need to further evaluate the burden of sub - microscopic parasites when considering elimination and eradication of malaria .
employing the multiplex pcr for the different species of plasmodium and also a more sensitive method , such as stevor pcr suggested elsewhere [ 5 ] , may be needed to resolve the discordant results of the conventional pcr and microscopy .

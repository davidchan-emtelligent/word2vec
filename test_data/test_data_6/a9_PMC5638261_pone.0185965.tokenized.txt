we propose an energy efficient combination design for ofdm systems based on selected mapping ( slm ) and clipping peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) reduction techniques , and show the related energy efficiency ( ee ) performance analysis .
the combination of two different papr reduction techniques can provide a significant benefit in increasing ee , because it can take advantages of both techniques .
for the combination , we choose the clipping and slm techniques , since the former technique is quite simple and effective , and the latter technique does not cause any signal distortion .
we provide the structure and the systematic operating method , and show the various analyzes to derive the ee gain based on the combined technique .
our analysis show that the combined technique increases the ee by 69 % compared to no papr reduction , and by 19.34 % compared to only using slm technique .

introduction increasing energy efficiency ( ee ) is a vital research topic in the current information technology ( it ) field for the reduction of system operational cost and environmental pollution [ 1 ] .
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a powerful signal transmission technique which is used for the most of the high data wireless signal transmission systems , and it is already adopted various standards including advanced television systems committee ( astc ) 3.0 , 3rd generation partnership project long term evolution ( 3gpp lte ) - a / pro , ieee 802.11 n / ax , and so on [ 2 , 3 ] .
one of the main problems posed by the ofdm is its high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) which seriously limits the energy efficiency of the signal transmission systems .
this is due to the fact that , to transmit a high papr signal such as ofdm , the input back - off ( ibo ) of the signal must be set high before the ofdm signal passes through the power amplifier ( pa ) to reduce both in - band distortion and out - of - band radiation .
the pa is the most power hungry device , and reducing the power consumption of the pa is quite important to increase the ee of the ofdm system. by placing a digital predistorter ( dpd ) in front of the pa , the linear dynamic range of the pa can be increased to a certain range [ 4 - 7 ] .
however , the dpd is an expensive device and the increment of the energy efficiency is rather limited .
for this reason , papr reduction techniques for increasing ee are also widely used .
since this problem is very important from a practical system perspective , many studies have been conducted so far [ 8 - 12 ] .
there are roughly two types of papr reduction techniques , distortion papr reduction techniques and distortionless papr reduction techniques .
the distortion papr reduction technique is a method of reducing the papr of the ofdm signal by distorting the signal .
usually this kind of technique is simple and effective but involves signal distortion .
clipping is one of the most common distortion papr reduction techniques .
the distortionless papr reduction technique reduces the papr of an ofdm signal without signal distortion .
usually this kind of technique can increase ee without signal distortion , but high computational complexity and delay are accompanied .
combining the distortion and distortionless papr reduction techniques , and choosing the appropriate parameters from there , are expected to increase ee more effectively .
in this paper , we show how to systematically combine the distortion and distortionless papr reduction technique .
for the distortion papr reduction technique , we choose clipping technique since it is the most common and widely used papr reduction technique .
for the distortionless papr reduction technique , we choose selected mapping ( slm ) technique , since it needs minimum or no additional resources that most of distortionless papr reduction technique requires .
the combination could enhance the advantages and compensate the disadvantages of each techniques .
we propose a structure and systematic operation of the combined technique , and show how much of ee gain can be expected based on analysis and numerical simulations using the proposed technique .
based on our analysis , it can be seen that the combined technique provide very high ee gain and can be applied to most of ofdm based signal transmission system .
there are several works related to the combination of slm and clipping [ 13 - 15 ] .
the previous works has more focused on introducing the method and performance analysis , while our work more focuses on systematic design and related operations .
we show how the combined method can work in practical situation in detail .
in what follows , in section 2 , we present a system description for the study of this paper .
we show the definition of papr and introduce each papr reduction technique , clipping and slm .
the definition of ee is also introduced for use as a metric in performance analysis .
in section 3 , we propose the combined technique and related apparatus , and show the systematic operation .
section 3 includes most of design process and methodology .
in section 4 , numerical analysis is shown to validate the proposed technique , and conclusion remarks are given in section 5 .
system description this section shows the definition of papr for ofdm and then shows clipping and slm papr reduction schemes .
the ee metric is also introduced to use in performance analysis .
papr of ofdm signal an ofdm signal of n subcarriers can be represented as x ( t )= 1nsumk = 0n - 1x [ k ] ej2pifkt,0 <= t <= ts ( 1 ) where ts is the duration of the ofdm signal and fk = kts .
the high papr of the ofdm signal arises from the summation in the above idft expression .
the papr of the ofdm signal in the analog domain can be represented as paprc = max0 <= t <= ts | x ( t )| 2e (| x ( t )| 2 ) ( 2 ) nonlinear distortion in pa occurs in the analog domain , but most of the signal processing for papr reduction is performed in the digital domain .
the papr of digital domain is not necessarily the same as the papr in the analog domain .
however , in some literature [ 16 , 17 ] , it is shown that one can closely approximate the papr in the analog domain by oversampling the signal in the digital domain .
usually , an oversampling factor l = 4 is sufficient to satisfactorily approximate the papr in the analog domain , and it is also used in this paper .
the oversampled ofdm signal can be represented as x ( n )= 1lnsumk = 0ln - 1x [ k ] ej2pink / ln,0 <= n <= ln , ( 3 ) then , we can express papr of the ofdm signal as follows .
papr = max0 <= n <= ln | x ( n )| 2e (| x ( n )| 2 ) .
( 4 ) to measure the papr performance , we usually use complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) and the ccdf of the nyquist sampling rate is shown as follows : pr ( papr > papr0 )=~ 1 - ( 1 - e - papr0 ) n .
( 5 ) where pr (.) represents the probablity , papr0 is the reference papr , and n is the number of subcarriers .
eq ( 5 ) can be derived on the assumption that the power of ofdm signal can be approximated by a central chi - square distribution with two degrees of freedom , and the ofdm samples are independent of each other , which is true in the case of a nyquist sampling rate .
however , ( 5 ) is not so useful from a practical system point of view , because it cannot capture the actual papr of continuous time ofdm signal .
for this reason , many continous time papr of ofdm ccdf models have been proposed .
in [ 18 ] , authors modified the eq ( 5 ) , and proposed continuous time papr using heuristic approach as : pr ( papr > papr0 )=~ 1 - ( 1 - e - papr0 ) alphan .
( 6 ) where alpha is the arbitrary adjustable parameter and it is known that alpha = 2.8 is a good choice for the approximation .
in [ 19 ] , authors presented more analytical approximation which can be represented as : pr ( papr > papr0 )=~ 1 - exp ( - pi.papr03ne - papr0 ) .
( 7 ) and another analytical approach was presented in [ 20 ] as : pr ( papr > papr0 )=~ 1 - exp ( - pi.lnn3ne - papr0 ) .
( 8 ) all of three approximations are well - matched with the ccdf of continuous time or l > 4 times oversampled ofdm signal .
papr reduction techniques in this subsection , we introduce each papr reduction technique , clipping and slm , and present the characteristics of the techniques .
the analysis of this subsection can be useful for the better understanding of the combined technique .
in this paper , we use 10mhz bandwidth with 1024 subcarriers for the ofdm signal .
clipping due to its simplicity and effectiveness , clipping is the most widely used as a papr reduction technique for the ofdm signal [ 21 ] .
however , clipping causes both in - band distortion and out - of - band radiation .
setting the clipping ratio high enough can negate the in - band distortion .
if the clipping ratio is relatively low , one usually recovers the performance degradation from in - band distortion using channel coding [ 22 ] .
the reconstruction technique of the clipped ofdm signal by adding additional complexity at the receiver has been also proposed [ 23 ] .
the output signal of clipping procedure , x ^( n ) can be expressed as follows : x ^( n )={ x ( n ),| x ( n )|<= amaxamaxejthetan ,| x ( n )|> amax , ( 9 ) where x ( n ) is the ofdm signal before clipping procedure , amax is the maximum allowable signal amplitude and thetan is the phase of ofdm signal .
the clipping level can be measured by using clipping ratio ( cr ) , nu which is expressed as follows [ 7 ] : nu = amaxpave , ( 10 ) where pave is the average input power of ofdm signal .
due to serious out - of - band radiation , filtering should be followed by clipping .
as a filtering technique , we use the frequency domain filtering ( fdf ) which was proposed in [ 17 ] .
figs 1 and 2 show the ccdf performance and probability density function ( pdf ) of clipping papr reduction technique. from fig 1 , it is obvious that if we decrease the cr , the ccdf performance becomes better , while we must bear the clipping distortion .
also , we can see from fig 2 , the amplitude distribution of the original ofdm signal has a rayleigh distribution , but the amplitude distribution of the clipped ofdm signal becomes closer to a uniform distribution as clipping amount increases .
the tremendous peak - regrowth after filtering can be reduced if we combine the caf ( clipping and filtering ) techniques with the slm technique which will be shown soon .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g002 fig 2 pdf of clipped ofdm signal amplitude .
the clipping papr reduction technique is a kind of distortion papr reduction technique which means reduce the papr of the signal based on signal distortion , so a relevant level of distortion is inevitable .
the clipping papr reduction technique is a nonlinear function and it is well - known in the literature that , for the linear receiver , any kind of nonlinear function can be represented based on bussgang theorem [ 24 ] : x ^( n )= alphax ( n )+ d ( n ) , ( 11 ) where d ( n ) is the distortion noise term due to clipping which is not related to x ( n ) , and alpha is the attenuation term due to clipping which can be represented as [ 22 ] : alpha = e [ x ( n )* x ^( n )] e [| x ( n )| 2 ]= 1 - e - ( nu ) 2 + pinu2erfc ( nu ) ( 12 ) where e [.] is the expectation operation , * is the complex conjugate operation , nu is the clipping ratio .
for ( 12 ) , we assumed there is no correlation between distortion noise term and signal term ( e ( x ( n )* d ( n )) = 0 ) .
the frequency representation of the clipping noise term d ( n ) can be written as d [ k ]= 1nsumn = 0n - 1d ( n ) e - j2pink / n .
( 13 ) as the number of subcarriers increases , d [ k ] approaches a complex gaussian random variable with a zero mean due to the central limit theorem .
according to parseval 's theorem , the expectation of the | d [ k ]| 2 , e (| d [ k ]| 2 ) also can be calculated in the time domain. from ( 9 ) , the amplitude of distortion noise | d ( n )| can be given by , | d ( n )|=| x ( n )| - amax ,| x ( n )|> amax , ( 14 ) since it is well - known that the amplitude of the ofdm signal , | x ( n )| has a rayleigh distribution , the average distortion power , e (| d ( n )| 2 ) can be expressed as follows : e (| d ( n )| 2 )= integralamaxinfinity ( r - amax ) 2p | x ( n )|( r ) dr , ( 15 ) where p | x ( n )|( r ) is the rayleigh probability density function ( pdf ) .
then , with normalized signal power assumption , ( 15 ) can be simplified as [ 25 ] , e (| d ( n )| 2 )= e - nu2 - pinu.erfc ( nu ) .
( 16 ) in the practical systems , due to the peak - regrowth , actual clipping ratio after filtering is usually much higher than clipping ratio we set .
for this reason , the analysis of this subsection does not directly applied to the real system , but should be modified based on adjustable factor .
we will show this in the following section .
selected mapping the slm technique is a kind of distrotionless papr reduction technique , and it reduces the papr of ofdm symbol by rotating phase of the ofdm symbol .
the slm technique makes several candidate phase sets from origianl ofdm symbol based on phase rotation , and choose the one which shows the best papr performance .
there are two representative phase rotation papr reduction techniques , slm [ 26 ] and partial transmission sequences ( pts ) [ 27 ]. between them , we choose slm , since both technique shows very much similar characteristics , but slm is easier to apply .
the block diagram of slm is shown in fig 3 .
the input data x is multiplied with various phase sets bi , i = 1 , 2 , ... , v , in frequency domain and generate v different time domain symbols , x ( i ) , i = 1 , 2 , ... , v. then , among v different symbols , the lowest papr symbol is chosen and send it to the receiver through the channel .
side information ( si ) is necessary to decode the signal block since the receiver must know which phase set was chosen at the transmitter .
because of the high priority of the si , it is usually heavily protected by channel coding [ 22 ] .
several blind techniques with additional complexity were also proposed [ 28 , 29 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g003 fig 3 block diagram of slm .
figs 4 and 5 show the ccdf of ofdm signal with slm technique , and pdf of ofdm signal amplitude with slm technique .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g004 fig 4 ccdf of ofdm signal with slm technique .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g005 fig 5 pdf of ofdm signal amplitude with slm technique .
as we can see from figs 4 and 5 , slm technique can successfully reduce the papr of ofdm signal without any signal distortion .
however , the complexity due to the generation of multiple signal sets could be a problem .
it is well - known in the literature that the ccdf of the slm - ofdm signal is represented as [ 27 ] pr ( papr > papr0 )=~( 1 - ( 1 - e - papr0 ) alphan ) v .
( 17 ) where v is the number of different phase sets .
in this paper , we multiply only two kinds of phases , 1 or - 1 and use a randomly generated phase sets. of course , the number of elements in the phase set is the same as the number of data in one block or length of ifft .
the number of phase sets , v should be chosen carefully between performance and complexity trade - off .
as v increases , the amount of the improvement of the papr reduction also increases .
simply increasing v causes high computational complexity and delay .
also , as increasing v , the performance improvement is rather limited .
as observed from fig 4 , if v is larger than 32 , there is only a slight performance improvement .
this is also one of the motivations for using combined technique .
energy efficiency in this subsection , we define the ee metric for the performance analysis .
the ee is usually expressed as : ee = se / pr , ( 18 ) where se is the achievable rate in bit per second per hz , and pr is the related power consumption .
for simplicity , we only consider pa power consumption , ppa and vlsi power consumption for the computation of ifft , pi. then , the pr can be divided into two parts as : pr = ppa + pi , ( 19 ) it is obvious that there are another power consumption components that can affect to the ee. however , the rest of power consumption components have little effect on the ee comparison of the proposed structure and conventional structure .
the relationship between tx power , ptx , and ppa can be expressed as follows [ 30 ] : ptx = etappa , ( 20 ) where eta is the pa efficiency .
eta can be changed depending on the pa type we use .
i.e. , class - a , class - b , class - ab , doherty pa and so on. using different pa can affect the energy efficiency , but the design logic of combined papr reduction scheme is not changed .
for example , in the case of class b pa , the eta is defined as [ 30 ] : eta (%)= pi4px100 , ( 21 ) where p is the square - root of input back - off ( ibo ) , ibo .
ibo is the ratio of the maximum allowable input power or satuartion input power of pa , pmax and the average power of input signal pave [ 10 , 30 ] : ibo ( db )= 10log10 ( pmaxpave ) , ( 22 ) increasing ibo reduces distortion , but also reduces power efficiency .
the eta heavily depends on the papr of ofdm signal , and the papr of ofdm signal also depends on the system bandwidth and / or the number of subcarriers [ 30 ]. from figs 1 and 5 , we already witnessed that the papr of ofdm signal with no papr reduction is around 11.7db from the 10 - 3 of the ccdf .
for the computation of pi , first we need to define the giga floating - point operations per second ( gflop ) for the ifft which can be represented as [ 31 - 33 ] : zeta ( gflop )=( tub ) ts.log2 ( tub ) , ( 23 ) the system parameters are shown in table 1 .
we took the parameters from the current 3gpp lte system .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.t001 table 1 system parameters .

( 24 ) where epsilon is the vlsi efficiency which can be represented as gflop / w. here w represents the watt .
in this paper , we assume epsilon = 5gflop / w. now , we should derive the achievable se to get the ee metric in ( 18 ) .
the received signal at the receiver , y ( n ) can be represented as : y ( n )= rhoh ( n ) x ^( n )+ w ( n )= rhoh ( n ) alphax ( n )+ rhoh ( n ) d ( n )+ w ( n ) .
( 25 ) where rho is the received power , w ( n ) is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , and h ( n ) is the channel coefficient which can be decomposed as h ( n )= g ( n ). xi ( n ) , ( 26 ) where g ( n ) is the zero - mean and unit variance i.i.d. rayleigh fading channel coefficient , and xi ( n ) is the path loss component .
then from ( 26 ) , we can derive the signal to noise and distortion ratio ( sndr ) as follows : gamma = rhoxi2 ( n ) e [| alphax ( n )| 2 ] rhoxi2 ( n ) e [| d ( n )| 2 ]+ e (| w ( n )| 2 ) ( 27 ) the approximated achievable rate can be represented as : se =~ kappa.e [ log2 ( 1 + gamma )] , ( 28 ) where kappa =( tsl - tptsl ).( tuts ) is the scaling factor for the pilot overhead and guard interval .
in this paper , we assume the pilot overhead is 4.8 % from 3gpp lte system .
finally , ee can be defined as ee = kappa.e [ log2 ( 1 + gamma )]( ppa + pi ) .
( 29 ) we will use ( 29 ) as the metric for the performance analysis .
design methodology for the combination of slm and clipping in this section , we show the energy efficient design methodology using the combination of slm and clipping technique .
as mentioned , the combination of slm and clipping technique could improve ee performance .
we recommend placing the slm before clipping , because it can reduce clipping distortion and peak re - growth after filtering .
combination of slm and clipping technologies were already discussed in several literatures [ 13 , 14 ] .
however , there is no literature to introduce the design methodology and show the ee gain of the combined scheme .
there are several benefits by using clipping and slm together. that is , we can choose between two policies that minimize distortion and minimize power consumption .
if there is a target papr that signal can pass safely through the nonlinear devices such as pa and digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) , we should choose appropriate v and cr , nu for the target papr .
to minimize distortion , we should use high v and high cr , nu. conversely , to minimize power consumption , we should choose low v and low cr , nu. also out - of - band radiation can be significantly reduced by using the combined technique .
it is another benefit that we can choose ee / se performance - - complexity trade - off .
fig 6 shows proposed papr reduction apparatus that uses slm and clipping technique .
the policy determination unit determines whether the system will pursuit distortion minimization or power consumption minimization .
based on the information , central power management unit determines the allowable power and computational delay to be used for the slm technique .
usually the power consumption of caf is almost fixed if the iterative technique is not used .
acceptable papr should also be determined prior to the papr reduction process based on the nonlinear circuits conditions and / or expected system performance .
after the number of phase sets v is determined based on the allowable power consumption and computational delay for slm , the slm papr reduction technique is performed .
based on the papr of ofdm signal after slm , cr is determined and caf is performed .
if the measured papr is within an acceptable range , the signal goes out of the papr reduction apparatus .
otherwise , based on the policy , the papr measurement result is returned to the central power management or cr determination unit .
for the distortion minimization policy , it goes to the central power management unit .
for the power consumption minimization policy , it goes to the cr determination unit .
also , if the signal is within the acceptable range after the slm technique , it is possible for the signal to escape from the papr reduction apparatus after the slm technique .
the process based on the papr reduction apparatus is depicted as a flow chart in fig 7 .
in fig 7 , ( a ) indicates papr reduction process according to the distortion minimization policy , while ( b ) indicates the papr reduction process according to power consumption minimization policy .
after enough operation , look - up table ( lut ) can be filled which can be located in central power management unit .
then , once the allowable papr and policy are given , the apparatus can refer the lut and choose the best v and cr , nu in a given policy , papr , and other situations .
the lut should be updated continuously after pre - defined interval .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g007 fig 7 flow chart for an example of using combination of slm and clipping papr reduction technique .
for the better understand and implementation , we provide the detailed algorithm as pseudo - code type in algorithm 1 .

we present the papr performances of combined technique , clipping technique and slm technique in fig 8 using ccdf .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g008 fig 8 ccdf of ofdm signal using combined technique .
the solid lines of fig 8 represent the ccdf of combined technique .
the dotted lines represent that of clipping and / or slm techniques for comparison purpose .
it is obvious that for the papr reduction perspective , the combined technique gives much better papr performance than clipping and / or slm technique .
the papr performance when ccdf = 10 - 3 is summarized in table 2 .
the papr performance improvement when using combined technique compared to using only clipping technique is around 10.7 % ( 7.961 - - > 7.109db ) in the case of cr = 5db , and 8.38 % ( 6.907 - - > 6.328db ) in the case of cr = 3db .
also the papr performance improvement when using combined technique compared to using only slm technique is around 18.15 % ( 8.685 - - > 7.109db ) in the case of cr = 5db , and 27.14 % ( 8.685 - - > 6.328db ) in the case of cr = 3db .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.t002 table 2 papr performance ( db ) when ccdf = 10 - 3 .
cr = infinity cr = 5db cr = 3db v = 1 11.7 7.961 6.907 v = 4 9.825 7.409 6.581 v = 32 8.685 7.109 6.328 v = 64 8.456 - - the clipping distortion is inevitable even we use the combined technique as shown in fig 9 .
the amplitude distribution characteristic of combined technique is similar with that of only clipping due to the clipping distortion .
however , the distortion could be much less than using only clipping technique , because the papr of the ofdm signal is reduced by using slm before passing through the clipping process .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g009 fig 9 pdf of ofdm signal amplitude using combined technique .
let us show the error vector magnitude ( evm ) , and out - of - band power radiation ( oobpr ) analysis using normalized power spectral density ( psd ) in figs 10 and 11 .
evm is a measure used to quantify how accurately the signal is transmitted , and defined as the ratio of the power of error vector to the power of reference , and is expressed as follows [ 34 ] : evm (%)= sumn | x ( n ) - x ^( n )| 2sumn | x ( n )| 2x100 , ( 30 ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g010 fig 10 error vector magnitude ( evm ) (%) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g011 fig 11 normalized power spectral density ( psd ) .
when nu = 5db , without using slm , evm is 5.54 % .
it is reduced to 4.37 % if we combine with slm , v = 64 , thus we can get around 26.77 % evm improvement using combined technique .
regarding oobpr , slm can reduce the oobpr , but the improvement is not so noticeable .
increasing cr is a good choice to reduce the oobpr .
even though the combined technique shows better performance , the complexity is higher than using only clipping and / or slm .
for the fair comparison , now we show the ee comparison using the metric we defined previously .
ee metric can reflect the complexity in the denominator .
first , for the analytical results , we investigate the distortion power of the combined technique .
fig 12 presents the normalized distortion power versus cr. here the normalized distortion power indicates the distortion power when the transmission power is normalized to unity .
as observed , it is obvious that as v increases , the distortion power reduces .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g012 fig 12 normalized distortion power versus cr , v = 1 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 .
the eq ( 16 ) is only valid for the signal which does not use oversampling and combination with slm .
without oversampling , the clipping technique is meaningless in real situation .
we present the simplified empirical model of the distortion power for the clipping and slm combination technique with oversampling , which can be represented as , e (| dc ( n )| 2 )= chi. ( e - nu2 - pinu.erfc ( nu )) .
( 31 ) where chi is the adjustable factor for the distortion power of the combined technique .
we show the comparison graph in fig 13 .
we chose v = 32 and chi = 0.54 .
chi = 0.54 is chosen based on the empirical distortion power modeling of the combination of oversampling , clipping and slm .
clipping with slm is highly nonlinear process , thus it is very difficult to derive the theoretical model of distortion power .
based on searching and curve fitting methods , we can find the adjustable factor of ( 31 ) and complete the model .
as we can see , eq ( 31 ) matches well with the simulation result , so we will use it for the analytic result .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g013 fig 13 normalized distortion power versus cr , matching analysis to the simulaiton , v = 32 .
now let us show the se ( bps / hz ) versus snr ( db ) in fig 14 .
for the parameters of the combined technique , we used v = 32 , nu = infinity , 5 , 3db .
solid lines indicate the simulation results , and dotted lines indicate the analytic results .
as observed in fig 14 , the analytic results are well - matched with the simulation results .
in the case of clipping with slm , as clipping amount increases , the se reduces due to the clipping noise .
in the case of no papr reduction shows the best se since it does not have any signal distortion .
in real system , in order to achieve the same snr in the case of no papr reduction and in the case of clipping with slm , the former must use expensive devices to emit more power than the latter .
for example , snr for the case of no papr reduction can be represented as snrno = ptxno.1n0b = ppanoetano.1n0b ( 32 ) where ptxno is the tx power , ppano is the pa power consumption , etano is the pa efficiency for the case of no papr reduction , and n0b is the noise power in a given bandwidth .
then , snr for the case of proposed scheme can be represented as snrp = ptxp.1n0b = ppapetap.1n0b ( 33 ) where ptxp is the tx power , ppap is the pa power consumption , etap is the pa efficiency for the case of proposed scheme .
for the case of snrno = snrp , it is obvious that ppano must be greater than ppap ( i.e. , ppano > ppap ) because the efficiency of the case of no papr reduction is smaller than the efficiency of the case of proposed scheme ( etano < etap ) .
these factors are reflected in the denominator of ee. also , as we mentioned previously , the complexity of the algorithm is reflected in the denominator of ee. for these reasons , we present the ee comparison in fig 15 for more fair comparison .
we applied appropriate input back - off ( ibo ) based on papr reduction performance .
the ibo criterion is when ccdf = 10 - 3 .
in the low snr region , the case of nu = 3db shows the best performance .
if snr becomes higher than 15db and less than 30db , the case of nu = 5db shows the best performance .
if snr is very high which is higher than 30db , only slm technique shows the best performance .
the clipping with slm and / or slm techniques shows better ee than the case of no papr reduction for all of the snr region .

solid lines indicate the simulation results , and dotted lines indicate the anlaytical results .
as a last analysis , we present simulation results of cell se and ee in fig 16 .
for the numerical simulations , we use a macro - cell type setup with 2ghz carrier frequency .
the path loss in db is modeled as 128.1 + 37.6log ( upsilon ) with distance upsilon in kilometers [ 35 ] .
we assume a cell radius of 2000 meters with a cell - hole radius of 100 meters .
the user locations are uniform - random , and an average was taken over 10,000,000 trials .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g016 fig 16 ( a ) cell se ( bps / h ) and ( b ) cell ee ( bps / hz / w ) .
we can see from ( a ) of fig 16 , as cr increases , se decreases , but when clipping and slm are combined , the decrease is smaller .
also as observed from ( b ) of fig 16 , as v and / or cr increases , ee increases , and the increase is more dominant when we use the combined technique .
the ee increments can be expressed as relative ees .
we define the relative ee , eer as follows : eer = ee / eeref ( 34 ) eeref indicates the ee when no papr reduction technique is applied .
fig 17 present the relative ee for the cases of clipping only , slm only , and combined technique .
when we apply slm with v = 32 , the relative ee increases up to 1.415 .
even though v increases to 64 , the increase in ee is marginal ( 2.47 % ( 1.415 - - > 1.45 )) .
in the case of clipping , when nu = 5db , the relative ee is 1.5 .
even though nu reduces to 3db , the increase in relative ee is also marginal ( 4.67 % ( 1.5 - - > 1.57 )). by using the combined technique , the relative ee reaches 1.69 , when v = 32 , nu = 3db .
the increment for using only slm with v = 32 is 19.34 % ( 1.415 - - > 1.69 ) , and the increment for using only clipping with nu = 3db is 7.64 % ( 1.57 - - > 1.69 ) .
as shown in the analytical and simulation results , the combined technique can achieve much higher ee than the single technique .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0185965.g017 fig 17 relative ee comparison between single technique and combined technique .
conclusions in this paper , we showed the methodology and analysis for the combination of two papr reduction techniques , clipping and slm. by combing the two papr reduction techniques , we witnessed that we can get much higher ee gain than only using single technique .
slm should be located before clipping to minimize the distortion .
we can set the policies based on system requirements , minimize complexity or minimize distortion .
the analytical distortion power is also derived which is well - matched with simulation results .
we showed that the proposed technique can increase ee by 69 % compared to no papr reduction , and by 19.34 % compared to only using slm technique .
the combined technique can be used for any kind of transmission system which uses high papr signal , but needs high ee. references 1 lee bm , kim y ( 2016 ) design of an energy efficient future base station with large - scale antenna system . energies , 9 ( 12 ) , 1083 doi : 10.3390 / en9121083 2 tham m - l , chow c - o , xu y - h , ramli n ( 2016 ) two - level scheduling for video transmission over downlink ofdma networks . plos one 11 ( 2 ) : e0148625 doi : 10.1371 / journal.pone.0148625 26906398 3 shamsan za , al - hetar am ( 2016 ) an improved mathematical scheme for lte - advanced coexistence with fm broadcasting service . plos one 11 ( 11 ) : e0136912 doi : 10.1371 / journal.pone.0136912 27855216 4 uthirajoo e , ramiah h , kanesan j , reza aw ( 2014 ) wideband lte power amplifier with integrated novel analog pre - distorter linearizer for mobile wireless communications . plos one 9 ( 7 ) : e101862 doi : 10.1371 / journal.pone.0101862 25033049 5 peng j , he s , wang b , dai z , pang j ( 2016 ) digital predistortion for power amplifier based on sparse bayesian learning . ieee trans .

the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the collagen - gelatin sponge ( cgs ) with that of the collagen sponge ( cs ) in dermis - like tissue regeneration .
cgs , which achieves the sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) , is a promising material in wound healing .
in the present study , we evaluated and compared cgss and conventional css .
we prepared 8 mm full - thickness skin defects on the backs of rats .
either cgss or css were impregnated with normal saline solution ( nss ) or 7 mug / cm2 of bfgf solution and implanted into the defects .
at 1 and 2 weeks after implantation , tissue specimens were obtained from the rats of each group ( n = 3 , total n = 24 ) .
the wound area , neoepithelial length , dermis - like tissue area , and the number and area of capillaries were evaluated at 1 and 2 weeks after implantation .
there were no significant differences in the cgs without bfgf and cs groups .
significant improvements were observed in the neoepithelial length , the dermis - like tissue area , and the number of newly formed capillaries in the group of rats that received cgss impregnated with bfgf .
the effects on epithelialization , granulation , and vascularization of wound healing demonstrated that , as a scaffold , cgss are equal or superior to conventional css .
1. introduction we developed a bilayered acellular artificial dermis ( pelnac ( r ) , gunze co. ltd. , ayabe , japan ) consisting of an upper silicone sheet and a lower collagen sponge ( cs ) [ 1 ] .
after the cs is grafted onto a full - thickness skin defect , fibroblasts and new capillaries spread throughout the lower layer of the sponge .
new collagen fibers are synthesized by the penetration of fibroblasts and the collagen sponge biodegrades and are gradually replaced with regenerated dermis - like tissue within a period of 2 - 3 weeks [ 1 , 2 ] .
artificial dermis has been used for the treatment of full - thickness skin defects caused by burns , in the waiting period for tumor excision , and for the treatment of intractable ulcers for more than 10 years [ 3 ] .
however , until the capillaries infiltrate the collagen sponge and the vascular network is formed , the artificial dermis exposes the patient to a high risk of infection [ 4 ] .
it is therefore difficult to apply artificial dermis to chronic ulcers , such as decubitus , diabetic , and leg ulcers [ 4 ] .
basic fgf , which was identified in 1974 , promotes the proliferation of fibroblasts and the formation of capillaries and accelerates tissue regeneration [ 5 - 9 ] .
in japan , human recombinant bfgf ( fibrast spray ( r ) , kaken pharmaceutical co. , ltd. , tokyo , japan ) has been available since 2001 , and its clinical effectiveness has been verified [ 7 ] .
in combination with bfgf , artificial dermis has been reported to accelerate dermis - like tissue formation [ 10 ] .
however , bfgf is rapidly diffused and inactivated after application in vivo [ 11 ] .
to overcome this disadvantage , we developed a cgs that contains a 10 wt % concentration of acidic gelatin which is capable of sustaining positively charged growth factors , such as bfgf , via the formation of ion complexes between bfgf and gelatin [ 4 , 12 , 13 ] .
in our previous study , we reported that cgss impregnated with bfgf ( 7 mug / cm2 ) accelerated neovascularization and wound healing with less contraction on the backs of mice , in the femoral trochanters of diabetic mice , and in the palatal mucosa of dogs [ 12 , 14 ] .
we also reported that cgss impregnated with bfgf accelerated the healing process of chronic ulcers in the first - in - human clinical trial [ 13 ] .
however , the equivalence of cs and cgs as a scaffold has not yet been confirmed .
therefore , in this study , the effects of the application of css and cgss with and without bfgf were evaluated and compared using the same full - thickness skin defects in rats in terms of dermis - like tissue formation , epithelization , and capillary formation .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
animals and operations the animals were maintained at the bioscience department of kac co. , ltd .
( rittou , japan ) .
the number of animals used in this study was kept to a minimum , and all possible efforts were made to reduce their suffering in compliance with the protocols established by the animal research committee determination of kac .
2.2 .
preparation of cs and cgs we used conventional css ( pelnac , gunze co. ltd. , ayabe , japan ) and cgss produced according to the procedure shown in our previous study [ 1 , 4 ] .
briefly , a collagen and gelatin solution with a gelatin ( isoelectric point ( iep ) : 5.0 ) concentration of 10 wt % of the total solute was prepared and freeze - dried .
a silicone solution ( shin - etsu chemical , tokyo , japan ) was used to make silicone sheets of 200 mum in thickness containing a polyester mesh , and the top of the cgs was covered with the silicone sheet .
2.3 .
the impregnation of cs and cgs with nss and bfgf we prepared css and cgss of 8 mm in diameter on a dish ( nunc dish 100x20 vents nunclon d si ( thermo fisher scientific inc. , yokohama , japan )) .
we previously reported that cgss impregnated with bfgf at doses of 7 mug / cm2 and 14 mug / cm2 accelerated the healing processes in mice and diabetic mice , respectively [ 12 ] .
we therefore adopted the 7 mug / cm2 dosage in the present study .
at the time of impregnation , 500 mug of human recombinant bfgf , in the form of a dry powder ( fibrast spray ; kaken pharmaceutical , tokyo , japan ) , was dissolved in 7.14 ml of normal saline solution ( nss , otsuka pharmaceutical co. , ltd. , tokyo , japan ) , and 70 mug / ml ( 3.5 mug / 50 mul ) of bfgf solution was prepared .
fifty microliters of nss was applied to css or cgss in the nss group ; the same amount of bfgf solution was applied to impregnate css or cgss with 7 mug / cm2 of bfgf .
they were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature .
four experimental groups were generated as follows : ( 1 ) css impregnated with nss ( cs - nss group ) ; ( 2 ) cgss impregnated with nss ( cgs - nss group ) ; ( 3 ) css impregnated with bfgf ( 7 mug / cm2 ) ( cs - bfgf group ) ; and ( 4 ) cgss impregnated with bfgf ( 7 mug / cm2 ) ( cgs - bfgf group ) .
eighteen samples were taken from each experimental group .
2.4 .
the implantation of cs and cgs into full - thickness skin defects in rats we prepared seven - week - old male rats ( n = 24 , slc : wistar , slc japan co. , ltd. , fukuoka , japan ) .
all of the rats had their backs and abdomens shaved and depilated under anesthesia by the intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg ) ( somnopenthyl ( r ) , kyoritsu seiyaku corporation , tokyo , japan ) and the inhalation of isoflurane ( escain ( r ) pfizer japan inc. , tokyo , japan ) .
three full - thickness skin defects measuring 8 mm in diameter were created in the back ( longitudinally ) of each rat , and 9 samples from three animals were included in each group .
therefore , each group had 9 samples that were adequate for the statistical analysis .
three full - thickness skin defects were created at an interval of 16 mm using an 8 mm diameter skin punch biopsy tool ( kai industries , gifu , japan ) , a scalpel , and scissors .
the panniculus carnosus was preserved .
css or cgss ( n = 18 in each group ) impregnated with either nss or bfgf were implanted into three skin defects created on the backs of each rat ( 6 rats in each group ) .
the css and cgss were sutured to the marginal skin using 5 - 0 nylon sutures ( medical u & a inc. , osaka , japan ) , covered with gauze , and fixed in place with adhesive tape ( silkytex ( r ) , alcare co. ltd. , tokyo , japan ) .
2.5 .
the assessments of the wound area and the neoepithelial length at 1 and 2 weeks after implantation , 3 rats per group were sacrificed via the inhalation of carbon dioxide .
after the removal of the silicone sheets , the wounds ( n = 9 ) were photographed , and the wound area was measured using the image j software program ( version 1.47 , national institute of health , usa ) .
the wound area was expressed as the percentage of the original wound area .
skin specimens , including the implanted css and cgss , were harvested using scalpels and scissors and were sectioned axially at the center of each specimen .
the specimens were then fixed with 20 % formalin fluid ( mildfolm ( r ) , wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) , paraffin - embedded , and sliced into 4 mum thick sections .
the sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) .
using a fluorescence microscope ( biorevo bz - 9000 ; keyence , co. , osaka , japan ) , the length of the neoepithelium , from the innermost hair root of the marginal skin to the end of the neoepithelium , was measured on each side of each cross - sectional area in each specimen at a magnification of x100 .
the sum of the lengths of the epithelium was evaluated on both sides .
2.6 .
evaluation of the area of dermis - like tissue azan staining sections were used to assess the newly formed dermis - like tissue .
azan stain is a complex staining method for general histology .
nuclei are stained bright red with azocarmine g and connective tissues , such as collagen fibers , are stained blue with aniline blue or orange g. the area of newly formed dermis - like tissue was measured by using the image stitching function of a fluorescence microscope ( biorevo bz - 9000 ) .
the lateral border of the regenerated area was determined by the transitional boundary layer of the continuous parallel structure of the dermis and the fragmental structure of newly formed dermis - like tissue .
the lower border of the regenerated area was above the panniculus carnosus , and the upper epithelium was not included in the measurement .
the area of newly formed dermis - like tissue was statistically analyzed .
2.7 .
evaluation of newly formed capillaries in the dermis - like tissue immunohistological staining with von willebrand factor antigen was performed to detect newly formed capillaries in the dermis - like tissue .
after deparaffinization and rehydration , the sections were incubated in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs life technologies co. japan , tokyo , japan ) with 0.1 % trypsin ( vector laboratories inc. , burlingame , ga , usa ) for 15 min at 37degreesc for antigen retrieval .
anti - von willebrand factor rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 500 dilutions , dako japan co. , tokyo , japan ) and envision + rabbit / hrp ( dako japan co. , tokyo , japan ) were used as the secondary antibody .
these sections were exposed to dab ( 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine - 4hcl ; dako japan co. , tokyo , japan ) for 2 min at room temperature .
counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin .
in each section , the newly formed capillaries were counted and the area of newly formed capillaries was measured manually in the regenerated area at a magnification of x200 , using the measurement module of a fluorescence microscope ( biorevo bz - 9000 ) .
2.8 .
statistical analysis all of the data were expressed as the mean + standard error ( se ) and were analyzed using tukey 's significant difference test ( tukey kramer test ) .
p values of < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance .

4. discussion in the present study we showed the efficacy of cgss impregnated with bfgf in the acceleration of the wound healing process .
we applied conventional css and cgss ( a novel scaffold that allows for the sustained release of growth factors ) with and without bfgf to skin defects in rats and compared the wound healing process .
a significantly higher number of capillaries were observed in the cgs - bfgf group ; however , the area of newly formed capillaries was not significantly higher .
this is probably because the number of specimens in the cs - nss group was small due to the unexpected death of an animal .
in other respects , cgss impregnated with bfgf ( 7 mug / cm2 ) accelerated angiogenesis and dermis - like tissue formation .
this finding is in line with the findings of our previous studies using mice , diabetic mice , rabbits , and beagle dogs [ 4 , 12 , 14 ] .
we emphasize the formation of dermis - like tissue in the healing process , because it accelerates epithelization and prevents wound contracture [ 14 ] .
two mechanisms are involved in the wound healing process : wound contraction and epithelization .
murine wounds close mostly through wound contraction .
in humans , wounds close mostly through epithelization and wound contraction causes scar contracture , decreasing the range of joint motion and / or causing hypertrophic scarring .
the cgs - bfgf group was the only group in which the neoepithelial length was observed to grow from the first week to the second week .
this growth was the result of dermis - like tissue formation ( figure 4 ) .
conventional css have been used for the preparation of dermis - like tissue , which prevent scar contracture .
in this point , the cgs - bfgf group showed the highest level of dermis - like tissue formation , which indicates that cgss impregnated with bfgf can prevent wound contracture .
in our previous studies , we developed cgss impregnated with bfgf mainly to accelerate the healing of chronic ulcers ( such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers ) ; however , the present results indicate that , in addition to conventional css , cgss impregnated with bfgf can be used to promote dermis - like tissue formation in the treatment skin defects .
cgs contains 10 wt % of gelatin , which degrades more easily than collagen .
another concern with regard to cgss is the possibility that its earlier degradation ( in comparison to css ) after application in vivo is not a desirable characteristic for a scaffold .
however , we did not observe a significant difference in the area of dermis - like tissue formation in the cs - nss and cgs - nss groups and the cgs - bfgf group showed the largest area of dermis - like tissue .
these results indicate that cgss are equal to css in their efficacy as scaffolds and that cgss were not easily degraded in the accelerated angiogenesis that occurred as a result of their impregnation with bfgf .
recently , skin substitutes containing living cells have been reported to be effective in the treatment of chronic skin ulcers [ 15 - 18 ] .
we have reported that css cultured with autologous fibroblasts and cgss impregnated with bfgf were equally effective in the treatment of diabetic ulcers [ 19 ] .
we have not evaluated the combination of cgss with living cells ; however , it is thus expected that cgss could be used in combination with cells as well as css .
various types of cells , including stem cells , have been used in the treatment of skin ulcers [ 20 - 22 ] .
cgss can achieve the sustained delivery of positively charged growth factors and can also be used as a cell carrier .
in the future , other growth factors and cells will be developed .
it is possible that these growth factors and cells will be combined with our cgs and used for treatment ; thus , our cgs has the potential to be used in the coming era of regenerative medicine .
5. conclusions wound healing after the treatment of rodent skin defects with conventional css and cgss with or without bfgf was compared .
the results showed that , as a scaffold , cgss can equal the efficacy of conventional css without bfgf .
furthermore , we found that cgss impregnated with bfgf ( 7 mug / cm2 ) accelerated the wound healing process which indicates that they may supersede conventional css in the clinical setting .

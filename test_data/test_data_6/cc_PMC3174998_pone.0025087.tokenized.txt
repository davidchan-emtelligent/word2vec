production of specialized cells from precursors depends on a tightly regulated sequence of proliferation and differentiation steps .
in the gonad of drosophila melanogaster , the daughters of germ line stem cells ( gsc ) go through precisely four rounds of transit amplification divisions to produce clusters of 16 interconnected germ line cells before entering a stereotypic differentiation cascade .
here we show that animals harbouring a transposon insertion in the center of the complex nucleoporin98 - 96 ( nup98 - 96 ) locus had severe defects in the early steps of this developmental program , ultimately leading to germ cell loss and sterility .
a phenotypic analysis indicated that flies carrying the transposon insertion , designated nup98 - 962288 , had dramatically reduced numbers of germ line cells .
in contrast to controls , mutant testes contained many solitary germ line cells that had committed to differentiation as well as abnormally small clusters of two , four or eight differentiating germ line cells .
this indicates that mutant gscs rather differentiated than self - renewed , and that these gscs and their daughters initiated the differentiation cascade after zero , or less than four rounds of amplification divisions .
this phenotype remained unaffected by hyper - activation of signalling pathways that normally result in excessive proliferation of gscs and their daughters .
expression of wildtype nup98 - 96 specifically in the germ line cells of mutant animals fully restored development of the gsc lineage , demonstrating that the effect of the mutation is cell - autonomous .
nucleoporins are the structural components of the nucleopore and have also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of specific target genes .
the nuclear envelopes of germ cells and general nucleocytoplasmic transport in nup98 - 96 mutant animals appeared normal , leading us to propose that drosophila nup98 - 96 mediates the transport or transcription of targets required for the developmental timing between amplification and differentiation .
introduction in development and tissue homeostasis , the proliferation of precursor cells and the initiation of terminal differentiation are temporally separated .
for example , regeneration of organs typically involves proliferation of de - differentiated or pre - existing pluripotent cells followed by coordinated differentiation .
tissue homeostasis from self - renewing populations of stem cells follows a similar two - step process .
first , stem cell daughters exiting the stem cell fate multiply by transit amplification divisions to create a pool of precursor cells .
then these precursors develop into specialized cell types through a precisely coordinated cascade of differentiation events [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the drosophila gonad has served as a highly successful model for elucidating many of the signaling pathways that regulate the cell fate , amplification , and differentiation of the gsc lineage [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
however , comparatively little is known about the molecules and mechanisms that coordinate developmental timing and , specifically , the timing between amplification and differentiation of stem cell daughters .
here , we show that a normal balance between transit amplification divisions and terminal differentiation depends on the complex nucleoporin98 - 96 ( nup98 - 96 ) locus .
nucleoporins are structural components of the nuclear pore and have well - established functions in nucleo - cytoplasmic transport as well as the breakdown and re - assembly of the nuclear envelope during mitosis [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] .
more recently , it has become clear that members of this protein family also contribute to the regulation of developmental processes via their effect on gene transcription .
specifically , drosophila nup98 was found to associate with actively transcribed chromatin in salivary glands of 3rd instar wildtype larvae in a manner dependent on ecdysone , a steroid hormone and key regulator of molting and metamorphosis .
transcriptional up - regulation in response to ecdysone is correlated with increased chromatin occupancy of nup98 while down - regulation correlated with a decrease in nup98 chromatin binding .
transcriptional profiling of drosophila s2 cells further established that nup98 and a second nuleoporin , sec13 , control the transcription of specific target genes regulating developmental transitions and the cell cycle [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
the highly conserved nup98 - 96 locus is complex and gives rise to two distinct proteins , nup98 and nup96 .
alternative splicing generates two transcripts in drosophila : a short mrna containing an open reading frame for only nup98 , and a long mrna with an open reading frame for a nup98 - nup96 poly - protein .
processing by autocatalytic cleavage subsequently separates the two functional units , nup98 and nup96 .
in drosophila , nup98 - 96 transcripts were detected at all stages of development [ 10 ] - [ 12 ] .
mutations harbouring a stop codon in nup98 , and thus presumably eliminating both nup98 and nup96 function , are associated with lethality prior to metamorphosis , possibly reflecting the role of nup98 in ecdyson - dependent gene transcription [ 12 ] .
here , we investigate the role of the nup98 - 96 locus in the germ line stem cell lineage .
in a screen for mutations effecting the development of germ line cells , we identified a transposon - insertion in the center of the nup98 - 96 locus .
in drosophila wildtype males , the daughters of gscs amplify by exactly four rounds of mitosis with incomplete cytokinesis to produce clusters of 16 spermatogonia that remain interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges .
after mitosis , the spermatogonia become spermatocytes , which enter the terminal differentiation cascade .
the first step of terminal differentiation is an extreme increase in germ cell size accompanied by the expression of most of the genes that mediate subsequent differentiation steps .
subsequently , the spermatocytes undergo meiosis and develop into spermatids [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
in the gonads of males homozygous for the nup98 - 962288 mutation , or harbouring nup98 - 962288 in trans to a deficiency that uncovers the locus ( df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 ) , gscs and their daughters appeared to differentiate into spermatocytes either directly or after less than four rounds of transit amplification divisions .
these defects were fully complemented by expression of nup98 - 96 specifically in the germ line , revealing a cell autonomous mode of action .
manipulations of signalling pathways that result in the over - proliferation of germ line cells in otherwise wildtype testes did not attenuate the nup98 - 962288 phenotype .
as the nuclear pore of mutant animals showed no obvious defects , we propose that the defects in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant animals are due to the lack of either nucleocytoplasmic transport or transcription of as yet unidentified factors required for timing the transition between amplification and terminal differentiation .
results the nup98 - 96 locus is required for maintaining germ line cells in an undifferentiated state animals carrying the nup98 - 962288 mutation were first identified in a genetic screen for sterile animals with abnormally small gonads .
we subsequently observed the same gonad phenotype in animals trans - heterozygous for nup98 - 962288 and df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 , suggesting that the nup98 - 962288 allele acts as a strong allele with respect to the gonad phenotype .
no other morphological abnormalities were obvious in these animals , implying that nup98 - 962288 is a mutation with a specific effect on gametogenesis .
in testes from nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant animals ( hence forth referred to as nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes ) , the germ line cells were progressively lost with increasing age of the animal .
normally , the germ line cells are arranged in a spatio - temporal gradient along the apical to basal axis of the testis ( figure 1a ) .
gscs are confined to the apical tip and surround a group of somatic cells , called the hub ( red in figure 1a ) .
their immediate daughters ( gonialblasts ) and clusters of between two and 16 interconnected cells in the process of transit amplification divisions ( spermatogonia ) become displaced basally and are found a short distance from the hub .
large spermatocytes that have initiated the differentiation cascade and mature spermatids occupy more basal positions within the testis .
at all stages of development , gscs and their progeny are fully enclosed by somatic support cells ( black circles in figure 1a ) .
this germ cell microenvironment , or niche , provides external cues that regulate stem cell self - renewal , stem cell daughter amplification , and germ line differentiation [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .

in situ hybridization with a gonad - specific probe ( piwi - rna ) revealed that the gonads from nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant embryos were similar in size to gonads from control animals ( in the following referred to as control testes , compare figure 1c to 1b , n > 50 ) .
however , by the 3rd instar larval stage , nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes were noticeably smaller than control testes ( compare figure 1e to 1d , n > 100 ) , and did not contain any early stage germ line cells ( gscs , gonialblasts , or spermatogonia ) .
in preparations stained with 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( dapi ) , the nuclei of early stage germ line cells appear as characteristic small bright signals ( figure 1d , arrows ) due to the small size of their nuclei , whereas spermatocytes that have initiated the differentiation cascade have larger , less brightly staining nuclei ( figure 1d , arrowhead ) .
in contrast to control testes , the apical region of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes did not contain many small , brightly stained nuclei , suggesting that early stage germ line cells were depleted .
however , larger and less brightly staining nuclei characteristic of spermatocytes were present in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes ( figure 1e , arrowheads ) .
labelling with an antibody against alpha - spectrin confirmed that 3rd instar larval nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes lacked transit - amplifying spermatogonia , but contained germ line cells at the spermatocyte stage .
in germ line cells , alpha - spectrin labels a sub - cellular structure called the fusome , and the shape and the size of fusomes is indicative of the germ line cell 's developmental stage [ 17 ] .
the gscs and the gonialblasts contain round fusomes , commonly referred to as spectrosomes .
the spectrosomes containing gscs ( figure 1f , g arrowheads ) are found next to the hub ( red and marked with an asterisk in figure 1f - 1l ) .
clusters of interconnected germ line cells contain branched fusomes that reach through their intercellular bridges .
alpha - spectrin - staining reveals that spermatogonia in transit amplifying divisions have small , branched fusomes and are located relatively close to the hub while the spermatocytes have large , branched fusomes and are found more basally ( figure 1f , small and large arrows , respectively ) .
3rd instar nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes did not contain cells with alpha - spectrin - positive spectrosomes located next to the hub ( figure 1h , n > 50 ) .
cells with alpha - spectrin - positive structures were mostly found toward the middle and basal region of mutant testes ( figure 1i ) .
germ line cells with round spectrosomes characteristic of gscs were detected .
however , these cells were larger than gscs ( figure 1i , arrowheads ) and contained large and less brightly dapi - stained nuclei typical of spermatocytes ( figure 1i , inset ) .
we propose that these solitary differentiating germ line cells originated from gscs and gonialblasts that failed to undergo amplification divisions .
in addition , we detected many wide fusomes ( figure 1j , arrows ) that connected large germ line cells with large nuclei and less brightly staining dna ( compare figure 1j - 1e ) , similar to wildtype spermatocytes .
in contrast to the fusomes in 16 cell stage spermatocytes in control testes , the fusomes in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes consistently had fewer than 16 branches and appeared to connect only two , four or eight spermatocytes .
this implies that most of the germ line cells of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes only went through one , two or three instead of the stereotypical four rounds of amplification divisions .
in support of this conclusion , the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes contained far fewer germ line cells than control testes : on average , only 34 alpha - spectrin - positive cells were found per mutant testis ( s.d .
20 , range : 0 - 54 , n = 40 ) compared to several hundred alpha - spectrin - positive cells found in control testes ( n > 50 ) .
adult nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes completely lacked early stage germ line cells and , on the basis of immuno - labelling with the germ line cell markers vasa and alpha - spectrin , rarely contained late stage germ line cells .
in control testes , vasa - positive gscs ( arrowheads in figure 1k ) form a rosette around the apical hub ( n > 100 ) .
vasa - positive spermatogonia are found at a distance from the tip in the apical region of the testes ( figure 1k , small arrows ) , whereas large vasa - positive spermatocytes are located more toward the base ( figure 1k , large arrows ) .
double staining with vasa - and alpha - spectrin - antisera revealed that 98 % of adult nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes did not contain any germ line cells ( figure 1l , n > 100 ) .
the remaining 2 % of the mutant testes contained either two or four large , vasa - positive spermatocytes located in the testis coil , or a few immature sperm bundles ( data not shown ) .
we conclude that the failure to undergo the normal numbers of amplification divisions completely exhausted the germ line of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 males .
nup98 - 962288 plays a parallel role in the female gonad much like the testis , the gonad of female flies is organized in an apical - to - basal differentiation gradient of germ line cells .
gscs lie at the apical tip of the germarium .
the stem cell daughters ( cystoblasts ) , and their transit amplifying progeny ( cystocytes ) become progressively displaced away from the tip toward the base ( figure 2a ) [ 18 ] .
gscs and cystoblasts are characterized by the presence of a alpha - spectrin - positive spectrosome ( figure 2b , arrowheads ) whereas the interconnected cystocytes contain branched fusomes ( figure 2b , arrows ) .
labelling with alpha - spectrin antibodies revealed the absence of both spectrosomes and fusomes in most germaria from nup98 - 962288 homozygous ( data not shown ) and nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant females ( figure 2c , 70 % , n > 100 ) .

we next investigated if the loss of early stage germ line cells observed in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germaria was age - dependent .
ovaries from wildtype control and nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant flies were collected at three and ten days post - eclosion , immuno - labelled with the germ line marker anti - vasa , and the number of vasa - positive germ line cells in each germarium was quantified ( figure 2d ) .
we found that the number of germ line cells in control animals did not change significantly between three and ten days post - eclosion .
control germaria contained on average 35 vasa - positive cells three days post - eclosion ( n = 100 ; standard deviation : 16 , range : 21 - > 40 ; blue bars in figure 2d ) and 32 vasa - positive cells 10 days post - eclosion ( n = 100 ; standard deviation : 16 ; range : 16 - > 40 ; green bars in figure 2d ) .
control germaria without vasa - positive cells were never observed .
in contrast , nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germaria showed a dramatic loss of germ line cells .
three days post - eclosion , mutant germaria contained an average of 13 vasa positive cells ( n = 100 ; standard deviation : 27 ) , but this number varied widely ( from 0 to 40 ; yellow bars in figure 2d ) .
ten days post - eclosion , mutant germaria , on average , contained only 2 vasa - positive cells ( n = 100 ; standard deviation : 13 ; range : 0 - 15 ; red bars in figure 2d ) .
notably , 75 % of the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germaria had no detectable germ line cells .
we conclude that the nup98 - 962288 mutation has similar effects on both male and female early stage germ line cells : in both sexes , the gsc lineage is rapidly depleted with increasing age , presumably due to differentiation .
the defects in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant gonads are due to disruption of a nuclear pore locus we mapped the nup98 - 962288 mutation to chromosomal region 95a5 to c10 .
complementation tests using mutations in genes along this region revealed that the defects in the mutant animals were due to a disruption of the nup98 - 96 locus .
sequencing of genomic dna from nup98 - 962288 mutant animals revealed two changes to the published gene sequence of the nup98 - 96 locus .
mutant animals harboured a point mutation that results in an amino acid exchange of the nup98 coding sequence ( caa to cga , glutamine860 to arginine ) .
however , the same amino acid exchange is found in nup98 - 96 alleles of drosophila pseudoobscura [ 19 ] , strongly suggesting it is a natural variant and does not cause the defects associated with the nup98 - 962288 allele .
in addition , mutant animals carried a pogo - element insertion in the fourth intron of the nup98 - 96 locus ( figure 3a , indicated as 2288 ) .
this insertion is predicted to disrupt the splicing of exon 4 to exon 5 ( encoding the n - terminal portion of nup96 ) and thus should specifically prevent the formation of nup96 .

scale bars : 30 microm .
expression of a rescue construct in the gonads of mutant animals confirmed that the nup98 - 962288 mutant phenotype was due to lesions in the nup98 - 96 locus .
we generated flies carrying cdnas encoding the two naturally occurring mrnas under control of yeast upstream activating sequence .
flies carrying a full - length cdna encoding nup98 and nup96 ( uast - nup98 - 96 , figure 3a ) were crossed to flies carrying gal4 - transactivators to induce tissue specific expression [ 20 ] .
expression of uast - nup98 - 96 in germ line cells of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant males using the germ cell specific driver nanos - gal4 - vp16 ( nos - gal4 ) [ 21 ] restored spermatogenesis .
an adult wildtype testis is a coiled , tubular organ that is , on average , 2 mm long ( n > 100 ) and contains germ line cells at all stages of spermatogenesis , including sperm bundles ( figure 3b , arrow ) .
adult nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes were much shorter ( figure 3c ) than control testes , measuring only 100 - 500 microm in length ( n > 100 ) .
in addition , mutant testes contained very few , if any , germ line cells ( see above ) .
nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes with germ line specific expression of uast - nup98 - 96 were of normal size and contained germ line cells at all stages of spermatogenesis , including mature sperm ( figure 3d , arrow , n > 100 ) .
expression of the uast - nup98 - 96 construct in the somatic cells of the gonad did not restore spermatogenesis ( n > 50 , data not shown ) , demonstrating that the defects were due specifically to loss of nup98 - 96 from the germ line cells .
expression of a cdna ( uast - nup98 ) which only encoded nup98 ( figure 3a ) within the germ line cells from nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes did not restore spermatogenesis and testes remained small ( figure 3e , n > 50 ) .
western blot analysis using protein extracts from whole control and mutant 1st instar larvae revealed that both antibodies ( raised against either nup98 or nup96 ) failed to detect significant levels of either protein in the mutant animals ( figure 3f ) .
we conclude that the defects in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 gonads are due to a strong reduction in both proteins , nup98 and nup96 .
confirming the role of the nup98 - 96 locus in the gsc lineage , expression of two independent rna - interference lines targeted against nup98 - 96 ( figure 3a , indicated as rnai ) in the germ line cells of otherwise wildtype animals also resulted in progressive loss of early stage germ line cells and the appearance of single cell spermatocytes ( figure 3g , arrow , n > 50 ) .
conversely , expression of uast - nup98 or uast - nup98 - 96 ( figure 3h ) in germ line cells of otherwise wildtype animals did not cause any defects in spermatogenesis ( n > 50 ) suggesting that the nup98 - 96 locus plays a permissive role in germ line development .
in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 animals , the nuclear envelope and general nucleocytoplasmic transport appear normal the molecular nature of nup98 - 96 suggests that the proteins play a structural role in germ line cells .
we therefore used the nuclear envelope marker laminc and the nuclear pore marker mab414 to determine if nup98 - 962288 caused any visible alterations in nuclear envelope morphology .
this analysis was performed using ovaries from young wildtype and nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 females since the female germ line cells are larger than male germ line cells and thus enable imaging with better sub - cellular resolution .
in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 gonads , laminc ( figure 4b , 4g ) , and mab414 ( figure 4d , 4e , 4i ) localization to the nuclear envelopes and nuclear pores of the germ line cells appeared normal compared to the controls ( figure 4a , 4c , 4f , 4h ) .

next , we surveyed the effect of the nup98 - 962288 mutation on nucleocytoplasmic transport by determining the localization of selected proteins normally found either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm .
the following proteins were assayed : the transcription factors groucho ( figure 5a , 5b , arrows ) and phosphorylated jun - kinase ( figure 5c , 5d , arrows ) , the cytoplasmic proteins vasa ( green in figure 5a - 5d and 5g - 5h ) and sex - lethal ( figure 5e , 5f , arrows ) , and the nuclear protein phosphorylated histone - h3 ( figure 5g , 5h , arrows ) .
as in the controls , sex - lethal and vasa were localized to the cytoplasm of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germ line cells , indicating that general mrna export was not disrupted .
likewise , groucho , phosphorylated jun - kinase , and phosphorylated histone - h3 were localized to the nuclei of both control and nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germ line cells , showing that the mutant germ line cells are capable of importing these proteins into their nuclei .

finally on the basis of phosphorylated histone - h3 and bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) labelling , nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 ovaries did not contain germ line cells that appeared to be blocked in s - phase or m - phase of the cell cycle ( compare figure 5h , 5j to figure 5g , 5i ) .
thus , our analysis failed to reveal any support for the view that the nup98 - 962288 mutation has a noticeable effect on either the structure of the nuclear pore or its function in the general transport of mrnas and proteins to and from the nucleus .
the nup98 - 962288 mutation causes differentiation of the germ line cells , even in the presence of proliferation - promoting factors to further explore the role of nup98 - 96 in the germ line cells , we tested the genetic interaction of nup98 - 962288 with perturbations in signalling pathways that regulate early stage germ line cells .
in wildtype ovaries , somatic cap cells signal via the transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta pathway to the adjacent gscs to regulate their decision between stem cell and cystoblast fate .
upon receptor activation , the tgf - beta signal transducers , mad and medea , translocate into the nucleus and silence transcription of the differentiation factor bag of marbles ( bam ) in the gscs .
therefore , bam is normally not found in the cytoplasm of gscs but is found in the cytoplasm of cystoblasts and cystocytes .
overexpression of bam within the germ line cells of otherwise wildtype ovaries causes the germ line cells to be lost , first from the gsc position and then from the entire germaria [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
the expression pattern of bam is an excellent tool for determining whether a defect in tgf - beta signalling exists in mutant ovaries .
in ovaries from freshly eclosed nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 females , bam was expressed in a pattern similar to that seen in wildtype ovaries .
as in wildtype germaria ( figure 6a , arrowhead ) , the nup98 - 96 mutant gscs located next to the apical tip did not contain cytoplasmic bam ( figure 6b , arrowhead ) .
in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germaria , gsc daughters displaced away from the gsc position showed normal cytoplasmic bam expression ( figure 6b , arrow ) , as seen in wildtype germaria ( figure 6a , arrow ) .
we conclude that tgf - beta signalling from the soma to the gscs was not disrupted in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant germaria .

this conclusion is consistent with the differences between the gonad phenotypes observed in flies with mutations in tgf - beta signalling pathway and nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant animals .
in both genders , loss of tgf - beta signalling specifically causes gsc loss .
however , upon loss of tgf - beta signalling , the gsc daughters undergo normal numbers of amplification divisions [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
in contrast , nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant gscs and their daughters differentiated either directly or after undergoing fewer than the normal four rounds of mitosis .
loss of signalling via the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) has an opposite effect on germ line cells than the nup98 - 962288 mutation does .
egfr - dependent signalling promotes the growth of the somatic support cells that surround the germ line cells and form their microenvironment ( black circles in figure 1a ) .
depletion of egfr signalling , for example via loss of stet , an enzyme required for processing the egfr ligand , results in a loss of this regulatory microenvironment .
as a consequence , the germ line cells over - proliferate and produce hundreds of early stage germ line cells , which populate the entire testis [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
we next investigated if germ cells mutant for the nup98 - 962288 mutation fail to proliferate in stet mutant background by creating double mutant animals .
early stage germ line cells that stain brightly with the nuclear dye dapi were confined to the tip of wildtype testes ( figure 6c , arrow ) but filled the testes of animals homozygous for the strong stet1 allele ( figure 6d , arrows ) [ 24 ] .
in contrast , testes from nup98 - 962288 mutant animals were much smaller than stet1 - testes ( compare figure 6e to 6d ) and contained few brightly stained , small nuclei ( figure 6e ) .
likewise , stet1 ; nup98 - 962288 double - homozygous animals were smaller than stet1 - testes ( compare figure 6f to 6d ) and also contained few brightly stained , small nuclei ( figure 6f ) .
immuno - labelling with antibodies against alpha - spectrin revealed few germ line cells in stet1 ; nup98 - 962288 double - mutant testes , all of which were large spermatocytes ( figure 6g , arrowhead ) and had a spectrosome ( figure 6g , arrow ) similar to the spermatocytes in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes .
these results indicate that nup98 - 962288 can suppress the germ line defects associated with loss of egfr signalling .
we next determined whether we would see the same effect of nup98 - 962288 on overproliferation phenotypes resulting from the hyper - activation of signalling pathways .
hyper - activation of the tgf - beta pathway in otherwise wildtype testes forces spermatogonia to proliferate beyond the normal four rounds of amplification division , producing clusters of 64 , 128 , or more spermatagonia that ultimately die [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
hyperactivation of the janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription ( jak / stat ) pathway in otherwise wildtype animals results in testes that are filled with thousands of cells resembling gscs and gonialblasts [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
both phenotypes could be reproduced by either over - expression of the tgf - beta ligand decapentaplegic ( dpp ) ( figure 6h , n > 50 ) , or the jak / stat ligand unpaired ( upd ) ( figure 6i , n > 50 ) , in the germ line cells of otherwise wildtype animals .
in contrast , over - expression of either ligand in the germ line cells of nup98 - 962288 animals failed to increase the number of early stage germ line cells .
instead , the testes were depleted of early stage germ line cells and , occasionally , a spermatocyte was observed ( figure 6j , arrow , n > 50 ) .
the interaction of nup98 - 962288 with egfr , tgf - beta , and jak / stat signalling strongly argue that nup98 - 96 function is an essential prerequisite for maintaining germ line cells in an undifferentiated state .
discussion the nup98 - 962288 mutation disrupts the normal progression of germ line cells through gametogenesis in both male and female flies .
zero or very few germ line cells were found in adult animals .
a developmental analysis revealed that the loss of early stage germ line cells was due to differentiation of gscs .
nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes contained only late stage germ line cells that were similar to wildtype spermatocytes .
spermatocytes normally develop in clusters of 16 cells that are derived from a single gonialblast undergoing four rounds of transit amplification divisions with incomplete cytokinesis .
in contrast , the late stage germ line cells of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes were either solitary , with a single large spectrosome , or part of small clusters of cells with wide , branched fusomes that connected only two to eight cells .
this finding implies that gscs and gonialblasts initiated the spermatocyte differentiation cascade either without or after a reduced number of transit amplification divisions .
the nup98 - 96 gene products are structural components of the nuclear pores and it seems possible that the defects seen in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 gonads may have been caused by generic defects in the nuclear pores or nuclear envelope .
however , the nuclear envelopes of nup98 - 962288 germ line cells did not exhibit defects apparent by immuno - fluorescence experiments , and the localization of several nuclear markers as well as cytoplasmic markers was unaffected in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 gonads .
furthermore , a reduction in the numbers of amplification divisions has not been reported in animals harbouring mutations in other nucleoporins .
however , it has been shown that localization of a lamin , otefin ( ote ) , to the nuclear envelope of gscs is required for stem cell maintenance in female flies .
ote physically interacts with medea to silence bam in the gscs .
over - expression of ote in the germ line cells increased the number of gscs , implying that it is instructive for stem cell identity [ 30 ] .
in contrast , bam expression at the tip of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 germaria did not extend into the gsc position , and overexpression of nup98 - 96 had no effect on gsc number .
these findings argue against the view that nup98 - 96 acts in a common pathway with ote. with all of the above observations taken together , it seems unlikely that the defects in maintaining early stage germ line cells in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutants is due to a generic defect in nuclear pore or nuclear envelope structure , or general nucleocytoplasmic transport .
instead , it is likely that nup98 - 96 function plays a specific role in the developmental timing between amplification and differentiation .
recent studies have implicated the nup98 - 96 gene products in a variety of specific functions in metazoans that appear to go beyond its role at the nuclear pore : arabidopsis thaliana nup96 was found to be required for basal immune - responses and constitutive resistance to non - host pathogens [ 31 ] ; mouse nup96 regulates the nuclear export of interferon regulated mrnas in immune responses [ 32 ] ; and , finally , drosophila nup98 mediates gene transcription in response to the molting hormone ecdysone [ 8 ] , [ 9 ]. by analogy , we propose that the nup98 - 962288 allele eliminates a specific aspect of nup98 - 96 function that is required for maintaining early stage germ line cells in an undifferentiated state .
on a mechanistic level , this function could be mediated by transcriptional regulation or selective nucleocytoplasmic transport of factors required for timing the transition between amplification and terminal differentiation .
while no such timing mechanisms have been identified in drosophila , nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor oct4 , a master regulator of differentiation , is a prerequisite for maintaining mammalian tissue stem cells in an undifferentiated state [ 33 ] .
in support of this view , the germ line cells in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant gonads were not responsive to the external cues that tightly control and influence the early stage germ line cells .
egfr - dependent signalling from the somatic support cells to the germ line cells promotes differentiation whereas activation of the tgf - beta and jak / stat pathways promotes proliferation .
a genetic analysis revealed that these pathways were not able to modify the number of amplification divisions in nup98 - 962288 gonads .
nup98 - 962288 suppressed the effect of loss - of - function mutations in the egfr pathway , which normally lead to dramatic over - proliferation of early germ line cells .
similarly , over - expression of tgf - beta or jak / stat ligands in the germ line of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 animals remained without effect on germ line cell amplification .
furthermore , the expression pattern of bam , the main target of tgf - beta signalling in the ovary , appeared normal in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 ovaries , suggesting that tgf - beta signals act independently of nup98 - 96 .
as targeted expression of a wildtype nup98 - 96 cdna in the germ line cells rescued the gonadal defects in nup98 - 962288 mutants , the function of nup98 - 96 in maintaining an undifferentiated state reflects a germ line - intrinsic mechanism .
instead of regulating differentiation factors , nup98 - 96 could be required cell - intrinsically for germ cell proliferation and a failure of the germ line cells to proliferate could trigger a cell - intrinsic differentiation response .
the nup98 - 96 locus in mice and drosophila has been implicated in regulating proliferation .
t - cells from nup96 +/ - mice hyper - proliferate [ 9 ] , [ 34 ] , and overexpression of nup98 in drosophila embryonic s2 - cells results in increased expression levels of cell cycle genes [ 9 ] .
in contrast , the germ line cells in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 testes displayed an opposite response : reduced proliferation upon the loss of nup98 - 96 .
overexpression of nup98 - 96 in germ line cells , by way of uast - nup98 - 96 , did not increase the number of germ line cells in gonads from otherwise wildtype animals .
these results demonstrate that the drosophila nup98 - 96 locus regulates a distinct response from the nup98 - 96 locus in mouse .
the germ cell phenotype of nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 animals adds to the current view of germ cell development and possibly to the development of other specialized cells from precursors .
in testes but not ovaries , the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant phenotype shares similarity to the bam mutant phenotype .
lack of bam has a different effect on the germ line cells in the two genders .
in bam mutant ovaries , the germ line cells do not enter amplification divisions and accumulate as single cells .
in testes , bam regulates the number of mitotic amplification divisions .
reduction in bam expression causes the proliferation of spermatogonia beyond the 16 - cell stage [ 35 ] and over - expression of bam causes premature differentiation at the 8 - cell stage [ 36 ] .
it is possible that bam is mis - expressed in the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant testes and that this mis - expression contributes to the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant phenotype .
however , our observations emphasize that the nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant phenotype is different from the bam mutant phenotype .
in nup98 - 962288 / df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 mutant ovaries and testes , gscs , their immediate daughters , and their mitotic progeny proliferated less than control cells and instead entered the differentiation program .
our findings suggest that the switch between gsc divisions , transit amplification divisions , and terminal differentiation has to be controlled at multiple levels .
further understanding of nup98 - 96 function in the germ line cells awaits the identification of factors that regulate entry and exit from transit amplification divisions , and initiation of the terminal differentiation program .
materials and methods fly strains flies were raised on standard cornmeal molasses agar medium .
the nup98 - 962288 mutation was identified by antoine guichet and anne ephrussi in a screen for flies with small gonads .
flies expressing rnai - constructs for nup98 - 96 ( uas - nup98 - 96rnai , lines 31198 and 31199 ) were obtained from the vienna drosophila resource center .
the stet1 allele is described in [ 24 ] .
df ( 3r ) mbc - r1 , nup98 - 96339 , uas - dpp , uas - upd , nos - gal4 : vp - 16 , c784 - gal4 , w1118 , oregon r , balancer chromosomes , the 3rd chromosome deficiency kit , and mutants that mapped to the chromosomal area 95a - c are as described in [ 19 ] and were obtained from the bloomington stock center .
mapping the nup98 - 962288 mutation was mapped using deficiencies spanning the 3rd chromosome .
deficiencies df ( 3r ) mbcr1 ( 95a5 - 7 to 95d6 - 11 ) and df ( 3r ) mbc - 30 ( 95a5 - 7 to 95d10 - 11 ) produced a germ line cell loss phenotype when in trans to nup98 - 962288 whereas deletions surrounding the area did not .
fly stocks carrying mutations in genes mapping to the 95a - c chromosomal region were tested for complementation .
the nup98 - 96339 mutation failed to complement nup98 - 962288 while all other mutants in the area complemented nup98 - 962288 .
molecular techniques generation of genomic dna , sequencing , sds - page , and western blotting were performed following standard procedures [ 37 ] .
protein extracts were made from whole 1st instar larvae .
for western blots , chicken anti - nup96 - serum was used at 1:20,000 , rabbit anti - nup98 - serum was used at 1:5,000 , and mouse - anti - laminc was used at 1:70 .
horseradish peroxidase coupled secondary antibodies for western blotting were obtained from promega ( anti - chicken , 1:5,000 ) and ge - healthcare ( anti - rabbit , 1:20,000 , anti - mouse 1:10,000 ) .
generation of uast - nup98 - 96 - constructs testis cdna clones for nup98 - 96 were obtained from the drosophila genomics resource center .
the clone at20377 contained 380 base pairs of the nup98 - 96 5 ' prime sequence , which contains a tata box for polymerase binding and the coding region for nup98 ( nucleotides 1 to 2250 ) .
the clone at01311 contained the coding region for nup96 and 500 base pairs of the nup98 - 96 3 ' prime sequence , which contains consensus sequences for polyadenylation to assure transcript stability ( nucleotides 2496 to 6522 ) .
a full - length clone of nup98 - 96 was generated by standard molecular cloning techniques .
a 1 kb fragment spanning the end of nup98 , the auto - cleavage site , and the beginning of nup96 was generated by pcr from genomic wildtype dna and cloned directionally into the ecor1 and econ1 restriction sites of at01311 , resulting in plasmid pot - cs - 96 .
subsequently , the nup98 - 96 5 ' prime sequence and nup98 - coding region were directionally cloned using ecor1 and bsph1 into pot - cs - 96 resulting in pot - nup98 - 96 .
the cdna was cloned into a uast - vector to generate uast - nup98 - 96 .
to generate a nup98 - cdna , uast - nup98 - 96 was cut with mlu1 and nco1 to remove the nup96 coding sequences , the ends were filled by the klenow enzyme , and the vector was re - ligated .
this resulted in a nup98 - construct ( uast - nup98 ) that contains the nup98 - 96 5 ' prime sequence , the nup98 coding region , the auto - cleavage site , a stop codon , and the nup98 - 96 3 ' prime sequence .
the constructs were injected into flies by the best gene , inc .
fly stocks were established from the injected animals and several independent lines were used for our experiments .
all lines yielded the same results .

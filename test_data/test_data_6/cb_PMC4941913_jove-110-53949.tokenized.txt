during this process , a portion of neural stem cells undergo differentiation and give rise to the first populations of differentiated primary neurons within the nascent central nervous system .
several vertebrate model organisms have been used to explore the mechanisms of neural cell fate specification , patterning , and differentiation .
among these is the african clawed frog , xenopus , which provides a powerful system for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for primary neurogenesis due to its rapid and accessible development and ease of embryological and molecular manipulations .
here , we present a convenient and rapid method to observe the different populations of neuronal cells within xenopus central nervous system .
using antibody staining and immunofluorescence on sections of xenopus embryos , we are able to observe the locations of neural stem cells and differentiated primary neurons during primary neurogenesis .
neuroscience issue 110 xenopus cns development immunostaining neuronal differentiation primary neurogenesis introduction in vertebrates , the development of the central nervous system comprises several distinctive yet consecutive stages .
the first step is neural induction , when naive ectodermal cells are specified toward a neural fate rather than an epidermal fate .
several interconnected regulatory mechanisms are involved during this stage in xenopus and other model systems 1,2 .
this process is primarily coordinated by secreted factors produced by the underlying mesoderm , such as chordin , noggin , and follistatin 3 - 7 .
after neural induction , a subset of neural progenitors exit the cell cycle and begin to differentiate in a process referred to as primary neurogenesis .
not all neuronal precursors differentiate at this time .
the remaining neural precursor cells continue to proliferate , thereby maintaining the stem cell pool needed for continued growth of central nervous system throughout development and into adulthood .
these proliferating neural precursor cells are characterized by their expression of the sry ( sex determining region y ) - box 3 ( sox3 ) gene 8 - 11 .
the other population of cells , which exit the cell cycle and commit to a differentiated fate , are identified by the expression of the differentiation gene markers , tubulin , beta 2b class iib ( tubb2b,n - tub ) and myelin transcription factor 1 ( myt1 ) 12 - 14 .
such differentiated neuronal cells eventually give rise to different categories of neurons including , but not limited to , motor , inter - , and sensory neurons positioned in distinct areas within the neural tube 15 - 17 .
while significant efforts have been devoted to uncovering the regulatory mechanisms that govern the patterning and fate determining events in the anterior neuroectoderm , less attention has been made on investigating the neurogenic events that occur following the initial patterning stage .
indeed , signal transduction , transcriptional regulations , as well as post - translational modifications are all involved in this later stage , controlling both timing and lineage specification during neurogenesis 18 - 20 .
further investigations into these mechanisms require a reliable method to easily visualize and distinguish different populations of neuronal cells .
the above - mentioned neural markers , including , sox3 , myt1 , and n - tub , can provide a means for identifying these different cell populations , thus providing the necessary foundations for revealing the underlying mechanisms of neuronal differentiation 21 - 23 .
although differential labeling of neuronal cell populations have been demonstrated in other model organisms , relatively few studies have exploited the xenopus system to its fullest in this regard .
this is mainly due to a paucity of compatible antibodies that reliably identify the various neuronal cell populations in the neural tube .
here , we describe a method for visualizing neuronal differentiation in early xenopus embryos via immunostaining , which provides a robust and convenient approach for investigating primary neurogenesis in xenopus .
this protocol should give sufficient guidance for researchers interested in the early development of xenopus central nervous system between stage 26 and stage 45 .
protocol all animal experiments were approved from the university of manchester animal welfare centre and were covered by a uk home office project license .
1. collection and fixation of xenopus embryos prepare reagents and materials for experiments .
prepare 10x marc 's modified ringers ( mmr ) by dissolving 56.5 g of nacl in approximately 800 ml ultrapure water and adding stock solutions of 1 m kcl , 1 m mgso4 , 1 m cacl2 , and 1 m hepes ph 7.4 to achieve a final concentration of 20 mm kcl , 10 mm mgso4 , 20 mm cacl2 , 50 mm hepes .
adjust ph to 7.4 by 10 m naoh and then adjust the final volume to 1 l. sterilize the 10x mmr solution by autoclaving at 121 degreesc for 20 min on a liquid cycle .
upon using , dilute with ddh2o to 0.1x final concentration and add 20 mg / l gentamycin to inhibit microbial growth .
make 10x tbs solution by mixing 24 g tris - hcl , 5.6 g tris - base , 88 g nacl and dissolving in approximately 900 ml ultrapure water .
the final solution will have a ph value around 7.6 .
adjust with either 10 m naoh or concentrated hcl to achieve a final ph of 7.6 and final volume to 1 l. upon using , make 1x tbs by diluting 1 part of 10x tbs solution with 9 parts of ultrapure water .
make 10x mem salt by dissolving 209.2 g mops in approximately 800 ml ultrapure water and adding stock solutions of 0.5 m egta and 1m mgso4 to achieve a final concentration of 20 mm egta , 10 mm mgso4 .
adjust ph to 7.4 by 10 m naoh and then adjust the final volume to 1 l. sterilize the mem salt solution by autoclaving at 121 degreesc for 20 min on a liquid cycle ( the solution may turn yellow by a few months of storage at room temperature or after it has been autoclaved , but this change in color does not affect its use ) .
however , do not use the solution after prolonged storage ( more than 6 month ) .
make 1x memfa solution by diluting 1 part of mem salts , 1 part of 37 % formaldehyde with 8 parts of ultrapure water ( v / v , stable at 4 degreesc for at least 1 - 2 weeks ) .
prepare 4 % paraformaldehyde in tbs ( for subsequent staining involving phalloidin ) by dissolving 4 g of paraformaldehyde powder in 100 ml of 1x tbs solution heat the solution to 60 degreesc and add a few drops of 10 m naoh to assist dissolving .
aliquot in 5 - 10 ml volume and freeze in - 20 degreesc .
do not re - freeze once thawed .
caution : paraformaldehyde powder is an irritant and is toxic if inhaled , thus the weighing step should be performed in a fume hood .
label as many 4 ml glass vials with screw caps prior to sample collection .
prepare 15 % gelatin / 15 % sucrose by pouring 20 ml of 40 % fish gelatin ( pre - heat in a 50 degreesc water bath ) into a 50 ml centrifuge tube .
add 8 g of sucrose and fill the tube to the 50 ml line with 1x tbs .
place the gelatin tube on a rotary mixer or rolling bed to mix overnight at room temperature .
this gelatin solution is stable at 4 degreesc for 1 week .
do not use expired solution and do not freeze - thaw .
prepare and fix x. laevis or x. tropicalis embryos cultured to desired stages .
culture the fertilized x. laevis or x. tropicalis embryos in 0.1x mmr with gentamycin until the desired stages .
note : generally , collect embryos between stages 23 and 40 .
later collection of embryos after stage 40 is possible , especially when observing axonal growth from the spinal cord , but keep in mind that additional gelatin penetration time may be required .
the embryos may be wild - type , transgenic , mutant , inhibitor - treated , morpholino ( mo ) - injected , or electroporated 23,24 .
collect 20 - 50 embryos in each 4 ml glass vial , remove as much medium as possible and replace with memfa .
note : if subsequent staining involves phalloidin , use 4 % paraformaldehyde instead of memfa since commercial supplied formaldehyde solutions usually contain up to 10 % methanol as a stabilizer that will interfere with phalloidin staining .
fix overnight at 4 degreesc or , if in an urgency , at room temperature for 2 hr on a rotary mixer .
the embryos will be stable in fixation solution for at least 1 week at 4 degreesc .
after fixation , wash the embryos 3 times for 20 min using 1x tbs with 0.05 % triton x - 100 .
after the final wash , remove as much tbs - triton as possible and add 3 ml of 15 % gelatin / 15 % sucrose into each vial .
place the vials on a roller bed overnight at room temperature .
for embryos older than stage 40 , use at least 24 hr of penetration time .
after penetration , proceed immediately to section 2.2 on the next day .
2. mounting and cryosectioning of xenopus embryos prepare reagents and materials for experiments .
take one box of positively charged slides , ideally unopened .
note : if opened , keep the slides in a dry condition ( such as a dry box ) and use within 1 month to ensure the static charge on the slides is maintained .
do not use expired slides since samples will fall off during immunostaining .
pre - chill the cryostat chamber to - 30 degreesc .
set the instrument parameters as - 35 degreesc for microtome and 12 microm section thickness .
install the thick cover glass plate onto the stage and let the cryostat equilibrate for at least 30 min before section starts .
prepare painting brushes for moving section strips , keep inside the cryostat chamber .
prepare pencils for writing on slides , put them at room temperature .
wear gloves during cryosection .
do not use bare hands .
mounting xenopus embryos carefully aspirate 5 - 10 embryos out of the glass vial using a plastic or glass pipette without introducing air bubbles .
transfer the embryos into the mounting chamber and observe under a stereoscope .
fill up the mounting chamber with gelatin solution to ensure the rigidity of the section block .
arrange the embryos as per figure 1 using a pair of fine - tip forceps .
mark the orientation of heads by drawing an arrow on the rim of the chamber using a cryogenic - compatible marker .
for multiple groups of embryos , write down the description of each group on the rim of the corresponding chamber as well .
carefully place the chamber horizontally in a foam box half - filled with dry ice and close the lid .
observe the mounting chamber freeze in 5 - 10 min .
process each chamber serially ( i.e. place the previous chamber onto dry ice before proceeding to the next one ) as this will leave sufficient time for each chamber to freeze and prevent the dry ice box to become overcrowded .
note : frozen mounting chambers do not need to stand horizontally and can be stacked up inside the box .
proceed with cryosectioning or , if required , keep frozen samples at - 80 degreesc for at least 1 - 2 week without losing immunogenicity .
cryosection of mounted xenopus embryos remove a frozen sample block from the chamber by pressing the bottom of the chamber using a blunt stick ( such as a pencil ) .
add several drops of tissue - freezing medium , ( a polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol - containing medium ) onto the sample holding disc and mount the sample block with the anterior end of the embryos points up ( figure 2 ) .
allow the mounted - block stand inside the cryostat chamber for approximately 1 min or until the tissue - freezing medium becomes opaque .
immediately install the sample holding disc onto the microtome with the bottom side of the sample block facing up. trim off a portion of the sample block using a blade when the sample block is still relatively " soft " to reduce the length of each section ( if desired ) .
leave the sample holding disc on the microtome for at least 5 min to allow its temperature to reach equilibrium .
gradually trim the sample block down until the heads of tadpoles are visible through the translucent gelatin .
to increase trimming speed , apply a higher ( thicker ) setting of section thickness ( e.g. 20 - 25 microm ) at this stage ( such as enabling the " trim " option ) but not too thick because sample block can fall off from the sample holding disc .
observe the performance of cryostat , such as the sharpness and angle of the blade at this stage to ensure the generation of a long strip of subsequent sections .
once the tadpole heads become visible , adjust the settings of the cryostat back to normal ( e.g. 10 - 12 microm ) and clean both the microtome and stage using a paint brush .
gently make 2 - 3 sections as a trial using the hand wheel setting ( do not use the motorized setting ) to make sure that finished slices can form strips , not overlapping or sticking to the blade .
continue trimming until the heads of tadpoles are almost exposed ( this may need some experience but achievable ) .
brush off any remnant sections on the stage and the collection of sample sections will begin .
make approximately 10 - 15 sections and let them form a long strip .
flip over the thick cover glass plate to the side and gently remove the strip from the blade using a fine - tip paint brush and arrange it on the stage with long axis parallel to the blade .
pick one positively charged slide at room temperature , label it with a pencil ( which will not be washed off during subsequent staining treatments ) , press it quickly but firmly onto the strip with the label side facing down and remove the slide from the cryostat chamber .
if done correctly , the strip should immediately stick to the positively charged slide ( figure 3a ) .
repeat this step to have 20 - 30 slices on each slide and arranged in parallel ( figure 3b ) .
this is sufficient to cover the entire brain region of x. tropicalis embryos and most of forebrain and midbrain regions of x. laevis embryos .
air - dry the slides for 10 min , proceed immediately or , store the slides in a slide box at - 80 degreesc for at least 3 - 6 months without losing immunogenicity .
3. immunostaining of sectioned xenopus embryos prepare reagents and materials for experiments .
prepare 0.05 % tbs - triton x - 100 by adding triton x - 100 into 1x tbs to achieve a final concentration of 0.05 % .
this solution is stable at room temp for 3 - 4 days .
do not use expired solution .
prepare 5 % heat - inactivated goat serum or 5 % bsa in tbst as blocking buffer .
firstly , heat - inactivate the goat / lamb serum by placing approximately 20 - 30 ml of serum in a 65 degreesc water bath for 30 - 60 min .
aliquot into 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes and freeze in - 20 degreesc .
no re - inactivation is required upon using .
dilute the heat - inactivated serum or bsa in tbst to achieve a final concentration of 5 % before use .
prepare appropriate primary antibodies according to dilutions in blocking buffer ( e.g. 1:500 anti - sox3 10,25 / 1:250 anti - myt1 26 / anti - acetylated tubulin ) .
use approximately 100 microl of antibody solution on each slide .
prepare appropriate fluorescent antibodies ( e.g. anti - mouse / rabbit red fluorescent dye - conjugated antibodies ) in blocking buffer ( usually 1:500 ) .
( optional ) add red fluorescent dye - conjugated phalloidin ( 1:500 ) into secondary antibody mix to reveal actin network .
( optional ) add dapi ( 0.5 microg / ml final concentration ) into secondary antibody mix to visualize nuclear localization .
take the anti - fade mounting medium out of the freezer and thaw in room - temperature water bath .
immunostaining remove the frozen slides from - 80 degreesc and place them on a piece of towel paper inside a ventilation hood for at least 1 hr to eliminate any condensed water droplets , then bake the dried slides on a 85 - 90 degreesc heat block with the slices facing up for 15 min to activate the adhesion mechanism .
finally , allow the slides cool down to room temperature ( at least 10 min ) .
fill the staining jar with pure acetone and incubate the slides in acetone for 10 min to remove fish gelatin .
if multiple slides are to be treated , arrange them on a staining rack .
air - dry the treated - slides for 15 min in a ventilation hood .
do not re - use the acetone .
carefully draw a ring around the samples on the slide using a pap pen without touching the samples .
ensure that the ring is self - enclosed , otherwise antibody solution will flow out during staining .
fully dry the pap pen ring .
fill another staining jar with 1x tbs without triton x - 100 .
insert the dried - slides into the staining jar and allow rehydration for at least 1 hr. in the meantime , prepare the blocking buffer by diluting either heat - inactivated goat serum or bsa to 5 % final concentration using 1x tbs with 0.05 % triton x - 100 .
make a wet box by placing 1 - 2 6 - well plates inside a click - lock food box and fill the wells halfway with ultrapure water .
remove rehydrated slides from the staining jar and place them horizontally on the 6 - well plates ( without the plate lid ) .
carefully add 300 - 600 microl of blocking buffer inside the pap ring .
seal the wet box by locking the lid into position and incubate at room temperature for at least 1 hr. dilute the appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer .
generally , use 100 - 150 microl diluted antibody solution per slide .
if multiple slides are processed , scale up the volume proportionally .
after blocking , carefully remove the blocking buffer from slides by aspiration and quickly add primary antibody solution to prevent dry - out , then seal the wet box and incubate at 4 degreesc overnight .
on the next day , remove the primary antibody solution from the slides by aspiration .
wash the slides by inserting into staining jars filled with 1x tbs with 0.05 % triton x - 100 , 3 times , 15 min each .
meanwhile , dilute the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies with blocking buffer ( with or without dapi or phalloidin ) .
carefully add 100 - 150 microl of secondary antibody solution onto the slides .
place the slides inside the wet box and seal the lid .
incubate the slides for 1 - 2 hr at room temperature .
wash the slides in staining jars filled with 1x tbs with 0.05 % triton x - 100 , 3 times , 15 min each .
at the final wash , thaw the anti - fade mounting medium in a 50 degreesc water bath for 10 min if stored at - 20 degreesc .
cool down the mounting medium to room temperature before use .
add approximately 20 microl ( one drop ) of mounting medium onto the slide and apply a large cover slip ( at least 22 mm x 64 mm ) over the samples .
observe using fluorescent or confocal microscope within 6 hr post mounting .
if imaging cannot be done on the same day , seal slides using nail polish and place them inside the wet box at 4 degreesc overnight .
note : the anti - fade mounting medium will gradually get oxidized after a few days ( and turn brownish ) so it is recommended to take the images as soon as possible .
representative results the representative results show cross - sections of stage 30 xenopus embryos at different levels , namely the forebrain , midbrain , hindbrain , and spinal cord , stained with different antibodies ( figure 4 ) .
as mentioned , sox3 - labeled neuronal progenitor cell population locates in the proximity of the lumen of the neural tube , while myt1 - labeled differentiated primary neurons migrate outward and locate near the marginal layer ( basal lamina ) of the neural tube .
anti - acetyl - tubulin labels axons in differentiated neurons , which can be observed within the whole neural tube .
side - specific gene knockdown or overexpression is a broadly used method in neurobiology to evaluate whether modulating the expression of specific gene ( s ) disrupts the growth and differentiation of neuronal cells .
in such cases , either morpholinos ( mos ) or dna construct ( s ) carrying promoter - driven gene ( s ) are injected into one of the two blastomeres at two - cell stage 23 .
alternatively , they can be injected into the brain ventricle followed by electroporation , which will result in knockdown or over - expression of desired gene ( s ) 27 .
in both cases , the effects will be restricted to one side of the embryo , making the opposite side of the embryo as untreated internal control .
after fixation , sectioning , and immunostaining , the impacts of gene knockdown / over - expression are quantified by counting and comparing the cell numbers of different populations at both sides of embryo. by accumulating these data from several embryos , statistical analysis can be performed .
in our representative results , no perturbation was made in the embryos .
examples of gene perturbation and their effects on different neuronal cell populations can be found in the references 20,23 .

discussion here we demonstrate a convenient and efficient method for visualizing primary neurogenesis in xenopus embryos .
this method permits the assessment of different types of neural cells , including neuronal stem cells and differentiated primary neurons using cell type - specific markers .
the protocol is generally robust with very high level of reproducibility .
for embryos that are at pre - hatching stages ( i.e. up to stage 28 ) , we recommend manually removing the vitelline membrane prior to fixation as this allows embryos to fully uncurl before fixation .
this is especially important when collecting embryos at relatively early stages ( before hatching ) , since bent embryos are extremely difficult to arrange at the desired orientation inside the mounting chamber .
we have not experienced a loss of immunogenicity after memfa or pfa fixation hence additional antigen retrieval step is not necessary for this protocol .
in addition , this immunostaining procedure can be carried out in samples from chromogenic / fluorescent in situ hybridization .
in such scenario , it is recommended to skip the protease k treatment step during the in situ hybridization protocol .
after chromogenic / fluorescent substrate reaction , samples can be washed with tbs and embedded in fish gelatin solution in a similar way to memfa / pfa fixed samples .
sample vials can be protected from light by wrapping the vials in aluminum foil if fluorescent in situ hybridization will be imaged together with immunofluorescent staining later .
in some cases , embryos may shrink excessively after gelatin penetration .
this is most likely caused by either insufficient fixation or insufficient tbs - triton extraction .
ensure that embryos have been fixed in pfa / memfa for at least 2 - 3 hr or preferably overnight at 4 degreesc .
if the problem persists , increase the washing time of tbs - triton to 3 for 1 hr. during cryo - sectioning , the rigidity of sample block may vary as different batches of fish gelatin have different properties .
this problem can be partially compensated by adjusting the temperature of the microtome .
a lower temperature will result in a " harder " sample block however under excessive low temperature the sample block becomes crisp and difficult to section .
some fine - tuning or practice ( using mock sample blocks without embryos ) before each sectioning may be beneficial prior to use on particularly valuable samples .
a commonly encountered problem during sectioning is the thin sections sometimes tend to stick onto the thick glass plate rather than stay flat on the steel stage .
this can be particularly disrupting since it constantly interrupts the continuous sectioning process .
such cases are usually caused by one of two reasons : the section chamber and ( especially ) the thick glass plate not being cold enough , or excessive static charge on the machine and the operator , especially in dry weather .
the former can be solved by turning down the temperature of the section chamber and leaving the glass plate within for extra time ( possibly overnight ) ; and the latter by properly grounding the cryostat .
connecting the metal surface of the cryostat to a metal tap or similar water tubing system made of metal can be an alternative way to release the static charges .
after each use , the thick glass plate should be washed well with non - corrosive detergent ( such as dishwashing liquid ) , rinsed by ultrapure water , sprayed with pure ethanol , and wrapped in towel paper to protect the surface and edges from damaging .
the antibodies listed in the protocol are generally specific and we rarely encounter nonspecific adsorption or high background signal .
it should be noted that , if using heat - inactivated goat / lamb serum as blocking agent , excessive heat - inactivation ( as visualized by the formation of fluffy precipitant in the serum ) should be avoided as this precipitant is highly attractive to secondary antibodies and may contribute to a source of high background .
it is possible , and sometimes desired , to perform double - staining to visualize different populations of neuronal cells simultaneously .
such double - staining is possible and generally gives satisfactory results with the following combinations : sox3 / n - tub or myt1 / n - tub .
however , double - staining of sox3 and myt1 is complicated by the fact that the two antibodies are both from rabbit origin .
we have tested several antibody direct labeling kits , however no satisfactory results were observed ( low signal - to - noise level ) , possibly due to the lack of signal amplification from secondary antibodies .
one possible approach to circumvent this problem would be to raise transgenic lines in xenopus , as discussed below .
one of the main restrictions of this protocol is that , while this protocol could sufficiently distinguish two main pools of neuronal cells , namely , the sox3 - expressing neural stem cell pool and the myt1 - expressing differentiated neurons , it lacks the ability to reveal different sub - populations of differentiated neurons .
such sub - populations , which including , but are not limited to , primary motor neurons , interneurons , and sensory neurons , are usually characterized by their differentially - expressed marker genes 28 - 30 .
as mentioned above , recent advances in the development of multicolor in situ hybridization combined with antibody - based immunofluorescence detection method in xenopus embryos may fill in the gap to reveal these sub - populations of differentiated neurons for potential investigation 31 .
alternatively , as has been demonstrated in mice model , it would also be desired to raise a more comprehensive set of cell type - specific antibodies to distinguish such different cell populations in xenopus .
it is also worth mentioning that , as an addition to this method , recent advances in optical imaging and image analysis , such as multiphoton microscopy , 3d reconstruction , and segmentation , can also be applied after initial assessments to achieve more comprehensive observations of xenopus oocytes as well as early embryos , particularly under a live setting 32,33 .
therefore , to track proliferation , differentiation , and movement of neuronal cells in live animals , it would be desired to establish one or more transgenic lines that harbor fluorescent proteins driven by cell type - specific promoter to allow live observation of such cell populations in early xenopus embryos .
the establishment of a x. laevis line with neuro - specific beta - tubulin promoter driving taugfp and its applications have provided a nice example 23,34. with the full promoter sequences of both sox3 and myt1 characterized in vertebrates 35 - 37 , it is should be relatively easy to establish additional transgenic lines in xenopus which should contribute extensively to both the xenopus community and a more general field of primary neurogenesis research .

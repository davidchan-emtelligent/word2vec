background evidence suggests that rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) may enhance or reduce the progression of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .
the present study was performed to directly explore the effects of collagen - induced rheumatoid arthritis ( cia ) on amyloid plaque formation , microglial activation , and microvascular pathology in the cortex and hippocampus of the double transgenic app / ps1 mouse model for ad. wild - type or app / ps1 mice that received type ii collagen ( cii ) in complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ) at 2 months of age revealed characteristics of ra , such as joint swelling , synovitis , and cartilage and bone degradation 4 months later .
joint pathology was accompanied by sustained induction of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha in plasma over 4 weeks after administration of cii in cfa .
results cia reduced levels of soluble and insoluble amyloid beta ( abeta ) peptides and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus of app / ps1 mice , which correlated with increased blood brain barrier disruption , iba - 1 - positive microglia , and cd45 - positive microglia / macrophages .
in contrast , cia reduced vessel density and length with features of microvascular pathology , including vascular segments , thinner vessels , and atrophic string vessels .
conclusions the present findings suggest that ra may exert beneficial effects against abeta burden and harmful effects on microvascular pathology in ad. background alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is characterized by extracellular abeta deposition , intracellular neurofibrillary tangles , neuronal loss , and cerebral microvascular pathology , resulting in progressive learning and memory deficits [ 1 - 3 ] .
extensive evidence supports a dynamic role for inflammation in the ad pathogenesis .
microglia , the macrophages that reside in the central nervous system , are activated around abeta deposits in the brains of ad patients [ 4 ] .
levels of inflammatory mediators including tnf - alpha and c - reactive protein ( crp ) are also increased in the peripheral blood of ad patients [ 5,6 ] and associated with increased risk of ad [ 7,8 ] .
activated microglia / macrophages derived from the brain and blood produce chemokines , cytokines , and free radicals , which participate in abeta plaque formation and the neurodegenerative process in ad [ 9 - 13 ] .
several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the relative risk of ad is significantly reduced in rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) patients treated with nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) for longer than 2 yrs [ 14,15 ] .
in meta - analysis of 17 epidemiological studies , protective effects of arthritis and anti - inflammatory drugs have been observed against ad [ 15 ] .
these studies have raised the hypothesis that anti - inflammatory drug treatment protects against ad , but arthritis or ra itself could modulate ad risk .
cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , an inducible cyclooxygenase known to mediate inflammation in ra and ad , has been proposed as a positive regulator for amyloid plaque formation and cognitive deficit in ad. in support of this hypothesis , administration of ibuprofen , a mixed cox - 1 / cox - 2 inhibitor , reduces microglial activation , abeta production , plaque burden , and cognitive impairment in tg2576 mice [ 16,17 ] .
amyloid plaque formation is enhanced in app / ps1 mice overexpressing human cox - 2 [ 18 ] .
however , the beneficial effects of nsaids have not been verified in randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials for ad patients [ 19 ] .
in such clinical trials , nsaids were administered for less than 1 yr due to increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving nsaids for longer than 18 months [ 20 ] .
in a recent report from alzheimer 's disease anti - inflammatory prevention trial ( adapt ) with nsaids , treatment of asymptomatic individuals with naproxen for 2 yr was shown to reduce incidence of ad after 2 to 3 yr [ 21 ] .
therefore , the preventive and disease - modifying potential of nsaids remains to be determined in ad patients treated with nsaids for a long period of time (> 2 yrs ) .
in a recent study , amyloid plaque formation and cognitive impairment were reduced in ad mice that were subjected to subcutaneous administration of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) , an inflammatory cytokine shown to increase in ra , for 20 d [ 22 ] .
combined with findings from epidemiological studies indicating that the incidence of ad is reduced in ra patients with prolonged nsaid treatment , ra is expected to directly modulate ad onset and progression .
to examine this hypothesis , 2 - month - old app / ps1 mice were injected with bovine type ii collagen ( cii ) in complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ) , which has been widely used to induce ra in rodents [ 23 ] .
abeta burden , microglia / macrophages , and cerebral vascular pathology were investigated in app / ps1 mice 4 months after the injections of cii in cfa to determine whether ra directly modulates amyloidosis and microvascular pathology in ad. results induction of collagen - induced arthritis ( cia ) in app / ps1 mice app / ps1 mice and wild - type littermates injected with cii in cfa revealed pathologic features of ra. paw swelling and redness of the joint were manifest immediately after the second immunization , reached a peak 1 month later , and significantly persisted over the next 4 months when animals were sacrificed ( figure 1a , p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast to cia induced paw swelling in all four paws in dba / 1 mice [ 23 ] , paw swelling was confined to the injection site in wild - type and app / ps1 mice .
plasma levels of the pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 1beta and tnf - alpha were increased within 1 d after the second immunization and remained elevated over the next 4 weeks in wild - type and app / ps1 mice ( figure 1b , p < 0.05 ) .
paraffin - embedded joint sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed severe bone erosion , cartilage / chondrocyte degradation , and proliferative synovitis in wild - type ( figure 1c ) at 4 months after the second immunization .
such joint pathology was similar in app / ps1 mice treated with cia ( data not shown ) .

note severe bone erosion , degradation of cartilage and chondrocytes , and intensive proliferation of synovial tissue in ankle joint 4 months after injection of cia .
effects of cia on amyloid plaque pathology in app / ps1 mice we examined the effect of cia on abeta deposition in app / ps1 mice .
app / ps1 mice received cii in cfa at 2 months of age before abeta deposition was evolved .
when abeta deposition was analyzed 4 months after cia , levels of abeta deposition were moderate in app / ps1 mice [ 24 ] .
abeta plaques were widespread in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 6 - month - old app / ps1 mice ( figure 2a ) .
contrary to expectations , cia substantially reduced abeta plaque accumulation in app / ps1 mice .
image analysis of abeta deposition showed that abeta plaques that were positive for 4g8 or thioflavine - s were significantly reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 6 - month - old app / ps1 mice treated with cia , compared with vehicle - treated app / ps1 mice ( figure 2b ) .
the effect of cia on abeta levels was analyzed in the opposite hemisphere using an elisa that detects sds - soluble and sds - insoluble abeta 40 and abeta 42 .
levels of soluble abeta 40 and abeta 42 appeared reduced by 48 % ( p = 0.056 ) and 20 % ( p = 0.026 ) in app / ps1 mice 4 months after cia , respectively , compared with vehicle - treated app / ps1 mice .
app / ps1 mice treated with cia revealed substantially significant reduction in levels of insoluble abeta 40 and abeta 42 ( figure 2c , p < 0.05 ) .

enhanced activation of microglia / macrophage in app / ps1 mice 4 months after cia cia - induced systemic inflammation likely triggers brain inflammation that contributes to internalization and degradation of abeta through activated microglia .
iba - 1 or mac - 1 - immunoreactive microglial cells were observed in the brains of wild - type mice and increased in the brains of app / ps1 mice at 6 months of age ( figure 3a ) .
immunoreactive mac - 1 positive cells were transiently increased in the cortex and hippocampus of wild - type mice over the course of 1 d after the second immunization injection .
however , by 2 weeks after cia mac - 1 immunoreactivity had returned to levels that were comparable to the levels in vehicle - injected mice ( additional file 1 ) .
in app / ps1 mice treated with cia , the number of iba - 1 or 1 - immunoreactive cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus increased 4 months later .
cd45 - positive activated microglia or macrophages were not observed in wild - type mice at 4 months after cia ( figure 3a ) .
activated microglia or macrophages were observed in the cortex of 6 - month - old app / ps1 mice and increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of app / ps1 mice treated with cia up to approximately 210 % ( the number of cd45 - immunoreactivity ) and 230 % ( the area of cd45 - immunoreactivity ) ( figure 3a , b , p < 0.05 ) .
immunoreactivity to il - 1beta and tnf - alpha was increased in microglia and astrocytes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of app / ps1 mice compared to wild - type as previously reported [ 25 - 27 ] .
cia further increased expression of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha in app / ps1 mice ( figure 3a ) .
in cia - treated app / ps1 mice , iba - 1 - positive or cd45 - positive cells were observed adjacent to abeta plaques ( figure 3c ) .

effects of cia on permeability of the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) in app / ps1 mice cia has been shown to increase bbb permeability in dba / 1 mice [ 28 ] .
cia likely causes the infiltration of monocytes and activation of microglia / macrophages that contribute to clearance of abeta peptide in app / ps1 mice [ 29 ] .
immunoreactivity to a macrophage mannose receptor ( cd206 ) antibody was observed sparsely in the perivascular and leptomeningeal regions of wild - type and app / ps1 mice .
cd206 - positive macrophages were increased in the vicinity of vessels in wild - type and app / ps1 mice subjected to cia ( figure 4a ) , suggesting the possibility that cia induces the migration of macrophages into the brain parenchyma through the disrupted bbb .
in support of this hypothesis , levels of immunoglobulin g ( igg ) were significantly increased in the brains of wild - type and app / ps1 mice 1.5 and 4 months after cia compared with relevant vehicle ( figure 4b and 4c ) .
figure 4 cia enhances macrophages at the leptomeningeal and perivascular regions and bbb permeability in app / ps1 mice .

cia induces cerebral microvascular pathology in app / ps1 mice finally , we examined whether cia would cause cerebrovascular pathology .
cerebral microvessels were immunolabeled with an anti - collagen type iv antibody , a marker of the endothelial basement membrane .
cia significantly reduced vascular density and length in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of app / ps1 mice 4 months later ( figure 5 , a and 5b ) .
cia also induced cerebral microvascular pathology , such as vascular segments and atrophic string vessels ( figure 5c ) .
at 4 months after the injection procedure , survival of vehicle - treated app / ps1 mice was approximately 93.3 % , while the survival of cia - treated mice was reduced to 76.9 % ( additional file 2 ) .

discussion administration of cii in cfa produces features of ra including joint swelling , bone and cartilage degeneration , synovitis , and infiltration of inflammatory cells at the injection sites accompanied by sustained elevation of il - 1beta and tnf - 1beta in plasma of wild - type and app / ps1 mice .
cia reduces levels of abeta and plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus of app / ps1 mice .
the reduced amyloidosis is associated with bbb disruption and activation of microglia / macrophage .
in contrast to the clearance of abeta plaques , cia enhances microcerebral pathology and mortality in app / ps1 mice .
inflammation can reduce amyloidosis and cognitive deficit in transgenic mouse models of ad. amyloid plaque formation is enhanced in app / ps1 mice overexpressing human cox - 2 , the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase that is essential for prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) - mediated inflammation [ 30 ] .
chronic administration of ibuprofen , a mixed cox - 1 / cox - 2 inhibitor , prevents microglial activation , and reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines , abeta , and amyloid plaque formation in tg2576 mice [ 16,17,31 ] .
the administration of cox - 2 inhibitors prevents abeta - mediated suppression of long - term plasticity and improves synaptic plasticity in tg2576 [ 18 ] .
cox - 2 - mediated pge2 production can enhance amyloidosis by reducing the phagocytic function of microglia and stimulating abeta production through activation of the prostaglandin e2 and e4 receptors [ 32,33 ] .
several lines of evidence suggest that inflammation negatively regulates amyloidosis and cognitive deficit in transgenic mouse models of ad. overexpression of tgf - beta1 or il - 6 reduces amyloid plaque formation through microglial activation in tg2576 and tgcrnd8 mice [ 34,35 ] .
administration of g - csf or m - csf induces brain inflammation and ameliorates amyloid pathology and cognitive deficit in transgenic ad mice , including tg 2576 [ 36,37 ] .
the intracerebral infection of borna disease virus , which induces microglial cell activation , also reduces amyloid plaque formation in tg2576 mice [ 38 ] .
furthermore , overexpression of soluble complement receptor - related protein y , a complement inhibitor , reduces microglial activation , produces neurodegeneration , and enhances abeta production and accumulation in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice bearing the amyloidogenic k670m , n671l , and v717f mutations [ 39 ] .
abeta produced in the brains of app / ps1 mice or ad patients induces the expression and secretion of chemotactic cytokines , such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 , which enhances the transmigration and differentiation of monocytes from the bloodstream [ 40 - 42 ] .
circulating monocytes are increased in cia - treated mice or ra patients , and are expected to transmigrate through the bbb into the brain areas exposed to abeta .
the brain monocytes can be differentiated into macrophages by cytokines such as m - csf and il - 6 , which are induced by abeta or after cia [ 35,43 - 47 ] .
macrophages and activated microglia contribute to abeta clearance .
alternatively , cia may reduce the abeta plaque burden by increasing passive transport to the periphery through increased bbb disruption .
abeta accumulation in the cerebral vessel triggers bbb disruption by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins such as occludin , claudin - 5 , and zona occludins - 1 [ 48 ] .
abeta can induce oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction , and the activation of caspase - dependent apoptotic pathways , possibly through mechanisms involving interaction with rage , resulting in endothelial cell degeneration [ 48 - 50 ] .
in the present study , we provide evidence that cia - treated app / ps1 mice develop vascular segments and atrophic string vessels characteristic of cerebrovascular pathology observed in ad patients .
alzheimer 's disease is occasionally accompanied by epileptic seizures [ 51 ] .
cortical and hippocampal seizures are detected in three different app transgenic mice models of ad [ 52 ] .
seizures are frequently observed in app / ps1 mice at 3 and 4.5 months of age and correlated with mortality that peaks at 3 to 4 months of age [ 53 ] .
in the present study , two app / ps1 mice died at 3 to 4 months of age ( 6.7 % mortality ) .
in thirty nine app / ps1 mice treated with cia , nine mice died at 3 to 4 months of age ( 23.1 % mortality ) .
thereafter , no death was observed .
thus , cia may increase mortality of app / ps1 mice by enhancing seizures , which is likely related with sustained inflammation and enhanced cerebrovascular pathology .
while further study is needed to delineate mechanisms underlying the effects of cia on vascular pathology , elevated monocytes and neutrophils in cia - treated app / ps1 mice likely migrate to the cerebral vessel , release cytotoxic molecules such as superoxide , matrix metalloproteases , and tnf - alpha , and then contribute to endothelial cell degeneration and mortality in a cooperative way with abeta .
recently , systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide for 6 weeks was shown to induce sustained microglial activation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of 3x tg - ad mice harboring three mutant human genes ( appk670n ; m671l , ps1m146v , and taup301l ) [ 54 ] .
considering that lipopolysaccharide triggers systemic inflammation and bbb disruption , cia may exacerbate tau pathology as well as vascular pathology in ad. conclusions cia induced before the onset of amyloid pathology reduces abeta burden over 4 months in app / ps1 mice , presumably by enhancing the clearance and efflux of abeta .
however , such beneficial effects of cia are accompanied by enhanced microvascular pathology and mortality .
the present findings suggest that transient systemic inflammation may be beneficial in lowering abeta burden ; however , the chronic systemic inflammation demonstrated in ra is a serious risk factor for cerebral microvascular pathology and hypoperfusion in ad , which likely lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficit .
methods animal preparation all experiments were performed in accordance with the guideline for animal experiments of ajou university and gnt pharma .
app / ps1 mice ( appswe / ps1de9 ) were purchased from the jackson laboratory ( bar harbor , me , usa ) .

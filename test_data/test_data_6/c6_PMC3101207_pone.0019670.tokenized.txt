the space of possible protein structures appears vast and continuous , and the relationship between primary , secondary and tertiary structure levels is complex .
protein structure comparison and classification is therefore a difficult but important task since structure is a determinant for molecular interaction and function .
we introduce a novel mathematical abstraction based on geometric topology to describe protein domain structure .
using the locations of the backbone atoms and the hydrogen bonds , we build a combinatorial object - a so - called fatgraph .
the description is discrete yet gives rise to a 2 - dimensional mathematical surface .
thus , each protein domain corresponds to a particular mathematical surface with characteristic topological invariants , such as the genus ( number of holes ) and the number of boundary components .
both invariants are global fatgraph features reflecting the interconnectivity of the domain by hydrogen bonds .
we introduce the notion of robust variables , that is variables that are robust towards minor changes in the structure / fatgraph , and show that the genus and the number of boundary components are robust .
further , we invesigate the distribution of different fatgraph variables and show how only four variables are capable of distinguishing different folds .
we use local ( secondary ) and global ( tertiary ) fatgraph features to describe domain structures and illustrate that they are useful for classification of domains in cath .
in addition , we combine our method with two other methods thereby using primary , secondary , and tertiary structure information , and show that we can identify a large percentage of new and unclassified structures in cath .
introduction protein domains are protein subsequences that may fold and function independently of the rest of the protein [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
experimentally determined protein structures deposited in pdb [ 3 ] have been classified according to their fold and function in hierarchical databases of which cath [ 4 ] and scop [ 5 ] are the most widely used .
these databases involve manual steps , assisted by computational methods , for fold characterization and classification [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
the database dali [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , on the other hand , uses a fully automated procedure to classify domains non - hierarchically based on structural similarities only .
other methods have been proposed to reduce the description of a domain fold to a vector of numerical attributes that are characteristic for the fold [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ; recent methods are , for instance , based on geometric characteristics [ 11 ] - [ 14 ] , secondary structure information [ 15 ] - [ 18 ] , sequence information [ 19 ] , and physical properties derived from the primary sequence [ 20 ] .
these methods might be useful , not only for classification , but also for annotation and understanding features of protein folding .
using techniques from geometric topology , we propose a novel mathematical abstraction for studying protein domain structures [ 21 ] .
in particular , we conceive the structure as a fatgraph [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , which is a graph in the ordinary sense extended in a particular way to be explained below .
fatgraphs have been used for studying various problems in mathematical physics ; here we investigate their use for studying complex molecular structures .
the construction of a fatgraph corresponding to a protein domain is illustrated in fig. 1. the peptide unit is the basic unit of description in our model disregarding the amino acid residue .
in fig. 1a , the - th and - st peptide units of a protein domain are shown .
each peptide unit is a planar region [ 23 ] and is represented as a building block with two stubs corresponding to the oxygen and hydrogen atoms ( fig. 1b ) .
the domain backbone is thus depicted as a series of concatenated building blocks. fig. 1c shows four such building blocks with one hydrogen bond between two peptide units indicated by an edge connecting the h - stub of the first building block with the o - stub of the last .
subsequently , each edge ( hydrogen bond and link between building blocks , termed alpha carbon linkage ) is considered as twisted or not twisted ( untwisted ) depending on the relative orientations of the peptide units in physical space ( fig. 1d ; materials and methods , section 1 ) .
finally , each edge is widened to become a strip ( fig. 1e ) , hence the term fatgraph .
the strip is twisted whenever a twisted bond is encountered , similar to how a piece of paper is twisted when forming a mobius band .
in fig. 1f , the surface is shown without the underlying fatgraph .
the two twists in fig. 1f cancel each other , and the resulting strip is equivalent , homeomorphic in the parlance of topology , to a sphere with the regions around the north and south poles removed ( fig. 1g and materials and methods , section 2 ) .
the concept of a homeomorphism is exemplified in fig. 2 , where a cube is continuously transformed into a sphere .
this also illustrates why geometric topology is often referred to as rubber - sheet geometry .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g001 figure 1 the fatgraph construction .
( a ) two neighbouring peptide units of a protein domain labelled as the - th and - st unit and the vector triple defining the associated coordinate system of unit . the vector follows the direction of the bond - , is perpindicular to and points towards the same side as , and is constructed to form a right - handed coordinate system ( b ) concatenated building blocks ( one block shown in red ) , representing a backbone of four peptide units .
vertical stubs correspond to and . ( c ) same as ( b ) but with one hydrogen bond attached .
( d ) hydrogen bonds and alpha carbon linkages are labelled according to the relative orientations of the coordinate frames in ( a ) such that little change in the orientation results in an untwisted edge ( materials and methods , section 1 ) ; = untwisted and x = twisted .
( e ) the fattening of the graph is illustrated by colored lines depicting the margins ( boundaries ) of the strip .
the strip is twisted whenever a twisted bond is encountered .
( f ) the band in ( e ) with the underlying graph removed .
( g ) the two adjacent twists cancel out , resulting in band similar to a sphere with two discs removed .
it has two boundary components ( blue and red ) .
in ( c ) the hydrogen bond may also be drawn around the right end of the backbone or even cross over or under .
the fatgraph is not sensitive to how the hydrogen bonds are drawn and all possibilities yield the same surface .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g002 figure 2 inflation of a cube with one boundary component constitutes an example of a homeomorphism .
the inflation happens without breaking the surface , and only bending and stretching are used .
in general , the surface corresponding to a fatgraph is homeomorphic to a particular - dimensional surface , implying that a fatgraph can be studied by algebraic topological methods and categorized using concepts going back to the work of leonhard euler in the th century [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] .
for example , when allowing self - intersections during deformation as well as insertions and deletions of full twists , the resulting class of surfaces is uniquely determined by its genus , number of boundary components , and whether it is orientable or not [ 24 ] .
a surface is called orientable if it is possible to define a consistent orientation ( e.g. defined by the right - hand rule ) on the entire surface .
the strip in fig. 1 is orientable , whereas the mobius band is not : one may start a walk from any point and come back again upside - down .
the variables and are examples of topological invariants which are quantities that do not change when the surface is bent or stretched ( i.e. changed under homeomorphic transformations ) .
the euler characteristic , defined for any surface as , is another invariant summarizing the overall shape of a surface in a single number .
in the special case of surfaces arising from fatgraphs of proteins , the euler characteristic can be computed directly from the fatgraph .
in fact , one may show that , where is the number of hydrogen bonds [ 21 ] .
as demonstrated in fig. 1e , the number of boundary components is easily counted , whereas the modified genus is less transparent .
however , by using the two alternative descriptions of the euler characteristic , we may express in terms of simpler quantities , . thus , has direct biologial interpretation ( in terms of number of hydrogen bonds ) whereas and are quantities derived through the fatgraph abstraction .
the surface in fig. 1 is a sphere () with two boundary components () , one for each of the removed discs ( that is the north and south poles ) , and the structure has only one hydrogen bond .
in particular , the alternative expression agrees with . the fatgraph abstraction thus opens an entirely new perspective on protein structure by replacing complex structures by much simpler constructs .
an example of a surface corresponding to a domain fatgraph is shown in fig. 3. the cath protein domain 1ptof00 is a mixed alpha - beta domain classified as ob fold and has and . the corresponding surface is non - orientable and thus has only one side ( up and down are the same ) , just like a mobius band .
furthermore , the surface has discs cut out , each giving rise to a boundary component .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g003 figure 3 the protein domain 1ptof00 is an alpha - beta domain classified as ob fold ( dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase , e2p ; 2.40.50 ) .
the corresponding surface is not orientable and has genus and boundary components .
the surface is homeomorphic to two tori connected to a klein bottle with discs removed .
the surface is difficult to visualize in 3d ; in the figure the handle crosses through the bottle with no physical contact .
we demonstrate that the global variables and capture structural differences in domains .
we show this by example and also by analysis of the distributions of and values over domains .
further , we illustrate how , and other fatgraph variables can be utilized for classification .
in addition to the global variables , the fatgraph abstraction allows us to introduce a simple local or secondary structure annotation , namely the backbone as a sequence of twisted and untwisted edges .
using machine learning techniques , the usefulness of the fatgraph abstraction is illustrated by classification of domains in the cath database .
we compare to an alternative geometric approach [ 11 ] and to an approach based on sequence information only .
we show that combining information from all three makes a very strong classifier .
further , we investigate the causes of false predictions and show that our methods are able to detect domains in v3.3.0 with classifications that are non - existing in the previous version , v3.2.0 .
the classification scheme devises a method for flagging domains as possible new or problematic folds .
results robust variables for each domain we compute the corresponding fatgraph and calculate four robust variables derived from it ( materials and methods , section 3 and fig. 4 ) .
robust variables are defined such that they are relatively insensitive to noisy and imprecise experimental data ; that is , noise in data that may result in errors in the fatgraph .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g004 figure 4 the four basic modifications of fatgraphs .
variables defined on a fatgraph that change at most linearly with the number of basic modifications are called robust .
i ) change the color of a bond between peptide units , ii ) change the color of a hydrogen bond , iii ) add or remove an untwisted hydrogen bond , and iv ) replace a fatgraph building block by two building blocks connected by an untwisted alpha carbon linkage , where any edges corresponding to hydrogen bonds incident on the original building block are connected to the replacement building block that occurs first along the backbone from n to c termini , and the reverse of this operation .
any fatgraph can be created from an arbitrary starting fatgraph by repeated application of i ) - iv ) .
we represent a domain by four robust variables , among these the genus and the number of boundary components of the corresponding surface .
these variables are global in the sense that they cannot be related to any particular region of the domain .
furthermore , we consider the domain length , measured as the number of amino acid residues , and the number of twisted alpha carbon linkages that measures how often the backbone twists in the orientation of the planar peptide units ( fig. 1d ) .
recall that insertions and deletions of full twists are not captured in and , but this is compensated for in ( fig. 1f ) .
the cath database classifies domains in a hierarchical scheme with four main levels ( listed from the top and down ) called class ( c ) , architecture ( a ) , topology ( t ) , and homologous superfamily ( h ) , hence the name cath [ 4 ] , [ 25 ] .
at the c - level domains are grouped according to their secondary structure content into four categories with the three main ones being mainly alpha , mainly beta , and mixed alpha - beta .
the last category contains domains with only very few secondary structures .
the a - level groups domains according to the general orientations of their secondary structures , and at the t - level the connectivity ( the order ) of the secondary structures is taken into account .
the grouping of domains at the h - level is based on a combination of both sequence similarity and a measure of structural similarity .
below the four main lavels , cath has an additional five layers called s , o , l , i , and d. the first four group domains according to increasing sequence overlap and similarity , and the d - level assigns a unique identifier to every domain thus ensuring that no two domains have the exact same cathsolid classification. fig. 5 shows an example of how and separate domains at different cathsolid levels .
it transpires that the best separation is obtained at t - , h - , and s - levels .
the grouping at the a - level is often very broad , and an architecture may comprise domains of very different sizes .
furthermore , since the order of the secondary structure elements is not taken into account at the a - level , a single architecture may contain domains with very different connectivities [ 4 ] , [ 25 ] .
this is likely the explanation for the lack of separation of a - levels observed in fig. 5. on the other hand , because the fatgraph approach is based on structural features , we do not expect to see a clear separation at the solid levels , since these are defined in terms of sequence overlap and similarity. fig. 6 shows that and separate the h - level families in the cath topology pectate lyase c - like ( cath classification 2.160.20 ) with one family ( red in fig. 6 ) being larger than the others .
to test the empirical robustness of the variables , we generated modified structures for each domain using the concoord algorithm [ 26 ] and calculated and from the resulting structures ( fig. 6 and materials and methods , section 4 ) .
the figure indicates that even after modifications , the variables are able to separate domains at the h - level .
furthermore , for individual domains , the variables did not in general deviate significantly from the original values ( illustrated in fig. s2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g005 figure 5 the domain 1o88a00 is classified as pectate lyase c - like ( 2.160.20 ) with complete cathsolid classification 2.160.20.10.11.2.1.1.1 .
the class plot shows for all domains with ( colored according to a - level ) , and the architecture plot shows for all domains with ( colored according to the three t - levels ) .
this continues all the ways down to the last plot where are shown for for . 10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g006 figure 6 robustness of topological invariants to noise .
left : scatter plots of and for domains in cath topology pectate lyase c - like ( 2.160.20 ) .
the five h - levels are indicated by different colors ( to domains in size ) , and a clear separation of h - levels is observed .
right : and calculated from concoord modified structures .
even with noise , separation at h - levels is still clearly visible .
note that in the bottom right corner in the left figure there are eight red dots without counterparts in the right figure .
the number of hydrogen bonds typically increases when a domain is modified using concoord , but the eight domains corresponding to the missing dots each showed a decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds ( fig s1 ) .
distribution of fatgraph variables fig. 7 shows a scatter plot of , , and for the three main classes ( c - level ) in v.3.3.0 .
generally , the mainly alpha domains have lower and higher than the mainly beta domains with the mixed alpha - beta domains falling in between .
for example , mainly alphas have many domains with corresponding to a sphere with discs cut out .
for small values of and , almost all combinations are found , but for higher values , only a small fraction of all possible combinations are observed .
more details are shown in figs. s3 - s4 , with pairwise scatterplots of the variables , , , , and the euler characteristic . empirically , fairly sharp boundaries appear for possible values , and longer domains tend to have higher values of both , , and than shorter domains .
a total of domains are non - orientable , and only domains are orientable .
we expect this because a single twisted hydrogen bond may introduce a mobius band and potentially alter the orientability of the corresponding surface : for example , in fig. 1 the two adjacent twists cancel out , and the surface becomes orientable , but removing one of the existing twist or adding an extra twist along the backbone results in a mobius band .
similarly , moving the right - most end of the hydrogen bond one stub to the left , thus separating the two twists , yields two mobius bands which do not cancel out .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g007 figure 7 scatter plot of for all domains in the three main classes mainly alpha ( red ) , mainly beta ( blue ) , and mixed alpha - beta ( green ) .
visually , the mainly alpha and mainly beta domains are separated with the mixed alpha - beta domains residing in between .
structural divergence may be caused by only modest modifications at the amino acid sequence level , and we compared how differences in sequences are reflected in the topological invariants. fig. 8 shows scatter plots of normalized alignment scores ( materials and methods , section 7 ) versus normalized differences in and , respectively , for all pairs of s95 - domains in the topology pectate lyase c - like ( 2.60.120 ) .
in general , low sequence similarity implies relatively large differences in and with only a few outliers .
for example , three domains have sequences very similar to that of 2iq7a00 ( alignment score ) , but still the normalized differences in ( resp. ) are almost ( resp .
). this may be explained by a lower number of hydrogen bonds in 2iq7a00 compared with the three other domains - a feature captured by the topological invariants but not by sequences alone .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g008 figure 8 alignment scores versus differences in and for all pairs of s95 - domains in the pectate lyase c - like topology ( 2.160.20 ) .
we use the normalized difference between modified genera ( and similarly for boundary components ) to take discrepancies in domain length into account .
a high alignment score indicates high sequence similarity and the plot illustrates that similarity is at the primary and tertiary levels are correlated .
to further assess the ability of the four fatgraph variables to distinguish different folds , we performed pairwise wilcoxon tests comparing the distributions of each variable using the 1,161 h - level families in v3.3.0 containing ten or more domains ( in total domains or of all domains ) .
the results are summarized in fig. s5 , and the plot indicates that in general the four variables are sufficient to distinguish most h - levels .
in fact , at significance level , almost all pairs of h - levels () are distinguishable by at least three of the four variables .
secondary structure elements the secondary structure is a particularly rigid part of a protein structure , and this is reflected in the corresponding fatgraph. fig. 9 depicts idealized fatgraphs arising from the three most common secondary structure motifs : ( a ) alpha helices , ( b ) parallel beta sheets , and ( c ) anti - parallel beta sheets with typical boundary components indicated by dashed red lines .
all boundary components pass through exactly four different peptide units , and the backbone of an alpha helix consists of untwisted edges , whereas the backbone of a beta sheet consists of twisted edges .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g009 figure 9 fatgraphs corresponding to the common secondary structures .
( a ) alpha helix , ( b ) parallel beta sheet , and ( c ) anti - parallel beta sheet .
each boundary component ( dashed red line ) passes through four peptide units ; the alpha helix is local in that it connects only closely situated peptide units whereas the beta sheet also connects peptide units potentially far away from each other .
the number of components depends on the length of the structure .
the less frequently occurring - helices and - helices give rise to similar pictures as ( a ) , the only difference is that hydrogen bonds connect stubs three and five peptide units apart instead of four .
the backbone of an - helix is a string of untwisted alpha carbon linkages , whereas for the - sheets these are twisted .
a domain consisting of one long alpha helix has genus zero , and the number of boundary components is proportional to the length of the domain .
likewise , a beta sheet contributes to the number of boundary components proportionally to the sheet size and only marginally to the genus .
the apparently abstract topological quantities thus exhibit direct relationships to the secondary structures of the domains ( fig. s6 ) .
this observation agrees with the empirical result above that the main cath classes show differences in the distribution of and . non - additivity of fatgraph variables the topological quantities corresponding to an entire domain cannot be obtained directly by adding quantities from individual secondary structure components alone ; most domains have stabilizing hydrogen bonds between secondary structure elements , and these contribute in a non - linear fashion to the fatgraph .
this non - additivity is e.g. reflected in the mainly alpha class ( fig. s6 ) , where the genus increases with increasing number of alpha helices ( despite each has ) because the helices are stabilized by bonds between them .
the lack of additivity is perhaps even clearer when considering entire proteins comprising multiple domains .
as a concrete example , consider the protein 1dar ( fig. 10 ) with five cath domains .
considered as one contiguous structure , 1dar has and , but the genera and boundary components corresponding to the individual domains add up to and , respectively .
examples where the genus ( resp. the number of boundary components ) of the entire protein is smaller ( resp .
larger ) than the sum of those corresponding to the individual domains also exist .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g010 figure 10 the protein 1dar comprises five cath domains with individual genera , and , and , and boundary components .
the entire protein considered as one contiguous structure has and , but the sums of the individual and are and . the robust variables and are thus not additive .
the figure is made using pymol ( www.pymol.org ) .
despite the relatively high deviation of and from the sums obtained from the individual constituents of a structure , the euler characteristic is generally more consistent .
in the example 1dar , the sum of the euler characteristics is compared to for the entire protein .
if there are domains , then where index refers to the th domain , . that is , the difference between of the entire protein and the sum is , where denotes the number of bonds between domains .
since , in general there are fewer hydrogen bonds between domains than within , the sum is close to of the whole protein .
classification using robust variables we attempted to reproduce the cath classification using only the four robust variables , , , , and . we applied different classification techniques to the data and found that the method random forests [ 27 ] generally performed well .
in v3.2.0 ( sall , see materials and methods , sections 5 ) , we selected the largest h - levels ( of all domains ) and randomly sampled of the domains for training , while keeping for testing ( materials and methods , sections 5 and 6 ) .
in addition , we tested the classifier on the new domains in v3.3.0 that are not already in v3.2.0. fig. 11 shows the results .
we assigned of the domains in v3.2.0 into their correct h - level , whereas , and are correctly assigned at the t - , a - , and c - level , respectively .
for the new domains in v3.3.0 , the percentages are smaller : ( h ) , ( t ) , ( a ) , and ( c ) .
when the classifier makes a correct prediction , it does so with high confidence whereas it is less certain when making a false prediction , and a similar lack of confidence is observed when the classifier is applied to domains which have not been assigned a classification by cath or domains with h - levels that are new in v3.3.0 ( fig. 12 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g011 figure 11 classification at h - level using , , , and . left : distributions of success rates for the largest h - levels in the cath 3.2.0 test set ( black ) and the new domains in cath 3.3.0 ( red ) .
middle : success rates for the cath 3.2.0 training set plotted against h - level sizes .
average success rates are indicated by lines .
right : in the cath 3.2.0 test set , h - levels contain domains with s - levels not present in the training set .
in all but cases ( green ) , the classifier performs better on the domains with known s - level .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g012 figure 12 the classifier consists of a collection ( forest ) of classification trees .
for each domain in the test set , each classification tree votes , and a consensus is reached .
we used trees , and for each domain we calculated the percentages , and , of the most frequent and the second most frequent votes occuring .
the top plots show the distributions of and for the correctly and wrongly classified domains at the h - level in v3.2.0 .
if is large , the majority of votes are cast for the top two candidates , and if furthermore is large , many more votes have been cast for the winner compared to the runner - up. therefore , if both and are large , this indicates that the classifier makes a confident prediction .
the distributions of and for correctly predicted domains show that the confidence in correct predictions is generally high .
on the other hand , confidence in wrong predictions is much more uniform .
the bottom plots show the distributions corresponding to the newly added domains in v3.3.0 with non - existent classification in v3.2.0 and the domains for which cath has not yet provided a classification .
both show the same kind of uncertainty as observed for the wrongly classified domains .
performances for other selections of variables at the h - level are shown in fig. s7 .
we found that the domain length is an important variable for correct prediction ( an observation also made in [ 11 ]) .
we also varied the energy cut - off used to infer hydrogen bonds ( materials and methods , section 1 ) .
the resulting values of the robust variables are strongly correlated with those calculated using the default cut - off , and the classification results did not change significantly ( fig. s7 ) .
some of the largest families show a remarkable homogeneity in - and - values across domains ( fig. s8 ) , which to some extent stands in contrast to reports indicating structural diversity within h - levels based on rmsd measures [ 28 ] .
our approach may therefore provide an important complement to existing classification schemes .
the performance is generally lower on the new domains in v3.3.0 than on the domains in v3.2.0 .
the lower performance could in principle be due to skewness in family sizes in the two data sets , but this is not observed ( fig. s9 ) .
to further explore this discrepancy , we used the s - level immediately below the h - level as a proxy for the complexity of the h - levels. fig. 11 shows that the classifier performs much better on domains with known s - level ( i.e. , s - levels that are associated with domains in the h - level training set ) than on domains with unknown s - level ( i.e. , s - levels not found for any domain in the training set ) .
furthermore , of the new domains have unknown s - levels while this was only the case for of the domains in the v3.2.0 testing set .
in the training set , this must be due to sampling whereas in the new set , the difference is mainly caused by genuinely new s - levels introduced in v3.3.0 .
this finding indicates that the known s - levels and the s - levels new in v3.3.0 , despite being defined based on sequence similarity , also differ in their fatgraph characteristics .
classification using flip sequences the domain example in fig. 1d comprises three alpha carbon linkages , one untwisted and two twisted .
reading from left to right , the conformations may be represented as a string utt with u ( t ) meaning untwisted ( twisted ) .
in this way , each cath domain has an associated sequence of these letters of length one less than the number of peptide units , and we refer to this sequence as the flip sequence .
alpha helices and beta sheets have particularly simple flip sequences , namely , uuu ... and ttt ... , respectively ( fig. 9 ) .
the alignment score computed from an alignment of two flip sequences gives a measure of similarity between the corresponding domains , and we applied this score to build an alternative cath classifier using flip sequences ( secondary level ) rather than robust variables ( tertiary level ) .
to do so , we randomly selected 2 / 3 of all domains in v3.2.0 ( s95 or sall ; materials and methods , section 5 ) for training , keeping 1 / 3 for testing .
in addition , the domains that are new in v3.3.0 or unclassified in v3.3.0 were also kept for testing .
for all domain pairs in the training set , we calculated the pairwise , normalized alignment score ( materials and methods , section 7 ) .
subsequently , we defined the similarity between a domain and an h - level ( similarly for c - , a - , and t - levels ) as ( 1 ) for each , we identified the two h - levels with the highest scores ( fig. 13 ) .
in the figure a green ( red ) dot indicates that the h - level with the highest score is the same ( not the same ) as that of . the relationship between the scores is clearly indicative of the h - level of . the scores for the two nearest h - levels were combined into one variable ( - score ) and a test was designed to facilitate comparison between methods ( materials and methods , section 7 ) .
the same procedure was adapted to amino acid sequences ( primary structure ) .
additionally , we compared to a geometric method for classification that uses tertiary structure information [ 11 ] in the following way : a domain is represented as a - component vector comprising the number of residues and quantities derived from a geometric description of the backbone curve .
the domain backbone is viewed as a piecewise linear curve in three dimensions with each piece corresponding to a bond , and the average number of crossings when the curve is viewed from all possible angles is computed .
this average crossing number is one of the variables used in the classification , and except the number of residues , the remaining variables are all generalizations ( known as gauss integrals ) of the average crossing number .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0019670.g013 figure 13 the plot shows the - score l for each domain in the cath 3.2.0 training set ( s95 ) for h - level , based on flip sequences .
the vertical dashed black line indicates the 95 % sensitivity decision threshold ; if the - score of a domain is above the line it is assigned the classification of the nearest h - level , otherwise it is left unassigned .
h - levels with only one domain in the test set cannot be classified in this way .
green = closest h - level is correct , red = closest h - level is wrong , blue = unclassifiable .
overall the results are comparable ( table 1 for s95 ) ; further results for s95 and sall are shown in table s1 with amino acid sequences generally performing better than gauss integrals and flip sequences .
all methods show a decrease in sensitivity and specificity for the domains that are new in v3.3.0 ( table s1 ) , which is similar to that observed for the robust variables though less pronounced and attributed to differences between the old and new domains , such as s - levels , indicating that the new domains are evolutionary more diverse than the old ones .

decision thresholds were calibrated on the cath 3.2.0 training set to achieve 95 % sensitivity .
levels comprising only a single domain in cath 3.2.0 are never included in the training set and thus account for the numbers in the unknown column ; for c - and a - levels , there are none of these .
we combined all three tests into one to achieve higher performance ( materials and methods , section 7 , and fig. 14 ) .
for s95 , the auc ( area under curve ) increases to 96 % for the combined test from 86 % ( flips ) , 90 % ( gauss ) , and 91 % ( amino acids ) for the individual methods .
in particular , for a sensitivity of 95 % , the specificity is at least 50 % higher for the combined test than on any of the individual tests individually .
likewise , the combined test is able to identify 78.4 % of all domains with unknown h - level in v3.2.0 , and 46.6 % of all domains that are unclassified in v3.3.0 .
for sall , the latter percentages raise to 100 % and 92.8 % , respectively , making the classifier very capable of detecting domains with structures potentially not in cath v3.3.0 .

discussion we discuss a new representation of protein structure and show how local and global variables vary across domains and structural classification .
the description makes use of concepts from geometric topology and represents a domain structure by a fatgraph that in turn can be interpreted as a 2 - dimensional surface .
the structure of the fatgraph relies on atomic coordinates of the protein and its hydrogen bonds but not on primary sequence information .
the representation provides a complementary and alternative view to structures as purely 3d geometric objects [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 11 ] - [ 14 ] and shows several strengths .
the domain structure is conceptualized in terms of entities that are amenable to further manipulation and characterization ; for example , we compute the genus and the number of boundary components that are both topological invariants .
even though several unrelated domains may share the same invariants , we are able to classify the majority of the domains correctly .
further , we have introduced the idea of a robust variable , namely , a variable defined on the fatgraph that is robust towards noise and errors in the experimental determination of the structure , and we have formulated robustness in terms of operations on the fatgraph and investigated the robustness empirically .
the invariants and of a domain cannot in general be computed from the secondary structures alone .
due to stabilizing bonds connecting secondary structure elements , and may differ significantly from what is obtained by summing the genera and the number of boundary components of individual secondary structure elements .
the invariants thus capture tertiary structure information .
we showed that using secondary structure information we could classify a large percentage of domains in s95 ( and sall ) correctly .
however , correct ( and better ) classification could also be achieved using other methods using primary or tertiary structure information .
we combined all three methods and achieved a method with higher performance as well as sensitivity and specificity .
the combined method is also able to identify the majority of unknown or unclassified domains .
we used the cath database as a gold standard , but using appropriate clustering algorithms it would be possible to make a de novo classification and compare this to existing classification .
given the observation that classification based on primary structures is best at reproducing the cath database , it is conceivable that a de novo classification based on structural properties alone would lead to a different hierarchy .
however , a de novo classification would require further investigations to e.g. determine the number of classes needed , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .
the lack of agreement between the two most widely used databases , cath and scop , certainly indicates that more analyses are needed in order to fully comprehend the universe of domain structures [ 29 ] .
automated approaches , including ours , benefit from not relying on human judgment .
however , a key difficulty is that structural and evolutionary homology does not always go hand in hand , and different protein families show a wide spectrum in sequence , structural and functional similarities [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 30 ] .
currently , the level of classification achieved by manually assisted methods , such as cath or scop , might not be realizable by automated means only , but we believe that advances in mathematical modeling of protein structure will change this in the future and that our model should be a step in this direction .
for example , it would be interesting to put our method into a probabilistic setting .
in recent papers , it has been shown that probabilistic models might have large potential [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
various extension of the fatgraph model are conceivable .
for example , one approach could be to include bifurcating hydrogen bonds in the model , as co and nh groups of the protein backbone engage in two or more hydrogen bonds [ 23 ] .
however , this phenomenon poses a mathematical question that must be addressed in a biologically meaningful way : the fatgraph model depends on an ordering of the edges around a vertex , and with bifurcating bonds there is no a priori way of choosing such orientations .
other extensions could be the inclusion of sulphur bridges , or extending the two types of edges ( backbone and hydrogen bonds ) to multiple types reflecting more accurately the twisting of the backbone .
materials and methods 1 .
fatgraph construction the fatgraph is constructed as explained in the main text , fig. 1. to each peptide unit we associate a coordinate system ( a frame ) .
if the frames of two linked peptide units are similar , the edge connecting them are untwisted and otherwise they are twisted .
' similar ' is here measured via a metric on frames , see [ 21 ] for details .
the procedure is identical to twisting if the sum of scalar products is negative [ 21 ] , a sum combining the change in the normal vector with the change in the orientation of the peptide plane .
for example , if the two frames are identical and the edge is not twisted ; whereas if frame is frame up - side - down , and the edge is twisted .
we infer hydrogen bonds using the dssp algorithm [ 33 ] .
the algorithm depends on an energy cut - off , and by default a hydrogen bond is inferred if the electrostatic interaction energy is lower than kcal / mol .
2. classification of surfaces and fatgraphs for integers , the following families of surfaces are particularly interesting : 1 ) a sphere with discs cut out , 2 ) the sum of tori with discs cut out , and 3 ) the sum of real projective planes with discs cut out .
the first two types can be visualized in 3d , whereas the last cannot ; 1 ) is straightforward , and 2 ) is a series of doughnuts glued together with discs removed .
two surfaces are called homeomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by stretching and bending but no tearing .
a classical result in algebraic topology [ 24 ] states that any closed connected surface is homeomorphic to exactly one of the surfaces above .
for example any deformation of a ballon is homeomorphic to a sphere and thus has . the number is called the genus , and is the number of discs or boundary components of the surface .
the surfaces in 1 ) and 2 ) are orientable , whereas the surfaces in 3 ) are not .
it follows that a surface is uniquely determined by its , , and whether it is orientable .
we define the modified genus as if the surface is orientable and as if it is non - orientable [ 21 ]. with this definition , the euler characteristic ( a term combining and ) is in either case .
the number of hydrogen bonds relates to through . the invariants , including whether the fatgraph is orientable , can be calculated computationally efficiently and quickly [ 21 ] .
for example , can readily be found from the fatgraph , whereas requires more work .
for small fatgraphs as the one in fig. 1 , is easily counted , but a more systematic approach must be applied when dealing with larger fatgraphs .
this may be accomplished by a purely algebraic approach which is easily implemented in a computer program [ 21 ] .
even using a naive and straight - forward implementation , parsing a domain and calculating the corresponding topological invariants takes less than a second on a standard laptop computer .
finally , follows from . note that by construction ( fig. 1e ) , a fatgraph corresponding to a protein always has a least one boundary component , that is . a general surface has and . 3. robust variables a function defined on fatgraphs is called - robust for an integer , if whenever is a sequence of fatgraphs , and is obtained from by one of four basic modifications : i ) change the label of a bond between peptide units ( i.e. , remove a twist or introduce a twist ) ; ii ) change the label of a hydrogen bond ; iii ) add or remove an untwisted hydrogen bond ; and iv ) insert a fatgraph building block next to an existing building block ( in the direction from n to c termini ) , such that the alpha carbon linkage between the two blocks is untwisted , the alpha carbon linkage to the right of is ( un ) twisted according to whether the linkage to the right of in the original fatgraph is ( un ) twisted , and has no hydrogen bonds attached. or the reverse operation , i.e. removing a block with no hydrogen bonds which has an untwisted linkage to its left neighbour ( illustrated in fig. 4 ) .
it can be shown [ 21 ] that the functions , , , and all are - robust .
this implies that if is changed by a sequence of at most basic modifications , the functions , , and change at most . 4. concoord modified structures all modified structures were generated using the concoord algorithm [ 26 ] which generates conformations from a known structure based on restrictions on interatomic distances .
we used default parameter values .
5. cath domain data the newest version of cath ( 3.3.0 ) contains domains whereas the previous version ( 3.2.0 ) only comprises domains .
we obtained the classifications of domains in both versions as well as the raw data consisting of chopped pdb - files and corresponding dssp - files from the cath homepage ( www.cathdb.info ) .
cath is hierarchical ; we focus on the class ( c ) , architecture ( a ) , topology ( t ) and homologous superfamily ( h ) , and sequence ( s ) level .
we operate with the following basic data sets : a ) cath 3.2.0 , b ) the domains in v3.3.0 , but not in v3.2.0 ( called new in v3.3.0 ) , and c ) cath 3.3.0 .
in addition , cath lists domains that have not yet received cath classification , either because the domain annotation is questionable or because there is uncertainty about the structural similarity to other domains .
we denote this set unclassified in v3.3.0 .
among the new in v3.3.0 , there are domains with novel h - level , that is , levels that are not already in v3.2.0 , but added to v3.3.0 .
using cath terminology , the full data sets are denoted by sall , whereas data sets only including sequences with less than 95 % similarity are denoted by s95 ( this does not apply to the unclassified set ) .
there are h - level families in v3.3.0 , and of these are singletons .
almost half of the families contain less than ten domains whereas a handful of families contain more than domains ( the largest contains domains ) .
moreover , the distributions of family sizes are highly skewed and resemble power - laws ( fig. s10 ) .
6. classification using robust variables the algorithm random forests [ 27 ] is used for classification .
it is a probabilistic approach , that is , rerunning the algorithm might produce a ( slightly ) different result .
a random forest builds ( user specified ) classification trees based on a training set ( where we always take the training set to be of the full data set ) and uses majority voting for predicting the classes of the testing set .
classification by random guessing is done by assigning family levels to domains according to family sizes , that is , the average success rate is the sum over , where is the frequency of family . 7. classification using flip sequences , amino acid sequences and gauss integrals for flip sequences , alignments were made using the smith - waterman algorithm with mismatch and gap penalties set to and match score to . for amino acid sequences , blosum40 was used .
let denote the score of the alignment of sequences and . to facilitate a pairwise comparison of all sequences in cath , regardless of lengths , we use the normalized score given by , such that all scores are between and . for a given a domain , denote by and the normalized alignment scores of the domain to the nearest and second nearest h - levels in the v3.3.0 training set .
a univariate measure was used to compare methods , , where and the mean and sd are over all domains in the training set .
for gauss integrals , we used with , and () the distance to the ( second ) nearest h - levels [ 11 ]. fig. s11 shows the distributions of the - values for the three methods .
domains were classified according to their nearest h - level .
a decision threshold was calibrated to achieve 95 % sensitivity ; all domains with above the threshold are flagged as correctly identified if the nearest h - level corresponds to the true level .
all domains with below the threshold are likewise correctly identifed as problematic if the nearest h - level is not the true level .
same procedure for c , a , and t - levels .
the three methods were combined into one method .
domains were classified according to the majority rule .
if none of the methods agree , the method with the highest - score decides the classification .
a combined - score was calculated as the maximum - score of the agreeing methods .
if all disagree , then the maximum - score is used. fig. s10 shows the distribution of the combined - score .
supporting information figure s1 each domain in the pectate lyase c - like topology was subjected to independent modifications using the concoord algorithm .
in the figure each column is a domain and the distribution of the normalized number of hydrogen in the modified structures is shown .
the number is normalized relatively to the number observed in the original ( unmodified ) domain .
the values corresponding to the eight outliers in fig. 6 are highlighted in red , and all show a conspicuous decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds in the modified structures compared to the general trend of the remaining domains .

figure s4 pairwise scatter plots of the five variables : the genus , the number of boundary components , the number of twisted alpha carbon linkages , the number of residues and the euler characteristic for all domains in v3.3.0 .
the variables and are positive or zero , and are strictly positive , and the euler characteristic is at most . further , the relationship provides bounds , e.g. .
the plots indicate that the variables are capable of distinguishing cath at the class ( c ) level .

colors indicate the number of variables ( , , , ) separating a pair of families at the given significance level : 0 ( black ) , 1 ( red ) , 2 ( yellow ) , 3 ( green ) , and 4 ( white ) .

separation of the mainly alpha and mainly beta classes with the mixed alpha - beta class falling somewhere between is observed .
the higher genera observed in the mainly beta and mixed alpha - beta classes are mainly caused by beta sheets .
separation between classes is harder to spot on the plots with beta sheet counts .

figure s8 standard deviations of the genus and the number of boundary components for each h - level in v3.3.0 ( sall ) .
the standard deviations are generally not increasing with increasing h - level size , indicating that even large families are homogeneous .

table s1 comparison of all three classifiers on the non - redundant s95 subset of cath ( first three tables ) as well as the entire cath ( sall , last three tables ) .
at each level ( c , a , t , and h ) we split cath v3.2.0 into two sets : for a level with n members , we used domains for training and the remaining n i ?( 1 / 2 ) domains for testing .
note that for and , no domains are used for training .
therefore , in the cath v3.2.0 test set as well as in the set of new domains in cath v3.3.0 , some domains do not have a classification present in the training set ( despite the fact that the classification does exist in cath v3.2.0 ) .
we call such domains unknown .
all classifiers were trained to provide a sensitivity on the training sets .
for each set ( s95 and sall ) , the three tables show the following : top : performance , sensitivity , specificity , and unknown domains flagged as novel / problematic ( in percent and in that order ) on the cath v3.2.0 training set .
middle : similarly on the set of new domains in cath v3.3.0 with classifications existing in cath v3.2.0 .
bottom : some domains in cath v3.3.0 have novel classifications not existing in cath v3.2.0 .
this table summarized how many of these are flagged as novel / problematic by the three classifiers .
finally , the percentage of unclassified domains flagged by each method is shown .
note that there is only one set of unclassified domains , and this is used in both the s95 and the sall case .

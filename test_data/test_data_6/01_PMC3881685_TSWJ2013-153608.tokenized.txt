age - related decrease in bone marrow erythropoietic capacity is often accompanied by the telomere length shortening in peripheral white blood cells .
however , limited and conflicting data hamper the conclusive opinion regarding this relationship .
therefore , the aim of this study was to assess an association between telomere length and peripheral blood cell count parameters in the polish elderly population .
material and methods .
the substudy included 1573 of 4981 subjects aged 65 years or over , participants of the population - based polsenior study .
high - molecular - weight dna was isolated from blood mononuclear cells .
telomere length ( tl ) was measured by qrt - pcr as abundance of telomere template versus a single gene copy encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p0. results .
only white blood count ( wbc ) was significantly different in tl tertile subgroups in all subjects ( p = 0.02 ) and in men ( p = 0.01 ) , but not in women .
merely in men significant but weak positive correlations were found between tl and wbc ( r = 0.11 , p < 0.05 ) and rbc ( r = 0.08 , p < 0.05 ) .
the multiple regression analysis models confirmed a weak , independent contribution of tl to both rbc and wbc. conclusions .
in the elderly , telomere shortening limits hematopoiesis capacity to a very limited extent .
1. introduction the process of bone marrow senescence involves gradual replacement of hematopoietic tissue by adipocytes and fibroblasts [ 1 ] .
this process is particularly evident in people aged over 80 years , when the hematopoietic tissue mass is reduced by half compared with young adults [ 2 ] .
bone marrow senescence results in the decreased number of erythroblasts , which is partially related to the age - associated reduction of erythropoietin ( epo ) production by the kidneys and to the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the elderly [ 3 , 4 ] .
epo prevents apoptosis of red cell progenitors and stimulates the synthesis of heme and hemoglobin as well as iron incorporation by erythroblasts .
important role in the aging of the hematopoietic system is attributed to low androgen levels both in men and in women , that occurs after menopause or andropause [ 5 ] .
in addition , frequent deficiencies of iron , vitamin b12 , folic acid , and of other cofactors of hematopoiesis in the elderly are attributed to poor diet regardless of coexisting comorbidities [ 6 ] .
bone marrow senescence is also related to the accumulation of dna damage in hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) [ 7 ] .
although it was suggested that telomerase activity in hscs should maintain a stable telomere length ( tl ) [ 8 ] , emerging evidence demonstrated that telomere shortening can limit the maintenance and function of the adult stem cells [ 9 ] .
probably , the telomerase activity in hscs is inadequate to prevent telomere erosion and , therefore , unable to avoid cell aging [ 10 - 12 ] .
however , wang et al. have recently shown that the telomerase activity varied in hscs from very weak to the levels comparable to these seen in the immortal cell lines , with no apparent age - dependent decline [ 13 ] .
wbc tl can be used as an approximate for hscs tl , therefore , most probably , it can be also used as an estimate for nucleated blood cells progenitors tl [ 14 , 15 ] .
the association between wbc tl and peripheral blood count parameters was studied among middle - aged [ 16 ] , mix middle - aged and elderly [ 17 ] , and elderly [ 18 ] populations .
the results of these studies are inconsistent .
de meyer et al. , who studied a large cohort ( n = 2508 ) of 35 - 55 years old population , found leukocyte tl to be predictive of red blood cell ( rbc ) count [ 16 ] .
this finding is in contrast to the finding reported by mollica et al. who did not observe any significant correlation in a large cohort ( n = 717 ) of women aged 38 - 100 years [ 17 ] .
den elzen et al. compared tl between participants aged 85 and over with and without anaemia ( n = 349 and n = 1058 , resp. ) showing no correlation between leukocyte tl and haemoglobin concentration and other haematological parameters [ 18 ] .
these published evidence is not decisive and the unsolved issue justifies further studies in that field .
we have decided to investigate the effect of tl on peripheral blood cell counts in a sample of population - based polsenior study [ 19 ] .
the aim of the study was to assess an association between telomere length and peripheral blood cell count parameters in the polish elderly population .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
study design and setting polsenior was a multicenter , interdisciplinary project , conducted in the years 2007 - 2011 , designed to assess health and socioeconomic status of the elderly population in poland .
the study design was described elsewhere [ 19 ] .
the study included comprehensive geriatric assessment based on standardized questionnaire and collection of blood samples .
2.2 .
material 4979 elderly subjects agreed to participate in a questionnaire survey ( 42.6 % of all eligible subjects ) .
peripheral blood analysis was performed in 4003 subjects .
first 1573 of approximately 4000 genomic dna isolated from blood mononuclear cells were included into the study .
characteristics of this group ( 31.6 % of the whole study population ) are shown in table 1 .
2.3 .
methods 2.3.1 .
dna isolation four ml blood samples were used for the isolation of the genomic dna by salting - out procedure [ 20 ] .
the concentration and purity of dna were assessed by uv spectroscopy ( nanodrop , thermo fisher scientific inc. , wilmington , de , usa ) .
2.3.2 .
telomere lengths ( tl ) assay wbc tl was measured using the real - time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method .
this method determines , for each dna sample , the factor by which it differs from a reference dna sample in its ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single copy gene copy number .
using two primer pairs that target telomeric hexamer repeats and a single copy gene ( 36b4 , which encodes acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p0 ) , the telomere repeat copy number ( t ) to single copy gene copy number ( s ) ratio was calculated for each dna sample .
the t / s ratio of each experimental dna sample was related to a reference dna sample ( obtained from a single individual and used for standard curve generation ) of which t / s ratio is 1 .
the forward and reverse primer sequences were for telomeres amplification : 5'cgg ttt gtt tgg gtt tgg gtt tgg gtt tgg gtt tgg gtt 3 ' ( 39 bp ) and : 5'ggc ttg cct tac cct tac cct tac cct tac cct tac cct 3 ' ( 39 bp ) , respectively [ 21 ] .
for the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p0 ( 36b4 ) , the forward and reverse primer sequences were 5'cag caa gtg gga agg tgt aat cc 3 ' ( 23 bp ) and 5'ccc att cta tcatca acg ggt aca a 3 ' ( 25 bp ) , respectively [ 22 ] .
for pcr amplification , reactions were incubated for 5 min at 95degreesc and then amplified over 45 cycles of 10 s at 95degreesc , 10 s at 55degreesc and 30 s at 72degreesc .
reactions were conducted in light cycler 480 ( roche , germany ) .
all samples were processed in triplicate .
telomere length was reflected by the relative telomere / single copy gene ratio ( t / s ) values : t / s = 2 - deltact ( deltact = cttelomere - ct36b4 ) .
the t / s ratio for each participant was measured in triplicates .
when the t / s values varied by more than 20 % , the sample was run for a second time , again in triplicates .
the result with lower standard error was chosen for further calculations .
the intraassay reproducibility was calculated as 10.4 % .
to asses interassay reproducibility the same control dna ( human genomic dna , roche , germany ) was used in each plate run .
the average standard deviations for a single - copy gene did not exceed 3.6 % .
2.3.3 .
laboratory measurements serum iron , uric acid , creatinine , and c - reactive protein ( by a high sensitivity method ) levels and peripheral blood cells levels were measured in the central laboratory of the polsenior study ( on modular ppe analyzer , roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) .
folic acid and vitamin b12 ( by ria method , diasource immunoassays , nivelles , belgium ) , 25 - oh - d3 ( by ria method , diasource immunoassays , nivelles , belgium ) , ferritin ( by eclia method for cobas e411 , roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) , and testosterone ( by ria method , siemens , los angeles , usa ) were assessed in laboratories of the department of nephrology endocrinology and metabolic diseases medical university of silesia in katowice and of the department of endocrinology , diabetology and isotope therapy medical university in wroclaw .
2.3.4 .
data analysis data analysis involved above - mentioned measurements and questionnaire - derived data on gender , age , body mass index ( bmi ) , and smoking status .
apart from gender and smoking status , all variables were analyzed as quantitative variables .
distribution of quantitative variables was shown by mean values and standard deviations .
because of abnormal distributions ( result of shapiro - wilk test ) , the between - group differences in quantitative variables distributions were examined by kruskal - wallis test .
effect of tl on peripheral blood cells levels was explored by the means of univariate and multivariate analyses .
univariate analyses involved the comparison of mean values between three classes of tl , defined by subsequent tertiles of the total and gender - specific distributions ( 0 - 33.3 % ; 33.4 - 66.6 % ; 66.7 - 100 %) .
moreover , spearman correlation coefficients and their p values were calculated to measure association between tl and peripheral blood cell levels .
in multivariate analyses the effect of tl on peripheral blood measurements was examined using linear logistic regression .
three separate models included rbc , wb , and plt as dependent variables .
in each model , the variable expressing tl was entered after logarithmic transformation to improve linearity of that variable .
in each model , the effect of tl on rbc , wb , and on plt was analyzed after adjustment for age , gender , vit .
b12 , folic acid , iron , crp , testosterone , and egfr levels .
the set of independent variables was examined for a potential effect of multicollinearity using analysis of correlation .
only variables that were involved in associations below r < 0.5 were entered in the model .
statistical analyses were performed using sas software version 9.1.3 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) and statistical inference was based on the criterion p < 0.05 , both for univariate and multivariate analyses .
3. results 3.1 .
characteristics of study population among 1573 participants with determined tl there were 810 men and 763 women .
this group was representative for the polsenior study population ( table 1 ) .
there was a small , but statistically significant difference in age between women with determined and notdetermined tl ( p < 0.001 ) .
no such differences were detected in the whole group and in men ( p > 0.05 ) .
two hundred seventeen study participants were permanently using nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , well known myelotoxic drugs .
3.2 .
tl effect on total blood cell count : results of univariate analyses tl was highly variable ( mean value +/ - sd 106.4 +/ - 110.8 , median 72.2 , and kurtosis 16.2 ) .
after logarithmic transformation , the mean value of logtl was 4.23 +/ - 0.96 ( median 4.26 and kurtosis - 0.04 ) .
a tendency for shorter logtl values was observed in men compared to women ( 4.19 +/ - 0.95 versus 4.28 +/ - 0.98 ; p = 0.06 ) .
there was no significant correlation between logtl and age .
data shown in table 2 suggest a trend towards higher counts of some blood cell types with increasing tl. however , statistically significant differences were found only in relation to wbc in all subjects ( p = 0.02 ) and in men ( p = 0.01 ) , but not in women ( p > 0.05 ) .
moreover , in women the highest counts of lymphocytes and monocytes were found in the second tertile category of tl ( p < 0.05 ) .
there were statistically significant , but weak correlations between tl and wbc ( r = 0.08 ) , rbc ( r = 0.06 ) , and plt ( r = 0.06 ) in all subjects .
these correlations were even stronger in men for rbc ( r = 0.08 ) and wbc ( r = 0.11 ) ( figure 1 ) .
the correlation with plt was almost statistically significant ( table 3 ) .
no correlation was found in women .
there was no correlation between circulating levels of vitamin b12 , folic acid , iron , ferritin , crp , il - 6 , and 25 - oh - d3 and tl in all study participants together and in each gender separately .
3.3 .
tl and total blood cell count : results of multivariate analyses the effect of tl on total blood cells counts ( rbc , wbc , and plt ) was examined by means of multivariable linear regression analysis .
the models included the following variables : age , gender , the levels of vitamin b12 , folic acid , iron , crp , testosterone , egfr , and tl. because of its skewed distribution , the last variable was entered in the model after logarithmic transformation .
in order to avoid the effect of multicollinearity , all independent variables were examined for between - variable associations .
the largest correlations were seen between age and egfr ( r = - 0.44 ) and between serum levels of iron and crp ( r = - 0.30 ) .
all remaining correlation coefficients did not exceed 0.1 .
based on the above results , all of the independent variables were retained in the complete model including 1264 observations .
results of multivariable analyses ( table 3 ) showed that , after multiple adjustment , both rbc and wbc were significantly related to the telomere length ( beta = 0.029 , p = 0.03 and beta = 0.154 , p = 0.01 , resp. ) .
however , tl did not explain the levels of plt in a statistically significant way ( p = 0.3 ) .
moreover , the results of multiple regression models demonstrated that age - related decrease of the rbc , wbc , and plt cannot be explained only by tl shortening , declining egfr , inflammation , decreasing testosterone level and systemic inflammation , iron and folic acid , and vitamin b12 deficiency ( table 4 ) .
4. discussion an association between tl and decreased bone marrow proliferation capacity in elderly is controversial .
simple analyses indicate impaired hematopoietic potential of hscs ; however , microelements and vitamins deficiency ( iron , vitamin b6 , b12 , and folic acid ) , systemic inflammation , and other factors have also impact on this process .
having this in mind , we have tested the association between tl and blood cell counts ( rbc , wbc , and platelets ) and other parameters ( hemoglobin and mcv ) .
our study confirmed that high variability of tl [ 23 ] weakens the significance of gender - specific differences in elderly .
because of this , we performed a separate analyses of tl tertiles of the total and gender - specific distributions .
only in men intertertile difference for wbc was demonstrated .
in univariate analyses , wbc and rbc were proportional to tl exclusively in men .
these relations were confirmed in multivariate regression analyses showing that tl is an independent explanatory variable for rbc and wbc counts in men but not in women .
previously , de meyer et al. showed such an association for rbc , but not for wbc , both in men and women of middle age [ 16 ] .
two other studies failed to prove significant correlation between tl and blood cell parameters [ 17 , 18 ] .
however , the study of mollica et al. included only women in wide range of age ( dispersion of age : 38 - 100 ) [ 17 ] , while the study of den elzen et al. analyzed the population of 85 + seniors which is more comparable to the polsenior study [ 18 ] .
they failed to prove the association between tl and hemoglobin concentration , hematocrit , mcv , rbc , plt , and wbc in these very old subjects .
most possibly , the weak association between tl and hematological parameters was blurred by other factors .
generally shorter tl in men may explain gender - specific differences in the degree of peripheral blood cell count .
though in comparison to women , it should be easier to detect correlations in men , supporting the reported associations in this population .
another possible explanation for the lack of association between tl and wbc count in women may be potential protective influence of hormones in their earlier life [ 24 ] .
the results of multiple regression models demonstrate that age - related decrease of rbc , wbc , and plt counts cannot be explained only by tl shortening , declining egfr , inflammation , decreasing testosterone level and systemic inflammation , and iron and vitamins deficiency .
therefore the existence of other not analysed age - associated factors should be taken into consideration , such as accumulation of dna damage that decreases proliferation potential of hscs .
defects in stem cell self - renewal and in the maintenance of proliferating tissues that have been associated with decreased expression of telomerase caused by gene mutations are clinically relevant approximately till the age of 40 [ 25 ] , whereas in the elderly external factors ( xenobiotics , toxins , inappropriate diet and unhealthy lifestyle , and infections ) and chronic inflammation have dominant impact on age - related nontelomeric dna damage , which is especially marked in tissues with high rates of cell turnover ( hscs , skin , and intestine epithelia ) .
these factors may alter the functional capacity of hscs in repair double - strand breaks , thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding dna damage accumulation [ 7 ] .
the results of our study suggest rather limited role of genetic background for age - related decrease of bone marrow proliferation capacity .
in mathematical models , telomere shortening explains hematopoietic bone marrow senescence only to a small extent .
moreover , telomere shortening does not explain the declining hemoglobin levels .
it was shown that decrease in epo response to low hemoglobin concentrations contributes to anemia development in the elderly [ 26 ] .
on the other hand , epo levels were reported to increase in healthy aging , at least in men [ 26 ] , suggesting the increasing resistance of erythroid progenitor cells to this stimulating factor .
in theory , increased epo levels , at least in patients suffering from deficient anemia , by promoting telomerase activity in erythroid progenitor cells , should support the relevance of tl maintenance .
however , den elzen et al. found no differences in median tls between participants with anemia and those without anemia [ 18 ] .
similarly , in our study no association between tl and hemoglobin level was found .
these results support the hypothesis that telomerase activity stimulated by epo is insufficient to avoid net telomere loss , probably resulting in replicative senescence .
it should be emphasized that the tl shortening translates to the decreased rbc count but not to the lower hemoglobin concentration or to the lower volume of erythrocytes ( mcv ) .
this observation suggests that tl attrition restricts proliferative bone marrow potential to a limited extent but does not impair hemoglobin synthesis in erythroblasts .
thus , the process of tl shortening most possibly does not result in the development of anemia , at least in elderly .
one of the limitations of our study was that we did not examine tl in hscs but in wbc and this was assumed to reflect bone marrow senescence status .
population - based study incorporating bone marrow biopsies , however , interesting from the scientific point of view , is not realistic [ 27 ] .
moreover , it has to be emphasized that several conditions such as oxidative stress or systemic microinflammation can influence telomere attrition in wbc .
however , we did not find any association between tl and the levels of circulating crp and il - 6 .
the parameters of oxidative stress were assessed only in some respondents , therefore we did not include them in the analysis .
additionally we did not examine the associations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase single nucleotide polymorphisms with tl which will be an issue for the further study of polsenior population .
a strength of our analysis is that we gathered data from a large population - based study of individuals aged 65 years and over , allowing us to generalize our results to the population of elderly people at large .
in conclusion , our study showed that tl shortening may be associated with decreased hematological parameters in older individuals ; however , tl contributes to such a decrease in a very limited extent .
nevertheless , this observation supports the hypothesis that shorter hscs telomeres might limit hematopoesis capacity .

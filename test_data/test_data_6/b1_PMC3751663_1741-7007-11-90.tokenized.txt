background most eukaryotic species represent stable karyotypes with a particular diploid number .
b chromosomes are additional to standard karyotypes and may vary in size , number and morphology even between cells of the same individual .
for many years it was generally believed that b chromosomes found in some plant , animal and fungi species lacked active genes .
recently , molecular cytogenetic studies showed the presence of additional copies of protein - coding genes on b chromosomes .
however , the transcriptional activity of these genes remained elusive .
we studied karyotypes of the siberian roe deer ( capreolus pygargus ) that possess up to 14 b chromosomes to investigate the presence and expression of genes on supernumerary chromosomes .
results here , we describe a 2 mbp region homologous to cattle chromosome 3 and containing tnni3k ( partial ) , fpgt , lrriq3 and a large gene - sparse segment on b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer .
the presence of the copy of the autosomal region was demonstrated by b - specific cdna analysis , pcr assisted mapping , cattle bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clone localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ). by comparative analysis of b - specific and non - b chromosomal sequences we discovered some b chromosome - specific mutations in protein - coding genes , which further enabled the detection of a fpgt - tnni3k transcript expressed from duplicated genes located on b chromosomes in roe deer fibroblasts .
conclusions discovery of a large autosomal segment in all b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer further corroborates the view of an autosomal origin for these elements .
detection of a b - derived transcript in fibroblasts implies that the protein coding sequences located on bs are not fully inactivated .
the origin , evolution and effect on host of b chromosomal genes seem to be similar to autosomal segmental duplications , which reinforces the view that supernumerary chromosomal elements might play an important role in genome evolution .
b chromosomes segmental duplications gene duplications karyotype evolution cervidae background b chromosomes are traditionally classified as a special class of eukaryotic chromosomes different from both autosomes and sex chromosomes [ 1 ] .
a characteristic trait of b chromosomes is their dispensability ; that is , there may be some individuals lacking them in the population [ 2 ] .
the number of b chromosomes may vary between cells , tissues , and individuals within a population , which is due to their irregular meiotic and mitotic behavior [ 3 ] .
b chromosomal meiotic drive has been detected in many plant and animal species ( reviewed in [ 2 ]) and it plays a key role in the maintaining of b chromosomes through generations .
the molecular mechanisms responsible for this drive remained unknown for a long period of time , but recently a non - disjunction of b chromatids accompanied by centromere activity was demonstrated in the male gametophyte of rye [ 4 ] .
although it is widely accepted that b chromosomes are highly heterogeneous and may have different properties in different organisms , until recently the concept of the totally heterochromatic and transcriptionally inert nature of b chromosomes has prevailed .
indeed , supernumerary chromosomes of various organisms often contain tandemly arranged [ 5 ] and dispersed [ 6 ] repetitive elements , interstitial telomeric sequences [ 7,8 ] , ribosomal dna clusters [ 9,10 ] , histone genes [ 11 ] and so on. the first protein - coding genes were found in b chromosomes of the fungus nectria haematococca [ 12 ] .
recently , a growing body of evidence has accumulated on the presence of coding genes [ 13 - 17 ] and even organellar genome sequences [ 17 ] on b chromosomes of different animal and plant species .
this has corroborated the idea of a complex mosaic structure of supernumerary chromosomes , representing autonomous blocks of segmental duplications and heterochromatin [ 18 ] .
transcription of ribosomal genes has been detected in some plants [ 19 ] and animals [ 10,20 ] .
however , no transcription of b - specific protein - coding genes has been detected in vertebrates so far .
the siberian roe deer ( capreolus pygargus ( cpy ) , 2n = 70 + 1 - 14 bs ) is a widely distributed cervid species inhabiting wide areas of asia from the volga river to the pacific coast .
the siberian roe deer is closely related to the european roe deer ( capreolus capreolus , 2n = 70 ) , but these two species do have some morphological and karyological differences and are well resolved in molecular phylogenies [ 21,22 ] .
the only derived karyotypic character of the siberian roe deer is the presence of b chromosomes [ 23 ] , the number of supernumerary elements usually varies both between individuals and between cells within the same individual albeit some individuals may possess a stable number of bs [ 24 ] .
recently , we have studied the standard karyotype of the siberian roe deer by comparative chromosome painting and found it to be highly conserved and similar to that of the cervid ancestor [ 25 ] .
although some authors proposed the classification of several subspecies of c. pygargus [ 26,27 ] , our studies of the mitochondrial dna control region in the populations of extant and ancient roe deer failed to reveal any subspecies structure [ 28 ] .
here , we report on three protein - coding genes that are located within the duplicated autosomal regions on the b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer ( capreolus pygargus ) and demonstrate the transcription of a b - specific protein - coding sequence in fibroblast culture .
results generation of siberian roe deer b chromosome - specific cdna library ( cbcl ) for chromosome - specific cdna selection we used a protocol based on the previously published selection of hybrids by affinity capture ( shac ) [ 29 ] technique with some modifications .
a biotinylated library derived from degenerate oligonucleotide - primed polymerase chain reaction ( dop - pcr ) amplification of flow - sorted b chromosomes was used as ' target dna ' .
we confirmed the b chromosomal origin of the biotinylated library by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) without cot5 suppression .
signals were detected on all eight b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer ( cpy _ d specimen , table 1 ) ( figure 1 ) .
in addition , the subcentromeric heterochromatic blocks on all autosomes ( but not on x chromosomes ) were painted , suggesting the presence of shared heterochromatic sequences on all autosomes and b chromosomes .
no signals on autosomal arms were detected .
the ' source ' cdna was synthesized from total rna isolated from the cpy _ d fibroblast culture ( passage 6 ) ; the cdnas of the ' source ' library were flanked by primers ( provided in the library construction kit ) .
we used an excess of cpy cot5 dna in hybridization experiments to reduce the presence of the repetitive dna in the final b - specific cdna library .
the quality of the cbcl ( in terms of chromosome specificity and depletion of the repetitive dna ) was confirmed by fish ( figure 2 ) .
noteworthy were the absence of signals on autosomal pericentric heterochromatic blocks and a high specificity of the resulting b - specific probe .

b - specific cdna cloning and sequencing to characterize the cbcl and estimate its content , we cloned the pcr products in plasmid vectors and sequenced 33 random clones .
the sequences were aligned against cattle genome assemblies ( ucsc genome browser on cow , october 2011 ( baylor btau _ 4.6.1 / bostau7 )) using the blat search genome alignment tool and the following results were obtained ( here we present only matches that had over 80 % similarity of 150 bp ) : eight clones showed similarity to dispersed repetitive elements ( mostly long interspersed nuclear elements ( lines ) from the l1 bt family ) ; three clones were homologous to genes from the mitochondrial genome. of the 22 clones that showed a high similarity to unique parts of the bovine genome ( bos taurus ( bta )) , 18 clones were mapped to a 1.8 - mbp region of bta3 ( 74.6 to 76.4 mbp according to ( ucsc genome browser on cow , october 2011 ( baylor btau _ 4.6.1 / bostau7 ))) ( table 2 , additional file 1 ) ( genbank : jn871269 to jn871285 ) .
the remaining four unique clones were homologous to regions on bta 2 , 7 , 10 and 28 ( data not shown ) .
the cdnas homologous to the bta3 region were not randomly distributed across the 1.8 mbp genomic segment ; 2 areas of high match density were observed : 74.6 to 74.9 mbp ( 7 matches ) and 76.0 to 76.4 mbp ( 11 matches ) , separated by a 1 mbp region lacking any matches ( figure 3 ) .

bta3 is the segment of cattle chromosome 3 from the btau _ 4.6.1 .
the mapping of b chromosomes with bovine bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clones to confirm the presence of a bta3 - homologous region on b chromosomes of c. pygargus we performed fish of bovine bac clones from the respective genomic segments .
based on the distribution of b chromosome - specific cdna clones we selected sequenced bovine bac clones from the chori - 240 library for fish mapping ( additional file 2 : table s1 ) .
fish was performed on the metaphase chromosomes of c. pygargus with four bs ( cpy _ b ) and with eight bs ( cpy _ d ) .
as a control we also mapped the same bac clones via fish on bovine metaphase chromosomes .
all bacs produced specific signals on the siberian roe deer chromosome 1 and bovine chromosome 3 .
these results are consistent with our data of cross - species chromosome painting that demonstrated complete homology of chromosomes bta3 and cpy1 [ 25 ] .
six bovine bac clones ( ch240 - 10h15 , ch240 - 444i8 , ch240 - 493p4 , ch240 - 515c3 , ch240 - 454d22 and ch240 - 351i13 ) produced strong signals on b chromosomes of c. pygargus , confirming the presence of the cpy1 fragment ( figure 4 ) .
bac clones ch240 - 131i21 and ch240 - 385g2 did not give any specific signal on b chromosomes , presumably due to the absence of the respective genomic loci on these elements , although this does not exclude the presence of a short flanking fragment from these bacs .
figure 4 localization of bovine bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) ch240 - 10h15 on the chromosomes of the siberian roe deer ( capreolus pygargus ( cpy )) with eight b chromosomes ( cpy _ d ) .
arrows indicate signals on cpy1 and b chromosomes .
some bac clones produced signals of varying intensity on different b chromosomes suggesting molecular heterogeneity among supernumerary elements , for example , the bac clone ch240 - 444i8 gave more intensive signals on six out of eight b chromosomes in the cpy _ d , whereas all four b chromosomes were painted in equal intensity in the cpy _ b .
ch240 - 454d22 gave signals of different intensities on b chromosomes of cpy _ b : two out of four b chromosomes consistently showed signals of two to three times stronger intensity than the remaining ones .
this could reflect a different degree of regional amplification .
the localization of bac clones further confirmed the results of cdna mapping .
assuming that the cdnas and bacs demonstrate the presence of a continuous segment homologous to bta3 , full copies and parts of some genes must be present in the proximal part of this segment ( tnni3k , lrriq3 , fpgt , non - protein coding fgd5 - as1 , and a pseudogene rnps1 ) , while the distal part of the segment seems to be gene sparse ( it contains only a pseudogene of arpc2 ) and represents a large gene desert ( figure 3 ) .
the mapping of b chromosomes by pcr to refine the boundaries of the amplified regions on b chromosomes we used pcr - assisted mapping on the flow - sorted b chromosome library .
we designed 40 primer pairs from bta3 based on conserved regions of the bovine genome ( ucsc genome browser on cow , october 2011 ( baylor btau _ 4.6.1 / bostau7 )) , taking into account the distribution of b chromosome - specific cdnas and bac mapping results ( figure 3 ) .
the pcr was carried out using the dop - pcr library , derived from flow - sorted b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer , as template .
parallel amplification was conducted with bovine and total roe deer genomic dnas .
the pcr products of appropriate size resulting from the b chromosome - specific library , and genomic dna of both cattle and siberian roe deer indicated the presence of these fragments on supernumerary chromosomes of c. pygargus .
the absence of several closely located products in the b chromosome - specific library indicated deletions or segment boundaries .
we confirmed the specificity of several pcr products by direct sequencing .
this method allowed us to define precisely the boundaries of the b chromosome - specific segmental duplication .
the pcr - assisted mapping extended the size of the segment on supernumerary chromosomes to approximately 2 mbp in total , with some possible deletions in the central part of the region ( alternatively , these might be due to incomplete coverage of b - specific libraries ) .
to determine the upstream boundary of the segment we used five primer pairs .
this boundary was found to be located between positions 74,538 kbp and 74,600 kbp .
using three primer pairs we mapped the downstream boundary of the segment to the interval between 76,468 kbp and 76,502 kbp .
although the homology of the roe deer b chromosomes to each other has been demonstrated by reverse painting of probes derived from single - copy microdissection experiments ( data not shown ) and was implicated by the data on bac localization , we did not have any evidence on the general structural homogeneity of b chromosomes .
the estimation of copy number variations of the regions localized on the b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer to estimate the copy numbers of amplified b genes we applied qualitative pcr ( qpcr ) using conserved parts including the sequence of the fourth exon from fpgt and lrriq3 and a promoter region of tnni3k ( additional file 3 : figure s1 ) .
as a single copy reference we used a conserved segment of ptgfr gene located on bovine chromosome 3 outside the region amplified on b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer ( approximately 4.6 mbp downstream ) .
to achieve equal efficiency of amplification in both cattle and siberian roe deer we designed primers based on identical short sequences in both species .
the short sequences in the siberian roe deer were obtained by targeted sequencing .
we characterized the copy number of regions present on b chromosomes ( bs ) in siberian roe deer without b chromosomes ( cpy _ a ) , siberian roe deer with four bs ( cpy _ b ) and siberian roe deer with eight bs ( cpy _ d ) ( figure 5 ) .
the qpcr results showed that the regions of tnni3k and lrriq3 genes are present in two copies per diploid genome in cpy _ a ( similar to ptgfr ) whereas the region of fpgt gene is present in four copies per diploid genome in the same animal .
this indicates a duplication of the region containing fpgt gene in cpy _ a , although no extra chromosomes were found in the specimen .
figure 5 gene dose ratio ( gdr ) of fpgt , lrriq3 and tnni3k genes in siberian roe deer with zero , four and eight b chromosomes .
the gdr values are relative to the number of respective gene copies per haploid genome in each sample ( cattle dna was used as reference ) .
error bars represent the standard deviation .
we found that the regions of fpgt and lrriq3 genes are present in six copies per diploid genome in cpy _ b ( four bs ) , suggesting a direct correlation between the number of extra copies of the gene fragment and the number of b chromosomes .
we showed that the region of tnni3k gene is present in four copies per diploid genome in cpy _ b , suggesting that the copies of tnni3k gene segment are localized only on two out of four b chromosomes .
we found the region of the tnni3k gene is present in ten copies per diploid genome in the specimen cpy _ d ( eight bs ) ( suggesting each of b chromosomes carries a single copy of this segment ) .
the regions of fpgt and lrriq3 genes were found to be represented by eight copies per diploid genome in cpy _ d ( suggesting that at least two bs lack the segment ) .
generally these findings correlate well with the results of cattle bac clone localization and demonstrate that not all b chromosomes contain full copies of the proposed amplified fragment .
although the number of segment copies depends on the number of b chromosomes , this correlation is not necessarily direct , as some b chromosomes may lack the full fragment .
our results demonstrate some variation in the composition of b chromosomes despite overall similarity and general homology .
dna sequence comparison of non - b chromosomal and b chromosome - specific fragments we used targeted sequencing to compare some homologous regions from b chromosomes and non - b chromosomes .
we sequenced several regions ( from 84 bp to 1,443 bp ) , comprising the promoter region of the tnni3k gene ( genbank : jn871289 to jn871291 ) , the first three exons of fpgt ( additional file 1 ) and the second exon of lrriq3 gene ( genbank : jn871294 , jn871295 ) in the library of flow - sorted b chromosomes as well as in the total genomic dna of the european roe deer and several specimens of the siberian roe deer ( cpy _ a - cpy _ d ) ( genbank : jn871289 to jn871291 , jn871294 , jn871295 ) .
in addition , we sequenced the fourth exon of fpgt gene ( genbank : jn871287 , jn871288 ) and the first exon of tnni3k gene ( additional file 1 ) in the european roe deer and cpy _ d .
we found nucleotide substitutions specific to b chromosomes in two cases .
the b chromosomal second exon of lrriq3 gene carries a transition ( g > a ) ( valine141 to isoleucine141 ) ; the comparison was based on both the roe deer without b chromosomes and cattle , in the dop - library of b chromosomes ( genbank : jn871295 ) , in b chromosome - specific cdna and in a fragment from total cdna derived from cpy _ d ( obtained sequences were identical to genbank : jn871295 ) .
the b chromosomal second exon of fpgt carries a transition a > g ( lysine83 to arginine83 ) ( additional file 1 ) .
the same b - specific mutation was found in the second exon of fpgt in a cdna clone ( described below ) .
it is intriguing that the first triplet of fpgt encodes for valine both in b chromosomes and in the genomic dna of the siberian roe deer with four and eight b chromosomes ( cpy _ b , cpy _ d ) ( due to the use of total genomic dna as template we could not reveal the underrepresented adenosines ) .
a heterozygous condition ( valine / methionine ) was revealed in the genomes of two individuals of the european roe deer , while we found only methionine in the fpgt first position in the siberian roe deer without b chromosomes ( specimen cpy _ a ) ( additional file 1 ) .
additional experiments are needed to test if this a1 > g1 transition might be characteristic for a pseudogene in the european roe deer , while the valine triplet ( gtg ) is associated with the segmental duplication of fpgt located on b chromosomes , since the gtg is known to be a less effective starting codon and may result in the loss of expression or n - terminally truncated proteins [ 30,31 ] .
however , it is possible that an alternative upstream exon with a conserved atg codon may be used .
interestingly the same a / g single nucleotide variation at the first position has been described in human fpgt [ 32 ] .
evidence of fpgt transcription from b chromosomes the finding of a b chromosome - specific mutation ( a > g in the second exon of fpgt ) in the processed fpgt - tnni3k cdna ( genbank : jn871272 ) prompted us to study this case in detail .
first , we sequenced the second exon of fpgt in cpy _ a ( without bs ) , in red deer ( cervus elaphus ) , gray brocket deer ( mazama gouazoubira ) , and eurasian elk ( alces alces ) , and found the ' wild type a ' condition to be conserved ( sequencing of b - specific dop - pcr library , genomic dna of cpy _ d - specific and b - specific cdna revealed the derived ' g ' condition ) .
comparison with many other sequenced vertebrates including opossum , platypus , rooster and anole lizard further corroborated the high conservation of the position in various phylogenetic lineages .
to exclude the possibility that the mutation occurred on the autosomal copies of cpy with b chromosomes , we conducted comparative sequencing of autosomal and b chromosomal segments from the same animal .
to achieve this , we microdissected separately chromosomes cpy1 and bs ( from the specimens cpy _ d and cpy _ c ) in separate tubes and sequenced the region of interest .
four sequences derived from non - b chromosomes gave ' a wild - type a ' condition , while three b chromosomal sequences gave ' a derived g ' condition .
to exclude a possible polymorphism among b chromosomes we sequenced ten fpgt exon 2 carrying clones derived from two different flow sorting fractions .
all these clones carried the ' g ' mutation .
based on our discovery of a processed transcript carrying the derived state ( in cpy _ d ) we concluded that this region is transcribed not from autosomes but from b chromosomes .
discussion siberian roe deer belong to the cetartiodactyl family cervidae , where b chromosomes have also been described in five mazama species [ 33 ] .
it is interesting that both capreolus and mazama genera likely possess identical standard karyotypes ( 2n = 70 + bs ) and have gc - rich small b chromosomes , which may suggest a common ancestry of supernumerary elements .
however , our studies on the brown brocket deer ( mazama gouazoubira ) did not reveal any homologous unique segments between b chromosomes of these species ( unpublished data ) , suggesting a fairly recent and independent origin of bs in capreolus and mazama .
however , there could be a particular predisposition in the genome organization that underlies the higher frequency of b chromosomes appearance in capreolinae .
concerning the general polymorphism of b chromosomes , we should emphasize that a siberian roe deer specimen carrying no b chromosomes ( cpy _ a ) was described here for the first time .
the finding of this animal was quite unexpected , considering the many previous karyotyping studies of siberian roe deer , describing from 1 to 14 copies of b chromosomes per diploid genome [ 23,24,34,35 ] .
the presence of an animal lacking bs raised the question of whether this could be a misidentified c. capreolus individual .
the analysis of the mitochondrial dna control region allowed us to unambiguously describe the species as c. pygargus ( the haplotype ns99 is identical to the ancient haplotype dc6 ([ 28 ] , genbank : gu811828 ) .
this finding indicates that the amount of b chromosomes in the siberian roe deer is highly variable between individuals ( 0 to 14 ) and that the presence of b chromosomes is not essential for animal physiology and cannot be used as a species discriminating character .
it is of interest that some animals were reported as lacking the intraindividual mosaicism of bs [ 24 ] .
in this study , we have chosen animals with stable karyotypes from altai .
the same method of cdna - selection - based mapping of b chromosomes described here has also been applied to the red fox ( vulpes vulpes ) .
in this species we mapped cdnas to seven different autosomal regions , and these results were further confirmed by subsequent canine bac mapping [ 36 ] .
it seems that the roe deer b chromosomes contain a large segment from a single genomic locus , while canid b chromosomes have a complex structure comprising segments from multiple regions .
b chromosomes of the red fox and the raccoon dog share some segments ( homologous to canine chromosome 13 ) while most other segmental duplications ( five in the red fox and three in the chinese raccoon dog ) are species specific .
it is worth mentioning that the fragment identified on siberian roe deer b chromosomes is located near the evolutionary breakpoint on cattle chromosome 3 and contains a large gene desert conserved in both human and cattle .
moreover , we found several large segmental duplications in the cattle genomic region .
this might have led to a general genomic instability of the locus and its involvement in b chromosome formation .
the finding of coding genes on b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer further emphasizes the importance of studying regions previously believed to be non - coding .
representing a variation in number of coding and non - coding sequences these elements may influence many aspects of genome activity .
finding a significant amount of segmental duplications in many vertebrate species suggests that b chromosomes act as autonomously segregating karyotypic elements , carrying some genomic regions that could potentially influence overall genome plasticity and contribute to novel adaptations .
the genes that were identified on the siberian roe deer b chromosomes , tnni3k ( partial ) , fpgt and lrriq3 , may be expressing and influencing metabolism of the cells .
partial sequencing of these genes on b chromosomes and in the siberian roe deer without any bs has demonstrated a high sequence conservation and very low number of b - specific substitutions , which might reflect a relatively recent origin of b chromosomes in the siberian roe deer from a large segment derived from cpy1 .
the b - specific transcript ( genbank : jn871272 ) described here represents an alternatively spliced variant , consisting of two exons of fpgt ( the first and the second ) and a large part of the second exon of tnni3k .
multiple transcripts composed of different exons due to alternative splicing of fpgt - tnni3k readthrough transcript have been described in human [ 37 ] .
however , the combination of exons in the roe deer transcript is different from previously published .
tnni3k seems to be very important in cardiomyogenesis , since its expression promotes the differentiation of cardiomyocytes and enhances cardiac performance [ 38,39 ] , while fpgt ( the full copy of the gene is present on roe deer bs ) participates in reutilization of l - fucose arising from cellular metabolism of glycoproteins and glycolipids [ 40 ] .
the locus including both tnni3k and fpgt genes was found to be responsible for susceptibility to viral myocarditis in mice [ 41 ] .
transcription of truncated copies might generally affect the expression of autosomal copies , but more detailed research is needed here .
however , these genes maybe partly or completely epigenetically inactivated .
thus , the finding of the b - derived transcript corroborates the hypothesis of transcriptional activity of segmental duplications .
further studies will determine if transcription of b chromosomal copies of the gene lrriq3 also takes place .
at least we found a putative b chromosome - specific mutation that might be used as a marker of b - derived transcripts , but have not yet excluded a possible case of autosomal heterozygosity of this mutation .
it should be emphasized that the transcription of the b chromosomal gene was demonstrated only in fibroblasts and additional experiments are required to test the expression of this gene in other cells and tissues of the organism .
it is also possible that cultured fibroblasts might manifest different properties and have different activity of some genes .
conclusions application of novel molecular technologies has allowed the localization of unique sequences , comprising protein - coding genes , on b chromosomes of several vertebrate species [ 13,14,16,36 ] .
use of high - throughput sequencing methods to obtain a large amount of information about the structure of whole genomes looks very promising for studying species with supernumerary chromosomes .
however , our study shows that it should be supplemented by individual chromosome copy isolation and analysis to differentiate the non - b chromosomal and b - specific components .
new data on supernumerary elements of the genome clearly indicate that the role of b chromosomes in evolution and their influence on the host are largely underestimated .
considering that mammalian b chromosomes carrying additional copies of expressed genes do not have any pronounced adverse effect ( at least none described so far ) , their use for the future development of artificial mammalian chromosomes seems promising : our studies demonstrate that they can be isolated easily from the rest of the genome by chromosome sorting , and studies of other authors show that flow - sorted chromosomes can be inserted into oocytes [ 42 ] .
employing newly developed methods of zinc finger nuclease technology [ 43 ] it would be of interest to use animals carrying b chromosomes as models for transgenic studies .
methods ethics statement and sample collection all siberian roe deer , european roe deer ( leningrad oblast ) , eurasian elk and red deer tissue samples were provided by local hunters ; animals were not killed for the purpose of this study .
fibroblast tissue cultures of european roe deer ( uk ) , cattle and brown brocket were taken for dna isolation from the collection of the comparative genomics group ( cambridge ) .
table 1 lists the number of specimens and their characteristics .
cell culture and chromosome preparation fibroblast cell lines were established from the ear cartilage tissue of siberian roe deer individuals with different numbers of b chromosomes as described previously [ 44 ] .
the cell lines were cultured at 37degreesc in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) and alphamem ( gibco , invitrogen , paisley , uk ) enriched with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( gibco ) , penicillin ( 100 units / ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 mug / ml ) or kanamycin ( 100 mug / ml ) .
before harvest , the cells were treated with 1 mug / ml of ethidium bromide ( final concentration ) for 2 h and treated with 0.05 mg / ml colchicine ( final concentration ) for 45 minutes .
preparation of metaphase chromosomes was made according to standard procedures that included a 45 - minute hypotonic treatment in 0.56 % kcl , fixation in 3:1 methanol / glacial acetic acid , followed by slide preparation and air drying .
the number of b chromosomes was analyzed in all c. pygargus samples ( at least 50 cells per sample ) and we detected no variation in the number of b chromosomes between cells .
flow sorting b chromosomes of the siberian roe deer ( cpy _ d ) have been flow sorted on a facstar plus , becton dickinson , usa , as described previously [ 45,46 ] .
the peak containing b chromosomes was very well resolved and distinct from non - b chromosomal peaks ( additional file 4 : figure s2 ) .
we collected b chromosomes into 4 tubes containing 20 mul of water ( 1,000 chromosomes per tube ) .
generation of b chromosome - specific libraries chromosome - specific libraries were made by dop - pcr amplification of flow - sorted chromosomes [ 47 ] .
dop - pcr - amplified chromosome - specific dna was labeled during the secondary pcr by incorporating biotin - 16 - dutp ( roche , switzerland ) or cy3 - dutp ( ge healthcare , uk ) [ 48 ] .
chromosome specificity of the library was confirmed by fish ( figure 1 ) .
selection of b chromosome - specific cdnas total rna was isolated from several millions of fibroblasts from the sixth passage of the siberian roe deer primary culture ( cpy _ d ) using the masterpure rna purification kit ( epicentre , uk ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
a double stranded total cdna library was constructed using the bd smart ( tm ) pcr cdna synthesis kit ( bd biosciences ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
two rounds of b chromosome - specific cdna selection were conducted using a method based on previously published selection of hybrids by affinity capture ( shac ) [ 29 ] .
briefly , 50 mul of cdna pcr library ( driver ) and 1 mul of biotin - labeled b chromosome - specific library mixed with 5 mug of c. pygargus cot5 dna ( tracer ) were denatured for 3 minutes at 95degreesc .
after denaturing the products were adjusted with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) ( up to 0.1 %) and saline - sodium citrate ( ssc ) ( up to 1 x ) and prehybridized separately at 65degreesc for 30 minutes to suppress the repetitive elements .
both solutions were mixed together and hybridized overnight at 65degreesc .
the resulting dna duplexes were captured by streptavidin - coated magnetic beads , dynabeads ( r ) m - 280 streptavidin ( invitrogen , uk ) for 20 minutes at 65degreesc .
magnetic beads were washed twice in 2 x ssc , 0.1 % sds for 5 minutes at 65degreesc , five times in 0.2 x ssc , 0.1 % sds for 5 minutes at 65degreesc and once in 0.2 x ssc at 30degreesc .
the cdnas were released by denaturing the beads in tris - ethylenediaminetetra - acetic acid ( te ) buffer for 5 minutes at 95degreesc .
selected cdnas were amplified by pcr with specific primer ( provided by bd bioscience ) .
cdnas , after the first round of selection were subjected to the second round , to increase the chromosome specificity .
the quality of the final cbcls was controlled by fish ( figure 2 ) .
cloning of cdna fragments the b - specific cdna library was cloned using topo ( r ) ta cloning ( r ) kit ( invitrogen , uk ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
in all , 50 single colonies were cultured for plasmid dna isolation ; 33 clones with bd primer flanked inserts were selected for sequencing .
fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization were labeled either by direct incorporation of labeled dutp in pcr ( with dop or bd primers ) or using a nick translation kit ( invitrogen , uk ) following the manufacturer 's instructions ( for bovine bacs ) .
fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using a standard protocol [ 49,50 ] .
microscopy images were captured and processed using the cytovision genus system ( applied imaging , usa ) and a cohu ccd camera mounted on an olympus bx - 60 microscope , or using videotest 2.0 image analysis system ( saint petersburg , russia ) and a baumer optronics ccd camera mounted on axioscope 2 plus microscope ( carl zeiss , germany ) .
isolation of dna from bovine bac clones dna was isolated from bovine bac clones ( additional file 2 : table s1 ) of the genomic bac library chori - 240 using the qiagen large - construct kit ( qiagen , uk ) .
isolation of dna from animal tissues and cell cultures dna was isolated from all samples listed in table 1 using dneasy blood & tissue kit ( qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
pcr - assisted mapping of the flow - sorted cpy b chromosome - specific library pcr - assisted mapping was conducted using primers designed from cattle chromosome 3 region ( ucsc genome browser on cow , october 2011 ( baylor btau _ 4.6.1 / bostau7 )) listed in additional file 5 : table s2 .
a total of 20 ng dna of the siberian roe deer with b chromosomes ( cpy _ d ) , flow sorting - derived cpy b chromosome - specific library and cattle genomic dna were used as templates .
the pcr program included : 94degreesc for 2 minutes ; 30 cycles of 94degreesc ( 15 s ) , xdegreesc ( 30 s ) , 72degreesc ( 30 s ) ; and a final extension at 72degreesc for 5 minutes , where x corresponds to the respective annealing temperature for each pair of primers .
pcr products were analyzed on a 1.5 % agarose gel .
qpcr the fragment of the ptgfr gene amplified using the nbf and nbr primers ( additional file 6 : table s3 ) on cattle genomic dna was used as a reference fragment for the real time pcr calibration .
the primer sequences were designed from the genomic regions conserved between cattle and the siberian roe deer .
real time pcr was performed using standard curve methods [ 51 ] using a c1000 thermal cycler ( biorad ) .
c1000 manager software was utilized for the analysis of the results .
the copy number of regions was estimated in the genomes of cattle and siberian roe deer with different numbers of b chromosomes .
each primer pair was tested by non - template pcr to check the primer - dimer formation in the reactions .
a final dissociation step was always performed at the end of each pcr to identify the unique and specific amplification of the target sequence .
additional file 6 : table s3 lists the primers used for real time pcr in the present study .
the amplification reactions were run three times .
reactions contained 10 mul of dna ( 0.2 mug ) , 5 mul of primers mix ( final primer concentration of 1 mm each ) , and 10 mul of power sybr green pcr master mix ( sintol , moscow , russia ) , in a final volume of 25 mul .
amplifications were carried out in a thermal cycler c1000 ( biorad ) .
the reactions started with an initial step at 95degreesc for 5 minutes .
the reaction proceeded with 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 15 s , 60degreesc for 20 s and 72degreesc for 30 s. a final dissociation step was always performed to control the amplicons melting curves .
sequencing b - specific cdna clones were sequenced with standard m13 primers using dtcs quick start master mix and ceq 2000 sequencer ( beckman - coulter ) in the department of veterinary medicine ( cambridge , uk ) .
pcr products for sequence analysis of fpgt , tnni3k and lrriq3 genes were generated using primers based on cattle chromosome 3 region ( ucsc genome browser on cow , october 2011 ( baylor btau _ 4.6.1 / bostau7 )) ( listed in additional file 7 : table s4 ) .
for comparative analysis of non - b chromosomal and b chromosome - specific copies we amplified the segments from b chromosome - specific libraries , dna of individuals lacking bs and microdissected autosomes .
sequencing was carried out in the interinstitutional center of dna sequencing at the siberian branch of russian academy of sciences ( novosibirsk , russia ) using an abi3130x1 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems inc. , ca , usa ) with abi big dye kit according to a standard protocol .
sequence analysis was accomplished using sequence scanner v1.0 software ( applied biosystems ) , blast and blat alignment tools [ 52,53 ] .
microdissection we microdissected several copies of the largest autosome ( cpy1 ) and b chromosomes as described earlier [ 54 ] with some modifications : after incubation in the collection drop with proteinase k and sds , the sample was transferred to water , denatured and adjusted with all reagents necessary for pcr with t2 primers ( additional file 5 : table s2 ) .
in all , 40 cycles were performed ( controlled with samples containing other autosomes and total genomic dna ) revealing fragments of interest .
the fragments were directly sequenced after exosap treatment .

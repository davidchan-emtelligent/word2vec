a mesenteric cyst is a rare cause for abdominal pain .
this umbrella term includes cystic entities which reside in the mesentery .
we present a case of an infected false mesenteric cyst in a 24 - year - old female patient without prior surgery or known trauma .
mainstay of treatment involves surgical resection , although less invasive treatments have been described .
prognosis depends on the origin of the cyst .
1. introduction the mesenteric cyst is a rare entity .
it has been reported as an umbrella term that comprises any cystic mass which manifests within the mesentery , including lymphangioma , benign and malignant cystic lymphangioma , enteric duplication cyst , dermoid cyst , and pseudocyst [ 1 ] .
mesenteric cysts are often asymptomatic ; however , if infected or ruptured patients may present with acute abdominal pain .
this lack of specific symptoms and moreover its rare occurrence make diagnosis and consequently clinical decision challenging .
ultrasound ( us ) and contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) are decisive in distinguishing a wide variety of potential disorders that may result in acute abdominal pain .
in case of a symptomatic mesenteric cyst a complete enucleation or resection either with laparoscopy or with laparotomy surgery is considered treatment of choice [ 2 , 3 ] .
we report a case of an infected mesenteric cyst in a 24 - year - old woman presenting with severe abdominal pain and signs of infection , without previous abdominal surgery .
additionally we discuss relevant literature regarding histopathological differentiation and categorization as well as potential treatment options .
2. case presentation a 24 - year - old female without previous abdominal surgery or relevant medical history presented at her general practitioner because of severe abdominal pain , principally in the right lower quadrant , gradually increasing over the last 4 days .
in addition she complained about lower back pain and feeling feverish .
consequently , she was admitted to the emergency department for advanced assessment .
on physical examination at the time of admission , the patient experienced severe pain if palpitated in the right lower abdomen .
her vital signs were stable and cardiac and pulmonary examination were normal .
she was afebrile ; however , this could also be attributed to the use of anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) .
laboratory results confirmed inflammation with an elevated c - reactive protein ( crp ) of 162 mg / l and a normal leucocytes amount of 9.8 x 109 / l. urinalysis was normal .
as a result acute appendicitis was suspected and imaging evaluation was performed .
ultrasound revealed a large , moderately anechoic , multilocular mass in the right hemiabdomen with echogenic components extending from the caudal border of the liver into the right lower quadrant ( figure 1 ) .
due to difficulties in defining the origin of the cystic mass , a complementary contrast - enhanced ct of the complete abdomen was performed .
ct confirmed a well - encapsulated , intramesenteric , multilocular cystic mass in close proximity to the ascending colon , inferior part of the duodenum , and segmental mesenteric vessels ( figure 2 ( a )) .
the cystic mass with a mean ct - attenuation value of 10 hounsfield units ( hu ) showed no enhancing , solid components .
the superior border of the mass showed distinctive , perifocal fat stranding .
in accordance with ultrasound findings , a normal appearing right ovary was observed in the right lower abdomen , as well as a normal appearing appendix .
consequently , based on the radiologic findings an infected mesenteric cyst was suggested .
the patient retained severe , unceasing abdominal pain ; consequently laparotomy was proposed .
at surgery , enucleation of the cystic mass from the mesentery was attempted ; however , due to the intraoperative findings of enlarged lymph nodes and the diffuse mesenteric infiltration in close relationship with adjacent ascending colon , an ileocecal resection was performed .
intraoperatively the cyst was partially opened and did not contain pus but rather greasy , brown , hemorrhagic - like material ( figure 2 ( b )) .
macroscopically there seemed to be no relation with any muscular layer of the bowel wall .
fluid material was not sent for examination ; therefore , bacterial growth was not determined .
microscopic examination of the specimen showed lining of the cystic wall with a flatted cell layer .
additional staining with mesothelial markers and endothelial markers was negative ( figure 2 ( c )) .
the peripheral border of the mass contained a fibrous moderately cell - rich wall with inflammatory , infiltrating changes .
the cystic fluid consisted of protein rich fluids , combined with fibrin , inflammatory cells , and blood components .
furthermore multiple smaller cysts were noted in the mesenteric fat ( figure 3 ) .
based on these findings a false infected mesenteric cyst was histopathologically confirmed .
the patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged in good health three days after surgery .
3. discussion mesenteric cysts are one of the rarest abdominal tumors with less than thousand cases reported in literature , with a reported incidence rate of approximately 1 / 100.000 admissions in adults [ 2 , 4 ] .
they seem to occur slightly more frequently in females and are found in almost all age groups with the highest incidence in the fourth decade of life [ 5 ] .
mesenteric cysts are often asymptomatic and are frequently incidental findings in routine abdominal imaging studies .
however , if acute symptoms occur , that is , in case of complications , surgical resection is often required [ 5 ] .
symptoms are variable and rather nonspecific in case of a complicated cyst .
complications include infection , rupture , hemorrhage , and torsion .
if large , the cyst can cause intestinal obstruction or bowel ischaemia on account of bowel compression or arterial compression , respectively [ 6 , 7 ] .
although very rare , malignant degeneration has been described [ 7 ] .
ultrasound and contrast - enhanced abdominal ct are crucial in the diagnostic workup .
the us appearance is reported to be diverse but should be considered if an avascular oval mesenteric mass is visualized [ 8 ] .
ct is helpful for detecting signs of infection , rupture , or internal bleeding : a thickened enhancing cyst wall with perifocal fatty stranding is suggestive of such complications .
on the other hand , us is superior to ct in demonstrating the internal nature of the cyst .
echogenic content , a thickened capsule , and septations indicate hemorrhage or infection [ 9 ] .
mesenteric cysts can occur anywhere in the mesentery along the gastrointestinal tract but most frequently appear in the small bowel mesentery , particularly the ileum [ 10 ] .
nonetheless determining the origin of an abdominal cystic structure remains a diagnostic challenge , whereas parapancreatic cysts and ovarian related pathology ( e.g. , ectopic endometriosis ) should be ruled out .
in addition , a fine needle aspiration has been reported to be helpful in distinguishing cysts of different origin [ 11 ] .
mri might be complementary in the characterization of the cysts content and its origin .
as an alternative , preoperative laparoscopy could also be helpful in localizing and characterizing .
numerous classifications have been reported to categorize mesenteric cysts based on pathology and etiologic origin [ 12 , 13 ] .
in 2000 de perrot et al. proposed a classification based on histopathology [ 1 ] , where distinction has been made between true and false cysts or pseudocysts .
true cyst possesses an endothelial or mesothelial lining located on the inner wall , whereas a false cyst does not .
in case of an endothelial inner lining it is classified as a cyst of lymphatic origin .
on the other hand , a mesothelial cell lining defines a cyst of mesothelial origin .
hence , immunohistological analysis helps differentiating between these endothelial and mesothelial cells [ 14 ] .
if the cyst arises from adjacent bowel wall , it is consequently classified as an enteric cyst or enteric duplication cyst .
lastly , cysts of urogenital origin and mature , cystic teratomas are the residual classes in this classification system [ 1 ] .
although the exact etiology is uncertain , an accepted theory for cysts of lymphatic origin entails a congenital benign proliferation of ectopic lymphatic tissue in the mesentery , which does not communicate accurately with the residual lymphatic system. by contrast , mesothelial cysts are believed to be a result of congenital failure of the mesenteric leaves to fuse [ 14 ] .
false cysts are caused by trauma or other injuries like previous abdominal surgery or infection .
in our case patients' medical history was unremarkable , in particular no history of previous abdominal surgery or trauma .
still the cyst was classified as a false cyst based on the lack of an endothelial or mesothelial cell lining .
furthermore , the presence of multiple smaller cysts in the mesentery indicated areas of fat necrosis supporting the classification of a false cyst .
a report by kim et al .
[ 15 ] presented a similar case of a young female with an infected false mesenteric cyst without a history of predisposing factors .
treatment of choice for complicated mesenteric cysts is surgery with complete resection of the cystic mass .
this can be accomplished by either laparotomy or laparoscopy .
an advantage of laparoscopy includes the shorter hospital stay but comes with longer procedure time and technical difficulty when the cyst is large or if infected [ 3 ] .
in such cases laparotomy is advised .
depending on the nature of the cyst , anatomic relationships , and intraoperative findings , partial bowel resection might be necessary .
this is mainly required when severance of important arteries in the mesentery cannot be avoided [ 16 ] .
simple aspiration or drainage is not advised due to a high recurrence rate and the chance of infection [ 2 ] .
three case reports have described a successful attempt to sclerose the cyst with ethanol after percutaneous drainage by the interventional radiologist [ 17 , 18 ] .
complete regression of the cyst maintained after follow - up of up to 16 months .
although promising , this technique should be reserved for simple unilocular cysts , with no signs of malignant transformation .
prognosis depends largely on the nature of the mesenteric cyst .
most are benign and therefore have a general good prognosis .
even so , mesotheliomas and lymphangiomas especially have a tendency to recur if resected incompletely [ 1 ] .
4. conclusion mesenteric cysts are rare abdominal tumors and encompass cysts from different origins with different etiologies .
consequently they can occur at diverse sites in the abdominal cavity .
symptomatic mesenteric cysts are preferably treated by surgical resection , through either laparotomy or laparoscopy .
also sclerosis of the cyst might be a feasible alternative , though with limitations .
diagnosis might be challenging and is mainly obtained with ct and us ; therefore , radiologists should be aware of the existence of the ( complicated ) mesenteric cyst .
competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

we have previously demonstrated that neutrophil recruitment to the heart following myocardial infarction ( mi ) is enhanced in mice lacking 11beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11beta - hsd1 ) that regenerates active glucocorticoid within cells from intrinsically inert metabolites .
the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of regulation .
in a mouse model of mi , neutrophil mobilization to blood and recruitment to the heart were higher in 11beta - hsd1 - deficient ( hsd11b1 - / - ) relative to wild - type ( wt ) mice , despite similar initial injury and circulating glucocorticoid .
in bone marrow chimeric mice , neutrophil mobilization was increased when 11beta - hsd1 was absent from host cells , but not when absent from donor bone marrow - derived cells .
consistent with a role for 11beta - hsd1 in ' host ' myocardium , gene expression of a subset of neutrophil chemoattractants , including the chemokines cxcl2 and cxcl5 , was selectively increased in the myocardium of hsd11b1 - / - mice relative to wt .
sm22alpha - cre directed disruption of hsd11b1 in smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes had no effect on neutrophil recruitment .
expression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 was elevated in fibroblast fractions isolated from hearts of hsd11b1 - / - mice post mi and provision of either corticosterone or of the 11beta - hsd1 substrate , 11 - dehydrocorticosterone , to cultured murine cardiac fibroblasts suppressed il - 1alpha - induced expression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 .
these data identify suppression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 chemoattractant expression by 11beta - hsd1 as a novel mechanism with potential for regulation of neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium , and cardiac fibroblasts as a key site for intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration during acute inflammation following myocardial injury .
keywords heart myocardial infarction neutrophil fibroblast chemokine gdf - 15 introduction ischemic cell death associated with myocardial infarction ( mi ) prompts the recruitment and activation of immune cells to ensure repair ( epelman & mann 2012 , frangogiannis 2012 ) .
neutrophils are recruited early , removing necrotic tissue and matrix debris from the damaged myocardium ( frangogiannis 2012 , yan et al .
2013 ) , but they are also important to ensure transition to repair .
macrophage polarization toward a reparative phenotype in the healing myocardium is promoted by neutrophil - derived gelatinase - associated lipocalin and by efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils ( chen et al. 2014 , horckmans et al. 2017 ) .
however , neutrophil recruitment requires tight regulation to minimize the risk of tissue damage due to release of pro - inflammatory mediators , matrix metalloproteinases and oxygen free radicals ( jordan et al. 1999 , ma et al. 2013 ) .
systemic glucocorticoid concentration is increased by the activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis early after mi ( morrison et al. 1976 ) .
active glucocorticoid ( predominantly cortisol in man and corticosterone in rats and mice ) is also regenerated within cells from intrinsically inert metabolites ( cortisone and 11 - dehydrocorticosterone 11 - dhc ) by the intracellular enzyme 11beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11beta - hsd1 ) .
cell - specific enhancement of 11betahsd1 availability by il - 1 ( tomlinson et al. 2001 ) and by glucocorticoid ( chapman et al .
2006 ) serves to locally amplify glucocorticoid action during inflammation ( sun & myatt 2003 , chapman et al. 2013a ) .
when 11beta - hsd1 is deficient or inhibited , neutrophil - driven inflammation is increased in experimental sterile peritonitis ( gilmour et al. 2006 ) , arthritis ( coutinho et al. 2012 , nanus et al .
2015 ) and carrageenan - induced pleurisy ( chapman et al. 2006 , coutinho et al. 2012 ) .
in an earlier study , we found that early neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium also increases in 11beta - hsd1 - deficient mice following induction of mi by coronary artery ligation , and this is associated with increased pro - reparative macrophage polarization and reduced detrimental remodeling ( mcsweeney et al. 2010 ) .
this suggests a key role for intracellular corticosteroid regeneration in regulating neutrophil recruitment to the injured heart , but the underlying mechanisms are unknown ( gray et al. 2017 ) .
neutrophil recruitment requires mobilization from the bone marrow to the blood in response to chemoattractant signals from injured tissue , as well as adhesion to endothelial cells and migration into the tissue .
previous studies have focused on the latter , showing that neutrophil 11beta - hsd1 activity is increased during inflammation and that this activity regulates the expression of l - selectin , cd11b and annexin ( kardon et al. 2008 , coutinho et al. 2016 ) .
however , the heart releases chemoattractants that include interleukin ( il ) - 1 and the cxcr2 - activating elr chemokines such as cxcl1 ( kc ) , cxcl2 ( mip - 2alpha ; macrophage inflammatory protein 2 - alpha ) and cxcl5 ( lix ) , that are essential for neutrophil recruitment after injury ( chandrasekar et al. 2001 , kobayashi 2008 , frangogiannis 2012 ) .
recent studies have also identified growth - differentiation factor - 15 ( gdf - 15 ) as a novel inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment post mi ( kempf et al. 2011 ) .
regulation of the expression of these key molecules is a potential additional mechanism through which glucocorticoid , generated in myocardial cells by 11beta - hsd1 , suppresses neutrophil recruitment after injury .
11beta - hsd1 is expressed by a number of cells found in the heart with the potential to release chemoattractants following injury , including cardiomyocytes ( mazancova et al. 2005 ) , vascular smooth muscle ( hatakeyama et al. 2001 ) , mast cells ( coutinho et al. 2013 ) and resident macrophages ( gilmour et al. 2006 ) and fibroblasts ( sun & myatt 2003 ) .
in a recent study ( white et al. 2016 ) , we reported that 11beta - hsd1 deletion in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle has no effect on chronic remodeling post mi , suggesting that these cells are not likely to be a key site for regulation of myocardial inflammation and repair .
the present study aimed to investigate whether changes in myocardial neutrophil content are accompanied by changes in neutrophil mobilization from bone marrow to the blood ; whether myocardial neutrophil chemoattractant expression post mi is influenced by 11beta - hsd1 availability and key cellular sites of 11beta - hsd1 expression that determine neutrophil recruitment .
materials and methods mice experiments used adult male mice with global deficiency on a c57bl / 6 genetic background ( hsd11b1 - / - ) ( kipari et al .
2013 ) ( supplementary fig. 1 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) , with wt c57bl / 6 mice used as controls .
mice with deletion targeted to vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes ( white et al .
2016 )( hsd11b1fl / flsm22alpha - cre + ; hsd11b1cvcre +) were generated by crossing sm22alpha - cre mice with hsd11b1fl / fl mice , homozygous for a ' floxed ' allele of hsd11b1 ( generated by artemis pharmaceuticals , cologne , germany ) , directly onto a c57bl / 6j background .
loxp sites flanked exon 3 of the mouse hsd11b1 gene .
excision of this exon results in a ' null allele ' by ' out - of - frame splicing ' from exon 2 to exon 4 .
controls were hsd11b1fl / fl ( cre - ; hsd11b1cvcre - ) littermates .
male mice ( 6 - 14 weeks old ) were bred and maintained in conventional barrier unit facilities at the university of edinburgh .
experimental and control mice , wt or cre - littermates ( hsd11b1cvcre - ) , were age matched .
all animal work was compliant with iacuc guidelines , conducted in accordance with the uk government animals ( scientific procedures ) act 1986 and was approved by the university of edinburgh animal welfare and ethical review board .
generation of chimeric mice chimeric mice were created by exposing wt and hsd11b1 - / - mice to a single lethal dose of 10.5 gy radiation .
this was followed by i.v. injection of 1 x 107 donor bone marrow cells harvested from the femurs and tibias of wt or hsd11b1 - / - mice .
to control for the effects of irradiation , ' irradiation control ' animals were generated wherein wt recipients received wt bone marrow .
in ' host ko ' animals , hsd11b1 - / - recipients received wt donor cells , so that all quickly dividing cells prone to radiation , including bone marrow leucocytes , were replaced by cells with a wt phenotype , but host cells were hsd11b1 deficient .
in ' bmko ' animals , wt recipients received hsd11b1 - / - bone marrow , resulting in hsd11b1 - / - neutrophils and wt radio - resistant host tissue .
chimeric animals were housed under pathogen - free conditions in individually ventilated cages and given baytril antibiotic ( 2.5 %) in the drinking water for 1 week before and 4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation .
chimeras were allowed to recover for 8 weeks before appropriate reconstitution was confirmed by flow cytometry of tail vein blood and cal surgery was performed .
coronary artery ligation ( cal ) surgery cal surgery for induction of myocardial infarction was carried out as we have previously described ( white et al. 2016 ) .
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane ( 2 %) , which was maintained for the length of the procedure , and received appropriate analgesia ( buprenorphine 0.05 mg / kg s.c. before surgery and 24 h later ) .
the trachea was intubated and the lungs were ventilated mechanically at 120 strokes / min .
the left thorax was opened at the fourth intercostal space , before the left descending coronary artery ligated with a 6.0 - prolene suture .
after closing the thorax , animals received oxygen in the absence of anesthesia until fully conscious .
plasma troponin measurement tail vein blood was collected from mice 24 h post cal surgery , following administration of analgesic ( buprenorphine 0.05 mg / kg s.c. ) , into 10 mm sodium citrate buffer and centrifuged at 2400 g for 10 min at 4degreesc to produce a plasma phase .
cardiac troponin i ( tn - i ) was measured in the plasma using the mouse high - sensitivity tn - i elisa kit according to the manufacturers instructions ( life diagnostics , staffordshire , uk ) .
tissue collection and immunohistochemistry mice were terminally anesthetized with saline containing ketamine at 50 mg / kg and medetomidine at 0.5 mg / kg by i.p. injection .
hearts were perfusion fixed by infusing heparinized saline ( 10 iu / ml heparin ) , and then 10 % formalin at physiological pressure ( 100 mmhg ) via the abdominal aorta .
hearts were placed in 10 % formalin overnight before processing to wax and paraffin embedding for gr1 + immunohistochemistry ( ihc ; antibody used in table 1 ) as described previously ( mcsweeney et al. 2010 ) .
for quantification , sections were tiled at x40 magnification ( image pro6.2 , stereologer analyser 6 mediacybernetics ) .
the % area stained with the gr1 antibody ( dark brown ) was calculated within the infarct and border area .

flow cytometry of blood and bone marrow cells mice were killed by cervical dislocation , and bone marrow cells were harvested by flushing the femur and tibia with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ; thermo fisher ) as described previously ( kipari et al. 2013 ) .
erythrocytes were lysed ( red blood cell lysis buffer ; sigma - aldrich ) .
0.5 x 106 singly - suspended cells were then blocked with 10 % mouse serum for 20 min on ice , and then incubated for 30 min on ice with appropriate dilutions of antibodies of interest ( table 1 ) in pbs containing 10 % mouse serum .
blood was collected in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer and antibodies were added directly to the blood .
intracellular staining of 11beta - hsd1 in blood neutrophils was carried out as described previously ( de sousa peixoto et al. 2008 ) .
cells were fixed and permeabilized using a kit ( fix and perm , invitrogen ; thermo fisher ) to facilitate intracellular immunostaining of 11betahsd1 .
cells were then washed in pbs before acquisition and analysis ( bd facs lsr fortessa and flowjo software ; oregon , usa ) .
the gating strategy for analyzing blood neutrophils is shown in supplementary fig. 2. fibroblast isolation post mi mice were terminally anesthetized with saline containing ketamine at 50 mg / kg and medetomidine at 0.5 mg / kg by i.p. injection .
heart tissue was digested before fibroblast isolation .
briefly , infarct and surrounding border heart tissues were chopped into small pieces and digested in collagenase d and dnase 1 ( 2.5 mg / ml collagenase d ; 60 u / ml dnase 1 ; ambion ) in hbss ( gibco ; thermo fisher ) at 37degreesc for 30 min following dissociation by gentlemacs dissociator ( according to manufacturer 's instructions ; miltenyi ; surrey , uk ) .
the digested tissue was gently disaggregated and filtered through a 30 microm cell strainer to remove larger cells ( including cardiomyocyes ) .
cells were then centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and washed in pbs .
cardiac fibroblasts were isolated magnetically using a miltenyi neonatal cardiac fibroblast isolation kit ( macs ) , according to manufacturer 's instructions .
three cellular fractions were produced from this isolation method ( fractions 1 - 3 ) .
these were characterized by qpcr ( supplementary fig. 4 ) and flow cytometry using specific cellular markers .
flow cytometry analysis revealed that fraction 1 contained the highest levels of cd45 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( pecam1 ; cd31 ; data not shown ) suggesting enrichment for leukocytes ( nakano et al .
1990 ) and endothelial cells , respectively ( newman 1997 ) , and this was confirmed by qpcr analysis ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
fraction 2 highly expressed the fibroblast markers discoidin domain receptor 2 ( ddr2 ; supplementary fig. 4 ) and type 1 collagen a1 ( col1a1 ; supplementary fig. 4 ) , suggesting that it was enriched for fibroblasts .
fraction 3 , which highly expressed thy1 cell surface antigen ( thy - 1 ; cd90 ) , was also positive for the cardiac fibroblast markers ddr2 and col1a1 ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
in the heart , ddr2 is the most specific marker of cardiac fibroblasts ( camelliti et al. 2005 ) .
thy1 is only expressed by a subset of fibroblasts ( willis et al. 1994 ) .
all isolated ddr2 and col1a1 ( ddr2 + col1a1 +) - expressing cells ( fractions 2 ; thy1low and 3 ; thy1high ) were considered enriched for fibroblasts , and fraction 1 enriched for leukocytes and endothelial cells .
these cellular fractions from wt and hsd11b1 - / - mice were analyzed by qpcr for the production of various genes of interest ( table 2 ) .
qpcr data were also analyzed on fractions enriched for both thy1low and thy1high fibroblasts from wt mice alone post mi ( supplementary fig. 5 ) .

cardiac fibroblasts were collected from hearts by collagenase digestion and cultured as described previously for human cells ( turner et al. 2003 ) .
briefly , ventricular tissue from 6 - to 8 - week - old mice was washed in pbs , and then minced with scissors and digested by adding worthington type ii collagenase ( 600 iu / ml ) for 90 min with occasional shaking at 37degreesc .
after centrifugation of the suspension , the cells were washed twice in dmem cell culture medium , before seeding cells into a t25 tissue culture flask .
non - adherent cells were removed after 30 min , and the remaining cells were incubated with full growth medium ( dmem + 10 % fcs ; thermo fisher ) overnight .
the next day , cells were washed twice with pbs to remove any residual blood cells before the addition of fresh growth medium .
for experiments , cells at passages 1 - 2 were plated into 6 - well plates and serum - starved overnight before incubation for 24 h with medium containing 1 ng / ml il - 1alpha together with 200 nm corticosterone , 200 nm 11 - dehydrocoticosterone ( 11 - dhc ; inert form ) or ethanol ( vehicle control ) .
conditioned media were collected for elisa analysis .
rna was extracted from cell pellets and cdna synthesized for qpcr as described ( turner et al. 2007 ) ( taqman gene expression arrays ; table 2 ) .
chemokine quantification from fibroblast culture supernatant elisas for cxcl2 and cxcl5 in conditioned media from fibroblast cultures were carried out according to manufacturer 's instructions ( r & d systems ) .
rna extraction and quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) rna was extracted from bone marrow , cardiac left ventricular / infarct tissue or fibroblast cell fractions using the trizol method ( according to manufacturers instructions ; thermo fisher ) , and this was then reverse transcribed to cdna ( applied biosystems high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kit or promega reverse transcription system ) .
taqman gene expression arrays ( applied biosystems ) were used to quantify mrna expression of genes ( table 2 ) .
results were normalized for gapdh expression and presented as fold increases over average control level analyzed in parallel , unless otherwise stated .
statistical analyses all values are expressed as mean +/ - s.e.m. unpaired student 's t - test or anova with newman - keuls post - hoc test were used for analysis .

results global deletion of hsd11b1 enhances neutrophil mobilization to blood and recruitment to the heart after mi , without changing infarct injury or plasma corticosterone concentration deletion of 11beta - hsd1 in the hearts of hsd11b1 - / - mice was confirmed by qpcr ( supplementary fig. 1a ) and western blot ( supplementary fig. 1b ) .
after induction of mi , initial cardiac damage was similar in wt and hsd11b1 - / - mice as measured by the concentration of troponin i in tail blood collected 24 h post injury ( supplementary fig. 1c ) .
analysis of hearts collected from these mice showed that gr - 1 immunoreactive neutrophil content in the infarct and border of hsd11b1 - / - mice was significantly higher than that of wt ( fig. 1a and b ; p < 0.05 ) , confirming our previous observations ( mcsweeney et al. 2010 ) .
flow cytometry revealed that blood from hsd11b1 - / - mice also contained significantly more neutrophils ( cd45 + cd11b + ly6g + cells ; supplementary fig. 2 ) post mi compared to wt ( fig. 1c , p < 0.05 ) .
plasma corticosterone concentration in morning blood samples was increased to similar levels in wt and hsd11b1 - / - mice 24 h after induction of mi ( fig. 1d ) , excluding this as a contributing factor to alteration in neutrophil mobilization or recruitment .
figure 1 increased neutrophil mobilization and recruitment to the heart in hsd11b1 - / - mice post mi .

* p < 0.05 .
increased neutrophil mobilization to blood is associated with reduced neutrophil expression of cxcr4 , but not cxcr2 , on bone marrow and blood neutrophils to investigate whether increased mobilization of neutrophils to the blood of hsd11b1 - / - mice could be explained by changes in the expression of receptors determining retention or mobilization in the bone marrow , the surface expression of cxcr2 and cxcr4 on neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry .
the surface expression of cxcr4 , a receptor involved in bone marrow retention of neutrophils ( eash et al .
2010 ) , was found to be reduced on bone marrow neutrophils collected from hsd11b1 - / - mice after mi ( supplementary fig. 3a ; p < 0.05 ) , but there was no change in surface expression of the receptor determining mobilization , cxcr2 ( supplementary fig. 3c ) .
gene expression of cxcl12 ( sdf - 1 ) , the primary ligand for cxcr4 , was not modified in the bone marrow of hsd11b1 - / - compared with wt ( supplementary fig. 3b ) .
increased neutrophil mobilization to blood depends on the absence of hsd11b1 gene expression in host , not donor bone marrow - derived , cells in bone marrow chimeric mice to investigate whether increased mobilization of neutrophils to the blood results from direct effects of hsd11b1 deletion in neutrophils , bone marrow chimeric mice with hsd11b1 deletion in either donor bone marrow cells ( bmko ) or in host cells ( host ko ) were prepared .
for irradiation controls , wt bone marrow was transferred into irradiated wt hosts .
flow cytometric analysis of intracellular 11beta - hsd1 protein in blood neutrophils confirmed appropriate removal .
irradiation control and host ko neutrophils were positive for 11beta - hsd1 expression , but bmko neutrophils did not express this protein ( dashed box ; fig. 2a ) .
in these bone marrow chimeric mice , neutrophil mobilization to the blood was increased relative to irradiation control mice in host ko animals post mi ( fig. 2b ; p < 0.05 ) , but not in bmko mice ( fig. 2b ) .
these data suggest that it is hsd11b1 in a component of the host tissue , rather than in bone marrow - derived cells , that determines increased mobilization of neutrophils to the blood following mi. figure 2 absence of gene expression in host cells in bone marrow chimera causes increased neutrophil mobilization but targeted deletion of hsd11b1 - / - in smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes does not affect neutrophil mobilization or recruitment post mi. flow cytometric analysis confirms appropriate presence or absence of 11beta - hsd1 in the neutrophils of chimeric mice ( a ) .
blood neutrophil numbers were measured in chimeric mice ( b ; n = 7 / 6 / 6 , p < 0.05 ) .

( d ) analysis of blood neutrophil numbers in control ( hsd11b1cvcre - ) vs experimental animals ( hsd11b1cvcre +) at 1 day post mi. n = 4 / 4 .
11beta - hsd1 deletion in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells does not influence neutrophil mobilization or accumulation in the myocardium cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle are key sites of 11beta - hsd1 expression in the heart .
to investigate whether 11beta - hsd1 activity here might account for enhanced neutrophil mobilization to the blood and recruitment to the heart , mi was induced in mice with targeted deletion of hsd11b1 in smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes ( white et al. 2016 ) .
however , floxed control , hsd11b1cvcre - and hsd11b1cvcre + mice all had similar numbers of neutrophils in the heart ( fig. 2c ) and blood ( fig. 2d ) following coronary artery ligation .
11beta - hsd1 deletion increases cardiac expression of a subset of neutrophil chemoattractant genes after mi to investigate potential mediators of increased neutrophil recruitment to the heart , expression of a panel of genes encoding molecules known to regulate neutrophil recruitment was assessed in the left ventricle of hearts from hsd11b1 - / - and wt mice .
cardiac expression levels of genes encoding the neutrophil chemoattractants cxcl1 ( kc ) and ccl3 ( mip - 1alpha ) , as well as the inflammasome nlrp3 , and the adhesion molecule , l - selectin were all increased in hearts collected after mi relative to control hearts , but expression of these genes was not modified in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice relative to wt ( fig. 3a ; p < 0.05 ) .
expression of the neutrophil inhibitory peptide gdf - 15 was also increased post mi , consistent with previous observations ( kempf et al .
2011 ) , but was not modified in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice relative to wt ( fig. 3b ) .
in contrast , expression of genes encoding cxcl2 ( mip - 2alpha ) , cxcl5 ( lix ) , il1b ( il - 1beta ) and il6 ( il - 6 ) was increased in the heart after mi and further increased in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice compared to wt mice ( fig. 3c ) .
figure 3 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment increase in the heart post mi. qpcr was carried out on infarct and border cardiac tissue from wt or hsd11b1 - / - mice 24 h post mi and compared to naive wt ventricular tissue .

( c ) cxcl2 , cxcl5 , il1b and il6 were all expressed to a greater extent in hsd11b1 - / - than in wt infarct tissue .

cxcl2 and cxcl5 expression is increased in fibroblasts isolated from infarcted hearts of mice deficient in 11beta - hsd1 cardiac fibroblasts express 11beta - hsd1 ( furtado et al .
2014 ) and as ' host ' cells in bone marrow chimera mice , it was reasoned that fibroblasts were a potential site for regulation of neutrophil chemoattractant expression in the infarcted heart .
three cellular fractions were isolated by magnetic bead separation ( see ' materials and methods' section and supplementary fig. 4 ) from the infarct and infarct border of hearts from wt and hsd11b1 - / - mice collected 24 h post mi .
cxcl2 was found to be preferentially expressed in the ddr2 + col1a1 + thy1high fibroblast fraction from wt hearts ( fraction 3 ; supplementary fig. 5a ; p < 0.01 ) , and expression was increased 10 - fold in this cellular fraction when isolated from hearts of hsd11b1 - / - mice ( fraction 3 ; fig. 4a ; p < 0.05 ) .
cxcl5 was preferentially expressed by ddr2 + col1a1 + thy1low fibroblast fraction ( fraction 2 ; supplementary fig. 5b ; p < 0.005 ) and expression was significantly increased in fibroblasts isolated from hearts of hsd11b1 - / - mice relative to wt after mi ( fig. 4b ; p < 0.01 ) .
hsd11b1 was expressed in both fibroblast subsets following mi ( supplementary fig. 6 ) .
il - 1 and il - 6 were expressed in fraction 1 containing cd45 + leucocytes and cd31 + ve endothelial cells , as well as in fibroblasts , but expression levels did not differ between wt and hsd11b1 - / - animals in any fraction ( fig. 4c and d ) .
figure 4 cardiac fibroblasts express cxcl2 and cxcl5 post mi , which increase in the absence of intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration .
qpcr analysis of cxcl2 ( a ) and cxcl5 ( b ) , il1b ( c ) and il - 6 ( d ) performed on rna isolated from the cellular fractions 1 - 3 ( supplementary methods ) in wt vs hsd11b1 - / - mice .

11beta - hsd1 regulates the expression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 by cardiac fibroblasts in vitro to confirm a role for glucocorticoid regeneration in regulating chemokine expression in cardiac fibroblasts , fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of wt mice , cultured in vitro and activated by exposure to il - 1alpha for 24 h ( fig. 5 ) .
il - 1 induced an increase in the expression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 genes in cardiac fibroblasts ( fig. 5a ) that was accompanied by increased secretion of cxcl2 and cxcl5 protein into the culture medium bathing these cells ( fig. 5c and d ) .
administration of corticosterone ( 200 nm ) or of 11 - dehydrocorticosterone ( 11 - dhc ; 200 nm ) , the product and substrate of 11beta - hsd1 , respectively , suppressed il - 1alpha - induced gene expression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 ( fig. 5b ) and tended to reduce protein release ( fig. 5c and d ) .
although expression of il6 was not modified in fibroblasts freshly isolated from the heart , it was significantly increased by il - 1alpha in cultured cells , and this was suppressed by corticosterone and 11 - dhc ( fig. 5e ) .

discussion neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the heart following injury and are required for tissue repair ( frangogiannis 2012 , yan et al .
2013 ) , but regulation is essential as excessive or prolonged recruitment can result in increased tissue damage and impaired repair ( jordan et al. 1999 , ma et al. 2013 ) .
the results from the present study identify suppression of myocardial cxcl2 and cxcl5 chemoattractant expression by 11beta - hsd1 as a novel mechanism with potential for regulation of neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium following infarction .
furthermore , the data indicate that cardiac fibroblasts are a key site for glucocorticoid regeneration by 11beta - hsd1 during acute inflammation following myocardial injury .
glucocorticoids , released acutely from the adrenal glands after mi , not only have direct anti - inflammatory effects , but also promote intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration from inert metabolites that enter cells from the circulation , thus amplifying their effects specifically in cells that express 11beta - hsd1 ( chapman et al. 2013a , gray et al. 2017 ) .
in the present study , systemic glucocorticoid was increased to the same extent in mice with and without 11beta - hsd1 after mi ; yet , in agreement with our previous observation ( mcsweeney et al .
2010 ) , neutrophil recruitment to the heart was increased in the absence of 11beta - hsd1 .
11beta - hsd1 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition similarly enhances neutrophil recruitment in other models of sterile inflammation , including arthritic joints , and in sterile peritonitis ( coutinho et al. 2012 , chapman et al. 2013b ) .
thus , intracellular regeneration of glucocorticoid in cells that express 11beta - hsd1 promotes mechanisms that restrain neutrophil recruitment during inflammation .
neutrophils express hsd11b1 and expression is increased as they are recruited to sites of inflammation ( kardon et al. 2008 , coutinho et al. 2016 ) .
alteration in the expression of neutrophil adhesion molecules , including l - selectin , was identified as a mechanism associated with increased neutrophil recruitment that accompanies pharmacological inhibition of 11beta - hsd1 in peritonitis ( coutinho et al. 2016 ) .
such a mechanism could be involved in the post - mi heart , although expression of l - selectin was unchanged in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice relative to wt. increased neutrophil content of myocardium post mi was matched by increased blood neutrophil numbers .
bone marrow neutrophils express 11beta - hsd1 at a higher level during inflammation ( coutinho et al .
2016 ) , and we considered the possibility that this could influence neutrophil egress from the bone marrow .
egress is regulated by the balance between the actions of release signals ( e.g. cxcl1 , cxcl5 ) interacting with neutrophil cxcr2 and pro - retention signals in the bone marrow , particularly cxcl12 interacting with cxcr4 ( eash et al. 2010 ) .
flow cytometry revealed that cxcr2 on bone marrow neutrophils from hsd11b1 - / - mice post mi was not changed relative to wt but that expression of cxcr4 was reduced .
glucocorticoids upregulate cxcr4 expression on eosinophils and t - lymphocytes ( wang et al. 1998 , nagase et al .
2000 ) , and this result suggests that glucocorticoid regenerated through 11beta - hsd1 could engage a similar mechanism in neutrophils .
however , in bone marrow chimeric mice , blood neutrophil numbers were increased in mice with ' host ' knockout of hsd11b1 , but not in mice with bone marrow cell knockout of 11beta - hsd1 .
therefore , although an influence of neutrophil 11beta - hsd1 activity cannot be excluded , activity in ' host ' cells seem to be more central to the promotion of neutrophil mobilization after mi. this could include the non - myeloid component of the bone marrow itself and , although 11beta - hsd1 failed to influence the expression of the retention factor cxcl12 in the bone marrow stroma , this merits further investigation .
the heart releases a number of cxcr2 ligands in response to injury ( frangogiannis 2012 ) and myocardial cells that express 11beta - hsd1 likely represent a key ' host ' component associated with the promotion of neutrophil mobilization post mi. investigation of neutrophil chemoattractant expression revealed that while a number of these molecules , including cxcl1 / kc , were expressed at a higher level in the heart after mi , only a subset , including cxcl2 and cxcl5 , il - 1 and il - 6 were further increased in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice .
transfer of bone marrow from hsd11b1 - / - mice replaced myeloid components of the myocardium without altering neutrophil mobilization , suggesting that any alteration in gene expression relevant to this outcome is in non - myeloid cells of the heart .
these cells include cardiomyocytes ( mazancova et al. 2005 ) , smooth muscle cells ( hatakeyama et al. 2001 ) and fibroblasts ( sun & myatt 2003 ) .
11beta - hsd1 enzyme activity is not detectable in endothelial cells ( christy et al. 2003 , dover et al. 2007 ) .
neither mobilization to blood nor recruitment to the heart were increased following mi in mice with targeted deletion of hsd11b1 in smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes , ruling out 11beta - hsd1 in these cells as being key in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment .
this is consistent with our previous observations that hsd11b1 deletion in these cells did not influence angiogenesis or the development of heart failure following mi ( white et al. 2016 ) .
fibroblasts are abundant in the heart ( shinde & frangogiannis 2014 ) .
they have immunomodulatory roles in many sites of the body ( smith et al. 1997 , silzle et al .
2004 ) regulating the types and functions of leukocytes recruited ( silzle et al. 2004 ) .
cardiac fibroblasts secrete immunoactive molecules ( turner et al .
2011 , shinde & frangogiannis 2014 ) and express 11beta - hsd1 particularly highly ( furtado et al. 2014 ) .
in synovial fibroblasts 11beta - hsd1 activity results in the suppression of inflammation associated with arthritis ( hardy et al. 2006 , hardy et al. 2008 , ahasan et al. 2012 ) .
to investigate whether 11beta - hsd might have this role in the heart , ddr2 + col1a1 + fibroblasts were isolated from the mouse heart post mi. cardiac fibroblasts expressed varying levels of thy1 and , interestingly , cxcl2 expression was specifically increased in thy1high fractions , whereas cxcl5 expression was increased in the thy1low fibroblast - enriched fraction .
hsd11b1 expression was confirmed in both fractions ( fig. 6 ) .
pro - inflammatory cytokines downregulate fibroblast thy1 expression ( hagood et al .
2005 ) , and differences in cell expression may indicate subsets that have been exposed to different levels of cytokine or are in different states of activation in the healing infarct .
like cxcl2 and cxcl5 , il1b and il6 expression was increased more in hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice after mi. cultured human cardiac fibroblasts produce il - 1 and il - 6 in culture ( turner et al .
2007 ) and 11beta - hsd1 was able to regulate the expression of il6 in cultured mouse cardiac fibroblasts in this study , as it does in cultured fibroblasts from other tissues ( hardy et al. 2006 ) .
however , there was no evidence for specific regulation of il1 or il6 expression by 11beta - hsd1 in fibroblasts freshly isolated from the infarcted heart .
this could reflect differences in the environment and in fibroblast phenotype in situ in the heart 24 h after induction of mi , compared to culture conditions .
in fact , expression of il1b and il6 in the cell fraction containing cd45 + ve cells suggests that increased representation of mrna from the increased number of recruited inflammatory cells in hsd11b1 - / - relative to wt hearts is more likely to account for their higher expression in intact hearts from hsd11b1 - / - mice .
figure 6 schema for the regulation of neutrophil recruitment to the heart by 11beta - hsd1 .
( a ) chemokines produced by fibroblasts in response to pro - inflammatory cytokines recruit neutrophils to the heart post mi ( 1 ) .
thy1high and thy1low cardiac fibroblasts preferentially produce cxcl2 and cxcl5 , respectively ( 2 ) .
11beta - hsd1 catalyzes the regeneration of local glucocorticoid , dampening chemokine expression ( 3 ) .
circulating corticosterone and il - 1alpha from necrotic cardiomyocytes increase 11beta - hsd1 expression ( 4 ) .
( b ) in the absence of 11beta - hsd1 , fibroblasts are driven to produce excess cxcl2 and cxcl5 ( 5 ) , unleashed due to the lack of dampening local glucocorticoid ( 6 ) , driving increased neutrophil recruitment to the infarcted heart ( 7 ) .
il - 1alpha is induced early after ischemic injury in the heart , particularly by necrotic cardiomyocytes ( fig. 6 ) ( lugrin et al .
2015 ) , and il - 1 receptor signaling is hypothesized to be critically important in regulating inflammatory pathways in the healing infarct , including promotion of pro - inflammatory cytokine release ( turner 2014 ) .
in cultured murine cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with il - 1alpha , provision of either corticosterone or 11 - dehydrocorticosterone , the substrate for 11beta - hsd1 , decreased cxcl2 and cxcl5 expression , consistent with the regulation of gene expression secondary to 11beta - hsd1 activity in these cells ( fig. 6 ) .
cxcl2 expression is known to be repressed by gr activation ( uhlenhaut et al .
2013 ) , and cxcl5 was first described in mouse fibroblasts as a glucocorticoid - attenuated response gene ( garg ) ( smith & herschman 1996 ) .
importantly , dampening of cxcl2 ( montecucco et al. 2013 ) and of cxcl5 ( chandrasekar et al .
2001 ) is known to reduce neutrophil - mediated tissue injury post mi. in future , it may be of value to further investigate the specific role of stromal cells in regulating neutrophil recruitment via these mediators , for example using an in vitro co - culture system ( munir et al. 2016 ) .
suppression of neutrophil recruitment is likely to be beneficial in terms of limiting acute injury to the myocardium , particularly following reperfusion .
however , neutrophils secrete gelatinase - associated lipocalin that promotes macrophage polarization toward a pro - repair phenotype ( chen et al. 2014 , horckmans et al .
2017 ) and acquisition of this phenotype is also enhanced by efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils ( chen et al. 2014 ) .
macrophage polarization toward a reparative ' m2 ' phenotype is enhanced in 11betahsd1 - deficient mice during wound healing ( mcsweeney et al .
2010 ) , and this associates with improved long - term functional outcome ( white et al. 2016 ) .
thus , early promotion of neutrophil recruitment to the myocardium may contribute to enhancement of tissue repair when 11beta - hsd1 activity is lost .
alternatively , changes in the fibroblasts secretome under the influence of 11beta - hsd1 may directly influence macrophage polarization status .
while these data are supportive of cardiac fibroblasts as a key site for regulation of acute inflammation following myocardial injury , this mechanism needs to be more thoroughly tested in mice with fibroblast specific hsd11b1 deletion .
targeting cre - lox - mediated gene deletion specifically to fibroblasts has proved difficult in the past due to the lack of sufficiently selective cre - mouse lines .
however , col1a2 cre has recently been applied successfully to target fibroblasts during myocardial infarct healing ( duan et al .
2012 ) , and in future , this approach will provide a means for testing the importance of hsd11b1 in fibroblasts , and other mesenchymal cells , post mi. in conclusion , these data are consistent with a novel role for 11beta - hsd1 in the regulation of acute inflammation following mi , via suppression of cxcl2 and cxcl5 chemoattractant expression and are supportive of cardiac fibroblasts as a key site for glucocorticoid regeneration by 11beta - hsd1 following myocardial injury .

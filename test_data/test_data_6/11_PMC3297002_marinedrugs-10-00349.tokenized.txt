two new tryptamine - derived alkaloids , named as leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) and ( - ) - leptoclinidamine b ( 2 ) , were isolated from an indonesian ascidian leptoclinides dubius together with c2 - alpha - d - mannosylpyranosyl - l - tryptophan ( 3 ) .
the structure of 1 was assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data for 1 and its n - acetyl derivative ( 4 ) .
compound 1 was an amide of tryptamine with two beta - alanine units .
although the planar structure of 2 is identical to that of the known compound (+) - leptoclinidamine b ( 5 ) , compound 2 was determined to be the enantiomer of 5 based on amino acid analysis using hplc methods .
compounds 1 to 4 were evaluated for cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines , hct - 15 ( colon ) and jurkat ( t - cell lymphoma ) cells , but none of the compounds showed activity .
leptoclinidamide leptoclinidamine tryptamine alkaloid indonesian ascidian leptoclinides dubius 1 .
introduction ascidians are a rich source of biologically - active nitrogenous substances with high chemical diversity [ 1,2 ] .
more than 80 % of new compounds from ascidians contained nitrogen , and about 70 % of nitrogenous compounds are alkaloids [ 3 ] .
in the course of our studies on the bioactive components from marine invertebrates , we found that the etoh extract of an indonesian ascidian leptoclinides dubius inhibited the growth of escherichia coli .
chemical study on the etoh extract led to the isolation of two tryptamine - derived alkaloids , a c - glycosylated tryptophan and an antibacterial compound .
two alkaloids were revealed to be new compounds and named as leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) and ( - ) - leptoclinidamine b ( 2 , figure 1 ) , and a tryptophan derivative was assigned as c2 - alpha - d - mannosylpyranosyl - l - tryptophan ( 3 ) [ 4,5,6,7,8 ] .
the major bioactive constituent could not be identified because the amount obtained from the ascidian was not enough to measure 2d nmr spectra .
figure 1 structures of leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) , ( - ) - leptoclinidamine b ( 2 ) , and c2 - alpha - d - mannosylpyranosyl - l - tryptophan ( 3 ) .
we report herein the isolation and structures of two new tryptamine - derived alkaloids leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) and ( - ) - leptoclinidamine b ( 2 ) , which had unique amide moiety with two beta - alanine units and d - arginine moiety , respectively .
2. results and discussion the etoh extract of an indonesian ascidian l. dubius showed antimicrobial activity in the screening bioassay against escherichia coli and was separated into nine fractions ( fraction 1 - fraction 9 ) by octadecylsilyl ( ods ) column chromatography .
leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) was isolated from fraction 6 ( 50 % meoh eluate ) by hplc ( ods ) and compounds 2 and 3 were obtained from fraction 3 ( 30 % meoh eluate ) and fraction 2 ( water eluate ) , respectively .
the antibacterial activity against e. coli was detected in fraction 5 ( 50 % meoh eluate , 10 mm inhibition zone at 250 mug / disk ) , and hplc separation of fraction 5 gave an antibacterial compound as a single hplc peak .
unfortunately , the antibacterial component did not give an informative 1h nmr spectrum because of the small amounts obtained , and , therefore , 2d nmr experiments could not be recorded .
the structure of compound 3 was assigned on the basis of its spectral data and comparison with that of the reported values for c2 - alpha - d - mannosylpyranosyl - l - tryptophan [ 6,7 ] .
compound 3 was first identified as a novel post - translationally modified tryptophan in human rnases [ 4 ] and isolated thereafter from the ascidian l. dubius in 2000 [ 8 ] , but the role of compound 3 have not yet been elucidated .
leptoclinidamide ( 1 ) was obtained as a tfa salt .
the fab - ms spectrum of 1 showed a peak at m / z 303.1821 , and 16 13c signals were detected in the 13c nmr spectrum ( dmso - d6 ) .
however , the 1h signals due to amine moiety were observed as broad peak in the nmr spectrum of 1 .
therefore , the molecular weight and formula of 1 were confirmed by the spectroscopic data for an n - acetyl derivative ( 4 ) of 1 .
compound 4 gave an [ m + h ]+ ion at m / z 345.1930 in the hrfab - ms , and the molecular formula of 4 was determined as c18h25n4o3 .
accordingly , the molecular formula of 1 , which revealed an [ m + h ]+ ion at m / z 303.1821 in the hrfab - ms , were deduced as c16h22n4o2 ( 8 degrees of unsaturation ) .
the ir spectrum of 1 showed absorption bands at 1681 and 1584 cm - 1 , which were ascribable to two amide carbonyl groups .
the 13c signals of 1 were classified into six methylene , four sp2 methine , one nitrogenated sp2 methine , two sp2 quaternary , one nitrogenated sp2 quaternary and two amide carbonyl carbons by the analysis of 13c nmr , dept and hmqc spectra of 1 .
the 1h nmr spectrum ( dmso - d6 ) of 1 displayed 22 signals including n - h protons due to a primary amine ( deltah 7.66 , 2h ) , two amides ( deltah 7.93 and 8.07 ) , and an indole ring ( deltah 10.8 ) .
table 1 shows 1h and 13c nmr data for 1 assigned by the analysis of 1h - 1h cosy , hmqc and hmbc spectra .
the 1h - 1h cosy spectrum of 1 revealed the partial structures i through v ( figure 2 ) .
the presence of an indole ring was suggested by the 1h nmr signals at delta 7.09 ( h - 2 ) , 7.48 ( h - 5 ) , 6.93 ( h - 6 ) , 7.02 ( h - 7 ) , 7.29 ( h - 8 ) , and 10.8 ( 1 - nh ) and hmbc correlations from these signals to the expected 13c nmr signals .
hmbc correlations from h2 - 10 ( deltah 2.77 ) to c - 2 ( deltac 122.5 ) , c - 3 ( deltac 111.8 ) , and c - 4 ( deltac 127.2 ) and from h2 - 11 ( deltah 3.29 ) to c - 3 revealed a tryptamine unit in the molecule of 1 .
the 1h nmr signals at delta 3.29 ( h2 - 11 ) showed an hmbc correlation to one of two amide carbonyl carbons at deltac 170.0 ( c - 13 ) .
the other amide linkage was determined by hmbc correlations to c - 17 ( deltac 169.2 ) from 16 - nh ( deltah 8.07 ) , h2 - 18 ( deltah 2.38 ) , and h2 - 19 ( deltah 2.93 ) .
these data suggested the structure of 1 as shown in figure 1 .
the structure of 1 was further confirmed by the analysis of the n - acetyl derivative ( 4 ) .
the 1h nmr spectrum of 4 showed new signals corresponding to a methyl proton signal at delta 1.75 and a new amide proton signal at deltah7.78 and a corresponding loss of two primary amine proton signals detected in the 1h nmr spectrum of 1 ( deltah7.66 ) .
these data led to the conclusion that leptoclinidamide has the structure 1 as shown in figure 1 .

compound 2 showed a molecular ion peak at m / z 362 [ m + h ]+ in the fab - ms , and the molecular formula c16h20n5o5 was deduced from hrfab - ms. the nmr spectrum of 2 revealed the presence of a disubstituted indole ring and an arginine moiety .
a literature to search suggested the structure of (+) - leptoclinidamine b ( 5 ) as a candidate , and this structure was confirmed by comparing 1h and 13c nmr data for 2 with those for the reported values [ 9 ] .
compound 5 was originally isolated from an ascidian leptoclinides durus and showed no apparent antiprotozoal or cytotoxic activity [ 9 ] .
although 1h and 13c nmr spectra of 2 were identical to those of 5 , the sign of the specific rotation of 2 was negative ([ alpha ] d - 20.6 in meoh ) , suggesting that compound 2 was the enantiomer of 5 ([ alpha ] d + 27.0 in meoh ) [ 4 ] .
to determine the absolute configulation of 2 , amino acid analysis was carried out by the methods described in the experimental section .
the acid hydrolysate of 2 was analyzed by using chiral hplc .
in the analysis , an amino acid in the hydrolysate of 2 was detected at 3.7 min , which corresponded to d - arg ( l - arg eluted at 11.3 min ) .
this result was confirmed by marfey 's method [ 10,11 ] .
the hydrolysate of 2 was treated with marfey 's reagent , 5 - fluoro - 2,4 - dinitrophenyl - l - leucine amide ( l - fdla ) , and the resulting derivative was analyzed by hplc using an ods column .
an l - fdla derivative of an amino acid in the hydrolysate of 2 showed the same retention time as that of the derivative from d - arg ( 13.4 min ) , whereas the l - fdla derivative of l - arg eluted at 15.9 min .
consequently , the absolute stereochemistry of 2 was determined to be 13r , as shown in figure 1 .
very recently , herdmanines a - d containing a d - arg unit were isolated from a solitary ascidian herdmania momus [ 12 ] .
no biological activities have been reported for compound 3 .
compounds 1 - 4 were tested for their cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines ( colon adenocarcinoma hct - 15 and t - cell leukemia jurkat cells ) .
however , none of the four compounds displayed activity against these cell lines at 30 mum .
since fractions 2 , 3 , and 6 , from which respective compounds 3 , 2 , and 1 were isolated , did not show growth inhibitory activity against four microorganisms ( see experimental section ) , compounds 1 - 3 will not have antimicrobial activity .
further study on biological activity of 1 is now in progress .
more l. dubius will be collected from the same site to provide sufficient amounts of the antibacterial component for structural characterization .
3. experimental section 3.1 .
general fab - ms spectra were obtained using a jeol jms - ms 700 mass spectrometer ( tokyo , japan ) .
1h and 13c nmr spectra were recorded on a jeol jnm - al - 400 nmr spectrometer ( 400 mhz for 1h and 100 mhz for 13c ) in dmso - d6 ( deltah 2.46 , deltac 39.5 ) or cd3od ( deltah 3.31 , deltac 49.0 ) .
optical rotations were measured with a jasco p - 2300 digital polarimeter ( tokyo , japan ) .
uv spectra were recorded on a hitachi u - 3310 uv - visible spectrophotometer ( tokyo , japan ) and ir spectra on a perkinelmer spectrum one fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( waltham , ma , usa ) .
preparative hplc was carried out with a hitachi l - 6200 system .

3.3 .
ascidian the ascidian was collected by scuba diving at the coral reef in the lembeh strait , north sulawesi , indonesia in october 2009 and identified as leptoclinides dubius by t. n. the voucher specimen is deposited at the national museum of nature and science , tokyo as nsmt pc - 1123 .
3.4 .
extraction and isolation the ascidian ( 250 g , wet weight ) was cut into small pieces and soaked in etoh on a boat immediately after collection .
the organism was further extracted twice with etoh .
the etoh extract ( 3.57 g ) was suspended in h2o and adsorbed on an ods column ( 100 g ) .
the ods column was eluted stepwise with 0 , 30 , 50 , 70 , and 100 % meoh in 0.10 % tfa aqueous solution into nine fractions ( fraction 1 - fraction 9 ) .
fraction 2 , eluted with h2o , was concentrated to yield a red brown oil ( 108.0 mg ) , and 20.0 mg of the fraction was purified by preparative hplc column , pegasil ods ( 10 mm x 250 mm ) ; solvent , 35 % meoh containing 0.10 % tfa ; flow rate , 2.0 ml / min ; detection , uv at 210 nm ] to give compound 3 ( eluted at 9.9 min ) as a colorless solid ( 6.0 mg ) .
fraction 3 , eluted with 30 % meoh , was concentrated to yield a red brown oil ( 399.5 mg ) , and 20.0 mg was fractionated by preparative hplc ( same conditions as fraction 2 ) to yield compound 2 ( eluted at 11.0 min ) as a pale yellow oil ( 4.0 mg ) .
fraction 5 ( 95. 0 mg ) , eluted with 50 % meoh , was active against e. coli and subjected to ods hplc with 40 % meoh containing 0.10 % tfa ( the other conditions were the same as above ) into six fractions ( fraction 5 - 1 - fraction 5 - 6 ) .
fraction 5 - 6 showed the growth inhibition against e. coli , but the amounts were not enough to obtain a good 1h nmr spectrum .
fraction 6 , eluted with 50 % meoh , was concentrated to dryness ( 50.5 mg ) , and 20.0 mg was separated by preparative hplc with the same conditions as fraction 5 and afforded compound 1 ( eluted at 15.0 min ) as a colorless oil ( 2.0 mg ) .

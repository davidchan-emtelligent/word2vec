background this study aims to characterize genetically related class 1 integrons in1069 , in893 and in1287 to in1290 , and to further propose a scheme of stepwise integration or excision of individual gene cassettes ( gcs ) to generation of these integron variations .
methods six of 139 non - redundant enterobacteriaceae strains were studied by bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility testing , detection of carbapenemase activity , and integron sequencing and sequence comparison .
results six novel class 1 integrons , in0 , in1069 , and in1287 to in1290 , together with the previously characterized in893 , were determined from the above strains .
an unusual bla kpc - 2 - carrying in0 and the bla imp - 30 - carrying in1069 coexists in a single isolate of escherichia coli .
in0 contains a pch1 promoter and a truncated aaca4 ' - 3 gene cassette ( gcaaca4 ' - 3 ) , as well as a bla kpc - 2 - containing region of tn6296 integrated between pch1 and gcaaca4 ' - 3 .
in1069 carries gcbla imp - 30 and gcaaca4 ' - 3 in this order .
the other five integrons , in893 and in1287 to in1290 , are genetically related to in1069 , and all possess a core gcaaca4 ' - 3 .
the integration or excision of one or more individual gene cassettes , such as gcbla imp - 30 , gcaada16 , gccatb3 , gcarr3 and gcdfra27 , upstream or downstream of gcaaca4 ' - 3 generates various gene cassettes arrays among these five integrons .
conclusions these findings provide the insight into stepwise and parallel evolution of in1069 - associated integron variations likely under antibiotic selection pressure in clinical settings .

keywords class 1 integron gene cassette blakpc - 2 blaimp - 30 enterobacteriaceae the special key project of biosafety and techologies2016yfc1202600the foundation of science and techology of zhejiangprovince2014c33153 wang dongguo the foundation of zhejiang health department , china2014kyb218 wang dongguo issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background integrons are genetic elements containing a site - specific recombination system capable of integrating , exchanging , and expressing gene cassettes ( gcs ) .
each gc is composed of an exogenous and often promoterless gene together with a recombination site , attc [ 1 - 5 ] .
the recombination system possesses an integrase gene , inti , needed for site - specific recombination , an adjacent recombination site , atti , recognized by the inti integrase , and a promoter , pc , located upstream of atti and necessary for efficient transcription and expression of gcs [ 1 - 5 ] .
the attc site is also recognized by inti , and recombination between attc and atti leads to the addition and exchange of gcs and further generation of a multi - gc array within the integron structure [ 1 - 5 ] .
based on the amino acid sequences of inti integrase , integrons can be divided into different classes , with those carrying inti1 defined as class 1 , inti2 as class 2 , inti3 as class 3 , and so on. class 1 integrons are the most common type present among enterobacteriaceae isolates [ 6 - 8 ] .
class 1 integrons constitute a substantial reservoir of resistance genes that confer a selective advantage upon strong selection pressure imposed by human use of antimicrobial compounds , leading to the horizontal transfer of integron - carrying resistance markers from the community to hospitals and the development of multidrug resistance ( mdr ) among enterobacteriaceae , independent of species or isolate origin [ 6 - 8 ] .
the ancestors of class 1 integrons are not considered to be mobile elements , and the connection of class 1 integrons with tn402 with a complete tniabqc transposition module generates a hybrid structure flanked by the 25 bp terminal inverted repeat initial ( iri ) and inverted repeat terminal ( irt ) , making class 1 integrons capable of self - mobility [ 1 - 3 ] .
the capture and formation of a quaternary ammonium compound resistance ( qacedelta1 ) - sulphonamide resistance ( sul1 ) - orf5 region occurs immediately downstream of the gc array [ 1 - 3 ] .
eventually , class 1integrons manifest as a prototype structure organized in order of iri , a 5 ' - conserved segment ( 5 ' - cs : inti - atti ) , a central variable region ( the gc array ) , a 3 ' - conserved segment ( 3 ' - cs : qacedelta1 - sul1 - orf5 - tniabqc ) , and irt [ 1 - 3 ] .
most class 1 integrons from clinical contexts carry modifications at their 5 ' and 3 ' ends , especially partial or complete deletions of the tniabqc module of tn402 , which impairs their mobility [ 4 , 5 ] .
these integrons are often inserted within mobile dna elements such as plasmids and transposons , facilitating their rapid spread in the community and within hospitals [ 4 , 5 ] .
this work presents the sequences of six novel class 1 integrons , in0 , in1069 and in1287 to in1290 , together with the previously characterized in893 .
these integrons were obtained from clinical escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and enterobacter cloacae isolates .
the bla kpc - 2 - carrying unusual in0 and the bla imp - 30 - carrying in1069 coexist in a single escherichia coli isolate .
the detailed genetic characterization of genetically related integrons in1069 , in893 and in1287 to in1290 denotes a scheme of stepwise integration or excision of individual gcs to generate these integron variations .
methods bacterial isolates and identification a total of 139 non - redundant enterobacteriaceae strains , including escherichia coli ec6335 , escherichia coli ec4212 , klebsiella pneumoniae kp1262 , enterobacter cloacae ecl2236 , escherichia coli ec7328 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp5325 , were recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in a teaching hospital of taizhou , china , from january 2014 to september 2015 .
bacterial species were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing [ 9 ] .
all dna markers listed in table 1 were screened by pcr amplification ( thermofisher scientific , usa ) using the listed primers , followed by amplicon sequencing on an abi 3730 sequencer ( thermofisher scientific , usa ) .
pcr was run for 3 min at 94 degreesc followed by 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturing at 94 degreesc and annealing at 50 to 59 degreesc according to various primers , with a final elongation of 10 min at 72 degreesc on life veriti ( r ) pcr machine ( invitrogen , usa ) .

plasmid dna was then isolated from this strain using the axyprep plasmid miniprep kit ( axygen , usa ) , digested with bamhi , and ligated into the cloning vector pmd19 - t. this was transformed into host bacteria escherichia coli top10 , which were screened for bla kpc - or bla imp - positivity .
inserts within recombinant pmd19 - t vectors from the above transformants were sequenced using the primer walking method .
for cloning of in893 and in1287 to in1290 , the strains ec4212 , kp1262 , ecl2236 , ec7328 , and kp5325 , each co - harboring the three genes aaca4 , inti1 , and tnir , were identified by pcr , then dna fragments were amplified from these strains using the primer pair inti1 - f / tnir - r2 and subsequently sequenced as above .
sequence annotation and comparison open reading frames were predicted using rast 2.0 [ 10 ] combined with blastp / blastn [ 11 ] searches against the uniprotkb / swiss - prot database [ 12 ] and the refseq database [ 13 ] .
annotation of resistance genes , mobile elements , and other features was carried out using the online databases including card [ 14 ] , resfinder [ 15 ] , isfinder [ 16 ] and integrall [ 17 ] .
multiple and pairwise sequence comparisons were performed using muscle 3.8.31 [ 18 ] and blastn , respectively .
gene organization diagrams were drawn in inkscape 0.48.1 ( https :// inkscape.org ) .
detection of carbapenemase activity the activity of class a / b / d carbapenemases in bacterial cell extracts was determined via a modified carba np test [ 19 ] .
overnight bacterial cell cultures in mh broth were diluted 1 : 100 into 3 ml of fresh mh broth , and bacteria were allowed to grow at 37 degreesc with shaking at 200 rpm to reach an od600 of 1.0 to 1.4 .
if required , ampicillin was used at 200 mug / ml. bacterial cells were harvested from 2 ml of the above culture , and washed twice with 20 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.8 ) .
cell pellets were resuspended in 500 mul of 20 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.8 ) , and lysed by sonication , followed by centrifugation at 10,000xg at 4 degreesc for 5 min .
a total of 50 mul of the supernatant ( the enzymatic bacterial suspension ) was separately mixed with 50 mul each of substrates i to v : 50 mul supernatant was added to 50 mul substrate i , then separately 50 mul supernatant was added to 50 mul substrate ii , and so on ; followed by incubation at 37 degreesc for a maximum of 2 h. substrate i : 0.054 % phenol red plus 0.1 mm znso4 ( ph 7.8 ) ; substrate ii : 0.054 % phenol red plus 0.1 mm znso4 ( ph 7.8 ) , and 0.6 mg / mul imipenem ; substrate iii : 0.054 % phenol red plus 0.1 mm znso4 ( ph 7.8 ) , 0.6 mg / mul imipenem , and 0.8 mg / mul tazobactam ; substrate iv : 0.054 % phenol red plus 0.1 mm znso4 ( ph 7.8 ) , 0.6 mg / mul imipenem , and 3 mm edta ( ph 7.8 ) ; substrate v : 0.054 % phenol red plus 0.1 mm znso4 ( ph 7.8 ) , 0.6 mg / mul imipenem , 0.8 mg / mul tazobactam , and 3 mm edta ( ph 7.8 ) .
bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility testing bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the microscan broth dilution method ( microscan , usa ) and interpreted according to clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) guidelines [ 20 ] .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers the sequences of in0 , in1069 , in893 , and in1287 to in1290 were deposited in genbank under accession numbers kp870110 , km589497 , kx434463 , kx371912 , and kx387648 to kx387650 , respectively .

the patient had underlying diabetes , and complained of an infected leg wound .
large doses of vasoactive drugs were needed to maintain his blood pressure , but empirical intravenous antimicrobial administration of teicoplanin plus meropenem was ineffective .
carbapenem - nonsusceptible escherichia coli ec6335 was subsequently isolated from the wound secretions .
the patient was switched to intravenous administration of levofloxacin plus fluconazole based on antimicrobial susceptibility test results .
his symptoms associated with infection progressively improved and he was discharged after 10 days of antimicrobial treatment .
klebsiella pneumoniae kp1262 and escherichia coli ec4212 were isolated from the blood specimens in the infection unit in july 2015 .
both patients complained of suffering high fevers for two to three days , and were diagnosed to have bacteriaemia .
enterobacter cloacae ecl2236 was isolated from the sputum specimens in the respiration medicine unit in january 2014 .
escherichia coli ec7328 was recovered from the urine specimens in the urinary surgery ward in september 2015 .
klebsiella pneumoniae kp5325 was a cultivated from the sputum in the neurosurgery unit in may 2014 .
all of these three patients were treated by intravenous administration of ceftriaxone according to the antimicrobial susceptibility test results , and their symptoms associated with infections were gradually recovered after several days of treatments .
coexistence of in0 and in1069 in escherichia coli ec6335 pcr screening indicated the presence of blakpc and blaimp , but none of the other tested carbapenemase genes blandm , blavim , blaoxa - 23 , blaoxa - 48 , or blaoxa - 58 , in strain ec6335 .
further cloning and sequencing disclosed that ec6335 harbored two novel class 1 integrons : an unusual blakpc - 2 - carrying in0ec6335 and a blaimp - 30 - carrying in1069 .
in0ec6335 and in1069 ( see additional file 2 ) were present in two different bamhi - digested ec6335 dna fragments , which were independently cloned into pmd19 - t and transferred into escherichia coli top10 , generating the escherichia coli transformants in0 - top10 and in1069 - top10 , respectively .
strains in0 - top10 and in1069 - top10 have class a and b carbapenemase activities , respectively , while ec6335 appears to have class a + b activity ( data not shown ) .
all the above strains were resistant to the cephalosporin , carbapenem , and aminoglycoside drugs tested but remained susceptible to the fluoroquinolone drugs tested ( table 2 ) .
ec6335 displayed much higher levels of resistance to cephalosporins / carbapenems than in0 - top10 and in1069 - top10 ( table 2 ) , which was consistent with the fact that ec6335 harbors two carbapenemase genes , blakpc - 2 and blaimp - 30 , while in0 - top10 and in1069 - top10 carry only one gene , blakpc - 2 or blaimp - 30 , respectively .

in0 pvs1 has a weak pcw promoter and an unoccupied atti site with no gene cassettes , thereby representing an ancestor of more complex integrons [ 21 ] .
in0 pvs1 possesses an intact 5 ' - cs , whereas its 3 ' - cs is disrupted by the insertion of is1326 , leading to the truncation of tniabqc of tn402 into tnia - tnibd1 [ 21 ] .
in0 ec6335 contains a strong pch1 promoter and a truncated gcaaca4 ' - 3 composed of incrementaaca4 ' - 3 and attc aaca4 ; a bla kpc - 2 - containing region of tn6296 has been integrated between the pch1 promoter and the truncated gcaaca4 ' - 3 , and located downstream of the gcaaca4 ' - 3 remnant are a bla tem - 1 - containing region of tn6296 and an iskpn27 - containing region from tn6296 ( fig. 1 ) .
aaca4 ' - 3 ( 555 bp in length ; aminoglycoside resistance ) is a derivative of the reference aaca4 gene ( accession number af034958 ) , and encodes the variations asn5thr and leu102ser compared with aaca4 .
the incrementaaca4 ' - 3 gene of in0 ec6335 has a 36 bp deletion at its 5 ' end .
it is most likely that in0 ec6335 originates from a gcaaca4 ' - 3 - carrying integron that has recombined with tn6296 , which is one of the major mobile platforms of bla kpc genes in china [ 22 - 24 ] , and tn3 as a major mobile platform of bla tem - 1 [ 22 - 24 ] .
inferred evolution of in1069 and related integrons in enterobacteriae in1069 carries two gcs , gcbla imp - 30 ( carbapenem resistance ) and gcaaca4 ' - 3 , in this order , and its inti1 gene is truncated because of the connection of is26 at its 3 ' end .
we also determined the sequences of four genetically related integrons , in893 and in1287 to in1290 , from three different enterobacteriaceae species : escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and enterobacter cloacae ( fig. 2 ) .
in1069 and the other four integrons carry pcs and pch1 , which are both strong promoters known to drive gc expression [ 21 ] .
these integrons appear to have conserved 5 ' - cs and 3 ' - cs ( tni of tn402 ) , and possess a core gcaaca4 ' - 3 in which the attc site has an unusual 9 bp deletion ( cccttccat ) ( fig. 2 ) .
five more gcs , including gcbla imp - 30 , gcaada16 ( aminoglycoside resistance ) , gccatb3 ( phenicol resistance ) , gcarr3 , and gcdfra27 ( rifampin resistance ) , are also present in these integrons .
the integration / excision of one or more of these gcs upstream / downstream of the gcaaca4 ' - 3 core generates various organizations of gc arrays , which are mediated by the inti - based , attc - recognizing site - specific recombination system [ 25 ] .
in893 seems to represent the most primitive form of these integrons .
in893 , in1069 , and in1287 carry one or two different resistance markers , while in1288 to in1290 have evolved to capture the determinants for at least three different classes of antibiotics , mostly likely conferring mdr .
these findings provide the insight into stepwise and parallel evolution of in1069 - associated integron variations ( fig. 2 ) .
conclusions excessive use of antibiotics causes the spread of mdr enterobacteriaceae strains in clinical settings , most of which harbor class 1 integrons .
the characterization of novel class 1 integrons in0 , in1069 and in1287 to in1290 denotes a step - by - step and parallel evolution scheme involving massive genetic changes in integron gc arrays under high levels of antibiotic selection pressure in clinical settings .

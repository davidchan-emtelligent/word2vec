we designed a crossover and placebo - controlled trial to investigate the impact of a 1 - h acute vaping session of nicotine - free and flavour - free e - liquid on the pulmonary functions and respiratory mechanics of healthy and asthmatic individuals .
this study shows that a 1 - h vaping session of a high - grade and contaminant - free mixture of propylene glycol and glycerol using a commercially available electronic cigarette performed in a controlled environment does not significantly impact pulmonary functions , respiratory mechanics or symptoms in healthy or asthmatic subjects .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 to the editor , electronic cigarette ( e - cigarette ) use or ' vaping ' has stormed the world over the past years .
it is available everywhere and regardless of age , and is aggressively marketed as a safe way to stop smoking despite a lack of solid evidence .
reality is that we do not know the consequences of vaping on pulmonary health and research is urgently needed to identify potential health hazards .
while most emphasis is placed on nicotine and flavouring agents found in e - liquid , very little scientific knowledge is available on the acute effects of propylene glycol and glycerol inhalation , the two compounds representing the great majority of e - liquid total volume .
we therefore aimed at characterizing the acute effects of inhaling propylene glycol and glycerol on lung functions .
we were also interested to compare potential differences between volunteers with no documented lung disease and volunteers with diagnosed asthma , as the latter are generally more sensitive to pulmonary irritants and bronchoconstrictive stimuli .
we conducted a randomized cross - over , placebo - controlled study on the acute effect of nicotine - free and flavour - free e - cigarette vapor inhalation .
volunteers were aware of using full ( experimental ) or empty ( placebo ) e - cigarettes as no vapors were coming out of the empty placebo device .
the e - liquid consisted of a mixture of 70 % usp - grade propylene glycol ( pg ) and 30 % usp - grade glycerol ( gly ) , mixed in our laboratory under a biosafety cabinet .
this 70 % pg / 30 % gly mixture is largely representative of what is used on the market to dissolve nicotine and / or flavours .
our approach was to create the best - case scenario , where unwanted and possibly harmful contaminants are absent , to specifically investigate the pulmonary effects of pg and gly .
twenty healthy volunteers and ten asthmatic volunteers were recruited for the trial .
healthy volunteers were aged between 20 and 37 years , had no documented lung disease and had normal response to methacholine .
asthmatic volunteers were aged between 21 and 40 years and all had received a diagnosis of asthma and had airway hyperresponsiveness as shown by a positive methacholine challenge .
all volunteers were non - smokers and none were active e - cigarette users .
moreover , none of the volunteers were exposed to secondary tobacco or e - cigarette vapors at home .
all volunteers gave their written informed consent and the iucpq - ul ethics board approved the trial ( reference number 2015 - 2459 21256 ) .
the experimental and placebo sessions took place 1 week apart .
a preceding visit was also planned , where baseline measurements were taken ( i.e. vital signs , lung functions , airway resistance measurements ) , a methacholine challenge was performed according to juniper et al .
[ 1 ] , and volunteers were familiarized with the e - cigarette .
on the following two sessions ( experimental and placebo ) , volunteers were asked to inhale three times per minute , in sitting position , for a total duration of 1 hour .
respiratory mechanics and lung functions were measured by the forced oscillation technique ( tremoflow ) and spirometry , respectively and in that order , immediately before ( t0 ) , immediately after ( t60 ) , and 30 min after ( t90 ) the inhalation sessions .
respiratory symptoms were collected according to the borg perception scale at the same time points as well as every 20 min during the inhalation session .
the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( feno ) and serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) were also measured in asthmatic volunteers .
feno and serum samples were not collected in non - asthmatic volunteers .
all volunteers were able to complete the sessions .
data collected are presented in table 1 .
a few subjects noticed symptoms when using the loaded e - cigarette including cough , chest tightness , and secretions , but no consensual differences in symptoms were noticed in healthy or asthmatic volunteers .
changes in vital signs such as oxygen saturation , heart rate , and breathing frequency were not different between placebo or experimental sessions .
no changes in lung functions were observed using either spirometry or forced oscillation technique .
finally , signs of flaring inflammation , such as increased feno and serum crp levels , were not observed in response to e - cigarette in the asthmatic group .

h inhalation session of a high - grade and contaminant - free mixture of propylene glycol and glycerol using a commercially available e - cigarette performed in a controlled environment does not significantly impact pulmonary function or symptoms in both healthy and asthmatic subjects .
this is consistent with ferrari et al .
[ 2 ] and flouris et al .
[ 3 ] .
the latter showed in healthy individuals that inhalation sessions of 5 or 30 min , respectively , had no significant effects on lung functions measured by spirometry .
an unavoidable limitation of this study and similar studies is that individuals are aware of using the full or empty e - cigarette .
it is simply impossible to blind the individuals since the e - liquid has an off - taste and produces a significant amount of visible vapors .
subjective measures such as symptoms could have been affected by this limitation , but we believe that the objective physiological measures ( i.e. spirometry , forced oscillation technique ) were not affected .
therefore , while acute exposure to e - cigarette vapors does not seem to cause significant functional pulmonary alterations in healthy and asthmatic individuals , there is an urgent need to study the effects of chronic use , especially in more susceptible populations such as teenagers , smokers , and individuals with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .

this study reports the case of an acoustic shock injury ( asi ) , which did not result in a significant hearing loss , but was followed by manifold chronic symptoms both within ( tinnitus , otalgia , tingling in the ear , tension in the ear , and red tympanum ) and outside the ears ( blocked nose , pain in the neck / temporal region ) .
we suggest that these symptoms may result from a loop involving injury to middle ear muscles , peripheral inflammatory processes , activation and sensitization of the trigeminal nerve , the autonomic nervous system , and central feedbacks .
the pathophysiology of this asi is reminiscent of that observed in post - traumatic trigeminal - autonomic cephalalgia .
this framework opens new and promising perspectives on the understanding and medical management of asi .
tinnitus and hyperacousis otalgia pain trigeminal nerve acoustic shock inflammation referred pain centre national de la recherche scientifique10.13039 / 501100004794aix - marseille universite10.13039 / 100007586 introduction acoustic shocks are brief exposure to loud sounds that do not cause substantial hearing loss but can trigger a cluster of debilitating symptoms , i.e. , otalgia , ear fullness , ear tension , tinnitus , sound intolerance , dizziness and head , face or neck aches ( 1 , 2 ) .
in most cases , these symptoms are temporary and disappear within a few hours or days following the acoustic incident .
however , in certain cases , they can become chronic and seriously affect quality of life ( 1 ) .
the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unknown , even though some authors have hypothesized a dysfunction in the tensor tympani muscle ( ttm ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
the patient described here was able to precisely report his symptoms , their temporal evolution , and take pictures of his eardrums over time during symptom severity fluctuations .
the psychoacoustic characteristics of his tinnitus and the functional integrity of the middle ears were also investigated .
this invaluable dataset provides critical insights into the pathophysiology of the acoustic shock injury ( asi ) and beyond , i.e. , tinnitus , hyperacusis , and otalgia .
methods the patient ( nc ) was a 27 - year - old caucasian male working as a general medical practitioner at the time of the acoustic shock .
written informed consent was obtained from the participant for the publication of this case report .
on november 10th 2013 , in a leisure shooting stand , without wearing any hearing protection , he was exposed to a unique and unexpected gunfire at an approximate 7 m distance from his right side .
as bothersome symptoms progressively emerged after this acoustic incident , he attended several ent clinics .
audiograms at week 3 and 7 after asi ( thresholds < 15 dbhl at all tested frequencies from 0.125 to 8 khz ) and all other exams ( tympanometry , blood check , and cerebral mri ) were normal .
later , he was asked to assess the severity of his symptoms , using a 0 - 10 visual analog scale , for each ear several times a day ( from may 1st to may 9th 2015 ) .
the symptoms were tingling , otalgia , ear tension , tinnitus loudness , neck pain / tension , temporal pain / tension , and pain / blocked nose .
he also managed to photograph his eardrums using a video - otoscope ( firefly de500 v1.1 , 4 mm speculum ) .
for analysis purpose , the images were transformed into numeric values estimating the " redness " of the eardrum .
the number of red pixels was normalized according to the eardrum surface captured by the video - otoscope .
in march 2017 , nc visited our laboratory in marseille to assess the psychoacoustic properties of his tinnitus and explored the middle ear function ( multifrequency tympanometer zodiac , otometrics ) .
static admittance was obtained at four frequencies ( 226 , 678 , 800 , and 1,000 hz ) .
admittance variation while the patient voluntarily ( but not forcefully ) eye blinked was investigated over time both at the pressure at which the admittance is maximal and at +/ - 50 dapa from this value .
symptom severity from each ear was analyzed using principal component analysis ( pca ) .
the pca was performed on all symptoms , excluding neck and temporal pain as these symptoms did not affect the left side .
results in regard to the clinical course , immediately after asi , the patient felt a clicking in the right ear and thereafter reported a subjective perception of ear tension and fullness .
at week 2 emerged a bilateral high - pitched fluctuating tinnitus .
these auditory symptoms were associated with an erratic acute pain ( sting or electrical shock ) located deep in either ear .
more than 3 weeks after the acoustic shock , the patient reported additional painful sensations starting around the concha and irradiating to the mid - face ( constriction , blocked nose , and clear nasal discharge ) and to the temporal region or the neck .
interestingly , the laterality and severity of the pain was correlated with the amount of tension perceived in the ipsilateral ( right ) ear .
the psychoacoustic properties of the tinnitus , its amplitude modulation ( tremolo ) , also varied according to the ear tension level. from low to mid tension , the tremolo varied from low frequency (" morse code ") to high frequency (" cricket - like sound ") .
for high tension , tinnitus was described as a high - pitched whistling .
the pitch of this tinnitus was measured at 12 khz and the tremolo , estimated from an amplitude modulated stimulus at the tinnitus frequency , was found at 32 hz ( the severity of ear tension and tinnitus loudness were 4 and 3 , respectively ) .
the loudness of this high - pitched tinnitus is reported in figure 1 .
the patient also reported a low - pitched tinnitus associated with a sensation of fluttering in the ear .
the low - pitched tinnitus was enhanced when something ( earplug , stethoscope ) was inserted in the ear canal .
the high - and low - pitched tinnitus could be absent when the ear was completely relaxed .
in contrast the tinnitus was not modulated by forceful head and neck contractions ( 3 ) .
figure 1 severity of acoustic shock symptoms ( assessed by vas ) as a function of time .
the blue line represents the left ear and the red line represents the right ear .
examples of tympanum pictures are shown at the top ( left images : left ear ; right images : right ear , the vertical lines corresponds to the time at which the pictures were taken ) .
the temporal evolution of symptoms severity ( figure 1 ) was investigated using pca .
the first principal component ( 48 % of the total variance ) represents the severity of the symptoms and does not discriminate between them .
on the other hand , the second principal component ( 18 % of the total variance ) separates two symptom clusters , namely " tension ," " blocked nose ," and " tympanum redness " for symptom cluster 1 and " tingling ," " tinnitus ," and " otalgia " for symptom cluster 2 ( figure 2 , upper panels ) .
the feeling of pain in the temporal region and the neck ( plotted on the first two pca axes ) represent a third group of symptoms ( symptom cluster 3 ) , different from cluster 1 and 2 .
the symptom cluster 3 is reported in the right side only , is moderate in severity , and is present only occasionally compared to the other symptoms .
the pca indicates that the correlation between symptom cluster 3 and both symptom cluster 1 and 2 is low .
figure 2 ( middle panels ) shows the multi - dimensional data ( symptom severity ) plotted on the new coordinate system defined by the first two principal components at each time point .
the symptoms are usually more severe in the right ear than in the left ear , and the maximum severity is also greater in the right ear .
interestingly , the two symptom clusters are reported in the right ear , while only symptom cluster 1 is reported in the left ear .
the temporal dynamics of symptom severity ( first principal component ) in the left and right ear ( figure 2 , bottom panel ) is also clearly anti - correlated across the two ears .
figure 2 results obtained from the principal component analysis ( pca ) .
the upper left panel represents each symptom as a function of the first two principal components derived from the pca .
the upper right panel shows the percentage of variance explained by the different principal components .
the middle panels ( left : left ear , right : right ear ) show the symptoms plotted at each time point as a function the first two principal components .
the bottom panel shows the first principal component for each ear ( blue line : left ear , red line : right ear ) as a function of time .
the sensation of tension in the ear was associated with tympanum hyperemia ( figure 1 , also see video s1 in supplementary material ) .
this hyperemia was also present during jaw muscle contraction ( hypothetically involving the mylohyoid muscle ) and was associated with an increase of the high - pitch tinnitus ( see video s2 in supplementary material ) .
this phenomenon was reported to be only present when the sensation of tension in the ear was high and coincidentally , the tympanum was always showing dilated vessels .
the tympanometry measurements demonstrated different middle ear function for the two ears ( figure 3 ) .
indeed , for the right ear , the static admittance was larger ( figure 3 , upper panel ) and the resonant frequency ( estimated from the frequency at which the susceptance is null ) was abnormally low (< 678 hz ) ( figure 3 , middle panel ) .
moreover , the admittance was modulated by eyelid closure , especially in the right ear ( figure 3 , bottom panel ) .
finally , the stapedial reflexes were present and clinically normal in both ears at 500 hz and 4 khz at 95 - 100 db hl. figure 3 results obtained by tympanometry measurements .
the upper panel shows the static admittance for the two ears obtained for a 226 hz probe .
the middle panel shows the susceptance as a function of the conductance at four frequencies of probe tone stimulation ( 226 , 678 , 800 , and 1,000 hz ) .
the bottom panel shows the admittance variation when the patient blinked voluntarily ( but not forcefully ) his eyes .
the patient was asked to do so every 5 s ( blue line : left ear , red line : right ear ) .
discussion this report completes and adds to previous studies on acoustic shock ( 1 ) .
first , the symptoms reported after the acoustic shock , including their temporal dynamics and characteristics , have been described both qualitatively and quantitatively .
this case reports all the symptoms that are commonly described after asi , except vertigo and / or dizziness ( 1 ) , and additional symptoms ( nasal congestion , rhinorrhea , and tympanum hyperemia ) .
second , the functional integrity of the middle ears was also investigated using multifrequency tympanometry and direct examination of the eardrums .
our findings provide further insights into the mechanisms involved in asi , and in particular they question and extend the framework previously developed by others ( 1 , 2 ) .
this study is the first to provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles ( mem ) can behave abnormally after asi .
indeed , middle ear admittance is changed by simple eyelid closure , eardrum movements in the right ear can be large enough to be visible by the naked eye and the fluttering sensation ( likely accompanying mem contraction ) is enhanced by cutaneous stimulation of the ear canal ( 4 - 7 ) .
this abnormal behavior of mem may result from a dysfunction and / or injury of mem caused by an exaggerated contraction in response to the acoustic incident .
while stapedius muscle contraction is activated by loud sounds , ttm contraction can be triggered by unexpected sounds through the general startle reflex ( 8 ) .
the low resonant frequency and large admittance in the most symptomatic ( right ) ear may reflect an abnormal ossicle arrangement , possibly caused by the exaggerated contraction of the mem .
the sensation of tension in the ear reported immediately after the acoustic shock may result from an abnormal contraction of the mem signaled by the muscle spindles ( 9 ) and tympanum mechanoreceptors due to eardrum deformation ( 10 ) .
the traumatic acoustic episode may lead to anxiety and sensory hypersensitivity , which may in turn reduce the startle reflex threshold and / or potentiate the startle reflex ( 11 ) , possibly through a descending serotoninergic innervation ( 12 ) .
this central feedback may facilitate tonic and phasic ttm contraction .
the putative exaggerated contraction of the mem , eventually followed by tonic contraction , may be associated with mem injury and inflammatory processes .
in particular , the ttm is innervated by fibers containing substance p and calcitonin gene - related peptide , which may play a key role in the noise - induced inflammation of the middle ear ( 13 - 15 ) .
inflammation can then diffuse from the mem to the tympanum and middle ear mucosa and can even become neurogenic as these tissues are rich in mastocytes ( 16 - 18 ) .
the diverse pain feelings in the ear ( otalgia and tingling ) likely result from middle ear inflammation and activation of the trigeminal nerve ( tgn ) , which innervates the middle ear mucosa , the eardrum , and the ttm ( 15 , 19 ) .
intriguingly , tinnitus loudness is correlated to the severity of otalgia and tingling in the ear , suggesting that middle ear inflammation plays a role in tinnitus generation and / or severity .
one can propose that antidromic activation of the tgn may change the vascular permeability of the blood vessels in the stria vascularis ( 20 ) , which may eventually increase the endocochlear potential and produce tinnitus .
the mem dysfunction / injury and the chronic inflammatory processes following asi may be associated with neural hyperactivity in the trigeminal pathways .
this neural hyperactivity may in turn lead to plastic changes ( sensitization ) at several levels of the trigeminal pathways ( 21 ) .
pain in the neck and the temporal region may result from referred pain as a consequence of central sensitization , possibly at the trigemino - cervical complex ( tcc ) level where multimodal neurons are present ( 22 ) .
sensitization may also contribute to shift the pathophysiology from acute to chronic ( 21 ) .
finally , the pca suggests that the symptoms from cluster 1 originate from tightly coupled mechanisms .
the trigeminal sensory inputs from regions of the head , including middle ear mucosa , eardrums , and the ttm ( 14 , 15 , 19 ) , are collected by the tcc that has a reflex connection with the superior salivatory nucleus ( ssn ) .
interestingly , the ssn provides a parasympathetic innervation to the head region via the sphenopalatine ganglion .
this reflex loop between the tgn and the parasympathetic pathway of the head has been suggested to account for the autonomic symptoms associated with trigeminal - autonomic cephalalgia ( tac ) ( 23 ) .
the activation of the trigeminal - autonomic reflex in this case may account for the nasal congestion , rhinorrhea , and the tympanic hyperemia .
the autonomic nervous system , which innervates the middle ear ( 18 , 24 - 26 ) , may also contribute to enhance the mem tonus and the feeling of tension and aural fullness ( 27 ) .
in summary , this case suggests that a complex pathophysiology can be involved in asi .
initially , the acoustic shock may trigger an exaggerated mem response causing muscle dysfunction / injury and inflammatory processes , which may later diffuse to the tympanum and middle ear mucosa .
the activation of the trigeminal pathways due to inflammation may account for the diverse pain feelings in the ear and tinnitus ( symptom cluster 2 ) and also for referred pain in the neck and the temporal region ( symptom cluster 3 ) after induction of central sensitization .
finally , nasal congestion and tympanum hyperemia , which are tightly coupled to the feeling of ear tension ( symptom cluster 1 ) , may result from the activation of a trigeminal - autonomic reflex .
interestingly , the pathophysiology of asi is strongly reminiscent of that of post - traumatic tac ( 28 ) .
in this context , the case reported here may define a new clinical entity that we suggest calling post - traumatic trigeminal - autonomic otalgia .
the clinical picture presented here , i.e. , with numerous , diverse , and severe symptoms , could be an extreme form of this clinical entity and may be relatively rare .
however , the prevalence of this clinical entity may be more prevalent than expected at first sight , as less symptomatic forms may also exist .
many patients with tinnitus and / or hyperacusis report one or more additional symptoms such as ear fullness , otalgia , tympanic flutter , and / or pain in the neck ( 2 ) .
this framework opens new and promising perspectives on the understanding and medical management of asi and beyond , i.e. , tinnitus and hyperacusis ( 23 ) .

antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates for anti - infective pharmaceuticals .
unfortunately , because of their low proteolytic and chemical stability , their usage is generally narrowed down to topical formulations .
until now , numerous approaches to increase peptide stability have been proposed .
one of them , peptide hydrocarbon stapling , a modification based on stabilizing peptide secondary structure with a side - chain covalent hydrocarbon bridge , have been successfully applied to many peptides .
moreover , constraining secondary structure of peptides have also been proven to increase their biological activity .
this review article describes studies on hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides with respect to improved drug - like properties .
keywords antimicrobial peptides stapled peptides antimicrobial agents hydrocarbon stapled peptide drugs antibiotics issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media , llc , part of springer nature 2018 introduction increasing resistance to antibiotics among microorganisms is a serious threat for human health .
according to the review on antimicrobial resistance , by the year 2050 nearly ten million annual deaths will be caused by antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections [ 1 ] .
nevertheless , only seven new antibiotics were approved by fda within the past 10 years .
in comparison , some 30 years ago about four new antibiotics were introduced each year .
current unsatisfactory situation is a result of complex processes .
undoubtedly , it is associated with a worldwide overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals resulting in selection of drug - resistant strains [ 2 ] .
another crucial aspect is a shift of interest of pharmaceutical industry from antibiotic development to much more profitable chronic disease medications [ 3 ] .
in view of those facts it is essential to develop effective antimicrobials with novel modes of action to overcome microbial resistance .
antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) are compounds widely distributed in nature , e.g. bacteriocins , or as components of innate immunity .
generally , they are small up to medium - size (< 10 kda ) , amphipathic molecules with a substantial portion (>= 30 %) of hydrophobic residues and an overall positive charge [ 4 , 5 ] .
hence , amps interact electrostatically with the negatively charged microbial surface , penetrate into its membrane lipids usually adopting a specific secondary structure and permeabilize it. this ultimately leads to membrane disruption and bacterial cell death .
depending on the mechanism of action three main models of amps antimicrobial activity , barrel - stave , toroidal pore , and carpet - like , have been proposed .
under the barrel - stave model peptides form a pore in the bacterial membrane to which they are oriented perpendicularly .
hydrophobic face of helical peptide is directed towards the membrane and hydrophilic face towards the center of newly formed pore .
according to toroidal model pore is formed as a result of peptide - induced lipid bilayer bending .
in this case pore line is formed not only by peptides , but also lipid head groups .
lastly , carpet - like or detergent - like model is based on peptide accumulation parallel to membrane surface .
when critical concentration of surface accumulated peptide is exceeded , membrane structure is altered , leading ultimately to membrane disruption .
furthermore , amps can exert antimicrobial effects via other mechanisms such as inhibition of cell wall synthesis , inhibition of nucleic acid and protein synthesis , or induction of apoptosis / necrosis [ 6 ] .
interestingly , for several amps an antimicrobial mechanism based purely on microbial process inhibition , with no membrane disruption have been observed .
hypothetically , those amps with cell penetrating peptide ( cpp ) properties may provide a new delivery systems for known drugs [ 7 , 8 ] .
amps display activity against broad - spectrum of pathogens such as gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , fungi , parasites , and viruses [ 9 ] .
as a result , they provide an interesting alternative for conventional antibiotics [ 10 ] .
at the moment , several antimicrobial peptides are under clinical trials .
one of those is pexiganan - - a 22 - amino acid residue analog of magainin in the form of 0.8 % cream , which is in phase iii clinical trials for patients with diabetic foot ulcers .
another example is an aqueous topical gel containing omiganan - - a 12 - amino acid residue analog of indolicidin .
omiganan is also in phase iii clinical trials for rosacea [ 11 ] .
nevertheless , peptides have some limitations for practical use .
first of all , amps are prone to enzymatic degradation .
this drawback is particularly frequent in case of peptides characterized by flexible conformation in which vulnerable groups are exposed to protease action .
moreover , unsuitable temperature or ph may also negatively affect peptide stability .
as a result , amps suffer from poor bioavailability and their clinical use is essentially limited to topical formulations .
additionally , environmental conditions ( for example : high / low salt concentration or ph ) may have a significant impact on peptide secondary structure , and consequently antimicrobial activity [ 12 , 13 ] .
therefore , modification of amps to enhance their stability and antimicrobial activity is mandatory [ 14 ] .
nowadays , many approaches have been proposed to improve serum stability and to increase antimicrobial activity [ 15 - 17 ] , inter alia , d - amino acid substitution [ 18 ] or other non - ribosomal amino acid substitution [ 19 ] , pegylation [ 20 ] , lipidization [ 21 ] , and dimerization [ 22 ] .
another amp design approach is peptide stapling .
this modification is generally based on formation of a covalent bridge between side - chains .
in effect , the peptide is partially protected from enzymatic degradation and its active conformation is stabilized .
therefore , stapled peptide has potentially greater drug - like properties than the parent molecule .
according to the bridge chemistry , we can distinguish , among others , hydrocarbon , triazole , azobenzene , thiol - based , lactam , hydrazine , and thioether stapling .
each stapling type may cause different effect on peptide stability and bioactivity [ 23 ] .
staples have to connect two side chains located on the same face of the helix to stabilize peptide secondary structure ( fig. 1 ) .
in practice these two residues need to be located at i and i + 3 , i + 4 ( one - loop staple ) , i + 7 ( two - loop staple ) , or i + 11 ( three - loop staple ) positions since alpha - helix has 3.6 residues per turn .
moreover , introduction of two staples (' stitched peptides ') may enhance protease resistance , improve pharmacokinetic properties and biological activities [ 24 ]. fig. 1 exemplary locations of staples in helical peptide stapled peptides have found application in numerous scientific areas .
many intracellular molecular targets , such as interacting proteins or transcription factors , formerly thought to be " undruggable " , have been effectively inhibited by stapled peptides .
this state of affairs was due to the fact that binding interfaces of helical protein fragments are usually too large to be effectively disrupted by small molecules .
on the other hand , the binding site is unreachable for biological drugs .
stapling techniques opened a window of opportunity for peptides to overcome those limitations .
moreover , stapled peptides were also applied as receptor agonists / antagonists , enzyme or efflux pump inhibitors , and as agents enhancing cholesterol efflux [ 25 ] .
undoubtedly , desirable activity and stability are crucial features of antimicrobial peptides .
therefore , several scientific teams undertook the subject of constraining amps alpha - helical structure .
this review focuses on the latest achievements in the development of hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides .
the article presents some aspects of design and synthesis of the peptides as well as their effects on overall biological activity , stability , and structure .
hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides hydrocarbon stapling technique hydrocarbon stapled peptides were first introduced by schafmeister et al. in 2000 .
several unnatural calpha - methylated amino acids with either r or s absolute configuration at calpha position and olefinic side chain of different lengths were designed to be integrated into rnase a in order to single out the most suitable ones for stapling .
their study has shown that ri , i + 7s with 11 - carbon cross - link was the most efficient approach to stabilize alpha - helical structure and enhance stability towards trypsin enzymatic degradation .
moreover , alpha - methylation of particular amino acids provided additional , beside the hydrocarbon bridge , so - called helix - stabilization effect [ 26 ] .
since then , hydrocarbon stapling has become the most popular stapling technique with several compounds of therapeutic potential in areas of oncology , diabetes , cardiology , and hiv therapy [ 27 , 28 ] .
generally , hydrocarbon stapling is performed through incorporation of two calpha - methyl , calpha - alkenyl amino acid residues during standard solid - phase peptide synthesis with subsequent ruthenium - catalyzed metathesis macrocyclization reaction of the resin - bound peptide ( fig. 2 ) .
up to date , several ring - closing metathesis catalysts have been developed and applied to peptide hydrocarbon stapling .
however , the most commonly used catalyst , are still those introduced by grubbs and coworkers ( for example grubbs' first generation catalyst presented in fig. 2 ) .
additionally , due to the fact that conventional metathesis catalyst are water - insoluble , a growing interest in water - soluble derivatives is observed [ 29 - 32 ] .
as helix stabilization of a given stapling depends notably on absolute configuration at calpha position and staple length , these features have been exhaustively studied .
a brief summary in table 1 presents optimal parameters for a helix stabilization. fig. 2 schematic presentation of hydrocarbon stapling of pxeptxide peptide using a ruthenium - catalyzed ring closing metathesis ( x stands for calpha - methyl , calpha - alkenyl amino acid residue ) .

two main approaches are applied to obtain double - stapled peptides .
longer peptides are stapled either with two independent staples ( fig. 3a ) or with the use of 2,2 - bis ( 4 - pentenyl ) glycine to form a spiro - bicyclic ring connection in i , i + 4 , i + 4 + 7 manner ( fig. 3b ) [ 23 - 25 , 33 , 34 ]. fig. 3 exemplary locations of staples in double - stapled peptide a peptide stapled with two independent staples , b peptide stapled in a i , i + 4 , i + 4 + 7 manner in fact , there is a variety of stapled peptide building blocks .
these unusual amino acids can be divided into three groups : glycine derivatives , alanine derivatives , and derivatives with two alkenyl moieties .
examples of building blocks are presented in table 2 .

chapuis et al. designed single - and double - stapled analogs of two alpha - helical peptides of wild bee venom , lasiglossin iii ( ll - iii ) and melectin ( mep ) .
to maintain lysine - based hydrophilic domain , several different staples were incorporated along the hydrophobic face of alpha - helix for both peptides ( table 3 ) .
three different hydrocarbon stapling approaches were chosen : single si , i + 4s with 8 - carbon cross - link , single ri , i + 7s with 11 - carbon cross - link or two si , i + 4s with 8 - carbon cross - links .
staple incorporation generally increased helicity in water and proteolytic stability of peptides .
simultaneously this modification resulted in a suppressed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and candida albicans .
the authors attributed this to the reduced peptide flexibility .
moreover , stapled analogs were more hemolytic than original molecules .
as a result , hydrocarbon stapling of ll - iii and mep did not improve their pharmacological qualities [ 35 ] .

in the first one , pham et al. designed stapled analogs of esculentin - 2em ( e2em ) , a 37 - residue antimicrobial peptide isolated from korean frog ( glandirama emeljanovi ) .
a single i , i + 4 hydrocarbon staple was incorporated into e2em15w , a 15 - amino acid fragment of e2em with aspartic acid residue substituted with tryptophan ( table 3 ) .
additionally , to examine the influence of tryptophan residue on peptide - membrane interaction , two stapled analogs differing in tryptophan residue position were analyzed .
all stapled peptides used in this study showed a significant increase in antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus as compared to the unstapled e2em15w .
minimal inhibitory concentration for the stapled peptides was in the range of 3.13 - 6.25 microg / ml for both strains , whereas for unstapled peptide it was 200 microg / ml for b. subtilis and 100 microg / ml for s. aureus .
on the other hand , both the stapled and unstapled peptides did not show any substantial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and gram - negative strains .
oct - 4 - enyl stapling maintained peptide helicity despite shortening of its length and what is more , enhanced proteolytic stability as compared to that of e2em [ 36 ] .
dinh et al. applied hydrocarbon stapling to short amps to increase their helicity and antimicrobial activity .
six de novo designed , stapled , n - capped heptapeptides and their unstapled counterparts ( table 3 ) were subjected to antimicrobial , hemolysis and circular dichroism ( cd ) assays .
cd spectroscopy demonstrated an increased helicity of the stapled peptides .
furthermore , a close correlation between helicity and antimicrobial activity was observed : in most cases stapling enhanced antimicrobial potential .
in fact , the designed peptides caused little or no hemolysis .
nevertheless , in case of two stapled peptides , s3 and s4 , the most potent antimicrobials in this study , hemolytic activity was slightly enhanced .
this phenomenon was explained in terms of a staple - derived stabilization of the helix structure and increased molecule hydrophobicity [ 37 ] .
the study was followed - up with another article in which dinh et al. examined the effect of n - acetylation of the previously described stapled heptapeptides on biological activity .
the authors hypothesized that an increase in peptide positive net charge , as a result of removal of n - terminal capping , could contribute to their antimicrobial activity .
moreover , n - acetyl capping is also known for its helix stabilization properties , and thus removing it may destabilize peptide secondary structure and as a result reduce antimicrobial activity .
the authors prepared 4 analogs with an n - terminal free amino moiety ( table 3 ) to learn if the hydrocarbon staple would be an effective standalone helix - stabilizing factor .
only in the case of s3 , deacetylation proved to be an advantageous modification .
the deacetylated analog maintained helicity , exhibited greater antimicrobial activity , and even lowered hemolysis [ 38 ] .
a study on short stapled amps was reported by luong et al. peptide s3 was further modified to improve its pharmacological properties .
on the basis of previous studies on helix stabilization with two hydrocarbon bridges , the authors designed a series of dimeric s3 analogs with various linkers ( table 4 ) .
usually helix - breaking amino acid residues in the middle of the helical antimicrobial peptide sequence contribute to their low hemolytic activity .
hence glycine and proline were used as linkers .
furthermore , the authors theorized that usage of longer linkers may lead to peptide folding through interaction of hydrophobic faces and thus increase peptide solubility and help to avoid aggregation .
to verify this hypothesis , gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and beta - alanine were applied as linkers .
in general , dimerization did not cause any significant increase in helicity .
although peptide dimers exhibited increased antimicrobial and hemolytic activities , they were different for each linker .
peptide 3pr3 - x showed the highest selectivity index .
the results demonstrate that linker flexibility plays a key role in differentiation between hemolytic and antimicrobial activity in doubly - stapled antimicrobial peptide dimers [ 39 ] .

all studied stapled peptides have been shown to adopt alpha - helical secondary structure .
moreover , stapled peptides with fifth amino acid residue substituted by aliphatic amino acid ( leucine , isoleucine , norleucine or valine ) were more helical than those substituted by aromatic amino acid residues ( phenylalanine or tryptophan ) .
generally , an increase in side chain hydrophobicity of the fifth amino acid residue resulted in an overall enhancement in antimicrobial and hemolytic activity ( in comparison to that of peptide ala ) .
interestingly , although peptide lys exhibited lower antimicrobial activity than peptide ala against most strains , it demonstrated the strongest antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa .
consequently , peptide lys seems to be a suitable starting point for further development of a selective antibiotic drug .
additionally , the most potent analog , nle , was subjected to trypsin digestion and it exhibited nearly 16 - fold increased stability compared to its unstapled analog [ 40 ] .
another implementation of hydrocarbon staple into known antimicrobial peptide as a mean to increase its drug - like properties was described by luong et al. a single i , i + 4 hydrocarbon staple was incorporated into polybia - mp1 , a 14 - amino acid reside antimicrobial peptide originally isolated from the social wasp ( polybia paulista ) venom .
molecules were compared based on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities , secondary structure and proteolytic stability .
additionally , in order to increase peptide net charge , thus possibly increase antimicrobial activity , two stapled analogs with appropriate amino acid substitutions ( mp1s - d8n and mp1s - q12k ) were also synthesized ( table 4 ) .
stapling in case of all compounds increased helicity , with mps1 exhibiting the highest value ( 96 % , 3.7 - fold higher than that of mp1 ) .
furthermore , peptide stapling affected peptide resilience against tryptic digestion .
mp1s - q12k was characterized by nearly 69 - fold greater stability during proteolytic assay , as compared to mp1 ( t1 / 2 was 1446 and 21 min , respectively ) .
interestingly , analogs were characterized by increased antimicrobial activity only against gram - positive bacteria : b. subtilis , s. aureus ( mp1s , mp1s - d8n and mp1s - q12k ) , and s. epidermidis ( mp1s - d8n and mp1s - q12k ) .
as predicted , increasing peptide net charge through substituting asparaginate residue with asparagine , or glutamine residue with lysine , led to increase in antimicrobial activity .
however , those modifications and / or incorporation of hydrocarbon staple significantly increased hemolytic activity of studied peptides [ 41 ] .
dinh et al. examined application of double - stapling in antimicrobial peptides .
peptides containing lysine , alanine , tryptophan , and two i , i + 4 staples were designed ( table 4 ) .
in this case , staples provide a helical structure and a well - defined hydrophobic face .
additionally , to examine the influence of various factors on peptide biological activity and secondary structure , several variants differing in n - terminal modification and position of tryptophan residue were also synthesized .
antimicrobial activity , hemolysis , helicity , and proteolytic stability of double - , single - , and unstapled peptides were compared in one study .
all stapled peptides adopted helical conformation .
however , a double - stapled peptide ( ac - ds - 14w ) had the highest helical content .
furthermore , the ac - ds - 14w exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than its unstapled counterpart .
among studied compounds , single - stapled peptides were more active against gram - negative bacteria than the double - stapled .
contrarily , in case of gram - positive bacteria , double - stapled peptides were more active .
according to previous studies , hydrocarbon stapled peptides exhibited increased hemolytic activity .
however , different positioning of the tryptophan residue and n - terminal capping moiety resulted in h - ds - 5w - - a double - stapled peptide effective against both bacterial groups and with decreased hemolytic activity .
on this basis , a hypothesis has been put forward that structure of hydrocarbon linker is related to peptide selectivity .
generally , single - stapled analogs were more resistant to trypsin digestion than their unstapled counterparts .
moreover , the double - stapled peptide , ac - ds - 14w , exhibited even higher stability to digestion .
in fact , more than 85 % of ac - ds - 14w remained intact after 60 min of trypsin digestion , whereas single - stapled and unstapled counterparts were completely digested .
overall , in contrast to chapuis et al. , this study demonstrates that double - stapling , as far as appropriate sequences are applied , may improve peptide pharmacological properties [ 35 , 42 ] .
another intriguing aspect of hydrocarbon stapling is application of this method into lipopeptides .
this approach was applied by jenner et al. into de novo designed lipopeptides ( table 4 ) .
generally , the molecules were highly amphiphilic due to the hydrophobic n - terminus ( with fatty acid and several tryptophan residues ) and hydrophilic amidated c - terminus ( with several arginine residues ) .
a single i , i + 4 hydrocarbon staple was implemented .
antimicrobial and hemolytic activity , secondary structure , and membrane permeabilization properties of the stapled lipopeptides and their unstapled counterparts were analyzed .
moreover , relevance of arginine residue inside the macrocycle was evaluated .
although stapling did not stabilize secondary structure , it increased antibacterial activity and membrane permeabilization .
the authors assumed that this outcome was due to the restriction of conformations available to the stapled peptide .
another proposed cause is an increased proteolytic stability and , in consequence , longer duration of action .
as in the previously described studies , staple incorporation increased hemolytic potential of the analogs .
moreover , val - hslp exhibited lower hemolysis than cap - hslp .
while the authors explained this lower activity with presence of arginine residue inside of the macrocycle , it could also be an outcome of a shorter fatty acid ( val ) at n - terminus .
interestingly , stapled analogs exhibited lower antimicrobial activity against candida strains in comparison to that of the original counterpart lp - 1 .
no activity against escherichia coli strain of either the stapled and unstapled peptides was detected [ 43 ] .
stone et al. studied influence of single i , i + 4 hydrocarbon staple on the 6k - f17 peptide , a 17 - residue , de novo designed amp ( table 4 ) .
similarly to aforementioned lipopeptides , sequence of 6k - f17 was characterized by occurrence of two regions differing in their hydrophobicity .
conversely , in this case n - terminus was positively charged due to several lysine residues and c - terminus was hydrophobic as a result of alanine , phenylalanine , and tryptophan residue clustering .
stapled 6k - f17 ( s - 6k - f17 ) and its unstapled counterpart were compared regarding their secondary structure , peptide - membrane interactions , mechanism of action , and antimicrobial and hemolytic activities .
although staple implementation slightly increased antimicrobial activity , a meaningful increase in hemolytic activity was observed .
in order to diminish this undesirable feature , three additional stapled analogs with hydrophobic amino acid residues substituted with glycine and / or asparagine were also synthesized .
each subsequent substitution led to decrease in hemolytic activity of stapled peptides , with s - 6k - f17 - 3gn being characterized by highest therapeutic index .
in contrast to majority of described hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides , stapling of 6k - f17 did not result in molecule with significantly increased helicity in aqueous buffer .
additionally , no increase in peptide helicity was observed in sds micelles .
on the other hand , s - 6k - f17 exhibited stronger helical character in bilayers composed of e. coli lipids than its unstapled counterpart .
authors explained this phenomenon as a result of more rigid and less negatively charged surface of e. coli lipid bilayer when compared to sds micelles .
interestingly , a significant decrease of helical content in case of glycine / asparagine substituted analogs was observed .
adoption of helical structure in the presence of membrane , however , might not be a sine qua non condition for antimicrobial activity , as it remained at approximately the same level for both stapled and unstapled analogs .
furthermore , s - 6k - f17 was characterized by greater depth of tryptophan residue penetration into both sds micelles and e. coli lipid bilayers when compared to its unstapled parent molecule .
on the other hand , substituting s - 6k - f17 hydrophobic residues with glycine and / or asparagine residues resulted in molecules with diminished tryptophan burial .
finally , nmr studies revealed that both unstapled and s - 6k - f17 - 3gn peptides , despite exhibiting significant differences regarding secondary structure and tryptophan burial , selectively bind to bacterial membranes [ 44 ] .
hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides - - a patent review in 2017 the dana - farber cancer institute , inc .
patented 16 staple - modified antimicrobial peptides and their derivatives ( table 5 ) .
the patent contains a list of stapled peptides and their chemical structures .
furthermore , the authors described pharmaceutically acceptable salts , pharmaceutical compositions , treatment of bacterial infection ( bacteria and bacterial biofilm - related ) , and methods of killing or inhibiting bacterial growth .
as an example of their invention , the authors presented multiple stapled - peptide development approaches .
firstly , they synthesized several pexiganan and magainin ii stapled analogs .
in general , hydrocarbon stapling increase peptides helicity , enhance antimicrobial and hemolytic activity .
basing on the fact that hemolytic activity is usually related to peptide hydrophobicity , the authors modified a staple of pexiganan analog through sharpless dihydroxylation reaction .
antimicrobial activity of the hydroxylated analogs was preserved , however , lytic activity against red blood cells ( rbc ) was slightly reduced .
although diol derivatization was not completely satisfactory , it endorsed hypothesis that hemolysis was related to the peptide hydrophobicity .
to enhance hydrophilicity the authors modified the staple by additional positive point charge through sharpless aminohydroxylation ( oxyamination ) .
unfortunately , no data about biological activity was presented .
in the next example of the invention , the authors described principles for designing stapled amps with selectivity for bacterial membrane .
peptide library based on magainin ii i , i + 4 and i , i + 7 staple screening was synthesized .
generally , implementing staple in both manners increased antimicrobial activity ; however , the i , i + 7 analogs were more active against bacteria and rbc .
nevertheless , i , i + 4 analogs exhibited different pattern of hemolysis dependent on the insertion site of the staple .
generally , the i , i + 4 analogs in which hydrophobic patch discontinuity was preserved provided better membrane selectivity .
then , a stapled analog with the highest selectivity index , mag ( i + 4 ) 15 , was further modified by moving positive and negative charged residues along the peptide backbone .
in principle , substitution of amino acid residue with lysine resulted in an analog with a decreased hemolytic activity .
importantly , antimicrobial activity of the analogs was dependent on substituted position .
moreover , activity against gram - positive bacteria was decreased more frequently than against gram - negative bacteria .
similarly to lysine scanning , glutamic acid scanning also provided analogs with a lower hemolytic activity .
however , antimicrobial activity was also reduced in nearly all cases .
additionally , to evaluate the influence of positive charge intensity on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity , several histidine substituted analogs were also synthesized .
generally , substitution with histidine resulted in compounds with an increased antimicrobial activity and lower lytic activity against rbc in comparison to those of the lysine substituted counterparts .
thereafter , impact of helix promoting ( alanine and 2 - aminoisobutyric acid ) and disrupting residues ( proline , 4 - hydroxyproline , d - alanine and d - lysine ) on stapled peptide mag ( i + 4 ) 15 activity was examined .
both helix promoting residues increased antimicrobial and hemolytic activity .
in contrast , substitution by proline , 4 - hydroxyproline and d - lysine resulted in a decrease in both of these activities .
d - alanine proved to be the most suitable residue to modify the peptide due to the increased antimicrobial activity and decreased hemolysis .
based on the results , the authors designed double - stapled analogs .
one of the compounds , mag ( i + 4 ) 2,15 ( i2k , a9h ) , exhibited similar antimicrobial activity to that of the mag ( i + 4 ) 15 , however , with nearly eliminated hemolytic activity .
finally , the authors applied stapled peptide approach to pleurocidin .
as a result , a stapled peptide , pleu ( i + 4 ) 1,15 ( a9k ) , with an increased antimicrobial activity and relatively low hemolytic activity was obtained [ 45 ] .

generally , i - tamps are subclass of amps which exhibit their antimicrobial activity through membrane translocation with subsequent microbial process inhibition , in opposition to regular microbial cell membrane disruption .
as a part of document , 13 further stapled - derived antimicrobial peptides , their formulations , modifications and applications as antimicrobial drugs were described .
additionally , due to i - tamps ability to penetrate microbial membranes , a concept of connecting them with conventional antibiotics in order to : ( i ) overcome treatment resistance , ( ii ) provide new delivery system for previously ineffective antibiotics or ( iii ) improve selectivity of toxic molecules towards bacteria , was described .
as an example of their invention authors applied peptide stapling to buforin ii , a 21 - amino acid residue histone - derived amps , first isolated from stomach of asian toad ( bufo bufo gargarizans ) .
in order to identify the most pharmacologically efficient staple position , an i , i + 4 and i , i + 7 staple scanning was conducted for buforin ii. obtained analogs were characterized by their antimicrobial activity against e. coli , hemolytic activity and helicity .
overall , peptide stapling increased buforin ii helicity , with i , i + 7 analogs being characterized by greater alpha - helical content than their i , i + 4 counterparts .
similar tendency was observed for hemolysis , where i , i + 7 analogs exhibited higher hemolytic activity when compared to i , i + 4 derivatives .
two of synthesized analogs , i.e. bfstap ( i + 4 ) 7 and bfstap ( i + 4 ) 11 , showed a significant increase in antimicrobial activity ( nearly 200 - fold in comparison to buforin ii ) , while maintaining their hemolytic activity at level comparable to unstapled counterpart [ 46 ] .
conclusions antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections are becoming a serious threat for mankind .
hence , there is an urgent need to develop new , efficient drugs being an alternative to conventional antibiotics [ 47 ] .
peptide stapling emerged as a promising modification for future peptide drug candidates .
until now , two stapled therapeutics , alrn - 6924 , a dual inhibitor of mdm2 / mdmx - p53 interaction , and alrn - 5281 , a growth hormone - releasing hormone inhibitor , both developed by aileron therapeutics , inc. , have been under clinical trials [ 48 ] .
over the past years , many different stapled peptides have been developed to be potentially useful in cancer treatment and other pathological diseases [ 27 ] .
hydrocarbon stapled amps appear to be a promising class of anti - infective agents , mainly because of their possible selective activity against bacteria and low incidence of developing resistance .
importantly , it may also increase antimicrobial activity and peptide helicity .
unfortunately , stapling frequently leads to enhanced hemolysis .
this phenomenon is presumably a result of an increased hydrophobicity derived from incorporated staple .
because of that , hydrocarbon stapling alone might be insufficient to provide drug - like properties .
however , further peptide modifications such as addition of point charges into stapled peptide sequence ( for example through substitution of hydrophobic amino acid residue by lysine residue ) or insertion of helix - disrupting residues may result in a satisfactory antimicrobial activity and low activity against rbc .
additionally , antimicrobial peptide stapling , due to increased resistance to enzymatic and chemical degradation , sheds the green light to novel routes of administration .
intravenous injection of stapled amps with selectivity for bacterial cells , could greatly facilitate coping with systemic infections caused by antibiotic - resistant microorganisms [ 49 - 51 ] .
furthermore , peptide stapling enables delivering a selective antimicrobial peptide drug via patient - friendly oral route .
for instance , bird et al. examined a double - stapled peptide sah - gp41 ( 626 - 662 ) .
after oral administration this peptide achieved a measurable and dose - dependent plasma concentrations in contrast to its unstapled counterpart which was undetected ( mouse model ) [ 24 ] .
this article reviews the current state of knowledge of hydrocarbon stapled antimicrobial peptides .
undoubtedly , these compounds appear as a promising class of antimicrobial agents .
the facts and possibilities presented in this paper encourage for further studies .

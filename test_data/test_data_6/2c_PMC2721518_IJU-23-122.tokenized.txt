introduction : we sought to determine the distribution of serum prostate specific antigen ( psa ) levels in a community - based population in the state of gujarat in india .
materials and methods : community screening of subjects residing in kheda and anand districts of gujarat was done with digital rectal examination ( dre ) , uroflowmetry and transabdominal sonography and serum psa .
in three villages transrectal sonography was done in addition to transabdominal sonography .
all patients with a psa of more than 4 ng / ml and / or abnormal dre were evaluated .
biopsy - proven prostatic malignancy was detected in 20 patients .
subjects who did not follow up and who had biopsy - proven malignancy were excluded from the analysis , 1899 subjects were analyzed .
results : one thousand seven hundred and eighty - seven ( 89.17 %) had a psa of < 4 ngml , 180 ( 8.9 %) had a psa between 4 - 10 ng / ml , while 37 ( 1.8 %) had a psa more than 10ng / ml. there was a statistically significant correlation between age and prostate volume ( correlation coefficient 0.33 ) and between prostate volume and psa ( correlation coefficient 0.50 ) .
the age - specific psa values derived as the 95th percentile value were as follows , 40 - 49 years ( 0 - 2.1 ) , 50 - 59 years ( 0 - 3.4 ) , 60 - 69 years ( 0 - 4.2 ) and more than 70 years ( 0 - 5.0 ) .
the 95th percentile value for psad was 0.19 .
conclusion : indians need to have separate psa reference ranges .
the age - specific psa ranges for men in the present study population are on the lower side and the prostate specific antigen density on the higher side .
community study prostate specific antigen density ranges prostate specific antigen ( psa ) has been described as a single test with highest positive predictive value for diagnosing carcinoma prostate. [ 1 ] routine use of psa helps in diagnosing organ - confined prostate cancers .
the psa thresholds such as age - specific psa , psa density ( psad ) and psa velocity improve the specificity and sensitivity of psa .
osterling et al observed that serum psa , prostate volume and psa density values have racial differences .
they noted that community - based japanese population had different psa values and prostate volume as compared to the american population. [ 2 ] indians being ethnically distinct from caucasians and japanese , we sought to determine the distribution of serum psa levels in a community - based population in the state of gujarat in india .
materials and methods we conducted a community screening of subjects residing in the kheda and anand districts of gujarat .
approval from the ethical committee , muljibhai patel urological hospital was taken for carrying out the screening .
the population was informed through electronic and print media regarding the date and venue of community screening , the help of local nongovernment organizations was also taken .
we also distributed pamphlets informing the subjects about the nature of screening and who may benefit from it.the screening at the venue started with an in - depth lecture on the purpose and objectives of the screening by a senior urologist , the lecture was delivered in gujarati .
on the day of screening the subjects were extensively counseled through dialogue , posters and pamphlets about psa , lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) and carcinoma prostate .
the study population is not an ethnically distinct group but is representative of the overall population of gujarat [ figure 1 ] .
the study population comprised adivasis ( 22 %) , rural ( 43 %) and urban ( 35 %) subjects .
two thousand four hundred and six subjects attended the community - screening program .
all subjects underwent a detailed clinical evaluation that included a digital rectal examination ( dre ) , uroflowmetry and transabdominal sonography .
all the three were done by two urologists who attended all the screening venues .
figure 1 study population included for the community screening international prostate symptom score validated in local language was recorded .
blood was drawn for serum psa estimation .
subjects requiring any intervention were dealt with as needed .
subjects without any urological ailment were considered healthy .
two thousand and four subjects were evaluable .
due to logistic reasons we randomly selected three villages in which transrectal sonography ( trus ) was done in addition to transabdominal sonography .
patients with abnormal dre and / or raised psa and abnormal findings on trus underwent further evaluation for prostatic malignancy .
a written consent was obtained before subjecting the patient to trus biopsy .
all serum psa estimations were carried out with radiometric assay technique ( diagnostic system laboratory , texas , united states ) .
the standard reference range for this assay was 0.0 - 4.0 ng / ml. the assay was conducted at the central clinical laboratory , department of pathology , muljibhai patel urological hospital , nadiad , gujarat .
all the trus biopsy cores were seen by a single pathologist at our central clinical laboratory .
all psa determinations were made prior to any prostatic manipulations including dre and trus .
transrectal sonography was performed with a 7.5 mhz side - firing endorectal probe ( b - k medical panther , advanced diagnostic imaging ) to assess the prostate volume .
the prostate volume was assessed by using the ellipsoid formula. [ 34 ] psa density was calculated by dividing serum psa with prostate volume. [ 5 ] statistical analysis the upper limit of normal for calculating the age - specific psa values and psad was considered as 95th percentile .
the value was calculated after sorting the data decade - wise .
correlation between psa , age and prostate volume was calculated by using pearson 's correlation ( two - tailed ) coefficient .
correlation coefficients and trend lines were plotted using spss version 10.0 .
results the mean age of the study population was 62.1 +/ - 9.5 years .
one thousand seven hundred and eighty - seven ( 89.17 %) had a psa of less the 4 ng / ml,180 ( 8.9 %) had a psa between 4 - 10 ng / ml , while 37 ( 1.8 %) had a psa more than 10 ng / ml. all patients with a psa of more than 4 ng / ml and or abnormal dre were asked to follow up for further evaluation .
biopsy - proven prostatic malignancy was detected in 20 patients ( mean psa 12.8 , range 1.5 - 40 ) .
among the subjects with positive biopsy seven underwent radical prostatectomy .
we excluded subjects who did not follow up ( n = 85 ) and who had biopsy - proven malignancy ( n = 20 ) from further analysis .
one thousand eight hundred and ninety - nine subjects were available for the present analysis [ figure 2 ] .
figure 2 study design - flow chart age - wise distribution of psa of the entire population is shown in the scattergram [ figure 3 ] and the values are as shown in table 1 ; the serum psa values linearly increased with age .
the distribution of psa as a function of prostate volume ( trus volume ) is shown in the scattergram [ figure 4 ] .

discussion it has been suggested that serum psa varies among different races. [ 6 ] osterling et al have described age - specific psa reference ranges for the healthy cohort of japanese men .
they compare the psa as well as the psad values of the study population with western literature [ table 3 ] .
japanese men have lower age - specific psa and higher psad values [ table 3 ].[ 27 ] gupta et al noted that japanese men with luts and clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) produce and / or release more psa per unit volume than western men .
the apparent difference was attributed to difference in composition of the prostates. [ 8 ] an indian study by agarwal et al describes the psa and psad values in a hospital - based population .
the values tend to be higher than those reported in the western literature. [ 9 ] although a study from andhra pradesh , india evaluates the causes of luts in community - based population ,[ 10 ] there is a paucity of literature describing the psa ranges in a community setting .
though the study population in our analysis represents the population in gujarat , india being a socioculturally and ethnically diverse country , the results cannot be necessarily extrapolated to the whole indian population .
in our study the age - specific psa values were comparable to the age - matched japanese population [ table 3 ] , however they differed from the western literature .
decade - wise , the prostate volumes are also comparable to the japanese population [ 2 ] [ table 3 ] .

[ 11 ] the age - specific and psad ranges in our study [ table 3 ] give a suggestion as when to evaluate a subject for malignancy .
for example , with a range of 0.0 - 2.1 [ table 1 ] as suggested in this investigation , a psa of 2.2 with a psad of 0.15 in a 48 - year - old indian man would require further evaluation with trus and biopsy .
the prostate volume in our study population was lower as compared to the published literature , however analysis of the relative amount of stromal and glandular tissue contributing to bph in indians and the genetic aspect analysis may be of interest .
lower psa levels in our study population may also perhaps reflect a lower prevalence of prostate cancer in this part of the world .
conclusion indians being ethnically distinct , need to have separate psa reference ranges which need to be established with large community - based multicentre indian studies .
the age - specific psa ranges for men in our study population are on the lower side and the psad on the higher side .
the study also indicates that serum psa correlates with age , which is primarily due to increasing prostate volume as age advances .

background muscle co - activation plays an important role in enhancing joint stability for movement regulation during motor learning activities .
in normal aging , greater muscle co - activation is induced during gait in elderly adults .
this study investigated age - related changes in muscle co - activation and spatio - temporal parameters during gait and identified the relationship between muscle co - activation and gait speed .
methods a total of 46 adult volunteers participated in this study in three age groups ( 15 young adults [ 8 males , 7 females ; age , 24.27 +/ - 2.71 ] , 15 middle - aged adults [ 8 males , 7 females ; age , 53.71 +/ - 2.52 ] , and 16 elderly adults [ 7 males , 9 females ; age , 76.88 +/ - 3.48 ]) .
all participants underwent locomotion analysis using a three - dimensional motion analysis system and 12 - channel dynamic electromyography .
results the elderly adults showed significantly higher co - activation than the young and middle - aged adults during gait ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , elderly adults showed significantly lower trunk co - activation than the young and middle - aged adults ( p < 0.05 ) .
muscle co - activation was significantly correlated with gait speed by aging .
muscle co - activation of the trunk showed a significant positive correlation with gait speed based on age .
however , muscle co - activation of the lower extremity showed a significant negative correlation with gait speed based on age .
conclusion this finding demonstrated that less muscle co - activation of the trunk was related to locomotive instability in elderly adults .
therefore , clarification of the relationship between trunk co - activation and locomotor instability will be helpful for developing optimal rehabilitation of elderly people to prevent fall .

elderly adults compensate for their reduced physical performance by being more cautious and by changing their gait pattern [ 1 ] .
compared to young adults , elderly adults' gait pattern is characterized by slower gait speed , shorter step length , reduced range of motion at the hip , knee , and ankle joints , shorter relative swing phase , and a distal to proximal shift of joint torques [ 2 , 3 ] .
in particular , sarcopenia is a well described effect of aging , and a reduction in muscle strength and power is generally associated with loss of muscle mass [ 4 ] .
it is also characterized by an overall decrease in the number of muscle fibers and cross - sectional area due to fatty and connective tissue replacement of the muscle fibers .
this non - contractile tissue replacement may cause increased joint stiffness [ 5 ] .
muscle co - activation is the concurrent contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles that cross a joint .
muscle co - activation helps to enhance joint stability during movement regulation of motor learning activities [ 6 ] .
previous reports describe an increase in antagonist co - activation in the trunk and lower extremity muscles as a function of gait [ 7 , 8 ] .
in normal aging , greater muscle co - activation is induced during gait in elderly adults [ 7 ] .
increased muscle co - activation in elderly adults is most commonly described as a compensatory mechanism to increase joint stiffness that thereby enhances stability [ 9 ] .
in addition , increased co - activation in elderly adults might be related with an increase in walking energy cost [ 7 ] .
despite this compensatory strategy , elderly adults still express an unstable gait pattern [ 10 ] .
consequently , co - activation of the trunk and lower extremity was important for maintaining gait stability in the elderly .
several studies have demonstrated that appropriate trunk co - activation promoted successfully dynamic balance and increased efficiency of gait [ 11 , 12 ] .
age - related gait changes induce trunk instability , and elderly subjects who find it more difficult to control trunk stability during gait are at greater risk of falls [ 13 ] .
in addition , other studies have shown that an increase in antagonist co - activation in lower extremity muscles leads to greater stabilization of gait [ 7 , 14 ] .
hortobagyi et al .
[ 7 ] showed that older adults exhibited approximately 83 % higher co - activation in the thigh and shank .
lasen et al .
[ 15 ] demonstrated that elderly adults exhibited 20 % higher co - activation around the thigh during the stance phase when compared with young adults .
however , aging related differences in muscle co - activation are based on a granular gait cycle .
surface electromyographic analysis ( semg ) is used to estimate muscle activation and co - activation during gait .
assessment of trunk and lower extremity muscle activity can provide important information about muscular signals during gait [ 16 ] .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to clarify age - related differences in muscle co - activation of the trunk and lower extremity during gait among young , middle - aged and elderly adults .
in addition , we investigated the relationship between muscle co - activation and gait speed by aging .
we hypothesized that elderly adults had more co - activation of lower extremity muscles during gait than young and middle - aged adults .
however , we also hypothesized that the elderly would have less co - activation of trunk muscle during gait than young and middle - aged adults .
finally , we hypothesized that muscle co - activation relates to gait speed by aging .
methods participants fifteen young adults ( 8 males , 7 females ; age , 24.27 +/ - 2.71 ) , fifteen middle - aged adults ( 8 males , 7 females ; age , 53.71 +/ - 2.52 ) , and sixteen elderly adults ( 7 males , 9 females ; age , 76.88 +/ - 3.48 ) participated in this study ( table 1 ) .
all subjects were right - side dominant .
we performed the sppb ( short physical performance battery ) assessment to evaluate physical functioning .
elderly participants in this study were considered high functioning if they scored >= 7 on the sppb [ 17 ] .
the participant characteristics are summarized table 1 .
prior to enrollment in the study , all participants provided written informed consent based on documents approved by the samsung medical center institutional review board .

the marker set used for this study is the helen - hayes model , which included 19 retroreflective markers ( 25 mm diameter ) positioned on the pelvis and lower limbs .
six cameras were placed between 1 - 2 m and 6 m on a walkway in the gait laboratory .
muscle activation during gait was synchronously recorded using a 12 - channel desktop direct transmission system semg device ( noraxon inc. , scottsdale , az , usa ) .
semg signals were collected at a sample frequency of 1000hz , using 10 mm 3mtm ag / agcl surface electrodes with an active area of 1 cm2 and an inter - electrode distance of 2 cm arranged in a bipolar configuration .
the electrodes were positioned on the subjects' right side on the rectus abdominis ( ra ) , external oblique ( eo ) , erector spinae of the lower back ( es ) , multifidus of the lower back ( mf ) , gluteus maximus ( gmax ) , gluteus medius ( gmed ) , rectus femoris ( rf ) , vastus medialis oblique ( vmo ) , adductor longus ( add ) , biceps femoris ( bf ) , tibialis anterior ( ta ) , and the medial part of gastrocnemius ( mgcm ) muscles as described in the surface electromyography for the non - invasive assessment of muscles project [ 18 ] .
in addition , two foot switch sensors were placed on the plantar surface of each subject 's foot in the right toe and heel positions .
each site was prepared by shaving , abrading , and cleaning the area with alcohol to reduce surface impedance .
experimental protocol before gait performance assessment , this study was normalized to amplitudes recorded during maximum voluntary contraction ( mvc ) of various muscles among the subjects .
all the participants performed maximal back extension against manual resistance in prone positions for assessment of the es and mf. in order to assess the ra and eo , subjects maximally flexed the muscles of their trunk , and manual resistance was applied to their extended arms and knees in supine positions with the knees bent to resist trunk rotation .
the gmax was assessed with maximal leg extension against manual resistance in a prone position .
subjects also performed maximal knee extension against manual resistance in sitting positions for assessment of the rf and vmo .
the bf was assessed with maximal knee flexion against manual resistance in a sitting position .
the add was assessed with maximal knee adduction against manual resistance in a sitting position .
the ta was assessed with maximal ankle dorsiflexion against manual resistance in a sitting position .
finally , subjects undertook maximal plantar - flexion of their ankles against manual resistance in a standing position [ 19 ] .
in all the assessments performed , mvc was maintained for ten seconds by all the subjects .
participants were required to walk at a self - selected speed along a walkway 6 m in length .
all participants wore their own athletic footwear for gait performance testing .
before formal measurements were started , practice sessions were performed to familiarize the participants with the procedure .
then , five trials were acquired per participant .
data analysis the semg signals were sampled at 1000 hz , and were band - pass filtered ( 10 - 350 hz ) and full - wave rectified with noraxon software ( myoresearch xp master edition ) [ 20 ] .
this study processed the average normalized semg activity within selected phases of the gait cycle using matlab software ( mathworks , inc. , natick , ma , usa ) [ 21 ] .
the selected phases of the gait cycle included the loading ( 0 - 10 % of the gait cycle ) , mid - stance ( 10 - 30 %) , terminal stance and pre - swing ( 30 - 60 %) , initial swing ( 60 - 73 %) , and terminal swing ( 87 - 100 %) phases [ 22 ] .
the percent co - activation index ( ci ) is the percentage of co - activation between the agonist / antagonist muscles in the trunk part ( ra : es , ra : mf ) , the thigh part ( rf : bf , vmo : bf , gmed : add ) , and the shank part ( ta : mgcm ) , and was calculated using the following equation [ 14 ]:\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ \ mathrm { c }\ mathrm { i }\ \ left (\%\ right )= 2 \ left (\ frac {{\ displaystyle \ int } min \ left ( sem { g }_{ agonist },\ kern0.5em sem { g }_{ antagonist }\ right )}{{\ displaystyle \ int } sem { g }_{ agonist }+{\ displaystyle \ int } sem { g }_{ antagonist }}\ right ) 100 $$\ end { document } ci %= 2integralminsemgagonist,semgantagonistintegralsemgagonist + integralsemgantagonist100 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using spss version 19 for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
statistical methods were used for the calculation of means and standard deviations .
one - way anova was used to compare the spatio - temporal data and co - activation data during gait between the young , middle - aged , and elderly subjects .
post - hoc analyses used tukey 's honest significant difference tests .
the relationships between gait speed and muscle co - activation during gait were assessed using pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r ) .
statistical significance was defined at p < 0.05 .

in tukey 's hsd post hoc tests , the preferred gait speed of elderly adults was slower than the preferred gait speed of middle - aged and young adults .
elderly adults had shorter cadence and stride length than middle - aged and young adults .
finally , step width was larger in elderly adults than in middle - aged and young adults ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 age - related differences in spatio - temporal parameters during gait .
elderly adults exhibited slower gait speed , shorter cadence , shorter stride length , and larger step width than young and middle - aged adults (** p < 0.001 ) ci in stance phase as illustrated in table 2 , in the initial contact phase , elderly adults had significantly decreased ci levels of the trunk part ( ra : es , p < 0.05 ; ra : mf , p < 0.01 ) by age .
however , the thigh part of elderly adults showed higher ci levels ( rf : bf , p < 0.05 ; vmo : bf , p < 0.05 ) than young adults .
in the loading response and mid - stance phase , the trunk part of elderly adults showed a lower ci level ( ra : es , p < 0.05 ) than that of mid - aged and young adults .
elderly adults had significantly increased ci levels in the thigh part ( vmo : bf , p < 0.05 ; gmed : add , p < 0.01 ) by age .
in the terminal stance phase , only the thigh part ( gmed : add ) in the elderly had a significantly higher ci level than it did in young adults ( p < 0.05 ) .
finally , in the pre - swing phase , only the thigh part in elderly adults ( rf : bf ) had a significantly higher ci level than it did in young adults ( p < 0.05 ) .
there were no significant differences in shank part ci based on age ( table 2 ) .

ra : rectus abdominis , es : erector spinae , mf : multifidus discussion this study was designed to quantify the co - activation of the trunk and the lower extremity in young , middle - aged , and elderly adults during gait at a self - selected speed .
it was also designed to demonstrate the relationship between muscle co - activation and gait speed .
although previous studies have demonstrated higher lower extremity muscle co - activation during gait in elderly adults compared with young adults [ 7 , 23 ] , no studies have quantified additional trunk co - activation during gait in the elderly .
the present study focused on quantifying trunk muscle and lower extremity co - activation for stability and has made several important findings .
trunk co - activation during gait was lower in the elderly adults than in young and middle - aged adults .
in contrast , lower extremity co - activation during gait was higher in elderly adults than in young and middle - aged adults .
a decrease in trunk co - activation was correlated with slower gait .
these results suggest that less trunk muscle co - activation in elderly adult leads to poor postural stability during gait .
several studies identified that high levels of co - activation are associated with aging , which may impair gait performance [ 24 , 25 ] .
excessive muscle co - activation in elderly adults has been described as a strategy to stiffen joints and enhance stability [ 7 ] .
increasing joint stiffness is used to compensate for the many neuro - motor impairments associated with aging [ 26 ] , including reduced muscle strength , proportion of fast muscle fibers , and fear of falling [ 27 ] .
in particular , a previous study found that older fallers had lower knee extensor strength , which was associated with a reduction of rf activation at the initial contact phase during gait .
to compensate for this , elderly adults had higher thigh co - activation during gait [ 28 ] .
therefore , increased muscle co - activation with locomotion in elderly adults may be a necessary change to compensate for poor stability .
however , excessive co - activation in elderly adults is likely to increase the energy cost of locomotion , thereby inducing fatigue and increasing the risk of falling [ 7 ] .
this study results extend the co - activation data on the lower extremity and suggest that antagonist co - activation may be contribute to the age - related increase in the energy cost of locomotion .
interestingly , we also observed a decrease in trunk co - activation by age during gait .
walter & morris ( 1972 ) found that the trunk muscle must balance ( i.e. , stability ) during gait on the pelvis , which moves along vertical and lateral axes [ 29 ] .
locomotion is associated with phasic activity in the rectus abdominis , the major portion of which is observed to occur before significant activity of the back muscle .
the rectus abdominis appears to exert a stabilizing flexion force [ 30 ] .
in addition , activity of the erector spinae and multifidus muscles stabilizes the trunk in the lateral plane [ 31 ] .
furthermore , trunk co - activation during walking requires a stability pattern of muscle forces for balance in locomotion [ 32 ] .
age - related trunk co - activation may be due in part to a greater need for active muscular stabilization of locomotion in elderly adults .
however , our study results found significant poor co - activation of the trunk by aging .
this observation supports the finding that elderly adults are associated with reduced postural control ability .
decreased trunk co - activation in elderly adults could contribute to an increased risk of falling due to unstable gait .
gait speed influences co - activation of the trunk and lower extremity [ 7 ] .
our results showed higher gait speed in elderly adults than in the young and middle - aged .
furthermore , our study found a significant negative correlation between gait speed and muscle co - activation of the lower extremity .
this finding suggests that elderly adults probably can utilize a significant muscle co - activation strategy when walking with decreased gait speed .
in addition , co - activation of the trunk revealed a significant positive partial correlation with gait speed .
this finding may suggest that less muscle co - activation of trunk is related with locomotive instability in elderly adults .
this is a pilot study with a significant small sample size to support the study 's cross - sectional design .
thus , the current results warrant caution such as the small sample comparisons between the groups and the increased co - morbidity and cognitive impairment in the elderly group as compared to the middle - age and younger groups .
future research should reproduce this study results with larger samples and individuals with similar characteristics .
conclusions this study asserts that there are age - related differences in the co - activation of the trunk and lower extremity muscles during gait .
elderly adults have significantly higher co - activation of lower extremity muscles than young and middle - aged adults at their preferred gait speed .
in contrast , trunk co - activation is significantly lower in elderly adults than in young and middle - aged adults .
clarification of the relationship between trunk co - activation and locomotor instability will be helpful for developing optimal rehabilitation of elderly people to prevent fall .

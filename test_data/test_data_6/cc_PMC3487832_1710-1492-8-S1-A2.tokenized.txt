one of the most critical structural changes that affect airway functionality is fibrotic tissue deposition within the airway wall .
eosinophils have been proposed in different studies to contribute to the production of several mediators and cytokines , including the profibrotic cytokines , tgf - beta and il - 11 .
in this study , we hypothesize that cytokines prevailing in asthmatic tissue such as th1 , th2 , and th17 cytokines , may induce eosinophils to produce pro - fibrotic cytokines .
methods eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood of 6 mild asthmatics and 6 normal control subjects .
eosinophils were stimulated with th1 , th2 and th17 cytokines and production of pro - fibrotic cytokines , tgf - beta and il - 11 , were determined using intra - cellular cytokine detection and facs analysis , immunohistochemistry , as well as real time pcr .
results the level of basal expression of eosinophil tgf - beta and il - 11 was significantly upregulated in asthmatic patients compared to healthy individuals .
stimulating eosinophils with th1 and th2 cytokines did not induce expression of eosinophils derived pro - fibrotic cytokines .
however , stimulating eosinophils with il - 17 resulted in the enhancement of the expression tgf - beta and il - 11 in asthmatic individuals .
conclusions the regulation of expression of pro - fibrotic cytokines within eosinophils is th1 / th2 independent .
however , il - 17 seems to regulate eosinophl profibrotic cytokine release in asthmatic patients and hence contributing to the accumulation of fibrotic tissue in asthmatic airways .

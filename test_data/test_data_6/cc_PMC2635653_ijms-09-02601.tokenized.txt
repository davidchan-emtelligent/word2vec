osmotin promoter binding protein 1 ( opbp1 ) , an ap2 / erf transcription factor of tobacco , has been demonstrated to function in disease resistance and salt tolerance in tobacco .
to increase stress tolerant capability of rice , we generated rice plants with an opbp1 overexpressing construct .
salinity shock treatment with 250 mm nacl indicated that most of the opbp1 transgenic plants can survive , whereas the control seedlings cannot .
similar recovery was found by using the seedlings grown in 200 mm nacl for two weeks .
the opbp1 transgenic and control plants were also studied for oxidative stress tolerance by treatment with paraquat , showing the transgenic lines were damaged less in comparison with the control plants .
further , the opbp1 overexpression lines exhibited enhanced resistance to infections of magnaporthe oryzae and rhizoctonia solani pathogens .
gene expressing analysis showed increase in mrna accumulation of several stress related genes .
these results suggest that expression of opbp1 gene increase the detoxification capability of rice .
ap2 / erebp salt tolerance disease resistance transcription factor transgenic rice 1 .
introduction as sessile organisms , plants have developed adaptive strategies to cope with environmental stress by expressing specific genes and synthesizing a variety of proteins or compounds including transcription factors , late embryogenesis - abundant ( lea ) proteins , transporters , antioxidants , proline , and sugars [ 1 ] .
they are categorized either as effectors , which directly modulate or attenuate stress effects , or as regulators that are involved in stress perception , signal transduction , or regulation of effectors .
lea proteins have been considered to play roles in maintenance membrane structures , binding of water , and acting as molecular chaperones [ 2 ] .
sugar and other compatible solutes serve as osmoprotectants and stabilize biomolecules .
for instance , accumulation of trehalose , a nonreducing disaccharide of glucose , in rice plants confers high tolerance levels to different abiotic stresses [ 3 ] .
ap2 / erfs have been identified as a large gene family of plant transcription factors and contain a conserved basic 58 or 59 - amino acid dna - binding domain , defined as erf domain [ 4 , 5 ] .
a comprehensive computational analysis identified 122 and 139 erf family genes in arabidopsis and rice , respectively [ 6 ] .
erf proteins have found to play important roles in plant adaptation to abiotic stress , such as drought , cold , salt oxidative stress and aba response [ 7 ] .
the barley erf protein hvraf enhances salt tolerance in arabidopsis [ 8 ] .
three arabidopsis erfs , dreb1a , dreb2a , and cbf1 , are induced in response to drought or cold stress [ 5 , 9 ] .
further , ectopic expression of the genes such as cbf1 or dreb1a has been shown to improve dehydration stress tolerance in arabidopsis [ 10 ] .
dubouzet et al .
[ 11 ] isolated five dreb homologs from rice , in which overexpression osdreb1a increased tolerant to drought in arabidopsis .
in previous study , we have demonstrated that opbp1 , an erf transcription factor isolated from tobacco is mediated in disease resistance and salt tolerance in tobacco [ 12 ] .
in this report , we generated opbp1 overexpressing rice plants and found the transgenic progenies exhibited enhanced disease resistance against magnaporthe oryzae and rhizoctonia solani , as well as tolerance to salt stress .
2. results 2.1 .
expression of stress - inducible genes in opbp1 transgenic plants since opbp1 was a regulator of disease resistance and salt tolerance in tobacco , we extended the study to examine a possible biological function of opbp1 in rice .
opbp1 gene was constructed under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter ( ubi : opbp1 ) .
thirty independent lines were obtained by agrobacterium - mediated transformation method .
expression of the transgene in some of t2 progenies was examined by northern blot analysis .
as shown in figure 1a , accumulation of opbp1 mrna was increased in roots , although the level of accumulation varied between different lines .
to examine the induction of gene expression in opbp1 overexpressing plants , we chose several stress - inducible rice genes , such as delta - l - pyrroline - 5 - carboxylate synthetase ( osp5cs ) [ 13 ] , osgstu1 [ 14 ] encoding for glutathione - s - transferase , and osim1 [ 15 ] , sharing homology with aox members of atim and ptox .
overall , expression of osgst , osim1 and osp5cs genes was increased in the transgenic opbp1 plants in comparison with the control plants ( figure 1b ) .
2.2 .
expression of opbp1 enhances salt tolerance in rice to investigate the response to salinity , the transgenic rice seedlings of t2 progenies were grown for two weeks in 1 / 2 ms containing different concentrations of nacl in the presence of hygromycin .
the growth was suppressed with the increase of nacl concentration both in the transgenic and the control plants .
the heights in the presence of 200 mm nacl were about one quarter of those without nacl for both the control and transgenic lines ( data not shown ) .
comparing the root growth between the transgenic and control plants , the length of roots in opbp1 overexpressing plants was even slightly increased in the presence of 100 or 150 mm nacl , whereas the root length did not change significantly in the control plants under this condition ( figure 2 ) .
increase of nacl up to 200 mm , the root growth was inhibited in both the transgenic and control lines .
the effects of salt on plants are considered to be caused by ionic toxicity and osmotic pressure [ 16 ] .
to examine the osmotic effect , rice seedlings were treated with osmotic reagent peg 6000 ( 12.1 % , w / v ) , whose osmotic pressure was about that of 100 mm nacl .
at this concentration of peg6000 , the root growth was even stimulated slightly at the osmotic stress ( figure 2c ) .
the results suggest that inhibition of rice growth by nacl treatment is possibly due to the ionic toxicity .
to examine the recovery capacity of salt - treated plants , the rice seedlings grown in 200 mm nacl for two weeks were transferred to normal 1 / 2ms medium for recovery .
after another two weeks , the control plants did not grow significantly , as revealed by measurement of the plant heights ( figure 3a ) .
in line with this , the fv / fm value of the control plants , a parameter often used as an indicator of the efficiency of primary photochemistry in photosystem ii ( psii ) , decreased in comparing with the opbp1 expressing lines ( figure 3b ) .
importantly , the number of crown roots was more in the ubi : opbp1 plants than the controls and the lengths of crown roots were longer ( figure 3c , d ) .
also , for most of the opbp1 transgenic plants , the average biomass of the seedlings were near double the weight of the controls ( data not shown ) .
furthermore , the opbp1 transgenic and control plants were examined for their restorable capability after high salinity shock .
three - week - old rice seedlings were exposed to 250 mm nacl for 18 h. with this treatment , about 37 % of the youngest leaves of the control seedlings showed morphological wilting .
then , the treated seedlings were washed off and planted in soil for restoration .
within a seven - day - period of recovery , the control seedlings did not show obvious growth and about 31 % of them died ( figure 4 ) .
on the other hand , the death of opbp1 overexpressing plants was significantly less compared with the control lines .
the damage on the secondary leaves was more severe in the control lines than the opbp1 overexpressing plants , as indicated by the fv / fm values on day 4 after the treatment .
new emergent leaves in the ubi : opbp1 plants survived .
the results suggest that overexpressing opbp1 increase the detoxification capability of rice .
2.3 .
overexpression of opbp1 increases tolerance to oxidative damage and resistance against rice fungal pathogens since generation of reactive oxygen species and programmed cell death are mediated in salinity stress [ 17 ] , the tolerance against oxidative stress of the opbp1 overexpressing and control plants was studied by treatment the plants with paraquat ( pq ) , which is a chemical producing superoxide anion and h2o2 .
similarly , the fv / fm values were measured to evaluate the damage of the plants .
as shown in figure 5 , decreases of fv / fm values were apparent in both the opbp1 overexpressing and the control plants 24 h after treatment with pq. however , the opbp1 overexpressing plants showed less extent of decrease in fv / fm values comparing with the control plants , suggesting that overexpression of opbp1 stimulated the protective mechanism of rice plants against oxidative damage .
rice blast , caused by magnaporthe oryzae , is a disastrous crop disease worldwide .
to examine the effect of the transgene on disease resistance , the transgenic and control plants were inoculated with a virulent isolate of m. oryzae 97 - 220e3 .
severity of disease development was evaluated by counting the number of lesions and measuring the size of lesions on infected leaves .
the lesion numbers were reduced in the opbp1 overexpressing lines , especially lines 3 , 11 , and 21 , comparing with the control plants ( figure 6a and 6b ) .
also , the lesions on the leaves of the transgenic plants were considerably smaller in size ( figure 6b ) .
rice sheath blight is also a severe disease caused by rhizoctonia solani .
we inoculated the transgenic and control plants with an isolate of r. solani yn - 7 and found that the lesion development was slower in the opbp1 overexpressing lines in comaprison with the control plants ( figure 6c ) .
3. discussion genes induced by a stress are considered to play roles in responses to it. the early induced genes are required for stress perception , signal transduction or immediate protection , whereas those induced later are possibly involved in homeostasis and recovery .
overexpression of opbp1 , an early immediate gene , results in a high tolerance to salt stress and enhanced resistance against pathogen attacks in tobacco [ 12 ] .
also , several reports have demonstrated that overexpression of erf genes enhances the ability of transgenic plants to withstand environmental cues .
ectopic expression of cbf1 / dreb1 genes activated cold responsive genes and enhanced cold and osmotic tolerance of non - acclimated arabidopsis plants .
dreb2 , on the other hand , was found to be involved in drought - responsive gene expression [ 9 , 10 ] .
in this study , ectopic expression of opbp1 gene enhanced tolerance to salt stress as well as resistance against m. oryzae and r. solani pathogens , suggesting opbp1 probably functions in a similar way in rice as in tobacco .
the damage cause by salt stress is often related to the production of oxidative stress .
a number of reports have demonstrated that enhancement of the ros scavenging systems in plants can provide protection from oxidative damage .
for instance , overexpression of gst in tobacco showed substantial improvement of seedling growth under stressful condition including chilling and salinity [ 18 ] .
this protective effect appears to scavenge products of lipid peroxidation generated as a result of enhanced ros production .
overexpression of opbp1 gene increased the level of osgstu expression except of line s7 ( figure 1b ) .
this low osgstu expression level in line s7 seems to coincide with its lesser restoration capability from salt - stress ( figure 3a , 3d ) .
furthermore , osim gene is induced by salt stress and has been estimated to decrease the content of ros generated under salt - stress condition [ 15 ] .
osim shares homology with atim from arabidopsis and ptox from tomato , which function as a plastid terminal oxidase for carotenoid synthesis in the phytogene de - saturation step .
carotenoids can prevent plants from oxidative stress by reacting with reactive oxygen species directly or indirectly [ 19 ] .
increase the level of osim1 expression in opbp1 transgenic plants suggests again that the transgenic provides higher level of ros scavenging capacity .
in support of this , we observed a relative increase of paraquat tolerance in opbp1 overexpressing plants comparing with the controls ( figure 5 ) .
one of the mechanisms for plant adaptation to water deficiency is the accumulation of low - molecular - weight organic compatible solutes such as sugars , some amino acids and quaternary ammonium compounds [ 20 ] .
we examined the expression of some stress - related genes , such as osp5cs , encoding a key enzyme for proline biosynthesis [ 13 ] .
osp5cs is induced by salt stress , cold stress , drought and the treatment of exogenous aba [ 13 ] .
the expression of osp5cs and the accumulation of proline induced by high - salt treatment have been demonstrated to relate to the degree of salt tolerance in rice .
in agreement , the increase in mrna accumulation of osp5cs in the transgenic plants suggest that overexpression of opbp1 may help avoid stress associated injuries and better recovery from stress .
high salt stress disrupts homeostasis in water potential and ion distribution .
to achieve salt tolerance , one of strategies is to help plants to re - establish both ionic and osmotic homeostasis in stressful environments .
increase osmotic stress by treatment with peg increased root growths of transgenic and wild - type rice plants ( figure 3c ) , especially the increase in line s3 was significant different from the control plant coincident with the expression of opbp1 in line s3 , which was the highest among the plants studied .
the results suggest that the high level of expressing opbp1 in the transgenic plant probably lead more rapidly or strongly responsing to osmotic stress .
the identification of molecular switches and regulatory genes would provide a better tool for crop improvement strategies .
4. experimental section 4.1 .
construction of plasmids and rice transformation to overexpress opbp1 gene in rice ( oryza sativa subsp .
japanica var .
xiushui 11 ) , the cdna of opbp1 was digested with bamh i / sac i and inserted into pcou linearized with the same enzymes .
opbp1 gene was under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter and terminated with an rbcs terminator in the generated plasmid ( cou - ubi : opbp1 ) .
rice transformation was performed as described by hiei et al .
[ 21 ] .
hygromycin b - resistant plants were grown in the greenhouse and set seeds .
4.2 .
rna isolation and northern blot total rna from rice leaves was isolated using the trizol reagent kit according to manufacturer 's instructions .
an aliquot of 20mug total rna was fractionated in a 1.0 % denaturing agarose formaldehyde gel and subsequently transferred onto nylon membranes ( hybond - n + , amersham ) .
hybridizations were performed with 32p - labeled opbp1 cdna fragment as described previously [ 12 ] .
4.3 .
chemical treatments the rice seeds of t2 progenies were surface sterilized with 70 % ethanol for 5 min and with 2.5 % naclo for 30 min .
they were washed thoroughly , soaked in distilled water for 48 h , and incubated for 24 h at 30 degreesc in the dark conditions .
the germinated seeds were sown in 300 ml plastic cups with dark cloth outside .
the seedlings were grown on the medium containing 1 / 2 ms salts without sucrose and organic ingredients , in the presence of 0 , 100 , 150 , and 200 mm nacl , respectively .
for osmotic treatment , we used a 12.1 % peg6000 solution , which had a similar osmotic potential ( - 0.58 mpa ) as 100 mm nacl solution .
after 14 days growth at 25 degreesc with a day / night cycles of 16 / 8 h , the heights and root length of the seedlings were measured .
to examine the recovery capability , the seedlings grew in 200 mm nacl for two weeks were transfered to a new 1 / 2 ms medium in the absence of nacl for 14 days more growth .
then , the seedlings were harvested for measurement of parameters .
in order to investigate the seedlings tolerance to salt shock , the germinated seeds of the t2 and the control lines were sown in pots filled with a mixture of soil and vermiculite ( 1:1 , v / v ) and grown in the field under a 14 / 10 h ( light / dark ) photoperiod at 27 degreesc for 3 weeks with daily watering .
the seedlings were treated or not with 250 mm nacl for 18 h. after this treatment , the seedlings were washed with water and allowed to grow under normal condition for another 35 days .
the values of fv / fm of the secondary leaves were determined at the planned time .
the dry weights were measured after placing fresh seedlings in an 80 degreesc oven for 72 hours .
for paraquat treatment , leaf blade pieces about 3 cm in length each from the secondary leaves of 3 - week - old seedlings were floated on a 30mum paraquat solution .
equivalent leaf blade sections were incubated on sterile water without paraquat treatments as a control .
the leaf blade sections were incubated for 24 h at 25 degreesc under continuous illumination ( 200 w / m2 / s ) until sampling .
4.4 .
determination of chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence was performed with a fluorometer .
fluorescence signals were from the second leaf of each rice plant , which had been dark - adapted for 15 min , were measured at the indicated times .
the ratio of fv to fm ( fv / fm ) representing the activity of photosystem ii was used to assess the functional damage to the plants [ 22 ] .
4.5 .
pathogen inoculation a virulent ( 97 - 220e3 ) isolate of the blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae was used in this study .
three - week - old seedlings of control and opbp1 lines were inoculated with 97 - 220e3 at a concentration of 3x105 spores per ml , following the procedure described by sallaud et al .
[ 23 ] .
after incubation in a dark chamber ( at 22 degreesc and 95 % relative humidity ) for 24 h , plants were moved to a growth chamber and maintained at 28 degreesc with 16 h of light and 8 h of dark cycles .
disease symptoms were evaluated and photographed .
number of lesions per leaf was counted as the size of the lesions was measured .
the experiment was repeated three times in rice seedlings with similar results .
the isolate of rhizoctonia solani ( yn - 7 ) was used in this study .
three - week - old seedlings of control and opbp1 lines were inoculated with yn - 7 , following the procedure described by jia et al .
[ 24 ] .
the greenhouse temperate averaged 28 degreesc , and relative humidity was maintained within 70 % to 80 % .
lesion development was monitored starting 3 days post inoculation .
the length of the lesion was measured .
sheath blight micro - chamber inoculations were repeated twice .
4.6 .
rt - pcr analysis to remove possible dna contamination , the total rna was treated with dnase , then was heated at 70 degreesc for 10 min to inactivate the dnase , then followed by phenol - chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation .
the first strand cdnas were synthesized by using the amv reverse transcriptase system in 20 mul reactions , including 1 mug purified total rna .
after synthesis , the cdna was diluted and used as template for pcr amplifications in 50 mul standard reactions .
for rt - pcr , actin was used as internal constitutive control .
the pcr products were separated on 1.6 % w / v agarose gels , stained with ethidium bromide , and photographic images were obtained .
the primers used in the study were as followings : rice actin ( genbank accession number : ab047313 ) , osactin - f : 5 ' - ggaactggtatggtcaaggc - 3 ' and osactin - r : 5 ' - agtctcatggatacccgcag - 3 ' ; opbp1 ( genbank accession number : u81157 ) , obp1bi : 5 ' - acgaggaaaaacaaaatggattct - 3 ' and obp1r : 5 ' - atggaaacaaagagatggaattcccctat - 3 ' ; osp5cs ( genbank accession number : d49714 ) , osp5cs - f : 5 ' - tggatgtctcgtcatctcaact - 3 ' and osp5cs - r : 5 ' - aagccaagacagcagccttcac - 3 ' ; osgstu1 ( genbank accession number : af050102 ) , osgstu1 - f : 5 ' - aagctatagccatggcggaggag - 3 ' and osgstu1 - r : 5 ' - tgcaacttcgcatccaccgatctac - 3 ' ; osim1 ( genbank accession number : af085174 ) , osim1 - f : 5 ' - gggagaaggagcagaccga - 3 ' and osim1 - r : 5 ' - gccacccaattcttccatg - 3 ' .
transcript abundance of osactin in leaves was 25cycles of pcr amplification .
5. conclusions opbp1 gene , an ap2 / erf transcription factor of tobacco , seems to be an important determinant of biotic and abiotic stress response in plants .
transgenic rice plants with overexpressed opbp1 gene accumulated higher levels of osp5cs , osgstu1 and osim1 , which are reported to be involved in the signaling pathways of salt or oxidative stress tolerant .
opbp1 overexpression lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt and oxidative stress , as well as to infection of magnaporthe oryzae and rhizoctonia solani pathogens .
these results suggest that expression of opbp1 gene increase the detoxification capability of rice .

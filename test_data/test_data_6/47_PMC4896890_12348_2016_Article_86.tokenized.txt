diagnosis of rickettsial retinitis remains presumptive when gold standard tests are not available or not done due to financial constrains .
history of tick bite followed by fever with skin rash particularly in winter and spring season may point towards rickettsiosis .
the absence of scarring post resolution of rickettsial retinitis suggests inner retinal involvement in contrast to toxoplasmosis .
bilaterality of the disease , 2 - 4 weeks of latent period , and multifocal nature of retinitis lesions ( cotton wool spot - like lesions ) especially around the disc and posterior pole may suggest an immune response to recent systemic infection .
the use of only antibiotics or only steroids or both together for treatment of rickettsial retinitis is controversial and warrants randomized controlled trials .
keywords weil - felix test optical coherence tomography rickettsial retinitis antibiotics steroids issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 editor , we thank kaushik tripathi , rohan chawla and co - authors for their interest in our article and giving us the opportunity to re - look and clarify a few points from our work [ 1 ] .
we would like to reply to their comments in the following manner : for our study , weil - felix test ( wft ) was performed using the commercially available kit ( plasmatech , uk ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions which gives a positive result to agglutination titres of >= 160 [ 2 ] .
we are completely aware that wft is not a gold standard test to diagnose rickettsial diseases and hence , we used a term " presumed rickettsial retinitis " in the report .
multifocal retinitis post febrile illness in indian scenario is commonly due to chikungunya , dengue , west nile virus ( wnv ) and rickettsial infections .
ruling out other causes ( chikungunya , dengue , wnv ) , taking appropriate history of tick bite rather than mosquito bite and skin rashes will increase suspicion for rickettsial retinitis. of late , we processed stored serum sample of our patients of " presumed rickettsial retinitis " for wnv serology and pcr which showed negative results .
although wft is not a gold standard test , it helps to subclassify rickettsial diseases ( indian tick typhus , epidemic typhus and scrub typhus ) whereas more definite tests like igg and igm enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) and pcr need to be carried out separately for each rickettsial organism and hence the cost .
oct findings in toxoplasmosis are well described by goldenberg et al. who studied 17 active lesions in 11 eyes which showed full - thickness retinal involvement in all [ 3 ] , although exception to this can occur , especially in early presentation of toxoplasma retinitis .
the absence of scar formation or absence of significant rpe changes after resolution of rickettsial retinitis lesions may suggest inner retinal involvement in contrast to toxoplasma retinitis .
rickettsial retinitis lesions are almost always multiple in numbers and appear around the disc and at the posterior pole .
they are very much similar to cotton wool spots ( cws ) or in fact could be cws only ( as described in noninfectious hiv retinopathy [ 4 ]) .
the presence of vitritis and gross macular oedema encourages calling them retinitis lesions rather than cws .
isolation of all possible rickettsial organisms from ocular fluid was not possible in our study , but aqueous sample for pcr scrub typhus was negative in three cases. whether to continue or to restart the antibiotic treatment for rickettsial retinitis , when patients have already been treated by their physician for the fever ( generally 2 - 4 weeks prior to presentation ) , is debatable and warrants randomized control trials .
as we mentioned , bilaterality of retinitis lesions in 9 out of 10 immunocompetent patients , an interval of 2 to 4 weeks between the systemic and ocular presentation and cws - like retinitis lesions around the disc points towards an immune - driven process. whether one can detect active replicating rickettsial organisms in these retinitis lesions or not is questionable .
the possibility of a para - infectious process is more likely .
response to steroid - antibiotics versus only steroids needs to be evaluated in further studies .
we hesitate to give any strong treatment recommendation based on our report .
out of other three cases of ' steroid only ' treatment in our series , one was a pregnant lady and the other two were already on systemic steroids started elsewhere and were showing favourable response .
kyrieleis plaques as described in toxoplasmosis and acute retinal necrosis were not seen by us in the reported case series ; rather , we noticed an occluded arteriole on ffa in one of our patient ( as shown in figure 2 of the article ) [ 1 ] .
since the inclusion criterion for this study was retinitis , it is possible that we would have missed cases of rickettsial vasculitis without retinitis .
but recently , a new case of presumed rickettsial retinitis did show presence of kyrieleis plaques which was not included in the report .

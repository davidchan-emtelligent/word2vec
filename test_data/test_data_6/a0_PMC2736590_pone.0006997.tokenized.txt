2009 this is an open - access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author and source are properly credited. with recent findings on the role of reprogramming factors on stem cells , in vitro screening assays for studying ( de ) - differentiation is of great interest .
we developed a miniaturized stem cell screening chip that is easily accessible and provides means of rapidly studying thousands of individual stem / progenitor cell samples , using low reagent volumes .
for example , screening of 700,000 substances would take less than two days , using this platform combined with a conventional bio - imaging system .
the microwell chip has standard slide format and consists of 672 wells in total .
each well holds 500 nl , a volume small enough to drastically decrease reagent costs but large enough to allow utilization of standard laboratory equipment .
results presented here include weeklong culturing and differentiation assays of mouse embryonic stem cells , mouse adult neural stem cells , and human embryonic stem cells .
the possibility to either maintain the cells as stem / progenitor cells or to study cell differentiation of stem / progenitor cells over time is demonstrated .
clonality is critical for stem cell research , and was accomplished in the microwell chips by isolation and clonal analysis of single mouse embryonic stem cells using flow cytometric cell - sorting .
protocols for practical handling of the microwell chips are presented , describing a rapid and user - friendly method for the simultaneous study of thousands of stem cell cultures in small microwells .
this microwell chip has high potential for a wide range of applications , for example directed differentiation assays and screening of reprogramming factors , opening up considerable opportunities in the stem cell field .
introduction stem cells have been studied for nearly 50 years and while our understanding of them has increased immensely , major questions such as their molecular identity , level of plasticity , and role in pathological conditions and aging , still remain to be answered .
stem cells are identified by their functional characteristics ; multipotency and self - renewing capability .
in the present study , mouse - and human embryonic stem ( es ) cells and adult neural stem cells from the mouse forebrain were used .
adult neural stem cells can be maintained in culture for several passages and display multipotency by generating neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes upon differentiation .
mammalian embryonic and adult neural stem cells have been successfully isolated and maintained in vitro [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
culture conditions vary and es cells are often cultured adherently on gelatin coatings or fibroblast feeder cells , whereas adult neural stem cells are maintained as free - floating sphere - like clusters , called neurosphere ( ns ) cultures .
furthermore , maintenance of pluri - or multipotency in different stem cell populations depends on various factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
new factors are constantly connected to stem cells regulating their maintenance or differentiation , e.g. growth factors , epigenetic modifiers , neurotransmitters , and extracellular matrix proteins .
extensive studies have been aimed at finding specific combinations of factors for directed differentiation , maintenance of stem cell populations , and for the reprogramming of mature cells into induced - pluripotent cells [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
such screens may be limited by the cost of the compounds to be analyzed , whereby true low - volume - assays would enable greater numbers of parallel experiments .
as the understanding and knowledge on stem cells continue to increase , demands on the experimental tools and methods follow the same direction .
platforms that enable high throughput analysis of individual stem / progenitor cells can provide key insights into the molecular regulation of stem cell maintenance , differentiation , and the identification of stem cells [ 10 ] .
microtiter - , microwell - , or multi - well plates have long been used in research , as tools for increasing assay throughput and reduce cost .
these are typically made of polystyrene and provide from 6 to 3456 individual wells , in which the samples are mixed with reagents , agitated and incubated , either manually or with automated handling equipment .
the volumes involved in conventional microtiter formats range from 16 000 microl ( 6 well plate , greiner ) , 400 microl ( 96 well plate , nunc ) , down to 2.6 microl ( 3456 well plate , aurora ) .
the 96 - or 384 - well plates are the most frequently used formats .
however , the analysis of individual stem cells within such formats is far from optimal .
to better control the cellular microenvironment , further miniaturization by microsystem technologies [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] can provide supplementary culturing - and analysis platforms for stem cell research [ 13 ] - [ 18 ] , .
the aim of this work was to provide a miniaturized in vitro assay for multi - parallel culturing and analysis of single stem cells , by combining chip - based methods with conventional microwell plate technologies .
the significant single - cell variability within a cell population is widely studied , for example in the isolation of stem cells and their clones .
in order to better understand cell heterogeneity and detect rare interesting cells in a large population , methods that are capable of rapidly analyzing single cells are desired .
cell chips consisting of many small wells are common approaches for studying single cells , where many of the methods involve uncontrolled , random settling of cells into microwells [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] .
surface micropatterning [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] and microfluidics [ 25 ] - [ 30 ] are two other promising ways to investigate stem cells , as compared to conventional bulk analysis .
examples of stem cell studies using microdevices are culturing of homogeneously sized embryoid bodies ( ebs ) [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , 3 - d microwell culture of human embryonic stem ( es ) cells [ 33 ] , and neurosphere ( ns ) cultures .
for in vitro neurosphere formation assays ; clonality is crucial and investigations on movement - induced aggregation of clonal spheres and possible solutions thereof have been investigated earlier in bulk samples as well as in miniaturized systems [ 34 ] - [ 36 ] .
general obstacles of existing cell chips are controlled single - cell seeding , clonality assurance , long - term cell culturing and cell maintenance , i.e. to ensure that the exact same cell is being studied over time .
we developed a method where thousands of single , or a controlled number of , stem cells and their neural differentiation can be studied individually on a microwell chip with high density of wells .
the chip has previously been used for heterogeneity analysis of single carcinoma cells and their clonal expansion [ 37 ] .
the slide - formed chip ( 26x76 mm ) consists of 672 microwells where each well holds 500 nl ; a volume that is small enough to dramatically decrease reagent costs but large enough to allow utilization of standard laboratory equipment .
controlled cell seeding and culturing is achieved by the unique compatibility of the microwell chip and conventional flow cytometric cell - sorting instruments , facilitating clonal assays .
further strengths are the i ) relatively large size of the microwells ( 650x650 microm ) for long - term culturing , ii ) reversibly sealed wells which hinder cell migration and evaporation , iii ) good optical properties and compatibility with imaging and screening systems , and iv ) user - friendly handling of the chip .
the microwell chip presented here gives the opportunity to monitor and manipulate stem cells in a new way , enabling individual treatment , clonal assays , and maintenance and differentiation studies of stem cells in high throughput .
results chip properties and liquid handling a general method using a miniaturized microwell chip for stem cell studies and screening applications is schematically described in figure 1 .
random cell seeding by manual pipetting can be utilized ( fig. 1a , right ) , either by addressing individual wells or by addressing all wells simultaneously .
in the latter , a volume of 800 microl of cell suspension is dispensed onto the chip , spread over the chip area and the cells are randomly settled in the wells by adding a cell culture top membrane .
an alternative seeding option is controlled automated cell seeding in accordance with the well - known procedure of clonal assays using flow cytometric cell - sorting [ 38 ] ( fig. 1a , left ) .
the compatibility of the microwell chip presented here and flow cytometric cell - seeding , is unique for this particular chip in contrast to other stem cell chips and greatly increases the probability of achieving true clonality , as described in detail earlier [ 37 ] .
each cell or clone has its own microchamber without contact and risk of aggregation with neighboring cells or clones ( fig. 1b ) .
the cells can be analyzed instantly or subjected to short - or long - term culturing ( fig. 1c ) .
rinsing the chip with fresh culture medium can easily perform change of medium .
live - cell imaging or endpoint analysis and detection can be carried out using automated imaging systems or standard microscopy ( fig. 1d ) .

( d ) : the entire chip can be screened in a rapid manner using conventional automated imaging systems , detecting cells and clones in the 672 individual wells simultaneously .
the slide - formed chip ( 26x76 mm ) consists of 672 microwells where each well holds a total volume of 500 nl ( fig. 2a ) .
a simple and robust protocol for dispensation and aspiration of liquids in the many wells using a regular pipette was developed .
due to the shallow wells and sloped walls of the microwells , liquid could be exchanged in less than 1 min by rinsing on top of the chip .
an absorbing paper tissue was employed to empty the microwells .
the flat bottom - and top surfaces together with the cover slip thickness ( 175 microm ) of the glass bottom ( fig. 2b ) made the chip well suited for imaging .
a thin ( 200 microm ) cell culturing silicone membrane was used for high quality live cell imaging ( fig. 2b ) .
the microfabricated numbering of each well enabled cell - and well tracking on chip ( fig. 2c ) .
for automated high throughput experiments , there are commercially available robotics that can dispense liquid onto the entire chip in a couple of minutes .
hence , the microwell chip can be used both by manual and automated liquid handling .

stem cell culturing and neuronal differentiation on chip microwell chip culture of murine es , murine adult forebrain neural stem cells , and human es cells was possible both for maintenance of cells in a pluripotent state , or for differentiation into neuronal fates .
control experiments were simultaneously performed in 96 - well plates , throughout the study .
the pluripotent state was demonstrated by fixation and labeling of the cells with the pluripotency markers sox2 and oct4 , and counterstained with the nuclear stain dapi , three days after cell seeding on chip ( fig. 3 ) .
cells were immunoreactive to the pluripotency markers , demonstrating the ability to maintain pluripotency of the investigated stem cells on chip .

all micrographs were obtained using a 10x objective .
furthermore , the microwell chip proved to be suitable for culturing adult neural stem cells in the form of neurospheres , an assay often used to demonstrate self - renewal in vitro .
single adult neural stem cells were seeded followed by monitoring over a period of four days , resulting in spheres in the range of 8 - 64 cells ( fig. 4 ) .
fresh medium was added after three days to allow continued cell expansion ( fig. 4b ) .
spheres with a diameter of 500 microm should be possible to grow on chip , thereafter limited by the size of the well .
problems of movement - induced aggregation [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] and doubts of whether a sphere is clonally derived can be avoided by seeding one cell per well .
walls making up the wells prevent neighboring spheres from contact , i.e. the risk of sphere fusion and / or cell exchange between spheres is eliminated and true clonality of spheres at the end of experiment can be obtained .
even in experiments with 10 - 20 cells per well at start , the small size of each well makes it easy to keep track of each individual sphere and its expansion ( fig. 4a ) .
additionally , since the wells are too small to create any significant movements of medium and cells within the wells , movement - induced aggregation should be greatly reduced .

( b ) : close up on a single sphere , four days past passage .
micrographs were obtained using a 10x objective .
the microwell chip was confirmed useful for differentiation studies of neural stem cells .
the chip was swiftly coated with gelatin , poly - l - lysine , or poly - l - ornithine / laminin followed by seeding of mouse es cells , adult neural stem cells , or human es cells respectively .
the mouse es cells ( fig. 5 ) and human es cells ( fig. 6 ) were maintained under differentiation conditions for 9 days , followed by fixation and labeling with the neuronal marker betaiii - tubulin and counterstained with dapi .
cells that were immunoreactive to the neuronal marker were found on chip , demonstrating its potential use in differentiation assays .
based on previous cell culturing on chip , it is possible to culture cells for at least 2 - 3 weeks on the microwell chip [ 37 ] but this depends on the particular cell type being cultured .
since culture medium can be exchanged , the main limitation for long - term cell culturing is confluency .

at this time , expression of the pluripotency marker oct3 / 4 was completely lost .
the cell cultures were counterstained with the nuclear stain dapi ( blue ) .
micrographs were obtained using a 10x or 20x objective .
clonal assays on chip as an alternative to 96 - well plates , a relatively large format for small clones , the microwell chip offers a suitable well size for single - cell and clonal analysis .
a unique property of the chip is its compatibility with conventional flow cytometric cell - sorting , as compared to other cell chips .
the center - to - center distance of the microwells on the chip was designed to match the smallest movement of plate holders of conventional flow cytometer instruments .
as a proof - of - principle , fluorescence activated cell sorting ( facs ) was applied for seeding single murine es cells on the chip , using the standard plate sort fitting of the instrument , followed by clonal analysis .
two chips were seeded in parallel whereby one was fixed and analyzed on day 1 ( fig. 7a ) and the other chip was kept until day 3 ( fig. 7b ) before analysis .
to visualize the cells , the cultures were stained with antibodies against filamin ( green ) , calreticulin ( yellow ) , and tubulin ( red ) .
nuclei were stained with dapi ( blue ) .
cultured cells , forming clones , indicate the potential use of the microwell chip for high - throughput clonal assays .

discussion we describe a novel miniaturized multiwell chip for stem cell culturing and analysis as a promising tool in factor screening and stem cell research in general .
the high - density microwell chip is easy to use , provides rapid screening , and should therefore be easily adapted to a wide range of research applications .
the miniaturized format is in particular suitable for single - cell and clonal analysis , and provides more information of heterogeneous cell samples as compared to traditional bulk experiments .
moving from studying thousands of cells per sample into a few cells per sample gives better control and conditions to monitor live cells over time .
in the presented microwell chip , the wells are small enough to fit 672 wells on the same area as a standard microscopic glass slide , a major advantage in clonal assays in terms of 672 parallel experiments .
the small format is suitable both for non - fluorescent and fluorescently labeled cells , for example useful in fate mapping when examining various factors and their effect .
first and foremost , factors steering cells along certain differentiation paths are expensive .
the reaction volume in the presented chip is 0.1 % of the volume in a standard 96 - well plate , meaning a 99.9 % cost saving in reagent usage .
secondly , the high - density well format facilitates screening large numbers of cell samples simultaneously and thereby achieving a high throughput .
screening of 700,000 substances using this method would take less than two days , roughly estimated , using high - resolution data from one of the major bio - imaging systems .
for lower resolution the corresponding time is three hours for 700,000 substances , using a conventional scanner system .
third , the transparency of the glass bottom and the satisfying optical properties of the chip enable high - resolution imaging .
detection and imaging in the presented study was performed by manual microscopy in defined wells at certain time points .
automated imaging systems can be used for higher throughput and detection instruments validated so far in combination with the microwell chip are : pathway ( www.bdbiosciences.com ) , cellavista ( www.innovatis.com ) , odyssey ( www.licor.com ) , starion ( www.scienceimaging.se ) and dna microarray scanner ( www.agilent.com ) .
manual pipetting , often with the aim of addressing many wells simultaneously was used for liquid handling in the present study .
if different solutions are required in each well , an automatic dispensing unit is preferred .
examples of commercially available robotics that can efficiently dispense liquid onto the microwell chip are equator ( www.labcyte.com ) and flexdrop ( www.perkinelmer.com ) .
it should also be noted that due to the total volume of 500 nl per well , a single well can easily be targeted using a standard 0.5 microl pipette .
proliferative heterogeneity within neural progenitor cell populations is well established [ 39 ] - [ 41 ] but the source of this variation is largely unknown .
one influencing factor could be cell - cell contact and the impact of single - cell vs. high - density cell growth .
chin vi et al. demonstrated that the overall population growth was not enhanced by proximity to other cells , using a microfabricated array [ 15 ] .
nutrition uptake and cell behavior in limiting environments are other examples of experiments that should be well suited for the microwell chip presented here .
also , high - density microwell devices for successful screening of antigen - specific antibody - secreting cells have recently gained attraction , where different sizes ( typically 50 microm in well - diameter ) and number ( typically > 100,000 individual wells ) of wells harbor single [ 42 ] or clonally expanded [ 43 ] antibody - secreting cells for a faster and more efficient cell - selection than using conventional methods .
a further understanding of adult and embryonic stem cells and their role in physiological and pathological conditions would increase the possibility of their use as potential therapeutics .
being able to study stem cells clonally in miniaturized devices could be useful in a wide range of screening applications .
the presented microwell chip will probably find its most important use as an analysis platform .
as for most in vitro assays , potential problems need to be taken into account .
obviously , passaging cells is more straightforward using conventional bulk procedures .
the squared wells of the microwell chip could be a risk of increased cell positioning close to the wall , even though we have not detected such a pattern .
small wells can in some cases be difficult to handle , with regards to medium exchange , coating , or labeling .
however , the present miniaturized format was proven to be at least as simple and fast as conventional larger formats .
many assays that are run in 96 - well plates today are promising applications for the microwell chip presented here , yielding a higher throughput , lower reagent consumption , and a better control of the cellular microenvironment .
the possibility to perform pcr based genetic analysis on chip is currently under investigation , with promising results on correlation between cell culture and mutation frequency , all steps performed in individual wells on chip .
another example of research opening up for new applications would be controlled liquid handling by integrating microfluidics on this chip .
in summary , several areas of use can be foreseen .
above all , the presented microwell chip should have high potential for applications like maintaining pluripotency , inducing reprogramming to the pluripotent state , and for screening of conditions leading to differentiation of stem cells into desired cell types .
to conclude , a chip - based platform for long - term differentiation studies on mouse and human es cells and adult neural stem cells was demonstrated .
stem cells in microwell chips behave similarly to cells in conventional culturing systems , adding the advantages of small volumes , optimal imaging properties , controlled cell analysis and microenvironment , facs compatibility , and a higher throughput .
the presented microwell chip should simplify work - intensive and cost - demanding screening experiments by providing a wide range of applications within the field of stem cells , for example studying cell ( de ) - differentiation , reprogramming factors , cell heterogeneity , and cell - to - cell signaling .
materials and methods microwell chip design chip fabrication has previously been described by lindstrom et al [ 37 ] .
the outer format of the chip used in this study was that of a standard microscopic glass slide ( 26x76 mm2 ) with 672 wells .
each squared well has a bottom size of 650x650 microm2 resulting in a well volume of 500 nl. for cell culturing on chip a gas - permeable top membrane of polydimethylsiloxane ( sylgard 184 , dowcorning , midland , mi , http :// www.dowcorning.com ) was fabricated as described in detail elsewhere [ 37 ] with the only difference being the thickness of the membrane , in this study approximately 200 microm .
prior to cell culturing the chip and the top membrane were autoclaved .
es cell culture conditions e14 es cells derived from 129 / ola strain of mice [ 44 ] were maintained on 0.2 % gelatin ( sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , http :// www.sigma - aldrich.com ) coated dishes ( costar , lowell , ma , http :// www.corning.com ) in glasgow minimum essential medium ( sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( hyclone , logan , ut , http :// hyclone.com ) , 2 mm glutamax ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , http :// www.invitrogen.com ) , 1000 units of lif , 1 mm sodium pyruvate , 10 microm non - essential amino acids ( both from invitrogen ) , 50 microm beta - merchaptoethanol ( sigma ) in 37degreesc , 5 % co2 .
the es cells were passaged every second to third day using 0.05 % trypsin - edta ( invitrogen ) .

ns cultures were passaged using 0.02 % edta ( sigma ) every third to fourth day .
pre - coating of the microwell chip before cell seeding , the microwell chip was pre - coated as described below .
gelatin ( 0.2 % , sigma ) was used to coat the chip for es cells , poly - l - lysine ( 0.01 % , sigma ) was used for adult neural stem cells , and poly - l - ornithine ( 0.01 % , sigma ) and laminin ( 20 ng / ml , invitrogen ) was used before hesc seeding .
for coating with gelatin and poly - l - lysine , the required solution was added to the chip in a laminar airflow bench and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before emptying the wells through absorption on paper tissues ( precision wipes , kimtech science , ga , http :// www.kcprofessional.com ) that had been uv - treated .
for poly - l - ornithine and laminin coating , poly - l - ornithine was added to the chip and incubated for 10 min .

the chip was washed 2x with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) before cells were introduced into the microwells .
stem cell seeding and culturing on chip stem cells were cultured on un - coated or pre - coated microwell chips using materials as described above .
the cells were manually seeded into the microwells by random settling of the cells , in a concentration of 1x105 cells / ml unless stated otherwise , resulting in approximately 50 cells per well .
for automatic single - cell seeding into predefined microwells , a facs vantage se cell sorter ( bd biosciences , san diego , ca , http :// www.bdbiosciences.com ) was employed , fitted with an x / y stage for plate sorting [ 37 ] .
a top membrane was reversibly added to the chip to seal the wells , diminish evaporation , and contamination , followed by incubation at 37degreesc , 5 % co2 .
for long - term culturing and change of culture medium the top membrane was temporarily removed whereupon fresh medium was rinsed over the chip , displacing old medium in the microwells .
maintenance and differentiation of es cells on chip for mouse es cells , two parallel experiments were performed in order to i ) maintain es pluripotency and ii ) study neural es cell differentiation .
two gelatin coated microwell chips were seeded with es cells .
on the first chip , culture medium change was performed on day 2 , and fixation and labeling on day 3 .
the other chip was subjected to differentiation medium ( specified below ) on day 2 , whereby medium was changed every third day until day 9 when the chip was fixed and subjected to staining .
for induction of neural differentiation of mouse es cells , the media was replaced with ( dmem )/ f12 and neurobasal medium in a 1:1 ratio , supplemented with 1 % n2 , 2 % b - 27 , retinoic acid , human insulin , gentamycin ( all from invitrogen ) , and bovine serum albumin ( sigma ) .
for differentiation of human es cells , clusters of bg01 or bg01v2 cells were resuspended in hesc culture medium without bfgf and transferred to ultra low - attachment plates ( corning incorporated , ny , http :// www.corning.com ) for eb formation .
after three days , the resulting ebs were dissociated into smaller cell aggregates composed of 100 - 150 cells and transferred to poly - l - ornithine / laminin coated microwell chips .
to induce neural differentiation , the media was replaced with neurobasal medium supplemented with n2 and b - 27 .

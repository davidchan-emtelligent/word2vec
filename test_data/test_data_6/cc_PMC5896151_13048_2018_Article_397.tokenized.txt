background obesity has been linked to several types of cancers including ovarian cancer .
retinol binding protein 4 ( rbp4 ) is an adipokine that drives the development of hyperinsulinemia and type ii diabetes in obesity patients and animals .
previously , we have identified rbp4 as a serum marker for ovarian cancer .
here we further explored the consequence of rbp4 upregulation in ovarian cancer cells and its molecular mechanism .
results our results show that rbp4 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells to the same extent as in adipose tissues .
the overexpression of rbp4 in ovarian cancer cells promotes cancer cell migration and proliferation .
at molecular level , cancer progression factors mmp2 and mmp9 are induced in response to rbp4 overexpression .
we further investigated which signaling pathways are utilized by rbp4 to activate ovarian cancer cell migration .
we found rhoa / rock1 pathway is turned on and cyclind1 is upregulated in rbp4 overexpressed cells .
inhibition of rhoa / rock1 pathway reduces the rbp4 - induced mmp2 and mmp9 expression .
the rbp4 action is depend on its associated ligand vitamin a / retinol acid ( ra ) and possibly involves similar pathways as for conferring insulin resistance .
moreover , we show that knockdown of rbp4 significantly reduce cancer cell migration and proliferation as well as expressions of oncogenic factors .
conclusions our results indicated that rbp4 can drive ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation via rhoa / rock1 and erk pathway .
it suggests that rbp4 act as a oncogene in ovarian cancer cells .
thus , rbp4 could be a molecular bridge between obesity and cancers and a potential target for treating obese cancer patients .
keywords ovarian cancer obesity rbp4 retinol acid migration http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100001809national natural science foundation of china81571455 zhang zhenyu issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background obesity is a well - established cancer risk factor and its occurrence is strongly associated with several types of cancers , including breast , colon , endometrial , ovarian , gastric , pancreatic and liver cancers [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , the molecular mechanisms that link obesity and cancers remain largely elusive .
identifying metabolites and secreted factors that connect increased fat mass to tumorigenesis is one of the central questions .
retinol binding protein 4 ( rbp4 ) is secreted by liver and adipose tissues [ 3 , 4 ] .
rbp4 acts as the major transporter for vitamin a / retinol acid ( ra ) in serum [ 3 ] .
under normal physical conditions , ra bound rbp4 circulates together with transthyretin ( ttr ) as a holo - rbp - ttr complex [ 5 ] .
upon arrival , ra can either enter the targeted cell by passive diffusion or active transportation by stimulated by ra 6 ( stra6 ) [ 6 - 10 ] .
besides its transportation function , rbp4 has recently been recognized as an adipokine [ 4 ] .
cumulative evidences showed that overexpression of rbp4 from adipose tissues promote hyperinsulinemia and type ii diabetes [ 11 - 15 ] .
several pathways have been identified mediate rbp4 signaling [ 16 ] .
ra and its oxidative products can activate retinoic acid receptors and retinoid x receptors and promote glucose production in liver [ 17 ] .
rbp4 with ra can activate stra6 , which will then recruit and activate janus kinase and the transcription factors stat3 or stat5 [ 18 ] .
rbp4 , independent of ra and stra6 , could promote pro - inflammatory responses possibly through pathways involving c - jun n - terminal protein kinase ( jnk ) 1 , jnk2 , or toll - like receptor [ 19 ] .
ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of gynecological cancer in the world [ 20 ] .
ovarian cancers have a high occurrence rate in obesity peoples and obesity has been shown to promote ovarian cancer metastatic [ 21 ] .
recently , we found that rbp4 level is highly upregulated in ovarian cancer serum samples [ 22 ] .
overexpression of rbp4 had also been reported in liver , bone , and colon cancer cells [ 23 - 27 ] .
however , the consequence of rbp4 overexpression on cancers and the mechanism of action of rbp4 in cancers are not clear .
we here investigated whether rbp4 is a tumorgenic factor that connects obesity and ovarian cancer .
our data showed that rbp4 was up - regulated in ovarian cancer cells and overexpression of rbp4 promoted cancer cell migration .
the mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 , key factors in cancer metastasis , were induced by rbp4 overexpression .
we further identified rhoa / rock1 pathway as mediators for rbp4 action .
rhoa and rock1 were overexpressed in response to rbp4 and inhibition of rhoa / rock1 reduced mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression .
the rbp4 action was dependent on its associated ligand ra. moreover , knockdown of rbp4 greatly reduced cancer migration .
our data not only established rbp4 as a direct linkage between obesity and ovarian cancer , but also suggested rbp4 was a possible target for cancer treatment , especially in those associated with obesities .

results expression of rbp4 in ovarian cancer tissues and obesity tissues we first detected the rbp4 expression levels in ovarian cancer tissues .
western blot results showed that the rbp4 protein was upregulated by nearly 4 - fold in ovarian cancer tissues comparing to the benign ovarian tissues ( fig. 1a - b ) .
the higher expression of rbp4 was further verified by qrt - pcr experiment ( fig. 1c ) and immunostaining ( fig. 1d ) .
the mrna level of rbp4 , as revealed by qrt - pcr , was twofold higher in ovarian cancer tissues comparing to the benign ovarian tissues ( fig. 1c ) .
the rbp4 level in cancer tissues , shown in brown , was significantly increased comparing to the benign ovarian tissues , which only exhibited weak staining ( fig. 1d ) .
as a control , we created obese rat model by fed with a high - fat group rats and measured the expression level of rbp4 in ovarian tissues .
similarly as in previous report [ 4 ] , the rbp4 level was elevated in ovarian tissues from the high fat ( hf ) group compared to the normal control ( nc ) group ( fig. 1e - h ) .
the extent of rbp4 overexpression was comparable in ovarian cancer cells and in adipose tissues. fig. 1 expression of rbp4 in ovarian cancers and high fat group .

* , p < 0.01 rbp4 promotes migration and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells we used ovarian cancer cell line a2780 and skov3 to test the effects of rbp4 expression on ovarian cancer .
firstly , we confirmed the effect of rbp4 overexpression and knocked down in a2780 and skov3 cells ( fig. 2a ) .
then the transwell migration assays showed that rbp4 overexpression can greatly enhance cancer cell migration in both cell lines ( fig. 2b ) .
in contrast , cancer cells were less mobile when rbp4 was knocked down with sirna ( fig. 2b ) .
we then carried out proliferation assay to explore the effect of rbp4 expression on cell proliferation in a2780 and skov3 cells .
the results showed that ovarian cancer cells with rbp4 overexpression grows faster than control cells , while the rbp4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation ( fig. 2c ) .
finally , we analyzed the cell cycle distribution with respect to rbp4 expression .
more cells were in s and g2 / m phase when rbp4 overexpressed ( fig. 2d ) .
collectively , these results indicated that rbp4 promotes migration and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. fig. 2 rbp4 promotes ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation. a. western blot analysis of rbp4 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells. b. cell migration assays of rbp4 overexpression , control and rbp4 knockdown cells. c. cell proliferation profile of cells with rbp4 overexpression , control and rbp4 knockdown cells. d. cell cycle distribution of cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , control and rbp4 knockdown cells .
* , p < 0.01 rbp4 induces migration - related genes expression in ovarian cancer cells we have shown that rbp4 overexpression can greatly stimulate ovarian cancer cell migration .
then , we tested the expression level of mmp2 and mmp9 , which are essential for cancer metastasis [ 31 ] .
both protein and mrna levels of mmp2 and mmp9 were elevated when rbp4 overexpressed in skov3 and a2780 cells ( fig. 3 ) .
the observation further confirmed the effect of rbp4 expression on cancer cell migration. fig. 3 mmp2 and mmp9 expression is elevated by rbp4. a. western blot analysis of mmp2 and mmp9 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells. b. qpcr analysis of mmp2 and mmp9 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells .
* , p < 0.01 rbp4 activates rhoa / rock1 pathways and cyclin d1 to explore how rbp4 exerts its effect on cancer cells , we tested the expression level of several key players in tumorigenesis related signaling .
rbp4 overexpression stimulated the expression of both rhoa and rock1 .
in rbp4 overexpression groups , the rhoa and rock1 levels were elevated at both mrna and protein level ( fig. 4a , b ) .
moreover , the p - rhoa level was also increased , revealed by western blotting .
similarly , the cyclin d1 expression was promoted at both mrna and protein level .
previously , overexpressed phospho - erk triggerd ovarian cancer cell migration [ 32 , 33 ] .
although the erk expression level remained unchanged upon rbp4 overexpression , the phosphorylated erk had been elevated by rbp4 overexpression ( fig. 4c , d ) .
interestingly , suppression of rbp4 expression significantly reduced the level of rhoa / rock1 as well as cyclin d1 comparing to control group ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 expression of major tumorigenic signaling factors in response to rbp4 expression. a. western blotting analysis of rhoa , p - rhoa and rock1 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells. b. qpcr analysis of rhoa and rock1 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells. c. western blotting analysis of erk , p - erk and cyclind1 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells. d. qpcr analysis of erk and cyclind1 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells .
* , p < 0.01 rbp4 action is partially dependent on rhoa1 / rock pathway rock1 inhibitor y - 27632 had been shown to effectively inhibit rock1 and its associated pathways [ 34 ] .
to test if rbp4 induced cancer cell migration is rhoa / rock1 dependent , we added y - 27632 to our rbp4 overexpression cells .
y - 27632 can effectively reduce the mmp - 2 / mmp9 expression level even when rbp4 overexpressed .
however , the level of mmp2 / mmp9 with y - 27632 was still higher than control group .
the results indicated that the rbp4 action was partially depending on rock1 pathway ( fig. 5a and b ). fig. 5 rbp4 induced mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 overexpression is partially dependent on rhoa / rock1 pathway. a. effect of rock1 inhibitor y - 27632 on mmp2 and mmp9 expression examined by western blotting. b. effect of rock1 inhibitor y - 27632 on mmp2 and mmp9 expression examined by qpcr .
the cells were treated with y - 27632 ( 10 mum ) for 24 h before harvesting .
* , p < 0.01 rbp4 action is dependent on ra rbp4 is a major ra transport protein [ 3 ] .
we tested whether the rbp4 effect on ovarian cancer cells is ra dependent .
in the absence of ra , the rbp4 overexpression had moderate stimulation on rhoa / rock1 and cyclin d1 expression ( fig. 6a , b ) .
when ra was added , the rbp4 effect was stimulated .
as a control , ra had little effect when rbp4 is suppressed .
ra was partially transported through membrane transporter stra6 and rbp4 - ra complex had been shown to activate stra6 and its associated signaling pathways [ 6 - 10 ] .
we tested the expression level of stra6 in ovarian cancer cells with qrt - pcr .
the stra6 mrna level stayed the same in either rbp4 overexpression or knockdown cells ( fig. 6c ). fig. 6 rbp4 action is dependent on ra. a. western blot analysis of rhoa , p - rhoa and rock1 levels in cells with or without ra. b. western blot analysis of erk , p - erk and cyclind1 levels in cells with or without ra. c. qpcr analysis of stra6 levels in cells with flag - rbp4 overexpression , rbp4 knockdown and control cells .
* , p < 0.01 discussion obese patients are associated with high cancer risk , poor prognosis and reduced response to anti - cancer therapies [ 1 , 2 ] .
obesity is intrinsically linked with metabolic syndrome that can indirectly promote cancers as metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer .
especially for ovarian cancer , obesity has been shown to promote cancer metastasis [ 21 ] .
besides that obesity can indirectly affect cancer metastasis through increasing lipogenesis , enhancing vascularity , and decreasing infiltration [ 21 ] .
here , we established a direct molecular linkage between adipokine rbp4 and ovarian cancer .
rbp4 is a well - established obesity factors that is overexpressed by adipose tissues [ 4 ] .
we proved that high level of rbp4 can stimulate migration and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells .
the overexpression of rbp4 stimulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 , which degraded extracellular matrix and enabled cancer cells migration .
moreover , rbp4 highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and high level of rbp4 had been documented in ovarian patient 's serum samples [ 22 ] .
we thus proposed that high level of rbp4 , either from adipose tissues or cancer tissues , can promote cancer metastasis and obesity signaling , vice versa .
although currently lack of clinical data , it would be interesting to survey if ovarian cancer patients have a high rate of obesity and insulin resistance .
rbp4 and its associated ra have been shown to trigger several downstream pathways to confer insulin resistance [ 16 - 19 ] .
the pathways could also be shared in promoting cancer metastasis .
the effect of rbp4 on tumor metastasis is ra dependent .
ra has broad metabolic roles including stimulating lipogenesis [ 35 ] , which has been shown to promote ovarian cancer metastasis [ 21 ] .
it has been documented that rbp4 bound ra , but not apo rbp4 can induce signaling of stra6 [ 18 ] .
the stra6 expression and its signaling has been proposed drive oncogenic transformation of cancer cells [ 34 ] .
stra6 expressed in the ovarian cancer cell lines , although its level was not affected by rbp4 .
stra6 could mediate , at least part of the rbp4 effect .
circulating rbp4 - ra was associated with their partner protein ttr [ 5 ] , which inhibited the rbp4 - ra triggered stra6 signaling [ 7 ] .
to our knowledge , there is no correlation of expression level of ttr with ovarian cancer .
it is quite likely that when rbp4 overexpressed , the ttr was not enough to block stra6 signaling even stra6 level remained unchanged .
on the other hand , rbp4 itself without ra can still promote metastasis , although to a lesser degree .
it has been shown rbp4 , independent of ra and stra6 , can induce pro - inflammation reaction [ 19 ] .
adding to the existing knowledge , we showed that rhoa / rock1 pathway was turned on in response to rbp4 overexpression .
rhoa / rock1 pathway played pivot roles in cell morphogenesis , adhesion , and motility and was often activated in malignant cancers [ 36 ] .
previous reports had shown that inhibition of rhoa / rock1 suppressed mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 action [ 37 - 39 ] .
consistently , we observed that inhibiting rhoa / rock1 pathway with rock1 inhibitor y - 27632 can reduce rbp4 induced mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 overexpression , indicating that the migration effect of rbp4 was mediated by rhoa / rock1 pathway .
however , how rbp4 activated rhoa / rock1 pathway was less clear .
considering rbp4 was mainly a secretive protein , novel membrane receptors was possibly involved in promoting rbp4 signaling .
further studies were in demand to fully elucidating the rbp4 signaling pathways that related to cancers .
we observed that knockdown of rbp4 can greatly suppress ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation .
considering rbp4 as a circulating protein , targeting rbp4 could be a relative easy option for ovarian cancer treatment , especially those associated with obesities .
conclusion in conclusion , this study described the function of rbp4 in driving ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation .
moreover , the underlying molecular mechanism of rbp4 was activation of rhoa / rock1 pathway and cyclind1 expression .
therefore , rbp4 could be a molecular bridge between obesity and cancers and a potential target for treating obese cancer patients .

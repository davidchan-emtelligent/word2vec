chronic inflammation is a hallmark of hiv infection .
eicosanoids reflect inflammation , oxidant stress , and vascular health and vary by sex and metabolic parameters .
raltegravir ( ral ) is an hiv - 1 integrase inhibitor that may have limited metabolic effects .
we assessed urinary f2 - isoprostanes ( f2 - isops ) , prostaglandin e2 ( pge - m ) , prostacyclin ( pgi - m ) , and thromboxane b2 ( txb2 ) in hiv - infected women switching to ral - containing antiretroviral therapy ( art ) .
thirty - seven women ( ral = 17 ; pi / nnrti = 20 ) with a median age of 43 years and bmi 32 kg / m2 completed week 24 .
txb2 increased in the ral versus pi / nnrti arm (+ 0.09 versus - 0.02 ; p = 0.06 ) .
baseline pgi - m was lower in the ral arm ( p = 0.005 ) ; no other between - arm cross - sectional differences were observed .
in the pi / nnrti arm , 24 - week visceral adipose tissue change correlated with pgi - m ( rho = 0.45 ; p = 0.04 ) and txb2 ( rho = 0.44 ; p = 0.005 ) changes , with a trend seen for pge - m ( rho = 0.41 ; p = 0.07 ) .
in an adjusted model , age >= 50 years ( n = 8 ) was associated with increased pge - m ( p = 0.04 ) .
in this randomized trial , a switch to ral did not significantly affect urinary eicosanoids over 24 weeks .
in women continuing pi / nnrti , increased visceral adipose tissue correlated with increased pgi - m and pge - m. older age (>= 50 ) was associated with increased pge - m. relationships between aging , adiposity , art , and eicosanoids during hiv - infection require further study .
1. introduction fat redistribution in hiv - infected patients is associated with antiretroviral therapy ( art ) , including protease inhibitors ( pi ) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( nnrti ) [ 1 , 2 ] .
central fat accumulation or lipohypertrophy may be more common in women [ 3 , 4 ] and has been associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities and inflammation in hiv - infected persons on art [ 5 - 9 ] .
chronic hiv infection is also associated with persistent inflammation [ 10 ] , and treating hiv infection improved endothelial function in treatment - naive subjects with low cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) risk [ 11 ] .
given the complex interactions between chronic hiv infection and art and the likelihood that traditional framingham prediction may underestimate cardiovascular risk in hiv - infected persons on art [ 12 , 13 ] , novel biomarkers are needed to assess metabolic risk in hiv infection and response to interventions .
eicosanoids are endogenous products of arachidonic acid metabolism involved in oxidant stress , inflammation , and endothelial function , all of which are important in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease pathogenesis [ 14 ] .
biologic properties and metabolism of eicosanoids are complex and are reviewed elsewhere [ 15 - 17 ] .
briefly , during cellular stress , membrane phospholipids containing arachidonic acid are subjected to nonenzymatic peroxidation by free radical species to generate a variety of biologically active oxidation products , including f2 - isoprostanes ( f2 - isops ) which can cause vasoconstriction , platelet aggregation , and oxidative tissue damage .
arachidonic acid can also be released from membrane phospholipids and metabolized by oxidizing enzymes during cellular stress .
metabolism by cyclooxygenase ( cox ) enzymes yields a family of products termed prostaglandins ( pgs ) , including pge2 , which causes vasodilation or vasoconstriction and / or vascular smooth muscle proliferation ; thromboxane a2 ( txa2 ) , which causes vasoconstriction , platelet activation , and chemotaxis ; and prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) which causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation and vascular smooth muscle proliferation. with the exception of f2 - isops [ 15 ] , parent eicosanoids are unstable in and cannot be reliably assayed from plasma .
prostaglandin metabolites , as well as f2 - isops , are stable in urine and accurate indices of endogenous production [ 18 - 21 ] .
the primary pge2 urinary metabolite is 11 - alpha - hydroxy - 9,15 - dioxo - 2,3,4,5 - tetranor - prostane - 1,20 - dioic acid ( pge - m ) , while the major metabolites used to assess txa2 and pgi2 production are 11 - dehydro - thromboxane b2 ( txb2 ) and 2,3 - dinor - 6 - keto - pgf1alpha ( pgi - m ) , respectively .
urinary assays for pge - m and f2 - isop have low intra - individual variation over one year [ 22 ] .
in hiv - negative populations , urinary f2 - isop correlates with traditional cvd risk factors [ 23 ] and surrogate measures of cvd including brachial artery flow - mediated dilation and carotid intima media thickness [ 24 , 25 ] .
in obese children and adolescents , plasma f2 - isop was positively correlated with visceral adipose tissue ( vat ) , a marker of cvd risk [ 26 ] .
cigarette smoking is also associated with higher eicosanoids [ 27 - 30 ] .
in hiv - infected persons , cross - sectional studies to date have identified associations between higher f2 - isop and lipoatrophy , lactic acidosis , virologic suppression on art , heavy smoking , higher body mass index ( bmi ) and waist circumference , elevated liver transaminases and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) rna , and female sex [ 31 - 35 ] .
early analyses suggested higher f2 - isop in persons receiving efavirenz or zidovudine [ 32 ] , and lower levels in those on nevirapine compared with other art [ 34 ] but consistent associations with specific art drugs or classes have not been seen .
it is not yet clear why f2 - isop levels are consistently higher in women ( hiv - infected and uninfected ) than in men .
a recent study of women in haiti found higher levels of cervical cox - 2 and urinary pge - m in hiv - infected women than in uninfected women and a positive correlation between systemic pge - m and both plasma hiv rna and cervical cox - 2 levels [ 36 ] .
raltegravir ( ral ) is an hiv - 1 integrase inhibitor that has not been associated with metabolic perturbations or fat redistribution during short - or long - term therapy [ 37 - 39 ] .
a randomized , open label study was designed to assess the effects of switching from pi - or nnrti - based art to a ral - based regimen in women with lipohypertrophy and suppressed hiv - 1 rna on stable therapy [ 40 ] .
adipose tissue volumes by computerized tomography ( ct ) , anthropometrics , and fasting metabolic parameters were performed .
the objectives of these secondary analyses were to determine ( a ) the 24 - week change in f2 - isop and other urinary eicosanoid metabolites and ( b ) correlations between 24 - week changes in f2 - isop , other urinary eicosanoid metabolites , and changes in vat , the primary outcome of the parent study .
we hypothesized that urinary f2 - isop and other eicosanoid metabolites would decrease after 24 weeks in women switching to ral compared to those continuing a pi / nnrti and that these decreases would correlate with decreased vat .
2. materials and methods complete methods for the parent study have been published previously [ 40 ] .
briefly , women with hiv - 1 rna < 50 copies / ml , stable art including two nrtis ( tenofovir or abacavir and emtricitabine or lamivudine ) plus a pi or nnrti , and central adiposity ( waist circumference > 94 cm or waist : hip > 0.88 ) were enrolled at five centers in north america from september 2008 to july 2010 and randomized 1 : 1 to switch their pi / nnrti to open label ral 400 mg twice daily ( ral arm ) or continue to present art for 24 weeks ( pi / nnrti arm ) .
relevant exclusion criteria included current use of metformin , thiazolidinediones , or androgen therapy , use of growth hormone or growth hormone - releasing factor in the six months prior to screening , change or initiation of lipid - lowering therapy in the three months prior to screening , and intent to significantly modify diet or exercise habits during the study .
the primary endpoint of the parent trial was between - group change in percent of vat volume 24 weeks following a switch to ral versus continued pi or nnrti .
all study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions , and all subjects provided informed consent prior to initiation of study procedures .
procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the helsinki declaration of the world medical association .
2.1 .
assessments 2.1.1 .
anthropometric measurements visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( vat and sat , resp. ) volume was measured via single slice l4 - l5 ct scan at weeks 0 and 24 .
scans were performed locally but standardized and read centrally by a blinded reader at the tufts university body composition center .
waist , hip , and neck circumferences were performed according to aids clinical trials group standards [ 41 ] at weeks 0 , 12 , and 24 .
2.1.2 .
laboratory assessments fasting (> 8 hours ) glucose , lipoprotein profile , high - sensitivity c reactive protein ( hscrp ) , and cd4 + t cell counts were assessed at weeks 0 , 12 , and 24 .
hiv - 1 rna ( 50 copies / ml assay sensitivity ) was measured at screening and weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 .
labs were performed at the individual sites in real - time and according to local standards .
2.1.3 .
urinary eicosanoids clean - catch urine samples were collected , and three - milliliter ( ml ) aliquots of urine were stored at - 80degreesc until analysis .
samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to the vanderbilt university eicosanoid core laboratory where analyses were performed .
urinary f2 - isop , txb2 , and pgi - m were measured using gas chromatography - negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry employing stable isotope dilution methodology , as described elsewhere [ 15 , 18 , 20 , 42 ] .
pge - m was measured by liquid chromatography - mass spectroscopy ( lc - ms ) , as previously described [ 19 ] .
results for all urinary metabolites are presented as ng / mg urinary creatinine ( cr ) .
at one study site , a freezer malfunction led to transient thawing of urine samples from nine subjects .
urinary eicosanoid results from these samples were not statistically different from the other sites , and analyses with and without data from these samples were performed ( data not shown ) .
as there were no substantive changes in the results , we report results including data from all sites .
2.2 .
statistical analysis baseline characteristics of the two randomization groups were compared using the mann - whitney u test for continuous variables and fisher 's exact test for categorical variables .
analyses also included spearman correlations between continuous baseline and 24 - week change variables .
median values and interquartile ranges ( iqr ) are reported for continuous variables , and percentages are reported for categorical data .
comparison of median between - group 24 - week change scores for eicosanoids was performed using the wilcoxon signed - rank test .
the primary analysis was as - treated , excluding subjects who did not remain on the study regimen and / or did not have an observed primary endpoint .
generalized linear models assessed associations between eicosanoid changes and study arm , adjusting for baseline pi use , bmi , smoking status , study site , and age (>= 50 versus < 50 years ) .
all statistical tests were two - sided with a nominal p level of 0.05 .
given the exploratory nature of these analyses , we did not adjust results for multiple testing .
data analysis and management was performed using sas 9.2 ( sas institute , inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
3. results 3.1 .
baseline demographics sixty - one women were screened and 39 enrolled in the trial .
eighteen subjects were randomized to the ral arm and 21 to continue pi / nnrti .
one subject from each arm withdrew for reasons unrelated to the study intervention [ 40 ] , leaving 37 subjects who completed the week 24 primary endpoint .
complete demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of the 37 participants included in the as - treated analysis are provided in table 1 .
at baseline , the study groups were well balanced , with the exception of the pi / nnrti arm having a higher rate of current smoking ( 60 % versus 24 % ; p = 0.045 ) .
the median age was 43 years , bmi 32 kg / m2 , and 75 % of subjects self - identified as black or hispanic .
sixty - two percent of subjects were on a pi at entry ( versus 38 % nnrti ) , and the most commonly prescribed nrti was tenofovir ( 78 %) .
3.2 .
baseline urinary eicosanoids baseline median ( iqr ) urinary f2 - isop , pge - m , pgi - m , and txb2 ( ng / mg cr ) were 2.14 ( 1.49 - 3.16 ) , 8.07 ( 4.47 - 10.56 ) , 0.10 ( 0.06 - 0.15 ) , and 0.46 ( 0.25 - 0.73 ) , respectively ( table 1 ) .
when comparing study arms , baselines pgi - m , pge - m , and txb2 were all lower , and f2 - isop was higher in the ral arm ( table 1 ) , but only pgi - m was statistically different ( p = 0.005 ) .
baseline pge - m tended to be higher in current smokers ( p = 0.1 ; data not shown ) .
eicosanoid levels also tended to differ by baseline nrti , with women receiving abacavir having consistently lower levels ( figure 1 ) , including statistically significantly lower f2 - isop ( p = 0.05 ; figure 1 ( a )) and txb2 ( p = 0.04 ; figure 1 ( d )) levels .
3.3 .
baseline correlations between urinary eicosanoids and demographic and metabolic factors statistically significant correlations were observed at baseline with pge - m and txb2 .
pge - m was positively correlated with age ( rho = 0.34 ; p = 0.04 ) and negatively correlated with body weight ( rho = - 0.35 ; p = 0.03 ) .
txb2 was positively correlated with vat : sat and vat : total adipose tissue and negatively correlated with sat , body weight , bmi , and hip and neck circumferences ( rho = - 0.37 to - 0.46 ; p = 0.004 to 0.02 ) .
none of the urinary eicosanoids were correlated with fasting lipids , glucose , insulin resistance , or hscrp in this study population at baseline ( data not shown ) .
3.4 .
changes in urinary eicosanoids by study arm median 24 - week urinary eicosanoid levels and changes from baseline are shown in figure 2 and table 2 .
over 24 weeks , only pgi - m in ral - treated subjects demonstrated a statistically significant within - group change ( p = 0.04 ; figure 2 ( c )) .
txb2 increased in the ral arm and decreased in the pi / nnrti arm (+ 0.09 [ - 0.04 , + 0.13 ] versus - 0.02 [ - 0.20 , + 0.03 ] ; figure 2 ( d )) , but this difference was of borderline statistical significance ( between - group p = 0.06 ) .
there were no other statistically significant differences between or within study arms over 24 weeks .
age >= 50 years at baseline was associated with an increase in pge - m ( median change + 3.9 versus - 1.3 in subjects < 50 years of age ; p = 0.05 ; figure 3 ) .
in the pi / nnrti arm , 24 - week vat change positively correlated with changes in pgi - m ( rho = 0.45 ; p = 0.04 ) and txb2 ( rho = 0.44 ; p = 0.05 ) , with a similar trend seen for pge - m ( rho = 0.41 ; p = 0.07 ) .
among persons in the ral arm , the change in pge - m correlated with an increase in hdl cholesterol ( rho = 0.56 ; p = 0.02 ) ; this correlation was not observed in the pi / nnrti arm ( rho = 0.17 ; p = 0.48 ) .
no other statistically significant correlations between lipids and urinary eicosanoids were seen .
changes in eicosanoid levels over 24 weeks were not statistically different by baseline nrti ( abacavir versus tenofovir ; data not shown ) .
3.5 .
adjusted analyses of changes in urinary eicosanoids changes in urinary eicosanoids from baseline to 24 weeks were assessed in multivariate models adjusting for study arm ( ral versus pi / nnrti ) , baseline bmi , age , pi use , smoking status , and study site .
age >= 50 years ( n = 8 ) was associated with 24 - week pge - m increase ( beta = 8.3 [ 95 % ci 0.3 , 16.3 ] ; p = 0.04 ) , independent of the covariates above ( table 3 ) .
no baseline factors were significantly associated with changes in other urinary eicosanoids ( table 3 ) .
4. discussion in these hiv - infected women with central adiposity and suppressed hiv rna on art , switching pi - or nnrti - based art to ral did not have significant effects on urinary eicosanoids over 24 weeks .
overall , f2 - isop , pge - m , and txb2 levels were higher and pgi - m levels were lower than published levels reported in healthy adults [ 15 , 18 - 20 , 43 , 44 ] .
although formal comparisons were not performed , urinary f2 - isop ( lower ) , pge - m ( higher ) , and txb2 ( higher ) levels also differed from those observed in previously studied hiv - infected women who were younger and had lower bmi [ 33 ]. of note , several of the markers differed - - though not with statistical significance - - at baseline between the two study arms .
given known effects of smoking on these biomarkers [ 27 - 29 ] , this difference may have been driven in part by the significantly greater number of smokers randomized to the pi / nnrti arm , and this may therefore have limited our capacity to identify differences in changes over time or due to ral switch .
although baseline pge - m tended to be higher in current smokers ( n = 16 ; median [ iqr ] 9.9 [ 4.9 - 14.4 ]) than nonsmokers ( n = 21 ; median [ iqr ] 7.9 [ 4.0 - 10.0 ] ; p = 0.11 ) , in a multivariate model , neither current smoking nor study arm was significantly associated with 24 - week change in pge - m and did not attenuate the relationship between age and change in pge - m. additionally , f2 - isop , which is increased in hiv - infected and uninfected smokers , tended to be higher in smokers at baseline ( p = 0.06 ) but was not significantly higher in the pi / nnrti arm .
age and bmi were lower and higher in the ral than the pi / nnrti arm , respectively ( table 1 ) , and though they were not statistically different , we did include these as covariates in adjusted models .
in primary analyses , women in the switch arm had significant improvements in total and ldl cholesterol but did not have a statistically significant improvement in vat compared to women continuing an nnrti or pi [ 40 ] .
they also had a significant decrease in soluble cd14 , a marker of monocyte activation [ 45 ] .
a recent analysis of extensively treatment experienced , predominantly male , subjects switching enfuvirtide to ral in france reported significant 24 - week decreases in interleukin - 6 , d - dimer , and hscrp [ 46 ] that were not observed in these less treatment - experienced women with central adiposity [ 45 ] .
in subjects remaining on pi / nnrti , increasing vat was marginally correlated with increasing pgi - m and pge - m over 24 weeks of follow - up , suggesting a relationship between these markers and central adiposity that was altered by a switch to ral .
older age (>= 50 years ) at enrollment was associated with an increase in pge - m independent of study arm , smoking status , pi use at baseline , or other factors .
urinary eicosanoids other than txb2 were not significantly associated with bmi at baseline .
this was unexpected given associations with f2 - isop and txb2 in prior cross - sectional studies of hiv - infected persons [ 33 , 34 ] , and this may be due to the inclusion of both males and females in prior analyses and / or the high prevalence of obesity and relative lack of normal bmi ranges in this study population .
this is the first study to prospectively assess the effects of an art switch on urinary eicosanoid metabolites .
the small sample size of our study and the imbalance of smokers in the pi / nnrti arm likely limited our ability to detect differences between study arms .
nonetheless , intriguing trends and preliminary associations were noted .
although not routinely measured in clinical practice , eicosanoids are known markers of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk in hiv - negative populations .
in particular , f2 - isop has been associated with cvd disease risk factors , hscrp , carotid intima medial thickness , coronary artery calcium , and angiographic coronary artery obstruction [ 23 , 24 , 47 ] .
urinary txb2 was associated with a composite clinical cardiovascular outcome [ 48 ] .
pge2 is a complex mediator of inflammation and vasodilation with variable effects on vascular tone depending on the tissue and prostanoid receptor [ 49 ] .
increased pge - m has also been associated with malignancies in hiv - negative populations [ 50 - 53 ] , and urinary pge - m correlated with plasma hiv rna and cervical cox - 2 levels in a recent study of haitian women [ 36 ] .
it was notable that baseline f2 - isop and txb2 were lower in subjects on abacavir .
abacavir exposure has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hiv - infected persons [ 54 ] , but the association has not been consistent [ 55 ] .
although potential mechanism ( s ) are not clearly defined , recent studies have reported abnormal platelet reactivity with abacavir [ 56 , 57 ] .
to our knowledge , txb2 has not been assessed in these or other studies .
lower f2 - isop in these abacavir - treated subjects and in a prior cross - sectional analysis of men and women [ 33 ] suggests that if there is excess cardiovascular risk due to abacavir , it is independent of lipid peroxidation - related pathways ; prospective studies would be needed to determine this .
due to providers' knowledge of potential cardiovascular risk with abacavir and risk of renal toxicity with tenofovir df , it is also possible that abacavir use is simply a marker of some other unmeasured factors associated with risk for these conditions and lower urinary eicosanoid levels .
in addition to the qualifications above , this analysis has other limitations that should be noted .
use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaid ) was not an exclusion criterion for the parent study , and detailed information on dosing was not collected .
given the even distribution of nsaid use across study arms ( table 1 ) , we did not adjust for this variable in multivariate models and do not believe it would explain differential associations within or between groups .
neither menopausal status nor sex hormone levels were ascertained as part of this study .
based on data from hiv - infected women [ 58 ] , the age distribution of our population suggests the majority of subjects were pre - or perimenopausal .
the association between age and pge - m may have been due to postmenopausal changes in the older women (>= 50 years ) .
the number of older women included in this study was small .
platelet reactivity assays were not performed , so relationships between eicosanoids and platelet function cannot be determined .
ct scan was used to assess sat , so we were unable to fully assess peripheral ( limb ) lipoatrophy .
finally , this analysis may have been too small and / or of insufficient duration of follow - up to detect meaningful changes in eicosanoids .
additional studies and longer - term follow - up in hiv - infected persons are needed to further elucidate the role of eicosanoids in metabolic and other aging - related comorbidities and determine their role as useful clinical biomarkers .

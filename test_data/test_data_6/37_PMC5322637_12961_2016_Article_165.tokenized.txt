background adequate performance assessment benefits from the use of disaggregated data to allow a proper evaluation of health systems .
since routinely collected data are usually not disaggregated enough to allow stratified analyses of healthcare needs , utilisation , cost and quality across different sectors , international research projects could fill this gap by exploring means to data collection or even providing individual - level data .
the aim of this paper is therefore to ( 1 ) study the availability and accessibility of relevant european - funded health projects , and ( 2 ) to analyse their contents and methodologies .
methods the european commission public health projects database and cordis were searched for eligible projects , which were then analysed by information openly available online .
results overall , only a few of the 39 identified projects produced data useful for proper performance assessment , due to , for example , lacking available or accessible data , or poor linkage of health status to costs and patient experiences .
other problems were insufficient databases to identify projects and poor communication of project contents and results .
conclusions a new approach is necessary to improve accessibility to and coverage of data on outcomes , quality and costs of health systems enabling decision - makers and health professionals to properly assess performance .

keywords health system performance assessment eu healthcare projects individual - level data data accessibility european commission 's fp7 health programme grant agreement nr. 242099 busse reinhard issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background adequate health system performance information is required to assess whether health systems offer high - performing health services to their populations , and therefore to carry out actions to improve them [ 1 ] .
the necessary information could be collected and analysed at the national level ; however , more important conclusions can be drawn through international comparisons , ideally , if individual - level data for different diseases , interventions and providers is available to take account of variations in population groups , such as health status , income and educational level , and service delivery .
thus , a better understanding of how processes may lead to various outcomes can be achieved compared to aggregated data that only offers average values .
users of the information generated by individual - level data are not only health service researchers but all those who are interested in health systems - such as epidemiologists , economists , policy advisors or funders of research .
while individual expectations might differ , they optimally all expect to find ( access to ) data , which are individual level , longitudinal and detailed enough to allow a stratified analysis of healthcare needs , healthcare utilisations , costs and quality across different sectors and performance areas of the healthcare system , not only within individual countries , but across different countries .
however , disaggregated data are often still not routinely collected , analysed , reported and / or made available for research due to several privacy and data protection issues .
research projects could be theoretically used to fill this gap , either by exploring how individual - level data can be collected and usefully analysed or even by regularly providing such data , both within and especially across countries .
in order to facilitate the search of such health information , several eu health information systems were initiated , including cordis ( the community research and development information service for science , research and development , http :// cordis.europa.eu / projects / home _ en.html ) , the health - eu portal ( http :// ec.europa.eu / health / index _ en.htm ) , euphix ( eu public health information & knowledge system , http :// www.euphix.org /) or dg sanco 's heidi wiki ( health in europe : information and data interface ) ( https :// webgate.ec.europa.eu / sanco / heidi / index.php / main _ page ) .
in reality , however , it has often remained a challenge to maintain an overview of all data produced ( let alone to access them ) .
the health research for europe project , which aimed to synthesise results of health research from the eu 's fifth and sixth framework programmes ( fp5 and fp6 ) , criticised cordis for its insufficient data collection and compared the platform with the concept of a black hole , since " the results of projects seem to disappear " [ 2 ] when searching for eu - funded research [ 3 ] .
euphix also seems to be inadequate , since it had to be taken off - line due to discontinuity of funding .
the unavailability of adequate information thus hampers the evidence base to improve performance [ 3 ] .
furthermore , a lot of research reported in conference abstracts has never been published as full reports [ 4 ] - and to be more accurate , more than 50 % of the 3691 health - related research projects funded in fp5 and fp6 did not produce any academic output that could be traced through pubmed or google scholar [ 5 ] .
furthermore , sufficient strategies adopted by researchers to inform policymakers on their results are scarce [ 6 ] .
nevertheless , since horizon 2020 , much has moved in the right direction as the commission recognised their need to address those imperfections [ 7 ] ; however , it still remains to be asked : how much is really known about eu - funded research projects and their results ?
the compartmentalisation of health data initiatives on the one hand and poor integration between eu research programmes and national programmes on the other , result in uncoordinated health research activities between member states [ 8 ] .
to overcome this challenge , the fp7 - project euroreach ( a handbook to access health care data for cross - country comparisons of efficiency and quality ) was initiated to contribute to a more systematic performance assessment of health systems by enabling access to and use of international and national health information systems and eu research projects .
an online platform , the health data navigator ( www.healthdatanavigator.eu ) , was developed to share the output of the project online .
the present article has derived from work done in one of euroreach 's work packages , namely wp2 , which investigated international and eu health projects with the aim to improve consistency and comparability of healthcare data .
since previous research suggested to place more emphasis on the output of eu projects rather than on the inputs , we approached it yet from a different perspective with an attempt to understand and categorise the output of eu health projects in order to provide a potential user of comparative healthcare information with a data inventory to address a hypothesised research need .
thus , the following questions guide our analysis : what kind of health information are we able to find with respect to the availability and accessibility of relevant output from eu - projects ? are we able to identify any pattern in the distribution of research funding towards certain performance domains , care settings , disease groups or scope of research ?
methods we concentrated our search on eu health research projects and initiatives .
therefore , a systematic search using relevant search terms was conducted in cordis as well as in the european commission public health projects database ( http :// ec.europa.eu / health / projects / index _ en.htm ) .
the systematic search was done in two rounds of screening in each of the databases .
the search in the european commission public health projects database was filtered through the following selectable terms : ' major and chronic disease ' , ' mental health ' , ' health indicators ' , and ' data collection ' , and by year .
projects conducted between 2000 and 2003 were searched in the archive database ( http :// ec.europa.eu / health / ph _ projects / project _ previous _ en.htm ) , filtered by ' health monitoring ' and ' cancer ' , since the abovementioned terms were not selectable therein .
in cordis , the search was filtered by framework programs ( 5th , 6th , 7th ) , and refined through the generic subjects ' medicine and health ' and ' healthcare delivery / services ' .
since the cordis database search does not allow the option of filtering projects by topic ( e.g. by disease ) , the search in each framework was done by entering following keywords into the search bar : ' asthma ' , ' cardiovascular diseases ' , ' diabetes ' , ' cancer ' , ' chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ' , ' chronic disease ' , ' mental health ' , ' equity ' and ' quality ' .
in total , 63 projects ( 18 in european commission public health projects database and 45 in cordis ) were identified on project title review and information based on the following inclusion criteria , as agreed by the euroreach consortium , ( 1 ) conducted between 2000 and 2012 ( ongoing projects which started before 2000 were included ) ; ( 2 ) comparative across countries ( i.e. at least two countries involved ) ; ( 3 ) using individual - level data ( the one exception made to this rule was to include population - based cancer registry data ) ; ( 4 ) addressing asthma , cancer , cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , diabetes , mental health ; or ( 5 ) projects with no clear disease focus , but studying matters of access , efficiency , quality and / or equity in healthcare .
the projects included in the first step were then retrieved and individually screened to filter out projects not directly relevant due to no actual use of individual - level data , inappropriate study design , or simply due to lacking information .
as a result of the second screening , 34 studies were included in the analysis .
a further five studies were included after conversations with public health experts ( compare , epsilon , gbd , monica , and the oecd study ; see table 1 for full names ) .
our final analysis therefore included 39 projects .
results the selection of final projects and inherent websites is displayed in table 1 .
to capture the distribution of all projects and their distribution across associated partner countries , an overview of participation levels is provided in additional file 1 .
accordingly , germany , spain , france , italy , netherlands , and the united kingdom were the eu countries participating in most projects ( at least in 28 ) , compared to e.g. cyprus , czech republic , latvia , luxembourg and slovakia , which participated in the least ( maximum of 8 ) .
these results are supported by previous research by galsworthy and mckee [ 7 ] , who found that the original 15 member states had received 34 times more health research funding under fp7 than the 12 ( now 13 ) newest members .

in respect to research question 1 , fig. 1 indicates the distribution of eu projects across performance domains .
in order to systematically analyse the project information and indicate data gaps , all projects were firstly mapped onto the appropriate health system performance domains , and additionally subdivided by care sector , disease field and targeted population group ( fig. 1 ) .
the performance domains refer to the oecd health care quality indicators framework , a methodological health system performance assessment framework , which was modified to meet the needs of the euroreach project of highlighting the production process [ 9 ] .
furthermore , to obtain a comprehensive overview on their distribution , all projects were distinguished by whether they target whole populations , i.e. including healthy individuals , or only patients , i.e. diseased individuals .
for the latter , we further divided projects by whether they were cross - sectional or not .
the disease field dimension was also incorporated into the figure by highlighting projects in different colours ( disease fields and corresponding colours are presented in the key below fig. 1 ). fig. 1 distribution of eu projects across performance domains ; classified by population groups and care settings and disease fields population - based projects projects targeting whole populations are unevenly distributed across performance domains ( fig. 1 ) .
the majority of projects only cover the domains ' health status' and ' non - healthcare determinants of health ' , with a few exceptions also looking at ' healthcare system performance ' , ' health system design and context ' and ' equity ' .
this might , however , be due to the fact that population - based projects rather assess and compare health statuses by , for example , analysing different lifestyles , intervention starting points , etc .
to investigate risk factors for certain conditions ( e.g. epic ) or their impact on population health ( e.g. gbd ) , as well as address healthy ageing ( e.g. share ) and / or tackle inequality ( eurothine ) , than targeting health services or their performance .
in respect to the disease fields covered , most of the population - based projects can be mapped to non - disease specific projects .
patient - based projects patient - based projects show a better balanced distribution across performance domains , including areas such as quality , efficiency or access to healthcare .
we identified projects ( e.g. eunice ) covering all performance domains , whereas others ( e.g. rarecare ) cover only one .
among the specific healthcare performance domains , quality was researched most , and efficiency least .
most projects addressed the hospital and primary care sector and were mapped to the category ' across sectors ' , seven projects were mapped to the inpatient sector ( which often benchmark hospital performance , study the quality of the care process and / or different treatment methods ) and two projects to the outpatient sector .
thus , the number of projects addressing primary care was considerably smaller than the number of projects addressing the hospital sector , which most likely is not limited to just our project sample .
disease fields most frequently covered are cancer and cvd .
mental health projects are clearly underrepresented , as well as asthma and diabetes , which might partly be due to the only few primary care projects included .
hospital - based projects mostly study cancer and cvd as well as various acute diseases and focus less on diabetes , asthma and mental health , whereas the primary care projects in our sample rather assess and compare primary care systems than specific diseases .
in respect to research question 2 , to find out what the projects can tell us about their data and whether there are research imbalances detectable , each project was systematically analysed for details on project objectives , coverage and methods used ( fig. 2 ) .
accordingly , categories for both project objectives and methods were built and populated .
the number of projects included in fig. 2 deviated from those in fig. 1 , since for seven projects the information given on the websites was not sufficient to adequately complete the table. fig. 2 overview of project objectives and methods regarding project objectives ( x - axis ) , most projects address disease monitoring , healthy ageing , hospital performance and quality of treatment .
data on patient experiences was lacking in most countries , though patient feedback is essential for improving healthcare provision .
information on healthcare costs and health expenditure for particular services and goods is also very poor in these projects , hampering the understanding of health system performance and efficiency .
this , however , is often due to the fact that data on costs by diseases and different socioeconomic groups are particularly difficult to obtain for research purposes in many countries .
thus , two main types of projects exist in the study sample , namely ( 1 ) those that monitor health , risk factors or particular diseases across whole populations and develop or adapt indicators but which do not allow an assessment of health system performance ( as these dimensions are not included ) and ( 2 ) those that are often confined to hospital performance , which are patient - level , but necessarily leave out healthy individuals .
fewer projects address equity , patients' needs and satisfaction or assessed primary care models. with respect to methods ( y - axis ) , most of the projects in our sample used survey data , administrative patient - level data ( i.e. hospital discharge , medical records ) and registries .
fewer projects used biomarkers and / or results of a clinical examination ( e.g. waist circumference ) , aggregated statistical data , interviews or focus groups and vignettes .
projects designed for the hospital sector most commonly used patient outcome data , some of which additionally combined different kinds of methods ( e.g. eurohope , which combines administrative and survey data , e.g. to assess patient satisfaction , or duque , which combines patient outcome data and surveys ) .
it can also be observed that projects addressing cvd , those with no clear disease focus as well as those addressing various diseases were quite wide - spread in their methodology and made use of almost all research instrument , whereas most of the cancer - only projects used registries ( fig. 2 ) .
figure 2 furthermore indicates follow - up projects in our sample ( marked with "*") which use existing databases for further investigations ( e.g. eurhobop , which followed euphoric , or echim , which followed echi and echi ii ) .
we also marked collaborative research networks between projects ("**") , thus eunice , which operates a network with primary care data providers , collaborates with eurocare about their survival registry data and with eurochip about their cancer health indicators .
another example in the field of cancer is rarecare , a project that helps define indicators and collects data on rare cancers and which collaborates with eurocare about their survival registry data , with haemacare on bridging the gap between clinical research and public health information systems , and with eurochip on their indicators .
the following example is to demonstrate the good use of such collection of projects .
using the example of cvd , our hypothetical researcher would theoretically be enabled to compare , for example , risk factors , development of the disease , as well as monitoring and treatment by triangulating research results from epic - cvd , monica , eros , eurociss , eurhobop , oecd study , eurohope and eurodrg .
this kind of performance comparison is , however , still enormously hampered by poor linkage possibilities of data from different providers and sectors ( e.g. hospitals , ambulatory care , pharmaceuticals ) in many countries as , especially in the field of individual - level health data , many restrictions exist ( e.g. in germany ) [ 9 ] .
discussion the study was driven by the idea to provide a potential user of comparative healthcare information with an inventory of relevant health data across the eu according to their research need ( see our inclusion criteria ) .
the first research question , however , already revealed that it is often not easy to find adequate project information .
both of the used information systems did not prove to be entirely sufficient in providing information needed to obtain a proper understanding of the projects' contents .
deliverables , such as intermediate results , were often not presented or initial project descriptions not updated , even upon project completion .
on cordis , the quality of information varied considerably between projects ; in some cases , projects were presented in detail and also publications listed , in other cases it was not even possible to find a project website or names of project coordinators .
even though fp7 has addressed many of the criticisms of its predecessors [ 3 ] , comparing our observations to those done in 2009 for fp5 and 6 , not much seems to have changed with regard to cordis and its difficulties to obtain data .
once we tried to access individual project websites , the same was often experienced , with user unfriendly , not updated , non - existent or incomplete project websites lacking basic information on project background , methodology and results .
an overview of the number of publications listed on each website can be found in additional file 2 .
the results reveal large differences between projects and associated publications .
in order to obtain a realistic idea about the extent of research funding that is not reflected by the number of publications , a next step should focus on relevant literature databases .
thus , project consortiums should provide complete and easily accessible project websites hosting all relevant information regarding the background , methodology ( including sample , data collection process , etc. ) and results of the projects ( final report , individual outcomes , indicator list ) on completion of the study and updates on the progress ( e.g. interim reports ) when the study is still ongoing .
it would be more than unfortunate if good project results disappeared due to poor communication management or because websites were seen as internal communication tools only .
especially funders or governments of under - represented areas might thus be able to spot gaps in existing data , find information on what data have already been processed by others and even use it as a basis or prototype for ( local ) application and simultaneously be encouraged to collect data in under - represented areas [ 8 ] .
ideally , websites would also host the project databases , accessible for researchers or policymakers ( e.g. eurociss , share ) or , as suggested by galsworthy et al .
[ 10 ] , to have databases generated by projects to be shared mandatorily as project deliverables via central searchable eu repositories .
further , open access to databases at some point after project completion should be allowed for meta - analyses , for example .
initiatives such as the open science prize ( https :// www.openscienceprize.org /) in the field of biomedical research encourage open content solutions to improve health , which are worth considering in other fields .
in the next step , all projects were carefully analysed to learn about specific research aims and methods used , collaborations developed , and information produced .
overall , we saw that only a few projects had produced the type of data required for proper performance assessment , i.e. that collect not only individual - level data on healthcare performance but also on non - healthcare determinants of health , which impedes proper risk - adjustment .
on the other hand , population - based projects , which include such data , almost always lack information on healthcare , i.e. do not allow a performance assessment .
this supports previous research indicating that societal needs are not reflected by investments in many funding schemes [ 11 ] , such as two united kingdom studies [ 12 , 13 ] that compared levels of research funding with measures of the burden of disease in the field of infectious diseases as well as in cancer , coronary heart disease , dementia and stroke , and found that funding overall increased within the last years , however , not in relation to their burden of disease .
nevertheless , horizon 2020 is supposed to address major societal issues such as health and sustainability by , for example , introducing a detailed online hierarchical categorisation of eu investments - similar to the us national institutes of health 's reporter website - allowing national funders to see collaboration opportunities and gaps [ 7 ] .
furthermore , based on our findings , projects should include healthcare utilisation and cost information , which would allow an assessment of the quality of care at different levels ( e.g. hospitals , regions , countries ) .
more mixed - method designs would also be useful , for example , cancer projects could incorporate patient discharge data combined with surveys .
additionally , patient - based projects would not only benefit from including non - healthcare determinants , but also from linking their results to cost information ( such as eurohope or echo ) and patient experiences .
other challenges hampering international comparisons are due to a lack of available or accessible data in certain countries and areas , or differences in data collection among countries , e.g. regarding effective care pathways , disparities in healthcare utilisation , patient experience , costs and expenditure , and / or even the most basic descriptive data on socioeconomic inequalities .
these observations are partly supported by previous research reporting on research priorities across most fields of public health in european countries [ 14 ] .
another issue we came across was the problem of sustainability due to the time - limited construction of the projects and associated funding .
once the projects ended , often , no project website was updated and there was no continued effort to keep the database alive .
however , databases generated by projects need to be sustained after completion of projects .
in 2015 , the bridge health project ( bridging information and data generation for evidence - based health policy and research ; www.bridge - health.eu ) was launched to develop a sustainable and integrated eu health information system for both health and research purposes .
one of the aims is to continue the work of selected projects relevant for performance assessment , such as echo and eurohope .
limitations the aim of this paper was to analyse whether there would be enough research output of eu projects available to conduct proper health system performance .
our approach was to create an option to understand and categorise the output of eu projects by demonstrating a potential solution to systematically analyse them .
since this aim was very ambitious , several limitations were encountered .
inclusion criteria for projects were applied and the search was limited to specific databases only .
thus , relevant projects for health system performance beyond our inclusion criteria and those that were not eu - funded were not considered for the analysis .
furthermore , in cordis , only keywords for diseases were used as indicated in the text .
thus , we assumed that , by entering e.g. ' chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ' instead of copd , no loss of study information would be implied .
another limitation refers to the approach of assessing performance using projects that were not explicitly funded for performance evaluation .
however , we assumed that the overall goal of health - related research should be to improve performance of health systems .
conclusions this study has indicated that public money spent on health research projects and initiatives has produced a huge amount of useful output .
at the same time , however , individual projects do not deliver the breadth of information that is necessary for proper health system performance assessment and international comparisons .
therefore , our findings suggest to strengthen the effort of developing datasets that harmonise data from national health surveys and national mortality registries , for example , to allow international comparisons ( e.g. eurothine , oncopool ) , as well as to implement european - wide benchmarking on outcomes , quality and costs enabling decision - makers as well as health professionals at different levels to learn from the best practices .
additionally , the findings strongly recommend that funders should take clear responsibility not only to make research papers and reports adequately available , but also to ensure that results are made known to the research community , policymakers and funders .
cordis , as a research and development information service , needs to strengthen its effort to ensure that relevant and detailed project information is adequately shared .

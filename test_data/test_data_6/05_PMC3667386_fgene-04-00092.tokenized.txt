differences between genomes can be due to single nucleotide variants , translocations , inversions , and copy number variants ( cnvs , gain or loss of dna ) .
the latter can range from sub - microscopic events to complete chromosomal aneuploidies .
small cnvs are often benign but those larger than 500 kb are strongly associated with morbid consequences such as developmental disorders and cancer .
detecting cnvs within and between populations is essential to better understand the plasticity of our genome and to elucidate its possible contribution to disease .
hence there is a need for better - tailored and more robust tools for the detection and genome - wide analyses of cnvs .
while a link between a given cnv and a disease may have often been established , the relative cnv contribution to disease progression and impact on drug response is not necessarily understood .
in this review we discuss the progress , challenges , and limitations that occur at different stages of cnv analysis from the detection ( using dna microarrays and next - generation sequencing ) and identification of recurrent cnvs to the association with phenotypes .
we emphasize the importance of germline cnvs and propose strategies to aid clinicians to better interpret structural variations and assess their clinical implications .
copy number variation genome - wide association studies personalized medicine sequencing complex disease genomics bioinformatics background information on cnvs genetic variations in the human genome take many forms ranging from large chromosomal anomalies ( segmental aneuploidy ) to single nucleotide variant ( snvs ) .
deletion , insertion , and duplication events which give rise to copy number variations ( cnvs ) have been found genome - wide in humans ( iafrate et al. , 2004 ; sharp et al. , 2005 ; feuk et al. , 2006 ; fiegler et al. , 2006 ; freeman et al. , 2006 ; redon et al. , 2006 ; kidd et al. , 2008 , 2010 ; perry et al. , 2008 ; conrad et al. , 2010 ; valsesia et al. , 2012 ) and other species ( dopman and hartl , 2007 ; graubert et al. , 2007 ; guryev et al. , 2008 ; lee et al. , 2008 ; fontanesi et al. , 2010 ; liu et al. , 2010 ) .
cnvs are classically defined as events longer than 1 kb ( feuk et al. , 2006 ) ; smaller events are referred to as indels ( see additional definitions in box 1 ). with the advent of next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) , cnvs as small as 500 bp can be identified .
cnvs can occur at different frequencies in a given population .
when this frequency is greater than 1 % , the cnv is referred to as a copy number polymorphism ( cnp ) ( feuk et al. , 2006 ) ( box 1 ) .
this contrasts with single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) whose frequencies are by definition greater than 1 % .
box 1 additional definitions .
structural variants structural variation defines a large class of genomic alterations .
these alterations can be quantitative ( copy number variants , indels ) , positional ( translocations ) , or orientational ( inversions ) .
this term is used in a neutral sense and nothing is suggested with regards to variation frequency or to association with a phenotype / disease .
single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) single nucleotide polymorphisms are the most common type of dna polymorphisms , which occur when a single nucleotide in the genome sequence is altered. by definition , snps occur in a population with a frequency greater than 1 % .
when this frequency criterion is not met , this variation is referred to as a single nucleotide variant ( snv ) .
copy number variant ( cnv ) copy number variant refers to a segment of dna , for which copy number differences can be observed between individuals .
translocations and inversions do not involve copy number changes and thus are not considered as copy number variants .
following the initial genome - wide discovery of cnvs using bac arrays and early snp arrays , the minimal length of a cnv was arbitrary defined at 1 kb. with the advent of next - generation sequencing and new generation arrays , several studies use a minimal length of 500 bp. copy number polymorphisms ( cnp ) common cnvs shared by > 1 % of a population are referred to as copy number polymorphisms .
copy number aberration ( cna ) copy number aberrations refer to cnvs identified in oncogenomics studies .
these aberrations can be germline ( predisposition to cancer ) or somatic ( present in the tumor cell but not in the " normal " diploid cell from the same donor ) .
somatic copy number aberrations are abbreviated as scna .
this abbreviation does not suggest whether a given aberration is a driver ( initial mutation that led to tumor development and progression ) or a passenger event ( molecular aberration that is the consequence of one or several driver events ) .
insertion / deletion ( indel ) an indel describes the relative gain or loss of a segment of one or more nucleotides in a genomic sequence .
it is used when the direction of copy number change cannot be defined .
for example when it is not clear whether the variant is an insertion in the reference genome or a deletion in the genome of interest .
indels are typically used to denote small - scale variants ( smaller than 1 kb in length ) .
segmental duplication ( also called low - copy repeat or duplicon ) a segment of dna with a length greater than 1 kb that occurs in two or more copies per haploid genome .
the different copies share at least 90 % of sequence identity .
these segments can also be cnvs .
due to the high sequence similarity between the duplicated sequences , segmental duplication predispose to non - allelic homologous recombination .
the observation that cnvs and cnps ( here collectively referred to as cnvs ) could occur both in normal ( iafrate et al. , 2004 ; sharp et al. , 2005 ; feuk et al. , 2006 ; fiegler et al. , 2006 ; freeman et al. , 2006 ; redon et al. , 2006 ; kidd et al. , 2008 , 2010 ; perry et al. , 2008 ; conrad et al. , 2010 ; valsesia et al. , 2012 ) and disease ( firth et al. , 2009 ; zhang et al. , 2009 ; grozeva et al. , 2010 ; walters et al. , 2010 ; wellcome trust case control consortium et al. , 2010 ; jacquemont et al. , 2011 ) populations has opened a new chapter in human genomics .
cnvs have been explored in european ( redon et al. , 2006 ; li et al. , 2009 ; gayan et al. , 2010 ; valsesia et al. , 2012 ) , african ( matsuzaki et al. , 2009 ; mcelroy et al. , 2009 ) , and several asian populations : chinese ( lin et al. , 2008 ) , japanese ( takahashi et al. , 2008 ) , korean ( kang et al. , 2008 ; jeon et al. , 2009 ) .
comparisons have been performed between human populations ( jakobsson et al. , 2008 ; conrad et al. , 2010 ; kato et al. , 2010 ) and across apes ( nister et al. , 1987 ; conrad and hurles , 2007 ; kidd et al. , 2008 , 2010 ) .
cnvs constitute a non - negligible part of the genetic diversity , with consequences in term of evolution and disease susceptibility ( conrad and hurles , 2007 ) .
consequently , their detection and association with quantitative traits and clinical phenotype constitute an important step toward a better understanding of disease etiology .
however , such their detection remains challenging .
there are numerous factors in the data generation and computational analyses that can lead to spurious associations .
finally , the sheer amount of data that can be generated already for a single subject imposes severe challenges in terms of data interpretation .
in this review , we provide an overview of the different platforms and analytical steps from cnv detection to association with clinical traits .
we discuss promising strategies to interpret structural variations in the context of personalized medicine .
high - throughput cnv discovery platforms gross copy number ( cn ) alterations were initially detected with karyotyping in the early days of cytogenetics .
several large - scale aberrations ( pepler et al. , 1968 ; dowjat and wlodarska , 1981 ; nister et al. , 1987 ) were identified before the development of higher resolution techniques .
fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) has increased this resolution , enabling the detection of sub - microscopic cnvs that could not be detected with karyotyping .
today , the most widely used techniques can be classified as amplification - based ( polymerase chain reaction ) , hybridization - based ( fish , comparative genome hybridization , and snp arrays ) or sequencing - based .
these techniques differ in precision , throughput , and resolution .
in this review we focus on genome - wide cnv discovery platforms : dna microarrays ( cgh and snp ) and ngs .
microarray - based methods single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays the hapmap project ( the international hapmap project , 2003 ) has played a major role in the discovery and characterization of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) .
investigation of genotype data from trios played a major role in the identification of cnvs from snp genotyping arrays .
indeed cnvs could be detected from the following patterns : ( 1 ) snps violating mendelian inheritance principle ( conrad et al. , 2006 ) , ( 2 ) clusters of genotyping errors , and ( 3 ) regions not in hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( mccarroll et al. , 2006 ) .
both mccarroll et al .
( 2006 ) and conrad et al .
( 2006 ) showed that these events corresponded to deletions .
this prompted the need to re - analyze snp genotyping arrays for cnvs .
although these arrays were not primarily designed for cnv analysis , it is possible to obtain a cn ratio by combining the intensities of the two alleles and normalizing this quantity with respect to reference .
cnv can then be detected by identifying significant deviations from the baseline cn ratio .
some publicly available software combines cn and allelic ratio ( the ratio of the allele intensities ) to improve cnv detection ( table 1 ) .
such strategy can be applied both for tumor analysis ( laframboise et al. , 2005 ; attiyeh et al. , 2009 ) ( figure 1 ) and diploid sample analysis ( colella et al. , 2007 ; wang et al. , 2007a ; coin et al. , 2010 ) .
now , genotyping arrays include both snp probes and cn probes to cover previously established cn variant regions .
the choice of a method will depend on several factors : ( 1 ) which platform is to be analyzed ( illumina or affymetrix ) , ( 2 ) the desired output ( discrete or continuous cn prediction ) , and ( 3 ) the type of dna to be analyzed ( germline or somatic cnv analysis ) .
methods should not be used only with their default parameters .
provided that technical replicates are available , the analyst should compare different methods in combination with different parameters .
this can lead to significant improvement both in term of sensitivity and specificity ( valsesia et al. , 2011 , 2012 ) .

subsequent panels show chromosome 7 with , from top to bottom : hybridization log2 ratio , b allele frequency and copy number prediction .
comparative genome hybridization arrays comparative genome hybridization compares the relative cn of a test dna with respect to a reference dna ( kallioniemi et al. , 1992 ; ylstra et al. , 2006 ; carter , 2007 ; redon et al. , 2009 ) .
the two dna samples are labeled with different dyes ( red or green ) , and then hybridized competitively .
a ratio of relative cn changes can then be measured ; significant deviations from the baseline indicate cn gains or losses with respect to the reference genome ( figure 1 ) .
initial cnv detection was made using arrays having a resolution close to 50 kb ( fiegler et al. , 2006 ; redon et al. , 2006 ) .
current cgh arrays , such as agilent 1 m arrays , have a median resolution of one probe every 2.1 kb. such resolution is not as good as the one obtained from recent snp arrays (< 500 bp ) but the signals obtained from few cgh probes tend to be more reliable than those obtained from few adjacent snps ( curtis et al. , 2009 ; pinto et al. , 2011 ) and although allele - specific cn cannot be inferred from cgh ( as opposed to snp arrays ) , these arrays remain popular for the detection of cnv both in somatic ( tumors ) ( kallioniemi et al. , 1992 ; pinkel and albertson , 2005 ; bignell et al. , 2007 ) and in constitutional diagnostics ( oostlander et al. , 2004 ; shaffer and bejjani , 2006 ; edelmann and hirschhorn , 2009 ; boone et al. , 2010 ) .
sequencing - based methods today , ngs technologies allow one to sequence millions of reads in parallel .
new methods for structural variant analysis were developed ( medvedev et al. , 2009 ; dalca and brudno , 2010 ; ruffalo et al. , 2011 ; koboldt et al. , 2012 ) including paired - end mapping ( pem ) , read - depth analysis , split - read strategies , and sequence assembly comparisons .

( 2010 ) mixed strategies combines both paired - end mapping and read - depth analysis medvedev et al .
( 2010 ) paired - end mapping approaches before the advent of ngs , structural variants were detected from fosmid paired - end sequencing ( tuzun et al. , 2005 ; kidd et al. , 2008 ) .
the principle is as follow : ( 1 ) the genomic sequence is fragmented and cloned into fosmids .
( 2 ) ends of the cloned fragments are sequenced using universal primers and aligned to the reference genome .
( 3 ) paired - ends , discordant in length or direction , indicate respectively possible indels or inversion ( figure 2a ) .
pem enables precise breakpoint determination and performs well even in the presence of repetitive elements ( line , sine ) .
however it fails when both paired - ends map within repeats .
also the detection resolution is limited to the distance between pairs ; therefore , neither large nor very small rearrangements can be detected , with the exception of large deletions .
figure 2 ngs approaches .
analytical strategy to detect cnv from ngs data : ( a ) pair - end mapping approached , ( b ) read - depth approach , and ( c ) split - read approach .
read - depth approach the read - depth analysis investigates change in read coverage compared to an expected depth distribution ( figure 2b ) .
mutual information about paired - reads is used to improve the mapping quality and to detect complex and large rearrangements .
however read - depth analysis is challenging in repeat - rich regions ( due to mapping issues ) .
split - read approach the split - read strategy entails in gapped - alignment of reads onto candidate breakpoints ( figure 2c ) .
the strategy is to detect paired - reads where only one end is uniquely mapped onto a reference genome ( ye et al. , 2009 ) .
the assumption is that the second paired - read could not be mapped , even with few mismatches allowed , because it corresponds to a deletion or insertion breakpoint .
the mapped - read is used as an anchor and knowing both a maximum event length and the direction to search for the unmapped - read ; alignment of the unmapped - read can be performed either by splitting it into two or three fragments whereby the former indicates a deletion event and the latter indicates an insertion event ( figure 2c ) .
sequence assembly comparison provided a high sequencing depth , de novo assembly can be attempted ( simpson et al. , 2009 ; li et al. , 2010 ; iqbal et al. , 2012 ; simpson and durbin , 2012 ) such that a sequence comparison can be made with the reference genome to identify deletions and insertions .
the advantage of de novo assembling over pem approaches is that deletions or insertions smaller than the paired - end insert size can be detected .
but on the other hand , de novo assembling is very difficult for repeat - rich regions and until recently ( iqbal et al. , 2012 ) was only possible with high read - depth .
when this criterion is not met , several experiments can be pooled together ( the 1000 genomes project consortium , 2010 ) .
the above techniques present different and complementary advantages .
combining several approaches definitely empowers the detection of structural variations ( mills et al. , 2011 ) .
pitfalls in cnv analyses the need for adequate design and laboratory quality control despite tremendous improvement in the different technologies and analytical methods , cnv detection remains a difficult task ( wineinger et al. , 2008 ; curtis et al. , 2009 ; winchester et al. , 2009 ; eckel - passow et al. , 2011 ; haraksingh et al. , 2011 ; pinto et al. , 2011 ; valsesia et al. , 2011 , 2012 ) .
both dna microarrays and ngs are prone to batch effects .
date of experiment , plate id , experimenter or ozone levels are all factors that can influence cnv prediction .
batch effects can have very severe consequences and lead to spurious associations .
inappropriate sample randomization , such as genotyping cases and controls within separate batches , is the worst - case scenario in case - control studies .
unfortunately such a scenario is all too common and is typically discovered late in the data generation process .
therefore careful experimental planning and quality control , including thorough investigation about putative batch effects , should be considered as part of the core analysis .
a number of approaches should be considered such as ( 1 ) detecting outliers at different laboratory qc steps , ( 2 ) using positive and negative controls to check the consistency between batches , ( 3 ) performing principal component analyses or other multivariate analyses to detect possible batch effects , ( 4 ) using technical replicates to check consistency of the results and estimate noise levels in the data .
in addition , to these common pitfalls in any cnv analysis , there are other limitations that are inherent to either dna microarrays or ngs experiments .
dna microarray limitations dna microarrays suffer from several limitations , notably the measured cn ratio derived from fluorescence intensities is very noisy and is subject to artifacts such gc - biases , probe spatial auto - correlation , non - specific hybridization , differences between color dyes for cgh arrays , and allelic crosstalk for snp arrays .
numerous normalization procedures have been proposed ( marioni et al. , 2007 ; bengtsson et al. , 2008 ; chen et al. , 2008 ; diskin et al. , 2008 ; fitzgerald et al. , 2011 ) to address these issues .
nevertheless these normalizations , e.g. , loess smoothing , can mask small cn changes and often are not sufficient to avoid false - positives .
typically , a number of adjacent probes will be required to define a cnv but de facto this prevents the detection of very small cnvs .
also repeat - rich regions and regions close to segmental duplications remain poorly covered , owing to the challenge at designing probes with limited risk of cross - hybridization .
these genomic regions are highly dynamic ( prone to rearrangements ) and may thus be enriched for cnvs .
to overcome this density limitation , the latest snp array generation combines both snps and non - polymorphic probes to cover cnv regions ( mccarroll et al. , 2008 ) .
finally , dna microarrays do not provide a cn digital readout due to hybridization saturation .
several methods ( greenman et al. , 2010 ; van loo et al. , 2010 ; scharpf et al. , 2011 ) for snp arrays allow a continuous cn prediction that is not limited to a discrete five - state classification ( cn = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or > 3 ) .
although precise cn estimation remains difficult ( for example to distinguish between six and seven copies ) , such estimates are sufficient to identify loci to be re - assessed with targeted methods .
continuous cn prediction is possible due to the use of allele - specific information ( allelic intensity ratios ) .
traditional cgh arrays do not include such information , but newer arrays developed for diagnostic purpose combine both cgh and snp probes resulting in a better cn classification and allowing the detection of uniparental dysomy and copy - neutral loh .
ngs limitations next - generation sequencing offers several advantages over dna arrays in particular ; it allows detection of very small variants ( indels , snps ) and inversion .
it can estimate exact breakpoint location and does not suffer from hybridization saturation allowing a better ( digital ) estimation of high cns .
however cnv analysis from ngs data is not trivial ( the 1000 genomes project consortium , 2010 ; mills et al. , 2011 ) .
biases can be introduced by the experimental protocol and need to be addressed .
sequence capture arrays , used for exome sequencing , tend to introduce biases due to the range of gc content that is captured ( hybridized ) ( dohm et al. , 2008 ; klambauer et al. , 2012 ; li et al. , 2012 ) .
sequence read quality score might be biased due to the presence of indels / cnvs , these scores need to be re - calibrated with local realignment around known indel sites ( mckenna et al. , 2010 ; depristo et al. , 2011 ) .
in addition , the coverage will not be uniform across the genome : longer genes will have in average a better coverage compared to smaller ones ; and low - complexity regions will have low coverage .
thus modeling of read - depth across samples at each position and across samples helps to account for such biases , to estimate the noise , and to control the false discovery rate ( fdr ) by filtering noisy predictions ( klambauer et al. , 2012 ) .
another promising approach is to use singular value decomposition to detect rare cnvs and to infer cnp genotypes from exome sequencing data ( krumm et al. , 2012 ) .
the ngs field is still evolving and more sophisticated methods are frequently made available ( table 2 ) .
a promising strategy to limit the risk of false positives , in particular in the context of clinical diagnosis , is to predict cnvs using multiple algorithms ( the 1000 genomes project consortium , 2010 ; sudmant et al. , 2010 ) and / or using methods that allow fdr control ( klambauer et al. , 2012 ) .
post - filtering and post - processing steps subsequently to cnv detection , additional filtering and processing are often needed to discard possible false - positives .
these steps , referred to as either post - filtering or post - processing , are essential prior to any attempt to associate cnvs with clinical / phenotypic traits because false - positives are likely to create spurious associations .
moreover , we showed that a high fdr decreases significantly the discovery power of omics studies ( clevert et al. , in press ) .
these post - filtering steps aim at removing either dubious samples or probes .
subjects predicted with too many cnvs as compared to other subjects from the study , should be discarded .
an aberrant number of cnvs has proved to be a proxy for poor data quality and / or high fdr .
probe filtering can involve discarding cnv regions that are too rare in the population ( for example seen in less than three individuals ) .
but this might remove putative rare cnvs , which are of most importance for association studies and contrary to some common cnvs may not be tagged by snps ( redon et al. , 2006 ; stranger et al. , 2007 ; conrad et al. , 2010 ; wellcome trust case control consortium et al. , 2010 ) .
these filters remain useful as they discard many false positives and in the context of association studies decrease the multiple - testing burdens .
alternative filtering criteria may flag or use models that account for cnvs with low - confidence score or that are too short to support the call ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 impact of cnv post - filtering on false - discovery rate ( fdr ) .
illustration of the fdr evolution when discarding cnvs based on their length ( a ) or based on their confidence scores ( b ) .
( c,d ) show respectively histograms of cnv length and cnv confidence score .
fluctuations in these histograms ( such as inversion of the proportion " small cnvs over long cnvs " or " low - confidence over high - confidence cnvs ") are associated with non - monotonic changes in the fdr curve .
cnv genome - wide association tests general cnv - gwa framework association between a given trait and a cnv locus can be performed in several ways .
for quantitative traits linear regressions are very popular while logistic regression , fisher 's exact test or armitage - cochrane trend test are often used with binary traits .
all these tests may apply at single probe level , but not for cn regions .
cnvs across subjects do not necessarily have the same boundaries ( figure 4 ) and defining a " consensus " cnv locus is not trivial .
this problem is frequently ignored and association tests are made using probe - level cn information ( figure 4 ) .
such an approach , assumes that all samples were assayed on the same platform and that data can be combined into a matrix samples by probes , where each element corresponds to a predicted cn. then association tests can be performed independently for each probe .
since adjacent probes may carry the same information , many tests are redundant .
this might not be a computational issue ; however it is problematic in terms of multiple - testing corrections .
a number of procedures have been previously proposed to identify the number of independent tests in snp - based genome - wide association tests ( gwas ) and would prove useful with cnv - based gwas ( cheverud , 2001 ; nyholt , 2004 ; gao et al. , 2008 ) .

" aligning cnvs " from different subjects and identifying the consensus cnv can be useful to identify clusters of cnvs with similar boundaries and help interpretation ( figure 4 ) .
this can be done with the so - called merge - by - overlap approach ( conrad et al. , 2006 ; redon et al. , 2006 ) , where cnvs from different individuals are merged into the same cnv region if their reciprocal overlap satisfies a minimal cut - off [> 50 % is frequently used ( conrad et al. , 2006 ; redon et al. , 2006 )] .
we proposed recently another approach based on principal component analysis and clustering ( valsesia et al. , 2012 ) .
once " aligned ," a matrix cnv by subjects can be derived and the association tests can be performed as aforementioned .
differences between genome - wide cnv analysis and genome - wide snp analysis conducting a genome - wide cnv analysis differs greatly from conducting a genome - wide snp analysis .
cnvs and snps can both be mined from snp genotyping arrays , yet data needed for their detection are different .
snp genotypes can be predicted from the two measured allelic intensities while cnvs can be predicted by combining several type of information such as cn ratios and allelic intensity ratios .
methods like birdsuite ( mccarroll et al. , 2008 ) can also integrate snp genotype data and use prior information such as regions of known cnvs to improve the cnv detection .
another difference is that snp analysis is carried out using the whole cohort , while cnv analysis can be performed using either the whole cohort ( multi - sample analysis ) or sample - wise ( each sample is analyzed independently from the others ) .
while snp genotyping is a fairly standardized procedure ; cnv genotyping remains challenging and is prone to high false - positive rates .
therefore , while snp genotypes can be obtained with a very high prediction confidence ; cnv predictions have higher uncertainty levels .
these uncertainty levels greatly challenge the subsequent cnv association with a given phenotype or clinical trait .
in addition , these two types of analyses differ in the number of independent tests that are performed .
this difference has consequences in the correction for multiple testing .
while for snps the ratio between the number of tested snps and the effective number of truly independent tests is ~ 2.5 - fold ( han et al. , 2009 ) ( in the case of hapmap snps ) , for cnv probes this ratio is several folds higher .
we showed recently with the colaus cohort ( valsesia et al. , 2012 ) ( a population - based health survey with more than 5,600 subjects genotyped on affymetrix 500 k snp arrays ) that cn predictions obtained at 490 k autosomal snps could be compressed into about 8 k distinct cnv regions , including both rare and common cnvs .
this number of regions gives a first approximation about the number of independent tests .
using the simple m method ( gao et al. , 2008 ) , we estimated that the number of truly independent tests was 6,643 corresponding to a 74 - fold difference compared to the probe - level cn predictions .
therefore , while for snp analysis the difference between number of snps and number of independent tests is negligible , this quantity is much greater for cnvs and can cause substantial p - value deflation , as can be observed with qq - plots .
for these reasons , a genome - wide cnv analysis , such as a cnv - gwa , is often considered as a secondary analysis , after an initial snp - gwa .
studies , like those of the giant consortium , often check whether snps discovered to be associated with a certain trait could potentially tag underlying cnv associations .
two bmi associations ( willer , 2009 ; speliotes et al. , 2010 ) ( near the negr1 and gprc5b genes ) have been identified as potentially driven by deletions .
frequent issues in cnv - gwas copy number variations genome - wide associations ( gwas ) are much more challenging than snp - based gwas , mostly because of the uncertainty of the predicted cnvs .
this may explain the lack of published reports from cnv - gwas .
this uncertainty in cn can be tackled by missing data likelihood methods resulting in the usual test statistics ( likelihood ratio , wald test ) .
however these methods can be computationally intensive and the speed of convergence ( as sample size tends to infinity ) ensured by the central limit theorem is not always as fast as it is for normal linear models .
non - gaussian test statistic distributions can lead to spurious associations ( kutalik et al. , 2011 ) and give rise to inflated p - values ( as can be detected with qq - plots , see figure 5a ) .
although genomic control methods ( devlin and roeder , 1999 ) allow correcting for inflated p - values in most cases , critical assessment of the cnv pipeline remains necessary both for sensitivity and specificity .
combining methods that estimate fdrs ( clevert et al. , 2011 ; klambauer et al. , 2012 ) with technical replicates is essential to achieve a good sensitivity - specificity compromise .
figure 5d shows a qq plot where neither strong p - values inflation nor deflation can be seen .
figure 5 qq - plots investigation. from a real dataset : copy number predictions for more than 3,600 individuals at 95,770 probes from chromosome 1 ; association was tested with either a simulated phenotype ( a - c ) or a real phenotype ( d ) .
the simulated phenotype corresponds to normally distributed data influenced by a confounding factor [ here the first principal component ( pc1 ) obtained from the matrix of copy number predictions ] .
( a ) shows a strong p - value inflation ( lambda ~ 65 ) that is due to the confounding factor ( pc1 ) .
( b ) corresponds to results from a model where pc1 is added as a covariate ( to adjust for the confounding effect ) .
yet ( b ) shows a slight p - value deflation ( lambda ~ 0.87 ) .
this deflation is due to the fact that the tested probes are assumed to be independent while many of these probes correspond to a same cnv region ( thus the presented p - values are not from truly independent tests ) .
( c ) shows a qq plot adjusting for pc1 and where p0 ( the x axis ) accounts for the fact that probes can come from the same cnv region .
such plot can be done ( in the r programing language ) by setting the vector of expected p - value ( x axis ) as p0 < - seq [ 1 / n,1,by = ( 1 - 1 / n )/( n - 1 )] where n is the number of cnv regions ( number of effective tests ) and n is the total number of cnv probes ( number of observations ) .
( d ) shows results from association with real data ( here body mass index ) .
in these qq - plots , points with identical p - values correspond to rare , but rather long cnvs that produce multiple identical probes .
inflated p - values ( figure 5a ) can be due to various violations of the model assumptions , e.g. , non - normal trait distribution , dependence between tests , or confounding effects such as population stratification ( including population admixture ) , cryptic - or familial - relatedness .
careful covariate selection and diagnostic plots are needed to address the two first issues .
for admixture and population stratification , many methods have been proposed to detect and adjust them ( cardon and palmer , 2003 ; rosenberg et al. , 2010 ) .
copy number variations - gwas can also produce deflated qq - plots ( figure 5b ) owing to the fact the number of tested markers is much greater than the number of truly independent tests .
methods used in multiple - testing adjustment in snp - gwas ( cheverud , 2001 ; nyholt , 2004 ; gao et al. , 2008 ) can be useful to identify cn markers corresponding to independent tests and to produce the corresponding qq plot using those markers only .
qq - plots can also be produced so that the expected p - value vector ( p0 ) reflects the fact that the number of probes ( n ) corresponds to a smaller number of cnv regions ( n ) ( see figure 5c ) .
controlling for false positives may in some cases require investigating subject - level data ( profile of cn ratio and profile of allelic ratio ) , cnv frequencies , and the genomic distance between the different signals .
correlated signals from probes adjacent to each other 's would indicate a partially detected cnv ( i.e. , disrupted cnv prediction ) while isolated signals located on different chromosome would more likely correspond to spurious associations .
increasing the stringency filter on very rare cnvs ( e.g. , removing cnvs with frequency smaller than 1 / 1000 ) might avoid the latter issue .
analysis of common and rare cnvs distinction should be made between analyzing common and rare cnvs .
common cnv shared by > 1 % of the population are referred to as cnps .
cnps correspond mostly to ancestral events and segregate in the population with different allele frequencies [ owing to the fact that many are multi - allelic ( redon et al. , 2006 ; mccarroll et al. , 2008 )] .
studies from the wtccc ( wellcome trust case control consortium et al. , 2010 ) found that only very few cnps were likely to be associated with common diseases .
it is likely that the effect size of cnps is modest , and that lack of standardization between studies and small - sample size challenge the identification of association signal .
instead of discrete ( continuous ) , cn genotypes are preferred to be tested ( mccarroll , 2008 ) .
a number of software ( wang et al. , 2007a ; mccarroll et al. , 2008 ; greenman et al. , 2010 ; van loo et al. , 2010 ) packages exist to compute cn genotypes rendering such analyses possible .
for rare cnv association studies , a large sample size is needed to obtain the required statistical power .
this can be achieved by pooling data from different cohorts ( walters et al. , 2010 ; jacquemont et al. , 2011 ) .
this task is challenging due to the differences between cohorts , platform vendors ( and thus genomic content ) , analytical methods and even fdr .
re - analysis of these cohorts genotyped on more homogeneous platforms would enable rare cnv - gwas possible ( voight et al. , 2012 ) .
also , other illumina chips share the vast majority of the illumina370 probe set , which can be a common set of probes to use .
meta - analysis of case - control associations can be extended to rare variants .
for binary traits , collecting case and control counts for a given cnv facilitates efficient meta - analysis .
for continuous traits , however , inverse - variance weighting meta - analysis may be sensitive to slight deviations from normality of the test statistics , thus requiring robust extensions .
toward better methods for cnv - gwas most of the association tests rely on discrete cn classification ( hard - classification ) .
given the cn prediction uncertainty and the important false - positive rate , hard - classification is no longer sufficient ( barnes et al. , 2008 ) .
we showed previously that for snp - based gwas , modeling genotype uncertainty was significantly better than using called genotypes when data were of low quality ( kutalik et al. , 2011 ) .
specific strategies have been proposed for cnv - gwas : the case - control framework from barnes et al .
( 2008 ) that applies likelihood ratio testing of cn ratio in cases and controls ; the modeling of cn state probabilities in logistic regression ( xu et al. , 2011 ) and methods that can test the cn ratio from family - based design ( ionita - laza et al. , 2008 ; murphy et al. , 2010 ) .
since cnvs segregate at different frequencies in different ancestral populations ( jakobsson et al. , 2008 ) , recent improvements in snp - gwas ( kang et al. , 2010 ) accounting for population structure via mixed - models could be readily extended to cnv - gwas .
burden tests designed for snvs ( yang et al. , 2008 ; asimit and zeggini , 2010 ; neale et al. , 2011 ; asimit et al. , 2012 ; kinnamon et al. , 2012 ; lee et al. , 2012a,b ; chen et al. , 2013 ) could also be adopted to combine rare aberrant cn events in a region .
cnv and biological / clinical interpretation the importance of rare cnvs emerged with a few gwas ( glessner et al. , 2010 ; grozeva et al. , 2010 ; prakash et al. , 2010 ) and many candidate studies ( de cid et al. , 2009 ; bochukova et al. , 2010 ; walters et al. , 2010 ; williams et al. , 2010 ; jacquemont et al. , 2011 ; pagnamenta et al. , 2011 ) .
to date , more than 291,801 cnv regions [ from 53 studies , see release dated as november 23 , 2012 from the dgv database ( iafrate et al. , 2004 )] have been identified in the general population and cnvs linked with 65 genomic syndromes are described in decipher ( firth et al. , 2009 ) for more than 7600 patients. with the advent of ngs projects aiming at clinical diagnosis ( vasta et al. , 2009 ; lupski et al. , 2010 ; bainbridge et al. , 2011 ; bamshad et al. , 2011 ; isidor et al. , 2011 ; calvo et al. , 2012 ; haack et al. , 2012 ; koser et al. , 2012 ; neveling et al. , 2012 ) , thousands of variants can be expected per patient .
this poses many problems to clinical labs on how to filter , prioritize , and interpret variants that might potentially be associated with disease susceptibility , progression , and possibly response to treatment .
figure 6a summarizes possible strategies that we discuss below .

( c ) genes ranking based on text - mining approaches ( prioritization ) .
( d ) visualization in genome browser ( genomic characterization ) .
cnv genomic characterization the first step to understand the potential impact of a single cnv is to investigate its genomic context .
for e.g. , if the cnv is located within / near a gene , the gene annotation may already provide valuable information ( figure 6d ) .
vicinity of repeats [ including segmental duplications and l1 retrotransposon ( zhang et al. , 2009 )] as well as specific non - b dna conformation ( bacolla and wells , 2004 ) can be indicative about a genesis mechanism .
presence of mirna coding sequences , dnase hypersensitive clusters and chip - seq binding sites can be clues about possible transcription regulation .
overlap with previously reported hits from snp - gwas can also help to pinpoint a particular gene or biological process .
a number of tools allow sequence - based annotation and to visualize large amounts of data ( fiume et al. , 2012 ; flicek et al. , 2012 ; kuhn et al. , 2013 ) .
genome browsers of numerous large - scale datasets such as those from the encode project ( encode project consortium et al. , 2012 ) proved to be a great asset for cnv annotation , in particular to offer regulatory evidence and facilitate explanation regarding the putative cnv impact in a large range of tissues .
these tools and datasets are now widely used by biologists and clinicians to annotate and prioritize their variants .
a recent and noticeable addition is the variant effect predictor ( mclaren et al. , 2010 ) ( vep , formerly known as the snp effect predictor ) .
this tool allows annotating snp , indels , and cnvs from any species using highly curated data from ensembl ( flicek et al. , 2012 ) .
vep can be used directly from within the ensembl genome browser ( usage limited to 750 variants ) , or remotely using the ensembl api , or even locally using a stand - alone script ( no limitation on the number of variants to be analyzed ) .
documentation and source code can be retrieved from variant effect predictor1 .
currently vep provides indication about the possible consequences as described by the sequence ontology ( eilbeck et al. , 2005 ) ; checks for overlap with known regulatory features and whether the variant falls in a high information part of a transcription factor binding site ; check for previously reported variant at the same location and report frequencies from the 1000 genomes project for known variant .
for snps , vep also provides allele / genotype frequencies , a list of tagged variants ( as well as ld calculation ) and predictions from sift ( kumar et al. , 2009 ) and polyphen ( adzhubei et al. , 2010 ) .
future development of vep will annotate variants with data from animal studies , human clinvar2 , orphanet3 , lsdbs ( hgvs lsdbs listing ) 4 , and summary - level data from decipher v55 , uk10k6 , and ega ( the european genome - phenome archive ) 7 .
investigating the putative functional impact assessing the functional impact of cnvs can be achieved by assessing protein levels or kinase phosphorylation status to determine whether transduction signal in a disease - relevant pathways might potentially be affected by the variant of interest ( dos santos et al. , 2004 ) ; up to " engineering " the dna variation in model organisms and study the impact on development .
this latter strategy was successfully applied in our quest of candidate genes associated with microcephaly ( jacquemont et al. , 2011 ) ( figure 6b ) .
although such experimental analyses are best to dissect the molecular mechanisms and consequences induced by genomic variants ; these analyses are challenging and not adapted for large number of candidates .
since cnv can affect gene expression levels ( stranger et al. , 2007 ; dimas et al. , 2009 ; henrichsen et al. , 2009 ) assessing whether a list of candidates can potentially induce differential expression ( ideally in the same patients ) can help with investigating putative cnv downstream consequences .
assessing gene expression levels for a subset of the cohort ( with microarrays , targeted approaches , or even rna - seq ) is currently possible with relatively affordable costs for any large - scale genetic study .
a caveat to these expression analyses is that the appropriate target tissue is not always available .
most frequently , such analyses are performed on rna derived from blood cells ; e.g. , immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines .
although it can be a good starting point before further investigation , in the foreseeable future using ips - derived specialized cells would provide better insights .
investigating the putative clinical impact assessing the clinical impact of a genetic variant is definitely not a trivial task : it requires carefully designed studies and is generally outside of the scope of the initial study that has identified the variant of interest .
this section discusses available resources that could help building a priori knowledge about the putative impact of a cnv before designing subsequent studies .
family studies can bring some evidence in support of an association between a cnv and a phenotype .
genetic diagnostic labs routinely use such strategies but the interpretation of these segregation analyses are often hampered by partial penetrance of the cnv under investigation .
for instance , a cnv may have been inherited from an unaffected parent and yet be a major factor contributing to the trait in the child ( girirajan et al. , 2012 ) .
to help address this issue , in depth clinical phenotyping of the patients ( and their relatives ) as well as sharing clinical case between diagnostic labs are helpful .
but ultimately , additional case - control studies are needed .
today , cnvs identified by clinical labs can be shared through the decipher interface ( firth et al. , 2009 ) .
decipher is an online repository of cnv and phenotype data whose goal is to enable the clinical interpretation of cn variation ( corpas et al. , 2012 ) .
the web interface includes a number of tracks ( associated syndrome , cnv consensus track , haplo - insufficiency track ) that facilitate data interpretation .
other databases have collected cnvs from publications .
although these databases are good resources , they should be used with great caution in the clinical setting ( duclos et al. , 2011 ) mostly because within these databases , cnvs were detected in populations whose participants were not necessarily ascertained clinically and because the cnv frequencies from these studies are not comparable due to differences in design , platform , analytical pipeline , and false - discovery rate .
prioritization of many candidate cnvs the above approaches are useful when a limited number of candidates are to be investigated .
to date , software such as cartagenia are efficient at prioritizing large cnvs (> 200 kb ) related to diagnosing developmental delay in the clinic .
in the research context , when the number of cnvs is much larger , in silico methods are needed to prioritize and filter the calls .
although there is globally a lack of prioritization methods , a number of existing approaches , used in gene expression and snp - gwas can be useful .
these approaches include text - mining approaches , geneset enrichment analyses , and network - guided analyses .
text - mining approaches text - mining is a powerful way to mine the scientific literature and identify links between a concept term ( such as a disease name or a mesh term ) and a given gene ( rebholz - schuhmann et al. , 2012 ) .
a number of tools already exist ( tranchevent et al. , 2008 , 2011 ; liekens et al. , 2011 ) and are useful to rank a list of genes in the vicinity of candidate cnvs or simply to identify new concepts / genes that link a gene of interest to a disease ( figure 6c ) .
an inherent limitation is that genes that have been extensively studied can influence the ranking .
depending on the statistical framework of the method , genes listed in many publications might be better ranked than genes described with fewer reports .
figure 6c shows that although kctd13 was involved in microcephaly in zebrafish , it only ranked 13th out of the 29 genes involved in the 16p11.2 cnv while the mapk3 gene ranked first .
nevertheless using multiple algorithms / ontologies ( malik et al. , 2006 ; yu et al. , 2008 ) and / or using a training set of genes for a biological process of interest ( tranchevent et al. , 2008 ) are simple ways to improve the prediction performance .
geneset enrichment analyses geneset enrichment analyses are very popular in gene expression studies and test the overlap with a given biological annotation ( molecular pathway , ontology ) .
several resources are available such as david ( huang et al. , 2009 ) , gsea ( subramanian et al. , 2005 ) , and gostat ( beissbarth and speed , 2004 ) .
these methods have a number of caveats ( pavlidis et al. , 2012 ; tamayo et al. , 2012 ) and the results require critical interpretation .
therefore combining several recent methods ( richards et al. , 2010 ; geistlinger et al. , 2011 ) as well as thorough ( expert ) biological interpretation ( to check consistency and relevance of the final annotation ) is needed to avoid story - telling ( pavlidis et al. , 2012 ) .
network - based analyses a number of studies ( cancer genome atlas research network , 2008 ; berger et al. , 2010 ; cerami et al. , 2010 ; lango allen et al. , 2010 ; millstein et al. , 2011 ; valsesia et al. , 2011 ; lee et al. , 2012c ) have been successful by integrating both genomic variants and gene expression , into networks of protein - protein interactions and by identifying sub - networks made of proteins significantly connected to each other , and corresponding to genes / transcripts affected with structural variations and / or differential gene expressions .
such clustering analyses allow restricting a list of candidate genes to those whose products are known ( or predicted ) to interact with each other , thereby enriching for genes potentially participating to a same biological process .
furthermore these network - guided analyses allow flexibility in that genes apparently " unaffected " in the dataset but significantly linking other " affected genes " can be identified .
indeed this strategy was successfully applied to glioblastoma ( gbm ) ( cerami et al. , 2010 ) and identified relevant candidate genes linking known gbm 's genes .
today , researchers can construct their own network of interactions from gene expression data and text - mining approaches .
such networks are referred as prior knowledge networks ( pkns ) .
using disease - relevant pkns ( from focused literature and / or relevant gene expression datasets ) provides a powerful strategy to connect genes affected by cnvs .
many methods have been proposed to identify snps associated with clinical trait using network - guided analyses ( wang et al. , 2007b ; raychaudhuri et al. , 2009 ; lango allen et al. , 2010 ; kasarskis et al. , 2011 ; lee et al. , 2011 ; millstein et al. , 2011 ; rossin et al. , 2011 ; glaab et al. , 2012 ) .
in fact , these methods are often used in snp - gwas and in drug discovery projects .
applying those methods on cnvs and in combination with relevant pkns is very appealing for the detection and clinical interpretation of cnv sub - networks .
discussion numerous studies have documented cnvs in a genome - wide fashion and their impact on disease and evolution is clearly established .
yet the detection of cnvs and subsequent association with clinical and functional phenotypes remains very challenging .
remarkable improvements have been made to call cnvs from recent platforms , yet older generation arrays have not been mined extensively due to a lack of standards ( valsesia et al. , 2012 ) .
today , tremendous efforts are invested in ngs projects .
although methods to detect indels and cnvs are still being developed , thousands of structural variants are expected for a single individual .
the lack of gold standard , the heterogeneity across platforms and methods , as well as the massive amount of data generated constitute a great challenge for result interpretations .
these issues have been known for several years ( pinto et al. , 2011 ) , yet the cnv community has not agreed on any standards .
such standards could potentially be set by large genomic projects like the 1000 genome project ( the 1000 genomes project consortium , 2012 ) or large biomedical projects like ddd ( firth et al. , 2011 ) ( deciphering developmental disorders ) , a decipher initiative .
the largest study to date has revealed very few examples of associations between common cnvs ( cnps ) and common disease ( wellcome trust case control consortium et al. , 2010 ) .
moreover , all of the cnps involved in these associations are well tagged by snps .
association between rare cnvs and common / complex disease has been demonstrated with several candidate approaches ( mccarthy et al. , 2009 ; walters et al. , 2010 ; jacquemont et al. , 2011 ) and several large cnvs (> 100 kb ) from genome - wide analyses have been found associated with schizophrenia as well as other neuro - developmental disorders ( international schizophrenia consortium , 2008 ; stefansson et al. , 2008 ; walsh et al. , 2008 ; xu et al. , 2008 ; kirov et al. , 2009 ; williams et al. , 2010 ; cooper et al. , 2011 ; grozeva et al. , 2012 ; malhotra and sebat , 2012 ) .
yet the literature remains sparse regarding successful genome - wide investigations for other traits / diseases or regarding smaller cnvs .
this highlights the need ( 1 ) for new methods for cnv - gwas , ( 2 ) to re - investigate study design with family - based design instead of case - control design with unrelated controls ( from the general population ) , and ( 3 ) for thorough clinical phenotyping .
many visualization platforms and analytical methods are available for understanding the impact of ( coding ) snps and somatic mutations .
yet little ( almost nothing ) is available for clinical interpretation of indels and cnvs .
presently a few companies develop and sell software to research and clinical labs .
beside the cost of these tools , these are often regarded as black boxes .
the underlying algorithms and code are not made available thus the user cannot check whether state - of - art methods are used and cannot understand in finer details how the result was obtained .
the functionalities are often limited to data management and visualization .
only a few basic analyses are provided for clinical interpretation and there is very little flexibility to expand the existing functionalities or even to integrate new ones .
in this review , we have highlighted a number of strategies for cnv clinical interpretation .
although those methodologies are not necessarily available within a single software , there are numerous individual and freely available tools that can be used. with the rapid evolution of the different platforms and analytical methods there are knowledge gaps to be filled .
these gaps can range from the appropriate design of a large - scale genetic study , to the different steps from data generation to computational analyses , results validation , and interpretation .
today , there is a need for computer - literate biologists and clinicians , as well as bioinformaticians embedded within wet - labs and clinical diagnostic labs .
to improve the communication between the different actors , there is a strong need for developing cross - competencies and to use a common vocabulary .
most clinicians have access to continuous education ; similarly biologists and bioinformaticians can benefit from various university formations / seminars .
continuing these efforts is worthwhile and additional formations focused onto the interpretation of omics - data in a clinical setting are needed .
these synergies and complementarities between the different parties , as well as a shared common knowledge are critical components to progress toward a better data interpretation and hopefully toward personalized medicine .
finally , extensive and accurate phenotyping , as well as data sharing using centralized and secure databases like decipher , are essential to speed - up the cnv clinical interpretation and to bridge between research and diagnostic labs .
perspectives today the pathogenic contribution of cnvs to rare inherited diseases is well established , yet the contribution to complex traits remains unclear .
in addition , most genotyping assays rely on markers that do not violate mendelian inheritance principles and that are in good hardy - weinberg equilibrium in the general population ( hapmap ) .
this excludes genomic regions that are highly dynamic ( like segmental duplications or low - complexity regions ) and that are subject to recurrent cn changes. with the recent improvements in the ngs field ( longer reads , higher sequencing depth , newer mapping methods ) , analysis of these regions becomes possible ( although very challenging ) .
careful investigation of these regions , using existing data from sequencing projects and future sequencing data generated in clinical labs , might reveal interesting insights regarding the cnv aspect of the so - called missing heritability .
in the near future , the cnv field would benefit from ( 1 ) ongoing large sequencing projects like the 1000 genomes to learn more about genome plasticity ; ( 2 ) access to newer genotyping arrays that cover previously untagged snps ; ( 3 ) developing open - access bioinformatics solution to facilitate and support clinical diagnosis ; ( 4 ) establishing standards for clinical diagnosis and provide appropriate training to all the different players including physicians , biologists , and data analysts , and ( 5 ) further encouraging efforts on extensive phenotyping and data sharing between clinical and research labs .

in recent years , a significant amount of research has examined the controversial role of activin a in cancer .
activin a , a member of the transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) superfamily , is best characterized for its function during embryogenesis in mesoderm cell fate differentiation and reproduction .
during embryogenesis , tgfbeta superfamily ligands , tgfbeta , bone morphogenic proteins ( bmps ) and activins , act as potent morphogens .
similar to tgfbetas and bmps , activin a is a protein that is highly systemically expressed during early embryogenesis ; however , post - natal expression is overall reduced and remains under strict spatiotemporal regulation. of importance , normal post - natal expression of activin a has been implicated in the migration and invasive properties of various immune cell types , as well as endometrial cells .
aberrant activin a signaling during development results in significant morphological defects and premature mortality .
interestingly , activin a has been found to have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in cancer .
investigations into the role of activin a in prostate and breast cancer has demonstrated tumor suppressive effects , while in lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , it has been consistently shown that activin a expression is correlated with increased proliferation , invasion and poor patient prognosis .
activin a signaling is highly context - dependent , which is demonstrated in studies of epithelial cell tumors and the microenvironment .
this review discusses normal activin a signaling in comparison to tgfbeta and highlights how its dysregulation contributes to cancer progression and cell invasion .
tgfbeta activin a cell adhesion cell migration emt cancer 1 .
introduction as a growing body of research has unraveled the functional consequences of transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) superfamily signaling , it has also revealed the complexity of these signaling networks and their pleiotropic effects .
this family of ligands consists of tgfbeta , bone morphogenic proteins ( bmps ) , activins and anti - mullerian hormone ( amh ) proteins. of these proteins , tgfbeta and bmps have been well characterized for their roles in development , angiogenesis and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) during cancer , particularly regarding cell migration and invasion [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] .
conversely , activin a signaling is less well understood .
activins are homo - or hetero - dimers of activin beta subunits .
currently , there are three known bioactive activin dimers : activins a ( betaabetaa ) , b ( betabbetab ) and ab ( betaabetab ) [ 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 ] .
activin a is best understood for its function in embryogenesis and reproduction ; however , its role during cancer progression is still not well documented .
this review focuses on the current understanding of normal activin a signaling , the functional similarities and differences between activin a and tgfbeta and how this signaling pathway becomes dysregulated during cancer progression , influencing cell migration and invasion .
understanding the regulatory mechanism of activin a in cell migration and invasion will allow for better insight into its role in cancer initiation and progression .
2. signaling regulation 2.1 .
activin a and tgfbeta signaling though activin a and tgfbeta show structural similarity , activin a is secreted as an active protein , whereas tgfbeta is secreted as an inactive precursor and requires activation [ 16 ] .
multiple proteins have been identified that can activate latent tgfbeta , including proteolytic processing by plasmin and cathepsin d , as well as nonproteolytic processing by heat and detergents [ 17 ] .
not only do tgfbeta superfamily ligands share structural similarity ( they share six to nine cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds ) , the receptor complexes often overlap ligand specificity and downstream signal transduction [ 18 ] .
tgfbeta receptor complexes are heteromeric complexes that consist of a type i and type ii receptor homodimer [ 19 ] .
type ii and i receptors are distinguished by their sequence .
type ii receptors are constitutively active transmembrane serine / threonine kinases [ 20 ] .
these receptors initially bind a tgfbeta superfamily ligand to recruit a type i receptor and begin the signal transduction cascade .
the number of known type ii receptors is limited : transforming growth factor beta receptor ii ( tgfbetarii ) preferentially binds tgfbeta ; bone morphogenic protein receptor ii ( bmprii ) is known to bind multiple ligands , including inhibin a ; activin receptor type ii and iib ( actrii / iib ) bind several ligands , of particular interest activin a , inhibin a / b , and nodal ; and the mullerian inhibitory substance type ii receptor ( misrii ) , which is only known to bind amh ( summarized in [ 21 ]) .
type i receptors , commonly termed activin receptor - like kinases ( alks ) , contain highly - conserved kinase domains and a glycine - serine rich juxtamembrane domain , a necessary component for their phosphorylation and activation [ 22,23 ] .
to date , seven alks ( alk1 - 7 ) are known and have been characterized .
these receptors have been succinctly summarized elsewhere [ 21 ] .
tgfbeta has been shown to preferentially signal through alk5 ( tbetari ) , while activin a signals primarily via alk4 [ 24 ] .
interestingly , alk5 and alk4 show almost identical kinase domains ; however , they dimerize with different type ii receptors [ 25 ] .
focusing specifically on activin a signaling , the signaling pathway begins with an active activin a ligand secreted from the cell .
activin a binds to actrii / iib , which recruits a type i receptor , preferentially alk4 , to form a signal transducing heterodimer [ 9,26,27,28 ] .
in a similar mechanism to tgfbeta signaling , smad2 / 3 is recruited and phosphorylated by alk4 .
active smad2 / 3 is released into the cytoplasm and complexes with the co - smad , smad4 .
this complex translocates to the nucleus , where it binds to smad binding elements , with the consensus sequence caga , to drive transcription of downstream effectors ( figure 1a ) .
in addition to this canonical activin a pathway , non - canonical signaling , such as akt / pi3k , mapk / erk and wnt / beta - catenin , have been associated with activin a function independently of smad activation ( figure 1b ) [ 29,30 ] .
despite their overlapping smad - dependent or non - canonical pathways , activin a and tgfbeta operate through common , as well as distinct , downstream transcriptional targets , resulting in different functional consequences [ 31,32,33,34,35 ] .
due to the overlapping signal transduction pathway of activin a and tgfbeta , it is difficult to untangle specific downstream transcriptional targets for the respective pathways .
the best - defined differential downstream targets of activin a and tgfbeta signaling are in the context of human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) .
in hescs , activin a drives downstream transcription of nanog , whereas tgfbeta signaling in this context induces the transcription of sry - box 2 ( sox2 ) and octamer binding protein - 4 ( oct4 ) to induce self - renewal and differentiation , which is negatively regulated through the activation of bmp signaling [ 36,37,38,39 ] .
in adult tissues , discerning between activin a and tgfbeta signaling is more difficult .
both activin a and tgfbeta , via the smad2 / 3 / 4 complex , have been shown to regulate various cell cycle and extracellular matrix proteins , such as p15 , plasminogen activator - 1 ( pai - 1 ) and collagen i [ 40 ]. with the advent of new methodologies , future research should focus on unweaving differential activin a and tgfbeta signaling in post - natal tissues .
2.2 .
mechanism of activin a regulation activin a expression is tightly regulated .
regulators of the activin a signaling cascade can be found in the extracellular matrix , at the cell membrane and intracellularly ( figure 2a,b ) [ 41,42,43 ] .
as there are numerous mechanisms of activin a regulation , we have focused specifically on the most studied , best understood mechanisms of activin a regulation , follistatin and inhibin a , endogenous inhibitors found at the cell membrane and in circulation [ 44,45,46,47 ] .
follistatin is expressed in three forms , follistatin - 288 , follistatin - 303 and follistatin - 315 [ 48,49 ] , with different modes of action ( figure 2a ) .
two follistatin proteins surround and inhibit activin a by blocking access to both the activin receptor type i and ii binding sites [ 45,50,51 ] .
follistatin - 288 , which is mainly found at the cell membrane , sequesters activin a , resulting in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,51,52,53,54 ] .
follistatin - 288 function itself can be regulated through cleavage at the cell surface by heparin and function in circulation [ 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,51,54,55 ] .
follistatin - 303 is produced in relatively low abundance compared to the other follistatin isoforms and has moderate affinity for cell surface proteoglycans , but can bind activin a in circulation , as well as at the cell membrane [ 1,9,26,27,28,37,49 ] .
the effects of activin a signaling can also be counteracted by a structurally - related ligand , inhibin a. inhibin a is a heterodimer composed of inhibin alpha and betaa subunits [ 29,30,56,57 ] .
inhibin a , bound to the transmembrane receptor , betaglycan ( tbriii ) , dimerizes with actrii / iib , preventing activin a binding [ 31,32,33,34,35,58,59 ] .
tgfbeta signaling demonstrates similar levels of regulation , indicating the importance of maintaining the signaling balance of this superfamily [ 2,4,6,41,42,43,60,61 ] .
additional mechanisms of activin a regulation on the extra - and intra - cellular levels are shown in figure 2 .
figure 1 schematic of activin a signaling .
( a ) canonical activin a signaling occurs through the phosphorylation and activation of the smad proteins , leading to downstream gene transcription .
( b ) non - canonical activin a signaling has been postulated through a variety of pathways , including p13k / akt , mapk / erk and beta - catenin / p300 .
figure 2 extra - and intra - cellular regulation of activin a signaling .
( a ) activin a is tightly regulated at the extracellular level by both extracellular matrix ( follistatin - 288 , follistatin - 315 , follistatin - related protein , alpha2 - macroglobin , left - right determination factor 1 ( lefty1 ) , inhibin a ) and membrane - bound proteins ( betaglycan , cripto , bambi , inhbp / inhibin b , follistatin - 288 ) .
( b ) in the cytoplasm , canonical activin a signaling is controlled during each step of the smad cascade .
3. hijacked developmental processes and their contributions in tumorigenesis 3.1 .
early development and stem cell biology embryonic development requires particular populations of cells to undergo emt , migration and complete implantation and gastrulation [ 44,45,46,47,56,62 ] .
activin a plays a significant part in this process .
initially described as xtc - mif , activin a was found to be a potent morphogen and inducer of the mesodermal patterning [ 11,13,15,26,48,49,63,64 ]. with increasing concentrations , activin a can induce mesodermal cell differentiation , inducing epidermal cell fate at the lowest concentrations , as well as spemann organizer patterning at the highest concentrations [ 9,26,27,28,45,50,51,61,65,66 ] .
spatial patterning occurs via a diffusible activin a concentration gradient in the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) [ 29,67 ] .
interestingly , tgfbeta plays a minor role in these developmental processes .
similar to activin a , tgfbeta diffuses along a similar gradient ; however , it does not induce the same spectrum of cell fates as activin a does and requires a much higher concentration of tgfbeta ligand [ 31,51,54,68 ] .
in human development , activin a is necessary to maintain pluripotency and the subsequent differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells ( hpsc ) [ 50,69 ] .
prolonged treatment of hpsc with activin a induces definitive endoderm differentiation [ 52,70 ] .
during early hpsc differentiation , activin / nodal signaling is critical to induce epithelial - mesodermal switching , indicated by the loss of the epithelial marker , cd326 ( epithelial cell adhesion molecule , epcam ) , and upregulation of mesodermal marker cd56 ( neural cell adhesion molecule 1 , ncam1 ) [ 55,59,71 ] .
activin a , in concert with nodal , signals through smad2 / 3 to induce nanog expression , which is necessary to maintain the expression of genes involved in pluripotency [ 1,3,7,37 ] .
maintaining pluripotency in cells is necessary , not only to achieve proper development , but also to initiate and sustain tumorigenesis .
activin a has been shown to be necessary for the maintenance of self - renewal in human embryonic stem cells through the induction of oct4 , nanog , nodal and wingless - type mmtv integration site family member 3 ( wnt3 ) [ 36 ] and , more importantly , the induction of basic fibroblast growth factor 2 ( fgf - 2 ) and suppression of bmp7 [ 72 ] .
suppression of the downstream target inhibitor of dna binding 2 ( id2 ) by activin a and tgfbeta is central in the induction of emt , which is antagonized by bmps [ 73 ]. of interest , emt is associated with the acquisition of malignant traits and stem cell markers , therefore linking tgfbeta signaling to the regulation of cancer stem cells [ 74 ] .
3.2 .
emt vs. collective migration different members of the tgfbeta superfamily ( tgfbeta1 , tgfbeta2 , tgfbeta3 , activin a or bmp7 ) have been analyzed for their potential to induce emt in epithelial cells of different origins .
while tgfbeta1 , tgfbeta2 and tgfbeta3 induce characteristic features of emt in the mammary and lung cells along with the downregulation and delocalization of e - cadherin , activin a does not induce emt in mammary cells or keratinocytes , but causes the scattering and spindle - like morphology of lung cells [ 75 ] .
as emt is widely recognized to lead to increased cell invasion , loss of e - cadherin is a hallmark of emt [ 76 ] .
tgfbeta participates in the emt process through the regulation of transcription factors , such as snail family zinc finger 1 ( snail ) , zinc finger e - box binding homeobox 1 ( zeb ) and twist family bhlh transcription factor 1 ( twist ) , which suppress the e - cadherin expression .
e - cadherin repressors function as emt inducers on multiple levels , but when cells at the invasive front lose e - cadherin expression , single cell migration occurs [ 77 ] .
yet , cell migration in a cohesive group is a hallmark of the tissue remodeling events that underlie embryonic morphogenesis , wound repair and cancer invasion [ 78 ] .
the mode of sheet migration relies on the cooperative guidance of leader and follower cells throughout the collective group .
tgfbeta has been shown to stimulate collective migration primarily through extracellular - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) activation [ 79 ] .
on the other hand , using a three - dimensional organotypic culture system , we have described that inhibition of tgfbeta signaling increases collection into the underlying extracellular matrix in a fibroblast - and mmp - dependent manner [ 80 ] .
additional research has demonstrated that tumor cell knockout of tgfbeta signaling , through deletion of the type ii receptor , drives fibroblast - stimulated collective migration and metastasis [ 81 ] .
3.3 .
wound healing and regeneration embryogenesis and wound healing enlist similar processes , such as the programmed death of unneeded or damaged cells and cell migration .
wound healing is an elaborate , tightly - regulated process : briefly , following tissue injury , growth factors and cytokines are released at the wound site .
injured vessels begin to clot due to the deposition of ecm proteins , such as fibronectin and collagen , and form granulation tissue .
over the course of the next several days to weeks , immune cells and fibroblasts infiltrate the granulation tissue , ridding it of debris and rebuilding the matrix [ 10,12,14,56 ] .
throughout the process , all cell types require the ability to move , replace and reform tissue .
in zebrafish , activin a is required for tissue regeneration following injury , while inhibition of signaling completely blocks regeneration [ 58,82,83,84 ] .
in a mouse model of wound repair , increased inhba , which encodes the mouse betaa subunit , was observed in wound granulation tissue within one day of injury and was sustained for seven days [ 2,4,6,9,61,85 ] .
as follistatin levels increased concurrently with inhibin betaa levels , it has been suggested that the availability of the activin a ligand , not receptor occupation , regulates the wound response [ 9,26,28,56,85 ] .
activin a levels become quickly elevated in wounded tissues , likely due to the early inflammatory response [ 11,13,15,26,63,64,86 ] .
however , as demonstrated in embryogenesis , activin a operates in a concentration - dependent manner .
when activin a is overexpressed in the skin , wounds heal more quickly , however being associated with substantial fibrosis [ 27,61,66,87,88,89 ] .
tgfbeta has been highly characterized to promote a reactive stroma [ 65,89,90 ] .
similarly to activin a , tgfbeta can support all aspects of wound granulation tissue , such as attracting macrophages and fibroblasts to the injury site , initiate wound angiogenesis and stimulate ecm deposition and inflammation [ 50,67,91 ] .
during wound healing , activin a and tgfbeta function in similar roles .
4. contributions to tumorigenesis harold dvorak elegantly described cancer as being " the wound that does not heal " .
activin a and tgfbeta are excellent examples of this phenomenon , as they both show similar functions in development and wound healing to that observed in cancer initiation and progression .
interestingly , both ligands demonstrate cell type and context - dependent roles within the tumor microenvironment , illustrated below ( figure 3 ) .
4.1 .
epithelial tumors as the role of activin a has been explored in a variety of epithelial tumors , differences in action emerged between cancers .
it has been shown that activin a can exert a primarily protective function [ 51,52,54,68,92 ] .
experiments utilizing patient - derived prostate cancer cells and non - invasive lncap have demonstrated that treatment with activin a results in cell cycle arrest [ 45,93,94,95 ] .
interestingly , lncap cells showed no response when treated with the exogenous tgfbeta ligand [ 96,97 ] .
in contrast , activin a treatment of the more aggressive prostate cancer cell line pc3 resulted in an increase in proliferation [ 69,98 ] .
recent evidence has implicated endoglin , a tgfbeta type iii receptor and co - receptor , in cancer cell invasion in prostate cancer cell lines via activin a signaling , though endoglin has primarily been shown to propagate the signal by forming a complex with tgfbeta and its receptors [ 99 ] .
co - expression of endoglin and actriia , when expressed on pc3 or du - 145 cells , has shown suppressed cancer cell invasion , while co - expression of endoglin with actriib , bmp and tgfbeta does not exhibit this effect .
this functional effect is likely mediated through non - canonical smad signaling ; however , the mechanism of action needs to be further explored [ 100 ] .
additionally , tgfbeta has an oncogenic effect on pc3 cells , as well as the breast cancer cell line , mda - mb - 231 .
when acting via the non - canonical mapk / traf6 pathway , tgfbeta induces a pro - migratory , invasive phenotype [ 70,101 ] .
an in vitro analysis of 15 breast cancer cell lines detected activin a expression in only four cell lines [ 59,71,102 ] .
functionally , when treated with activin a , t47d cells showed the induction of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and the cell cycle control protein p15ink4b , as well as the downregulation of cyclin a , resulting in increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest .
similarly , mcf7 cells , which have no detectable endogenous activin a , are highly sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of activin a [ 1,3,5,7 ] .
in early tumorigenesis , tgfbeta has been shown to have a similar effect .
in an overlapping pathway to activin a signaling , tgfbeta induces cell cycle arrest through the induction of the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors p15ink4b , p16ink4a , p21 and p27 [ 8,10,12,14 ] .
however , in some cancers , tumor cells lose their ability to respond to the growth inhibitory effects of both activin a and tgfbeta .
this occurs primarily through mutation or downregulation of the receptor ; however , this is not always the case [ 2,4,6,82,83,84,103 ] .
in contrast to its characteristic growth inhibitory effects , activin a expression has also been associated with inducing an invasive phenotype in certain cancers ( figure 3 ) .
in lung adenocarcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinomas , for example , activin a overexpression is correlated with positive lymph node status and poor patient prognosis [ 9,11,13,15,85,104,105 ] .
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , increased activin a has been hypothesized to be an independent prognostic marker of survival [ 9,26,27,28,85,106 ] .
in vitro treatment of the lung cancer cell lines , h460 and sklu1 , with recombinant activin a showed increased proliferation [ 26,29,30,63,86,107,108,109 ] .
additionally , treatment with recombinant activin a increased invasion in the ovarian cancer cell lines , skov - 3 and occ1 , without impacting proliferation [ 110 ] .
mmp - 7 , a matrix metalloproteinase capable of degrading many components of the ecm and activating additional mmps responsible for increased cell invasion , is upregulated in the presence of activin a [ 31,32,33,34,35,87,88,89,109 ] .
this occurs through c - jun / smad activity inducing mmp - 7 transcription via the ap - 1 promoter region [ 41,42,43,89,90,111 ] .
additionally , in vitro and clinical evidence suggest that activin a may drive cell invasion by upregulating n - cadherin , a marker of mesenchymal cells and invasiveness [ 44,45,46,47,50,91,112 ] .
n - cadherin expression is positively correlated with activin a , regardless of e - cadherin expression [ 48,49,52,92,113,114,115 ] .
in a similar mechanism to activin a , tgfbeta has also been shown to promote cancer cell progression .
tgfbeta is a potent inducer of emt through its canonical smad signaling pathway , as demonstrated in various cancer cell types .
tgfbeta prompts the expression of snail family zinc finger 2 ( slug ) , snail and twist , which act to repress e - cadherin expression [ 8,45,50,51,58,93,94,103 ] .
emt can also be induced through tgfbeta non - canonical signaling pathways .
it has been recently demonstrated that tgfbeta can act through traf6 to promote receptor cleavage of alk5 / tbetari , which allows for the cleaved intracellular domain to translocate to the nucleus and , in association with p300 , drive transcription of various invasion - promoting genes [ 8,51,52,53,54,116,117 ] .
increased expression of tgfbeta has been noted in various cancers , such as lung , breast and gastric cancers , and has been associated with poor patient prognosis [ 51,54,55,96,118 ] .
additionally , tgfbeta can stimulate and alter mmp expression from epithelial cells .
several groups have shown that tgfbeta can negatively regulate mmp - 1 and mmp - 7 through canonical smad signaling , while stimulating the production of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 through non - canonical p38 and nfkb signaling pathways [ 1,37,49,98,119 ] .
mmp production and activation are necessary for degrading ecm components , allowing for cell migration and further invasion into the stroma .
figure 3 tumor microenvironmental interactions of activin a. activin a promotes a variety of behaviors in a cell - type and context - dependent manner .
when overexpressed in the tumor , activin a confers differential effects .
some cancers , such as lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , develop insensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of activin a , one of the hallmarks of cancer [ 56,57,101,120 ] .
during cancer progression , cells in the tumor microenvironment , such as t - helper 1 ( th1 ) cells and fibroblasts , increase their production of activin a in an attempt to inhibit the growth of the tumor ; however , the cancer cells adapt and evade these signals .
tumor cells that show resistance to activin a may do so by downregulating alk4 , which is responsible for signal transduction , or by upregulating follistatin or inhibin a production ; however , these areas need to be further explored [ 58,59,102,121 ] .
4.2 .
immune cells activin a plays a key role in the maturation and activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems ( figure 3 ) .
in the normal immune response , activin a is on the forefront of fighting infection [ 1,2,4,5,6,60,61,122 ] .
in the humoral immune response , activin a is secreted by and plays a significant role in the function of adaptive immune cells .
in the t - cell population , activin a is secreted specifically by activated cd4 + cd25 - ( cd25 : interleukin 2 receptor alpha ) t - helper 2 ( th2 ) cells [ 8,56,62,123,124 ] .
however , activin a also contributes to the switching of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 - ( foxp3 : forkhead box p3 ) cells to cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t - regulatory ( treg ) cells , which correlates with immunosuppression in patients with b - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 11,13,15,26,63,64,103,125 ] .
treg cells downregulate the actions of th1 , th2 and t - helper 17 ( th17 ) cells , limiting their ability to recognize and potentially destroy cancer cells .
similarly , tgfbeta induces a similar foxp3 + treg cell phenotype [ 9,27,61,66,105,126,127 ] .
together , t - cells induced by either activin a or tgfbeta promote a pro - tumor microenvironment .
activin a induces stage - dependent effects on b - cells [ 9,26,28,65,106,127 ] .
this has been demonstrated in a variety of studies , where exogenous treatment of b - cells derived from marrow stem cells , cultured cell lines and mature b - cells can induce apoptosis in the former and proliferation and antibody secretion in the latter [ 29,65,67,107,108,109 ] .
additionally , activin a is secreted by activated b - cells , which , in turn , stimulates the production of ige antibodies [ 31,51,54,68,109,128,129 ] .
tgfbeta performs a similar function as activin a and inhibits the proliferation of progenitor b cells ; however , it also has the ability to induce growth arrest in b maturation [ 41,45,95,111 ] .
conversely , tgfbeta can drive b - cell differentiation and stimulate the production of ige and , in some cells , igg [ 44,46,47,51,53,54,112,130,131 ] .
the effect of activin a in the immune system has been most heavily studied in the macrophages , though activin a has also been shown to affect mast cells , natural killer cells and dendritic cells [ 48,97,113,114,115 ] .
as discussed above , activin a is secreted by th2 - helper cells , which also secrete high levels of interleukin - 4 ( il - 4 ) and interleukin - 13 ( il - 13 ) .
il - 4 and il - 13 promote the alternative activation pathway of macrophages , m2 , that is commonly associated with wound healing and cancer [ 8,50,58,69,103 ] .
interestingly , in vitro activin a stimulation promoted the m2 macrophage phenotype , suggesting its functional similarities to il - 4 and il - 13 in tumor promotion [ 8,52,70,117 ] .
tgfbeta also polarizes macrophages to the alternative m2 phenotype , promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment [ 55,59,71,118 ] .
these m2 macrophages secrete cytokines and mmps that promote a favorable tumor microenvironment [ 132 ] .
condeelis and pollard , in their review of the multifaceted nature of macrophages , succinctly stated that " tumors recruit macrophages and create a microenvironment that causes macrophages to suppress immune functions and , instead , adapt trophic roles found during development and repair " [ 1,3,7,37,119 ] .
this involves creating a favorable environment for tumor cell invasion and recruitment of fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the microenvironment .
for example , secretion of interleukin - 2 and interferon - alpha from t - cells drive the release of basic fibroblast growth factor , leading to the subsequent induction of endothelial cell and fibroblast migration [ 36,120 ] .
activin a and tgfbeta play important roles in this process , reasserting developmental function in the incorrect context , and promote pathogenesis .
4.3 .
fibroblasts fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment contribute to the creation of a reactive stroma or the transformed state of the stroma in response to disrupted homeostasis , wounding or cancer initiation [ 72,121 ] .
in normal physiology , fibroblasts typically express activin a at negligible levels [ 73,122 ] .
activin a stimulates proliferation of mouse 3t3 fibroblasts , airway smooth muscle cells and lung fibroblasts [ 74,123,124 ] .
interestingly , we have shown that overexpression of activin a by normal esophageal fibroblasts in a pre - neoplastic microenvironment inhibits proliferation in both an autocrine and paracrine manner ; however , it switches to a tumor promoter in the presence of malignant cells [ 133 ] .
a similar phenotype has been noted in the context of tgfbeta signaling [ 75,126 ] .
tumor - associated myofibroblasts ( tams ) of oral squamous cell carcinoma , which express markers of activation ( e.g. , alpha - smooth muscle actin ( alphasma ) , platelet - derived growth factor - alpha ( pdgfalpha ) , fibroblast activating protein ( fap )) , secrete increased levels of activin a [ 76,127,128 ] .
this was associated with increased secretion of collagen i , mmp - 1 , mmp - 2 , mmp - 9 and mmp - 13 , as well as increased proliferation and in vivo tumor volume [ 77,128 ] .
in comparison , the development of a reactive stroma has been correlated with increased secretion of tgfbeta by pre - neoplastic cells [ 65,78 ] .
however , it has been consistently shown that fibroblasts that lose responsiveness to tgfbeta promote collective cell invasion [ 79,129,130 ] .
these results suggest that , in contrast to activin a , tgfbeta signaling in the tumor stroma is necessary to maintain an intact microenvironment and prevent tumor cell invasion , though it has been suggested that tgfbeta may act through the reactive stroma , not the epithelial cell compartment , to promote tumor angiogenesis [ 2,4,6,80,134 ] .
this is a significant point , where the functional consequences of tgfbeta and activin a diverge .
tams secrete proinflammatory cytokines and proteases to drive emt and proliferation and migration of epithelial and endothelial cells [ 11,13,15,81,135,136 ] .
these results suggest that tams can prime the tumor microenvironment for epithelial cancer cell invasion by rearranging the ecm .
additionally , tams have been associated with the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells to the tumor front [ 10,12,14,27,56,98 ] .
the localization of myofibroblasts to the tumor has been indicative of poor patient prognosis [ 30,58,82,83,84,137,138 ] .
the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts at the tumor front results in an aggressive and invasive phenotype , as tumor cells use fibroblasts to alter the ecm .
4.4 .
endothelial cells in contrast to its tumor promoting function in immune cells , activin a has been consistently shown to operate as a potent anti - angiogenic factor ( figure 3 ) .
treatment of endothelial cells demonstrated decreased tube formation and inhibition of proliferation via induction of p21 and decreased expression of cyclin d1 and rb [ 2,4,6,9,32,33,34,35,61,85,139,140 ] .
this effect can be overcome by silencing of p21 .
additionally , fibroblast - derived overexpression of activin a downregulates vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) expression , one of the key components of tumor angiogenesis [ 133 ] .
previous research has shown that most endothelial cells express actrii / iib and are therefore able to respond to activin a ligand binding [ 9,26,28,42,43,56,85,140 ] .
activin a treatment of endothelial cells results in a dose - dependent inhibition of proliferation .
experiments utilizing chick chorioallantoic membrane demonstrated a complete loss of capillary development and fibrosis when treated with activin a [ 11,13,15,26,45,63,64,86,141 ] .
in our experiments , conditioned media from normal esophageal fibroblasts that overexpress activin a completely inhibits the tube formation of endothelial cells [ 133 ] .
in vivo , breast cancer cells expressing activin a develop larger , though less vascularized , tumors compared to cells expressing follistatin , which form smaller , better vascularized tumors [ 27,49,61,66,87,88,89,142 ] .
due to its potent anti - angiogenic nature , cancer cells have developed mechanisms to counteract activin a activity .
activin a expression in neuroblastoma results in elevated cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( vegfr2 ) [ 45,51,65,89,90,143 ] .
therefore , the oncogene n - myc , which is consistently overexpressed in neuroblastoma , stifles this effect by directly inhibiting transcription of the inhibin betaa subunit and , subsequently , activin a homodimer formation [ 50,51,53,54,67,91,141 ] .
additionally , activin a may be negatively regulated by interleukin - 32 ( il - 32 ) , which promotes proliferation and endothelial cell function during tumor promotion .
this effect is overcome with the silencing of il - 32 , which results in the upregulation of activin a [ 51,52,54,68,92,144 ] .
tgfbeta has been consistently shown to both induce and inhibit angiogenesis .
in contrast to activin a 's function , tgfbeta directly stimulates the pro - angiogenic protein , vascular endothelial growth factor a ( vegf - a ) , via smad3 , while the angiogenesis inhibitor , thrombospondin - 1 ( thbs1 ) , is induced via phosphorylated smad2 [ 45,49,93,94,95,145,146 ] .
these separate signaling pathways suggest differential effects of tgfbeta signaling in cancer development and metastasis .
interestingly , tgfbeta - induced angiogenesis can be blocked through treatment with tgfbeta inhibitors , latent activating protein ( lap ) and bmp , and activin membrane - bound inhibitor ( bambi ) [ 57,96,97,134,147 ] .
it may be suggested that tgfbeta promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation via a vegf - dependent pathway , as it is well established that vegf is a potent driver of tip cell migration [ 59,69,98,148 ] .
however , recent research has shown that cells' tgfbeta has the ability to bind to alk1 and alk5 on the endothelium , which may then dimerize with endoglin to activate smad1 / 5 / 8 , the typical bmp signaling pathway , and inhibit endothelial cell proliferation ; however , these results remain controversial [ 149,150 ] .
5. conclusions and future directions as discussed above , activin a plays pleiotropic roles in basic physiology and pathogenesis .
normal activin a function induces embryonic cell fate , wound healing and inhibits proliferation .
during tumorigenesis , activin a acts as a suppressor of cancer angiogenesis , as a promoter of tumor - associated macrophages and t - cells and exerts mixed effects on epithelial tumor cells , further exemplifying the context - and cell type - dependent effects of activin a signaling .
based on the evidence presented , the overall functional consequences of activin a signaling alone are not sufficient to either suppress or drive cancer progression and , therefore , must work in collaboration with other pathways to dictate a particular phenotype .
this may include working in cooperation with other tgfbeta ligands , such as bmp4 , or synergistically with other pathways , such as mapk / erk [ 37,59,62,71,102,151 ] .
further investigation into the mechanism of activin a signaling and the intertwining of different pathways to promote cancer progression is needed to unravel the complex signaling processes .

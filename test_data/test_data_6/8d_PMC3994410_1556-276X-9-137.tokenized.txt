a novel sulfur / graphene nanosheet ( s / gns ) composite was prepared via a simple ball milling of sulfur with commercial multi - layer graphene nanosheet , followed by a heat treatment .
high - resolution transmission and scanning electronic microscopy observations showed the formation of irregularly interlaced nanosheet - like structure consisting of graphene with uniform sulfur coating on its surface .
the electrochemical properties of the resulting composite cathode were investigated in a lithium cell with a gel polymer electrolyte ( gpe ) prepared by trapping 1 mol dm - 3 solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonamide in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether in a polymer matrix composed of poly ( vinylidene fluoride - co - hexafluoropropylene )/ poly ( methylmethacrylate )/ silicon dioxide ( pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 ) .
the gpe battery delivered reversible discharge capacities of 809 and 413 mah g - 1 at the 1st and 50th cycles at 0.2c , respectively , along with a high coulombic efficiency over 50 cycles .
this performance enhancement of the cell was attributed to the suppression of the polysulfide shuttle effect by a collective effect of s / gns composite cathode and gpe , providing a higher sulfur utilization .
graphene nanosheet lithium / sulfur battery nanostructured sulfur cathode gel polymer electrolyte poly ( vinylidene fluoride - co - hexafluoropropylene )/ poly ( methylmethacrylate )/ silicon dioxide polymer matrix 82.47.aa 82.45.gj 62.23.kn background lithium - ion batteries are leading power sources for portable applications from small consumer electronics to electricity - powered transport .
despite this , their wider application is restricted due to the limited energy density of available cathode materials .
alternative cathode materials with high energy density and low cost are thus needed [ 1 ] .
sulfur is very attractive as a cathode material for the next - generation high - energy rechargeable lithium batteries because of its advantages of a large theoretical capacity of 1,672 mah g - 1 , which is the highest among all known cathode materials , low cost , and environmental friendliness [ 2 - 4 ] .
despite this , due to its insulating nature , large volume changes during electrochemical processes , and the solubility of the polysulfides formed during these processes , the practical application of sulfur as a cathode in lithium rechargeable batteries has not been successful yet [ 5,6 ] .
therefore , intensive efforts have been devoted to overcome the mentioned problems .
the preparation of sulfur / carbon and sulfur / conductive polymer composites has received considerable attention , and recent results show that the sulfur / carbon composites benefit from their hierarchical design resulting in the performance improvement [ 7 - 21 ] .
microporous and mesoporous carbon nanoparticles [ 10,11 ] , carbon nanotubes [ 13 ] , and graphene sheets [ 14 - 16 ] have been employed to encapsulate sulfur .
however , the preparation techniques used to obtain these materials have the disadvantages of side products and prolonged and complicated processing , increasing the final product cost [ 10 ] .
in this work , we report on the preparation of a novel sulfur / graphene nanosheet ( s / gns ) composite via a simple ball milling of sulfur and commercial multi - layer graphene nanosheets , followed by a heat treatment , and investigation of its physical and electrochemical properties as a cathode for li | s batteries .
diffusion of lithium polysulfides is largely determined by the electrolyte components ; adopting an appropriate electrolyte is critical to promote the performance of li | s batteries [ 22 ] .
in previous studies [ 9,10 ] , it was shown that a gel polymer membrane can act as a physical barrier , controlling the cathode reaction product dissolution , restricting their diffusion from the cathode , and thus preventing their reaction at the anode side .
herein , in the present work , to further enhance the battery performance , a common liquid organic electrolyte was replaced with an original gel polymer electrolyte , formed by trapping a liquid electrolyte in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte in a poly ( vinylidene fluoride - co - hexafluoropropylene ) ( pvdf - hfp )/ poly ( methylmethacrylate ) ( pmma ) polymer matrix doped with silicon dioxide ( sio2 ) nanoparticles .
the electrochemical and structural properties of this gpe and the electrochemical performance of li | s / gns batteries with this gpe were also investigated .
methods the preparation of s / gns composite is represented in figure 1a .
sulfur ( high purity , gost 127.1 , tengizchevroil , atyrau , kazakhstan ) and graphene nanosheets ( us research nanomaterials inc. , houston , tx , usa ) were mixed in the weight ratio of 3:1 and wet ball - milled ( pulverisette 7 classic line , fritsch , idar - oberstein , germany ) at 800 rpm for 3 h with ethanol as a dispersant .
the precursor mixture was further dried in a vacuum oven at 60degreesc for 3 h , dry ball - milled at 600 rpm for 6 h , and then heat - treated at 150degreesc for 6 h in a tube furnace in argon .
the sulfur content in the final s / gns composite was 65 wt % as determined by chemical analysis ( chns , vario micro cube , elementar , hanau , germany ) .
figure 1 schematics of the preparation process .
schematic diagrams of the synthesis of ( a ) s / gns composite and ( b ) pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 polymer matrix .
the preparation of the gpe is schematically represented in figure 1b .
among other polymer pore - making technologies , we adopted the phase inversion method to obtain a porous structured system through a solvent exchange route [ 23,24 ] .
the membrane is formed by polymer precipitation , which occurs as a consequence of concentration variations following diffusive interchange between the solvent ( acetone ) and the non - solvent ( water ) .
pvdf - hfp ( kynarflex 2801 , arkema inc. , philadelphia , pa , usa ) , pmma ( average molecular weight 350,000 g mol - 1 , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) , and sio2 nanopowder ( us research nanomaterials , inc. ) were added to acetone in a weight ratio of 3:2:0.25 under stirring followed by sonication .
deionized water was then added dropwise and the mixture was continuously stirred for 3 h. the resulting slurry was cast on an aluminum plate and the solvent was evaporated overnight at ambient temperature .
the resulting membrane was dried under vacuum at 50degreesc for 5 h. the resulting mechanically stable membranes , approximately 80 mum thick , were activated inside an argon - filled glove box ( as one co. , osaka , japan ) by immersion in a 1 mol dm - 3 solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonamide ( litfsi ) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether ( 99.95 % purity , sigma - aldrich ) .
the liquid uptake (%) was determined using the relation ( w2 - w1 ) x 100 / w1 , where w1 and w2 denote the respective weights of the polymer electrolyte before and after absorbing the lithium salt solution [ 25 ] .
the s / gns composite surface morphology was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy ( sem ; jsm - 6490 , jeol , akishima , tokyo , japan ) .
the interior structure of the composite was observed by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ; high voltage libra 120 , carl zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) with energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .
the ionic conductivity of the gpe was determined at 25degreesc by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis ) over the frequency range from 0.1 hz to 1 mhz using potentiostat / galvanostat vmp3 ( biologic , claix , france ) , sandwiching the gpe membranes between two blocking stainless steel electrodes .
the electrochemical stability window of gpe was determined by cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) conducted with vmp3 in coin - type cells where gpe was interleaved between lithium metal and stainless steel electrodes .
the electrochemical performance of the s / gns composite cathode was investigated in coin - type cells ( cr2032 ) with pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 gpe .
the cell was composed of a lithium metal anode and the s / gns composite cathode separated by the gpe film .
the cathode is comprised of 80 wt % s / gns composite , 10 wt % acetylene black ( ab ; 99.5 % purity , mti , richmond , ca , usa ) as a conductive agent , and 10 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ; 99.5 % purity , mti ) as a binder .
these materials were dispersed in 1 - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone ( nmp ; >= 99 % purity , sigma - aldrich ) .
the resultant slurry was spread onto aluminum foil using a doctor blade and dried at 50degreesc for 12 h. the resulting cathode film was used to prepare the cathodes by punching circular disks of 1 cm in diameter .
the coin cells were assembled in high - purity argon ( 99.9995 %) atmosphere .
the cells were tested galvanostatically on multi - channel battery tester ( bt - 2000 , arbin instruments , college station , tx , usa ) between 1 and 3 v vs. li +/ li. the applied currents and specific capacities were calculated on the basis of the weight of s in the cathode .
results and discussion figure 2a,b,c exhibits the sem images of the s / gns composite at different magnifications .
the data of figure 2a,b show that after the high - speed ball milling the composite contains graphene nanosheets remarkably reduced in size compared with the initial graphene used for the composite synthesis ( not shown ) .
at the higher magnification ( figure 2c ) , it can be clearly seen that gns sheets are covered with sulfur , and irregular stacks of interlaced nanosheet - like structure were formed .
the edx mapping ( figure 2d,e,f ) confirms the homogeneous distribution of the components of the s / gns composite .
it could be suggested that the graphene nanosheets may act as nano - current collectors for the sulfur particles and enhance the conductivity of the composite .
on the other hand , the size reduction of graphene and formation of disordered and hollow structure of the composite agglomerates create the pathways for the electrolyte and li - ion transport providing enhanced activity of the composite .
these structural advantages of the composite are favorable for the cathode rate capability , which was further observed in the electrochemical studies .

figure 3a,b presents the sem images of the pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 polymer matrix at different magnifications .
the membrane is highly porous , and the pore diameters range from 1 to 5 mum .
this porous structure grants a high surface area to the membrane and effectively enhances its absorption ability , and the liquid uptake by the membrane was as high as 71 wt % .
the obtained gpe was a self - standing transparent film without visible leakage of liquid electrolyte .
the ionic conductivity of gpes strongly depends on the amount of liquid electrolyte embedded in the pores of a polymer membrane , and it is accepted that the absorbed electrolyte solution acts as a medium for ion transport through the polymer matrix [ 26,27 ] .
a typical eis plot for the pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 composite sandwiched between two stainless steel blocking electrodes is shown in figure 3c .
no semicircles were observed in the high - frequency part of the nyquist plot , implying that the polymer electrolyte has a high integrity and its total conductivity mainly results from the ionic conduction [ 28,29 ] .
the gpe membrane exhibited a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.12 ms cm - 1 .
the cv data of the gpe ( figure 3d ) do not show any breakdown or abrupt current rise during cycling up to 4.5 v vs. li +/ li , confirming that the gpe is electrochemically stable in the operation range of li | s cell between 1 and 3 v vs. li +/ li. figure 3 morphology , ionic conduction , and electrochemical stability of the synthesized gpe .

the electrochemical performance of the li | gpe | s cell with the s / gns composite is presented in figure 4 .
the galvanostatic charge - discharge profiles and cycling performance of the cells are depicted in figure 4a,b. the discharge curves ( figure 4a ) show two plateaus that can be assigned to the two - step reaction of sulfur with lithium [ 9,10 ] .
the first plateau at about 2.4 v is related to the formation of higher - order lithium polysulfides ( li2sn , n >= 4 ) , which are soluble in liquid electrolyte .
the following electrochemical transition of these polysulfides into lithium sulfide li2s2 / li2s is associated to a prolonged plateau around 2.0 v. the kinetics of the latter reaction is slower than that of the polysulfide formation , which is reflected by the length of the plateaus [ 6 ] .
figure 4b presents the cycling performance of the li | gpe | s cell with the s / gns composite cathode .
the cell delivers a high initial discharge capacity of about 809 mah g - 1 at 0.2c rate and exhibits an enhanced cyclability .
this indicates that a combination of the s / gns composite cathode and pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 gpe plays a significant role of retarding diffusion of the polysulfides out of the cathode area and suppressing their transport towards the anode side ( shuttle effect ) .
the coulombic efficiency data presented in the same figure confirm this suggestion and reach 95 % .
for further clarification of the effects of s / gns composite and gpe on the cell performance , its rate capability performance was investigated .
as illustrated in figure 4c , the cell delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 638 mah g - 1 at 0.1c .
although the reversible capacity gradually decreases with the increase in current density , the system still delivers specific discharge capacity of 316 mah g - 1 even at 1c , i.e. , the high - rate operation is affordable by the system due to a good ionic conductivity of the gpe and an enhanced conductivity of the graphene containing sulfur composite cathode .
upon the following reduction of the c - rate to 0.1c , the cell recovers about 85 % of its initial reversible capacity ( 538 mah g - 1 ) .
this suggests that both the homogeneous dispersion of nanoscopic sulfur in the layers covering the highly conductive gns nanosheets , which act as nano - current collectors , provide remarkably enhanced lithium - ion transportation .

conclusions a novel s / gns composite with irregular interlaced nanosheet - like structure and homogeneous distribution of the components was successfully prepared via a simple ball milling of sulfur with commercial multi - layer graphene nanosheets , followed by a heat treatment .
this composite was studied in a lithium cell with an original gel polymer electrolyte , 1 mol dm - 3 of litfsi in pvdf - hfp / pmma / sio2 polymer electrolyte , prepared by phase separation .
the gpe exhibited a pore - rich structure , a high ability to absorb liquid electrolyte exceeding 71 wt % , and a high ionic conductivity at ambient temperature .
the li | gpe | s cells exhibited a high initial specific discharge capacity and maintained a reversible discharge capacity of 413 mah g - 1 after 50 cycles at 0.2c , along with a high coulombic efficiency .
due to a combined positive effect of the nanosheet - like structure of conductive s / gpe composite cathode , retaining the s cathode reaction products - polysulfides , and a highly conductive gpe as a physical barrier for these products' shuttle , the system could deliver reversible capacity of 316 mah g - 1 even at 1c .
the results of this work show that the s / gns composite cathode prepared in this work via a simple preparation technique , in combination with the original gpe , provides a promising way to develop the li | s battery with very attractive overall performances and , due to its simplicity , could be a good choice for the scale - up technology for li / s batteries .

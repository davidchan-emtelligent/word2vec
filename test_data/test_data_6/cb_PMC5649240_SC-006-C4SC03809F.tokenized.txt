a versatile imaging strategy integrated with target - induced dna assembly and cleavage was designed for an assay for multiple proteins .
this work integrates target - induced dna assembly and cleavage on a dna chip to design a versatile imaging strategy as an assay for multiple proteins .
the dna assembly is achieved via immunological recognition to trigger the proximity hybridization for releasing a dna sequence , which then hybridizes with fitc - dna1 immobilized on the chip to induce the enzymatic cleavage of dna1 and thus decrease the signals .
the signal readout is performed with both fluorescent imaging of the left fitc and chemiluminescent ( cl ) imaging , by adding peroxidase labelled anti - fitc in assembly solution and cl substrates to produce cl emission .
this one - step incubation can be completed in 30 min .
the imaging method shows wide detection ranges and detection limits down to pg ml - 1 for the simultaneous detection of 4 protein biomarkers .
this high - throughput strategy with good practicability can be easily extended to other protein analytes , providing a powerful protocol for protein analysis and clinical diagnosis .
introduction simple , high - throughput , sensitive and accurate detection of multiple proteins is critical in protein analysis and clinical diagnosis.1 although a variety of electrochemical,2 - 5 electrochemiluminescent,6,7 colorimetric,8,9 chemiluminescent ( cl ) , 10,11 fluorescent ( fl ) 12 - 15 and surface - enhanced raman scattering16 immunoassay methods have been proposed for the multiplex detection of proteins , most of them are carried out on a spatial - resolved protein array , which is usually prepared by immobilizing different capture antibodies ( ab ) on corresponding sensing sites and requires two sequential incubation steps .
multiplex detection is therefore costly and time - consuming , which greatly limits its utility in protein analysis .
a convenient and fast detection principle for the multiplex analysis of proteins is therefore still urgently required .
recently , many affinity ligand - based proximity assay methods have been designed via target - induced dna assembly for protein detection.17 they use two dna - conjugated affinity ligands to simultaneously recognize the target protein and subsequently induce dna assemblies such as dna ligation,18 hybridization19 - 21 and strand displacement.22 - 24 as a result , the protein analysis can be translated to dna detection , and the sensitivity can be conveniently improved with different dna amplification strategies , including polymerase chain reaction,25,26 rolling circle amplification,27,28 catalytic dna circuit,23 and enzymatic cleavage recycling.29 however , these methods can only be used for the detection of single proteins due to the lack of resolution techniques .
to avoid the drawbacks of protein arrays , this work integrates target - induced dna assembly and cleavage on a dna chip to present a high - throughput imaging strategy for the simultaneous detection of multiple proteins .
the assembly and cleavage processes were achieved using two dna - antibody affinity probes to recognize the target protein , which formed a sandwich immunocomplex and led to the proximity of two dna labels , thus inducing dna displacement and hybridization to trigger the enzymatic cleavage recycling to amplify the decrease in the fl or cl signal .
the assay strategy was performed with both fl imaging and indirect cl imaging by adding peroxidase labelled anti - fitc in the assembly solution to trigger the cl emission of the substrate .
benefiting from the one - step target - induced signal change , the designed imaging strategy shows the advantages of easy operation , short assay time and being high throughput .
the dna chip and assembly led to good practicability and convenient extensibility .
the enzymatic cleavage recycling improved the detection sensitivity .
thus the proposed high - throughput strategy provides an avenue for multiple protein analysis .
the dna chip was prepared by immobilizing dna1 - fitc on different cells of the home - made array , and a dna3 / dna2 duplex was formed for the preparation of an affinity probe ab - dna3 / 2 ( esi +) .
the purity of the obtained affinity probes was identified as acceptable using page and mass spectroscopic analysis ( fig. s1 and s2 +) .
the fl imaging assay ( fia ) was performed by mixing two affinity probes ( ab - dna3 / 2 and ab - dna4 ) , nicking endonuclease ( nt.bbvci ) and target protein on the chip to achieve the target - induced dna assembly and release of dna2 , which then hybridized with dna1 to trigger the enzymatic cleavage recycling ( fig. 1a ) .
the fl signals of fitc left on the chip were recorded using a microarray imaging system. by adding horseradish peroxidase labelled anti - fitc ( hrp - abfitc ) to the reaction mixture and cl substrates on the left chip , the cl imaging assay ( clia ) could be carried out ( fig. 1b ) .
due to the target - induced cleavage of dna1 - fitc , the presence of target protein decreased the amount of fitc or hrp - abfitc captured on the chip , leading to a " signal - off " fia or clia method for multiplex protein detection. fig. 1 general principle of ( a ) fia and ( b ) clia of multiple proteins with a target - induced dna cleavage strategy on a dna chip .
results and discussion characterization of target - induced dna assembly and cleavage the target - induced dna assembly and enzymatic cleavage recycling was firstly verified using dna1 and dna2 - cy5 as the substitutes of dna1 - fitc and dna2 to record the fluorescent signals ( fig. 2a ) .
the absence of target protein showed negligible fl of cy5 ( i and ii ) , indicating that no dna2 was captured by dna1 , and the cleavage of nt.bbvci did not happen .
thus the proximity hybridization between dna3 and dna4 could be excluded .
upon addition of the target protein in mixture ( i ) , a strong fl of cy5 was observed ( iii ) , which could be extinguished by adding nt.bbvci to the mixture ( iv ) , suggesting that the target triggered the proximity hybridization to release dna2 - cy5 , and the released dna2 - cy5 hybridized with dna1 on the chip to further trigger the cleavage of dna1 , which unlinked the dna2 - cy5 from the sensing site .
it was noted that the target protein led to the fl observation of cy5 on the chip .
however , the absence of enzymatic cleavage recycling in the cy5 - based fl detection led to low sensitivity. fig. 2 fluorescent characterization of target - induced dna assembly and the enzymatic cleavage recycling process .

( b ) controls , ab - dna3 / 2 and ab - dna4 on the chip prepared with dna1 - cy3 .
cea : 670 ng ml - 1 .
the cleavage was further examined on a chip prepared with dna1 - cy3 ( fig. 2b ) .
after incubation with nt.bbvci , the chip showed strong fl of cy3 similar to that with blank buffer ( i and ii ) , indicating that nt.bbvci could not cleave the single dna1 strand .
in the absence of target protein , the cleavage also did not happen ( iii ) .
the presence of target protein in the incubation mixture of ab - dna3 / 2 , ab - dna4 and nt.bbvci led to the disappearance of the fl signal ( iv ) , confirming the target - induced fl " signal off " .
the fl of dna1 - cy3 could be maintained in the absence of nt.bbvci ( v ) , indicating that the fl " signal off " depended on the presence of nt.bbvci for enzymatic cleavage recycling , which amplified the fl decrease of cy3 for obtaining high sensitivity .
the target - induced cl " signal off " was confirmed on the dna1 - fitc chip ( fig. 3a ) .
after the immunoreaction of fitc with hrp - abfitc , the hrp was captured on the chip to catalyze the cl reaction of the luminol - p - iodophenol - h2o2 system , thus the chip showed strong cl intensity ( i ) .
a similar spot was observed after the chip was incubated with the mixture of ab - dna3 / 2 , ab - dna4 , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc ( ii ) .
thus the cleavage did not happen in the absence of target protein .
the cl intensity was the same as both ( i ) and ( ii ) in the absence of ab - dna4 , even when the mixture contained target protein ( iii ) .
the addition of target protein to mixture ( ii ) led to an obvious cl " signal off " ( iv ) , suggesting that the cleavage of dna1 - fitc decreased the amount of capture hrp - abfitc .
the cleavage could not be triggered without the presence of proximity hybridization products ( v ). fig. 3 ( a ) cl imaging of the dna1 - fitc chip incubated with ( i ) hrp - abfitc , and ( ii - v ) mixtures of ( ii ) ab - dna3 / 2 , ab - dna4 , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc , ( iii ) ab - dna3 / 2 , cea , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc , ( iv ) ab - dna3 / 2 , ab - dna4 , cea , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc and ( v ) nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc .

( c ) optimization of the complementary base number between dna3 and dna4 .
( d ) optimization of incubation time for clia .
cea : 670 ng ml - 1 .
kinetic of cl reaction kinetic behavior of the cl reaction catalyzed by the captured hrp on the chip was studied using a static method .
upon addition of the cl substrates , cl emission occurred immediately and slightly increased during the first 30 min and then decreased quickly due to the consumption of the cl substrates ( fig. 4 ) , indicating the feasibility for ccd imaging .
considering the detection sensitivity , a total exposure time of 3 min was used to collect the cl images , at which time the cl " signal off " was used to optimize the detection conditions. fig. 4 kinetic curve of the luminol - p - iodophenol - h2o2 cl reaction catalyzed by hrp - abfitc captured on the dna chip .
optimization of assay conditions the complementary bases between dna1 - fitc and dna2 were chosen to be 11 , which ensured successful enzymatic cleavage recycling .
as shown in fig. 3b , the low concentration of dna1 - fitc could not offer sufficient fitc to capture hrp - abfitc , and sufficient dna1 to capture dna2 released in proximity hybridization , while a high dna1 - fitc concentration caused a high density of dna1 - fitc on the chip , which affected the capture of dna2 and the following cleavage efficiency .
both of them led to low " signal off " and detection sensitivity , thus 5.0 nm of dna1 - fitc was used for the preparation of the dna chip .
the dna3 / dna2 duplex contained 13 complementary bases .
the melting temperature between dna3 and dna2 was estimated to be 51.4 degreesc , which indicates that the dna3 / dna2 was very stable and could not be affected by dna1 - fitc on the array under the experimental conditions .
to efficiently displace dna2 from the duplex through the target - induced proximity hybridization between dna3 and dna4 , the number of their complementary bases was optimized ( fig. 3c ) .
at a low number of complementary bases , dna4 could not hybridize with dna3 to displace dna2 even with the help of the proximate effect , thus the subsequent enzymatic cleavage hardly happened and the strong cl signal did not change .
however , when the complementary number was higher than 10 bases , the hybridization between dna3 and dna4 could happen in the absence of the proximity effect , which also led to the release of dna2 to trigger the cleavage of dna1 and " signal off " .
at 10 complementary bases ( 10 - bp ) , the cl " signal off " reached the maximum value , and was therefore chosen as the complimentary number for this work .
both the fia and clia performances depended on the time for proximity hybridization and enzymatic cleavage processes .
the cl intensity decreased with increasing incubation time ( fig. 3d ) .
the relative cl intensity reached the minimum value at 30 min , and then trended toward a stable value , indicating that the target - induced assembly and enzymatic cleavage could be completed within 30 min .
this result was the same as that in fia ( fig. 5 ) .
thus 30 min was selected as the incubation time for this whole work. fig. 5 fluorescent imaging and relative percentage of the fluorescent intensity of fitc on the dna chip incubated with the mixture of ab - dna3 / 2 , ab - dna4 , 670 ng ml - 1 target cea , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc for different times .
imaging assay of multiple proteins the practicability of the designed fia or clia strategy was demonstrated using alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) , carcinoma antigen 125 ( ca 125 ) , carcinoma antigen 199 ( ca 199 ) and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) for the simultaneous detection of multiple protein biomarkers. by incubating the dna chip with the mixtures containing affinity probe pairs , corresponding proteins and nt.bbvci in different cells , the fl images were simultaneously collected for the different concentrations of target proteins .
the fl brightness of the spot was inversely proportional to the logarithm value of analyte concentration over the ranges of 0.033 - 330 ng ml - 1 for afp , 0.017 - 170 u ml - 1 for ca 125 , 0.017 - 170 u ml - 1 for ca 199 , and 0.067 - 670 ng ml - 1 for cea ( fig. 6a and b ) .
the limits of detection corresponding to the fl signals of 3sd were 0.029 ng ml - 1 for afp , 0.016 u ml - 1 for ca 125 , 0.011 u ml - 1 for ca 199 , and 0.060 ng ml - 1 for cea .
when the mixtures contained additional hrp - abfitc , the clia with cl substrates showed limits of detection of 0.022 ng ml - 1 for afp , 0.012 u ml - 1 for ca 125 , 0.010 u ml - 1 for ca 199 and 0.048 ng ml - 1 for cea , along with the detectable concentration ranges as those in the fia ( fig. 6c and d ) .
although clia required additional reagents and an operation step , it benefited from not requiring external optical equipment , which would result in interference of scattered light caused by incident light and thus possesses weaker background and higher sensitivity than fia .
as a result , the limits of detection obtained using clia for the four proteins were a little lower than those obtained using the fia strategy .
the pg ml - 1 - level detection limits were lower than those of other immunoassays using different amplification strategies,30 - 33 and were comparable to the assays based on proximity effect34,35 and binding - induced dna strand displacement strategies.23,24 fig. 6 ( a and b ) fl and ( c and d ) cl images and calibration curves for the detection of 4 protein biomarkers .
protein concentrations from c1 to c5 are 0.033 , 0.33 , 3.3 , 33 and 330 ng ml - 1 for afp , 0.017 , 0.17 , 1.7 , 17 and 170 u ml - 1 for ca 125 and ca 199 , and 0.067 , 0.67 , 6.7 , 67 and 670 ng ml - 1 for cea .
evaluation of cross - reactivity and clinical application in the proposed assay , the cross - reactivity and nonspecific binding among the analytes and nonspecific antibodies were demonstrated to be negligible ( fig. 7 ) .
to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed detection strategy , the levels of four cancer biomarkers in 5 human serum samples from cancer patients were tested using the designed clia , and compared with the reference values obtained by commercial electrochemiluminescent single - analyte testing .
due to the wide detectable ranges and good specificity , the serum samples were detected without any dilution treatment .
the results with relative errors less than 8.7 % for the detection of all the four biomarkers ( table 1 ) were acceptable. fig. 7 cl imaging and cl intensity on the dna chip incubated with mixtures of ( 1 ) cea ab - dna3 / 2 , cea ab - dna4 , nt.bbvci and hrp - abfitc , ( 2 ) ( 1 ) + 170 u ml - 1 ca 125 + 170 u ml - 1 ca 199 + 330 ng ml - 1 afp , ( 3 ) ( 1 ) + 670 ng ml - 1 cea , ( 4 ) ( 1 ) + 670 ng ml - 1 cea + 170 u ml - 1 ca 125 + 170 u ml - 1 ca 199 + 330 ng ml - 1 afp .

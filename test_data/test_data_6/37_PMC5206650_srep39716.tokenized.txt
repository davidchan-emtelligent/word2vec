mg is a chronic , autoimmune neuromuscular disease with antibodies most commonly targeting the acetylcholine receptors ( achrab ) , which causes fluctuating skeletal muscle fatigue .
mg pathophysiology includes a strong component of inflammation , and a large proportion of patients with early onset mg additionally present thymus hyperplasia .
due to the fluctuating nature and heterogeneity of the disease , there is a great need for objective biomarkers as well as novel potential inflammatory targets .
we examined the sera of 45 mg patients ( 40 achrab seropositive and 5 achrab seronegative ) , investigating 92 proteins associated with inflammation .
eleven of the analysed proteins were significantly elevated compared to healthy controls , out of which the three most significant were : matrix metalloproteinase 10 ( mmp - 10 ; p = 0.0004 ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf - alpha ; p = 0.0017 ) and extracellular newly identified receptor for advanced glycation end - products binding protein ( en - rage ) ( also known as protein s100 - a12 ; p = 0.0054 ) .
further , levels of mmp - 10 , c - x - c motif ligand 1 ( cxcl1 ) and brain derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) differed between early and late onset mg. these novel targets provide valuable additional insight into the systemic inflammatory response in mg. myasthenia gravis ( mg ) is a chronic autoimmune disease , which is caused by antibodies against receptors at the neuromuscular junction .
disruption of neuromuscular transmission results in symptoms of fatigue in proximal skeletal muscles ; predominantly facial , bulbar and limb muscles12 .
in approximately 85 % of the patients , igg1 antibodies are directed towards the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( achr +) 3 , while a smaller portion of mg patients possess igg4 antibodies towards muscle specific tyrosine kinase ( musk +) 4 or low density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 4 ( lrp4 ) 5 .
patients who do not have detectable serum antibodies are termed seronegative .
the antibody subtype is important to consider , since both symptoms and treatment response substantially differ between the different serological mg subgroups6 .
mg can be further subdivided into early onset ( eomg ) or late onset ( lomg ) , depending on the age at which the patient first develops myasthenic symptoms .
although there is no absolute consensus at which age to draw the line between eomg and lomg7 , the most commonly applied cut - off point for lomg is 50 years of age .
the distinction between eomg and lomg is important , since patients with lomg may have a different disease course and typically do not present thymic hyperplasia , which is frequently seen in eomg8 .
as of yet , there are no circulating serum biomarkers that correlate with the disease state between patients or different mg subtypes9 .
the levels of achr or musk antibodies generally do not correlate well with mg disease severity , neither between patients or inter - individually .
furthermore , clinical muscle fatigue may not be an entirely reliable parameter to follow in clinical trials due to expected fluctuations from one day to another , and even during the course of one day .
recently , microrna ( mirna ) have been described as potential biomarkers regarding mir - 150 - 5p and mir - 21 - 5p for achr + mg1011 and the let7 family for musk + patients12 .
both mir - 150 - 5p and mir - 21 - 5p are involved in the regulation of the autoimmune response , and in particular the development of t - and b - cells .
one recent study on inflammatory proteins in mg revealed significantly increased serum levels of a proliferation - inducing ligand ( april ) , and cytokines il - 19 , il - 20 , il - 28a and il - 35 in mg as compared with controls13 .
otherwise , no previous study has focused on defining a broad inflammatory circulating protein profile in mg patients and in different clinical mg subtypes .
due to the lack of knowledge regarding the inflammatory circulating protein profile in mg , we analysed 92 different proteins associated with inflammation .
further , we analysed protein expressions within the clinical subgroups eomg vs. lomg , immunosuppressive medication , gender and thymectomy .
materials and methods subjects sera from 45 mg patients ( 24 women ) were collected at the neurology clinics of jonkoping county hospital and uppsala university hospital , sweden .
sera from healthy controls ( hc ) , matched for age and sex , were collected at uppsala university hospital transfusion unit , sweden .
diagnostic criteria of mg included objective muscle fatigue and neurophysiological evidence of disturbed neuromuscular transmission ( decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation and / or increased jitter on single fibre electromyography ) , further supported by detection of achr antibodies14 .
clinical classification of mg status according to the myasthenia gravis foundation of america ( mgfa ) 15 included only ocular weakness ( mgfa class i ) and generalized weakness of mild ( mgfa class ii ) , moderate ( mgfa class iii ) or severe ( mgfa class iv ) degree predominantly affecting limb or axial muscles ( subtype a ) or bulbar muscles ( subtype b ) .
additionally , the degree of clinical mg fatigue was assessed at the time for serum sampling with the mg composite scale ( mgc ; range 0 - 50 ) 16 all subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study .
ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee of the ryhov county hospital , jonkoping ( dnr 2014 / 459 - 31 ) and uppsala university hospital , uppsala ( dnr 2010 / 446 ) , sweden and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations .
protein analysis the serum samples were analysed using the olink proseek multiplex inflammation i 96x96 kit ( olink bioscience , uppsala , sweden ) , which analyses 92 human proteins related to inflammation and various inflammatory diseases ( http :// www.olink.com / proseek - multiplex / inflammation /) .
the analysis was performed at the clinical biomarkers facility ( science for life laboratory , uppsala , sweden ) .
the proseek multiplex analysis utilizes the proximity extension assay ( pea ) technology , as previously described1718 .
in brief , antibodies labelled with oligonucleotide probes , bind in pairs to their specific target protein .
these antibody pairs are linked to each other via their unique dna oligonucleotide sequences , which hybridize when in proximity .
the dna sequences are then extended and amplified by quantitative real - time pcr .
details about data validation , limit of detection ( lod ) , specificity and reproducibility can be obtained via olink 's website ( http :// www.olink.com / data - you - can - trust / validation /) .
calibrator curves for correlating the normalized protein expression ( npx ) values with actual concentrations are available at olink 's website ( http :// www.olink.com / proseek - multiplex / inflammation / biomarkers /) .
a fold change value of at least 0.5 npx is considered a biological difference , and not technical variation .
statistical analysis the data was log base 2 transformed for the analysis in order to obtain data more similar to a normal distribution .
73 out of the 92 proteins followed a normal distribution , and for these proteins , an unpaired welch t - test was performed for comparison of the two groups ( mg versus hc ) .
for comparison of the proteins that were not normally distributed , a mann - whitney u test was performed .
the false discovery rate method was applied to manage multiple test errors .
to investigate whether gender had any effect on the protein expression , a two - way anova analysis was performed .
the mg patients were divided into three sub - groups , depending on ( 1 ) early onset (< 50 years of age ) versus late onset (>= 50 years or age ) mg ; ( 2 ) thymectomy versus no thymectomy and ; ( 3 ) current treatment with immunosuppressant medication versus no immunosuppressive therapy .
an unpaired two - tailed welch t - test was performed to test different subgroup analysis of protein expression .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered significant .
a non - parametric dynamic principal component analysis ( pca ) was performed to identify possible clusters of the proteins that differed the most between mg and hc. results clinical characteristics of mg patients three samples ( 2 hc and 1 patient ) were excluded due to unacceptable technical variations and thus , the final cohort consisted of 87 subjects , 44 mg patients ( 23 women ) and 43 healthy controls ( 23 women ) .
in the mg patient cohort , mean age was 63 +/ - 17 years ( range 27 - 87 years ) and mean disease duration was 14 +/ - 12 years ( range 1 - 48 years ) .
the cohort included 22 eomg and 22 lomg patients and overall median mgfa disease severity classification was mild mg ( mgfa class ii ; table 1 ) .
39 patients had verified achr antibodies whereas the remaining 5 patients were seronegative for achr and musk antibodies .
18 patients had undergone thymectomy and 16 patients had current treatment with immunosuppressive medication .
the mean mgc score was 7.0 +/ - 7.1 ( range 0 - 34 ) ( table 1 ) .
elevated protein expressions in mg patients the results from the assay are presented as normalized protein expression units ( npx ) , which are considered arbitrary units for each individual protein .
out of 92 assayed inflammatory proteins , 11 proteins were significantly elevated in the mg cohort ( table 2 ) .
the three proteins that were most significantly separated between mg patients and hc were matrix metalloproteinase 10 ( mmp - 10 ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf - alpha ) and extracellular newly identified receptor for advanced glycation end - products binding protein ( en - rage ) , all p < 0.01 .
the area under the curve ( auc ) for these three inflammatory proteins was 0.76 for mmp - 10 ( fig. 1a ) , 0.63 for tgf - alpha ( fig. 1b ) and 0.66 for en - rage ( fig. 1c ) .
thus , mmp - 10 had the strongest association with mg. the pca plot indicated tendency towards clustering in the hc group , although no absolute separation was present due to a greater dispersion in the mg patient group ( fig. 2 ) .
other significantly increased levels of inflammatory proteins included nerve growth factor beta ( beta - ngf ) , cytokines il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 and il - 17a and c as well as chemokines c - c motif ligand 19 ( ccl19 ) and c - x - c motif ligand 1 ( cxcl1 ; table 2 ) .
none of the investigated proteins had a lower expression in the mg group compared to hc group .
further , no significant correlation was found between any of the elevated proteins and clinical mgc score ( supplementary table s1 ) .
proteins associated with clinical mg subgroups in the subgroup two - way anova analysis , none of the proteins were expressed differently in female compared to male mg patients .
patients in the eomg subgroup had significantly higher levels of mmp - 10 ( p = 0.0092 ; fig. 3 ) as well as cxcl1 ( p = 0.033 ; fig. 3 ) compared to the lomg group .
brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , although not significantly separated in the mg group as a whole , was markedly elevated in lomg compared to eomg patients ( p = 0.0318 ; fig. 3 ) .
no proteins were clearly separated in the subgroups of immunosuppressive medication or previous thymectomy .
although not significant , some other proteins were separated with at least 0.5 npx difference between group means ( table 3 ) .
discussion in this study , we found that 11 of the 92 different inflammatory proteins were elevated in the sera of mg patients .
the fact that the dispersion of inflammatory proteins was greater in the mg group than the control group was largely expected , due to the heterogeneous nature of mg , with several subgroups and different clinical presentations .
the protein that was most strongly associated with mg was mmp - 10 , also known as stromelysin - 2 , which is a member of the metalloproteinase family .
metalloproteinases enzymatically break down the extracellular matrix , resulting in degradation of collagens , fibronectin and gelatines , both in physiological and disease processes .
one previous study linked elevated serum levels of mmp - 10 to sepsis in human patients19 .
another study found that levels of mmp - 10 , secreted by microglia and macrophages , were considerably elevated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) , which is an animal model for multiple sclerosis , and that these levels correlated with the severity of symptoms20 .
the model of eae has many similarities to the animal model of experimental autoimmune mg ( eamg ) , for example in its response to immunomodulators21 .
tgf - alpha is a growth factor that has important roles for epithelial proliferation and differentiation , mediated through its receptor the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) .
tgf - alpha is mainly produced in macrophages , neurons , astrocytes and keratinocytes .
stimulation of proliferation via the egfr signalling pathway results in inhibition of apoptosis and angiogenesis .
further , tgf - alpha has neurotrophic characteristics , such as stimulating proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells in the developing brain , and is able to stimulate proliferation in rat brain after stroke22 .
tgf - alpha also reduces the infarct size following stroke in mice , and stimulates angiogenesis and neurogenesis23 .
although this neurotrophic role of tgf - alpha is known in the brain , nothing is so far known of its role in the peripheral nervous system .
en - rage , also known as protein s100 - a12 , is a protein that binds to calcium , zinc and copper .
just like mmp - 10 and tgf - alpha , en - rage is involved in the cell cycle progression and differentiation and intriguingly this protein actually inhibits metalloproteinases .
additionally , en - rage possesses pro - inflammatory properties , and is involved in inflammation by activating mast cells and monocytes .
further , en - rage is induced by tnf - alpha in neutrophils and is upregulated by il - 6 in macrophages24 .
previous studies proved that il - 6 is upregulated in thymic epithelial cells in mg patients25 and impaired expression of il - 6 among other cytokines is believed to play a role in the inflammatory response in mg26 .
en - rage is a ligand for the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( rage ) , a well - known pro - inflammatory receptor that is involved in diabetic neuropathy , cardiovascular disorders and neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders2728 .
binding of en - rage to rage activates the transcription factor nf - kappab , induces secretion of cytokines and has pro - inflammatory effects on lymphocytes , neutrophils and endothelial cells29 .
beta - ngf is another well - known protein , which belongs to the neurotrophin family .
it is important for the survival and development of neurons in both the central nervous system ( cns ) and the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) .
however , it also has a role in the inflammatory response due to its release by t - and b - cells , mast cells , eosinophils and macrophages .
beta - ngf participates in a complex network of inflammation , being upregulated by inflammatory cytokines , activating inflammatory cells and stimulating further cytokine release as well as chemotaxis30 .
interleukins are well - known regulators of the inflammatory response in autoimmune diseases .
both il - 6 and il - 10 are produced by activated b cells ( as well as t - cells ) , and affects macrophages as well as immunoregulatory t - cells3132 and b - cells .
il - 6 is particularly important for the development of the autoimmune response in eamg33 , by stimulating the development of th17 cells .
th17 cells in turn secrete the cytokine il - 17a32 , and a recent study found that plasma levels of il - 17a were increased in mg patients and that higher levels of il - 17a correlated with greater severity of the disease34 .
furthermore , another study presented evidence that serum levels of il - 17 correlates with the achr antibody titre35 .
il - 17c , another member of the il - 17 family , has not previously been linked to mg. nevertheless , il - 17c is important in the development of eae , and in regulating the autoimmune response through its receptor , il - 17e , which is highly expressed in th17 cells36 .
our data support the previous report on upregulation of the pro - inflammatory cytokine il - 8 in the sera of mg patients37 .
il - 8 is known to attract neutrophils and t - cells and has been linked to the occurrence of thymoma in mg patients38 .
in line with previous studies , our findings further validate the importance of these inflammatory cytokines in mg and emphasize the possibility that they could serve as targets for more specific novel mg treatments .
ccl19 is a cytokine that is secreted by medullary thymic epithelial cells and promotes migration of t - cells towards the medullary zone , as well as exporting mature thymocytes towards the periphery .
ccl19 , along with chemokine ccl21 , is known to be upregulated in the thymus of mg patients with thymic hyperplasia39 .
even though ccl21 was not included in our assay , our data support previous findings of the important role of ccl19 also in the circulation of mg patients .
another chemokine that was upregulated in the sera of mg patients is cxcl1 , which stimulates chemotaxis of neutrophils and is produced by several cells in the immune system , such as macrophages and neutrophils4041 .
intriguingly , cxcl1 and il - 8 share the same receptor , cxcr2 , which is present on mast cells , neutrophils , basophils and t - cells42 .
cxcr2 knockout mice present with defect neutrophil recruitment in wounds and delayed healing of wounds43 .
the fact that two ligands for cxcr2 are both elevated in the sera of mg patients reinforces the possibility that cxcr2 plays a crucial part in the autoimmune response in mg patients .
in the sub - group comparing onset of mg , patients with lomg had almost four times higher levels of bdnf than the patients with eomg .
the ratio was almost the same when comparing patients who underwent thymectomy with those who did not .
this was expected , since patients with lomg are rarely treated with thymectomy unless they have a thymoma .
hence , the reason for the different bdnf levels is most likely due to the thymus differences between eomg and lomg , rather than effects from the thymectomy .
since bdnf is a neurotrophic protein , it is essential for differentiation and growth of neurons both in the cns and the pns .
notably , pro - inflammatory cytokines actually cause a reduction of bdnf gene expression44 .
one possible explanation for the higher levels of bdnf in patients with lomg could be that their disease is less driven by inflammation compared to eomg .
the fact that eomg patients more often have thymus hyperplasia and more effect of thymectomy is in conjunction with this finding .
however , apart from neurons , inflammatory cells also produce bdnf , which may serve a neuroprotective role during inflammation45 .
furthermore , bdnf also plays an important role in late - phase long - term potentiation and long - term memory storage4647 .
previous studies indicate that a fraction of mg patients do suffer spatial , logical and visual memory deficits , probably due to impaired cholinergic signaling in the cns , since achr antibodies are also found in the cerebrospinal fluid48 .
impaired expression of bdnf could also be a possible reason for the cognitive deficits in some mg patients49 .
since the results from this protein panel are expressed in arbitrary units , the protein levels cannot be compared to other proteins , or even to the same protein in another assay due to usage of different batches of antibodies .
this may be considered a drawback of the method , and thus limits the potential of this particular protein assay in its role to identify possible biomarkers for treatment response or inflammatory activity .
the fact that many patients had current treatment with immunosuppressive treatment could also lower the levels of certain circulatory inflammatory proteins .
nevertheless , these findings provide valuable insight into the role of inflammatory mechanisms in mg pathophysiology .
in summary , we found eleven elevated inflammatory proteins in the sera of mg patients .
these proteins , out of which mmp - 10 , tgf - alpha and en - rage were the most significant , all have possible functions as new biomarkers of inflammatory activity , and possibly treatment response in mg. additional information how to cite this article : molin , c. j. et al. profile of upregulated inflammatory proteins in sera of myasthenia gravis patients. sci. rep .

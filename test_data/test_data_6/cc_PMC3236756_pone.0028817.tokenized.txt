background brain network studies using techniques of intrinsic connectivity network based on fmri time series ( ts - icn ) and structural covariance network ( scn ) have mapped out functional and structural organization of human brain at respective time scales .
however , there lacks a meso - time - scale network to bridge the icn and scn and get insights of brain functional organization .
methodology and principal findings we proposed a functional covariance network ( fcn ) method by measuring the covariance of amplitude of low - frequency fluctuations ( alff ) in bold signals across subjects , and compared the patterns of alff - fcns with the ts - icns and scns by mapping the brain networks of default network , task - positive network and sensory networks .
we demonstrated large overlap among fcns , icns and scns and modular nature in fcns and icns by using conjunctional analysis .
most interestingly , fcn analysis showed a network dichotomy consisting of anti - correlated high - level cognitive system and low - level perceptive system , which is a novel finding different from the icn dichotomy consisting of the default - mode network and the task - positive network .
conclusion the current study proposed an alff - fcn approach to measure the interregional correlation of brain activity responding to short periods of state , and revealed novel organization patterns of resting - state brain activity from an intermediate time scale .
introduction interest in investigating spontaneous low - frequency fluctuations in resting - state brain activity is steadily growing ( see [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] for systematic reviews ) .
it is postulated that this intrinsic activity reflects the brain 's " dark energy " consumption at rest [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , and is closely relevant to the perceptive or cognitive processes by sharing similar functional topography with specific task - induced brain activity .
the intrinsic activity is known to consists of various large - scale intrinsic connectivity networks ( icns ) [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , observed by resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fmri ) [ 1 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ]. by measuring low - frequency (< 0.1 hz ) fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent ( bold ) signal , rs - fmri has proven to be a powerful tool for exploring brain function and its clinical implications [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] .
the most widely used technique for depicting icns is to calculate the temporal correlation of the bold time series between two brain regions ( i.e. , ts - icn ) .
moreover , another common technique , independent component analysis , has mapped the resting - state networks through a data - driven analysis manner , repeats the topographic properties of these icns [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
studies of ts - icn have unraveled the organization patterns of resting - state brain activity [ 2 ] , [ 11 ] .
on a local scale , the resting - state brain can be hierarchically partitioned into several network modules [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ]. from view of global scale , the brain consists of two competitive brain network systems : the default - mode network ( dmn ) and the task - positive network ( tpn ) [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] .
such a functional dichotomy has been demonstrated high reliability across participants and imaging centers in the 1000 functional connectomes project [ 15 ] .
moreover , the subsequent studies have also investigated the relationships among the dmn , tpn and the primary sensory networks [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
it has been reached a consensus that the dmn may coordinate activity in the other brain networks [ 3 ] .
following the ts - icn approach , a few studies have also demonstrated inter - regional relationship characterized by structural covariances across subjects .
mechelli et al .
[ 18 ] observed that brain regions covary in gray matter volume across subjects , suggesting a structural covariance network ( scn ) .
the association between scns and age was reported in subsequent studies [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
moreover , using cortical thickness and graph theoretic analysis , he et al .
[ 22 ] revealed the large - scale whole brain scn exhibiting the ' small - world ' phenomena .
scns have been interpreted as inter - regionally coordinated structural variances reflecting long - duration effects of brain development or plasticity [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
interestingly , noting the similarity of spatial pattern and developmental effect between icns and scns , recent studies have suggested that scns reflect shared long - term trophic influences within functionally synchronous systems ( i.e. , the icns ) [ 19 ] .
however , caution is needed when concluding such relationships between icns and scns , since these are not characterized by the same - level covariance .
specifically , icn is calculated as the temporal or across - time covariance in function ( i.e. , bold signal ) between regions , whereas scn reflects across - subject covariance in cross - sectional structure ( i.e. , morphological data ) .
currently , there exists no physiological mechanism connecting icn and scn analyses .
accordingly , in this work we describe networks revealed by the across - subject covariance in function ( i.e. , functional covariance network , fcn ) based on bold - fmri data , and propose these fcns as a means to bridge the gap between icn and scn .
individual measures of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ( alff ) in resting - state brain activity can serve as a functional measure to compute fcns .
alff has been proven to be a reliable index of local intrinsic brain activity [ 6 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , which is defined as the total power within a low - frequency range ( e.g. , 0.01 - 0.1 hz ) of rs - fmri signals .
alff and pet measures , which quantifies resting brain 's metabolism during a short period of time [ 26 ] , exhibit highly consistent spatial patterns [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
alff is capable of interrogating both normal [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] and abnormal brain function [ 23 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
most recently , individual variability ( i.e. , across - subject covariance ) in alff has been linked to those in neural activation and behavior [ 30 ] , suggesting it may be well suited for fcn analysis .
in the present study , we examined fcns by calculating inter - regional correlation of alff across 310 subjects ( i.e. , alff - fcn ) to map the brain network organization patterns corresponding to the dmn , the tpn and the sensory network [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] .
we chose three sets of ' seed ' region of interests ( rois ) for alff - fcn analyses : ( 1 ) dmn seeds including posterior cingulate cortex ( pcc ) , dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ( dmpfc ) and left angular gyrus ( lag ) [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] ; ( 2 ) tpn seeds including right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ( rdlpfc ) , left intraparietal lobular ( lipl ) and left frontal eye field ( lfef ) [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ; ( 3 ) sensory network seeds including left primary sensory cortex ( lsc ) , left primary visual cortex ( lvc ) and left auditory cortex ( lac ) [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
we aim to : 1 ) reshape the brain network organization patterns using alff - fcn means building on the findings of icns ; 2 ) examine the consistency and variability of spatial patterns across voxel - based morphometry scn ( vbm - scn ) , ts - icn and alff - fcn ; 3 ) gain more understanding of the nature of human brain network organization from views of local and global scales .
results parallel observations of the fcns , icns and scns all alff - fcns , ts - icns and vbm - scns showed widespread network pattern with significantly positive correlation .
the results of ts - icns and vbm - scns were both consistent with the previous studies [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 19 ] .
as shown in figure 1 , networks from each roi presented autocorrelation and contralateral homotopic regions , and largely overlapped across the three network approaches .
the alff - fcns and ts - icns had wider lateral distributions than vbm - scns .
both alff - fcn and ts - icn , but not the vbm - scn , yielded significantly negative correlated ( i.e. , anti - correlated ) networks .

networks from each roi presented autocorrelation and contralateral homotopic regions , and largely overlapped across the three network approaches .
the alff - fcns and ts - icns had wider lateral distributions than vbm - scns .
both the alff - fcn and ts - icn measures , but not the vbm - scn measure , yielded significantly negative correlation networks ( cold color ) .
hierarchical organization of brain networks figure 2 shows the results of the hierarchical clustering of the spatial correlation maps of nine roi - based network maps for three network analyses approaches .
at an arbitrary threshold of clustering distance = 0.4 , we can find that in the root of the dendrogram of alff - fcns , there are two partitions ( dmn integrating with tpn , and sn ) .
while in the root of the dendrogram of the icn - based network , we observed three partition systems including the dmn , tpn and sn , separately .
however , there are no obvious partition systems observed in the scn - based network .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0028817.g002 figure 2 hierarchical clustering analysis of alff - fcns , ts - icns and vbm - scns .
hierarchical clustering analysis was based on the spatial correlation maps of nine roi - based network maps for three network analyses approaches .
as shown in root of the dendrogram of alff - fcns , there are two partition systems ( dmn combining tpn and sn ) .
while at the root of the dendrogram of the icn - based network , we observed three partition systems including the dmn , tpn and sn , separately .
there are no obvious partition systems observed in the scn - based network .
modular and system patterns of brain networks clustering analysis and intra - roi set conjunction analyses revealed the network modularity in the ts - icns and alff - fcns .
firstly , the positive network in one roi set showed similar spatial pattern ( figure 2 ) , conjunction analyses showed widely spatial overlap in each network roi set ( figure 3 ) .
in addition , a notable finding was the different patterns of the dmn and tpn modules between ts - icns and alff - fcns .
in line with the previous studies , in ts - icns , the dmn module was opposite to the tpn module with anti - correlations [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] .
alff - fcns include the two main modules including dmn / tpn module and anti - correlated sn module .
hence , at the cutoff of 0.4 , clustering analysis revealed three network systems in ts - icns , but two network systems in alff - fcns .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0028817.g003 figure 3 network patterns of alff - fcns and ts - icns at modular level .
intra - roi set conjunction analyses revealed modularity in ts - icns and alff - fcns .
the inter - roi set conjunction analyses of alff - fcns further revealed a network dichotomy with anti - correlation ( figure 4 and table 1 ) .
the regions showing negative correlation in the dmn and tpn modules were those showing positive correlation in the sn module .
hence , the brain could be divided into a high - level cognitive network system covering the dmn and tpn regions , and a low - level network system covering sensory regions .
moreover , significantly negative correlation ( r = - 0.822 , p = 3.697x10 - 17 ) , but no difference ( t = 0.605 , p = 0.545 ) was found between the mean alff values within the two network dichotomies ( high - level cognitive areas : 1.109 +/ - 0.125 ; the lower - order cognitive system : 1.114 +/ - 0.194 ) ( figure 4 ) .

inter - roi set analysis of alff - fcns revealed a network dichotomy , which consisting of a high - level cognitive network system covering the dmn and tpn regions , and a low - level cognitive network system covering sensory regions the alff values within the high - level cognitive system ( warm color ) negatively correlated with those of the low - level cognitive ( perceptive ) system ( cold color ) ( r = - 0.822 , p = 3.697x10 - 17 ) .

discussion based on a large sample of resting - state fmri datasets , the present study mapped neuro - anatomic patterns of functional covariance networks of different brain systems by correlation analysis of alff across subjects ( alff - fcns ) , which supplied a novel way to analyze resting - state fmri data. by comparing with the ts - icn and vbm - scn approaches , the alff - fcns showed specific pattern of network organization in human brain , indicating they are physiological and metabolic in nature .
the results extend our insight into the human brain network organization .
fcns as the bridge between icns and scns current brain network approaches mostly rely on two correlation techniques [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
the first is intervoxel time - series correlation in individual data , such as applied in the functional connectivity measurements of eeg / meg and the majority of fmri studies , as well the time - series icn measurement in the current study .
the second means is interregional correlation of a given imaging index across subjects , such as the network mapping in pet [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , spect [ 41 ] , scns [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 42 ] and alff - fcns measurements .
commonly , these cross - sectional data were required to be collected from a large - amount of homogenous subjects [ 39 ] ( i.e. , perhaps in an ideal limit , consisting of multiple sessions from a single subject ) .
time - scale difference might be the foremost assumption for understanding the network properties between these two correlational approaches , although the evidences are far from enough in the current work .
the time - series correlation measures the instantaneous variability of brain activities , while the correlation across subjects may be driven by long - duration effects of brain activities [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
ts - icn measures coherent bold variations ( low - frequency bold fluctuations : 0.01 ~ 0.08 hz ) over very short time scales ( corresponding periods : 100 s ~ 12.5 s ) through a high sampling rate ( 0.5 ~ 3 s for typical repetition time of fmri data acquisitions ) , resulting from instantaneously neural activities in individual [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] .
while scn measures the variances of cortical structures concerning brain development or plastic , since gray matter structures are framed by longer - duration ( years ) effects of gene and circumstance [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , which might reflect the brain organization at largest time scales ( years ) .
because alff measures the total level of neural activity during a short period of time ( 5 ~ 10 mins scans ) , and can be considered to be comparable with resting pet [ 23 ] .
hence the alff - fcn provides a tool to show the brain organization at interim time scale window of particular brain state .
as analogue to the network analysis in pet or spect studies , the positive and negative correlations in alff - fcn may indicate the coherence and inhibition of interregional brain activity [ 41 ] .
however , the alff - fcn study revealed more information about the brain network organization property than the pet of network analysis [ 40 ] .
the present study revealed hierarchical organization properties of human brain from individual network , module and system levels through the three network approaches .
firstly , at individual network level , networks produced with identical seed region across ts - icn , alff - fcn and vbm - scn showed similar spatial pattern and largely overlapped .
regarding the previous finding that the scns were shown to recapitulate the canonical icn topologies [ 19 ] , [ 42 ] , the results indicate that the individual networks in the human brain are robustly organized with consistent spatial patterns , regardless of the analysis procedure used .
although substantial overlaps were observed between the ts - icn , alff - fcn , and vbm - scn , there were differences between the covariance based maps .
for example , the ts - icn , in which the statistic analyses were performed at the group level , had the greatest spatial distribution .
the vbm - scn , although has the same statistical level with alff - fcn , showed the most limited spatial distribution .
the difference of spatial patterns of these three methods may attribute to the difference of data modalities ( i.e. , functional and structural ) , covariance level or time scales .
when seeding at the three rois in one roi set , the alff - fcns showed consistent spatial pattern with large overlap among themselves .
the intra - roi set conjunction analysis revealed network modules of the dmn , tpn and sn. meanwhile , the spatial pattern of each network module mapped by alff - fcn was similar to that revealed by ts - icn .
various studies based on ts - icns have found different patterns of brain network modules .
commonly , the dmn module is robustly detected , but the others have different networks classified manners [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] .
although a few studies have revealed that the networks in the sn system , i.e. , the somatosensory network , auditory network and visual network present separate modules [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] , these networks are mostly detected with an integrative pattern under task - or resting state [ 12 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 43 ] .
the present study showed modular nature of sn by spatial conjunction of ts - icns and alff - fcns .
however , this modular nature was not found in the scns .
interestingly , hierarchical clustering revealed different patterns of networks clustering between the alff - fcn and ts - icn approaches at a system level .
alff - fcns and time - series icns both demonstrated the feature of network dichotomy with anti - correlations , but there were different dichotomic patterns .
for alff - fcns , the dichotomy consists by the high - level cognitive system covering the dmn and tpn regions , and the low - level cognitive system covering all sensory regions .
this pattern was consistent with the traditional view of brain partitions [ 17 ] .
this novel dichotomic pattern was significant different from the one revealed by ts - icn .
fox et al. , have divided the resting state brain network into dichotomy of dmn and tpn [ 5 ] .
these two ts - icns are responsible for the immediately competitive activities of the internal mentation and external goal - oriented task , respectively [ 5 ] .
hence , regarding the alff - fcn dichotomy which hierarchically consisted of high - and low - level cognitive systems , we tentatively suppose that there is , at least two types of competitive systems organizing the resting - state brain activities .
at a small time - scale of instantaneous bold time points , the brain activity of the external system ( i.e. , the dmn ) is dynamically opposed to that of the external system ( i.e. , the tpn ) [ 5 ] ; while at a rather larger time scale of state period , the brain activity of the high - level brain network regions are competitive with that of the low - level network regions .
this supposition may be supported by a few of recent findings .
at scales of short period of time , the dmn activity can be affected by different lower grade perceptive cognition load , such as the visual [ 44 ] , auditory [ 45 ] and tactile processes [ 46 ] .
the findings indicate that , the brain network may have different system organization patterns at different time scales .
another noteworthy finding is the switching of the network roles played by the thalamus .
the thalamus often appears in the dmn mapped by time - series icn [ 14 ] , [ 47 ] .
in contrast , in alff - fcns , the thalamus appears excluded from the usual dmn in favor of the sensory network , however , the meanings of this manifestation still need further investigation in future studies .
methodological consideration and limitations based on the previous findings of the ts - icns and vbm - scns , this study for the first time investigated the alff - fcn by applying the cross - subjects correlation to fmri data .
the alff - fcn was considered to represent the profile or pattern of brain organization that underlies a neuro - pathophysiology or particular brain state .
the physiological significance of alff - fcn is still far from clear .
different cognition - loads during scans were firstly assumed to be one origin of the alff variance [ 27 ] .
however , the limitation of this study is the absence of detailed behavioral data during scan , such as the resting - state questionnaire [ 48 ] .
secondly , for excluding the possible bias from the subject variant , a longitude study based on multiple scans of same subjects may be the ideal model for study the covariance in different states .
thirdly , in an intuitive sense , the alff - fcn is somewhat similar to the metabolic functional connectivity in pet studies [ 23 ] .
a recent pet study has investigated the metabolic network architecture at whole brain level by seeding with 70 rois , but the results showed that connectivity from each seed region was restricted within a separated network , few network demonstrated wide distributed pattern [ 40 ] .
rather small sample of subjects ( n = 50 ) and different imaging modalities may both be the reason for different demonstrations between the metabolic networks and alff - fcns .
future study based on large amount pet data may help clarify the neuro - physiological meaning of alff - fcns .
fourthly , in the paper we adopted global signals regression for seed - based correlation analysis in order to keep in line with the previous studies [ 5 ] , [ 19 ] .
it is known that correction for global signals is prone to produce extensive anti - correlations , although there currently remains controversy on the essential of global signals regression [ 33 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
conclusion the present study investigated the functional covariance based alff measurement across subjects , and proposed an alff - fcn approach to measure the interregional correlation of brain activity responding to short periods of state. by combining alff - fcn with ts - icn and vbm - scn approaches , we also investigated the brain networks at different time scales , and found the human brain is differently organized at levels of network , module and system .
a novel alff - fcn dichotomy may suggest that the resting - state brain activity is anti - correlated between the high - level and low - level functional networks across short periods of states at a meso - time scale level .
materials and methods subjects and mri methods our analyses were performed based on two neuroimaging datasets including both structural and rs - fmri data from total 310 healthy subjects .
the first was obtained from the jinling hospital at nanjing university ( n = 112 ) .
the second was from the state key laboratory of cognitive neuroscience and learning at beijing normal university ( n = 198 ) , which now is part of the " 1000 functional connectomes " project ( http :// www.nitrc.org / projects / fcon _ 1000 /) .
all participants from the two centers homogenously consisted of 140 males ( age : 21.86 +/ - 1.97 years ) and 170 females ( age : 21.52 +/ - 1.91 years ) young college students .
they all had no history of neurological and psychiatric disorders .
written informed consent was obtained from each participant , and the study was approved by the institutional review boards at jinling hospital and the state key laboratory of cognitive neuroscience and learning at beijing normal university .
during the resting state , participants were instructed to keep still with their eyes closed but not fall asleep , remain as motionless as possible .
mri data were acquired on same machine type scanners ( siemens 3t trio ) with almost identical protocols .
specifically , functional images ( jinling hospital / beijing normal university ) were acquired by using of single - shot gradient echo - echo imaging ( gre - epi ) sequence ( repetition time : 2000 ms / 2000 ms ; echo time : 30 ms / 30 ms ; slices : 30 / 33 ; thickness : 4 mm / 3 mm ; gap : 0.4 mm / 0.6 mm ; field of view : 240 mmx240 mm / 200 mmx200 mm ; in - plane resolution : 64x64 / 64x64 ; flip angle : 90degrees / 90degrees ) .
structural images ( jinling hospital / beijing normal university ) were acquired by using 3 - dimensional magnetization - prepared rapid gradient - echo ( mprage ) sequence ( repetition time : 2300 ms / 2530 ms ; echo time : 2.98 ms / 3.39 ms ; inversion time : 900 ms / 1100 ms ; field of view : 256 mmx256 mm / 256 mmx256 mm ; flip angle : 9degrees / 7degrees ; in - plane resolution : 256x256 / 256x256 ) after excluding 10 individual data with artifacts , 300 datasets were employed for subsequent analyses .
data preprocessing and analysis rs - fmri datasets were processed using a toolkit of dparsf which synthesizes spm8 procedures [ 31 ] .
functional images were first preprocessed including slice timing correction , realignment of all images to the first image , spatial normalization to montreal neurological institute 152 ( mni152 ) template with 3x3x3 mm3 re - sampling , spatial smoothing with an 8 mm full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) isotropic gaussian kernel , and temporal band - pass filtering ( 0.01 - 0.08 hz ) .
to calculate alff measure at each voxel , the time series was transformed to the frequency domain by using fast fourier transform .
the power spectrum was then computed and square root - transformed at each voxel .
the averaged square root of activity in the low - frequency band ( 0.01 - 0.08 hz ) was taken as the alff .
the alff value of each voxel was standardized by dividing the full - brain mean alff values [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
structural data were preprocessed using vbm8 implemented in spm8 .
the images of each subject were transformed into standard mni152 space with a 12 - parameter affine - only non - linear transformation , and re - sampled to 1.5x1.5x1.5 mm3 .
all images were then segmented into three tissue classes representing gray matter ( gm ) , white matter ( wm ) and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .
the resultant tissue images were further smoothed with an 8 mm fwhm isotropic gaussian kernel for subsequent morphometry analyses .
network measurements and analyses to compare architectures of ts - icns , vbm - scns and alff - fcns , nine spherical cerebral regions with radius of 6.0 mm from previous studies [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 32 ] served as seed rois .
these rois were selected to seed the network connectivity of dmn , tpn and sensory networks ( sn ) .
the first roi set included : the posterior cingulate cortex ( pcc ) ( mni coordinates : 0 , - 56 , 30 ) dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ( dmpfc ) ( 0 , 54 , 30 ) and left angular gyrus ( ag ) ( - 45 , - 66 , 30 ) within the dmn ; the second roi set included : right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ( dlpfc ) ( 42 , 45 , 26 ) , left intraparietal lobular ( ipl ) ( - 20 , - 60 , 54 ) and left frontal eye field ( fef ) ( - 26 , 2 , 52 ) in the tpn ; and the third roi set included : the left primary somatosensory cortex ( sc ) ( - 50 , - 24 , 46 ) , left primary visual cortex ( vc ) ( - 20 , - 84 , - 4 ) and left auditory cortex ( ac ) ( - 60 , - 18 , 2 ) in the sn. ts - icn at an individual level analysis , a general - linear - model ( glm ) in spm8 was used to calculate the voxel - wise time - series correlation map for each roi .
the head motion parameters , averaged signals from the subject - specific csf and wm , and the global brain signal were regressed out to remove the possible spurious variances [ 5 ] , [ 33 ] .
at a group - level analysis , a random - effect analysis of one - sample t - tests ( p < 0.05 , fwe corrected ) was performed for each roi - based map .
the center , individual gender and age were entered as covariates in group - level analysis .
alff - fcn the averaged regional alff values within each roi were extracted from each subject and used as a regressor in the glm .
this analysis produced fcn t - map for each roi , which reflects the covarying alff across subjects between a brain region and the seed roi ( i.e. , alff - fcn ) .
the mean wm and csf alff values , the center , individual gender and age were modeled as covariates in regression analyses ( p < 0.05 , family wise error [ fwe ] corrected ) .
vbm - scn similar to the analyses in zielinski et al .
[ 19 ] and the procedure of the vbm - scn computation , the mean values of gray matter volume in each roi was extracted from each subject , and used as a regressor of the glm in spm8 to produce group - level vbm - scn t - maps .
the total cranial volume , the whole gray matter volume , the center , the individual gender and age were modeled as covariates in regression analyses ( p < 0.05 , fwe corrected ) .
clustering analysis of hierarchical organization of brain networks to investigate the hierarchical organization of brain networks , a hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to the nine maps of roi - based networks in alff - fcn , ts - icn and vbm - scn , respectively .
for each pair of roi - based network maps , the spatial correlation coefficient () was first transformed into a dissimilarity distance () , as previously suggested [ 34 ] .
then , nine seed - based network maps were hierarchically aggregated according to a minimal dissimilarity cluster distance .
conjunction analysis of brain networks alff - fcns conjunction : conjunction analysis [ 5 ] was used to combine the nine alff - fcn maps with similar spatial pattern of network .
first , the alff - fcn maps were combined within each roi set .
this intra - roi set conjunction analysis was anticipated to be used for observation of the brain network module patterns .
the voxels whose t values survived at a threshold at p < 0.05 ( fwe corrected ) were averaged .
the average was masked by using a conservative conjunction procedure .
voxels were included in the mask only if they were significantly correlated or anti - correlated with at least 2 of the 3 seed regions .
second , under the guidance by the result of clustering analysis ( see section of results ) , we multiplied the correlation maps of the third roi set ( the sensory system ) by - 1 .
then the correlation maps of the first and the second roi sets were combined to those of the third roi set .
voxels were included in the mask only if they were significantly correlated or anti - correlated with at least 8 of the 9 seed regions .
the inter - roi set analysis was anticipated to be used for observation of brain network system patterns .
to compare the patterns network dichotomy between the alff - fcn dichotomy and ts - icn approaches , we repeated the ts - icn dichotomy in line with the work of fox et al. , [ 5 ] .
the correlation maps for the dmn roi sets were multiplied by - 1 then averaged with the correlation maps from the tpn roi sets .
then these two groups of correlation maps were combined to yield the ts - icn dichotomy consisting of the positive and negative correlations .
in addition , the correlation t - maps were combined within each roi set in line with the alff - fcns conjunctions .
since no significant negative correlation and no obvious partition brain network systems ( see below ) was found in the scns , the conjunction analysis was not applied to the scns .

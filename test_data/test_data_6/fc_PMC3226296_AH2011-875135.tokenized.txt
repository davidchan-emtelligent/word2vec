thymidine phosphorylase may be overexpressed in both neoplastic cells and tumor stromal cells in a variety of malignancies .
our study explores thymidine phosphorylase expression in lymph nodes ( lns ) from patients with mycosis fungoides ( mf ) or sezary syndrome ( ss ) .
in mf / ss , the lns may have a pathologic diagnosis of either dermatopathic lymphadenopathy ( ln - dl ) or involvement by mf / ss ( ln - mf ) .
we performed immunohistochemical staining on mf / ss lymph nodes using antibodies to thymidine phosphorylase , cd68 , cd21 , cd3 , and cd4 .
in both ln - dl and benign nodes , thymidine phosphorylase staining was noted only in macrophages , dendritic cells , and endothelial cells .
in ln - mf , thymidine phosphorylase expression was also noted in subsets of intermediate to large neoplastic t cells .
concurrent cd68 , cd21 , cd3 , and cd4 staining supported the above observations .
similar results were noted in the skin and in ln - mf with large cell transformation .
other t - cell lymphomas were also examined ( total 7 cases ) ; only enteropathy - type t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) showed tp positivity in neoplastic t lymphocytes .
we demonstrated that thymidine phosphorylase staining is present in neoplastic t cells in mycosis fungoides .
the exact mechanism needs further investigation .
1. introduction mycosis fungoides ( mf ) and sezary syndrome ( ss ) are the most common types of cutaneous t - cell lymphomas and represent clonal proliferations of neoplastic cd4 + t cells .
mf initially develops in an indolent fashion as a skin - confined disease .
however , with progressive disease , malignant t cells involve skin - associated lymph nodes ( lns ) , thereby indicating a higher clinical stage [ 1 ] .
the presence of circulating neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood is the hallmark of ss. lymphadenopathy in mf / ss ranges from dermatopathic lymphadenopathy ( dl ) , a reactive pattern associated with various chronic skin diseases , to clearcut involvement by malignant t cells that results in partial or complete effacement of lymph node structure ( mf - ln ) .
smaller numbers of atypical or neoplastic cells may be found in dl , but the prognostic significance is unclear [ 2 ] .
various mechanisms have been implicated in the complexity of tumorigenesis , including imbalance of subsets of t - regulatory cells and cytokine levels [ 3 - 5 ] and dysregulation of chemokine receptors , including ccr4 , cxcr4 , ccr10 [ 6 - 8 ] , and p16 [ 9 ] .
however , the mechanism of tumorigenesis has not been well established .
thymidine phosphorylase ( tp ) , also known as platelet - derived endothelial cell growth factor , may be overexpressed in both neoplastic cells and tumor stromal cells in a variety of cancers , including breast [ 10 ] , colorectal [ 11 ] , gastric [ 12 ] , esophageal [ 13 ] , lung [ 14 ] , and bladder [ 15 ] .
tp is thought to promote tumorigenesis by inducing tumor cell growth through both inhibition of the apoptosis pathway [ 16 - 19 ] and tumor angiogenesis via the pi3k - mtor ( phosphoinositide 3 - kinase - mammalian target of rapamycin ) pathway [ 20 ] .
in addition , tp expression in neoplastic cells can be used as a biomarker to predict response to chemotherapy and survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , breast cancer , and other cancers [ 21 , 22 ] .
however , few studies regarding the role of tp in hematopoietic malignancy have been reported .
we studied tp expression in mf - ln .
2. materials and methods experimental protocols were approved by the institutional review board of drexel university college of medicine .
archived paraffin blocks with lns from 51 patients with mf and ss ( 1991 - 2010 ) were used to construct a tissue microarray .
thirty - four of 51 mf / ss patients had a pathologic diagnosis of dl and 17 had partially or completely effaced lns by mf or ss. immunohistochemical ( ihc ) staining using antibodies to tp , cd68 , cd21 , cd3 , and cd4 was performed .
nine cases of benign lns were included as control .
archived unstained skin slides were also used to test tp expression from patients with mf in skin - confined stage ( 5 cases ) , mf - ln with large cell transformation ( 1 case ) , extranodal nk / t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) , peripheral t - cell lymphoma ( 2 cases ) , enteropathy - type t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) , angioimmunoblastic t - cell lymphoma ( 2 cases ) , and syringotropic cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) .
for ihc staining , the slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of alcohol .
ihc staining was performed using an automated system ( dako autostainer , universal staining system autostainer , carpinteria , calif ) .
the primary antibodies used in this study were tp ( 1 : 1000 ; novus biologicals , littleton , colo ) , cd3 ( 1 : 100 ; dako ) , cd4 ( 1 : 10 ; dako ) , cd68 ( 1 : 2000 ; dako ) , and cd21 ( 1 : 50 ; vector , burlingame , calif ) , used for tissue microarray blocks .
markers used for skin slides were cd4 and tp ; tp was used as a marker for all other t - cell lymphomas .
3. results and discussion in control lns , tp staining was noted only in macrophages , dendritic cells , and endothelial lining cells , with a cytoplasmic and nuclear staining pattern .
small lymphocytes were negative for tp. a similar tp ihc staining pattern was noted in dl. positive tp immunostaining was noted in 30 % to 80 % of intermediate to large neoplastic t cells in all mf - ln cases with a predominantly cytoplasmic staining pattern ( figure 1 ) .
small lymphocytes were negative for tp , and macrophages , dendritic cells , and endothelial lining cells were again positive for tp. concurrent cd68 and cd21 staining supported the above observations ( figure 1 ) .
ihc staining in mf - skin ( figures 2 ( a ) - 2 ( c )) and in mf - ln with large cell transformation ( figure 2 ( d )) showed a similar staining pattern .
positive tp staining was noted in the neoplastic t cells in one case of enteropathy - type t - cell lymphoma ( figure 3 ) .
in other lymphoma cases ( extranodal nk / t - cell lymphoma , peripheral t - cell lymphoma , angioimmunoblastic t - cell lymphoma , and syringotropic cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ) positive tp staining was only noted in macrophages and endothelial cells .
thymidine phosphorylase was found to be present in benign tissue , such as spleen , liver , lymph nodes , esophagus , and rectum , and in a variety of cells , including macrophages , stromal cells , glial cells , endothelial cells , and reticulocytes , with a cytoplasmic or nuclear pattern [ 23 , 24 ] .
studies have shown that tp is overexpressed in both neoplastic cells and tumor stromal cells in a variety of malignancies such as breast , colorectal , gastric , esophageal , lung , and bladder .
we demonstrated that tp expression is present not only in macrophages , dendritic meshworks , and endothelial lining cells but also in intermediate to large neoplastic t lymphocytes .
to our knowledge , 2 previous studies have reported on tp expression in hematopoietic malignancies .
in 1990 , yoshimura et al .
[ 24 ] , using immunoblotting , demonstrated higher tp expression in tissues from patients with t - and b - cell malignant lymphomas than from those with lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias .
however , they did not determine which cells expressed tp in the hematopoietic malignancies .
in 1997 doussis - anagnostopoulou et al .
[ 25 ] used ihc staining to test tp expression in a variety of tissues from patients with hematopoietic malignancies .
malignancies tested included hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 20 cases ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( 2 cases ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) , follicular lymphoma ( 10 cases ) , diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( 8 cases ) , peripheral t - cell lymphoma ( 7 cases ) , intestinal t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) , and anaplastic large t - cell lymphoma ( 1 case ) .
tp expression was noted only in the meshwork of dendritic cells , macrophages , and endothelial cells but not in neoplastic cells .
the authors commented that the expression of tp in dendritic cells and macrophages might be due to cytokine production and dysregulation contributing to the tumor microenvironment .
we have demonstrated that tp expression is present in neoplastic t cells in lns , skin involved with mf or ss ( table 1 ) .
this phenomenon may be due to changes intrinsic to the tumor cells themselves , or it may reflect interactions between the tumor microenvironment and the lymphoma cells .
the exact mechanism of increased tp expression in lymphoma cells needs further investigation and may have therapeutic implications .
data are scarce regarding tp expression in other neoplastic t - cell lymphomas , and further study would be worthwhile .

we previously demonstrated that culturing antigen - sensitized draining lymph node ( dln ) lymphocytes from balb / c mice in interleukin ( il ) - 7 / 15 after activation with bryostatin / ionomycin ( b / i ) is superior to culture in il - 2 for expansion , differentiation to cluster of differentiation ( cd ) 8 + cells and anti - tumor activity .
we sought to determine whether the substitution or addition of il - 21 to culture had a similar effect .
dln lymphocytes were antigen - sensitized with 4t1 mammary carcinoma 10 days prior to harvest , activated with b / i , and expanded in culture for 7 days with either il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 , or il - 7 / 15 / 21 .
cellular expansion , phenotype , interferon ( ifn ) - gamma responses , and in vivo anti - tumor activity were compared .
we found that t cells grown in il7 / 15 / 21 demonstrated significantly greater lymphocyte expansion than il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , and il - 7 / 15 ( 38.4 - fold vs. 5.5 , 6.6 , 9.5 , and 23.9 - fold , respectively ). of these expanded cells , il - 7 / 15 / 21 significantly expanded the greatest percentage of cd8 + cells ( 67.1 % vs. 22.2 % , 47.2 % , 47.4 % , and 55.3 % , respectively ) , and the greatest number of t central memory cells ( tcm ) compared to il - 2 , il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 ( 45.8 % vs. 11.1 % , 7.7 % , and 12.1 % , respectively ) .
il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 - expanded t cells preferentially differentiated into t naive cells ( tn ) vs. those expanded in il - 2 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 ( 27.6 % and 23.2 % vs. 1.7 % , 4.5 % , and 10.4 % , respectively ) , and demonstrated the highest ifn - gamma levels in vitro .
in vivo adoptive immunotherapy ( ait ) experiments demonstrated anti - tumor efficacy was equally effective using il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - cultured lymphocytes vs. control or cyclophosphamide alone , even at lower doses or with greater initial size of tumor prior to treatment .
adoptive immunotherapy mammary carcinoma il - 21 t lymphocytes 1 .
introduction adoptive immunotherapy ( ait ) , infusing ex vivo - expanded lymphocytes for the treatment of cancer in animals and humans , has been a rapidly growing area of interest [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] .
while demonstrating promising results in murine tumor models , a regimen for human therapy that optimizes both lymphocyte expansion as well as tumor regression remains elusive .
ait enhances ex vivo activation and expansion of t cells outside of the suppressive in vivo tumor environment and allows the immune cells to be " re - programmed " in order to optimize their function .
this also allows for additional treatment of the host , including host lymphocyte depletion , prior to re - introducing the selected cells , which decreases immunosuppression and optimizes trafficking and / or proliferation of the infused cells .
in a 4t1 murine mammary cancer model which is weakly immunogenic and aggressively metastatic , we have shown that t cells from tumor antigen - sensitized draining lymph nodes ( dln ) can be expanded to significantly greater numbers than the current standard approach using interleukin ( il ) - 2 alone after exposure to il - 7 and 15 , following activation with bryostatin and ionomycin ( b / i ) [ 6 ] .
these t cells were able to induce tumor regression as effectively as , if not better than , t cells grown in il - 2 [ 6 ] .
when bryostatin - 1 , a macrocyclic lactone derived from a marine invertebrate bulgula neritina , is combined in culture with lymphocytes , it activates protein kinase c , while ionomycin increases intracellular calcium [ 7,8,9 ] .
when used together , these mimic signaling via the cd3 / t cell receptor ( tcr ) complex , promoting activation and proliferation of t cells [ 6,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 ] .
b / i selectively activates cd62l - t cells , the " sensitized " t cells capable of anti - tumor activity .
compared to anti - cd3 activation , this effect is unique to b / i activation [ 7,15 ] .
recently , we demonstrated that b / i activation in combination with alternate cytokines re - programs human t cells and natural killer ( nk ) cells , causing them to become resistant to suppression by myeloid - derived suppressor cells [ 11 ] .
it has been shown in multiple studies that il - 2 - expansion induces regulatory t cells and t cell activation - induced cell death , whereas il - 7 / 15 has been shown by this lab and others to support preferential differentiation of cd8 + t cells towards a central memory ( tcm ) phenotype [ 6,10,17 ] .
it has been suggested that this central memory phenotype is more effective at inducing tumor regression than terminally differentiated effector cells , which are more likely to be selectively expanded with exposure to il - 2 [ 17,18 ] .
encouraged by our results with il - 7 / 15 , we endeavored to add or substitute il - 21 , a recently - identified member of the family of cytokines that shares the common gamma chain cytokine receptor with il - 2 , il - 7 and il - 15 , to our expansion regimen [ 19,20 ] .
other groups have previously demonstrated the potent immunomodulatory effects on t cells of il - 21 [ 21,22,23,24 ] .
the resultant t cell phenotype stimulated by exposure to il - 21 has varied , with some studies demonstrating an increase in tcm cells , while other studies claimed inhibition [ 19,25,26 ] .
therefore , we also performed flow cytometry analysis of cells after exposure to b / i and expansion in various cytokines to elucidate which phenotypes were preferentially selected .
finally , it has been suggested that both il - 15 and il - 21 are able to enhance the in vivo anti - tumor effects of cd8 + t cells and , in some cases , potentiate tumor regression [ 24,27,28,29,30,31,32 ] .
we endeavored to discover if antigen - sensitized t cells cultured in b / i with il - 21 exposure alone or combination with il - 2 or il - 7 / 15 would increase their expansion .
we also aimed to study the effect on t cell phenotype and interferon gamma production in vitro , and whether it would increase in vivo anti - tumor activity .
2. results 2.1 .
expansion comparison of 4t1 draining lymph node ( dln ) cells in interleukin ( il ) - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 or il - 7 / 15 / 21 averaged over seven repeated experiments , cells cultured in il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 after activation with b / i expanded to significantly higher numbers than those cultured in with il - 2 , il - 21 or il - 2 / 21 ( 23.9 and 38.4 - fold increase vs. 5.5 , 6.6 and 9.5 - fold respectively ; p < 0.008 ; figure 1 ) .
in addition , expansion of cells cultured in il - 7 / 15 / 21 was significantly greater than for those cultured in il - 7 / 15 ( p = 0.028 ) .
we also noted that when we continued to culture cells for 14 days , the fold increases in il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - cultured cells continued to increase , whereas the number of cells cultured in il - 2 , il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 remained static .
this finding is similar to our earlier studies demonstrating that not only do il - 2 cultured cells not continue to expand beyond 7 days in culture , but cells begin to decline in number and have poor viability after that time .
2.2 .
t cell phenotype after 6 days in culture , flow cytometry was used to analyze the phenotypes of the lymphocytes expanded in different cytokines .
as shown in figure 2a , a representative experiment of five total experiments was performed .
cd4 and cd8 sorting was performed on viable lymphocytes on day 0 prior to b / i and il2 activation and after 6 days in culture with the various cytokines .
over these five experiments , il - 7 / 5 / 21 - cultured lymphocytes were noted to have the highest percentage of cd8 + t cell lymphocytes , with an average percentage of 67.1 % compared to day 0 ( 15.6 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 2 ( 22.2 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 21 ( 47.2 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 2 / 21 ( 47.4 % p < 0.0001 ) , and il - 7 / 15 ( 55.3 % p = 0.005 ; figure 2b ) .
in fact , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 and il - 7 / 15 , in addition to il - 7 / 15 / 21 , expanded with a significantly higher proportion of cd8 + t lymphocytes compared to il - 2 ( all p < 0.0001 ) .
the only two groups that were not statistically different from each other were il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 .
when total cell count after expansion and phenotypic proportion were taken into account , lymphocytes exposed to il - 7 / 15 / 21 produced 1681.5 million cd8 + t cells on day 6 versus 726.1 million ( p = 0.0005 ) for cells grown in il - 7 / 15 , 437.3 million cells grown in il - 2 / 21 ( p < 0.0001 ) , 282.8 million cells grown in il - 21 ( p < 0.0001 ) , and 104.7 million cells grown in il - 2 over 6 days ( p < 0.0001 ) from a starting population that averaged 13 million cells on day 0 for each group ( figure 2c ) .
again , the only groups not statistically significant from each other were il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 .
the expanded cells were also analyzed for their cd8 + t cell subsets on day 6 and compared to phenotypic expression on day 0 and among the different groups .
a representative experiment is demonstrated in figure 3a , demonstrating the t cell phenotypes of cd8 + t cells after b / i activation and expansion in various cytokines for 6 days .
when sorted for t central memory ( tcm ) phenotype ( cd44 + , cd62lhi ) , il - 7 / 15 / 21 - cultured cells had the highest percentage of this phenotype ( 45.8 %) compared to day 0 ( 8.8 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 2 - cultured cells ( 11.1 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 21 - cultured cells ( 7.7 % p < 0.0001 ) , and il - 2 / 21 - cultured cells ( 12.1 % p < 0.0001 ) , as shown in figure 3b .
there was no significant difference between il - 715 / 21 - cultured t cells and il - 7 / 15 - cultured cells ( 35.7 % p = 0.2 ) for this phenotype .
il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 - expanded t cells , however , expanded the highest percentages of cd44 - , cd62l + cells , a so so - called t " naive " ( tn ) population as it has been described in the literature [ 1,33 ] .
il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 expanded 27.6 % and 23.2 % of t " naive " cells vs. day 0 ( 4.8 % p <= 0.004 ) , il - 2 ( 1.7 % p < 0.0001 ) , il - 7 / 15 ( 4.5 % p <= 0.0007 ) and il - 7 / 15 / 21 ( 10.4 % p = 0.01 and p = 0.06 , respectively ) , as shown in figure 3c .
again , when total cell count after expansion and phenotypic proportion were taken into account , not surprisingly , lymphocytes expanded in il - 7 / 15 / 21 had the highest yield of tcm cells averaged over five experiments , with 1124.1 million cells vs. 468.8 million for il - 7 / 15 - expanded cells ( p = 0.03 ) , 140.5 million for il - 2 / 21 - expanded cells ( p = 0.0001 ) , 53.3 million for il - 21 - expanded cells ( p < 0.0001 ) , and 54.2 million for il - 2 - expanded cells ( p < 0.0001 ) from a starting amount of 7.3 million cells on day 0 ( p < 0.0001 ) , as shown in figure 3d .
for the subset of tn cells , il - 7 / 15 / 21 - expansion and il - 2 / 21 - expansion resulted in the highest yield values averaged over five experiments , with 187.6 million and 182.1 million tn cells , respectively ( figure 3e ) .
in the case of il - 7 / 15 / 21 - expansion this was due to the overall higher number of total cells expanded vs. il - 2 / 21 - expansion where the high yield of tn cells was due to the high percentage of that particular phenotype which was expanded despite lower total post - expansion cell numbers .
il - 21 expanded the next highest total tn cell yield with 145.9 million , which was not statistically significantly different to il - 7 / 15 / 21 and il - 2 / 21 .
il - 7 / 15 - expansion led to a tn cell yield of 57 million , which was significantly more than for day 0 or il - 2 ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001 respectively ) , and also significantly less than il - 7 / 15 / 21 , il - 2 / 21 and il - 21 yields ( p = 0.0009 , p = 0.007 , and p = 0.01 ) .
il - 2 - expanded cells yielded an average of 7.7 million tn cells , which was only slightly higher , yet still significantly more than the day 0 population at 4.5 million ( p = 0.02 ) .
2.3 .
interferon ( ifn ) - gamma elisa dln t cells activated with b / i and cultured with il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 or il - 7 / 15 / 21 for 7 days were harvested and cultured for 24 h alone or with irradiated 4t1 murine mammary carcinoma cells to stimulate ifn - gamma release .
as shown in figure 4 , il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 - expanded t cells co - cultured with irradiated 4t1 resulted in the largest release of ifn - gamma at 14,700 pg / ml and 11,900 pg / ml respectively , which were statistically different from each other ( p = 0.006 ) .
these were far higher than all the other co - cultured groups , with all p values < 0.0001 .
il - 2 - co - cultured t cells produced 8240 pg / ml of ifn - gamma , il - 7 / 15 - co - cultured cells produced 6380 pg / ml , and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - co - cultured cells produced the least of the co - cultured groups at 1524 pg / ml. due to the small standard deviations these were all statistically significantly different from each other with the highest p value = 0.02 between il - 2 and il - 7 / 15 - co - cultured cells .
controls in the form of 4t1 irradiated cells alone , il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - cultured cells alone ( without 4t1 in co - culture ) and media alone were used .
the amount of ifn - gamma produced by controls was insignificant compared to the co - culture groups. of note , similar to our previous research with il - 2 and il - 7 / 15 - expanded cells co - cultured with irradiated 4t1 tumor cells , we found that il - 7 / 15 - cultured cells produced less ifn - gamma than did the il - 2 - cultured t cells .
as shown previously as well , the ifn - gamma secretion in response to 4t1 cells by dln cells activated with b / i and expanded in vitro is tumor antigen - specific [ 16,34 ] .
2.4 .
anti - tumor efficacy mice treated with cyclophosphamide alone or cyclophosphamide plus ait with the standard dose of lymphocytes ( 50 million cells / mouse intravenously ) expanded for 7 days in il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 , il - 7 / 15 / 21 after 4t1 flank injections ( 4 - day tumor growth ) demonstrated significantly better flank tumor shrinkage compared to the control group ( figure 5a ; p = 0.02 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , respectively ) .
in addition , the il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - cultured dln cells were significantly better at shrinking tumors than cyclophosphamide alone ( p = 0.02 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , respectively ). of note , only 1 of the 5 mice in the il - 2 group was cured of tumor ( no visible tumor 42 days after injection ) , whereas in the il / 15 / 21 group , four of the five mice were cured and all five mice were cured of tumor in the il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 and il - 7 / 15 groups .
even at a decreased dose of lymphocytes ( 10 million cells / mouse ) the il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 groups were significantly better at slowing or decreasing tumor growth than the control or the cyclophosphamide - alone groups ( figure 5b ; all p < 0.0001 ) .
likewise , when the flank tumor was allowed to grow for 7 days rather than 4 days prior to ait treatment , the il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 , il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 groups all had significant slowing of tumor growth or tumor regression when compared to the control or cyclophosphamide - alone groups ( figure 5c ; p < 0.03 ) .
3. discussion as we have demonstrated previously in the b16 melanoma system , we have now demonstrated in mammary carcinoma that culturing b / i - activated lymphocytes from tumor - sensitized mice in il - 7 / 15 / 21 results in a much higher yield of viable cells than those grown in il - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 / 21 and even il - 7 / 15 .
a recent review highlighted factors that were associated with effective adoptive immunotherapy [ 1 ] .
in this review , the magnitude of tumor regression was strongly correlated with the absolute number of infused cells .
in addition , the least differentiated cells ( tcm cells ) demonstrated the most effective anti - tumor activity .
we demonstrate that the expansion of lymphocytes in il - 7 / 15 / 21 following activation with b / i results in a dramatic increase in the total number of cells , with a final actual yield of cd8 + t cells over one billion from an average starting number of 13 million on day 0. of these cd8 + t cells , approximately half were tcm cells .
lymphocytes expanded in il - 7 / 15 / 21 were then found to be as effective as lymphocytes cultured in other cytokines at impeding tumor growth or curing tumors in vivo without vaccine or exogenous cytokine administration .
this was true even at a lower dose of lymphocytes or with larger tumors .
this finding suggests that lymphocytes grown in il - 7 / 15 / 21 are capable of achieving high numbers of total cells , the majority of which are cd8 + tcm cells that have significant anti - tumor effect against tumors in vivo .
in addition , this also demonstrates that by using these cytokine combinations , tcm cells need not be sorted to a pure population to be effective in their anti - tumor function , which for adoptive immunotherapy purposes is more clinically feasible .
however , should sorting be desired , the total number of cells produced with expansion renders this goal possible .
we observed consistently that lymphocytes expanded in il - 21 were comparable in their total expansion to il - 2 ( current standard ) .
il 2 / 21 was significantly better than il - 2 at expansion but not nearly to the extent of those cultured in il - 7 / 15 or il - 7 / 15 / 21 .
il - 21 and il - 2 / 21were very similar in the percentage of cd8 + cells expanded , significantly more than il - 2 , but less than il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21. of these cd8 + cells , however , il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 expanded the largest number of t " naive " cells , those that are cd62l + cd44 - . in addition , cells cultured in il - 21 or il - 2 / 21 demonstrated the highest ifn - gamma release response when combined with irradiated 4t1 cells .
this is in contrast to what we found with the b16 melanoma model , but similar to our recent observations comparing il - 2 and il - 7 / 15 in the 4t1 mammary carcinoma model [ 6,10 ] .
here , we observed a shift away from ifn - gamma production for il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 - expanded lymphocytes vs. il - 2 , il - 21 and il - 2 / 21 - expanded lymphocytes .
this is thought to be characteristic of differentiation toward tcm cells and different from terminally differentiated effector cells [ 18,35 ] .
the equally efficacious anti - tumor activity of the il - 7 / 15 and il - 7 / 15 / 21 lymphocytes in vivo , despite lower effector function , is in agreement with findings of other authors who suggest that t cells with greater cytotoxicity or ifn - gamma release may be less effective at inducing tumor regression than memory t cells [ 17,18,30 ] .
in many studies , it has been suggested that exposure to il - 21 alone results in lymphocytes that remain in or differentiate into a minimally differentiated phenotype ( cd62l + cd44 - ) , and that these lymphocytes have greater anti - tumor capacity relative to cells expanded in other gamma chain cytokines [ 10,27,36 ] .
some have described the lymphocytes expanded in il - 21 with this minimally differentiated phenotype as t stem cell memory ( tscm ) - like cells [ 33 ] .
it is explained that because of the unique ability of il - 21 to sustain signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 ( stat2 ) activation , the cells maintained a " tscm - like state that is associated with high proliferative potential and long - term t cell survival " [ 33 ] .
in our experiments , although lymphocytes expanded in il - 21 or the combination of il - 2 / 21 indeed were enriched for the " minimally differentiated " phenotype of cd62l + cd44 - , this did not translate into a higher proliferative capacity unless in combination with il - 7 and il - 15 .
in addition , this phenotype was not significantly better at impeding tumor growth or curing tumors in vivo compared to those cytokines that expanded other t cell phenotypes .
4. methods 4.1 .
mice virus - free balb / c mice ( national cancer institute , bethesda , md , usa ) between 8 and 12 weeks of age , caged in groups of five or fewer , were provided with food and water ad libitum .
all guidelines of the virginia commonwealth university institutional animal care and use committee , which conform to the american association for accreditation of laboratory animal care and the u.s. department of agriculture recommendations for the care and humane experimental use of animals , were followed .
4.2 .
tumor cell lines 4t1 mammary tumor cell line was kindly provided by jane tsai of the michigan cancer foundation , detroit , michigan .
cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( hyclone , logan , ut , usa ) , 1 mm sodium pyruvate , 100 u / ml penicillin , and 100 microg / ml streptomycin ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ; modified dmem ) .
tumor cells were harvested for inoculation of mice with 0.05 % trypsin - edta ( fisher , pittsburgh , pa , usa ) .
4.3 .
draining lymph node sensitization donor mice were vaccinated in the footpad with 5 x 105 4t1 cells .
ten days after the vaccination , popliteal tumor draining lymph nodes ( tdlns ) were harvested under sterile conditions and placed in roswell park memorial institute ( rpmi ) media per our previous protocol [ 6 ] .
4.4 .
lymphocyte activation and in vitro expansion after harvest , dln were dispersed into a single cell suspension at 1 x 106 cells / ml and activated by incubation with 5 nm bryostatin - 1 ( provided by the national cancer institute , bethesda , md , usa ) and 10 nm ionomycin ( calbiochem , san diego , ca , usa ) , b / i , and 80 u / ml of ril - 2 ( chiron , emeryville , ca , usa ) as per our previous protocol [ 6 ] .
cells were washed and resuspended at 1 - /+ 2 x 106 cells / ml with 40 u / ml of recombinant interleukin ( ril ) - 2 , il - 21 , il - 2 + il - 21 , il - 7 + il - 15 or il - 7 + il - 15 + il - 21 ( 10 ng / ml each ) .
the cells were allowed to proliferate in culture for an additional 6 days and were split every 2 - 3 days to maintain 1 - 2 x 106 cells / ml concentration .
fresh cytokines were added at each split to achieve the same final concentration as at culture initiation .
samples were assessed for the number of viable cells by trypan blue exclusion at various days of culture .
4.5 .
adoptive immunotherapy host mice were inoculated in the left flank with 1 x 104 4t1 cells , which were left to grow for either 4 days ( standard time interval ) or 7 days ( elongated time interval ) .
one day prior to ait , mice were pretreated with cyclophosphamide ( cyp , mead johnson , princeton , nj , usa ) , 100 mg / kg intraperitoneally ( ip ) .
after 6 days in culture , the b / i activated and expanded dln lymphocytes were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline , filtered through a 70 - microm nylon mesh strainer ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) , and 50 million ( regular dose ) or 10 million ( low dose ) cells were injected intravenously ( iv ) in 0.5 ml into host mice .
no systemic cytokines or vaccinations were administered to these tumor - bearing mice .
4.6 .
flow cytometry t cells isolated from dln were stained with a panel of antibodies on day 0 ( immediately after b / i activation ) and on day 6 after activation in vitro .
these stained cells were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry for surface markers on a facsaria canto flow cytometer .
fluorescently labeled antibodies directed against the following markers were obtained from biolegend and ebiosciences : cd4 , cd8 , cd62l , and cd44 .
appropriate isotype controls were used in all cases .
t cell subsets analyzed were t effector ( te ) cd44 + cd62l - , t effector memory ( tem ) cd44 + cd62llow , t central memory ( tcm ) cd44 + cd62lhigh and " t naive " (" tn ") cd44 - cd62l + , as described previously [ 37,38,39 ] .
4.7 .
ifn - gamma release assay interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) release in supernatants from tumor - sensitized and b / i - activated and expanded lymphocytes ( for 7 days ) , in response to stimulation with irradiated 4t1 for 24 h , was assayed using bd opteia mouse ifn - gamma elisa sets from bd biosciences ( san jose , ca , usa ) .
4.8 .
tumor measurements in all the ait experiments , tumor growth was monitored with biweekly measurements of perpendicular diameters and animals were euthanized by co2 inhalation when tumor area was greater than 100 mm2 or if a mouse appeared ill [ 6 ] .
complete tumor regression was defined as the absence of a measurable tumor for three consecutive measurements .
4.9 .
statistical analysis at least five mice were included in each experiment .
each outcome was summarized with basic descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation for each treatment group .
repeated measures analyses of variance through linear mixed models were used to compare the various cytokine conditions in fold increase cell numbers on day 7 from baseline in lymphocytes , each t cell phenotype ( including both percentage and total number of cells of cd4 and cd8 , and te , tem , tcm , and tn ) , in elisa , and in tumor size .
pairwise comparisons of the various cytokines were made and tested at type i error of 5 % by a t - test with the random measurement errors estimated by the linear mixed model .
normality was checked for each analysis .
natural logarithm was used in the data of fold increase of t cell expansion , and percentage and total numbers of t cell phenotypes , and square root was used in elisa for normality .
sas 9.4 was used for all analyses .
5. conclusions we demonstrate here that lymphocytes expanded in the triple combination of il - 7 / 15 / 21 have a large proliferative capacity , significantly greater than the current standard of il - 2 expansion , and are capable of producing billions of not only cd8 + t cells but also cd8 + tcm cells from a starting population of tens of millions of lymphocytes .
these lymphocytes are as effective as il - 2 - expanded cells at slowing tumor growth or curing tumors , even at low doses of cells or with large starting tumors .
this occurs without the need to sort the cells for specific t cell phenotypes , nor is exogenous cytokine administration required , which avoids potential for severe side effects .
vaccinations in vivo also were not required .
these results demonstrate great promise for producing large numbers of highly efficacious anti - tumor lymphocytes for use in adoptive immunotherapy in future human trials .

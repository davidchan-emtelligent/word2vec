in practice , however , the finite quantum dot lifetime and cavity - quantum dot coupling lead to reduced fidelity .
here we show that , with a nearly polarization degenerate microcavity in the weak coupling regime , polarization pre - and postselection can be used to restore high fidelity .
the two orthogonally polarized transmission amplitudes interfere at the output polarizer ; for special polarization angles , which depend only on the device cooperativity , this enables cancellation of light that did not interact with the quantum dot. with this , we can transform incident coherent light into a stream of strongly correlated photons with a second - order correlation value up to 40 , larger than previous experimental results , even in the strong - coupling regime .
this purification technique might also be useful to improve the fidelity of quantum dot based logic gates .
single - photon optical nonlinearity is possible using an optical cavity to create strong coupling between a cavity mode and a two - level quantum system .
here , the authors demonstrate it is also possible in the weak - coupling regime by using quantum interference in a polarization - degenerate cavity .
single - photon nonlinearities enabled by quantum two - level systems are essential for future quantum information technologies , as they are the building block of quantum photonics logic gates1 , deterministic entanglers of independent photons2 and for coupling distant nodes to form a quantum network3 .
near - unity fidelity interaction of photons with a two - level system such as an atom or quantum dot ( qd ) is enabled by embedding it into an optical cavity4 .
next , the electronic and photonic states become bound and form the dressed states5 of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) .
a hallmark of single - photon nonlinearities is the modification of the photon statistics of a quasi - resonant weak coherent input beam6 : the transmitted photon statistics can become antibunched due to the photon blockade effect178 .
the anharmonicity of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) ladder91011 can also be used to reach the regime of photon tunnelling612 where the single - photon component is reduced , leading to enhanced photon correlations , or the appearance of n > 1 multiphoton ' bundles'1314 .
in terms of the second - order photon correlation function g2 ( 0 ) , values up to ~ 2 ( refs 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ) have been obtained experimentally with qds , which hardly exceeds even the classical case of thermal light following bose statistics of g2 ( 0 )= 2 .
in atomic systems with much longer coherence times , values up to ~ 50 have been obtained6 and it is known19 that strict two - photon light sources exhibit diverging g2 ( 0 ) if the two - photon flux is reduced .
most related qd experiments to date have been operating in the strong - coupling regime of cqed , which is considered to be essential due to its photon - number - dependent energy structure61718 .
in the weak - coupling regime , the energy structure is not resolved and it is an open question whether photon - number - dependent jc effects can still be observed20 .
the strong coupling regime , however , requires a small optical mode volume , which in turn makes it extremely hard to achieve polarization degeneracy of the fundamental cavity mode .
this is due to unavoidable deviations from the ideal shape and intrinsic birefringence2122 on the gaas platform , precluding implementation of deterministic polarization - based quantum gates22324 .
here we show , using a nearly polarization - degenerate cavity in the weak coupling cqed regime , that we can transform incident coherent light into a stream of strongly correlated photons with g2 ( 0 )= 25.7 +/ - 0.9 , corresponding to >= 40 in the absence of detector jitter .
the polarization - degenerate cavity enables us to choose the incident polarization thetain = 45degrees such that both fine - structure split qd transitions along and are excited , and we can use a postselection polarizer behind the cavity ( thetaout ) to induce quantum interference of the two transmitted orthogonal polarization components ( fig. 1a ) .
this leads to the appearance of two special postselection polarizer angles ( depending on sample parameters ) , which can be used to restore perfect qd contrast ( red curves in fig. 1b ) .
this compensates fully for reduced qd cavity coupling due to finite qd lifetime and qd cavity coupling strength , leading to complete suppression of transmission of the single - photon component in the low excitation limit .
the transmission of higher - photon number states remains largely intact , allowing us to observe in fig. 1c the strongest photon correlations to date in a solid - state system , reaching the range of strongly coupled atomic systems6 .
in the following , a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation of this effect , which can be seen as a purification of a single - photon nonlinearity , will be presented .
results device structure our device consists of self - assembled inas / gaas qds embedded in a micropillar fabry - perot cavity grown by molecular beam epitaxy25 ( see supplementary fig. 1 and supplementary note 1 ) .
the qd layer is embedded in a p - i - n junction , separated by a 35 nm - thick tunnel barrier from the electron reservoir , to enable tuning of the qd resonance frequency by the quantum - confined stark effect .
for transverse mode confinement and to achieve polarization degenerate cavity modes , we first ion - etch micropillars of large diameter ( 35 mum ) and slightly elliptical shape , then we use wet - chemical oxidation of an alas layer26 to prepare an intra - cavity lens for transverse - mode confinement27 , avoiding loss by surface scattering at the side walls .
finally , we fine - tune the cavity modes by laser induced surface defects2829 to obtain a polarization mode splitting much smaller than the cavity linewidth .
device parameters and theoretical model the system we study here is tuned to contain a single neutral qd within the cavity linewidth .
the excitonic fine - structure splitting leads to 4.8 ghz splitting between the orthogonally polarized qd transitions at 0degrees and 90degrees . the fundamental cavity modes show a residual polarization splitting of 4 ghz ( ghz , ghz ) and the cavity axes are rotated by 5degrees with respect to the qd axes .
to determine further system parameters , we model our qd cavity system by a two - polarization jc hamiltonian coupled to the incident coherent field and take care of cavity and qd dissipation by the quantum master equation formalism3031 .
we compare experiment and theory for six different input - output polarizer settings to faithfully determine the model parameters , these measurements were performed for an input power of 100 pw to avoid saturation effects32 .
we obtain ( see supplementary fig. 2 and supplementary note 2 ) a cavity decay rate kappa = 105 +/ - 3 ns - 1 , qd relaxation rate gamma ||= 1.0 +/ - 0.4 ns - 1 , qd pure dephasing gamma *= 0.6 +/ - 0.0 ns - 1 and qd cavity coupling rate g = 14 +/ - 0.1 ns - 1 ; from which we can calculate the device cooperativity . as 4g2 /( gamma2 + kappa2 )= 0.07 , our system operates in the weak - coupling bad - cavity regime of cavity qed .
resonant photon correlation spectroscopy we use a narrowband ( 100 khz ) laser to probe the system and study the transmitted light ( fig. 1a ) , as a function of laser frequency and postselection polarizer angle behind the cavity .
for each set of parameters , we measure the resonantly transmitted light intensity and its second - order photon correlation function g2 ( tau ) using a hanbury brown twiss setup .
the discrete nature of the qd levels leads to a strongly nonlinear response of the system depending on the incident photon number distribution ; we operate at low intensities to avoid saturation effects .
we show here only data for an incident polarization thetain = 45degrees , under which angle both qd transitions are equally excited .
first , we compare experimental and theoretical resonant transmission measurements in fig. 2 , where the coherent light transmittivity as a function of the laser detuning and orientation of the output polarizer angle thetaout is shown .
for clarity , we have normalized the traces for each polarization setting .
the horizontal lines indicate the qd fine structure split transitions , the black circles indicate regions of low transmission and the vertical dashed lines the special polarization angles , . from comparision of both panels in fig. 2 , we find excellent agreement between experiment and theory .
now we perform photon correlation measurements ; instead of tuning the laser , we now tune the qd , the reference are the cavity modes .
as the cavity linewidth is large compared with the qd tuning range in fig. 3 , there is nearly no difference compared with tuning the laser .
experimentally , using an external electric field to tune the qd via the quantum confined stark effect is much more robust than laser frequency tuning .
figure 3 shows the false - colour map of g2 ( 0 ) as function of output polarization thetaout and qd detuning .
we see clearly that the enhanced bunching occurs under the special polarization condition in the low - transmittivity regions indicated in fig. 2. this is expected as in weak coherent light beams , the p1 single - photon component is dominating and removal thereof should lead to enhanced bunching .
the theoretical simulation ( fig. 3b ) shows a maximal photon bunching of g2 ( 0 )=~ 40 .
compared with this , the experimentally observed photon correlations are less ( g2 ( 0 )=~ 6 ) , which is due to the detector response : fig. 3a was recorded with a 500 ps timing - jitter detector , if we repeat the measurement at the special polarization angle with a 50 ps timing - jitter detector ( the corresponding g2 ( tau ) measurements are compared in fig. 1c ) , we obtain g2 ( 0 )= 25.7 +/ - 0.9 .
both results agree very well to the convolution of the theoretically expected g2 ( tau ) with the detector responses ( fig. 1c ; see also supplementary fig. 3 and supplementary note 3 ) .
discussion we have shown by experiment and theory that the reduced fidelity of a qd nonlinearity , caused by imperfect qd - cavity coupling , can be strongly enhanced by pre - and post - selection of specific polarization states .
this enables transformation of a weak coherent input beam into highly bunched light with g2 ( 0 )>= 40 , a value that has not been reached before , not even in the strong coupling regime .
how is it possible to reach such high photon correlations , how does the polarization - based purification technique work ?
we consider incident light with a frequency in the vicinity of one of the qd resonances , say , and let us decompose the electromagnetic field transmitted through the cavity in two orthogonally polarized components : the signal field es polarized along the qd resonance polarization and the local oscillator elo , which has interacted with an empty cavity , because it is polarized orthogonally to . now , we consider three cases : ( i ) efficient interaction of the qd with incident light ( cooperativity c > 1 ) , ( ii ) intermediate interaction ( c =~ 1 ) and ( iii ) weak interaction ( c - - > 0 ) .
the special polarization angles for various cooperativities are shown in fig. 4. in case ( i ) , the qd leads to a nearly complete removal of the single - photon component from the incident coherent light polarized along the qd polarization : these photons are in principle perfectly reflected from the cavity and we simply have to detect along the same axis ( , see fig. 4 ) to observe strong photon correlations .
a significant proportion of higher photon number states are transmitted .
as the second - order correlation function can be expressed in terms of the photon number distribution as ( ignoring n > 2 photon number states ) , which for p2 << p1 and pn > 2 << p2 , this leads to diverging photon correlations such as if the single - photon component is attenuated as p1 - - > alphap1 .
now in case ( ii ) , for realistic systems , the finite lifetime of the qd transition and / or limited qd - cavity coupling g leads to a reduced cooperativity : even in the low - excitation limit , not every single - photon state is filtered out .
therefore , the signal field es contains a fraction of coherent light reducing the photon bunching along the qd polarization , compare fig. 3. this effect has been called ' self - homodyning ' in literature3334. with the purification technique , we now rotate the postselection polarizer to interfere a portion of the local oscillator field elo with the signal field , leading to the superimposed field 35 .
the polarizer angle controls the relative intensity of the two components and we can control the transmission phases phis and philo by adjusting the laser frequency , because the phases vary strongly in the vicinity of the qd and cavity resonances .
we simply have to choose the local oscillator intensity that it matches the intensity of the portion of es and adjust the phases for destructive interference .
the result is that we detect in transmission mainly the single - photon filtered portion of es , which leads to very high photon correlations in the transmitted light despite limited cooperativity .
finally , in case ( iii ) for c - - > 0 , only a vanishing fraction of the photons have interacted with the qd. we have to tune the postselection polarizer to - 45degrees to destructively interfere nearly equal amounts of es and elo to observe enhanced photon correlations .
this case is similar to that recently investigated in ref .
36 , where ( weak ) photon bunching is observed for a relative phase of pi ( phis - philo = pi ) .
we have a high - finesse ( f =~ 800 ) cavity and significant cooperativity , which enables us to observe much stronger photon correlations ( supplementary fig. 4 and supplementary note 4 ) .
the special postselection angle and laser frequency have to be optimized numerically in principle , because pure dephasing cannot be taken care of in a semiclassical model .
despite this , we found that the special polarization angle shows approximately a very simple dependency on the cooperativity : , see fig. 4 , which agrees well to our intuitive explanation here .
as a last point , we analyse the strong photon bunching in terms of the photon number distribution pn. we use our theoretical model to determine pn , as direct experimental determination thereof is strongly complicated by its sensitivity to loss .
however , also the simulation of narrow - band photon number fock input states is challenging in the quantum master model37 .
therefore , we use coherent input light and analyse the intra - cavity light in terms of its polarized photon number distribution , taking care of quantum interference at the postselection polarizer acting on the intra - cavity field .
this is an approximation , because imperfect transmission through the cavity reshapes pn. we found that the photon statistics pn can be calculated best by projection on the required fock states using polarization - rotated fock space ladder operators and tracing out the undesired polarization component afterwards. with the numerically31 calculated steady - state density matrix operator rho of our system ( supplementary note 2 ) , we obtain the photon number distribution after the polarizer : figure 5 shows the four lowest photon number probabilities as a function of the polarizer angle thetaout , for the case with and without qd. in the empty - cavity case we see , as expected , lowest transmission under the cross - polarization condition ( thetaout = - 45degrees ) .
for the case with the qd , we observe a photon - number - dependent shift of the transmission dip .
at the special polarization angle , we see that the one - photon component reaches a minimum , while the higher - photon number states do not , which explains the enhanced photon bunching enabled by the purification technique .
it is important to note that also the two - photon transmission dip ( p2 ) is not exactly at cross - polarization , which suggests the following intuitive explanation : apparently , in the photon number basis , the different fock states pick up a different phase during transmission through the qd cavity system .
in the weak - coupling regime , but often also in the strong coupling regime , the individual jc dressed states cannot be resolved spectrally , because g <= k. however , the cqed system is still photon - number sensitive , which implies lifetime - dependent jc effects in the weak coupling regime : the decay rate of the cqed system increases with the number of photons in the cavity2038 .
as consequence , higher photon - number states have a modified interaction cross - section and experience a reduced phase shift .
the dip in p2 in fig. 5 is already very close to the cross - polarization angle thetaout = - 45degrees , whereas the dips for higher photon number states pn > 2 are indistinguishable from thetaout = - 45degrees .
in conclusion , we found that the nonlinear response of a lossy cavity qd system can be strongly enhanced by postselection of a particular polarization state .
this leads to interference between fock states that experienced different modifications by the qd nonlinearity and results in strong photon correlations of the transmitted light .
as the underlying effect , interference of the two polarizations modes leads to high - fidelity cancellation of the single - photon transmission for the special polarization postselection condition. by correlating the results with a theoretical model , we found indications of photon - number sensitive jc physics in the weak coupling regime of cqed .

figure 4 special polarization and cooperativity .
black : numerically determined special polarization angle , where photon bunching in transmission is maximized , as a function of the cooperativity c , which in turn is modified by varying only the qd lifetime gamma || .
the green curve is given by the phenomenological expression - 45degreesexp ( - c ) : in the limit of high c , the qd alone can efficiently filter out single - photon states , leading to photon bunching .
however , for low cooperativity c , it is advantageous to mix the quantum - dot scattered light with a ' local oscillator ' provided by orthogonal polarization .
the error bars ( all s.d. ) are due to numerical errors in optimizating the laser frequency .
the red data point corresponds to the sample presented here ; the blue data corresponds to another device with lower cooperativity .
figure 5 photon number distributions .
calculated photon number distribution after the polarizer , with ( through curves ) and without ( dashed curves ) coupling to the qd in the cavity , the laser frequency is set to one of the qd resonances. with qd , we clearly see the photon - number - dependent shift of the transmission dip .
only the photon number distribution of the detected polarization component is shown ; therefore , the total number of photons in case with qd can exceed the case without qd due to polarization conversion by the dot .
for clarity , pure dephasing has been neglected here , making the special polarization angle different from the other simulations and experimental results .

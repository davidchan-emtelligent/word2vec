background we applied a range of genome - wide association ( gwa ) methods to map quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) in the simulated dataset provided by the 12th qtlmas workshop in order to derive an effective strategy .
results a variance component linkage analysis revealed qtls but with low resolution .
three single - marker based gwa methods were then applied : transmission disequilibrium test and single marker regression , fitting an additive model or a genotype model , on phenotypes pre - corrected for pedigree and fixed effects .
these methods detected qtl positions with high concordance to each other and with greater refinement of the linkage signals .
further multiple - marker and haplotype analyses confirmed the results with higher significance .
two - locus interaction analysis detected two epistatic pairs of markers that were not significant by marginal effects .
overall , using stringent bonferroni thresholds we identified 9 additive qtl and 2 epistatic interactions , which together explained about 12.3 % of the corrected phenotypic variance .
conclusion the combination of methods that are robust against population stratification , like qtdt , with flexible linear models that take account of the family structure provided consistent results .
extensive simulations are still required to determine appropriate thresholds for more advanced model including epistasis .
15 - 16 may 200812th european workshop on qtl mapping and marker assisted selectionuppsala , sweden background with recent advances in genotyping technology , high density marker maps are becoming commonly used to map the genetic loci controlling complex trait variation .
most large - scale genome - wide association ( gwa ) studies published to date , such as those conducted by the wellcome trust case control consortium [ 1 ] , used case - control designs with individuals selected to be unrelated .
new methods such as grammar [ 2 ] allow effective and robust gwa studies on general pedigreed populations like the simulated data provided by the 12th qtl - mas workshop . here we describe a comprehensive set of gwa analyses to detect quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) in the simulated population in order to compare the commonly used methods of linkage , transmission disequilibrium test ( tdt ) , and single marker association with more experimental models including multiple marker and haplotype associations and epistasis .
based on the comparisons we aim to derive a generic strategy for gwa studies on general pedigreed populations .
methods the simulated population consists of 4665 individuals across four generations. from the first generation , 15 sires , each mated 10 dams that produced 10 progeny per full - sib family .
each individual was phenotyped for one continuous trait and genotyped with 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) markers without missing values .
the snp data were phased and treated as evenly spaced across six 100 cm chromosomes .
haploview [ 3 ] was used to estimate minor allele frequencies ( maf ) and linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) within a 20 marker window .
we also estimated descriptive statistics including the total variance and heritability and examined for normality .
eighty four snps with maf below 0.1 % were excluded from further analyses .
the lod score of 3 , equivalent to the p - value of 2 * 10 - 4 , was used as the threshold for linkage analyses .
for all single - qtl association studies , bonferroni correction of 5916 tests was used to derive the 5 % genome - wide threshold resulting in the nominal p - value of 8.45 * 10 - 6 , or 5.08 in the - log10 ( p ) transformation ( logp ). that threshold was used consistently across the gwa analyses in this study to detect markers that significant by their marginal effects ( denoted as qsnp ) .
although the bonferroni correction is known for being too conservative , it is easily implemented and much less computer - intensive than permutation tests .
furthermore , the resulting p - value threshold is in line with many published gwa studies .
figure 1 shows the analysis framework used in this study ; the methods are described in the following sections .
figure 1 a flow diagram of the methods used .
qtl analyses based on transmission of alleles within full - sib families the pedigree was divided into 450 nuclear families .
at first , a variance components linkage analysis [ 4 ] was used to evaluate the significance of the additive genetic variance component .
then , we performed genome - wide association using two methods implemented in the software qtdt [ 5 ] .
these methods model the allelic means for a test of association having accounted for the sib - pair covariance structure .
the first method is the de facto qtdt , where the allelic association is evaluated within the nuclear families only .
using the within - family component solely in evaluating the allelic association is robust to admixture in the population .
secondly , without partitioning the mean effect of a locus into the between - and within - family components , testing of the total association was also carried out .
such a test is not a tdt , although it is implemented in the qtdt software , and it is a less conservative test compared to qtdt when population stratification can be ignored .
single snp grammar the first stage of grammar [ 2 ] was adopted to correct the phenotype for pedigree and fixed effects using asreml [ 6 ] .
the mixed model fitted a random effect of pedigree and fixed effects of sex and generation .
the residuals obtained for each individual were used as the corrected trait in the gwa analyses below .
the single marker association was modelled in two ways : fitting the additive allelic effect as a covariate or the genotype classes as fixed factors where both additive and dominance effects can be estimated .
multiple - markers and haplotype analysis using the pre - corrected phenotypic values , we evaluated the joint effect of multiple snps within a three marker sliding window .
markers were fitted as individual linear covariates within a multiple regression framework to test for their joint association .
using the same sliding window method haplotypes were estimated from 3 adjacent snps with the software " haplo.stats " in r [ 7 ] .
a progressive insertion em algorithm determines haplotype frequencies which are then used to test for association with a score statistic [ 8 ] .
a three marker window was chosen to reduce computational time for the haplotype method and applied to both analyses for consistency .
further work is required to investigate the effect of alternative marker window sizes on power to detect qtl .
two - locus interaction analysis a four - stage approach was used to analyse epistasis based on the pre - corrected phenotypes where snp genotypes were fitted as fixed factors : 1 ) single snp regression to identify qsnps ( see above ) ; 2 ) detect qsnp x qsnp pairs [ 9 ] ; 3 ) detect qsnp x non - qsnp pairs ; 4 ) detect non - qsnp x non - qsnp pairs .
nested tests were used to identify significant epistatic pairs ; the first test compares the full model ( y = mu + snp1 + snp2 + snp1 * snp2 + e ) with the null model ( y = mu + e ) ; the second test compares the full model with the two - snp model ( y = mu + snp1 + snp2 + e ) ( i.e. epistasis test ) .
only pairs that were significant for the first test enter the epistasis test .
when either snp1 or snp2 is a qsnp , the first test is changed to ensure the full model is better than the single snp model ( y = mu + qsnp + e ) before the epistasis test .
when both snp1 and snp2 are qsnps , only the epistasis test is needed .
to avoid spurious interactions between closely located snps an arbitrary minimum distance of 10 cm was applied to any interacting snp pairs .
the 5 % genome wide thresholds were derived for the nested tests using bonferroni correction based on the number of tests ( assuming independent tests ) .
suppose k qsnps are identified from n available snps in stage one , the number of the first tests is in the order of n2 , k * n and k2 for the non - qsnp x non - qsnp , qsnp x non - qsnp and qsnp x qsnp pairs , respectively .
the number of pairs that are significant for the first test is used to derive the 5 % genome wide threshold for the epistasis tests .
results integration forward linear regression was used to integrate the mapping results in the order of a ) qsnp x qsnp pairs ; b ) qsnp x non - qsnp pairs ; c ) non - qsnp x non - qsnp pairs and d ) qsnps using their corresponding thresholds .
the epistatic pairs were fitted first because they also capture the marginal effects of the qsnps that were involved in these pairs .
qtl ( pairs ) were included in the model in order of decreasing significance .
qtl or qtl pairs were dropped when their individual p value was smaller than their corresponding threshold .
results and discussion descriptive statistics the uncorrected trait data was approximately normally distributed using a q - q plot .
it ranged from - 5.36 to 8.67 , with mean and standard deviation of 1.36 and 2.10 respectively .
no differences in the distribution were observed due to sex .
the estimated heritability was 29.6 % .
the ld between adjacent snp pairs was generally low ; the mean r2 between adjacent markers was 0.2 and decreased linearly with map distance .
however , much higher ld was observed when looking at all pairwise r2 values within a 20 marker window - the mean maximum r2 between two snps was 0.62 .
linkage and association tests using qtdt linkage analysis revealed strong evidence of qtl on chromosomes 4 and 5 ( figure 2a ) .
tests for within - family association pointed to qtl locations on chromosomes 1 - 5 in total 194 snps were significant .
since we have observed high ld between non - adjacent snps , we were concerned that multiple snps could be called significant simply due to ld. as a conservative measure , we grouped the significant snps into 9 qtl peaks .
these peaks were defined as the most significant marker and its neighbouring significant snps being at least 10 cm from the next group of significant snps .
although the tests for total association gave more significant p - values ( results not shown ) , the results of the qtdt tests for within - family association are considered more robust .
the reason is that the way the nuclear families were created from the entire pedigree would have introduced some degree of population substructure .
testing for total association ignores the fact that some individuals sired multiple families and thus , the nuclear families are not independent .

( b ) the association results produced by the single marker additive model using grammar .
- log10 transformed p values are given for each marker position .
the genome - wide significance threshold ( p < 0.05 ) is shown with the red line .
single - marker association using grammar the additive single snp analysis identified 9 qtl peaks by visual inspection ( figure 2b ) .
in total 133 individual markers were above the bonferroni corrected significance threshold .
the genotypic model identified the same 9 qtl peaks but with a total of 108 significant snps .
compared to the linkage results , gwa detected more significant snp signals on chromosomes 1 - 3 and was consequently deemed more powerful .
because the single - marker grammar identified the same peaks as qtdt , we concluded that the benefit of the robustness to admixture of qtdt is negligible in the current dataset .
grammar is more flexible for modelling epistasis and performing the joint analysis .
therefore , grammar was chosen over qtdt for the subsequent analyses that follow .
multiple - marker and haplotype association the multiple marker analysis identified a total of 9 qtl peaks in the same locations as those identified by the single - marker analyses .
overall , the multiple marker method identified a total of 320 individual significant snps .
the haplotype analysis identified the same 9 qtl peaks as the multiple - marker method with a total of 338 significant snps .
two - locus interaction the 108 qsnps identified in stage one were used for epistasis analyses .
the thresholds for the epistatic analyses were as follows : for the 108 qsnps , the logp threshold for their pair - wise analyses was 5.08 .
for the interaction between qsnps and non - qsnps the logp threshold was 7.01 against the h0 of only a single qsnp effect .
following this test , 3040 pairs were significant and the bonferroni corrected logp threshold for the epistasis test was 4.78 .
for the pairwise analysis of non - qsnp pairs the logp threshold against h0 of no qtl effect was 8.51 .
following this test , 99634 pairs were significant and the bonferroni correct logp threshold for the epsitais test was 6.3 .
two significant non - qsnp x non - qsnp pairs were detected : 1 ) snps 540 and 3219 on chromosomes 1 and 4 , respectively ; 2 ) snps 1257 and 3689 on chromosomes 2 and 4 respectively .
it was interesting that the adjacent snps of 1257 ( i.e. 1256 and 1258 ) were both qsnps with an r2 of 0.75 whereas the ld between 1257 and 1256 ( 0.26 ) or 1258 ( 0.46 ) was much lower .
no significant interactions with any of the 108 qsnps were found .
result integration and overall discussion the 108 qsnps and the two epistatic pairs were integrated using the forward selection regression method to remove possible redundancy among those snps .
the two epistatic pairs and 9 qsnps remained significant in the final model and jointly explained 12.3 % of the phenotypic variance ( table 1 ) .
each of the 9 qsnps was the most significant marker of the corresponding qtl peak shown in figure 2b .
the focus of our study was the detection of loci rather than the precise estimation of their effects .
previous work [ 2 ] has shown that grammar correction is effective at controlling type i error with little loss of power , but leads to underestimation of effects .
hence the full procedure requires the re - estimation of effects in a full mixed model .
the latter was not performed in this study and so considering the use of grammar corrected trait , our results may have identified a considerable proportion of the actual phenotypic variance .
the results from the three single - marker methods had high concordance ( figure 3 ) , which suggested the final results to be fairly robust .
some difference in power of detection was found ( figure 4 ) .
however , in spite of the expectation that qtdt being more conservative , it does not seem to suffer from loss of power when many large full - sib families are available .
qtdt may have the advantage of added protection against bias due to the unknown relatedness amongst the founders .
on the other hand , qtdt is unable to handle the half - sib relationships that grammar can .
therefore , a combination of these approaches would compensate the shortcomings in each of the individual methods .
in this case , they yielded very similar results .
thus , we favour the grammar method for its speed and flexibility .

there is an increase in power for the methods using multiple markers over single marker grammar methods .

g : estimated allelic effect from the single snp grammar model ; the simulated value is taken from the nearest simulated qtl as provided by the organisers .
bonferroni derived threshold adjust for the number of tests , but assume they are independent .
as markers are correlated these thresholds will be too stringent and this will be particularly the case when dealing with pairs of correlated markers as is done in epistatic analyses .
to explore to potential effects of this we relaxed each of the thresholds used in stages 2 to 4 of the epistatic analyses by 1 log p ( equivalent to 10 - fold fewer independent tests ) and re - tested the interactions following the same algorithm .
in addition to the two pairs detected , we listed 7 new pairs : 2 qsnp - qsnp ( 1271 & 4928 , 1483 & 4942 ) , 2 qsnp x non - qsnp ( 331 & 591 , 991 & 3048 ) and 3 non - qsnp x non - qsnp ( 319 & 840 , 1221 & 4555 , 1564 & 3121 ) .
after integration with the 108 qsnps , all pairs and 6 remaining qsnps jointly explained about 15 % of the phenotypic variance .
further effort is required to determine the appropriate thresholds for use in gwa epistasis analyses .
using the ecdf computing facility , which is approximately three times faster compared to a standard desktop , the merlin step of the qtdt software took 2 hours per chromosome while the actual qtdt analyses took about 4 hours per chromosome .
a ' genome scan ' using the single snp grammar method took only 6 minutes on a standard desktop pc. using the same machine , the 3 - marker window analyses took 16 minutes , while the 3 - marker haplotypes analyses took approximately 1 hour .
the epistatic analyses for n snps require ( n - 1 )*( n / 2 ) calculations with additional terms to be estimated .
these analyses ran for several days using a background queue at the ecdf facility therefore no reliable estimate of calculation time was available .
conclusion using several methods in analysing gwa can be useful in gaining confidence on the qtl identified .
grammar is much faster to run than qtdt and takes into account complex relationships existing in general pedigrees .
furthermore , extending the model in grammar to study epistasis is reasonably easy and computationally feasible by using parallel or grid computing .
epilogue following presentation of the simulation design , our strategy turned out to be effective and correctly detected 5 out of 6 major qtls as well as 4 out of 45 smaller qtls , despite the conservative thresholds employed in this study .
the estimates of the genotypic qtl effects in the joint model ( after stepwise regression ) appear small compared to the simulated values .
however , the estimates of the allelic qtl effects from the additive single marker grammar analyses compare quite well to the simulated values ( table 1 ) .
it seems that the joint fitting of the qtl reduces their estimates by > 50 % .
it was previously shown that the grammar approach leads to reduced estimates of the qtl effect [ 2 ] but that study did not account for the upward bias usually observed as a result of the ' beavis effect ' .
under a grammar approach it was recommended to re - estimate significant effect on the basis of the raw data using raw data and including a polygenic effect [ 2 ] , which was not done in the present study .
only the present study modelled epistatic interaction between snps .
because no epistasis was actually simulated our results represent spurious effects .
overall , the strategy worked well but extensive simulations are required to derive appropriate thresholds , especially for detecting epistatic interactions .

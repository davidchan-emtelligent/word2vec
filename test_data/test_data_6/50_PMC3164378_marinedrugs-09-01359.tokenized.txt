in this study , we elucidated the inhibitory effect of fucoidan from marine brown algae on the lipid accumulation in differentiated 3t3 - l1 adipocytes and its mechanism .
the treatment of fucoidan in a dose - dependent manner was examined on lipid inhibition in 3t3 - l1 cells by using oil red o staining .
fucoidan showed high lipid inhibition activity at 200 mug / ml concentration ( p < 0.001 ) .
lipolytic activity in adipocytes is highly dependent on hormone sensitive lipase ( hsl ) , which is one of the most important targets of lipolytic regulation .
here , we examined the biological response of fucoidan on the protein level of lipolysis pathway .
the expressed protein levels of total hormone sensitive lipase ( hsl ) and its activated form , phosphorylated - hsl were significantly increased at concentration of 200 mug / ml fucoidan .
furthermore , insulin - induced 2 - deoxy - d - [ 3h ] glucose uptake was decreased up to 51 % in fucoidan - treated cells as compared to control .
since increase of hsl and p - hsl expression and decrease of glucose uptake into adipocytes are known to lead to stimulation of lipolysis , our results suggest that fucoidan reduces lipid accumulation by stimulating lipolysis .
therefore , these results suggest that fucoidan can be useful for the prevention or treatment of obesity due to its stimulatory lipolysis .
marine brown algae lipid inhibition lipolysis hormone sensitive lipase 1 .
introduction obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure .
it has become a major obstacle of improving human health and life quality due to the known risk factors for many chronic diseases .
it is characterized by hyperplasia and hypertrophy , and is regarded as a major factor for cardio - metabolic disturbances such as hypertension , atherosclerosis , type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia [ 1 - 3 ] .
in general , obesity is associated with the extent of adipocyte differentiation , intracellular lipid accumulation and lipolysis [ 4,5 ] .
marine brown algae have long made up a key part of the asian diet and are also consumed in other parts of the world .
it has often been used as a food for people who are sick and has been credited with health - giving properties .
today , marine brown algae supplements for human use are usually considered to be sources of therapeutic benefits [ 6 ] .
especially , fucoidan is a sulfated fucose containing polysaccharide extracted from marine brown algae [ 7 ] .
during the past years , fucoidan extracted from various species has been recognized to possess biological properties ; anti - coagulant , anti - thrombotic , anti - tumor , anti - inflammatory and anti - virus activities [ 8 ] .
the anti - coagulant activity of sulfated polysaccharide from fucus evanescens was similar to that of heparin .
anti - coagulant properties of fucoidan are determined by thrombin inhibition mediated via plasma antithrombin iii [ 9 ] .
fucoidan from mekabu , a dietary alga , exerts anti - tumor activity possibly through enhancing the th1 cell and nk cell responses [ 10 ] .
fucoidan , a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from an edible brown alga undaria pinnatifida , was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the in vitro replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) [ 11 - 13 ] .
recently , there has been increasing interest in potential biological activity against fat inhibition from fucoidan , which is an adipogenic reduction of fucoidan - declined lipid accumulation in adipocytes .
fucoidan can be used for inhibiting fat accumulation , which is mediated by decreasing ap2 , acc , and ppargamma gene expression [ 14 ] .
fucoidan treatment inhibits adipocyte differentiation , evidenced by decreased lipid accumulation and down regulation of adipocyte markers via mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways .
as of yet , however , no study has clearly investigated the inhibitory effects of fucoidan on lipid accumulation through the regulation of lipolysis .
lipolysis is a prerequisite for lipid accumulation via the regulation of hormone sensitive lipase ( hsl ) as a rate limiting enzyme , which is the hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids .
in this study , we examined whether fucoidan from fucus vesisulosus inhibits lipid accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes via the stimulation of lipolysis .
first , we quantified the accumulation of lipid droplets in 3t3 - l1 cells in a dose - dependent manner using oil red o staining .
second , we showed the stimulatory effect of fucoidan on the protein expression of hsl and its activated form , p - hsl by western blotting assay , which function as the key rate - limiting enzyme on lipolysis .
furthermore , we examined insulin - induced glucose uptake into 3t3 - l1 adipocytes as a measure of lipolytic effect of fucoidan .
finally , we confirmed inhibitory effect of fucoidan on triglyceride accumulation in 3t3 - l1 cells .
as a result , we demonstrated that fucoidan may reduce lipid accumulation through the stimulation of lipolysis and may be a candidate for an anti - obesity agent .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
cell viability and lipid inhibitory effect of fucoidan on 3t3 - l1 adipocyte differentiation we first examined whether fucoidan has an influence on cell viability of 3t3 adipocytes using a cck - 8 assay .
fucoidan did not have toxicity at concentrations in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 1 ) .
the inhibitory effect of fucoidan on differentiation of 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes was then examined by oil red o staining .
the microscopic inspection of fucoidan - treated adipocytes after oil red o staining revealed a significant reduction in the lipid droplets and accumulation of intracellular lipid ( figure 2a ) .
the lipid accumulation was decreased by 16.5 % ( p < 0.05 ) at 100 mug / ml and 52.2 % ( p < 0.001 ) at 200 mug / ml of fucoidan , respectively ( figure 2b ) .
triglyceride assay was performed that fucoidan could inhibit triglyceride accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( figure 3 ) .
fucoidan exhibited 86 % decrease in triglyceride accumulation compared to the control .
therefore , fucoidan showed anti - adipogenic properties as evidenced by decreased lipid and triglyceride accumulation in 3t3 - l1 cells .
2.2 .
expression level of lipolytic gene lipolytic activity in adipocytes is highly dependent on hormone sensitive lipase ( hsl ) , which is one of the most important targets of lipolytic regulation .
the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of hsl result in an increase of the hydrolysis of stored triacylglycerol into mono - acylglycerol and free fatty acids [ 15 - 17 ] .
to evaluate the effect of fucoidan on the regulation of lipolysis , we investigated the protein level of hsl and phosphorylated hsl ( p - hsl ) by western blotting analysis .
in fully differentiated 3t3 - l1 adipocytes , fucoidan treatment at 200 mug / ml increased hsl and p - hsl level by approximately 1.47 and 1.59 times as compared to the controls ( figures 4a,b ) .
kim group reported that the treatment of gensonosides or egcg prevented obesity via the up - regulated expression of hsl mrna [ 18 ] .
cha group showed that methanol extract from luffa cylindrical ( lcm ) stimulates the lipolysis through the induction of hsl resulting in the reduced lipid accumulation [ 19 ] .
therefore , our results suggest that fucoidan may induce lipolysis by increasing the protein levels of hsl and p - hsl .
2.3 .
inhibitory effect of fucoidan on insulin - induced glucose uptake the inhibitory activity of fucoidan on glucose uptake in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes was assessed by using 2 - deoxy - d - [ 3h ] glucose uptake quantitative assay ( figure 5 ) .
in the absence of insulin , fucoidan had no significant effect .
however , it demonstrated its inhibitory effect on glucose uptake .
the glucose uptake was greatly enhanced in the presence of 10 mug / ml insulin .
insulin , which is a central hormone to regulate fat metabolism in the body , causes cells in adipocytes tissue to take up glucose from the blood , stimulating glucose utilization by its anti - lipolytic effect on adipose tissue [ 20 ] .
however , the insulin - induced glucose uptake was decreased by fucoidan at 200 mug / ml ( 51 % decreases ) and cytochalasin b , which is a positive control for glucose uptake inhibition .
therefore , our results further present that fucoidan inhibits lipid accumulation by decreasing glucose uptake .
in summary , the findings of this study clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effect of fucoidan extracted from fucus vesisulosus on lipid accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes via stimulatory lipolysis .
the stimulation of lipolysis was mediated by increasing the protein expression of hsl and p - hsl , which are essential regulation factors for lipolysis , and by decreasing glucose uptake into 3t3 - l1 adipocytes .
therefore , we suggest that fucoidan is a promising candidate for an anti - obesity agent by blocking lipid accumulation and stimulating lipolysis .

the samples were and blocked with 5 % skim milk in tbs with 0.1 % triton x - 100 ( tbs - t ) for 120 min at room temperature .
the membranes were then incubated overnight with anti - hsl and anti - phospho - hsl antibodies ( 1:1000 dilution , cell signaling ) in tbs - t at 4 degreesc .
after incubation with horseradish peroxidase , anti - rabbit igg antibody ( 1:2500 , cell signaling ) was conjugated for 1 h at room temperature .
for normalization , the membranes were reprobed with antibodies against beta - actin ( 1:5000 dilution , santa cruz biotechnology ) .
several exposure times were used to obtain the signals in the linear range .
3.5 .

3t3 - l1 cells plated in a 24 well plate were washed three times with pbs and incubated in 1 ml / well warm pbs containing 10 mug / ml insulin for 30 min at 37 degreesc .
after washing twice in pbs , the cells were incubated in 1ml low glucose dmem containing cytochalasin b or fucoidan and 2 - deoxy - d - [ 3h ] glucose .
after 30 min , glucose uptake was terminated by washing the cells three times with cold pbs .

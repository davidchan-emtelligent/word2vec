however , teaching and evaluation methods seem to be inconsistent between countries , institutions and programs .
this may be the consequence of uncertainty regarding the most effective method of teaching such skills .
a review of available literature pertaining to psychomotor teaching across a range of health professions was undertaken .
as a result of this broad review we present the available evidence and make recommendations pertaining to the teaching of psychomotor skills within the podiatry profession and relate it to current methods .
traditional methods of teaching providing explicit content and appropriate demonstration are still useful .
learning may be promoted in a closed environment on low fidelity models with clear and immediate feedback .
further practice can occur over time ( intermittent practice ) with possible use of mental practice in between .
the task can gradually increase in complexity such as moving from a model to work in a clinical setting such as a university clinic on real patients , as appropriate .
further detail regarding these methods will be provided .
this review will support some current practices in clinical teaching and make further recommendations with respect to current evidence .

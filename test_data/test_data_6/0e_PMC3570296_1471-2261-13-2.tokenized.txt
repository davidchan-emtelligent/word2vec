background carbonic anhydrase enzymes ( ca ) catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate in mammalian cells .
trans - membrane transport of ca - produced bicarbonate contributes significantly to cellular ph regulation .
a body of evidence implicates ph - regulatory processes in the hypertrophic growth pathway characteristic of hearts as they fail .
in particular , na +/ h + exchange ( nhe ) activation is pro - hypertrophic and ca activity activates nhe .
recently cardrase ( 6 - ethoxyzolamide ) , a ca inhibitor , was found to prevent and revert agonist - stimulated cardiac hypertrophy ( ch ) in cultured cardiomyocytes .
our goal thus was to determine whether hypertrophied human hearts have altered expression of ca isoforms .
methods we measured ca expression in hypertrophied human hearts to begin to examine the role of carbonic anhydrase in progression of human heart failure .
ventricular biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery ( cs , n = 14 ) , or heart transplantation ( ht , n = 13 ) .
cs patients presented mild / moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal right ventricles , with preserved ventricular function ; ejection fractions were ~ 60 % .
conversely , ht patients with failing hearts presented ch or ventricular dilation accompanied by ventricular dysfunction and ef values of 20 % .
non - hypertrophic , non - dilated ventricular samples served as controls .
results expression of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide ( anp and bnp ) were markers of ch. hypertrophic ventricles presented increased expression of caii , caiv , anp , and bnp , mrna levels , which increased in failing hearts , measured by quantitative real - time pcr .
caii , caiv , and anp protein expression also increased approximately two - fold in hypertrophic / dilated ventricles .
conclusions these results , combined with in vitro data that ca inhibition prevents and reverts ch , suggest that increased carbonic anhydrase expression is a prognostic molecular marker of cardiac hypertrophy .
heart failure carbonic anhydrase ph regulation gene expression heart transplant cardiac hypertrophy background heart failure places an increasingly heavy disease burden on populations world - wide , leading to a need to understand basic mechanisms underlying the disease [ 1 ] .
identification of basic mechanisms that promote the downward cascade of heart failure holds the promise to develop targeted new therapeutic strategies .
altered ion homeostasis contributes to hypertrophic heart growth , which impairs the heart 's ability to pump effectively and commonly progresses to heart failure .
cardiac na +/ h + exchanger 1 ( nhe1 ) is central to maintenance of intracellular ph. indeed , experimental and clinical studies demonstrated the pathophysiological implications of increased nhe1 activity during an ischemic episode and in hypertrophy [ 2 - 4 ] .
nhe1 activity is detrimental to the myocardium as a result of increased intracellular na + load , leading to elevated intracellular ca2 + through the action of na +/ ca2 + exchanger , ncx1 .
in some studies , increased cardiac expression of nhe1 protein appears to be involved in the subsequent pathological changes [ 5 ] .
in human heart failure , however , enhanced nhe1 activity is not correlated with increased nhe1 expression , suggesting a role for activation by post - translational mechanisms [ 6 ] .
sustained nhe1 activity requires an acidifying pathway , such as cl - / hco3 - exchange mediated by ae3 , since nhe activity alkalinizes the cell , resulting in self inactivation through a cytosolic modifier site [ 7,8 ] .
hyperactivation of nhe1 and ae3 exchanger are associated with hypertrophic heart growth , in a model of spontaneously hypertensive rats [ 9 ] .
maximal activity of ae3 and nhe1 require the catalytic activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase ( ca ) , which provides the hco3 - and h + substrate for the two transporters [ 10 - 12 ] .
treatment of cultured rat cardiomyocytes with the ca inhibitor , ethoxyzolamide ( cardrase ) , prevented hormonally - induced hypertrophy and reversed it once established [ 13 ] .
etz also normalized spontaneous ca ++ transients induced by pro - hypertrophic hormones , indicating that ca has a role in the elevated ca ++ found in the hypertrophic heart [ 13 ] .
the identity of the ca isoform responsible for the anti - hypertrophic effects was not established in the earlier work .
together , ca inhibition , a therapy previously used for diuresis targeting hypertension and heart failure [ 14 ] , may be an effective therapeutic approach towards mitigation of the heart disease .
beneficial effects of nhe inhibition in the failing heart have been suggested on the basis of cellular signalling mechanisms and experimental studies [ 5,15 ] .
here we examined the expression of the ca isoforms , caii and caiv , in normal , hypertrophic and failing human hearts .
our data lead to the conclusion that increased ca expression is a marker of hypertrophic heart , which progresses towards failure , and suggests that ca inhibition is a point to intervene in the hypertrophic cascade .
limiting substrate availability for nhe1 and ae3 intracellular ph regulatory mechanisms by inhibition of ca will impair the signals that trigger the hypertrophic heart growth .
methods human ethics and heart sample collection the study was approved the human research ethics board , faculty of medicine and dentistry , university of alberta and all patients gave written informed consent .
to avoid possible disease - specific confounding factors , only samples from patients with early - stage hypertrophy ( aortic stenosis , valve replacement or coronary artery by - pass surgery ) were used .
end - stage failing hearts ( severe cardiomyopathy , heart transplantation ) , were biopsied following explantation associated with cardiac transplant surgery .
samples were collected from right or left free ventricular wall as indicated .
endomyocardial biopsy samples ( embs ) , from patients who were referred to the university of alberta hospital for evaluation of cardiomyopathy , were collected by needle biopsy ( average diameter 3 mm ) , and immediately placed into microcentrifuge tubes containing 4degreesc rnalater ( r ) ( qiagen , canada ) for storage .
rna isolation and cdna synthesis rna was isolated from human heart ventricles and human brain cortex ( from cooperative human tissue network ( http :// www.chtn.nci.nih.gov /)) , and used as a control ) with rneasy micro kit ( qiagen , canada ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
isolated rna was treated with dnase i ( 2 u / ng of rna ; qiagen ) at 22degreesc , 15 min .
rna integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
cdna synthesis was carried out with superscript iii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , life technologies ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cdna sequences were obtained from the genbank sequence database of the national centre for biotechnology information ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /) .
primers were designed with the oligo software of the dna star program ( http :// frodo.wi.mit.edu / cgi - bin / primer3 / primer3.cgi ) .
in conventional rt - pcr , all primers generated only one amplification band visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis .
sequences for all pcr primers are presented in additional file 1 : table s1 .
real - time qpcr real - time reverse transcription pcr - real time pcr was performed with corbett rotor - gene 3000 real time analyser ( corbett life science , australia ) .
real time pcr reaction contained 25 mul with 12.5 mul of 2x platinum ( r ) sybr ( r ) green qpcr supermix - udg ( invitrogen ) , 5 pmol / primer and 5 mul of template and cdna prepared from 100 ng total rna .
cycle threshold values ( ct ) were obtained for caii , caiv , caxiv , anp , bnp , and gapdh .
gapdh , assumed not to vary between samples , was used to normalize for differences in the efficiency of mrna isolation from the samples as follows .
ct values were corrected for each sample by addition or subtraction of cycles so that gapdh ct values were the same .
protein analysis explanted heart samples were rapidly placed in rnalater ( r ) and stored at 4degreesc .
tissue was disrupted in pbs buffer ( 140 mm nacl , 3 mm kcl , 6.5 mm na2hpo4 , 1.5 mm kh2po4 , ph 7.5 ) , containing protease inhibitors ( pi , minicomplete tablet , roche ) .
after disruption , ventricular lysates were prepared by addition of sds - page sample buffer , heated at 70degreesc , 3 min , and centrifuged 10 min at 16,110 x g. protein expression and tissue culture expression constructs of human caii , rabbit caiv , and mouse caxiv , have been described previously [ 16 - 18 ] .
hek293 cells were individually transfected with empty vector ( pcdna3 ) , caii , caiv , or caxiv , cdnas [ 17 ] .
cells were grown at 37degreesc in an air / co2 ( 19:1 ) environment in dmem , with 5 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum and 5 % ( v / v ) calf serum .
two days post - transfection , hek293 cells were washed in pbs buffer and cell lysates were prepared by addition of 150 mul sds - page sample buffer to each 60 mm tissue culture dish .
protein samples were transferred to pvdf membranes and then incubated with rabbit anti - human caii ( rabbit polyclonal h - 70 , santa cruz , ca ; 1:1000 dilution ) , goat anti - caiv antibody ( goat polyclonal n - 16 ; santa cruz biotechnology ; 1:500 ) , goat anti - caxiv antibody ( goat polyclonal n19 , santa cruz biotechnology ; 1:1000 ) , goat anti - atrial natriuretic factor antibody ( goat polyclonal n - 20 ; santa cruz biotechnology ; 1:200 ) , or rabbit anti - alpha - actinin antibody ( rabbit polyclonal h - 300 , santa cruz , ca , usa ; 1:500 ) .
immunoblots were then incubated with donkey anti - rabbit igg conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) , mouse anti - goat igg conjugated to hrp , or sheep anti - mouse igg conjugated to hrp ( ge healthcare , little chalfont , uk ; 1:2000 ) , as appropriate .
blots were visualized and quantified using ecl reagent and a kodak image station .
isolation and culture of cardiomyocytes adult mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital , 150 mg / kg i.p. animal protocols were approved by the university of alberta animal policy and welfare committee and performed in accordance with canadian council on animal care guidelines .
hearts were excised , and ventricular myocytes obtained by enzymatic dissociation [ 13 ] .
statistics data are expressed as mean +/ - sem .
student paired t - test or one - way anova followed by neuwman - keuls multiple comparison post - test analysis , when appropriate , were used to compare data .
p < 0.05 was considered of statistical significance .
results patient cohort clinical conditions of two patient cohorts are summarized .
patients undergoing cardiac interventions had good prognosis and good cardiac contractility measured by left ventricular ejection fraction values of 59 +/ - 3 % ( n = 14 , additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
hearts from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation had poor contractility , left ventricular ejection fraction values of 20 +/ - 2 % , and subjected to cardiac transplantation ( n = 13 , additional file 3 : table s3 ) .
patients with prevalence of aortic stenosis ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) , presented heart disease with left ventricular remodeling , including mild to moderate left ventricular concentric hypertrophy , non - hypertrophic right ventricles , and non - left ventricular dysfunction ( stage b of heart failure ) .
conversely , patients with cardiomyopathies ( additional file 3 : table s3 ) presented ventricular dilation and severely symptomatic heart failure ( stage d of heart failure ) .
hearts were classified according to established criteria [ 19 ] .
importantly , there was no significant difference in age between the two groups .
the overall population with aortic stenosis presented at an average age of 61 +/ - 4 years , with overrepresentation of males ( 86 %) , whereas patients with dilated cardiomyopathies presented at an average age of 51 +/ - 4 years , and were also overrepresented by males ( 69 %) .
analysis of gene expression in human heart biopsies we examined whether the mrna and protein expression of carbonic anhydrase genes are altered by cardiac hypertrophy .
we analyzed samples derived from single endomyocardial biopsies ( emb ) , and ventricular slices , respectively , from 27 human samples .
an average of 1 mg of total rna , isolated from each emb , was subjected to reverse transcription and quantification of transcript abundance by real - time pcr .
to verify the specificity of the real - time rt - pcr data , we performed rt - pcr using the designed pair primers ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) and resolved the products on 1 % agarose - ethidium bromide gels .
a single band was found for caii , caiv , caxiv , atrial natriuretic peptide ( anp ) , and brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) transcripts , using either brain cortex , or human heart ventricle rna ( figure 1a ) .
a weak band was detected for bnp in brain cortex , suggesting low expression in this tissue .
the presence of a single band in each case indicates the specificity of amplification , so that quantitative real - time pcr data reports levels of a single species .
figure 1 carbonic anhydrase mrna in human hearts .
mrna , isolated from adult human heart ventricles , or human brain cortex was reverse transcribed , and the resulting cdna was used as template for pcr ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
a , rt - pcr analysis of the expression levels of mrna encoding carbonic anhydrase ii , iv , and xiv , and encoding hypertrophic markers anp , and bnp , in adult human ventricle , and adult human brain cortex .
pcr products were analyzed on 1 % agarose - ethidium bromide gels .
b , mrna expression was quantified from ventricles of non - hypertrophic human ventricles ( black bars ) , hypertrophic human ventricles ( grey bars ) , or failing human ventricles ( white bars ) , using real - time quantitative rt - pcr .
data were corrected for individual variation with gapdh standard curves , expressed as cycle threshold .
* p < 0.05 compared to non - hypertrophic ventricle , paired t - test ; + p < 0.05 compared to mild / moderate hypertrophic or dilated ventricle , one - way anova followed by newman - keuls multiple comparison test.c , cycle threshold values of different genes corrected for individual variation with gapdh , of right and left failing ventricles .
real time reverse transcription pcr quantified the abundance of transcripts in the heart samples .
cycle threshold ( ct ) values in real time - pcr were used as a measure of transcript abundance , where higher threshold values correspond to lower mrna abundance and each change of 1 cycle threshold corresponds to a two - fold difference in message abundance .
to correct for differences in total rna abundance between samples , each sample was analyzed for anp , bnp and the ca genes , and for gapdh ( figure 1b ) .
to correct for variations in the amount of mrna assayed , cycle threshold values were corrected by the ct for gapdh , assumed to be present at a constant baseline level .
anp and bnp are fetal genes whose expression is induced during hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth , or during heart failure [ 20,21 ] .
we found marked increases of anp and bnp expression in all hypertrophic or dilated ventricles ( failing heart ) , compared to non - hypertrophic non - dilated ventricles ( non - failing hearts ) , or compared to ventricles with mild / moderate hypertrophy or dilation ( non - failing hearts ) ( figure 1b ) .
remarkably , caii and caiv message increased at least two - fold in hypertrophic ventricles , and 16 - fold in failing hearts ( 4 ct difference ) , compared to non - hypertrophic , non - dilated non - failing ventricles ( figure 1b ) .
caxiv mrna expression did not increase in hypertrophic ventricles of non - failing heart and failing ventricles .
we conclude that hypertrophic ventricles express elevated levels of caii , caiv , anp , and bnp , message , relative to non - hypertrophic non - dilated ventricles , which increased in failing ventricles , as evaluated by qrt - pcr .
expression of anp , bnp , caii , caiv , and caxiv did not differ between right and left failing ventricles ( figure 1c ) .
expression of carbonic anhydrase proteins to quantify the level of ca protein expression in hearts , immunoblots were performed .
because of the small size of material collected in embs , it was not possible to evaluate protein expression in samples from patients with good prognosis ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
ventricular samples collected from explanted failing explanted hearts ( right or left ventricles ) , but with no signs of either hypertrophy or dilation , were compared to hypertrophic or dilated failing ventricles ( additional file 3 : table s3 ) .
caii , a near - ubiquitous cytosolic isoform , is expressed in mouse embryonic and fetal heart , and adult mouse heart [ 13,22 ] .
we examined the expression of caii in mouse and human hearts , by immunoblotting .
immunoreactivity was observed in hek293 transiently transfected with hcaii cdna , and endogenously in hek293 cells transfected with empty vector , ( figure 2a ) .
human heart ventricular samples from explanted hearts , and cardiomyocytes freshly isolated from adult mouse heart , showed robust and moderate caii expression , respectively ( figure 2a ) .
no immunoreactivity was found on parallel blots incubated with non - immune rabbit serum ( not shown ) .
the presence of endogenous caii in hek293 cells has been reported previously , using the same antibody [ 10 ] .
figure 2 expression of carbonic anhydrases in hearts.a , lysates were prepared from adult human ventricular sample isolated from explanted heart ( see table two ) ( 50 mug protein ) , or freshly isolated adult mouse ventricular myocytes ( 50 mug protein ) , or hek293 cells transfected with empty vector ( 30 mug protein ) , or hek293 cells transfected with human caii ( a ) , human caiv b ) , or human caxiv ( c ) cdna ( 30 mug protein ) , cdna .
samples were resolved by sds - page , transferred to pvdf membrane , and probed with anti - caii , caiv or caxiv as indicated .
filled arrows indicate position of protein .
to examine the role of caiv and caxiv in the failing heart , we studied their expression ( figure 2b,c ) .
immunoreactive bands , corresponding to the expression of caiv and caxiv , were observed in hek293 cells transiently transfected with rabbit caiv , or mouse caxiv ( figure 3a ) , cdnas .
hek293 cells transfected with empty vector did not reveal caiv or caxiv immunoreactive bands , indicating specificity of the antibodies .
human failing ventricles and isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes , showed modest and significant caiv and caxiv expression , respectively ( figure 2b,c ) .
specificity of the caiv antibody is indicated by the lack of band in untransfected hek293 cells ( figure 2b ) and the specificity of the antibody has been previously assessed [ 23 ] .
similarly , in untransfected hek293 cells there is a faint band at the caxiv position , possibly arising from spillover from the much stronger signal in caxiv - transfected cells ( figure 2c ) and the antibody 's specificity has previously been assessed [ 18 ] .
figure 3 expression of caii , caiv , and anp proteins in adult human ventricle.a , lysates were prepared from hypertrophic / dilated ( h / d ) , or non - hypertrophic / non - dilated ( nh / nd ) adult human ventricles , from explanted failing hearts .
left panels , failing ventricles with no signs of either hypertrophy or dilation were compared with hypertrophic or dilated failing ventricles .
protein samples ( 30 mug ) were resolved by sds - page , transferred to pvdf membrane , and probed with anti - caii , anti - caiv , anti - anp , and anti - alpha - actinin antibodies .

* indicates statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) .
some patients with end - stage heart failure presented with either left or right ventricles with no signs of hypertrophy or dilation ( additional file 3 : table s3 ) .
to evaluate whether the ca isoform expression was altered in failing ventricles with hypertrophic or dilated versus non - hypertrophic non - dilated ventricles , protein expression was quantified by densitometry of the immunoblots ( figure 3 ) .
caii , caiv , and anp proteins could be clearly identified on immunoblots ( figure 3 ) .
caii , caiv , and anp protein expression increased ~ 2 and ~ 2.5 - fold in hypertrophic / dilated ventricles ( figure 3 ) .
caxiv showed a slight increase , ~ 35 % , in dilated failing ventricles compared to non - hypertrophic non - dilated failing ventricles , but did not reach statistical significance difference .
in the failing hearts , caii , caiv , and anp protein expression increased in ventricles without signs of hypertrophy or dilation compared to hypertrophic or dilated ventricles , demonstrating that these genes increased under hypertrophic conditions independent of the contractile performance of the heart .
conversely , failing explanted heart , showed no differences in caii , caiv , caxiv , and anp protein expression , in non - hypertrophic non - dilated right ventricles , compared to non - hypertrophic non - dilated left ventricles ( figure 3a right panel and 3b , n = 3 ) .
discussion this study examined whether altered carbonic anhydrase expression plays a role in human heart failure .
heart failure ranges in severity from moderate impairment in cardiac function , to significant damage that leaves the heart unable to manage its workload [ 24 ] .
this study demonstrates that caii and caiv expression increased in failing human ventricles .
these enzymes need to be considered for their contribution to the progression of heart failure and as prognostic markers .
a caveat to this work is that the extremely small amount of material in biopsies prevented assessment of changes of carbonic anhydrase catalytic activity .
similar to our findings , elevated caii expression was observed in rats with spontaneous hypertension and heart failure ( shhf ) [ 25 ] .
furthermore , mice that develop angiotensin ii - induced cardiac hypertrophy ( tg1306 / 1r , tg ) , and dilated cardiomyopathy with aging [ 26 ] , had increased expression of caii , caiv , and caxiv , mrna , in addition to elevated mrna for low - activity secreted cavi [ 27 ] , suggesting that induction of carbonic anhydrases is a feature of cardiac hypertrophy .
others observed no difference in anp mrna abundance between left or right ventricle from control wky rats , but levels increased in either left or right hypertrophic ventricles of naturally occurring biventricular hypertrophic rats [ 28 ] .
in the human heart , the right ventricle has important anatomical and functional differences from the left ventricle .
the right ventricle is a thin - walled , low - pressure structure that unlike the left ventricle receives most of its blood supply during systole .
it has a complex , crescent shape in contrast to the left ventricle with a simple ellipsoid form .
differences between the two ventricles are , however , mostly related to their functions .
as the left ventricle must pump blood much further and with more resistance than the right does , the muscular wall of the left ventricle is far thicker to produce the necessary force .
differences in the message and protein for cas , anp , and bnp genes expressed in healthy left ventricles compared to healthy right ventricles have not been evaluated here .
we were unable to complete this analysis since we could not obtain comparable non - diseased ventricular material .
carbonic anhydrases work with the ae3 cl - / hco3 - exchanger and nhe1 na +/ h + exchanger to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , as is found in heart failure ( figure 4 ) .
both ae3 and nhe1 bind to the cytosolic enzyme , caii , to form a transport metabolon , the complex of a membrane transport protein and the metabolic enzyme responsible for metabolism of the transported substrate [ 10,11,29 ] .
caii catalytic activity ( co2 + h2o < - - > hco3 - + h +) produces hco3 - and h + for efflux by ae3 , and nhe1 , respectively ( figure 4 ) .
combined action of ae3 and nhe1 results in net cellular nacl loading , without change of phi , which is consistent with the finding of elevated na + and unchanged phi in pro - hypertrophically - stimulated cardiomyocytes [ 30,31 ] .
co - activation of nhe1 - caii and ae3 is pathological as it is self - sustaining and nhe1 is not subject to inhibition by alkaline phi , since the co - activated transporters do not change phi [ 4 ] .
we previously found that the activity of ae3fl and nhe1 promote hypertrophy and the hypertrophy - programmed increases expression of the ca enzymes in cultured rat cardiomyocytes [ 13 ] .
sustained nhe1 / ae3 activation is itself pro - hypertrophic as elevated na + decreases the efficacy of the na +/ ca2 + exchanger , which normally contributes to maintenance of low cytosolic ca2 + levels .
in turn , sustained elevated ca2 + is a consummate hypertrophic signal , working through the calcineurin / nfat signaling cascade .
figure 4 integrative model presenting possible pro - hypertrophic action of carbonic anhydrases in cardiomyocytes .
( 1 ) pro - hypertrophic agonists , including phenylephrine ( phe ) , angiotensin ii ( angii ) and endothelin i ( et ) all act upon g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcr ) .
( 2 ) in turn protein kinase c ( pkc ) is activated .
( 3 ) pkc directly stimulates ae3 and indirectly stimulates nhe1 , via mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) .
( 4 ) cl - / hco3 - exchange and na +/ h + exchange by ae3 and nhe1 , respectively , are stimulated by the catalytic activity of caii , caiv and caxiv .
caii provides substrate hco3 - and h + for efflux respectively by ae3 and nhe1 .
caxiv ( anchored to the extracellular surface via a transmembrane segment ) and caiv ( anchored to the extracellular surface via a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol linkage ) consume effluxed hco3 - to maximize the size of the transmembrane hco3 - gradient , activating ae3 .
combined activation of ae3 and nhe1 accumulates na + cytosolically , without effect on ph [ 4,9,32,33 ] .
( 5 ) this rise in cytosolic na + compromises or reverses the ability the na +/ ca2 + exchanger ( ncx ) , which normally effluxes ca2 + , driven by the transmembrane na + gradient .
( 6 ) intracellular ca ++ thus rises , which activates calcineurin .
( 7 ) a major target of calcineurin is the transcription factor , nfat , which regulates transcription of a set of genes .
here we found that expression of caiv and caii in diseased human hearts increased as heart failure progressed ( double - headed red arrows ) .
recent studies also point to a pro - hypertrophic role of caii in rodent hearts [ 34 ] .
cardiomyocytes car2 mice [ 35 ] , which have a disrupted caii locus , have decreased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to phenylephrine .
moreover , in rat cardiomyocytes over - expression of a catalytically - null caii mutant inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , in a dominant negative manner .
here we found that caii and caiv mrna levels rise dramatically in hypertrophied and failing human hearts .
caiv has also been found to associate with anion exchangers and to enhance their transport activity , by metabolism of substrate bicarbonate [ 23 ] .
ae3 's hco3 - efflux activity is maximized by caiv , as conversion of hco3 - ( by caiv ) maximizes the transmembrane [ hco3 - gradient , which enhances the rate of hco3 - transport .
we propose that ae3 , and nhe1 , caii , and caiv work together to promote cardiac hypertrophy ( figure 4 ) .
sustained co - activation of ae3 and nhe1 is pro - hypertrophic , and this is exacerbated by caii and caiv , which promote their combined function .
the increased expression of caii and caiv expression in hypertrophied human myocardium is consistent with a pathological feed - forward cascade in which increased caii / caiv expression contributes to hypertrophic signaling , including increased ca expression ( figure 4 ) .
to intervene in the hypertrophic cascade present in heart failure we propose that caii and caiv represent targets for anti - hypertrophic therapy .
previously , we found that the membrane permeant ca inhibitor , 6 - ethoxyzolamide ( etz , cardrase ) , which targets the htm , intervenes in the feed - forward cascade , preventing and reversing the agonist - induced cardiomyocyte growth [ 13 ] .
as a counter - point to this argument , however , the role of carbonic anhydrases in moderating the global activity of ph regulatory transporters in heart has been suggested to be modest [ 36,37 ] .
an alternate explanation for the effects of caii / caiv on cardiac hypertrophy could arise through more direct effects on ca ++ channels .
alterations of cytosolic ph have profound effects on ca ++ channels [ 38 ] .
recent findings show that bicarbonate transporters can induce localized changed of cytosolic ph [ 39 ] , which could be especially significant in confined microenvironments of cardiomyocytes , for example t - tubules .
localized changes of ph , arising from carbonic anhydrase catalysis , could therefore influence ca ++ channel activity , with downstream impact on ca ++ - dependent hypertrophic signaling cascade .
the membrane permeant ca inhibitor , acetazolamide ( actz , diamox ) , blocks the reabsorption of sodium and potassium by inhibiting ca in the renal tubule [ 40 ] , and was used as a diuretic in patients with severe congestive heart failure , before the advent of current loop diuretics like furosemide [ 41 ] .
clinically , the status of congestive heart failure in all patients receiving diamox , clearly improved [ 42 ] .
patients with mild heart failure were adequately controlled with diamox , whereas patients with severe heart failure require other diuretics alone , or in combination with diamox [ 42 ] .
more recently , actz was safely used in pediatric patients with heart disease , to lower serum bicarbonate and acid - base excess , and raise chloride [ 43 ] .
high - dose diuretic therapy is the primary cause of metabolic alkalosis in pediatric patients with heart disease , and carbonic anhydrase inhibition improved this condition .
clinical relevance of the present study includes : 1 ) carbonic anhydrase expression levels , in particular caii and caiv , increase during progression of cardiac hypertrophy .
the prognostic value of biomarkers as clinical predictor factors in heart failure is well - established [ 44 - 47 ] and this work suggests that caii and caiv are molecular correlates of hypertrophy .
2 ) the mainstay of treatment of acute heart failure is diuretic therapy .
diuretics rapidly improve symptoms associated with volume overload , while there are no data showing morbidity or mortality increased from the use of chronic diuretic therapy .
ca inhibition with existing drugs could be readily adopted to concomitantly induce diuresis and inhibit the ca enzymes whose activity increases as hypertrophy escalates .
conclusion this study suggests that ventricular hypertrophy / failure and the augmented expression of the ca in the ventricle may be induced by a common mechanism .
ventricular stretch arising from an increased ventricular load leads to the induction of ca gene expression .
in this paper we have presented evidence of elevated ca as biomarkers for early detection of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure , and proposing a mechanism that could improve the cardiac performance , by ca inhibition .
the ability to distinguish individual patients at the early stage of heart disease , by detecting elevation of ca expression , might help to improve their functional status and prevent further circulatory collapse that will require cardiac transplantation .

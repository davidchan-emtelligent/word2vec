however , even when the ct is installed in the emergency department , the time required for positioning the patient for ct may significantly prolong the duration of ct diagnosis .
methods our hospital is a level 1 trauma center with a catchment population of 2.5 million ; there are two ct scans in the ed. all severely injured patients are submitted to us on admission .
wbct is performed as the first - line radiologic investigation in haemodynamic - stable patients or in unstable patients with negative abdominal us and without a clear source of bleeding .
unstable patients with severe head trauma and lateral signs are also submitted to ct. to evaluate whether the use of ct in the severely unstable patients brings a significant delay in emergency surgery , we retrospectively analyzed all early trauma death from january 2009 to november 2010 .
results seven hundred severe trauma patients ( iss > 15 ) were brought in alive .
thirty - eight ( 5.4 %) died before icu admission : 21 died in the shock room before any surgical intervention .
one patient was submitted to thoracotomy and laparothomy in the shock room and died .
one more died on the ct table .
the remaining 15 patients , severely hypotensive , were alive on admission to the or. one of them was brought directly to the or with no investigation because of massive bleeding from the extremities .
the others had us on admission .
us was the only investigation for seven of them ; they all had a positive us showing important bleeding in the abdomen or in the chest .
the other seven , who had no evidence of bleeding on the us , were submitted to wbct .
the mean time elapsed from hospital admission to or entrance was 23 minutes ( 15 to 30 minutes ) for patients who had only us and 70 minutes ( 52 to 90 minutes ) for the ct group .
the seven patients who had only us were all submitted to shock room decompressive minithoracotomy ( five bilateral ) with the suspicion of pneumothorax .
conclusions recent reports suggest implementation of multi - slice ct integrated into the resuscitation room , thus enabling resuscitation to be performed directly on the er ct. unless this new technology is adopted , even the ed - based ct still needs excessive time to be performed in most unstable patients .
in a cohort of patients who eventually died in the or , a diagnostic process including ed - based wbct was associated with a threefold increase in the time needed from hospital admission to surgery .

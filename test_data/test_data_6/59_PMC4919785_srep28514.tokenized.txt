in this study we applied mendelian randomisation analysis using 17 genetic variants previously associated with egfr to investigate the causal role of kidney function on chd .
we used 13,145 participants from the ucl - lshtm - edinburgh - bristol ( ucleb ) consortium and 194,427 participants from the coronary artery disease genome - wide replication and meta - analysis plus coronary artery disease ( cardiogramplusc4d ) consortium .
we observed significant association of an unweighted gene score with chd risk ( odds ratio = 0.983 per additional egfr - increasing allele , 95 % ci = 0.970 - 0.996 , p = 0.008 ) .
however , using weights calculated from ucleb , the gene score was not associated with disease risk ( p = 0.11 ) .
these conflicting results could be explained by a single snp , rs653178 , which was not associated with egfr in the ucleb sample , but has known pleiotropic effects that prevent us from drawing a causal conclusion .
the observational association between low egfr and increased chd risk was not explained by potential confounders , and there was no evidence of reverse causation , therefore leaving the remaining unexplained association as an open question .
chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) occurs in 15 - 20 % of the general population aged 65 years or older .
markers of ckd , such as a low estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) and / or elevated urine albumin creatinine ratio ( uacr ) , are major independent risk factors for cardiovascular and all - cause mortality12 .
in particular , people with lower egfr are at a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease ( chd ) .
although it has been proposed that ckd may be causally associated with chd , the precise biological pathways for this association are not well understood , and hypotheses regarding this finding are varied , broadly involving inflammatory pathways and / or vascular calcification3456 .
currently , people with ckd are treated with blood pressure lowering drugs and statins to prevent poor outcomes .
however , many genetic variants that are associated with high blood pressure are not associated with egfr or ckd7 , as might be expected if they were on the same causal pathway to chd .
also , there is little overlap in association between ckd and chd genetic variants and early markers of cardiovascular disease , which would be expected if kidney function were causally related to chd8 .
people with ckd tend to have had adverse early life circumstances that predispose them to cardiovascular disease91011 , and individuals who are overweight at earlier age are more likely to have ckd at older age suggesting that ckd is a marker or consequence of a cumulative adverse life style .
hence , it is not yet clear whether low kidney function directly causes chd or whether the observed association is due to other shared risk factors / confounders , in particular socioeconomic status , early life risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle .
here we applied mendelian randomisation ( mr ) to determine whether lower egfr per se has a causal role to contribute to later chd .
to our knowledge , this is the first mr study to explicitly investigate the influence of egfr on chd .
previously , olden et al. studied whether several genetic variants affect both egfr and chd8 .
they identified one snp , rs653178 that was associated with both ; but while this is consistent with a causal effect , they did not consider whether it met the assumptions required for mr nor did they estimate a causal effect size .
here we go further by combining 17 snps into a single gene score , which can improve the power of mr studies when individual snps are not significantly associated with the outcome12 , and we use a richly phenotyped data set , the ucleb consortium13 to thoroughly examine the possibility of violating the mr assumptions through confounding or pleiotropy .
research design and methods study design we used data from two consortia , ucleb13 and cardiogramplusc4d141516 .
the former allowed assessment of the mr assumptions for egfr , namely that the gene score is associated with egfr , not associated with potential confounders of the egfr - chd association , and not associated with other biomarkers of chd that might represent alternative pathways than that through egfr .
in ucleb , we used individual patient data from 2,249 cases of chd and 10,896 controls from 7 cohort studies : the british regional heart study ( brhs ) , british women 's heart and health study ( bwhhs ) , caerphilly prospective study ( caps ) , edinburgh type - 2 diabetes study ( et2ds ) , edinburgh artery study ( eas ) , english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa ) , and whitehall ii study ( whii ) .
four studies ( brhs , bwhhs , caps , and et2ds ) have egfr available .
ucleb has 116 phenotypes related to cardiovascular function , allowing snps to be thoroughly assessed for validity of the mr assumptions .
the cardiogramplusc4d consortium provides a large sample for assessing genetic association with chd .
the consortium released summary statistics from 3 meta - analyses of coronary artery disease : cardiogram genome - wide association study ( gwas ) with 22,233 chd cases and 64,762 controls16 , c4d gwas with 15,420 chd cases and 15,062 controls15 , and the combined data of these two gwas with additional cohorts , cardiogramplusc4d metabochip , with 63,746 chd cases and 130,681 controls14 .
these consortia data allow the assessment of genetic association with chd in very large samples , but do not provide information on egfr .
selection of snps and construction of gene score we identified 32 snps previously reported to be associated with egfr ( s1 table ) .
seventeen of them , which are not in linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) and have been genotyped in ucleb , were shortlisted as potential components of an instrument for mr ( s2 table ) because they could be investigated for validity of the mr assumptions using the ucleb data .
due to the different genotyping platforms used in cardiogram gwas , c4d gwas , and cardiogramplusc4d metabochip , our 17 selected snps are not always available in all 3 meta - analyses .
thus the total sample sizes vary across snps used to investigate association with chd ( s1 fig ) .
these selected snps were then combined into gene scores .
two types of gene score were used : 1 ) unweighted gene score , defined for subject i as where gij is the count of egfr - increasing alleles for subject i at snp j with the direction of effect taken from the ucleb data , and 2 ) weighted gene score , , which includes estimates of effects on egfr , wj , at each snp based on the ucleb data .
more precisely , the wj are the estimates from linear regression analyses of egfr on snp j , under additive genotypic coding .
exposure and outcome variables our primary outcome is chd ( defined as fatal or non fatal myocardial infarction , or revascularization , from both diagnosis validation and self - report ) and the exposure is the level of kidney function measured by egfr .
in the ucleb data , we derived egfr based on creatinine using the modification of diet in renal disease ( mdrd ) model17 egfr was normally distributed in our data , therefore no further transformation was applied .
potential confounding factors from the total of 116 traits available in ucleb , we systematically checked for potential confounding factors across 94 traits measured in up to 7 studies .
we identified potential confounders by testing each of these traits for both egfr - trait ( available in 4 studies ) and chd - trait associations .
as the presence of both associations is necessary but not sufficient to establish confounding , we considered those associated traits as potential confounding factors , unless there is additional external evidence that a particular biomarker is renally cleared , i.e. potentially on the causal pathway between kidney function and chd .
for the egfr - trait and chd - trait associations we controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05 by the benjamini - hochberg procedure .
we used a permutation procedure to check whether correlation among traits would cause this procedure to be conservative , finding that the overall level of correlation is negligible in this context ( see supplementary methods ) .
snp instrument validity we used ucleb data to test the validity of our gene scores as instrumental variables under the three mr assumptions : 1 ) association between gene scores and egfr , 2 ) absence of association between gene scores and common causes of egfr and chd , and 3 ) absence of pathways between gene scores and chd other than through egfr .
we tested assumption 1 using linear regression of egfr on the gene scores , assumption 2 using linear regression of each identified potential confounder on the gene scores ( except gender where logistic regression was applied ) , and assumption 3 using linear regression of each trait in ucleb ( whether or not a potential confounder ) on the gene scores .
each regression adjusted for study as a categorical covariate .
we controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05 by the benjamini - hochberg procedure .
mendelian randomisation we tested for a causal effect by testing the association between each gene score and chd and appealing to the mr principle .
as only summary odds ratios and their standard errors were available from the chd consortia , we applied the johnson formula described by burgess et al.12 , in which the regression coefficient of the gene score on chd is with standard error , where is the estimated log odds ratio of snp j on chd , syj is its standard error , and wj is a predetermined weight .
the unweighted score has wj = 1 for all snps , whereas the weighted score sets wj to the linear regression coefficient of snp j for egfr , here estimated from the ucleb data ( weights and odds ratios were calculated for the egfr increasing alleles ) .
this is an example of two - sample mendelian randomization18 in which the exposure and outcome associations are measured in different samples .
two - sided tests of association were performed by comparing the ratio of and its standard error to a standard normal distribution .
using the weighted score , is an estimate of the causal effect of egfr on chd , but we avoid this interpretation as our aim here was merely to detect the presence of a causal effect .
reverse mendelian randomisation we considered whether a causal effect exists in the opposite direction , with chd acting to cause reduced kidney function .
we constructed an weighted gene score from 51 snps associated with chd at genome - wide significance , as reported by cardiogramplusc4d14 and tested this score for association with egfr in the ucleb data using summary odds ratios as above .
results a summary of chd cases and controls in ucleb is shown in table 1 .
as expected , we observed that egfr is significantly negatively associated with chd ( or = 0.984 per ml / min / 1.73 m2 increase , 95 % ci = 0.979 - 0.988 , p = 1.98 x 10 - 12 ) across its entire range and particularly when comparing subjects with reduced (< 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2 ) egfr to those in the intermediate ( 60 - 90 ml / min / 1.73 m2 ) , and normal / high range (>= 90 ml / min / 1.73 m2 , fig. 1 ) , consistent with previous studies of the mdrd egfr - chd association19. from 94 traits available in 7 ucleb studies , we identified 28 potential confounding factors of the egfr - chd association ( fig. 2 , s4 table ) .
these are generally concordant with previously observed correlates of egfr and risk factors for chd19 .
some discrepancies , for example blood pressure and smoking ( ever / never ) , which were not associated with egfr in ucleb are likely due to the cross - sectional nature of the data , and have been previously seen in other data20 .
one of the potentially confounding factors was ntprobnp , which is known to be renally cleared6 .
ntprobnp was therefore considered to be a variable on the causal pathway between egfr and chd and not a confounding variable .
we also excluded percentage body fat because this was only available in the et2ds study , which did not have many of the other confounders measured .
due to missing data in the remaining 26 potential confounders , we then investigated the observational association between egfr and chd in a reduced sample size of 1547 ( or = 0.977 per 1 ml / min / 1.73 m2 increase , 95 % ci = 0.965 - 0.989 , p = 3.38 x 10 - 4 ) .
after adjusting for 26 potential confounders , the association between egfr - chd was slightly attenuated and remained borderline significant ( or = 0.868 per 10 ml / min / 1.73 m2 increase , 95 % ci = 0.760 - 1.000 , p = 0.05 ) .
in ucleb , the combination of 17 snps explained 1.5 % of the variation in egfr .
the corresponding f statistics were 59 and 91 for unweighted and weighted scores respectively , indicating that the gene score is a strong instrument .
in testing for association between gene scores and all traits available in ucleb ( fig. 3 ) , our gene scores showed an exclusive association with kidney function measurements , including egfr ( adjusted p = 2.0 x 10 - 12 and p = 3.3 x 10 - 19 for unweighted and weighted gene scores respectively ) , creatinine ( adjusted p = 6.0 x 10 - 9 and p = 6.8 x 10 - 16 ) , and serum urea concentration ( adjusted p = 9.8 x 10 - 3 and p = 3.1 x 10 - 5 ) .
this confirms the first mr assumption that our gene scores are indeed a good proxy for kidney function .
secondly , associations between our gene scores and 26 potential confounding factors and ntprobnp were not significant , meeting the second mr assumption that our gene scores are not associated with common causes of egfr and chd .
although we cannot be sure that our gene scores are not associated with unmeasured confounders , these results ( including many of the strongest biomarkers for chd ) suggest that any such confounding is weak .
lastly , association between our gene scores and other traits available in ucleb do not reach significance .
therefore our gene scores appear specific to egfr and other kidney - related traits .
we found significant association of the unweighted score with chd ( or = 0.983 per additional egfr increasing allele , 95 % ci = 0.970 - 0.996 , p = 0.008 ) , suggesting a causal effect of egfr on chd .
this was in the direction to that seen in the observational data .
however , the association was not significant when using a weighted score ( or = 0.993 , 95 % ci = 0.984 - 1.002 , p = 0.11 ) .
inspection of the weights given to the individual snps suggested that these results could be explained by rs653178 alone .
previously , it has been shown that there is little overlap between well - validated snps for kidney disease and chd , where only rs653178 was highly associated with both cystatin - c - based egfr and chd21 .
however this was not the case in ucleb , in which rs653178 was not associated with egfr and received the smallest weight among all 17 instrument snps ( s6 table ) .
therefore , using weights from ucleb diminished evidence of a causal association observed with the unweighted score .
the unweighted gene score was further investigated to assess the sensitivity of the observed nominal evidence of a causal association .
we first excluded rs1260326 , which has known pleiotropic effects22 , and observed the same association signal remaining ( or = 0.991 , 95 % ci = 0.981 - 1.001 , p = 0.003 ) .
secondly we excluded rs653178 which could have stronger effect through cystatin - based egfr instead of creatinine - based egfr22 from the gene score , and found that the evidence of causal effect disappeared ( or = 0.994 , 95 % ci = 0.982 - 1.005 , p = 0.291 ) .
this implies that rs653178 is driving the significant association of the gene score with chd .
to confirm this , we excluded each of the 17 snps at a time , and observed that only the exclusion of rs653178 removed the association signal .
in addition , instead of identifying the egfr increasing alleles from the ucleb data , we incorporated external information on the direction of effect for 9 snps that were available in olden et al. , to allow more accurate estimates due to their larger sample size .
while the egfr increasing alleles in ucleb are retained for the remaining snps , for 3 out of the 9 snps from olden et al. a different egfr increasing allele was identified in comparison to ucleb ( s6 table ) .
after adjusting the unweighted score accordingly , the evidence of a causal effect remained ( or = 0.971 , 95 % ci = 0.950 - 0.992 , p = 0.007 ) .
we further investigated the case in which egfr < 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2 ( stage 3 nephropathy ) which has been significantly associated with increased chd events2324 .
if there is a causal influence of egfr on chd , it may be stronger in those for whom an increased association is observed. by conditioning on egfr , a biased estimate of causal effect may result25 .
however , we observed little evidence of a causal association between egfr and chd with the unweighted score ( or = 0.982 , 95 % ci = 0.963 - 1.002 , p = 0.083 ) and the weighted score ( or = 0.991 , 95 % ci = 0.974 - 1.008 , p = 0.286 ) when restricting analysis to subjects with egfr < 60 .
since the gene scores were not specific to egfr but also associated with other kidney function traits , we adjusted the regression of chd on egfr for creatinine and serum urea concentration in the ucleb data alone .
neither gene score was significantly associated with chd in the ucleb data , with or without adjustment for creatinine and serum urea concentration .
finally , the reverse mr did not show an association of the chd gene score with egfr ( beta = - 0.120 , 95 % ci = - 1.271 - 0.872 , p = 0.715 ) .
discussion we applied mendelian randomisation to determine whether lower egfr has a causal role in chd .
to improve the power of mr , we combined 17 snps into a single gene score. by using a richly phenotyped data set in the ucleb consortium , we thoroughly examined whether our gene score meets the assumptions of mendelian randomisation studies , in that it is associated with egfr , not associated with potential confounders of the egfr - chd association , and not associated with other biomarkers of chd that might represent alternative pathways than that through egfr .
the gene scores appeared to meet these assumptions although we noted associations with additional kidney function traits that might represent alternative pathways through kidney function to that measured by egfr .
we found significant evidence of a causal effect on chd using an unweighted score .
however , the weighted score revealed that this result is driven by rs653178 , which was not associated with egfr in ucleb ( and therefore unreliably down - weighted the significance of the unweighted score ) .
potential reasons that could cause the discrepancy of rs653187 between ucleb and the previous study by olden et al. are random sampling , low power due to the smaller sample size in ucleb , and a substantially weaker association between rs653178 and creatinine - based egfr ( p = 1 x 10 - 4 ) compared to cystatin - c - based egfr ( p = 3.5 x 10 - 11 ) 22 .
further analyses , including taking the direction of effect from external sources rather than the ucleb data , and selecting study participants based on low egfr , did not yield any stronger evidence of a causal effect .
one explanation of our results is that , if a causal effect exists , it may act only through some pathways contributing to measured egfr , marked by rs653178 , whereas other pathways marked by the other 16 snps do not have a causal effect .
however , rs653178 has been previously shown to be associated with a number of phenotypes , including mean arterial pressure26 , blood pressure27 , celiac disease28 and peripheral artery disease , a known complication of both chd and ckd29 .
therefore the known pleiotropic effect of rs653178 restricts inference of a direct causal effect of egfr on chd .
our study has some limitations .
only 1.5 % of the variation in egfr was explained by the gene scores comprising 17 snps .
in the largest consortium data available , cardiogramplusc4d including approximately 200,000 individuals , we would have 74 % and 25 % power to detect causal odds ratios of 0.9 and 0.95 respectively30 , both in excess of the observational odds ratio of 0.98 in the ucleb consortium .
although the study was likely underpowered over the full range of egfr , a stronger causal effect may exist among those with egfr < 60 , but our gene scores were not associated with chd among those subjects .
a score including more egfr associated snps would have more power to detect a causal effect , though at greater risk of violating the mr assumptions .
another limitation concerns the validation of the mr assumptions for our gene scores .
while ucleb provides a richly phenotyped and large data set , other phenotypes not measured in those studies may be confounding factors or show pleiotropic effects of our gene scores .
furthermore our power to detect confounding and pleiotropy was reduced by control for multiple testing , which we deemed necessary to avoid falsely inferring that our gene scores are invalid instruments .
observational studies have mainly shown increased risk of chd among those with low mdrd egfr compared to those in the normal range .
studies using newer biomarkers provide clear evidence that there is association even at higher egfr31 .
we have treated egfr as a continuous variable in mr analysis , which may have reduced power if the causal effect is restricted to subjects with low mdrd egfr .
we took this approach because the associated snps apparently influence egfr over its entire range so that a standard mr analysis would correspond to a population - wide intervention on egfr levels .
again however , we found no association between the gene scores and chd among subjects with low egfr .
more robust methods for mr analysis in discrete exposure strata have recently become available2532 and could be applied here .
however , we believe our current results are not sufficiently encouraging to warrant these approaches .
we are not the first to observe that inflammatory and thrombotic markers associated with chd are raised in people with ckd5 .
these potential confounding biomarkers may be a result of other life style associated risk factors leading to ckd , in particular overweight at younger age and subsequent obesity333435 .
in total we identified 27 potential confounders but upon adjustment the association between egfr and chd remained significant with a similar odds ratio .
our power to detect confounders was limited by the number of cases of chd in ucleb , the range of phenotypes considered ( in particular excluding socio - economic status ) , the limited sample size for some particular phenotypes and the multiple testing burden , and further confounders may exist that attenuate or abolish the egfr - chd association .
we used reverse mr to address the possibility of reverse causation , but did not observe significant association between a gene score for chd and levels of egfr .
in conclusion , this study observed weak evidence for a causal effect of low egfr on chd risk , while the observational association was not explained by potential confounders nor by reverse causation .
however , this result was highly influenced by rs653178 , which has known pleiotropic effects , therefore restricting any inference of a direct causal effect of egfr on chd .
our results leave the remaining unexplained association between egfr and chd as an open question .

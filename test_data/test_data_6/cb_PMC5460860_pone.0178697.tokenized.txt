objectives to establish the normal values of spino - pelvic alignment and to clarify the effect of age - related changes using large , community - based cohorts .
methods in this study , data from 1461 participants ( 466 men , 995 women ) were analyzed .
on lateral standing radiographs , the following parameters were measured : thoracic kyphosis ( tk ) , lumbar lordosis ( ll ) , pelvic tilt ( pt ) , pelvic incidence ( pi ) , and c7 sagittal vertical axis ( sva ) .
all values are expressed as the mean +/ - standard deviation .
the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to examine correlations between variables of spino - pelvic parameters .
finally , we analyzed the relationship between age and spino - pelvic parameters .
therefore , we entered values for the body mass index ( bmi ) , sva , tk , and pi - ll into a multiple regression model to adjust for potential confounding factors .
results the sva , tk , and pt increased with age , and ll decreased with age .
regarding sex differences , the tk was statistically significantly larger in men than in women , and ll , pt , and pi were statistically significantly smaller in men than in women .
correlation coefficients between the sva and tk , between the sva and pi - ll , and between tk and pi - ll were none , strong , and weak , respectively .
results of multiple regression analysis between age and spino - pelvic parameters showed that the standardized partial regression coefficients for the sva , tk , and pi - ll were 0.17 , 0.30 , and 0.23 , respectively , in men and 0.29 , 0.32 , and 0.23 , respectively , in women .
conclusions we found that all parameters were significantly associated with age in men and women .
the sva , tk , and pt increased with age , and ll decreased with age .
results of multiple regression analysis also demonstrated that the sva , tk , and pi - ll are related to age .
indeed , the pi - ll value increased with age .
in this study , a more excessive pi - ll mismatch was shown , indicating an increased risk of spinal malalignment .
differences in the absolute values of spino - pelvic parameters in each sex were small yet statistically significant .
thus , further study should be performed to corroborate this finding .

data may be requested at hashizum @ wakayama - med.ac.jp . introduction sagittal spino - pelvic malalignment is one of the most prevalent disorders of the aging spine .
sagittal malalignment concerns are reflected in reports of flat back syndrome , which is an iatrogenic malalignment after spinal instrumentation that results in persistent lower back pain [ 1 - 4 ] .
the sagittal curvature of the spine and pelvis balance each other to maintain a stable posture and horizontal gaze .
once the sagittal alignment is abnormal , more energy is required so that the body can remain balanced without external support [ 5 ] .
glassman et al. reported that positive sagittal balance was significantly related to clinical symptoms and health - related quality of life in patients with adult spinal deformity [ 6 ] .
in addition , patients with kyphosis often complain of decreased walking ability and an increased propensity of falling , thereby resulting in weaker back extensor strength and poorer balance as well as heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease , dysphasia , and respiratory symptoms [ 7 - 9 ] .
therefore , abnormal sagittal spinal alignment should be restored to normal .
in previous studies , the c7 plumb line was used to measure sagittal global alignment [ 10 - 14 ] .
the c7 sagittal vertical axis ( sva ) is measured as the distance from the c7 plumb line to the posterosuperior endplate of the sacrum .
the c7 plumb line has been used by previous authors to evaluate possible changes in sagittal spinal global alignment that occur with age .
increasing age was shown to correlate with increasingly anterior positions of the c7 plumb line [ 10 , 11 , 15 ] .
fon et al .
[ 16 ] and schwab et al .
[ 15 ] proposed that the incidence of thoracic kyphosis ( tk ) increases with age .
youngbae et al .
[ 17 ] hypothesized that the increase in tk is a fundamental change that occurs during aging .
however , other studies [ 10 , 11 ] did not support this hypothesis .
gelb et al .
[ 11 ] reported that tk did not correlate with age in healthy older individuals , despite significant losses in lumbar lordosis ( ll ) and sva .
the pelvic incidence ( pi ) is unique to each individual and independent of the spatial alignment of the pelvis .
the pi reflects the anatomy of the pelvis and does not change with pelvic or spine positioning [ 10 , 18 - 21 ] .
pi is an important anatomic parameter that reflects the anatomic configuration of the pelvis and greatly affects sagittal spino - pelvic alignment ( sspa ) .
pi - ll has been considered to be a useful indicator in intraoperative planning of lumbar deformity operation [ 19 , 22 , 23 ] .
pi - ll is significantly correlated with clinical parameters .
schwab et al. recommend that pi - ll should be corrected to less than 10degrees to achieve successful , harmonious spino - pelvic realignment in corrective operation of spinal deformity [ 19 ] .
recently , it has become possible to achieve optimal spinal alignment with the development of spinal operation techniques .
there have been some reports regarding the normal values of sspa [ 11 , 24 - 27 ] .
in addition , the optimal postoperative sspa can be evaluated during preoperative surgical planning of spinal realignment based on these reported parameters [ 19 , 28 ] .
however , most of our previous studies were performed using caucasian populations in the united states and european countries .
the effect of ethnicity on skeletal growth has been demonstrated by previous studies [ 29 , 30 ] .
age and sex are also reported to be associated with spino - pelvic alignment [ 31 , 32 ] .
recently , some studies were conducted to evaluate the normal sspa in asian populations [ 33 - 35 ] .
however , the number of participants was small , and only young adults were evaluated in these studies .
the present study sought to establish the normal values of spino - pelvic alignment and to clarify the impact of age - related changes using large , community - based cohorts .
materials and methods participants under the approval of our institutional review board , the present study , titled the wakayama spine study , was performed with a sub - cohort of the third visit of the research on osteoarthritis / osteoporosis against disability ( road ) study , which was initiated as a nationwide , prospective study of bone and joint diseases in population - based cohorts .
a detailed profile of the road cohort has been previously reported [ 36 , 37 ] .
in brief , subjects included participants of the third visit of the road study , which began in 2012 and completed in 2013 .
in addition to the former participants , inhabitants of the mountainous and coastal areas in the wakayama prefecture who were willing to participate in the road survey were also included in the third visit .
overall , 1575 individuals ( 513 men , 1062 women ) participated in the third visit of the road study .
among 1575 participants , 114 individuals who could not maintain a standing position while undergoing total lateral whole - spine radiography or had other disqualifiers were excluded .
finally , lateral whole - spine radiographs were available for 1461 participants ( 466 men , 995 women ) .
participants were divided into five groups based on birth - year decade : ( 1 ) less than 50 years , ( 2 ) 50 - 59 years , ( 3 ) 60 - 69 years , ( 4 ) 70 - 79 years , and ( 5 ) 80 years and older .
all individuals provided written informed consent .
radiographic evaluation all participants underwent radiography .
for each subject , standing lateral radiography of the whole spine and pelvis was taken using 40 - inch film .
each radiograph was aligned such that the edge of the film was the reference for vertical alignment .
as described previously [ 34 ] , participants were instructed to stand in a comfortable position , with their hips and knees fully extended .
the arms were flexed with the hands resting on supports at the level of their shoulders .
on the radiographs , the following parameters were measured : tk ( the cobb angle from the upper endplate of t2 to the lower endplate of t12 ) [ 16 ] , ll ( the cobb angle from the upper endplate of l1 to the lower endplate of s1 ) [ 23 ] , pelvic tilt ( pt ) ( the angle between the line connecting the midpoint of the sacral plate to the axis of the femoral heads and the vertical axis ) [ 19 ] , pi ( the angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral plate at its midpoint and the line connecting this point to the axis of the femoral heads ) [ 24 ] , and sva ( the horizontal distance from the c7 plumb line originating at the middle of the c7 vertebral body to the posterior superior endplate of s1 ) [ 19 ] .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using jmp ( version 8 ; sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
all values are expressed as the mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
the wilcoxon signed - rank test was used to analyze the differences in spinal and pelvic parameters between men and women .
the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( r ) was used to examine correlations between variables of spino - pelvic parameters .
the spearman correlation coefficient was interpreted as follows : < 0.3 : none ; 0.31 - 0.5 : weak ; 0.51 - 0.7 : strong ; 0.71 - 0.9 : very strong ; and > 0.9 : excellent .
finally , we analyzed the relationship between age and spino - pelvic parameters .
therefore , we entered values for the body mass index ( bmi ) , sva , tk , and pi - ll into a multiple regression model to adjust for potential confounding factors .
the variance inflation factor ( vif ) was used to check for multicollinearity in the model .
the level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 .
results radiographic studies were completed for 1461 participants ( 466 men , 995 women ) whose age range was 19 - 94 years ( mean age : men , 66.3 +/ - 13.8 years ; women , 65.2 +/ - 12.5 years ) .

the vif values in men for bmi , sva , tk , and pi - ll were 1.04 , 1.76 , 1.45 , and 2.13 , respectively ; those in women were 1.02 , 2.27 , 1.42 , and 2.52 , respectively .
however , none of the vif values exceeded 10 , which indicates that there was no collinearity in the model [ 38 ] .
on the basis of the results of this model , we found that all parameters were significantly associated with age in men and women .
the standardized partial regression coefficients of sva , tk , and pi - ll were 0.17 , 0.30 , and 0.23 , respectively , in men and 0.29 , 0.32 , and 0.23 , respectively , in women .
pt had a high collinearity with other parameters , and it was excluded from tables 4 and 5 .

in addition , the rate of increase in tk and decrease in ll was larger in women than in men , although the mean values of these parameters were within the generally accepted normal ranges [ 39 - 41 ] .
fon et al. reported that the degree of kyphosis increased with age , and the rate of increase was higher in women than in men [ 16 ] .
this observation has been widely observed since increased tk is often related to osteoporotic compression wedging of the vertebrae , as well as to the degenerative change of intervertebral discs and decreased strength of back extensor muscles in the aged spine [ 42 - 51 ] .
this degenerative change can also contribute to decreased ll [ 52 ] .
gelb et al. investigated 100 asymptomatic middle and older aged volunteers , and they found a correlation among the sva , ll , and age [ 11 ] .
these findings were supported by hammerberg and wood , whose study surveyed 50 asymptomatic volunteers aged 70 - 85 years [ 10 ] .
the aforementioned correlation between spino - pelvic parameters and age may explain physiological aging of the spine .
the center of gravity line moves forward in relation to increasing age [ 15 ] , which may result in pain , functional disability , and loss of horizontal gaze due to the stooped posture .
in an attempt to correct this position that interferes with the social standard of maintaining a horizontal gaze , the pelvis should be tilted backward [ 53 ] .
the impact of sex on spino - pelvic parameters remains controversial .
vialle et al. reported significant differences in ll and pi between male and female subjects [ 27 ] .
in addition , zhu et al. found a significant sex difference in ll [ 34 ] .
conversely , other researchers did not demonstrate significant sex differences in any spino - pelvic parameter [ 32 , 33 , 54 ] .
although there were statistically significant differences in tk , ll , pt , and pi between men and women in the current study , the difference in the mean value of each parameter was quite small .
additionally , the individual variations were much larger than were the sex differences .
when considering clinically important differences , further study should be performed to corroborate this finding .
recently , there have been some reports to support racial differences in sagittal spino - pelvic parameters [ 30 ] , and most of them have exaggerated the smaller pi and ll in asian populations than in caucasian populations [ 33 - 35 ] .
however , our cohort did not have a significantly smaller pi than did the caucasian population , which is consistent with the japanese epidemiological study by takeda et al. [ 55 ] , which reported a pi of 55.8 +/ - 10.6 .
there may be regional differences in sagittal spino - pelvic parameters as well .
therefore , there must be strong correlations among spino - pelvic parameters .
legaya et al. reported that pi is a fundamental pelvic parameter for three - dimensional regulation of spinal sagittal curves , and it correlates with ll [ 24 ] .
in addition , mac - thiong et al. demonstrated a moderate correlation ( 0.3 <= r < 0.5 ) between tk and ll [ 56 ] .
our results also suggested strong correlations between the sva and pi - ll , as well as weak correlations between tk and pi - ll. to achieve harmonized , spino - pelvic alignment in surgical planning for spinal deformity , the pi - ll value was used to determine the amount of correction needed .
in a recent study , a more excessive pi - ll mismatch was shown to indicate an increased risk of spinal imbalance [ 23 ] .
results of multiple regression analysis also demonstrated that the sva , tk , and pi - ll are related to age .
indeed , the pi - ll value increased with age .
a longitudinal study would be required to assess the age - related changes of the sagittal spino - pelvic parameters accurately .
moreover , evaluation of the alignment of the cervical spine and / or lower extremities should be included since they also definitively show age - related changes and affect spino - pelvic alignment .
recently , more researchers have focused on spino - pelvic alignment because of the increasing number of adult patients in the aging society with back pain related to spinal malalignment .
however , to the best of our knowledge , the current study , compared to previous studies , makes use of the largest cohort ( more than 1,500 volunteers ) from general populations with a wide range of ages .
in doing so , we were able to better understand age - related and sex - related normal values of spino - pelvic sagittal alignment , although the study was performed in limited districts .
thus , we believe that this study 's findings may help improve the treatment of patients with adult spinal deformity .
conclusions we found that all parameters were significantly associated with age in men and women .
the sva , tk , and pt increased with age , and ll decreased with age .
additionally , a more excessive pi - ll mismatch was shown to indicate an increased risk of spinal malalignment .
results of multiple regression analysis also demonstrated that the sva , tk , and pi - ll are related to age .
indeed , the pi - ll value increased with age .

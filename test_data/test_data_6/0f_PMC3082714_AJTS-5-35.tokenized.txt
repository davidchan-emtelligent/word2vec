general objective : to assess the practice of blood conservation .
specific objectives : to determine the methods of blood conservation in use , to assess the lower limit for hemoglobin for elective procedures , to determine transfusion trigger point in practice , to find out limitations in practice and ways to improve clinical practice .
materials and methods : this was conducted in february 2009 .
self - administered questionnaires were distributed among the surgeons and anesthetists in practice at the university of nigeria teaching hospital , enugu state university teaching hospital , ebonyi state university teaching hospital and national orthopaedic hospital , enugu .
the data gathered was analyzed using the spss software .
results : : of participants who agreed to fill the questionnaires , more than 50 % were males .
the most prevalent specialty was general surgery ( 24.2 %) , followed by orthopedics ( 22.6 %) , obstetrics and gynecology ( 20.7 %) , and anesthesia ( 17.7 %) .
the lowest hemoglobin limit before the patient was allowed into the theatre for elective procedures was 10 g / dl while individual transfusion trigger points ranged from hemoglobin of 6 to 10 g / dl. majority of the doctors would avoid homologous blood transfusion in order to avoid transfusion - related diseases and reaction .
regarding knowledge of blood conservation methods and means of avoiding homologous blood , the use of diathermy was highest ( 12.33 %) , followed by preoperative blood donation ( 11.87 %) , use of hematinics ( 10.96 %) , and tourniquet 10.5 % .
also , in practice , diathermy was the most frequently used ( 18.69 %) , followed by preoperative blood donation ( 16.16 %) , use of tourniquet ( 15.15 %) , while the ovadje cell saver was least with 0.01 % .
suggestions from respondents on the ways of limiting transfusion - related problems included optimization of patients ( 24.5 %) , improvement of standard of living ( 17.7 %) , and personnel training ( 13.3 %) .
conclusion : there is an agreement with the global trend geared toward minimizing the use of homologous blood by doctors in these hospitals .
however , our practice must continually be refined by continuing medical education in order to keep everyone informed of changes in practice .
the government must improve the quality of service by the provision of unavailable infrastructure .
auotologous blood blood conservation minimize homologous transfusion introduction during the perioperative period , substantial blood loss may be common and may render patients anemic. [ 1 ] transfusion of allogenic blood may be a life - saver intraoperatively but is now considered undesirable by healthcare professionals due to concerns about transmission of viral infections. [ 2 3 ] the importance of blood conservation in order to limit the use of homologous blood is well accepted worldwide. [ 4 ] a successful program to this end should involve an integrated approach that begins with preoperative patient preparation , acute normovolemic hemodilution , improvement of surgical skills , as well as ways of limiting blood loss .
this would include the use of diathermy , hypotensive anesthesia among others. [ 5 ] this study was designed to examine the practice of blood conservation among doctors in some government - owned tertiary hospitals .
developing nations may lack manpower as well as infrastructure ; thus , areas of deficiency may need to be outlined .
as blood transfusion practices are being re - examined and redefined , are we doing enough for our patients ?
materials and methods self - administered questionnaires were distributed among the surgeons and anesthetists in practice at the university of nigeria teaching hospital , ituku - ozalla , national orthopaedic hospital enugu , enugu state university of technology teaching hospital , enugu , and ebonyi state university teaching hospital abakaliki .
the returned questionnaires were subjected to analysis using the spss software .
results sixty - eight participants who were approached agreed to fill the questionnaires .
the age range of the respondents was 20 - 69 and 30 - 39 years age group was predominant .
more than 50 % were males .
most of the respondents specialized in general surgery ( 24.2 %) , followed by orthopedics ( 22.6 %) , obstetrics and gynecology ( 20.7 %) , and anesthesia ( 17.7 %) [ figure 1 ] .
thirty - one ( 45.6 %) doctors had practiced for 1 - 5 years while nine ( 13.2 %) had put in 16 - 25 years in practice [ figure 2 ] .
a larger percentage of the respondents were from the university of nigeria teaching hospital ( 43.3 %) , followed by ebonyi state university teaching hospital ( 26.1 %) , the national orthopaedic hospital enugu ( 17.4 %) , and the least number was from the enugu state university of technology teaching hospital ( 13.2 %) .
the lowest hemoglobin limit before the patient was allowed into the theater was commonly 10 g / dl [ figure 3 ] .
fewer doctors would allow a patient of hemoglobin level of 8 g / dl into the theater for elective procedures .
requests for blood before surgery continue to feature , though some respondents would not request for blood to be available prior to surgery .
during this study , it was discovered that not all the respondents knew the internationally accepted trigger before a patient should be transfused [ figure 4 ] .
even among those who knew the internationally accepted trigger point , not all practiced it as individual transfusion trigger points ranged from hemoglobin of 6 - 10 g / dl. figure 1 area of specialization figure 2 years of practice figure 3 graph of hemoglobin limit before scheduling for surgery versus frequency of request for blood figure 4 knowledge of international versus personal trigger level majority of the doctors would avoid homologous blood transfusion in order to avoid transfusion - related diseases and reaction .
on the safety of the screening of blood , the larger groups were not satisfied with it but had no choice but to accept the method available .
the respondents would , however , check the screening label just before transfusion or request for rescreening the morning of or the day before the scheduled surgery .
concerning the knowledge of various methods of blood conservation and limiting homologous blood transfusion , the use of diathermy accounted mostly 12.33 % followed by preoperative blood donation 11.87 % , use of hematinics 10.96 % , and tourniquet 10.5 % [ figure 5 ] .
the use of antihelminthics scored 9.5 % , acute normovolemic hemodilution had 9.59 % , good nutrition 9.59 % , hypotensive anesthesia 6.39 % , cell salvage , erythropoietin , and acute hypervolemic hemodilution 5.02 % , while the use of the ovadje cell saver had 4.11 % .
however in practice , diathermy was the most frequently used 18.69 % , followed by preoperative blood donation 16.16 % , use of tourniquet 15.15 % , while the ovadje cell saver was least with 0.01 % frequency of use [ figure 6 ] .
greater than 50 % practiced what they did based on the availability of materials , 10 % based on ease of practice , 15 % on effectiveness , and 20 % on the need to prevent infections .
preponderant suggestions from respondents with the aim of limiting transfusion - related problems included optimization of patients ( 24.5 %) , improvement of standard of living ( 17.7 %) , and personnel training ( 13.3 %) .
figure 5 pie chart showing knowledge of means of blood conservation and limiting of homologous transfusion figure 6 bar chart showing reason for use of blood conservation method discussion there is a consensus that we need to minimize homologous blood transfusion during surgery. [ 4 ] concerns about the cost and safety of allogenic blood transfusion include the risk of transferring viral infections and immunosuppression .
these mandate that doctors be amenable to change and be cognizant of these changes in practice with the aim of delivering competent care. [ 6 ] the study revealed that the greater percentage of the doctors were cognizant of these changes but were hampered by availability of infrastructure .
according to massenet et al. , a serious problem of hiv contamination at undetected levels exists. [ 7 ] mbanga et al.in their study revealed that 50 % of patients who received homologous blood had an unfavorable outcome : 40 % of these had febrile reactions , while 19 % had urticaria and 14 % died from transfusion - related events. [ 8 ] factors mediating against safe blood transfusion practice include lack of knowledge among donorsand inferior quality of blood. [ 9 ] refinements in and new approaches to blood conservation including development of transfusion practice standards and improvement in surgical skills are thus needed .
techniques for minimizing blood loss should be started preoperatively .
good nutrition , treatment of helminthiasis especially in children , use of hematinics are important .
massenett et al. have called for prevention and treatment of anemia from dietary deficiency as have doctors in this study .
this is because preoperative optimization of the patient 's hemoglobin level features greatly in limiting blood transfusion. [ 7 ] the use of recombinant erythropoietin , epoetin alfa , has also contributed to a reduction in the use of allogenic blood. [ 10 ] this unfortunately is not available in our environment .
patients undergoing elective surgeries can donate their own blood for use especially when the probability for transfusion is high .
preoperative autologous donation is a cost - effective way of preventing homologous transfusion. [ 11 ] in a study by magoha et al. , patient deposit of blood was sufficient to meet their needs and saving one patient who needed augmentation with homologous blood. [ 12 ] preoperative donation of blood by patients or close relatives featured prominently in practice acute normo / hypervolemic hemodilution can be used to reduce the need for homologous blood .
this relies on the premise that reduction in red cell concentration would lead to a reduction in total red cell loss during surgical procedures .
in a study by daves et al. , hemodilution has been found to be better than cell salvage and is practiced by doctors in our environment. [ 13 ] blood salvage and reinfusion are widely used where blood loss is appreciable. [ 14 ] the associated problems include unavailability of the machine in the centers studied as well as a risk of septic contamination .
the ovadje cell saver , which would have been accessible as a local product , is however not available .
blood management in surgical procedure should include reduction of perioperative blood loss .
this can be obtained by the use of diathermy , tourniquet , hypotensive anesthesia , and antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid and desmopressin .
oginni et al. have demonstrated the usefulness of tourniquet even among sickle cell patients. [ 15 ] the use of diathermy and tourniquet features prominently among the respondents .
conclusion doctors in the governmental hospitals in the south - eastern region of nigeria consider it worthwhile pursuing efforts to de - emphasize homologous blood transfusion while emphasizing blood conservation strategies .
informed selection of alternatives based on preoperative assessment of hematological status and estimation of blood loss would enhance best management practices in surgery and anesthesia .
we , however , need provision of cell savers by the government especially for surgeries where blood loss is appreciable .

female genital mutilation / cutting ( fgm / c ) comprises different practices involving cutting , pricking , removing and sometimes sewing up external female genitalia for non - medical reasons .
the practice of fgm / c is highly concentrated in a band of african countries from the atlantic coast to the horn of africa , in areas of the middle east such as iraq and yemen , and in some countries in asia like indonesia .
girls exposed to fgm / c are at risk of immediate physical consequences such as severe pain , bleeding , and shock , difficulty in passing urine and faeces , and sepsis .
long - term consequences can include chronic pain and infections .
fgm / c is a deeply entrenched social norm , perpetrated by families for a variety of reasons , but the results are harmful .
fgm / c is a human rights issue that affects girls and women worldwide .
the practice is decreasing , due to intensive advocacy activities of international , national , and grassroots agencies .
an adolescent girl today is about a third less likely to be cut than 30 years ago .
however , the rates of abandonment are not high enough , and change is not happening as rapidly as necessary .
multiple interventions have been implemented , but the evidence base on what works is lacking .
we in reproductive health must work harder to find strategies to help communities and families abandon these harmful practices .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 more than 200,000,000 girls and woman have undergone female genital mutilation and cutting ( fgm / c ) in 30 high prevalence countries , mainly in africa , south asia , and the middle east .
it is estimated that 30 million girls under the age of 15 are at risk of fgm / c over the next decade [ 1 ] .
national surveys show that prevalence varies widely between and within countries ; however , over half of the 200,000,000 girls / women with fgm / c live in indonesia , egypt , and ethiopia .
44 million are girls below age 15 .
in most of the countries , the majority of girls were cut before age 5 ; in yemen , 85 per cent of girls experienced the practice within their first week of life [ 1 ] .
available data from large - scale representative surveys show that the practice of fgm / c is highly concentrated in a band of african countries from the atlantic coast to the horn of africa , in areas of the middle east such as iraq and yemen , and in some countries in asia like indonesia [ 2 ] .
however , fgm / c is a human rights issue that affects girls and women worldwide .
evidence suggests that fgm / c exists in some places in south america such as colombia [ 3 ] and elsewhere in the world including in india [ 4 ] , malaysia [ 5 ] , oman [ 6 ] , saudi arabia [ 7 ] , and the united arab emirates [ 8 ] , with large variations in terms of the type performed , circumstances surrounding the practice and size of the affected population groups [ 1 ] .
the practice is also found in pockets of europe , australia and north america , which , for the last several decades , have been destinations for migrants from countries where the practice still occurs [ 1 ]. by 2050 , nearly 1 in 3 births worldwide will occur in the 30 countries in africa and the middle east where fgm / c is concentrated , and nearly 500 million more girls and women will be living in these countries than there are today .
in somalia alone , where fgm / c prevalence stands at 98 per cent , the number of girls and women will more than double .
in mali , where prevalence is 89 per cent , the female population will nearly triple [ 1 ] .
fgm / c is a deeply entrenched social norm .
communities practice fgm / c in the belief that it will ensure a girl 's proper marriage , chastity , beauty or family honour .
some also associate it with religious beliefs , although no religious scriptures require it. the practice is such a powerful social norm that families have their daughters cut even when they are aware of the harm it can cause .
if families were to stop practicing on their own they would risk the marriage prospects of their daughter as well as the family 's status [ 9 ] .
fgm / c comprises different practices involving cutting , pricking , removing and sometimes sewing up external female genitalia for non - medical reasons .
who has broadly classified the types of procedure performed into four categories ; type 1 , clitoridectomy , involves partial or total removal of the clitoris and / or the prepuce .
type 2 , excision , involves partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora , with or without excision of the labia majora .
type 3 , infibulation , involves narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and / or the labia majora , with or without excision of the clitoris .
infibulation is considered the most invasive type of fgm / c. defibulation , opening of the covering seal , is often necessary prior to childbirth .
reinfibulation refers to the recreation of an infibulation after defibulation .
type 4 , other , involves all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non - medical purposes , for example : pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterizing [ 2 ] .
for the vast majority of girls a traditional practitioner , usually a woman , performs fgm / c often without any form of anaesthesia or analgesia using non - sterile instruments such as scissors , razor blades or broken glass [ 10 , 11 ] .
while in some places the practice has been medicalized , to reduce health risks , fgm / c is always traumatic , and may be associated with a series of health risks with short - and long - term consequences .
girls exposed to fgm / c are at risk of immediate physical consequences such as severe pain , bleeding , and shock , difficulty in passing urine and faeces , and infections .
long term consequences can include chronic pain and infections [ 12 ] .
in general , the consequences are similar for fgm / c type i , ii , and iii , but they tend to be more severe and more prevalent the more extensive the procedure [ 12 ] .
a systematic review of the health complications of fgm / c identified a range of obstetrical problems , the most common being prolonged labour and / or obstruction , episiotomies and perineal tears , post partum haemorrhage , and maternal and foetal death [ 13 ] .
a study investigating 28,393 women attending 28 obstetric centres in several african countries concluded that women with fgm / c are significantly more likely than intact women to have adverse obstetric outcomes such as a caesarean section , postpartum haemorrhage , extended maternal hospital stay , infant resuscitation , stillbirth or early neonatal death , and low birthweight .
fgm is estimated to lead to an extra one to two perinatal deaths per 100 deliveries [ 14 ] .
consequences are graded according to the type of fgm .
for many girls and women , undergoing fgm / c is a traumatic experience that leaves a lasting psychological mark and may adversely affect their mental health .
in fact , several psychological and psychosomatic disorders such as disordered eating and sleeping habits have been attributed to fgm / c. disordered eating habits include loss of appetite , weight loss or excessive weight gain , and disordered sleeping habits include sleeplessness and recurring nightmares [ 15 ] .
there are also reports of posttraumatic stress disorder , anxiety , depression , and memory loss associated with fgm / c [ 12 ] .
fgm / c is recognized as a harmful practice which violates the human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - of girls and women [ 12 ] .
further , fgm / c is a stark manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination " related to the historical subjugation and suppression on women " [ 16 ]. by extension , it is hypothesized that changing beliefs about women 's rights is a key to its abandonment [ 12 ] ; with the united nations general assembly ( 2012 ) , the un commission on the status of women ( 2010 ) , the african union and the european union ( 2011 - 2012 ) and national governments calling for intensified global efforts to support the abandonment / elimination of fgm / c [ 17 , 18 ] .
in september 2015 , the sustainable development goals were created , fgm / c elimination was included under goal 5 , to eliminate harmful practices , including child , early and forced marriage and fgm / c [ 19 ] .
change is slow , but occurring , and globally rates are decreasing .
overall , an adolescent girl today is about a third less likely to be cut than 30 years ago .
kenya and tanzania have seen rates drop to a third of their levels three decades ago through a combination of community activism and legislation .
in the central african republic , iraq , liberia and nigeria , prevalence has dropped by as much as half .
attitudes are also changing : recent data show that the majority of people in the countries where fgm is practiced believe it should end , but continue to compel their daughters to undergo the procedure because of strong social pressure [ 1 ] .
countries , communities , and individuals go through transitional stages in terms of desire to adhere to fgm / c , to contemplate abandoning the practice , and to abandon the practice .
the readiness to abandon fgm / c varies across and within countries .
for example , somalia is a country with a high prevalence ( 98 %) and strong desire to adhere to the practice ; in egypt , two - thirds of women want to adhere , but almost one - quarter want to abandon ; in nigeria , almost equal proportions ( about 40 %) want to adhere and to abandon respectively , with 14 % " reluctantly adhering " , and 13 % contemplating abandonment [ 20 ] .
globally , the rate of decline is inadequate to prevent large numbers of girls from fgm / c. a 2009 systematic review on effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of fgm / c , identified 3,667 publications on the topic ; only six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria [ 21 ] .
all studies were controlled before - and - after studies conducted in africa , burkina faso , egypt , ethiopia / kenya , mali , nigeria , and senegal .
collectively , the studies involved 6,803 participants at entry .
all studies compared an intervention with no intervention ( except one which included an education module ) .
there was great variation in prevalence , ethnicity , religion , and education in the settings .
two of the interventions were directed at the individual level , and four at the community level .
the first individually - based study consisted of educational activities delivered to health personnel in mali , who learned about context and local rationale of fgm / c as well as the different types of fgm / c and its health complications .
the other individually - based study took place in egypt and involved female university students , who received information about reproductive health , including fgm / c. the multifaceted , community - based intervention in kenya was delivered in a somali refugee camp , and six village communities in ethiopia received a nearly identical intervention , consisting of community meetings , theatre performances , video sessions , and mass media activities .
in nigeria , multifaceted community activities , including multimedia and gender equity action plan development , were delivered at three community levels .
a community empowerment intervention took place first in senegal and subsequentially replicated in burkina faso .
it consisted of educational sessions in human rights , problem solving , environmental hygiene , and women 's health .
the most frequently reported outcomes of the projects were changes in beliefs / attitudes , knowledge / awareness , and intentions concerning fgm / c. less frequently reported outcomes were self - reported prevalence , behaviours such as talking to others about fgm / c , perceptions regarding spouse 's disapproval of fgm / c , and participants' regrets of having had their daughters cut .
the effect estimates suggest that 1 ) training health personnel likely produced no effects in knowledge or beliefs / attitudes about fgm / c ; 2 ) educating female students may possibly have led to a small increase in knowledge / awareness about fgm / c ; 3 ) multifaceted community activities may possibly have increased the proportion of participants having favourable knowledge and intentions about fgm / c ; 4 ) community empowerment through education may possibly have positively affected prevalence of fgm / c , participants' knowledge about the consequences of fgm / c , and regrets about having had their daughters cut .
however , the authors stated that low quality of the body of evidence affects the interpretation of results [ 21 , 22 ] .
an impressive range of documented programmatic , research and policy interventions are being implemented to encourage communities , families , and / or individuals to abandon fgm / c , led by a range of national and international non - governmental organization ( ngos ) ; health , human rights and legal organizations ; women 's organizations ; un agencies ; and immigrant and refugee service organizations .
the main intervention strategies have either been framed as multi - faceted or as standalone activities and have encompassed advocacy / education interventions to community , political and religious leaders , legislative interventions , capacity building interventions , health care interventions , media interventions , and community dialogue .
there remains much to learn from the decades of interventions completed and those currently underway .
one important lesson has been that single issue approaches will not eliminate fgm / c , given the diversity of practicing communities ; rather community specific , multi - faceted programming that responds to the dynamism of individuals , groups and communities ; recognizes the varied patterns of decision - making and the combined influences of education , the economy , politics , law , religion and social environments will be better positioned to inform efforts towards fgm / c abandonment .
lastly , efforts need to be linked to strengthening women 's reproductive and sexual rights .
historically low levels of funding for fgm / c research has meant that evidence - based knowledge about which combinations and sequences of interventions have had the most impact on behaviour change , through which causal pathways , and which demonstrate the potential for sustainable focused strategies is lacking .
further , given the contextually specific findings in which fhm / c occurs makes generalizations difficult .
the lack of theory - based interventions ; the existence of data with poor validity because of limited methodological development ; and the fragmented documentation of research uptake and use for policy and programming are all obstacles to be overcome [ 21 , 22 ] .
there are multiple grassroots , community , women 's , human rights ' , legal , governmental , ngo , and research groups working to stop fgm / c. emerging work by the population council , a new york based international ngo , is seeking to strengthen the evidence base on fgm / c with rigorous research in several areas including : understanding fgm / c drivers , determinants , and trends across a range of contexts .
understanding the implementation processes and assessing the effects of types of fgm / c abandonment interventions , their wider impacts on girls' and women 's lives , and their sustainability improving understanding of the wider impacts of fgm / c and the potential for fgm / c abandonment interventions to impact more broadly on girls , women , their families and communities .
improving the measurement of fgm / c status , prevalence , norms and norms changes [ 23 ] .
the efforts to end fgm / c is global and slowly making progress , but the rates of abandonment are not high enough , and change is not happening as rapidly as necessary .
we in the field of reproductive health must work harder to find methods to help communities and families abandon this harmful practice , which violates girls' human rights and often leaves them physically and emotionally traumatized .

we report the case of a child affected by prader - willi syndrome ( pws ) with good cognitive performances and without relevant behavioral abnormalities .
the diagnosis of pws , suspected on the basis of clinical features and past history , was confirmed by dna methylation analysis .
additional genetic testing revealed a maternal uniparental disomy .
intellectual profile was analyzed by wisc - iii and raven 's progressive matrices cpm , while the behavior was evaluated by k - sads - pl and child behavior checklist / 4 - 18 to the parents .
wisc - iii test showed a total intelligence quotient ( t - iq = 79 ) at the border level for age .
the verbal intelligence quotient ( v - iq ) showed a lower score than the performance intelligence quotient ( p - iq ) ( 78 and 85 , respectively ) .
raven 's matrices cpm showed an intelligence level at 75 - 90degrees percentile for age .
concerning behavioral evaluation , a difficulty in impulse control was observed , with persistent but controllable search for food , without a clear psychopathological meaning .
also according to k - sads - pl no areas of psychopathological dimensions were detected .
in conclusion , in presence of consisting clinical features of pws and high diagnostic suspicion , the diagnosis of pws should be considered even in presence of a borderline iq and in absence of psychopathological abnormalities .
prader - willi syndrome uniparental disomy ( upd ) cognitive profile behavior intellectual quotient ( iq ) background prader - willi syndrome ( pws ) is a complex genetic disorder , characterized by endocrine , neurologic , cognitive and behavioral abnormalities .
prevalence is about 1 / 15.000 - 30.000 [ 1 ] , without differences among genders and ethnic groups .
infants with pws show marked hypotonia , early feeding problems , difficulty in weight gain , dysmorphic features and genital abnormalities .
during childhood , patients develop hyperphagia , morbid obesity , short stature , hypogonadism , global development delay , cognitive and behavioral disorders .
pws is caused by the lack of expression of paternally derived alleles of imprinted genes located in the 15q11 - q13 chromosome region ; these genes are physiologically silenced on the maternally inherited chromosome .
genetic defects responsible for pws are ' de novo ' deletion in the paternal chromosome in 70 - 75 % of patients , maternal uniparental disomy ( upd ) in 20 - 25 % of patients , and imprinting center defects in the remaining 1 - 5 % of cases .
diagnosis can be suspected from clinical features and confirmed by genetic testing .
dna methylation analysis is the initial investigation ; if positive , additional testing ( fish , karyotype and dna polymorphism analysis ) should be performed on the proband and parents to distinguish the genetic subtype and perform appropriate genetic counseling [ 2,3 ] .
we report a case of a child affected by prader - willi syndrome ( pws ) with cognitive performances slightly different from the classical intellectual functioning observed in these patients , and without relevant behavioral abnormalities .
case presentation we describe the case of a.m. , 8 years old child , who lived in venezuela for the first 7 years of life , before moving to italy .
clinical history is characterized by hypotonia , poor suck and cryptorchidism at birth , and successively by motor delay .
he practiced physiotherapy with improvement of motor activity .
cryptorchidism was corrected by orchidopexy .
since the age of 2 years , he started to increase his daily caloric intake and became progressively obese .
a.m. was referred to our outpatient clinic at the age of 7 years for severe obesity with a body mass index ( bmi ) of 30.6 kg / m2 ( weight : 42 kg ; height : 117 cm ) .
he also presented low forehead , almond - shaped eyes , thin upper lip , high - arched palate , small hands , tapering fingers and hepatomegaly .
blood exams were normal .
an abdomen ultrasound scan revealed the presence of fatty liver disease .
eeg and ocular fundus were normal .
the clinical features and his history led to suspect pws , confirmed by dna methylation analysis .
additional genetic testing revealed a maternal uniparental disomy ( upd ) .
physiatrist evaluation highlighted the presence of a normal motor activity , not needing physiotherapy .
intellectual profile was analyzed by wisc - iii and raven 's progressive matrices cpm , while the behavior was evaluated by k - sads - pl and child behavior checklist / 4 - 18 to the parents ( table 1 ) .
there was n't any cognitive impairment , speech was fluent , articulate , it was also evident the presence of bilingualism ( italian and spanish languages ) , good interpersonal and appropriate adaptive skills to the context of assessing .
a good contact with reality and a good space - time orientation emerged .
obesity management was assessed by the institution of a well - balanced low - calories diet and by an appropriate psychological and behavioral counseling of the patient and family .
the patient showed a good dietetic compliance and he managed to keep under control hunger .
indeed , after a twelve months follow - up , we observed a significant weight loss , with a decrease of bmi from 30.6 to 22.3 kg / m2 .
finally , despite the change of socio - cultural environment , familiar and social relationships were satisfying , and the school placement was adequate ( he was learning a third language !) .

pws patients usually present learning disabilities , poor school performance , temper tantrums , and psychotic disorders , increasing with age and bmi [ 1 ] .
indeed , several studies on large samples of pws patients report the presence of a global intellectual abilities impairment of these children .
however , according to recent studies , about 10 - 25 % of pws patients show normal or borderline levels of intellectual functioning [ 4,5 ] .
wisc - iii test administered to our patient showed a total intelligence quotient ( t - iq = 79 ) at the border level for age .
the verbal intelligence quotient ( v - iq ) showed a lower score than the performance intelligence quotient ( p - iq ) ( respectively 78 and 85 ) , probably depending on the adaptation to the new socio - cultural context .
according to this hypothesis , the sub - tests " vocabulary " and " comprehension " of the verbal score , strongly related to the learning of a new language , showed slightly low scores ( table 2 ) .
the performance profile , however , showed mild difficulties in sustained attention and visual - motor dexterity by subtests " coding " and " symbol search " ( table 2 ) , but globally the level of performance remained within the normal range .
in order to remove the confounding socio - cultural factors , intellectual assessment was integrated by raven 's matrices cpm , which showed an intelligence level at 75 - 90degrees percentile for age .

concerning behavioral evaluation , a difficulty in impulse control was observed , with persistent but controllable search for food , without a clear psychopathological meaning .
according to k - sads - pl and cbcl to parents , no areas of psychopathological dimensions were detected .
however , it is to be considered the risk of a bias in the parents information because the hope of a normal development of their child could lead them to minimize the symptoms .
in addition , it is important to remark that our patient is a child and the risk of behavioral and psychopathological abnormalities mainly increases in adolescents and young adults affected by pws [ 6 ] .
since many studies have claimed the presence of a genotype - phenotype correlation in pws , we hypothesized that the border intellectual and behavioral profile of our patient could be related to the genetics .
in literature , many studies underline the presence of differences in cognitive and behavioral aspects between patients with different genetic subtypes .
concerning the cognitive aspects , most studies have not found significant differences between " deletion " and " upd " genotypes in t - iq [ 5,7 ] , while differences have been noted in v - iq and p - iq. indeed , the " deletion genotype " is associated with better p - iq scores , while the " upd genotype " with better v - iq scores [ 4,7 - 9 ] .
however , our patient showed a v - iq lower than p - iq despite carrying a " upd genotype " .
we believe that this result was related to the acquisition of a new language after migration from venezuela .
concerning the behavioral aspects , the " deletion genotype " has been associated more frequently with self - injurious skin picking and obsessive - compulsive and ritualistic behaviors [ 8,10 ] , while the " upd genotype " has been associated with a higher risk of autistic spectrum and psychotic disorders [ 11,12 ] .
moreover , patients carrying upd seem to have less maladaptive behaviors compared to patients with deletions .
our patient did not show relevant behavioral abnormalities so far , but this cannot be interpreted as a probe that he could evolve to a complete autonomous normality in adolescence and young age .
moreover , given the reported association of " upd genotype " with autistic spectrum and psychotic disorders , a special attention will be addressed to these aspects in the follow - up of our patient .
conclusions pws is a complex genetic disorder usually characterized by a global intellectual abilities impairment , learning disabilities , poor school performance .
although most of pws patients show mild to moderate retardation , a lower percentage of about 10 - 25 % displays a normal or borderline functioning , as in the case described .
in addition , pws includes behavioral and psychopathological abnormalities that mainly increase in adolescence and young age .
in light of these observations , we conclude that , in patients with suggestive clinical features and history , diagnosis of pws should be considered even in presence of a normal or borderline iq and in absence of a clear psychopathological profile , particularly when the patient under examination is still a child .
on contrary , in order to avoid unnecessary expensive and stressful diagnostic investigations , it is important to carefully evaluate all the clinical features of the patient , to integrate clinical evaluations of all the physicians of the multidisciplinary team assessing the patient , and to request molecular investigation only when there are consisting clinical data of pws diagnostic suspicion .

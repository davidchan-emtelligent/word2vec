cancer stem - like cells exhibit the multi - functional roles to survive and persist for a long period in the minimal residual disease after the conventional anti - cancer treatments .
cancer stem - like cells of solid malignant tumors which highly express cd44v8 - 10 , the variant isoform of cd44 generated by alternative splicing , has a resistance to redox stress by the robust production of glutathione mediated by esrp1 - cd44v - xct ( cystine / glutamate antiporter ) axis .
it has been reported that cd44v and c - myc tend to show the inversed expression pattern at the invasive front of the aggressive tumors .
given that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggers the activation of wnt / beta - catenin signal pathway , it is hypothesized that cd44v causes the negative feedback machinery in the regulation of c - myc expression via the attenuated ros - induced wnt signal pathway .
to address the fundamental question whether and how both proliferative and quiescent cancer stem - like cells heterogeneously exist at the invasive / metastatic edge , researchers need to investigate into the e3 - ubiquitin ligase activity essential for c - myc degradation .
cscs heterogeneity at the invasive / metastatic front is expected to demonstrate the dynamic tumor evolution with the selective pressure of anti - cancer treatments .
furthermore , the novel molecular targeting therapeutic strategies would be established to disrupt the finely - regulated c - myc expression in the heterogeneous csc population in combination with the typical drug - repositioning with xct inhibitor .
keywords cancer stem - like cells cd44 c - myc esrp1 - cd44v - xct axis heterogeneity invasive front minimal residual disease negative feedback machinery reactive oxygen species wnt / beta - catenin signal issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background metastatic and relapsed diseases account for more than 90 % of cancer deaths .
minimal residual disease ( mrd ) , which is undetectable in the clinical settings , is widely accepted to be responsible for the latent relapse and distant metastasis .
the heterogeneous tumor cell population undergoes the selective pressure such as hypoxia , hypo - nutrient conditions , chronic inflammation , and activated innate immune system .
the selective pressure of the unfavorable tumor microenvironment is considered to transiently decrease the degree of the intra - tumoral heterogeneity , which is referred to as " bottle - neck effect " in the evolutionary theory [ 1 ] .
cancer stem - like cells ( cscs ) are defined as the enhanced tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells .
they exist at the top of the hierarchical tumor cell society composed of cscs , transit - amplifying cells , and non - cscs .
cscs exhibit self - renewal potential and can generate numerous progenitor / daughter cells at various degrees of differentiation in much the same way as normal tissue stem cells .
accumulating evidence has strongly suggested that cscs can persist after currently available anti - cancer medical interventions such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
several molecular machineries underlying this therapeutic resistance specific to cscs have been identified , including the resistance to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation , the maintenance of quiescent status of the cell cycle , a rapid response to dna damage , and the robust export of cytotoxic agents .
therefore , mrd is enriched in cscs with high tumorigenic potential and chemo - resistance [ 2 ] .
conventional anti - cancer therapies preferentially kill the proliferative non cscs and proliferative cscs , which is explains the reason why quiescent cscs tend to persist in mrd for a long period .
residual dormant cscs which have survived after the anti - cancer treatment are responsible for the tumor relapse and distant metastasis after their re - entry into the cell cycle .
remarkably , a recent investigation reveals that prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) , the cytokine involved in the chronic inflammation and wound healing , is responsible for the iatrogenic activation of cscs and the progressive development of chemo - resistance .
cytokeratin14 - positive undifferentiated bladder cscs in the dormant cell cycle g0 phase were induced to proliferate and repopulate the mrd on exposure to pge2 which was released from non - csc cells undergoing caspase - dependent apoptosis due to the chemotherapy regimens characterized by gemcitabine and cisplatin .
pge2 - mediated canonical wnt signal activation in dormant cscs was responsible for c - myc up - regulation and re - entry into the cell cycle [ 3 , 4 ] .
taken together , the iatrogenic expansion of csc population is highly likely to ironically cause the " chemotherapy - induced awakening " of dormant cscs located in mrd with the up - regulation of " wound - response gene signature " in the gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea ) , which is consistent with the conventional concept of " cancers as wounds that do not heal [ 5 ]." wnt signal pathways are mainly classified into beta - catenin - dependent canonical pathway and non - canonical pathways .
beta - catenin plays fundamental roles both in the cell - cell adhesion and in the signal transduction .
whereas beta - catenin acts in collaboration with e - cadherin forming adherens junction between epithelial cells , beta - catenin dissociated from adaptor protein complex composed of adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) , axin , and glycogen synthase kinase 3 - beta ( gsk3 - beta ) can enter the nucleus and function as a transcriptional factor in association with t cell factor / lymphoid enhancer factor ( tcf / lef ) .
beta - catenin phosphorylated by gsk3 - beta undergoes ubiquitin - proteasome - dependent protein degradation [ 6 ] .
the expression level of c - myc is finely regulated by both beta - catenin - mediated transcription and e3 - ubiquitin - ligase ( f - box and wd repeat domain - containing 7 ; fbw7 ) - mediated post - translational degradation [ 7 ] .
cd44 is one of the csc markers of various kinds of solid tumors .
cd44 is mainly classified into standard and variant isoforms , without or with variable exons , respectively .
cd44 standard isoform , which is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal cells , is known to interact with extracellular matrix such as hyaluronic acids .
there are several forms of cd44 variant isoforms depending on which variable exons are inserted during the process of the alternative splicing [ 8 ] .
in particular , cd44 variant 8 - 10 ( cd44v ) prevents the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ros ) by the stabilization of cystine / glutamate antiporter at the cellular membrane , and subsequently , this cd44v - xct axis promotes the synthesis of the reduced from of glutathione ( gsh ) [ 9 ] .
given that epithelial splicing regulatory factor 1 ( esrp1 ) contributes to the alterative splicing to specifically generate cd44v with variable exons 8 - 10 , esrp1 - cd44v - xct axis is recognized to regulate the redox balance in cscs .
indeed , esrp1 - cd44v - xct axis has been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of breast cancer cells to form metastatic foci in the lungs ; cd44v - positive 4t1 murine breast cancer cells are significantly able to metastasize to the lungs as compared with cd44v - negative 4t1 cells [ 10 ] .
collectively , esrp1 - cd44v - xct axis efficiently regulates ros level in cscs .
cd44 and c - myc are target molecules regulated by wnt / beta - catenin signal transduction .
it is paradoxical , however , that cd44v and c - myc tend to show the inversed correlation both in vitro experiments using gastric cancer cell lines and in vivo analyses such as immune - histochemical observations of the xenograft models and human tumor specimens [ 11 ] .
the detailed molecular machinery underlying the relationship between cd44 and c - myc remains to be elucidated .
presentation of the hypothesis mounting evidence has suggested that cscs are enriched in the heterogeneous manner especially at the invasive / metastatic front of the aggressive tumor .
cancer cells at the invasive area are expected to be composed of both quiescent cscs exhibiting the expression pattern of cd44v8 - 10 ( high )/ fbw7 ( high )/ c - myc ( low ) and proliferative cscs exhibiting cd44v8 - 10 ( high )/ fbw7 ( low )/ c - myc ( high ) .
the major reason why cd44v8 - 10 and c - myc tend to show the inversed expression pattern is considered to be due to the negative feedback machinery towards ros - induced canonical wnt pathway by cd44v expression ( fig. 1 ) .
esrp1 - cd44v - xct axis has been shown to reduce intracellular ros level and no longer activates the transcriptional level of c - myc [ 11 ] .
surely , c - myc is an oncogenic transcriptional factor regulated by not only ros - induced wnt / beta - catenin signaling but also e - 3 - ubiquitin - ligase fbw7 .
it is still yet to be demonstrated that fbw7 contributes to the regulation of c - myc expression to induce heterogeneous cscs at the invasive / metastatic lesion .
it is possible that the heterogeneity of c - myc stability largely depends on each csc .
collectively , it is hypothesized that both negative - feedback machinery due to ros - induced canonical wnt signal pathway and fbw7 - mediated degradation of oncogenic transcription factor c - myc are responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of cscs enriched at the invasive / metastatic foci. fig. 1 negative - feedback mechanism of ros - induced wnt / beta - catenin signal in cancer stem - like cells .
the exposure to oxidative stress activates wnt pathway and up - regulates both cd44 and c - myc ( blue cells ) .
cd44v8 - 10 stabilizes xct ( cystine / glutamate antiporter ) and provides cscs cystine , the rate - limiting substrate of glutathione synthesis .
the decreased ros level due to cd44v - xct axis influences on ros - induced wnt signal in a negative - feedback manner ( red cells ) .
both blue and red cells belong to cscs , but c - myc expression level is different each other , which makes the invasive cscs population quite heterogeneous in terms of cell cycle and proliferation .
although the precise molecular machineries regulated by fbw7 remain to be unknown , cd44v8 - 10 and c - myc tend to exhibit the inversed expression pattern at the invasive front where heterogeneous cscs are enriched testing the hypothesis to address this hypothesis , it should be noted that both cd44 and c - myc are regulated by wnt / beta - catenin signal pathway and those molecules are crucial for the maintenance of csc phenotype at the niche .
increased amount of wnt ligands promotes c - myc transcription and accelerates the cell cycle re - entry of g0 / g1 - phased dormant cscs [ 2 , 12 ] .
cd44 has a longer half - life period than c - myc , one of the oncogenic transcription factors [ 13 ] .
when wnt / beta - catenin signal pathway is activated due to the increased ros level , both cd44 and c - myc are up - regulated at the transcriptional level .
however , given the difference in the stabilization as a molecule , c - myc is expected to be soon down - regulated in cscs highly expressing cd44v. by striking contrast , cd44 continues to reduce intracellular ros level by promoting the gsh generation , resulting in the negative feedback machinery of wnt / beta - catenin signaling transduction .
on the other hand , there is the heterogeneity in terms of the expression level of c - myc , which influences on the proliferative potential of each csc with abundant expression of cd44v .
this heterogeneity of c - myc expression occurs because of the heterogeneous degradation by the ubiquitin - proteasome cascade mainly regulated by fbw7 .
so far , it remains to be elusive which fbw7 isoform mainly contributes to the c - myc regulation at the invasive / metastatic front .
alternative splicing generates three different protein isoforms of fbw7 composed of fbw7alpha , fbw7beta , and fbw7gamma .
their distribution determines depending on 5 ' exon signals that direct the isoforms to distinct subcellular compartments ; fbw7alpha is nucleoplasmic , fbw7beta is cytoplasmic , and fbw7gamma is nucleolar , respectively .
furthermore , there are no reliable antibodies available for fbw7 .
importantly , it would be difficult to identify the heterogeneity of csc population at the invasive front derived from the biopsy or surgical specimen .
cscs are critically influenced by the microenvironment , which is why the complexity of heterogeneous cscs at the invasive / metastatic lesion would exhibit the discrepancy as compared with the bona fide behavior of invasive csc population .
implications of the hypothesis ros is a double - edged sword for cancer cells .
while the excessive level of ros can induce apoptotic or necrotic cell death , the appropriate range of ros level triggers cellular proliferation by influencing on several survival signal transductions characterized by canonical wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
upon exposure to redox stress , nucleoredoxin ( nrx ) associated with redox - sensitive wnt adaptor protein inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of gsk3beta and leads to beta - catenin stabilization .
beta - catenin spared from phosphorylation by gsk3beta translocates into the nucleus and binds to tcf / lef promoter , thereby enhancing the transcription of axin - 2 , cd44 , c - myc , ccnd1 , and beta - catenin itself [ 14 ] .
thus , ros can be either beneficial or harmful for cancer cells in the microenvironment .
furthermore , the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the inversed expression pattern between csc marker cd44v and oncogenic transcription factor c - myc should be elucidated to better understand how aggressively invasive / metastatic cscs simultaneously regulate cell cycle and ros level .
c - myc drives the cellular proliferation and causes metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells .
it has already been shown that ki - 67 , the proliferative marker , exhibits the reversed expression pattern as compared with cd44v [ 11 ]. from the perspective of tumor metabolism , c - myc has been revealed to stimulate the expression of both na + - dependent amino acid transporter asct2 and glutaminases ( gls ) which is an essential enzyme for glutaminolysis .
c - myc promotes glutamine uptake via asct2 transporter and glutamine catabolism mediated by gls mainly in the mitochondria .
this excessive dependency on glutamine catabolism in cancer cells is referred to as " glutamine addiction [ 15 ] " .
it is likely that heterogeneous csc population composed of dormant cscs with cd44v8 - 10 ( high )/ fbw7 ( high )/ c - myc ( low ) and proliferative cscs with cd44v8 - 10 ( high )/ fbw7 ( low )/ c - myc ( high ) exhibit the metabolic symbiosis at the invasive / metastatic front .
while cd44v brings about the negative feedback loop against ros - induced canonical wnt signal activation , c - myc would be easily down - regulated as compared with cd44 in terms of the difference in the half - life period. that is why cd44 , especially cd44v8 - 10 , and c - myc tend to show the inversed expression pattern each other .
in addition , the heterogeneous amount and activity of fbw7 ubiquitin ligase makes the heterogeneity of oncogenic c - myc expression .
this heterogeneous c - myc expression at the invasive / metastatic lesion represents the diversity in the proliferative capacity of csc population with robust cd44v expression .
when researchers demonstrate the regulation machinery underlying the heterogeneous cscs at the invasive / metastatic edge , the therapeutic strategy against tumor invasion and metastasis by targeting cscs would be much more validated .
as mentioned above [ 3 ] , the chemotherapy can stimulate dormant cscs and induce the therapeutic resistance to the conventionally effective drugs .
collectively , the heterogeneous cscs at the invasive / metastatic edge is expected to reveal the dynamic evolution with the selective pressure of anti - cancer treatments .
last but certainly not least , the novel molecular targeting therapies against aggressive cscs would be more warranted .
sulfasalazine , the conventional drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis , has been revealed to inhibit the function of xct transporter [ 9 , 10 ] .
this is the typical example of the drug re - positioning , finding out the novel anti - tumor effect of conventionally used agents .
as compared with novel molecular - targeting drugs , conventionally - used agents are pharmacologically safe and beneficial for medical economy .
indeed , sulfasalazine has been shown to reduce the proliferation of cd44v - highly expressing cancer cells in the clinical trials on advanced gastric and pulmonary tumors [ 2 , 15 ] .
cscs enriched at the invasive / metastatic front with enhanced level of ros are likely to disappear , when ersp1 - cd44v - xct axis is disrupted by sulfasalazine treatment .
given that c - myc drives the cell division and promotes the glutamine metabolism [ 15 ] , the molecular targeting drug for this oncogenic transcriptional factor would show the synergistic therapeutic effect against cscs at the invasive / metastatic front with xct inhibitor .

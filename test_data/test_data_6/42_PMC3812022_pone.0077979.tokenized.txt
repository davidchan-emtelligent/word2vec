under - nutrition is a known risk factor for tb and can adversely affect treatment outcomes .
however , data from india are sparse , despite the high burden of tb as well as malnutrition in india .
we assessed the nutritional status at the time of diagnosis and completion of therapy , and its association with deaths during tb treatment , in a consecutive cohort of 1695 adult patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in rural india during 2004 - 2009.multivariable logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted estimates of the association of nutritional status with deaths during treatment .
at the time of diagnosis , median bmi and body weights were 16.0 kg / m2and 42.1 kg in men , and 15.0 kg / m2and 34.1 kg in women , indicating that 80 % of women and 67 % of men had moderate to severe under - nutrition ( bmi < 17.0 kg / m2 ) .
fifty two percent of the patients ( 57 % of men and 48 % of women ) had stunting indicating chronic under - nutrition .
half of women and one third of men remained moderately to severely underweight at the end of treatment .
60 deaths occurred in 1179 patients ( 5 %) in whom treatment was initiated .
severe under - nutrition at diagnosis was associated with a 2 fold higher risk of death .
overall , a majority of patients had evidence of chronic severe under - nutrition at diagnosis , which persisted even after successful treatment in a significant proportion of them .
these findings suggest the need for nutritional support during treatment of pulmonary tb in this rural population .

introduction india has a major share of the global incidence of tuberculosis ( tb ) ( including mdr - tb ) and tb related mortality .
according to estimates for 2010 , tb incidence was 185 per 100,000 with 320,000 tb - related deaths [ 1 ] .
hiv infection plays a relatively minor role in the tb epidemic in india [ 2 ] , whereas under - nutrition , smoking , and diabetes are considered more important risk factors [ 3 - 5 ] .
recent systematic reviews have established the role of under - nutrition as an important risk factor for reactivation of latent tb infection to tb disease [ 6,7 ] , while obesity has been found to be protective against tb [ 8 - 10 ] .
under - nutrition is the most widely prevalent risk factor , accounting for the highest population attributable risk ( par ) for tb in india [ 11 ] .
in india more than one third of women and men in the age group of 15 - 49 years are under - nourished ( bmi < 18.5 kg / m2 ) , and nearly half of children under the age of five years have moderate to severe under - nutrition ( as defined in who child growth standards )[ 12 ] .
tuberculosis can lead to or worsen pre - existing under - nutrition , by decreasing appetite , and by increased catabolism [ 13,14 ]. high prevalence of under - nutrition in tb patients has been reported in other settings [ 15 - 19 ] , and has been linked to excess deaths [ 16 ] , and increased risk of relapse [ 20 ]. there have been few reports on prevalence , severity and implications of under - nutrition in indian patients with tb [ 21 ] , particularly from india 's rural areas , where the majority of indians live , and which have a higher prevalence of poverty , under - nutrition and self - reported tb than urban areas [ 12 ] .
we assessed nutritional status and selected treatment outcomes in a consecutive cohort of 1695 patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis at a rural hospital and community health programme in central india between 2004 - 2009 .
materials and methods study subjects chhattisgarh state , a state in central india , has a population of 20 million of which more than a third is of indigenous people - a marginalised social group , with higher rates of poverty , illiteracy , infant and maternal mortality and under - nutrition , than the average indian population [ 12,22,23 ] .
seventy - two percent of the population lives in poverty , defined by the multi - dimensional poverty index [ 24,25 ]. the economy is based on cultivation of rain - fed rice crops ; many residents migrate seasonally to other states for livelihood . our study was conducted at jan swasthya sahyog ( jss - or people 's health support group ) , a non - profit voluntary organisation that has provided health services in bilaspur district of chhattisgarh state since 2000 .
jss caters to the rural population through its community health programme in 54 villages , a secondary care level hospital which is accessed by people of over 1500 villages , and 3 outreach clinics serving the villages in the community health programme and other remote villages .
all patients with pulmonary tuberculosis 18 years of age and older , diagnosed at the hospital , and the 3 outreach clinic centres between january 1 , 2004 and 31 december , 2009 , were included in the study .
patients were diagnosed primarily on the basis of sputum smear microscopy and radiography , according to who guidelines [ 26 ] .
smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed if microscopic examination of one or more direct smears of sputum was positive for acid - fast bacilli on ziehl - neelsen staining .
smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed if a patient with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tb had two smear examinations negative for acid - fast bacilli but had chest radiographic appearance judged by the physicians to be compatible with pulmonary tb [ 27 ] .
patients were categorised on the basis of treatment history as new cases or previously treated cases [ 26,27 ] .
this study was a secondary analysis of routinely collected clinical data at jss hospital and community health programme during the period 2004 - 2009 .
analysis of the data without patient identifiers was done at mcgill university after ethics approval from the institutional review board at the faculty of medicine , mcgill university , montreal ( irb study number : a10 - m111 - 11b ) .
the protocol approved by the irb noted that no informed consents were obtained because the data were collected as part of routine hospital care , and analysed post - hoc as secondary data .
study design this retrospective cohort study was conducted with the following objectives : 1 .
to assess the nutritional status of patients with active pulmonary tb , before and at the completion of therapy .
2. to assess the association of the pre - treatment nutritional status with mortality during tb treatment .
methods information on age , gender , residence , sputum smear status , grade of sputum smear , previous history of treatment , history of any illness or death in a family member diagnosed as tb , was recorded for each patient .
weights were recorded at the time of diagnosis and at completion of treatment using the same regularly calibrated beam balance (+ 100 g precision ) , with the patient wearing light clothing .
heights were recorded to the nearest centimeter with a stadiometer using standard procedures .
measurements were made by trained paramedics .
in patients where both heights and weights were obtained , body mass index ( bmi in kg / m2 ) was calculated and the patients were classified into categories based on the bmi cut - offs for weight categories as recommended by the who [ 28,29 ] .
the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) has recommended weights and heights of 60 kg and 172 cm for adult indian men , and 55 kg and 162 cm for adult indian women ; these were used as reference weights and heights in this study [ 30 ] .
the indian reference standard for height was a single value and for purpose of comparison of the distribution of heights , the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) reference standards were used [ 31 ] .
stunting ( short stature ) was defined as height below - 2 standard deviations from the median of the nchs reference heights for 18 year old men and women [ 31 ] , as has been done in some other studies on nutritional status from india [ 32 ] .
we used the body weight as well as the bmi in our analyses .
use of body weights allowed comparisons with studies from the revised national tuberculosis control program ( rntcp ) , and older studies ( which recorded only weight ) .
use of bmi enabled classification into who recommended weight categories [ 28,29 ] .
patients diagnosed with active tb were advised to seek free treatment under the rntcp as a first option .
patients who opted for treatment at jss received daily , self - administered , short course therapy prescribed according to who guidelines [ 26 ] .
anti - tb drugs were provided at highly subsidised rates ($ 1 per month ) or were free .
patients were counselled about tb , its treatment , cessation of smoking , and avoidance of alcohol use .
based on the location of their residence patients were classified into the following groups .
group 1 : if the residence was related to the village health programme and outreach clinics .
group 2 : if residence was within a 20 km radius of the hospital .
group 3 : if residence was not related to the village health programme / outreach clinics and was beyond 20 km from the hospital .
outcomes were classified according to who guidelines as ' cured ' or ' treatment completed ' ( these categories together constituted " treatment success ") ' deaths ' , ' defaults ' , ' treatment failure ' , or ' transferred out '( i.e. those who sought care under rntcp )[ 26 ] .
tb deaths refer to any deaths occurring during the course of tb treatment [ 26 ] , and these were ascertained from hospital medical records , during home visits made to group 1 and group 2 patients , or communications from relatives in response to phone calls or postal reminders in group 3 patients .
statistical analysis association between categorical variables was assessed using the fisher 's exact test .
student 's t tests ( paired and unpaired ) , and mann - whitney tests were used to compare means , medians respectively as appropriate .
the multivariable logistic regression analyses of outcomes of tb deaths and treatment success were performed with nutritional status ( weight , bmi ) as the predictor variables and were adjusted for demographic , clinical and disease related covariates .
variables were included in the final model if the univariate analysis showed a p value < 0.25 , or if the variable was of known clinical importance [ 33 ] .
age , weight and bmi were included as continuous variables in the regression model after verifying the linearity of associations under study in a generalised additive model .
patients who defaulted were excluded in the analyses of death .
statistical analysis was done using stata 11 ( stata corp , college station , tx ) .
results the characteristics of patients are described in table 1 .
1695 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis during 2004 - 2009. of these patients , measurements of body weight and height at diagnosis were made in 1665 ( 98.2 %) and 1523 ( 89.9 %) respectively .
1179 patients of these 1695 patients were treated at jss , while 516 patients were transferred out for treatment under the rntcp .
the patients transferred out for treatment under rntcp included a slightly higher proportion of men ( 71.5 % vs. 66.4 % , p = 0.04 ) , who were older than the men who opted for treatment at jss ( median age of 45 years compared to 39 years in the jss group , p < 0.0005 ) , and a higher proportion of patients from distant towns and villages .
those transferred out to the rntcp were more likely to be smear positive ( 70 % vs. 64 %. p = 0.03 ) .
the patients treated at jss included a higher proportion of women , patients with previously treated disease ( 19.6 % vs.13.4 % , p = 0.002 ) , and included all the patients with hiv associated pulmonary tb. there was no significant difference in the pre - treatment bmi and weights of men and women in the jss treated group compared to the group of patients who were transferred out to the rntcp .

the majority of the subjects were men from rural areas , and had smear positive pulmonary tb. more than two - thirds of subjects with smear positive pulmonary tb had a high bacterial load with more than 1 acid fast bacillus seen per oil immersion field ( sputum smear grade of 2 + and higher ) on direct microscopy ( table 1 ) .
80 % of patients came from a distance of more than 20 km from the hospital .
a significant proportion had history of a family member with active tb ; of these , many had died .
after under - nutrition the most common co - morbidities were anemia , diabetes and hiv infection , although these were tested ( with appropriate informed consent ) in 705 , 686 , and 893 patients respectively ( table 1 ). table 1 also shows the anthropometric status of the patients at diagnosis , while figure 1 shows the distribution of bmi of men and women patients at diagnosis . the median pre - treatment bmi in men and women was about 16 kg / m2 and 15 kg / m2 respectively , while the median weight was 42.0 kg and 34.1 kg in men and women respectively .
more than 85 % of men and almost 95 % of women were underweight at diagnosis ( bmi < 18.5 kg / m2 ) , and two - thirds of women and half of men were severely underweight ( bmi < 16 kg / m2 ) ( table 1 ) .

* bmi of 18.5 kg / m2 is the cutoff separating under - nutrition ( bmi < 18.5 kg / m2 ) from normal range of bmi ( 18.5 - 24.99 kg / m2 ) .
overall , 843 of 1523 ( 55 %) of patients whose bmi was measured had severe underweight at diagnosis ( data not in table ) .
there were 72 men and 30 women with a bmi < 13 kg / m2 and bmi < 12 kg / m2 respectively ( data not shown in table ) ; the lowest value of bmi was 9.37 kg / m2.as seen in table 1 , the pre - treatment weights were at least 30 % lower , and the heights were 10 cm shorter than the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) recommended reference measures [ 30 ] .
only 2.4 % of patients had pre - treatment weights equal to or above the suggested indian reference weights [ 30 ] .
52 % of patients ( 57 % of men and 48 % of women ) had stunting with heights below the 3rd percentile of the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) standards for height at 18 years of age ( 163 cm for men and 151 cm for women ) .
this poor attainment of adult stature suggests chronic inadequate nutrition in childhood during the growth period [ 34,35 ] .
there was no statistically or clinically significant difference in weights of men and women according to smear status , treatment history , hiv and diabetes status , year of diagnosis or location of residence ( data not shown in table ) .
the clinical , demographic and anthropometric indicators in 1179 patients treated at jss stratified by outcomes are shown in table 2 .
older age , male gender , residence more than 20 km from the hospital , & hiv status were associated with both death and default.the median ( iqr ) ages of death was 42 ( 35,55 ) years in men and 32.5 ( 27,50 ) years in women .
patients with a previous history of tb treatment had a higher rate of default .
men who died during treatment had significantly lower pre - treatment weights than those who were treated successfully ( 4 kg lower median weight ) , but in women this difference was not statistically significant .
overall , among patients treated at jss , 71 % were moderately to severely underweight at diagnosis , while in those who died this proportion was 80 % ( p = 0.08 , fisher 's exact test - data not shown in table ) .
there was no significant difference in baseline weights between men and women who completed treatment successfully compared to those who defaulted before completion .

na : not applicable as variable is not in final model discussion in this study , under - nutrition was the most prevalent co - morbidity , present in more than 85 % of rural men and women with pulmonary tb at diagnosis , of which more than two thirds were moderately to severely underweight according to bmi based criteria .
levels of bmi which are considered lethal [ 36 ] - bmi < 13 kg / m2 and bmi < 11 kg / m2 in men and women respectively - were seen in 5 % of patients .
women were more likely to have severe nutritional deficit .
more than half of women and one third of men continued to be moderately to severely underweight at the end of successful treatment .
the deaths which occurred during tb treatment were premature - - defined as those occurring belowthe age of 65 years [ 37 ] .
the median ages at death ( 42 years in men and 32 years in women ) were in contrast to the current life expectancy of 65.8 years for men and 68.1 years for women in india [ 38 ] .
a bmi of 16.0 kg / m2 was associated with a 2 fold higher odds of death .
the association observed between bmi and death during tb treatment was mainly driven by a strong association in men .
this could have been due to a number of reasons. with 14 documented deaths in women , the study had low power to study subgroup effects .
another explanation can be the very high prevalence of severe under - nutrition in the women ( more than 60 %) .
at such high prevalence the predictive value of a risk factor may be lost .
there could be a biologic reason , as women have greater ability to adapt to starvation , given that the level of bmi that is considered lethal in women ( 11 kg / m2 ) is lower than in men ( 13 kg / m2 )[ 36 ] .
the prevalence of severe under - nutrition in our cohort was higher than that reported in hiv positive patients in urban india and sub - saharan africa ( table 5 ) [ 16,21,39 ] .
in a report from malawi,where the prevalence of hiv infection was 80 % among tb patients , the prevalence of severe under - nutrition was 21 % in contrast to nearly 50 % in our cohort ( table 5 ) [ 16 ] . the body weights were in fact close to those of poor urban patients of the famous madras ( now chennai ) trial 5 decades ago ( table 5 ) [ 40 ] .
in the rntcp , where 1.5 million patients are diagnosed per year , body weights are recorded but have not been reported .
the weight gain in this study was similar to the mean weight gain of 3.2 kg observed in another study in south india [ 41 ] .
low bmi has been reported as an independent risk factor for all cause and tb related mortality in population based cohorts [ 42 - 44 ] .
in tb patients , under - nutrition has been associated with increased risk of tb related mortality , including those with drug resistant tb and hiv infection [ 9,16,45 - 51 ] .
the strength of the association of under - nutrition with mortality in this study was broadly consistent with other studies.bmi of less than 17 was associated with a mortality rate ratio of 1.7 [ 46 ] , compared to a 4 fold increased risk of death associated with weight < 35 kg in a cohort from south india [ 50 ] .

our study has certain limitations .
heights were missing in about 10 % of subjects , but the weights , demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects with missing values were similar to those without missing values .
we could not comment on specific loss with regard to lean body mass or body fat or micronutrient malnutrition .
information on radiographic extent of disease was lacking , but results of bacillary density in sputum , another marker of disease severity were available and used in the multivariable analyses .
in a recent study where adjustments were made for radiographic extent of disease , under - nutrition remained strongly associated with tb mortality [ 51 ] .
hiv testing was offered but not accepted by all subjects , but chhattisgarh is a low prevalence area for hiv infection with an estimated hiv prevalence of less than 0.3 % of the adult population in 2009 [ 52 ] .
the outcomes in the patients who defaulted could not be ascertained .
we conducted a sensitivity analysis assuming a mortality rate of 15 % in defaulters ( documented in a recent cohort study )[ 53 ] .
the results were similar to our original analysis , although the effect estimate was smaller ( adjusted or : 0.87 per unit increase in bmi ; 95 % ci : 0.78 - 0.97 ) .
adjustments for socioeconomic status , smoking and alcohol consumption could not be made in the multivariable analysis .
however nutritional status is strongly correlated with socio - economic status in india [ 12 ] .
the strengths of this study are that it represents a large sample of rural patients studied over 6 years .
the sampling of consecutive patients makes selection bias less likely , though because of the location and low - cost nature of services , the poor might have been over - represented in our cohort .
the composition of patients reflects the status of patients diagnosed at both primary and secondary care level .
the median heights in this study were identical to the median heights of rural men and women in a survey in 16 states in india [ 54 ] .
this suggests that the levels of chronic under - nutrition in our patients were similar to other subjects in rural india , which enhances the generalizability of our findings to other rural populations in the country .
this study has some important implications .
under - nutrition was a highly prevalent co - morbidity associated with an increased risk of death in these patients .
the under - nutrition in these patients was possibly a result of both active tb as well as pre - existing chronic under - nutrition .
the evidence of pre - existing under - nutrition can be inferred from a variety of sources .
52 % of patients had heights which fell below the 3rd percentile of the nchs standards , indicating poor nutrition in childhood [ 31 ] .
if under - nutrition was only disease related , patients with smear positive pulmonary tb ( who have higher disease burden ) would have had lower bmi and weights , and weights after successful treatment would have been normal .
however bmi and weights were similar across categories of smear status in this study , and post - treatment weights continued to be low .
under - nutrition in adults in rural chhattisgarh is highly prevalent .
according to nfhs - 3 figures,46 % of women and 36 % of men in rural chhattisgarh were undernourished ( bmi < 18.5 ) , while less than 3 % of men and women were obese (> 30.0 kg / m2 )[ 12 ] .
the finding of severe and life - threatening levels of under - nutrition in this cohort of patients from rural india raises the issue of its management .
neither current who guidelines for treatment of tuberculosis [ 55 ] , nor the international standards of tuberculosis care [ 56 ] , discuss the importance of under - nutrition or nutritional support during treatment .
the who guidelines on management of severe under - nutrition in adults however suggest hospitalization of such patients in view of their mortality risk , concomitant treatment of the medical illness , and dietary supplementation till a bmi of 18.5 is reached [ 57 ] .
in this study following the who recommendations would have entailed hospitalization of nearly half of all diagnosed patients , a measure which was not feasible .
we conclude that nutritional support should be considered for severely underweight patients with pulmonary tb to decrease their risk of mortality , although community based nutritional interventions for such patients in rural india , require further investigation .

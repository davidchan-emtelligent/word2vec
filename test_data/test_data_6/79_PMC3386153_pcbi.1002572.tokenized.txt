much molecular - evolution research is concerned with sequence analysis .
yet these sequences represent real , three - dimensional molecules with complex structure and function .
here i highlight a growing trend in the field to incorporate molecular structure and function into computational molecular - evolution work .
i consider three focus areas : reconstruction and analysis of past evolutionary events , such as phylogenetic inference or methods to infer selection pressures ; development of toy models and simulations to identify fundamental principles of molecular evolution ; and atom - level , highly realistic computational modeling of molecular structure and function aimed at making predictions about possible future evolutionary events .
this is an " editors' outlook " article for plos computational biology .
introduction the field of molecular evolution investigates how genes and genomes evolve over time .
it has its origin in the late 1960s , when the first dna and protein sequences were becoming available. with rapid progress in sequencing technologies came ever increasing demand for computational tools to study molecular evolution .
today , molecular evolution is among the largest subfields of evolutionary biology , and arguably one of the most computationally advanced .
thousands of person years have gone into developing sophisticated alignment algorithms , phylogenetic - tree reconstruction methods , or statistical tests for positive selection .
a side effect of the strong emphasis on developing sophisticated methods for sequence analysis has been that the underlying biophysical objects represented by the sequences , dna molecules , rna molecules , and proteins , have taken a back - seat in much computational molecular - evolution work .
the vast majority of algorithms for sequence analysis , for example , incorporate no knowledge of biology or biochemistry besides that dna and rna sequences use an alphabet of four letters , protein sequences use an alphabet of 20 , and the genetic code converts one into the other .
the choice to treat dna , rna , and proteins simply as strings of letters was certainly reasonable in the late 20th century .
computational power was limited and many basic aspects of sequence analysis were still relatively poorly understood .
however , in 2012 we have extremely powerful computers and a large array of highly sophisticated algorithms that can analyze strings of letters .
it is now time to bring the molecules back into molecular evolution .
several groups have embarked on this path , and i will highlight some of the work that has been done and speculate on future developments we may see .
in this article , i focus on the evolution of protein - coding genes , the area i am most familiar with myself .
however , my overall message , that it is time to bring the molecules back into molecular evolution , similarly applies to other genetic sequences , such as intergenic regions , rna genes , or the various forms of short rnas .
i will consider three broad areas , corresponding to three distinct research goals : ( i ) reconstructing and interpreting past evolutionary events ; ( ii ) identifying fundamental principles of molecular evolution ; and ( iii ) predicting probable evolutionary trajectories .
reconstructing and interpreting past evolutionary events a major goal of comparative sequence analysis is to reconstruct and / or interpret past evolutionary events .
for example , we may have sequences from multiple species and want to know how they relate to each other , which specific sequence changes caused them to diverge , and whether certain sites were under particularly strong selective pressure .
the standard analysis pipeline for such questions is to align sequences , build trees , and run scans for positive or other types of selection , and / or for recombination .
this analysis pipeline uses nothing but sequences as input .
only once the analysis is completed may the researchers take sites of interest they have identified , map them back onto the structure of the protein they are studying , and carry out further experimentation .
( however , increasingly the initial sequence analysis is only the prerequisite for a successful study , and the value of the study is defined by the follow - up work ; see e.g. , [ 1 ] , [ 2 ].) the standard analysis approach has been highly successful .
yet it ignores most of the biochemistry that ultimately determines the fitness landscape in which sequences evolve .
thus , methods that combine sequence data with additional information , such as protein structure , should yield more sensitive and more accurate estimates than methods based on sequence data alone .
on the basis of this premise , a few groups have started to develop such methods .
for example , some authors have developed models of coding - sequence evolution that incorporate interactions among sites mediated by protein structure [ 3 ] - [ 5 ] .
( see also this review : [ 6 ].) similarly , some authors have incorporated knowledge of protein structure in methods of ancestral state reconstruction [ 7 ] .
finally , in phylogenetic - tree inference , evidence is accumulating that independence of sites may not be a good assumption [ 8 ] for protein - coding and even more so for rna - coding sequences .
thus , future methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction may also incorporate structural information in some form .
coarse - grained models of protein - sequence evolution are being developed that may be useful for this purpose [ 9 ] .
the development of methods that integrate molecular structure into sequence analysis is still in its infancy .
while several groups are exploring a variety of approaches , none of these approaches is well established at this time .
comparative analyses that use nothing but sequence data remain state of the art .
my expectation for the near future is that we will continue to see efforts to extend comparative analyses beyond sequence data alone .
eventually , some of these efforts will prove sufficiently useful that it will become commonplace to combine sequence data with structural , functional , or other molecular data in comparative analyses .
identifying fundamental principles of molecular evolution besides understanding and interpreting specific evolutionary events , evolutionary biologists also aim to identify fundamental principles of molecular evolution .
fundamental principles are insights that apply to many different biological systems ; a classical example would be the finding that codon usage bias correlates with gene expression level [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
the search for fundamental principles tends to require somewhat different computational approaches than the analysis of past evolutionary events .
it often involves developing toy models ( either in the form of mathematical equations or of simulations ) to explore possible system dynamics under different modeling assumptions or parameter choices .
the specific toy models to be explored are usually inspired by observations from past evolutionary events .
to give an example from my own research , starting about 10 years ago many groups found that highly expressed proteins evolve slowly [ 12 ] .
this observation prompted several authors to develop models of varying complexity that might explain the pattern [ 13 ] - [ 17 ] .
toy models of evolution have been studied for over a century. and much of this work has not considered the underlying biochemistry of the evolving organism .
for example , the population - genetics literature contains plenty of abstract , mathematical models ( such as two - locus , two - allele models ) that make absolutely no assumptions about the mechanisms that connect different allelic states with different fitness values .
these abstract mathematical models are valuable , of course , yet they can get us only so far .
most importantly , they cannot explain how , mechanistically , genotype maps to phenotype and fitness .
as we try to get a better understanding of the genotype - phenotype map , we have to build more realistic models .
for example , virtually all the models trying to explain the relationship between evolutionary rate and expression level make concrete assumptions about mechanisms of protein folding and function [ 13 ] - [ 17 ] .
many implement an actual ( though simplified ) protein - folding model in which actual amino - acid sequences are computationally folded , using either a lattice [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] or an off - lattice [ 16 ] approach .
more generally , we are seeing an increased trend towards integrating some biophysical realism into toy models of evolution .
several groups are regularly working with models that incorporate some aspect of protein biochemistry , such as protein fold stability [ 9 ] , [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] , [ 18 ] - [ 22 ] or protein - protein interactions [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] .
models may represent individual evolving proteins [ 18 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] or entire cells [ 19 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] .
finally , some groups elucidate the molecular fitness landscapes that underlie adaptive events [ 25 ] - [ 27 ] .
works such as these aim to identify the biophysical mechanisms that drive molecular evolution .
i believe that we have only scratched the surface of what is possible with simple , biophysically inspired models of molecular evolution .
i expect that we are going to see more of this modeling approach in the coming years , and that it will help us to develop a deeper understanding of fundamental principles of molecular evolution .
predicting probable evolutionary trajectories for many real - world applications , it would be useful to be able to predict future evolutionary events .
for example , we know that h5n1 avian influenza could potentially cause a deadly pandemic if it ever evolved the ability to effectively spread between humans .
what we do not know [ 28 ] is the likelihood that it will evolve this ability , nor whether it might possibly become less pathogenic as it evolves more effective human - to - human transmission capabilities .
as a second example , some authors have proposed treating infectious diseases with interfering particles ( e.g. , [ 29 ]) .
because of the potential for transmission of these particles among infected patients , the safety of such treatments stands and falls with our ability to accurately predict how such therapeutic particles might evolve once released .
since evolution is a stochastic process , we cannot expect to ever predict which specific mutations will accumulate in a given lineage .
however , at least in principle , we should be able to make probabilistic predictions of the form " outcome a is the most likely , and has a 37 % probability of occurring ; outcome b is the second most likely , and has a 24 % probability of occurring. " it would be tremendously useful if we could make such predictions reliably , in particular for rapidly evolving pathogens .
therefore , there is growing interest among evolutionary biologists to develop predictive frameworks [ 30 ] - [ 33 ] .
in my opinion , successful approaches in this area will most likely involve realistic , atom - level computational modeling of the system of interest. with rapid increases in computational power over the last two decades , realistic modeling of biological systems is becoming increasingly feasible .
at the molecular level , obvious applications of realistic modeling are atom - level predictions of protein structure [ 34 ] or protein - folding dynamics [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , and computational enzyme design [ 37 ] - [ 39 ] .
the accuracy of these computational models , when they work , is getting quite good .
for example , in computational enzyme design , where the goal is to design catalytically active enzymes de novo , crystal structures of successfully designed enzymes are often very close to the computationally predicted ones [ 39 ] .
however , it is common that only a small number of the computational designs actually work as expected .
in a recent study , 84 computationally designed enzymes were evaluated experimentally [ 39 ]. of those , 50 were soluble and only two catalyzed the desired reaction .
at present , atom - level modeling of proteins is not commonly used in applications of evolutionary biology ( but see [ 40 ]) .
however , it seems to me that as our modeling capability improves , a logical next step will be to apply these models to predicting evolution .
if we can predict computationally which mutants will be able to carry out specific functions , then we should also be able to predict which mutants are likely to arise under specific , well - defined selection pressures .
while i cannot imagine that we will ever be able to solve open - ended problems , such as , for example , to predict all the sequence changes an invasive species will undergo as it is introduced into a new environment , we should have reasonable success for well - defined problems , such as to find the mutations an animal virus would require to bind to the human form of the receptor it uses for cell entry in its host species .
an alternative to atom - level modeling can be statistical inference of biophysically important sites from large sequence alignments .
for example , in a recent paper bloom and glassman [ 41 ] proposed a method to infer the effect of point mutations on protein stability from the distribution of mutations in a dense phylogeny .
this method performed better in predicting measured values than alternative methods based on protein structure and atomic force fields .
bloom and co - workers then used this method to identify mutations that were likely to be involved in the evolution of oseltamivir resistance in influenza [ 42 ] .
regardless of whether one uses atom - level modeling or statistical approaches , computational predictions are not going to be perfect .
thus , computational methods to predict evolution are most likely going to be useful in generating candidate scenarios .
these candidate scenarios will include many false positives and will have to be screened experimentally to separate false from true positives .
summary there is a growing trend in widely differing subfields of molecular evolution to increase biophysical realism in computational models of sequence evolution .
some subfields are further along this path than others .
among groups developing simple toy models of evolution , models incorporating some biophysical realism have been quite popular in recent years. by contrast , statistical models of sequence evolution incorporating biophysical realism are being developed by some groups but are not being routinely applied in sequence - analysis applications .
a major impediment to more routine use of such models is likely the lack of widely available , easy - to - use implementations .
hopefully , we will see progress in this area soon .
methods to predict future evolutionary trajectories do not really exist at this time .
however , there is a growing interest in developing them .
i believe that the computational methods required for this type of prediction are falling into place in the protein - design field ; we may soon see a first , small - scale demonstration that computational prediction of evolutionary trajectories is actually possible .

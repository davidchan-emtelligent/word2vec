background the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) is rising in all developed countries .
this study aimed at assessing the short - term economic burden of gdm from the italian healthcare system perspective .
methods a model was built over the last pregnancy trimester ( i.e. , from the 28th gestational week until childbirth included ) .
the national hospital discharge database ( 2014 ) was accessed to estimate delivery outcome probabilities and inpatient costs in gdm and normal pregnancies ( i.e. , euglycemia ) .
international classification of disease - 9th revision - clinical modification ( icd9 - cm ) diagnostic codes and diagnosis - related group ( drg ) codes were used to identify gdm cases and different types of delivery ( i.e. , vaginal or cesarean ) within the database .
neonatal outcomes probabilities were estimated from the literature and included macrosomia , hypoglycemia , hyperbilirubinemia , shoulder dystocia , respiratory distress , and brachial plexus injury .
additional data sources such as regional documents , official price and tariff lists , national statistics and expert opinion were used to populate the model .
the average cost per case was calculated at national level to estimate the annual economic burden of gdm .
one - way sensitivity analyses and monte carlo simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around base case results .
results the amount of pregnancies complicated by gdm in italy was assessed at 54,783 in 2014 using a prevalence rate of 10.9 % .
the antenatal outpatient cost per case was estimated at euro43.7 in normal pregnancies compared to euro370.6 in gdm patients , which is equivalent to a weighted sum of insulin - ( 14 % ; euro1034.6 ) and diet - ( 86 % ; euro262.5 ) treated women 's costs .
inpatient delivery costs were assessed at euro1601.6 and euro1150.3 for euglycemic women and their infants , and at euro1835.0 and euro1407.7 for gdm women and their infants , respectively .
thus , the overall cost per case difference between gdm and normal pregnancies was equal to euro817.8 (+ 29.2 %) , resulting in an economic burden of about euro44.8 million in 2014 at national level .
probabilistic sensitivity analysis yielded a cost per case difference ranging between euro464.9 and euro1164.8 in 80 % of simulations .
conclusions the economic burden of gdm in italy is substantial even accounting for short - term medical costs only .
future research also addressing long - term consequences from a broader societal perspective is recommended .
keywords gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) hospital discharge database ( hdd ) delivery outcomes costs italy nestle research centreissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) is defined as " any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy " and represents one of the most common complications [ 1 ] .
gdm is associated with higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as an increased probability of developing future type 2 diabetes mellitus in both mother and infant [ 2 - 5 ] .
in italy , a 75 - gr oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) for gdm is recommended at weeks 16 - 18 and / or at week 24 - 28 of pregnancy according to pre - defined risk factors including age , body mass index ( bmi ) , family history of type 2 diabetes , previous history of gdm , and ethnicity [ 6 ] .
according to the criteria promoted by the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups ( iadpsg ) in 2010 [ 7 ] , gdm prevalence was recently assessed at around 11 % in italy [ 8 , 9 ] .
this rate is 25 % higher than the value estimated ten years before with the old criteria and may affect both the pre - and post - natal healthcare burden in the near future [ 8 - 12 ] .
the prevalence rate is aligned with data from other countries , where gdm is estimated to affect between 1 % and 15 % of pregnancies depending on ethnicity and diagnostic criteria adopted [ 12 ] .
the aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden of gdm over the last pregnancy tem in italy compared to normal pregnancies ( i.e. , euglycemia ) from a national healthcare system perspective .
methods a model covering a period of three months ( around 90 days ) ranging from the 28th gestational week until childbirth ( included ) was built in microsoft excel ( 2013 ) and tree age pro ( 2015 ) .
data sources data from the italian national hospital discharge database ( hdd ) provided by the ministry of health were accessed in order to obtain information about the women 's characteristics and types of childbirth in gdm and normal pregnancies [ 13 ] .
the database covers all hospitalizations in any public or private healthcare facility in any part of italy .
women who gave birth were identified through specific diagnosis - related group ( drg ) codes ( 370 - 375 ) for birth or using international classification of disease - 9th revision - clinical modification ( icd9 - cm ) diagnostic codes that indicated childbirth ( details are available on request ) where resulting drg codes were outside the expected range ( e.g. , for severe complications requiring surgery ) .
gdm cases were discerned in the hdd using the icd9 - cm code 648.8 , either in the birth admission or through linking the identification ( id ) number of the mother to admissions during a three - month period prior to delivery .
drg codes ( 370 - 375 ) were used to discriminate among the different delivery methods and calculate the corresponding probabilities and costs in gdm and euglycemia ( excluding those admissions for childbirth with other drg codes ) .
a separate database of the infants' hospitalizations for birth was extracted , which was used to estimate the average hospitalization costs of infants affected by neonatal complications frequently associated with gdm as compared to a normal newborn 's cost .
probabilities of gdm - related neonatal outcomes were obtained from the literature since it was not possible to identify children born to gdm mothers .
in hdd , about one third of the newborns lack a unique id code ( i.e. , unique ids , assigned after birth , are not always included in the birth discharge record ) ; the date of birth , age in days and residence are not provided ; and no code exists to link infants with their mothers in the dataset .
after a review of the literature , we agreed to rely on a large retrospective study of 36,241 women with and without gdm that allowed all risk varying according to the presence or not of macrosomia ( i.e. , birthweight >= 4 kg ) [ 14 ] .
indeed , gdm is an established risk factor for macrosomia , which is in turn associated with several adverse neonatal outcomes [ 2 ] .
the probability of giving birth to a normal infant was obtained by difference in the model .
the number of births in 2014 ( 502,596 ) as reported by official statistics [ 15 ] was used as a ' proxy ' of the number of pregnant women in the same period , although their number might be slightly different due to multiple pregnancies and stillbirths .
cost analysis the cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the italian national health service .
italy has a tax - based system funded mainly through reimbursement tariffs using drgs for hospital care and national / regional tariffs for outpatient services and materials ( with some use of additional subsidies from individual regions to their hospitals and patient co - payments for medications and outpatient services ) .
in this study , antenatal outpatient and inpatient delivery costs broken down between mother and infant were calculated in gdm and euglycemia , respectively ; drg tariffs were used as a ' proxy ' for inpatient costs .
no discounting was applied as the time horizon was shorter than one year .
mothers' delivery costs were calculated as drg tariffs adjusted for the length of stay ( los ) .
in detail , a cost per admission day was obtained for each delivery method by dividing the official tariff by the average los in days across all women in labor identified in the hdd .
then , the daily cost was multiplied by the average los in gdm and euglycemic women , respectively , in order to obtain the average cost of a delivery stay in the two women 's groups .
in this cost calculation , we excluded ' outliers' defined as admissions with a los above the 99degrees percentile in the hdd. from the infant 's perspective , no cost values were assigned to macrosomia as such , but only to the events that followed ; we calculated the average cost of admissions reporting each complication considered in the model adjusted for the los .
for example , the cost associated with respiratory distress represented the average reimbursement tariff of all admissions reporting icd9 - cm diagnostic code 769 ( neonatal respiratory distress ) in the hdd 2014 .
in the model , the cost of a normal childbirth was assessed at euro560 ( drg 391 ) .
an average cost per case was obtained in gdm and euglycemia , respectively , as the sum of the products of probabilities and costs attached to each maternal and neonatal event considered in the model .
therefore , the annual economic burden of gdm in italy for the year 2014 was estimated by multiplying the number of gdm cases ( using a prevalence rate of 10.9 % [ 8 ]) by the difference in cost per case between gdm and euglycemia [ 2 ] .
sensitivity analyses we conducted both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses in order to test the robustness of base case results .
one - way sensitivity analyses were applied by varying (+/ - 20 %) the probabilities retrieved from the literature ( i.e. , infant complications ) and all inpatient costs in the model .
in probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( i.e. , monte carlo simulations ) , probabilities were modeled using a beta distribution and costs using a gamma distribution .
results mother 's characteristics after exclusions for lack of a unique ( blinded ) id ( 44,402 , 9.1 %) and accounting for multiple pregnancies in one year ( 122 ) , the characteristics of the 445,812 pregnant women uniquely identified in the database and delivering in 2014 were preliminarily investigated and presented in table 1 .
women with a gdm diagnosis were more likely to be in advanced maternal age , overweight - bmi >= 25 kg / m2 and / or obese - bmi >= 30 kg / m2 ( icd9 - cm : 649.1 ; 278.0 ) , have a nationality other than italian and a lower educational level compared to euglycemic ones .

in this study , we assumed all gdm diagnoses occurred at the 28th week of gestation .
accordingly , table 2 summarizes resources consumption and costs associated with the different blood glucose states during the last pregnancy trimester .
insulin - treated gdm patients ( 14 %) [ 16 ] perform a blood glucose test four times a day ( i.e. , fasting , and 1 h after breakfast , lunch , and dinner ) with a portable glucometer , while those under a special diet and exercise regimen only can limit testing to two surveys per day [ 10 , 17 ] .
in case of variable consumption frequencies ( e.g. , once or twice a day ) , the lowest bound ( e.g. , once a day ) was conservatively adopted to estimate the costs .
the cost of insulin therapy was assessed by referring to the most prescribed drug ( i.e. , insulin aspart ) for gdm in italy .
additional visits and exams , including a visual field test for eye complications , were reported in gdm women during pregnancy [ 17 ] .
the cost of one oral 75 - g ogtt was included to account for an extra test prescribed to gdm women shortly after delivery [ 6 ]. fig. 1 screening and treatment path for gdm .

similarly , total inpatient costs ( mother and infant ) in gdm ( euro3242.8 ) outweighed those in normal pregnancies ( euro2751.9 ) .
overall , each pregnancy affected by gdm cost 29.2 % more than a pregnancy without gdm , with a cost per case difference of euro817.8 .
the number of pregnancies affected by gdm was estimated at 54,783 ( out of 502,596 births ) in 2014 , resulting in an extra cost of around euro44.8 million for the italian national health service .
sensitivity analyses in table 7 we showed the effects of varying selected parameters on the inpatient cost per case difference between gdm and euglycemia .
the largest impact on delta cost / case was obtained by varying +/ - 20 % the cost of cesarean section without complications in gdm , which yielded an interval of the cost difference equal to euro324.1 - euro657.7 .

the possible values ranged between euro2326.6 and euro3206.6 in euglycemia and euro2792.0 and euro3890.4 in gdm .
however , 80 % of the expected cost values were included in the range euro2577.7 - euro2915.7 in euglycemia and euro3053.7 - euro3415.6 in gdm .
under these simulations , inpatient cost per case difference between gdm and euglycemia might vary between euro138.0 and euro837.9 which , summed with the outpatient cost / case difference ( euro326.9 ) , would give an overall cost / case difference range of euro464.9 - euro1164.8. fig. 2 monte carlo probability distributions in euglycemia ( left ) and gdm ( right ) .
the figure shows monte carlo probability distribution ( 1000 iterations ) of the expected inpatient cost per case in euglycemia ( left ) and gdm ( right ) .
the most likely value ( the highest bar in the histogram ) corresponds to the base case result discussion main findings there is a lack of research on the burden associated with gdm in many countries , masking its potential importance for policy - makers .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to estimate the economic consequences of gdm in italy .
this analysis showed that pregnant women affected by gdm are more likely to present established risk factors such as obesity , advanced maternal age , non - italian citizenship , and low educational level and to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes .
even accounting for short - term medical costs only , the yearly economic burden of gdm was substantial ( euro44.8 million ) in 2014 .
at the outpatient level , a relevant difference in cost (+ 748 %) was observed between gdm and euglycemic women , while in terms of hospitalization , mother and infant costs were respectively 14.6 % and 22.3 % higher than in euglycemia .
these results remained robust after performing both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis .
strengths and limitations the main strength of this study was the availability of administrative data on hospital discharges for all women who delivered in 2014 in italy .
as a check on the reliability of the data , we measured an infant mortality rate of 3.3 per 1000 live births , which is in line with the rate of 3.1 in published data for italy [ 15 ] .
however , our database contained fewer women ( 445,812 ) uniquely identified as giving births than those reported by official statistics ( 502,596 ) , likely due to exclusions for incomplete ( blinded ) id codes and inconclusive diagnostic and drg coding .
we also found wide , unexplained variation in the percentage of women with a gdm diagnosis among regions ( from 0.5 % in aosta valley to 6.1 % in tuscany ) and a low overall gdm rate (< 3 %) in hospital delivery records , even though clinical studies [ 8 , 9 ] and expert opinion estimated the prevalence to be 10 % or more in italy .
this inconsistency ( and presumed under - reporting ) is likely due to variation among regions in coding practices and number of diagnostic code fields reported at discharge , plus a lack of financial incentive to consistently record secondary diagnoses .
this is a main limiting factor in using administrative data rather than medical records for research purposes .
this analysis also presented a few additional limitations .
first , the costs associated to gdm were likely to be underestimated for several reasons .
for example , we only considered the public expenditure for gdm , while out - of - pocket expenses for extra visits and exams , nutritional supplements , food substitution and physical activity may be substantial .
moreover , we did not consider that gdm can be diagnosed at an earlier pregnancy stage ( 16th - 18th week ) in high - risk women , nor that it may be under diagnosed in women without any of the risk factors required to perform the ogtt test .
we also disregarded that women can be admitted at the hospital during the pre - delivery period for complications related to gdm , and that patient compliance in performing daily glucose tests or assuming the prescribed therapies may not be perfect .
second , the data sources for mother 's and infant 's events were very different , since for the latter it was not possible to derive gdm - related probabilities from the hdd due to the unknown mother 's glycemic status ; in particular , we referred to a single study [ 14 ] reporting perinatal outcomes in infants born in san francisco before 2006 .
until now , no study has reported all the neonatal outcomes of interest for italy through a comparison between gdm and non - gdm women , thus it was not possible to refer to a more recent and country - specific study .
however , some of the outcomes reported by the reviewed study [ 14 ] were aligned with the values indicated in the italian literature ; for example , in gdm , fetal distress was estimated at 3.4 % and hypoglycemia at 2.5 % in the study by lapolla et al .
[ 18 ] ; unfortunately , the authors did not provide these figures for normal pregnancies .
third , we adopted a national reference for reimbursement tariffs to model costs , although tariffs may vary at the regional level in italy .
the inter - regional unitary tariff for drgs is the best available estimate of hospitalization costs across regions , although it represents an approximation of real costs ; the production cost , indeed , is only one of the variables used for setting tariffs [ 19 ] .
thus , we performed sensitivity analysis on inpatient costs to consider any potential variations .
interpretation according to the literature , the gdm rate is growing rapidly worldwide with a consequent large healthcare cost increase [ 20 ] .
a cluster - randomized trial from finland [ 21 ] reported that mean healthcare costs , including both inpatient and outpatient care before and after delivery , were 25 % higher in women diagnosed with gdm ( euro6432 ) than among euglycemic women ( euro5143 ) in the 2007 - 2009 period .
moreover , women affected by gdm were more likely to be in advanced maternal age , overweight or obese and with a low educational level .
a recent modeling study [ 2 ] conducted in the us estimated a short - term cost of gdm of $ 1.8 billion in 2014 ( corresponding to around euro1.5 billion ) using a prevalence rate of 5.5 % , which might underestimate the real gdm burden since the us did not adopt the iadspg criteria [ 22 ] .
the average additional cost per case was $ 15,593 ( around euro13,700 ) .
due to differences in methodological approaches and healthcare financing systems , findings from previous studies were hardly comparable with ours ; however , they confirmed a substantial economic burden of gdm at least in developed countries .
this study , unlike the finnish one , did not adopt an experimental design , and relied instead on heterogeneous data sources to estimate the costs of gdm in italy ; however , by using administrative data , we could review a much larger sample of observations that those generally available in empirical studies .
conclusions this study should be interpreted as a first step towards further research in diabetes in pregnancy and highlights the need of collecting additional data regarding gdm in italy and elsewhere .
parameters included in this model are likely to be used in future cost - effectiveness analyses of novel gdm treatments or preventive interventions targeted to women of childbearing age .
our analysis focused on the gestational period only , but long - term consequences of gdm in mother ( i.e. , type 2 diabetes ) and infant ( i.e. , type 2 diabetes , congenital malformations , obesity , and cardiovascular diseases ) are likely to increase the estimated economic burden .
thus , additional studies investigating gdm - related effects over mothers' and infants' lifetimes are also needed .

the gastroenterology residents - in - training ( grit ) course is held in conjunction with the annual canadian digestive disease week .
the format of the grit course requires gastroenterology trainees to submit an abstract , and if accepted , the abstract is presented .
at ubc , it is strongly recommended that trainees submit to the meeting .
a questionnaire composed of 11 multiple choice questions was sent to all former and current trainees .
the aim was to assess the utility of the grit course from a ubc academic perspective by reviewing the outcomes ( including publication and presentation at international meetings ) of the projects submitted and to determine the value of the process to the trainees .
88.8 % of fellows responded ( 32 of 36 ) .
43.75 % are currently working in academic centers , 37.5 % are in the community , and 18.75 % are still in training ( that may be extra to core gi training ) .
the grit abstract was a case report ( 33.3 %) , a clinical research ( 61.9 %) , or a basic science project ( 4.8 %) .
43.75 % were presented at international meetings .
68.75 % were published ( only one was a nonpeer review paper ) .
the reasons for not publishing were " too busy and not enough time given during my training " ( 22.2 %) , " the abstract was appropriate for the grit / cddw meeting , i did not feel that it was strong enough to be published in a journal " ( 44.5 %) , and " the abstract reported work that was part of a greater research project and i was not significantly involved in the overall project " ( 33.3 %) .
21.8 % received awards for their projects either at the grit course or at ubc trainee research days .
68.3 % thought the grit experience was worthwhile , although one responder thought it was irrelevant .
to the best of our knowledge there are only two papers published in canadian literature that have looked at the publication rates of trainee research projects .
gill et al .
[ 1 ] in 2001 reported a ubc medical resident research day conversion to publication rates of 28 % .
hung and duffett [ 2 ] , reporting canadian pharmacy resident conversion rates , found only 32.3 % of resident projects became publications and only 20.6 % became full papers .
although the sample size is comparatively small , our grit course experience appears to differ as more than two - thirds of the projects were published .
importantly , most responders thought that the grit experience was worthwhile .
we speculate that there are many reasons why the publication rate was higher in our gi trainees .
the trainees , being older than those studied by gill et al .
[ 1 ] and hung and duffett [ 2 ] , may have been more motivated because of pressure to improve cvs and obtain faculty positons after training .
the faculty may also have been more motivated to " push " the trainees to complete and publish the research project .
regardless , at ubc , it appears that the grit course has been a successful and rewarding experience for trainees .
competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

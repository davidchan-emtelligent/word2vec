synchronous firing among the elements of forming circuits is critical for stabilization of synapses .
understanding the nature of these local network interactions during development can inform models of circuit formation .
within cortex , spontaneous activity changes throughout development .
unlike the adult , early spontaneous activity occurs in discontinuous population bursts separated by long silent periods , suggesting a high degree of local synchrony .
however , whether the micro - patterning of activity within early bursts is unique to this early age and specifically tuned for early development is poorly understood , particularly within the column .
to study this we used single - shank multi - electrode array recordings of spontaneous activity in the visual cortex of non - anesthetized neonatal mice to quantify single - unit firing rates , and applied multiple measures of network interaction and synchrony throughout the period of map formation and immediately after eye - opening .
we find that despite co - modulation of firing rates on a slow time scale ( hundreds of ms ) , the number of coactive neurons , as well as pair - wise neural spike - rate correlations , are both lower before eye - opening .
in fact , on post - natal days ( p ) 6 - 9 correlated activity was lower than expected by chance , suggesting active decorrelation of activity during early bursts .
neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus developed in an opposite manner , becoming less correlated after eye - opening .
population coupling , a measure of integration in the local network , revealed a population of neurons with particularly strong local coupling present at p6 - 11 , but also an adult - like diversity of coupling at all ages , suggesting that a neuron 's identity as locally or distally coupled is determined early .
the occurrence probabilities of unique neuronal " words " were largely similar at all ages suggesting that retinal waves drive adult - like patterns of co - activation .
these findings suggest that the bursts of spontaneous activity during early visual development do not drive hyper - synchronous activity within columns .
rather , retinal waves provide windows of potential activation during which neurons are active but poorly correlated , adult - like patterns of correlation are achieved soon after eye - opening .
visual cortex development spontaneous activity synchronization retinal wave oscillation spindle - burst national eye institute10.13039 / 100000053ey022730 introduction connectivity during development is achieved by synapse formation under the control of molecular guidance cues , and modification of these synapses by neural activity ( katz and shatz , 1996 ) .
activity influences circuit formation by coordinating firing between pre and post - synaptic neurons ( zhang and poo , 2001 ; kirkby et al. , 2013 ) .
thus , the degree of synchronization is a critical characteristic that determines the mechanisms of activity - dependent development ( butts and kanold , 2010 ) , but how synchronization and local network interactions change between critical epochs of development , for example between early spontaneously generated activity and later sensory experience , is poorly understood , particularly within single columns in isocortex .
two broad models of circuit formation exist .
in the " refinement " model , early hyper - connectivity caused by random synaptogenesis is replaced during a period of refinement with mature connections ( purves and lichtman , 1980 ) .
in the " constructionist " model , correct connections emerge gradually without a period of hyper - connectivity ( quartz and sejnowski , 1997 ) .
these models are not mutually exclusive and can reference anatomical connectivity as well as functional connectivity .
in the visual system there is clear anatomical and functional refinement of visuotopic connectivity ( huberman et al. , 2008 ) .
the rules guiding formation of columnar connectivity in cortex , within a single topographic location , are more poorly understood .
one possibility ( refinement model ) is that all neurons respond synchronously to low - frequency maps such as topography before network fractionation into local microcircuits , such as for orientation or direction selectivity ( white and fitzpatrick , 2007 ; butts and kanold , 2010 ) .
such synchronization would be driven by anatomical hyper - connectivity , but also by circuit properties such as weak inhibition , excitatory gabaa currents , long channel decay - time , abundant electrical connectivity , and high neuron excitability which increase synchronization and reduce the specificity of neuronal responses ( blankenship and feller , 2010 ; cossart , 2011 ; dehorter et al. , 2012 ) .
a constructionist perspective would predict that synchronization emerges gradually and in parallel with the specialization of neuronal function by cell class and / or response properties ( erwin and miller , 1998 ; crowley and katz , 2002 ) .
a substantial body of evidence suggests early cortical development is governed by a refinement model .
the period of circuit formation is a time of dramatic shift in the patterns of activity ( khazipov et al. , 2013 ; ackman and crair , 2014 ) suggesting that early connectivity and function is substantially different from later development .
in particular , early activity differs from the adult due to the presence of long periods of network silence and the presence of strong network oscillations ( luhmann et al. , 2016 ) , giving the early cortex the appearance of extreme synchronization .
acute slices display waves of synchronized activity during a limited developmental period ( ben - ari et al. , 1989 ; moody and bosma , 2005 ; allene et al. , 2008 ) that result from unique circuit configurations ( dupont et al. , 2006 ; bonifazi et al. , 2009 ) .
in vivo , early cortical activity is characterized by bursts of rapid oscillations that synchronize multi - unit firing ( yang et al. , 2009 ; brockmann et al. , 2011 ; minlebaev et al. , 2011 ) .
calcium imaging in vivo shows hypersynchrony in superficial layers relative to mature patterns ( golshani et al. , 2009 ; rochefort et al. , 2009 ; siegel et al. , 2012 ) .
while these previous studies give an impression of cortical hyper - synchrony during map formation , they lack cellular resolution , do not sample the cortical depth and / or lack temporal resolution to determine spike correlations within a cortical column .
we therefore used multi - electrode array recordings combined with spike - sorting of units measured throughout the depth of individual cortical columns to measure columnar synchronization in the developing visual cortex , a region for which the primary drivers of developmental activity and their role in circuit formation are largely known ( huberman et al. , 2008 ; ackman and crair , 2014 ) .
during initial circuit formation ( before eye - opening ) , activity in visual cortex is driven by spontaneous waves of activity in the retina ( ackman et al. , 2012 ; siegel et al. , 2012 ) .
these are amplified and shaped into oscillations by the unique properties of thalamic and cortical circuits ( weliky and katz , 1999 ; hanganu et al. , 2006 ; murata and colonnese , 2016 ) .
these early network properties are replaced by the mature cortical circuit dynamics when true vision develops around eye - opening ( rochefort et al. , 2011 ; colonnese , 2014 ; hoy and niell , 2015 ; smith et al. , 2015 ) .
we , therefore , examined statistical properties of local network interaction during the first three post - natal weeks , when cortical activity patterns are changing most rapidly .
we asked whether : ( 1 ) activity driven by retinal waves is indeed hyper - synchronous relative to post - eye opening , supporting a refinement model for cortical columnar connections ; or whether ( 2 ) this activity is similar to ( or even less synchronous than ) post - eye opening .
the latter would support a constructionist model , suggesting that early spontaneous activity does not consist of synchronous bursts , but rather windows of local activation allowing adult - like network dynamics to drive the formation of neural assemblies .
materials and methods animal care animal care and procedures were in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals ( nih ) and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the george washington university .
postnatal day ( p ) 0 is the day of birth .
c57bl / 6 were obtained from hilltop lab animals ( scottsdale , pa , usa ) as timed pregnant females , and kept in a designated , temperature and humidity - controlled room on 12 / 12 light / dark cycle .
in vivo electrophysiology recording techniques have been previously reported ( shen and colonnese , 2016 ) , and are reproduced here for clarity .
carprofen ( 20 mg / kg ) saline was injected 1 h prior to surgery to reduce pain and inflammation .
surgical anesthesia was induced with 3 % isoflurane vaporized in 100 % o2 , verified by tail - pinch , then reduced to 1.5 % - 3 % as needed by monitoring breathing rate .
a vented warming table ( 36degreesc , vetequip , livermore , ca , usa ) provided thermoreplacement .
for attachment of the head - fixation apparatus , the scalp was excised to expose the skull , neck muscles were detached from the occipital bone , and the membranes were removed from the surface of the skull .
topical analgesic was applied to the incision of animals older than p8 ( 2.5 % lidocaine / prilocaine mix , hi - tech pharmacy co. , inc. , amityville , ny , usa ) .
application to younger animals was lethal and discontinued .
the head - fixation apparatus was attached to the skull with grip cement ( dentsply , milford , de , usa ) over vetbondtm tissue adhesive ( 3m ) .
fixation bar consisted of a custom manufactured rectangular aluminum plate with a central hole for access to the skull .
after placement , the animal was maintained with 0.5 % - 1 % isoflurane until the dental cement cured , after which point it was allowed to recover from anesthesia on the warmed table .
for recording , animals were head - fixed and body movements were restricted by placement in a padded tube .
body temperature was monitored via thermometer placed under the abdomen and maintained between 33c and 36c via thermocouple heating pad ( fhc , bowdoin , me , usa ) .
body motion was monitored with a piezoelectric device placed below the restraint tube .
for electrode access , a craniotomy was performed thinning the skull if necessary and resecting small bone flaps , to produce a small opening (~ 150 - 300 mum diameter ) .
primary visual cortex was targeted by regression of adult brain lambda - bregma distances : 1.5 - 2.5 mm lateral and 0.0 - 0.5 mm rostral to lambda .
all recordings were made using a single shank , 32 channel array arranged in two parallel lines of contacts ( a1x32 - poly2 - 5mm - 50s - 177 , neuronexus technologies , ann arbor , mi , usa ) .
the electrode penetrated the brain orthogonally to the surface and advanced to a depth of 750 - 1000 mum using a micro - manipulator ( narishige , japan ) until the top channels touched the dura .
isoflurane was withdrawn and the animal was allowed to acclimate inside the setup for at least 80 min prior to recording .
following 20 min of visual stimulation the spontaneous recording reported here lasted 30 min .
all recording was performed in the dark (< 0.01 lumens ) .
in animals older than p8 , recording localization in monocular v1 was confirmed by the presence of a contralateral visual response to whole - field light flash that had the earliest response in layer 4 .
ipsilateral visual local field potential ( lfp ) responses less than 10 % of the contralateral response were also required .
all animals were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose followed by decapitation .
brains were immersion - fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for confirmation of electrode location .
data acquisition and analysis data was acquired at 32 khz using the digital lynx sx acquisition system and cheetah version 5.6.0 ( neuralynx , inc. , bozeman , mt , usa ) .
signals were band - passed 0.1 hz 9 khz and referenced to a sub - cortical contact in at the bottom of the array .
analysis utilized custom matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa ) routines and the open - source klustasuite for spike isolation , clustering and manual curation ( rossant et al. , 2016 ) .
a spike isolation strong threshold of 6 sd and weak threshold of 3 sd were needed to minimize low amplitude unclusterable spikes .
initial clustering was evaluated for merging or splitting of clusters based on visual waveform analysis and similarity .
after eliminating clusters composed of noise , clusters with no modulation of autocorrelation near 0 ms and / or clear superposition of two or more distinct waveforms that could not be separated were marked as multi - unit clusters .
the remaining , potentially single - unit , clusters were evaluated for inclusion as good single - units if the interspike interval ( isi ) refractory violations (< 2 ms ) accounted for less than 1 % of spikes .
all clusters were assigned a primary contact localization by determining the minima of the mean waveform .
spike - time was assigned by rounding the peak time to the nearest ms. the layer identity of each channel was made relative to l4 which was identified in an age - specific manner : after the emergence of visual responses on p8 , l4 was identified as the channel with the shortest latency 300 - 500 mum below the surface ; for p4 - p7 , which lack visual response , l4 was identified from spontaneous spindle - bursts as the lowest channel with visible rapid oscillations in the lfp ( colonnese and khazipov , 2010 ) .
for thalamic recordings , only clusters originating from contacts with multi - unit visual responses to 100 ms light flashes presented to the contralateral eye were used .
otherwise , procedures were identical to the visual cortex .
inactive periods ( down - states ) were identified by the method of renart et al .
( 2010 ) .
a total multi - unit activity ( tmua ) raster was created by summing spike occurrences of all multi and single - unit clusters .
to identify down - states , the tmua signal was smoothed ( gaussian kernel sd 50 ms ) ; periods where this convolved signal was less than 10 % of peak or where the isi was greater than 50 ms were marked as down - states .
" active " periods of duration less than 50 ms were reclassified as down - states .
for the calculation of " event size " ( figure 3 ) , only active periods were considered , and the number of single - units with at least one spike in sliding windows of 20 or 100 ms was determined .
only windows with more than one spike were considered .
probability for events of a given size was calculated by dividing the number of windows with events of a given size , by the total number of windows .
to calculate event size probability in animals with more than 12 good single units , event size was determined for a random selection of 12 units .
this process was repeated 20 times , and the mean probability of these repetitions was used for that animal .
to calculate the change in probability , spike - times were jittered within active periods by a random number drawn from the uniform distribution between - 1000 ms and 1000 ms and the probabilities recalculated .
binary firing vectors ( figure 4 ) were calculated using the shared matlab function as described ( okun et al. , 2012 ) .
for calculation of the raster - marginal , spikes were swapped between good neurons as well as mua but only for spikes in the same layer group ( l2 - 4 or l5 - 6 ) .
calculation of spike - rate correlation ( figure 5 ) followed the method of renart et al .
( 2010 ) .
each single - unit raster was convolved by a normalized kernel that was the sum of a rapid time - window ( j , 20 ms sd gaussian ) and a negative longer window ( t , 4xj ) .
this approximates the effect of jittering the spikes over the same window to remove distorting effects of slow co - modulations in spike - rate .
for comparison with truly random firing with locally appropriate spike - rates , jittered spike - trains (+/ - 1 s within active periods ) were calculated , spike - rate comodulation calculated , and this process was repeated 100 times to generate mean and 95 % confidence interval .
population coupling ( figure 6 ) was computed by the method of okun et al .
( 2015 ) .
a summed multi - unit raster was created from the mua and single - units for l2 - 4 and l5 - 6 separately , convolved with a gaussian kernel ( 10 ms sd ) which was used for the spike - triggered average for each single - unit in the corresponding layer group .
a normalized spike - triggered rate was made after calculating the raster marginal as described above , the peak amplitude of which is used to normalize each animal 's population coupling .

results we examined spontaneous activity in monocular visual cortex of unanesthetized , head - fixed mice .
multi - unit and lfp analysis of this same data - set has been previously reported ( shen and colonnese , 2016 ) .
recordings targeted five key developmental age groups : p6 - 7 and p8 - 9 during the period of cholinergic retinal waves , when topography and eye specificity is established ; p10 - 11 during the period of glutamatergic retinal waves ; p15 - 17 after eye - opening , during the pre - critical period ( smith and trachtenberg , 2007 ) when cortical state modulation of spontaneous activity has emerged ; and p24 during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity when mature cortical dynamics are largely in place ( hoy and niell , 2015 ) .
recordings from animals at p4 and 5 yielded fewer than 10 clusters per animal ( mean 7 +/ - 3 sd ) , which was considered insufficient for network analysis .
network analysis was made by isolation of presumptive single - units from a single shank , dual column multi - electrode array placed perpendicular to the cortical layers , allowing for simultaneous recording from layer one though the top of layer six .
sorting using the masked em algorithm ( rossant et al. , 2016 ) was of similar quality between age groups ( figure 1 ) .
spike amplitudes in the youngest age group were lower and clustered near threshold , but overall the similarity of spike waveforms placed in the same cluster was comparable between age groups ( figures 1a,b ) .
refractory violations ( isis < 2 ms ) were rarer in young animals , likely as a result of lower spike - rates ( figure 2 ) , making this a less reliable index of cluster quality in neonates .
the number of well isolated (" good ") clusters extracted from each animal increased rapidly with age ( figure 1e ) .
this was not a result of more clusters or spikes rejected in young animals .
in fact , the proportion of total recorded spikes that were placed in good clusters was highest during the first 2 weeks ( figure 1f ) .
in general , while the lower size and reduced ability to use refractory violations to separate clusters increases the chances of multi - unit clusters , the reduced spike detection counteracts this effect .
we are confident that clustering effectively enriches for single neurons in all age groups .
because analysis of fewer neurons could bias results between age groups , when appropriate , analyses were performed on a random selection of 12 units ( the minimum number of good clusters isolated ) , calculating the relevant metrics , and repeating this process to generate a mean for the animal .
consistent with mua ( shen and colonnese , 2016 ) fewer deep layer single - units were isolated in p6 - 7 animals ( ratio 1.5 superficial / deep ) than in older animals ( p8 - 9 0.40 ; p10 - 11 0.48 ; p15 - 17 0.46 ; p24 0.56 ) .
we first asked whether age is associated with differences in the firing rates of individual neurons ( figure 2 ) .
as previously shown for unanesthetized mice ( adelsberger et al. , 2005 ; ackman et al. , 2012 ; shen and colonnese , 2016 ) and rats ( hanganu et al. , 2006 ; colonnese , 2014 ) , activity during the first 2 weeks post - natal is dominated by lengthy periods of network silence (" down - states ") .
the down - states are interrupted by periods of activation driven by spontaneous retinal waves ( p2 - 9 ) and then by retinal waves plus activity generated spontaneously within the cortex ( colonnese and khazipov , 2010 ) .
down - states lasting more than 200 ms disappear around eye - opening in rats ( colonnese , 2014 ) and mice ( shen and colonnese , 2016 ) .
single unit activity showed a similar pattern , being almost completely restricted to 2 - 10 s active periods occurring every 30 - 60 s at p6 - 11 .
extended periods of network silence were rare in the p15 - 17 or p24 groups ( figure 2d ) .
total single - unit spike - rates at p6 - 7 and p8 - 9 were at least an order of magnitude lower than juvenile rates ( figures 2e,f , left ) , with p10 - 11 rates intermediate .
however , if the down - states are removed and only periods of activation considered , then single - unit spike - rates were not significantly different between ages ( figures 2e,f , right ) , suggesting that active periods for spontaneous activity in young and old mice are similar , and that age differences in firing result from the prevalence of down - states during the first two post - natal weeks .
for comparison with previous non - clustered recordings ( colonnese et al. , 2010 ; shen and colonnese , 2016 ) , we present tmua spike rates ( which additionally includes spikes not placed in good clusters ) .
mua spike rates show significant increases both for total activity and during active periods , particularly between p11 and p14 ( figure 2f , bottom ) .
development of network synchronization and composition functional hyper - connectivity of inputs and / or local connections due to either increased connectivity or lack of desynchronizing inhibition is expected to result in activity events with high participation rates , as has been observed by calcium imaging of layer 2 / 3 in vivo ( rochefort et al. , 2009 ; siegel et al. , 2012 ) .
because firing during early ages is largely restricted to the troughs of spindle - burst oscillations we first measured event participation in 20 ms windows , approximately the window of firing during these early oscillations ( hanganu et al. , 2006 ; colonnese and khazipov , 2010 ) .
to measure columnar event participation , we calculated the percentage of single - units active ( at least 1 spike ) in sliding 20 ms windows .
event participation rates show clearly that early activity is not hyper - synchronous ( figure 3a ) .
in fact , participation rates in the youngest group ( p6 - 7 ) is similar to juvenile ( p15 - 17 and p24 ) , and activity is less synchronous at p8 - 9 and p10 - 11 before achieving stable values by p15 ( figure 3c ) .
event participation is affected by spike - rate as well as spike timing .
to control for the former , we calculated the change in event probability after jittering spike times by a random amount between +/ - 1 s within active periods and calculating a deviation index ( prob - probjitt )/( prob + probjitt ) .
this analysis showed that event participation during the periods of retinal waves ( p6 - 11 ) were actually lower than expected from random firing , while the juvenile synchrony is slightly higher than expected ( figures 3b,d ) .
currents in young neurons have longer decay times , potentially increasing the integration time and tolerance for synchrony .
we therefore examined a longer time window for neural events ( 100 ms ) which encompasses a complete cycle of the early oscillations .
event size was larger for 100 ms windows , as expected , but the relative synchronization of firing between ages was similar to 20 ms windows ( figures 3e - h ) .
thus , regardless of window size , event participation rates of neonates are lower than those of juveniles and lower even than expected by chance given neuronal firing rates .
this suggests that activity in the neonatal cortex is actively decoupled .
our event participation data reject the hypothesis that mature neuronal ensembles are formed by fractioning larger ensembles but obscure the specifics of which neurons fire together .
to understand the development of neural ensembles we used an analysis of the occurrence of unique binary spike vectors , or " neural words " ( fiser et al. , 2004 ; figure 4a ) .
the occurrence of specific words is tested against the distribution expected by random firing , modeled here by random jittering the occurrence of spikes +/ - 1 s. we examined word distributions for words three neurons or longer in 20 ms windows .
as expected given the larger number of good clusters in older animals , the total number of observed words increased with development , however word occurrence was greater than expected for random activity at all ages ( figures 4b,c ) .
the mean of the observed probability - predicted probability ( by chance ) was larger in in p6 - 11 animals than p15 - 17 and p24 ( figure 4f ) .
this relationship could indicate that connectivity in the young network is more strongly non - random than juvenile , or that the network property which synchronizes spike - timing regardless of ensemble participation is stronger in young animals ( okun et al. , 2012 ) , consistent with the presence of spindle - burst oscillations during this time period .
to distinguish between these possibilities we predicted word occurrence distributions using the raster marginal method ( okun et al. , 2012 ) , which swaps spikes between clusters , thereby keeping intact temporal restraints on spike - timing but randomizing occurrences within clusters .
mean observed - predicted occurrence using the marginal control was near or below zero for all ages , and not different between age groups ( figures 4d - f ) , suggesting that at all ages there exist fewer functional interconnections between neurons than would be expected by chance .
neural firing rate correlations increase during development spike - rate correlations reflect neural connectivity filtered through cellular , synaptic and circuit properties influencing synchronization , particularly inhibition ( renart et al. , 2010 ; helias et al. , 2014 ) .
ineffective inhibition , neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperconnectivity would be expected to increase spike - rate correlations in infant cortex , as has been observed for calcium signal in somatosensory cortex ( golshani et al. , 2009 ) .
to test this we calculated the distributions of pair - wise spike - rate correlations for all good units in an animal .
spike - rate correlations were evaluated by quantifying spike - rate comodulation within a rapid time window ( t = 20 ms full width at half amplitude gaussian ) corrected for slow modulation of firing rates ( j = 80 ms ; renart et al. , 2010 ) .
pairs were also subdivided into superficial ( l2 - 4 ) and deep ( l5 - 6 ) to assay the development of local vs. total synchronization .
because the presence of down - states , which increase correlations by enforcing silence in almost all neurons , changes dramatically during development , we examined correlation distributions for total activity as well as when restricted to active periods .
the spike correlation distributions for total activity were grossly similar at all ages ( figure 5 ) .
the large majority of pairs had correlations near zero , but the distribution evidenced a right - ward shift toward a larger proportion of correlated neuron pairs than expected by chance ( jittered spikes ) that grew stronger with age .
as a result , the mean spike correlation of each animal increased when measured between all neurons , as well when restricted to deep or superficial neurons ( figure 5b ) .
limiting the analysis to active periods caused a leftward shift in the correlation distribution at all ages .
this shift was much larger for neonatal animals , even resulting in mean correlations below zero for the p6 - 7 and p8 - 9 groups .
thus at these youngest ages , firing rates are less correlated on a short time - scale ( 20 ms ) than expected by chance , suggesting inhibitory or other another desynchronizing element is powerful even during early development .
as a result of the negative mean correlations in neonates , developmental increases in mean correlation were significant for total , superficial and deep neurons ( figure 5b ) .
calcium imaging studies have described developmental desynchronization of layer 2 / 3 activity ( golshani et al. , 2009 ; rochefort et al. , 2009 ) , opposite from the increasing synchronization we observed here .
while multiple factors could contribute to this difference , the effective integration window for firing is a prominent difference between our spike - rate correlations and calcium imaging .
to examine the role of integration window on mean spike - rate correlations , we systematically varied t ( with j also increasing at 4 * t ) .
this showed a strong , age dependence of correlation on integration window ( figure 5c ) .
for total activity , as integration windows approach 400 ms the developmental relationships between neonatal and juvenile animals reverse , with activity at p6 - 11 becoming more synchronous than p15 - 17 and p24 .
thus during the period of retinal waves , neurons show co - modulation of firing rates on the time scale of these waves , but synchronization within waves is lower than or similar to juvenile levels .
when correlations were limited to active periods , integration window does not have as dramatic an effect .
however , negative mean correlations present in neonates were only present when t was less than 300 ms. to determine if this dependence of integration window was the result of changing t or j , we varied j while keeping t constant .
correlations were largely unchanged out to a j of 3 s ( data not shown ) , beyond the duration of a single retinal wave ( blankenship and feller , 2010 ; ackman et al. , 2012 ) .
finally , because maximal negative mean correlation is inversely proportional to the number of neurons , we recalculated pair - wise correlations for n = 12 neurons in all groups ( data not shown ) .
mean correlations were not significantly different in this n limited case , showing that the growth of correlation with age is a true effect of development , not of the number of neurons isolated by spike - sorting .
such low correlation between cortical neurons is surprising given that the contacts sit within a single topographic locale and neuron firing in all layers is temporally limited to the troughs of spindle - burst oscillations ( colonnese and khazipov , 2010 ) .
to determine the effect of retinal waves and synaptic refinement on correlation in a structure with known refinement of input connectivity ( chen and regehr , 2000 ; ziburkus and guido , 2006 ) , we analyzed spike - rate correlation in the region of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus responsive to the contralateral eye .
in contrast to the cortex , lgn neurons at p9 - 10 when poly - innervation by retinal ganglion cells is high , were largely positively correlated both with total activity as well as when analysis was limited to active periods only ( figures 5d,e ). by p14 - 16 , when poly - innervation is reduced , correlations become centered around zero , similar to cortex at the same age .
thus in a structure with demonstrated refinement of connectivity , pair - wise spike correlations show heightened synchronization .
in total , while the pair - wise firing rate correlations in the cortex are sensitive to integration window , within physiologically relevant time intervals for spike integration ( 10 - 300 ms ) , they are robust and consistent with increasing connectivity driving synchronization of the neural activity during cortical development .
combined with event participation , firing rate correlations suggest that early networks contain decorrelating influences that keep synchronization below that expected by chance given firing rates and patterns .
characteristics of local network integration are established early in development neurons vary in their local vs. distal connectivity , a feature that is correlated with the degree to which their firing is coupled to mean firing rates in the local network , called " population coupling " ( okun et al. , 2015 ) .
we hypothesized that hyper - connectivity during early development would result in increased population coupling and fewer neurons with activity that is independent of local firing ( so called " soloists ") .
to test this we calculated the spike - triggered multi - unit activity for each good unit .
triggered spike rates are converted to standardized " population coupling " by normalization to the same measure for spikes shifted using the raster marginal method , thereby constructing a mean coupling for the animal that can be used to normalize between groups .
the temporal characteristics and signal - to - noise of population coupling changed dramatically between p6 - 7 and p15 - 17 , but all ages showed dramatic variance in the absolute degree of coupling .
every animal had neurons with strong coupling as well as neurons with little or even negative coupling ( figure 6a ) .
the total distribution of normalized spike - rates showed a similar pattern of diverse coupling in each age group , with a peak between 0.5 and 1 ( figure 6c ) .
the three youngest age groups ( p6 - 11 ) had an additional population of highly coupled neurons that was not apparent in the older ages .
as a result at these ages population coupling was negatively correlated with spike rate ( figure 6d ) and mean coupling was reduced with age ( figure 6e ). by p15 , population coupling is not correlated with spike - rates similar to adults ( okun et al. , 2015 ) .
in total our results show that while population coupling is elevated for a sub - population of low - firing neurons during early development , neurons with weak and strong population coupling exist even in the youngest networks .
these results suggest that a neuron 's relative local integration is established early and maintained throughout development .
discussion here we used multi - electrode array based spike - sorting in very young , head - fixed mice to quantify features of local network interaction within a visual cortical column during the period of spontaneous retinal waves and compared these to spontaneous activity in the week after eye - opening , when many aspects of ongoing cortical activity emerge ( rochefort et al. , 2009 , 2011 ; hoy and niell , 2015 ) .
our primary finding is that - - despite the macro - patterning of activity present in cortex during the period of retinal waves , in which long silent periods are interrupted by large oscillations that control firing times ( hanganu et al. , 2006 ; colonnese and khazipov , 2010 ) , suggesting hypersynchrony of the developing network - - the firing of cortical neurons is remarkably uncorrelated and adult - like patterns of network interaction are achieved remarkably early , either during the period of glutamatergic retinal waves or immediately after eye - opening .
our results support a constructionist model of vertical circuit formation in cortex , rather than one of exuberant connectivity followed by refinement , and suggest that retinal waves provide activity remarkably more similar to adult activation than might be expected .
calcium vs. action potentials in network analysis and function our results differ from in vivo calcium imaging studies , which indicate a decrease in correlation between layer 2 / 3 neurons ( golshani et al. , 2009 ; rochefort et al. , 2009 ; siegel et al. , 2012 ) , likely because of the time course over which synchronization is measured .
integrating spike - rates on the timescale of calcium indicators selectively increased the pair - wise correlations of young neurons ( figure 5c ) .
current - clamp recordings suggest that early hyper - synchronization observed in imaging is due to increased firing probability during the " up " - states of the slow - wave ( golshani et al. , 2009 ; colonnese , 2014 ) , and not co - participation of neurons in local ensembles , which appears to grow ( berkes et al. , 2011 ) or remain similar ( figure 3 ) during development .
one important caveat to the current results is that the increased temporal and single - spike resolution of electrophysiology comes with the inherent ambiguity of spike - sorting .
the smaller transmembrane currents of young neurons make action - potentials less likely to be detected on multiple electrodes and reduce waveform variability , potentially compromising sorting .
current spike - sorting quality metrics emphasize separation and reduction of over - splitting ( hill et al. , 2011 ) and the application of these metrics to the high - dimensional space of large arrays is not standard ( harris et al. , 2016 ; rossant et al. , 2016 ) .
confirmation that the spikes in a single cluster originate from a single neuron relies on visual confirmation of waveform and elimination of clusters with high rates of refractory period violation .
the low spike - rate of young animals should cause an increase in false negatives ( failure to reject poly - neuronal clusters ) .
thus while spike waveform consistency was similar between ages ( figure 1 ) , it remains possible that more " good " clusters in young animals contain multiple neurons , which may explain some of the increase in number of neurons isolated with age .
the developmental growth in correlations is unlikely to result solely from poor sorting , however , as it is also evident in multi - unit activity measured at similar ages ( berzhanskaya et al. , 2017 ) .
another potential issue is the necessary sparse sampling of neurons by our arrays and the under - sampling of neurons in young tissue as a result of their smaller action potentials .
this under - sampling appears to result in our detection of fewer neurons in p6 - 11 animals .
imaging studies indicate that close to all l2 - 3 neurons make calcium events at these ages ( siegel et al. , 2012 ) , so it is unlikely that there is large population of silent neurons that comes " online " only after eye - opening .
current - clamp recordings find action potentials in a large majority of neurons recorded ( colonnese , 2014 ) , supporting the possibility that the low number of neurons observed is simple failure to pick up small action potentials from distant neurons .
we have tried to correct as best as possible for the computational biases of this under - sampling by limiting the network analyses in older animals to subgroups of the same number of neurons as in young .
using the same methods in thalamus , we were able to detect clear reductions in synchronization , suggesting that similar changes would have been apparent in cortex if they were present .
finally , it is not clear whether action potentials or calcium fluxes are the relevant components for plasticity .
retinal waves induce plateau potentials in cortical neurons ( colonnese , 2014 ) which both suppress action potentials and may cause neurotransmitter release .
thus the poor synchronization of action potentials may be compensated by synchrony of calcium transients and sub - threshold depolarization .
constructionism vs. refinement our results support a " constructivist " model of intra - columnar cortical development in which correct connections , informed by guidance molecules and confirmed by activity , are largely made early , without large - scale elimination of incorrect connections ( quartz and sejnowski , 1997 ; katz and crowley , 2002 ) .
we observed no reduction in event participation , word distributions , or pair - wise correlations , which would be expected if the network experienced a period of widespread functional hyper - connectivity followed by synapse elimination .
this does not mean that inappropriate synapses are not formed and eliminated within cortical columns .
rather , it means inappropriate synapses are a minority of total synapses , and play little functional role .
map formation in the cortex may be different from sub - cortical regions such as thalamus and superior colliculus that are the initial recipients of topographic connections .
these regions do incur periods of exuberant synaptic connectivity ( chen and regehr , 2000 ; lu and constantine - paton , 2004 ; ziburkus and guido , 2006 ) , and we actually observed a reduction in firing rate correlations in lgn while they were increasing in cortex .
our results are consistent with multiple findings that thalamocortical and cortico - cortical connectivity is refined very early ( chiu and weliky , 2002 ; katz and crowley , 2002 ; ko et al. , 2013 ; yang et al. , 2013 ) .
our results expand upon these by showing that within topographically aligned columns functional connectivity is sparse even during initial map formation .
early and consistent refinement may be specific to intra - columnar circuits , which reflect a single topographic location , while horizontal connectivity may be subject to different rules .
studies have observed both increases and decreases in horizontal synchronization during development ( callaway and katz , 1990 ; fiser et al. , 2004 ; minlebaev et al. , 2011 ) .
one of our more unexpected findings is that variance in population coupling is present from as early as intra - cortical synapses are present and can drive activity locally ( blue and parnavelas , 1983 ; valiullina et al. , 2016 ) .
while we cannot prove that early " soloists " , neurons with low population coupling ( okun et al. , 2015 ) , are the same neurons that become adult soloists , our data suggest that this identity is set early , even before many of the long - range connections that will drive soloists are formed .
the existence of a population of low - firing neurons with high - population coupling at p5 - 9 is at first glance contradictory to the pair - wise spike - rate correlations , which show lower local correlation at these ages .
we suspect this early high - coupling , which occurs on a much slower time course than coupling in adults , exists because of the massive modulation of all activity in visual cortex by the slow retinal waves .
this is reflected in the net positive jittered pair - wise correlations ( figure 5a gray lines ) .
thus , in total , our results are consistent with a model of early activity in which retinal waves increase firing rates globally , but the microstructure of correlations within this activation window is actually lower than for post - wave " spontaneous " activity .
it is possible that the low - firing highly - coupled neurons are the youngest neurons which have not integrated into the local network , but still receive shared input from thalamus or widely distributed but weak local connectivity .
mechanisms of activity - dependent development while much is still poorly understood about the process leading to the formation of refined cortical ensembles , our data clearly indicate they do not emerge from larger , less refined functionally connected groups of neurons .
in fact , in the youngest animals ( p6 - 7 and p8 - 9 ) neuronal firing is actually less synchronous than would be expected by chance .
this was true for both the participation rates as well as pair - wise correlations .
reduced spike - fidelity in young animals ( valeeva et al. , 2010 ) , combined with corticocortical connectivity , both electrical and chemical , that is very low ( yu et al. , 2012 ) , predict correlations near chance .
however , the negative correlations require a desynchronizing element to decorrelate activity driven by the massively synchronous spindle - burst oscillations coming from thalamus ( helias et al. , 2014 ) .
during this limited early period , thalamic axons synapse on inhibitory subplate neurons ( kanold and luhmann , 2010 ) as well as somatostatin neurons in layer 5 ( marques - smith et al. , 2016 ; tuncdemir et al. , 2016 ) before shifting to their adult targets , providing one possible mechanism of inhibitory desynchronization .
an implication of this anti - correlation is that the net effect of correlation based plasticity should be toward the elimination of new synapses , a phenotype observed in superior colliculus for the same ages ( colonnese and constantine - paton , 2006 ) .
in fact the only demonstrated synaptic plasticity in vivo during this time period is the elimination of poorly coordinated and ineffective synapses ( winnubst et al. , 2015 ) .
circuits , synapses and synchronization : the more they change the more they stay the same developing cortical networks undergo remarkable changes in the amount and pattern of neural activity ( khazipov et al. , 2013 ) .
in visual cortex , a large majority of the changes occur in rapid succession around eye - opening , though they are not strongly dependent on patterned vision .
at this time immature spindle - burst synchronization of neural firing ends , cortical waking and sleep states emerge , thalamic amplification of retinal input is down - regulated , and the capacity of the circuit to follow relevant high frequencies emerges ( colonnese et al. , 2010 ; rochefort et al. , 2011 ; colonnese , 2014 ; hoy and niell , 2015 ; shen and colonnese , 2016 ) .
somatosensory cortex makes a similar shift , though 4 days earlier , perhaps because whisking starts earlier than eye - opening ( colonnese et al. , 2010 ; minlebaev et al. , 2011 ) .
human infants undergo a similar shift 2 - 4 weeks before term ( tolonen et al. , 2007 ; colonnese et al. , 2010 ; fabrizi et al. , 2011 ; chipaux et al. , 2013 ) .
the synaptic and network mechanisms of this shift are unknown , though they likely involve increased action potential threshold , development of ascending neuromodulators and functional integration of gabaergic interneuron subtypes , particularly those mediating fast - feedforward inhibition ( luhmann and prince , 1991 ; daw et al. , 2007 ; golshani et al. , 2009 ; colonnese , 2014 ) .
inhibition is a controlling factor in many developmental transitions , particularly the onset of ocular dominance plasticity , leading to the suggestion they are " master " regulators of development , transforming activity in order to switch function ( le magueresse and monyer , 2013 ) .
we observed remarkable stability of the network properties between p10 - 11 and p15 - 16 , ages between which feedforward inhibition develops in visual cortex ( colonnese , 2014 ) .
thus , our results suggest an alternate framework , which is that inhibitory ( among other ) development occurs to maintain firing - rate and synchrony homeostasis in the face of increasing synaptic density and its inherent excitability ( hengen et al. , 2013 ). by this model , interneuron integration occurs not as a developmental program to transform activity , but as a bulwark against increasing activity resulting from excitatory synaptogenesis .
changes in the pattern of neuronal oscillations occurring at the same time may , in fact , be side - effects of the circuit changes obscuring the deeper similarity between early and late ages .
one conclusion of this homeostasis theory of network synchronization is that retinal - wave activity ( which dominates p6 - 11 firing ) does not drive unique early ensembles of hypersynchronous firing in order to induce wiring of a single column , a conclusion also observed by l2 / 3 calcium imaging ( siegel et al. , 2012 ) , but rather to model adult cortical activity .
it should be noted that the maintenance of correlational structure does not imply that individual neurons maintain connections across development .
in fact , mature local ensembles form by rearranging specific connections while maintaining the same total connectivity after eye - opening ( ko et al. , 2013 ) .
our result shows that despite large - scale changes in the factors that regulate synchronization in adults , network properties in young networks are maintained so that the firing correlations caused by early connectivity can be read out and modified to drive circuit formation and " refinement " .

background the effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) has been increasingly reported .
however , studies addressing the safety and application value of esd in elderly patients with early gastric cancer ( egc ) were still lacking .
this meta - analysis was intended to evaluate the feasibility and safety of esd in elderly patients with egc .
methods a systematic search was conducted in pubmed , ebsco , cochrane library , embase , and web of science .
studies were screened out if data of elderly and non - elderly gastric cancer patients were reported separately .
the qualities of included studies were assessed using newcastle - ottawa quality assessment scale .
the pooled odd ratios ( ors ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated .
statistical analysis was conducted using the review manager 5.2 ( cochrane collaboration , oxford , uk ) .
results nine studies ( eight in japan , one in china ) , including a total of 30,100 lesions , met the inclusion criteria .
the " en bloc " and histological complete resection rates of the elderly and non - elderly groups were similar [ or , 0.98 , 95 % ci , 0.56 to 1.71 ; p = 0.93 and or , 0.79 , 95 % ci , 0.58 to 1.07 ; p = 0.13 , respectively ] .
as for procedure - related complications , similar perforation rates [ or , 1.19 , 95 % ci , 0.94 to 1.51 ; p = 0.15 ] , and bleeding rates [ or , 1.13 , 95 % ci , 0.83 to 1.56 ) ; p = 0.43 ] between the elderly and non - elderly groups were observed .
whereas , the elderly patients had a higher procedure - related pneumonia rate compared with non - elderly ones [ or , 2.18 , 95 % ci , 1.55 to 3.08 ; p < 0.01 ] .
conclusions the esd procedure appears to be a safe technique in elderly patients with egc while appropriate approach should be taken to avoid procedure - related pneumonia .
keywords endoscopic submucosal dissection early gastric cancer elderly patients meta - analysis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background gastric cancer remains one of the major life - threatening problems worldwide , especially in some eastern asian countries [ 1 , 2 ] .
various therapeutic options are available currently , including endoscopic treatment , laparoscopic gastrectomy and conventional open surgery .
early gastric cancer ( egc ) , defined as lesions confining to the gastric mucosa or submucosa [ 3 ] , usually has a low risk of lymphatic metastasis , thus allowing radical resection of lesions without lymphadenectomy .
endoscopic mucosal resection ( emr ) was firstly introduced for intramucosal gastric cancer .
however , if the lesions are larger than 20 mm or have invaded into the submucosa , emr may lead to piecemeal resection and subsequent recurrence , which has been replaced by endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) .
esd has been proven to be an effective therapeutic method for egc .
a high " en bloc " resection rate would be achieved if the indications are properly followed [ 4 - 6 ] .
despite the fact that surgical operation is the mainstay in the management of gastric cancer , elderly patients with comorbidities and poor functional capacities might not be able to endure such aggressive surgical trauma .
previous studies reported that the incidence of postoperative complications was quite frequent among elderly patients with egc [ 7 ] .
furthermore , the integrity of the stomach plays a critical role in maintaining a normal condition of elderly patients .
patients after gastrectomy are at risk of vitamin b12 deficiency and anemia [ 8 , 9 ] .
in the past decade , cases of elderly egc patients undergoing esd were strikingly increased .
however , studies reporting the treatment of egc by esd in elderly patients have been published previously , reliable evidence seems still lacking due to small sample sizes .
thus , we performed this systematic review and meta - analysis to evaluate the feasibility and safety of esd in elderly patients with egc by comparing with non - elderly patients .
methods search strategy and study selection a systematic search was conducted in pubmed , ebsco , cochrane library , embase , and web of science to identify articles published until may 2015 .
the following search algorithms "(((( elderly [ title / abstract ]) or old [ title / abstract ]) or geriatric [ title / abstract ])) and (((( early gastric cancer ) or early gastric neoplasm )) and ((( endoscopic submucosal dissection ) or esd ) or endoscopic resection ))" were used .
besides , the reference lists are manually viewed to obtain additional relevant articles .
search was restricted to english and chinese literature .
the inclusion criteria were as follows : peer - reviewed studies reporting comparison of elderly and non - elderly patients underwent esd , full texts were available .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : studies of which the measured outcomes were not clearly presented or difficult to calculate , duplicate studies , case reports , review articles , editorials , and letters .
data extraction and quality assessment the articles identified by our search strategy were screened by two independent reviewers ( jpl and ypz ) .
disagreements were resolved through discussion with other two researchers ( sjc and jms ) .
extracted data including author , study period , geographical region , number of lesions , " en bloc " resection rates ( no piecemeal removal of the lesion ) and histologically complete resection rates ( no neoplastic cells in lesion edges ) , perforation , procedure - related bleeding , and procedure - related pneumonia .
perforation was diagnosed intraoperatively or by the presence of free air on plain radiograph or ct images after esd .
procedure - related bleeding was defined as clinical evidence of bleeding after esd .
procedure - related pneumonia was defined as new or progressive lung consolidation with clinical symptoms after esd .
the newcastle - ottawa quality assessment scale ( nos ) was used as a quality assessment tool .
scale varies from zero to nine stars : studies with a score equal to or higher than six were considered methodologically sound .
statistical analysis dichotomous variables were analyzed using the odd ratio ( or ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) .
statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using methods described by higgins et al .
[ 10 ] .
i2 values between 0 and 25 % suggest low heterogeneity , values above 25 % suggest moderate heterogeneity , and values above 75 % suggest high heterogeneity .
pooled effect was calculated using mantel - haenszel test for fixed - effects models ( in case of low heterogeneity ) or dersimonian and laird test for random - effects models ( in case of moderate or high heterogeneity ) [ 11 , 12 ] .
the potential publication bias based on the procedure - related complications was assessed by conducting the funnel plots .
data analysis was performed using review manager 5.2 ( cochrane collaboration , oxford , uk ) .
p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results characteristics of included studies initially , 323 potentially relevant articles were identified to undergo abstract review .
nine full - text studies were screened out for the final analysis [ 13 - 21 ] .
the flow chart of the screening strategies was presented in fig. 1. fig. 1 the prisma flowchart of literature review this meta - analysis pooled 30,100 lesions , 6713 in elderly patients group and 23,387 in non - elderly patients group .
all of these studies were carried out retrospectively with eight in japan and one in china .
no less than six stars according to the nos were scored for each of them .
the definition of elderly patients was no less than 65 years old in one study [ 19 ] , no less than 80 years old in another study [ 20 ] and no less than 75 years old in the rest seven studies [ 13 - 18 , 21 ] .
general characteristics , measurements of comparability and the quality of studies were summarized in table 1 .

in total , " en bloc " resection was performed in 907 out of 973 lesions in the elderly patients group and 1089 out of 1173 lesions in the non - elderly patients group .
the " en bloc " resection rates were comparable between the two groups [ or = 0.98 ; 95 % ci 0.56 to 1.71 ; p = 0.93 ] ( fig. 2a ). fig. 2 operative outcomes of the pooled studies ( a " en bloc " resection rates , b histological complete resection rates ) five studies reported the histological complete resection rates [ 13 , 17 - 19 , 21 ] .
similar with the " en bloc " resection rates , no significant difference was observed between the two groups [ or = 0.79 ; 95 % ci 0.58 to 1.07 ; p = 0.13 ] ( fig. 2b ) .
data on the perforation rates were reported in nine studies [ 13 - 21 ] .
the perforation rate in the elderly patients group ( 105 / 6713 ) was comparable to that in the non - elderly patients group ( 250 / 23,387 ) , [ or = 1.19 ; 95 % ci 0.94 to 1.51 ; p = 0.15 ] , ( fig. 3a ) .
procedure - related bleeding rates were examined in nine studies [ 13 - 21 ] and no significant difference was found between the two groups ( elderly vs. non - elderly , 224 / 6713 vs. 687 / 23,387 ) , [ or = 1.13 ; 95 % ci 0.83 to 1.56 ; p = 0.43 ] , ( fig. 3b ) .
five studies reported the procedure - related pneumonia rates [ 14 , 17 - 20 ] .
the elderly patients group had a higher risk of procedure - related pneumonia ( elderly vs. non - elderly , 56 / 6495 vs. 89 / 23,839 ) , [ or = 2.18 ; 95 % ci 1.55 to 3.08 ; p < 0.01 ] ( fig. 3c ) .

no evident publication bias was observed .
sensitivity analysis was performed by exclusion of the highest weighted study or the two studies which did not define elderly patients as " no less than 75 years old " [ 19 , 20 ] in each pooled analysis .
the results were all consistent with the outcomes mentioned above. fig. 4 funnel plots based on the procedure - related complications ( a perforation , b procedure - related bleeding , and c procedure - related pneumonia ) discussion owing to the advance in medicine and health care , the global population of the elder has been increasing [ 22 ] .
an accompanying issue is that neoplastic diseases would be more common , including gastric cancer [ 23 , 24 ] .
endoscopic treatments have gradually gained their popularity and are currently established as the standard treatment for egc [ 25 , 26 ] .
esd is a promising approach of endoscopic treatment , which allows " en bloc " resection for large lesions and recurred less than emr [ 27 - 29 ] .
a meta - analysis pooling ten studies demonstrated the " en bloc " and histological complete resection rates were significantly higher in the esd compared with emr [ 30 ] .
however , esd is also associated with high frequencies of procedure - related complications , such as perforation , postoperative bleeding , and pneumonia .
[ 29 - 31 ] .
esd is expected to be a promising alternative for elderly patients with egc because of its minimal invasiveness and retainment of integrated stomach when compared with gastrectomy .
however , published studies on the application of esd were not adequately robust to support or refute its feasibility and safety in elderly patients with egc .
hence , a systematic review pooling the latest evidence was necessary to address this issue .
the long - lasting procedure was one of the drawbacks during esd .
the duration time differed a lot among these studies [ 13,14 , 18 , 19 , 21 ] .
this can be explained with the learning curve of endoscopists and the locations of tumor which might mostly reside in upper and / or middle portion of the stomach .
factors associated with the longer procedure include locations and sizes of tumor and the presence of ulcer and scar [ 26 , 32 ] .
the influence of age on duration time was assumed to be limited based on the same nature of the procedure , although poor conditions of the elderly patients might need more complex operation .
our present study also showed no significant difference between two groups .
the procedure - related complications are not only preferred parameters to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an operation but also significantly affect the length of hospitalization and medical expenses .
perforation is one of the most common drawbacks accompanying esd .
perforation after esd occurs at a rate of 1.2 to 8.2 % [ 26 , 33 , 34 ] , even in experienced hands .
our meta - analysis showed that perforation rate was about 2 ~ 4 % , irrespective of the patients' age .
intriguingly , less perforation was reported if the lesions were small and locates at the lower or middle portion of stomach [ 35 , 36 ] .
nowadays , thanks to the development of endoscopic clipping and prompt use of antibiotics , perforation is no longer an obstacle in most cases .
procedure - related bleeding was another common complication of esd procedure .
it seemed to be associated with factors including the histology , location , and invasion depth of tumor [ 13 , 37 , 38 ] .
for the elder , anticoagulant drugs have long been considered as an important relevant factor .
however , recent studies reported that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs was not significantly correlated with procedure - related bleeding [ 39 , 40 ] .
this meta - analysis revealed the bleeding rates between the elderly and non - elderly groups were similar [ or = 1.13 ; p = 0.43 ] .
according to this meta - analysis , we inferred pneumonia developed more frequently in the elderly patients .
higher risk of aspiration , poor immunity , and less capability to expectorate after esd contributes to procedure - related pneumonia in the elderly patients .
adequate suction of saliva during esd might be helpful to reduce the probability of aspiration [ 16 ] .
procedure - related pneumonia was also associated with longer operation time , smoking history , sedation methods , and presence of ulceration [ 41 - 43 ] .
thus , elderly patients combined with risks such as smoking , intractable lesions , are recommend to experienced endoscopists , which may avoid procedure - related pneumonia .
moreover , chest radiography images , wbc count , and c - reactive protein level are recommended in elderly patients who are at high risk of procedure - related pneumonia [ 41 , 44 ] .
though without strong evidence , prophylactic use of antibiotics is recommended in these patients .
two studies reported the follow - up data after the procedure of esd in elderly patients , and the long - term prognoses were acceptable .
although only few studies reported long - term oncologic outcomes , the " en bloc " resection rate and the histological complete resection rate are also used as indicators of the oncologic adequacy of esd [ 25 ] .
the overall 5 - year survival rates in the curative resection and non - curative resection were 85 and 63 % in elderly patients [ 45 ] .
both of the " en bloc " resection rate and the histological complete resection rate were high in elderly patients , which were in accordance with the previous reports [ 26 , 46 ] .
compared with eastern and western historical studies , these two parameters of elderly patients were not inferior [ 27 , 47 , 48 ] .
this meta - analysis also demonstrated that the " en bloc " resection rate and the histological complete resection rate in the elderly patients were comparable with the non - elderly patients .
several limitations exist in this meta - analysis .
firstly , eligible studies were all non - randomized controlled trials .
a symmetric distribution of lesion size and location , varied indications for esd , inconsistent definition of elderly patients , and procedure - related complications decreased the plausibility of the results .
secondly , in this meta - analysis , some pooled studies included patients with gastric adenoma [ 14 , 18 ] .
a larger sample size in a meta - analysis may help to obtain a possible treatment effect .
the sample size of the rest studies is too small to generalize definitive conclusions of some comparisons .
thus we did not delete these studies , which might be one source of heterogeneity .
thirdly , only studies published in english were pooled in this meta - analysis which may also result in bias .
in addition , all nine studies included in this meta - analysis were from east asia , which may limit its clinical application in western countries .
conclusions in conclusion , esd is an effective and safe procedure for elderly patients with egc , but attentive care should be carried out to avoid procedure - related pneumonia .
more well - designed large scale clinical studies are awaited and further evaluation of the utility of esd elderly patients with egc should be conducted to confirm our findings .

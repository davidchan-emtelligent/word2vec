the biology and phylogeny of idalus are discussed .
keywords lepidoptera erebidae arctiinae arctiini idalus paulae sp. n. idalus maesi faustinoi subsp. n. idalus maesi laguerre myrtaceae costa rica honduras guatemala introduction walker ( 1855 ) described the genus idalus based on the species phalaena admirabilis cramer from surinam .
hampson ( 1901 ) provided a further description of the genus , and described only one additional species , with rothschild subsequently describing nearly half the species currently placed in the genus ( watson and goodger 1986 ) .
travassos ( 1949 ) reviewed 19 species , comparing them to idalus admirabilis from amazonas and southeastern brazil as well as from cayenne , french guiana .
the genus presently includes 50 species from the neotropical region ( watson and goodger 1986 ) .
collecting in costa rica over the past 20 years has revealed 17 distinct species when compared to types in the british museum of natural history and the united states national museum ( b. espinoza , unpublished ) .
some of these " species " appear to contain several sibling species as revealed by co1 barcoding ( d. h. janzen , w. hallwachs , b. espinoza , unpublished ; janzen et al. 2009 ) .
this paper describes one of the distinct new species and compares it to populations with similar wing patterns found throughout central america which also required that we name a new subspecies as well .
the arctiinae of our usage is the same as arctiidae of earlier usage ( fibiger and lafontaine 2005 ) , with idalus in the tribe arctiini ( watson and goodger 1986 ) .
materials and methods genitalia were prepared following procedures detailed by lafontaine ( 2004 ) .
photographs of adults and genitalia were taken with a nikon coolpix 4500 , using a super micro lens .
samples of five specimens from costa rica and 24 from guatemala were taken for dna barcoding and sent to the canadian center for dna barcoding in guelph , ontario .
the resulting nucleotide sequences , a.k.a .
" dna barcodes " were compared with neighbor - joining trees using kimura 2 - parameter distances ( methods in ratnasingham and herbert 2007 ) .

distribution and biology .
idalus paulae has been collected between 1400 and 2230 m elevation in rain forest and the margins of cloud forest , on both pacific and atlantic slopes , from 1400 to 2230 m in the cordillera volcanica central and the cordillera de talamanca of costa rica .
there is a single specimen from the rain forest lowlands on the lowest slopes of the cordillera talamanca ( 100 m . )
( fig. 9 ) .
this is an unexpected locality but we are unable to find any differences between it and the remaining series of this species .
adults of idalus paulae have been collected throughout the year but only in short series as the species is uncommon at lights and in light traps .
no immature stages have been found but idalus admirabilis , a related species , is known to feed on plants of the family myrtaceae ( porto santos et al. 2006 ) .

distribution and biology .
in guatemala ( fig. 10 ) idalus maesi faustinoi is reported from cloud forest at 1444 to 1616 m elevation ( jose monzon personal comm. ) .
a single female specimen from honduras , tegucigalpa is recorded from cloud forest at 2133 m. adults have been captured throughout the year .
no immature stages have been found but idalus admirabilis , a related species , is known to feed on myrtaceae ( porto santos et al. 2006 ) .
figure 10 .
distribution map of idalus maesi faustinoi , subsp. n. in guatemala. comments .
the arctiinae ( formerly arctiidae ) are estimated to have 11,000 species worldwide , with 6,000 species in the neotropics ( watson and goodger 1986 ) .
some 20 years ago the costa rican fauna was estimated to be 350 species in 80 genera ( inbio collections ) .
at present there are an estimated 1,000 species in 215 genera in costa rica ( inbio collections ) , which is remarkable given the small size of the country .
comparative dna sequencing of the co1 locus indicates that even more species are present ( d. h. janzen , w. hallwachs , b. espinoza , j. b. sullivan , unpublished data ) .
according to travassos ( 1949 , 1950 ) idalus species have a well - developed proboscis ; short and upright labial palpi with the third segment tiny ; antenna serrate in both sexes ; elongate wings ; forewing venation with sc ending before the apex of wing , r1 arising from discal cell and ending before reaching the apex of wing , r2 and r3 ending before the apex of wing , r4 ending on the apex , r5 ending after apex , m1 arising from anterior angle of discal cell , m2 and m3 arising from posterior angle of discal cell , cu1 arising from near the posterior angle of discal cell , cu2 arising from the distal third of the cell , anal vein ending on tornus ; hindwing venation with sc arising from the distal half of cell and not reaching the costal margin of wing , r arising from anterior angle of cell , m and cu1 arising from posterior angle of cell , cu2 arising from the distal half of cell , a1 ending before reaching tornus and a2 ending on tornus .
the newly described taxa idalus paulae and idalus maesi faustinoi are consistent with these characters .
dna barcoding and neighbor - joining analyses ( ratnasingham and hebert 2007 ) of almost all the species of idalus in costa rica ( idalus aleteria ( schaus ) , idalus carinosa schaus , idalus crinis druce , critheis druce , idalus dares druce , fasciipuncta rothschild , idalus herois schaus , idalus perlineosa rothschild , idalus tuisiana schaus , idalus tybris ( cramer ) , idalus veneta dognin , idalus borealis ( rothschild ) , idalus vitrea ( cramer ) , idalus vitreoides ( rothschild ) , plus several unnamed species ) group them in two groups that appear to be related groups .
idalus paulae , idalus maesi maesi ( laguerre , 2006 ) and idalus maesi faustinoi form a related group to idalus admirabilis , idalus crinis and idalus herois .
the caterpillars of this latter group of three species is known to eat foliage of myrtaceae ( porto santos et al. 2006 ) , ( d. h. janzen and w. hallwachs , unpublished ) .
the admirabilis - maesi groups make up one of the primary branches of idalus .
the other primary branch divides into a vitrea group and a perlineosa group .
idalus borealis is in the vitrea group and caterpillars have been found feeding on combretaceae ( combretum ) ( d. h. janzen and w. hallwachs , unpublished ) .
idalus perlineosa and a likely undescribed sibling species both in the perlineosa group feed on proteaceae ( roupala ) ( d. h. janzen and w. hallwachs , unpublished ) .
interestingly , while maculation patterns vary widely in the genus , these patterns unlike the foodplant associations , do not cluster cleanly among the four groups .
the color patterns included by travassos in his admirabilis group sort into all four barcode groups .
idalus paulae differs from idalus maesi maesi and idalus maesi faustinoi in dna sequence of the co1 locus by approximately 5 % .
idalus maesi maesi and idalus maesi faustinoi differ by at least 1 % but idalus maesi faustinoi breaks into two groups differing by 0.65 % .
idalus maesi maesi clearly differs from idalus paulae and idalus maesi faustinoi in maculation ( the median yellow area is white ) but does not appear to differ in male and female genitalia ( m. laguerre , personal communication ) .
geographically , idalus maesi maesi occurs in the mountains of northern and southern pacific nicaragua , idalus paulae in the mountains of costa rica , and idalus maesi faustinoi in the mountains of honduras and guatemala .
the two distinct haplotype groupings of idalus maesi faustinoi may represent two taxa but because they seem to have identical maculation and genitalia and because they do not sort geographically , we have chosen not to name both groups .
instead , the holotype and paratypes are based on populations from the northern montane slopes in guatemala .
it will take additional studies to resolve the haplotype distributions and to establish the food plants upon which this group feeds .
we have not tried to establish morphological characters that separate the maesi group from the other three idalus groups .
however , we have noticed that in the maesi group , sexual modifications of scales and venation in the area of wing overlap are absent but present in those species we have examined from the other three groups .
the humeral area is lobed but that character applies to most arctiinae .
the small differences in the co1 sequences between idalus maesi maesi and idalus maesi faustinoi may reflect recent and rapid evolution of these species in the complex montane regions of central america .

in this work , photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis was proposed for noninvasively characterizing the mechanical properties of materials .
we theoretically predicted the relationship between the photoacoustic eigen - spectra of cylindrical optical absorbers and their mechanical properties .
experimental measurements of eigen - spectra extracted from photoacoustic coda waves agreed well with the theoretical predictions .
we then applied the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis for contactless monitoring of low - cycle fatigue damage .
experiments showed that the photoacoustic eigen - spectra were closely related to the degree of low - cycle fatigue .
this study might enhance the contrast of photoacoustic imaging ford mechanical characterization .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction photoacoustic imaging ( pai ) , based on the photoacoustic effect , is a hybrid technique that combines the advantages of high ultrasonic resolution in deep tissues and strong optical contrast1 - 24 .
when a material is irradiated by pulsed lasers , optical energy is converted to heat , and ultrasound waves are sequentially induced after thermoelastic expansion .
benefiting from multiple physical effects during the generation and propagation of photoacoustic signals , pai can extract various chemical and physical parameters of materials , such as chemical components1 - 3 , velocity4 , elasticity5 - 8 , microstructure9 - 11 and temperature12 , thereby providing various imaging contrasts .
these rich contrasts not only show great potential for the non - invasive characterization of materials13 - 15 but also have valuable biomedical applications , including breast imaging16 , vasculature visualization17,18 , osteoarthritis assessment19,20 , small - animal whole - body imaging21,22 , dental implantation23 , and drug delivery monitoring24 .
mechanical characteristics are fundamental attributes of materials .
they are crucial to monitoring structural strength , fatigue and fracture .
additionally , the mechanical properties of tissues are important biological indicators of many diseases , such as atherosclerosis25 , osteoporosis26 , and bone fracture27 .
consequently , these properties play an important role in the fields of materials science28 , engineering29 , biomedicine25 - 27 , etc .
many studies have involved the monitoring of the mechanical characteristics and fatigue of various materials30 - 45 .
some methods generate mechanical resonance in specimens by a bimorph piezoelectric plate - like actuator31 or a hammer32,33 .
displacement is then achieved by contact measuring using sensors attached to specimens32,33 .
sound waves radiated from an ultrasonic transducer can also stimulate resonance when the frequency of incident waves equals the resonance frequency of a specimen34 .
however , the strain of a specimen is transferred by a rod and detected by a displacement transducer .
these methods rely on contacting vibration excitation or contacting signal detection .
all optical resonant ultrasound spectroscopy ( rus ) 35 - 37 and laser ultrasonic methods38 - 41 provide contactless techniques for the measurement of mechanical properties .
these methods require direct detection of the surface vibration of samples via optical methods .
electromagnetic acoustic resonance ( emar ) provides a contactless technique for fatigue evaluation42 - 45 .
in this method , an electromagnetic acoustic transducer based on the magnetostrictive effect is employed to excite axial - shear acoustic resonance and receive resonant frequencies .
benefitting from the use of surface - wave resonance and an electromagnetic acoustic transducer , emar is a non - contact method and highly sensitive in evaluating fatigue damage .
the technique can monitor fatigue online without interrupting fatigue tests , and it has the potential to characterize inhomogeneous microstructures in the radial direction .
however , this method is usually suitable only for ferromagnetic metals .
therefore , a new technique for monitoring the mechanics and fatigue of materials is required .
photoacoustic methods have also demonstrated their capacity to evaluate the mechanical properties of materials .
according to the quantitative relationship between the viscoelasticity and the phase delay of the strain response to the stress of tissues , the viscoelasticity can be estimated from photoacoustic signals detected from tissues7,8 .
based on this method , photoacoustic viscoelasticity imaging in atherosclerosis7 and intraluminal tissues8 has been well studied .
recently , we observed a physical phenomenon , named the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum , in the photoacoustic coda waves of spherical optical absorbers6 .
it has been demonstrated that the eigen - vibration information and mechanical properties of a spherical object are imprinted in the generated photoacoustic coda waves .
these previous studies have demonstrated the proficiency of photoacoustic methods in mechanical characterization .
in this work , we studied the photoacoustic eigen - spectra of cylindrical optical absorbers and characterized the fatigue of materials by using photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis .
materials fatigue refers to the weakening of properties caused by cyclic loading29 .
this phenomenon has attracted much attention because at least 50 percent of mechanical failures result from fatigue46 .
in medicine , monitoring and assessing bone fatigue47 or intravascular stents48 are closely connected to evaluating human health .
first , we theoretically predicted the photoacoustic eigen - spectra from cylindrical optical absorbers in deep tissue - like media .
then , photoacoustic waves of different wires were detected in experiments , and eigen - spectra were extracted from the photoacoustic coda waves to verify the theoretical predictions .
finally , we applied photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis to monitor the low - cycle fatigue of wires .
results eigen - spectra prediction of cylindrical optical absorbers a schematic diagram of the photoacoustic generation from an infinite , isotropic and homogeneous elastic cylinder with radius a is shown in fig. 1. after laser pulse illumination , the cylinder absorbs the incoming optical energy , experiences thermoelastic expansion , and finally emits photoacoustic waves to the surrounding media .
the laser generates a wideband photoacoustic head wave .
after the laser pulse vanishes , the absorber continues to vibrate and emits a photoacoustic coda wave following the head wave , which contains narrow - band spectral lines determined by the eigen - modes of the absorber6 .
therefore , investigating the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum requires prediction of the eigen - frequencies .

figure 1 schematic diagram of photoacoustic wave generation .
the elements of d are listed in the methods section .
as indicated by d , the eigen - frequencies are determined by the mechanical properties of the cylinder .
therefore , quantification of the eigen - frequencies could be a method for mechanical characterization .
newton 's iteration method is used to calculate eigen - frequencies of three types of cylindrical optical absorbers made of brass , steel and tungsten .
the parameters required for computation are presented in table 1 .
in this work , eigen - modes are named according to the convention established in ref.35 .
because we assume the cylinder to be infinite , the calculated eigen - modes are cross - section modes35 .
the modes are rayleigh ( r ) modes or wave gallery ( wg ) modes , which are denoted r ( m,n ) modes and wg ( m,n ) modes , respectively .
the integer m represents the mode order , and n is the frequency number of the corresponding m. when the tangential displacement utheta equals 0 , the modes are called longitudinal ( l ) modes .
the first longitudinal mode is expressed as l ( 0,1 ) .
calculation results are not listed here but displayed later to compare with the experimental results .
table 1 materials parameters of different wires .
parameters brass steel tungsten a ( mm ) 0.25 0.3 0.25 rhoc ( 103 kg / m3 ) 8.5 7.8 19.25 cd ( 103 m / s ) 4.37 5.85 5.18 cs ( 103 m / s ) 2.10 3.24 2.87 photoacoustic measurement system we detected the photoacoustic signals of different wire samples with a photoacoustic measurement system .
the experimental setup is illustrated in fig. 2. samples were illuminated by a q - switched nd : yag laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a pulse width of approximately 8 ~ 10 ns. a laser spot with diameter of approximately 1 cm was illuminated on the surface of each wire .
an ultrasound transducer ( v310 , panametrics , 4.39 mhz center frequency , 100.1 % relative bandwidth at - 6 db ) was used to receive ultrasound signals .
the signals were amplified ( sa - 230f5 , nf ) and recorded ( pci - 5105 , ni ) at a sampling frequency of 60 mhz .
we separately immersed three different types of wires in water to perform the experiments ; the wires were made of brass , steel , and tungsten .
each wire had a length of approximately 10 cm , guaranteeing that the ratio of length ( under laser illumination ) to diameter was greater than 16 .
under these conditions , the wires could be approximated as cylinders of infinite length .
therefore , cross - section eigen - modes were mainly generated in this study .
the radii and mechanical parameters of the samples , including density , longitudinal wave speed and shear wave speed , are listed in table 1 .
the experimental measurements were repeated at 10 different positions on each wire , and each signal was calculated as the average of 50 experiments to reduce the noise in each measurement .
during the experiments , the ultrasound transducer used for signal detection was approximately two centimeters from the specimen .
this distance could reduce the signal amplitude due to acoustic absorption but did not shift the frequency values .
figure 2 schematic of the photoacoustic measurement system .
photoacoustic eigen - spectrum extraction figure 3 shows the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum extracted from the measured signals .
one typical temporal waveform of the brass wire is drawn in fig. 3 ( a ) .
the waveform has a signal - to - noise ratio of approximately 30 db. the beginning stage of the wave has a higher amplitude than the rest of the wave , which was directly excited by the pulsed laser .
this broadband wave , referred to as the head wave , is related to the dimensions and the optical absorption coefficient of the cylinder .
such waves have demonstrated great capacity for microstructure characterization of deep tissues at low frequency10,11 .
beyond the head wave lies a long - duration wave with attenuated amplitude .
this feature indicates that , when the laser pulse vanishes , the cylinder continues vibrating and emitting sound waves .
the coda wave should have the same frequencies as the vibration of the cylinder , which are expected to be the eigen - frequencies .
the time - frequency map of the corresponding wave is calculated and presented in fig. 3 ( b ) .
it is clear that there are several distinct spectral lines in the coda wave , which are demonstrated to well coincide with the theoretically calculated eigen - frequencies .
figure 4 ( a - c ) present the normalized power spectrum density ( psd ) of the head waves and coda waves of all three samples .
the results confirm that the head waves are wideband photoacoustic waves , whereas the coda waves with narrow spectral lines correspond to periodic waves of eigen - vibrations .
figure 4 ( d - f ) compare the eigen - frequencies between the experimental values and theoretical predictions for all three wires .
each scatter point denotes one eigen - mode .
the error bars show the standard variations of the measured eigen - frequencies .
the good agreement between the two sets of results confirms the validity of the theoretical analysis .

preparation of low - cycle fatigue damaged samples we applied photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis to monitor the low - cycle fatigue of a wire made of aisi 1070 high - carbon steel .
a bending fatigue scheme was adopted to induce fatigue in the wire50 , as shown in fig. 5 ( a ) .
one end of the wire was held by grips attached to a bending arm .
two rollers ( 1 cm in diameter ) restrained the middle part of the wire with the contact boundaries free .
the lower end was bundled with a suspended weight ( 1 kg ) to keep the lower part vertical and to apply steady tension within the wire .
in one bending cycle , the wire was bent 90degrees and - 90degrees and returned to the initial position .
we bent one steel wire with a diameter of 0.6 mm over 3 , 6 , 9 , and 20 cycles until the wire approached fracture .
as the wire broke after 30 cycles of bending , the maximum number of cycles nm was 30 .
in our fatigue test , the specimen was plastically deformed in each loading cycle and underwent a small number of cycles to failure .
this type of fatigue is referred to as low - cycle fatigue .
the wire was measured five times by repeating the previously described photoacoustic measurement procedures after performing different numbers of bending cycles .
the length of the bent part was approximately 7.85 mm , nearly 13 times the diameter of the wire ; thus , the bent part could still be considered a long , homogeneous cylinder .
during the measurement of photoacoustic signals , the ultrasound transducer was directed toward the bent part .
therefore , the acoustic waves emanated only from the bent part .
figure 5 eigen - frequency shifts of low - cycle fatigue damaged steel wires .
( a ) diagram of the bending fatigue machine for the wire .
( b ) the normalized psds of coda waves of damage - free and low - cycle fatigued steel wires .
the frequency band is limited to the range between 4.70 and 4.90 mhz , where the mode wg ( 1,1 ) lies .
( c ) the eigen - frequency shift values of wg ( 1,1 ) versus different bending fractions , where nm = 30 .
low - cycle fatigue characterization by photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis the normalized psds of the photoacoustic coda waves of the raw and bent wires are drawn in fig. 5 ( b ) .
in particular , the frequency range from 4.70 to 4.90 mhz is shown , over which the mode wg ( 1,1 ) lies .
the wg ( 1,1 ) mode was chosen for two reasons .
first , wg ( 1,1 ) showed the highest amplitude among all modes .
the other modes were weak or were even missed by the fatigue test .
second , wg ( 1,1 ) remained table for the longest period , as shown in fig. 3 ( b ) .
such a long - lived mode allows for the calculation of its eigen - frequency within the widest window .
a wide time window means high frequency precision .
therefore , the analysis of mode wg ( 1,1 ) can help improve the accuracy of eigen - frequency extraction and the sensitivity of fatigue characterization .
we introduced the ratio of the actual number of cycles to the maximum number of cycles n / nm to quantify the degree of low - cycle fatigue .
in fig. 5 ( b ) , the values 0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.67 in the legend refer to this ratio .
the curve at a value of 0 denotes the unbent wire , while the other curves correspond to the wires submitted to different degrees of fatigue .
it is shown that all the peaks of wg ( 1,1 ) move to lower frequencies .
figure 5 ( c ) quantifies the frequency shift versus the bending ratio .
the ordinate value is calculated as the frequency minus the mean value of the eigen - frequencies of the wire with no bending .
clearly , as the number of bending increases , fatigue accumulates and the frequency shift increases .
the mean eigen - frequency shifts for the bent wires are approximately - 29 khz , - 43 khz , - 48 khz and - 54 khz .
the error bars denote the standard deviations .
the eigen - frequency dropped significantly at the beginning and tended to become invariant in later stages .
the decrease of the photoacoustic eigen - frequency could be related to the mechanical changes due to low - cycle fatigue .
the high degree of bending could cause dislocation rearrangement and microcracks in the wires .
we have observed the microcracks on the surface of wires in different progresses of fatigue by using an optical microscope , as shown in fig. 6. figure 6 ( a - c ) correspond to situations that the n / nm ratio equals 0 , 0.3 and 0.67 , respectively .
it is clear that there was not any crack on the wire before it was bent .
but the amount of cracks increased and the lengths of cracks got longer after different bending degrees .
these observations show that microcracks develop with the accumulation of fatigue in our fatigue experiment .
in the low - cycle fatigue , plastic deformation happens and accompanies with the microstructural changes , especially the increase of microcracks and dislocation density51 .
the cracks and dislocation due to fatigue damage will decrease the elastic modulus34,52 and thus decrease the eigen - frequencies .
both the microcracks and dislocations could contribute to the frequency decrease .
the reduction in the wire diameter induced by the fatigue test could be another factor that affects the resonance frequency .
we measured the wire diameter as the fatigue accumulated during the test but did not find observable changes in diameter .
moreover , the theory predicts that the decrease in diameter will increase the resonance frequency .
thus , the decrease in the resonance frequency observed in our experiments was essentially caused by mechanical changes due to fatigue , but not diameter changes .
figure 6 microcracks on the surface of wires in different fatigue stages , which were observed by an optical microscope .
( a ) the wire was not bent .
( b ) the n / nm ratio was 0.3 .
( c ) the n / nm ratio was 0.67 .
based on the above observations and analyses , the basic mechanism can be summarized as follows : fatigue test causes the development of microcracks and dislocation in wires .
then the changes of microstructure reduce the elastic modulus , and thus decrease the eigen - frequencies .
inversely , the decrease of eigen - frequencies observed in photoacoustic signals could reflect the variation of the mechanical characteristics caused by low - cycle fatigue , thus enabling the monitoring of low - cycle fatigue .
therefore , based on the noncontact measurement of the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum and quantification of the eigen - frequency shifts , we could characterize the low - cycle fatigue damage of the samples .
discussion in summary , we propose a method for noncontact and noninvasive low - cycle fatigue characterization of cylinders via photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis .
we theoretically predicted the eigen - frequencies of cylindrical optical absorbers .
photoacoustic eigen - spectra extracted from experimental photoacoustic waves confirm the theoretical predictions .
we then performed photoacoustic measurements on steel wires with various degrees of low - cycle fatigue .
photoacoustic eigen - spectrum analysis examines the decreases in eigen - frequency induced by low - cycle fatigue. by using an optical microscope , we observed that the microcracks on the surface of wires develop with the accumulation of fatigue .
in the low - cycle fatigue , plastic deformation occurs and accompanies with the microstructural changes , especially the increase of microcracks and dislocation density .
the cracks and dislocation will decrease the elastic modulus , and thus reduce eigen - frequencies .
inversely , the decrease of eigen - frequencies observed in photoacoustic signals reflects the low - cycle fatigue , which has changed the microstructural and mechanical properties of metallic wires .
therefore , these results show that this method could detect low - cycle fatigue damage without contact and thus noninvasively .
in this study , only samples with simple regular shapes and homogeneous materials properties were examined because the photoacoustic eigen - spectra of such samples can be easily predicted for experimental verification .
inhomogeneous or irregularly shaped samples involve more complicated eigen - frequency calculations , but the proposed method should still be applicable .
many studies have monitored the mechanical characteristics and fatigue of various materials30 - 45 .
some methods30 - 34 rely on contacting vibration excitation or contacting signal detection .
all optical rus35 - 37 and laser ultrasonic methods38 - 41 are contactless techniques for the evaluation of mechanics and fatigue .
however , these methods require direct detection of the surface vibration of samples by optical methods .
this requirement limits the implementation of fatigue assessment of materials embedded in optically scattering media , such as intravascular stents in deep tissues .
emar shows a certain sensitivity and ability for the online monitoring of fatigue without interrupting fatigue tests42 - 45 .
however , this method is typically suitable only for ferromagnetic metals .
compared with these methods , the proposed photoacoustic technique offers certain advantages and various suitable applications .
first , our method can test fatigue over a relatively long depth within optically turbid materials , such as tissues .
pulsed lasers can penetrate biological tissues at a depth of several centimeters and excite photoacoustic waves .
this method could be applicable to monitoring mechanical changes , e.g. , fatigue , deep within turbid media .
additionally , the photoacoustic eigen - spectrum might enrich the imaging contrast of pai in terms of mechanical characterization .
second , our method can be easily applied to small specimens , such as the wires with a submillimeter diameter used in our study .
third , the photoacoustic method can be widely applied to specimens made of various materials and is not limited to ferromagnetic metals .
our method is based on the photoacoustic effect due to laser absorption .
this effect is broadly observed in various materials .
therefore , in addition to ferromagnetic specimens , other materials , such as bone9 and titanium implants23 , are suitable for detection using our method .
the final goal of this study was the use of the proposed method for biomedical applications .
certain problems should be considered before real - world application .
biological tissues are similar to water in density and speed of sound .
however , they are also different in other ways ; for example , tissue has a higher viscidity than water .
this higher viscidity means stronger acoustic absorption , which will accelerate the attenuation of photoacoustic signals , particularly the high - frequency components .
although absorption has no significant influence on the eigen - frequency , the attenuation of the signal will decrease the detection distance .
additionally , the method proposed in this study relies on resonance ; that is , the wire should be an ideal resonator .
otherwise , the resonance could be weak , and the eigen - frequencies could be difficult to detect , as in , for example , a superelastic niti alloy .
this is a limitation of the proposed method .
in addition to the use of a stronger pulsed laser to enhance photoacoustic - spectrum excitation , another possible solution is to use a sinusoidal continuous laser as the optical excitation source .
the resonant spectrum could be measured by sweeping the modulation frequency of the laser .
this avenue is worthy of future research .

the wave numbers kf , ks and kd are expressed as 2pif / cf , 2pif / cs and 2pif / cd. it is clear that the eigen - frequency depends on the mechanical properties of the cylindrical optical absorber. by defining a function phi ( f ) = det ( d ) , the eigen - frequencies are the roots of the equation phi ( f ) = 0 .
using newton 's iteration formula fi + 1 = fi - phi ( fi )/ phi '( fi ) and choosing the appropriate initial values , we can obtain the complex eigen - frequencies .

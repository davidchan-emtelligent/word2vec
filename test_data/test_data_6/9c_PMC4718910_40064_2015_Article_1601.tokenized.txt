phase ii , open - label study assessing the efficacy and safety of the erbb family blocker afatinib combined with letrozole in estrogen receptor - positive metastatic breast cancer ( mbc ) patients who had progressed on letrozole monotherapy .
adult females ( n = 28 ) received oral afatinib ( 50 [ n = 7 ] , 40 [ n = 13 ] or 30 [ n = 8 ] mg / day ) plus letrozole 2.5 mg / day in 28 - day cycles until disease progression .
primary endpoint was the progression - free rate at or after 16 weeks of afatinib .
at 16 weeks , four patients remained on afatinib without progression ; two of these were her2 negative .
fifteen ( 54 %) patients had a best response of stable disease according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors .
median progression - free survival was 60 , 107 and 79 days with 50 , 40 and 30 mg / day afatinib , respectively .
diarrhea , asthenia , rash , mucosal inflammation and nausea were the most frequent adverse events .
in this small , exploratory study , afatinib combined with letrozole was able to induce disease stabilization in 54 % of hormone - refractory mbc patients previously progressing on letrozole .
clinical trial registration : nct00708214 keywords phase ii afatinib erbb family blocker letrozole metastatic breast cancer pharmacokinetics issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background abnormally activated erbb family receptors ( egfr [ erbb1 ] , her2 [ erbb2 ] , erbb3 and erbb4 ) and estrogen receptors ( er ) are frequently implicated in breast cancer , making these potential therapeutic targets ( hurvitz and pietras 2008 ; ciardiello and tortora 2008 ) .
specifically , anti - estrogens , aromatase inhibitors ( ais ) and selective er modulators have proven effective in the treatment of hormone receptor - positive breast cancer ; however , a major clinical problem limiting the usefulness of endocrine therapy is tumor resistance ( schiff et al. 2004 ; chu and lu 2008 ) .
exploration into the complexity of receptor signaling has identified that receptor crosstalk constitutes a fundamental mechanism of tumor resistance , and preclinical observations have confirmed that activation of er and erbb family receptors , namely egfr / her2 , on the tumor cell surface stimulates multiple intracellular signaling cascades , leading to cellular proliferation , survival and differentiation ( ullrich and schlessinger 1990 ; klapper et al. 2000 ) .
bidirectional crosstalk can lead to cross - activation of these downstream signaling pathways , resulting in the development of tumor resistance to endocrine therapy ( nicholson et al. 2001 ; arpino et al. 2008 ; hurtado et al. 2008 ) .
to overcome such resistance , the combination of an ai with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tki ) targeting either egfr or her2 has been explored and has been shown to enhance response and progression - free survival ( pfs ) compared with treatment with an ai alone ( johnston et al. 2009 ; cristofanilli et al. 2010 ) .
such findings confirm that combining endocrine treatment with an erbb family - targeted therapy could be an effective strategy in the management of patients with primary or acquired hormone - resistant breast cancer ( osborne et al. 2005 ) .
furthermore , restoration of hormone sensitivity via erbb family inhibition could pose a therapeutic advantage , providing sustained disease control without the need for chemotherapy .
afatinib ( bibw 2992 ) is an orally available , irreversible erbb family blocker , with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.5 nm , 14 and 1 nm for egfr , her2 and erbb4 , respectively ( li et al. 2008 ) .
this compound also inhibits erbb3 transphosphorylation ( li et al. 2008 ) .
phase i monotherapy studies in patients with advanced solid tumors recommended a continuous dose of afatinib 50 mg once daily for the phase ii setting ( yap et al. 2010 ; agus et al. 2006 ) .
afatinib monotherapy ( 50 mg / day ) has previously demonstrated clinical activity in heavily pre - treated patients with her2 - positive metastatic breast cancer ( mbc ) who had progressed following trastuzumab treatment , with a median pfs of 15 weeks and an overall survival ( os ) of 61 weeks ( lin et al .
2012 ) , as well as a small proportion of patients with triple - negative mbc who had progressed following no more than two prior lines of chemotherapy ( schuler et al. 2010 ) .
to further investigate the potential activity of afatinib in mbc , we undertook a phase ii exploratory study to assess the efficacy , safety and pharmacokinetics of afatinib in combination with letrozole in patients with er - positive mbc who had progressed on letrozole monotherapy .
patients and methods study design this was a phase ii , open - label , single - arm , multicenter trial of afatinib added to letrozole in patients with er - positive mbc who had progressed on letrozole monotherapy .
patients continued to receive letrozole monotherapy during the 2 - week screening period .
the primary efficacy endpoint was progression - free rate at or after 16 weeks of afatinib treatment .
progression was defined as the occurrence of any of the following : new bone lesion ( s ) identified on a bone scan or with magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , progression or occurrence of new lesion ( s ) according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) version 1.0 ( therasse et al .
2000 ) , an increase in the tumor marker ca 15.3 of more than 20 % compared with the baseline value ( at two consecutive examinations ) , or disease - related skeletal events ( pathological or vertebral compression fracture not related to trauma ; palliative radiotherapy for bone pain ; prophylactic radiation or surgery for an impending fracture ; spinal cord compression ) .
secondary endpoints included objective response ( complete response [ cr ] or partial response [ pr ]) based on recist , clinical benefit ( cr or pr or stable disease [ sd ]) according to recist at 16 and 24 weeks , pfs , os , time to and duration of objective response , pharmacokinetics and safety .
the study was conducted between 30 may 2007 and 4 january 2010 at five sites in france , and was in accordance with the declaration of helsinki , the international conference on harmonization good clinical practice guideline and approved by the french national regulatory agency and local ethics committees .
all patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation .
study population eligible females (>= 18 years ) had histologically confirmed stage iiib or iv er - positive mbc .
patients had previously received letrozole and had developed acquired resistance , defined as disease progression on letrozole following previous response ( pr or better , or sd for >= 24 weeks ) .
initially , only patients who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were allowed to participate .
following an amendment , up to two lines of prior chemotherapy for mbc were permitted .
patients with her2 - positive breast cancer could have received prior trastuzumab in the adjuvant and metastatic setting .
her2 positivity was not a requirement for study entry .
further eligibility criteria included : an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 0 or 1 ; life expectancy of >= 6 months ; recovery from any grade 3 ( according to national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events [ nci ctcae ] version 3.0 ) adverse events ( aes ) from previous treatment ; documented menopause ( estradiol level of < 11 pg / ml ) ; diagnosis of disease progression <= 6 weeks prior to trial entry ; and adequate bone marrow ( absolute neutrophil count >= 1500 / mm3 , platelet count >= 100,000 / mm3 ) , hepatic ( aspartate aminotransferase and / or alanine aminotransferase <= 3x the upper limit of normal ) and renal ( serum creatinine <= 1.5 mg / dl [<= 132 mumol / l , si unit or equivalent ]) function .
patients were excluded from the study if they had : chronic diarrhea or gastrointestinal ( gi ) disorders that could interfere with absorption of study treatment ; brain metastases ; significant cardiovascular disease ( i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , history of infarction , congestive heart failure of new york heart association grade > 2 ) within the past 12 months ; received chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , other egfr - and / or her2 - inhibiting drugs , or had participated in another clinical study within 4 weeks before the start of therapy .
treatment with bisphosphonates was allowed if the patient had been receiving a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry .
treatment patients received oral afatinib once daily at a starting dose of 50 mg ( which was reduced to 40 mg and then to 30 mg following protocol amendments ) over repeated 28 - day treatment cycles , with 2.5 mg of oral letrozole daily until disease progression , withdrawal of consent or discontinuation due to aes .
the study medications were administered concurrently 1 h prior to food intake .
the protocol amendments were made as some patients receiving afatinib 50 or 40 mg experienced grade 3 cutaneous aes and diarrhea .
as a result , the starting dose of afatinib was reduced to 40 mg once - daily and then 30 mg once - daily for all newly enrolled patients .
at each starting dose , dose reduction of afatinib in 10 mg decrements ( to a minimum of 20 mg ) was a pre - specified option for patients experiencing certain drug - related aes .
a safety analysis was performed when the initial 15 patients had completed 1 month of treatment at either 50 or 40 mg afatinib .
this analysis was supportive of the reduction of the afatinib starting dose from 40 to 30 mg per day .
concomitant treatments were permitted as clinically necessary .
efficacy assessments efficacy was assessed in terms of the progression - free rate at or after 16 weeks of treatment .
if a patient withdrew from the study due to clinical deterioration , according to the investigator 's judgment , this was considered as progressive disease ( pd ) .
target lesions were evaluated by clinical detection , computed tomography or mri at screening and at the end of every other 28 - day treatment cycle .
safety assessments safety was assessed by monitoring the incidence and intensity of aes that patients experienced .
aes were graded according to the nci ctcae version 3.0 .
pharmacokinetic sampling and data analysis for quantification of drug plasma concentrations , 5 ml of venous blood was collected .
blood samples were drawn before and 2 h after letrozole administration on day - 14 and - 7 during the first 2 weeks of letrozole monotherapy treatment .
for quantification of letrozole and afatinib plasma concentrations , blood samples were drawn on day 1 ( cycles 1 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) before and 2 h after administration of afatinib and letrozole , and additionally at 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 24 h after drug administration on day 1 of cycle 4 .
afatinib plasma concentrations were determined by a validated high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( hplc - ms / ms ) assay at the department of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics , boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh and co. kg , biberach , germany .
letrozole plasma concentrations were determined by a validated hplc - ms / ms assay at nuvisan pharma services gmbh & co. kg , neu - ulm , germany .
statistical analyses the analyses in this trial were descriptive and exploratory .
a sample size of 30 - 40 patients was required to provide 80 % power to detect statistically significant evidence of afatinib activity , based on the assumption of an underlying true rate of non - progression of 25 % at 16 weeks .
sample size was based on a one - sided alpha of 10 % .
analysis was completed on the treated set , comprising all patients who received at least one dose of afatinib .
results patient population of a total of 30 patients screened , 28 entered the trial and received at least one dose of afatinib ( fig. 1 ). of the two patients who did not enter the trial , one patient did not have disease progression and for the other , it was not possible to perform blood samples .
baseline patient characteristics are shown in table 1 .
most patients ( 18 ; 64 %) had experienced sd >= 24 weeks as their best response to prior letrozole therapy , with six patients ( 21 %) experiencing a pr , three patients ( 11 %) experiencing a cr and one patient ( 4 %) having sd ( 16 weeks ). fig. 1 trial patient disposition table 1 demographics and characteristics of treated patients n (%) a total number 28 ( 100 ) sex female 28 ( 100 ) age ( years ) mean 62.5 median 64 range 40 - 82 baseline ecog performance status 0 16 ( 57 ) 1 8 ( 29 ) 2b 4 ( 14 ) progesterone receptor positive 20 ( 71 ) estrogen receptor positive 27 ( 96 ) her2 status her2 positive 3 ( 11 ) her2 negative 20 ( 71 ) her2 unknown or missing 5 ( 18 ) prior therapies chemotherapy 24 ( 86 ) prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy yes 19 ( 68 ) no 9 ( 32 ) number of prior metastatic chemotherapies 0 18 ( 64 ) 1 9 ( 32 ) >= 2 1 ( 4 ) hormone therapy prior to letrozole 28 ( 100 ) prior adjuvant radiotherapy yes 16 ( 57 ) no 12 ( 43 ) number of prior metastatic radiotherapies 0 16 ( 57 ) 1 7 ( 25 ) >= 2 7 ( 18 ) ecog eastern cooperative oncology group , her2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 aunless otherwise specified bat screening , the ecog ps for these patients was 0 - 1 ; however , their scores worsened to 2 prior to the start of treatment clinical activity progression - free rate at 16 weeks ( primary endpoint ) a total of 28 patients were evaluable for tumor response .
twenty patients ( 71 %) discontinued treatment prior to the 16 - week endpoint and eight patients completed 16 weeks of treatment ( fig. 1 ). of these , four ( 14 %) were progression free according to the criteria defined for the primary endpoint ( table 2 ) .
two of these patients were her2 negative and the her2 status was unknown for the other two .

one patient , who received 40 mg afatinib , was considered progression - free according to recist criteria , but had elevated ca 15.3 levels .
the final patient had suspected recist progression prior to 16 weeks which was not formally documented due to difficulty of determining on computed tomography .
for those who discontinued the trial due to pd ( n = 15 ; fig. 2 ) , 13 had recist progression , one patient had elevated ca 15.3 levels and bone lesion progression and one patient had other criteria indicating pd. fig. 2 duration of therapy by starting dose of afatinib for patients who discontinued treatment ( each bar represents one patient ) objective response and clinical benefit rate ( recist ) no patients experienced an objective ( complete or partial ) tumor response to afatinib plus letrozole treatment .
throughout the study , a best response of sd , as determined by recist , was experienced by 15 patients ( 54 %) .
the incidence of sd was comparable across the afatinib starting dose cohorts .
overall , six patients ( 21 %) experienced clinical benefit at 16 weeks ; this included the four patients who met the primary endpoint , the patient who was progression - free based on recist ( but had elevated ca 15.3 levels ) and one patient who had sd at week 16 but had discontinued treatment. of these six patients , the best response on prior letrozole therapy was sd for five and pr for one patient .
four ( 14 %) of these six patients continued to have clinical benefit at 24 weeks .
best response to previous letrozole treatment was pr in one patient and sd in three patients .
progression - free survival and overall survival according to recist criteria , median pfs ( 25th percentile , 75th percentile ) was 60 ( 51 , 274 ) , 107 ( 65 , 116 ) and 79 ( 51 , 230 ) days for patients initially receiving 50 , 40 and 30 mg afatinib , respectively .
the longest duration of treatment with afatinib and letrozole was 449 days .
duration of therapy , along with reasons for discontinuation , is shown by starting dose of afatinib for all patients ( fig. 2 ) .
median os could not be estimated due to the small number of patients who died during the trial ( three patients died during the trial ; none of the deaths were considered treatment - related ) .
safety all 28 patients experienced aes considered to be treatment related by the investigator ( table 3 ) .
the most frequently reported treatment - related aes were diarrhea ( 26 patients ; 93 %) , asthenia and rash ( both 16 patients ; 57 %) , mucosal inflammation ( 11 patients ; 39 %) and nausea ( 10 patients ; 36 %) .
the most frequently occurring grade >= 3 treatment - related aes were diarrhea ( six patients ; 22 %) , asthenia and rash ( five patients each ; 18 %) ( table 3 ) .
no treatment - related grade 5 aes occurred , and only one patient who received afatinib 40 mg and letrozole 2.5 mg experienced a grade 4 ae ( diarrhea ) .
fourteen patients ( 50 %) discontinued trial treatment due to treatment - emergent aes .
the most frequent aes necessitating treatment discontinuation were diarrhea ( eight patients ; 29 %) , asthenia ( four patients ; 14 %) , rash and mucosal inflammation ( three patients each ; 11 %) ; some patients had more than one ae leading to treatment discontinuation .

the frequency of aes observed varied across different doses of afatinib .
a higher than expected rate of grade 3 gi and skin - related aes ( rash , acne , dermatitis acneiform and palmar - plantar erythrodysesthesia ) was observed at the 50 mg starting dose .
however , patients fully recovered with treatment interruption or discontinuation .
further analyses suggested dose - related trends for both rash and diarrhea .
among the 16 patients ( 57 %) who experienced treatment - related rash , those receiving higher doses of afatinib were more likely to experience grade 3 rash and have a faster onset of symptoms ( 7 days from the start of therapy for patients receiving 50 mg or 40 mg compared with 8 - 14 days for patients receiving 30 mg ) .
there was a small decrease in the incidence of drug - related diarrhea with decreasing dose .
the first onset of treatment - related diarrhea usually occurred within 7 days after the start of therapy .
pharmacokinetics afatinib table 4 shows the geometric mean pharmacokinetic parameters of afatinib after multiple administrations of afatinib 30 mg or 40 mg in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg. inter - subject variability for maximum plasma concentration at steady state ( cmax,ss ) and area under the plasma concentration - time curve at steady state over the dosing interval ( auctau,ss ) was moderate for the afatinib 40 mg dose group and high for the 30 mg dose group .
in general , the pharmacokinetic data available were sparse , and for the 50 mg afatinib dose group there were insufficient data to perform any descriptive statistics .

in line with this , letrozole plasma concentrations appeared to be independent of the afatinib dose level .
letrozole pharmacokinetic parameters on day 1 of cycle 4 were summarized over all afatinib dose groups ( geometric mean cmax,ss was 135 ng / ml and geometric mean auctau,ss was 2420 ng * h / ml ) .
the inter - subject variability for the overall pharmacokinetic parameters was high. fig. 3 individual plasma concentration - time profiles of letrozole after multiple oral administrations of 30 , 40 or 50 mg afatinib discussion this phase ii study evaluated daily afatinib ( 30 , 40 or 50 mg / day ) in combination with letrozole in er - positive , hormone - refractory mbc .
the attempt to overcome hormone resistance , i.e. resistance to letrozole by the addition of the erbb family inhibitor afatinib , achieved disease stabilization in four patients ( 14 %) who remained on treatment without progression after 16 weeks .
two of these patients were her2 - negative .
the use of the additional criteria for the diagnosis of progression for the primary endpoint was felt important at the time of this study as bone lesions were deemed non - measurable by recist version 1.0 .
patients with er - positive breast cancer frequently have bone metastases .
upon pd during trial treatment , chemotherapy was available to patients as an additional option .
in order not to withhold chemotherapy from these patients , close monitoring of pd in bone lesions , which was not necessarily captured by recist 1.0 , was required .
overall , the ability of afatinib , when administered with letrozole , to induce sd in around 50 % of patients may indicate the potential for reversal of hormone resistance with this agent. of note , the duration of endocrine therapy prior to afatinib treatment in those who did and did not achieve clinical benefit was not available for all patients , so we are unable to speculate as to whether indolent disease contributed to any treatment effect in this study .
clinical evidence that crosstalk between the er and erbb family receptors constitutes a mechanism for resistance to endocrine therapy is continually growing .
the membrane - bound er can directly interact with and / or activate a variety of receptors , including egfr and her2 .
her2 does not have a specific ligand but is able to dimerize with egfr or erbb3 as a result of its open conformation ( schiff et al. 2004 ) .
therapeutic strategies focused around combining endocrine therapy with erbb family inhibitors , to circumvent de novo or acquired resistance , are being explored .
phase ii trials investigating gefitinib or erlotinib , two reversible egfr tkis , in combination with an ai in er - positive breast cancer patients have demonstrated varying levels of clinical benefit , including prolonging pfs , using this combined approach ( table 5 ) ( cristofanilli et al. 2010 ; mayer et al. 2006 ; osborne et al. 2011 ; smith et al. 2007 ; mita et al. 2005 ) .
in our phase ii trial , among 28 patients evaluable for response , six ( 21 %) experienced clinical benefit at 16 weeks and median pfs was 60 , 107 and 79 days for patients receiving 50 , 40 and 30 mg afatinib , respectively , demonstrating that the combination of afatinib and letrozole may warrant further investigation for hormone - refractory mbc patients .

this observation is of interest because letrozole combined with lapatinib , a reversible egfr and her2 tki , in the first - line setting failed to improve pfs in patients with er - positive , her2 - negative tumors ( johnston et al. 2009 ; schwartzberg et al. 2010 ) .
importantly , er - positive her2 - negative mbc patients with low er expression demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pfs when treated with letrozole plus lapatinib ( finn et al. 2009 ) .
targeting her2 with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole has also been explored , and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) inhibitor everolimus in combination with endocrine therapy represents another promising therapeutic strategy for er - positive mbc ( table 5 ) ( huober et al. 2012 ; marcom et al. 2007 ; kaufman et al. 2009 ; bachelot et al. 2012 ; baselga et al. 2012 ) .
understanding tumor biology and the compensatory mechanisms that are responsible for endocrine resistance will drive the choice of combination agent to provide optimal , synergistic blockade of relevant signaling pathways .
across all doses of afatinib , the most frequently observed aes were diarrhea , skin - related aes , mucosal inflammation and asthenia .
overall , the side effect profile reported here was in accordance with the side effects observed across the phase i dose - finding afatinib monotherapy studies in patients with a variety of solid tumors , with gi and skin - related aes most frequently reported ( yap et al. 2010 ; eskens et al. 2008 ) .
these are known to be the most prominent aes associated with egfr blockade and are manageable ( mok et al. 2009 ; mitsudomi et al. 2010 ; frankel and palmieri 2010 ; rosell et al. 2012 ) .
data from phase i monotherapy studies indicated an afatinib dose of 50 mg once daily to be the recommended dose for afatinib development in subsequent phase ii studies ( yap et al. 2010 ; agus et al. 2006 ; eskens et al. 2008 ; lewis et al. 2006 ) .
therefore , patients who initially entered this phase ii trial received a starting dose of afatinib 50 mg daily , with the option for dose reduction following the occurrence of specific grade 3 aes .
a notable proportion of patients initially treated with afatinib 50 mg in combination with letrozole experienced skin - associated aes and diarrhea , requiring a dose reduction to 40 mg daily .
the occurrence of significant skin - associated aes and diarrhea within the 40 mg dose cohort also led to a subsequent dose reduction to 30 mg daily .
the combination of afatinib / letrozole at a dose of 30 / 2.5 mg resulted in fewer patients discontinuing treatment due to aes than patients who received 50 or 40 mg afatinib doses .
overall , the combination of afatinib and letrozole appeared to result in skin - related aes occurring at greater intensity , when compared with afatinib monotherapy .
it is worth noting that at the time of this study there was little known about the toxicity profile of tkis and their management .
co - administration of afatinib with letrozole resulted in afatinib pharmacokinetic parameters that were comparable to those observed during afatinib monotherapy ( yap et al. 2010 ; eskens et al. 2008 ) .
letrozole plasma concentrations were also comparable with or without afatinib administration and were within the ranges previously reported in the literature ( pfister et al .
2001 ; dowsett 1999 ) , indicating that there was no effect of afatinib on letrozole exposure .
therefore , this study is a preliminary indication that afatinib has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of letrozole and vice versa .
however , the pharmacokinetic analysis was limited by the small number of patient samples and , as such , firm conclusions could not be drawn .
despite the significant achievements of endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer , only 50 % of all er - positive tumors are initially responsive to anti - estrogens ( mouridsen et al. 2003 ; osborne 1998 ) .
furthermore , in the metastatic setting , tumors that are initially responsive always become resistant to endocrine treatment .
therefore , an agent that might suppress or delay the onset of endocrine resistance by disrupting multiple pathways at once and restoring hormone sensitivity may spare patients from treatment with aggressive chemotherapy .
the phase ii exploratory observations presented here show that the once - daily afatinib 30 mg / letrozole 2.5 mg combination was able to induce disease stabilization in 54 % of hormone - refractory mbc patients previously progressing on letrozole .
this combination may warrant further evaluation , particularly in patients with er - positive her2 - negative mbc .
an ongoing study ( nct02115048 ) is assessing the efficacy of afatinib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone in first - line advanced er - positive , her2 - negative postmenopausal breast cancer with low er expression .
conclusions in this small exploratory study , combination therapy with afatinib and letrozole led to disease stabilization in 54 % of patients with advanced hormone - refractory mbc who had progressed following letrozole treatment .
these findings warrant further evaluation to determine the potential for overcoming the resistance associated with hormone therapy via erbb family blockade with afatinib .

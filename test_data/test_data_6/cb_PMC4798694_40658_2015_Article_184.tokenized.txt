ten patients injected with 10 mci fdg underwent dual - time - point clinical brain pet / mr on a siemens mmr , with image reconstructions based on data acquired at 45 - 60 and 75 - 90 minutes .
dixon mumaps were obtained the time of fdg injection and at 75 minutes .
8 cc of gadavist was injected for post - contrast mr at 30 minutes .
subjects were removed from the table and re - positioned prior to the 75 minute scan .
the delayed mumap was registered to the original mumap using mimneuro .
the aligned image data was copied onto the original mumap dicom file using matlab .
early time - point pet data was reconstructed using both the early and delayed mumaps .
atlas - based segmentation was performed to compare regional suv values .
when comparing the delayed versus original mumap reconstructions , regional suv values varied on average by + 1.9 % for both suvmax and suvmean .
for large brain structures , suvmax and suvmean varied by - 0.5 % to + 5.6 % and - 0.2 to + 4.7 % , respectively .
for deep brain structures , suvmax using the delayed reconstruction varied by - 0.5 % to + 3.7 % and suvmean varied by - 0.3 % to + 3.6 % .
most differences in suv were higher when using the delayed mumap .
there is variability in regional suv values for brain pet data reconstructed using two different aligned dixon acquisitions performed on subjects undergoing repeat same - day pet / mr imaging , with suv values ~ 2 % higher using the delayed mumap .
this variability may impact results in dual - time - point brain pet / mr .

deciphering the mechanisms regulating the generation of new neurons and new oligodendrocytes , the myelinating cells of the central nervous system , is of paramount importance to address new strategies to replace endogenous damaged cells in the adult brain and foster repair in neurodegenerative diseases .
upon brain injury , the extracellular concentrations of nucleotides and cysteinyl - leukotrienes ( cyslts ) , two families of endogenous signaling molecules , are markedly increased at the site of damage , suggesting that they may act as " danger signals " to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair .
here we show that , in brain telencephalon , gpr17 , a recently deorphanized receptor for both uracil nucleotides and cyslts ( e.g. , udp - glucose and ltd4 ) , is normally present on neurons and on a subset of parenchymal quiescent oligodendrocyte precursor cells .
we also show that induction of brain injury using an established focal ischemia model in the rodent induces profound spatiotemporal - dependent changes of gpr17 .
in the lesioned area , we observed an early and transient up - regulation of gpr17 in neurons expressing the cellular stress marker heat shock protein 70 .
magnetic resonance imaging in living mice showed that the in vivo pharmacological or biotechnological knock down of gpr17 markedly prevents brain infarct evolution , suggesting gpr17 as a mediator of neuronal death at this early ischemic stage .
at later times after ischemia , gpr17 immuno - labeling appeared on microglia / macrophages infiltrating the lesioned area to indicate that gpr17 may also acts as a player in the remodeling of brain circuitries by microglia .
at this later stage , parenchymal gpr17 + oligodendrocyte progenitors started proliferating in the peri - injured area , suggesting initiation of remyelination .
to confirm a specific role for gpr17 in oligodendrocyte differentiation , the in vitro exposure of cortical pre - oligodendrocytes to the gpr17 endogenous ligands udp - glucose and ltd4 promoted the expression of myelin basic protein , confirming progression toward mature oligodendrocytes .
thus , gpr17 may act as a " sensor " that is activated upon brain injury on several embryonically distinct cell types , and may play a key role in both inducing neuronal death inside the ischemic core and in orchestrating the local remodeling / repair response .
specifically , we suggest gpr17 as a novel target for therapeutic manipulation to foster repair of demyelinating wounds , the types of lesions that also occur in patients with multiple sclerosis .
introduction extracellular adenine ( atp , adp ) , uracil ( utp , udp ) and sugar nucleotides ( e.g. , udp - glucose and udp - galactose ) are universal and phylogenetically ancient signaling molecules involved in many biological processes , from embryogenesis to adult homeostasis [ 1 ] .
their actions on target cells are mediated by specific membrane receptors : the seven ligand - gated purinergic p2x channels and the eight g protein - coupled p2y receptors ( the p2y1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14 receptors ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
owing to their involvement in the regulation of many physiological phenomena , dysfunctions of nucleotides and their receptors have been associated to various human diseases , including ischemic / inflammatory conditions [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
instead , cysteinyl - leukotrienes ( cyslts , such as ltc4 , ltd4 and lte4 ) are inflammatory 5 - lipoxygenase arachidonic acid mediators [ 3 ] with established roles in bronchial asthma [ 4 ] acting through the g protein - coupled cyslt1 and cyslt2 receptors [ 5 ] .
recent data highlight the existence of a functional crosstalk between the nucleotide and the cyslt systems in orchestrating inflammatory responses in various disease conditions , including ischemic stroke .
both types of mediators accumulate at the sites of inflammation , and inflammatory cells often co - express both p2y and cyslt receptors [ 6 ] .
in rat microglia , the brain immune cells involved in the response to cerebral hypoxia and trauma , the activation of p2y1 and cyslt receptors mediate co - release of nucleotides and cyslts [ 7 ] , which might , in turn , contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration .
in the middle cerebral artery occlusion ( mcao ) model in the rat , levels of cyslts in the lesioned cortex were sharply increased 4 h after mcao and rapidly declined afterwards [ 8 ] .
in the same experimental model , extracellular concentrations of atp were instead constantly elevated starting from 20 min after mcao throughout a 220 min of microdialysis sampling , with a time course similar to that of excitatory amino acids [ 9 ] .
thus , at the site of brain injury , neurons and glia are exposed to high concentrations of both extracellular nucleotides and cyslts , suggesting that these signaling molecules may act as " danger signals " to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair .
we have recently reported that gpr17 , a previously orphan g protein - coupled receptor [ 10 ] ( gpcr ) at an intermediate phylogenetic position between p2y and cyslt receptor families , is a new p2y receptor specifically activated by both uracil nucleotides ( udp , udp - glucose and udp - galactose ) and cyslts ( ltd4 and ltc4 ) [ 11 ] .
consistent with this hybrid pharmacology , activation of gpr17 by uracil nucleotides was counteracted by the p2y receptor antagonists cangrelor and mrs2179 , whereas its activation by cyslts was antagonized by montelukast and pranlukast , two already marketed cyslt receptor blockers ( ibidem ) .
both the human and the previously unknown rat receptor were found to be highly expressed in organs typically undergoing ischemic damage , i.e. , brain , heart and kidney .
moreover , in the mcao rat model , 48 hours after ischemia induction , gpr17 - immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the ipsilateral cortex both within and at the borders of the ischemic infarct , suggesting a potential role in the evolution of ischemic damage .
on the other hand , in a recent transcriptome study comparing the gene expression pattern of human fetal and adult neuroprogenitor cells ( npcs ) , gpr17 was identified as one of the three genes that were exclusively expressed in adult hippocampal npcs [ 12 ] , thus highlighting a potential role in brain repair .
thus , gpr17 may have a differential role in brain response to injury , depending upon whether the receptor is already constitutively expressed by the cell or is induced as a result of brain insult .
moreover , a differential role of gpr17 may also depend on specific phases of brain response after the insult ( sequentially , death of irreversibly damaged cells , clearance of dead cells , remodeling and repair ) .
on this basis , the present study has been specifically aimed at assessing the localization of gpr17 in cells of different lineages ( neurons , glia and neural progenitor cells ) of the intact mouse brain and its changes at different times after induction of focal cerebral ischemia in the mcao model .
we show that in the intact brain gpr17 is expressed by neurons and by a subset of adult quiescent parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitors .
following ischemia , gpr17 is sequentially induced in neurons , microglia / macrophages and adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells , suggesting that it may act as a common regulatory gene mediating response to injury in embryonically - distinct cell types .
this indicates gpr17 as a possible target for pharmacological intervention in neurodegeneration processes including cerebral ischemia and demyelinating diseases .
results cloning and characterization of mouse gpr17 to study in detail the role of gpr17 in brain injury , the well established model of focal cerebral ischemia in the mouse ( mcao ) was chosen .
thus , as a first step , we cloned and characterized the previously uncharacterized murine gpr17 ortholog ( genbank nm _ 001025381 ) .
mouse gpr17 , which is localized on chromosome 18 , contains a 1020 base pairs open reading frame ( orf ) that encodes for a putative 339 amino acid protein 90 and 98 % identical to human and rat gpr17 [ 11 ] .
specific external primers were used to amplify cdna from several mouse tissues .
specific pcr products of the expected mw ( 1022 bp ) were obtained from mouse brain , kidney , heart and skeletal muscle , but not from liver and lung ( figure s1a ) .
the 1022 bp pcr product from mouse brain cdna was then cloned into a pcdna3.1 / v5 - his - topo expression vector .
the plasmid containing the positive murine gpr17 clone ( pcdna3.1 - gpr17m ) was used to transiently transfect 1321n1 human astrocytoma cells , a cell line lacking endogenous p2y receptors and already utilized for the characterization of human and rat gpr17 [ 11 ] .
expression of the transfected receptor was assessed by the appearance of a pcr product of the expected 1022 bp length in cells receiving pcdna3.1 - gpr17m , whereas no expression of mgpr17 was found in cells transfected with the corresponding empty vector ( figure s1b ) .
to confirm that the receptor transcript is indeed translated into the receptor protein , we utilized a rabbit anti - gpr17 polyclonal antibody that also recognizes human and rat gpr17 [ 11 ] .
as expected , upon incubation with this antibody , 1321n1 cells transfected with pcdna3.1 - gpr17m showed a specific immunoreactive signal which , instead , was not detected in cells receiving the corresponding empty vector ( figure s1c ) .
to further confirm the specificity of these results , in the mgpr17 - expressing cells , pre - adsorption of the anti - receptor antibody with the neutralizing peptide utilized for immunization completely abolished the gpr17 signal ( figure s1c ) .
the pharmacological profile of mgpr17 was then assessed .
since stimulation of gpcrs results in increased binding of gtp to g proteins ( which can , in turn , be quantified by measuring [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding to purified membranes ; see [ 13 ]) , gpr17 activation in the heterologous system was determined by testing the increase of [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding by exogenously - added agonists in membranes from transfected cells [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
full concentration - response curves with the uracil nucleotide udp , the sugar nucleotides udp - glucose and udp - galactose and the cyslts ltc4 , ltd4 and lte4 were performed .
in gpr17 - expressing cells , udp , udp - glucose and udp - galactose concentration - dependently stimulated gtpgammas binding with ec50 values of 55 +/ - 6.2 , 88 +/ - 7.4 and 68 +/ - 7.3 nm , respectively ( figure 1a ) .
all tested leukotriene derivatives ( i.e. , ltc4 , ltd4 , and lte4 ) were able to stimulate receptor - g protein coupling with a similar potency , with estimated ec50 values of 0.74 +/ - 0.2 nm for ltc4 , 0.63 +/ - 0.1 nm for ltd4 and 0.31 +/ - 0.09 nm for lte4 ( figure 1b ) .
none of these agonists , tested at the highest concentration utilized in figure 1a and 1b , had any effect in cells transfected with the pcdna3.1 empty vector ( figure 1c ) .
the ability of some known purinergic and cyslt antagonists to counteract agonist - induced gtpgammas binding stimulation in cells expressing mgpr17 was also assessed .
cangrelor , a p2y12 / 13 antagonist , which displayed a high affinity towards human and rat gpr17 [ 11 ] concentration - dependently inhibited gtpgammas binding stimulated by udp with an ic50 value of 1.2 +/ - 0.3 nm. in a similar way , the cyslt1 antagonist montelukast concentration - dependently inhibited gtpgammas binding stimulated by ltd4 , with an ic50 value of 61 +/ - 4.6 nm ( figure 1d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003579.g001 figure 1 effect of purinergic and leukotriene ligands on mgpr17 with [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding .
membrane aliquots ( 10 microg ) , obtained from 1321n1 cells transfected with pcdna3.1 - gpr17m ( a,b ) , were incubated with the indicated concentrations of purinergic ( a ) or leukotriene ( b ) agonists .
( c ) membranes from cells transfected with the pcdna3.1 empty vector were incubated with udp , udp - glucose or udp - galactose ( all at 10 microm ) or with ltd4 , ltc4 and lte4 ( all at 50 nm ) , as indicated .
( d ) effect of p2y or cyslt receptor antagonist on agonist - stimulated [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding .
membranes from pcdna3.1 - gpr17m transfected cells were pre - incubated for 10 min with graded montelukast ( 1 nm - 1 microm ) or cangrelor ( 0.01 nm - 100 nm ) concentrations and then stimulated with 500 nm udp or 50 nm ltd4 , respectively .
all data are expressed as percentage of basal [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding ( set to 100 %) and represent the mean +/ - sem of three different experiments each performed in duplicate .
globally , these data characterize the previously unknown mouse gpr17 receptor , demonstrate that this receptor is indeed expressed at high levels in various organs ( including brain ) and that , in a similar way to the already characterized human and rat receptors , this receptor can be dually activated by two distinct classes of endogenous ligands , uracil nucleotides and cyslts , which are both released in great amounts in the injured brain .
moreover , they also show that the mouse receptor more closely resembles the response profile of the human receptor [ 11 ] .
in brain , gpr17 is normally expressed in neurons and in a subset of adult neural precursor cells we then utilized the specific anti - gpr17 antibody to determine the cellular localization of gpr17 in control mouse brain .
coronal sections taken at different brain levels were immuno - labeled with the anti - receptor antibody in parallel with markers of neuronal or glial cells .
in the intact cerebral cortex , immunohistochemical studies with a high sensitivity amplification kit revealed gpr17 expression in two distinct types of cells .
one cell type had neuronal morphology ( see asterisks in figure 2a ) : the neuronal nature of these gpr17 - positive ( gpr17 +) cells was confirmed by co - staining with the neuronal specific markers smi - 311 ( figure 2b ) and neun ( figure 2c ) .
higher magnification analysis of these cells suggested that , as expected for a gpcr , gpr17 was selectively expressed in the plasma - membrane of neun + neurons ( figure 2d , 2d ' , 2d '') .
conversely , no co - localization was found with cortical astrocytes , as shown by labeling with the specific markers gfap ( figure 2e ) and s100beta ( figure 2f ) .
the other cell type expressing gpr17 displayed small cell bodies with fine radiating processes ( see arrows in figure 2a , 2a ' inset , and arrows in figure 2f ) .
these cells were dispersed in both gray ( figure 2a ) and white matter ( not shown ) and were reminiscent of precursor cells [ 16 ] .
to investigate the nature of the highly branched gpr17 + cells , we performed staining for the pre - oligodendroglial specific proteoglycan ng2 [ 17 ] .
double - staining experiments revealed a heterogeneous population of ramified cells .
in particular , 3 distinct phenotypes of gpr17 + ramified cells were found : a first cell type was characterized by exclusive expression of ng2 ( arrowheads in figure 2g ) , a second by exclusive expression of gpr17 ( white arrows in figure 2g ) while a third cell type co - expressed both markers ( blue arrows in figure 2g and inset ) .
quantitative analysis of these cells showed that about 1 / 4 of the ramified gpr17 + cells also displayed ng2 staining .
co - expression with markers of pre - oligodendrocytes was further confirmed using an antibody against the transcription factor olig2 , a key regulator of oligodendrocyte development [ 17 ] .
in this case , a much higher number of gpr17 + cells were also positive for olig2 .
quantitative fluorescence microscopy analysis of full hemisphere sections in 3 animals showed that 59.18 +/ - 5.46 % of the ramified gpr17 + cells indeed also co - expressed olig2 in their nuclei ( figure 2h and 2h ' ; a mean of 680 +/ - 52.2 gpr17 + cells were counted / animal ; of these , 403 +/ - 49.7 also positively stained for olig2 ) .

double fluorescence labeling of mouse brain coronal sections with anti - gpr17 antibody ( red fluorescence ) and markers for different cell lineages ( green fluorescence ) .
( a ) in the intact cortex , gpr17 expression is detected in large round cells present at high density ( examples are illustrated by asterisks ) and in sparse ramified cells ( arrows and a ' inset ) .
virtually all gpr17 + large cell bodies display co - expression of the neuronal proteins smi311 ( b ) or neun ( c ) , demonstrating their neuronal identity .
d panels show higher magnification images of two neurons showing immunopositivity for both gpr17 ( red channel , d ) , and neun ( green channel , d ') ; ( d '') merge of the two fluorescence channels .
in cortex , we found no co - localization of gpr17 with the astroglial markers gfap ( e ) and s100beta ( f , arrows indicate gpr17 + cells ) ; several ramified gpr17 - labeled cells instead co - stained for either ng2 ( blue arrows in g ) or olig2 ( h , h ') , which are both pre - oligodendrocyte markers .
however , in the case of ng2 , only a partial co - localization was found , since some cells only stained for ng2 ( arrowheads in g ) and some others only stained for gpr17 ( white arrows in g , h ) .
co - localization was much higher in the case of gpr17 and olig2 ( see text for quantification ) .
in some cases , ng2 + or olig2 + cells show immunoreactivity for gpr17 in discrete cell body compartments ( inset in g and h '' , respectively ; for details , see text ) .
i and j depict no co - localization of gpr17 with myelin - related proteins ( cnpase in i and mag in j ) .
some " resting " microglial cells were also found in cortex , as suggested by staining with the specific marker iba1 ( k ) : in the intact brain , none of these cells expressed gpr17 .
scale bars : a : 25 microm ; a ' , d , d ' , d '' , h ' , h '' : 10 microm ; b , e , f , g : 50 microm ; h , i , j , k : 20 microm .
interestingly , in some olig2 or ng2 - labeled cells , gpr17 immunoreactivity displayed an asymmetrical subcellular localization , suggesting gpr17 accumulation in the golgi apparatus ( figure 2h '' and inset in figure 2g ) .
this specific staining pattern may represent a well defined gpr17 maturation stage prior to distribution of the receptor to the plasma - membrane .
the branched gpr17 + cells did not incorporate brdu in their nuclei , at least under the conditions of brdu treatment utilized here ( data not shown ) , suggesting that , in the intact brain , gpr17 decorates a subset of quiescent non - proliferating parenchymal oligodendrocyte precursors .
furthermore , no colocalization of gpr17 was found with more mature myelinating oligodendroglial markers , as shown by lack of double - staining with either cnpase ( figure 2i ) , myelin - associated glycoprotein mag ( figure 2j ) and myelin basic protein mbp or apc ( data not shown ) , suggesting that gpr17 may be expressed at a specific stage of oligodendroglial differentiation .
finally , no gpr17 co - expression was found in resting microglia detected by anti - iba1 staining in the intact brain ( figure 2k ) ( however , see : " expression pattern of gpr17 during ischemia evolution ") .
gpr17 + ramified cells were also found in corpus callosum : most of these cells co - stained for olig2 but not with ng2 and did not seem to proliferate under resting conditions ( not shown ) .
interestingly , in c. striatum , gpr17 + precursor cells were not positive for mbp , but were often found physically associated to or inside myelinating fibers ( figure s2 ) .
based on previous data demonstrating that gpr17 is one of the 3 key genes expressed in human adult npcs [ 12 ] , we also looked at the presence of gpr17 + cells in classical mouse brain neurogenic areas , i.e. , the subventricular zone ( svz ) of lateral ventricles ( lv ) and the dentate gyrus ( dg ) of hippocampus .
the first layer of brain ventricles wall consists of ependymal cells , i.e. , radial glia - derived cells that intensively stain for the astrocyte marker s100beta [ 18 ] ( green fluorescence in figure 3a ) .
several of these cells were also immunoreactive for gpr17 ( red fluorescence in figure 3a ; cells expressing both s100beta and gpr17 are in yellow ) .
gpr17 + ramified cells with a morphology very similar to that of the parenchymal precursors described above were also detected immediately below the ependyma as well as in more profound layers of the subependymal zone ( figure 3b - d ) .
these cells never co - stained with either the stem cell marker nestin ( not shown ) , gfap ( figure 3b ) or the neuronal precursor marker double - cortin ( dcx ) ( figure 3d ) , suggesting that gpr17 is not expressed by gfap + multipotent stem cells or by dcx + neuronal precursors [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
highly branched gpr17 + cells were also found in the subgranular layer of the hippocampus ( figure 3e ) ; also here , no colocalization of gpr17 with the adult neural stem cell marker gfap was found .
none of these gpr17 + precursors proliferated under normal conditions .

micrographs depicting gpr17 staining in coronal sections of the intact anterior forebrain .
( a ) in the walls of the lateral ventricles ( lv ) , gpr17 ( red fluorescence ) is highly expressed in ependymal cells , which are in direct contact with ventricle cavities and also express the s100beta protein ( green fluorescence ) .
cells co - expressing both gpr17 and s100beta in this cell layer are indicated in yellow .
( b , c ) specific gpr17 staining ( red fluorescence ) is also found in the subependymal layer of lv .
( b ) : several of these cells show a morphology that is reminiscent of the gpr17 + oligodendrocyte precursors found in brain parenchyma ( see also figure 2 and panel d ) .
these gpr17 + cells do not co - stain for the astrocytic marker gfap ( green fluorescence in b ) , that is also specifically expressed by multipotent adult stem cells .
( c ) as expected , in the subependymal layer of lateral ventricles , several double - cortin ( dcx )+ neuronal precursors are evident ( red fluorescence ) ; however , these cells do not co - express gpr17 ( here shown in green fluorescence ) .
( d ) an additional image of gpr17 + ramified precursors ( red fluorescence ) in lv subependymal layer ( arrows ) and in c. striatum ( cst ) of brain parenchyma ( hoechst 33258 staining of cell nuclei is also shown in blue ) .
gpr17 + cells in the subependymal layer were often found to protrude their processes in the ventricular cavity .
( e ) double fluorescence image showing expression of gpr17 ( red fluorescence ) in ramified cells in the hippocampus ( dg : dentate gyrus ) .
also in this brain area , gpr17 immunoreactivity does not co - localize with gfap ( green fluorescence ) .
scale bars : a - c 50 microm ; d 10 microm ; e 100 microm .
globally , the data described above show that , in the intact mouse brain , gpr17 is expressed by neurons and by a subset of precursor cells in both parenchyma and neurogenic areas .
in the parenchyma , gpr17 segregates to a subset of ng2 +/ olig2 + precursor cells that never proliferated under control conditions , suggesting that there are quiescent pre - oligodendrocytes .
in the neurogenic areas , gpr17 decorates a subset of non - proliferating , nestin - , gfap - and dcx - cells of yet undefined nature .
activation of gpr17 in vitro by the endogenous agonists udp - glucose and ltd4 promotes pre - oligodendrocyte differentiation to mature myelinating cells to gain more information on the role of gpr17 in pre - oligodendrocyte precursors , we characterized the behaviour of these cells in mixed neuron / glia cortical cultures , where many gpr17 + cells were found ( figure 4a - h ) .
these cells displayed a very typical highly ramified morphology resembling that of the precursor cells found in vivo .
as also observed in the intact brain for the parenchymal precursors , these gpr17 + cells never expressed nestin ( figure 4a ) , gfap ( figure 4b ) , map2 ( figure 4c ) or beta - tubiii ( figure 4d ) , suggesting that they are not stem cells , nor astrocytes or neurons .
to investigate in detail whether gpr17 is specifically expressed by pre - oligodendrocytes , we performed double staining experiments with a set of markers identifying different stages of differentiation , i.e. , ng2 ( oligodendrocyte precursor ) , o4 and cnpase ( pre - oligodendrocytes , immature / mature cells ) , and mbp ( mature oligodendrocytes ) [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
gpr17 + cells were found to co - express either ng2 ( arrows in figure 4e ) , olig2 ( not shown ) , o4 ( arrows in figure 4f ) , or , to a lesser extent , cnpase ( figure 4g ) , confirming that they are indeed oligodendrocyte precursors .
conversely , very few cells co - expressed the mature oligodendrocyte marker mbp ( figure 4h ; see also below ) .
expression of gpr17 in oligodendrocyte precursors was also confirmed by single - cell pcr .
for this analysis , one cell or a small group of cells ( up to 10 ) were picked up from living cultures using cell morphology as a guide at the light microscope ( see arrows in figure 4i ) .
receptor expression was detected in both the single - cell and the 10 - cell samples , as indicated in the pcr panel of figure 4i , where rat cortex was utilized as a positive control .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003579.g004 figure 4 presence and activation of gpr17 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells of primary cortical cultures maintained in vitro .
several gpr17 + ramified cells ( green fluorescence ) reminiscent of the precursors found in vivo were consistently found in primary neuron / glia cortical cultures .
micrographs ( a - h ) show their phenotype characterization .
these cells ( green fluorescence ) did not co - express the stem cell marker nestin ( a ) , or the astrocytic marker gfap ( b ) , or the neuronal markers map2 ( c ) and beta - tubiii ( d ) , but were instead positive for several pre - oligodendrocyte markers , such as ng2 ( arrows in e ) and o4 ( arrows in f ) , which appear quite early during oligodendrocyte differentiation .
colocalization of gpr17 with these markers is shown in yellow - orange cells .
a lower number of gpr17 + cells also expressed cnpase ( arrow in g ) and very few costained for mbp ( arrow in h ) , which are markers of more mature oligodendroglia ( for more details , see text ) .
in blue , hoechst 33258 stained nuclei .
single cell rt - pcr was used to confirm expression of gpr17 in oligodendroglial - like cells ( i ) .
for this analysis , cells were picked up from living cultures using cell morphology as a guide at the light microscope .
left micrograph : an example of a brightfield showing cells ( arrows ) with oligodendrocyte morphology .
these cells can be distinguished from neurons based on their size ( approximately 1 / 3 the size of neurons ) , phase - dark cell bodies and presence of fine ramifications .
the oligodendrocyte nature of cells with this morphology was confirmed by co - immunostaining for o4 and gpr17 at a subsequent time after culture fixing ( arrows in right micrograph ). by following this method , one living cell or a small number of cells ( up to 10 ) were sucked from living cultures ( see materials and methods ) and processed for rt - pcr analysis .
significant gpr17 expression was detected in both the single - cell and the 10 - cell samples , as indicated in the pcr panel .
rat cortex was utilized as a positive control ( see last lane ) .
scale bars : 15 microm .
in these primary cultures , the number of gpr17 + cells spontaneously increased as a function of time ( j ) ; div : days in vitro .
( k ) quantification of the percentage of gpr17 + cells that also co - express the indicated oligodendrocyte markers .
total number ( n ) of gpr17 + cells counted from two different coverslips for each preparation : for ng2 , n = 3502 ; for o4 , n = 2685 ; for cnpase , n = 1738 ; for mbp , n = 3615 .
data were obtained from five different primary culture preparations .
( l ) exposure of cultures to maximal ( 100 microm ) udp - glucose ( udp - glc ) concentrations for 72 h induced a highly significant increase in the number of mature mbp + oligodendroglial cells .
the number of gpr17 + cells was also increased .
both effects were partially counteracted in the presence of the p2y receptor antagonist cangrelor .
( m ) exposure of cultures to maximal ( 100 nm ) ltd4 concentrations for 72 h also induced a significant increase in the number of mature mbp + oligodendroglial cells and of gpr17 + cells .
no synergistic nor additive effects were found when both agonists were combined together .
there were no significant changes in the total number of cells in culture during the 72 h treatment , as shown by labeling of cells nuclei with hoechst 33258 .
* p < 0.05 compared to control ; ** p < 0.05 with respect to udp - glc and not different from control ; # p = 0.15 with respect to control and p = 0.245 with respect to udp - glc , one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) .
the number of the gpr17 + precursors constantly increased with time in culture ( figure 4j ) .
a quantification of the percentage of the gpr17 + cells at various oligodendrocyte differentiation stages in 10 - day old cultures is shown in figure 4k .
a prevalence of gpr17 + cells expressing early oligodendroglial markers such as ng2 or o4 , was constantly found .
no significant relative changes of this distribution was observed with time in culture , at least up to day 20 ( data not shown ) .
in order to verify whether gpr17 in cultured precursors is functional and whether its activation can promote cell progression along their differentiation pathway , cultures were treated with udp - glucose , which selectively binds to this receptor and activates it [ 11 ] .
exposure of cultures to a maximal concentration ( 100 microm ) of udp - glucose for 72 h did not have any effect on cell viability , as demonstrated with propidium iodide ( pi ) that does not enter viable intact cells and can only label the nuclei of cells with damaged permeabilized membrane .
in control cultures , pi labeled a small percentage of cells ( 16.3 +/ - 3.5 % , n = 4 ) .
this low percentage of cell death , which is reasonably expected for a primary in vitro culture , was not different in udp - glucose treated cells ( 13.7 +/ - 1.9 % , n = 4 ) .
udp - glucose treatment instead resulted in a significant increase of the number of gpr17 + precursor cells , suggesting that activation of the receptor may itself promote receptor expression , and , more important , it markedly increased the number of mature mbp + oligodendroglial cells ( figure 4l ) .
both effects were partially counteracted by the p2y receptor antagonist cangrelor ( ibidem ) .
exposure to a maximal concentration ( 100 nm ) of ltd4 also significantly increased both the number of gpr17 + and mature mbp + oligodendroglial cells ( figure 4m ) .
no synergistic effects were observed when cells were treated with a combined protocol ( figure 4m ) .
the total number of cells in culture did not significantly increase during the 72 h treatment period with pharmacological agents , as suggested by labeling of cell nuclei with hoechst 33258 ( figure 4l and 4m ) , to support the conclusion that , in these cultures , activation of gpr17 by its endogenous agonists is actually inducing the in vitro maturation of already existing oligodendrocyte precursors .
thus , gpr17 is already functional in pre - oligodendrocytes and its activation promotes the progression of these cells along their differentiation pathway .
expression pattern of gpr17 during ischemia evolution to characterize the changes of gpr17 occurring during ischemic damage , mouse brains were processed for immunohistochemistry at 24 , 48 , 72 hours and 1 week after mcao .
within the lesioned area , a strong up - regulation of gpr17 was observed 24 h after mcao ( figure 5a ) with respect to the corresponding unlesioned area of the contralateral cortex ( figure 5c ) .
inside the injured area , most of the gpr17 + cells co - localized with the neuronal marker neun ( figure 5b ) , suggesting that receptor up - regulation indeed occurred in neurons .
forty - eight hours after mcao , a dramatic decrease of both the number of neuronal cells and of gpr17 immunoreactivity was found inside the lesion , suggesting that neurons over - expressing gpr17 at 24 h had undergone cell death ( figure 5d ) .
several shrunk cells overexpressing gpr17 and resembling damaged neurons were also found at the borders of the ischemic infarct ( figure 5d ) .
some of these cells also positively stained for neun ( data not shown ) and for the chaperon protein hsp70 ( figure 5e ) , which is known to be up - regulated in neurons upon damage [ 24 ] .
western blot analysis of gpr17 performed in membrane ( m ) and cytosolic ( c ) fractions confirmed increased expression of a membrane protein band of approximately 50 kda ( likely corresponding to a glycosylated form of the receptor ) in the lesioned hemisphere ( mcao ) compared to the intact contralateral ( con ) side ( figure 5 , right panel ) .
as expected for a membrane receptor , no specific signal for the anti - gpr17 antibody was detected in cytosolic fractions ( ibidem ) .
to confirm that this band is indeed gpr17 , immunolabeling was abolished in the presence of the neutralizing peptide .
a quantification of the mcao - induced up - regulation of gpr17 is shown in histograms .
globally , these findings suggest that , upon damage , gpr17 is up - regulated in injured neurons and that this up - regulation may be causally related to cell death .
at this stage of damage development , gfap + activated astrocytes indicating astrogliosis were also visible at the borders of the injured area , but none of these cells expressed gpr17 ( data not shown ) .

micrographs show coronal brain slices obtained from mice 24 , 48 , 72 hours after mcao .
brain drawings in insets show the areas ( squares ) where micrographs were taken .
( a ) twenty - four h after mcao , immunohistochemistry with an anti - gpr17 antibody ( red fluorescence ) show a marked up - regulation of the receptor within the ischemic lesioned area ( the region delimited by the dotted line ) .
basal expression of gpr17 in the corresponding contralateral area is shown in c for comparison .
( b ) cells showing marked gpr17 expression inside the lesioned area also express the specific neuronal marker neun , confirming that these cells are indeed neurons .
( d ) forty - eight h after mcao , gpr17 + neurons inside the lesioned area are markedly reduced , suggesting induction of cell death .
at this time point , a marked up - regulation of gpr17 appears in neurons at the border of the lesion .
( e ) these cells co - localize with the neuronal damage marker hsp70 ( see text for more details ) .
up - regulation of gpr17 in the ischemic area is also confirmed by western blot analysis in membrane ( m ) and cytosolic ( c ) fractions from intact contralateral ( con ) and ipsilateral ischemic ( mcao ) cortex of mice ( right panel ) .
gpr17 is identified with an anti - gpr17 antibody as an immunoreactive protein band with an approximate 50 kda molecular weight ; as expected for a membrane receptor , this band is present in membranes but not in cytosolic fractions .
to confirm blot specificity , the 50 kda protein band is abolished in the presence of the neutralizing peptide ( indicated as + pept ) .
a marked increase of the intensity of this band is found after mcao ( the quantification of this increase is shown in histograms as % of control set to 100 % ; results from 5 experiments ) .
forty - eight h ( not shown ) and seventy - two h after mcao ( f ) , there is a marked increase of gpr17 + cells at the border of the lesioned area .
( g ) these cells are not neurons but they are microglia / macrophages infiltrating the ischemic area , since most of them also positively stain for ib4 , a microglia / macrophage marker ( see also text ) .
these gpr17 +/ ib4 + cells are indeed found inside the lesioned area one week after mcao ( data not shown ) .
scale bars : 50 microm .
starting from 48 h and highly evident seventy - two h after mcao , a marked expression of gpr17 was found at the boundaries of the lesioned area ( figure 5f ) , but this time immunoreactivity was associated to cells also expressing ib4 , a marker of activated microglia / macrophages ( figure 5g ) .
under the staining conditions utilized here , no specific ib4 labeling was detected in the intact contralateral side ( data not shown ) .
one week after mcao , gpr17 immunopositivity was again increased within the damaged area : also these cells were all ib4 + , suggesting that they are indeed the macrophages / microglia found at the lesion borders at day 3 , that were now infiltrating the lesioned area ( data not shown ) .
these data show that after up - regulation in neurons , there is a second wave of gpr17 induction in microglia / macrophages as soon as these cells are activated and recruited toward the lesioned area as a consequence of damage .
based on the demonstration of gpr17 on npcs [ 12 ] ( figure 3 ) and on the finding that ischemic damage induces proliferation of adult npcs in brain 's neurogenic areas and parenchyma [ 25 ] , we investigated whether cells expressing gpr17 also underwent proliferation after mcao , as assessed in vivo by brdu administration .
as shown in figure 6 , 72 h after mcao , a marked increase in the number of proliferating cells was found in the lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere with respect to the corresponding unlesioned side ( compare green dots in brain 's schematic drawing ) .
two main types of brdu +/ gpr17 + cells were found in the ischemic side .
the first cells were mainly found at the borders of the injured area ( indicated as 1 in brain 's drawing ) and appeared as small globular cells ( figure 6a ) which markedly stained for ib4 ( figure 6b ) .
so , these cells are the microglia / macrophages about to infiltrate the lesioned tissue , already shown in figure 5 .
the morphology of the second proliferating cell type very closely resembled the parenchymal highly branched pre - oligodendrocytes already described in figure 2 ( see also figure 6c ) and positively stained for both gpr17 ( figure 5d ) and olig2 ( figure 5e ) .
these parenchymal branched gpr17 + precursors were consistently found in the c. striatum ( indicated as 2 in brain drawing ) as well as in regions closer to the lesion borders .
quantification of the gpr17 + precursor cells in 3 animals revealed a 24.07 +/ - 5.23 % increase in number with respect to the unlesioned contralateral side ( total number of cells counted : 2542 and 2039 in the ischemic versus the contralateral side ) .
at variance from the intact brain , in the injured brain , some of these precursor cells also positively stained for apc , a marker of mature oligodendroglia ( figure 6f and 6g ) .
as expected , brain injury also induced the activation of precursor cells in the svz ( indicated as 3 in brain drawing ) , where many brdu +/ dcx + cells started proliferating ( figure 6h ) .
however , no changes in gpr17 + cells were found in this neurogenic area ( not shown ) at least at this time frame after mcao .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003579.g006 figure 6 characterization of proliferating cells in adult mouse brain after induction of mcao .
to evaluate injury - induced cell proliferation , brdu ( 50 mg / kg ) was administered twice a day for 3 days to ischemic mice starting from the afternoon of mcao .
animals were sacrified 4 h after the last brdu injection and coronal brain slices prepared for immunohistochemical analysis ( for further details , see materials and methods ) .
seventy - two h after mcao , a marked increase of brdu + cells is found in the ipsilateral lesioned hemisphere with respect to the contralateral unlesioned side ( compare green dots in brain 's drawing ) .
many of these cells are also gpr17 + .
two main types of brdu +/ gpr17 + cells are found .
( a , b ) a first , small globular cell type is mainly found in the peri - lesioned area ( indicated as 1 in brain 's drawing ) ; these cells also markedly stain for ib4 and are indeed the microglia / macrophages about to infiltrate the ischemic lesion already described in figure 5 .
( c - e ) a second , ramified brdu +/ gpr17 + cell type ( d ) reminiscent of the parenchymal olig2 + pre - oligodendrocytes ( c , e ; see also text ) already described in the intact brain ( figure 2 ) is consistently found in the c. striatum ( indicated as 2 in brain drawing ) as well as in regions closer to the lesioned area ( not shown ) .
the number of these cells was significantly higher in the ipsilateral with respect to the unlesioned contralateral side ( see text for more details ) .
( f , g ) some of these proliferating precursor cells also positively stained for apc , a marker of mature oligodendroglia , suggesting initiation of re - myelination .
( h ) as expected , in the ispilateral svz ( indicated as 3 in brain drawing ) , a marked increase of double - positive brdu +/ dcx + cells is found with respect to the unlesioned hemisphere .
however , none of these cells expressed gpr17 ( not shown ) .
scale bars : 50 microm .
globally , these data show that induction of brain damage is associated to activation of gpr17 .
very early ( 24 h ) after the insult , gpr17 is transiently upregulated in neurons ( which already express this receptor under physiological conditions ) in parallel with the appearance of the cellular stress marker hsp70 .
gpr17 labeling in the lesioned area decreases as cell death progresses .
starting from 48 - 72 h after ischemia , gpr17 immuno - labeling appears on microglia / macrophages infiltrating the injured area .
at this stage , a subset of gpr17 + oligodendrocyte progenitors in the peri - lesion area start to proliferate and to express mature oligodendroglia markers , suggesting differentiation to mature cells .
the in vivo knock down of gpr17 markedly attenuates brain ischemic damage in mice the data shown above suggest that gpr17 may represent a " sensor " of damage activated very early during ischemia induction and contributing to cell death .
if this were true , its inhibition during mcao should contrast cell death inside the ischemic core and attenuate the evolution of ischemic damage .
to address this issue , 6 mice received an anti - sense oligonucleotide ( 616 ) specifically designed to knock down this receptor in vivo .
animals were injected intracerebroventricularly 20 min and 24 h after mcao .
this biotechnological strategy [ 26 ] has been proven to very efficiently downregulate other gpcrs in the brain [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] and has been already successfully utilized by us in ischemic rats [ 11 ] .
another group of 6 animals received in parallel a " scrambled " oligonucleotide randomly generated on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of 616 .
this group of animals was utilized as a control group in this set of experiments .
finally , another group of 6 animals received cangrelor , that , although not selective for gpr17 ( see " cloning and characterization of mouse gpr17 ") , has been shown by us to potently inhibit gpr17 in both the rat [ 11 ] and in the mouse ( the present study ) .
the evolution of ischemic damage was followed longitudinally in living animals by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) at 2 , 24 and 48 h after mcao .
there were no changes between groups in the mean brain ischemic volume at 2 h after mcao ( see figure 7 legend ) .
in the lesioned hemispheres of animals receiving the scrambled oligonucleotide , as expected , brain infarct volume increased dramatically between 2 and 48 h. conversely , in animals treated with 616 , progression of ischemic damage at 24 and 48 h was markedly reduced , and , in the case of cangrelor , totally abolished ( see figure 7a for representative images and figure 7b for quantification and statistical analysis ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003579.g007 figure 7 effect of the in vivo knock down of gpr17 , by either a biotechnological or a pharmacological strategy , on brain infarct size evolution , as determined by mri .
( a ) representative tr ( d ) images of coronal brain sections from ischemic mice treated with either an anti - sense oligonucleotide specifically designed to knock down gpr17 ( 616 ) or cangrelor ( can ) , in comparison with animals treated with a " scrambled " randomly designed oligonucleotide ( scr ) .
images were taken from the same animals at 2 , 24 and 48 h after mcao .
dotted lines indicate the extension of the ischemic infarct .
( b ) quantitative analysis of infarct size volume at 24 and 48 hours after mcao in mice receiving scr , 616 or can ( mean of 6 animals / group ) .
data are expressed as percentage variation of infarct volume at 24 and 48 h after mcao compared to 2 h considered as 100 % ( see also materials and methods ) .
there were no statistically significant differences between groups in the ischemic infarct volumes at 2 h ( src = 23.4 +/ - 7.47 ; 616 = 23.9 +/ - 7.2 ; can = 16.4 +/ - 4.23 mm3 ) .
** p < 0.001 versus 2 h ; # p < 0.05 versus corresponding scr animals .
bioinformatic analysis showed that 616 , that effectively reduced brain infarct evolution , was not homologous to any other gpcr ( see materials and methods ) .
this strongly indicates that gpr17 is indeed the specific target of 616 , thus confirming a specific role for this receptor in the changes associated to ischemic damage development .
discussion gpr17 : a receptor with a dual role in both neuronal death and in brain repair ?
we have previously suggested that an up - regulation of the hybrid nucleotide / cysteinyl - leukotriene receptor gpr17 in the ischemic brain may contribute to the evolution of damage [ 11 ] .
a causal link between up - regulation of gpr17 and extent of brain damage was suggested by data showing that inhibition of gpr17 by either pharmacological agents or by an antisense - oligonucleotide strategy markedly attenuated cell death ( ibidem ) .
however , gpr17 has also been reported to be one of the 3 key genes expressed in human adult neuroprogenitor cells [ 12 ] , which would instead suggest a potential role in brain repair .
these apparently conflicting results suggest that gpr17 might play differential roles in different cell types and / or under specific pathophysiological conditions ; for example , it may well be that , upon injury , gpr17 is induced in distinct cell types depending upon specific phases of damage development , remodeling and repair .
on this basis , the present study was purposely undertaken to ( i ) define the cellular localization of gpr17 in the intact mouse brain and shed light on its potential roles under physiological conditions ; and ( ii ) , to define possible changes of this receptor in the cell types that participate to brain damage and repair in a well - established focal ischemia model such as the mcao model in the mouse .
mouse gpr17 closely reproduces the functional features of human gpr17 as a first step to these aims , we cloned and characterized the previously unknown mouse ortholog of gpr17 and compared its pharmacology with that of the already known human receptor [ 11 ] .
mouse gpr17 is 90 % identical to the human receptor and , importantly , its response profile to ligands is closer to that of the human receptor with respect to the rat receptor .
despite some differences in the affinities of udp and udp - glucose , which were more potent at the mouse compared to the human receptor , potencies of cyslts were in the same range .
moreover , while the endogenous ligand udp - galactose is totally ineffective at rat gpr17 , this nucleotide significantly activates both the human [ 11 ] and the mouse receptor ( the present study ) .
finally , for antagonists , while there are significant differences between man and rat , the p2y and cyslt blockers cangrelor and montelukast display almost identical antagonistic activities at both human and mouse gpr17 ([ 11 ] ; figure 1 ) .
therefore , globally , the mouse receptor more closely reproduces the features of the human receptor , thus validating the mouse mcao model utilized here as the most appropriate experimental model to assess the role of gpr17 in brain injury .
gpr17 as a new player in oligodendrocyte differentiation immunohistochemical studies with a specific , in - house made anti - gpr17 antibody showed that , in the intact mouse telencephalon , gpr17 is present on both neurons and in a subpopulation of ramified non proliferating olig2 + or ng2 + precursor cells dispersed in both gray and white matter .
in particular , the number of ramified precursors expressing both olig2 and gpr17 is very high , to suggest that olig2 , which is a transcriptional factor , may drive the expression of gpr17 in these cells. by bioinformatic analysis , we indeed found 14 potential olig2 - responsive elements in the upstream region of the gpr17 gene .
these responsive elements can bind to either olig2 itself or to other members of the olig2 transcription factor family , such as atoh1 , neurod1 , neurod2 , neurod4 , neurod6 , neurog1 , neurog2 , neurog3 , tgf12 and tgf3 ( figure s3 ) .
in both the human , rat and mouse gpr17 upstream regions , 6 phylogenetically conserved domains were found : two of them ( indicated as e - box 1 and e - box 2 in figure s3 ) are particularly interesting , since they are identical in the 3 species and contain 2 responsive elements for members of the olig2 transcription factor family .
in the intact brain parenchyma , none of the gpr17 + precursor cells expressed either gfap , or dcx or mature oligodendrocyte / myelination markers , suggesting that gpr17 specifically decorates mature neurons and quiescent pre - oligodendrocytes .
interestingly , in c. striatum , immature gpr17 +/ mbp - negative precursor cells were often found physically associated to or inside myelin tracts , which have been previously shown to also contain immature olig2 + cells [ 29 ] .
these gpr17 + cells may represent a source of pre - oligodendrocytes able to turn into myelinating cells when necessary ; alternatively , these cells could play a role in the local trophic control of myelination .
to confirm the link between gpr17 and the oligodendroglial lineage , highly ramified gpr17 + precursors specifically expressing markers identifying different stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation are also present in primary cultures obtained from cortical parenchyma .
in a similar way to what observed in vivo , under control conditions , these cells are not positive for either stem cell , neuronal or glial markers , and very few of them express mbp , a marker of mature oligodendroglia .
this suggests that gpr17 expression is specifically segregated to the early stages of the oligodendrocyte differentiating pathway , and that the receptor is turned down when these cells reach functional maturation ( in this respect , see also below ) .
in vivo , gpr17 is also present in both cells of the ependymal layer and in a subset of subependymal precursor cells of the lateral ventricles , one of the classical neurogenic areas that are still active in the adult brain .
again , none of these cells express either gfap , nestin or dcx , suggesting that they are not " classical " multipotent neurogenic cells or neuronal precursors ; moreover , in a similar way to the parenchymal gpr17 + precursor cells , they did not incorporate brdu ( at least under the experimental conditions utilized here ) .
these cells may thus represent an additional yet - uncharacterized population of quiescent ( or very slowly proliferating ) precursors , or may be postmitotic svz - derived progenitors progressing along the oligodendroglial differentiation pathway .
a similar population of ramified gpr17 + cells was also found in the hippocampus , another neurogenic area present in the adult brain .
to verify if gpr17 in oligodendrocytes precursors is indeed functional and could play a role in driving differentiation to mature myelinating cells , primary cortical cultures were treated in vitro with udp - glucose , one of the endogenous agonists of gpr17 [ 11 ] .
exposure to this agonist for 72 h resulted in an approximately 3 - fold increase of the number of mature mbp + cells .
to confirm the specificity of these effects , we demonstrated that the p2y receptor antagonist cangrelor ( that was previously demonstrated to contrast gpr17 activation both in vitro and in vivo [ 11 ] , the present study ) , partially counteracted udp - glucose induced changes .
ltd4 , which also acts as an agonist at gpr17 ([ 11 ] ; the present study ) , induced similar effects , suggesting that activation of gpr17 on oligodendrocyte precursors by its endogenous agonists promotes progression along their differentiation pathway .
in treated cultures , the total number of cells was not increased , to suggest that activation of gpr17 is actually inducing the maturation of already existing precursors .
no synergistic nor additive effects were noticed when both agonists were combined together .
however , since maximal concentrations of both udp - glucose and ltd4 were used in this study , the plateau response may have been already achieved with the single agonist concentration , or the receptor may have undergone agonist - induced desensitization , a typical feature of gpcrs [ 30 ] .
future studies employing combinations of different agonist concentrations will clarify this aspect .
in line with these in vitro findings , application of a brain injury in vivo , such as induction of focal cerebral ischemia , promotes the activation of quiescent gpr17 + oligodendrocyte precursors that start proliferating in the parenchyma around the injured area .
in the lesioned brain , some of these cells also start expressing more mature myelination markers such as apc , that are never expressed by quiescent gpr17 + precursors in the intact telencephalon ( see also below ) .
upon brain ischemia , gpr17 is induced in several embryonically different cells that participate to damage evolution and repair we finally looked at the expression pattern of gpr17 in mice after induction of mcao .
we provide evidence that : upon ischemia induction , there is an early , time - dependent up - regulation of gpr17 in neuronal cells both within and at the borders of the injured area .
numerous neurons over - expressing gpr17 are already evident inside the lesioned area 24 hours after mcao .
several of these neurons co - localize with inducible hsp70 , a marker of cellular stress , injury and death , suggesting a causal link between gpr17 up - regulation and neuronal death .
to confirm this potential link , at 48 hours , gpr17 + neurons are no longer present inside the lesion suggesting that they have indeed undergone death .
to further confirm a causative role of the receptor in induction of cell death inside the ischemic core , the in vivo knock down of gpr17 by either a pharmacological or a biotechnological approach markedly reduced the ischemic infarct volume ( figure 7 ) .
starting from 48 - 72 hours after mcao , at the borders of the lesioned area , we found many gpr17 + cells that also strongly stained for ib4 , a marker of activated microglia / macrophages .
as expected , no ib4 + cells are found in the intact cortex , where all microglia was present in its " resting " form ( figure 2k ) .
one week after mcao , these cells are detected in high amount inside the ischemic lesion ( data not shown ) .
this pattern of ib4 positivity indeed reproduces the typical distribution of infiltrating cells in the ischemic brain [ 31 ] .
it is not possible to establish whether these infiltrating cells are microglia or blood - borne macrophages or both , since under these experimental conditions both types of cells are positive to the same surface and endocellular markers ( such as ib4 ) .
gpr17 immunoreactivity in these cells is not due to phagocytosis of gpr17 over - expressing neurons by microglia / macrophages , since none of these cells expresses typical neuronal markers such as snap25 [ 32 ] .
starting from 72 hours after mcao , the number of ramified gpr17 + oligodendrocyte precursor cells is also significantly increased both around the injured area and in the corpus striatum .
these data are in line with previous literature data demonstrating that , in a similar way to neurons , oligodendrocytes are very vulnerable to brain damage in vivo and proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells is detected after ischemia around the lesioned area [ 33 ] , likely as a response to demyelination .
activation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells may contribute to the replenishment of oligodendrocytes and subsequent remyelination in the peri - injury area .
in line with this hypothesis , at variance from the intact telencephalon , in ischemic animals , some of the gpr17 + parenchymal precursors also expressed typical mature oligodendroglia markers such as mbp ( data not shown ) and apc , to suggest that , upon damage , quiescent precursors are activated and start progressing along their differentiation pathway. of course , in future experiments , it will be interesting to verify if , at later times after ischemia , these activated pre - oligodendrocytes start myelinating , thus actually supporting repair of demyelinated lesions .
in line with previous data demonstrating that ischemic insults activate precursor cells in classic neurogenic areas [ 25 ] , many brdu +/ dcx + cells were found in the svz of lesioned mice .
however , none of these proliferating cells expresses gpr17 , indicating a differential behaviour / regulation of gpr17 + precursors in brain parenchyma and in adult neurogenic areas .
based on the demonstration that gpr17 is specifically activated by uracil nucleotides and cyslts ( e.g. , udp - glucose and ltd4 [ 11 ] and the present paper ) , and that , as a result of cell damage and death , massive release of nucleotides and cyslts occurs in the injured area [ 9 ] we propose this differential behaviour be due to the fact that only gpr17 + precursor cells in the parenchyma have access to and can be activated by their endogenous ligand under these conditions .
conclusion in summary , our study reveals the new cyslt / uracil nucleotide receptor gpr17 as a " sensor " that is activated upon brain injury in several embryonically distinct cell types ( neurons , microglia and adult neural precursor cells ) that contribute to damage evolution and to the subsequent remodeling and repair .
these findings are consistent with the emerging role played by endogenous cyslts and nucleotides in the injured brain , when these molecules are released from damaged cells , rapidly diffuse in the extracellular environment and act as " danger signals " to alert responses to damage and start repair by ligating specific plasma membrane receptors on target cells .
our unpublished data demonstrate that gpr17 plays a similar role in other models of central nervous system neurodegenerative disease such as spinal cord injury , alzheimer 's disease and multiple sclerosis ( manuscripts in preparation ) ; thus , gpr17 may represents a sensor of local injury that is activated upon different kinds of lesions independently of the cause at the basis of damage .
initial up - regulation of gpr17 in neurons is followed by a second wave of receptor induction in microglial / macrophages recruited from distal parenchymal areas and moving towards the lesioned zone .
our study also reveals gpr17 as an important player in oligodendrocyte differentiation .
at variance from other oligodendrogenic determinants , gpr17 is a membrane receptor that can be easily and immediately activated at the site of injury by its endogenous ligands to start remyelination .
in addition , pharmacological strategies aiming to activate this receptor on pre - oligodendrocytes via small brain - permeable molecules may also directly contribute to implement intrinsic repair in post - ischemic regeneration as well as in demyelinating neurodegenerative conditions such as multiple sclerosis .

animals and treatments male cd1 mice ( charles river , calco , italy ) weighing 20 - 25 g , after intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine ( 0.1 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( 0.02 mg / kg ) , underwent permanent mcao , as previously described [ 35 ] .
drug treatments were as follows : cangrelor ( a single dose of 1.125 microg / animal in 4 microl of saline , a kind gift from the medicines company , parsippany , nj , usa ) was administered intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v. ) in the contralateral hemisphere , 20 min after mcao ; anti - sense oligonucleotide 616 and corresponding scrambled oligonucleotide ( 10 microg / animal , i.c.v. , in 4 microl of saline ) were administered twice in the contralateral hemisphere , 20 min and 24 h after mcao .
all i.c.v. administrations were performed 1 mm lateral to the middle line , 0.45 mm caudal to bregma , and 2.25 mm depth .
bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ; 50 mg / kg i.p. , sigma - aldrich ) was given by a single injection in intact mice to evaluate the proliferative activity of gpr17 + cells or twice daily for 3 days from 3 hours after mcao .
the animals were then euthanized 1 day , 2 , or 3 days after the last injection .
this study on animals has been approved by the council of the department of pharmacological sciences of the university of milan , italy , which is legally entitled for the use of animals for scientific proposes ( d.m. of italian ministry of health , authorization # 124 / 2003 of 13 / 10 / 2003 and # 143 / 2004 of 13 / 12 / 2004 ) , which is , in turn , based on the d.l. of 27 january 1992 nr. 116. implementation of european union directive nr. 86 / 609 / cee regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes .
mri analysis of ischemic damage development brain infarct size was visualized by mri measurements taken 2 , 24 and 48 h after mcao using a 4.7 t , vertical super wide bore magnet of a burker avance ii spectrometer with micro imaging accessory .
animals were anesthetized with 1.5 % isofluorane in 70 % n2 30 % o2 , fixed on the holder and placed into the 3.8 cm diameter birdcage coil .
a 3 - orthogonal - plane , gradient echo scout acted as a geometric reference for locating the olfactory bulb ; then , caudally , 12 contiguous coronal dw slices were acquired .
the field of view was 2.56x1.6 cm2 , the in plane resolution was 200x200 microm2 and the slice thickness was 800 microm in all the images .
spin echo dw images were acquired with 40 ms echo time and 1.5 s repetition time .
diffusion weighting was obtained by two 10 ms long and 25 ms spaced gradients resulting in a b value of about 900 s / mm2 .
trace of diffusion tensor map computation , ischemic volume determination and progression of the ischemic damage over time were as described [ 36 ] .
western blot analysis total protein extracts were obtained by tissue homogenization in 4 mm hepes buffer , ph 7.3 , containing 250 mm sucrose and protease inhibitors .
the homogenate was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4degreesc , and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 200000 g for 1 h at 4degreesc to generate membrane and cytosolic fractions .
the protein concentration was estimated by the bradford procedure ( bio - rad laboratories ) .
equal amounts of protein from plasma - membranes and cytosolic fractions ( 30 microg ) were loaded on 10 % sds - page and blotted on nitrocellulose paper ( invitrogen ) .
nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti - gpr17 polyclonal antibody ( 1:1000 ) for 2 h at rt. specific signals were detected using the ecl immunoblotting detection system ( amersham life science ) .
immunohistochemistry , confocal and fluorescence microscopy gpr17 expression pattern was evaluated and confirmed on paraffin - embedded , frozen and floating brain sections .
for paraffin embedding , the removed brains were fixed in carnoy reagent , embedded in paraplast ( sigma - aldrich ) , and 8 microm coronal sections were processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described [ 11 ] .
for frozen and floating sections , the animals have been perfused with with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.01 m pbs and then incubated for 24 hours in a solution of 30 % sucrose , embedded in oct ( cell path ) and then frozen at - 80degreesc .
after perfusion and brain cryoprotection , 14 microm frozen sections or 30 microm floating sections were cut with a microtome or a vibratome , respectively , and treated as in [ 16 ] .
double labeling of brain sections was performed using the rabbit anti - gpr17 polyclonal antibody ( 1:100 ) generated as previously described [ 11 ] in combination with the selected primary antibody , in pbs 0.01 m , 0.1 % triton x - 100 .
for co - localization studies , the following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used : anti - smi311 ( 1:300 , sternberger monoclonal inc. ) , anti - neun ( 1:300 , chemicon ) , anti - gfap ( 1:600 , cell signalling ) , anti - s100beta ( 1:1000 , sigma - aldrich ) , anti - cnpase ( 1:100 , chemicon ) , anti - mag ( 1:500 , chemicon ) , anti - nestin ( 1:200 , chemicon ) , anti - hsp70 ( 1:3000 , sigma - aldrich ) , anti - apc cc - 1 clone ( 1:50 , calbiochem ) .
in addition , the rat monoclonal anti - myelin basic protein ( mbp ; 1:200 , chemicon ) and anti bromodeoxyuridine ( 1:150 , abcam ) were used .
double labelings with the rabbit anti - olig2 ( 1:800 , chemicon ) , anti - ng2 ( 1:200 , chemicon ) , doublecortin ( dcx ; 1:100 , cell signalling ) , anti - iba1 ( 1:1000 , wako chemicals , neuss , germany ) , and with isolectin b4 ( ib4 ) hrp - conjugated ( 1:100 , sigma - aldrich ) were also performed .
when co - staining with primary antibodies developed in the same species , gpr17 was detected with the high sensitivity tyramide signal amplification kit ( perkin elmer ) .
double labeling with anti - ng2 was performed using detergent free buffers .
for detection , goat anti - rabbit alexafluor 555 ( 1:500 ) , goat anti - rat alexafluor 555 ( 1:500 ) , goat anti - mouse alexafluor 488 ( 1:600 , all from molecular probes ) or goat fitc - conjugated anti - hrp ( 1:100 , jackson immunoresearch ) were used .
in selected experiments an additional step with the uv fluorescent dye hoechst 33258 ( 1:50000 , molecular probes ) for the nuclei labeling was performed .
immunocytochemistry immunofluorescence analysis of cortical cultures was performed as previously described [ 37 ] .
double immunostaining was performed incubating fixed cultures with anti - gpr17 polyclonal antibody ( 1:150 , 2.5 h at room temperature ) [ 11 ] and one of the following primary antibodies : mouse anti - beta - tubulin - iii ( beta - tubiii ; 1:100 ) , mouse anti - nestin ( 1:100 ) , mouse anti - cnpase ( 1:100 ) , rat anti - mbp ( 1:200 ) , mouse anti - o4 ( 1:100 , all from chemicon ) , mouse anti - ng2 ( 1:200 , abcam ) , mouse anti - map2 ( 1:500 , immunological sciences ) , and mouse anti - gfap ( 1:500 , cell signalling ) .
cells were then incubated for 1 h at rt with the secondary goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse antibodies , conjugated to alexafluor 488 or alexafluor 555 ( 1:600 , molecular probes ) .
coverslips were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium ( dako ) , and analyzed by using an inverted fluorescence microscope ( 200 m ; zeiss ) equipped with a ccd camera ( axiocam hrm ; zeiss ) , connected to a pc equipped with the axiovision software ( zeiss ) .
propidium iodide ( pi ) staining to evaluate the viability of in vitro cell cultures , after pharmacological treatments , cultures were loaded with 20 microm pi for 10 min .
under these conditions , pi can only enter cells with damaged permeabilized membrane and cannot label nuclei of intact viable cells .
cultures were then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde plus 4 % sucrose , and loaded with the nuclear dye hoechst 33258 .
nuclei were analyzed and counted using a fluorescence microscope ( zeiss ) .
since hoechst 33258 gives a blue colour to nuclei under uv light , cells that remained alive during the pharmacological treatments showed blue nuclei with rounded appearance ; conversely , cells that underwent cell death showed a red colour due to the incorporation of both dyes and were classified as dead .
data are presented as percentage of propidium iodide - positive nuclei over hoechst 33258 - labeled nuclei .
data analysis for [ 35s ] gtpgammas binding data analysis and graphic presentation , a non - linear multipurpose curve - fitting program graph - pad prism was used and the ec50 values were derived .
data are reported as mean +/ - sem of three different experiments ( performed in duplicate ) .
for mri studies , data on progression of ischemic damage over time were evaluated by anova for repeated measures .
for each animal , the ischemic area at 2 h after ischemia induction was set to 100 % , and the extension of the ischemic area at all other time points was proportionally calculated , thus providing an internal control of ischemia development .
then , variations of ischemic volumes between animals and groups were compared .
six animals / group were used .
data are expressed as mean values +/ - s.em. p values <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
quantifications of immunoreactive cells were performed by fluorescence microscopy blindly in coronal sections of three intact and three lesioned hemispheres .
cells were counted using a 20x objective on an inverted fluorescence microscope ( 200 m ; zeiss ) .
depending on the experiment and on the parameters to be estimated , at least 700 cells / condition were counted .

figure s3 potential olig2 binding sites upstream of the gpr17 coding sequence .
sequence alignments of 8 kb upstream to the coding sequence of the human , rat and mouse gpr17 gene have been performed using blast program from ncbi ( http :// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) .
identification of responsive sites for neurogenin and neurod family of transcription factors ( such as atoh1 , neurod1 , neurod2 , neurod4 , neurod6 , neurog1 , neurog2 , neurog3 , tgf12 and tgf3 and olig2 ) in the upstream sequences of gpr17 ( human , rat and mouse ) was performed by using matinspector release professional 7.7.3 software from genomatix .
gpr17 upstream sequences globally display a low homology rate in the three species , except in six regions which are highly homologous and conserved among phylogenesis .
here we show only the two of them ( e - box 1 and e - box 2 ) in which the e - box element , potentially able to bind olig2 , is identical in human , mouse and rat .

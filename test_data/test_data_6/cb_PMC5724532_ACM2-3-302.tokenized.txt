the american association of physicists in medicine task group 36 ( aapm tg - 36 ) data can be used to estimate peripheral dose ( pd ) distributions outside the primary radiation field .
however , the report data does not apply to linear accelerators equipped with a multileaf collimator ( mlc ) and universal wedge ( uw ) .
tertiary multileaf collimators have been shown to significantly affect pd distributions and tg - 36 reported data .
measurements were performed to evaluate pd distributions for a linear accelerator equipped with a secondary mlc , backup diaphragms , and uw. this data can be used to compliment the tg - 36 report for estimation of doses to critical structures outside primary radiation fields .
for the evaluated linear accelerator , an mlc is incorporated in the upper secondary collimator jaws .
backup shielding diaphragms are located underneath the mlc .
at the nominal collimator position , the mlc and the backup diaphragm provide collimation primarily in the transverse direction .
conventional , solid tungsten - alloy jaws , located underneath the backup diaphragms , provide secondary collimation in the longitudinal direction .
the universal wedge provides dose modulation in the direction of the conventional jaws .
measurements were made with an ionization chamber inserted into a 20x40x120cm3 water - equivalent plastic phantom with the secondary collimator and mlc settings of 5x5,10x10,15x15 , and 25x25cm2 with and without uw. data was acquired along the machine 's longitudinal axis for 6 , 10 , and 18 mv photons .
peripheral dose distributions were measured with the collimator rotated to 0degrees and 270degrees for open field measurements and to 0degrees , 180degrees , and 270degrees for wedged fields ( iec 1217 ) .
this allowed evaluation of peripheral dose distributions as a function of collimator rotation .
wedged fields were normalized to deliver the same dose at the depth of maximum dose on the central axis as open fields .
the measured pd distributions were generally comparable to data reported by tg - 36 .
at distances close to the field edge ( less than 30 or 40 cm ) , the measured pd distributions were lower when the measurement point was shielded by solid jaws than with mlc and backup diaphragm .
at longer distances , this trend reversed for all energies and evaluated field sizes .
however , the difference in pd distribution with collimator rotation was not large enough to warrant strategic positioning of the collimator to reduce dose to critical structures outside the primary radiation field .
because internal scatter dominates close to the field edge , wedged pd distributions were comparable to open field doses at distances closer than 30 cm. however , at distances larger than 30 cm from the field edge , wedged pd distributions were significantly grater than those for open fields due to increased contribution of leakage radiation .
increased leakage radiation is due to the increase in wedged field monitor units , which is related to a small wedge factor ( 0.27 to 0.29 ) .

the american association of physicists in medicine task group 36 ( aapm tg - 36 ) data 2 can be used to estimate peripheral dose ( pd ) distributions for various treatments and to determine the need for additional shielding .
however , the report data were obtained on linear accelerators without multileaf collimator ( mlc ) and universal wedge ( uw ) .
peripheral dose distributions consist of internal scatter , collimation scatter , transmission through collimation , head leakage , and room scatter .
the use of a tertiary mlc has been shown to significantly reduce pd due to a reduction in scatter from the primary and secondary collimator , transmission through the secondary collimator , and head leakage .
1 similarly , a linear accelerator equipped with a secondary multileaf collimation and backup shielding diaphragms and uw can produce pd distributions substantially different from those reported by tg - 36 .
this paper reports peripheral dose distributions for such a linear accelerator .
the measured dose distributions can be used to compliment the tg - 36 report data for estimation of doses to critical structures outside primary radiation fields .
methods and materials the measurements were performed on a multimodality linear accelerator ( elekta precise , elekta norcross , ga ) equipped with an mlc and universal wedge .
the machine delivers photons with nominal energies of 6 , 10 , and 18 mv. the mlc design and performance characteristics have been described by jordan and williams .
3 the mlc replaces the upper secondary collimator jaw on a conventional linear accelerator and is complemented by backup diaphragms which are located underneath the mlc .
the lower secondary collimation consists of two opposing solid - tungsten - alloy jaws and is located inferior to the backup diaphragms .
at the nominal collimator and treatment table position of 0degrees ( iec 1217 ) , 4 the mlc is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of a patient lying on the table .
figure 1 shows a simplified schematic of the gantry head , in nominal position , in relationship to a patient on the treatment table .
in this situation , the majority of the patient 's anatomy outside the primary radiation field is shielded by the lower secondary jaws and partially by the outermost mlcs .
when the collimator is rotated by 90degrees in either direction , the patient is primarily protected by mlcs and backup diaphragms .
the uw is a motorized wedge filter that can be positioned in or out of the radiation beam and is located above the mlc ( fig. 1 ) and provides dose modulation in the direction orthogonal to mlc orientation .
the filter is nominally a 60degrees wedge , and other wedge angles are obtained by a combination of open and wedged fields .
5 the maximum field size in the wedged direction is 30 cm. with the collimator at the nominal 0degrees position , the wedge " heel " is located away from the gantry .
figure 1 simplified side view of the gantry head with the collimator at 0degrees in relationship to the patient lying on the treatment table .
when retracted , the mlc collimator is lateral to the patient .
peripheral dose measurements were performed using a 0.6 cm3 farmer - type ionization chamber ( ptw n23333 , friedberg , germany ) inserted into a 20x40x120cm3 water - equivalent plastic phantom ( solid water model 457 , gammex / rmi , milwaukee , wi ) and connected to a calibrated electrometer ( keithley model 602 , cnmc , nashville , tn. ) .
for all measurements , the ionization chamber was placed at the level of isocenter plane at a depth of 10.0 cm in the phantom ( midplane ) .
due to small pd depth dependence , 1 , 2 , 5 - 7 pd distributions were evaluated only at that depth .
the number of monitor units was adjusted to maintain the ionization reading precision at 1 % .
uncertainty in the measured dose due to positional inaccuracy was not considered .
due to the slope of the pd distribution curve , uncertainty due to spatial inaccuracy was greatest at points close to the radiation field and became negligible at points far from the field edge ( greater than approximately 40 cm ) .
positional inaccuracy was within 2 mm. the output of the linear accelerator was monitored at the beginning and end of each measurement session and was constant within 1 % .
the long dimension of the phantom placed on the treatment table corresponded to the superior - inferior axis of a patient lying on the treatment table .
data were taken at distances up to 70 cm away from the primary radiation field edge .
for all measurements , both the treatment table and gantry were placed at 0degrees ( iec 1217 ) .
data were acquired for 6 , 10 , and 18 mv photons .
these measurements did not account for dose contributions from photoneutrons .
as previously discussed 1 and pointed out in the tg - 36 report , the contribution of neutrons to the total pd is small near the beam edge .
at further distances , the total pd is smaller , but the fractional contribution from the photoneutrons can be high .
2 , 8 the national council on radiation protection 9 considers the risk of long - term biological effects of incidental neutrons from the linear accelerator to be negligible .
peripheral dose measurements were made for open and wedged fields .
mcparland 5 has shown that pd distributions can be significantly affected by the uw. peripheral dose distributions for open fields were evaluated for 5x5,15x15 , and 25x25cm2 secondary collimator and mlc setting and for 0degrees and 270degrees collimator rotation .
for 0degrees setting , measurement points were shielded by the lower secondary collimator jaws and the outermost mlc leafs ( fig. 1 ) .
mlc and backup diaphragms provided shielding for 270degrees collimator setting .
collimator rotation has been shown to considerably affect pd distributions .
1 , 5 - 6 for 60degrees wedged fields , pd distributions were evaluated for 5x5,10x10 , and 15x15cm2 for 0degrees , 180degrees , and 270degrees collimator rotation ( 270degrees measurements were not acquired for the 10x10cm2 setting ) .
for the 0degrees setting , measurement points were inferior to the wedge " heel. " at 180degrees rotation , the wedge " toe " is located superior to measurement points. with the 270degrees rotation , measurement points are aligned in the nonwedged direction .
the uw has a relatively small wedge factor , which typically ranges from approximately 0.27 to 0.29 as function of beam energy , field size , and depth .
the small wedge factor requires a significant increase in monitor units to deliver the same dose on central axis as open fields .
leakage radiation is proportional to monitor units used for treatment delivery .
therefore , it is expected that wedged fields , delivering the same dose on central axis as open fields , will have peripheral doses approximately four times larger than equivalent open fields .
all measured pd distributions were normalized to 100 % on the central axis at the depth of maximum dose .
results figures 2 , 3 , and 4 show peripheral dose distributions for 6 , 10 , and 18 mv photon beams .
each figure contains data for 5x5,10x10,15x15 , and 25x25cm2 fields .
all data points have 5 % error bars applied .
due to marker size and small error magnitude , error bars are predominantly masked within individual markers .
curves with open circles represent data for open fields with 0degrees collimator rotation. with this collimator rotation , mlcs and backup diaphragms are lateral to measurement points and these points are predominantly shielded with lower secondary , solid - tungsten - alloy jaws .
closed circle curves represent open field data with the collimator at 270degrees rotation .
data reported for this collimator rotation represents pd distributions under upper secondary jaws ( mlcs ) and backup diaphragms .
all of the open field curves are generally comparable with tg - 36 report data for all three photon energies .
collimator rotation results in a relatively small difference in pd distributions , and there does not seem to be a clear advantage of positioning the collimator to a certain setting to reduce pd. open squares represent data for wedged fields with the collimator at 0degrees .
for this setting , measurement points were inferior to the wedge " heel. " closed squares represent pd data under wedge in the nonwedged direction with the collimator at the 270degrees setting .
crossed open squares represent pd distributions inferior to the wedge " toe " with the collimator at 180degrees .
an analysis of these three sets of curves shows that universal wedge pd distributions are a function of collimator rotation , which was also reported by mcparland .
5 for 5x5cm2 wedged data there is a significant difference between " heel " and " toe " pd distributions .
the separation of curves occurs approximately 20 to 30 cm from the field edge .
this increase in dose was also observed by mcparland .
5 the difference between " heel " and " toe " pd distributions decreases with increase in field size .
for a 10x10cm2 field , a small difference is still present and it almost completely dissipates for 15x15cm2 field size .
again , a similar trend was observed by mcparland .
5 peripheral dose distributions for wedged fields in the nonwedged direction are similar in shape to open field distributions but higher in magnitude .
as described earlier , wedged fields were normalized to deliver the same dose at the depth of maximum dose on central axis as open fields .
due to the small wedge factor , this required mus for wedged fields to be almost four times larger than for equivalent open fields .
the leakage radiation component of pd distributions is proportional to mus .
therefore , it is expected that wedged pd distributions will be higher in magnitude than for open fields .
for distances closer than 30 cm from field edge , where internal scatter radiation dominates , wedged pd distributions are comparable in magnitude with open field distributions .
at larger distances from the field edge , where leakage radiation dominates , wedged field pd distributions become larger in magnitude approaching the ratio of monitor units required to deliver the same dose with wedged and open fields .
as already described , less than 60degrees wedged distributions are delivered as a combination of open field and 60degrees wedged fields .
for these fields , the effective pd is calculated as a summation of open field and wedged field contributions according to their respective weights .
the effective pd will be between open and wedged field distributions presented in figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 .

discussion peripheral dose distributions from a linear accelerator can significantly affect treatment techniques of patients with radiosensitive critical structures , which need to be protected .
premeasured pd distributions can be used in the planning of radiation therapy treatments for such patients and to determine the need for additional shielding .
2 the aapm tg - 36 data is often used in these situations .
however , tg - 36 data is not necessarily appropriate for linear accelerators equipped with mlcs 1 and special measurements are needed to evaluate pd distributions from these treatment machines .
this paper has presented pd distributions for an elekta precise linear accelerator equipped with mlc and uw. this data can be used to complement tg - 36 recommendations .
in addition to tg - 36 type data , the data presented here also provides pd distributions as a function of collimator rotation and distributions for universal wedge fields .
figure 3 peripheral dose in phantom from 10 mv photons for field sizes ( a ) 5x5cm2 , ( b ) 10x10cm2 ; ( c ) 15x15cm2 ; and ( d ) 25x25cm2 at 10 cm depth , normalized to 100 % on the central axis at depth of maximum dose ( 2.5 cm ) .

the measured data showed that mlc incorporated in the upper secondary collimator with backup diaphragms provide approximately the same amount of shielding as the lower solid - tungsten - alloy jaws .
the pd distributions for open fields for two collimator rotations are comparable and there does not seem to be a clear advantage in positioning the collimator to a certain setting to reduce dose to critical structures outside the primary radiation field .
another important observation from measured data is the magnitude of wedge field pd distributions in comparison to open field .
the ratio of monitor units required to deliver the same dose at the depth of maximum dose on central axis with uw fields and open fields is almost 4 .
intuitively , it would be expected that wedged pd distributions would be approximately four times larger than open field distributions due to an increase in leakage radiation which is related to increased mus .
furthermore , it is expected that these differences would be observed at longer distances from the field edge , where the leakage radiation dominates .
2 data presented here supports this expectation .
wedged pd distributions are comparable to open field distributions at distances less than 30 cm from the field edge , and become almost four times greater at longer distances .
this is due to approximately equivalent internal scatter contribution for open and wedged fields .
also , the wedge provides additional shielding for collimator scatter and leakage radiation in comparison to open fields .
the effect of this shielding is largest underneath the wedge and close to the field edge and eventually becomes smaller at distances far from the field edge .
this is important information when designing treatments for patients with radiosensitive structures ( pacemaker , defibrillator , gonads , fetus , etc. ) which need to be protected .
the data presented here demonstrates that the use of uw with a small wedge factor is not necessarily contraindicated for the treatment of these patients .
the dose to critical structures located near the field edge may be comparable to open field doses .
however , the whole body dose will be higher for uw fields .

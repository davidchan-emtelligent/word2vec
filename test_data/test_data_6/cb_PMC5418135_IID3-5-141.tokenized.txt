abstract introduction the bet family of bromodomain - containing proteins constitute epigenetic readers that bind to acetylated lysine residues of core histones , thereby translating epigenetic histone marks to effects on gene expression .
bet inhibitors are currently emerging as promising therapeutic agents for treatment of various pathological conditions .
here , we explored the potential of using bet inhibition to modulate ige - mediated responses in mast cells .
methods we assessed the effects of bet inhibitors pfi - 1 , i - bet151 , and i - bet762 on responses downstream of mast cell activation through ige receptor cross - linking .
results bet inhibitors were neither toxic for mast cells ( at doses up to 20 mum ) , nor did they prevent ige - mediated mast cell degranulation .
however , we found that bet inhibition , in particular by i - bet151 , suppressed il - 6 gene expression and il - 6 protein release in response to ige - mediated mast cell activation .
this was observed in both bone marrow - derived mast cells ( bmmcs ) and in mature peritoneal - cell derived mast cells .
further analysis showed that bet inhibition also suppressed the expression of a number of additional genes of those that were upregulated by ige receptor cross - linking , including il - 3 , il - 7r , ccr1 , and adamts9 .
however , bet inhibition was selective , i.e. , several genes that were upregulated by ige receptor cross - linking were not affected by bet inhibitors .
conclusions these findings suggest that bet inhibition can interfere with the upregulated expression of selected genes in mast cells activated by ige receptor cross - linking .
further , our findings introduce the concept of utilizing epigenetic mechanisms for modulating mast cell function in the context of ige - driven disease .

introduction mast cells are well known for their detrimental impact on allergic disease , but are also important players in a range of additional pathologies 1 .
the classical mode of mast cell activation , most notably in the context of allergic reactions , is through binding of multivalent antigen to ige molecules bound to the high affinity ige receptor , fcepsilonri , on the mast cell surface .
the ensuing ige receptor cross - linking will lead to extensive release of preformed mediators from granular stores , that is degranulation , but ige - mediated activation also results in the synthesis of numerous lipid - derived pro - inflammatory mediators and expression of a panel of genes coding for pro - inflammatory compounds 2 , 3 .
these latter include genes coding for cytokines , chemokines , and various growth factors 3 .
altogether , mast cell activation through ige receptor cross - linking will thus lead to the release of a wide array of pro - inflammatory compounds , which collectively gives rise to a powerful inflammatory reaction .
based on the powerful impact of mast cells on allergic and other pathological conditions , there is a great demand for therapeutic strategies that can counteract harmful mast cell activities .
such strategies include the use of various mast cell stabilizers and anti - ige therapy to prevent mast cell degranulation , as well as antagonists to the individual mediators that are released following mast cell degranulation 4 .
however , there is also need for strategies that can interfere with gene expression patterns that are induced upon ige - mediated mast cell activation .
histone modification by various mechanisms , including lysine acetylation , methylation , phosphorylation , and sumoylation is now established as a major epigenetic mechanism with wide consequences for gene expression 5 , 6 .
the bromodomain and extraterminal domain ( bet ) family of bromodomain proteins bind specifically to acetylated lysine residues in core histones , thereby transmitting the signal imposed by histone acetylation into effects on gene expression 7 .
based on this principle , inhibitors of bet proteins have been developed to provide a novel means of directly modulating effects on gene expression .
such inhibitors have subsequently been evaluated in diverse settings and are currently regarded as promising therapeutic agents in various pathological conditions , including cancer , sepsis , and autoimmunity 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 .
however , the possibility of using bet inhibitors for modulating mast cell - mediated events has hitherto not been explored .
here , we investigated the effect of bet inhibition on mast cell function .
our findings identify bet inhibition as a novel means of modulating the expression of selected genes in response to ige - mediated mast cell activation .
hence , the use of bet inhibitors could represent a new strategy to directly interfere with gene expression patterns in pathological settings where mast cells are involved .

bet inhibition does not affect ige - mediated mast cell degranulation next , we assessed whether bet inhibition can interfere with mast cell degranulation in response to ige receptor cross - linking .
to this end , mast cells were pre - loaded with anti - dnp ige overnight , followed by ige cross - linking by addition of dnp - hsa , either in the presence or absence of bet inhibitors .
as seen in figure 1b , ige receptor cross - linking resulted in a robust degranulation as measured by beta - hexosaminidase release .
however , neither of the bet inhibitors used caused any detectable reduction of this response .
hence , bet inhibition does not affect ige - mediated mast cell degranulation .
bet inhibition suppresses il - 6 expression and release in response to ige receptor cross - linking earlier reports have shown that bet inhibition can suppress il - 6 expression in response to tlr4 ligation in macrophages 8 , 20 .
in order to evaluate if bet inhibitors can modulate gene expression in ige - activated mast cells , we therefore first focused on il - 6 .
as depicted in figure 2a , ige receptor cross - linking caused a strong upregulation of il - 6 gene expression .
moreover , it was seen that bet inhibition resulted in a profound reduction of this response .
in particular , i - bet151 proved to be a highly potent inhibitor of il - 6 expression .
in contrast , although tnfalpha gene expression was profoundly upregulated in response to ige receptor cross - linking in mast cells , neither of the bet inhibitors was capable of suppressing the tnfalpha induction ( fig. 2b ) .
in agreement with these data , elisa measurements showed that bet inhibition also suppressed the release of il - 6 protein in response to ige receptor cross - linking ( fig. 2c and d ) , whereas no effect on the release of tnfalpha was seen ( fig. 2e and f ) .
figure 2 bet inhibitors suppress il - 6 upregulation and release in activated bone marrow - derived mast cells ( bmmcs ) .

bet inhibition modulates il - 6 expression in peritoneal cell - derived mast cells although bmmcs are commonly used for studies of mast cell function , they are less mature than those mast cells that are found in vivo .
to test the impact of bet inhibition on fully mature mast cells , we therefore developed pcmcs 14 .
importantly , pcmcs have previously been shown to represent fully differentiated mast cells of connective tissue subtype 14 .
as for bmmcs , neither of the bet inhibitors at any of the tested concentrations showed cytotoxicity for pcmcs , when incubated for 1 h with the cells ( fig. 3a ) .
also after prolonged incubation ( 24 h ) , undetectable or only marginal cytotoxicity was seen at concentrations above 100 nm ( data not shown ) .
in agreement with the effects seen on bmmcs , bet inhibition did not affect the degranulation of pcmcs in response to ige receptor cross - linking ( fig. 3b ) .
in further accordance with the effects on bmmcs , bet inhibition suppressed the expression of il - 6 mrna in response to ige receptor cross - linking and inhibited the release of il - 6 protein in pcmcs ( fig. 3c and d ) .
it was also seen that bet inhibition down - regulated the baseline expression of il - 6 .
as for bmmcs , bet inhibitor i - bet151 was more effective than pfi - 1 and i - bet762 .
a dose response experiment showed that optimal inhibition of il - 6 gene expression was obtained at ~ 250 nm of i - bet151 ( fig. 3e ) .

bet inhibition represses the expression of selected genes that are upregulated by ige receptor cross - linking to provide a deeper insight into whether bet inhibition affects gene expression in ige - activated mast cells beyond the effects on il - 6 ( see figs. 1 and 2 ) , we performed a gene array analysis to search for additional genes affected by bet inhibitors .
to this end , we performed a gene array analysis of pcmcs activated by ige receptor cross - linking , either in the absence or presence of bet inhibitor i - bet151 .
as expected , this analysis suggested that a large number of protein - encoding genes were upregulated in response to ige receptor cross - linking ( suppl. table s1 ) .
further , the gene array data indicated that only selected genes were substantially affected by bet inhibition ( suppl. table s2 ) .
these included il - 6 , nlrp3 , il - 7r , il - 3 , ccr1 , adamts9 , il - 15 , and il - 13 .
to confirm the findings obtained through the gene array screen , we used quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) .
as shown in figure 4 , the qpcr analysis indeed revealed a robust induction of the il - 3 ( fig. 4a ) , il - 13 ( fig. 4b ) , il - 7r fig. 4d ) , csf1 ( fig. 4e ) , ccr1 ( fig. 4f ) , and adamts9 ( fig. 4h ) genes in pcmcs subjected to ige receptor cross - linking .
we also noted that nr4a3 , a gene that previously was shown to be one of the most highly induced genes in mast cells activated by various means 16 , was strongly upregulated in ige - activated pcmcs ( fig. 4g ) .
out of these genes , the expression of il - 3 , il7r ( coding for the il - 7 receptor ) , and ccr1 ( receptor for chemokines ccl3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 23 ) was suppressed by bet inhibition .
also the expression of nlrp3 ( a key inflammasome component 21 ) was suppressed by bet inhibition , although the qpcr analysis did not support upregulated nlrp3 expression after ige receptor cross - linking ( fig. 4j ) .
as for il - 6 ( see fig. 3 ) , bet inhibitor i - bet151 was more effective than the other bet inhibitors .
notably , although the qpcr analysis confirmed an upregulated expression of il - 13 , csf1 , and nr4a3 after ige receptor cross - linking , no effect of bet inhibition was seen on the expression of any of these genes .
for adamts9 ( a metalloprotease ) , a trend of suppression was seen but this did not reach statistical significance .
further , bet inhibition did not affect the expression of the il - 15 gene ( fig. 4b ) .
we also tested the effect of bet inhibition on cpa3 , a secretory granule - contained protease that serves as a major mast cell marker 2 .
cpa3 expression was not affected by ige receptor cross - linking and , moreover , there was no effect of bet inhibition on cpa3 expression ( fig. 4i ) .

to extend these observations , we additionally evaluated whether bet inhibition had an impact on the expression of the corresponding genes in bmmcs , that is in less mature mast cells .
as seen in fig. 5 , ige receptor cross - linking caused upregulation of the genes coding for il - 3 ( fig. 5a ) , il - 13 ( fig. 5b ) , csf1 ( fig. 5e ) , ccr1 ( fig. 5f ) , nr4a3 ( fig. 5g ) , adamts9 ( fig. 5h ) , and nlrp3 ( fig. 5j ) along with a trend of upregulated expression of the il - 7r gene ( fig. 5d ) , that is similar findings as for pcmcs .
however , bmmcs were generally less responsive to bet inhibition in comparison with pcmcs , with only the expression of the adamts9 ( fig. 5h ) and il - 15 ( fig. 5c ) genes being significantly repressed by any of the bet inhibitors .
however , trends of inhibition were seen for the il - 7r ( fig. 5d ) and ccr1 ( fig. 5f ) genes .
as in pcmcs , cpa3 expression was neither affected by ige receptor cross - linking , nor by bet inhibition ( fig. 5i ) .
figure 5 bet inhibition regulates gene expression in bone marrow - derived mast cells ( bmmcs ) .

discussion bet inhibitors have previously been assessed in a variety of settings and are currently emerging as promising therapeutic agents ( see introduction ) .
however , the possibility of using this type of inhibitors to intervene with mast cell functions has , to our knowledge , not been addressed before .
here , we show that gene expression in mast cells activated by ige receptor cross - linking can be modulated by inhibition of the bet proteins .
one important implication of these findings is that responses downstream of ige - mediated mast cell activation can be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms .
in line with our findings , it was recently shown that interference with brd4 , one of the bet family members can suppress growth and induce apoptosis in neoplastic mast cells 22 .
hence , modulation of bet proteins could potentially represent a novel means of modulating mast cell - mediated events in a variety of settings .
it is apparent from the present study that bet inhibitors do not interfere with mast cell degranulation .
it is therefore unlikely that bet inhibition has effects on the immediate response downstream of mast cell activation , that is events related to effects of the preformed mast cell mediators released from secretory granules .
instead , bet inhibition was shown to modulate gene expression patterns in response to ige receptor cross - linking , thus implicating bet inhibitors as possible agents to modulate events occurring in the late phase responses following mast cell activation .
however , it was noted that bet inhibition also suppressed the baseline expression of several of the assessed genes .
hence , bet - mediated regulation of gene expression in mast cells is not restricted to situations in which they are activated .
one of the main findings was that bet inhibition potently suppressed the upregulation of il - 6 , both at the gene and protein level .
this is thus in analogy with previous studies demonstrating that bet inhibitors can suppress il - 6 expression in macrophages stimulated with tlr4 ligands 8 , 20 .
based on the findings presented here , we may propose that bet inhibition can be used as a therapeutic strategy to modulate il - 6 gene expression in mast cells .
importantly , mast cell - derived il - 6 has been implicated in a variety of pathological contexts , including atherosclerosis 23 , stroke pathology 24 , arthritis 25 , th17 skewing 26 , mastocytosis 27 , and diabetes 28 .
hence , modulation of il - 6 expression by bet inhibition could have a therapeutic potential in such settings .
besides the il - 6 gene , we here identified a number of additional genes whose expression in ige - activated mast cells was affected by bet inhibition .
these included il - 3 , il - 7r , and ccr1 , all of which have established and important functions in inflammatory responses. of note , il - 3 is a potent growth factor for mast cells 29 , and the suppression of il - 3 expression by bet inhibition might thus interfere with il - 3 - driven mast cell proliferation .
potentially , reduction of mast cell numbers by inhibition of bet proteins could thus have beneficial effects under circumstances when mast cells account for aggravating activities , for example in allergic asthma and mastocytosis .
we also found that bet inhibition suppressed the expression of nlrp3 .
it is thus possible that bet inhibition could represent a novel strategy for interfering with inflammasome activity .
in addition , the expression of adamts9 , a protease that recently was identified as a mast cell signature gene 30 and to be highly upregulated by ige receptor cross - linking 13 , was suppressed in mast cells subjected to bet inhibition .
as adamts9 is implicated in connective tissue remodeling events 31 , bet inhibition could thus counteract such processes orchestrated by mast cells .
in summary , this study identifies bet inhibitors as novel agents with capacity to modulate mast cell gene expression .
importantly , the use of bet inhibition to modulate gene expression in mast cells constitutes a novel principle for intervening with mast cell function , in which gene expression is directly targeted rather than being modulated by targeting of signaling molecules that act upstream of the gene transcription apparatus .

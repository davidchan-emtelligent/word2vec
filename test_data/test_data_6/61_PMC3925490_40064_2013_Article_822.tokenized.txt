extraction of high - quality rna is a crucial step in gene expression profiling .
to achieve optimal rna extraction from frozen blood , the performance of three rna extraction kits - tri reagent , paxgene blood rna system ( paxgene ) and nucleospin rna blood kit ( nucleospin ) - was evaluated .
fifteen blood specimens collected in tubes containing potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) and stored at - 80degreesc for approximately 5 years were randomly selected .
the yield and purity of rna , rin ( rna integrity number ) values and cycle threshold ( ct ) values were assessed .
mean rna yields with tri reagent , paxgene and nucleospin were 15.6 +/ - 8.7 mug / ml , 3.1 +/ - 1.7 mug / ml and 9.0 +/ - 5.5 mug / ml , respectively .
mean a260 / 280 ratios of rna for the three kits were 1.7 +/ - 0.1 , 2.0 +/ - 0.1 , and 2.0 +/ - 0.0 , and mean rin values recorded as 3.2 +/ - 0.8 , 6.0 +/ - 1.1 , and 6.4 +/ - 0.9 , respectively .
the ct values of housekeeping genes , 18s rrna , beta - actin , rplp0 and hprt1 , were as follows : tri reagent ( 19.2 +/ - 1.6 , 30.6 +/ - 1.8 , 29.9 +/ - 1.4 and 36.3 +/ - 1.3 ) , paxgene 16.6 +/ - 1.4 , 26.4 +/ - 1.3 , 28.2 +/ - 1.8 and 33.8 +/ - 1.1 ) , and nucleospin ( 16.3 +/ - 1.5 , 27.2 +/ - 1.3 , 27.0 +/ - 1.6 and 32.9 +/ - 1.6 ) .
rna yield using tri reagent was 1.7 times higher than that with nucleospin and 5 times higher than that with paxgene .
however , the purity and integrity of tri - extracted rna was lower than that extracted with paxgene and nucleospin .
moreover , the ct values of housekeeping genes after extraction with tri reagent were approximately 1.7 - 3.8 times higher than those obtained with paxgene and nucleospin .
the paxgene and nucleospin kits produced similar results in terms of rna purity and integrity and subsequent gene amplification .
however , rna yields from nucleospin were 2.9 - fold higher , compared to paxgene .
based on these findings , we conclude that nucleospin is the most effective kit for extraction of abundant and high - quality rna from frozen blood .
keywords frozen blood rna extraction rt - qpcr issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background human blood specimens are routinely collected by biobanks for medical applications , scientific research , and diagnostic purposes ( elliott and peakman 2008 ; jackson and banks 2010 ; hebels et al. 2013 ) .
blood specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants are usually processed to produce aliquots of whole blood , serum , plasma , or buffy coats , which are stored at - 80degreesc for future use .
frozen blood samples stored in biobanks are increasingly considered valuable sources of rna for profiling gene expression ( barnes et al. 2010 ) .
however , a major limitation of studies using rna isolated from frozen blood samples is rna degradation during blood collection and storage .
to minimize the degradation of rna and changes in gene expression patterns , improved alternatives for collecting human blood specimens have been developed ( chai et al. 2005 ) .
for instance , paxgene blood rna tubes ( paxgene , preaanlytix , hombrechtikon , switzerland ) containing rna stabilizing reagents are used to collect and store blood samples prior to rna isolation .
despite the availability of an rna stabilization system , there may be a need to perform rna expression profiling experiments with legacy blood samples initially collected using common blood collection tubes ( e.g. edta tubes ) ( chai et al. 2005 ; thorn et al. 2005 ) .
recently , beekman and co - workers proposed an effective way of extracting rna from frozen blood samples collected using edta tubes .
thawed blood is transferred to paxgene blood rna tubes , and rna obtained using the paxgene rna extraction kit .
this transfer method yields abundant rna of sufficient quality for gene expression analysis ( beekman et al. 2009 ) .
the most common rna extraction kits for frozen blood are based on the use of an acid guanidinium thiocyanate - phenol - chloroform extraction reagent .
the tri reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) is based on this technology and rapidly inhibits rnase activity , making it a complete , ready - to - use reagent for total rna extraction ( kang et al. 2011 ; jakovljevic et al. 2010 ) .
another product , the nucleospin rna blood kit ( nucleospin , macherey - nagel , duren , germany ) , facilitates extraction of rna from blood samples collected in edta blood collection tubes .
in the current study , three different rna extraction kits , specifically , tri reagent , paxgene , and nucleospin , were compared in terms of rna yield , purity , and integrity , with a view to achieving optimal high - quality rna extraction from frozen whole blood .
rna extracted with the three kits was additionally assessed for use in real - time pcr assays .
results and discussion the mean yields of rna isolated from 15 frozen whole blood samples with the three different kits were as follows : tri reagent , 15.6 +/ - 8.7 mug / ml ( range , 6.1 ~ 37.6 ) , paxgene , 3.1 +/ - 1.7 mug / ml ( range , 1.1 ~ 6.9 ) , and nucleospin , 9.0 +/ - 5.5 ( range , 3.6 ~ 23.7 ) mug / ml ( table 1 and figure 1a ) .
tri reagent yielded the highest quantity , generally resulting in extraction of 5.0 - fold more rna than the paxgene kit and 1.7 - fold more rna than the nucleospin kit .
however , rna extracted with tri reagent exhibited lower purity than that obtained using either paxgene or nucleospin ( table 1 and figure 1b ) .
rna absorbs uv light maximally at 260 nm and protein at 280 nm , and a260 / a280 ratios are thus used to indicate rna sample purity .
the mean rna purity ( a260 / a280 ) was evaluated as 1.7 +/ - 0.1 with tri reagent , 2.0 +/ - 0.1 with paxgene , and 2.0 +/ - 0.0 with nucleospin .
generally , samples with ratios in the range of 1.8 ~ 2.0 indicate higher levels of rna purity .
the a260 / a280 ratios for paxgene and nucleospin extractions were within the desired range , while the ratio for tri reagent was somewhat lower , indicative of protein or dna contamination with this kit .
as a secondary measurement of rna purity , a260 / a230 ratios were additionally evaluated for extracts with tri reagent ( 1.4 +/ - 0.4 ) , paxgene ( 1.1 +/ - 0.3 ) , and nucleospin ( 1.8 +/ - 0.2 ) ( table 1 and figure 1c ) .
the mean a260 / a230 ratios for rna obtained with paxgene and tri reagent were lower than that with nucleospin .
phenol , carbohydrate and salt contamination are reported to induce a decrease in the a260 / a230 ratio .
in this regard , the lower a260 / a230 values may be attributed to the high salt content of paxgene elution buffer and phenol in tri reagent .

rna integrity was assessed using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer , which provides rin scores for rna quality control .
the mean rin values were 3.2 +/ - 0.8 for tri reagent , 6.0 +/ - 1.1 for paxgene , and 6.4 +/ - 0.9 for nucleospin ( table 1 and figure 1d ) , signifying that the paxgene and nucleospin kits yield rna with better integrity than the tri reagent .
to further validate the quality of rna obtained using the three different extraction kits , real - time pcr analysis was performed .
the expression patterns of four housekeeping genes , 18s rrna , beta - actin , rplp0 and hprt1 , were analyzed and presented as cycle threshold ( ct ) values .
as shown in figure 2 , the ct values obtained from tri reagent , paxgene and nucleospin extractions were 19.2 +/ - 1.6 , 16.6 +/ - 1.4 and 16.3 +/ - 1.5 for 18s rrna , 30.6 +/ - 1.8 , 26.4 +/ - 1.3 and 27.2 +/ - 1.3 for beta - actin , 29.9 +/ - 1.4 , 28.2 +/ - 1.8 and 27.0 +/ - 1.6 for rplp0 , and 36.3 +/ - 1.3 , 33.8 +/ - 1.1 and 32.9 +/ - 1.6 for hprt1 , respectively .
the ct values for rna extracted using tri reagent were ~ 1.7 to 3.8 times higher than those evaluated with the paxgene and nucleospin kits , clearly indicating that rna extracted with tri reagent is of lower quality .

*** p < 0.001 versus tri reagent .
among the three kits , tri reagent produced the highest rna yield .
however , the purity of tri - extracted rna ( a260 / 280 ratio of 1.7 ) and integrity ( rin 3.2 ) were lower , compared to rna extracted using the paxgene ( a260 / 280 ratio 2.0 , rin 6.0 ) and nucleospin ( a260 / 280 ratio 2.0 , rin 6.4 ) systems .
earlier , fleige and co - workers reported that rna with low rin values shows reduced pcr performance due to the presence of more highly fragmented molecules , leading to inaccurate gene expression evaluation ( fleige and pfaffl 2006 fleige et al. 2006 ) .
gene expression levels of c - fos , il - 1beta , il - 8 , and gapdh were decreased in blood samples with rin values below 5 ( pazzagli et al. 2013 ) .
rin values of the rna extracted with paxgene and nucleospin were higher than the cut - off value of 5 , suggesting that rna extracted using these kits is of similar quality and performs well in standard gene expression analysis ( beekman et al. 2009 ; pazzagli et al. 2013 ) .
in the current study , data obtained with real - time pcr revealed lower ct values of the housekeeping genes , 18s rrna , beta - actin , rplp0 and hprt1 , measured from paxgene and nucleospin extractions , compared to those measured from tri reagent - extracted rna ( figure 2 ) .
rna extracted with tri reagent can contain trace genomic dna contamination , which presents significant problems , especially for pcr - based applications ( jiang et al. 2013 ) .
in our experiments , rna isolated using tri reagent was not treated with dnase i. thus , we propose that tri reagent - extracted rna is contaminated with genomic dna , thereby showing high rna yield that is overestimated , low in purity and poorly amplified .
the increased availability of blood collection systems with rna - stabilizing additives and accompanying rna extraction kits has significantly improved the quality of rna isolated from blood ( rainen et al. 2002 ; thach et al. 2003 ) .
however , there remains a need to assess rna quality and profiling experiments in blood specimens collected with common blood collection systems ( edta tubes ) .
beekman and co - workers proposed a transfer method of thawed edta blood into the paxgene system , which is efficient in terms of yield and quality of rna , compared to the standard protocol ( qiaamp rna blood kit , qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) ( beekman et al. 2009 ) .
however , this method could not be expected to reverse gene expression changes and variability or rna quality loss that may have occurred after blood samples originally collected without rna - stabilizing additives ( beekman et al. 2009 ) .
the paxgene and nucleospin kits produced similar results in terms of rna purity and integrity and subsequent gene amplification .
our results indicate that rna extracted from frozen blood samples using the paxgene and nucleospin kits is of high quality , which should facilitate gene expression analyses , such as the real - time pcr assay .
however , the rna yield from nucleospin was higher than that from paxgene .
based on the collective findings , we conclude that extraction using the nucleospin kit is the most effective way to produce abundant and high - quality rna from frozen blood .
materials and methods samples and rna extraction procedure blood specimens were collected with informed consent from cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment in korea cancer center hospital .
blood was collected into potassium edta tubes ( greiner bio - one , frickenhausen , germany ) , transferred to axygen microtubes ( corning , tewsbury , usa ) , and stored at - 80degreesc .
after approval of the institutional review board , 15 frozen blood specimens stored for approximately 5 years were randomly selected .
frozen blood specimens were thawed on ice and rna extracted using three different kits ( tri reagent , paxgene and nucleospin ) according to the respective manufacturer protocols .
for tri reagent extraction , 200 mul of each blood sample was incubated with 800 mul tri reagent for 5 min at room temperature , followed by supplementation with 200 mul chloroform .

rna was dissolved in 40 mul rnase - free water .
for paxgene extraction , 300 mul of each blood sample was dispensed into 830 mul paxgene reagent at a blood : reagent ratio of 2.5:6.9 , which was the same as in the paxgene blood rna tubes ( beekman et al. 2009 ; carrol et al. 2007 ; krawiec et al. 2009 ) .
the mixture was incubated for 16 h at room temperature .

subsequently , 95 mul of rdnase was added to the column and incubated at room temperature for 15 min .
the column was washed with buffers rb2 and rb3 , and rna eluted using 40 mul rnase - free water .

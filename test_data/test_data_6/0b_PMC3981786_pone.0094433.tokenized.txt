objective over the past few decades , obesity has reached epidemic proportions , and is a major contributor to the global burden of chronic diseases and disability .
there is little evidence on obesity related co - morbidities in brics countries .
the first objective is to examine the factors associated with overweight and obesity in four of the five brics countries ( china , india , russia and south africa ) .
the second is to examine the linkage of obesity with selected morbidities .
methods we used data from the study on global ageing and adult health ( sage ) survey conducted by the world health organization ( who ) in china , india , russia and south africa during 2007 - 10 .
the morbidities included in the analysis are hypertension , diabetes , angina , stroke , arthritis and depression .
findings the prevalence of obesity was highest in south africa ( 35 %) followed by russia ( 22 %) , china ( 5 %) and india ( 3 %) .
the prevalence of obesity was significantly higher in females as compared to males in all the countries .
while the wealth quintile was associated with overweight in india and china , engaging in work requiring physical activity was associated with obesity in china and south africa .
overweight / obesity was positively associated with hypertension and diabetes in all the four countries .
obesity was also positively associated with arthritis and angina in china , russia and south africa .
in comparison , overweight / obesity was not associated with stroke and depression in any of the four countries .
conclusion obesity was statistically associated with hypertension , angina , diabetes and arthritis in china , russia and south africa .
in india , obesity was associated only with hypertension and diabetes .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction over the past few decades obesity has emerged as a global health challenge , with every sixth person being obese [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
in 2008 , more than 1.4 billion adults aged 20 or more years were overweight [ 3 ]. of these , 500 million adult men and women were obese .
statistics suggest significant variations in the prevalence of obesity across the globe .
the prevalence of obesity ranges from below 5 % in china , japan and african countries to over 75 % in urban samoa [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
obesity is known to affect the overall health of a population .
according to the world health organization ( who ) , overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths [ 3 ] .
obesity is also found to be associated with a number of non - communicable diseases ( ncds ) such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes , musculoskeletal disorders and some forms of cancers [ 3 ] .
statistics indicate that 44 % of the diabetes burden , 23 % of the heart disease burden and between 7 % and 41 % of certain cancer burdens can be attributed to overweight and obesity [ 3 ] .
brics is an international association of emerging national economies : brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa .
the member countries represent a mix of economies with developing countries like brazil , india , china and south africa and a developed country like russia .
the share of china , india , russia and south africa together in the total world population is approximately 40 % .
in terms of population aged 18 years or older , these comprise 41 % of the world 's population [ 6 ] .
these countries are at different stages of demographic and epidemiological transition .
like in many developed countries , obesity is emerging as an important public health problem in brics .
economic burden of obesity related ncds in brics is considerable .
according to the who report ( 2005 ) , annual losses in national income from heart disease , stroke and diabetes are estimated at $ 18 billion in china , $ 11 billion in russia , $ 9 billion in india and $ 3 billion in brazil [ 7 ] .
furthermore , china is expected to lose $ 558 billion over the next 10 years in foregone national income due to heart disease , stroke , and diabetes alone .
india and russia are expected to cross $ 200 billion & $ 300 billion respectively in the same period [ 7 ] .
in addition , ncds and injuries account for an estimated 62 % of the total age standardized burden of forgone disability adjusted life years ( dalys ) in india [ 8 ] .
several environmental as well as socio - economic and demographic factors are associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity .
age , gender , socio - economic condition , and urban - rural residence are associated with overweight and obesity [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
overweight / obesity are found to be associated with increasing age and female gender [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
the other factors that are associated with obesity are urbanization , changing lifestyles , low physical activity , and high calorie intake [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] .
the evidence on association between such factors and obesity in brics countries primarily comes from small - scale studies .
moreover , the spread of these risk factors in brics countries is relatively less known .
in addition , we do not know if all of these factors increase the risk of overweight and obesity in different settings .
obesity is known to contribute to a variety of health conditions .
studies have shown a significant association between obesity and major health risks such as diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol levels , asthma and arthritis [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
to our knowledge , there is only one study that has examined the linkage between obesity and hypertension in four of the five brics countries [ 18 ] .
we came across two studies from india [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , four studies from china [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] , one study from south africa [ 25 ] , and two studies from russia [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] that have examined the association between obesity and hypertension / heart disease and have found a significant positive association between them. with reference to studies on obesity and diabetes , we came across three studies only from china [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
the association between obesity and stroke was examined in a study conducted in china [ 21 ] , which reported that the obese were more likely to suffer from stroke than normal respondents .
likewise , the association between obesity and arthritis was examined only in a study conducted in rural russia [ 26 ] .
it is important to note that , except for basu & millett ( 2013 ) and peltzer & phaswana - mafuya ( 2013 ) [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] , all the studies listed above were either based on small - scale datasets ( and hence are not representative at the national level ) or referred to specific population subgroups .
also , we did not come across any large scale study that examined the association between obesity and depression in these countries .
in view of the issues discussed earlier , the aim of our study is to examine the extent of overweight and obesity in four of the five brics countries , namely india , china , south africa , and russia .
another aim of the study is to identify the most important factors associated with the increased risk of overweight and obesity in each of these countries .
in addition , we examine the association between obesity and selected morbidities - hypertension , diabetes , angina , stroke , arthritis , and depression .
our study is likely to provide more robust and comparable evidence on the association between obesity and selected morbidities in these countries .
methods ethics statement the study is based on a secondary data set with no identifiable information on the survey participants .
this dataset is available in the public domain for research use and hence no formal approval from the institutional review board is required .
so , no ethics statement is required for this work .
the data can be freely accessed from the who website http :// apps.who.int / healthinfo / systems / surveydata / index.php / catalog .
data the present study uses data from the study on global ageing and adult health ( sage ) surveys implemented by who in six countries - china , india , ghana , mexico , russia and south africa - during 2007 - 2010 .
the target population in the sage survey is adults , 18 years and older .
a multistage stratified clustered sample design was used uniformly in all the countries included in the sage .
sage collected information about self - reported morbidities and health conditions based on interview and health measurement , anthropometric measurements and blood tests [ 28 ] .
since our analysis is restricted to brics countries , we included china , india , russia and south africa in the analysis .
brazil could not be included in our analysis because the sage survey was not conducted in brazil .
sage interviewed 11,230 adults ( 18 years or older ) in india , 14,811 in china , 4,225 in south africa , and 4,335 in russia [ 28 ] .
adults for whom weight and height measurements were not available were excluded from the analysis .
hence , the final sample for the analysis was 10,915 for india , 13,898 for china , 3,889 for russia , and 3,994 for south africa .
variables in this study , body mass index ( bmi ) is taken as an indicator of obesity , calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters .
measured weight and height are used to calculate bmi .
respondents are classified as underweight ( bmi < 18.5 ) , normal ( 18.5 <= bmi < 25 ) , overweight ( 25 <= bmi < 30 ) and obese ( bmi >= 30 ) [ 29 ] .
the inclusion of morbidities in our analysis is based on two criteria - first , the morbidities must be influenced by obesity ; and second , information on the morbidities was collected by the sage survey .
accordingly , we included hypertension , diabetes , angina , stroke , arthritis , and depression in our analysis .
the sage survey collected three readings each of systolic and diastolic measures of blood pressure .
any respondent whose systolic measure was 140 or more or whose diastolic measure was 90 or more was coded as ' suffering from hypertension ' .
in addition , any respondent who reported as ever been diagnosed with hypertension was also coded as ' suffering from hypertension ' .
the rest were coded as ' not suffering from hypertension ' .
these cut - offs for hypertension have been recommended and used in a number of studies [ 19 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
for the remaining five morbidities , we used self - reports to code respondents as those having or not having morbidities .
the following questions were used to address the remaining five morbidities : have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ( high blood sugar ) ?
( yes , no ) have you ever been diagnosed with angina or angina pectoris ( a heart disease ) ?
( yes , no ) have you ever been told by a health professional that you have had a stroke ?
( yes , no ) have you ever been diagnosed with / told you have arthritis ( or by other names rheumatism or osteoarthritis ) ?
( yes , no ) have you ever been diagnosed with depression ?
( yes , no ) all the morbidities were coded into dummy variables .
for example , those reporting ' yes' to diabetes were coded as ' 1 ' and others were coded as ' 0 ' .
since bmi and selected morbidities are known to be affected by other risk factors , several individual and lifestyle factors have been included in the analysis .
the variables included in the analysis are : age , gender , schooling , wealth quintiles , place of residence , current smoking status , current alcohol use , and engaged in work that involves physical activity .
the wealth quintiles , which are already computed in the sage , were generated through a principal components analysis conducted on a set of variables based on the ownership of household assets [ 32 ] - [ 35 ] .
we identified respondents engaged in work that involved physical activity using the following two questions : does your work involve any type of vigorous - intensity activity that causes large increases in breathing or heart rate [ like heavy lifting , digging or chopping wood ] for at least 10 minutes continuously ?
( yes , no ) does your work involve any type of moderate - intensity activity that causes small increases in breathing or heart rate [ such as brisk walking , carrying light loads , cleaning , cooking , or washing clothes ] for at least 10 minutes continuously ?
( yes , no ) respondents who reported ' yes' to any of the two questions were coded as ' 1 ' and the rest were coded as ' 0 ' .
two community level variables - percentage of educated respondents in each community and average monthly household expenditure per community - were also included in the analysis .
statistical analysis bivariate and multivariate analyses have been used to fulfill the objectives of the paper .
since bmi had four categories ( underweight , normal , overweight and obese ) , we used multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with overweight and obesity .
as the selected morbidities were coded as dummy variables , two level random intercept logit models with respondents ( level 1 ) nested within communities ( level 2 ) were fitted to examine the association of obesity with selected morbidities .
appropriate sampling weights were used to control for the complex survey design of the sage .
sampling weights are given in the sage dataset ( see the sage reports for details of sampling weight ) .
the analysis presented in the paper was conducted in stata 12.0 .
results the percentage distribution of sample by selected characteristics is shown in table 1 .
among the four countries analyzed , smoking was highest in india ( 42 %) and lowest in russia ( 27 %) .
in comparison , drinking alcohol was highest in russia ( 41 %) and lowest in india ( 7 %) .
more than three - fourths of the respondents in india and russia reported that they were engaged in work that involved physical activity .
engagement in work that involved physical activity was reported least in south africa ( 52 %) .
only 24 % of the respondents from india and south africa were 50 years or older .
this compares with 36 % in china and 40 % in russia .
higher education was more common in the russian sample ; about 86 % of the respondents reported that they had high school education or more .
this percentage was 24 % in india , 27 % in china and 28 % in south africa .
rural - urban residence varied considerably across the countries .
the percent urban ranged between as low as 31 % in the indian sample to as high as 73 % in the russian sample .

in multinomial logistic regression , age was associated with overweight and obesity in india , china and russia ( table 2 ) .
50 years or older respondents were 1.2 - 2.4 times as likely as respondents below 50 years of age to be overweight than being normal .
likewise , 50 years or older respondents were 1.5 - 3.7 times as likely as respondents below 50 years of age to be obese than being normal .
gender was statistically associated with overweight and obesity in india and south africa .
in russia and china , gender was only associated with obesity .
females , when compared to males , were more likely to be overweight or obese than normal in india and south africa .
in russia and china , females , when compared to males , were more likely to be obese than normal .
wealth was statistically associated with overweight in india and china .
however , wealth was not associated with obesity in any of the countries .

smokers were less likely than non - smokers to be either overweight ( odds ratio : 0.58 - 0.68 ) or obese ( odds ratio : 0.42 - 0.75 ) than normal .
drinking alcohol was associated with overweight and obesity in china and south africa .
while engaging in work that involved physical activity was associated with both overweight and obesity in china , it was associated only with obesity in south africa .
respondents whose work involved physical activity were less likely to be obese than respondents whose work did not involve physical activity in these countries ( odds ratio for china - 0.83 ; odds ratio for south africa - 0.76 ) .
table 3 shows the prevalence of selected morbidities in india , china , south africa and russia .
the prevalence of hypertension was highest in south africa ( 51 %) and lowest in india ( 26 %) .
the prevalence of diabetes ranged between 3 % in india and china to 4 % in russia .
nearly 16 % of the respondents in russia reported angina compared to only 3 % - 4 % in india , china and south africa. of the four countries considered in the analysis , the prevalence of arthritis was the highest in russia ( 19 %) and the least in south africa ( 8 %) .

obese respondents were 1.4 - 2.5 times as likely as normal respondents to report arthritis in these countries .
likewise , obese respondents were 1.9 - 3.5 times as likely as normal respondents to have hypertension .
similarly , obese respondents were 2.1 - 3.0 times more likely to report diabetes than the normal respondents .
obese were also more likely to report angina than normal respondents .
in india , obesity was only associated with hypertension and diabetes - obese respondents were significantly more likely than the normal respondents to have hypertension or diabetes .
obesity was not associated with either stroke or depression in any of the selected countries .

( r ) indicates reference category .
marital status , age , gender , alcohol consumption , physical activity , smoking , educational level , wealth quintiles and place of residence are controlled in the model .
vpc ( variance partition coefficient ) is the proportion of total residual variance which is attributable to the community characteristics .
like obesity , overweight was also associated with hypertension and diabetes in all the four selected countries .
overweight respondents were 1.5 - 2.1 times more likely than normal respondents to report hypertension .
likewise , overweight respondents were 1.5 - 1.9 times more likely than normal respondents to report diabetes .
the association between overweight and arthritis was significant in india , china and south africa ( odds ratio : 1.5 , 1.2 and 1.5 in india , china and south africa respectively ) .
around 0.2 % - 42 % of residual variation in the chances of suffering from selected morbidities in selected countries was attributable to differences in the community characteristics .
discussion overweight and obesity varied considerably across four of the five brics countries included in the analysis .
the percentage overweight ranged between as low as 9 % in india to as high as 37 % in russia .
the percentage of obese ranged between as low as 3 % in india to as high as 35 % in south africa .
the prevalence of selected morbidities also varied considerably across the four countries .
the prevalence of hypertension , angina , stroke and diabetes were considerably higher in russia compared to the other three countries included in the analysis .
to account for the differences in the age - structure of the sampled respondents in four countries , we also estimated age - standardized prevalence for selected morbidities in each country .
the age - standardized rates also suggested a considerably high burden of hypertension , angina , stroke and diabetes in russia compared to the other three countries ( results not shown ) .
overweight / obesity was found to be associated with hypertension and diabetes in all the four countries .
our findings confirm the findings of the three small - scale studies conducted on a similar topic in china [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
obese respondents were also more likely to report arthritis in china , south africa and russia .
in contrast to our findings , kalichman et al .
( 2006 ) found no association between obesity and arthritis in rural russia [ 26 ] .
angina was also more likely to be reported by obese respondents in china , south africa and russia .
unlike earlier studies , stroke was not associated with overweight / obesity in our study .
the relationship between overweight / obesity and stroke might get affected by the way in which information was collected about stroke in the sage .
the question on stroke in the sage did not distinguish between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke .
a recent meta - analysis of prospective studies found increased risk of ischemic stroke in both overweight and obese individuals [ 36 ] .
hemorrhagic stroke however was not related to overweight / obesity .
depression was also not associated with overweight / obesity in our study .
one of the strengths of the sage survey is that it also allows for estimation of symptom based prevalence of selected morbidities such as angina , arthritis and depression .
to examine whether the association between overweight / obesity and these morbidities is robust , we also estimated binary logistic regressions using symptom based prevalence as the dependent variable .
the associations of overweight / obesity with arthritis and depression were similar to those obtained in self - reported prevalence .
when we used the symptom based prevalence of angina , the association between overweight / obesity and angina became statistically significant even in india ( results not shown ) .
in india , the relationship between overweight / obesity and angina , in self - reported diagnosis , might get affected by the biases related to health system access .
self - reported diagnoses could reflect systematic over or under reporting of ncds due to biases related to health system access [ 37 ] .
the strengths and limitations of our study must be noted .
one of the strengths of our study is the use of a large - scale population based dataset for examining the consequences of overweight / obesity in four of the five brics countries .
our study , perhaps for the first time , has provided robust and comparable evidence on the association between overweight / obesity and selected morbidities in brics countries .
the large sample sizes allowed us to control for a number of pertinent covariates in the multivariate statistical models .
the limitations of our study are that our study only establishes an association between overweight / obesity and selected morbidities and does not provide any evidence for causality .
second , the choice of control variables was limited to only those variables that were available for each of the four countries considered in the analysis .
to conclude , overweight / obesity was found to be an important risk factor for hypertension , angina , diabetes and arthritis .
it is thus important that public health programs focus their attention towards the growing epidemic of obesity before it reaches alarming levels .
interestingly , obesity is preventable [ 2 ] .
obesity prevention policies should focus on facilitating key behaviors like choosing healthier food , limiting unhealthy food , increasing physical activity , improving sleep , reducing stress , etc .
( http :// www.hsph.harvard.edu / obesity - prevention - source / obesity - prevention ) .
to achieve these , action is needed at multiple levels - from governments and industries , communities and neighborhoods , schools and workplaces , and individual and families [ 38 ] - [ 40 ] .
for example , to curb consumption of sugary drinks , governments could levy heavy taxes .
a recent indian study has shown that sustained high tax rates on sugar - sweetened beverages could mitigate rising obesity and type - 2 diabetes [ 18 ] .
schools can increase the recess time and promote dietary education and physical activity .
although evidence on how to prevent obesity is growing , there is a dearth of obesity prevention studies in low - and middle - income countries [ 41 ] .
hence future studies must examine the impact of obesity prevention strategies in low - and middle - income countries .

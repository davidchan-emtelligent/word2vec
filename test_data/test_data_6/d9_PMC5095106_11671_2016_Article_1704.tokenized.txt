metallic np - based products facilitate our daily life ; however , it has several disadvantages .
the widespread application of np - based products increases the risk of exposure to metallic nps for humans , especially for those who work in industries involving the use of these materials .
[ 7 ] .
in addition , several in vivo studies have demonstrated that once animals are exposed to metallic nps through intravenous injection [ 8 ] , intranasal instillation [ 9 ] , oral administration [ 10 ] , inhalation [ 11 ] , and intraperitoneal injection [ 12 ] , nps can be absorbed into the body and then re - distributed into secondary organs , such as the brain , liver , spleen , lungs , and kidneys .
the brain is an important organ susceptible to harmful substances [ 13 - 15 ] , and impairment to the brain is irreversible .
accumulated metallic nps , an exogenous stimuli , induce apoptosis , up - regulate inflammatory responses , activate signaling pathways , disturb the neurotransmitters , and impair organelles ( such as mitochondria ) , and these changes contribute to the neurotoxicity of nps , consequently leading to brain dysfunction .
however , the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of metallic nps remain unclear .
programmed cell death ( pcd ) , which is different from necrosis , is defined as active cell death , which is regulated by certain genes .
the role of pcd is to balance the proportion of dead cells and healthy cells and maintain homeostasis .
in general , pcd can be classified into apoptosis , autophagy , necroptosis , and pyroptosis [ 16 , 17 ] .
pcd can either be observed under physiological conditions or be induced by exogenous stimuli .
moreover , pcd is reported to be closely related to brain development [ 18 , 19 ] , neurodegenerative disorders [ 20 , 21 ] , brain injury [ 22 , 23 ] , and psychiatric disorders [ 24 ] .
based on the important role of pcd in neurological functions , in this review , we summarized the recent advances and put forward some suggestions regarding the involvement of pcd in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps by analyzing relevant articles .
we expect that investigating the correlation between pcd and metallic nps can help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of nps completely .
accumulation of metallic nps in the brain after systemic administration the brain is the main target of metallic nps , and brain damage is irreversible .
therefore , more attention should be paid to the threat posed by metallic nps on brain health .
metallic nps can be absorbed into the body and then translocated into the brain , mainly through the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) and direct nose - to - brain ( or olfactory ) pathway bypassing the bbb .
the results of several in vivo studies have revealed that metallic nps can be detected in animal brain after systemic administration .
rats showed higher anxious index , which indicated impaired neurobehavioral functions , and the contents of tio2 nps in the brain , lungs , and liver were elevated , owing to tio2 np exposure via intraperitoneal injection every 2 days for 20 days [ 12 ] .
the concentrations of tio2 nps in the brain , liver , spleen , kidneys , lungs , and heart were elevated after the rats were exposed to nps through single or repeated intravenous injection [ 8 ] .
when the rats were exposed to silver nps through chronic intranasal instillation , the brain subunits including the cortex , hippocampus , cerebellum , olfactory bulb , and medulla exhibited higher contents of nps [ 9 ] .
the exposure to silver nps through single intravenous injection can also increase the np levels in the mouse brain [ 25 , 26 ] .
meanwhile , an oral administration was able to increase the content of silver nps in the rat brains as well [ 10 , 27 - 29 ] .
in addition to tio2 and silver nps , exposure to gold nps through single intravenous injection increased the concentration of nps in the mouse brain [ 30 ] .
inhalation administration for 15 days led to elevated gold np levels in the subunits of the brain including the olfactory bulb , hippocampus , striatum , frontal cortex , entorhinal cortex , septum , and cerebellum [ 11 ] .
the gold np content in the rat brain was enhanced 24 h after the intravenous injection [ 31 ] .
zinc oxide ( zno ) np exposure through repeated oral administration slightly increased the zno np levels in the rat brains [ 32 ] .
the content of copper ( cu ) nps in the olfactory bulb increased after the mice were chronically exposed to cu nps through intranasal instillation [ 33 , 34 ] .
even worse , the metallic nps can cross the placental barrier and accumulate in fetal organs on exposure to nps during pregnancy .
when pregnant mice were intravenously injected with silica and tio2 nps , both nps were detected in the fetal brain , fetal liver , and placenta 24 h after the injection .
these changes might impair the fetal development including neurodevelopment , which indicates that developmental neurotoxicity can be induced by silica and tio2 nps [ 35 ] .
we must pay much attention to the neurodevelopmental toxicity of metallic nps , as fetal brain is more susceptible to harmful stimuli .
to sum up , investigating the bio - distribution of metallic nps might help us to screen the safest metallic nanomaterials and administration routes that can protect the brain from being affected by nps .
therefore , relevant studies should be further performed in the future .
in addition , studies should be conducted to comprehensively investigate the relationship between exposure to metallic nps during pregnancy and fetal brain development .
the contribution of pcd to the neurotoxicity of metallic nps as mentioned above , metallic nps can be translocated into the brain after systemic administration .
this accumulation in turn can lead to neurotoxicity .
pcd as an active cell death process mainly consists of apoptosis , autophagy , necroptosis , and pyroptosis .
moreover , pcd plays an important role in neurological functions .
therefore , we will discuss the correlation between pcd and the neurotoxicity of metallic nps , with the purpose of comprehensively understanding the neurotoxic mechanisms of nps .
apoptosis - - established role in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps apoptosis is the first and most commonly studied pcd type .
it can be simply defined as programmed " self - killing " [ 36 ] .
apoptosis plays an important role in cell renovation and elimination of injured cells .
dysregulation of cell apoptosis can induce cell death and impairment of tissues , consequently leading to organ dysfunction [ 37 ] .
human health and diseases can be regulated by cell apoptosis [ 37 , 38 ] .
apoptosis is mediated by caspase - dependent pathways ( fig. 1 ) [ 39 , 40 ] .
generally , apoptosis is characterized by blebbing , dna fragmentation , and caspase activation [ 41 - 43 ]. fig. 1 caspase activation pathways [ 131 ] .
caspase activation by the extrinsic pathway ( route 1 ) involves the binding of extracellular death ligands ( such as fasl or tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnfalpha )) to transmembrane death receptors .
engagement of death receptors with their cognate ligands provokes the recruitment of adaptor proteins , such as the fas - associated death domain protein ( fadd ) , which in turn recruit and aggregate several molecules of caspase - 8 , thereby promoting its autoprocessing and activation .
active caspase - 8 then proteolytically processes and activates caspase - 3 and caspase - 7 , provoking further caspase activation events that culminate in substrate proteolysis and cell death .
in some situations , extrinsic death signals can crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway through caspase - 8 - mediated proteolysis of the bh3 - only protein bid ( bh3 - interacting domain death agonist ) .
truncated bid ( tbid ) can promote mitochondrial cytochrome c release and assembly of the apoptosome ( comprising ~ 7 molecules of apoptotic protease - activating factor - 1 ( apaf1 ) and the same number of caspase - 9 homodimers ) .
in the intrinsic pathway ( route 2 ) , diverse stimuli that provoke cell stress or damage typically activate one or more members of the bh3 - only protein family .
bh3 - only proteins act as pathway - specific sensors for various stimuli and are regulated in distinct ways .
bh3 - only protein activation above a crucial threshold overcomes the inhibitory effect of the anti - apoptotic b cell lymphoma - 2 ( bcl - 2 ) family members and promotes the assembly of bak - bax oligomers within mitochondrial outer membranes .
these oligomers permit the efflux of intermembrane space proteins , such as cytochrome c , into the cytosol .
on release from mitochondria , cytochrome c can seed apoptosome assembly .
active caspase - 9 then propagates a proteolytic cascade of further caspase activation events .
the granzyme b - dependent route to caspase activation ( route 3 ) involves the delivery of this protease into the target cell through specialized granules that are released from cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) or natural killer ( nk ) cells .
ctl and nk granules contain numerous granzymes as well as a poreforming protein , perforin , which oligomerizes in the membranes of target cells to permit entry of the granzymes .
granzyme b , similar to the caspases , also cleaves its substrates after asp residues and can process bid as well as caspase - 3 and caspase - 7 to initiate apoptosis .
bad bcl - 2 antagonist of cell death , bak bcl - 2 - antagonist / killer - 1 , bax bcl - 2 - associated x protein , bid bh3 - interacting domain death agonist , bik bcl - 2 - interacting killer , bim bcl - 2 - like - 11 , bmf bcl - 2 modifying factor , hrk harakiri ( also known as death protein - 5 ) , puma bcl - 2 binding component - 3 in vitro studies related to apoptosis in neurotoxicity of metallic nps long et al. first reported that tio2 nps can induce apoptosis in immortalized mouse microglia ( bv2 ) , rat dopaminergic neuronal cells ( n27 ) , and primary embryonic rat stratum neurons [ 44 ] .
another research group revealed that the proportion of apoptotic cells in human astrocyte - like cell lines ( u87 ) increased on tio2 np exposure [ 45 ] .
tio2 np exposure inhibited cell proliferation , increased the proportion of apoptotic cells , activated caspase - 3 in rat ( c6 ) and human ( u373 ) glial cell lines , and was accompanied by hyper - condensed nuclei [ 46 ] .
tio2 nps can also attenuate cell viability and increase the number of apoptotic cells after the exposure of murine microglia cell lines ( n9 ) to nps [ 47 ] .
besides , the mitochondrial membrane potential ( mmp ) of pc12 cells was reduced by tio2 np exposure , whereas the proportion of apoptotic cells was enhanced .
the expression of bax and p53 was up - regulated , while that of bcl - 2 was down - regulated at the protein level .
meanwhile , tio2 np exposure promoted the activity of caspase - 3 [ 48 ] .
these changes indicated that apoptosis in pc12 cells was induced by tio2 nps .
cell viability was not reduced by tio2 nps ; however , the cell cycle was disturbed on exposure to tio2 nps .
an increased proportion of apoptotic cells and up - regulated mmp were observed in human neuronal cell lines ( sh - sy5y ) [ 49 ] .
after the rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to silver np , cell viability decreased , the protein levels of caspase - 3 increased , the proportion of apoptotic cells increased , and a dna ladder was observed .
these findings suggested that silver np induced apoptosis , which led to neurotoxicity [ 50 ] .
silver np can reduce cell viability , increase the number of apoptotic cells , enhance reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production , and activate caspase - 3 in rat primary neurons .
in vivo experiments further confirmed that silver np can be detected in the rat brain , and after intranasal administration , they can in turn up - regulate the protein levels of caspase - 3 , which was consistent with the results observed in the in vitro experiment .
these findings suggested that silver np exposure can induce caspase - dependent apoptosis contributing to neurotoxicity [ 51 ] .
another study revealed that silver nps reduced cell viability and increased the number of apoptotic cells in pc12 , which further verified the role of caspases in apoptosis .
co - treating pc12 cells with caspase - 8 or caspase - 9 inhibitors attenuated the apoptosis induced by nps , which suggested that both death receptor - regulated signaling and mitochondrial - mediated pathway are involved in silver np - induced apoptosis in pc12 cells [ 52 ] .
the proportion of apoptotic cells in rat primary astrocytes , determined by using dna fragmentation assay [ 53 ] and flow cytometry [ 54 ] , was elevated in the silver np - treated group .
the caspase activity was also enhanced in this group [ 54 ] .
when the human neuroblastoma cell lines ( sh - sy5y ) were treated with zno nps , cell viability was reduced , swelling or loss of organelles was detected , the number of apoptotic cells increased , and the activities of caspase - 3 / 7 were up - regulated [ 55 ] .
a similar conclusion was reached by another study , which revealed that the number of apoptotic cells in sh - sy5y was enhanced by zno nps [ 56 ] .
mouse neural stem cells ( nscs ) can be impaired by zno nps .
cell viability was attenuated , accompanied by impaired morphology ( such as membrane blebbing and hyper - condensed chromatin ) and increased proportion of apoptotic cells , which indicated that apoptosis was induced by zno nps [ 57 ] .
after c6 cells were exposed to zno nps , the nps were taken up by the c6 cells , which resulted in the reduction of cell viability .
meanwhile , apoptotic - like morphological features such as blebbing , nucleus shrinkage , and hyper - condensed chromatin were observed .
the number of apoptotic cells increased as well [ 58 ] .
zno nps induced apoptosis in u87 cells , which was characterized by condensed chromatin , nuclear fragmentation , and the increase in the apoptotic cell proportion [ 59 ] .
the neurotoxicity induced by tio2 , silver , and zno nps was widely investigated .
in addition , other metallic nanomaterials were able to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells .
viability of pc12 was reduced , and the number of apoptotic cells was elevated by copper nps [ 60 ] .
iron oxide nps can also decrease the cell viability and induce apoptosis in pc12 cells , characterized by the increased proportion of apoptotic cells and up - regulated protein levels of p53 and bax , as well as down - regulated bcl - 2 protein expression [ 61 ] .
in vivo studies related to apoptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps tio2 nps can be detected in the mouse hippocampus after intragastric treatment for 60 days .
the accumulated tio2 nps can in turn induce apoptotic - like changes in cell morphology ( such as condensed chromatin and shrinkage of the nuclear membrane ) and dna ladder .
meanwhile , the expression of caspase - 3 , caspase - 9 , bax , and cytochrome c was up - regulated accompanied by the down - regulated expression of bcl - 2 at gene and protein levels .
these findings suggested that an intrinsic apoptosis pathway in the mouse hippocampus was induced by tio2 np exposure , which resulted in impaired spatial recognition ability [ 62 ] .
tio2 nps can be detected in the rat brain after intravenous injection , once a week for 4 weeks .
this accumulation increased the number of apoptotic cells , induced dna ladder , activated caspase - 3 , up - regulated the expressions of p53 , bax , and cytochrome c , and down - regulated bcl - 2 expression at gene and protein levels .
these results indicated that mitochondria - mediated apoptosis in the rat brain was induced by tio2 nps [ 63 ] .
after the mice were exposed to tio2 nps for 90 consecutive days through intranasal instillation , nps were detected in the mouse brain .
meanwhile , the proportion of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus increased , as indicated by apoptotic morphology ( shrinkage of the nucleus , condensed chromatin , and swollen mitochondria ) , and the expression of genes related to apoptosis , determined by dna microarray analysis , was altered [ 64 ] .
exposure to tio2 nps during pregnancy via subcutaneous injection can alter the expression of genes related to apoptosis , which were determined by dna microarray analysis in the brain of mouse offsprings [ 65 ] .
these changes indicated that tio2 np exposure could induce developmental neurotoxicity .
silver nps can increase the number of apoptotic cells in the rat hippocampal subunits ( ca1 , ca2 , ca3 , and dg ) after oral administration for 28 days [ 66 ] .
exposure to silver nps during pregnancy can also elevate the proportion of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal subunits of rat offsprings [ 67 ] .
meanwhile , silver nps can be taken up by human embryonic neural precursor cells ( hnpcs ) , thereby inducing apoptosis in hnpcs [ 68 ] .
these findings indicated that apoptosis was also probably implicated in the developmental neurotoxicity of silver nps .
rats exposed to cuo nps through intraperitoneal injection once a day for 14 days performed poorly in the morris water maze ( mwm ) test and long - term potentiation ( ltp ) was affected , which indicated that the rat hippocampus was impaired by nps .
at the same time , both the activity of caspase - 3 and the levels of 4 - hydroxynonenal ( hne ) in the rat hippocampus were up - regulated in the np - treated group when compared to that in the control group , indicating an apoptotic process in the hippocampal zone [ 69 ] .
apoptosis induced by gold nps also resulted in neurotoxicity .
a study involving in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that gold np exposure activated caspase - 3 and increased the number of apoptotic sh - sy5y cells .
the in vivo experiment showed that gold nps can be detected in the mouse brain and can promote caspase - 3 activity after intravenous injection , which was consistent with the results of the in vitro experiment [ 70 ] .
aluminum oxide np exposure through intranasal instillation damaged the mouse neurobehavioral function , accompanied by reduced mmp , increased apoptotic cells , and up - regulated caspase - 3 gene expression [ 71 ] in the mouse brain .
regulation of neuronal apoptosis induced by metallic nps although apoptosis was involved in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps , the molecular mechanisms by which the nps regulated apoptosis are unknown .
studies showed that oxidative stress ( os ) status was related to cell apoptosis [ 72 - 74 ] .
therefore , a few rescue studies were conducted to verify the role of np - induced os in nanoneurotoxicity .
tio2 np exposure decreased cell viability and increased ros production in pc12 cells ; it also increased the proportion of apoptotic pc12 cells .
however , pretreating pc12 cells with n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) can reverse these changes .
these findings suggested that the apoptosis in pc12 was probably mediated by tio2 np - induced ros [ 75 ] , as nac had an antioxidant property [ 76 , 77 ] .
treatment with zno nps can lead to decreased cell viability , excessive ros production , and apoptotic morphology , such as nuclear shrinkage in primary astrocytes .
meanwhile , the reduction in mmp suggested that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was implicated in neurotoxicity .
further experiments found that the proportion of apoptotic astrocytes increased .
at the same time , the expression of bax , cleaved poly - adp - ribose polymerase ( parp ) , and cleaved caspase - 3 was up - regulated at the protein level .
however , the level of bcl - 2 protein decreased on treatment with zno nps .
pretreatment of astrocytes with nac or jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) inhibitor could reverse the harmful effects induced by metallic nps , which indicated that apoptosis was probably caused by np - induced ros through the jnk pathway [ 78 ] .
zno nps can reduce pc12 viability and increase the number of apoptotic pc12 cells , which was determined using flow cytometry .
however , pretreating pc12 cells with n - ( mercaptopropionyl ) - glycine ( n - mpg ) can lead to the inhibition of apoptotic process , which indicated that apoptosis in pc12 might be mediated by zno np - induced os [ 79 ] .
n - mpg is another type of ros scavenger [ 80 ] .
copper oxide ( cuo ) nps can decrease the mouse hippocampal cell line ( ht22 ) viability and increase the number of apoptotic ht22 ; they also up - regulated bax gene levels and down - regulated bcl - 2 mrna levels in ht22 .
meanwhile , the os status in ht22 cells was disrupted .
however , pretreating ht22 cells with crocetin can attenuate those harmful impacts .
these findings indicated that cuo np - induced apoptosis in ht22 cells was probably mediated by np - induced os [ 81 ] .
crocetin possessed antioxidant and neuroprotective capabilities and could counteract os [ 82 - 84 ] .
these results indicated that apoptosis was most probably initiated by metallic np - induced os. however , more rescue studies are needed to further confirm it. in addition to os mechanism , other potential mechanisms should be investigated .
the findings from the above - mentioned in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that metallic np - induced apoptosis was involved in the neurotoxicity of nps .
meanwhile , a few rescue studies revealed that apoptosis in neurotoxicity was probably regulated by metallic np - induced os. in addition , findings were mostly obtained from in vitro studies .
furthermore , except tio2 nps , zno nps , and silver nps , other metallic nanomaterials were less studied .
besides , metallic nps can cross the placental barrier to affect fetal brain development , but studies about the involvement of apoptosis in developmental neurotoxicity of metallic nps were scarce .
autophagy - - role in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps needs further verification recently , autophagy has become a hot topic and has attracted much attention .
it can be simply defined as programmed " self - eating " [ 36 ] .
autophagy is different from apoptosis , and is mediated by caspase - independent pathways .
it can be identified as a particular accommodation of cells to starvation .
the process of autophagy includes cell degradation , in which the cargo in the cytoplasm is transported into the lysosome .
autophagy is a dynamic recycling system and it can maintain cellular renovation and homeostasis [ 85 ] .
it can be classified into microautophagy , macroautophagy , and chaperone - mediated autophagy ( cma ) ( fig. 2 ) [ 86 , 87 ]. fig. 2 different types of autophagy [ 132 ] .
microautophagy refers to the sequestration of cytosolic components directly by lysosomes through invaginations in their limiting membrane .
the function of this process in higher eukaryotes is not known , whereas microautophagy - like processes in fungi are involved in selective organelle degradation .
in the case of macroautophagy , the cargoes are sequestered within a unique double - membrane cytosolic vesicle , an autophagosome .
sequestration can be either nonspecific , involving the engulfment of bulk cytoplasm , or selective , targeting specific cargoes such as organelles or invasive microbes .
the autophagosome is formed by expansion of the phagophore , but the origin of the membrane is unknown .
fusion of the autophagosome with an endosome ( not shown ) or a lysosome provides hydrolases .
lysis of the autophagosome inner membrane and breakdown of the contents occurs in the autolysosome , and the resulting macromolecules are released back into the cytosol through membrane permeases .
chaperone - mediated autophagy ( cma ) involves direct translocation of unfolded substrate proteins across the lysosome membrane through the action of a cytosolic and lysosomal chaperone hsc70 , and the integral membrane receptor lysosome - associated membrane protein type 2a ( lamp - 2a ) many studies revealed that metallic nps can induce autophagy in non - neuronal cells including human keratinocytes ( hacat ) [ 88 ] , normal lung cells [ 89 ] , mrc - 5 fibroblasts [ 90 ] , immune cells [ 91 ] , human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cells [ 92 ] , murine peritoneal macrophage cells ( raw264.7 ) [ 93 ] , and mouse embryonic fibroblasts [ 94 ] .
therefore , autophagy has been regarded as one of the mechanisms underlying nanotoxicity [ 95 ] .
moreover , it has been reported that autophagy was involved in neurotoxicity [ 96 - 98 ] .
a few studies on the role of autophagy in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps have been published .
kenzaoui et al .
[ 99 ] found that the exposure of human cerebral endothelial cells ( hcecs ) to aminopva ( poly ( vinyl alcohol / vinylamine )) - coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide ( uspio ) nps , autophagic vacuoles were observed in hcecs and lc3 - ii. in addition , the cathepsin d protein levels were up - regulated , which suggested that autophagy in hcecs was induced by nps .
manshian et al .
[ 100 ] treated murine c17.2 neural progenitor cells with silver nps and found that the lc3 fluorescent intensity was enhanced , which indicated that autophagy in c17.2 was induced by silver nps .
since os can induce autophagy [ 101 - 103 ] , which was implicated in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps [ 104 - 106 ] , the role of autophagy in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps should be not ignored .
necroptosis and pyroptosis - - potential role in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps the role of necroptosis and pyroptosis in the toxicity of metallic nps has not been extensively studied .
necroptosis , which can also be called " programmed necrosis ," is initiated by activating the death receptor with stimuli ( fig. 3 ) .
receptor - interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 are frequently involved in necroptosis [ 107 , 108 ] .
studies on the relationship between necroptosis and nanotoxicity are rare .
however , recent studies have demonstrated that cigarette can induce necroptosis in the mouse airway [ 109 ] , carbon tetrachloride can lead to liver fibrosis via necroptosis [ 110 ] , and glutamate can induce necroptosis in ht - 22 cells [ 111 ]. fig. 3 tnfr1 - elicited signaling pathways [ 133 ] .
a on tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) binding , tnf receptor 1 ( tnfr1 ) undergoes a conformational change , allowing for the intracellular assembly of the so - called tnfr complex i , which includes tnf receptor - associated death domain ( tradd ) , receptor - interacting protein 1 ( rip1 ; also known as ripk1 ) , cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ( ciaps ) , tnf receptor - associated factor 2 ( traf2 ) and traf5 .
on ciap - mediated lys63 - ubiquitylation , rip1 can serve as a scaffold for the recruitment of transforming growth factor - beta activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) and tak1 - binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) and tab3 , which initiate the canonical nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) activation pathway .
riboflavin kinase ( rfk ) physically bridges the tnfr1 death domain to p22phox ( also known as cyba ) , the common subunit of multiple nadph oxidases , including nadph oxidase 1 ( nox1 ) , which also contributes to tnfalpha - induced necroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .
conversely , on deubiquitylation by cylindromatosis ( cyld ; and perhaps also by a20 ( also known as tnfaip3 ) , cezanne ( also known as otud7b ) or ubiquitin - specific peptidase 21 ( usp21 )) , rip1 exerts lethal functions , which can be executed by two distinct types of cell death .
b the internalization of tnfr1 is accompanied by a change in its binding partners that leads to the cytosolic assembly of tnfr complex ii , which often ( but not invariably ) contains tradd , fas - associated protein with a death domain ( fadd ) , caspase - 8 , rip1 , and rip3 ( also known as ripk3 ) .
normally , caspase - 8 triggers apoptosis by activating the classical caspase cascade .
it also cleaves , and hence inactivates , rip1 and rip3 .
c if caspase - 8 is blocked by pharmacological or genetic interventions , rip1 and rip3 become phosphorylated ( perhaps by an unidentified kinase ) and engage the effector mechanisms of necroptosis .
fad flavin adenine nucleotide , fmn flavin mononucleotide pyroptosis , a new type of pcd , is typically regulated by the caspase - 1 - dependent signaling pathway ( fig. 4 ) .
caspase - 1 is not involved in apoptosis or autophagy [ 112 , 113 ] .
it has been reported that silver nps can induce pyroptosome formation in human monocytes ( thp - 1 ) and up - regulate the caspase - 1 protein expression , which indicates that pyroptosis in thp - 1 was induced by nps [ 114 ]. fig. 4 pyroptosis , an inflammatory host response [ 134 ] .
caspase - 1 is cleaved and activated in response to multiple stimuli , but once activated , caspase - 1 results in a conserved program of cell death referred to as pyroptosis .
caspase - 1 activation also leads to rapid formation of plasma - membrane pores with a diameter of 1.1 - 2.4 nm. these pores dissipate cellular ionic gradients , allowing water influx , cell swelling , and osmotic lysis .
the pro - forms of interleukin - 1beta ( il - 1beta ) and il - 18 are processed by caspase - 1 and released during pyroptosis , although the exact mechanism of secretion remains controversial .
secretion does not require lysis and is temporally associated with caspase - 1 - dependent pore formation , suggesting that these pores facilitate cytokine release .
other suggested secretion mechanisms include caspase - 1 - independent lysosome exocytosis and microvesicle shedding .
caspase - 1 activity results in cleavage of chromosomal dna by an unidentified endonuclease .
cleavage of dna does not result in the oligonucleosomal fragments observed during apoptosis .
nuclear condensation is also observed but nuclear integrity is maintained , unlike the nuclear fragmentation observed during apoptosis the role of necroptosis and pyroptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps is uncertain .
however , several reports have demonstrated that necroptosis and pyroptosis can be induced by os [ 115 - 118 ] , and metallic np - induced os contributed to neurotoxicity .
furthermore , necroptosis was involved in neurotoxicity induced by other harmful substances , such as iron [ 119 ] , streptococcus pneumoniae [ 120 ] , and tnf - alpha [ 121 ] .
therefore , we hypothesized that metallic np - induced os can probably initiate necroptosis and pyroptosis , which might contribute to the neurotoxicity of nps .
future perspectives based on the results of the above - mentioned studies , we put forward some suggestions for future research to understand the role of pcd in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps completely .
since the role of apoptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps has been widely studied , the signaling pathways through which nps regulate neuronal apoptosis should be investigated comprehensively .
as metallic np exposure during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development [ 122 - 124 ] , much attention should be paid to the role of apoptosis in developmental neurotoxicity induced by nps .
more in vivo studies are needed to further confirm the vital role of apoptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps .
in addition to tio2 nps and silver nps that were most widely studied , other metallic nanomaterials including nps of gold , copper , copper oxide , aluminum oxide , and iron oxide should be investigated to understand the pivotal role of apoptosis in the neurotoxicity of nps completely .
several studies have already been performed to investigate the role of autophagy in non - neuronal cells [ 125 - 127 ] , and autophagy was implicated in brain / neuron damage [ 128 - 130 ] .
although a few studies confirmed the involvement of autophagy in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps , its role in neurotoxicity still needs further verification. whether necroptosis or pyroptosis is involved in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps should be investigated in the future .
the correlation among apoptosis , autophagy , necroptosis , and pyroptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps should be studied .
conclusions the widespread application of metallic np - based products raises concerns about the safety of nps .
the brain is the most important organ that can be impaired by metallic nps .
based on the vital role of pcd in neurological functions , we summarized articles related to the role of pcd in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps , and we found that apoptosis was involved in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps .
although autophagy is involved in nanotoxicity , few studies on the relationship between autophagy and neurotoxicity of metallic nps have been reported .
in addition , studies about the role of necroptosis or pyroptosis in the neurotoxicity of metallic nps are scarce .
therefore , for unraveling the neurotoxic mechanisms underlying metallic nps , the role of pcd in nanoneurotoxicity should be investigated comprehensively in the future .

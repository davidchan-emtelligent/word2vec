visual acuity usually remains normal except when the condition is long standing and severe .
aims this case highlights occurrence of acute onset visual loss as a rare presentation of iih .
case report a 27 - years - old obese female , presented with 15 days history of acute onset holocranial throbbing headache and eight days history of acute onset rapidly progressive visual loss in both eyes .
neurological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema with visual acuity 6 / 60 in right eye and 1 / 60 in left eye with no other neurological deficit .
contrast enhanced mri brain was suggestive of iih and ct venography was normal .
csf manometry showed 520 mm of csf pressure with normal protein and cellular response .
thus , a final diagnosis of definite iih was made .
acetazolamide 250 mg thrice a day was started with which she had significant improvement in headache and visual acuity over next 2 weeks and visual acuity was recorded as 6 / 18 in both eyes at two weeks follow up. conclusion iih should always be considered as a possible diagnosis in a patient with headache and papilloedema with no other signs of focal neurological deficits .
although uncommon , acute onset visual loss in iih can be presenting feature in some patients .

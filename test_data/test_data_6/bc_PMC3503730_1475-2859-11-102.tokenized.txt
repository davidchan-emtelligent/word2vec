background lipase from rhizopus chinensis is a versatile biocatalyst for various bioconversions and has been expressed at high - level in pichia pastoris .
however , the use of r. chinensis lipase in industrial applications is restricted by its low thermostability .
directed evolution has been proven to be a powerful and efficient protein engineering tool for improvement of biocatalysts .
the present work describes improvement of the thermostability of r. chinensis lipase by directed evolution using p. pastoris as the host .
results an efficient , fast and highly simplified method was developed to create a mutant gene library in p. pastoris based on in vivo recombination , whose recombination efficiency could reach 2.3 x 105 / mug dna .
the thermostability of r27rcl was improved significantly by two rounds of error - prone pcr and two rounds of dna shuffling in p. pastoris .
the s4 - 3 variant was found to be the most thermostable lipase , under the conditions tested .
compared with the parent , the optimum temperature of s4 - 3 was two degrees higher , tm was 22 degrees higher and half - lives at 60degreesc and 65degreesc were 46 - and 23 - times longer .
moreover , the catalytic efficiency kcat / km of s4 - 3 was comparable to the parent .
stabilizing mutations probably increased thermostability by increasing the hydrophilicity and polarity of the protein surface and creating hydrophobic contacts inside the protein .
conclusions p. pastoris was shown to be a valuable cell factory to improve thermostability of enzymes by directed evolution and it also could be used for improving other properties of enzymes .
in this study , by using p. pastoris as a host to build mutant pool , we succeeded in obtaining a thermostable variant s4 - 3 without compromising enzyme activity and making it a highly promising candidate for future applications at high temperatures .
lipase directed evolution thermostability mutant library construction pichia pastoris background lipases ( triacylglycerol ester hydrolases ec 3.1.1.3 ) are enzymes that hydrolyze the ester bonds of water - insoluble substrates at the interface between substrate and water .
they are well known because of their remarkable levels of activity and stability in non - aqueous environments , which makes them as attractive enzyme for use in industrial applications , such as in food , pharmaceutical , chemical and detergent industries [ 1 - 3 ] .
rhizopus lipases have been widely used in food industries [ 4,5 ] .
nevertheless , most rhizopus lipases are mesozymes as they are produced by mesophilic organisms and exhibit unfavorable thermostability [ 6 ] .
for example , lipase ral from r. arrhizus showed poor thermostability when incubated at 30degreesc for 30 min [ 7 ] .
lipase rol from r. oryzae showed highest activity at 35degreesc and about 35 % of the lipase activity was lost after incubation at 45degreesc for 30 min [ 8 ] .
another lipase prorol derived from r. oryzae dsm853 exhibited better thermostability with a tm value of 57.5degreesc [ 9 ] .
in our previous study , a lipase gene prorcl from r. chinensis cctcc m201021 was cloned and expressed at high - level in pichia pastoris as r27rcl , whose activity was about 580 times higher than that of wild - type r. chinensis lipase [ 10 ] .
this recombinant enzyme showed a high potential for industrial usage , as an additive for bread baking , synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) , sorbitan oleate , and ethyl esters [ 11 - 15 ] .
however , the use of lipase r27rcl from r. chinensis is restricted by its low thermostability .
directed evolution has been proven to be a powerful and efficient protein engineering tool for improvement of biocatalysts [ 16 ] .
several lipases from rhizopus sp. were subjected to directed evolution in an effort to produce thermostable variants [ 7,17 ] .
the half - life of ral expressed in p. pastoris was prolonged by 12 - fold at 50degreesc [ 7 ] .
the tm value of rnl from r. niveus expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae was improved from 47degreesc to 57degreesc [ 17 ] .
the production of an active rhizopus lipase has been performed in escherichia coli [ 18 ] , s. cerevisiae [ 19 ] and p. pastoris [ 20 - 22 ] , among which the expression of rhizopus lipase in p. pastoris was the best .
the p. pastoris expression system offers several advantages , as a desirable host in directed evolution , for easy library screening and further industrial application , such as the ability to perform eukaryotic protein modifications , high levels of protein expression at the intra - or extracellular level and an alcohol oxidase 1 ( aox1 ) gene promoter tightly regulated by methanol [ 23,24 ] .
however , mutant library construction in p. pastoris usually requires time - consuming multistep procedures which include an intermediate bacterial host ( e. coli ) and restriction digestion procedures [ 25 ] .
in this work , we developed a faster and simplified mutant library production method , based on which , the thermostability of the lipase r27rcl from r. chinensis cctcc m201021 was improved by directed evolution .
results and discussion library construction a novel approach for lipase mutant library construction in p. pastoris was established based on the formation of a recombination cassette in vivo ( figure 1 ) .
three pairs of overlapping primers were used to generate the mutant gene ( fragment b / c ) and two different vector fragments ( a and d ) .
primer bc - f had 66 bp overlapped pairs with the 5 ' - end of the gene sequence (" a " in figure 1 ) of fragment d and primer bc - r had 60 bp overlapped pairs with the 3 ' - end of the gene sequence (" b " in figure 1 ) of fragment a. therefore , fragment b / c generated by primers bc - f and bc - r had 66 bp and 60 bp overlapped sequences with vector fragments d and a. the lipase gene fragment b ( or c ) and vector fragments a and d were mixed and transformed into p. pastoris competent cells by electroporation .
in vivo , the fragments a , b / c and d self - reassembled to form a recombination cassette relying on the 60 bp and 66 bp homologous arms between them ( steps 1 and 2 in figure 1 ) .
the self - reassembled expression cassette was integrated into the genome of p. pastoris by homologous recombination of the flanking aox1 gene sequences ( steps 3 and 4 in figure 1 ) .
figure 1 the novel approach of construction of the lipase mutant library in p. pastoris based on the formation of a recombination cassette in vivo . the hatched areas ( a ) and ( b ) were overlapped sequences between amplified fragments .
recombination efficiency is one of the most important factors in directed evolution .
in order to improve the recombination efficiency , the effects of the fragment molar ratio and the length of the overlapping sequences for recombination were investigated .
as shown in table 1 , the recombination efficiency was improved with the increased molar ratio of fragment b / c : a : d in the dna mixture by electroporation .
about 2.3 x 105 / mug dna recombinants were obtained when the molar ratio reached 10:1:1 and the values dropped to 1.8 x 105 / mug dna , 1.2 x 105 / mug dna or 1.0 x 105 / mug dna when the molar ratio was 5:1:1 , 3:1:1 or 1:1:1 .
in order to obtain high recombination efficiency , the fragment molar ratio b / c : a : d of 10:1:1 was chosen .
the recombination efficiency was low with shorter overlapping sequences (< 55 bp ) due to the difficulty in formation of a recombination cassette in vivo , while too long overlapping sequences (> 70 bp ) resulted in pcr technical difficulties with blurred and weak target bands when amplified with such long primers .
medium length of overlapping sequences ( 55 - 70 bp ) generated satisfied recombination efficiency without pcr technical difficulties ( table 1 ) .
it is well known that homologous recombination is a common characteristic of yeast .
[ baudin et al. 26 ] demonstrated that the amount of homology necessary to promote efficient recombination - mediated gene disruption in s. cerevisiae is in the order of 30 - 50 bp .
[ oldenburg et al. 27 ] reported that 20 bp of homology is sufficient to generate the pcr - directed recombination in s. cerevisiae , at least under certain conditions ( vector : insert 1:6 ) .
table 1 the effects of the fragment molar ratio of b / c : a : d and the length of the overlapping sequences on recombination efficiency method recombination efficiency c ( x 105 , recombinants / mug dna ) fragment b / c : a : d ( molar ratio ) a 10:1:1 2.30 5:1:1 1.80 3:1:1 1.20 1:1:1 1.05 length of overlapping sequences ( bp ) b 10 0.10 25 0.80 40 1.25 55 1.75 70 2.32 85 2.35 a the length of overlapping sequence was kept at 65 bp. b the fragment molar ratio of b / c : a : d was kept at 10:1:1 .
c recombination efficiency is the number of recombinant cells ( recombinants ) generated by 1 mug of dna fragments in a transformation procedure .
in this work , in order to make directed evolution practical in the host organism p. pastoris an efficient , fast and highly simplified method was developed to create a gene mutant library in p. pastoris .
this method went a crucial step beyond previous approaches [ 25,28 - 30 ] because it completely discarded time - consuming multi - step procedures including construction of recombinant plasmid , transformation of an intermediate bacterial host ( e. coli ) , plasmid isolation and linearization .
in our approach , only three pcr amplification processes and an electroporation step were required .
[ fernandez et al. 31 ] also reported a method to produce a mutant library in p. pastoris , which reassembled a recombination cassette in vitro and produced about 6000 colonies per 1 mug of linear dna .
the method developed in our research was more convenient and efficient since self - reassembly of the linear recombinant cassette occurred in vivo .
thermostable variants the thermostability of r27rcl was improved by combining two rounds of error - prone pcr and two rounds of dna shuffling ( figure 2 ) .
error - prone pcr was used to introduce an average of 1 to 2 amino acid substitutions per prorcl gene and dna shuffling could combine beneficial mutations as well as create new mutations .
after creating the first - generation mutant library using error - prone pcr , approximately 5000 clones were screened for increased thermostability at 45degreesc .
two variants ( ep1 - 1 and ep1 - 26 ) were identified and confirmed to have longer half - lives at 60degreesc ( table 2 ) .
ep1 - 1 ( p168l , v329a ) and ep1 - 26 ( s234f ) with a total of three substitutions were chosen as templates for generating the second - generation mutant library using error - prone pcr .
only 0.1 % of the second generation mutant pool ( 5200 clones ) screened at 50degreesc exhibited better performance than the first - generation parents .
the identified variants ep2 - 3 , ep2 - 4 , ep2 - 8 and ep2 - 12 were selected for dna shuffling .
it was interesting to note that ep2 - 8 ( s234f , p168l , k219d ) and ep2 - 12 ( s234f , v329a , k161r ) both acquired mutations that were derived from ep1 - 1 and ep1 - 26 via in vivo dna shuffling. from each generation of dna shuffling , approximately 10000 clones were screened for increased thermostability .
the third - generation evolution produced three variants ( s3 - 1 , s3 - 4 , s3 - 18 ) whose thermostability slightly increased , whereas the last generation of evolution yielded three variants ( s4 - 3 , s4 - 13 , s4 - 20 ) with significantly improved thermostability ( figure 2 ) .
s4 - 3 was the most thermostable variant .
it contained five mutations ( a129s , a230t , s234f , l180h , h317p ) observed in previous generations plus one new mutation ( t218s ) generated by the fourth round of dna shuffling .

newly - introduced mutations in each generation are marked with asterisks .

at 60degreesc the t1 / 2 of the parent was 4 min .
the variants from the first and the second generations had half - lives of thermal inactivation two - to five - fold longer than the parent .
the half - lives of the three variants discovered from the third round of directed evolution ( dna shuffling ) were 10 to 14 times longer than that of the parent at 60degreesc .
the last round of mutagenesis resulted in three variants that had the longest half - lives of thermal inactivation , 40 to 46 times longer than the parent at 60degreesc , among which , s4 - 3 was the most thermostable enzyme .
the enzymatic properties of the purified s4 - 3 were then studied and its thermo - mechanism was explored .
initial activity vs thermostability of variants in order to determine the relationship between thermostability and enzyme activity , the initial activities of all 12 variants were measured .
as shown in figure 3 , five variants exhibited improved tm as well as higher activity .
the activities of the other 7 variants were not affected much by increased thermostability , among which s3 - 1 , with the lowest activity , still retained about 90 % activity compared to the parent enzyme .
these results provided strong evidence that improvement of thermostability and maintenance of enzyme activity could be simultaneously achieved , and improved thermostability did not occur at the expense of activity at low temperatures [ 32 - 34 ] .
figure 3 initial activity vs t m of the parent and variants .
the cross point of dashed lines and solid lines represent parent enzyme r27rcl .
variants exhibited higher activity and improved tm were squared with solid lines .
the relative activity of the parent taking p npp as substrate was set as 100 % .
enzymatic properties of the thermostable variant s4 - 3 the most thermostable variant in the last generation , s4 - 3 , was purified and its enzymatic properties were investigated .
as shown in figure 4 , the residual activities of s4 - 3 and the parent were determined after incubation at different temperatures for 30 min .
s4 - 3 displayed greatly - increased thermostability in the range of 20degreesc - 60degreesc and retained 50 % residual activity at 67degreesc , whereas the parent started to denature at 40degreesc and was completely inactivated at 60degreesc after 30 min heat - treatment .
figure 4 the effect of temperature on the stability of the parent and s4 - 3 .
the thermal inactivation of s4 - 3 and the parent were characterized by incubation at 60degreesc and 65degreesc ( figure 5 ) .
the thermal inactivation curves of the parent at 60degreesc and 65degreesc were much steeper than those of s4 - 3 , and the half - lives of s4 - 3 at 60degreesc and 65degreesc were 23 - and 46 - fold higher than those of the parent .
in addition , the optimum temperature of s4 - 3 was also increased by 2degreesc compared with that of the parent ( data not shown ) .
figure 5 thermostability of the parent and s4 - 3 at 60degrees c ( a ) and 65degreesc ( b ) .
kinetic parameters of the parent and s4 - 3 towards pnpp were calculated and listed in table 3 .
s4 - 3 exhibited a 32 % decrease in km whereas a 33 % increase in kcat , resulted in almost identical catalytic efficiency kcat / km compared to the parent .
table 3 kinetic parameters of the parent and s4 - 3 enzyme km ( mmol / min / mg ) kcat ( s - 1 ) kcat / km ( m - 1 s - 1 ) r27rcl 0.304 18.9 6.22 x 104 s4 - 3 0.402 25.1 6.24 x 104 thermo - mechanism of s4 - 3 the three - dimensional homology model of r27rcl shows that the five mutations a129s , a230t , s234f , l180h , t218s were all present on the surface of the enzyme and far from the catalytic domain ( s265 - d324 - h377 ) except for the mutation h317p ( figure 6 ) .
it is consistent with the notion that the initial steps in protein unfolding during the irreversible thermal denaturation primarily involve surface - located parts of the protein [ 35,36 ] .
figure 6 three - dimensional structure of r27rcl .
locations of six amino acid substitutions ( a129s , a230t , s234f , l180h , t218s , h317p ) in s4 - 3 were shown in red sticks and the catalytic residues were shown in blue sticks ( in the oval ) .
the contributions of mutations a230t and a129s toward thermostability could be interpreted based on the structure model which located them at the end of alpha - helix and in a loop on the protein surface .
the substitution of a230 for t230 and a129 for s129 may have increased the hydrophilicity and polarity of the protein , which enhanced the thermostability of the enzyme [ 37 ] .
mutation l180h located in a loop on the protein surface introduced a positively - charged residue which may increase protein stability by creating a more favorable surface charge distribution [ 38,39 ] , as found in engineered thermostable cold shock proteins [ 40 ] .
the mutation s234f was located in an alpha - helix on the protein surface .
it was surprising that replacement of an uncharged hydrophilic residue for a nonpolar hydrophobic residue ( s234f ) at the protein surface increased protein stability but this effect has been observed previously [ 40,41 ] .
the h317p mutation is buried inside the protein in a beta - strand .
there are two assumptions that could be made to explain the improved thermostability .
the first assumption was the addition of a hydrophobic residue .
in the stabilized variant s4 - 3 , hydrophilic histidine was replaced by hydrophobic proline , whose side - chain engaged in hydrophobic contacts with the side chain of y293 .
this interaction was further improved by surrounding hydrophobic amino acids such as l137 and v341 and therefore enhanced protein stability .
the alternative explanation was a reduction of the entropy of unfolding .
the proline residue , with its pyrrolidine ring , had the lowest conformational entropy , thus the mutation histidine to proline should decrease the entropy of protein in the unfolded state and stabilize the protein [ 37 ] .
it must be noted that the above - assumed thermo - mechanisms of s4 - 3 have been observed in many evolved thermostable enzymes and naturally - occuring thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins [ 35,42 ] .
determination of the crystal structure of s4 - 3 should further confirm its thermo - mechanism .
but , the crystal structure of r27rcl has not been reported before .
even if it is available , it is still difficult to predict the specific thermostabilizing mutations based on its structure because there are so many structural features that stabilize proteins [ 37 ] and the contribution of each feature to the total free energy of thermostability is quite small .
conclusion p. pastoris proved to be a valuable cell factory for the directed evolution of the lipase from r. chinensis for thermostability improvement , especially when combined with the novel method of library construction described here .
in the present study , the thermostability of r27rcl was improved significantly by two rounds of error - prone pcr and two rounds of dna shuffling in p. pastoris .
the s4 - 3 variant is the most thermostable lipase from rhizopus sp. , under the conditions tested .
compared with the parent r27rcl , the optimum temperature of s4 - 3 was two degrees higher , tm was 22 degrees higher and half - lives at 60degreesc and 65degreesc were 46 - and 23 - times longer , respectively .
moreover , the catalytic efficiency kcat / km of s4 - 3 was comparable to the parent .
in summary , s4 - 3 maintained good catalytic properties and exhibited much greater tolerability and stability at high temperatures , which made this variant a promising candidate for industrial applications at high temperatures .
methods strains , plasmid , reagents and cultures restriction endonucleases , taq dna polymerase were purchased from takara .
all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher quality and purchased from sigma. p. pastoris gs115 ( his - mut +) and the ppic9k expression vector are from invitrogen bv. recombinant plasmid ppic9k - prorcl and strain gs115 / ppic9k - prorcl were constructed by [ yu et al. 10 ] .
the media used in this study include ypd ( 10g / l yeast extract , 20g / l peptone , 20g / l dextrose ) , md ( 13.4g / l ynb , 0.016 mum biotin , 20g / l dextrose ) , bmgy ( 10g / l yeast extract , 20g / l peptone , 10g / l glycerol , ph 6.0 100 mm potassium phosphate , 13.4g / l ynb , 0.016 mum biotin ) , bmmy ( 10g / l yeast extract , 20g / l peptone , 10g / l methanol , ph 6.0 100 mm potassium phosphate , 13.4g / l ynb , 0.016mum biotin ) , bmmya ( 10g / l yeast extract , 20g / l peptone , 5g / l methanol , ph 6.0 100 mm potassium phosphate , 13.4g / l ynb , 0.016 mum biotin , 6g / l agar ) .
production of prorcl variants by error - prone pcr the first two rounds of random mutagenesis of prorcl gene were carried out by error - prone pcr as described elsewhere [ 43 ] .
a 50 mul reaction mixture contained 5 mul pcr gold buffer , 0.7 mm mncl2 , 3 mm mgcl2 , 0.5 mm datp / dgtp , 2.5 mm dctp / dttp , 40 pmol of each primer ( bc - f and bc - r ) , 5 ng of plasmid ppic9k - prorcl , and 2.5 u of taq polymerase .
pcr cycle conditions were : initial denaturation for 3 min at 94degreesc ; followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94degreesc , 30 s of annealing at 55degreesc and 1 min of extension at 72degreesc ; and a 10 min final extension at 72degreesc .
the template for the second round of error - prone pcr used an equimolar mixture of positive variants from the first generation of random mutagenesis .
production of prorcl variants by dna shuffling the last two rounds of random mutagenesis of prorcl gene were carried out by dna shuffling based on the previously methodology reported by [ zhao and arnold 44 ] .
the dna template was an equimolar mixture of positive variants from the former round .
the template was digested with 0.1 u dnase i in 200 mul of 50 mm tris - hcl ph 7.4 , 1 mm mgcl2 for 10 min at 37degreesc .
fragments of 50 - 100 bp were purified by gel extraction ( qiagen ) .
then purified fragments were resuspended in pcr mixture ( without primers ) containing 5 mul pcr gold buffer , 200 mum of each dntp and 1.25 u of taq polymerase .
pcr cycle conditions were : initial denaturation for 3 min at 94degreesc ; followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94degreesc , 30 s of annealing at 45degreesc and 1 min of extension at 72degreesc ; 10 cycles with annealing temperatures of 48degreesc and 51degreesc , respectively ; and a 10 min final extension at 72degreesc .
then , 1 - 3 mul of primerless pcr product was added to a 50 mul pcr mixture with 2 mum primers ( bc - f / bc - r ) .
other pcr conditions were similar to those described above , and a single product comprising full - length prorcl was obtained .
production of his4 3 ' - end containing fragment ( vector fragment a and d ) expression vector fragments were prepared by pcr amplification .
the plasmid ppic9k - prorcl was first amplified using flanking primers a - f / a - r or d - f / d - r to produce vector fragment a or d ( figure 1 ) .
the pcr was carried out in a final volume of 50 mul containing a mixture of 50 ng plasmid ppic9k - prorcl , 1 mum of each primers , 5 mul primestar dna polymerase buffer , 100 mum of each dntp and 1.25 u of primestar dna polymerase .
pcr cycle conditions were : initial denaturation for 3 min at 94degreesc ; followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94degreesc , 30 s of annealing at 50degreesc and 2.5 min or 7.5 min extension at 72degreesc for fragment d or a , respectively ; and a 10 min final extension at 72degreesc .
library construction p. pastoris was transformed with 2 mug of fragments a , d and b / c in a 10:1:1 molar ratio by electroporation according to the protocol reported by [ wu and letchworth 45 ] .
briefly , the competent cells , pretreated with 0.1 m lithium acetate and 10 mm dithiothreitol , were transformed with 2 mug dna fragments by electroporation with instrument settings of 1.5 kv , 25 muf and 186 omega .
transformed yeast colonies appeared in 4 - 6 days at 30degreesc on md plates .
the variants were confirmed by dna sequencing ( sangon biotech company ) .
overlapping sequence length in order to optimise the recombination efficiency , the length of the overlapping sequences between vector and gene fragments was optimized .
it was noteworthy that the lipase gene fragment was be produced by normal pcr ( called l ) instead of ep - pcr .
we generated fragment l using 10 bp , 25 bp , 40 bp , 60 bp , 70 bp and 85 bp of overlapping primers listed in table 4 .
these fragments were mixed with fragment a and d in a 10:1:1 molar ratio and electroporated into p. pastoris .

pre - screening colonies from libraries of each generation were replicated with sterile toothpicks from md plates onto ypd plates ( for the storage of variants ) and bmmya plates ( for gene expression and screening ) , simultaneously .
the parent strain was used as a positive control .
ypd and bmmya plates were then incubated at 28 - 30degreesc for 2 d and 5 d , respectively .
then , bmmya plates from each ep - pcr and dna shuffling generation were subjected to heat - treatment at 45degreesc , 50degreesc , 55degreesc and 65degreesc , respectively , for 60 min .
screening was performed with 15 ml of top agar ( 5g / l ) containing 160 mul of fast blue rr ( 89g / l in dimethyl sulfoxide ) and 80 mul alpha - naphthyl acetate ( 40g / l in dimethyl formamide ) [ 46 ] .
positive colonies exhibited dark brown coloration within two minutes after pouring the top agar and were further screened using the 96 mtps screening method .
screening for evolved variants all positive candidates screened from top - agar staining were picked and cultivated in deep - well microtiter plates containing 900 mul of bmgy medium , at 28degreesc , 300 rpm for 16 h to reach an od600 of 1 .
then , cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g at 4degreesc for 10 min and the cells were suspended in 300 mul of bmmy medium for gene expression .
the cultures were kept at 28degreesc , 300 rpm for 84 h with supply of 100 mul fresh bmmy medium and 10g / l methanol every 24 h. each culture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4degreesc for 10 min .
the supernatant was then transferred into 96 - well microtiter plates for heat - treatment at 60degreesc or 65degreesc for 60 min .
initial and residual lipase activities were measured .
all the assays were done in triplicate and significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) were measured .
only variants that showed both higher ratio of residual activity and similar initial activity compared to the parent enzyme were selected .
enzyme purification a single colony from each variant was cultivated in 100 ml of bmgy medium shaken at 28degreesc and 250 rpm in 500 ml glass flasks .
when cultures reached an od600 of 1 , the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 25 ml of bmmy medium to obtain an od600 of 4 and shaken at 28degreesc and 250 rpm in 250 ml glass flasks for 84 h. the cultures were supplemented with methanol ( 5g / l ) to induce the expression of lipase every 12 h. the culture was then centrifuged and the supernatant was collected for protein purification .
cell free medium was concentrated and interchanged with 10 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.5 ) by ultra filtration through a 10 - kda membrane ( millipore ) .
the concentrated solution was loaded onto a sp - sepharose column ( akta , 1 cm x 20 cm ) equilibrated with 20 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.5 ) and eluted with 0 - 0.5 m nacl in the same buffer .
fractions containing lipase activity were pooled , concentrated and loaded on a phenyl - sepharose 6 ff column ( akta , 1.6 cm x 20 cm ) equilibrated in 50 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.5 ) containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate .
lipase was then eluted in an ammonium sulfate concentration gradient decreasing from 1.6 to 0 m in 50 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.5 ) and 4 ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.8 ml / min .
lipase properties lipase activity was measured on emulsified p - nitrophenyl palmitate ( pnpp ) according to [ kordel et al. 47 ] .
unless stated otherwise , the typical enzymatic reaction was carried out at 40degreesc , ph 8.5 .
one enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 mumol of p - nitrophenol per minute under the assay conditions .
optimal temperature ( topt ) was determined by measuring the enzyme activity at ph 8.5 under various temperatures ( 20 - 60degreesc ) .
tm values were determined as described previously [ 43 ] .
10 u purified enzyme solutions were incubated for 30 min in the temperature range of 20 - 80degreesc , cooled in the ice bath for 20 min and equilibrated at room temperature for 5 min .
then , residual activity was determined at 40degreesc and expressed as a percentage of the initial activity .
the temperature at which 50 % of lipase activity lost was the tm value .
purified enzymes were incubated at specific temperatures ( 60degreesc and 65degreesc ) for half - life ( t1 / 2 ) determination .
10 u purified enzyme solutions were taken at various time intervals , cooled in the ice bath for 20 min and equilibrated at room temperature for 5 min .
then , residual activity was determined and the incubation time at which 50 % of lipase activity lost was the t1 / 2 value .
inactivation was followed until > 80 % of the activity was lost .
the michaelis - menten kinetic parameters kcat and km were calculated using pnpp as substrate .
lineweaver - burk plots were used to determine kcat and km parameters , assuming that the reactions followed a simple michaelis - menten kinetics .
thermo - mechanism analysis a three - dimensional model of r. chinensis lipase was built by swiss - model protein automated modelling program [ 48 ] on the basis of crystal structure of llgy ( crystal structure of lipase ii from rhizopus niveus solved with a resolution of 2.20 a ) [ 49 ] , which showed the highest homology of 80.38 % to r. chinensis lipase .

blurring the boundary between innate and adaptive immune system , natural killer ( nk ) cells are widely recognized as potent anti - leukemia mediators .
alloreactive donor nk cells have been shown to improve the outcome of allogeneic stem - cell transplantation for leukemia .
in addition , in vivo transfer of nk cells may soon reveal an important therapeutic tool for leukemia , if tolerance to nk - mediated anti - leukemia effects is overcome .
this will require , at a minimum , the ex vivo generation of a clinically safe nk cell product containing adequate numbers of nk cells with robust anti - leukemia potential .
ideally , ex vivo generated nk cells should also have similar anti - leukemia potential in different patients , and be easy to obtain for convenient clinical scale - up. moreover , optimal clinical protocols for nk therapy in leukemia and other cancers are still lacking .
these and other issues are being currently addressed by multiple research groups .
this review will first describe current laboratory nk cell expansion and differentiation techniques by separately addressing different nk cell sources .
subsequently , it will address the mechanisms known to be responsible for nk cell alloreactivity , as well as their clinical impact in the hematopoietic stem cells transplantation setting .
finally , it will briefly provide insight on past nk - based clinical trials .
nk cells nk - based immunotherapy acute myeloid leukemia nk cell expansion hematopoietic stem cell transplantation introduction natural killer ( nk ) cells play a key role in the immune response to infections and malignancies by direct cytolysis of infected or transformed cells and by secretion of potent immune mediators .
nk cell killing depends on the overall balance of inhibitory and activating signaling mediated by an array of surface receptors recognizing cognate ligands on putative targets .
besides their lytic activity , nk cells are cytokine - producing cells .
several reports highlight the fact that nk cells are also regulatory cells engaged in reciprocal interactions with dendritic cells , macrophages , t cells , and endothelial cells ( 1 ) .
nk cells have a central role in tumor - cell surveillance ( 2 ) as demonstrated in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) ( 3 - 8 ) .
inhibitory nk receptors with specificity for hla class i antigens are well described .
among these , killer ig - like receptors ( kir ) bind several hla class i ligand groups ( 9 ) , while the cd94 - nkg2a / b heterodimer recognizes hla - e ( 10 ) .
several activating receptors are also described .
activating nkg2d is a major mediator of spontaneous cytotoxic activity .
natural cytotoxicity receptors ( ncrs ) , including three molecules ( i.e. , nkp46 , nkp30 , and nkp44 ) specific for mostly unknown ligands ( 11 , 12 ) , mediate cell lysis of many cancer cells .
escape mechanisms from nk cell surveillance may involve nk cell quantitative deficiency and nk cell functional impairment .
recent studies suggest that nk cell - based immunotherapy may continue to be an effective approach for patients with leukemia and emerging strategies are currently under investigation , initially based on adoptive transfer of nk cells .
this review will first describe current laboratory nk cell expansion and differentiation techniques by separately addressing different nk cell sources .
subsequently , it will address the mechanisms known to be responsible for nk cell alloreactivity .
nk cell differentiation and expansion nk cell expansion and nk cell generation methods successful nk cell immunotherapies require an adequate number of nk cells .
in addition to nk cell number , nk cell purity and function are key factors for a clinically efficacious nk cell product ( 13 ) .
various methods of nk cell expansion have been explored ( 14 ) .
in general , nk cells can be produced from peripheral blood ( pb ) , umbilical cord blood ( ucb ) , bone marrow ( bm ) , embryonic stem cells ( hesc ) , or induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipcs ) .
while short - term nk cell culturing does not normally enhance the functional capabilities for in vivo transferred nk cells , long - term expansion methods may yield large numbers of functional nk cells , which may potentially benefit cancer patients ( 15 ) .
several alternative protocols for nk cell ex vivo expansion for adoptive immunotherapy have been reported to date .
however , only some strategies have been developed under good manufacturing practice ( gmp ) conditions .
in addition , substantial variability in nk cell expansion efficiency , phenotype , and function has been observed among different protocols and among individual donors ( 16 - 20 ) .
expansion of nk cells for clinical purposes isolated from peripheral blood human several protocols for the expansion of pb nk cells are currently available , and others are under development .
various feeder cell - based systems have been used for nk cell expansion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) , including third - party epstein - barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid b cell lines ( ebv - blcl ) , genetically modified k562 cells , or irradiated autologous cells ( 21 - 24 ) .
ex vivo expansion of bulk peripheral nk cells using third - party ebv - blcl feeders approximately yields a 180 - fold nk cell expansion after 2 weeks of culture ( 22 ) .
another expansion technique , yielding clinical valuable amounts of nk cells , is based upon k562 cell feeder double - transduced with il - 15 and 4 - 1bb ( cd137 ) co - stimulatory ligand ( k562 - mb15 - 41bbl ) ( 23 ) .
k562 cells transduced with il - 21 have also been used as feeder cells in nk co - culture systems ( 25 ) .
while k562 - mb15 - 41bbl have been shown to expand and functionally enhance pb nk cells , k562 genetically engineered with membrane - bound il - 21 allow an even higher proliferation and cytotoxicity of expanded nk cells , which also display longer telomeres and less senescence ( 25 ) .
to expand clinimacs - purified pb nk cells , autologous irradiated feeder cells have also been used as feeder cells in culturing systems containing human serum , il - 2 , il - 15 , and anti - cd3 antibody ( 21 ) .
many pb nk expansion strategies hold promise for nk - based immunotherapies .
however , even using identical protocols , nk cell expansion yields and purity are typically inconsistent , and significant donor - to - donor variation is common .
moreover , complete absence of any residual viable tumor feeder in all final cell products is a critical requirement for large - scale nk cell therapy applications and their pharmaceutical translation .
the type of disposable cell culture systems for nk cell culturing also appears to influence the characteristics of the final cell product .
currently used disposable cell culture systems include flasks , bags , or wave ( r ) bioreactors .
compared to flasks , use of bioreactors allow a 10 - fold higher nk cell expansion after 3 weeks of culture ( 26 ) , at the expense of a reduced purity of the final product , which also contains t cells ( cd3 +/ cd56 - ) as well as nkt cells ( cd3 +/ cd56 +) .
presence of t cells limits the application of this cell product to the autologous setting in the absence of downstream t - cell depletion .
nk cell generation from umbilical cord blood umbilical cord blood is thought to be an excellent source for cell therapy applications .
initial work on positively selected cord blood nk cells , cultured on a feeder layer of mesenchymal stromal cells using a combination of il - 2 , il - 15 , flt - 3l , and il - 3 , resulted in a mere 60 - fold median expansion ( 27 ) .
in consideration of the low starting nk cell number in standard cord blood units , this approach is not feasible to generate nk cell numbers needed for a therapeutic nk cell product .
additionally , nk cell differentiation from cd34 + hematopoietic stem cells ( hsc ) has been addressed ( 28 ) .
initially , research in this field focused on the ex vivo generation of nk cells from bm cd34 + cells ( 29 - 33 ) , but later also involved cd34 + cells derived from ucb ( 34 - 39 ) , a particularly rich source of hsc .
these studies used different combinations of growth factor and cytokine mixtures , bm stroma cells , and culture media with or without animal or human sera .
these culture systems generally contain components of animal origin ; moreover , they fail to yield significant numbers of mature nk cells .
for these reasons , it is unlikely that they will be used for clinical applications .
interestingly , the system reported by silva et al. contained human serum without stroma cells and was therefore favored for clinical scaling - up ( 40 ) .
this nk cell expansion method was later abandoned , once stroma cells were recognized as a potential critical component for the enhancement of nk cell proliferation ( 40 ) .
in 2007 , kao et al. showed that serum - free expanded cd34 + cells may be differentiated into a nk cell product with an average purity of 40 - 60 % after 5 - 7 weeks of culture , with a mean expansion rate of 300 - fold .
such expansion , however , was obtained in the presence of fetal bovine serum ( 41 ) .
later on , vitale et al. studied the effects of methylprednisolone on cd34 + precursor cells and their ability to differentiate toward nk cells ( 38 ) .
they performed direct nk cell differentiation - i.e. , no upfront cd34 + expansion - using rpmi - 1640 medium supplemented with human serum , fetal bovine serum , and a cytokine cocktail including il - 15 and il - 21 .
at day 25 , they observed a 10 - fold nk cell expansion , with an average purity of approximately 30 % .
in 2010 , a novel cell culture technology for the ex vivo expansion and nk differentiation of ucb - derived cd34 + cells was developed .
this technique was based upon a clinical - grade serum - free culture medium and a mixture of heparin and cytokines , in order to mimic the extra - cellular matrix bm microenvironment in the absence of feeder cells ( 42 ) .
this method yielded up to 1010 cd34 + cell - derived nk cells , generated in static cell culture bags and automated bioreactors .
importantly , nk cell products were not found to be contaminated by t cells , and may therefore be safely used in the allogeneic setting ( 43 ) .
additionally , nk cells expressed high levels of activating receptors ( e.g. , nkg2d and ncr ) , and are able to efficiently kill myeloid leukemia and melanoma cell lines , as well as primary leukemia blasts .
furthermore , mouse studies have shown that they expand in vivo , initially home to the lung , and later to the blood , lung , spleen , liver , and bm and prevent outgrowth of local tumors in the bm ( 44 ) .
a phase i trial in elderly acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) patients using nk cell products based upon this expansion technique is currently in progress ( ccmo nr. nl31699 and dutch trial register nr. 2818 ) ( 43 ) .
definitely , producing nk cells from cd34 + hematopoietic precursors can be practically advantageous , since stem cells can be isolated and frozen , and can overcome several obstacles posed by purified pb nk cells ( 15 ) .
nk cell generation from human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells in contrast to the cd34 + ucb - derived nk cells , the generation of nk cells from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells is to date largely experimental ( 45 ) .
as previously mentioned , human nk cells can be differentiated from cd34 + hsc under certain culture conditions ( 31 , 35 , 42 ) .
currently , optimizing the generation of cd34 + hsc from hesc and ipsc remains a major challenge to rationally approach hesc - and ipscs - based nk cell therapy ( 45 - 48 ) .
hescs or ipscs derived cd34 + cells are known to be enriched for hematopoietic progenitors defined by colony - forming cells , which could serve as a suitable source for cell therapy ( 47 ) .
some years ago , a method for the efficient generation of functional nk cells from hesc using a two - step procedure was described .
nk cell products contained cytotoxic cells , displayed a mature nk cell phenotype , including cd16 and kir , cd94 / nkg2a , nkp46 , nkp44 , nkg2d , trail , and fasl ( 49 ) .
engineering cd34 + cells , hescs , or ipscs to express chimeric antigen receptors ( car ) specific for tumor - associated antigens is a potentially promising immunotherapeutic strategy ( 48 ) .
nk cell lines for clinical use several authors have reported on the use of nk cell lines for therapeutic purposes .
unlike primary nk cells , whose in vivo life span is limited , nk cell lines are immortal .
however , most nk lines are weakly cytotoxic to cancer targets .
conversely , the nk - 92 cell line ( neukoplast , conkwest , san diego ) has shown to mediate liable cytotoxicity and good expansion kinetics when cultured in bags or bioreactors .
nk - 92 has been well characterized in in vitro and shown to display remarkable anti - tumor activity in severe combined immunodeficiency ( scid ) mouse xenotransplant models ( 50 ) .
furthermore , it has been extensively tested in the clinical setting ( 51 ) .
alteration of nk - mediated cytotoxic response against leukemia the escape of hematological malignancies from nk cell immunity can be explained by general mechanisms involving the quantitative deficiency of nk cells , their qualitative impairments caused by increased inhibition , decreased activation signaling , or by the negative influence of tumor microenvironment .
it is widely recognized that leukemia cells may oppose a variety of immune escape strategies , including immune suppression and phenotypic mimicry , to elude nk - mediated killing .
the balance between activating and inhibitory signals received by nk cells will determine the nk cell - mediated elimination of leukemia cells .
decrease in ligands for activating receptors on leukemia cells could abolish nk cell dependent cytotoxicity .
furthermore , interaction of other ligands with cognate inhibitory receptors on nk cells surface could diminish nk cell killing activity , granule mobilization , and interferon production .
accumulating evidence indicates that chronic and acute leukemia cells could modulate nk cell activity by secreting soluble and exosomal ligands for nk cell receptors ( 52 , 53 ) .
a key strategy used by leukemia cells to escape elimination by nk cells is related to apoptosis , and altered expression of molecules involved in different apoptosis signaling pathways may result in resistance to nk - mediated killing ( 54 - 56 ) .
in this setting , deregulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery , functional blocks of caspase cascade , downregulation or inactivation of proapoptotic molecules , and upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules may all potentially favor leukemia chemoresistance or relapse .
finally , mechanism of nk cell resistance may also include drug resistance .
for example , it has been shown that doxorubicin resistant cells increase expression of hla class i on their surface ( 57 ) .
capturing nk cell alloreactivity in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the last 15 years , growing knowledge of nk tolerance to self , cancer immunosurveillance , and functional licensing has been extensively applied to hct , in an effort to identify donors protecting from leukemia relapse through nk - based alloreactivity .
most studies investigating nk effects on transplantation outcome are rationally based upon one of the following three models : the missing - self recognition paradigm , the missing ligand model , and the activating receptor - based nk cell alloreactivity .
this section addresses the mechanisms known to be responsible for nk cell alloreactivity , as well as their clinical impact in the hsct .
recognition of hla class i antigens by killer immunoglobulin - like receptors the kir gene cluster is mapped on chromosome 19q13.4 , within the 1 mb leukocyte receptor complex ( lrc ) .
it contains four ubiquitous " framework " genes ( one centromeric , kir3dl3 ; one telomeric , kir3dl2 ; and two central , kir3dp1 and kir2dl4 ) that flank centromeric and telomeric gene motifs characterized by extensive variation in both gene content ( type and number ) and polymorphism ( 58 - 60 ) .
based on kir gene content , multiple kir haplotypes are identified , and categorized into two distinct groups , a and b. group a haplotypes contain genes exclusively encoding inhibitory receptors and the activating kir2ds4 , while group b haplotypes contain genes encoding both inhibitory and activating receptors .
both kir a and b haplotypes possess centromeric and telomeric gene content motifs .
products of functional kir genes are type i transmembrane receptors with two ( kir2d ) or three ( kir3d ) highly homologous , extra - cellular immunoglobulin domains ( 61 , 62 , 63 ) .
due to their clonal distribution in the nk repertoire , an individual nk cell may express one or more kir ( 64 , 65 ) .
inhibitory kir may recruit the sh2 - domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 protein ( shp1 ) ( 66 - 69 ) through a single or double immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motif ( itim ) contained in their long cytoplasmic tail ( denoted l , i.e. , kir2dl ; kir3dl ). of several known inhibitory kir , 2dl1 , 2dl2 , 2dl3 , and 3dl1 are particularly relevant for hla class i recognition .
kir2dl1 is specific for hla - c2 group antigens ( sharing the asn77 / lys80 residues in the hla - cw heavy chain ) ; kir2dl2 and kir2dl3 are specific for hla - c1 group antigens ( sharing the ser77 / asn80 in the hla - cw heavy chain ) ( 70 , 71 ) ; and kir3dl1 is specific for hla - bw4 ligands , sharing a group of sequence motifs in residues 77 - 83 of the heavy chain of certain hla - b and hla - a alleles ( 72 - 74 ) .
killer ig - like receptor mediated activating signaling has also been identified .
unlike inhibitory kir , they possess truncated portions that transduce activating signals via tyrosine phosphorylation of dap12 and other proteins ( 75 - 77 ) .
couples of cognate activating and inhibitory kir , sharing almost complete homology ( 95 - 99 %) in their extra - cellular domains , are recognized ( 75 ) .
thus , activating kir2ds1 , kir2ds2 , and kir3ds1 are , respectively , cognate receptors for the hla class i - specific inhibitory kir2dl1 , kir2dl2 , and kir3dl1 .
counter - intuitively , the identification of natural ligands for activating receptors remains largely elusive .
ligands for activating kir2ds2 and kir3ds1 receptors have not been identified .
while it cannot be excluded that these receptors recognize hla class i / peptide complexes , current evidence indicates that they may not affect nk function by generating activating signaling when hla - c1 and hla - bw4 are self - ligands .
unique among activating kir , 2ds1 recognizes hla - c2 group antigens , similar to its inhibitory homolog 2dl1 .
the missing - self recognition paradigm and nk cell alloreactivity inhibitory kir interactions with cognate hla class i ligands play a critical role in nk cell education and tolerance to self .
in normal individuals , nk cells commonly possess kir repertoires including one or more kir with ligand specificity for self - hla class i ligands ( 65 ) .
it is generally believed that such nk cells are rendered functionally competent , or licensed , by continuous signaling generated by inhibitory kir upon interaction with self - hla class i antigens ( 78 , 79 ) .
hla class i is critical to maintain nk tolerance to self , and cells failing to express sufficient levels of hla class i ligands are promptly cleared by nk - mediated cytotoxicity .
this phenomenon , known as missing - self recognition , was first postulated in a report by karre et al. describing that lack of mhc class i ( h2 ) antigen expression rendered mice lymphoma cells highly sensitive to nk - mediated rejection ( 80 ) .
natural killer cells from donor - derived hematopoietic progenitor cells quickly reconstitute in hct recipients ( 81 - 83 ) .
in the hsct setting , hla class i ligands of donor origin are believed to drive functional licensing .
reconstituted nk cells expressing one kir for hla class i present in the donor display stronger in vitro responsiveness than nk cells expressing one kir for hla class i present in the recipient , but absent in the donor ( 84 ) .
additionally , cd107a externalization and ifng production of nk cells reconstituting in recipients of donor unrelated or ucb grafts is markedly increased if they express kir for donor self ( 85 ) .
this donor hla - based nk education model implies , that the size of licensed donor nk cell is shaped by the frequency of inhibitory kir - positive nk cells combined with the presence of cognate hla class i ligands in the donor .
thus , kir2dl1 + nk cells would acquire functional competence if donor is hla - c2 ; kir2dl2 - 3 + nk cells if donor is hla - c1 ; and kir3dl1 + nk cells if donor is positive for hla - a or - b alleles possessing the bw4 motif .
in hla - mismatched hsct , hla - c allele groups ( c1 or c2 ) , and / or the bw4 epitope may be present in the donor and absent in the recipient .
in this situation , the repertoire of licensed donor nk cells may include nk clones mediating missing - self allorecognition against host tissues .
for example , kir2dl1 +/ kir2dl2 - 3 - / kir3dl1 - clones from a hla - c2 positive donor may display allorecognition of missing self in a hla - c2 negative recipient .
recognition of missing self - hla class i may improve the outcome of hsct .
t - cell - depleted haplotype - mismatched grafts from nk alloreactive donors mediate strong graft vs. leukemia ( gvl ) effects in aml recipients , allowing for lower risk of relapse and better survival ( 3 , 4 ) .
while in haplotype - mismatched grafts , the effect of kir - ligand incompatibility is well established , studies on mismatched unrelated hsct reported conflicting results .
in this setting , giebel et al. showed that donor nk cell alloreactivity improves recipient survival ( 86 ) .
a protective effect of kir - ligand incompatibility on post - transplantation relapse was later confirmed in myeloid malignancies ( 87 ) and multiple myeloma ( 88 ) .
however , most studies failed to show a beneficial effect of donor nk cell alloreactivity on the outcome of mismatched unrelated hsct ( 89 - 92 ) .
similarly , studies exploring the clinical impact of nk alloreactivity mediated by kir - ligand mismatch in ucb grafts have yielded variable results ( 93 , 94 ) .
these inconsistent observations are possibly influenced by complex variables , such as donor kir genotype ( 95 ) , disease category , type of conditioning t - cell depletion , post - transplantation immune suppression for graft vs. host disease ( gvhd ) prophylaxis .
for example , t cells may dominate alloreactive phenomena in mismatched unrelated hsct and counteract the clinical benefit of nk alloreactivity ( 91 ) .
accordingly , in vivo t - cell depletion with anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) has been shown ( 86 , 88 , 96 ) to enhance the favorable impact of nk cell alloreactivity on hsct outcome .
the missing ligand model and nk cell alloreactivity killer ig - like receptors and hla genes are mapped on different chromosomes , and segregate independently according to a mendelian inheritance pattern .
therefore , certain individuals may have kir genes but not the corresponding hla / kir - ligand groups ( 97 ) .
kir receptors are clonally distributed on nk cell surface , allowing for the possibility , that subpopulations of nk cells exclusively express kir with ligand specificity for non - self - hla class i ligands .
these nk cells are not classically licensed by self - hla class i ligands during their development , and are believed to be hyporesponsive to stimulation in physiologic conditions .
during post - transplant immune reconstitution , however , this non - licensed status may be transiently suspended during post - transplantation immune reconstitution , and effector functions could indeed be mediated by donor nk cells expressing kir with ligand specificity for non - self - hla class i. an important implication of the missing ligand model is that nk alloreactivity would be observed even in the absence of donor / recipient kir - ligand mismatch , a necessary condition for missing self - mediated nk alloreactivity .
several studies exploring the effect of the missing ligand model on hsct outcome indicate , that donors possessing inhibitory kir but not the corresponding hla class i ligand do mediate beneficial nk effects in hla - identical siblings or hla - matched unrelated recipients ( 5 , 98 - 100 ) .
hsu et al. originally explored a cohort of 178 subjects receiving a t - cell - depleted graft from a hla - identical sibling .
in patients with aml and myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) , lack of one or more hla ligand for donor kir resulted in lower relapse and better survival ( 5 ) .
following the identification of beneficial nk effects in the hla - matched setting , the function of classically non - licensed nk cells has been directly explored in the context of post - transplantation reconstitution .
in t - cell - depleted grafts from hla - identical siblings , nk cells expressing kir for non - self - hla display strong ifngamma production and cytotoxicity to target stimulation during the first trimester post - transplantation ( 101 ) .
these findings have not been confirmed in a cohort of recipients of t cell - replete grafts from hla - identical siblings .
here , reconstituted nk cells expressing kir for non - self - hla ligands displayed tolerance to self .
moreover , lack of self - hla ligands for donor inhibitory kir was found to have no effect on hsct outcome ( 102 ) .
presence or absence of t cells in the graft may differentially affect self - tolerance of non - licensed donor nk cells post - transplantation .
regardless , the interpretation of these conflicting results demands further studies on tolerance to self of donor nk cells reconstituting in the hla - identical host .
activating receptor - based nk cell alloreactivity because ligands for most activating kir are currently unknown , studies reporting associations between activating kir and hsct outcome are not generally supported by the identification of an underlying immunological background mechanistically explaining the observed nk - mediated alloreactivity .
in a cohort of 65 graft recipients from hla - identical siblings , donors with genotypes containing both kir2ds1 and kir2ds2 genes provided protection from relapse ( 103 ) .
donor activating kir was later found to control cmv reactivation post - transplantation .
recipients of t cell - replete grafts were found to have a remarkable reduction of the incidence of cmv reactivation , if donor possessed more than one activating kir genes ( 104 ) .
confirmation of the protective effect against cmv reactivation by donor activating kir was concomitantly reported by another group ( 105 ) .
in 2009 , cooley et al. investigated the effect of different donor kir haplotypes in 448 aml recipients of unrelated t cell - replete hsct .
recipients of kir b / x grafts ( i.e. , homozygous or heterozygous for kir b group haplotypes ) displayed a higher 3 - year - overall survival ( 6 ) .
in a cohort of 1086 aml recipients of unrelated grafts , the same group later compared the contribution to hsct outcome of donor centromeric and telomeric group a and b kir haplotypes .
donors homozygous for centromeric b gene content motifs ( cen b / b ) most strongly associated with low risk of relapse and prolonged survival ( 7 ) .
among activating kir , activating kir2ds2 is mapped on the centromeric region of several b group haplotypes , and may thus mediate the clinical benefit observed for cen b / b donors through interaction with an unknown ligand expressed on leukemia cells ( 7 ) .
recent studies investigated the effect of telomeric activating kir3ds1 and kir2ds1 genes on transplantation outcome .
patients receiving unrelated grafts from kir3ds1 donors exhibited a lower risk for grade ii - iv gvhd and mortality ( 8 , 106 ) .
activating kir2ds1 is found in approximately 1 / 3 caucasians , and commonly occurs in individuals positive for hla - c2 ( c1 / c2 ; c2 / c2 ) ( 107 - 109 ) .
kir2ds1 expression occurs in more than 20 % nk cells ( 109 ) , and 2ds1 single positive ( kir2ds1sp ) nk cells ( i.e. , lacking inhibitory kir expression ) , may also be identified .
in hla - c2 individuals , kir2ds1sp nk cells may potentially display auto - reactivity to normal self - tissues .
compared with hla - c1 donors , kir2ds1sp nk cells from hla - c2 homozygous individuals are hyporesponsive to a hla - c2 positive target cell ( 108 ) .
similarly , mice studies described hyporesponsiveness of activating receptor - positive nk cells resulting from in vivo chronic interaction with a viral ligand ( 110 , 111 ) .
recently , kir2ds1sp nk clones displaying in vitro anti - hla - c2 cytotoxicity have been identified in all hla - c genotypes ( 112 ) .
in c2 : c2 individuals , these clones are significantly reduced in frequency .
in contrast , anti - hla - c2 reactive kir2ds1sp clones from c1 : c2 individuals are common , and functionally indistinguishable to those obtained from hla - c2 negative ( c1 : c1 ) donors ( 112 ) .
these observations indicate that tolerance development is affected by hla - c2 ligand expression density , and are consistent with the " functional nk plasticity " phenomenon described in mice studies ( 113 , 114 ) .
the effect of donor kir2ds1 on hsct outcome has been assessed in a cohort of 1277 aml recipients of unrelated hla - matched or 9 / 10 mismatched hsct .
patients receiving grafts from kir2ds1 donors displayed a decreased rate of leukemia relapse ( 8 ) .
in agreement with experimental findings ( 112 ) , kir2ds1 - mediated protection was observed in hla - c1 ( c1 : c1 and c1 : c2 ) donors , but not in hla - c2 homozygous donors , presumably due to the strong tolerogenic effect on kir2ds1 - positive nk cells mediated by the hla - c2 homozygous genotype ( 8 ) .
nk cell therapy modalities early studies by miller et al. in 2005 have open the way to demonstrate the safety of adoptive transferred human nk cells in patients with aml .
human haplo - identical nk cells could be expanded in vivo and transferred in patients with poor prognosis aml .
patients had to be prepared with an immunosuppressive high dose alkylating and purine analog conditioning regimen they can promote recirculation of infused allogeneic nk cells .
further haplo - identical allogeneic nk cells infusions were applied in patients with poor prognosis hodgkin lymphoma and various solid tumors , i.e. , melanoma ( 115 ) and renal cell carcinoma .
in order to promote nk cell expansion , a lympho - depletion preparative regimen is required for the patient in all studies reported .
to date , adoptive immunotherapy with unstimulated or il - 2 activated nk donor nk cells infusion is used for patients undergoing haplo - identical hematopoietic progenitor cells transplantation to prevent from relapse .
no serious and immediate adverse effects have been observed following allogeneic nk cells infusion .
clinical scale protocols to collect , enrich , and expand purified nk cells are nowadays feasible from cord blood , human donor apheresis , and dedicated cell lines .
these cell therapy procedures remain costly and time consuming .
they need an experimental lab with gmp facilities together with the skills and allowance to perform the cell manipulation .
the currently defined cell product has optimized t - cell depletion to avoid gvhd and allogeneic nk cell expansion ; but we are still lacking a clinical standardized procedure for the use of enriched and expanded nk cells ( 116 ) .
the most common limitation of the procedure remains the inability of collected , enriched , activated , and expanded allogeneic nk cells to expand properly in vivo .
at first , a huge loss of nk cells during the isolation procedure can be seen following t - cell depletion procedure .
then cd56 +/ cd3 - nk cells may be rejected by cytotoxic t cells or suppressed by myeloid - derived suppressor cells or tregs .
to date , ongoing clinical scale protocols aim to both select cd56 +/ cd3 - nk cells and increase drastically the total number of nk cells .
another limitation comes from the use of high dose alkylating chemotherapy - based protocols prior to infusion of nk cells that can increase the toxicity and efficacy of nk cell - based immunotherapy .
infusion of allogeneic nk cells can be performed following standard doses regimen together with immune modulation with steroids and il - 15 .
in the field of bm transplantation , infusion of donor - derived stimulated and expanded cd56 +/ cd3 - allogeneic nk cells may be used in repetitive injections to promote the gvl effect .
further studies have to be designed to enhance the nk cell therapy efficiency : improving the nk cell selection , processing , ex vivo expansion , better designing of lympho - depletion protocols for the patient and infusion rate of nk cells for a optimized control of residual leukemic cells .
conclusion natural killer cells continue to attract a lot of interest in transplantation .
however defects in nk cell cytotoxicity have been observed in all hematological malignancies and the escape of hematological malignancies from nk cell immunity can be explained by general mechanisms .
the latter are common to all immune - effector cells involving the quantitative deficiency of nk cells , their qualitative impairments caused by increased inhibition , or decreased activation signaling .
natural killer cell selection from leukapheretic products is a largely inadequate approach to obtain large numbers of cancer - reactive nk cells .
given the clonal and stochastic distribution of activating and inhibitory receptors on nk cell surface , pools of cancer - reactive nk cells generally represent a minority of the bulk cd3 - , cd56 + population .
several methods for ex vivo nk cell expansion have been attempted to date .
however , none of the described approaches have definitively proved able to effectively circumvent the issue of limited nk cell availability and efficiency .
although an important anti - tumor role for alloreactive nk cells has been shown in patients with aml either after stem - cell transplantation or adoptive transfer of haplo - identical nk cells , their clinical efficacy in human trials has been modest , presumably due to tumor escape by alteration of nk cell function and resistance to killing .
in this respect , the ability to manipulate not only the balance of activating and inhibitory receptors on nk cells but also their cognate ligands , as well as the sensitivity of tumor cells to apoptosis , opens new perspectives in nk cell - based immunotherapy .
sensitization of tumor cells to activated cytotoxic lymphocytes by up - regulating either tnf death receptors or effector - activating ligands on tumor cells combined with immunotherapy has been pursued to overcome tumor - cell resistance and establishes an effective anti - tumor response .
another therapeutic approach to enhance nk cell cytotoxicity is the use of cytokines , such as il - 2 , il - 12 , and il - 18 .
chemokine manipulation is also of interest as molecules may both attract nk to the tumor - cell microenvironment and stimulate their cytotoxic properties .
another attractive approach to enhance nk cytotoxicity is to use monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) .
iph - 2101 , a fully human igg4 anti - kir mab ( developed by innate pharma ) is currently being tested in phase i and ii clinical trials in patients with aml and multiple myeloma ( 117 ) .
its blockade of inhibition could allow nk cell activation when activating ligands are present on target cells .
it should also be emphasized that bispecific mabs directed against both the target cells and nk cells are also currently under investigation .
anti - cd20 mabs that have enhanced affinity for cd16 have been also developed , and they are more effective at nk activation than rituximab ( 118 ) .
one limitation of the use of nk cells is due to the great capacity of leukemic cells to escape to nk recognition and killing .
this resistance remains indeed a drawback in immunotherapy of hematological malignancies .
in this regard , adoptive transfer of polyclonal or clonal nk cells with mismatch nk inhibitory receptors and hla class i ligands would produce gvl ( gvhd ) in the absence of gvhd .
the simultaneous differentiation of the effective killer effectors , the boosting of nk function , their expansion , and the sensitization of leukemic targets will offer potential opportunities in the treatment of hematological malignancies .
therefore , how to expand ucb stem cells for optimal downstream generation of terminally differentiated nk cells potentially alloreactive to leukemic cells is at present very challenging .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

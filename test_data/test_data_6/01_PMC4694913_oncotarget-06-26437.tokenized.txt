the prostanoid thromboxane ( tx ) a2 is increasingly implicated in neoplastic progression , including prostate cancer ( pca ) .
mechanistically , we recently identified protein kinase c - related kinase ( prk ) 1 as a functional interactant of both the tpalpha and tpbeta isoforms of the human t prostanoid receptor ( tp ) .
the interaction with prk1 was not only essential for tpalpha / tpbeta - induced pca cell migration but also enabled the txa2 - tp axis to induce phosphorylation of histone h3 at thr11 ( h3thr11 ) , an epigenetic marker both essential for and previously exclusively associated with androgen - induced chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activation .
prk1 is a member of a subfamily of three structurally related kinases comprising prk1 / pknalpha , prk2 / pkngamma and prk3 / pknbeta that are widely yet differentially implicated in various cancers .
hence , focusing on the setting of prostate cancer , this study investigated whether tpalpha and / or tpbeta might also complex with prk2 and prk3 to regulate their activity and neoplastic responses .
while tpalpha and tpbeta were found in immune complexes with prk1 , prk2 and prk3 to regulate their activation and signalling , they do so differentially and in a tp agonist - regulated manner dependent on the t - loop activation status of the prks but independent of their kinase activity .
furthermore , txa2 - mediated neoplastic responses in prostate adenocarcinoma pc - 3 cells , including histone h3thr11 phosphorylation , was found to occur through a prk1 - and prk2 - , but not prk3 - , dependent mechanism .
collectively , these data suggest that txa2 acts as both a neoplastic and epigenetic regulator and provides a mechanistic explanation , at least in part , for the prophylactic benefits of aspirin in reducing the risk of certain cancers .
thromboxane receptor cancer prostate protein kinase c - related kinase introduction the prostanoid thromboxane ( tx ) a2 , synthesized from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of cyclooxygenase ( cox ) - 1 / cox - 2 and txa2 synthase predominantly in platelets and macrophages , plays a central role within the vasculature dynamically regulating platelet activation status and vascular tone [ 1 , 2 ] .
txa2 is also a potent pro - inflammatory and pro - mitogenic mediator promoting smooth muscle cell proliferation and restenosis in response to endothelial damage / vessel injury .
in keeping with this , dysregulation of the levels of txa2 , its txa2 synthase and its t prostanoid receptor ( the tp ) are implicated in a range of cardiovascular diseases [ 1 , 2 ] .
hence , inhibiting txa2 synthesis , action or both through use of aspirin or tp antagonists is a key therapeutic strategy in the management of many diseases involving txa2 , including atherothrombosis and acute coronary syndrome. by now , numerous studies have demonstrated increased expression of cox - 1 and cox - 2 and of their prostanoid metabolites in a range of cancers [ 3 ] .
in support of this , several longitudinal studies show that long - term daily use of aspirin reduces the risk of many prevalent cancers including of the colon , oesophagus , lung and prostate [ 4 - 6 ] .
while such studies do not specify which cox - metabolite ( s ) are affected by aspirin to account for its prophylactic benefits , particular attention has recently been directed to the role of txa2 , txa2 synthase and its t prostanoid receptor / tp in various neoplasms [ 7 ] .
for example , in addition to cox - 2 , increased levels of txa2 and expression of txa2 synthase and of the tp have been strongly correlated with bladder and colorectal cancer [ 8 - 10 ] and with non - small cell lung cancer , where txa2 is the main tumour - promoting cox - 2 metabolite [ 11 - 13 ] .
increased expression of cox - 2 , txa2 synthase and of the tp has also been widely implicated in prostate cancer , with direct correlation of protein expression with gleason score and pathologic stage [ 14 , 15 ] .
within the cancer tissue , expression of txa2 synthase and the tp localizes to areas of perineural invasion , a recognized mechanism whereby prostate cancer cells penetrate the prostatic capsule and spread to other tissues [ 7 , 14 ] .
in humans and other primates , txa2 signals through two structurally related receptor isoforms , referred to as tpalpha and tpbeta , that differ exclusively in their carboxyl - terminal ( c ) - tail domains [ 16 ] .
while tpalpha and tpbeta are encoded by the same gene ( the tbxa2r ) , they are differentially expressed in a range of cell / tissue types and are under the transcriptional regulation of two distinct promoters designated prm1 and prm3 , respectively [ 17 - 23 ] .
consistent with this , in the setting of prostate and breast cancer , the tumour suppressors wilms' tumour ( wt ) - 1 and hypermethylated in cancer ( hic ) - 1 bind to cis - elements within prm1 to regulate tpalpha expression [ 24 ] .
however , the factors regulating tpbeta in those clinical settings remain to be identified .
functionally , as members of the g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) superfamily , tpalpha and tpbeta primarily couple to galphaq - phospholipase ( pl ) cbeta and to galpha12 - rhoa activation [ 25 , 26 ] .
in addition , tpalpha and tpbeta both lead to similar activation of the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase ( erk ) and phosphatidylinositol 3'kinase ( pi3'k ) signalling cascades [ 27 - 29 ] , but undergo distinct mechanisms of agonist - induced homologous [ 30 , 31 ] and heterologous desensitization [ 32 - 34 ] .
hence , mechanistically , in the context of cancer , it is proposed that tp - mediated rhoa activation plays a critical role in the txa2 - induced tumour cell migration and metastasis while its ability to regulate the pi3'k and erk cascades , including transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , may account for the influence of txa2 on tumour cell proliferation / mitogenesis [ 7 , 26 - 29 ]. through additional mechanistic studies , we recently discovered that both tpalpha and tpbeta directly interact with and regulate signalling by protein kinase c - related kinase ( prk ) 1 [ 35 ] , a rhoa effector widely implicated in prostate cancer .
the prks , also referred to as protein kinase novel ( pkn ) , constitute a subfamily of three structurally related yet functionally distinct ser / thr agc kinases comprising prk1 / pknalpha , prk2 / pkngamma and prk3 / pknbeta [ 36 ] , downstream of rhoa and p13'k / pdk - 1 signalling [ 37 , 38 ] .
however , while structurally related , the individual prks are functionally distinct and are each recognized as promising chemotherapeutic targets with several clinical trials underway , particularly for pancreatic and prostate cancers [ 39 , 40 ] .
for example , prk2 / pkngamma was recently implicated in triple negative breast cancer [ 41 ] and in controlling the migration and invasion of bladder tumour cells [ 42 ] .
prk3 / pknbeta is required for invasive prostate cancer growth downstream of rhoc / pi3'k [ 43 , 44 ] and atu027 , a sirna - liposome complex targeting prk3 , has advanced to phase ii clinical trials for pancreatic cancer [ 40 ] .
due to its ability to directly interact with and be activated by the androgen receptor ( ar ) , prk1 / pknalpha has been strongly implicated in androgen - associated prostate cancer and in ovarian serous carcinoma [ 45 - 47 ] .
in fact , by catalyzing histone h3 thr11 phosphorylation in response to ar activation , prk1 has been dubbed a " gate - keeper " of androgen - induced transcriptional activation and , therefore , of androgen - driven prostate cancer .
hence , prk1 is now recognized as a key target in androgen - responsive prostate cancer , including in castrate - resistant prostate cancer ( crpc ) , the metastatic and lethal form of the disease that occurs following androgen deprivation therapy [ 47 - 49 ] .
as stated , we recently identified prk1 as a highly specific interactant of both tpalpha and tpbeta [ 35 ] .
critically , the interaction was found to be functionally important not only in mediating txa2 - induced migratory responses but also revealed that , similar to that which occurs for the ar , signalling through prk1 enables the txa2 - tp axis to induce chromatin remodeling ( histone h3 thr11 phosphorylation ) in the prostate cancer pc - 3 cell line and , in addition , to both mimic and augment androgen - induced responses in the lncap cell line [ 35 ] .
this was the first demonstration that agents other than androgens , in this case txa2 , can induce histone h3 thr11 phosphorylation , a prk1 - catalysed epigenetic marker essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation including in crpc [ 47 - 49 ] .
therefore , given the increasing evidence of the link between elevated txa2 signalling and tp expression with various cancers including , but not limited to prostate cancer , coupled with the recognized role of the galpha12 - mediated rhoa / prk1 signalling cascade in cancer , discovery of a direct , functional interaction between tpalpha and tpbeta with prk1 [ 35 ] provided an additional , previously unknown , mechanistic explanation for the " link between the cox - 1 / 2 derived metabolite txa2 and certain prevalent cancers " .
however , that study was confined to prk1 [ 35 ] .
hence , owing to the clear mechanistic and functional differences between the individual prks , be it prk1 / pknalpha , prk2 / pkngamma and prk3 / pknbeta , combined with the increasing recognition of the importance of the txa2 - tp axis in various cancers , it was deemed imperative to investigate whether tpalpha and / or tpbeta might also associate with and , thereby , regulate signalling by prk2 or prk3 .
hence , focusing on the setting of prostate cancer , the aim of this study was to explore whether tpalpha and / or tpbeta might also complex with and regulate the activity , neoplastic ( proliferative and migratory ) responses and , potentially , histone h3 thr11 phosphorylation through prk2 and prk3 .
we reveal that while tpalpha and tpbeta are found in functional complexes with prk1 , prk2 and prk3 to regulate prk activation status and signalling , they do so differentially and in a tp agonist - regulated manner and dependent on the t - loop activation status of the prks but independent of their kinase activity .
furthermore , we show that txa2 - mediated neoplastic responses in prostate adenocarcinoma pc - 3 cells , including histone h3 thr11 phosphorylation , occurs through a prk1 - and prk2 - , but not prk3 - , dependent mechanism .
results association of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 with tpalpha and tpbeta prk1 was recently identified as a highly specific and functionally important interacting partner of both tpalpha and tpbeta in prostate cancer cells [ 35 ] .
hence , focusing on the setting of prostate cancer , the aim of this study was to investigate whether tpalpha and / or tpbeta might associate with and regulate the activity , including neoplastic responses , through prk2 / pkngamma and prk3 / pknbeta , agc kinases that like prk1 / pknalpha act downstream of rhoa and pi3'k / pdk1 oncogenic signalling .
to begin , the ability of prk1 , prk2 or prk3 to form complexes with tpalpha and tpbeta in the metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma pc - 3 cell line was investigated through co - immunoprecipitations using anti - tpalpha and anti - tpbeta isoform - specific antibodies [ 26 , 29 ] .
consistent with previous findings [ 35 ] , prk1 was detected in complexes with both tpalpha and tpbeta , but not in control pre - immune igg immunoprecipitates ( figure 1a ) .
for prk2 , it was found in tpbeta but not in tpalpha immune - complexes ( figure 1a ) .
in contrast , prk3 did not complex with either tpalpha or tpbeta in pc - 3 cells , despite its expression , albeit at lower levels than prk1 or prk2 ( figure 1a ) , and despite using increased protein input in the assays ( data not shown ) .
figure 1 association of prk1 and prk2 with tpalpha and tpbeta in prostate pc - 3 cells panel a. pc - 3 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti - tpalpha , anti - tpbeta or , as controls , with the pre - immune ( igg ) sera .
thereafter , immunoprecipitates ( upper panels ) or equivalent aliquots of whole cell lysates ( 20 mug / lane , lower panels ) were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - prk1 , anti - prk2 or anti - prk3 antisera .
the relative positions of the molecular size markers ( kda ) are indicated to the left of the panels .
data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments ( n >= 3 ) .
panel b. pc - 3 cells were incubated with u46619 ( 1 mum ; 0 - 60 min ) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti - tpalpha , anti - tpbeta or , as controls , with the pre - immune ( igg ) sera .
thereafter , immunoprecipitates ( upper panels ) or equivalent aliquots of whole cell lysates ( 20 mug / lane , lower panels ) were ib with anti - prk1 , anti - prk2 or anti - prk3 antisera .
data n >= 3 .
panel c. bar charts show the mean relative levels of prk1 or prk2 associated with the anti - tpalpha or anti - tpbeta immunoprecipitates , as determined by quantitative densitometry (+/ - sem ) , where levels associated with the respective immunoprecipitates in the absence of agonist are expressed as 1 .
the asterisks indicate where u46619 stimulation resulted in significant changes in complex - associated prk1 or prk2 , where * and ** indicate p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 , respectively .
thereafter , the influence of receptor activation on complex formation between the individual tps and prks was investigated using the highly selective tp agonist u46619 .
upon stimulation with u46619 for 0 - 60 min , levels of prk1 associated with tpalpha and tpbeta in complexes from pc - 3 cells were not significantly altered relative to constitutive / basal levels , in the absence of agonist ( figure 1b & 1c ) .
in contrast , the association of prk2 with both tpalpha and tpbeta was regulated in a time - dependent manner in response to u46619 ( figure 1b & 1c ) .
in the absence of agonist , prk2 was found in complex with tpbeta , but not with tpalpha ( figure 1b & 1c ) .
in response to u46619 , prk2 transiently complexed with tpalpha following 10 min stimulation , which diminished upon prolonged treatment for 60 min ( figure 1b & 1c ) .
in contrast , while prk2 complexed with tpbeta in the absence of agonist , u46619 led to dissociation of the complex at 10 min , but at 60 min , levels of the tpbeta : prk2 complex were restored to that observed in the absence of agonist ( figure 1b & 1c ) .
in the case of prk3 , it did not complex with tpalpha or tpbeta in pc - 3 cells either constitutively or following tp stimulation ( figure 1b ) .
to explore the possibility that the associations , or lack - of , between tpalpha and tpbeta with the prks might be cell - type specific , tp : prk complex formation was also examined in hek293 cell lines that over - express tpalpha ( hek.tpalpha cells ) or tpbeta ( hek.tpbeta cells ) and the individual prks [ 33 - 35 ] .
consistent with findings in pc - 3 cells , prk1 strongly associated with both tpalpha and tpbeta and the nett - association was not significantly altered in response to agonist - stimulation ( figure 2a , & 2c ) .
furthermore , while prk2 did not associate constitutively with tpalpha , stimulation with u46619 for 10 min led to its transient association which was lost at 60 min post - stimulation ( figure 2a , & 2c ) , while the constitutive association of prk2 with tpbeta was lost at 10 min but restored at 60 min post - agonist stimulation ( figure 2a , & 2c ) .
in the case of prk3 , unlike that which occurred in pc - 3 cells , it complexed constitutively with both tpalpha and tpbeta and in an agonist - regulated manner in the hek293 cell lines .
specifically , the constitutive association of prk3 with tpalpha was lost at 10 min but restored following u46619 stimulation for 30 min or 60 min ( figure 2a , & 2c ) .
for tpbeta , its constitutive association with prk3 observed in the absence of agonist was largely unaffected following u46619 - stimulation ( figure 2b , & 2c ) .

immunoprecipitates ( ip ) were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - flag or anti - ha ( upper and middle panels , respectively ) .

to verify uniform expression of the prks , aliquots of the whole cell lysates ( 20 mug / lane ) were ib with anti - flag antiserum ( lower panels ) .
the inset panels show long duration exposures of the anti - flag - prk3 immunoblots of the immunoprecipitates from hek.tpalpha and hek.tpbeta cells .
data n >= 3 .
structurally , the prks contain three highly conserved regions including an n - terminal rho binding domain ( rbd ) , a centrally located arachidonic acid - sensitive c2 - like auto - inhibitory domain and a c - terminal catalytic kinase domain [ 36 , 50 ] .
to investigate whether the observed associations may involve direct association ( s ) between the tps and prks , immune complexes generated between tpalpha and tpbeta with the prks or with their corresponding rbd , rbd + c2 or kinase subdomains were investigated , including in response to short - term agonist - activation with u46619 ( figure 2d & 2e & supplemental figure 1 ) .
consistent with previous findings [ 35 ] , prk1 associated with tpalpha and tpbeta predominantly via its carboxy - terminal region incorporating its c2 - like domain and catalytic kinase domain , while no association occurred with the n - terminal rbd .
while the association of both tpalpha and tpbeta with the full length prk1 was largely unaffected by the activation status of the tps , some differences were observed in their association with the c - terminal domains as a function of agonist stimulation ( figure 2d & 2e ) .
for prk2 , consistent with findings in pc - 3 cells ( figure 1b ) , while it did not associate with tpalpha under basal conditions , it did so in an agonist - dependent manner but , unlike that of prk1 , required expression of the entire prk2 for association ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast and consistent with findings in pc - 3 cells ( figure 1b ) , prk2 associated with tpbeta in the absence of agonist through an association requiring the entire prk2 protein but following short - term agonist stimulation , it dissociated from the tpbeta complex ( figure 2e ) .
in the case of prk3 , while it associated with tpalpha under constitutive / basal conditions through an association dependent , at least in part , on its c - terminal c2 and kinase domains , the interaction with the kinase domain was substantially weaker requiring extended exposures for detection and diminished in response to short - term agonist activation of tpalpha ( figure 2d & 2e , & insets ) .
finally , although prk3 associated with tpbeta again through an association dependent on its c - terminal c2 and , in part , on its kinase domain , some differences were observed in their associations as a function of agonist stimulation .
hence , these data show that while both prk1 and prk3 may associate with tpalpha and tpbeta via their c - terminal c2 and kinase domains , the association between the tps with prk2 requires the presence of the complete enzyme .
furthermore , the agonist - regulated interaction between tpalpha and tpbeta with prk1 , prk2 and prk3 is both unique , but entirely consistent with previous data ( figure 1b , 2a & 2b ) .
collectively , these data ( figure 1 & 2 ) confirm a constitutive association between prk1 and tpalpha / tpbeta which is not substantially regulated in response to receptor stimulation .
in addition , while prk2 may associate with tpbeta , but not tpalpha , in the absence of agonist , both these associations are dynamically regulated in response to receptor activation .
in the case of prk3 , while no complex was observed between tpalpha or tpbeta in pc - 3 cells , studies in hek293 cells show that specific complexes can occur , and which are regulated in an agonist - dependent manner .
influence of tp agonist stimulation on the activation status of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 in addition to directly associating with prk1 , agonist - activation of tpalpha and tpbeta increases the activity of prk1 [ 35 ] .
the prk family of rhoa effectors undergo activation through phosphoinositide - dependent kinase ( pdk ) - 1 phosphorylation of a critical thr within their kinase activation loops ( t - loop phosphorylation ) in response to upstream pi3'k / pdk - 1 signalling [ 37 , 38 ] .
hence , an anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 antibody which recognises the phosphorylated , activated prks was used to monitor prk1 - 3 activation status in pc - 3 cells in response to stimulation with u46619 .
in the absence of agonist , no significant basal phosphorylation of the prks was detected ( figure 3a & 3b ) .
upon stimulation with u46619 for 10 - 60 min , there was a rapid appearance of a doublet band detected by the anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 , which co - migrated with species corresponding to the activated forms of prk1 ( lower band ) and prk2 ( upper band ) ( figure 3a & 3b ) .
the identity of the prks and specificity of the phospho - prk antibody was demonstrated through use of silencing ( si ) rnas whereby specific knockdown of prk1 and prk2 , but not prk3 , impaired detection of the u46619 - induced phosphorylated prk1 and prk2 species , respectively ( figure 3c & supplemental figure 2a ) .
in addition , all data were validated using at least two independent sirnas to each of prk1 - 3 ( supplemental figure 2b ) .
thereafter , the involvement of the upstream kinases , pi3'k and pdk - 1 , in the tp - mediated activation of prk1 and prk2 , was confirmed whereby inhibition of pi3'k and pdk - 1 , but not of the second messenger - regulated protein kinase ( pk ) a or pkc , impaired t - loop phosphorylation / activation of prk1 and prk2 in response to u46619 stimulation ( figure 3a & 3b ) .
in addition , inclusion of the pan - prk inhibitor pkc412 impaired the sustained t - loop phosphorylation / activation of prk1 and prk2 in response to u46619 stimulation ( figure 3a & 3b ) .
furthermore , u46619 - induced prk1 and prk2 activation in pc - 3 cells was both time and concentration dependent , where stimulation of cells with 250 nm u46619 for 60 min was found to be optimal ( supplemental figure 3 ) , while pre - incubation with the selective tp antagonist sq29,548 inhibited the u46619 - induced prk activation further confirming tp specificity ( supplemental figure 3 ) .
figure 3 influence of tp agonist on the activation of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 panel a. pc - 3 cells , serum - starved ( 0 % fbs , 16 hr ) , were pre - incubated for 30 min with the listed protein kinase inhibitors or , as controls , with drug vehicle ( 0.001 % dmso ) prior to stimulation with u46619 ( 1 mum ) or vehicle ( 0.01 % etoh ) for 0 , 10 or 60 min .
cells were harvested and aliquots ( 20 mug / lane ) were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 ( t - loop phosphorylation ) and thereafter with anti - hdj2 antisera to verify equal protein loading .

panel c. in order to identify the species of prk subject to u46619 - induced t - loop phosphorylation , pc - 3 cells were initially transfected for 72 hr with 30 nm sirnaprk1 , sirnaprk2 , sirnaprk3 or , as controls , with a scrambled sirnacontrol .
thereafter , cells were serum starved and stimulated with u46619 for 60 min or with vehicle and then immunoblotted ( 20 mug / lane ) with anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 and with anti - prk1 , anti - prk2 , anti - prk3 or , as loading controls , hdj2 antisera , as indicated .
panel d. hek.tpalpha or hek.tpbeta cells , transiently co - transfected with flag - tagged prk1 , prk2 or prk3 and serum - starved ( 0 % fbs , 16 hr ) , were stimulated with u46619 ( 1 mum ) or vehicle ( 0.01 % etoh ) for 0 , 10 or 60 min .
cells were harvested and aliquots ( 20 mug / lane ) immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 and thereafter , to verify equal protein loading , with anti - hdj2 antisera .
data n >= 3 .

the asterisks indicate where u46619 stimulation resulted in significant changes in activation , where ** and *** indicate p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 , respectively .
while tp - mediated prk3 activation did not occur in pc - 3 cells , it was confirmed that the anti - phospho - prk1thr774 / prk2thr816 / prk3thr718 antibody can detect prk3 when over - expressed in hek293 cells ( supplemental figure 4 ) .
thereafter , tpalpha and / or tpbeta - induced activation of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 was investigated in the hek293 cell lines over - expressing tpalpha or tpbeta and the individual prks .
consistent with findings in pc - 3 cells , both prk1 and prk2 but also prk3 underwent substantial t - loop phosphorylation in response to agonist - induced activation of tpalpha and tpbeta ( figure 3d ) .
furthermore , inhibition of pi3'k and pdk - 1 impaired t - loop phosphorylation of the prks in response to agonist - activation of both tpalpha and tpbeta ( supplemental figure 5 ) .
collectively , these data establish that agonist - activation of both tpalpha or tpbeta leads to rapid and sustained t - loop phosphorylation of the prk isozymes and which occurs through a pi3'k / pdk1 - dependent mechanism .
role of the kinase activity and activation status of the prks on their association with tpalpha and tpbeta findings herein have established that the association and t - loop activation status of the prks with tpalpha / tpbeta are dynamically regulated in response to agonist - induced receptor activation .
hence , it was next sought to investigate whether the activity and / or the activation status of the prks may play a role in their respective agonist - regulated associations with tpalpha and tpbeta .
for this end , the ability of either the wild - type , kinase - defective ( prk1k644e , prk2k686e , prk3k588e ) , or t - loop phosphorylation - defective ( prk1t774a , prk2t816a , prk3t718a ) forms of prk1 - 3 to form complexes with either tpalpha or tpbeta was investigated in hek.tpalpha and hek.tpbeta cells , respectively .
the level and pattern of agonist - regulated associations of each of the kinase - defective prk variants with either tpalpha or tpbeta was not significantly different from those of the wild - type prk1 - 3 ( figure 4a - 4d ) .
in the case of the t - loop phosphorylation defective prk variants , in the absence of agonist , prk1t774a was capable of associating with tpalpha and tpbeta ( figure 4a & 4c ; t774a ) .
however , in response to u46619 stimulation , the association of prk1t774a with both tpalpha and tpbeta was lost / diminished in a time - dependent manner , being decreased at 10 min and further reduced or absent following prolonged stimulation ( figure 4a & 4c ; t774a ) .
furthermore , neither prk2t816a nor prk3t718a associated with tpalpha or tpbeta complexes , either in the absence of agonist or upon tp stimulation ( figure 4a & 4c ; t816a & t718a ) .
figure 4 influence of kinase activity and t - loop activation of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 on their agonist - regulated interaction with tpalpha and tpbeta panels a & c. hek 293 cells stably over - expressing ha - tagged tpalpha ( panel a ) or tpbeta ( panel c ) and co - transfected with flag - tagged wild type ( wt ) , mutated kinase dead / dominant negative ( k - - > e ) or t - loop activation loop defective ( t - - > a ) forms of prk1 , prk2 or prk3 were incubated with u46619 ( 1 mum ; 0 - 60 min ) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti - ha antibody .
immunoprecipitates ( ip ) were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - flag or anti - ha ( upper and middle panels , respectively ) .
to verify uniform expression of the prks , aliquots of the whole cell lysates ( 20 mug / lane ) were ib with anti - flag antibody ( lower panels ) .
data n >= 3 .
panels b & d. bar charts show the mean relative levels of the prks associated with the anti - ha immunoprecipitates , as determined by quantitative densitometry (+/ - sem ) , where levels in the absence of agonist are expressed as 1 .

taken together , these data indicate that while the kinase activity per se does not influence the association of the prks with tpalpha / tpbeta , their t - loop phosphorylation , a measure of their activation status , is critical in determining the ability of the prks to associate or complex with tpalpha and tpbeta .
in addition , while previous reports [ 35 ] indicated that the tp : prk1 association was not regulated in response to tp stimulation , data herein involving the t - loop phosphorylation - defective prk1t774a suggest that sustained association of prk1 with both tpalpha and tpbeta is dependent on its activation status .
influence of tp agonist - activation on prk1 / 2 / 3 - mediated pc - 3 cell proliferation and migration the prk isozymes each play an essential role in neoplastic processes , including in cancer cell proliferation , migration and invasion [ 42 , 43 ] .
in addition , disruption of prk1 expression impairs tp - mediated pc - 3 cell migration [ 35 ] .
hence , herein , the influence of the individual prks on tp - mediated prostate cancer cell responses , including cell proliferation , anchorage - independent growth ( colony formation ) and migration was investigated .
stimulation with u46619 led to time - and concentration - dependent increases in proliferation , colony formation and migration of pc - 3 cells with optimal responses occurring at 10 - 50 nm u46619 in all cases ( supplemental figure 6 ) .
furthermore , the specificity that u46619 mediated these effects through the tp was confirmed whereby the selective tp antagonist sq29,548 blocked each of these u46619 - induced responses in pc - 3 cells ( supplemental figure 6 ) .
to determine the role of the individual prks on tp - mediated prostate cancer cell responses , the effect of sirna - targeted disruption of the individual prks on u46619 - induced responses in pc - 3 cells was examined .
specific sirna - disruption of both prk1 and prk2 expression in pc - 3 cells significantly impaired u46619 - induced cell proliferation , colony formation and cell migration , while sirna - disruption of prk3 or control scrambled sirna sequences had no effect on these u46619 - induced responses ( figures 5a - 5c ) .
the specificity of the individual sirna sequences to specifically disrupt prk1 , prk2 and prk3 expression , and for prolonged periods ( up to 6 day post - transfection ) , was confirmed through western blotting ( figure 5d & supplemental figure 2 ) .

influence of tp agonist - activation on prk1 / 2 / 3 - mediated histone h3thr11 phosphorylation it has been recently established that agonist - activation of tpalpha and tpbeta can , in turn , lead to prk1 - catalysed h3thr11 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells , representing the first demonstration that agents other than androgens can induce this key epigenetic modification and recognized gate - keeper of androgen - induced transcriptional activation [ 35 , 47 ] .
hence , given our demonstration that the tps may also associate with and modulate the activity and downstream signalling of the prks , including neoplastic responses , it was sought to explore whether tp - mediated activation of prk2 and / or prk3 may also lead to phosphorylation of h3thr11 in pc - 3 cells .
u46619 - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation was analysed using a specific anti - phospho - h3thr11 antibody , where pc - 3 cells growth - arrested in metaphase with colcemid served as a positive control for h3thr11 phosphorylation ( supplemental figure 7a ) .
consistent with previous data ( supplemental figure 6 ) , 50 nm u46619 was the optimal agonist concentration required to induce h3thr11 phosphorylation through the tps ( supplemental figure 7a ) .
furthermore , stimulation of pc - 3 cells with 50 nm u46619 led to a time - dependent increase in h3thr11 phosphorylation and the selective tp antagonist sq29,548 specifically inhibited the u46619 - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation , confirming tp specificity ( supplemental figure 7b ) .
in addition , treatment with the vehicle alone did not bring about an increase in h3thr11 phosphorylation ( supplemental figure 7b ) .
specific sirna - disruption of both prk1 and prk2 expression in pc - 3 cells significantly impaired u46619 - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation , while sirna - disruption of prk3 or sirna scrambled control sequences had no effect ( figure 6 ) .
in all cases , rescreening of the anti - phospho - h3thr11 blots with anti - histone h3 antibody confirmed that any differences in h3thr11 phosphorylation were not due to discrepancies in histone h3 levels ( figure 6 ) .
figure 6 effect of tp agonist stimulation on prk - mediated h3thr11 phosphorylation in pc - 3 cells pc - 3 cells were transfected for 72 hr with 30 nm sirnaprk1 , sirnaprk2 , sirnaprk3 or , as controls , with a scrambled sirna ( sirnacontrol ) prior to stimulation with u46619 ( 50 nm ; 0 - 240 min ) or vehicle ( 0.0005 % etoh ) , where non - transfected cells served as a reference .
as a positive reference for h3thr11 phosphorylation , cells were growth - arrested by treatment with colcemid ( 50 ng / ml ) for 24 hr. in all cases , extracted histones were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - phospho - h3thr11 ( upper panels ) and back - blotted with anti - histone h3 ( lower panels ) antisera .
the bar charts show the mean relative levels of h3thr11 phosphorylation relative to total histone h3 levels , as determined by densitometry (+/ - sem , n >= 3 ) , where levels in the vehicle - treated cells were assigned a value of 1 .
the asterisks indicate where u46619 stimulation resulted in significant changes in the levels of h3thr11 phosphorylation , where * and ** indicate p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 , respectively .
role of prk1 on the association of prk2 with tpalpha and tpbeta in pc - 3 cells collectively , data herein show a strong dependence on prk1 and prk2 , but not on prk3 , in mediating tp - induced neoplastic responses , including cell proliferation , migration and h3thr11 phosphorylation , in pc - 3 cells .
moreover , sirna - targeted disruption studies showed near - on equivalent dependence on either prk1 or prk2 in inducing these tp - mediated responses , despite substantial differences in the levels of prk1 versus prk2 expression in pc - 3 cells and despite clear differences in their agonist - regulated associations with tpalpha and tpbeta ( figure 1 ) .
due to these findings , it was sought to establish whether expression of prk1 in pc - 3 cells might influence the association of tpalpha / tpbeta with prk2 or vice versa .
hence , the effect of sirna - mediated disruption of prk1 and prk2 on their ability to complex with tpalpha and tpbeta in the absence or presence of u46619 ( 10 min ) stimulation was investigated through co - immunoprecipitations from pc - 3 cells where cells transfected with scrambled sirna sequences served as controls ( figure 7 ) .
notably , upon sirna - disruption of prk1 expression , prk2 was not found to associate with tpalpha or tpbeta either in the presence or absence of tp agonist ( figure 7 ) .
however , upon knockdown of prk2 expression , levels of prk1 complexed with tpalpha or tpbeta were not significantly affected and were comparable to control levels in the presence of sirnacontrol ( figure 7 ) .
these data suggest that the association that exists between prk1 with either tpalpha or tpbeta is independent of the expression of and / or potential association with prk2 .
however , these data also suggest that expression and / or prior association of prk1 with tpalpha and tpbeta may be a prerequisite for association of prk2 with the tps .
specifically , both the agonist - dependent association of prk2 with tpalpha or the constitutive interaction of prk2 with tpbeta is dependent on the expression of prk1 and / or on the association of prk1 in complex with either tpalpha or tpbeta .
figure 7 effect of prk1 on the association of prk2 with tpalpha and tpbeta in pc - 3 cells pc - 3 cells were transfected for 72 hr with 30 nm sirnaprk1 , sirnaprk2 or , as controls , with a scrambled sirna ( sirnacontrol ) prior to stimulation with u46619 ( 1 mum ; 10 min ) or vehicle ( 0.01 % etoh ) , and then immunoprecipitated with anti - tpalpha , anti - tpbeta or , as controls , with the pre - immune ( igg ) sera .
thereafter , immunoprecipitates ( upper panels ) or equivalent aliquots of whole cell lysates ( 20 mug / lane , lower panels ) were ib with anti - prk1 or anti - prk2 antisera .

discussion androgen deprivation therapy ( adt ) remains the principal treatment for patients with locally advanced , relapsed or metastatic prostate cancer [ 48 ] .
despite initial success , many men eventually fail this therapy and metastatic prostate cancer develops to the final castrate - resistant stage , for which no cure is available and only palliative therapy can be given [ 51 ] .
hence , increased understanding of the mechanisms that underlie crpc is needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches for this disease [ 48 ] .
although the ar can remain functional and continue to be activated during crpc , other androgen - independent signalling pathways also play a key role including disturbed growth factor signalling and survival pathways [ 51 ] .
key among the findings which may account for the aberrant activation of the ar in prostate cancer was the discovery that , in addition to classical ligand - binding mechanisms , transcriptional activity of the ar is controlled through its direct binding to the rhoa effectors prk1 and prk2 [ 46 ] .
in fact , as stated , by catalysing h3thr11 phosphorylation in response to androgen signalling , prk1 functions as a gatekeeper of ar - regulated gene expression and , in turn , of deleterious growth of prostate cancer [ 47 ] .
moreover , prk1 can control the transcriptional activation of ar - target genes even in the absence of testicular androgens or in the presence of anti - androgens , highlighting a role for prk1 in prostate tumour growth and spread which occurs during adt and crpc [ 46 ] .
there is significant evidence to support the role of the cox - 1 / 2 - derived txa2 in tumour progression and metastasis , including within the prostate [ 7 , 14 , 52 ] .
mechanistically , tp - mediated rhoa activation plays a critical role in the txa2 - induced tumour cell migration and metastasis while its ability to regulate the pi3'k and erk cascades may account for the influence of txa2 on tumour cell proliferation / mitogenesis [ 7 , 26 - 29 ] .
in addition , we recently discovered a novel signalling pathway in prostate tumour cells involving the direct interaction of both tpalpha and tpbeta with prk1 [ 35 ] .
critically , this discovery revealed that agonist - stimulation of tpalpha / tpbeta can directly activate prk1 and established for the first time that agents other than androgens can induce chromatin remodelling through prk1 - mediated phosphorylation of histone h3 at thr11 [ 35 ] .
moreover , it was established that txa2 - mediated prk1 signalling can both mimic and augment androgen - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation and cell migration in prostate cancer , providing a previously unknown functional link between the txa2 - tpalpha / tpbeta signalling axis and the ar [ 35 ] .
as stated , prk1 / pknalpha , along with prk2 / pkngamma and prk3 / pknbeta , are members of a family of structurally related , yet functionally distinct ser / thr agc kinases which , like prk1 , are strongly implicated in tumour promotion including within but not limited to the prostate [ 42 , 43 , 46 ] .
hence , focusing within the setting of prostate cancer , we sought to investigate whether , like prk1 , prk2 and prk3 might also associate with tpalpha and / or tpbeta to mediate txa2 - induced chromatin remodelling and cell growth / metastasis , thereby gaining a greater mechanistic insight into how the txa2 - tp signalling axis , and target of aspirin , can contribute to prostate tumorigenesis .
in our study , we provide evidence that tpalpha and tpbeta can form complexes / associate with all three of the prk isozymes , but that the association occurs in a cell - specific manner whereby prk1 and prk2 can both associate with tpalpha / tpbeta endogenously expressed in the prostate cancer pc - 3 cell line , while prk3 only associates with tpalpha / tpbeta when over - expressed in hek293 cells .
however , the associations between tpalpha / tpbeta with both prk2 and prk3 are both structurally distinct and highly regulated in response to agonist - stimulation of the tps .
studies with the individual subdomains of the prks suggest that the associations with prk1 and prk3 , either in the absence or presence of agonist , are predominantly dependent on their c - terminal c2 and kinase domains , but the association with prk2 requires the presence of the complete enzyme for complex formation with tpalpha / tpbeta .
the molecular basis of the differential associations between the tps and prks is currently unknown and will require additional investigations , such as through detailed biophysical studies of the complexes to define / identify the main structural motifs / residues involved .
based on our findings with the full - length prks , we propose a model ( figure 8a ) whereby , under constitutive / basal conditions in the absence of agonist , prk1 and / or prk3 is recruited into a complex with both of the tpalpha and tpbeta isoforms , while prk2 distinctly forms a complex only with that of tpbeta .
in response to short - term u46619 / txa2 - induced receptor activation ( e.g at 10 min ) , while there is no measurable alteration in the level of prk1 associated with either tpalpha or tpbeta , a change occurs whereby prk2 transiently dissociates from tpbeta , and prk3 transiently dissociates from tpalpha , coinciding with / facilitating the recruitment of prk2 into a transient complex with tpalpha .
following prolonged agonist - activation of tpalpha / tpbeta , prk2 dissociates from tpalpha and is recruited once more into a complex with tpbeta , while the association between tpbeta and prk3 is also restored .
furthermore , signalling through tpalpha / tpbeta leads to t - loop phosphorylation and activation of prk1 and prk2 in pc - 3 cells and this occurs in a mechanism - dependent on pi3'k / pdk1 .
thus , while prk2 , but not prk1 , transiently associate / disassociate from the given tpalpha / tpbeta complex in response to agonist stimulation , the agonist - induced t - loop phosphorylation & activation of each of these prks is more sustained .
critically , we also show that both prk1 and prk2 , but not prk3 , are essential in mediating txa2 / u46619 - induced chromatin remodelling ( h3thr11 phosphorylation ) and neoplastic responses ( cell proliferation , anchorage independent growth / colony formation , and cell migration ) in prostate cancer cells .
hence , tp - mediated prostate tumour responses not only involves prk1 , but is also dependent on signalling through the related prk2 , involving a unique and dynamic series of complexes regulated in response to agonist - activation of the tps .
figure 8 proposed model of the association of tpalpha / tpbeta with prk1 - 3 , and the implications for prostate tumour progression panel a. in the prostate carcinoma pc - 3 cell line , under constitutive / basal conditions prk1 is recruited into a complex with both the tpalpha ( i ) and tpbeta ( ii ) isoforms while prk2 distinctly forms a complex only with that of tpbeta .
following short - term agonist ( u46619 ) - stimulation of tpalpha / tpbeta ( 10 min ) , whereas there is no measurable alteration in the level of prk1 associated with either tp isoform , a change occurs whereby prk2 dissociates from tpbeta ( ii ) , while transiently associating into a complex with tpalpha ( i ) .
following prolonged agonist - activation of tpalpha / tpbeta ( 60 min ) , prk2 dissociates from tpalpha ( i ) and is recruited once more into a complex with tpbeta ( ii ) .
hence , the prk : tpalpha ( i ) and prk : tpbeta ( ii ) complexes observed at 60 min post - agonist mimic those found basally , in the absence of agonist .
although not found to occur in pc - 3 cells , prk3 also has the ability to associate with tpalpha ( i ) and tpbeta ( ii ) , such - as when co - expressed in hek293 cells .
in response to receptor stimulation , while there is no measurable alteration in the level of prk3 associated with tpbeta ( ii ) , prk3 transiently dissociates from tpalpha ( i ) at 10 min post - agonist before re - associating following prolonged agonist stimulation ( 60 min ) .
agonist - stimulation of both tpalpha and tpbeta leads to t - loop phosphorylation - dependent activation of prk1 , prk2 and prk3 , where each of the kinases remain in the activated state for at least 60 min post - agonist .
thus , while prk2 and prk3 , but not prk1 , transiently associate / disassociate from the given tpalpha / tpbeta complex in response to agonist stimulation , the agonist - induced phosphorylation & activation of each of the prks is more sustained .
panel b. in pc - 3 cells , tpalpha / tpbeta is found associated in a complex with both prk1 and prk2 .
agonist - activation of tpalpha / tpbeta leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'kinase ( pi3'k ) and , in turn , to activation of 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 ( pdk - 1 ) , the master - regulator agc kinase that leads to subsequent activation of the prks through phosphorylation of the essential thr within their activation loop ( t - loop phosphorylation ) .
critically , in response to tpalpha / tpbeta stimulation , activation of both prk1 and prk2 leads to chromatin remodelling ( h3thr11 phosphorylation ) in prostate cells and to enhanced cell proliferation and migration , thereby exacerbating the pathological state in prostate cancer .
note ; tpalpha / tpbeta - regulation of gq / plcbeta , g12 / rho or of the erk signalling cascades are not shown .
notably , following multiple attempts prk3 did not form a complex with tpalpha or tpbeta in pc - 3 cells , despite showing associations in hek293 cells that can be agonist - regulated and dependent on the c - terminal c2 and kinase domains of prk3 .
given the relatively lower expression of prk3 in pc - 3 cells , one possible explanation is that tpalpha / tpbeta might preferentially associate with the more abundant prk1 and prk2 in this prostate cell line .
however , even in the absence of prk1 and prk2 expression , following their specific disruption by sirnas , prk3 was not found to associate with tpalpha or tpbeta in pc - 3 cells ( data not shown ) .
another possibility might be that there is a missing functional element in prostate cells , which would otherwise facilitate the association of tpalpha / tpbeta with prk3 .
interestingly , a recent study has revealed that rhoc predominately associates with prk3 in prostate cells leading to metastatic prostate tumour growth downstream of a hyperactive pi3'k pathway [ 44 ] .
hence , prk3 may function as an effector of another branch of the pi3'k oncogenic signalling network in prostate cancer , which is potentially independent of the txa2 - tpalpha / tpbeta signalling axis [ 43 , 44 ] .
while our data have provided evidence for the propensity of both tpalpha and tpbeta to associate with and regulate prk3 , the biological significance of these findings remains to be clarified and will be the subject of future investigations .
specifically , it will be of interest to investigate the role of the tpalpha / tpbeta - mediated prk3 signalling in other neoplastic settings where both txa2 and prk3 are implicated .
as illustrated in the model in figure 8b , txa2 / u46619 - induced activation of the prks occurs in a mechanism dependent on signalling through pi3'k and subsequent activation of the master - regulatory agc kinase pdk1 , leading to t - loop phosphorylation and activation of prk1 / 2 [ 37 , 38 ] .
these findings are entirely consistent with the established role for tpalpha / tpbeta in the activation of both class 1a and class 1b pi3'k signalling cascades [ 27 - 29 ] .
furthermore , mutational analysis of the prks reveals that the stability of the complex formed between tpalpha / tpbeta and the prks is dependent upon their t - loop phosphorylation which occurs in response to u46619 - induced receptor activation .
therefore , it appears that through their ability to associate with tpalpha / tpbeta , in response to receptor activation prk1 / 2 undergoes enhanced pdk1 - dependent phosphorylation at its t - loop , a phosphorylation event that is critical for regulating / stabilizing the association of tpalpha / tpbeta with the prks. of crucial importance to the current study is that in response to receptor stimulation , activation of both prk1 and prk2 are involved in h3thr11 phosphorylation , cell proliferation / migration in pc - 3 cells , thereby providing evidence for the additional role of prk2 in mediating txa2 - induced chromatin remodelling and malignant growth / metastasis in prostate cancer. from a mechanistic point of view , phosphorylation of h3thr11 by prk1 and / or by the related prk2 accelerates the demethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 ( h3k9 ) by the de - methylases jmjd2c and lysine specific de - methylase ( lsd ) 1 , thereby promoting ar - dependent gene expression and cellular growth and migration in prostate cancer [ 47 , 53 , 54 ] .
in addition , it was recently established that prk1 - induced phosphorylated h3thr11 serves as a binding platform for the wdr5 ( wd - repeat containing protein 5 ) component of the wrad complex , thereby leading to recruitment of the mll1 methyltransferase complex , and consequent trimethylation of h3k4 and transcriptional activation of ar - target genes [ 55 ] .
our discovery , therefore , that signalling through tpalpha / tpbeta can lead to prk1 / prk2 - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation is truly exciting , and clearly highlights a potentially important role for tpalpha and / or tpbeta in chromatin remodelling / epigenetic regulation in tumour progression .
furthermore , it is tempting to speculate that these tpalpha / tpbeta - mediated effects may account , at least in part , for the clinically well - documented observation that during prostate cancer progression , ar - target gene expression is up - regulated even in the absence of testicular androgens or in the presence of ar antagonists , such as in the case of crpc .
it will therefore be of significant interest to now investigate whether tpalpha / tpbeta - mediated prk1 / 2 activation can lead to further chromatin modifications in prostate cells , including recruitment of the mll1 complex and subsequent trimethylation of h3k4 , thereby leading to an altered gene expression programme in prostate tumour cells .
the importance of the prk family members in transcriptional regulation is further endorsed by recent reports that key members of class iia histone deacetylases are phosphorylated by prk1 / 2 .
more specifically , hdac - 5 , - 7 and - 9 but not - 4 are phosphorylated by prk1 / 2 within their nuclear localisation signal , thereby impairing histone deacetylase nuclear transport and promotion of transcriptional activation [ 56 ] .
interestingly , through interactions involving its n - terminal domain , prk2 is known to form homodimers , also raising the possibility of the existence of heterodimers between members of the structurally related prk family [ 57 ] .
hence , given our discovery that txa2 - induced h3thr11 phosphorylation , as well as cell proliferation / migration appear to be almost equivalently dependent on signalling through both prk1 and prk2 , despite differences in their relative expression levels and modes of regulation in pc - 3 cells , we sought to explore the possibility that the ability of prk2 to associate with tpalpha / tpbeta might occur in a mechanism which is dependent on the related prk1 , or vice versa .
in preliminary experiments , we found that endogenous expression of prk1 may be a pre - requisite for the association of prk2 with tpalpha / tpbeta which occurs in pc - 3 cells .
hence , although clarification of our observation requires detailed investigation , this raises the possibility of the existence of a potential tpalpha / tpbeta signalling complex in prostate tumour cells , comprising the receptor and both prk1 and prk2 , where prk1 may function to facilitate binding of prk2 to tpalpha / tpbeta and / or prk1 .
however , the fact that prk1 is constitutively bound to both tpalpha and tpbeta , but that prk2 does not bind to tpalpha but binds to tpbeta under those same conditions , in the absence of agonist , suggests that prk1 is not simply serving as a binding platform for prk2 binding .
hence , additional studies are necessary to understand the micro - organisation of tp : prk protein - protein complexes generated and , in turn , may facilitate the design of drugs to block critical protein interactions in cases where the protein associations leads to disease [ 58 ] .
therefore , given the evidence presented herein for the critical role of the tpalpha / tpbeta - prk1 / prk2 signalling axis in prostate tumorigenesis , it will be of interest to determine the precise molecular architecture of the protein complexes which exist between the tps and prk1 / prk2 , including identification of the region ( s ) of tpalpha / tpbeta which mediate their association with prk2 , and determining whether prk1 can directly associate with prk2 .
furthermore , it will also be crucial to establish if the tpalpha / tpbeta - prk1 / prk2 signalling axis plays a role in tumour progression in other carcinomas where both the tp and the prks are implicated including in breast and bladder cancer [ 42 , 59 ] .
in conclusion , as outlined in figure 8b , our study has uncovered a novel signalling pathway involving tpalpha / tpbeta and both prk1 and prk2 , providing a mechanism for how agonist activation of the tp may exacerbate prostate cancer , including crpc .
however , intriguingly while both prk1 and prk2 associate with tpalpha and tpbeta , they do so in a radically different manner under both basal and agonist - regulated conditions , including where both tp isoforms show different associations with prk2 .
bearing in mind the crucial role for prk1 and prk2 in the epigenetic regulation of events associated with prostate tumour progression / metastasis [ 47 , 55 ] , our discovery of the propensity of tpalpha / tpbeta to induce prk1 / prk2 - mediated chromatin remodelling and neoplastic responses in prostate cells is highly significant , and highlights the potential for tpalpha and / or tpbeta as a therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer including crpc and potentially in other cancers in which aberrant tp : prk1 and / or prk2 signalling is implicated .
furthermore , our study provides a mechanistic explanation , at least in part , for the prophylactic benefits of aspirin in reducing certain cancer risks by lowering overall txa2 levels .

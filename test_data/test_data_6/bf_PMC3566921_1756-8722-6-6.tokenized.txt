micrornas ( mirnas ) are emerging as a novel class of non - coding rna molecules that regulate gene expression at a post - transcriptional level .
more than 1000 mirnas have been identified in human cells to date , and they are reported to play important roles in normal cell homeostasis , cell metastasis and disease pathogensis and progression .
mir - 125 , which is a highly conserved mirna throughout diverse species from nematode to humans , consists of three homologs hsa - mir - 125a , hsa - mir - 125b - 1 and hsa - mir - 125 - 2 .
members of this family have been validated to be down - regulated , exhibiting its disease - suppressing properties in many different types of diseases , while they also have disease - promoting functions in certain contexts .
mir - 125 targets a number of genes such as transcription factors , matrix - metalloprotease , members of bcl - 2 family and others , aberrance of which may lead to abnormal proliferation , metastasis and invasion of cells , even carcinomas .
furthermore , mir - 125 plays a crucial role in immunological host defense , especially in response to bacterial or viral infections .
in this review , we summarize the implication of mir - 125 family in disease suppression and promotion , focusing on carcinoma and host immune responses .
we also discussed the potential of this mirna family as promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for different diseases in future .
mir - 125 family biomarker immune response therapeutic target tumor - suppressor tumor - promoter introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) are a family of ~ 22 nucleotide ( nt ) small noncoding rnas that act as crucial posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression through translational repression or transcript cleavage [ 1 ] .
since mirnas were first described as endogenous mediators in c. elegans in 1993 [ 2 ] , they have been identified to be involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes , including cell differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis and metabolic homeostasis [ 3 ] .
in the past decade , more and more studies have demonstrated that aberrant expression of mirnas is tightly related to the pathogenesis of diseases , including almost all types of human cancers [ 4 ] .
a growing body of studies elucidate that mirnas can function as either tumor suppressors by down - regulating oncogenic targets , or tumor promoters through negatively regulating tumor - suppressive target mrnas [ 5 ] .
because of aberrant expression of mirnas in almost all types of cancers and other diseases , they can possibly be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancers and other diseases , depending on their abundance .
in addition , mirnas and their target genes supply to a general or personalized therapy with pharmaceutical targets , showing their remarkable value in clinical therapy .
among the most important mirna families , mir - 125 family has been reported to be implicated in a variety of carcinomas and other diseases as either repressors or promoters .
mir - 125 family is composed of three homologs hsa - mir - 125a , hsa - mir - 125b - 1 and hsa - mir - 125 - 2 .
mir - 125a has been found to be located at 19q13 , while mir - 125b is verified to be transcribed from two loci located on chromosomes 11q23 ( hsa - mir - 125b - 1 ) and 21q21 ( hsa - mir - 125b - 2 ) [ 6 ] .
furthermore , mir - 125b - 1 is implicated in some chromosomal translocations like t ( 11 ; 14 )( q24 ; q32 ) and t ( 2 ; 11 )( p21 ; q23 ) which leads to b - cell acute lymphoid leukemia ( b - all ) or myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , respectively [ 7 - 10 ] .
members of the family play crucial roles in many different cellular processes like cell differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis by targeting many different transcription factors [ 11 ] , matrix - metalloprotease [ 12,13 ] , growth factors [ 14 ] and so on. the theme of the present paper , however , is to summarize the function of mir - 125 family in different contexts , particularly in disease condition .
we mainly focus on following four aspects : ( 1 ) the regulation of mir - 125 at post - transcription level , ( 2 ) the function of mir - 125 as tumor - suppressive or tumor - promoting properties , ( 3 ) potential acting of mir - 125 as biomarker , and its possibility to be used as a therapeutic target in disease therapy , and ( 4 ) the immune - modulating functions of mir - 125 and the involvement of this mirna in immune responses to pathogen infections .
involvement of the mir - 125 family in solid tumors a great amount of studies have investigated the relationships between mirnas and malignancies , and the results show that mirna deregulation is involved in all types of cancer .
the different members of mir - 125 family have been reported controversial properties in different types of cancer ; they may contribute to the initiation and progression of cancers by acting as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes [ 15 - 18 ] .
mir - 125 has been shown its tumor - suppressor functions in several cancers including ovarian cancer [ 16,19 ] , bladder cancer [ 20 ] , breast cancer [ 21 - 23 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 12,24,25 ] , melanoma [ 26 ] , cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [ 13 ] and osteosarcoma [ 27 ] .
wang et al. reported that mir - 125a , activated by egfr , functions as a metastatic suppressor in lung cancer cells , inhibiting tumor formation and tube formation [ 28 ] .
in breast cancer , mir - 125a and mir - 125b were reported down - regulated in biopsy specimens and as tumor suppressors [ 23,29,30 ] by mediating the erbb2 and erbb3 pathway [ 22 ] or by targeting the ets1 gene [ 31 ] .
furthermore , hajabi et al. found that mir - 125b can reduce the expression of muc1 oncoprotein , silencing of which in breast cancer cells with sirna promotes dna damage - induced apoptosis [ 32 ] .
ectopic expression of both mir - 125a [ 12 ] and mir - 125b [ 25 ] can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
up - regulated mir - 125a significantly inhibits the malignant phenotypes by repressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 11 ( mmp11 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor a ( vegf - a ) both in vitro and in vivo [ 12 ] , while the direct targets of mir - 125b in mirna - induced inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation are mcl - 1 and il6r [ 25 ] .
in contrast to the tumor - suppressive properties mentioned above , the members of mir - 125 family , especially mir - 125b , also act as oncogene in several cancers .
jiang and colleagues observed that an3ca cells , a type ii endometrial carcinoma cell line , transfected with mir - 125b mimic showed higher tumorogenesis in comparison to other negative controls in nude mice , suggesting that up - regulated mir - 125b can promote the proliferation and migration of the disease [ 18 ] .
in addition , overexpression of mir - 125b has been investigated in several cancers such as pancreatic cancer [ 33 ] , prostate cancer [ 34,35 ] , oligodendroglial cancer [ 36 ] and other cancers .
furthermore , mir - 125b has been demonstrated to play a key role in the initiation and development of prostate cancer through evaluating the effect of mir - 125b on xenograft tumor growth in transplanted mice with pc - 346c - mir - 125b cells [ 35 ] .
albeit mir - 125b has been demonstrated to be tumor suppressor in breast cancer by down - regulating erbb2 and erbb3 [ 22 ] , several studies have showed its property to increase resistance of cancer cells , including breast cancer cells , to anticancer drug [ 37 ] , resulting in subsequent recurrence and metastasis .
surprisingly , in contrast to tumor - suppressive function in breast cancer mentioned above , a very recent study by tang et al. has verified that mir - 125b also induces metastasis of human breast cancer cells through targeting stard13 [ 38 ] .
mir - 125a also enhances invasive potential in urothelial carcinomas [ 39 ] and is up - regulated in basal cell carcinoma compared with adjacent nonlesional skin [ 40 ] , while mir - 125b suppresses bmf - dependent apoptosis in human glioblastoma multiforme cells [ 41 ] .
the controversial properties of the mir - 125 family in different solid tumors suggest that mir - 125 plays diverse functions in cancer pathogenesis and progression , while the underlying mechanisms on different cell context need further investigation .
properties of the mir - 125 family in hematological malignancies dysregulation of mirnas has now clearly been linked to hematological malignancies , especially to leukemia [ 42 ] .
it has been shown that mir - 125b is implicated in some subtypes of leukemia induced by chromosomal translocation .
the chromosomal translocation t ( 11 ; 14 )( q24 ; q32 ) found in patients with b - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all )[ 7,9 ] leads to an up - regulation of mir - 125b .
moreover , overexpression of mir - 125b also occurs in patients with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) carrying the t ( 2 ; 11 )( p21 ; q23 ) translocation [ 8 ] .
mir - 125b has also been reported to be overexpressed in megakaryoblastic leukemia [ 43 ] and apl [ 44 ] .
bousquet and colleagues transplanted fetal liver cells which ectopic express mir - 125b into nude mice to decipher oncogenic mechanism of mir - 125b [ 15 ] .
in this study they found a higher level of mir - 125b increased white blood cell count in mice and half of these mice died of diverse leukemia such as b - cell and t - cell all , or a myeloproliferative neoplasm , suggesting mir - 125b an important role in early hematopoiesis ( the function then was proved by chaudhuri [ 45 ]) .
furthermore , this study also demonstrated that mir - 125b can shorten the latency of bcr - abl induced leukemia as a secondary event .
enomoto et al. reported that transduction of mir - 125b - 1 in bone marrow cells indeed accelerated myeloid tumors induced by a c - terminal mutant of caat - enhancer binding protein ( c / ebpalpha - c ( m )) [ 46 ] , suggesting that overexpression of mir - 125b collaborates with other genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies .
albeit enomoto did n't find leukemia transformation in their model , a recent study by bousquet has highlighted the transformation of mir - 125b - induced leukemia in nude mice [ 11 ] .
much to our surprise , mir - 125b , which has been shown reduced expression in both aggressive and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( cll ) patients , its overexpression can change metabolic pathways including glucose , glutathione , lipid and glycerolipid metabolism in cll , suggesting that mir - 125b plays a vital role for the adaptation of cell metabolism to a transformed state [ 47 ] .
however , the mechanism underlying differential expression pattern of mir - 125b between cll and other types of hematological malignancies is still unknown .
we speculated that the induced expression of mir - 125b in cll leads to metabolic adaptation associated cancer transformation may be caused by very low proliferative index and defects in apoptotic pathways in the disease , while the up - regulated mir - 125b leads to acute leukemia may be resulted from hematopoietic stem cell differentiation block by mir - 125b .
these speculations need to be further validated .
the functional link of the mir - 125 family in autoimmune diseases the aberrant expression of mir - 125 was also found in different diseases other than cancers , such as autoimmune diseases [ 48 ] .
for instance , mir - 125a has been identified down - regulated in systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , and negatively regulated expression of the inflammatory chemokine rantes , which is highly expressed in sle samples and plays a key role in inflammatory progress [ 49 ] .
mir - 125a was also reported to be significantly up - regulated in macrophases following oxidized low density lipoprotein ( oxldl ) [ 50 ] , inducing the formation of ischemic stroke [ 51 ] .
moreover , mir - 125b acting as pro - inflammation role can be mediated by metal sulfates to affect the outcome of ischemic stroke [ 51,52 ] .
interestingly , zhang and colleagues have found the overexpression of mir - 125b in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps , enhancing type i ifn expression through suppressing 4e - bp1 protein expression [ 53 ] .
in addition , dysregulation of mir - 125b has been reported to be involved in alzheimer 's disease [ 54 ] and myotonic dystrophy type 2 [ 55 ] .
all together suggest that mir - 125 plays important roles in autoimmune diseases .
however , thus far , most of the studies on autoimmune diseases mainly focus on the expression pattern of mir - 125 , the targets and inflammatory pathway in this disease still need to be declared mir - 125 involved in immune system development and immunological host defense it has been uncovered that mirnas are tightly associated with immune system by controlling the destiny of immune cells [ 56,57 ] , regulating the expression of target encoding genes , responding to stimulatory cues , and enhancing the response of immune cells to potential antigen as well as playing a key role in fate of immune cells .
an example is that , b lymphocyte - induced maturation protein - 1 ( blimp - 1 ) and ifn regulatory protein - 4 ( irf4 ) transcription factors , which are essential for plasma cell differentiation , have been demonstrated to be targets for mir - 125b .
gururajan and colleagues have evaluated the effect of overexpression of mir - 125b on b cell differentiation in an lps - responsive b cell line , finding that mir - 125b can repress the differentiation of primary b cell , in which they found that mir - 125b promotes b lymphocyte diversification in germinal centers by inhibiting premature utilization of essential transcription factors for plasma cell differentiation [ 56 ] .
in addition , mir - 125b is confirmed to protect b cells from apoptosis through contributing to repression of bcl2 which does a developmental stage - specific regulation during b - cell maturation , and deregulation of mir - 125b in response to cd40 ligand ( cd154 ) can lead to proliferation in leukemic b cells [ 57 ] .
beyond regulated by cytokine like il - 4 [ 58 ] and interferon , mir - 125b have also been verified to frequently regulate expression of signals involved in immune system .
studies have showed that up - regulated expression of mir - 125b may enhance type i ifn expression in airway epithelial cells in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [ 53 ] , while negatively regulating tnf - alpha expression in neonatal monocytes [ 59 ] .
both signals play crucial roles in immunological host defense , aberrant expression or response of which may result in fatal diseases .
furthermore , overexpression of mir - 125b in macrophage showed the repression to ifn regulatory factor 4 ( irf4 ) , and elevated responsiveness to ifn - gamma , potentiating the functional role of macrophages in inducing immune responses [ 60 ] .
another important function of mir - 125 is in immune responses to bacterial infection , and even shows to partake in damage accompanied by pathogenic bacteria .
rajaram has illustrated that virulent mycobacterium tuberculosis could take advantage of mir - 125b to block tnf biosynthesis .
lipomannan from virulent mycobacterium tuberculosis induces overexpression of mir - 125b , which subsequently binds to the 3 ' utr region of tnf mrna and destabilizes the transcript [ 61 ] .
apart from immune reaction to bacterial infection , a study shows that mir - 125b plays an important role in anti - viral defense [ 62 ] .
mir - 125a interacted with the viral sequence and markedly suppressed the reporter activity .
subsequently mir - 125a was shown to interfere with the viral translation , down - regulating the expression of the surface antigen [ 62 ] .
interestingly , mir - 125b has been verified to contribute to hiv - 1 latency [ 63 ] , acting as an anti - hiv - 1 mirna [ 64 ] .
mir - 125b , repressing hiv - 1 activity , is higher expressed in resting cd4 + t cells in comparison to activated cd4 + t cells .
the mirna can bind to the 3 ' ends of hiv - 1 messenger rnas , leading to destabilization of the transcript , terminally inhibits hiv - 1 production and prolongs hiv - 1 latency in resting cd4 + t cells [ 63 ] .
in addition , a recent study has found that morphine was shown to down - regulate the expression of anti - hiv mirnas including mir - 125b in cultured human monocytes [ 64 ] , which suggests that morphine may have potential to activate latent hiv - 1 in resting cd4 + t cells and macrophages by inhibiting related mirnas expression .
in conclusion , mir - 125 family plays crucial roles in immune system development and immunological host defense , including regulating differentiation of immune cells , responding to stimulatory cues in many different signal pathways involved in immune system , controlling expression of target genes , products of which partake in immune reactions as well as in immune responses to bacterial infection and to viral infection .
the regulatory network of mir - 125 family in disease pathogenesis as previous reported , mir - 125 family plays an important role in normal cell homeostasis , cell metastasis and different diseases .
current progression also revealed a number of the mir - 125 family target genes and their regulation pathways , which could supply the feasibility of using mir - 125 as a therapeutic strategy to suppress diseases .
members of bcl - 2 family and ones else involved in apoptosis are an important group of mir - 125 targets .
anti - apoptotic members of bcl - 2 family such as bcl - w [ 65 ] , bcl - 2 [ 66 ] , mcl - 1 [ 65,67 ] , and bak - 1 [ 11,44,68,69 ] acting as the bcl - 2 homologous antagonist , and others involved in apoptosis like p53 [ 69 ] , tp53inp1 [ 11,18 ] , tnfaip3 [ 70 ] , p38alpha [ 71 ] et al. , have all been demonstrated to be direct targets of mir - 125 in previous studies .
aberrant expression of mir - 125 leads to up - regulation of bcl - 2 , mcl - 1 et al. and down - regulation of bak - 1 , tp53inp1 et al. and consequently to protect cells from apoptosis , which in turn promotes tumorigenesis .
besides , p38alpha expression repressed by mir - 125b is required for protecting cells from uv - induced apoptosis .
erbb2 , which enhances kinase - mediated activation of downstream signaling pathways such as mapk , has been verified to be the target for both mir - 125a and mir - 125b [ 22 ] .
experimentally , mir - 125 - induced down - regulation of erbb2 and erbb3 has been uncovered to reduce cell motility and invasiveness of numerous cancers , including breast cancer [ 22 ] and endometrial cancer [ 72 ] .
among other targets of mir - 125 associated with proliferation , metastasis and migration , hur [ 73 ] , rock - 1 [ 74 ] , pdpn [ 75 ] , stat3 [ 27 ] and stard13 [ 38 ] are five important genes identified , which can induce cell metastasis and migration , and in turn enhance tumorigenesis .
furthermore , cbfbeta , a transcriptional factor involved in hematopoiesis , which has been confirmed to be a new direct target of mir - 125b , and abtb1 , an anti - proliferative factor targeted by mir - 125b , also contribute to block differentiation and proliferation in leukemia , respectively [ 11,76 ] .
other targets have been demonstrated including matrix - metalloprotease mmp11 [ 12 ] , mmp13 [ 13 ] , kurppel - like factor klf13 [ 49 ] , c - jun [ 26 ] , arid3b ( at - rich interactive domain 3b ) [ 16,77 ] , arid3a ( at - rich interactive domain 3a ) [ 78 ] , germ layer specification [ 79 ] and hematopoiesis regulator lin28a [ 45 ] , growth factors such as vegf - a [ 12 ] and igf - ii [ 14 ] , and growth factor receptors like fgfr2 [ 80 ] , et al. it is necessary to mention that the same target may have different functions in different cellular processes , cellular context , and diseases .
for example , arid3b elevates the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in human ovarian cancer [ 16 ] , while increases cell migration in breast cancer [ 77 ] .
consequently , target genes of specific cell - type may be useful in a more targeted and precise therapy by mirnas .
as summarized in figure 1 , the targets of mir - 125 family are involved in different types of diseases pathogenesis .
mir - 125 can act as cancer promoter or cancer repressor depends on the cell context , among which , the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is the well illustrated role of mir - 125 with the two faces ( as shown in figure 2 ) .
the down regulated mir - 125 caused breast cancer but the up regulated mir - 125 induced chemoresistance , and higher expression of mir - 125 promoted all or aml nevertheless reduced expression of mir - 125b resulted in metabolic pathways transformed in cll .
research on mir - 125 in leukemia and breast cancer model may provide a new insight into current mirna research .
figure 1 schematic diagram of the targets of mir - 125 involved in different types of disease pathogenesis .
figure 2 the targets of mir - 125 in mitochondrial apoptosis pathway .
mir - 125 plays important roles in mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by targeting pro - apoptosis or anti - apoptosis gene depends on the cell context .
potential of mir - 125 for disease diagnosis and therapy some protein coding genes have been reported playing critical roles in tumor initiation and progression , and their expression levels are correlated with clinical outcome [ 81,82 ] .
growing studies demonstrate the advantages using mirna as biomarkers for cancer and disease .
the reviews above have shown that expression level of mir - 125 family is distinguished in various types of disease , implying that the mir - 125 could predict disease onset and might potentially serve as prognostic marker in disease - derived tissues and possibly in serum .
for example , decreased mir - 125a has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) tissues compared with matched adjacent liver tissues , and associated with patients' aggressive pathologic features [ 12 ] .
moreover , hong and colleagues have uncovered that the expression levels of mir - 125b were much lower in hcc tissues than in non - tumor liver tissues [ 25 ] , indicating that both mir - 125a and mir - 125b have low expression level and are inversely correlated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in hcc , and could serve as the bio - marker for hcc diagnosis and prognosis .
expression profiling of mir - 125b is a potential marker for thyroid cancer as it is overexpressed in thyroid cancer and its level has remarkably distinction between benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms [ 83 ] .
in human colorectal cancer , nishida and colleagues have evaluated expression of mir - 125b in 89 colorectal cancer cases , and interestingly found that the high mir - 125b expression group not only showed a greater incidence of advanced tumor size and tumor invasion , but also had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to the low expression group [ 84 ] , suggesting that mir - 125b could be an important prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients .
the mirna deregulation may be also associated with clinical relevance linking to key gene mutations [ 85 ] .
for example , down - regulation of mir - 125b was found significant correlation with tp53 mutation status [ 86 ] .
taken together , mir - 125 family has great perspective as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker .
more importantly , a great amount of studies have demonstrated that circulating mirnas in human serum and other body fluids can be used as biomarkers for cancer and other diseases [ 87,88 ] .
this potential of mirnas provides a possibility to carry out non - invasive analyses to clinicians , which can be performed easily in a large number of clinical samples .
however , standard reference controls are needed in order to ensure reliable and correct measurements of mirna levels .
moreover , ongoing studies have also suggested the potential of the mirna associated with therapy [ 89,90 ] .
as mentioned above , mir - 125 family may contribute to the initiation and progression of diseases by acting as either suppressors or promoters in a number of cancers and other diseases [ 16,17,22,23,25,28,29 ] , re - introduction of synthetic mir - 125 or its antisense at specific sites could become a possible treatment option .
conclusions evidences deriving from the increasing number of papers showed that members of mir - 125 family play a crucial role in diverse cellular processes and many diseases especially carcinomas .
it is noteworthy that the functions of mir - 125 are controversial in different types of diseases .
in certain contexts , mir - 125 can down - regulate target oncogene as a tumor suppressor , reducing tumor proliferation and metastasis .
vice versa , a variety of studies have exhibited tumor - promoting functions of mir - 125 as a tumor promoter .
the advances that mir - 125 and other mirnas can be used in clinical applications exactly hold potential for future treatment of diseases .
furthermore , an increasing number of studies have identified the target genes of mir - 125 family in different cellular contexts , which highlights the precise properties of this mirna in cellular pathways and networks , especially associated with carcinoma .
moreover , mir - 125 influences the fate of immune cells by targeting and regulating a set of target genes to enhance the effect against intra - or extracellular pathogens , or responding to the regulation of specific signal stimulation like il and ifn .
since aberrant expression of mirnas exist in almost all types of cancers and several other diseases , the potential use of mir - 125 as potent prognostic markers for early diagnosis of malignancies and other diseases has drawn more and more attentions .
in addition , in accordance with either disease - suppressive or - promoting properties of mirnas in different diseases , mir - 125 's ability as therapeutic agents has been delineated by many research groups .
further research is needed before mir - 125 and other mirnas can be used in clinical applications .

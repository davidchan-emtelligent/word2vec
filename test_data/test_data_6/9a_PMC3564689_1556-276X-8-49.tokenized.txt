the insulator characteristic of hexagonal boron nitride limits its applications in microelectronics .
in this paper , the fluorinated hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets were prepared by doping fluorine into the boron nitride nanosheets exfoliated from the bulk boron nitride in isopropanol via a facile chemical solution method with fluoboric acid ; interestingly , these boron nitride nanosheets demonstrate a typical semiconductor characteristic which were studied on a new scanning tunneling microscope - transmission electron microscope holder .
since this property changes from an insulator to a semiconductor of the boron nitride , these nanosheets will be able to extend their applications in designing and fabricating electronic nanodevices .
boron nitride exfoliation fluorination electrical conductivity background innovative and constructive doping into nanomaterials has attracted considerable attention , because a specific dopant could bring a revolutionary change on the materials' properties and applications , such as in the fields of energy storage [ 1,2 ] , photovoltaics [ 3,4 ] , and biosensor [ 5 ] .
graphene exfoliated from graphite is a good example , which is doped by some elements ( e.g. , n [ 6,7 ] and b [ 6,8 ]) has been explored many fascinating properties and applications .
the hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets ( h - bnnss ) are a structural analogue of graphene , so - called ' white - graphene ' [ 9 ] , in which b and n atoms alternatively substitute for c atoms [ 10 ] .
however , in contrast to the comprehensive researches on graphene [ 6,11 - 13 ] , especially the breakthrough in semiconductor devices [ 14,15 ] , the study on h - bnnss , including their exfoliation , properties ( by doping or functionalizing ) , and applications , is in its infancy .
this may attribute to the ' lip - lip ' ionic characteristic of the bonding between neighboring boron nitride ( bn ) layers [ 10 ] , which is stronger than the weak van der waals force between graphene layers and the wide band gap of h - bnns ( approximately 4 - 6 ev ) [ 16 ] , making it as an insulator .
if the two aforesaid challenging problems are solved , h - bnns will exhibit more novel properties and applications in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. of particular interest is that minishing the band gap of h - bnns by doping into some featured elements could lead an amazing change from an insulator to a semiconductor .
doping preferentially takes place at the more vulnerable sites , so it will be much easier to perform doping experiment with fewer - layered h - bnnss .
though several methods have been presented to prepare few - layered or mono - layered h - bnnss [ 17,18 ] , the rigorous conditions restrict these methods to be widely conducted .
recently , golberg [ 19 ] and coleman et al .
[ 20 ] have put forward a facile route to few - layered or mono - layered h - bnnss by sonicating the bulk bn in a common liquid solvent .
speaking of doping , several methods have been reported such as placing peculiar dopant into well - defined regions of h - bn nanotubes ( h - bnnts ) .
wei et al .
[ 21 ] used the electron - beam - induced strategy and wang et al .
[ 22 ] applied the noncovalent functionalization method to dope carbon ( c ) into the h - bnnts , which demonstrated the electrical conductivity increased with the c content .
in comparison with c , doping of fluorine ( f ) may be a new pathway to regulate the electrical properties of h - bn. since f is a highly electronegative element and has excessive valence electrons compared to b and n , doping f into some nanomaterials should reliably yield a p - type semiconductor at low coverages and even a conductor at high coverages [ 23,24 ] .
some theoretical calculations have predicted the possible functions of doping f into h - bnnts and h - bnnss [ 24 - 26 ] .
only tang et al .
[ 23 ] reported the electrical conductivity of h - bnnts which were fluorine - functionalized during the nanotubes' growth .
doping f into h - bnnss and examining their corresponding electrical properties have not been realized experimentally .
therefore , it is of crucial importance to develop a facile method for doping f into h - bnnss and explore its electrical properties .
herein , we doped f into few - and mono - layered h - bnnss and first pursued their electrical properties with the scanning tunneling microscope - transmission electron microscope ( stm - tem ) holder .
the few - layered h - bnnss were exfoliated from the bulk bn using a modified chemical solution route in isopropanol ( ipa ) at 50degreesc and with ultrasonicating , and subsequently fluorinated with a solution of fluoboric acid ( hbf4 ) .
the fluorinated h - bnnss exhibit a significant characteristic of a semiconductor , with a current up to 15.854 mua .
methods all chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co. ltd .
( shanghai , china ) and used without further purification .
exfoliation of bulk bn to few - layered or mono - layered h - bnnss in a typical exfoliation process , the bulk boron nitride ( bn ) powders ( 0.25 g ) were dispersed in a solvent of ipa contained in a 100 - ml round - bottomed flask , and then as - formed solution was heated at 50degreesc for 24 h under magnetic stirring .
subsequently , the solution was subjected to further ultrasonication for 20 h in a low power sonic bath .
then the resulted solution in the flask was stood for 2 days , and the supernatant solution was removed to the centrifugal tube followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min .
afterwards , the precipitate was washed with acetone several times to remove the ipa absolutely and dried at 60degreesc overnight .
finally , a milk - white solution of few - layered and mono - layered h - bn nanosheets ( h - bnnss ) were obtained .
fluorination of h - bnnss in a representative fluorination experiment , as - prepared h - bn nanosheets ( 0.25 g ) and hbf4 ( 50 ml ) were mixed in a 100 - ml round - bottomed flask .
then the mixture was heated at 50degreesc for 8 h under magnetic stirring .
after this treatment , the mixture was cooled to room temperature naturally .
finally , the fluorinated products were removed to the centrifugal tube , washed with deionized water several times , and dried at 60degreesc for several hours .
characterizations the morphologies and structures of the exfoliated and fluorinated products were characterized by a field - emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem , hitachi s - 4800 , tokyo , japan ) equipped with an x - ray energy - dispersive spectrometer ( eds ) , a transmission electron microscope ( tem , jeol , jem - 2010f , jeol ltd. , tokyo , japan ) , an atomic force microscope ( afm , nanoscope iv veeco instruments inc. , plainview , ny , usa ) , and a d / max - 2550 pc powder x - ray diffractometer ( xrd , rigaku co. , tokyo , japan ) .
x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) spectra were conducted on an axis ultra dld x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( kratos co. , manchester , uk ) .
fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy investigations were performed on an ir rrestige - 21 ftir spectrometer ( shimadzu co. , kyoto , japan ) .
results and discussion comparatively , three solvents ( ipa , dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) , and n - methyl pyrrolidone ( nmp )) were used to exfoliate the bulk bn for producing bnnss .
the detailed characterization and analysis are given in figure s1 in additional file 1 .
it is found that under our experimental conditions , the ipa is a better polar solvent to peel off the bulk bn among them .
figure 1 shows the low - and high - magnification fe - sem images and xrd patterns of the bulk bn powders and exfoliated products using the ipa as the solvent .
the low - magnification sem image in figure 1a presents the overall morphology of the precursor , which demonstrates that the bulk bn powders consist of irregular shapes and a few of thick flakes with lateral sizes ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers .
the high - magnification sem images in figure 1b,c reveal the sufficient exfoliation of the bulk bn. clearly , both the thickness and lateral sizes of the exfoliated products are decreased , forming h - bnnss .
figure 1b shows the few - layered h - bnnss which appear like the booming flowers and figure 1c demonstrates the bn nanosheets with a rolling up edge .
in addition , the two upper insets of photographs in figure 1a,b show the precursor ( a ) and exfoliated products ( b ) both dispersed in ipa .
it is found that the milk - white solution of the h - bnnss can remain stable for a long period , even more than 2 weeks .
this is mainly because the exfoliated products are too thin to deposit , suggesting the sufficient peeling of the bulk bn by the presented chemical method .
comparatively , the precursor bn powders in the solution completely deposited on the bottom of the bottle in several minutes , leaving a transparent solution , which is clearly due to the large lateral sizes of the bulk bn precursor .
in the xrd sample preparation process , in order to make the preferential orientation ( 002 ) planes on the holder as much as possible , the xrd sample was prepared as follows .
first , the white powders of as - prepared bn nanosheets were dissolved in the ethanol with ultrasonic dispersion .
second , the dispersing solution was dropwise added on a glass holder which was cleaned by ethanol .
lastly , the glass coated by the dispersing solution was dried at 60degreesc to evaporate the ethanol and form a thin film of these bn nanosheets for the xrd characterization .
shown ( including its inset ) in figure 1d is comparative xrd patterns of the bulk bn powders ( i ) , exfoliated products ( ii ) , respectively , referring to the joint committee on powder diffraction standards ( jcpds card number 34 - 0421 ) ( bottom ) for the standard h - bn powders .
all of the diffraction peaks from the products can be readily indexed to the h - bn with lattice constants of a = b = 2.504 and c = 6.656 a. a series of intensive peaks are at 2theta = 26.764degrees , 41.597degrees , and 55.164degrees , with d - spacing of 3.328 , 2.169 , and 1.663 a , corresponding to the ( 002 ) , ( 100 ) , and ( 004 ) planes of the h - bn , respectively , in which ( 004 ) plane is parallel to ( 002 ) plane. from the amplified patterns in its inset , the intensity of the ( 004 ) plane from the exfoliated products is unusually intensive , by analyzing the intensity ( i ) ratio between ( 100 ) and ( 004 ) planes .
it could visually indicate a very efficient exfoliation from the bulk bn powders by the present route .
in black curve i , the i100 / i004 is approximately 2 ; however , in red curve ii , the i100 / i004 is only approximately 0.25 ( or the i004 / i100 reaches up to approximately 4 ) .
as the h - bnnss have a tendency to lie on their widest facets when they were dispersed randomly in a glass sample holder , the widest facets were the preferential orientations , i.e. , the ( 002 ) ( or 004 ) planes in the xrd measurement .
in fact , the exposed ( 002 ) crystal surface of a h - bn crystal likes the ( 002 ) plane of graphite [ 27 ] , the exfoliation process will occur on the ( 002 ) plane , which would be valuable to exploit more excellent properties of h - bnnss .

transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) ( figure 2a,b,c,d ) and afm ( figure 2e ) images further present the characteristics of the exfoliated products .
figure 2a shows few - layered h - bnnss covering the carbon film , in which the top layers are transparent to the electron beam to see the bottom layers .
figure 2b gives an image of mono - layered h - bnns .
the high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) image in figure 2c demonstrates the hexagonal lattice structure of the h - bnnss , in which the marked white line clearly shows the measured d spacing of 0.22 nm , nearly equaling to the distance of the ( 100 ) planes .
as suggested by the selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) pattern ( figure 2c , inset ) , which was taken with electron beam along [ 001 ] zone axis , perpendicular to the surface of this nanosheet , it reveals the well - crystallized nature and the hexagonal structure characteristic of the exfoliated products .
the layers of h - bnnss can be directly calculated by examining the folded edges with hrtem imaging .
as illustrated in figure 2d , it provides a typical multi - layered h - bnnss with a width of around 2.67 nm ( approximately eight bn ( 002 ) layers ) , corresponding to a distance of the adjacent layers of 0.33 nm , which is quite close to the d002 ( 0.3328 nm ) of bn material .
the nanosheet edge is clean and abrupt on an atomic scale , and there is no amorphous layer covering on its surface .
furthermore , we applied afm and the corresponding height profile to examine the surface nature and to estimate the thickness of the h - bnnss ( figure 2e ) .
it is found that the surface of this sheet is rather flat and its height is 3.732 nm ( approximately 11 bn ( 002 ) layers ) .
the more detailed afm measurements are given in figure s4 in additional file 1 .

after fluorination of the h - bn nanosheets , we studied their electrical conductivities performed on a new stm - tem holder commercialized by nanofactory instruments ab ( gothenburg , sweden ) , which was arranged within a 200 - kv field emission high - resolution tem ( jem - 2010f ) , which has been described in elsewhere [ 28 ] .
the schematic of the experimental setup is represented in figure 3a , as described in our previous studies [ 29 ] .
briefly , an au tip is attached to a fixed electrical sensor , and a pt cantilever adhering with a little of the fluorinated products is placed on the piezo - movable side of the holder .
firstly , the relative position of au tip and pt cantilever is manually adjusted with tweezers under an optical microscope to get a minimal possible gap between them , which can be distinguished by eyes .
then the location of au tip and a fluorinated bn nanosheet is modulated through the nanoscale precision piezo - driven manipulator of stm - tem holder to build a bn bridge circuit ( figure 3d , iii ) .
finally , a pc - compatible software automatically coordinates the final stages and controls the nanosheets displacement and movement rate .
on the basis of the model adopted from the classical electricity , the electrical conductivity of this fluorinated bnns ( iii ) was measured by the dedicated software and electronics from nanofactory instruments ab. to make a careful comparison , the electrical conductivities of the precursor bulk bn ( i ) and the original exfoliated products ( ii ) were also measured .
the tem images of bulk bn and the exfoliated bnns connected between the pt cantilever and au tip are given in figure 3d ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively .
the typical iv characteristic curves are shown in figure 3b , in which an applied voltage arranges from - 50 to 50 v. as we expect , the fluorinated bn nanosheets display a typical semiconductor characteristic of the iv curve ( green ) , and its current value varies from - 15.854 to 13.663 mua .
while the precursor bulk bn shows its intrinsic electric insulation characteristic with no detectable current under the same bias voltage ( black ) .
the current value of the h - bnnss without fluorination ranges from - 300 to 300 na ( red , as shown by a magnified inset ) , which may owe to the indirect to direct bandgap transition [ 30 ] .
the fluorinated h - bnnss possessing an excellent electrical conductivity suggest that the bn material is transformed from the insulator to a semiconductor through the effective doping of f , which will extend their applications in nanoelectronics .

( d ) tem images of bulk bn ( i ) , the exfoliated ( ii ) and fluorinated ( iii ) bnns connected between the pt cantilever and au tip , respectively .
in order to further identify doping f into the h - bnnss , we analyzed the chemical composition of the products by xps ( figure 3c ) and eds ( figure s5 in additional file 1 ) .
figure 3c shows the xps spectra of the exfoliated ( i ) and further fluorinated ( ii ) products , respectively .
the results reveal that b , c , n , o and f elements exist in the fluorinated products , in which the binding energy of b 1s , c 1s , n 1s , o 1s , and f 1s is corresponding to 197.6 , 288.4 , 401.7 , 530.0 , and 686.6 ev , respectively .
the existence of c and o elements commonly seen could attribute to the carbon contamination and water adsorbing from the atmosphere .
comparatively , the curve i only show an existence of the b , c , n and o elements .
it suggests the f element appearing in the fluorinated products is the key factor contributing to the excellent electrical conductivity of the h - bnnss .
if the f only attaches to the surface of bnnss , it will be too unstable to exist under the beam irradiation in the electron microscope [ 23,24 ] , resulting in electrical conductivity that will not be significantly improved .
so , we deduce that the excellent electrical conductivity of the fluorinated bn nanosheets alternatively confirms the f was doped into the few - layered h - bnnss successfully .
conclusions in summary , an excellent electrical conductivity of the exfoliated and fluorinated h - bnnss , i.e. , transferring from the insulator to the semiconductor , has been reported .
a facile chemical route was developed to exfoliate the bulk bn into few - and mono - layered h - bnnss , then a simple chemical solution route successfully fluorinated the bnnss .
importantly , the fluorinated bnnss possesses the excellent electrical property with a current up to 15.854 mua , showing a typical semiconductor characteristic , which will open a new opportunity in designing and fabricating electronic nanodevices .

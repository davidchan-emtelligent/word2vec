introduction the european spallation source ( ess ) in lund , sweden , aspires to becoming the world 's leading neutron source with unprecedented intensity and brightness ( ess official web site , http :// www.europeanspallationsource.se ; peggs et al. , 2012 >). by the end of its construction in 2025 > a suite of 22 neutron scattering instruments will be available to the user community , with seven of them coming online in 2019 > .
the ess neutron pulse is going to be 2.86 ms long with a repetition rate of 14 hz ( peggs et al. , 2012 > , 2013 >) .
a reference suite of neutron scattering instruments is currently being evaluated and it is envisaged that at least two sans instruments will be constructed .
sans is a technique to obtain structural information with a broad range of applicability across soft matter , biology , condensed matter and materials science research , which makes sans instruments some of the most common and highly demanded instruments found at neutron sources around the world [ d22 at ill ( http :// www.ill.eu / instruments - support / instruments - groups / instruments / d22 / description / instrument - layout /) , kws at frm - ii ( http :// www.frm2.tum.de / wissenschaftliche - nutzung / diffraktion / kws - 1 / index.html ) , sans2d at isis ( http :// www.isis.stfc.ac.uk / instruments / sans2d / sans2d3000.html )] .
this paper focuses on how the particular instrument characteristics determine the technology choices and optimization process for detector design .
the relevant requirements for one of the ess sans instruments currently being investigated are a broad q range , where ( lambda is the neutron wavelength and theta is the scattering angle ) , simultaneously accessible in a single measurement ( 10 - 3 < q < 1 a - 1 ) and a detector polar - angle resolution deltatheta / theta of 10 % or better .
in the following sections a novel detector concept is described that fulfils the aforementioned conditions , whilst vastly improving the data - collection efficiency over present sans instruments .
the main technical characteristics of such a detector are calculated analytically and discussed .
2. the novel detector geometry typically , sans instruments at neutron sources such as reactors or spallation sources have used a single position - sensitive moveable detector to enable a wide q range to be examined .
there is now a trend towards using multiple detector banks to access a greater range of scattering angle at the same time [ nomad at sns ( http :// neutrons.ornl.gov / nomad /) , nimrod ( http :// www.isis.stfc.ac.uk / instruments / nimrod /) and sandals ( http :// www.isis.stfc.ac.uk / instruments / sandals ) at isis ] , thus facilitating measurement and reducing the data - collection time .
the alternative detector concept proposed here extrapolates this trend to its logical conclusion .
it consists of a tube - like geometry with a polyhedral cross section ( see figs. 1 > and 2 >) , providing a 2pi solid angle coverage by utilizing two segmented detectors , a 10 m - long and 0.5 m - wide tube detector and a forward detector .
the attention of this paper is focused on the tube segment , since the forward detector resembles the traditional sans detector approach .
the advantage of the tube - like geometry is immediately apparent , as a large solid angle and consequently a wide q range are readily accessible ( see fig. 3 >) without the need to interrupt the measurement and shift the detectors up - or downstream .
the detectors and their readout electronics can be installed outside the vacuum tank , leading to a smaller physical size for the latter , which reduces not only the technical challenges but also , potentially , the cost of the setup .
furthermore , the possibility of filling the vacuum tank with a noble gas could be explored , since a gas pressure closer to that of the detector gas eliminates the need for a thick tank wall or even advocates its replacement with a thin foil separating the two gas volumes .
more importantly though , the choice of the detector geometry exploits the material properties of the neutron converter .
since the traditional approach with 3he detectors is no longer a viable option for ess instruments , owing to the unavailability of 3he , particularly for the ess , and its high cost ( persons & aloise , 2011 > ; shea & morgan , 2010 > ; cho , 2009 > ; international collaboration on the development of neutron detectors , http :// www.icnd.org ) , an alternative neutron technology solution based on 10b is introduced for this application .
boron carbide ( 10b4c ) thin - film detectors are currently being developed by several groups worldwide and are proven to be a reliable and promising replacement for 3he detectors ( andersen et al. , 2012 > ; zeitelhack , 2012 > ; bigault et al. , 2012 > ; correa , 2012 > ; stefanescu et al. , 2013 > ; hoglund et al. , 2012 >) .
the 10b isotope has a neutron absorption cross section of about 3840 barn ( 1 barn = 10 - 28 m2 ) for thermal neutrons ( lambda = 1.8 a ) ( safford et al. , 1960 >) , which is approximately 70 % of the 3he cross section .
boron itself is an insulator , but in the form of deposited 10b4c it becomes a conductor and therefore an appropriate choice for a cathode material .
in the description assumed here , a thin layer of 10b4c , enriched in 10b to more than 95 % ( hoglund et al. , 2012 >) , coats the inner aluminium walls of the active detector area with a typical coating thickness of 1 microm .
the scattered neutrons traversing the thin film convert with a certain probability , depending on their wavelength .
the products of the capture process , an alpha particle and a 7li ion , are emitted in opposite directions , with energies large enough to allow micrometre - long ranges in the 10b4c film and eventually large enough to escape from the layer , provided the thickness of the latter is optimized for this purpose .
as a result of the back - to - back emission , only one of the products has the possibility of entering the gas detection area .
the other particle is stopped , either inside the converter layer or inside the aluminium substrate on which the converter is coated .
provided one of the charged products exits the layer with sufficient energy left , it ionizes the detector gas , and the signal produced is amplified by an electric field and finally collected by anode wires , as in a typical multi - wire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) ( charpak et al. , 1968 > ; charpak & sauli , 1984 >) .
it becomes apparent that the detector design is a multi - parameter optimization problem , the parameters being , for example , the dimensions and total surface of the detector , the thickness of the 10b4c layer , the anode wire pitch , the gas composition , and the gain , to mention just a few .
the motivation for this work is to present a feasibility study of a design concept , rather than a detailed and mature design .
in that spirit , analytical calculations are used as a first step to this end , aimed at demonstrating whether this detector concept suits the instrument needs and how it can be further optimized .
3. evaluation of the tube detector efficiency the elongated shape of the tube detector causes the neutrons to intersect the conversion layer at shallow incident angles (< 10degrees ) at a distance of only 1 - 2 m from the sample .
small incident angles lead to longer neutron paths through the 10b4c layer and to a higher conversion probability from algebraic considerations .
moreover , with a suitable optimization of the layer thickness , the escape probability of the ions can be increased as well .
the combination of the two effects results in a high detection efficiency .
the idea of enhancing detection efficiency by reducing the neutron incident angle has been used successfully by other groups as well ( henske et al. , 2012 > ; piscitelli et al. , 2012 > ; nowak et al. , 2012 >) .
the detection mode for the conversion products is the ' back - scattering ' one ( see fig. 4 >) , since it results in a fundamentally better efficiency than the transmission mode ( see fig. 5 >) .
for cold - neutron detection in particular , the back - scattering mode is the most suitable option for obtaining a high detection efficiency .
since the neutrons always hit the converter layer at small angles over almost the entire surface , and at such angles the measurements are of higher relevance for the sans method , the efficiency values are well above 50 % in the areas where the detector occupancy , i.e. the fraction of hits per channel or unit area , is high .
the largest part of the difference between the detection of an li ion and an alpha particle is accounted for in the algebraic efficiency calculations , as the two particles have different ranges in the coating layer .
for the purposes of this study , the intrinsic detection efficiency of the gaseous detector is reasonably assumed to be very high ( sauli , 1977 > ; klein , 2000 > ; stefanescu et al. , 2013 >) , with every ion escape leading to a detection event .
the conversion layer thickness can be optimized to increase the back - scattering detection efficiency further , as shown in fig. 6 > ( piscitelli & van esch , 2013 >) , but the optimization procedure for this parameter is not addressed in this paper .
4. real space and time resolution of the tube detector apart from the high detection efficiency , the elongated geometry of the tube detector results in an excellent polar angle ( theta ) resolution .
the shallow angle of the incident neutrons throughout the largest part of the detector is responsible for the very small polar - angle differences between neutrons whose conversion products are detected between consecutive wires ( see fig. 1 >) ; the result is a significant resolution improvement compared with what can be achieved with the traditional geometry , where the incident neutron hits the detector perpendicularly .
in addition to that , the traditional parallax effects of a 3he tube are almost completely eliminated with the use of a boron - coated mwpc .
for a 5 cm - thick 3he tube and a neutron incident angle of 10degrees , the total possible path of the neutron is about 28 cm. in the case of the tube detector , the same incident angle results in a 5.7 microm path for a 1 microm converter thickness .
thus , the tube detector overcomes the parallax effect , as the possible absorption points are far more localized in a thin 10b4c layer than in a large active gas volume .
any smearing is related to the range of any ions produced inside the mwpc gas , which is of the order of a few millimetres ( correa , 2012 >) , although this is small compared with the wire pitches considered here .
ignoring for the moment possible scattering of the neutrons at the walls of the vacuum tank , and assuming that the conversion products are detected by the wire nearest to the conversion point , the polar angle resolution on the yz plane may be expressed by the difference for this discussion the impact of the instrument collimator on the polar - angle resolution is not considered .
the position resolution of the detector along the z axis is half the anode - wire pitch .
the index n counts the half - pitch steps along the imaginary line that connects the wires , starting from the higher theta angles ( 90degrees perpendicular to the beam axis ) and moving towards 0degrees ( parallel to the beam axis ) .
the impact of the wire pitch on the theta resolution is depicted in fig. 7 > for a 10 m - long and 0.5 m - wide detector .
already , very close to the entrance window of the detector near the sample , the deltatheta values are small enough to give deltatheta / theta of less than 10 % , in agreement with the requirements discussed in s2 .
furthermore , the wider wire pitch of 5 cm seems to be a suitable starting choice , bearing in mind that a lower number of readout channels is beneficial for the overall cost of the setup .
the aforementioned calculations are performed without taking the azimuthal angle phi into consideration ( see fig. 2 > for the definition of phi ) .
the influence of phi on the theta resolution is depicted in fig. 8 > for a wire pitch of 5 cm. the deltatheta values for phi = 30degrees are compared with deltatheta for phi = 0degrees .
it is clear that the impact of the phi angle on the polar - angle resolution is negligible , regardless of the number of faces of the detector cross section .
the phi resolution is determined by the number of faces of the tube detector .
for an octagonal cross section it is 45degrees and for an hexagonal one it is 60degrees .
this is acceptable for azimuthally symmetric scattering that can be averaged to a one - dimensional scattering curve , but is not suitable for studies of oriented systems where good azimuthal resolution is required .
for such cases , the addition of a second set of perpendicular anode wires or a strip - type cathode readout could be considered , but the investigation of such a concept lies outside the scope of this paper .
another aspect of the detector concept that can be calculated analytically is the time resolution based on the time - of - flight ( tof ) differences between consecutive n points .
following the same definition as for the theta resolution , the tof resolution along the z axis may be expressed as as expected , the arrival time differences are larger for a larger wire pitch and the separation between wavelengths for the same pitch increases with increasing pitch ( see fig. 9 >) .
the impact of the azimuthal angle on the time resolution is calculated to be negligible .
the tof resolution values of the tube detector are well below the timing uncertainties stemming from the ess pulse length of 2.86 ms , so they do not pose a concern for the detector design per se .
5. q range and resolution having calculated the real space and time characteristics of the tube detector , the next step is to translate these to the physics variables relevant to neutron scattering techniques .
the momentum transfer q relates to the scattering angle theta and the neutron wavelength lambda according to equation ( 1 ) .
for the wavelengths used in sans and the scattering angles accessible with this detector , the q space accessible is depicted in fig. 3 > for a selection of wavelengths .
the q range satisfies the requirements of a typical instrument in this respect , thanks to the selected geometry .
the uncertainties in the determination of the polar angle and the neutron wavelength have an impact on the q resolution .
the latter is expressed as from the relation of lambda to the time of flight t , and the distance l between the sample and the hit on the wire plane , the deltalambda resolution is calculated to be assuming that measured time and distance are independent variables .
for the sake of the present discussion , the time of flight has been calculated using the distance of the neutron from the wire and its velocity .
propagating the resolution values for the polar angle , time of flight and distance , the lambda and q resolution dependencies as a function of the distance from the sample for phi = 0degrees are presented in figs. 10 > - 13 > > > .
the influence of phi on these calculations is negligible , as mentioned earlier .
the calculation of q resolution presented in equation ( 5 ) is the convolution of the detector angle resolution with the wavelength resolution due to the time of flight uncertainties , without taking into account the contributions of other instrument , beam and sample parameters .
it is the theoretical intrinsic q resolution of the tube detector .
the improvement in angle resolution with the use of a tilted geometry translates to an improved q resolution , as expressed in the first term of equation ( 5 ) .
assuming the same spatial resolution of 1 cm for both the forward and tube detectors , the resulting polar - angle resolution is about 40 times higher for the tilted geometry at the point where the two detectors meet .
6. background considerations the proposed geometry might be prone to background arising from neutrons being scattered on one side of the detector and hitting an opposite or neighbouring side , giving rise to a mislocated signal , as illustrated in fig. 14 > .
solutions to this problem exist .
as an example , fig. 14 > depicts an absorbing conical structure that separates the vacuum tank into two parts .
the exterior of the cone could contain a noble gas at normal atmospheric pressure , thus reducing the volume where the vacuum has to be maintained .
neutrons that travel towards the forward detector continue their course uninterrupted , while those scattered on the side walls of the vacuum tank are absorbed and prevented from creating a fake signal .
another solution is proposed in fig. 15 > .
geometric winglet - shaped absorbers , which might be thought of as flattened out radial collimators , are installed along the walls of the vacuum tank , covering full azimuthal angle .
they act similarly to the cone structure , disallowing any direct view between a scattering point on the tank wall and the detection surface .
furthermore , they enhance the structural rigidity of the tank , leading to thinner walls and a subsequent reduction in scattering .
both geometric arrangements reject a large proportion of the scattered neutrons .
the latter one offers a better handle on the problem owing to better solid - angle shadowing .
this will ensure that the background problem is not greater than with present sans arrangements .
furthermore , in a realistic scenario two layers of detection could be used , exploiting the neutron energy - discrimination idea indicated by hall - wilton ( 2012 >) .
detailed simulations and engineering design will provide a better description of the background and help qualify the most suitable solution for a particular implementation .
7. conclusions a new detector concept for a broadband sans instrument was presented and its main characteristics evaluated by means of analytical calculations .
a novel tube - like geometry , combining an alternative neutron converter and the principle of an mwpc , was discussed .
the most important aspects of the detector performance were studied , with the aim of demonstrating the suitability of the concept for the particular application .
the outcome of this study shows that the calculated resolutions , even with a preliminary choice of detector dimensions and wire pitch , fully satisfy the requirements of the proposed instrument from the detector point of view .
the properties of the detector design , in combination with the apparent simplicity of the detection geometry and the potentially low cost , make it an appropriate choice for instruments at ess and elsewhere .

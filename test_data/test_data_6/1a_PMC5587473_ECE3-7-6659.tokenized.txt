abstract all too often , studies of sexual selection focus exclusively on the responses in one sex , on single traits , typically those that are exaggerated and strongly sexually dimorphic .
they ignore a range of less obvious traits and behavior , in both sexes , involved in the interactions leading to mate choice .
to remedy this imbalance , we analyze a textbook example of sexual selection in the stalk - eyed fly ( diasemopsis meigenii ) .
we studied several traits in a novel , insightful , and efficient experimental design , examining 2,400 male - female pairs in a " round - robin " array , where each female was tested against multiple males and vice versa .
in d. meigenii , females exhibit strong mate preference for males with highly exaggerated eyespan , and so we deliberately constrained variation in male eyespan to reveal the importance of other traits .
males performing more precopulatory behavior were more likely to attempt to mate with females and be accepted by them .
however , behavior was not a necessary part of courtship , as it was absent from over almost half the interactions .
males with larger reproductive organs ( testes and accessory glands ) did not make more mating attempts , but there was a strong tendency for females to accept mating attempts from such males .
how females detect differences in male reproductive organ size remains unclear .
in addition , females with larger eyespan , an indicator of size and fecundity , attracted more mating attempts from males , but this trait did not alter female acceptance .
genetic variation among males had a strong influence on male mating attempts and female acceptance , both via the traits we studied and other unmeasured attributes .
these findings demonstrate the importance of assaying multiple traits in males and females , rather than focusing solely on prominent and exaggerated sexually dimorphic traits .
the approach allows a more complete understanding of the complex mating decisions made by both males and females .

2017 ; 7 : 6659 - 6668 . https :// doi.org / 10.1002 / ece3.3225 1 introduction sex is a complex interplay between individuals of the two sexes .
many factors such as quality , experience , and competitive ability influence mating decisions across space and time ( e.g. , andersson , 1994 ; cotton , small , & pomiankowski , 2006 ; miller & svensson , 2014 ) .
despite this complexity , many studies have adopted a simplifying approach of evaluating the importance of variation in individual traits , usually in one sex ( typically males ) .
much attention has been paid to species where males bear traits that are attractive to females or are used in aggressive competition for mating opportunities ( andersson , 1994 ) .
often , these species involve exaggerated male sexual traits ( ornaments and weapons ) that can be easily quantified and sometimes manipulated by researchers ( andersson , 1994 ; bonduriansky , 2007 ; kraaijeveld , kraaijeveld - smit , & komdeur , 2007 ) .
while prominent sexual ornaments ( and female preferences for them ) and weapons are important , other traits in both sexes that are less obvious , or not so easily measured , are likely to explain a considerable fraction of the variance in mating success .
it is often overlooked that males use several criteria to decide whether and to what degree they court females or choose between available females ( bergstrom & real , 2000 ; bonduriansky , 2001 ; cotton , cotton , small , & pomiankowski , 2015 ; edward & chapman , 2011 ; green & madjidian , 2011 ; hooper & miller , 2008 ; kokko & johnstone , 2002 ; servedio & lande , 2006 ) .
species with exaggerated sexual ornaments frequently possess a suite of other less extravagant but nonetheless dimorphic morphological traits (" multiple sexual traits ") that are displayed together with several complex courtship behaviors ( candolin , 2003 ; girard , elias , & kasumovic , 2015 ; hebets , stafstrom , rodrigues , & wilgers , 2011 ; jones , byrne , & wallman , 2014 ; lehtonen , rintakoski , & lindstrom , 2007 ; patricelli , uy , & borgia , 2003 ) .
similarly , multiple traits influence fighting ability and contest resolution , not just the main weapon ( hall , mclare , brooks , & lailvaux , 2010 ; lailvaux , herrel , vanhooydonck , meyers , & irschick , 2004 ; zeng , zhu , & kang , 2016 ) .
in addition , females are not passive partners but interact with males during courtship , leading males to persist with or abandon mating attempts ( stockley & bro - jorgensen , 2011 ) .
in order to more fully understand the varied mechanisms that underpin mate choice and the resultant selective pressures on both sexes , it is vital to adopt inclusive experimental designs that account for the multiple traits involved in male - female interactions ( girard et al. , 2015 ; jones et al. , 2014 ; parton , 2013 ) .
these considerations motivated this study of stalk - eyed flies , model organisms for studies of sexual selection ( chapman , pomiankowski , & fowler , 2005 ) .
in a number of stalk - eyed fly species , male eyespan is a highly exaggerated , condition - dependent trait ( cotton , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2004a,b ; david et al. , 1998 ; knell , fruhauf , & norris , 1999 ) , subject to directional female preference ( cotton , rogers , small , pomiankowski , & fowler , 2006 ; hingle , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2001 ; wilkinson & reillo , 1994 ) and provides indirect genetic benefits , both for good genes ( bellamy , chapman , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2013 ; david , bjorksten , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2000 ) and against meiotic drive genes ( cotton , foldvari , cotton , & pomiankowski , 2014 ; wilkinson & reillo , 1994 ) , and direct fertility benefits for females ( harley et al. , 2013 ) .
male eyespan also plays a role in intrasexual antagonistic interactions to determine ownership of lek breeding sites , with larger eyespan males being victorious more frequently in confrontations ( burkhardt & de la motte , 1983 ; small , cotton , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2009 ; wilkinson & reillo , 1994 ) .
as in other species influenced by an obvious sexually dimorphic trait , there appear to be several subtle male behaviors involved .
for example , in the african stalk - eyed fly , diasemopsis meigenii , males follow females while bobbing their abdomens ( personal observations , chapman ) .
in addition , females take an active role in rejecting some male mating attempts by extension of their ovipositors to prohibit copulation and vigorous body shaking to dislodge mounted males .
in the malaysian stalk - eyed fly , teleopsis dalmanni , there is evidence that male reproductive organ size ( testes and accessory glands ) affects mating rate .
males with larger testes and accessory glands attract more females to their lek sites ( even after controlling for body size covariation ; cotton , small , hashim , & pomiankowski , 2010 ) , and these well - endowed males gain more matings under controlled laboratory conditions ( baker et al. , 2003 ; fry , 2006 ; hingle et al. , 2001 ; rogers et al. , 2005 ; rogers , chapman , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2005 ; rogers , denniff , chapman , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2008 ; wilkinson , kahler , & baker , 1998 ) .
in addition , observations in the wild as well as laboratory experiments demonstrate that t. dalmanni males neither mate at random nor with all females attracted to their lek sites , but rather exert mate preference for females with larger eyespan and higher fecundity ( cotton et al. , 2015 ) .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of a set of additional traits beyond male eyespan .
we examined how variation in female eyespan , male reproductive traits ( testes and accessory glands ) , and male behavior directed at females affected male - female interactions .
we measured two outcomes , male mating attempts and female acceptance or rejection of those attempts .
mating attempts appear to be largely under male control , as males approach and mount females .
in contrast , acceptance or rejection of these mating attempts appears to be largely under female control , given that female action leads to the dislodging of unwanted male mounting .
we obtained our focal males from a set of highly inbred lines and an outbred control ( bellamy et al. , 2013 ) .
this enabled us to determine whether there were male genetic effects on mating attempts and acceptance , and hence , whether there are genetic benefits to females associated with male - female mating interactions .
in order to highlight any role of the additional candidate traits , we severely constrained variation in male eyespan .
we also removed the opportunity for intrasexual antagonistic interactions ( either in males or in females ) to influence mate choice , by using an assay design that paired single males with single females .
the experimental work was set up on a scale much larger than is typical of mate choice assays .
in part , this was motivated by the expectation that the noncanonical traits we were looking to assess were likely to have less extreme consequences for mating .
we analyzed the responses of 240 males , sequentially presented to 10 females , in total requiring observations of 2,400 male - female pairs .
in order to make this a feasible approach , male - female pairings were evaluated in a round - robin design , so that each set of 10 females was provided sequentially with each of 10 males .
in this way , an observer typically monitored the mating behavior of 100 pairings per day , gaining information on 10 females and 10 males .
this proved to be an efficient , balanced , and sufficiently large - scale way of obtaining concrete evidence about the mating decisions made by each of the sexes .
2 materials and methods 2.1 source populations two populations provided flies for this study .
an outbred stock population of d. meigenii was founded from flies collected by s. hilger in 2000 from south africa .
these flies have been maintained in laboratory cage culture (> 200 individuals to minimize inbreeding ) at 25degreesc , fed pureed corn twice weekly , on a 12:12 hr light : dark cycle , with fifteen - minute artificial " dawn " and " dusk " periods ( reduced illumination ) at the start and end of the light phase .
a suite of inbred lines was also used that had been created by pairing virgin males and females at random and then enforcing brother - sister pair matings for 11 generations ( bellamy et al. , 2013 ) .
at the end of this period of intense inbreeding ( inbreeding coefficient = 0.926 , probability of fixation = 0.859 ; falconer & mackay , 1996 ) , lines were established in population cage culture under the same conditions as those of the stock outbred population .
these lines constitute snapshots of the genetic variation in the laboratory population .
there was no selection imposed during inbreeding beyond that invoked by inbreeding itself , which has the effect of eliminating those lines in which strongly deleterious recessives had been made homozygous .
this was evident in that of 105 original lines , 27 survived to become established in population cage culture .
as survivors , these lines represent nondeleterious genetic combinations .
we drew males from 12 of the surviving lines for the experiments reported here .
males from each line were largely homozygous and , more importantly , genetically distinct from those in other lines .
the presence of significant effects due to line is indicative of segregating genetic variation in the morphological , reproductive , and behavioral traits that we monitored .
we also compared the inbred line males to outbred stock population males .
this was in order to calibrate whether the inbred flies were in deficient in any way in their traits and degree of mating success .
2.2 flies for experiments experimental male flies were generated from inbred and outbred line cages by inserting petri dishes lined with moist cotton wool and excess pureed corn and collecting eggs .
eclosed males were separated from females before reaching 3 weeks of age to ensure virginity .
at least 48 hr before use , flies were anaesthetized on ice , measured for eyespan ( distance between the outermost point of the eyes ) and thorax ( from the top of the head to the apex of the third set of legs ) to the nearest 0.01 mm using nih imagej ( abramoff , magalhaes , & ram , 2004 ; schneider et al. , 2012 ) , and placed in individual pots .
in order to constrain the extent of eyespan variation among males , only those with eyespan in the medium - to - large range between 6.95 and 7.94 mm were used ( male eyespan typically vary between 4.3 and 8.6 mm under laboratory conditions ) .
inbred line females were discarded .
experimental female flies were drawn from the outbred population using the above methods .
no constraint was placed on the range of eyespan of females used in the experiments .
2.3 assays the experiment was set up in blocks of 10 males and 10 females in a round - robin design ( ingleby , hunt , & hosken , 2013 ; mackay et al. , 2005 ) .
all 10 males were tested with one of the 10 females within a bout ( male1 x female1 , male2 x female2 ,... , male10 x female10 ) and then sequentially in the next bout with another female ( male1 x female2 , male2 x female3 ,... , male10 x female1 ) , until all males had been tested with all females ( and vice versa ) .
all observations in a block were made on a single day , with a total of 24 blocks , each having a unique set of males and females per block. by the nature of the round - robin design , each male saw all females in a complementary preordained order , and thereby trial position effects of female or male traits , line , or inbreeding were avoided .
the total sample size was 240 males ( x10 females each ) and 240 females ( x10 males each ) and hence 2,400 male - female pairs .
the males were drawn from the 12 inbred lines and the outbred stock population .
only one male per line ( or stock ) was used per block , and by necessity not every line ( or stock ) was represented each day .
therefore , the total number of males per line over the whole experiment varied between 15 and 21 .
a round - robin design was an efficient way to assess male and female behavior over several mating opportunities .
at the start of observations , a female was taken from her pot and introduced with a pooter into a male 's pot .
males were given 15 min in which to make a mating attempt with a female .
if an attempt was made , then the time was noted and acceptance ( engagement of the male and female genitalia ) or rejection ( female abdominal shaking and kicking until the male is dislodged ) recorded .
accepted matings were carefully interrupted using a pooter to dislodge the male before sperm transfer to maintain her virginity (< 30 s ; cotton , rogers , et al. , 2006 ; harley et al. , 2013 ) .
if no attempt was made in 15 min , then the observation was concluded .
sometimes , the male made a poorly aimed mounting of the female that resulted in him falling off , in which case recording of male behavior continued until a successful mating attempt was made or 15 min had passed .
three male behaviors were recorded , including whether a male followed the female (" follows ") , moved his abdomen up and down (" bobs ") , and engaged his legs with her legs or antennae (" grapples ") .
if a behavior continued for over ten seconds , then each further 10 s was recorded as a new event .
we also recorded fights between males and females , but these were too infrequent for any further analysis ( 13 of 2,358 pairings ) .
each observer set ups 10 pairs to watch simultaneously .
this made it impossible to accurately time exactly how long a male was performing a behavior , and hence , observers kept a tally every 10 s. the pots were kept next to each other and scanned in a line , allowing a large number to be assessed at the same time .
on completion of each block of observations , the males and females were frozen and their eyespan measured .
male eyespan had been constrained experimentally .
female eyespan varied and was taken as a measure of body size .
in addition , male testes and accessory glands were dissected ( figure 1 ) and measured as the length of a line that bisected the middle of the testis or accessory gland to the nearest 0.01 mm ( rogers , chapman , et al. , 2005 ) in nih imagej ( abramoff et al. , 2004 ; schneider et al. , 2012 ; si1 ) .
it was impossible to measure the accessory glands ( 41 / 240 ) and testes ( 15 / 240 ) of some individuals due to breakages during dissection , so such individuals were omitted from analyses of variation in male reproductive traits .
figure 1 testes ( a ) and accessory glands ( b ) of diasemopsis meigenii .
testes and accessory glands are measured by tracing a midline ( denoted by yellow line ) that longitudinally bisects each organ 2.4 statistical analysis statistics were performed in r ( r core team 2013 ) using lme4 ( version 3.2.5 ; bates , maechler , bolker , & walker , 2015 ) , with some simple statistics derived from jmp version 11.2 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
each male - female pair was coded as having shown a mating attempt ( yes / no ) and acceptance / rejection of the mating attempt .
we ran tests of whether the number of mating attempts and acceptance given a mating attempt were related to female eyespan , and male eyespan , reproductive organ size , and behavior .
these outcomes were modeled in generalized linear mixed effect models ( glmms ) , with binomial error structure , fitted by maximum likelihood ( laplace approximation ) , with the logit link function .
reml ( or maximum likelihood ) was used in linear mixed effect models of female ( i.e. , eyespan ) and male traits ( i.e. , eyespan , reproductive organ size , and behavior ) .
models were compared using anova which , along with random and fixed effect sizes , are reported in supporting information .
in all statistical tests , male identity ( random effect ) was nested within inbred line ( random effect ) , as is standard for analyses of genetic lines ( lynch & walsh , 1998 ) .
an analysis based on aicc supported the addition of female identity ( random effect ) and block ( random effect ) to improve model fit , and these two variables were added to all subsequent models .
we initially tested whether mating attempts and acceptance ( given a mating attempt ) were affected by female eyespan .
this was true for attempts but not for accepts ( see section 3 ) and so we included female eyespan as a covariate ( fixed effect ) in all further analyses of attempts .
testes and accessory glands size were highly positively correlated ( see section 3 ) .
to reduce the dimensionality of the male reproductive measures , we used the first principal component of variation of these two traits ( pearson , 1901 ) calculated from the data set of inbred males ( pc loading : testes 0.707 , accessory glands 0.707 , eigenvalue 1.409 , 70.43 % variance explained , chi2 = 38.64 , p < . 001 , n = 183 ) .
a similar approach was taken for the behavioral measures .
as the amount of behavior covaried with time taken to the mating attempt ( when observation ceased ) , we calculated the principal components based on behavioral elements per second .
pc1 reflected more behavior in general ( pc1 loading : follows 0.678 , bobs 0.476 , grapples 0.560 , eigenvalue 1.242 , 41.41 % variance explained , chi2 = 70.26 , p < . 001 ) , and pc2 reflected antagonism between bobs and grapples ( pc2 loading : follows - 0.038 , bobs 0.784 , grapples - 0.620 , eigenvalue 0.964 , 31.12 % variance explained , chi2 = 13.05 , p < . 001 ; n = 1,495 ) .
to test whether there was genetic variation among the 12 male inbred lines in the number of attempts and acceptance , we ran glmms similar in structure to those used above , including male identity ( random effect ) and female eyespan ( fixed effect in mating attempts ) , as covariates .
additional covariates were added to these analyses where they had been shown to be important in previous analyses .
we tested whether the addition of inbred line ( random effect ) improved model fit .
in addition , trait values ( male eyespan , reproductive organ size , and behavior ) were subject to linear mixed effect models , testing for genetic variation between the inbred line males .
these tests for genetic variation were then repeated including data from outbred males to determine whether inbreeding per se influenced the number of mating attempts and acceptance or trait values .
3 results 3.1 female eyespan there was considerable variation in the number of mating attempts received ( range 2 - 10 ) and the number accepted by individual females ( range 0 - 10 ) .
female eyespan showed considerable variation ( range 4.18 - 6.36 mm , mean +/ - sd 5.74 +/ - 0.444 mm , n = 238 ) .
males attempted to mate more often with larger eyespan females ( chi2 = 15.699 , p < . 001 , n = 238 females ) .
however , the mean eyespan of females that accepted male mating attempts did not differ from those who rejected mating attempts ( chi2 = 15.699 , p = . 573 , n = 238 females ; figure 2 ) .
figure 2 ( a ) mean +/ - se eyespan of females that did ( attempt ) or did not ( no attempt ) receive a mating attempt and ( b ) accepted ( accept ) or rejected ( reject ) mating attempts ; *** p < . 001 , ** p < . 01 , * p < . 05 , ns : nonsignificant 3.2 male eyespan , reproductive organ size , and behavior we controlled for male eyespan in the experimental design ( range 6.95 - 7.94 mm , mean +/ - sd = 7.544 +/ - 0.258 mm , n = 224 ) .
the remaining variation in male eyespan was neither associated with the number of mating attempts ( chi2 = 0.379 , p = . 538 , n = 220 males ) nor with the number of acceptances of mating attempts ( chi2 = 1.263 , p = . 261 , n = 213 males ) .
nonetheless , there was variation in male reproductive organ size ( testis range 2.664 - 4.232 mm , 3.405 +/ - 0.327 mm , n = 210 ; accessory glands range 1.001 - 1.878 mm , 1.409 +/ - 0.190 mm , n = 186 ) .
we combined these traits into a single principal component as the size of the two reproductive organs was strongly positively correlated ( pearson rho183 = 0.401 , p < . 001 , n = 183 ) .
variation in male reproductive organ size was not associated with the number of mating attempts ( chi2 = 0.166 , p = . 684 , n = 183 males ) .
there was a tendency for the number of acceptances of mating attempts to increase with reproductive organ size , but this relationship did not reach significance ( chi2 = 2.972 , p = . 085 , n = 177 males ) .
male behavior directed at females was recorded in more than half of individual pairings ( 52.0 % , n = 2,200 ) .
the behavioral traits occurred at different frequencies : follows in 688 , bobs in 860 , and grapples in 263 cases .
the separate elements of behavior were combined into two principal components .
in pairings that led to a mating attempt , males performed more pc1 behavior ( chi2 = 190.440 , p < . 001 , n = 2,186 matings ) and more pc2 behavior ( chi2 = 7.721 , p = . 005 , n = 2,186 matings ) compared to when they did not .
a model with both pc1 and pc2 behaviors showed that both components of behavior were independently more intense when there was a mating attempt ( chi2 = 44.563 , p < . 001 , n = 2,186 matings ) .
when the mating attempt was accepted , males performed more pc1 behavior ( chi2 = 7.451 , p = . 006 , n = 1,385 matings ) , but variation in pc2 behavior did not differ between accepted or rejected mating attempts ( chi2 = 0.050 , p = . 823 , n = 1,385 matings , figure 3 ) .
figure 3 ( a ) mean +/ - se pc1 behavior and pc2 behavior of males that did ( attempt ; black ) or did not ( no attempt ; white ) make a mating attempt and ( b ) had their attempts accepted ( accept ; black ) or rejected ( reject ; white ) .
*** p < . 001 , ** p < . 01 , * p < . 05 , ns : nonsignificant as male reproductive organ size was negatively associated with variation in pc1 behavior ( chi2 = 7.451 , p = . 006 , n = 1,385 matings ) , although not with pc2 behavior ( chi2 = 0.050 , p = . 823 , n = 1,385 matings ) , the analyses of behavior above were repeated with pc reproductive organ size as a control covariate .
this did not change any of the observed relationships of pc1 or pc2 behavior with either mating attempts or acceptance of mating attempts ( see supporting information ) .
3.3 male genetic variation inbred lines showed variation in male eyespan ( chi2 = 9.883 , p = . 002 , n = 12 lines ) , pc reproductive organ size ( chi2 = 47.595 , p < . 001 , n = 12 lines ) , pc1 behavior ( chi2 = 5.866 , p = . 015 , n = 12 lines ) , and pc2 behavior ( chi2 = 4.295 , p = . 038 , n = 12 lines ; figure 4 ) .
after adding covariates for the phenotypic traits that were important in previous analyses of mating attempts ( pc1 and pc2 behavior ) and acceptance ( pc reproductive organ size and pc1 behavior ) , there was evidence of an effect of inbred line on mating attempts ( chi2 = 7.451 , p = . 006 , n = 12 lines ) and on acceptance given a mating attempt ( chi2 = 9.794 , p = . 002 , n = 12 lines ) .
figure 4 mean +/ - se ( a ) pc reproductive organ , ( b ) pc1 behavior and ( c ) pc2 behavior for the 12 inbred lines the focal inbred males were compared to stock outbred males .
inbred and outbred males did not differ in eyespan ( chi2 = 0.756 , p = . 385 , n = 236 males ) , pc reproductive organ size ( chi2 = 0.408 , p = . 523 , n = 196 males ) , pc1 behavior ( chi2 = 0.004 , p = . 950 , n = 240 males ) , or pc2 behavior ( chi2 = 0.917 , p = . 338 , n = 240 males ) .
outbred males did not make more mating attempts ( chi2 = 0.065 , p = . 799 , n = 240 males ; mean +/ - se. proportion attempts made within 900s , outbred = 0.67 +/ - 0.05 , inbred = 0.63 +/ - 0.02 ) and nor were they accepted more frequently than inbred males ( chi2 = 0.755 , p = . 385 , n = 190 males ; mean +/ - se proportion accepts given an attempt , outbred = 0.32 +/ - 0.08 , inbred = 0.36 +/ - 0.02 ) .
4 discussion studies of sexual selection have emphasized the importance of mate preference for prominent , exaggerated sexual traits ( andersson , 1994 ; davies , krebs , & west , 2012 ; maynard smith & harper , 2003 ) .
this is true of stalk - eyed fly species , where research effort has focused on male eyespan , which is greatly expanded beyond that seen in females , and can even exceed body length ( baker & wilkinson , 2003 ; chapman et al. , 2005 ) .
but as with other examples where sexual selection has produced highly exaggerated male characters , these are not the only traits that govern male - female interactions over mating ( e.g. , aquiloni , massolo , & gherardi , 2009 ; bro - jorgensen , 2010 ; jones et al. , 2014 ; starnberger , preininger , & hodl , 2014 ) .
here we investigated the importance of other male ( testis and accessory gland sizes ) and female ( eyespan ) morphological traits , as well as male behaviors that precede mating and might be elements of male courtship .
these additional traits were assessed through two outcome variables , namely male mating attempts and female acceptance or rejection of such mating attempts .
in addition , we looked for evidence of genetic variation underlying the male characters as well as affecting mating decisions , using a suite of inbred lines , in comparison with outbred control flies .
in order to study these additional traits , we adopted a round - robin design in which 240 males were paired with 10 females each , and in parallel 240 females were paired with 10 males .
the advantage of this approach was that it was feasible to analyze a very large number of male - female pairings , 2,400 in total .
each observer monitored up to 10 pairs at a time , for a maximum of 15 min each , and so could track the 10 x 10 sets in each round - robin block within a reasonable experimental period per day ( 150 - minute observation plus setup and handling time ) .
this meant that the intensity of study of males and females was equal - - an advantage given that we were studying male mating attempts and female acceptance or rejection of those attempts .
the large - scale approach was in particular useful in the behavioral analysis , as behavioral elements were not observed in all interactions and sometimes infrequently .
the design did force a compromise , as behaviors were measured in 10 - second intervals rather than as continuous variables .
this potentially could be overcome by making video recordings for subsequent analysis .
we recommend the round - robin design for future studies of mating behavior .
we found that males preferred attempting to mate with large eyespan females .
such male choice echoes the finding that males mate for longer and ejaculate more sperm when mating with large eyespan females ( harley et al. , 2013 ) .
in addition , in the related stalk - eyed fly species t. dalmanni , males show preference for large eyespan females , both in the wild and under controlled laboratory conditions ( cotton et al. , 2015 ) .
the likely reason for male preference in both these stalk - eyed fly species is that female eyespan strongly correlates positively with fecundity ( cotton et al. , 2015 ; harley et al. , 2013 ) .
similar male preference for female traits that are good predictors of fecundity has been observed in a range of species , typically for traits correlated with female size ( bonduriansky , 2001 ) and female ornament size , when ornaments are female specific ( amundsen 2000 , amundsen and forsgren , 2001 ) or exaggerated in both sexes ( baldauf , bakker , kullmann , & thunken , 2011 ; doutrelant et al. , 2008 ; potti , canal , & serrano , 2013 ) .
this finding does not identify the character used by males , as female eyespan is tightly correlated with body size and other morphological traits both in d. meigenii and other stalk - eyed fly species ( cotton et al. , 2004b , 2015 ; harley et al. , 2013 ) .
we expected that males with larger reproductive organs would make more mating attempts because they are less constrained in their reproductive resources ( dewsbury , 1982 ; moore , harris , montrose , levin , & moore , 2004 ; preston , stevenson , pemberton , & wilson , 2001 ; rogers , chapman , et al. , 2005 ) .
however , there was no relationship between the number of mating attempts and reproductive organ size ( the first principal component of accessory gland size and testis size ) .
our results suggest that male propensity to mate is independent of variation in reproductive organ size .
a simple explanation is that copulations were interrupted before sperm transfer in our experiments .
as a result , males did not suffer ejaculate depletion and their accessory glands and testes remained fully laden throughout the experiment .
presumably , if we had allowed ejaculation to take place , males with larger reproductive organs would have been able to make more mating attempts .
this notion is supported by the observation in t. dalmanni that accessory gland size ( but not testis size ) is phenotypically and genetically related to mating frequency ( baker et al. , 2003 ; rogers , baker , et al. , 2005 ; rogers , chapman , et al. , 2005 ) .
as females control acceptance , we did not expect that females would be more likely to accept mating attempts from males with larger reproductive organs .
females can knock males off through violent body shaking and avoid engagement with male genitalia by ovipositor extension ( cotton , rogers , et al. , 2006 ) .
yet there was a strong tendency toward males with larger reproductive organs being accepted more frequently once a mating attempt had been initiated .
a similar result has been reported in drosophila melanogaster , where males with large accessory glands were accepted for copulation more frequently ( bangham , chapman , & partridge , 2002 ) .
it seems unlikely that females directly identified males with large testes and accessory glands via visual assessment .
while the reproductive organs of adult stalk - eyed flies grow and vary in size with age and nutritional status ( in t. dalmanni ; baker et al. , 2003 ; rogers et al. , 2008 ) , adult fly external body size and shape are fixed at eclosion ( buschbeck , roosevelt , & hoy , 2001 ) .
indirect evaluation mechanisms are plausible .
under normal conditions , females could have used the male ornament and body size , which are positively correlated with internal reproductive organ size ( cotton et al. , 2010 ; rogers et al. , 2008 ) , as is the case in several other insect species ( bangham et al. , 2002 ; fairn , schulte - hostedde , & yves , 2007 ; oh , kim , yoon , kim , & kim , 2014 ) .
but in our experimental design any information from male eyespan was explicitly constrained so that it could not serve as a proxy for male reproductive organ size ( these traits were not correlated , pearson rho183 = - 0.031 , p = . 682 ) .
similarly for d. melanogaster , the greater success of males with large accessory glands was evident after controlling for body size ( bangham et al. , 2002 ) .
premating male display is a possible signal ( see below ) , but there was no consistent association of male behavior with reproductive organ size ( see supporting information ) .
other possibilities are male contact pheromones ( e.g. , starnberger et al. , 2014 ) or female detection of differences in weight once the male has mounted ( schlaepger & mcneil , 2000 ) .
these hypotheses have not been investigated in stalk - eyed flies .
our results suggest that there are additional cues used by females to assess males that attempt to mate with them , and they are worthy of further investigation .
in this study , we tracked a diversity of male behaviors that could be construed as " courtship. " the behaviors involved the male following behind a female , bobbing his abdomen and engaging his legs and antennae with hers .
these behaviors are not exaggerated but are a definite and repeated feature of male activity in the presence of females .
but we note that in about half of male - female pairs , a mating attempt occurred without any behavior at all and in many cases led to acceptance by the female .
although the mean time to mating in d. meigenii was several minutes ( mean +/ - sd = 288.46 +/ - 247.31 s ) , male - female interactions prior to mating can be very brief ( lower bound of range 10 s ) .
so these behaviors cannot be construed as necessary courtship signals that inevitably precede a mating attempt or acceptance by the female .
nonetheless , males that performed more behaviors per unit time made more mating attempts .
this was true for both principal components , the first which simply reflected more behavior ( pc1 ) and the second which reflected an antagonism between more abdomen bobbing and less " talking " engagement of antennae and legs ( pc2 ) .
in addition , males that performed more behaviors ( pc1 only ) were more likely to be accepted after mounting ; this difference suggests that all of the behavioral components are signals that females take into account , and the greater weight on abdomen bobbing versus " grapples " was of lesser importance .
however , the information content of these behaviors is not obvious .
it is possible that they contribute to mutual coordination between male and female .
but this is hard to assess because unlike many other species ( faggioni et al. , 2017 ; marshall - ball , mann , & slater , 2006 ; soma & iwama , 2017 ) there was no evident reciprocal female behavior toward the male .
although one could envisage that the male behaviors may incur some energetic costs , it is unlikely that they act as " handicaps ," creating a condition - dependent cost for the male that performs them ( iwasa , pomiankowski , & nee , 1991 ; kuijper , pen , & weissing , 2012 ) .
so it seems unlikely they are signals of male quality .
we also compared the performance of males from a set of inbred lines to assess genetic variation underlying mating outcomes .
there was genetic ( between - line ) variation in all of the male traits measured : eyespan , reproductive organ size , and behavior ( both principal components ) .
there was also genetic variation underlying the rate at which males made mating attempts and in the rate of female acceptance of male mating attempts .
the latter tests were carried out with appropriate control for those phenotypic traits already shown to have importance in mating attempts ( pc1 and pc2 behavior ) and acceptance ( pc reproductive organ size and pc1 behavior ) , indicating that there was genetic variation in these outcomes in addition to that relating to the morphological and behavioral trait genetic differences between lines .
this indicates that other unmeasured features contributed to the outcome of male - female mating interactions .
these results point to additional female benefits , as paternal genetic variation in testis and accessory gland size , as well as in behavior elicited during mating interactions , will be inherited and so potentially contribute to the reproductive success of sons in the next generation. whether these genetic consequences are connected to " good genes " viability benefits to both male and female offspring ( iwasa et al. , 1991 ; kuijper et al. , 2012 ) cannot be resolved from this work .
it should be noted that the genetic lines used in the experiments represent an initial random sample of genetic variation from our stock population of d. meigenii , filtered through several generations of brother - sister inbreeding , which will have eliminated deleterious alleles ( bellamy , fowler , & pomiankowski , 2014 ; bellamy et al. , 2013 ). of the > 100 lines initiated , around 20 % survived the initial period of intense inbreeding , in part because of the uncovering of recessive deleterious alleles ( bellamy et al. , 2013 ) .
this culling and subsequent adaptive change may explain the lack of evidence of inbreeding depression in traits , attempts , or acceptance when the inbred lines were compared to outbred control males .
in natural populations , there is likely to be much more segregating genetic variation with larger consequences for sexual selection than demonstrated here for a suite of laboratory - adapted inbred lines .
in addition , we hypothesized that differences in eyespan among females might affect their propensity to mate .
female eyespan is positively correlated with female size and fecundity , and more fecund females may need to mate more often to secure their fertility ( cotton , rogers , et al. , 2006 ; harley et al. , 2013 ) .
however , female eyespan did not alter female acceptance or rejection of male mating attempts , a pattern that contrasted with male mating attempts which were more commonly directed at females with larger eyespan ( see above ) .
the former outcome is consistent with previous mate choice studies using d. meigenii that also found no association of female eyespan with the rejection rate ( cotton , rogers , et al. , 2006 ; harley et al. , 2013 ) .
in all of these studies , the experimental design kept females unmated with the benefit that all females had similar mating experience .
however , had females been allowed to mate , then differences related to female eyespan might have been revealed .
females need to mate repeatedly in order to maintain fertility ( baker et al. , 2001 ; harley , fowler , & cotton , 2010 ; rogers , grant , chapman , pomiankowski , & fowler , 2006 ) , so it is likely that larger females need to mate more often to gain sufficient sperm .
on the other hand , large females have higher reproductive value and attract greater male investment per ejaculate and so may need to mate less often than smaller females ( harley et al. , 2013 ) .
these patterns associated with female eyespan merit further investigation .
in conclusion , animals evolve sophisticated means of assessing the quality of potential mates and signaling to members of the opposite sex in order to gain mating opportunities .
many sexual traits and displays are exaggerated and elaborated and have rightly attracted attention .
but in order to form a more comprehensive understanding of sexual selection , it is important to determine the degree to which other factors play a role in mate choice .
we have shown in d. meigenii that a range of behavioral cues is important in mate choice , even though they are not a necessary component of male courtship .
in addition , females are sensitive to male reproductive organ size ( testes and accessory glands ) when choosing among males .
furthermore , our study of inbred lines showed that genetic differences underlie variation between males in their readiness to mate and their attractiveness to females .
these additional traits , in concert with male eyespan ( and genetic variation in that trait ) , contribute to the benefits of mate choice in the stalk - eyed fly .

background hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age .
current treatments for hypertension have adverse side effects and poor adherence .
the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of moxibustion on blood pressure in individuals with pre - or stage i hypertension .
methods / design forty - five subjects with pre - or stage i hypertension will be randomized into three groups : treatment group a ( 2 times / week ) , treatment group b ( 3 times / week ) , and the control group ( non - treated group ) .
the inclusion criteria will be as follows : ( 1 ) aged between 19 and 65 years ; ( 2 ) prehypertension or stage i hypertension ( jnc 7 , seventh report of the joint national committee on the prevention , detection , evaluation , and treatment of high blood pressure ) ; ( 3 ) the participants are volunteers and written consent obtained .
the participants in the treatment group a will undergo indirect moxibustion 2 times per week for 4 weeks , and the participants in the treatment group b will undergo indirect moxibustion 3 times per week for 4 weeks .
the participants in the control group ( non - treated group ) will maintain their current lifestyle , including diet and exercise .
the use of antihypertensive medication is not permitted .
the primary endpoint will be a change in patient blood pressure .
the secondary endpoints will be the body mass index , lipid profile , euroqol and heart rate variability .
the data will be analyzed with the student 's t - test and analysis of variance ( anova ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
discussion the results of this study will help to establish the optimal approach for the care of adults with pre - or stage i hypertension .
trial registration clinical research information service kct0000469 moxibustion hypertension prehypertension background hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases including stroke , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , kidney disease , and peripheral vascular disease [ 1 - 3 ] .
it is estimated that in 2025 , 1.56 billion adults will have hypertension [ 4 ] .
according to the seventh report of the joint national committee on the prevention , detection , evaluation , and treatment of high blood pressure ( jnc - 7 ) , patients with a blood pressure of 120 - 139 / 80 - 89 mmhg have prehypertension [ 5 ] .
a recent study demonstrated that people with prehypertension were more likely to develop hypertension than those with normal blood pressure over the 50 - year follow - up period [ 6 ] .
according to a longitudinal population - based us cohort study , prehypertension increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases [ 7 ] .
the results of another study suggest that prehypertension increases the risk of myocardial infarction , stroke , cardioplegia , and cardiovascular death in women [ 8 ] .
moxibustion involves the application of ignited mugwort ( artemisia vulgaris ) at acupoints or other specific parts of the body to treat or prevent diseases .
this technique is typically used to treat and prevent cold syndrome , deficiency conditions and chronic diseases [ 9 ] .
moxibustion can cause tissue damage as a result of skin irritation or even skin burns due to the thermal stimulation , which is performed at various temperatures .
the thermal stimulation can also cause inflammatory responses and vascular changes .
according to the findings of previous studies of moxibustion , mediators such as histamine and substance p are secreted , and this process promotes angiectasis [ 10 ] .
it seems that inflammatory reactions that affect vascular activity may ease various cardiovascular diseases , including hypertension [ 11 ] .
there are few published randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) concerning moxibustion treatment for prehypertension .
a systematic review on the effects of moxibustion on hypertension revealed no evidence that moxibustion is beneficial to people with hypertension .
however , the differences between specific and non - specific effects should be examined in a future study that includes appropriate control groups [ 11 ] .
methods / design aims of the study the aims of this pilot study are to evaluate the effects of moxibustion on blood pressure in patients with pre - or stage i hypertension , to test the methods used and to calculate the sample size required for future randomized trials .
design this study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial , and participants will be recruited from woo - suk university hospital using notices at the hospital and newspaper advertisements .
in this pilot clinical trial , patients with pre - or stage i hypertension will be analyzed to determine the safety and efficacy of moxibustion , and basic analysis will be performed on the results .
the study participants will voluntarily sign clinical trial consent forms , and all examinations and tests will be performed according to the clinical trial plan .
eligible subjects will be chosen based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria .
participants will be randomized before the first treatment .
forty - five subjects with pre - or stage i hypertension will be randomized into three groups : treatment group a ( 2 times / week ) , treatment group b ( 3 times / week ) , and the control group ( non - treated group ) .
during each moxibustion treatment , each acupoint will be treated five times .
the treatment will continue for 4 weeks .
the follow - up assessment is designed to evaluate the long - term effects of moxibustion .
upon completion of the 4 - week - long treatment , follow - up tests will be conducted at weeks 8,12,16,20 and 24 after randomization ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 flowchart of the study design .
this study has been registered with the ' clinical research information service ,' republic of korea , which is a registry in the who registry network ( kct0000469 ) .
the systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be measured in the arm using an automatic blood pressure meter ( hd - 505 , jawon medical co , kyungsan city , korea ) .
the subjects will be fitted with a bp cuff on both arms .
a trained researcher will measure the blood pressure carefully in the arm with higher bp while the subject is in the seated position .
the blood pressure will be measured three times after the subject has rested for at least 10 min .
all bp measurements will be taken in a temperature - controlled room .
the three measurements will be carried out at 5 - min intervals .
the mean of these three measurements will be used in the data analysis .
the participants will be instructed not to drink caffeinated drinks such as coffee or tea and not to exercise , smoke or eat 2 h before the blood pressure test .
in addition , they will be instructed to avoid drinking heavily the day before the test [ 12 ] .
the practitioner has had more than 3 years of clinical experience since completing 6 years of study at the college of korean medicine and has received a doctor of korean medicine .
randomization this study is designed as a pilot study to calculate the appropriate sample size for future randomized clinical trials .
allowing for a 20 % dropout rate , each group will include 15 participants , which is the minimum sample size necessary to evaluate the effect of moxibustion [ 13,14 ] .
in this study , stratified randomization will be performed by classifying subjects into age and sex by an online centralized randomization service .
ethics this protocol adheres to the principles of the declaration of helsinki and has been approved by the institutional review boards of the woo - suk university hospital , where the study will take place ( wsoh irb 1205 - 02 ) .
before any treatment is given , written consent will be obtained from each participant .
all patients will have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time .

interventions treatment group a the subjects receiving moxibustion treatment will be treated 2 times per week .
during each moxibustion treatment , each acupoint will be treated five times .
the moxibustion treatment will last for 25 min .
the treatment will continue for 4 weeks .
following the procedures used in several previous studies [ 11,15,16 ] , acupuncture needles will be inserted bilaterally into three acupuncture points ( li11 , st36 , gb39 ) on the four peripheral extremities and unilaterally into two points ( cv4 , cv12 ) in the abdominal region .
indirect moxibustion ( manina , haitnim co. , ltd. , korea .
19 mm diameter and 21 mm height ) will be used in the trial .
treatment group b the format will be exactly the same as those for treatment group a , but the subjects receiving moxibustion treatment will be treated three times per week .
control group ( untreated group ) the control group ( untreated group ) will receive no treatment .
the subject in this group will be asked to maintain their normal lifestyle , including diet , exercise and workload .
permitted and prohibited concomitant treatments brochures containing information on dietary changes , living habits , and exercise regimens that help prevent and alleviate hypertension will be distributed to all groups , and the subjects will decide for themselves whether to incorporate the suggested changes into their daily lives .
all groups will be prohibited from undergoing active treatment to lower the blood pressure for the duration of their participation in this clinical trial .
after the completion of the clinical trial , during the assessment period , the subjects will be allowed to decide for themselves whether to receive additional treatment .
any other related information will be recorded in detail .
the use of birth control pills and central nervous system stimulants or depressants , which can affect blood pressure , will remain prohibited .
the practitioner will be allowed to converse with the subjects about daily care and treatment details while carrying out the required examination .
outcome measures the primary outcome measurement in this study is the change in blood pressure before randomization ( baseline ) and 4 weeks after randomization .
blood pressure will be taken at every visit .
the secondary outcome measures will be the mean pulse pressure , body mass index ( bmi ) , heart rate variability ( hrv ) , the modified stress response inventory ( sri - mf ) , the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) , the fatigue severity scale ( fss ) , euroqol ( eq - 5d ) , general assessments and blood tests including fasting blood sugar ( fbs ) , uric acid , lipid profile , high sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) , liver function test ( lft ) , hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , and complete blood count ( cbc ) .
the pulse pressure refers to the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure .
this value reflects the degree of stiffness of the blood vessels .
an increase in the pulse pressure after midlife is recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [ 17 ] .
the bmi will be calculated , and laboratory tests including fbs , uric acid , lipid profile , lft , hba1c , and cbc will be performed before and after treatment .
the subjects will fast for 12 h before blood is drawn for these tests .
hs - crp is an index used to assess the degree of risk for cardiovascular diseases and to determine prognosis [ 18 ] .
after 10 min of relaxation , the hrv will be measured with electrodes attached to both wrists and ankles using qecg - 3 ( lxc3203 , laxtha inc. , korea ) to obtain the lf / hf ratio , tp , vlf , lf , hf , heart rate , sdnn , rmssd , hrv index , and pnn50 .
the neck disability index ( ndi ) consists of ten questions : seven about whether the subject is able to perform functional activities , two about symptoms , and one about concentration [ 19 ] .
the eq - 5d is a questionnaire that is used to assess the quality of life [ 20 ] .
the subjects mark the best answers for five questions on mobility , self - care , pain , usual activities , and psychological status .
the answers are given in the form of numbers ( 1 = no problem , 2 = moderate problem , 3 = severe problem ) , and the sum of the five numbers reflects the subject 's health status .
global assessments of the patients will be used to assess improvement following the treatment , as judged by the subjects [ 21 ] .
the subjects can choose from five answers for questions on the degree of improvement or worsening of the blood pressure : " improved a lot ," " somewhat improved ," " no change ," " somewhat worsened ," and " worsened a lot. " the sri - mf consists of 22 questions that are related to somatization ( 9 items ) , depression ( 9 items ) , and anger ( 3 items ) [ 22 ] .
the subjects will mark the best answer for each of the questions based on their experience in the past week .
the assessment is performed by adding up the scores of each item to obtain a total score .
the psqi was used to assess the quality of sleep and to identify sleep disorders [ 23 ] .
the psqi is an index used to assess the quality of sleep and the presence of any sleep disorders in the past month .
this questionnaire assesses seven items : subjective quality of sleep , latency , sleep duration , habitual sleep efficiency , factors that disturb sleep , use of sleeping aids , and impediments to daytime functioning .
the fss is a questionnaire consisting of nine items that is used to investigate the severity of fatigue during the past week [ 24,25 ] .
a pattern identification questionnaire was developed specifically to determine whether there are differences in the distributions of the change in symptoms among the groups ( table 2 ) .

the follow - up assessment is designed to evaluate the long - term effects of moxibustion .
statistical analysis the results of the intention - to - treat ( itt ) analysis will be used to assess the validity of the study as a whole .
the per - protocol ( pp ) analysis results will be used as a reference .
the itt analysis will be used as the main safety assessment technique .
continuous data will be represented by the average , standard deviation , minimum value , and maximum value , whereas categorical data will be represented by a frequency table .
for the comparison of the results among the groups , the analysis of variance ( anova ) test will be used when the data are normally distributed ; the kruskal - wallis test will be used otherwise .
in addition , the chi - square test will be performed for categorical data .
after 4 weeks , the differences in systolic and diastolic pressure will be summarized for each group using descriptive statistics , including the median , average , standard deviation , and interquartile range .
in addition , we will evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment using an analysis of covariance as the dependent variable , the baseline score as the covariate , the group as the fixed factor , and the hypertension stage as the stratified variable .
in addition , we will compare the results for the stratified groups with the results for the whole subject pool ( non - stratified ) to determine whether hypertension stage is a suitable stratification variable .
the differences in the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure following the treatment for each group will be analyzed using a paired t - test or a wilcoxon signed rank test , and the 95 % confidence interval will be presented .
to assess the difference in the tendency for each visit , repeated measures analysis of variance will be performed .
a significance level of 5 % will be used in all analyses .
the average pulse pressure , change in the baseline blood pressure following the treatment , bmi , eq - 5d , ankle brachial pressure index ( abi index ) , brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity ( pwv index ) , heart rate variation ( lf / hf ratio , tp , vlf , lf , hf , heart rate , sdnn , lf norm , hf norm ) , and blood test results will be analyzed using the same techniques used to analyze the validity of the assessment variable .
to determine whether there are differences in the distribution of the change in symptoms among the groups , analysis will be performed on each item using the chi - squared test .
all adverse reactions manifested will be listed with detailed explanations .
the frequency of abnormal reactions that are correlated with the treatment and abnormal reactions that do not have such correlations will be recorded .
a fisher 's exact test will be performed to determine whether there are any differences among the groups with respect to the incidence of abnormal reactions as reported by the subjects .
furthermore , technical analysis will be performed to identify differences in the degree of severity and in the type of abnormal reactions among the groups .
adverse events the safety evaluation will be based on adverse events , which are expected to include blisters , redness , and burns .
adverse reactions refer to undesirable and unintentional signs ( e.g. , abnormal test results ) , symptoms or diseases following the treatment .
there does not necessarily have to be a cause and effect relationship with the treatment .
the subjects will be instructed to voluntarily report any information regarding abnormal reactions to the practitioner on a regular basis .
any adverse events during treatment will be recorded .
when abnormal reactions appear , the date of appearance , the date of disappearance , the degree of the abnormal reaction , measures taken related to the treatment , correlation with the treatment , names of suspicious drugs taken outside of the treatment , whether the abnormal reactions were treated and any other related information will be recorded in detail .
any medical conditions or diseases present prior to the start of the treatment will be considered abnormal reactions only if they worsen after starting the treatment .
abnormal test values or results will be considered abnormal reactions only if they cause clinical symptoms , if they are considered clinically significant or if treatment is needed .
discussion this study is a preliminary study targeting individuals with pre - or stage i hypertension , who will be randomly divided into treatment group a ( 2 times / week ) , treatment group b ( 3 times / week ) , and the control group ( non - treated group ) .
basic analysis will be performed to assess the validity and safety of moxibustion for the treatment of pre - or stage i hypertension .
the following results will be presented : the extent of stimulation provided by moxibustion , differences in the effect according to the frequency of treatment , and how long the efficacy of the treatment last .
these results will be based on long - term follow - up observation .
trial status this trial is currently recruiting participants .

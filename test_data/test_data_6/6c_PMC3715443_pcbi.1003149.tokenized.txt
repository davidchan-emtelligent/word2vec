literature reviews are in great demand in most scientific fields .
their need stems from the ever - increasing output of scientific publications [ 1 ] .
for example , compared to 1991 , in 2008 three , eight , and forty times more papers were indexed in web of science on malaria , obesity , and biodiversity , respectively [ 2 ] .
given such mountains of papers , scientists cannot be expected to examine in detail every single new paper relevant to their interests [ 3 ] .
thus , it is both advantageous and necessary to rely on regular summaries of the recent literature .
although recognition for scientists mainly comes from primary research , timely literature reviews can lead to new synthetic insights and are often widely read [ 4 ] .
for such summaries to be useful , however , they need to be compiled in a professional way [ 5 ] .
when starting from scratch , reviewing the literature can require a titanic amount of work. that is why researchers who have spent their career working on a certain research issue are in a perfect position to review that literature .
some graduate schools are now offering courses in reviewing the literature , given that most research students start their project by producing an overview of what has already been done on their research issue [ 6 ] .
however , it is likely that most scientists have not thought in detail about how to approach and carry out a literature review .
reviewing the literature requires the ability to juggle multiple tasks , from finding and evaluating relevant material to synthesising information from various sources , from critical thinking to paraphrasing , evaluating , and citation skills [ 7 ] .
in this contribution , i share ten simple rules i learned working on about 25 literature reviews as a phd and postdoctoral student .
ideas and insights also come from discussions with coauthors and colleagues , as well as feedback from reviewers and editors .
rule 1 : define a topic and audience how to choose which topic to review ?
there are so many issues in contemporary science that you could spend a lifetime of attending conferences and reading the literature just pondering what to review .
on the one hand , if you take several years to choose , several other people may have had the same idea in the meantime .
on the other hand , only a well - considered topic is likely to lead to a brilliant literature review [ 8 ] .
the topic must at least be : interesting to you ( ideally , you should have come across a series of recent papers related to your line of work that call for a critical summary ) , an important aspect of the field ( so that many readers will be interested in the review and there will be enough material to write it ) , and a well - defined issue ( otherwise you could potentially include thousands of publications , which would make the review unhelpful ) .
ideas for potential reviews may come from papers providing lists of key research questions to be answered [ 9 ] , but also from serendipitous moments during desultory reading and discussions .
in addition to choosing your topic , you should also select a target audience .
in many cases , the topic ( e.g. , web services in computational biology ) will automatically define an audience ( e.g. , computational biologists ) , but that same topic may also be of interest to neighbouring fields ( e.g. , computer science , biology , etc. ) .
rule 2 : search and re - search the literature after having chosen your topic and audience , start by checking the literature and downloading relevant papers .
five pieces of advice here : keep track of the search items you use ( so that your search can be replicated [ 10 ]) , keep a list of papers whose pdfs you cannot access immediately ( so as to retrieve them later with alternative strategies ) , use a paper management system ( e.g. , mendeley , papers , qiqqa , sente ) , define early in the process some criteria for exclusion of irrelevant papers ( these criteria can then be described in the review to help define its scope ) , and do not just look for research papers in the area you wish to review , but also seek previous reviews .
the chances are high that someone will already have published a literature review ( figure 1 ) , if not exactly on the issue you are planning to tackle , at least on a related topic .
if there are already a few or several reviews of the literature on your issue , my advice is not to give up , but to carry on with your own literature review , 10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1003149.g001 figure 1 a conceptual diagram of the need for different types of literature reviews depending on the amount of published research papers and literature reviews .
the bottom - right situation ( many literature reviews but few research papers ) is not just a theoretical situation ; it applies , for example , to the study of the impacts of climate change on plant diseases , where there appear to be more literature reviews than research studies [ 33 ] .
discussing in your review the approaches , limitations , and conclusions of past reviews , trying to find a new angle that has not been covered adequately in the previous reviews , and incorporating new material that has inevitably accumulated since their appearance .
when searching the literature for pertinent papers and reviews , the usual rules apply : be thorough , use different keywords and database sources ( e.g. , dblp , google scholar , isi proceedings , jstor search , medline , scopus , web of science ) , and look at who has cited past relevant papers and book chapters .
rule 3 : take notes while reading if you read the papers first , and only afterwards start writing the review , you will need a very good memory to remember who wrote what , and what your impressions and associations were while reading each single paper .
my advice is , while reading , to start writing down interesting pieces of information , insights about how to organize the review , and thoughts on what to write .
this way , by the time you have read the literature you selected , you will already have a rough draft of the review. of course , this draft will still need much rewriting , restructuring , and rethinking to obtain a text with a coherent argument [ 11 ] , but you will have avoided the danger posed by staring at a blank document .
be careful when taking notes to use quotation marks if you are provisionally copying verbatim from the literature .
it is advisable then to reformulate such quotes with your own words in the final draft .
it is important to be careful in noting the references already at this stage , so as to avoid misattributions .
using referencing software from the very beginning of your endeavour will save you time .
rule 4 : choose the type of review you wish to write after having taken notes while reading the literature , you will have a rough idea of the amount of material available for the review .
this is probably a good time to decide whether to go for a mini - or a full review .
some journals are now favouring the publication of rather short reviews focusing on the last few years , with a limit on the number of words and citations .
a mini - review is not necessarily a minor review : it may well attract more attention from busy readers , although it will inevitably simplify some issues and leave out some relevant material due to space limitations .
a full review will have the advantage of more freedom to cover in detail the complexities of a particular scientific development , but may then be left in the pile of the very important papers " to be read " by readers with little time to spare for major monographs .
there is probably a continuum between mini - and full reviews .
the same point applies to the dichotomy of descriptive vs. integrative reviews .
while descriptive reviews focus on the methodology , findings , and interpretation of each reviewed study , integrative reviews attempt to find common ideas and concepts from the reviewed material [ 12 ] .
a similar distinction exists between narrative and systematic reviews : while narrative reviews are qualitative , systematic reviews attempt to test a hypothesis based on the published evidence , which is gathered using a predefined protocol to reduce bias [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
when systematic reviews analyse quantitative results in a quantitative way , they become meta - analyses .
the choice between different review types will have to be made on a case - by - case basis , depending not just on the nature of the material found and the preferences of the target journal ( s ) , but also on the time available to write the review and the number of coauthors [ 15 ] .
rule 5 : keep the review focused , but make it of broad interest whether your plan is to write a mini - or a full review , it is good advice to keep it focused 16,17 .
including material just for the sake of it can easily lead to reviews that are trying to do too many things at once .
the need to keep a review focused can be problematic for interdisciplinary reviews , where the aim is to bridge the gap between fields [ 18 ] .
if you are writing a review on , for example , how epidemiological approaches are used in modelling the spread of ideas , you may be inclined to include material from both parent fields , epidemiology and the study of cultural diffusion .
this may be necessary to some extent , but in this case a focused review would only deal in detail with those studies at the interface between epidemiology and the spread of ideas .
while focus is an important feature of a successful review , this requirement has to be balanced with the need to make the review relevant to a broad audience .
this square may be circled by discussing the wider implications of the reviewed topic for other disciplines .
rule 6 : be critical and consistent reviewing the literature is not stamp collecting .
a good review does not just summarize the literature , but discusses it critically , identifies methodological problems , and points out research gaps [ 19 ] .
after having read a review of the literature , a reader should have a rough idea of : the major achievements in the reviewed field , the main areas of debate , and the outstanding research questions .
it is challenging to achieve a successful review on all these fronts .
a solution can be to involve a set of complementary coauthors : some people are excellent at mapping what has been achieved , some others are very good at identifying dark clouds on the horizon , and some have instead a knack at predicting where solutions are going to come from .
if your journal club has exactly this sort of team , then you should definitely write a review of the literature !
in addition to critical thinking , a literature review needs consistency , for example in the choice of passive vs. active voice and present vs. past tense .
rule 7 : find a logical structure like a well - baked cake , a good review has a number of telling features : it is worth the reader 's time , timely , systematic , well written , focused , and critical .
it also needs a good structure. with reviews , the usual subdivision of research papers into introduction , methods , results , and discussion does not work or is rarely used .
however , a general introduction of the context and , toward the end , a recapitulation of the main points covered and take - home messages make sense also in the case of reviews .
for systematic reviews , there is a trend towards including information about how the literature was searched ( database , keywords , time limits ) [ 20 ] .
how can you organize the flow of the main body of the review so that the reader will be drawn into and guided through it ?
it is generally helpful to draw a conceptual scheme of the review , e.g. , with mind - mapping techniques .
such diagrams can help recognize a logical way to order and link the various sections of a review [ 21 ] .
this is the case not just at the writing stage , but also for readers if the diagram is included in the review as a figure .
a careful selection of diagrams and figures relevant to the reviewed topic can be very helpful to structure the text too [ 22 ] .
rule 8 : make use of feedback reviews of the literature are normally peer - reviewed in the same way as research papers , and rightly so [ 23 ] .
as a rule , incorporating feedback from reviewers greatly helps improve a review draft .
having read the review with a fresh mind , reviewers may spot inaccuracies , inconsistencies , and ambiguities that had not been noticed by the writers due to rereading the typescript too many times .
it is however advisable to reread the draft one more time before submission , as a last - minute correction of typos , leaps , and muddled sentences may enable the reviewers to focus on providing advice on the content rather than the form .
feedback is vital to writing a good review , and should be sought from a variety of colleagues , so as to obtain a diversity of views on the draft .
this may lead in some cases to conflicting views on the merits of the paper , and on how to improve it , but such a situation is better than the absence of feedback .
a diversity of feedback perspectives on a literature review can help identify where the consensus view stands in the landscape of the current scientific understanding of an issue [ 24 ] .
rule 9 : include your own relevant research , but be objective in many cases , reviewers of the literature will have published studies relevant to the review they are writing .
this could create a conflict of interest : how can reviewers report objectively on their own work [ 25 ] ?
some scientists may be overly enthusiastic about what they have published , and thus risk giving too much importance to their own findings in the review .
however , bias could also occur in the other direction : some scientists may be unduly dismissive of their own achievements , so that they will tend to downplay their contribution ( if any ) to a field when reviewing it. in general , a review of the literature should neither be a public relations brochure nor an exercise in competitive self - denial .
if a reviewer is up to the job of producing a well - organized and methodical review , which flows well and provides a service to the readership , then it should be possible to be objective in reviewing one 's own relevant findings .
in reviews written by multiple authors , this may be achieved by assigning the review of the results of a coauthor to different coauthors .
rule 10 : be up - to - date , but do not forget older studies given the progressive acceleration in the publication of scientific papers , today 's reviews of the literature need awareness not just of the overall direction and achievements of a field of inquiry , but also of the latest studies , so as not to become out - of - date before they have been published .
ideally , a literature review should not identify as a major research gap an issue that has just been addressed in a series of papers in press ( the same applies , of course , to older , overlooked studies (" sleeping beauties " [ 26 ])) .
this implies that literature reviewers would do well to keep an eye on electronic lists of papers in press , given that it can take months before these appear in scientific databases .
some reviews declare that they have scanned the literature up to a certain point in time , but given that peer review can be a rather lengthy process , a full search for newly appeared literature at the revision stage may be worthwhile .
assessing the contribution of papers that have just appeared is particularly challenging , because there is little perspective with which to gauge their significance and impact on further research and society .
inevitably , new papers on the reviewed topic ( including independently written literature reviews ) will appear from all quarters after the review has been published , so that there may soon be the need for an updated review .
but this is the nature of science [ 27 ] - [ 32 ] .
i wish everybody good luck with writing a review of the literature .

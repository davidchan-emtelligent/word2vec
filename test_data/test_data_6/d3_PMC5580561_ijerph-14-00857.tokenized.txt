indoor airborne culturable bacteria are sometimes harmful to human health .
therefore , a quick estimation of their concentration is particularly necessary .
however , measuring the indoor microorganism concentration ( e.g. , bacteria ) usually requires a large amount of time , economic cost , and manpower .
in this paper , we aim to provide a quick solution : using knowledge - based machine learning to provide quick estimation of the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria only with the inputs of several measurable indoor environmental indicators , including : indoor particulate matter ( pm2.5 and pm10 ) , temperature , relative humidity , and co2 concentration .
our results show that a general regression neural network ( grnn ) model can sufficiently provide a quick and decent estimation based on the model training and testing using an experimental database with 249 data groups .
indoor airborne culturable bacteria pm2.5 and pm10 estimation model machine learning artificial neural network 1 .
introduction many indoor microorganisms are potential threats to human health [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] .
high concentrations of airborne bacteria or fungi may lead to some common diseases , such as respiratory symptoms , allergies , and asthma [ 7,8,9 ] .
studies have shown that outdoor particulate matter ( pm ) air pollution could cause formidable public health risk due to inhalable microorganisms that exist in pm2.5 and pm10 pollutants [ 10 ] .
our recent studies further found that relatively high concentrations of indoor pm2.5 and pm10 pollutants are qualitatively related to high concentrations of indoor inhalable bacteria and fungi [ 8,11 ] , which seriously jeopardizes human health .
to reduce the potential threats of indoor inhalable microorganisms , a common method is the use of germicides [ 12 ] or antifungal agents [ 13 ] .
however , before deciding whether to use these products , people usually struggle with a simpler question : what are the approximate concentrations of bacteria and fungi in my house ?
experimentally , the measurements of bacterial or fungal concentrations are complicated , including sampling and culture , which require high economic cost and a long timescale .
to estimate the indoor fungal concentration , we previously found a linear relationship between pm and indoor fungal concentration [ 8 ] , which is applicable for indoor fungi estimation .
however , to our best knowledge , very few reports have shown an effective estimation method for the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria .
to estimate the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria , a good first step is to make full use of the indoor environmental indicators. with the assumption that some important indoor indicators ( e.g. , pm , temperature , relative humidity and co2 concentration ) correlate ( or partially correlate ) with the growth of bacteria , they can be used as the independent variables for the prediction of bacterial concentration .
setting the bacterial concentration as the dependent variable , we can further use predictive machine learning methods trained from the experimental database .
a good machine learning model can effectively " learn " from the existing database and perform precise and robust predictions. with the algorithm developments made during the past few decades , there are currently a large number of machine learning methods that can be performed for numerical regression , such as artificial neural network ( ann ) [ 14 ] and support vector machine ( svm ) [ 15 ] .
artificial neural network ( ann ) is a proven powerful machine learning tool for numerical prediction [ 16,17 ] , classification [ 18 ] , and pattern recognition [ 19 ] .
during recent years , it has been widely used in chemical [ 20,21 ] , biological [ 22 ] , medical [ 23 ] , environmental [ 24 ] , and engineering [ 17,25,26 ] applications .
in this communication , we aim to propose a quick estimation method of the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria using ann models .
our results show that with the simple inputs of indoor pm2.5 and pm10 , temperature , relative humidity , and co2 concentration , the model trained from our experimental database with 249 data groups can effectively predict the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria with relatively low root mean square errors ( rms errors ) .
2. modeling methods the structure of a typical ann consists of three different types of layers , including the input , hidden , and output layers .
each layer consists of a certain number of neurons .
each neuron in the input layer represents an independent variable , while the neurons in the output layer are the dependent variables .
each neuron interconnects with all the neurons in the adjacent layer ( s ) .
the training of an ann is essentially the searching of optimal weights between all the pairs of neurons .
currently , there are a large number of ann algorithms , such as back - propagation neural network ( bpnn ) [ 27,28,29 ] , general regression neural network ( grnn ) [ 17,22 ] , and extreme learning machine ( elm ) [ 30,31,32 ] .
though they have different weight calculation strategies , the basic principles and structures are similar .
the introduction of a general schematic ann structure can be seen in reference [ 33 ] .
in this study , we mainly used a grnn as the ann model for training .
compared to conventional ann methods , grnn is a state - of - the - art algorithm that has the advantages of fast training and fixed structure [ 17 ] .
people do not need to compare varying numbers of neurons in the hidden layer during the training and testing , which saves time and computational cost .
details of the principle of a typical grnn can be found in the work conducted by specht [ 34 ] .
to develop a model for estimating the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria , we chose a series of independent variables that can be easily measured inside a building , including : ( i ) indoor pm2.5 , ( ii ) indoor pm10 , ( iii ) temperature , ( iv ) relative humidity , and ( v ) co2 concentration .
all the data were measured in various buildings in baoding , one of the cities that recently suffered from the most serious pm2.5 pollutions in china .
descriptive statistics of the 249 measured data groups are shown in table 1 , which shows that the data ranges of all our measured variables are wide enough for a machine learning model training .
details on the measurements have been mentioned in our previous articles [ 8,11,35 ]. with the assumption that all these factors are correlated ( or partially correlated ) to the concentration of indoor airborne bacteria , these independent variables were considered as the inputs of the grnn for model training .
the measured bacterial concentration was then assigned as the output of the grnn .
statistical analysis of the potential relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable are shown in section 3.1 .
for each training and testing process , the dataset was divided into two different subsets , the training and testing sets .
training sets were used for the data training , from which the grnn model can " learn " via a " black - box " fitting process ; testing sets were used for the testing of the precision of the trained grnn models .
in our study , we used different percentages of training and testing sets for model developments and compared the precision and robustness of each model .
the training and testing of each percentage were repeated 200 times .
rms errors were calculated from the testing results for comparison .
details on the training and testing results are shown in section 3.2 .
for comparison , we also performed training and testing processes on a multilayer feedforward neural network ( mlfn ) [ 36 ] with varying numbers of hidden nodes ( 2 - 15 ) in a single hidden layer .
the number of trials for each mlfn training was set as 100,000 .
all the modeling works were performed on a laptop ( thinkpad series , lenovo , morrisville , nc , usa ) .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
statistical analysis figure 1 shows the potential relationships between the measured bacterial concentration and the measured independent variables .
it can be seen that the indoor pm2.5 and pm10 , temperature , and relative humidity correlate moderately with the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria .
however , in terms of co2 concentration , the correlation is insignificant .
interestingly , the concentrations of indoor pm2.5 and pm10 have less correlation with the bacterial concentration than with the indoor fungal concentration reported in a previous study [ 8 ] , which indicates that the bacterial concentration is less dependent than the fungal concentration on these environmental indicators .
this can also probably explain why there are always some data points that significantly deviate from the regression lines in figure 1 .
also , the correlation between relative humidity and the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria is consistent with the previous studies [ 37 ] .
all these results show that we cannot use a simple linear regression model with a single independent variable to predict the bacterial concentration , because the growth of bacterium usually depends on more than one environmental factor .
therefore , to more precisely predict the bacterial concentration , a non - linear fitting technique is necessary .
3.2 .
machine learning - based prediction during the development of the grnn , the training sets of 95 % , 85 % , 75 % , 65 % , and 55 % , were respectively used .
the average rms errors ( acquired from 200 repeated training and testing processes ) are shown in figure 2 .
it can be clearly seen that with a higher percentage of training set , the average rms error in the testing process becomes lower .
this is consistent with the principle of a non - linear fitting process : training with a larger dataset will lead to a lower risk of over - fitting .
due to the high economic cost for the bacterial concentration measurement in our study , we so far could only acquire 249 data groups .
though this database is large enough for a promising model training , for practical applications , it is always recommended that using a larger experimental database can lead to better predictive performance .
meanwhile , the performance of the grnn was also compared with the multiple linear regression and mlfn models with varying numbers of hidden nodes ( table 2 ) .
the rms errors ( calculated from the testing set ) shown in table 2 were extracted from 15 repeated model training processes .
it can be seen that the average rms error of the grnn is significantly lower than those of other models we developed .
though its minimum rms error is higher than some other models , the range between the maximum and minimum rms error of the grnn is the smallest among all the models we developed .
these results show that the grnn not only has generally low average rms error , but also has very good stability .
for this reason , we conclude that with the training using our experimental database ( table 1 ) , the grnn outperforms the mlfn and multiple linear regression models .
to show the training and testing results of the grnn more clearly , we picked three typical modeling results for discussions , as shown in figure 3 ( a and b : training and testing sets of 95 % and 5 % , respectively ; c and d : training and testing sets of 85 % and 15 % , respectively ; e and f : training and testing sets of 75 % and 25 % , respectively ) .
it can be seen that with relatively high percentages of training set ( e.g. , 95 % in figure 3a and 85 % in figure 3c ) , the training results look quite decent ( except for several points that deviate from the diagonals ) , leading to good testing results , as shown in figure 3b,d , respectively .
a plausible explanation for the discrete points is that the data groups with relatively high bacterial concentration are not enough to ensure a good fitting in a high concentration area. with our experimental conditions , it was found that the average bacterial concentration was around 877.3 colony forming units per m3 ( cfu / m3 ) ( table 1 ) , which was much lower than the maximum we have observed ( 3522 cfu / m3 , table 1 ) .
we expect that , with a larger database in practical applications , this problem can be addressed properly .
in terms of the training set with a relatively low percentage ( e.g. , a training set of 75 % , as shown in figure 3e ) , the training fails to precisely fit the data groups with a relatively large bacterial concentration , leading to weak prediction performance in the testing set ( figure 3f ) .
we also found that using the percentages of the training set lower than 75 % resulted in even worse predictive performance in their corresponding testing sets .
these results , together with figure 2 , show that with a relatively large training set , the developed grnn method is a promising ann model for predicting the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria with a few inputs of measurable indoor environmental indicators .
a good potential application of such a model is the real - time measurement of the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria .
because all the independent variables used in this model can be acquired in a short period , the real - time bacterial concentration can also be evaluated once the values of the independent variables are inputted into the grnn model .
the flow chart of the proposed measurement method is shown in figure 4 .
we expect that this quick evaluation method can dramatically shorten the measurement of bacterial concentration from days to seconds .
in future study , we will continue to develop a user - friendly software that can be applicable for real measurements .
4. conclusions in this communication , we have shown that a machine learning - based method can perform fast estimation of the concentration of indoor airborne culturable bacteria .
we found that with the inputs of some indoor environmental indicators that can be easily measured ( indoor pm2.5 and pm10 , indoor temperature , relative humidity , and co2 concentration ) , a well - trained grnn model can help to quickly acquire the estimated concentration .
this novel estimation can dramatically reduce the measurement time from days to seconds , saving much time , economic cost , and manpower .
we expect that this estimation method can also be applied to the quick measurement of indoor fungal and virus concentrations .

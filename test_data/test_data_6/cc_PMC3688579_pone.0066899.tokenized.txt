background many markers have been indicated as predictors of type 2 diabetes .
however , the question of whether or not non - glycaemic ( blood ) biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers have a predictive additive utility when combined with glycaemic ( blood ) biomarkers is unknown .
the study aim is to assess this additive utility in a large japanese population .
methods we used data from a retrospective cohort study conducted from 1998 to 2002 for the baseline and 2002 to 2006 for follow - up , inclusive of 5,142 men ( mean age of 51.9 years ) and 4,847 women ( 54.1 years ) at baseline .
the cumulative incidence of diabetes [ defined either as a fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) >= 7.00 mmol / l or as clinically diagnosed diabetes ] was measured .
in addition to glycaemic biomarkers [ fpg and hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c )] , we examined the clinical usefulness of adding non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers , using sensitivity and specificity , and the area under the curve ( auc ) of the receiver operating characteristics .
results the aucs to predict diabetes were 0.874 and 0.924 for fpg , 0.793 and 0.822 for hba1c , in men and women , respectively .
glycaemic biomarkers were the best and second - best for diabetes prediction among the markers .
all non - glycaemic markers ( except uric acid in men and creatinine in both sexes ) predicted diabetes .
among these biomarkers , the highest auc in the single - marker analysis was 0.656 for alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) in men and 0.740 for body mass index in women .
the auc of the combined markers of fpg and hba1c was 0.895 in men and 0.938 in women , which were marginally increased to 0.904 and 0.940 when adding alt , respectively .
conclusions auc increments were marginal when adding non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers to the classic model based on fpg and hba1c .
for the prediction of diabetes , fpg and hba1c are sufficient and the other markers may not be needed in clinical practice .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction for the primary prevention and early intervention of type 2 diabetes , an identification of persons at high risk for developing future diabetes is important .
for this purpose , many markers have been identified independently as a predictor or a risk factor and include the classic markers such as blood glucose profiles for the progression to type 2 diabetes .
glycaemic biomarker levels such as plasma glucose at fasting ( fpg ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and postload [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , late insulin response at postload [ 4 ] and hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] have been adopted as known biomarkers for predicting type 2 diabetes .
in addition , many other markers ( non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - biomarkers ) have been proposed as an independent predictor or risk factor for the progression to diabetes in epidemiological studies .
first , non - glycaemic biomarkers including in the serum high levels of triglycerides [ 8 ] , liver enzymes [ 9 ] - [ 15 ] , white blood cell count [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , and c - reactive protein [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] , uric acid [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol [ 25 ] and creatinine [ 26 ] have been reported to predict the risk of development of type 2 diabetes .
these epidemiologic studies have shown positive associations between elevated or decreased levels of these risk factors and incident diabetes , independent of classic risk factors such as age , obesity , and fasting and postload plasma glucose levels .
second , non - blood biomarkers or non - biomarkers such as body mass index ( bmi ) , waist - to - hip and waist - to - height ratio , and waist circumference [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , physical inactivity [ 8 ] , [ 29 ] , high blood pressure [ 8 ] , smoking [ 30 ] and age [ 31 ] have also been reported to be a predictor or a risk factor for diabetes .
these findings of non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers may reveal the pathogenesis linking these markers with diabetes .
however , the question of the clinical utility of these markers as a predictor remains to be solved .
the strength of associations expressed in epidemiological terms does not necessarily indicate the clinical usefulness of these markers .
what matters most is whether these markers improve the precision of prediction made by glycaemic markers .
in other words , biomarker research should be discussed in terms of whether the promise of biomarker research will improve the care of diabetes patients in actual practice [ 32 ] .
accordingly , using a large retrospective cohort data set of the japanese population , we examined whether non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers improve the predictive power of glycaemic markers to identify future patients of type 2 diabetes using sensitivity and specificity analysis and receiver - operator - characteristic ( roc ) curves .
materials and methods study subjects we used a data set from the health - screening program provided at yuport medical checkup center in tokyo during april 1998 and march 2006 .
the details of this center 's study have been described elsewhere [ 6 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
during this period , 34,303 persons voluntarily underwent a total of 97,365 checkups .
in this study , we set a 4 - year baseline period as between april 1998 and march 2002 , and the 4 - year follow - up period as between april 2002 and march 2006 .
at the baseline period , 21,885 persons underwent checkups at least once in the total of 47,795 checkups ( figure 1 ) .
for repeat participants at the four - year baseline period , the first checkup data was used as the baseline data .
during the follow - up period , 23,547 persons underwent a checkup at least once in the total of 49,390 checkups .
total follow - up data was gathered for each person to evaluate incident diabetes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066899.g001 figure 1 enrollment of the study subjects .
fpg , fasting plasma glucose ; hba1c , hemoglobin a1c .
next , follow - up data were merged with baseline data , yielding 11,129 persons who had been examined during both time periods .
among them , 129 persons with known diabetes at baseline were excluded and this left a remainder of 11,000 persons .
next , 411 who had a baseline fpg >= 7.00 mmol / l , and in sequence , 168 who had a baseline hba1c >= 6.5 % ( national glycohemoglobin standardization program unit ) were excluded .
among the remaining 10,421 persons , 432 persons with less than 2 years of follow - up duration between baseline and follow - up checkup were excluded , and finally , 9,989 persons ( 5,142 men and 4,847 women ) were enrolled in this study .
all the evaluation procedures were performed in the same manner during the study period , including blood and non - blood measurements .
a blood sample was obtained after overnight fasting and measured at the center 's laboratory .
in accordance with the private information protection law , information that might identify subjects was safeguarded by the center .
this study was approved by the review board of the yuport medical checkup center and a written informed consent for anonymous participation in epidemiological research was obtained at every evaluation .
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in all follow - up analyses , type 2 diabetes was defined by a glycaemic biomarker as an fpg level >= 7.00 mmol / l , in accordance with the american diabetes association and the japan diabetes society criteria [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , or as a diagnosis of diabetes by a physician sometime between the baseline and follow - up examination .
three types of markers for diabetes prediction among all the study subjects , we first divided the markers for progression of diabetes prediction into two groups : blood biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers .
age , bmi , and blood pressure are non - blood biomarkers , and the others are blood biomarkers .
the blood biomarkers were then reclassified into two subgroups : glycaemic ( blood ) biomarkers , non - glycaemic ( blood ) biomarkers .
the classifications of each marker are shown in table 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066899.t001 table 1 classification of the examined markers to predict diabetes in this study .
glycaemic ( blood ) biomarker non - glycaemic ( blood ) biomarker non - blood biomarker fasting plasma glucosea [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] triglycerides [ 8 ] sexb hemoglobin a1ca [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] low - density lipoprotein cholesterol [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] age [ 31 ] high - density lipoprotein cholesterol [ 25 ] body mass index [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] asparate aminotransferase [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] systolic blood pressure [ 8 ] alanine aminotransferase [ 9 ] - [ 15 ] diastolic blood pressure [ 8 ] gamma - glutamyltranspeptidase [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] - [ 15 ] white blood cell count [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] uric acid [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] creatinine [ 26 ] a the combination of fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin a1c were used in the base predictive model for diabetes .
b for the obvious sex difference in the prevalence of diabetes , men and women were separately analyzed .
each number in a square bracket represents the correspondence to the reference number .
glycaemic biomarkers for the measurements of fpg and hba1c levels as glycaemic biomarkers , a toshiba tba - 40fr autoanalyzer ( toshiba medical systems , tokyo , japan ) was used .
plasma glucose level was measured via the hexokinase - g6pd method ( denka seiken , niigata , japan ) with an inter - assay coefficient of covariation of 3.0 % or less .
hba1c level was measured by the latex immuno - agglutinin method ( determiner hba1c , kyowa medex , tokyo , japan ) , with an inter - assay coefficient of covariation of 1.7 - 2.1 % , which was comparable to that of plasma glucose and aligned to the japan diabetes society assigned values .
the japan diabetes society value of hba1c was converted into national glycohemoglobin standardization program units in this study by adding 0.4 % [ 36 ] .
non - glycaemic biomarkers non - glycaemic biomarkers including serum levels of lipids and hepatic enzymes , and white blood cell count , uric acid and creatinine level were used to compare with the glycaemic biomarkers ( fpg and hba1c ) for the prediction of diabetes .
triglycerides , and total cholesterol and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured using enzymatic methods ( reagents supplied by daiichi pure chemicals , tokyo , japan ) .
low - density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated by friedewald 's equation [ 37 ] .
aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) and alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) were measured using enzymatic methods ( reagents supplied by denka seiken , niigata , japan ) , as were gamma - glutamyltranspeptidase ( ggt ) levels ( wako junyaku , osaka , japan ) .
white blood cell count was measured using the differential count detection method ( reagents supplied by sysmex , kobe , japan ) .
uric acid and creatinine level were measured using enzymatic methods ( reagents supplied by mitsubishi kagaku iatron , tokyo , japan ) .
all of these markers have been reported to be independent risk factors for diabetes , as previously mentioned [ 8 ] - [ 26 ] .
non - blood biomarkers the following four non - blood biomarkers were examined for their ability to predict diabetes ; age , bmi , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure .
bmi was defined as weight divided by height squared ( kg / m2 ) .
blood pressure was measured by trained nurses using a sphygmomanometer .
statistical analysis the power of each marker to predict a progression to diabetes was evaluated with a roc curve .
the area under the curve ( auc ) of the roc and a 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) were calculated by the delong method to evaluate the simple and combined diagnostic utilities of the marker for diabetes prediction [ 38 ] .
the optimal cut - off point of each marker was determined by calculating the youden index that maximizes a combination of sensitivity and specificity [ 39 ] .
then , its sensitivity , specificity , and positive likelihood ratio for the progression to diabetes were calculated using the cut - off .
the likelihood ratio describes how the probability of disease shifts when the finding is present .
the higher likelihood ratio means a better test for diagnosis , e.g. , a likelihood ratio of " 2 " means that someone 's positive result would be about 2 times as likely to be seen in someone with a disease than in someone without a disease .
in this evaluation , we created following four models : ( 1 ) a single marker model , ( 2 ) a base model ( fpg + hba1c ) , ( 3 ) an additional model ( fpg + hba1c + non - glycaemic biomarker or non - blood biomarker ) , and ( 4 ) a full model .
in the first model ( single marker model ) , we evaluated the predictive ability of the each single marker separately .
in the second model ( base model ) , because glycaemic biomarkers ( fpg and hba1c ) have been adopted as a component of the criteria for diagnosing diabetes in the guidelines of the american diabetes association and the japan diabetes society , a logistic regression equation with those biomarkers as explanatory variables for predicting diabetes was created .
the combination of fpg and hba1c was also reported as a better biomarker for the progression of diabetes than the single fpg biomarker in line the yuport study [ 6 ] .
in the third model ( additional model ) , we then added each non - glycaemic biomarker or non - blood biomarker to the base model , and evaluated the predictive ability .
in the last model ( full model ) , we entered all the markers ( including fpg and hba1c ) into the base model .
the correlations between ast and alt , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were high ( at 0.82 and 0.90 among men , and 0.82 and 0.89 among women , respectively ) which indicates multi - collinearity .
thus , we excluded ast and diastolic blood pressure from the full - model analysis , since the predictive ability of alt and systolic blood pressure for diabetes was superior to that of ast and diastolic blood pressure at our prior examination , respectively .
for each curve , a test for the equality of the auc of roc between the base model and the additional model was evaluated using an algorithm suggested by delong and clarke - pearson [ 38 ] .
in addition , we calculated a percentage of incremental auc above 0.5 over the base model ( fpg + hba1c ) as 0.5 is an auc value of the roc for a diagnostic test which is not better than ' flipping a coin ' ( chance alone ) .
we conducted separate analysis for men and women because of the gender - difference in anthropometric characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes .
all test characteristics and the auc of roc was calculated using stata software ( version 12 , college station , tx , usa ) .
since multiple measures to predict the progression to diabetes are being tested , a statistical p value of 0.01 was used to determine statistical significance to reduce the possibility of statistical type i error .
results over the entire 28,757 person - years of follow - up for men and 26,686 person - years for women , 257 men ( 5.0 %) and 88 women ( 1.8 %) were newly diagnosed as having diabetes .
a mean follow - up period was 5.6 ( standard deviation : 1.4 ) years in men with mean age of 51.9 years at baseline and 5.5 ( standard deviation : 1.5 ) in women with mean age of 54.1 years .
the baseline characteristics of the men and women study subjects are shown in table 2 .
among them , 226 of men and 75 of women were discovered to have a fpg level >= 7.00 mmol / l and , 9 and 4 were diagnosed as new - onset diabetes by a physician , and 22 and 9 had both , respectively .

table 3 shows the predictive ability of the marker in the single marker model among men and women .
the aucs to predict the progression of diabetes among glycaemic biomarkers were 0.874 ( 95 % ci : 0.852 - 0.896 ) and 0.924 ( 95 % ci : 0.896 - 0.952 ) for fpg , 0.793 ( 95 % ci : 0.767 - 0.818 ) and 0.822 ( 95 % ci : 0.777 - 0.867 ) for hba1c , in men and women , respectively .
clearly , glycaemic biomarkers were the best and second - best markers for diabetes prediction , running ahead of the other markers .
among the non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers , the highest auc among men was observed at alt as 0.656 ( 95 % ci : 0.621 - 0.691 ) , and among women it was at bmi as 0.740 ( 95 % ci : 0.694 - 0.785 ) .
the lowest auc in both of men and women was creatinine as 0.506 ( 95 % ci : 0.470 - 0.541 ) and 0.553 ( 95 % ci : 0.496 - 0.610 ) .
in contrast , all the auc of non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers , except for uric acid in men and creatinine in both sexes , were significantly larger than 0.5 ( i.e. , the 95 % ci did not include 0.5 ) , and these markers therefore predicted the progression to diabetes .

the incremental auc above 0.5 over the base model was slightly , but significantly increased by 2.3 % from the auc of the base model in the additional model of alt ( p = 0.02 ) , which was the best marker for diabetes prediction in the single model with men excluding the model of glycaemic biomarkers , and 0.2 % in the model with bmi ( not significant ) , which was the best such marker in women .
the highest aucs among the additional models with non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers were , however , observed in the model with alt in both sexes .
although the differences between the base model and the additional models with hdl - cholesterol and ggt in men were statistically significant , the differences were marginal ( incremental aucs above 0.5 over the base model were 0.4 % and - 4.0 % , respectively ) .
none of the incremental aucs above 0.5 over the base model showed significant differences in women .
comparing the all - additional models with the base model , the increment in the roc curves were marginal in both sexes , irrespective of the non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers enrolled into each model .
regarding the results of the full model , the increments of aucs above 0.5 from the base model were also marginal ( 3.3 % among men and 0.8 % among women , respectively ) .
in this full model , only the three coefficients of fpg , hba1c and alt were observed to be significant in predicting diabetes among both sexes .

discussion none of the non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers showed a substantial improvement in predictive ability for the progression to type 2 diabetes when it was added to the conventional prediction model based on fpg and hba1c .
as indicated in many studies [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] - [ 28 ] , all of the non - glycaemic biomarkers [ serum lipids , liver enzymes , white - blood cell count , and uric acid ( only in women )] and non - blood biomarkers ( age , blood pressure , and body mass index ) examined in this study in some way predicted the progression to diabetes .
although these markers may play some role in the pathogenesis of diabetes , these markers do not appear to add a practical precision to the diagnostic power of plasma glucose and hba1c levels .
the classic glycaemic biomarkers seem to be sufficient as a diagnostic marker in clinical practice .
in this study , additive values of non - glycaemic markers were also evaluated .
many previous studies have evaluated the association between the non - glycaemic markers and future diabetes [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] - [ 28 ] .
these findings are obviously important in considering the pathogenesis of diabetes .
however , whether these markers should be added in practice to classical glycaemic biomarkers in predicting diabetes is , of course , another issue .
in our study , for example , alt independently and substantially predicted a patient 's progression to diabetes , as shown in previous studies [ 9 ] - [ 15 ] .
however , the diagnostic power was not substantially improved when alt was added to fpg and hba1c ( only a 2.3 % auc increment above 0.5 over the base model for men and 0.63 % for women ) .
sattar et al. , have proposed that new biomarker research should focus more on the usefulness of the biomarkers in real clinical practice [ 32 ] .
our study is in line with this argument .
in the simple roc analysis in the single predictor model , the best markers other than glycaemic ones for predicting diabetes were those related with adiposity .
the best marker was alt in men and bmi in women .
alt potentially reflects fatty change in the liver , which is one component of visceral / central adiposity .
visceral / central adiposity is also considered as a risk for diabetes [ 40 ] , and is more prevalent in men than in women [ 41 ] .
on the other hand , bmi is an indicator for overall body obesity and might be a better marker for diabetes prediction in women who tend to have subcutaneous ( pear - shaped ) obesity rather than visceral / central adiposity .
it can be noted that non - glycaemic markers have a role in understanding the underlying pathogenesis of diabetes and also in clinical practice even though these markers have little additive value on glycaemic markers for the prediction of diabetes .
although both of the markers did not add substantial value to conventional diagnostic markers , health professionals may be able to refer to these markers in diagnosing or managing diabetes .
for example , clinicians may advise high - risk individuals with elevated liver enzymes ( such as alt ) or obesity ( expressed as a high bmi ) to modify lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise and body weight loss .
it is to be noted that the fpg was used both for the prediction and diagnosis of diabetes .
in addition , hba1c is closely related to plasma glucose levels .
because fpg gradually rises from normal to diabetic levels to qualify for the diagnosis of diabetes , individuals already at high fpg levels within the normal range obviously tend to have the highest likelihood of showing a further increase in fpg .
furthermore , these individuals will have the highest likelihood that an increase of a certain magnitude in their fpg eventually will lead to a certain higher level of fpg to match the diagnosis of diabetes compared with individuals having lower values of fpg .
thus , the two glycemic markers ( fpg and hba1c ) used in the base model may be referred as self - fulfilling predictors for diabetes .
accordingly , the high odds of glycemic markers ( fpg and hba1c ) as predictors for diabetes may be inherent , and it may be expected that the addition of non - glycemic markers will show little or no incremental prediction for diabetes .
the advantage of glycemic markers over non - glycemic markers due to a self - fulfilling predictors is a characteristic of this study design .
several limitations should be mentioned about this study .
first , since the study subjects participated on a voluntary basis , they may be healthier than the general population , causing a selection bias .
this may have underestimated the incidence of diabetes .
however , the 10 - year cumulative incidence detected is similar to the estimate derived from a population - based study of middle - aged japanese [ 42 ] .
second , there might be subjects who rapidly progressed to diabetes between the first and second checkups , who therefore were not eligible to participate in this health checkup program thereafter .
this would tend to cause an underestimation of the prevalence of diabetes at the second visit .
third , our definition of diabetes favors prediction using fpg over non - fpg and hba1c , which was indicated in the roc analysis , i.e. , a lesser auc of hba1c than of fpg ( table 3 and figure 2 ) .
if the definition using hba1c was added in the definition of the outcome , more persons would be diagnosed as having diabetes .
however , the main research topic is a comparison of the clinical utility of the additional and full models with the base model ( fpg + hba1c ) .
thus , the conclusion does not appear to be affected substantially by the definition of diabetes .
fourth , similar to the third limitation , at follow - up evaluations , we used a single fpg level for the diagnosis of diabetes .
thus , it is possible that some of the diabetes cases defined in this study had levels higher than the cut off due to chance or the inter - variation of assays .
however , it is considered acceptable to be based upon a single fasting glucose measurement for epidemiological estimates of diabetes prevalence and incidence [ 43 ] [ 44 ] .
in addition , data from an oral glucose tolerance test was not obtained in this study , which may cause an underestimation of the true incidence of diabetes .
fifth , not all relevant biomarkers were analyzed , such as vitamin d , adiponectin and other inflammatory markers ( eg. , high - sensitivity c - reactive protein , interleukins and tumor necrosis factors ) other than white blood cell count .
for example , higher vitamin d status was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes [ 45 ] .
however , serum assays of these specialized markers are costly and not common in clinical practice .
furthermore , addition of these inflammatory biomarkers to classic glycaemic biomarkers were in doubt for clinical practice as a resource to predict diabetes [ 46 ] .
therefore , the absence of assays of these markers may be justified .
in summary , non - glycaemic biomarkers and non - blood biomarkers gave little or marginal improvement to diagnostic precision when added to the classic predictive model for diabetes using fpg and hba1c .
for the prediction of diabetes , fpg and hba1c are sufficient , at least , as long as the current diagnostic criteria are used .

background colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide .
numerous studies have identified the roles of survivin - 31 g / c and angiotensin - converting enzyme insertion / deletion ( ace i / d ) polymorphisms in crc risk ; however , the results remain inconclusive .
this study was to investigate associations between these two polymorphisms and crc susceptibility .
methods a comprehensive literature search was conducted to collect relevant case - control studies published between 2000 and 2014 .
the extracted data were statistically analyzed , and the odds ratios ( ors ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were employed to estimate the strength of association .
results a total of 11 studies were included in the meta - analysis .
for survivin g / c polymorphism , six articles reported 1,840 cases and 1,804 controls .
overall , we found the frequency of c allele is higher in crc cases than that in the healthy controls ( 57.2 % vs. 48.0 %) , and c allele significantly increased the risk of crc compared to g allele in allele model ( or = 1.46 , 95 % ci = 1.33 - 1.60 , p < 0.00001 ) .
this association was also found in other genetic models ( p < 0.00001 ) .
stratified analysis by ethnicity showed significant association in each genetic model among the asian population .
for ace i / d polymorphism , five studies included 758 cases and 6,755 controls .
no significant association was found in any genetic models .
conclusions our results showed that survivin - 31 g / c polymorphism might contribute to risk of crc , especially in the asian populations .
however , the ace i / d polymorphism is not a genetic factor concerning the risk for crc .
more studies with larger sample sizes are required in the future .
keywords colorectal cancer survivin angiotensin - converting enzyme polymorphism meta - analysis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background colorectal cancer ( crc ) is one of the three most common cancers in the world and is a major contributor to cancer - related death [ 1 ] .
each year , a global incidence exceeding 1.2 million new cases emerge and 600,000 deaths occur [ 2 ] .
its incidence rates continue to increase in economically transitioning countries .
according to colorectal cancer statistics , an estimated 71,830 men and 65,000 women will be diagnosed with crc , and 26,270 men and 24,040 women will die of this disease in 2014 [ 3 ] .
the etiological factors and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying crc development appear to be complex and heterogeneous .
in the last two decades , studies have demonstrated that crc cells undergo major epigenetic alterations [ 4 ] .
among which , genetic variants in oncogenes have been extensively investigated as the essential role in cancer etiology [ 5 ] .
the survivin gene , located in chromosome 17q25 , is the smallest member of the inhibitor of apoptosis ( iap ) gene family [ 6 ] .
it is a multifunctional protein and is required to preserve tissue or organism viability [ 7 ] .
survivin is expressed in many human cancers and involved in the regulation of cell division and survival [ 8 ] .
the survivin - 31 g / c polymorphism may modulate susceptibility to cancer by influencing the expression of survivin .
a recent study has supported a role of survivin in colorectal carcinogenesis , while the - 31 g / c polymorphism may constitute a marker of survival [ 9 ] .
the angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) , a major component of the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) , plays a crucial role in the regulation of circulatory homeostasis such as blood pressure and serum electrolytes [ 10 ] .
it is located on human chromosome 17q23 and has been involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers [ 11,12 ] .
epidemiologic studies have indicated that inhibition of ace activity could suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis , decreasing the risk and mortality rate [ 13 ] .
recent research showed that long - term / high - dose exposure to ace inhibitor may decrease the incidence of crc [ 14 ] .
ace variants might affect its activity .
among which , ace i / d ( rs4646994 ) polymorphism in intron 16 of this gene , based on insertion ( i ) or deletion ( d ) of a 287 - bp alu sequence , was the most widely studied and leaded to a change in the plasma ace level .
the carriers of d allele were shown in higher ace activity .
numerous studies have shown the association of these genetic polymorphisms with crc [ 9,15 - 25 ] .
however , the results remained inconsistent .
in the present study , we performed meta - analyses to evaluate and summarize the contribution of the two polymorphisms to crc susceptibility in different populations .
methods literature search a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the online electronic database of embase , medline , pubmed , cnki ( china national knowledge infrastructure ) , and wanfang .
we retrieved the relevant articles published between january 2000 and march 2014 using the following terms : " colorectal cancer or colorectal carcinoma " , " angiotensin - converting enzyme or ace " , " survivin " , and " polymorphism or variant or mutation " as well as their combinations .
the references of retrieved articles were searched manually .
when the same authors or laboratory reported the issue on the same group of people , only full - text articles of the most recent studies were included .
study selection the inclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) case - control or cohort studies , 2 ) evaluating the contribution of survivin - 31 g / c and ace i / d polymorphisms with crc risk , 3 ) the results presented in odds ratio ( or ) with its 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , and 4 ) genotype distributions in the cases and controls were available to extract .
data extraction two investigators independently assessed the data from the included studies .
any disagreement was discussed with a third expert to reach a final consensus .
the following information was extracted : the name of first author , publication year , country , ethnicity , sample size , genotyping method , and the genotype frequencies in the cancer cases and controls .
statistical analysis the overall effect was measured by ors with its 95 % ci. the z test was employed to determine the significance of the pooled ors , and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
the per - allele model ( c vs. g for survivin , d vs. i for ace ) , dominant model ( gc + cc vs. gg for survivin , id + dd vs. ii for ace ) , recessive model ( cc vs. gc + gg survivin , dd vs. id + ii for ace ) , and additive model ( cc vs. gg for survivin , dd vs. ii for ace ) were examined to assess these association .
the i2 test and the q statistic test were used to assess the between - study heterogeneity .
the mantel - haenszel ( m - h ) fixed - effects model is used when the p value is more than 0.10 for the q test and less than 50 % for i2 ; otherwise , the random - effects model is used .
the publication bias was assessed by visual funnel plot inspection .
review manager ( version 5.2 , the cochrane collaboration ) was used to conduct the statistical analyses .
all the tests were two sided .
results study selection and characteristics the initial search identified 284 references. of those , 107 records were excluded for duplication and 177 articles were judged potentially relevant .
following the title and abstract screening , 40 full - text articles met inclusion criteria .
overall , a total of 11 studies ( eight in english and three in chinese ) were finally included in this review .
figure 1 showed the study flow .

the between - study heterogeneity was not significant and the fixed - effect model was employed .
overall , the frequency of c allele was higher in crc cases than that in the healthy controls ( 57.2 % vs. 48.0 %) .
as shown in figure 2 , we found that c allele significantly increased the risk of crc compared to g allele in the allele model ( or = 1.46 , 95 % ci = 1.33 - 1.60 , p < 0.00001 ) .
this significant association was also found in other genetic models ( cc vs. gg : or = 1.95 , 95 % ci = 1.62 - 2.35 , p < 0.00001 ; cc + gc vs. gg : or = 1.51 , 95 % ci = 1.29 - 1.76 , p < 0.00001 ; cc vs. gc + gg : or = 1.72 , 95 % ci = 1.49 - 1.99 , p < 0.00001 ) as shown in figures 3 and 4 .
when evaluating the effect of the polymorphism by ethnicity , we found a significant association in all genetic models among the asian population ( c vs. g : or = 1.42 , 95 % ci = 1.27 - 1.58 , p < 0.00001 ; cc vs. gg : or = 1.88 , 95 % ci = 1.52 - 2.33 , p < 0.00001 ; cc + gc vs. gg : or = 1.41 , 95 % ci = 1.17 - 1.70 , p = 0.0003 ; cc vs. gc + gg : or = 1.70 , 95 % ci = 1.44 - 2.01 , p < 0.00001 ) in a fixed - effect model .
among the caucasian population , figure 5 showed that c allele carrier was significantly associated with the increased risk of crc compared to healthy control groups ( cc + gc vs. gg : or = 1.75 , 95 % ci = 1.33 - 2.31 , p < 0.0001 ) .
no relationship was found in other genetic models ( p > 0.05 ) .

association of ace i / d polymorphism and crc risk table 4 displayed the summary of all genetic comparisons between ace i / d polymorphism and crc risk .
the i2 was less than 50 % and the p value was greater than 0.01 , suggesting no heterogeneity was present .
as shown in figure 6 , the result suggested that the variant d allele did not have a significant increased risk of crc compared with those individuals without d allele ( d vs. i : or = 0.96 , 95 % ci = 0.84 - 1.08 , p = 0.48 ) .
no significant association was found in other genetic models ( dd vs. ii : or = 0.86 , 95 % ci = 0.66 - 1.12 , p = 0.25 ; dd + id vs. ii : or = 0.97 , 95 % ci = 0.79 - 1.19 , p = 0.77 ; dd vs. id + ii : or = 0.91 , 95 % ci = 0.74 - 1.12 , p = 0.39 ) .

sensitivity analysis and publication bias a single study included in the meta - analysis was deleted each time to reflect the influence of the individual data set to the pooled ors .
the corresponding pooled ors were not materially changed , which confirmed the stability of our overall result .
the shape of funnel plots did not reveal any evidence of funnel plot asymmetry ( figure 7 ) .

discussion crc is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide .
although surgical resection remains a curative option for crc treatment , most patients with crc are not suited for surgical operations because of the advanced stage of the lesions when diagnosed .
thus , there is an urgent need to identify newer biomarkers to evaluate the severity of this disease , predict the prognosis of patients , and target the pathogenic genes .
recently , survivin has been reported to be overexpressed in almost all human tumors .
it is considered as a tumor - associated antigen for immune - based clinical approaches in crc [ 26 ] .
researchers have suggested that survivin is implicated in the progression of dysplasia to neoplasia in the colon [ 27 ] .
a significant role of survivin in crc progression and recurrence of colon cancer liver metastases has been previously demonstrated [ 28 ] .
the mechanisms of the survivin re - expression in malignancies are still unclear due to the complexity of its regulation .
genetic variations located in the promoter of the survivin gene have impact on the protein expression and consequently contributed to the genetic susceptibility to cancers .
the - 31 g / c polymorphism is the most extensively studied variant located in the promoter region of survivin , and the c allele has been identified to be associated with a higher transcription activity of survivin [ 29 ] .
this meta - analysis showed that the survivin - 31 g / c polymorphism was associated with increased crc risk in total populations as well as in asians , while no association was found in caucasian except the dominant model .
our result is in agreement with the study conducted by qin et al. , which identified that this polymorphism is associated with elevated cancer risk [ 30 ] .
survivin acts as an antagonist of apoptotic cell death and functions as a regulator of mitosis [ 31,32 ] .
it is a potentially interesting prognostic marker , implicating a shift from adenoma with low dysplasia to high dysplasia during human colorectal tumorigenesis [ 27 ] .
survivin overexpression was related with the increase of invasion and the metastasis of crc [ 33 ] .
a study conducted by choi et al. suggested that the nuclear expression of survivin might be associated with the metastasis of crc to the liver [ 34 ] .
survivin can be regulated by or cooperated with other genes .
the stimulation of survivin expression by tcf / beta catenin might contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of crc [ 35 ] .
the positive expression of survivin protein , directly correlated to that of bcl - 2 , acted on different stages of apoptosis to promote jointly the development of crc in a synergistic way [ 36 ] .
the combined expression levels of aldh1 , survivin , and epcam as strong independent prognostic factors for survival and tumor recurrence in colon cancer patients reflect tumor aggressiveness [ 37 ] .
furthermore , survivin is also a therapeutic target in cancers [ 38 ] .
survivin expression increases during the normal mucosa - adenoma - carcinoma sequence and is maintained throughout the progression of disease , which strengthens its appeal as a therapeutic target [ 39 ] .
the expression of survivin may play a role in identifying a subgroup of patients who could benefit from a targeted therapy against survivin in crc [ 40 ] .
much evidence indicates that ace associated with the pathology of carcinomas .
it is differentially expressed in several malignancies .
ace is a monomeric glycoprotein that is distributed in many tissues and biological fluids [ 41 ] .
ace can influence tumor cell migration , proliferation , metastatic behavior , and angiogenesis [ 42 ] .
the expression of ace is upregulated in several cancers with functions of angiogenesis and tumor cell growth [ 43 ] .
previous meta - analysis showed that the ace i / d polymorphism is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , indicating that this polymorphism contributes to hcc progression in the chinese population [ 44 ] .
recent analysis suggested that the ace i / d polymorphism might not be a common risk factor for overall cancer susceptibility [ 43 ] .
our results did not show any association between ace i / d polymorphism and crc in each genetic models ( p > 0.05 ) .
this is in accordance with meta - analysis conducted by liu et al. and zhang et al .
[ 12,45 ] .
several limitations were presented in this meta - analysis .
firstly , the number of included studies in the subgroup analysis was small which may have a relatively lower power .
secondly , other covariates such as age , sex , and smoking condition should be considered if they are available in each individual study to obtain a more precise result .
thirdly , the gene - gene interaction which is important in developing complex diseases should also be included .
conclusions in conclusion , the results from the present meta - analysis suggest that the survivin - 31 g / c polymorphism might be correlated with an increased risk of crc , indicating it may serve as a biomarker of disease progression .
however , ace i / d polymorphism is not associated with crc risk .
further large and well - designed studies in various populations are needed to confirm our results .
moreover , the studies of gene - gene and gene - environment interactions between these polymorphisms and crc risk should also be performed and considered .
competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

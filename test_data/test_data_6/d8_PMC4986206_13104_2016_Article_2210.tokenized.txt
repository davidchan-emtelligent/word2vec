background there were few reports in the literature of weil 's disease with multiple organ failures , especially in children living in dengue endemic areas .
case presentation a 12 - year - old child was admitted to tangerang district hospital with a provisional diagnosis of dengue infection .
on the third day of hospitalization , dengue diagnostic tests were negative .
as fever still remained and was followed by jaundice , decreasing hemoglobin , increasing bilirubin with abnormal value of liver enzymes ; other causes of disease were investigated .
leptospirosis was confirmed by rapid igm test ( sd ( r )) for leptospira ; and micro - agglutination test which indicated leptospira serogroup bataviae infection .
the patient developed weil 's disease during the course of illness .
renal function was back to normal on the 21st day of hospitalization , while hemoglobin and bilirubin returned to normal three weeks after discharged .
conclusions our report highlights the importance of considering leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis in children with acute febrile illness ; even when the signs and symptoms for the more common diagnoses such as dengue or typhoid fever were pathognomonic .
a normal leukocyte count with neutrophilia and negative dengue ns1 , dengue igm , and salmonella typhi igm on admission should raise suspicion of leptospirosis , and prompt diagnostic assays for leptospirosis should be conducted .
electronic supplementary material the online version of this article ( doi : 10.1186 / s13104 - 016 - 2210 - 4 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .
keywords weil 's disease leptospirosis children dengue issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by leptospira interrogans complex [ 1 ] .
humans are infected through direct exposure to an infected animal , or indirectly via contaminated soil or water .
rattus norvegicus ( brown rat ) is the most important source of infection [ 1 ] .
the clinical presentations range from subclinical to fatal ( e.g. : weil 's disease ) [ 1 ] .
severe cases are more frequent in adults than children [ 2 , 3 ] .
in indonesia , leptospirosis was reported annually in 3 - 7 of its 34 provinces .
the total number of cases increased from 335 in 2009 to 651 in 2013 [ 4 ] .
as indonesia is a populous country , these numbers may be under - estimated for several reasons .
firstly , leptospirosis is clinically undistinguishable from other infectious diseases , such as rickettsiosis , dengue , or typhoid fever , especially during the early stages of illness .
secondly , diagnostic tests are not easily available .
lastly , leptospirosis is often not considered , especially in children .
case presentation a 12 - year - old boy presented to tangerang district hospital , on 12 february 2015 .
tangerang is a suburb in coastal area in the jakarta metropolitan , consists of both agriculture and business areas .
a large river crosses the middle of the town ; and some areas are commonly flooded during the rainy season .
dengue and typhoid fever are endemic in this area ; whereas sporadic outbreaks of influenza h5n1 have been reported since 2005 [ 5 ] .
this boy had fever for three days ( 38.0 degreesc , on admission to the hospital ) , headache , fatigue , and muscle pain .
the patient was alert and anicteric , with blood pressure of 110 / 70 mmhg , pulse 100 min , and respiratory rate ( rr ) of 22 min .
complete blood count showed anemia ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , thrombocytopenia ( 68,000 microl ) , neutrophilia ( 84 %) , elevated absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) ( 6048 microl ) , and normal leukocyte count ( 7200 microl ) .
based on these findings , a diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever grade i was made ; and the patient received supportive treatment with intravenous fluid , acetaminophen , and omeprazole .
on the third day of hospitalization , due to persistent fever , thrombocytopenia ( 20,000 microl ) , leukocytosis ( 15,000 microl ) , decreasing hemoglobin ( 5.4 mmol / l ) , and jaundice ( total bilirubin / tb 82 micromol / l ) ; the clinical team conducted additional tests which were blood smear and coomb 's tests for evans syndrome , dengue ns1 and igm antibodies , hav and hcv antibodies , hbsag , and serum transaminases .
all tests , except increased of ast ( 371 u / l ) and alt ( 120 u / l ) , were negative .
on the fifth day of hospitalization , the patient appeared septic with oliguria , continued icterus , and rr of 26 / min .
the clinicians requested rapid igm test ( sd ( r )) for leptospira which came back positive .
biochemistry showed increased of tb ( 366 micromol / l ) , ast ( 660 u / l ) , alt ( 179 u / l ) , bun ( 11.1 mmol / l ) , and creatinine ( 442 micromol / l ) .
leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were persistent ; and metamyelocytes were detected in blood smear .
blood cultures were negative .
interview with the family member revealed that the patient played in flood water near his house a week before illness .
treatment with ceftriaxone 70 mg / kg twice a day was commenced and continued for 14 days .
on the eighth day of hospitalization , the patient 's renal function declined ( bun 20.35 mmol / l , creatinine 503.8 micromol / l ) ; and he became anuric with decreased consciousness ( glasgow coma scale / gcs = 7 ) .
while waiting for the availability of the intensive care unit ( icu ) room for intubation , as required by the hospital standard procedure , the gcs improved in the following day .
the patient was hemodialysed on the 10th and 12th day of hospitalization .
after hemodialysis , laboratory parameters began to improve ; and on the 21st day of hospitalization , the patient was clinically improved and renal function became normal .
the patient was discharged although he was still anemic ( hb 5.5 mmol / l ) , had tb of 82.4 micromol / l and c - reactive protein ( crp ) of 1.2 mg / dl. his hemoglobin and bilirubin returned to normal three weeks after discharge. with the parents' consent , serial plasma and serum were stored and later tested to confirm leptospira infection .
leptospira igm rapid test ( sd ( r )) was positive in the samples on the first , fifth , and 20th day of hospitalization , and one week after discharge .
the micro - agglutination test ( mat ) assay was conducted in the leptospira reference center at kariadi hospital , semarang on serum samples from the first , 10th , and 20th day of hospitalization .
the titer for leptospira serogroup bataviae increased from < 1:20 ( on the first day and 10th day ) to 1:640 ( on the 20th day ) .
retrospective tests on plasma samples during admission were negative for dengue ns1 , dengue igm , and salmonella typhi igm .
however , several biochemistry parameters were slightly elevated , which were direct bilirubin ( 13.7 micromol / l ) , ast ( 123 u / l ) , alt ( 53 u / l ) , bun ( 4.0 mmol / l ) , creatinine ( 123.8 micromol / l ) , creatinin - kinase ( ck ) ( 326 u / l ) , crp ( 30.5 mg / dl ) , amylase ( 125 u / l ) , and lipase ( 98 u / l ) .
serial hematology and biochemistry profiles are described in fig. 1. fig. 1 daily hematology , coagulation and biochemistry profiles conclusions our report highlights the importance of considering leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis in children with acute febrile illness ; even though the signs and symptoms for more common diagnoses , such as dengue or typhoid fever , were pathognomonic .
this case also highlights the need for considering disease specific tests as early as possible to confirm etiology .
in case these tests were performed on the admission , a normal leukocyte count with neutrophilia ; and negative dengue ns1 , dengue igm , and salmonella typhi igm should raise suspicion of other infections .
this should lead to leptospirosis assays and a full hepatic panel examination .
unlike in our case report , leptospirosis in children is often milder than in adults [ 2 , 3 ] .
our literature search only finds a few case reports of children with weil 's disease or severe leptospirosis [ 6 - 9 ] , and none of them was from indonesia .
the involvement of multisystem organs was only reported in the two cases from samoa and srilanka [ 6 , 9 ] ; whereas in two other cases , no liver involvement was detected [ 7 , 8 ] .
in our case , an early 2 - 3 times increase in transaminase , amylase , lipase , and ck on admission indicated hepatic and pancreatic involvement ; and rhabdomyolysis .
neutrophilia , anc , and thrombocytopenia on admission , followed by hemolytic anemia and the appearance of immature erythrocytes and increasing bun and creatinine level on the second day , indicated hematological abnormalities and acute renal injury .
pulmonary involvement was evident by dyspnea and pleural effusion ; and coagulation disorder was evident by increasing prothrombin time ( pt ) and an activated partial thromboplastin time ( ptt ) on the fifth day .
neurological involvement occurred on the eighth day of hospitalization when the patient was unconscious ( gcs = 7 ) .
platelet was the first that returned to normal ( on the eighth day ) , followed by pt , aptt , and transaminase ( on the 10 - 12th day ) .
the earlier recoveries of transaminase and persistent hyperbilirubinemia , which may last for more than five weeks [ 10 ] , suggest that disruption of hepatocyte intercellular junctions is more severe than hepatocellular damage .
the persistence of anemia might be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome which occurs in rare cases of severe leptospirosis , probably as a result of the action of leptospiral toxins [ 11 ] ; and / or the disturbance of erythropoietin production due to renal peritubular function impairment [ 1 ] .
as this patient has no underlying diseases or comorbidities , we can only speculate that ( 1 ) the clinical severity was associated with the batavia strain that was found in this patient , which might be as virulent as other strains that were previously reported ( e.g. : strain icterohemorrhagica ) [ 12 ] ; and / or ( 2 ) the route of exposure ( skin ) and infectious dose were the risk factors for severity [ 13 , 14 ] ; ( 3 ) severe leptospirosis is rare and therefore the asymptomatic infection and clinically mild cases are rarely confirmed or often misdiagnosed with dengue or salmonella infections [ 14 ] ; ( 4 ) the severity was associated with the delay of the prompt treatment as it is well - documented that appropriate and early antibiotic treatment in leptospirosis cases leads to better disease outcomes [ 1 ] .
our report also highlights the importance of having accurate and early diagnostic tests for dengue infection to convince clinicians that when the results are negative , dengue infection can be excluded and other etiologies should be considered .
the current dengue ns1 test is very specific for the first few days of fever ; however , the sensitivity is low especially in endemic countries [ 15 ] , whereas the igm may only be accurate on the fifth day of illness [ 16 ] .
despite the detection of leptospira by using leptospira igm rapid test ( sd ( r )) in our case , this rapid test has not been validated .
in addition , the confirmation test ( mat ) can only be conducted at a reference laboratory , which are only available at two hospitals in indonesia .
given the lack of reliable rapid tests and often unclear contact and exposure history , the findings of leukocytosis with a high anc , elevated ck , and raised of hepatic and renal function parameters may suggest leptospirosis .
early diagnosis of leptospirosis would enable clinicians to start antibiotic treatment earlier , which is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality .

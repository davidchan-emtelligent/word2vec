we investigate the lateral dynamics in a purely viscous lipid membrane which is supported by a thin polymer sheet ( polymer - supported membrane ) .
the generalized frequency - dependent mobility tensor of the polymer - supported membrane is obtained by taking into account the viscoelasticity of the polymer sheet .
due to its viscoelasticity , the cross - correlation functions of two particles embedded in the membrane exhibit an anomalous diffusion .
a useful relation for two - point microrheology connecting the cross - correlation function and the modulus of the polymer sheet is provided .
supported membranes lipids viscoelasticity diffusion microrheology 1 .
introduction biomembranes are thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluids which separate inner and outer environments of organelles in cells [ 1 ] .
the fluidity of biomembranes is guaranteed mainly due to the lipid molecules , which are in the liquid crystalline state at physiological temperatures .
proteins and other molecules embedded in biomembranes undergo lateral diffusion , which plays an important role in biological functions [ 2,3 ] .
in order to study the lateral dynamics in biomembranes , lipid - bilayer membranes supported on solid substrates have been widely used [ 4 ] .
the standard method is to place membranes , either biomembranes or artificial membranes , directly on solids , which are called as solid - supported membranes .
however , experiments using solid - supported membranes have some fundamental difficulties .
this is because the membrane - substrate distance is usually not large enough to avoid direct contact between membrane proteins and the solid surface .
such a direct contact leads to a frictional coupling between proteins and the solid support , which may cause protein denaturation .
one way to avoid this problem is to put thin soft polymeric materials between the membrane and the solid substrate [ 5 ] .
for such polymer - supported membranes , the typical thickness of a polymer cushion is 10 - 100 nm. moreover , polymer - supported membranes can be used as cell - surface models that connect biological and artificial materials [ 6 ] .
in fact , it is known that cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells contains proteins and organelles , including a thick sub - membrane layer of actin - meshwork forming a part of the cell cytoskeleton .
also the extra - cellular fluid consists of extracellular matrix or hyaluronic acid gel .
it is important to note that hydrated polymer cushions are generally viscoelastic rather than purely viscous because they are essentially polymer solutions .
recently , it was theoretically shown by us that the mean square displacement of a single inclusion embedded in a viscous membrane exhibits an anomalous diffusion due to the viscoelasticity of the surrounding solvent [ 7 ] .
this means that the presence of a polymer sheet could have a significant influence on the membrane lateral dynamics .
in this paper , we discuss the dynamics and response of polymer - supported membranes by taking into account the viscoelastic property of the thin polymer sheet .
focusing on the two - particle tracking case , we show that the viscoelasticity of the polymer cushion leads to an anomalous ( subdiffusive ) dynamics in the 2d viscous membrane .
we also give a relation connecting the cross - correlation function and the modulus of the polymer sheet , which is useful for two - point microrheology experiments .
in the next section , we shall first discuss the hydrodynamic mobility tensor of polymer - supported membranes .
using this mobility tensor , we obtain in section 3 the cross - correlation functions of two distinct particle positions , and argue the effects due to the viscoelasticity of the ambient polymer sheet .
in section 4 , we give a useful relation for two - point microrheology as well as some discussion .
2. mobility tensor of polymer - supported membranes our model system is similar to those in [ 7,8,9 ] and is schematically depicted in figure 1 .
a flat thin film of purely viscous membrane with 2d viscosity eta lies on the xy - plane a distance h away from a solid substrate .
the space between the thin film and the substrate is filled with a viscoelastic polymer sheet with frequency dependent 3d viscosity etap [ omega ] .
the space on the other side of the film is occupied by a semi - infinite fluid with 3d viscosity etaf .
all fluids including the membrane are assumed to be incompressible and their inertial effects are neglected here .
the latter assumption is always justified as long as we are concerned with a long - time behavior .
a convenient way to characterize the membrane dynamics as a fluid medium is through the hydrodynamic mobility tensor g , which relates the membrane velocity v to a point force f. within the linearized hydrodynamics , they are related by ( 1 ) v [ k,omega ]= g [ k,omega ]. f [ k,omega ] .
here the 2d fourier transform in space and the fourier - laplace transform in time for any function of space and time f ( r,t ) is defined by f [ k,omega ]= integral - infinityinfinityd2rintegral0infinitydtf ( r,t ) exp [ - i ( k.r + omegat )] , where k =( kx,ky ) is the 2d wavevector and omega the angular frequency .
the mobility tensor for a supported membrane is given by the equation ( 80 ) in [ 9 ] when the surrounding fluids are purely viscous , and how to take into account the viscoelasticity of the ambient fluid is discussed in [ 7 ] .
using these previous results , we obtain the frequency - dependent mobility tensor for a polymer - supported membrane ( see figure 1 ) as ( 2 ) galphabeta [ k,omega ]= 1etak2 + etafk + etap [ omega ] kcoth ( kh ) deltaalphabeta - kalphakbetak2 , where alpha,beta = x,y and k =| k | .
we note that the case when h - - > infinity and etap [ omega ]= etaf ( without polymer ) was originally considered by saffman and delbruck [ 10,11,12 ] .
figure 1 schematic picture showing a planar viscous membrane with 2d viscosity eta .
it is supported by a viscoelastic polymer cushion of 3d frequency - dependent viscosity etap [ omega ] .
the distance between the membrane and the solid substrate ( or the thickness of the polymer sheet ) is h. the upper region of the film is occupied by a semi - infinite fluid with 3d viscosity etaf .
the two correlated point particles " 1 " and " 2 " are separated by a distance r. since we are interested in polymer - supported membranes , we follow here the discussion in [ 13 ] , and consider the limit of a vanishingly small h - - > 0 , as opposed to the saffman - delbruck case .
then the above expression is approximated as ( 3 ) galphabeta [ k,omega ]=~ 1eta ( k2 + nuk + kappa2 [ omega ]) deltaalphabeta - kalphakbetak2 , where nu = etaf / eta and ( 4 ) kappa [ omega ]= etap [ omega ] etah1 / 2 .
notice that kappa [ omega ] does not depend on k. equation ( 3 ) has two poles at k +/ - = nu [ - 1 +/ - 1 - 4 ( kappa / nu ) 2 ]/ 2 , which in the limit h - - > 0 turn into k +/ - =+/ - ikappa .
hence , for sufficiently small h , the mobility tensor takes the form of ( 5 ) galphabeta [ k,omega ]=~ 1eta ( k2 + kappa2 [ omega ]) deltaalphabeta - kalphakbetak2 .
this expression indicates that the presence of the upper viscous fluid becomes irrelevant in the limit of h - - > 0 .
in the limit of omega - - > 0 , equation ( 5 ) reduces to the static mobility tensor discussed by evans and sackmann [ 14,15 ] and later generalized by us [ 16 ] .
in the following , we shall use equation ( 5 ) for the frequency - dependent mobility tensor of polymer - supported membranes .
concerning the viscoelasticity of the hydrated polymer sheet , we assume that its complex modulus obeys a power - law behavior gp [ omega ]= g0 ( iomega ) alpha with alpha < 1 , as generally argued by granek [ 17 ] .
this behavior is commonly observed for various polymeric solutions at high frequencies .
examples are alpha = 1 / 2 and alpha = 2 / 3 for rouse and zimm dynamics , respectively [ 18 ] , and alpha = 3 / 4 for semi - dilute solutions of semi - flexible polymers such as actin filaments [ 19 ] .
for particle - tracking experiments [ 20,21 ] , it is more convenient to work in the laplace domain defined by f ~( s )= integral0infinitydtf ( t ) e - st. one can easily convert from the fourier - laplace domain to the laplace domain by substituting s = iomega .
hence g ~ p ( s )= g0salpha , and the laplace transform of the polymer sheet viscosity is given by eta ~ p ( s )= g ~ p ( s )/ s = g0salpha - 1 .
therefore equation ( 4 ) can be written in the laplace domain as ( 6 ) kappa ~( s )= g0salpha - 1etah1 / 2 .
3. two - particle correlated dynamics using equation ( 5 ) and equation ( 6 ) , we have discussed in [ 7 ] the brownian motion of a circular disk immersed in a membrane .
here we discuss the correlated dynamics of two distinctive particles immersed in a polymer supported membrane .
this situation is relevant to two - point microrheology experiments [ 22 ] as further discussed in the next section .
compared to single - particle microrheology , there are several advantages to perform multi - particle microrheology [ 21 ] .
for example , long - time convective drift can be automatically subtracted in this method so that measurements of probe self - diffusivities become possible over longer times .
multi - particle techniques can be also used to investigate heterogeneous materials .
consider a pair of point particles embedded in the membrane undergoing brownian motion separated by a 2d vector r. the quantity of interest is the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the particle displacements < deltaralpha1 ( 0 ) deltarbeta2 ( t )> r , where deltaralphai is the displacement of the particle i (= 1,2 ) along the axis alpha (= x,y ) .
we also define the x - axis to be along the line connecting the two particles , i.e. , r = re ^ x. according to the fluctuation dissipation theorem , the ccf is related to the time - dependent coupling mobility malphabeta ( t ) in the laplace domain as [ 21 ] ( 7 ) < deltar ~ alpha1deltar ~ beta2 ( s )> r = 2kbts2m ~ alphabeta ( r,s ) , for sufficiently large r. the inverse laplace transform of equation ( 7 ) provides us with the time - dependent ccf : ( 8 ) < deltaralpha1 ( 0 ) deltarbeta2 ( t )> r = 12piiintegralc - iinfinityc + iinfinityds2kbts2m ~ alphabeta ( r,s ) est .
since mxy = 0 by symmetry , it is sufficient to consider the longitudinal coupling mobility mxx and the transverse one myy .
notice that the coupling mobility malphabeta ( r ) is directly related to the inverse fourier transform ( in space ) of the mobility tensor galphabeta ( r ) .
since galphabeta ( r ) can generally be expressed as galphabeta ( r )= c1 ( r ) deltaalphabeta + c2 ( r ) ralpharbeta / r2 , the longitudinal and the transverse coupling mobilities are given by mxx ( r )= c1 ( r )+ c2 ( r ) and myy ( r )= c1 ( r ) , respectively .
3.1 .
longitudinal coupling by utilizing equation ( 5 ) and the results in references [ 9,13,23 ] , the coupling mobilities for polymer - supported membranes can be obtained analytically .
first the laplace transform of the longitudinal coupling mobility is given by ( 9 ) m ~ xx ( r,s )= 12pieta1 ( kappa ~( s ) r ) 2 - k1 [ kappa ~( s ) r ] kappa ~( s ) r , where k1 [ z ] is the modified bessel function of the second kind , order one .
in figure 2 , we plot the result of numerical inverse laplace transform of equation ( 8 ) with the longitudinal coupling mobility equation ( 9 ) when alpha = 1 / 2 corresponding to the rouse dynamics .
here the dimensionless ccf and time are defined by cxx ( t )=( pieta / kbt )( etah / g0r2 ) 1 /( alpha - 1 )< deltaralpha1 ( 0 ) deltarbeta2 ( t )> r and t =( etah / g0r2 ) 1 /( alpha - 1 ) t , respectively .
figure 2 scaled longitudinal cross - correlation function cxx ( t ) as a function of scaled time t when alpha = 1 / 2 .
these dimensionless quantities are defined in the text .
the dotted and dashed lines correspond to the asymptotic expressions given by equation ( 11 ) and equation ( 13 ) , respectively .
in the limit of a large distance r - - > infinity ( kappa ~( s ) r >> 1 ) , the above expression can be approximated as ( 10 ) m ~ xx ( r,s )=~ 12pieta1 ( kappa ~( s ) r ) 2 .
when the viscosity of the polymer cushion obeys the power - law behavior eta ~ p ( s )= g0salpha - 1 , as assumed in the previous section , we use equation ( 6 ) for kappa ~( s ) and perform the inverse laplace transform given in equation ( 8 ) .
then we obtain ( 11 ) < deltarx1 ( 0 ) deltarx2 ( t )> r =~ kbthpig0gamma [ 1 + alpha ] talphar2 , where gamma [ z ] is the gamma function .
this result shows that the viscoelasticity of the polymer sheet leads to a subdiffusive time dependence of the ccf .
since alpha < 1 , the viscoelasticity slows down the normal diffusion process .
the 1 / r2 - dependence in equation ( 11 ) arises from the mass conservation in 2d rather than the momentum conservation [ 24 ] .
in the limit of a small distance r - - > 0 ( kappa ~( s ) r << 1 ) , on the other hand , equation ( 9 ) asymptotically behaves as ( 12 ) m ~ xx ( r,s )=~ 14pietaln2kappa ~( s ) r - gamma + 12 , where gamma = 0.5772 ... is the euler 's constant .
following the same process as above , the longitudinal ccf asymptotically behaves as ( 13 ) < deltarx1 ( 0 ) deltarx2 ( t )> r =~ kbt4pietatln4etahtalpha - 1g0r2 +( alpha - 3 ) gamma - alpha + 2 , which grows like tln ( 1 / t ) .
such a logarithmic correction leads to a time - dependent diffusivity .
it should be noted , however , that this asymptotic expression is valid only when g0r2t1 - alpha / etah << 1 .
the asymptotic expressions given by equation ( 11 ) and equation ( 13 ) are also plotted in figure 2 , which shows an agreement with the numerical evaluation .
3.2 .
transverse coupling next we discuss the transverse coupling motion .
the transverse coupling mobility is analytically given by [ 9,13,23 ] ( 14 ) m ~ yy ( r,s )= 12pietak0 [ kappa ~( s ) r ]+ k1 [ kappa ~( s ) r ] kappa ~( s ) r - 1 ( kappa ~( s ) r ) 2 , where the k0 [ z ] is the modified bessel functions of the second kind , order zero .
the numerically evaluated dimensionless transverse ccf is shown in figure 3 .
since the transverse ccf becomes negative for large t , we have taken its absolute values in the log - log plot .
in the large distance limit of r - - > infinity , equation ( 14 ) asymptotically behaves as ( 15 ) m ~ yy ( r,s )=~ - 12pieta1 ( kappa ~( s ) r ) 2 , which is indeed negative .
hence the time dependence of transverse ccf is simply given by ( 16 ) < deltary1 ( 0 ) deltary2 ( t )> r =~ - kbthpig0gamma [ 1 + alpha ] talphar2 .
in the small distance limit of r - - > 0 , on the other hand , equation ( 14 ) becomes ( 17 ) m ~ yy ( r,s )=~ 14pietaln2kappa ~( s ) r - gamma - 12 , and its inverse laplace transform yields the following transverse ccf ( 18 ) < deltary1 ( 0 ) deltary2 ( t )> r =~ kbt4pietatln4etahtalpha - 1g0r2 +( alpha - 3 ) gamma - alpha .
similarly as before , the asymptotic expressions in equation ( 16 ) and equation ( 18 ) are also plotted in figure 3 .
figure 3 scaled transverse cross - correlation function | cyy ( t )| as a function of scaled time t when alpha = 1 / 2 .
notice that cyy ( t ) can be negative .
the dotted and dashed lines correspond to the asymptotic expressions given by equation ( 16 ) and equation ( 18 ) , respectively .
4. discussion in this paper , we have discussed the lateral dynamics in a purely viscous lipid membrane supported by a viscoelastic polymer sheet .
using the generalized frequency - dependent mobility tensor for the polymer supported membrane , we obtained the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of two point particles embedded in the membrane .
the obtained ccf exhibits a subdiffusive time dependence reflecting the viscoelastic property of the polymer cushion .
since the subdiffusive behavior is expected for t >> 1 , we shall estimate the value of the crossover time t * from the condition t ~ 1 .
here we use the values eta ~ 10 - 10 pa.s.m [ 25 ] , h ~ 10 - 7 m [ 6 ] , and r ~ 10 - 6 m. some consideration is required for the value of g0 because its dimension depends on the value of alpha due to our definition gp [ omega ]= g0 ( iomega ) alpha .
following the description of polymer solutions in [ 18 ] , we expect that g0 roughly scales as g0 ~ gtaualpha ~ g ( etas / g ) alpha ~ g1 - alphaetasalpha where g is the constant modulus , tau is the slowest relaxation time , and etas is the solvent viscosity .
using the values g ~ 10 pa [ 26 ] and etas ~ 10 - 3 pa.s , the crossover time is roughly estimated to be t *~ 10 - 8 s when alpha = 1 / 2 .
since this crossover time is rather short , one would observe the subdiffusive behavior in most of the realistic experiments such as microrheology .
when r is of the order of a protein size , say r ~ 10 - 8 m , the crossover time is much longer and becomes t *~ 1 s. in this case , the lateral dynamics is almost diffusive up to t * .
however , the subdiffusive behavior becomes always dominant when t - - > infinity .
so far , we have assumed that the viscoelasticity of the polymer sheet obeys a simple power - law behavior , i.e. , gp [ omega ]= g0 ( iomega ) alpha .
this is certainly an oversimplified assumption , and the general frequency dependence of the polymer solution is more complex [ 18 ] .
in fact , the technique of microrheology enables us to measure the local mechanical response of various soft matter over a wide frequency range [ 27,28 ] .
for two - point microrheology , the measurement of the ccf gives the rheological information of the hydrated polymer cushion .
this can be most easily demonstrated by the large distance behavior of the longitudinal coupling mobility given by equation ( 10 ). with the use of equation ( 7 ) , we have ( 19 ) < deltar ~ x1deltar ~ x2 ( s )> r = kbthpir2s2eta ~ p ( s )= kbthpir2sg ~ p ( s ) .
this equation relates the observed transverse ccf to the modulus of the underlying polymer sheet ( rather than the membrane ) .
in other words , we can extract the 3d bulk information by using the 2d dynamics taking place in the membrane .
once g ~ p ( s ) is obtained from the experiment , the frequency dependence of the storage and the loss moduli can be deduced by identifying gp [ omega ]= gp '[ omega ]+ igp ''[ omega ]= g ~ s ( s = iomega ) .
notice that these two representations are equivalent because gp '[ omega ] and gp ''[ omega ] are related by the kramers - kronig relation [ 20,21 ] .
some caution is required when applying our theory to experiments .
for two - particle tracking , the distance between the two point particles ( which can be small membrane proteins ) should be larger than the network mesh size .
otherwise , the viscoelastic effect is not reflected in the lateral dynamics .
in order to obtain the full time behavior of the particle motion , one should use a viscoelastic modulus that is dependent both on wavevector and frequency .
in this paper , we have intentionally treated the membrane as a purely viscous 2d fluid in order to emphasize the role of the ambient polymer sheet .
in general , however , lipid membranes themselves can also be viscoelastic .
recently , viscoelasticity of phospholipid langmuir monolayers in a liquid - condensed phase was measured using active microrheology [ 29,30 ] .
the viscoelasticity of membrane itself was theoretically taken into account in [ 31,32 ] .

background megakaryocytic cell maturation involves polyploidization , and megakaryocyte ( mk ) ploidy correlates with their maturation and platelet production .
retardation of mk maturation is closely associated with poor mk engraftment after cord blood transplantation and neonatal thrombocytopenia .
despite the high prevalence of thrombocytopenia in a range of setting that affect infants to adults , there are still very limited modalities of treatment .
methods human cd34 + cells were isolated from cord blood or bone marrow samples acquired from consenting patients .
cells were cultured and induced using 616452 and compared to current drugs on the market such as rominplostim or tpo .
ploidy analysis was completed using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis .
animal studies consisted of transplanting human cd34 + cells into nod.cg - prkdcscidil2rgtm1wjl / szj mice followed by daily injections of 15 mg / kg of 616452 .
results within one week of culture , the chemical was able to induce polyploidization , the process required for megakaryocyte maturation with the accumulation of dna content , to 64 n or greater to achieve a relative adult size .
we observed fold increases as high as 200 - fold in cells of 16 n or greater compared to un - induced cells with a dose - dependent manner .
in addition , mk differentiated in the presence of 616452 demonstrated a more robust capacity of mk differentiation than that of mks cultured with rominplostim used for adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) patients .
in mice transplanted with human cord blood , 616452 strikingly enhanced mk reconstitution in the marrow and human peripheral platelet production .
the molecular therapeutic actions for this chemical may be through tpo - independent pathways .
conclusion our studies may have an important impact on our fundamental understanding of fetal mk biology , the clinical management of thrombocytopenic neonates and leukemic differentiation therapy .

new york state stem cell science grantsc0281148 ma yupo issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background megakaryocytes are one of few cell types that undergo endomitosis , a form of cell cycle that skips the late stages of mitosis to become polyploid [ 1 - 4 ] .
human megakaryocytes commonly reach ploidy states of 16 n and can achieve states as high as 128 n. the mechanism of polyploidization is still not well understood , however , polyploidy is required for functional human megakaryocyte maturation .
once active , the megakaryocytes are responsible for the production of platelets that have well - characterized roles in hemostasis , thrombosis , vascular integrity , development of the lymphatic system , and the innate immune response [ 5 - 8 ] .
thrombocytopenia affects approximately 20 - 35 % of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit [ 9 - 11 ] .
approximately 9 % of those infants are severe and experience clinically significant bleeding ( usually intracranial ) .
platelet transfusions are one of the only therapeutic options for thrombocytopenic neonates .
recent studies have shown that megakaryocytes of neonates are smaller and have lower ploidy than those of adults [ 12 , 13 ] .
small megakaryocytes usually produce fewer platelets than large megakaryocytes and typically achieve adult size at approximately 1 year of age .
therefore , an inability to increase megakaryocyte size and ploidy in response to increased platelet consumption might underlie the predisposition of sick neonates to thrombocytopenia .
in adults , clinically significant thrombocytopenia is often multifactorial often involving cytotoxic or suppressive effects of chemotherapeutic agents and malignant cells , respectively .
thrombopoietin ( tpo ) is synthesized in the liver and is the primary regulator of megakaryocyte development and maturation [ 14 , 15 ] .
recombinant human tpo ( rhtpo ) has been shown to attenuate carboplatin - induced thrombocytopenia , reducing the need for platelet transfusions [ 16 ] .
however , the clinical development of rhtpo has since been halted due to the natural development of anti - tpo antibodies in patients .
alternative routes to target tpo receptors such as eltrombopag , a non - peptide , small molecule , that have been shown to stimulate megakaryopoiesis of cd34 + cells in patients with multiple myeloma are in the pipelines [ 17 , 18 ] .
human umbilical cord blood ( hucb ) is an important stem cell source for patients who lack other suitable donors .
however , slower platelet engraftment is a major drawback of hubc transplantation .
platelet engraftment takes an average of approximately 50 days for hubc recipients , versus 20 days for mobilized peripheral blood cells derived from adult donors [ 12 ] .
identification of a megakaryocyte maturation inducer or co - transfusion of large numbers of ex vivo generated human megakaryocyte - committed cells with high maturation potential , could provide an alternative method to shorten period of thrombocytopenia [ 19 ] .
tpo and its derivatives have been used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult but not neonatal patients .
however , studies in models using the non - human primate or canine demonstrated that standard post - transplant admiration of tpo could not accelerate platelet reconstitution following autologous bone marrow transplantation ( aubmt ) or allogenic bone marrow transplantation ( allobmt ) , respectively , in myeloablated hosts [ 20 - 23 ] .
tpo stimulates the megakaryocyte formation in vivo , but it does not shorten its maturation time [ 22 ] .
although the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the differences of neonatal and adult mks remain unclear , studies in congenital disorders have begun to elucidate these mechanisms .
a transient myeloproliferative disorder with immature mk features ( impaired maturation of mks ) is seen exclusively in fetuses and neonates with down syndrome and gata1 mutations indicating that thrombopoietin ( tpo ) - independent pathways may play a critical role in neonatal / fetal mk maturation [ 22 , 24 , 25 ] .
in this manuscript , we introduce and characterize a novel chemical that has not yet been implicated in megakaryopoiesis .
we found that this chemical molecule selectively increased polyploidization and shortened maturation of cord blood mks .
the size and ploidy of cord blood / adult mobilized peripheral blood megakaryocytes were also dramatically increased in response to this chemical small molecule stimulation with a dose - dependent fashion .
the chemical also induced human peripheral platelet production in mice transplanted with human cord blood .
the molecular action of this chemical to stimulate the shortened mk maturation may be through tpo - independent pathways .

animal study : platelet recovery upon injection of chemical twelve 10 - week - old nod.cg - prkdcscidil2rgtm1wjl / szj ( jackson laboratories ) male mice were given sublethal irradiation of 2.25 gy. the following day , mice were given 50000 cd34 + cells and 300000 progenitor cells ( cd34 + cells that were cultured for 4 days ) via iv injection .
mice were given daily 616452 injections at 15 mg / kg. mice were bled via submandibular bleeding every 3 - 4 days , and the collected blood was analyzed using the hemavet 950 for platelet and cellular composition .
the mice were sacrificed on day 12 , and their bone marrow was analyzed for cd34 and cd41 .

the data were analyzed using the delta - delta ct method .
results identification of small molecules that induce polyploidization previously , we have shown that the stem cell gene sall4 is a robust stimulator of expansion of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells [ 26 - 28 ] and plays a critical role in hematopoietic differentiation .
we screened small molecules targeting sall4 expression using a sall4 luciferase reporter .
one tgf - beta pathway inhibitor , 616452 , was identified as a strong inducer of sall4 expression .
when cultured with isolated cd34 + cells , we noticed the appearance of large megakaryocyte - like cells .
induction of megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation in bone marrow ( bm ) cd34 + initially , 616452 was identified as a mk inducer in bm cd34 + cells when a significant number of large megakaryocytes appeared within 4 days of culture .
the control , induced with the compound solvent , only appeared to have one or two cells. by 10 days of culture , the large cells had taken over the dish ( fig. 1a - c ) .
live cell staining and immunofluorescence revealed all the large cells were positive for cd41 , a unique marker of megakaryocytes [ 29 ] ( fig. 1d ) .
analysis by flow cytometry showed an increase of two - fold in the cd41 + cd34 + population within 4 days of culture ( fig. 1e ) .
giemsa - wright staining revealed these cells are as large as 90 um with the average around 50 um ( fig. 1f ) .
although a dozen other tgf - beta inhibitors have been described , 616452 was the only one we tested that strongly induced sall4 stem cell gene expression and stimulated mk progenitor cell expansion and differentiation. fig. 1 616452 induces megakaryopoiesis in human bm cd34 + cells .
a representative plot of the effectiveness of the chemical 616452 , and how the induction of megakaryopoiesis was induced ( a ) .
bm cd34 + cells were induced with 616452 ( 10 um ) for 8 days and compared to control ( b , c ) .
the induced cells were stained by live cell staining for cd41 ( d ) and analyzed by flow cytometry on day 5 ( e ) .
cells were also collected for giemsa - wright staining after 10 days of culture ( f ) , to illustrate the multi - nucleated and lobular nature of the nuclei potent agonist of cord blood ( cb ) megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation from umbilical cord blood accumulated evidence demonstrates that neonatal mks are significantly smaller , of lower ploidy , and produce fewer platelets than mks from adults .
based on these characteristics , mks from fetuses and neonates have been considered to be immature compared with adult mks .
we then tested the chemical effects on neonatal mk maturation .
cells isolated from human umbilical cb were cultured in hematopoietic stem cell ( hsc ) media induced with 616452 and compared dmso - treated control cells .
larger cells characteristic of developing megakaryocytes appeared after 4 days of culture ( additional file 1 : figure s1a ) .
the quantity and size of cells increased over time. by 8 days , the culture dishes were predominately composed of megakaryocytes with the formation of megakaryocytic clusters beginning .
a giemsa - wright stain of these cells revealed a lobular multi - nucleated structure and a granulocytic cytoplasm characteristic of megakaryocytes ( additional file 1 : figure s1c ) .
flow analysis revealed an increase of 44.8 % of the cd41 + population as well as an increase in the cd34 + cd41 + population ( additional file 1 : figure s1b ) similar to that of bone marrow .
one of the unique characteristics of megakaryocytes is their ploidy development , which can be easily measured using propidium iodide ( pi ) , a fluorescent intercalating agent that binds nucleic acids .
cells induced with 616452 for 8 days revealed a drastically increased number of cells with greater ploidy .
in humans , megakaryocytes normally account for approximately 0.05 to 0.1 % of all nucleated bone marrow cells .
out of 10000 events , the control cells only elicited only 1 cell with a ploidy of 16 n and nothing greater ( fig. 2a ) .
the chemically induced cells produced over 100 cells of 16 n ploidy and registered ploidy numbers as high as 64 n .
616452 consistently induced greater number of cells in each ploidy category 4 n and above .
these studies were repeated by multiple independent experiments ( n = 5 ). fig. 2 dose and time dependence of 616452 .
ploidy analysis of the mk 's derived from cb cd34 + cells after 8 and 12 days of culture ( a , b ) .
cells were induced with 616452 ( 10 um ) , and analysis were done on the respective days using pi staining and flow cytometry ( n > 5 ) .
dose - dependent analysis ( n = 3 ) was done on cb cd34 + cells ( c ) with 1x concentration as 10 um. time - dependence studies ( n = 3 ) used cb cd41 + cells that were isolated by flow cytometry ( d ) .
cells were cultured for 6 days and chemicals were removed at certain time points and replaced with media containing only tpo .
the control cells were grown entirely with tpo 616452 works independently of tpo tpo has been highly associated with megakaryopoiesis , and one concern was whether this inhibitor is working in conjunction or is reliant on the presence of tpo .
in the absence of tpo , there was limited cell growth , but mk development was still present with ploidy increase of 5 - 8 - fold over the control in cells of 8 n or greater ploidy ( additional file 2 : figure s2g ) .
in the presence of tpo , cells of 8 n ploidy increased dramatically more with a 55 - fold increase over control .
this likely suggests that 616452 is capable of functioning in a tpo - independent manner .
however , it also has large synergistic interactions with tpo in accelerating the maturation of mks .
time and dose dependence chemical induction of cb cd34 + revealed that the longer the cells were induced , the greater the ploidy development. between 8 and 12 days of induction , the number of 8 n , 16 n , and 32 n cells nearly doubled ( fig. 2a , b ) , while the control remains almost unchanged .
at 10 um , chemical induces ploidy in cb cd34 + cells compared with control cells treated with tpo .
multiple replicates with cb from different individuals ( n > 3 ) indicated that there is little or no 16 n ploidy in control cells .
cells treated with varying concentrations of chemical indicated dose dependence : 2.5 um increased the numbers of 8 n ploidy cells by 10 - fold compared to control , whereas 40 um increased ploidy by 87 - fold over the same population ( fig. 2c ) .
there is also a time - dependent response with an increase in ploidy for up to 6 days in culture ( fig. 2d ) .
mk differentiated in the presence of 616452 demonstrated a much robust capacity of mk differentiation than that of mks cultured with rominplostin ( amgen ) we observed a significant difference between the cells induced with 616452 compared to a current drug , romiplostim used for adult itp patients .
cb cd34 + co - cultured with 616452 showed numerous large mk cells within 8 days of culture as compared to that of rominplostim , which had little to none ( fig. 3a ) .
the cells induced with romiplostim showed no significant difference from the control while cells induced with 616452 had an 8 - and 30 - fold increase in cells of 8 n and 16 n ploidy , respectively ( fig. 3b ) .
the greater ploidy cells ( 32 n ) could be seen both visually and phenotypically in the induced 616452 cultures which appeared drastically different than that of the control and romiplostim. fig. 3 616452 on selectively isolated cd41 + cells cb cd34 + cells were cultured with tpo , scf , il - 3 for 7 days prior for cd41 selection by flow cytometry ( a ) .
control ( dmso induced ) and chemical induced cells were grown ( n = 2 ) in stemspan containing only tpo for 8 days prior to cell cycle analysis ( b ) .
in control cells we observed only 6 % of the cells increased their ploidy numbers with no cells reaching a ploidy of 16n or greater , while 54 % of the chemically induced cells had a nuclei of 4n or greater with a 4.5 fold increase in the number of 4n , 30 fold increase in 8n and the appearance of cells with even greater ploidy reaching as high as 64n within 8 days of culture ( c , d ) .
cb cd41 + cells were isolated using flow cytometry and cultured in the absence ( e ) or presence ( f ) of 616452 ( 10um ) .
cells appeared mostly as single cells on prior to day 6 ( e , f ) but began to form clusters thereon , while the control had little to none ( g ). by 8 days of induction , the clusters were large and covered the entire plate ( h , i , j ) .
a cd41 staining of these clusters illustrates the composition of these clusters as mainly large mk - like cells ( k , l ) the extent of cd41 + megakaryocytic population in response to the induction of 616452 cb cd34 + cells were initially cultured for 8 days in a media specific to megakaryocyte expansion [ 30 ] .
the cells were labeled with a conjugated cd41 antibody and sorted by facs ( fig. 4a ) .
the resulting cd41 + cells were induced with the small chemical , and cells began to increase their size within 2 days. by day 6 , approximately 80 % of the cells appeared to be large in size by eye while the control had little to none ( fig. 4e , f ) .
aggregation of the cells began around day 4 with clusters of about 5 - 15 cells , 25 - 50 cells by day 6 and by day 8 the majority of cells were in clusters of hundreds of cells .
the control meanwhile had little clusters , but none that compared in size and numbers as the induced cells ( fig. 4g - j ) .
a live cell stain revealed that 95 % of the cells that were present after 8 days of induction with the small chemical were positive .
the live cell stain also gave some insight into the structure of the large cell clusters as mainly comprised of large mks ( fig. 4k , l ) .
out of 10000 events , a ploidy analysis of the cells after 8 days of induction revealed 2018 cells of 8 n , 585 cells of 16 n , and 86 cells of 32 n or greater ploidy ( fig. 4b , c ) .
approximately 54 % of the cells had a ploidy number of 4 n or greater while the control cells induced with only tpo had only 6 % of the cells with a ploidy of 4 n or greater ( fig. 4d ) .
there were 69 cells with 8 n ploidy and nothing greater in the control cells .
meanwhile , in our small chemical induced cells , cd41 - cells were also cultured under the same conditions with the control being induced using tpo and dmso .
there was little to no ploidy development in the control. fig. 4 616452 on selectively isolated cd41 + cells .
cb cd34 + cells were cultured with tpo , scf , and il - 3 for 7 days prior for cd41 selection by flow cytometry ( a ) .
control - ( dmso induced ) and chemical - induced cells were grown ( n = 2 ) in stemspan containing only tpo for 8 days prior to cell cycle analysis ( b ) .
in control cells , we observed only 6 % of the cells increased their ploidy numbers with no cell reaching a ploidy of 16 n or greater , while 54 % of the chemically induced cells had a nuclei of 4 n or greater with a 4.5 - fold increase in the number of 4 n , 30 - fold increase in 8 n , and the appearance of cells with even greater ploidy reaching as high as 64 n within 8 days of culture ( c , d ) .
cb cd41 + cells were isolated using flow cytometry and cultured in the absence ( e ) or presence ( f ) of 616452 ( 10 um ) .
cells appeared mostly as single cell on prior to day 6 ( e , f ) but began to form clusters thereon , while the control had little to none ( g ). by 8 days of induction , the clusters were large ( h ) and covered the entire plate ( i , j ) .
a cd41 staining of these clusters illustrates the composition of these clusters as mainly large mk - like cells ( k , l ) synergistic effect of combined tgf - beta inhibition two additional tgf - beta pathway inhibitors , 616454 , and sb431542 ( fig. 5a ) , were tested for their ability to induce the expression of cd41 and / or the maturation of megakaryocytes via ploidy analysis .
in both these cases , there were no observed increases in cd41 expression within 4 days , and no visible differences in cell size compared to control within 10 days of culture .
a ploidy analysis revealed no significant deviation from the control with these two chemicals ( fig. 5b ) .
however , when all these inhibitors were combined with 616452 , we noticed a synergistic effect of chemicals on the expression of cd41 to a nearly 2 - fold increase over the control ( fig. 5b , c ) increasing the cd41 expression from 10.02 to 20.26 % .
ploidy was also significantly affected with a 50 and 93 % increase in cells of 8 and 16 n ploidy , respectively. fig. 5 comparison of 616452 against other tgf - beta inhibitors .
various other tgf - beta ( a ) were tested against 616452 .
flow cytometry of cb cd34 + after 4 day induction ( b ) revealed inhibitors 616454 and sb431542 had little to no effect and may even negatively impact the differentiation into cd41 + cells while 616452 enriches the development by ~ 25 % .
the three tgf - b inhibitors induced at the following concentrations : 616454 ( 4 ) - 10um , sb431542 ( 5 ) - 10um , 616452 ( 6 ) - 10um .
when all three inhibitors combined , there is nearly a 100 % increase in the enrichment .
a ploidy analysis of the cells was run after 4 of induction the chemicals ( c ) to reveal an improved rate of maturation in terms of ploidy development on both days gene expression profile real - time pcr ( rt - pcr ) examined the expression of a focused panel of 81 genes ( table 1 ) related to hematopoietic cells ( qiagen 's pahs - 054z hematopoiesis array ) in vehicle and chemical - treated cd34 + cells from human cord blood .
since maturation does not visually occur until day 4 of induction , cells induced for 2 and 4 days were compared to un - induced controls ( fig. 6a ) .
there was a significant difference between 2 and 4 day - induced cells with about 15 genes upregulated and 1 downregulated on day 2 , and 38 genes upregulated and 4 genes downregulated on day 4 .
most noticeably , the genes associated with megakaryopoiesis that is related to tpo - independent pathways ( notch1 or 2 , gata1 , gata2 , il1 , il6 , il10 , and scf ) were up regulated .
repeat rt - pcr study further confirmed the significant fold increases in cd14 , cd80 , csf1 , gata1 , gata2 , il10 , jag1 , jag2 , notch2 , and pf4 which may give clues to the mechanism of action mainly related with tpo - independent pathways ( fig. 6b ) .

quantification of the expression level of related genes in human umbilical cord blood cells treated with or without 616452 harvested at day 4 by quantitative pcr ( b ) .
616452 untreated umbilical cord blood cells were used as controls as shown in the figure .
the values were normalized by gapdh expressed as relative quantitation ( rq ) , the error bars depict the sd ( n = 3 ) 616452 induces human platelet production in nsg mice several animal models were tested , but the main model used looked at the ability of cd34 + cells to differentiate mature and secrete platelets ( fig. 7a ) .
twelve 10 - week - old nsg mice were given irradiation and subsequently followed by cd34 + transplantation .
the cells were allowed to home into their niche for 3 days prior to the daily injections of 616452 chemical at 15 mg / kg via intraperitoneal ( ip ) or intravenous ( iv ) injections .
injections lasted for 12 days .
on day 8 , the mice were analyzed for human platelets using a tail bleed and were found to have significant increases of at least 50 % in human platelets compared to that of control , induced with dmso / pbs solution ( fig. 7b ) .
analysis on day 12 of the mice 's peripheral blood and bone marrow revealed a slight increase in mk engraftment via hcd41 + in the bm and little to no difference in the platelet measurements .
ip injections were found to have little to no effect compared to iv likely due to first pass metabolism of the drug. fig. 7 616452 effect in mice .
twelve 10 - week old mice were sublethally irradiated and transplanted with human cb cd34 + and then given either control injections or imk injections at 15mg / kg ( a ) .
platelet analysis was done on day 8 ( b ) and was found to have significantly increased platelet counts compared to control statistical analysis results are presented as the mean +/ - the standard deviation .
statistical significance was confirmed using unpaired student 's t test , mann - whitney test , or analysis of variance .
discussion there is a large difference between cells isolated from bm and those from cb. in vitro culture of bm cd34 + cells results in small percentage (< 1 %) of cells becoming large megakaryocytes by morphology .
however for cord blood , there is a significant delay with no large cells appearing at all in the first 12 days of culture .
this delay is of significant importance as it introduces many platelet - derived issues during cb transplantations , which are frequently associated with a late recovery and engraftment of peripheral blood cells of donor origin as compared to transplantation of bm or mobilized pb. as a result , patients present with thrombocytopenia and delayed hospital stays due to insufficient platelet counts .
to date , the major proponent used in the development and maturation of megakaryocytes is thrombopoietin ( tpo ) which was used in all our experiments as the control .
we initially discovered 616452 when cd34 + cells induced with it produced a significant number of large megakaryocyte - like cells .
within four days of induction , there was an abundance of megakaryocytes , and they only continued to increase in size .
these large cells were 2 - 16 times the size of the typical cells in the control .
in fact , the control cells when induced with only tpo had little to no observable increase in cell sizes .
cell cultures typically lasted only eight days after induction due to aggregation and formation of mk - burst forming colonies ( fig. 4i - l ) .
analysis of cells after day 8 resulted in inconsistent results due to the nature of colonies as well as ease in which the mks could be lysed by simple pipetting techniques .
these large cells were identified by their morphology , phenotype , and functionality .
a giemsa - wright stain displayed typical megakaryocyte morphology of lobular and multi - nucleated nucleus with a granular cytoplasm .
analysis by flow and live cell staining revealed these large cells to be cd41 positive , a protein typically expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes .
additionally , the induced cells were found to have drastically increased nuclear dna content compared to control with cells developing ploidy numbers as great as 64 n within 8 days of induction. between experiments (> 5 ) , there was an inconsistency in the number of large cells among the samples from different patients .
while the cd41 population appeared to increase regardless of the patient , the population seemed to differ drastically between certain patients .
this was likely caused by the variation of megakaryocyte precursors among patients .
using flow cytometry , we sorted the cells for cd41 + and cd41 - cells .
both populations were then induced using the small chemical and tpo .
we found that the cd41 + population induced with the chemical had increased ploidy of 4 n or greater in over 50 % of the cells while the control cells only had approximately 6 % , an increase of nearly 10 - fold .
in the cd41 - population , there was only an increase in 3 % of cells of 4 n or greater ploidy compared to non - induced .
while not perfect , a small fraction of cd41 + cells or hematopoietic stem cell remained after sorting that developed into the mk lineage explains the slight increase in the number of ploidy cells .
often associated with megakaryopoiesis , one concern was the dependence of this chemical on the presence of or priming by , in the case of cd41 + cells , tpo .
cb cd34 + cells were induced with the chemical for 8 days in the presence and absence of tpo , and it was found that the increase of mk maturation increased in nearly all conditions , with or without tpo ( additional file 2 : figure s2g ) .
however , the presence of cytokines does increase overall cell counts and copy number of mk genes , which produces larger numbers of mks .
the hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) of various other species such as monkey and mouse were isolated and induced with the same chemical .
a comparison against human hscs revealed the chemical to be the most potent in monkey with a 30 - 200 % increase in ploidy development of certain sizes and nearly 2000 % - fold greater than that of mouse hscs ( additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
even so , each species still experienced an increase in ploidy development .
the efficacy of this small molecule on platelet production was initially tested in various mouse models to no avail .
it was found that the delivery of this chemical was of great importance .
when given via intraperitoneal ( ip ) injections , the mice experienced no effect and in fact had a negative impact on the mice .
the optimal mode of delivery was via intravenous ( iv ) injections .
many mice models failed initially , but after the discovery that mice hscs are significantly less impacted by the chemical than that of human or monkey hscs , a new transplant model was developed .
the mice were given a sublethal dose of irradiation at 2.25 gy to make room for engraftment and then injected with 50000 cd34 + cells and 300000 progenitor cells ( cd34 + cells cultured for 4 days ) .
the mice were then given 3 days of rest to allow the cells to hone into their respective niches after which each mouse was administered one daily dose of the chemical at 15 mg / kg. on day 8 , we found that human platelet production in the induced mice were 50 % greater than the control mice .
the concentration of 616452 used varied from 2.5 - 40 um. although there appeared to be potent effects at higher concentrations , they could be difficult to achieve in vivo .
the side effect profile could be of great concern as mice injected with 50 mg / kg showed significant toxicity ( data not shown ) with the majority of the mice dying before the conclusion of the in vivo assay .
this side effect profile is of great concern when thinking about the translational effect to clinical medicine , and therefore further studies on the toxicities and delivery mechanisms by which to reduce such toxicities are necessary .
conclusion 616452 is a tgf - beta inhibitor that provides a novel pathway for the induction of megakaryocytes that do not work like the src kinase inhibitors like dimf or su6656 or any aurora a kinase inhibitors .
unlike other compounds , 616452 does not have much in vitro toxicity at the concentrations tested in this manuscript and is able to enhance the differentiation into megakaryocytes and speed their maturation .
this small chemical provides a new approach toward megakaryocytic diseases that has the potential for clinical treatments without unwanted side effects of other inhibitors caused by their toxicity to all cells .

616452 induces megakaryopoiesis in human cord blood ( cb ) cd34 + cells .
chemical induction of cb cd34 + using 616452 ( 10 um ) for 8 days compared to control ( a ) .
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for cd41 on day 5 ( b ) and also stained using a giemsa - wright stain after 8 days culture to illustrate the granular cytoplasm , and the multi - nucleated and lobular nature of the nuclei ( c ) .

616452 and tpo independence and synergy .
bm and cb cd34 + cells were cultured in the presence of scf and tpo .
in 4 days of culture , the cells were all healthy and relatively the same size ( a,b ). by 8 days of culture , bm cells appeared to have a few (< 1 %) megakaryocytes with a size approximately four times that of a regular hsc ( c ) .
cb however , had no such cells ( d ) .
those cells induced with 616452 for both bm and cb developed a significant number of large mks ( e,f ) .
when cb cd34 + cells were induced with 616452 for 8 days under various cytokine conditions ( g ) , it was found that 616452 works independently of either scf or tpo inducing mk maturation under all conditions .

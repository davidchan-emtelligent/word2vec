the human microbiome - - more properly called the bacteriome - - has moved from the backwaters of microbiology to the forefront of clinical science and opened new approaches to diseases , including autoimmune disorders , cancer , and malnutrition .
human virome analyses , however , are at a nascent stage and disadvantaged by the necessity for detecting viruses ( without highly conserved consensus sequences such as the ribosomal rna genes ) in the background of the abundant human genome .
overcoming this hurdle generally requires additional manipulations , such as nuclease protected sequencing [ 1,2 ] , rolling circle amplification [ 3 ] , or digital transcriptome subtraction [ 4 ] .
nonetheless , it is clear that we possess a rich and diverse virome that probably contributes to our health but also , when perturbed , causes diseases , including cancers .
cancer , viruses , and causality cancer viruses give us an important view on causation theory due to the peculiarities of their biology .
unlike acute viral infections , in which common sense and simple epidemiology provide an answer as to whether or not an agent causes a disease , viral cancers have complex patterns of infection that reveal fundamental weaknesses in current epidemiologic theory [ 5,6 ] .
tumor formation is not an evolutionary adaptation for any human tumor virus discovered thus far , and when viral tumors occur , they are biological accidents .
there are seven established human cancer viruses ( hiv is also considered a cancer virus , but it appears to cause tumors through its immunosuppressive effects , and bk polyomavirus is emerging as a likely cause of some transplant - related urinary cancers [ 7 ]) , but none of these agents cause cancer in the majority of infected persons - - cancers are not a fundamental part of these viruses' life cycles [ 8 ] .
instead , cancers are evolutionarily dead - end events that threaten the viral agent as much as the host , and viral tumors only occur in a minor fraction of infected individuals when multiple factors exist together with infection , such as specific gene mutations or immune system suppression .
furthermore , viruses in these tumors are generally nonpermissive for forming infectious particles - - or only marginally able to replicate - - and so tumor - based transmission of virus infection within the human population is virtually nil .
most virus transmission , which is the fulcrum for viral evolution , occurs between asymptomatic persons .
virtually all viral cancers are highly increased in immunosuppressed persons ( e.g. , post - transplant and aids patients ) , consistent with continued immune system surveillance being critical in controlling outgrowth of a tumor once someone is infected [ 9,10 ] .
direct and indirect carcinogens tumor viruses have been divided into direct carcinogens , in which intracellular viral oncogenic antigens drive cell proliferation , and indirect carcinogens , in which virus - induced chronic inflammation initiates cancer cell growth rather than a viral oncogene [ 11 ] .
for direct viral carcinogens , the interplay between immune system surveillance and infection can be readily explained : expression of a viral oncoprotein in each cancer cell provides a foreign antigen that can be recognized by an intact immune system .
kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) , for example , caused by kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ( kshv ) , is increased tens - of - thousands - fold among aids and transplant patients compared to the general populations from which these patients are drawn [ 9 ] .
a role for immune surveillance is surprisingly true even for gastric carcinoma , in which a hit - and - run mechanism for helicobacter pylori can be expected .
while epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) has been implicated in a subset of gastric carcinoma , h. pylori is likely to act as a direct carcinogen , similar to tumor viruses .
studies have shown that type iv intercellular transport of bacterial caga oncoprotein from bacterium to host cells may be analogous to a direct carcinogenesis model for viruses , and might stimulate an immune surveillance response [ 12 ] .
for tumor virus discovery , the relationship to immunity has been particularly useful .
merkel cell polyomavirus ( mcv ) , the cause for most merkel cell carcinomas ( mcc ) , was only sought [ 13 ] because mcc rates are elevated among aids patients [ 14 ] .
unsurprisingly , immune checkpoint inhibitors appear to be potent single agents in achieving durable remission for some viral cancers compared to nonviral cancers [ 15 ] .
although an immune dependence for the development of viral tumors is very strong , this should not be considered absolute since a virus that expresses only oncogenic mirnas or long noncoding rnas might escape immune surveillance .
an indirect mechanism of carcinogenesis has always been an intriguing possibility in explaining the role of many viruses that have been accused of being cancer culprits ( the so - called hit - and - runners ) .
but instead , hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) in hepatocellular carcinoma may be the only documented example of true hit - and - run , although most hcv - induced hepatocellular carcinomas retain some level of hcv infection and hcv nonstructural protein 5 is tumorigenic in transgenic mice .
pathogenic versus commensal tumor viruses another way to look at infectious carcinogens is whether or not a tumor virus is a rare or a common human infection .
commensal viruses are common , inapparent infections that do not usually cause symptoms or disease in the host .
while many commensal viruses , such as ebv and mcv , were discovered because of the rare diseases they cause , subsequent studies revealed that these viruses are common and usually result in asymptomatic , persistent infections .
this has important implications not just for patterns of tumor occurrence but also for how viruses are judged to cause cancer .
most tumor viruses are not common infections , and therefore , patterns of tumor occurrence roughly reflect patterns of virus infection .
hepatitis viruses b ( hbv ) and c ( hcv ) , human t cell leukemia virus i ( htlv i ) , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , and kshv are generally uncommon , at least in north american and european populations , and so risk factors for infection in these populations are also risk factors for their corresponding cancers .
for sexually transmitted tumor viruses , particularly kshv , hpv , and hbv , sexual risk factors for infection ( e.g. , unprotected intercourse , number of sex partners ) are prominent. with these viruses , population - based changes in sexual behavior can lead to marked changes in cancer risk : increased " safe - sex " behaviors may have contributed to declines since the 1980s for hbv - and kshv - related cancer incidence , as well as the more obvious effects of effective antiretroviral therapy among hiv / aids patients .
in contrast , increased acceptance of oral - genital sex in the united states may be contributing to a marked increase in hpv - related male head and neck cancer rate [ 16 ] ( hpv is notable for not disseminating after infection and so specific sexual risk behaviors can be epidemiologically linked to site - specific cancers ) .
these " pathogenic " cancer viruses do not differ conceptually from other acute disease - causing viruses : exposure and infection is the primary determinant for disease , although infection alone does not cause cancer .
epidemiologists generally use hill 's criteria to determine causality , first developed to address the question of whether or not exposure to cigarette smoking causes lung cancer [ 17 ] ( koch 's postulates - - frequently cited by non - experts - - were not first conceptualized by robert koch [ 18 ] , and were made obsolete in the late 1800s by koch 's own discovery of asymptomatic cholera infection [ 19 ] and by the discovery of viruses and obligate cell - associated agents that could not be isolated in pure culture ) [ 20 ] .
hill 's criteria are applied to address questions such as , " is the virus infection specific to the suspect cancer ?" and " does virus infection precede cancer appearance ?" for ks , epidemiologists predicted that it should be caused by a novel , non - ubiquitous virus [ 21 ] prior to discovery of kshv [ 22 ] .
blood tests were rapidly developed , and , by using cohorts already enrolled to study hiv , the epidemiologists' predictions were fulfilled and hill 's criteria could be rapidly and convincingly affirmed for kshv causing ks [ 23 ] .
a much more complicated situation arises , however , when viruses that are common commensals ( e.g. , ebv and mcv ) cause cancer under certain specific circumstances .
ebv is highly prevalent among adults (> 95 %) and so risk factors for ebv infection are generally not linked to ebv - related cancers .
similarly , mcv is a common commensal virus on our skin ( prevalence ~ 60 % among adults ) therefore mcv infection is also not a strong risk factor for the mcc .
recent studies reveal that there are 12 other human polyomaviruses , and all but one live as common commensal flora in humans [ 24 ] .
for some viruses , such as kshv in sub - saharan and andean populations , infection is also near ubiquitous .
how can a near - universal infection like ebv cause a rare cancer like burkitt lymphoma ?
this question stymied epidemiologists for 31 years after its discovery and ebv was not designated as an international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) carcinogen until 1996 .
this decision was not based on studies of the most notorious cancers caused by ebv , such as burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
instead , it required studies on a rare x - linked lymphoproliferative disorder , which could be shown to be directly related to de novo ebv infection among susceptible children .
hill 's criteria largely failed to address this controversy .
epidemiology is based on comparisons among individuals ( infected versus uninfected , with cancer versus without cancer ) , which may not adequately assess our modern view of multifactorial disease causation .
to better address commensal tumor viruses , one needs to turn to molecular biology .
mcv was found to be clonally integrated into mcc tumor cells [ 13 ] and thus the virus was present in proto - tumor cells before the beginning of cancer cell clonal expansion [ 25 ] .
in tumors , but not in commensal healthy tissue infections , mcv is mutated in one of its oncoproteins ( large t antigen ) that serves as the virus' major replication protein , and so it is not possible for the virus to ex post facto infect pre - existing tumor cells as a passenger infection .
remarkably , mcv - driven mcc does not appear to depend on specific host cell mutations but rather on mutations to a common , extra - human floral viral component .
furthermore , simple immunostaining for large t antigen reveals that tumor cells are uniformly infected with the virus whereas surrounding healthy tissues are not and t antigen expression is required for proliferation of mcv - mcc tumor cells [ 25 ] .
these findings have little weight in traditional epidemiologic assessments of causality but are fundamental to a molecular biologic understanding of cancer occurrence .
mcv is the causal agent for most - - but not all - - mcc tumors based on the molecular evidence .
commensal viruses have generally evolved to avoid causing symptomatic disease and only do so in specific host settings , such as immune suppression .
determining causality requires measuring the virus infection in the context of these factors rather than infection alone .
thus , ebv infection alone does not cause cancer but ebv infection of a post - germinal b cell having a c - myc rearrangement does .
a 21st century epidemiologist should not ask if ebv infection alone is associated with a specific cancer but whether ebv in a specific molecular context is associated with disease ( fig 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1006078.g001 fig 1 classical epidemiology is poorly equipped to determine multifactorial causality for common commensal tumor viruses , such as ebv .
multifactorial causal reasoning is shown for a simple electrical circuit ( inset ) with two switches , switch 1 and switch 2 , either of which can " cause " the light bulb to turn on. an analogous pathway is shown for the genesis of burkitt lymphoma , in which ebv is responsible for a portion of tumors , but also only in the biological context of other factors , such as cmyc translocations .
since ebv is nearly ubiquitous , teasing out its contribution to a rare cancer like burkitt lymphoma is supremely difficult using standard epidemiologic methods , but is readily evident using molecular biologic information that has been available for decades .
ebv is clonal in these tumors based on terminal repeat copies and epstein - barr encoding region ( eber ) in situ hybridization typically reveals the presence of ebv genome in all tumor cells but not surrounding nontumor cells .
these facts are biologically implausible for a non - causal passenger infection [ 6 ] .
to truly determine whether a candidate virus is a cancer agent requires effective vaccines or antivirals .
if eliminating the infection also eliminates the cancer , then the evidence is clear .
but , as shown by history , specific drug and vaccine development will only occur once a virus is already established to cause a disease or cancer , and there is sufficient economic interest on the part of biopharmaceutical companies .
animal models suggest some commensal virus infections are beneficial to host immune responses , and so , modeling a cost - benefit analysis may have to be considered for future vaccines that might prevent these infections [ 26 ] .
the payoff for establishing a virus as a cause for cancer , however , is enormous and can be seen in the ways that hbv and hpv vaccines have changed age - old patterns of cancer .

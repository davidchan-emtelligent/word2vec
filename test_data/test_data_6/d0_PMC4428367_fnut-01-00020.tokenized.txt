rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which pro - inflammatory cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha , play a crucial role .
the chronic inflammation , combined with reduced physical activity , leads to muscle wasting whereas fat mass would be maintained ; the resulting abnormal metabolic state is described as rheumatoid cachexia .
since the loss of muscle volume would be compensated by the increased fat mass , body mass index ( bmi ) is reported not to reflect the nutritional status in ra patients .
the implication of rheumatoid cachexia for cardiovascular risk and clinical prognosis is not clearly understood , however , adequate control of disease activity in combination with appropriate physical exercise could be the most important strategy to control rheumatoid cachexia and related metabolic problems .
rheumatoid cachexia cachexia sarcopenia inflammation rheumatoid arthritis introduction recent advances in the management of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) have reduced the frequency of so - called " cachexia " in ra patients .
in such " classic " cachexia , patients often look emaciated , under a malignant or chronic inflammatory condition with appetite loss and protein degradation .
however , in ra , persistent inflammation may induce muscular wasting without thinning ; the muscle loss in ra would be associated with normal or even obese appearance .
the condition has been named " rheumatoid cachexia. " although its impact on morbidity and mortality has been suggested , the significance of rheumatoid cachexia is not fully understood in part because of the lack of specific symptoms .
the present article reviews the current concept of rheumatoid cachexia , including the confusion regarding its clinical definition , and highlights the potential importance of physical exercise and nutritional assessment in the therapeutic strategy against ra. definition of cachexia and related conditions cachexia ( in classic meaning ) cachexia is manifested by unintended severe weight loss and muscle wasting , and can be defined as " a multifactorial syndrome characterized by severe weight , fat and muscle loss , and increased protein catabolism due to underlying disease ( s )" ( 1 , 2 ) .
the term " cachexia " originates from the ancient greek for " bad condition ," and often occurs in patients with advanced malignancy ( cancer cachexia ) ; chronic heart failure ( cardiac cachexia ) ; chronic renal failure ; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) ; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) ; and many other chronic diseases , including advanced ra. clinically , cachexia can be detected by assessment of body composition ( i.e. , measurement of muscle mass and fat mass ) generally using bioimpedance analysis ( bia ) or dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) .
muscle mass can be measured as fat - free mass ( ffm ) by bia , or lean body mass ( lbm ) by dexa ; values reflect the estimated mass of skeletal muscle and its metabolic activity .
since cachexia is known to be a major cause of increased mortality , " early and effective interventions " are needed to prevent the development of fatal metabolic abnormalities ( 1 ) .
to this end , efforts have been made to develop and share a consensus on the clinical definition of cachexia , including diagnostic criteria .
in 2005 , the special interest group ( sig ) on cachexia - anorexia in chronic wasting diseases was created in the european society for clinical nutrition and metabolism ( espen ) ( 2 ) .
the sig developed a clinical definition of cachexia ( table 1 ) , and to prevent delayed diagnosis and intervention , introduced the term " pre - cachexia. " pre - cachexia was defined as the simultaneous presence of the following four features ; an underlying chronic disease ; unintentional body weight ( bw ) loss (<= 5 %) [ cf : (>=) in cachexia ] during the last 6 months ; chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation ; and anorexia or symptoms of appetite loss ( 2 ) .

both cachexia and pre - cachexia are frequently associated with inflammation ; an imbalance between pro - inflammatory ( tnf - alpha , interleukin ( il ) - 6 , and il - 1 ) and anti - inflammatory ( e.g. , il - 4 , il - 12 , il - 15 ) cytokines is considered to contribute to the pathogenesis ( 2 , 3 ) ( table 1 ) .
sarcopenia sarcopenia is defined as " a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability , poor quality of life , and death " ( 3 ) .
primary sarcopenia is usually due to aging , while secondary sarcopenia occurs due to chronic illness , immobility , and / or malnutrition .
although sarcopenia is generally an age - related condition , it can develop at a younger age , similar to other typically age - related conditions such as dementia and osteoporosis ( 3 ) .
the european working group on sarcopenia in older people ( ewgsop ) developed a clinical definition , and consensus diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia ( table 1 ) .
according to this definition , most cachectic patients are sarcopenic , but sarcopenic patients are not necessarily cachectic ( 3 ) .
in sarcopenia , the decreased muscle mass may be associated with normal , or even increased fat mass , a condition termed " sarcopenic obesity. " it has been reported that fat infiltration into muscle would lower muscle quality ( 3 ) .
rheumatoid cachexia rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple synovial joints , and is associated with multiple extra - articular manifestations .
synovial fibroblasts and macrophages , activated by an unknown trigger , proliferate and produce a plethora of pro - inflammatory cytokines and catabolic proteases that would degrade bone and cartilage .
due to the chronic inflammation , ra patients often exert abnormal metabolism , including insulin resistance ( 4 , 5 ) .
further , patients with refractory ra or in advanced stage of ra have been recognized to be at risk of cachexia .
to this concern , for example , apparent bw loss (>= 5 % in past 12 months ) was in 1.0 % , whereas anorexia was shown in 5.8 ( when assessed with visual analog scale ) to 10.7 % ( when assessed with the functional assessment of anorexia / cachexia therapy ) , in ra patients ; overall , it has been estimated that patients with " classic " cachexia ( table 1 ) would be approximately 1.0 % in ra patients ( 6 ) .
in addition , to support the inflammation - induced cachectic condition , an animal model of ra had decreased daily food intake ( anorexia ) and bw loss , accompanied with muscle wasting ( 7 ) .
nevertheless , ra patients do not necessarily lose bw and often show normal range of bmi ; thus may not fit into the diagnostic criteria of " cachexia " ( as indicated in table 1 ) .
instead , a unique abnormal metabolic state , i.e. , rheumatoid cachexia , has been proposed .
specifically , in early studies , roubenoff et al. documented decreased body cell mass ( bcm ) and increased resting energy expenditure ( ree ) in patients with ra , suggesting involvement of cytokine - driven hyper - metabolism ( 8 , 9 ) .
the authors concluded that " cytokine production in ra is associated with altered energy metabolism and intake , despite a theoretically adequate diet ," and defined the condition of reduced bcm without obvious fat loss as " rheumatoid cachexia " ( 8 , 10 ) .
thus , long - standing inflammation in ra leads to a state of hyper - metabolism resulting in muscle wasting ( 11 ) .
a number of studies followed to assess the clinical implications of altered body composition in ra [ table s1 in supplementary material ; earlier studies are summarized in a review by summers et al. ( 12 )] .
most reports documented that muscle mass in ra patients was decreased , whereas the fat mass remained normal , or was increased .
ree was normal or increased , with some studies showing a correlation between ree and disease activity ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) .
on the other hand , total energy expenditure ( tee ) was reported to be lower than healthy controls ( 15 ) , that is attributed to a reduced physical activity ( 16 , 17 ) .
overall , the combined effect ( i.e. , loss of muscle mass and normal fat deposition ) would keep bw within a normal range ( 18 ) .
this condition can be defined as rheumatoid cachexia , or rheumatoid cachectic obesity ( 8 , 10 , 13 ) , which is consistent with reports that bmi is not appropriate to detect rheumatoid cachexia ( 19 , 21 ) .
in addition , the widely used mini nutritional assessment ( mna ) was not a powerful tool for detection of rheumatoid cachexia ( 19 , 21 ) .
to date , there remain no consensus clinical criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatoid cachexia .
van bokhorst - de van der schueren et al .
( 6 ) assessed the feasibility of using the espen sig definition of cachexia in a sample of 103 ra patients , and concluded that the definition was inappropriate , since reductions in bw and appetite are not apparent in ra. engvall et al .
( 20 ) and elkan ( 22 ) defined rheumatoid cachexia using different criteria ( table 1 ) , and estimated the frequency of rheumatoid cachexia as 38 % , or 18 % of women and 21 % of men , respectively .
effort is therefore needed to establish the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid cachexia ( 18 ) .
pathogenesis of rheumatoid cachexia a variety of factors are involved in the pathogenesis of classic cachexia , including suppression of the growth hormone ( gh )/ insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) system ; testosterone deficiency ; and an excess of myostatin and glucocorticoids ( 16 ) .
in rheumatoid cachexia , relative excess of pro - inflammatory cytokines is considered to be the central feature ( 9 ) .
pro - inflammatory cytokines including tnfalpha , il - 1beta , il - 6 , and ifn - gamma , the key players of synovitis and extra - articular manifestations , may activate the nuclear factor kappab and lead to an increase in muscle proteolysis via the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway ( 16 ) .
overexpression of il - 1beta would also induce anorexia and exacerbate muscle loss ( 9 ) .
further , use of glucocorticoid as a pharmacological treatment against symptoms of ra might aggravate the rheumatoid cachexia .
more specifically , glucocorticoids have been shown to induce muscle atrophy ( steroid myopathy ) through activation of the transcription factor foxo or repression of mtor signaling , leading to protein catabolism ( 23 ) .
the gh - igf axis may also be an important contributor , although controversy exists ( 24 ) .
in an animal model of chronic inflammatory arthritis , ibanez de caceres et al. reported a decrease in bw and reduced levels of circulating igf - 1 ; administration of recombinant gh was associated with increased bw gain without an increase in food intake , and increased levels of igf - 1 ( 25 ) .
on the other hand , in the model , arthritis was also associated with increased expression of the cyclooxygenase ( cox ) - 2 gene ; and administration of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) reversed the cox 's inhibitory effect of arthritis on bw , increased liver igf - 1 levels , and enhanced the expression of ubiquitin - ligating enzymes .
the authors suggested that cox - 2 expression was responsible for the arthritis - induced cachexia , through modification of the gh - igf axis and the ubiquitin - proteasome pathways ( 25 ) .
the use of recombinant gh in cachectic humans has been also approved for use in patients with aids ( 26 ) ; however , its efficacy in patients with ra is unclear .
therapeutic strategy against rheumatoid cachexia the consequences of rheumatoid cachexia go beyond muscle wasting and fat deposition ; while any impact on cardiovascular risk remains controversial ( 18 ) , it is suggested that rheumatoid cachexia exacerbates ra - associated disability and morbidity ( 17 , 27 ) , probably leading to sarcopenia .
the muscle volume of ra patients is reported to correlate with ra activity , not with dietary intake ( 14 , 17 ) .
further , even in ra patients with a high dietary intake of saturated fat , there was no correlation between fatty acid intake and rheumatoid cachexia ( 22 ) .
the most important strategy against metabolic abnormalities in ra may be the appropriate suppression of disease activity , for example , using anti - cytokine therapy and physical exercise ( 28 ) .
disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs rheumatoid arthritis patients typically start anti - rheumatic therapy using conventional disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs ( dmards ) , which may include methotrexate ( mtx ) as an anchor drug , and sulfasalazine ( ssz ) .
these agents are effective in the suppression of disease activity , particularly when used in combination .
the use of dmards in early ra is also reported to improve insulin resistance and dyslipidemia ( 5 , 29 , 30 ) ; this is likely due to their disease - modifying effects , rather than a direct effect on metabolism , since neither mtx nor azathioprine , when used alongside nsaids , was shown to affect energy metabolism in ra patients ( 9 ) .
indeed , insulin resistance in ra patients was shown to be higher than that observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus , and was correlated with serum levels of il - 6 , tnfalpha , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) ( 30 , 31 ) .
perhaps surprisingly , use of predonisolone in ra patients had no correlation with bcm ( table s1 in supplementary material ) ( 9 ) .
anti - cytokine therapies over the last decade , data have accumulated regarding the long - term use of anti - tnf agents in ra patients .
while solid evidence exists for their anti - arthritic efficacy , few reports indicate whether anti - tnf agents could improve rheumatoid cachexia .
marcora et al .
( 32 ) analyzed change in body composition in 26 ra patients after 24 weeks treatment using etanercept ( etn ) or mtx , and failed to find significant benefit of etn compared with mtx .
however , in a subgroup analysis of patients who gained bw during treatment , the etn - treated patients gained a greater proportion of ffm ( in the composition of the bw gained ) than the mtx - treated group .
similarly , elkan et al .
( 21 ) found no correlation between use of anti - tnf agents and body composition .
after a longer period of observation ( 1 year ) , chen et al .
( 33 ) found that twice weekly administration of etn was associated with increased bw , and increased serum levels of glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( gip ) , leptin , and ghrelin compared with treatment with dmards .
further , a recent prospective study ( 34 ) involving a 2 - year period of tnfalpha inhibition , demonstrated an increase in bw , bmi , total fat mass , and fat in the android ( truncal ) region ; visceral fat also increased , without any change in serum leptin and adiponectin levels .
the authors concluded that long - term tnf inhibition was associated with increased fat mass , with a shift to the android - visceral region , raising questions regarding the influence of tnf inhibition on cardiovascular risk .
this association is surprising , given that anti - tnf therapy is reported to improve insulin resistance in ra patients ( 30 , 35 - 38 ) .
il - 6 is another important pathogenic cytokine in both classic and rheumatoid cachexia .
serum il - 6 levels in ra patients are higher than those of healthy individuals , and are reported to correlate with a high ree ( 11 , 14 ) .
however , it remains unclear whether il - 6 levels correlate with muscle mass and / or visceral fat mass in ra ( 11 ) .
further studies are needed to clarify the involvement of il - 6 in muscle degradation , and the potential effect of the anti - rheumatic agent tocilizmab , a widely used monoclonal antibody against the il - 6 receptor , in rheumatoid cachexia .
resistance training and endurance training summers et al. suggested that alongside anti - cytokine therapy , adjunctive anabolic therapy , such as high - intensity progressive resistance training ( prt ) or nitrogen supplementation would be necessary to treat rheumatoid cachexia ( 12 ) .
accumulating evidence supports the significant clinical benefit of resistance training in patients with ra [ reviewed in ref. ( 28 )] .
regular training not only increased muscle strength but also improved disease activity , pain , health assessment questionnaire ( haq ) scores , and walking speed in ra patients ( 28 , 39 - 45 ) .
for example , marcola ( 44 ) and lemmey et al .
( 45 ) reported that prt for a period of 12 and 24 weeks , respectively , increased muscle mass while reducing fat mass .
lemmey et al. also reported improvements in physical performance , while levels of muscle igf - 1 and igf - binding protein ( igfbp ) - 3 in muscle increased ( 45 ) .
besides the resistance training , endurance training ( et ) is also important to improve insulin sensitivity and body composition ( 46 ) .
in a report by mikkelsen et al .
( 47 ) , it was revealed that life - long endurance exercise was associated with lower levels of circulating crp and il - 6 levels , and also with a greater muscle area compared to untrained controls , indicating potential anti - inflammatory effect of et. in fact , the combination of resistance training and et has been demonstrated to increase lean body mass and to decrease body fat in ra patients ( 48 , 49 ) .
these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of these physical therapies in ra and other chronic inflammatory conditions .
other approaches alpha - melanocyte - stimulating hormone ( alpha - msh ) is a proopiomelanocortin ( pomc ) - derived neuropeptide that exerts anorexigenic and anti - inflammatory properties ( 50 ) .
recently , gomez - sanmiguel et al .
( 7 ) reported that systemic administration of alpha - msh to arthritis model mice resulted in improved food intake and higher bw gain with decreased arthritis signs .
the authors found that increase in hypothalamic expressions of cox - 2 , il - 1beta , pomc , and agouti - related protein ( a stimulator of appetite ) mrna were prevented by alpha - msh administration in the arthritic mice .
alpha - msh treatment also decreased expressions of e3 ubiquitin ligases , which are markers of muscular atrophy .
thus peripheral alpha - msh treatment is suggested to be an anti - cachectic strategy in arthritis .
other approaches such as anabolic steroids or recombinant human gh have been proposed , however , there is no evidence to show their safety and efficacy ( 28 ) .
concluding remarks recent progress in anti - rheumatic therapies has made " classic " cachexia less frequent among ra patients .
nevertheless , a different form of abnormal metabolism , " rheumatoid cachexia ," has emerged , that may promote comorbid risks and deterioration in physical activity in ra patients ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 pathogenesis of rheumatoid cachexia ( a hypothesis ) .
nsaids , non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , cox , cyclooxygenase ; dmards , disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs .
to overcome the muscle loss and fat deposit in ra , it will be essential to first establish a consensus regarding definition of this disorder .
possible overlap with sarcopenia should be also noted .
further , tight control of disease activity , along with physical exercise and appropriate nutritional management , should be recommended to improve energy expenditure and reduce insulin resistance in ra patients .

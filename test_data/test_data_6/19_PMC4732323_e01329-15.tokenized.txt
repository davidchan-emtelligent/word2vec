we report the complete genome sequences of two classical swine fever virus strains ( jj9811 and yi9908 ) .
both belong to subgenotype 3.2 .
strain jj9811 causes mild symptoms and strain yi9908 causes acute symptoms .
the sequences were 95.7 % homologous at the nucleotide level and 95.6 % homologous at the amino acid level .
korea agriculture , forestry and livestock quarantine inspectionn - 1543083 - 2015 - 18dong - jun ancover - datejanuary / february 2016 genome announcement classical swine fever virus ( csfv ) belongs to the genus pestivirus within the family flaviviridae , which also includes border disease virus and bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2 ( 1 ) .
acute classical swine fever ( csf ) occurs mainly in young pigs and is characterized by high fever , lack of appetite , conjunctivitis , and constipation ; these symptoms are often followed by diarrhea , neurological signs , and hemorrhage of the skin and other organs , possibly accompanied by severe thrombocytopenia and leucopenia ( 2 ) .
host - virus interactions may involve many factors ( host age , genetic background , immune status , herd sanitary status , and strain virulence ) , which can lead to different clinical outcomes ( 3 ) .
since 2002 , there has been a genotype shift from csfv genotype 3 to csfv genotype 2 in domestic pigs in south korea ( 4 ) .
strain jj9811 isolated from jeju island in 1998 caused mild symptoms in pigs , whereas strain yi9908 isolated from the yongin region was acutely virulent .
information about the complete genome of genotype 3 of csfv is lacking .
therefore , the aim of this study is to analyze and compare the genome sequences of strains jj9811 and yi9808 to improve our understanding of csfv .
total rna was extracted from the blood of wild boar using the micro - column technique - based qiaamp viral rna minikit ( qiagen , usa ) and cdna amplified with a one - step reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) kit ( qiagen , usa ) using primers specific for csfv genomic sequences ( 5 , 6 ) .
the amplification products were then cloned into the pgem - t plasmid and sequenced using t7 and sp6 primers and an abi prism 3730xi dna sequencer .
the genome sequences of yi9908 and jj9811 were 95.7 % homologous at the nucleotide ( nt ) level and 95.6 % homologous at the amino acid level .
comparative analysis of particular regions revealed rather low nt sequence homology : 90.1 % for the npro genes , 87.5 % for the c genes , 96.6 % for the erns genes , 97.8 % for the e1 genes , 93.2 % for the e2 genes , 95.7 % for the p7 genes , 96.3 % for the ns3 genes , 94.8 % for the ns4a genes , 95.8 % for the ns4b genes , 95.7 % for the ns5a genes , and 96.3 % for the ns5b genes .
a similar analysis of 75 complete csfv genome sequences deposited in genbank revealed that the jj9811 and yi9908 strains showed 88.9 % and 89.5 % nt sequence homology , respectively , with strain alfort / 187 ( accession number x87939 ) , which belongs to genotype 1 .
also , the jj9811 and yi9908 strains showed 84.2 % and 83.9 % nt sequence homology with strain yc11wb ( accession number kc149990 ) , which belongs to genotype 2 .
a phylogenetic tree constructed using the mega 6.01 program ( 7 ) and based on e2 partial ( 190 nt ) sequences derived from 120 csfv strains deposited in genbank revealed that strains jj9811 and yi9908 belong to genotype 3.2 .
in summary , although strains jj9811 and yi9908 belong to genotype 3.2 , they show different levels of virulence .
the information presented herein will be useful for future studies aimed at csf eradication .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
the complete genome sequences of the jj9811 and yi9908 strains have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers kf669877 and kt716271 , respectively .

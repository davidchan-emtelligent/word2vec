a nucleotide matrix - assisted - laser - desorption - ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ms ) - based assay was developed to identify mtb ( mtbid panel ) and 45 chromosomal mutations for resistance to eight antibiotics ( mtbdr panel ) .
we conducted a 300 case trial from outpatients to evaluate this platform .
an mtbid panel specifically identified mtb with as few as 10 chromosome dna copies .
the panel was 100 % consistent with an acid - fast stain and culture for mtb , nontuberculous mycobacteria , and non - mycobacteria bacteria .
the mtbdr panel was validated using 20 known mdr - mtb isolates .
in a 64 - case double - blind clinical isolates test , the sensitivity and specificity were 83 % and 100 % , respectively .
in a 300 - case raw sputum trial , the mtb identification sensitivity in smear - negative cases using maldi - tof ms was better than the cobas assay ( 61.9 % vs. 46.6 %) .
importantly , the failure rate of maldi - tof ms was better than cobas ( 11.3 % vs. 26.3 %) .
to the best of our knowledge , the test described herein is the only multiplex test that predicts resistance for up to eight antibiotics with both sensitivity and flexibility .
tuberculosis ( tb ) is an infectious disease caused by the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) and has always been the top cause of death worldwide1 .
the world health organization ( who ) estimated that approximately 9.0 million people developed tb in 2014 , and 1.5 million patients died from the disease in 20141 .
reports indicate that most new tb cases occur in asia and africa and account for 55 % and 30 % of new cases , respectively .
moreover , the emergence of multi - drug - resistant ( mdr ) and extensively drug - resistant ( xdr ) m. tuberculosis has added additional threats to public health .
scholars estimate that 3.5 % of new cases and 20.5 % of recurrent tb cases accounted for approximately half a million cases in 2013 and were caused by mdr - mtb .
among these mdr - mtb cases , approximately 9.7 % were xdr - mtb .
the capacity of mtb to resist multiple antibiotics has rendered tb treatment difficult and leads to longer hospitalization and higher mortality in patients2 .
thus , a novel approach for rapidly identifying mtbc and antibiotic susceptibility has become critical for controlling tb. in clinical laboratories , the rapid identification of mtbc has mainly relied on acid - fast staining , which features a low recovery rate .
for example , only 44 % of new cases , including 15 - 20 % in children , can be identified by the presence of acid - fast bacilli in sputum smears3 .
therefore , many commercial or in - house molecular diagnostic methods have been developed to identify mtb .
among these assays , the cobas taqman mtb test ( roche diagnostics , branchburg , nj ) is one of the most widely used tests in clinical diagnostics .
another promising diagnostic is genexpert mtb / rif ( cepheid , sunnyvale , ca ) , which can simultaneously detect mtb and rifampin resistance directly from sputum within 2 hours4 .
both assays not only show good sensitivity and specificity but also exhibit certain improvements in the testing procedure , including convenience and turnaround time456 .
however , due to the growing incidence of tb cases caused by antibiotic - resistant mtbc , a novel strategy capable of detecting multiple - resistance mutations for different anti - tb drugs directly from raw specimens is necessary .
previously , we developed a nucleotide matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ms ) assay consisting of 25 - multiplex probes to detect 50 types of four cancer - driving mutations789 .
thus far , this approach has provided routine molecular diagnostics for more than 8000 cases under an iso15189 - certified central laboratory10 .
here , we extend the maldi - tof ms application to tuberculosis diagnoses ( see details in methods ) and successfully established a maldi - tof - based molecular assay for identifying mtb and resistance mutations for eight anti - tb drugs .
in a parallel test using clinical patient sputum specimens , this assay showed better sensitivity and specificity than the cobas taqman mtb test .
thus , the maldi - tof - based mtb assay is a promising new strategy for the rapid , simultaneous identification of mtb and drug resistance from sputum .
results identifying mtbc and non - tuberculosis mycobacteria ( ntm ) using maldi - tof ms the tb - specific mce3b gene or ntm common gyra gene was amplified using pcr specific primers ( supplementary table 1 ) followed by a single nucleotide extension reaction using " tb " - or " ntm " - specific probes ( fig. 1a,b and supplementary table 2 ) .
probes without a single nucleotide incorporated are referred to as unextended probes ( ueps ) and did not produce a mass - shifted signal .
due to the significant differences in the probe masses , the two probes can be detected in a single reaction ( reaction # 1 in supplementary table 2 ) ( fig. 1c ) .
to evaluate the specificity of the platform , genomic dna from several reference strains , including m. tuberculosis h37ra , 7 strains of mycobacterium spp. and 5 non - mycobacterium bacterial stains , were assayed in the pilot study ( supplementary table 3 ) .
as shown , only the m. tuberculosis genomic dna spectrum showed shifted signals for both the tb and ntm probes ( fig. 1c , lower left panel ) .
in contrast , the mycobacterium fortuitum and other ntm genomic dna spectra exhibited shifted signals for the ntm probe only ( fig. 1c , upper right panel and supplementary fig. 1a ) .
moreover , the k. pneumoniae and other non - mycobacterium bacterial genomic dna spectrum did not exhibit shifted signals for either the tb probe or the ntm probe , which indicates that the assay is highly specific for mycobacteria ( fig. 1c , lower right panel and supplementary fig. 1b ) .
taken together , maldi - tof ms can specifically distinguish m. tuberculosis , non - tuberculosis mycobacteria and non - mycobacterium bacteria in multiplex reactions .
limit of detection test for maldi - tof ms according to the results of serially diluted mtb genomic dna testing , as shown in fig. 2a , the tb probe 's shifted signal can be detected with as low as 5 mtb genomic dna copies .
the signal intensity correlates highly with the mtb genomic dna copies , as demonstrated by the linear correlation value ( r squared ) at 0.902 ( fig. 2b ) .
comparing results from acid - fast staining , bacterial culture , and maldi - tof ms we further performed a double - blind test with clinical isolates cultured from sputum specimens using an mtbid panel , acid - fast staining and traditional bacterial culture to identify mtb and ntm ( table 1 ) .
the results indicate that maldi - tof ms can detect the culture - positive mtbc cases of both tb and ntm with 100 % consistency .
however , acid - fast staining failed to identify 3 of 5 and 3 of 6 culture - confirmed tb and ntm cases , respectively .
detecting drug resistant mutations using maldi - tof ms in addition to mtb identification , we also designed an mtbdr panel with specific probes for detecting mutations in several resistance - associated genes , including rpob ( codon 513 , 516 , 522 , 526 , 531 and 533 ) , katg ( codon 315 ) , and inha ( promoter - 15 nucleotide ) ( table 2 ) .
to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the mtbdr panel , twenty mdr - mtb strains with known antibiotic - resistance mutations were obtained from the taiwan cdc and assessed using the maldi - tof ms platform and sanger sequencing in a double - blind study .
as shown , all mutations detected using the maldi - tof ms assay were also identified through sanger sequencing .
the results were 100 % consistent .
furthermore , 64 clinical mtb isolates with known antibiotic susceptibility , including seven xdr - mtb , five mdr - mtb , 8 fluoroquinolone - resistant mtb , 15 isoniazid - resistant mtb , 2 rifampin - resistant mtb and 27 all - sensitive mtb , were obtained from the ntuh for the mtbdr panel validation ( fig. 3a ) .
among 45 probes for 8 first - and second - line anti - mtb drugs , no mutations were detected among the 27 all - sensitive isolates .
maldi - tof ms had 90.6 % concordance with the drug susceptibility test .
four isoniazid - resistant isolates (# 3 , # 13 , # 37 , and # 42 ) and 2 ofloxacin - resistant isolates (# 10 and # 33 ) did not test positive for any of the selected probes .
moreover , the xdr - mtb clinical isolate (# 14 ) mutation spectra were clearly distinguished from the all - sensitive spectra in the rpob , katg , embb , and gyra genes ( fig. 3b - e ) .
using the drug - susceptibility test as the reference method , the sensitivity and specificity of our mtbdr panel are 83.8 % ( 31 / 37 ) and 100 % ( 27 / 27 ) , respectively .
maldi - tof ms performance directly using sputum specimens among the 300 samples tested , 79 samples were undetermined / invalid by cobas ( 26.3 %) testing , while only 34 samples were not identified by maldi - tof ms ( 11.3 %) testing .
using bacterial culture as the reference method for identifying mtb , the cobas vs. maldi - tof ms sensitivity and specificity were 46.6 % vs. 61.9 % and 96.0 % vs. 92.4 % , respectively , for the smear acid - fast bacillus - negative cases ( table 3 ) .
concerning the 11 smear afb - positive cases , the maldi - tof ms vs. cobas sensitivities and specificities were comparable .
in addition to mtb identification , mtbid panel - positive samples from the maldi - tof ms assay were further assessed using the mtbdr panel .
no drug - resistance mutations were detected among these samples , which was consistent with the drug susceptibility test .
overall , the cobas vs. maldi - tof ms sensitivities and specificities were 52.6 % vs 72.4 % and 96.0 % vs. 92.4 % , respectively ( table 3 ) .
discussion the nucleotide maldi - tof ms test is a simple , rapid and multiplexed method with high specificity , sensitivity and flexibility in many research fields , including mutation and snp analysis , sequencing , and microorganism detection1112131415161718 .
compared with other detection systems , maldi - tof ms acquires the absolute mass value , which represents an intrinsic property of a molecule , while others depend on signals of a relative electrophoretic mobility or a hybridization event .
in addition , the molecular weight is a significantly more informative signal than fluorescent label - based methods .
this study applied this platform to establish a rapid multiplexed test to detect mtb and its drug susceptibility in sputum .
when testing for mtb at an early stage , the sensitivity , specificity , positive prediction value ( ppv ) , and negative prediction value ( npv ) are comparable with other currently used methods ( table 3 ) .
compared with the limit of traditional testing methods such as the sensitivity of microscopic examination ( 22 - 65 %) or bacillus culture ( approximately 10 - 20 % unsuccessful ) , maldi - tof ms provided a solution for disease control and management151920 .
furthermore , the rapid diagnosis of mtb infections is critical for successful treatment .
however , due to the limit of detection , the low sensitivity impedes rapid laboratory mtb diagnosis in patients .
many pcr - based molecular diagnostic methods have been developed in recent years .
however , the sensitivity of the assays remains unsatisfactory , particularly for acid - fast stain negative samples in which only 43 - 74 % of samples were identified2122 .
our results show that the maldi - tof ms detection limit is less than 10 mtb copies ( fig. 2 ) .
this characteristic facilitates mtb detection in raw specimens , including sputum , and significantly reduces the turnaround time for diagnosis .
another advantage of maldi - tof ms is the panel flexibility for drug - resistant mtb prediction based on customized requirements , which are widely considered serious threats to global tb control .
in this panel , we simultaneously predicted resistance for anti - tb drugs , including , rifampin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , streptomycin , ethambutol , fluoroquinolone , pyrazinamide and ethionamide .
this test can identify drug - resistant mtb more comprehensively than the rifampin - resistant mtb determined using genexpert mtb / rif .
among 64 clinical isolates , all sensitive or drug - resistant strains could be identified using our system ( fig. 3 ) , which could provide a rapid diagnosis compared with the traditional six - to eight - week bacterial culture process .
because there was no mutation detected in six resistant isolates ( fig. 3 , # 10 , # 33 , # 3 , # 13 , # 37 , and # 42 ) , it was possible that other rare mutations may not be included in our panel , and any other unknown resistance - mechanisms may not be detected232425 .
the limitation of this platform is that maldi - tof ms cannot perform de novo mutation identification ; however , adding novel drug resistant mutations into the multiplex panel is a convenient process .
any newly identified mutations can be detected by designing a specific probe and coordinating with other probes in the spectrum .
thus , maldi - tof ms has a greater capacity compared with other molecular diagnostic methods , such as the inno - lipa rif tb kit ( lipa ) ( innogenetics , zwijndrecht , belgium ) 26 .
furthermore , due to the single nucleotide extension reaction in the biochemical process , this assay can detect various alterations within one nucleotide residue that other molecular methods cannot detect , such as arms or cobas27 .
the other greatest challenge for mtb identification is early diagnosis and short turnaround time .
regarding the time - consuming culture process , many well - established sensitive systems have been developed to improve detection rates at early stages , such as cobas and genexpert mtb / rif. with the development of new methods , sputum specimens have been routinely used in clinical diagnoses .
one important issue should be considered that may cause false negative results using sputum for mtb identification : the copy number of mtb in the sputum , especially in smear - negative sputum .
the overall sensitivity and specificity of cobas ranged from 66.9 % to 82.4 % and 97.7 % to 100 % , respectively5628 .
however , the sensitivity for smear - negative , culture - positive samples was relatively low ( 34.4 - 73.6 %) .
for the smear - negative cases in this study , maldi - tof ms showed 61.9 % sensitivity and 92.4 % specificity , which is better than cobas and comparable to other systems52930 .
methodologically , despite the concern of multiplex detection , taqman qpcr - based cobas required relatively high quality nucleic acids , not only in large amounts but also of good integrity , for probe annealing. that means samples with highly degraded nucleic acid or reaction inhibitors may result in a poor reaction and an undetermined / invalid result .
in addition , the unpredicted nucleotide alteration within the probe binding region may affect detection .
this may be the cause of the failure rate of maldi - tof ms and cobas in this study ( 11.3 % vs 26.3 %) ( table 3 ) .
the sensitivity of genexpert mtb / rif ranged from 43.4 % to 76.9 % in smear - negative , culture - positive specimens452931323334 .
maldi - tof ms was also competitive with this method .
however , for clinical utility , using genexpert mtb / rif might be restricted by the limited shelf - life of the cartridges , strict environmental considerations or high - level hardware requirements3536 .
thus , maldi - tof ms may provide a more friendly platform for tb management than other methodologies .
finally , the ppv and the npv are also important for clinical practice .
in this study , the ppv of the pooled specimens was unsatisfactory ( table 3 ) due to a low prevalence rate in the unselected patient population .
it should be noted that only 3.6 % of samples were smear - positive in this study .
although this is similar to another study that examined a large number of specimens , we think a more comprehensive prospective study is necessary for further clinical validation37 .
maldi - tof ms may be suitable for low - prevalence developing countries .
taken together , we developed a maldi - tof ms - based highly sensitive molecular testing method that combines mtb identification and drug - resistance predictions .
it should be emphasized that the flexibility will allow clinicians to rearrange or modify the detection panels based on clinical needs .
additionally , to the best of our knowledge , this is the only platform that comprehensively features multiplex detection for most mtb drug - resistant mutations , not only for rifampin resistance .
further , the turnaround time was less than 48 hours from sample receipt to data analysis , which is also comparable to other methods38 .
this method provides a powerful and an alternative strategy for mtb disease management and control .
methods study cases this study was conducted at the national taiwan university hospital ( ntuh ) , which is a 2500 - bed medical centre in taipei , taiwan .
a total of 300 consecutive and non - duplicate sputum samples that were submitted to the mycobacteriology laboratory of ntuh for mycobacterial isolation from dec - 2010 to july - 2011 were evaluated .
all experimental procedures with the patients' specimens and information were approved by the institutional review board of the national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan ( approval no .
201009064 r , 201103027rc ) , and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations .
all patients with suspected pulmonary tb were enrolled with written informed consent from march 2007 to december 2009 .
medical records were reviewed , and data were collected on age , sex , underlying diseases , pathology and microbiologic results , and follow - up observations .
a subject was categorized as a confirmed tb patient only if mtbc was recovered by culture .
patients with tb - related clinical symptoms and signs only or clinical improvement without anti - tb therapy were considered non - confirmed tb cases .
reference strains and clinical isolates of mtbc bacterial strains , including m. tuberculosis ( h37rv ) , mycobacterium spp. and non - mycobacterium bacteria , were obtained from the bioresource collection and research center ( bcrc ) ( hsinchu , taiwan ) ( supplementary table 3 ) .
all clinical isolates were acquired from the ntuh and the center of disease control ( cdc ) , taiwan .
laboratory examination , sputum dna extraction and taqman mtb the laboratory examination and sputum dna extraction methods are detailed in the supplemental data .
taqman mtb was performed using cobas ( r ) taqman 48 ( roche diagnostics ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
briefly , 50 mul of the extracted dna solution was mixed with 50 mul of the amplifier mix containing taqman myco magnesium reagent , taqman myco internal control , and taqman mtb master mix for taqman qpcr .
the quantity of mtb can be determined by calculating the difference between the ct value of the positive control ( ct / p ) and that of the sample ( ct / s ) by using the formula : mtb = 2 ^( ct / p - ct / s ) x 20 .
the resulting interpretation was according to the instructions for in vitro diagnosis ( doc rev. 4.0 ) .
all raw data calculations utilized amplilink software version 3.3 ( roche diagnostics ) .
the results of individual specimens that passed the criteria of the negative control , positive control , and internal control were defined as a valid run .
mtb was determined to be detected or not detected only in a valid , but not invalid , run .
mutation detection by maldi - tof ms all nucleotide mass spectrometry assays utilized the massarray ( r ) system ( cat. no .
10411 , sequenim , san diego , ca acquired by agena bioscience , http :// agenabio.com / , san diego , ca at 2014 ) .
it combined mass spectrometry and sensitive and robust chemistry in genetic testing .
briefly , for mutation detection , the desired region of interest was pcr - amplified using specific primers followed by shrimp alkaline phosphatase ( sap ) treatment to remove excess dntp .
an iplex ( r ) pro ( cat. 10217 , agena bioscience , san diego , ca ) single nucleotide extension was performed using the home - designed probe to distinguish the mutant nucleotide from the wild - type due to the mass difference .
the iplex ( r ) biochemical reaction products were dispensed onto the spectrochip ( r ) array using the massarray ( r ) nanodispenser rs1000 , a silicon chip with a pre - dispensed matrix crystal .
finally , the chip was placed into the massarray ( r ) analyzer 4 maldi - tof ms and analysed .
biochemical reaction for maldi - tof ms analysis tb identification and antibiotic - resistance mutation detection were performed using massarray ( r ) system and iplex ( r ) pro following the manufacturer 's protocol .
briefly , a total volume of 5 mul of a mixture containing 10 ng of bacteria or sputum dna , 0.5 unit hotstartaq dna polymerase , 500 mum dntps , 100 nm of specific primers ( supplementary table s1 ) , 1.25 mul of 10x hotstar buffer and an additional 1.625 mm mgcl2 was subjected to pcr reactions with conditions as follows .
a single activation cycle at 94 degreesc for 15 min was followed by 45 touch - down amplification cycles , consisting of 15 cycles of 94 degreesc for 20 sec , 61 degreesc annealing for 30 sec , 72 degreesc for 60 sec and another 30 cycles with 57 degreesc annealing for 30 sec .
the pcr products were then treated with sap for dntp neutralization as follows : 0.5 units of sap with 1.7x sap buffer were prepared into a final volume of 2 mul of mix and then added to the pcr product for 40 min of incubation at 37 degreesc , followed by 5 min of inactivation at 80 degreesc .
next , the sap - treated pcr products were subjected to the single nucleotide extension reaction by using an iplex pro ( r ) reagent kit containing 0.04 mul of sequenase , 0.1 mul of termination mix , 0.2 mul of 10x iplex pro ( r ) buffer and multiplex extension primers specific to mtbc , ntm and resistance mutation sites ( supplementary table 2 ) with a final concentration of 7 to 14 mum in a total of 2 mul of the mixture .
temperature cycling consisted of a modified 60 degreesc annealing and 200 - cycle extension method ( 94 degreesc , 30 sec followed by 40 repeats of 5 rounds of 94 degreesc for 20 sec , 80 degreesc for 5 sec , 60 degreesc for 5 sec ) .
after desalting with spectroclean resin , the samples were loaded onto the matrix of the spectrochip ( r ) using a massarray ( r ) nanodispenser rs1000 and then analysed using a bruker autoflex massarray ( r ) analyzer 4 maldi - tof ms. data were collected and analysed using type4 software ( sequenom ) .
the signal in the correct mass position ( corresponding to products ) , which passed the criteria of the signal to noise ratio with an acceptable probability , was interpreted as a positive result by the type4 software .
to confirm that the testing run was valid in sputum , the probe for the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) gene previously used was spiked into each test as an internal reaction control89 .
the " undetermined " result representing mtb detection was uncertain due to the poor reaction or other confounding factors .
evaluation of detection sensitivity for mtb by maldi - tof ms to evaluate the maldi - tof ms detection sensitivity , m. tuberculosis ( h37ra ) genomic dna was serially diluted in water and used for the assessment .
the maldi - tof ms detection limit was defined as the highest dilution with signal peaks that could be identified using type4 software .
experimental design to optimize the platform , standard bacterial strains including mtb , ntm , and non - mycobacterium bacteria were used for specificity testing , and serially diluted m. tuberculosis h37ra genomic dna was used for limit of detection ( lod ) determination .
the molecular testing was composed of two steps : mtb identification ( mtbid panel ) ( reaction # 1 in supplementary table 2 ) and drug - resistant mutation detection ( mtbdr panel ) ( reaction # 1 and # 2 in supplementary table 2 ) .
only mtbid - positive samples were further assessed for resistance mutations .
clinical isolates , including drug sensitive mtb , drug resistant mtb ( mdr and xdr ) , and ntm , were used to validate mtbid and the mtbdr panel , while bacterial culture , a drug susceptibility test , and sanger sequencing were used as reference methods for double blind comparison .
for clinical practice , a trial of 300 consecutive and non - duplicate sputum samples were selected to evaluate the maldi - tof ms approach in comparison with the cobas taqman method .
the traditional laboratory examination was used as the reference .

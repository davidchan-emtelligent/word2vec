this study aimed to determine whether a negative fluid balance (<= - 500 ml ) within the first 48 hours of admission in the icu is associated with improved survival at 28 days in a heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients .
methods we conducted a retrospective study in a 20 - bed icu at a university - affiliated teaching hospital .
patients admitted for acute heart failure , those who required dialysis before admission and those who died within 24 hours after admission were excluded .
demographic data , saps ii and apache ii scores were recorded at admission and sofa , fluid balance , hemodynamic , respiratory and renal variables once per day .
variables were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors and between patients who did and those who did not achieve negative fluid balance by day 2 of admission .
multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with icu mortality in the univariate analysis .
survival was assessed using kaplan - meier analysis .
results we studied 87 patients : 53 males , mean age 58 +/ - 18 years , saps ii 39.3 +/ - 15.8 , apache ii score 15.9 +/ - 7.5 , sofa score 5.0 +/ - 3.4 , and icu stay 10.3 +/ - 9.8 days .
the main syndrome diagnosis at admission was septic shock ( n = 26 ) , acute respiratory failure ( n = 19 ) , trauma ( n = 13 ) , neurocritical illness ( n = 14 ) and others ( n = 15 ) .
overall mortality in the icu reached 20.7 % and survival at 28 days was 73.6 % .
when patients were classified according to 28 - day outcome , we observed statistically significant differences in negative fluid balance at 48 hours ( p < 0.001 ) , saps ii ( p < 0.001 ) , apache ii score ( p = 0.007 ) , age ( p = 0.046 ) and incidence of acute kidney injury at admission ( p = 0.02 ; defined as at least risk in rifle criteria ) , but urinary output , hemodynamic and respiratory parameters did not differ .
multivariate analysis showed that negative fluid balance at 48 hours was independently associated with improved survival : odds ratio = 7.9 ( p = 0.013 ) .
kaplan - meier analysis showed that survival was significantly lower in patients without negative fluid balance at 48 hours ( p = 0.015 ) .
conclusion our findings show that negative fluid balance 48 hours after admission may correlate with better outcome in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients .

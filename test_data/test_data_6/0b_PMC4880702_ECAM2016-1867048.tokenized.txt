liver disease is a worldwide problem .
it represents one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in humans .
achillea biebersteinii is used as herbal remedy for various ailments including liver diseases .
but the scientific basis for its medicinal use remains unknown .
thus , this research was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of a. biebersteinii essential oil ( abeo ) ( 0.2 ml / kg ) in the amelioration of ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity in rodent model .
moreover , the chemical content of the oil was investigated using gc and gc - ms. the following biochemical parameters were evaluated : serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( got ) , glutamic - pyruvic transaminase ( gpt ) , gamma - glutamyl - transpeptidase ( gamma - ggt ) , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , and total bilirubin .
furthermore , lipid profile , malondialdehyde ( mda ) , nonprotein sulfhydryl ( np - sh ) , and total protein ( tp ) contents in liver tissue were estimated .
44 components ( 92.0 %) of the total oil have been identified by gc - ms analysis where alpha - terpinene and p - cymene were the most abundant .
the high serum enzymatic ( got , gpt , ggt , and alp ) and bilirubin concentrations as well as the level of mda , np - sh , and tp contents in liver tissues were significantly reinstated towards normalization by the abeo .
histopathological study further confirmed these findings .
in addition , abeo showed mild antioxidant activity in 2,2 - diphenyl - 1 - picrylhydrazyl ( dpph ) radical scavenging and beta - carotene - linoleic acid assays .
1. introduction in human , liver disease which is a worldwide problem is considered one of the most important diseases that cause a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality in all age - groups .
world health organization ( who ) estimated that chronic hepatitis c patients reached approximately 170 million people worldwide and 3 - 4 million people are annually added to that list .
in addition , it is reported that hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) causes annually more than 2 billion infections and over 5 million people are being affected annually .
the available treatment options for liver diseases are predominantly limited in efficiency , have often serious side effects , and are too costly especially for the developing country [ 1 - 3 ] .
the key features of therapeutic agent are a high effectiveness and low threat of side effects .
thus , improvement of novel and more substantial hepatoprotective drugs with minor side effects is obligatory .
many medicinal herbs are showing such characteristics and might represent new active therapeutic drugs .
the genus achillea ( family : asteraceae ) is represented by four species in saudi arabia .
achillea biebersteinii afan. , locally known as " althufra ," is native to the arabian peninsula , including saudi arabia , yemen , and oman , as well as to countries around the mediterranean sea. a. biebersteinii is a perennial herb , 30 to 60 cm high .
the aerial part of the plant is commonly used in the form of decoction by folkloric practitioners for the treatment of several ailments including abdominal pain , wound healing , jaundice , and other liver diseases .
in phytochemical and pharmacological studies , the antibacterial , antifungal , and antioxidant activities of the plant have been reported [ 4 - 6 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , no previous investigation on the protective activity of the essential oil of a. biebersteinii against ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity in rats has been reported .
thus , the current study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of the essential oil on ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity and to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying these protective effects in rats .
moreover , in vitro antioxidant activities were assessed by dpph radical scavenging and beta - carotene linoleic acid assays .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .

estimation of the lipid profile commercial diagnostic kits were used to estimate total cholesterol , triglycerides , high - density lipoproteins ( hdl - c ) , and glucose levels [ 16 - 18 ] .
2.7.5 .
determination of malondialdehyde ( mda ) the protocol explained by utley et al .
[ 19 ] was followed .
potter - elvehjem type c homogenizer was used to homogenize the liver tissues in kcl solution ( 0.15 m ) at 4degreesc to obtain 10 % of tissue ( w / v ) .
metabolic shaker was used to incubate 1 ml of the homogenate at 37degreesc for 3 h. then the homogenate was mixed with 10 % aqueous trichloroacetic acid ( 1 : 1 ) .
the mixture was separated into supernatant and sediment by centrifugation at 800 xg for 10 min .
1 ml of thiobarbituric acid ( 0.67 % in water ) was add to 1 ml of the supernatant and then was placed in water bath at 100degreesc for 10 min .
after cooling , the dilution was done by 1 ml distilled water .
the optical density of the solution was recorded at 535 nm by spectrophotometer and then the concentration of malondialdehyde ( nmol / g wet tissue ) was calculated from a standard curve of malondialdehyde solution .
2.7.6 .
estimation of nonprotein sulfhydryls ( np - sh ) hepatic nonprotein sulfhydryls were estimated according to the assay of sedlak and lindsay [ 20 ] .
homogenization of liver tissue samples was performed in ice - cold ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) ( 0.02 mmol / l ) .
1 ml of 50 % trichloroacetic acid ( tca ) and 4 ml distilled water was added to 5 ml of the homogenate placed in 15 ml test tube .
after shaking for 10 min , the tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm and then 2 ml of supernatant was removed and mixed with 4 ml tris buffer ( 0.4 mol / l , ph 8.9 ) .
the mixture was shaken with 0.1 ml of 5,5 ' - dithio - bis ( 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ) ( dtnb ) for 5 min ; then immediately the optical density at 412 nm was measured by spectrophotometer against a reagent blank .
2.7.7 .
determination of total protein ( tp ) total protein in serum ( g / l ) was determined by colorimetric method using total protein kit cs610 ( crescent diagnostics , jeddah , saudi arabia ) .
the colorimetric assay for determining total protein concentration in serum is based on the chemical reaction between copper ion ( in biuret reagent ) and peptide bonds ( in serum proteins ) in alkaline solution to give a blue / violet color .
tartrate and iodide are added as stabilizer and inhibitor of autoreduction of the alkaline copper complex .
the optical density of the blue / violet colored complex was estimated at 546 nm by short - cut - assay .
the serum total protein was calculated using the following equation : ( 1 ) total protein in serumg / l = abssampleabsstandardxconcentration of standard,where the abssample mean absorbance of sample and absstandard refer to absorbance of standard protein ( g / l ) .
2.7.8 .
histopathological assessment the microsection of liver tissues ( 5 mum thickness ) was produced by american - made optical rotary microtome according to vip tissue processor .

2.8 .
studies of antioxidant activity 2.8.1 .
scavenging activity of dpph radical the antioxidant activity of abeo was evaluated by dpph free radical scavenging assay according to brand - williams et al .
[ 22 ] .
in the presence of an antioxidant , the dpph radicals ( purple color ) turn to reduced dpph ( yellow color ) .
the change of the optical density is recorded by spectrophotometer at 517 nm. five concentrations 10 , 50 , 100 , 500 , and 1000 mug / ml of abeo were prepared .
briefly , the total volume of test mixture containing 500 mul of abeo , 125 mul dpph , and 375 mul solvent was mixed and then incubated at 25degreesc for 30 min .
the change in color was determined at 517 nm by spectrophotometer ( uvmini - 1240 , shimadzu , japan ) .
as positive control in this assay , the known antioxidant ascorbic acid was used .
the radical scavenging activity was measured using the following equation : ( 2 ) radical scavenging activity %= abscontrol - abssampleabscontrolx100 .
2.8.2 .
beta - carotene - linoleic acid assay to determine the antioxidant activities of abeo , the beta - carotene bleaching assay was performed according to mohd - esa et al .
[ 23 ] .
beta - carotene solution ( 0.2 mg / ml ) was prepared with chloroform ; then 1 ml of this solution was added to a solution of 0.2 ml of tween - 20 and 0.02 ml of linoleic acid .
using rotary evaporator the chloroform was removed .
the mixture was diluted with 100 ml of distilled water and mixed for 2 min .
a 5 ml of the mixture was mixed with 0.2 ml of abeo ( 1 mg / ml ) and incubated in a water bath at 40degreesc for 2 h. the optical density was recorded at 470 nm at 15 min intervals , by a uv - visible spectrophotometer ( uvmini - 1240 , shimadzu , japan ) .
rutin was used as a positive control prepared ( 1 mg / ml ) .
the antioxidant activity was estimated using the following equation : ( 3 ) antioxidant activity %= 1 - abs0 - abstabs0degrees - abstdegreesx100,where abs0 and abs0degrees are the optical density values determined at zero time of incubation for abeo and control , respectively .
abst and abstdegrees are the optical density values for abeo and control , respectively , at 120 min .

44 components ( 92.0 %) of the total oil of a. biebersteinii ( abeo ) have been identified by gc - ms analysis .
according to the literature review , nothing was available concerning the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the volatile oil of a. biebersteinii growing in saudi arabia .
the data in table 1 indicated that the monoterpene hydrocarbons content of abeo was high ( 56.3 %) .
the monoterpene hydrocarbons alfa - terpinene and p - cymene were the most abundant compounds and represented 29.2 and 22.9 % , respectively .
moreover , oxygenated monoterpenes accounted for 31.9 % of the total oil , with terpinen - 4 - ol ( 4.7 %) , 1,8 - cineole ( 4.3 %) , trans - p - menth - 2 - en - 1 - ol ( 3.9 %) , ascaridole ( 3.1 %) , trans - piperitone oxide ( 2.5 %) , and carvacrol ( 2.1 %) as the major compounds .
3.2 .
acute toxicity the a. biebersteinii essential oil ( abeo ) at various dose concentrations did not demonstrate any mortality or any pathological symptoms even at the highest dose ( 0.5 ml / kg , p.o. ) .
based on that , one dose ( 0.2 ml / kg ) was chosen for further pharmacological investigations .
3.3 .
effect of abeo on marker enzymes and bilirubin in serum the results of the biochemical indicators of liver function are summarized in table 2 .
administration of ccl4 significantly caused severe hepatotoxicity in rats , as evidenced by the elevation of serum got , gpt , alp , ggt , and bilirubin .
the elevation of the enzymes and bilirubin in serum was significantly diminished in pretreated rat groups with abeo ( 0.2 ml / kg ) as well as with silymarin ( 10 mg / kg ) when compared with the ccl4 only treated group .
3.4 .
effect of abeo on lipid profile as demonstrated in table 3 , ccl4 showed a significant increase in the level of lipid profile in rats .
administration of abeo attenuated significantly the increased level of cholesterol and triglycerides in rats treated by ccl4 compared to the normal control group .

3.5 .
effect of abeo on hepatic mda as presented in figure 1 , the concentration of hepatic mda , a final product of lipid peroxidation , in the rats treated by ccl4 that did not receive abeo was significantly ( p < 0.001 ) high compared to the normal control rats .
interestingly , the rats pretreated with abeo ( 0.2 ml / kg ) caused a significant decrease in the level of mda ( figure 1 ) .
also , similar results were obtained in rats treated with silymarin .
3.6 .
effect of abeo on hepatic np - sh as shown in figure 2 , the decreased level of np - sh in the liver tissues of animals treated with ccl4 was significantly ( p < 0.001 ) lifted by abeo .
the same biological effect was noticed in rats treated with silymarin .
3.7 .
effect of abeo on hepatic tp ccl4 caused significant decrease of the total protein level in group ii ( figure 3 ) .

effect of abeo on histopathological evaluation as demonstrated in figure 4 , the histopathological investigations reinforced the data of the biochemical analysis .
the micrographs of the liver tissues exhibited serious necrosis and focal hepatic cellular decay of the lobules in rats treated by ccl4 comparing with normal control rates .
basically normal hepatocytes and central vein were observed in the rats treated with abeo ( 0.2 ml / kg ) .
in addition , liver tissues of rats treated with silymarin exhibited normal central vein , sinusoids hepatocytes ( figure 4 ) .
3.9 .
antioxidant activity of abeo as shown in table 4 , abeo demonstrated a moderate radical scavenging activity particularly at the highest levels of 500 and 1000 mug / ml ( 42 and 58 %) whereas ascorbic acid exhibited a strong activity ( 92 and 94 %) .
furthermore , table 4 showed the antioxidant activity , dependent on the beta - carotene bleaching rate of the abeo .
the observed antioxidant activity of abeo was moderate ( 53 %) in comparison to that of rutin ( 91 %) .
4. discussion in this research , we investigated the chemical composition and in vivo hepatoprotective and in vitro antioxidant activity of the volatile oil of achillea biebersteinii ( abeo ) .
to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first investigation of abeo potential to ameliorate hepato - toxicity induced by ccl4 .
our findings that suggest alpha - terpinene ( 29 %) and p - cymene ( 23 %) as main constituents of the essential oil ( abeo ) in our study are in agreement with an earlier study on a. biebersteinii collected from east azerbaijan , iran , where alpha - terpinene ( 41 %) and p - cymene ( 13 %) were the major components [ 24 ] .
other reports on the chemical composition of a. biebersteinii essential oil from turkey and iran showed a main chemotype which is characterized by the presence of 1,8 - cineole ( 9 - 37 %) and camphor ( 16 - 30 %) as major components [ 4 , 25 , 26 ] .
moreover , the gc - ms analysis of the oil of a. biebersteinii collected from sivas in turkey has resulted in the identification of piperitone ( 35 %) and eucalyptol ( 13 %) as the main components [ 6 ] .
sokmen et al .
[ 6 ] attributed the richness of these monoterpenes to the collection of the plant material during flowering period .
however , we assume that the variation in the chemical composition could be attributed to several factors including the geographical origin , environmental factors in saudi arabia , genetic type , and development stage .
previous biological and pharmacological studies on a. biebersteinii demonstrated that the essential oil as well as the crude extract have antibacterial , antifungal , insecticidal , and antioxidant activities [ 4 , 6 , 26 ] .
moreover , akkol et al .
[ 27 ] reported remarkable wound healing activity .
recent studies on a. biebersteinii recorded antileishmanial as well as protective and therapeutic effects against gastric ulcer [ 28 , 29 ] .
in an endeavor to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of abeo , ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity model was undertaken in this investigation .
ccl4 is a well - known and commonly used chemical to promote liver injury .
the mechanism of ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity is basically mediated through certain free radical reactions [ 30 ] .
the toxicity with ccl4 exists in its metabolic biotransformation by cytochrome p450 system in liver tissues to give two reactive free radicals , namely , trichloromethyl ( ccl3 .) and trichloromethylperoxy ( ccl3oo. ) , which initiate lipid peroxidation process and decrease activities of antioxidant enzyme levels [ 31 - 33 ] .
in the current study , ccl4 caused a significant increase in the serum marker enzymes ( got , gpt , ggt , and alp ) and bilirubin indicating a wide disturbance in structure and function of liver cells .
the results showed that administration of abeo as well as silymarin significantly restored that pathological increase of these enzymes and indicate a hepatoprotective effect against ccl4 - induced liver damage .
our findings are in agreement with the result demonstrated by dadkhah et al .
[ 34 ] for the hepatoprotective effect of the essential oil of a. wilhelmsii , which showed a modulation of the increased enzyme markers .
in addition , our results were consistent with the reported results on a. millefolium extract by yaeesh et al .
[ 35 ] who demonstrated a decrease of the enzyme levels , for example , alt and ast , in treated animal groups compared with the control suggesting a hepatoprotective activity for a. millefolium .
surprisingly our findings were unlike the results reported on the ethanol extract of a. biebersteinii [ 36 ] .
on the contrary , the ethanol extract of a. biebersteinii induced an increase in ast and alt in a dose - dependent manner [ 36 ] .
in addition to that , our results showed a noticeable increase in malondialdehyde ( mda ) level in liver tissues by ccl4 indicating enhancement of lipid peroxidation ( lpo ) which is an essential pathogenic cause for tissue damage [ 37 ] .
mda is an end product of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and is used as a marker of lpo , which takes place in liver toxicity due to the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 37 , 38 ] .
a significant decrease of mda level was observed in rats , which were treated with abeo and silymarin .
probably abeo protects the liver cells by prevention of the generation of free radical species and so the decreasing of lipid peroxidation mediated by ccl4 [ 39 ] .
another indicator of hepatotoxicity is the consumption of nonprotein sulfhydryl ( np - sh ) content of the liver tissues which could induce further damage and dysfunction of liver [ 38 ] .
abeo as well as silymarin increased significantly the level of np - sh in liver tissues indicating a hepatoprotective effect in the treated animals .
moreover , the depletion of total protein ( tp ) has been shown to be an indicator for oxidative stress and liver toxicity .
ccl4 significantly induced a decrease of total protein ( tp ) in ccl4 - treated animals indicating hepatotoxicity .
restoring the levels of tp by abeo and silymarin denotes a reduction of oxidative stress and thus hepatoprotective effect .
beside the hepatoprotective activity , abeo showed a relatively moderate in vitro dpph radical scavenging and antioxidant activity .
our results are in agreement with earlier data published by sokmen et al .
[ 6 ] , who indicated antioxidant activity for the oil .
in general , both effects ( hepatoprotective and antioxidative effects ) might be in relation to each other .
5. conclusions in conclusion , by evaluation of the in vivo hepatoprotective and in vitro antioxidant effects of a. biebersteinii essential oil ( abeo ) , it has been found that abeo showed significant protection against ccl4 - induced liver injury , as well as dose - dependent antioxidant activity .
the present results confirm a beneficial association between the hepatoprotective effectiveness and the antioxidant activity of the abeo and support its use in liver disorders by folk medicine practitioners .

immune recovery after profound lymphopenia is a major challenge in many clinical situations , such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - hsct ) .
recovery depends , in a first step , on hematopoietic lymphoid progenitors production in the bone marrow ( bm ) .
in this study , we characterized cd34 + lin - cd10 + lymphoid progenitors in the peripheral blood of allo - hsct patients .
our data demonstrate a strong recovery of this population 3 months after transplantation .
this rebound was abolished in patients who developed acute graft - versus - host disease ( agvhd ) .
a similar recovery profile was found for both cd24 + and cd24 - progenitor subpopulations .
cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - lymphoid progenitors sorted from allo - hsct patients preserved their t cell potentiel according to in vitro t - cell differentiation assay and the expression profile of 22 genes involved in t - cell differentiation and homing .
cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells from patients without agvhd had reduced cxcr4 gene expression , consistent with an enhanced egress from the bm .
ccr7 gene expression was reduced in patients after allo - hsct , as were its ligands ccl21 and ccl19 .
this reduction was particularly marked in patients with agvhd , suggesting a possible impact on thymic homing .
thus , the data presented here identify this population as an important early step in t cell reconstitution in humans and so , an important target when seeking to enhance immune reconstitution .

introduction in many clinical situations , such as intensive chemotherapy , acquired immunodeficiencies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - hsct ) , immune recovery is a major challenge .
allo - hsct is used to treat malignant and nonmalignant blood diseases , and remains the most widely used regenerative therapy .
accordingly , the profound and long - lasting immunodeficiency following this treatment leads to an increased risk of infection or relapse .
complete rescue of immune competence is closely linked to the recovery of de novo t - cell production in the thymus .
this is a slow process depending on many factors , including patient age , disease status , source and composition of graft , type of conditioning , whether the donor is related or unrelated , human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) mismatches , and the occurrence of graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) [ 1 ] .
the thymus is the primary lymphoid organ responsible for t lymphocyte generation throughout life , its role is essential for post - lymphopenia reconstitution [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
two murine models have recently challenged the view that thymus function is exclusively dependent on the supply of bone marrow ( bm ) - derived progenitors [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
however , these studies involved animals with a defective functional progenitor supply .
in human clinical situations , apart from with congenital t - cell immunodeficiencies , lymphoid progenitors are available .
thus , in most settings , t - cell immune reconstitution relies on the generation of lymphoid progenitors in the bm , their homing to the thymus for t - cell commitment and intrathymic differentiation .
despite increasing knowledge of the hierarchy of hematopoietic lineage determination in humans [ 7 ] , no study has yet characterized lymphoid progenitors in the context of immune reconstitution in humans .
six et al .
[ 8 ] characterized two progenitor populations : cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells , with a very low myeloid potential capable of giving rise to b , t and nk lymphocytes ; and cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 + cells , which are already committed to the b - cell lineage .
the cd24 - population may represent thymus - seeding progenitors ( tsp ) .
it is found in cord blood ( cb ) , bm , thymus and , importantly , it is detectable in peripheral blood throughout life .
these cells express low levels of cd38 and may correspond to the multilymphoid progenitor population ( mlp ) described by doulatov et al .
[ 9 ] .
mlps are defined by their potential to give rise to b cells , t - cells and nk cells .
in most cases , they also retain some potential towards the granulo - monocytic and dendritic cell lineages .
more recently , data from gene expression profiles and functional analysis have shown that , in human bm , cd10 - cd62lhi progenitors are developmental intermediates between the multipotent cd34 + lin - cd38 - population and the lymphoid progenitor , or cd34 + lin - cd10 + , population [ 10 ] .
however , this study did not distinguish between cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - progenitors and the more prevalent b - cell - committed cd24 + population .
the relationship between cd10 - cd62lhi and tsp remains to be elucidated .
in allo - hsct , t - cell reconstitution in patients is impaired during acute gvhd ( agvhd ) .
this disease could target the bm niche and hamper hematopoietic progenitor generation , tsp homing to the thymus , and even thymic function itself .
in experimental murine models , agvhd has been linked to both a reduction in thymic cellularity and destruction of the thymic architecture [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
in the thymus , stromal and epithelial cells produce growth factors locally , as well as cytokines essential for thymocyte survival such as interleukin ( il ) - 7 , stem cell factor ( scf ) , and flt3l ; or chemokines involved in t - cell precursor homing such as c - c chemokine ligand ( ccl ) 19 , ccl21 and ccl25 .
in addition to thymic gvhd , murine models revealed the existence of an early bm gvhd , where the osteoblastic hematopoietic niche is targeted [ 14 ] .
therefore , agvhd could reduce the number of multipotent precursor cells periodically released from the bm and migrating to the thymus .
indeed , zlotoff et al .
[ 15 ] showed that , in mice , a limited supply of hematopoietic progenitors to the thymus may impair t - cell recovery after allo - hsct .
in humans , we have shown that agvhd transiently impairs thymic output in young patients after allo - hsct [ 16 ] .
agvhd affected t - cell differentiation prior to tcr beta - chain recombination , as shown by a decrease in t - cell receptor ( tcr ) beta - chain rearrangement circles ( trec ) in peripheral blood .
t - cell progenitors have , as yet , to be characterized during t - cell recovery after allo - hsct , and the consequences of agvhd examined .
this could help to better define which steps should be targeted to optimize t - cell immune reconstitution in immune compromised patients .
this article presents a snapshot analysis of cells between the time when they leave the bm and when the thymus is seeded .
for the first time in humans and despite their very small number , we have characterized the recovery of circulating lymphoid progenitors , particularly the cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - population , in patients after allo - hsct .
we show that their quantitative recovery at 3 months post - transplant is affected by agvhd and associated with downregulation of cxcr4 expression .
patients and methods patient characteristics the study population consisted of 107 patients who received a non - t - cell - depleted allogeneic hsct at the bone marrow transplantation unit , hopital saint - louis ( paris , france ) between february 2002 and august 2012 .
details on patients , donors and graft characteristics , as well as on transplantation outcome , are reported in table 1 .
acute gvhd was diagnosed and graded according to published criteria [ 17 ] .
nine of the 59 patients with grade 0 - i agvhd and 43 of the 48 patients with grade ii - iv agvhd were treated with corticosteroids .
no significant difference was found between patient groups for sex ratio , gvh ( 0 , i vs. ii , iii , iv ) , age , pb / bm , ric ( reduced intensity conditioning )/ mac ( myeloablative conditioning ) and diagnosis before allo - hsct .
almost all patient were full donor chimera at month 3 as assesed by microsatellite analysis and only 1 patient had cells less than 92 % of donor origin .
seventy - nine out of 107 patients were monitored for immune reconstitution by lymphocyte phenotyping and sjtrec content .
because of the small number of progenitor cells , different groups of patients were studied in the subsequent experiments : 39 for flow cytometry analysis , 22 for pcr analysis , 6 in op9 - deltal1 co - culture and 40 to quantify plasma analytes .
peripheral blood samples ( up to 25 ml ) were collected at 3 months after transplant .
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were separated on lymphocyte separation medium and either sorted immediately or frozen in fetal calf serum ( fcs ) , 10 % dmso for phenotypic analysis .
as control , peripheral blood samples from healthy donors ( hd ) ( n = 46 ) and cord blood ( n = 8 ) were obtained from the hopital saint - louis transfusion center and cord blood bank , respectively .
these samples were treated according to the same protocols as patient samples .
no significant difference was found between patients and hd in terms of age and sex ratio .
the investigation was approved by the committee on medical ethics of the hopital saint - louis , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .

flow cytometry analysis all antibodies were from bd biosciences , unless otherwise indicated .
pbmc were thawed and at least 2x106 cells were stained with monoclonal mouse anti - human cd34 - allophycocyanin ( apc ; 8g12 ) , monoclonal mouse anti - human cd24 - fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ; ml5 ) and monoclonal mouse anti - human cd10 - phycoerythrin cyanine 7 ( pe - cy7 ; hi10a ) .
the lineage ( lin ) pe - conjugated antibody cocktail contained antibodies against cd2 ( rpa - 2.10 ) , cd3 ( ucht1 ) , cd4 ( rpa - t4 ) , cd8 ( rpa - t8 ) , cd13 ( wm15 ) , cd14 ( m5e2 ) , cd15 ( hi98 ) , cd16 ( 3g8 ) , cd19 ( hib19 ) , cd20 ( 2h7 ) , cd33 ( wm53 ) , cd56 ( b159 ) , and cd235a ( ga - r2 ) .
cells were also stained with live / dead fixable dead cell stain ( aqua - fluorescent reactive dye , invitrogen ) .
absolute numbers of total lymphocytes were determined using bd trucount tubes .
for immune reconstitution analysis , pbmc were thawed and stained with cd4 - peridinin chlorophyll protein ( percp ) , cd45ra - pe , cd19 - pe , cd62l - fitc ( beckman coulter ) and cd27 ( pharmingen ) .
stained cells were analyzed on a facs canto ii running with facs diva software ( bd biosciences ) .
absolute counts of cd34 - lin - cd10 + cd24 - and cd34 - lin - cd10 + cd24 + cells were determined using the lymphocyte count .
data were analyzed for statistical significance by non - parametric mann - whitney test and spearman correlation test .
sjtrec quantification pbmcs were separated on lymphocyte separation medium ( eurobio , les ulis , france ) , and 5 to 10x106 cells were lysed and stored in trireagent ( molecular research center , cincinnati , oh ) .
rna and genomic dna were then extracted from samples in line with manufacturer 's instructions .
sjtrec were quantified by real - time quantitative pcr ( abi prism7700 ; applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) as described [ 16 ] .
values were normalized for the genomic copy number , based on albumin gene quantification .
data were expressed per 150 000 pbmc , or the total number of trec per cubic millimeter of blood was calculated using the absolute cell counts determined using the trucount system .
cell sorting edta blood tubes were collected , and pbmcs were separated on lymphocyte separation medium .
cd34 + cells were enriched using cd34 microbead kit ( macs , miltenyi biotec ) before staining for flow cytometry analysis as described above .
the cd34 - fraction was counted and frozen in fcs , 10 % dmso or lysed in trireagent .
the stained cd34 + fraction was sorted on a facs aria ( bd biosciences ) to isolate cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells .
up to 400 cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells and cd34 + lin - cd10 - were collected in 1.5 ml tubes containing 60 mul of rlt buffer for multiplex pcr analysis or cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells were sorted and seeded at 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 100 cells on op9 - hdelta1 - coated 96 - well plates for limiting dilution assay .
in vitro t - cell differentiation limiting dilution assay t lymphoid potential was tested by plating candidate progenitors on op9 stromal cells .
the stromal cells were transduced with a replication - defective retrovirus containing a double cassette expressing the human notch ligand delta1 ( hdelta1 ) and gfp [ 8 ] .
all cocultures were performed in complete medium ( alphamem ( gibco , invitrogen ) supplemented with 20 % fcs hyclone ( thermoscientific ) , 1 % penicillin , 1 % streptomycin , 5 ng / ml flt3l , 10 ng / ml scf and 2 ng / ml il - 7 ( all from r & d systems )) .
after 3 weeks , wells containing cd5 + cd7 + cells were identified by flow cytometry .
data are presented as the percentage of negative wells against the log10 of the initial number of cells plated per well .
the proportion of lymphoid precursors was calculated by linear regression based on a poisson distribution .
data were analyzed for statistical significance using a non - parametric mann - whitney test .
for ethical and methodological reasons , patients with severe agvhd could not be tested .
patient blood samples measured 30 - 35 ml , whereas hd provided 100 ml. the high volume of blood from healthy donors compensated the low frequency of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells .
in patients without agvhd , the higher frequency of these cells permitted us to sort them despite the small amount of blood .
in patient with severe agvhd their lower frequency associated with the small amount of blood could not allow us to sort enough cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells for the assay .
quantitative real - time pcr after cell sorting , up to 400 cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - and cd34 + lin - cd10 - were lysed in trireagent .
samples were used to extract rna according to manufacturer 's instructions .
rna was reverse transcribed ( with random hexamers ) and amplified ( with specific primer , table s1 ) using a geneamp rna pcr kit ( applied biosystems ) .
for this amplification , the genes studied were split into two groups : ccr7 , ccr9 , cxcr4 , cd44 , itgalpha4 , psgl1 and rpl27 in the first one ; and notch1 , hes1 , ckit , il7ralpha , cd3epsilon , cd4 , cd8b , cd38 , gata3 , ikaros , rag1 , rorc , cmyb , ebf1 , gata1 , lmo2 and rpl27 in the other .
quantitative amplification was performed for each gene in sybr green on a 7500 fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
the same primer couple was used for multiplex amplification and simplex real - time pcr .
data were expressed as expression relative to the rpl27 housekeeping gene , and analyzed for statistical significance by a non - parametric mann - whitney test and using principal component analysis ( pca ) on spss .
pca is a mathematical procedure that attempts to explain as much of the total variation in the data set using as few factors ( principle components ) as possible .
quantification of cytokine and chemokine concentration plasma was collected from edta blood samples .
ccl25 concentration was determined with a human ccl25 / teck duoset elisa ( r & d system ) .
il - 7 concentration was determined using quantikine hs elisa human il - 7 ( r & d system ) .
plates were read on a biochrom anthos zenyth 340 s. sdf - 1alpha + beta , 6ckine ( ccl21 ) and ccl19 concentrations were determined with milliplex map kit human cytokine / chemokine panel ii and iii ( millipore ) .
plates were read on a labscan 100 ( luminex ) .
all analytes were measured in plasma from 20 hd and 40 patients 3 months after hsct ( including 20 with grade ii to iv agvhd ) .
data were analyzed by non - parametric mann - whitney test .
results circulating lymphoid progenitor rebound after allo - hsct in humans is decreased by agvhd naive t - cell reconstitution was analyzed in a cohort of 79 patients ( see patients and methods and table 1 ) using flow cytometry to track cd4 + cd45ra + cd62l + cells ; thymic output was measured by quantitative pcr for sjtrec .
as we reported previously [ 16 ] , patients with grade ii to iv agvhd showed a decreased reconstitution at 3 and 6 months after allo - hsct .
we also observed a delay in naive cd19 + cd27 - b - cell reconstitution with agvhd ( fig. 1a ) .
based on these observations , month 3 was chosen as the best time point at which to assess the cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - population after allo - hsct .

( a ) naive t - cell and b - cell immune recovery was measured by cd4 + cd45ra + cd62l + and cd19 + cd27 - staining and flow cytometry analysis and thymic output was determined by quantitative pcr for sjtrec in 79 patients with ( closed circles ) and without ( open circles ) agvhd from time pre - hsct to m12 ( 12 months post - hsct ) .

( spearman test ).** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05 , ns : not significant ( mann - whitney ) .
circulating progenitors were quantified by flow cytometry in a subgroup of 39 allo - hsct patients , in 19 age - matched healthy donors ( hd ) , and in 8 cord blood ( cb ) samples ( fig. s1 ) .
median percentage and absolute number of cd34 + were 0.131 % cd34 +/ living cells , range [ 0.007 - 0.909 ] and 1.4 cd34 +/ blood mm3 , range [ 0.1 a 16 ] , respectively .
no differences were found between patients and hd in terms of frequency for either cd34 + or cd34 + lin - cells ( data not shown ) .
lymphoid progenitors characterized as cd34 + lin - cd10 + cells could be detected throughout the postnatal period [ 8 ] .
they have a very limited myeloid potential when cultured on ms5 stromal cells or in methylcellulose colony formation assay ( data not shown ) .
the percentage of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cells within the cd34 + lin - population was not significantly different between cb , hd or allo - hsct patients (% cd34 + lin - cd10 +/ cd34 + lin - = 7 [ 0 - 58 ] and cd34 + lin - cd10 +/ blood mm3 = 0.03 [ 0.00 - 0.36 ]) .
however , the percentage of these cells was very variable among patients ( fig. 1b ) .
indeed , patients without agvhd or with grade i agvhd had a significantly higher proportion of cd34 + lin - cd10 +/ cd34 + lin - cells than patients with agvhd grade ii , iii or iv ( p = 0.024 ) or hd ( p = 0.033 ) ( fig. 1c ) .
a cd24 + b - cell - restricted subpopulation and a cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - subset can be distinguished within the postnatal cd34 + lin - cd10 + progenitor population based on cd24 expression [ 8 ] .
in our samples , the cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 + subpopulation was found in cb , but was extremely rare in peripheral blood , detectable in only 5 out of the 19 hd samples .
in patients at 3 months after hsct without agvhd , we observed a rebound of both cd24 - and cd24 + progenitor subpopulations with a significant increase in their percentages reaching values above hd ( fig. 1d ) .
absolute cell counts showed that the number of t / b / nk ( cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - ) and b - cell committed ( cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 +) progenitors decreased with increasing agvhd severity ( fig. s2 ) .
six months after transplantation , the median number of both cd24 + and cd24 - subsets had decreased ( fig. 1e ) .
importantly , examining other pre - transplant parameters usually associated with agvhd , no effect of recipients' age or conditioning regimen on cd34 + lin - cd10 + , cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - and cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 + counts was observed .
the source of grafted cells ( bm or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells ) had a mild impact on cd34 + lin - cd10 + and cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cell numbers , but in multivariate analysis including age , source of cells , and conditioning regimen , agvhd was the only significant factor identified ( p = 0.022 and p = 0.034 , table 2 ) .
also , the grafted cd34 + cells dose is predictive of survival , posttransplant morbidity , and rate of hematologic recovery after allo - hsct [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
accordingly , in our study , there was a significant correlation between the number of cd34 + cells in the graft and the number of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells in peripheral blood at 3 months .
this correlation was not seen in presence of severe agvhd ( fig. 1f ) , suggesting that severe allogeneic bm reactions affect the supply of lymphoid progenitors to the periphery .
in addition , another correlation was found between absolute numbers of b - cell - committed cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 + progenitors at 3 months and total cd19 + cells , as well as naive cd19 + cd27 - b cells at 6 months after allo - hsct ( p = 0.014 and p = 0.014 respectively , fig. 1g ) .
this correlation was also only significant in the absence of agvhd .
overall , at 3 months after allo - hsct , we observed that the rebound of circulating lymphoid progenitors was abrogated in patients presenting severe agvhd .

cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - progenitors display functional features of t - cell progenitors after allo - hsct the next step was to ensure that this increased circulating progenitor population detected after transplantation was truly t cell committed .
to this aim , cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - from hd and patients without agvhd were sorted and cultivated on the op9 - dl1 stromal cell line in the presence of flt3l , il - 7 and scf to check their t - cell differentiation potential [ 20 ] .
cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells from patients with severe agvhd could not be assessed in this assay due to the small volume of blood (< 25 ml ) available for ethical reasons .
in both hd and patients , facs sorted cells effectively gave rise to t - cells in this system .
using limiting dilution , we found a similar frequency of t - cell progenitor between hd ( mean = 1 / 19.3 ; n = 5 ) and patients without agvhd ( mean = 1 / 12.4 ; n = 6 ) ( fig. 2a ) .
in conclusion , the rebound of circulating cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells at 3 months after hsct was accompanied by a sustained t - cell potential .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0091492.g002 figure 2 cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - progenitors display functional features of t - cell progenitors after allo - hsct .
( a ) limiting dilution assay analysis on op9 - dl1 with cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells sorted from peripheral blood of healthy donors ( hd ) and at day 100 post allo - hsct in patients without agvhd , or with grade i agvhd ( gr 0 - 1 ) .
ns : not significant ( mann - whitney ) .
( b ) principal component analysis ( pca ) of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - ( circles ) , cd34 + lin - cd10 - cells ( squares ) and cd34 - cells ( triangles ) from 11 hd and 21 allo - hsct patients using a panel of 22 genes ( see materiel & methods ) .
( c ) pca of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - from healthy donors ( hd , open circles ) or patients with ( green filled circles ) or without severe agvhd ( red filled circles ) .
the gene expression profile was then assessed in two multiplex assays .
genes implicated in progenitor t cell differentiation , 22 genes in total , were screened using a quantitative gene expression method on very limited cell numbers [ 21 ] .
the 22 genes analyzed were : the chemokine receptors ccr7 and ccr9 ; cxcr4 , a chemokine receptor which plays a role in progenitor egress from the bm ; cd44 , itgalpha4 and psgl1 , adhesion molecules particularly involved in adhesion between progenitor and thymic cells [ 22 ] ; the cytokine receptors il7ralpha and ckit ; actors of the notch pathway , notch1 and hes1 ; several transcription factors preferentially found in stem cells ( lmo2 , cmyb ) , progenitors of b cells ( ebf1 ) , t - cells ( gata3 , rorc , ikaros ) or erythroid cells ( gata1 ) and finally some markers of the t lineage such as cd3epsilon , cd4 , cd8 , cd38 and rag1 .
cells from 22 patients and 11 hd were isolated by facs , then the real - time pcr gene expression median value for cd34 + lin - cd10 - cells was compared to that for cd34 + lin - cd10 - cells as a control of non - lymphoid primed progenitors , and to that for cd34 - cells ( table s2 ) .
global gene expression was displayed using principal component analysis ( pca ) which factorizes the total variability in gene expression .
this analysis efficiently discriminated between cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - and the two other cell subpopulations ( fig. 2b ) .
according to pca , cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells from hd and patients with or without agvhd clustered together ( fig. 2c ) .
thus , both in vitro differentiation on op9 - dl1 stromal cells and gene expression profiling showed the cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - population have an effective t - cell potential in the context of allo - hsct .
cxcr4 and cxcl12 expression profiles are consistent with progenitor egress from the bone marrow and are altered in agvhd to get a further mechanistic insight into the cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - increase , we examined the expression levels of genes involved in progenitor mobilization and homing , and the levels of chemokines in the plasma .
we first studied the cxcr4 / cxcl12 axis which plays an important role in retaining hsc and progenitors in the bm [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
our results for patients without agvhd showed a significant reduction in cxcr4 mrna expression levels in cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells .
plasma cxcl12 concentration was also reduced in all patients .
this is consistent with disruption of cxcl12 / cxcr4 signaling and release of lymphoid progenitors into the periphery ( fig. 3a ) .
patients with severe agvhd have significantly lower plasma cxcl12 levels than patients without agvhd ( fig. 3a ) due to a reduced production or a higher destruction rate of the chemokine .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0091492.g003 figure 3 allo - hsct and agvhd effects on cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - cells gene expression and plasma concentrations of chemokines and cytokines are associated with alterations to bm egress , thymic homing and t - cell commitment .

* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 , ns : not significant ( mann - whitney ) .
thymic homing and t - cell commitment could be altered after allo - hsct , especially with severe agvhd several molecules have been shown to play a role in thymus colonization in mice .
these include ccr7 and its ligand ( ccl19 / 21 ) , ccr9 and its ligand ( ccl25 ) [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , and psgl1 [ 27 ] .
in humans , the mechanisms of thymus colonization have been less studied , but similar chemokines may be involved , at least during the fetal and perinatal periods [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 28 ] .
in our study , whereas psgl1 expression was not modified ( data not shown ) , ccr7 and ccr9 mrna expression was reduced after allo - hsct , even in the absence of agvhd .
the plasma concentration of the ccr9 ligand , ccl25 , was not modified .
conversely , ccl19 and ccl21 concentrations were significantly reduced in patients after allo - hsct .
ccl19 was further reduced in patients presenting severe agvhd ( fig. 3b ) .
the majority of t - cell commitment markers ( cd3epsilon , ikaros , rag1 ) were not modified by allo - hsct or gvhd .
il7 serum concentration is reported as maximum right after the transplant conditioning regimen and il7 level at days + 7 , + 14 [ 29 ] or + 30 [ 30 ] has been associated with agvhd incidence .
however , in this study at day + 90 , gata - 3 and il - 7ralpha mrna expression , together with il7 plasma concentrations , were significantly reduced in all patients compared to hd. these changes were independent of agvhd status ( fig 3c ) .
discussion the initial report of a rebound in thymic activity after intensive chemotherapy in children [ 31 ] has been extended to other settings in adults including autologous [ 32 ] and allogeneic [ 3 ] hsct and appears to be crucial in the regeneration of peripheral t - cell populations .
thymic - dependent t - cell reconstitution is a slow process after allo - hsct in humans which can be evaluated phenotypically , by trec quantification and tcr diversity analysis [ 4 ] .
immune recovery is further impeded in humans during the agvhd immune reaction [ 1 ] .
whereas the impact of agvhd on thymic function has been documented [ 16 ] , there is no data yet on the characteristics of lymphoid progenitors in the condition of human allo - hsct and agvhd .
our findings show in humans that immune reconstitution needs to be considered in a global perspective integrating progenitor supply by the bone marrow and , for t cells , their competence in thymic homing and t - cell differentiation .
it seems striking to us that the circulating progenitors rebound we detected 3 months after transplantation was concomitant to the reduced cxcr4 expression in these cells and to a decreased cxcl12 plasmatic concentration .
cxcl12 , or stromal cell - derived factor 1a ( sdf - 1a ) , is constitutively produced at high levels in the bm by stromal cells where it maintains hsc in a quiescent state .
it is also required for their retention in the bm [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
disruption of the interaction between cxcl12 and its receptor , cxcr4 , results in the mobilization of cells from the bm and their release into the blood .
cxcr4 antagonists , in particular amd3100 , have been used to mobilize hscs for hsct in humans [ 33 ] .
disruption of cxcl12 / cxcr4 signaling is also a key step in hsc mobilization by g - csf [ 34 ] , [ 35 ]. this lead us to suspect a causative role of cxcr4 / cxcl12 in the lymphoid progenitors rebound during the profound lymphopenia observed after allo - hsct. whether this could apply to other situations of lymphopenia and myelosuppression , during intensive chemotherapy for instance , will deserve further studies .
in the bm , cxcl12 is produced by osteoblast precursors and cxcl12 - abundant reticular cells ( car ) , a stromal perivascular population involved in hsc and b lymphoid progenitor maintenance [ 23 ] .
some recent evidence in mice indicates that early lymphoid progenitors occupy a distinct endosteal niche not shared by hsc [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
acute gvhd may alter this microenvironment and the capacity to produce cxcl12 .
in line with this , in a murine model , osteoblasts were found to be the main target of agvhd in bm [ 14 ] .
cxcl12 degradation could also explain the reduced levels of this chemokine in the periphery , especially with severe agvhd , as cxcl12 is extremely sensitive to proteolysis [ 35 ] .
we believe that , in the absence of agvhd , low cxcl12 levels favor proliferation and egress of committed progenitors from the bm as part of a regenerative mechanism to correct for lymphopenia .
this hypothesis is supported by murine models of myelosuppression [ 24 ] .
in patients presenting agvhd , due to stromal injury and possibly also to therapies such as corticosteroids , a further decrease of cxcl12 , together with disruption of the bm niche , could alter this process [ 38 ] .
however , patient with grade i agvhd that do n't receive corticosteroid , had already less progenitor cells than patients without agvhd ( fig. s2 ) , arguing for a direct effect of the disease .
a second finding was the potential limitations in thymus seeding properties of cd34 + lin - cd10 + cd24 - progenitors in allo - hsct and especially agvhd .
together with the pronounced decrease in ccr7 expression , reduced plasma levels of ligands , especially ccl19 , could further impede progenitor homing to the thymus .
in the thymus , ccl19 and ccl21 have been detected in the medulla , the corticomedullary junction and in several cell types scattered throughout the cortex .
ccl19 expression is widely associated with blood vessels [ 39 ] and with the vascular endothelium , lymphocyte migration to peripheral lymphoid organs being dependant on this molecule .
the reduced ccl19 expression observed with gvhd could indicate alterations of the thymic epithelium and / or the vascular endothelium [ 40 ] .
we also showed defects in t - cell commitment potential after allo - hsct .
gata - 3 is required for early t lineage progenitor development and probably controls the differentiation of tsp into early thymic progenitors [ 41 ] .
il - 7 plays critical and non - redundant roles in both t - cell lymphopoiesis and in maintaining and restoring peripheral t - cell homeostasis and early t - cell development [ 42 ] .
these data together suggest that the homing properties of tsp to the thymus and their t - cell differentiation potential may be limited after allo - hsct in adults , and that this limitation may be further enhanced in agvhd .
in total , we show in humans a physiological rebound of circulating lymphoid progenitors after allo - hsct .
this rebound is impaired by agvhd supporting bm stromal injury as the initial mechanism impacting immune recovery .
in terms of therapeutic consequences , attempts should be made to protect the bm stromal microenvironment , and especially the endosteal niches where early lymphoid progenitors are found [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
radiation - resistant myeloid cells , by limiting ros production , may play a protective role in this zone under stress condition [ 43 ] .
finally , cellular therapy approaches have been developed to bypass the delivery of lymphoid progenitors from the bm by using adoptive transfer of in vitro - generated t - cell progenitors [ 44 ] .
however , these approaches may also be hampered by an altered thymic environment when used in clinical settings .

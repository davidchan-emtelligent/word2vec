objective the study aimed to investigate affective responses to 18 - h fasting in healthy controls .
in particular , the study focused on self - reported mood , irritability , sense of achievement , reward , pride , and control .
method participants were a non - clinical sample of 52 women with a mean age of 25 .
a repeated - measures design was used , whereby participants provided diary measures of psychological variables throughout both 18 - h fasting and non - fasting periods .
results fasting led to increased irritability , and also to positive affective experiences of increased sense of achievement , reward , pride , and control .
discussion even short - term fasting in healthy controls can lead to positive psychological experiences .
this lends support to cognitive - behavioral and cognitive - interpersonal models of anr , which suggest that dietary restriction is maintained through positive reinforcement .
healthy individuals fasting starvation psychology emotions introduction by definition , individuals with anorexia nervosa ( an ) severely restrict their food intake , which can be seen as a mixture of both short - term food deprivation and chronic malnourishment ( 1 , 2 ) .
while short - term fasting in healthy individuals has significant differences from the chronic calorie deprivation seen in an , fasting in healthy participants can offer some clues to the cognitive and emotional changes in an ( 3 , 4 ) .
there is limited research into the psychological effects of starvation in healthy individuals , however , existing research has mainly focused on negative affective and cognitive changes , such as increased anxiety and irritability and poorer concentration ( 5 - 7 ) , and increased rigidity and obsessionality ( 5 ) .
interestingly , studies have indicated that unintentional weight loss can trigger an ( 8 , 9 ) .
this points toward the possibility that starvation itself may have an impact on the development or maintenance of an ( 10 ) .
several models of the development and treatment of an inherently assume that dietary restriction leads to positive affective experiences .
the cognitive - behavioral model posits that an is maintained , in part , by positive reinforcement from successful restriction [ for example , ref. ( 11 - 14 )] .
other models , for example , schmidt and treasure ( 15 ) cognitive - interpersonal approach , also incorporate positive experiences as a result of dietary restriction as important maintaining factors in an. however , no studies in healthy individuals have as yet focused on the possible positive emotional consequences of fasting in experimentally induced starvation .
the current study and hypotheses the study aimed to investigate individual responses to short - term fasting .
the study aimed to determine whether fasting would lead to increases in measures of positive mood , reward , hunger , irritability , achievement , pride , and self - control .
due to the scarcity of literature on the psychological consequences of fasting , no directional hypotheses were made .
materials and methods participants participants were 52 female volunteers with a mean age of 25.52 years ( range 18 - 56 ) .
participants were eligible if they were healthy , female , aged over 18 , and spoke fluent english .
exclusion criteria included current diagnosis of an eating disorder ( ed ) , pregnancy , or knowingly having any medical condition that would make fasting dangerous , such as diabetes .
the largest ethnic group in the sample was chinese ( n = 15 , 28.8 %) , followed by white other ( n = 11 , 21.1 %) , white british ( n = 8 , 15.4 %) , and other ( n = 7 , 13.5 %) .
all participants were educated to at least gcse level , and most were current students ( n = 31 , 59.6 %) or employed ( n = 7 , 13.5 %) .
participants were paid pound15 or , if they were an undergraduate student , had the option of receiving course credits for their time .
sample size a power analysis for this study was carried out based on estimates of effect size from ed research comparing a clinical sample with healthy controls ( 16 , 17 ) .
it was estimated that a sample size of 34 , with an alpha level of 0.05 would provide 80 % power to detect a medium effect size .
procedure the study took place at university college london ( ucl ) from november 2011 to june 2013 .
ethical approval was granted by the ucl research ethics committee .
to minimize the risks of fasting , participants were given advice and information on fasting and its possible risks , and were informed to immediately stop fasting if they felt unwell .
study design the study used a within subjects , repeated - measures design to test individuals' responses to 18 - h fasting and non - fasting periods .
participants met with researchers on three occasions ; the first meeting consisted of a screening questionnaire and completion of ed and mood measures .
the second and third meetings followed the fasting and non - fasting conditions .
participants were required to independently complete both an 18 - h fasting and an 18 - h non - fasting period , which were at least a week apart to ensure no carry over effects of fasting .
during the fasting period , participants were asked not to consume any food or drink other than water .
participants were asked to be truthful about whether they had adhered to fasting conditions .
in order to promote adherence , participants were informed that a random sample of participants would be asked to provide a urine sample to check levels of ketones , biological markers of fasting .
no urine samples were actually obtained as ketone levels are not an accurate indicator of fasting adherence due to biological homeostatic mechanisms ( 3 , 18 ) .
during the non - fasting period , participants were told to eat and drink normally .
participants completed visual analog scales ( vass ) diary measures throughout both fasting and non - fasting periods .
at the end of both conditions , participants met with researchers to provide their completed self - report measures and , at the end of the third meeting , participants were reimbursed and debriefed .

figure 1 flow chart of the study design .
measures screening questionnaire at the initial meeting , participants completed a screening questionnaire , which included basic demographic questions about current physical and mental health , and history of eds .
participants were also asked the number of meals they usually ate in a day , whether they had fasted before , and how they anticipated they would find fasting .
additionally , participants were asked to rate their mood on a vas ranging from 0 (" not at all happy ") to 10 (" happiest i could be ") .
self - reported ed pathology to screen for ed symptomatology , the eating disorder examination questionnaire [ ede - q6 ; ( 19 )] was used .
this is a 28 - item self - report questionnaire , providing four subscale scores ; dietary restraint , shape concern , weight concern , and eating concern , as well as a global score .
a study indicated that the ede - q6 has adequate reliability and validity in community samples ( 20 ) .
self - reported depression and anxiety participants completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale [ hads ; ( 21 )] , which is a widely used 14 - item self - report measure with seven anxiety and seven depression items .
it provides separate subscale scores for anxiety and depression , as well as an overall score .
vas diary measures during the fasting condition , participants were asked to rate mood , reward from fasting , sense of achievement , sense of self - control , and difficulty fasting , using vass ranging from zero (" not at all ") to 10 (" extremely ") .
measures were completed every 2 h throughout the fasting day , giving a total of five measures .
participants also provided vas scores at the beginning of the fasting period to give a baseline .
similarly , throughout the non - fasting condition , participants were also asked to rate mood , irritability , sense of self - control , and sense of achievement so that participants acted as their own controls by providing data on a non - fasting day .
randomization participants were randomized to complete either the fasting or non - fasting condition first .
for allocation to condition , a computer - generated list of random numbers was used , participants of which were assigned to in the order that they entered the study .
statistical analyses data were analyzed using spss 19.0 for windows .
all statistical tests used a 0.5 significance level .
all participants' data were analyzed together , and there were no outliers or data excluded .
effect of fasting was assessed using paired samples t - tests comparing vas data before and after fasting .
a repeated - measures anova was used to assess whether there was a main effect of fasting .
results previous fasting most participants had not fasted before ( 73.1 % , n = 38 ) .
fourteen participants had fasted previously ( 26.92 %). of these , nine had done so for dietary or health reasons , and five had done so for religion .
self - reported eating disorders mean bmi was 21.19 ( sd = 3.22 , range 15.80 - 30.70 ) .
eight participants had a bmi below the world health organisation ( 22 ) clinical cut - off of < 18.5 kg / m2. of these , none scored in the clinical range on any ede - q subscales .
mean scores on all ede - q subscales were higher than in fairburn and beglin ( 19 ) normative sample .
mean scores on global , restraint , shape concern , and weight concern subscales were within one sd of fairburn and beglin 's norms .
mean eating concern score was within two sds of the norm .
self - reported depression and anxiety the mean anxiety score was 5.57 ( sd = 4.17 , range 0 - 18 ) and mean depression score was 2.82 ( sd = 2.83 , range 0 - 12 ) .
these are within one sd of norms found in non - clinical populations previously ( 23 ) .
effect of fasting paired samples t - tests were used to compare mean scores on vas measures at the start of fasting ( f1 ) and end of fasting ( f6 ) .
significance values were bonferroni corrected to control risk of type - i error .
all paired samples t - tests can be seen in table 1 .
at the end of fasting , participants were significantly hungrier , more irritable , had a significantly higher sense of achievement , pride , and self - control than at the start of fasting .
participants also rated fasting as increasingly difficult throughout the fasting period .
difficulty rating at the end of the fasting period ( f6 ) was significantly correlated with hunger , r = 0.67 , p > 0.001 , and irritability , r = 0.68 , p > 0.001 , at the end of fasting .
table 1 paired samples t - tests comparing mean scores on vas measures from start of fasting ( f1 ) to end of fasting ( f6 ) , start of non - fasting ( nf1 ) to end of non - fasting ( nf6 ) and comparing scores on vas measures at the end of fasting ( f6 ) and end of non - fasting ( nf6 ) .

significance levels on t - tests are bonferroni corrected .
* indicates p < 0.05 .
** indicates p < 0.01 .
significance values were bonferroni adjusted. by contrast , paired samples t - tests showed that there was no significant difference on any vas measures from the start of the non - fasting period ( nf1 ) to the end of non - fasting ( nf6 ) .
t - tests were also performed comparing mean scores on vas measures from the end of fasting f6 and end of non - fasting nf6 periods .
these showed that at the end of fasting compared to the end of non - fasting participants experienced a significantly higher sense of reward , were significantly more hungry , had a significantly higher sense of achievement , and a significantly higher sense of pride .
a repeated - measures anova revealed that there was a significant main effect of fasting on vas measures , f ( 1 , 41 ) = 46.92 , p < 0.05 .
there was a significant interaction effect between fasting condition and vas measure rating , f ( 4.31 , 176.56 ) = 12.09 , p = < 0.05 , suggesting that fasting impacted on participants' subjective psychological experiences .
discussion the current study set out to explore the impact of short - term fasting on psychological experiences , including positive moods in healthy participants .
the hypothesis that fasting would affect psychological variables was supported .
as fasting progressed , participants reported that it was increasingly difficult and they became hungrier , however , they also experienced an increased sense of achievement , pride , and control .
although sense of reward did not increase significantly from start to end of fasting , this may be due to the fact that , even at the very start of fasting , participants reported having a higher sense of reward .
sense of reward did continue to increase throughout fasting , though not significantly .
at the start of non - fasting , sense of reward was rated as lower and this decreased throughout non - fasting , leading to a significantly higher sense of reward at the end of fasting than at the end of non - fasting .
previous research has suggested that fasting results in biological symptoms of depression , such as irritability , mood lability , and low libido ( 24 , 25 ) .
the results of the current study support these findings , as participants reported feeling increasingly irritable throughout fasting but did not report significant changes in overall mood .
however , as well as negative emotional correlates , this study also found that positive affective experiences , such as a sense of achievement , were associated with the fasting process .
while care must be taken in extrapolating from short - term fasting to an , these findings are at least consistent with cognitive - behavioral or cognitive - interpersonal models of an , which postulate that an is maintained partly by positive reinforcement from successful dietary restriction [ for example , ref. ( 11 - 15 )] .
these authors suggest that food restriction is partly reinforced by a variety of resultant positive feelings , such as a sense of control , power , satisfaction , or pride .
previous research indicates that sufferers of an experience both pros and cons of the disorder .
pros of an may include making sufferers feel special through their ability to maintain dietary restriction ( 26 ) .
to our knowledge , this is the first study showing that positive feelings can be generated even from short - term fasting in healthy controls .
these findings may go some way to elucidating how extreme dietary restriction in an may begin in vulnerable individuals from even short - term fasting or normal dieting leading to increases in positive mood states .
the results may lend support to cognitive - behavioral or cognitive - interpersonal treatment models of an , which often incorporate exploration of the factors that positively reinforce dietary restriction , and the pro - anorectic beliefs the individual holds .
limitations of the study the study relied on self - report data , which is potentially more fallible than data from objective assessments or semi - structured interviews due to social desirability bias , distortion , or participants misunderstanding questions .
furthermore , data from the fasting and non - fasting periods was completed independently by participants .
although we asked participants not to retrospectively complete missed data points , they may have done so , and we had no way of checking this .
however , many participants missed data at one time point ( often first thing in the morning ) , suggesting that , on the whole , they did not retrospectively complete measures , leaving them blank instead .
data from the fasting and non - fasting periods were obtained using vass as it was not possible to repeatedly use standardized measures of constructs , such as low mood , which often refer to longer time periods , such as 2 weeks .
the vass provided a simple , fast , repeatable way of obtaining data without overwhelming participants .
however , there were shortcomings to gathering data in this way , such as participants having different conceptualizations of affective labels , and positioning of marks not necessarily being comparable across individuals .
this was overcome to some extent with the repeated - measures design , which meant that participants acted as their own controls .
however , it may be beneficial to repeat this research with use of more standardized measures .
researchers did not objectively assess whether participants had eds , other than by using self - reported ed status and the ede - q as a screening tool .
future studies should use a full clinical screen to ensure that no participant meets criteria for an ed. additionally , researchers had no way of determining whether or not participants had adhered to fasting conditions .
however , the difference in vas measures between fasting and non - fasting suggests that participants did fast .
researchers and participants were aware of the condition ; therefore , responses on vas measures could have been biased by participants' expectations of the effects of fasting .
it was not possible in this brief exploratory study to obtain self - report data on dietary intake on non - fasting days , nor on physical activity .
future studies should include these data .
the study was exploratory in nature .
due to this , and having multiple hypotheses , multiple statistical tests were used , thereby increasing the risk of type - i error .
corrections were performed to account for this , however , it would be of benefit to repeat this research with a larger sample to allow for more rigorous statistical testing .
generalizability of the results to people with eds is limited by the fact that the sample was non - clinical and mostly comprised students .
it would be of benefit to replicate the research with a clinical sample , although this may raise ethical concerns , in light of research on the effects of starvation .
the largest ethnic group in the sample was chinese , which may have led to errors in completing questionnaires , although all participants described themselves as fluent english speakers .
furthermore , it may also have resulted in participants having lower overall body weight ( 27 ) .
however , all participants in the study were living and studying in the u.k. the study may have attracted individuals who liked fasting , or experienced ed pathology .
this would bias the results , particularly if participants regularly fasted for religious reasons and associated it with positive effects .
however , most participants reported that they had never fasted .
moreover , fasting was rated as increasingly difficult over time , indicating that even those who had fasted before found it difficult .
in addition , participants may have been attracted by the monetary reward rather than an interest in eds or fasting .
strengths of the study several strengths of the study must also be acknowledged , including the within - subjects design whereby participants acted as their own controls .
additionally , asking participants to provide vas measures of psychological variables two - hourly throughout the fasting period meant that we obtained rich data .
to the best of our knowledge , this is one of the only studies to explore the effect of short - term fasting on psychological variables in healthy controls .
conclusion the results showed that fasting led not only to negative affective states , such as irritability , but also to positive psychological experiences , such as increased sense of reward , achievement , pride , and control as participants reported increasing hunger and difficulty of fasting .
to our knowledge , this is one of the only studies showing that these positive psychological experiences can result from fasting , even in healthy controls .
these findings lend support to cognitive - behavioral and cognitive - interpersonal models of an , which suggest that fasting is maintained partly through positive reinforcement , and may elucidate how extreme dietary restriction can result from ordinary dieting or fasting .

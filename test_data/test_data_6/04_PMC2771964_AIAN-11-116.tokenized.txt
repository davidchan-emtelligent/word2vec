intradural venous sinuses are commonly visualized structures in the ct brain , even in noncontrast images .
rarely , hypoattenuating focal lesions may be observed within their lumen as a coincidental finding , which may remain undiagnosed .
however , when such lesions appear in the patients who are scanned for head injury , they might pose diagnostic difficulties aerocele cyst venous sinus introduction intradural venous sinus cysts are very uncommon .
they are mainly congenital .
they may be simple cysts or dermoid cysts .
usually , they are asymptomatic and of no consequence , hence often overlooked .
however , they may be symptomatic as well .
they might pose difficulty in patients with head injury when they may fallaciously be diagnosed as aeroceles in noncontrast ct brain .
this might lead to unnecessary search for sinus or compound fractures , which ultimately proves to be futile. through this brief case report , the author aims to enrich the knowledge about these rare lesions , their important differential diagnosis and their importance .
case report a 30 - year - old male underwent ct head to rule head injury .
noncontrast study of the brain was performed by transaxial scanning from the base of the skull to the vertex in the sequential mode .
brain parenchyma was apparently normal .
however , two subcentimeter hypoattenuating focal lesions that were well - defined and oval to rounded were noted in the straight sinus and the torcular herophili region of the dural venous sinuses .
as the patient was a case of head injury , the diagnosis of aeroceles was considered .
however , even close examination at the bone window images failed to reveal any evidence of sinus fracture or compound fracture of the skull .
the patient was then taken for the ct scan of the paranasal sinus region with thinner slices ; however , they also failed to reveal any breach in the cortex of any of the paranasal sinus .
closer review of the images of the head region revealed that the lesions were having a fluid attenuation ( 20 - 30 hu ) .
for better delineation of the lesions , the patient underwent contrast enhanced ct brain , which was performed in the spiral mode with multiplanar reconstruction in different planes .
this study delineated the lesions better and due to adequate contrast , they were finally diagnosed asintradural simple venous sinus cysts [ figures 1 - 4 ] .
there was no evidence of dilatation of the venous sinuses .
there was no postcontrast enhancement .

[ 1 ] they are usually simple cysts but may occasionally be dermoid cysts when they represent the extension of the dorsal dermal sinus syndrome .
they are usually asymptomatic and incidental .
however , when large , they may produce symptoms secondary to obstruction to the venous outflow .
the usual symptoms are headache but may also cause syncope. [ 2 ] the occlusion of venous drainage can cause rapid elevation in the intracranial pressure .
in a younger age group , such obstructing lesions may lead to enlargement of the head and developmental retardation. [ 1 ] similar to any other cystic lesion in the body , these lesions also appear fluid attenuating , i.e. , 0 - 30 hu and isodense to cerebrospinal fluid in the ct scan of the brain .
in postcontrast images , they are observed as intraluminal filling defects with no uptake of contrast or change in attenuation values over the noncontrast images .
on mri , these lesions appear isointense to the cerebrospinal fluid in all sequences , i.e. , hypointense in t1 - weighted and flair images and hyperintense in t2 - weighted images .
postgadolinium images reveal their intraluminal location with no evidence of contrast enhancement. [ 2 ] ct or mr venography is better in delineating their intraluminal location and extent where they areidentified as filling defects within the dural venous sinus .
there is usually no evidence of proximal venous sinus dilatation unless the lesions are sufficiently big to cause substantial obstruction to the venous outflow .
although majority of these lesions are incidentally detected and are usually asymptomatic , they may yet require conservative or surgical management in symptomatic patients .
medical therapy may be sufficient to control headaches in majority of the cases .
however , frequent episodes of syncope is usually an indication of surgical excision of these lesions. [ 2 ] the important differential diagnosis involves adipose tissue , arachnoid granulations and aeroceles .
the presence of adipose tissue has been reported in the dural sinuses by many authors. [ 34 ] their fat density easily differentiates them in both the ct and mr images of brain .
arachnoid granulations can be visualized within the sinuses , including the posterior sagittal sinus. [ 56 ] occasionally , these can become quite large , even mimicking tumors .
these granulations appear as sessile or pedunculated polypoidal structures attached to the walls of the sinus in the specific locations .
although aeroceles may visually be mistaken for cysts , their close examination reveal ct densities of less than - 50 hu and they appear as signal voids in all sequences of mr imaging .
very few references are present in the medical literature regarding these peculiar but simple to diagnose lesions , particularly the symptomatic ones. [ 2 ] to summarize , intraluminal dural cysts are rare lesions that are usually detected incidentally , but they should be differentiated from other similar appearing lesion and should be reported as they may be symptomatic in the future .

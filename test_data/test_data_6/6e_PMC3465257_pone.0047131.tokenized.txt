the eurasian otter , lutra lutra , hosts several parasites with zoonotic potential .
as this semiaquatic mammal has large ranges across terrestrial , freshwater and marine habitats , it has the capacity for wide dispersion of pathogens .
despite this , parasites of otters have received relatively little attention .
here , we examine their ectoparasite load and assess whether this is influenced by abiotic or biotic variables .
climatic phenomena such as the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) affect weather conditions in northern europe .
consequently parasite distributions , particularly species with life stages exposed to the external environment , can be affected .
we assessed the extent to which inter - annual variations in large - scale weather patterns ( specifically the nao and central england ( ce ) temperatures ) and host characteristics influenced tick prevalence and intensity .
ectoparasites consisted of a single species , the nidiculous tick ixodes hexagonus ( prevalence = 24.3 % ; mean intensity = 7.2 ; range = 1 - 122 ; on n = 820 otter hosts ) .
the prevalence , but not intensity of infestation , was associated with high ce temperatures , while both prevalence and intensity were associated with positive phases of the nao .
such associations indicate that i. hexagonus are most abundant when weather conditions are warmer and wetter .
ticks were more prevalent on juvenile than sub - adult or adult otters , which probably reflects the length of time the hosts spend in the holt where these ticks quest .
high tick number was associated with poor host condition , so either poor condition hosts are more susceptible to ticks , or tick infestations negatively impact on host condition .
otters are clearly an important and common host for i. hexagonus , which has implications for vector - borne diseases .
this work is the first to consider the impacts of long - term weather patterns on i. hexagonus and uses wild - animal cadavers to illustrate the importance of abiotic and biotic pressures impacting parasitic populations .

introduction current change in climate ( the long - term average meteorological conditions of a region [ 1 ]) is associated with increases in temperature and precipitation , especially in northern temperate zones [ 1 ] .
this influences parasite distributions both directly [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and indirectly , for example via impacts on host range [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
weather ( short - term variation in meteorological conditions ) can cause variations in parasite distributions whilst synchronously influencing host abundance [ 6 ] but will affect specific host - parasite interactions differently [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
weather patterns are influenced by climatic phenomena such as the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) .
the nao affects european climate such that , when in positive phases , northern europe experiences warmer and wetter conditions [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
identifying associations between climate and the distribution of vectors over time ( e.g. [ 12 ] , [ 13 ]) is an essential pre - requisite to understanding public and wildlife health risks resulting from vector - borne infection .
ixodid ticks are vectors for a range of pathogens causing diseases including lyme disease , boutonneuse fever , q fever , tick - borne fever and tick - borne encephalitis [ 14 ] .
ixodes hexagonus is an efficient vector of borrelia burgdorferi , the causative agent of lyme disease [ 15 ] but in the uk , i. ricinus has received most attention because of its ubiquitous nature and association with transmission of pathogens to humans and livestock [ 14 ] .
the distribution of i. ricinus is influenced by weather [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] and the presence of suitable hosts and habitat [ 18 ] .
temperature increases are associated with increasing population density and geographic range of i. ricinus , a european tick [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] , and other tick species such as the north american species i. scapularis .
[ 20 ] .
the majority of ixodid ticks require > 80 % relative humidity for survival off the host [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] and as such , positive phases of the nao may benefit ixodid ticks by creating suitably humid weather .
landscape , habitat use and local weather conditions have been associated with tick distributions previously [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
the impact of such environmental variables on host - parasite interactions is , however , highly variable [ 26 ] .
mustelids have been associated with the nidiculous ( burrow or nest dwelling ) tick i. hexagonus [ 24 ] but the relationship between i. hexagonus and weather conditions has not been examined previously .
the eurasian otter , lutra lutra , is a top predator in the uk and a sentinel of freshwater health [ 27 ] .
otters are wide ranging opportunistic predators that feed in terrestrial , freshwater and marine habitats [ 28 ] .
they are therefore potentially exposed to a wide diversity of pathogens and a great deal can be learned about the distribution of parasites in uk ecosystems by screening such a generalist host .
here , we identified the tick species that use otters as a host .
next , we investigated how weather patterns and host characteristics are associated with tick infestations of otters in england and wales .
specifically , we hypothesised that tick occurrence ( prevalence and intensity ) would be positively correlated with temporal variation in : i ) the nao ( associated with warmer and wetter weather in the uk ) , and ; ii ) higher central england ( ce ) temperatures ( a long - term record of temperature in central england , see materials and methods ) .
based on these findings we hypothesised that spatial variation in tick counts among meteorologically distinct regions of the uk would correlate positively with rainfall and temperature .
results tick species tick ( ixodes hexagonus ) prevalence on eurasian otters , between 2004 and 2010 , was 24.3 % ( 199 out of 820 ) ( figure 1 ) .
on some hosts , all post - hatch tick life stages ( larva , nymph and adults ) were recovered ( 18 cases ) , but almost 40 % of hosts had only one life stage present at collection ( larvae = 13 cases , nymph = 40 cases , adult = 26 cases ) ( table 1 ) .
infested otters were widespread across england and wales ( figure 1 ) with no evidence of clustering of infestation within the otter distribution ( ripley 's k analysis at the 95 % confidence level using radii ranging from 1 km - 130 km ) .

the south wales and southwest england region ( figure 1 ) had significantly higher tick counts on otters than all other regions , while east and northeast england had significantly lower tick counts than all other regions ; these two regions contributed most strongly to the statistically significant difference in counts between regions ( chi2 = 302.169 , df = 5 , p < 0.001 ) .

there were no seasonal associations between larval , nymph or adult stage ticks on otters ( glm , p > 0.1 ) .

discussion ixodes hexagonus is the only tick species reported from the eurasian otter ([ 29 ] , current study ) .
ixodes hexagonus can complete its life cycle on the european hedgehog [ 24 ] , fox [ 30 ] and american mink [ 31 ] .
as all three post - hatch tick life stages were found on the otter in the current study , it appears that i. hexagonus can also potentially complete its life cycle on this mammal .
the prevalence of i. hexagonus on otters ( 24.3 %) is lower than that reported on european hedgehogs , which are the preferred host for this tick [ 24 ] , [ 32 ] ( 53.3 % prevalence on hedgehogs from western europe , [ 32 ]). i. hexagonus is encountered by domestic dogs and cats in urban areas [ 33 ] illustrating the close proximity of this particular tick to human populations .
the prevalence of i. hexagonus on otters is , however , high in comparison to its prevalence on the domestic dog in the uk ( 5.6 % , n = 3534 [ 34 ]) .
further , the mean intensity ( the total number of parasites of a particular species found in a sample divided by the number of infested hosts [ 35 ]) of ticks is higher on otters ( 7.2 per host ) than on hedgehogs ( 3.8 [ 36 ]) despite examination of cadavers in the current study and live hosts in the hedgehog study .
this suggests that otters are a noteworthy host for i. hexagonus .
the association between otters and i. hexagonus populations may be important for pathogen transmission , particularly if otters act as either reservoir or amplifier hosts , or reduce pathogen abundance through the dilution effect [ 37 ] .
further , otters have large home ranges [ 28 ] , [ 38 ] indicating that this host has the potential to transfer ticks between habitat islands .
the nocturnal and aquatic nature of otters may deter other tick species from utilising such a resource , explaining the absence of diversity in tick species .
positive phases of the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) were associated with increased prevalence and intensity in tick populations on otters .
strong positive phases of the nao are linked with above average temperature and precipitation across northern europe .
together with the elevated humidity produced , such weather conditions may lead to increased abundance of i. hexagonus , as reported for i. ricinus and i. scapularis [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
this may be related to the weather conditions causing changes in the behaviour of either the parasite or the host thereby altering infestation rates ( see [ 39 ]) .
no previous literature was found relating nao to i. hexagonus .
in i. ricinus however , the nao did not correlate with intensity of tick infestation but negative winter nao phases ( associated with warmer and wetter winters ) corresponded to increased borreliae infections [ 40 ] .
further investigation into the underlying pathogenic infections of otters would be useful to examine whether this association holds for i. hexagonus .
both nao and ce temperatures are indices that can be used to describe temporal variation in weather ; they do not provide spatially explicit weather data within the uk. the significant relationships found in the current study therefore describe an association between otter ticks ( prevalence and intensity ) and temporal variation in weather .
we tested subsequently whether warmer and wetter regions were associated with higher tick infestations of otters , and found significantly more ticks in south wales and southwest england - a region associated with higher rainfall [ 41 ] .
overall , however , at the regional scale we identified no significant correlations between the mean intensity of ticks and either temperature or rainfall .
this may be because at the regional scale temperature and rainfall are negatively correlated , so a more detailed analysis of local weather is necessary to clarify their interaction .
other factors such as the distribution of non - otter hosts , and variation in habitat type , may also heavily influence spatial variation in tick abundance .
in preliminary investigations we explored the impact of local weather , alternative hosts , and habitat on i. hexagonus distribution , but subsequently removed these from our analyses because : i ) restricted availability of data meant that inclusion of both spatial and temporal variation in weather reduced the size of the dataset considerably , rendering conclusions less robust ; ii ) information on the reported distribution of alternative hosts ( hedgehog and fox ) and of i. hexagonus were obtained from the national biodiversity network ( nbn ) .
hedgehogs and foxes are both widespread and abundant in the uk and therefore availability of alternative hosts seems unlikely to limit i. hexagonus distribution at the regional scale .
further , i. hexagonus records from the nbn are concentrated in the london area of south east england , but because this database relies heavily on records submitted by members of the public this is likely to represent bias due to distribution of the human population .
the nbn records map presence only ( and not absence on screened hosts ) , so it was not possible to test for clustering within the host distribution as we did for i. hexagonus on otters .
comparisons were therefore uninformative ; iii ) data on land use ( arable , broadleaf and coniferous woodland , improved and semi - natural grassland , and upland habitat ) were obtained from the countryside information system ( cis version 8 , available online ) .
arcmap gis ( version 9.2 ) was used to interrogate these data and to assign percentage cover of each land - use within a 20 km radius of each otter .
significant negative associations were revealed ( between tick prevalence and arable land , improved grassland , and conifer woodland ) , but interpretation is questionable because of the heterogenous and patchy nature of habitat data , the relatively large areas examined which may not accurately reflect the nature of real otter ranges ( these tend to be linear along water courses , and vary considerably in length from a few to 40km [ 28 ]) , and the difficulty in defining where , within this unknown range , an otter may have become infested .
tick prevalence , but not intensity on otters , was associated with ce temperature .
as far as we are aware , there are no previous records of temperature effects on i. hexagonus and the only long - term study on population dynamics of i. hexagonus indicates little seasonal variation and low - level abundance ( on hedgehogs [ 36 ]) .
in general , however ; temperature has a key role in driving tick development rates [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] and so affects population dynamics [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
additionally , temperature tends to be associated with length of diapause , larval activity and adult interactions [ 42 ] .
particularly strong associations are found between i. ricinus and temperature [ 17 ] .
stochastic temperature variations across the year are predicted to alter population dynamics of i. ricinus with subsequent impacts on the transmission of vector borne diseases [ 17 ] .
the contrasting impact of temperatures on i. hexagonus and i. ricinus may be attributable to the ecological differences between the two species .
the most important of these is likely to be habitat choice. i. hexagonus is nest dwelling , and so to some extent insulated from changes in ambient temperatures .
in contrast , i. ricinus uses open areas for questing [ 14 ] , so is likely to be exposed to wider fluctuations in air temperature .
juvenile otters were more frequently infested with i. hexagonus than adult hosts .
host age , in general , influences the intensity of infestations , but can also affect parasite - induced mortality , and the distribution of the parasite among host individuals [ 43 ] .
several hypotheses [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] predict that juveniles will carry heavier infestations than older hosts , either because : i ) adult hosts develop immunity and / or behavioural adaptations to avoid or remove parasites ; and / or ii ) heavily infested juveniles die before adulthood ( selection hypothesis [ 44 ]) although this is very unlikely as a direct cause of death .
grooming is a learned activity in otters [ 28 ] and may contribute to lower tick numbers on older otters [ 28 ] .
additionally , young otters spend the majority of their time in holts , the resting place of otters [ 28 ] , so are disproportionately exposed to such parasites .
effects may be underestimated here , however , because road killed samples tend to reflect the healthier section of the population [ 45 ] .
finally , we found a relationship between host condition and tick intensity such that a better host condition is associated with decreased intensity .
this is not a reflection of the elevated infestations on juvenile hosts because the host condition index used here [ 46 ] controls for size and therefore age , in addition to sexual dimorphism .
this positive relationship could imply that otters in better condition are more efficient at grooming and thereby rid themselves of ticks , or that ticks have a negative impact on otter condition .
we acknowledge that data from road - killed hosts are likely to underestimate tick counts and recognise that road - kill samples are a stochastic sub - sample of a population and may lead to bias in terms of the proportion of the host population examined .
for protected species , however , road - kill samples remain the only way to obtain large sample sizes for analysis .
the absence of tick species other than i. hexagonus , in concordance with the only other report of otter tick infestations [ 29 ] , could reflect differences in emigration patterns when abandoning a dead host , while tick emigration rates from dead hosts may interact with local microclimate .
our analysis of recently killed versus decomposed otters ( see materials and methods ) , however , reveals no significant difference in infestation levels or species diversity , suggesting that observed associations are robust .
such data can therefore successfully illustrate associations between inter - annual variations in weather patterns , host characteristics and i. hexagonus populations .
to our knowledge this work is the first to consider the impacts of weather on i. hexagonus , and reveals that inter - annual variations in large - scale weather patterns , together with host characteristics , combine to affect the distribution , prevalence and intensity of i. hexagonus on eurasian otters .
associations were identified between positive nao phases , ce temperatures and tick prevalence , suggesting that the predicted change in climate in northern temperate zones may cause an increase in i. hexagonus populations .
although the associations highlighted here may not necessarily parallel what is observed on other hosts for this tick , i. hexagonus is common on domestic cats and dogs [ 33 ] and we suggest that tick research should , perhaps , target species other than i. ricinus in the future .
this study illustrates how surveys of wild - animal cadavers can be hugely informative about parasitic populations .
materials and methods the host the cardiff university otter project receives dead otters , lutra lutra , from across england and wales .
most ( 86 % of the current study ) have been killed by road traffic and are stored subsequently at - 20degreesc .
the location ( british national grid reference ) and date of death ( month and year ) , sex , age - class ( juvenile ( n = 25 ) , sub - adult ( 238 ) and adult ( 312 ) and size ( weight ( kg ) and length ( m )) were recorded for each otter collected between 2004 and 2010 .
a condition index k was calculated controlling for the dimorphism of otter sexes , following [ 46 ] .
such that : where a = 5.02 and n = 2.33 for females , and a = 5.87 and n = 2.39 for males [ 46 ] .
seasons were defined as winter : december - february , spring : march - may , summer : june - august , and autumn : september - november .
very decomposed otters were excluded from the analysis .
remaining otters included in model ( and excluding those with missing data ; n = 575 ) were distributed across seasons and years as follows : spring = 137 ; summer = 83 ; autumn = 179 ; and winter = 176 ; 2004 = 12 ; 2005 = 48 ; 2006 = 70 ; 2007 = 122 ; 2008 = 146 ; 2009 = 116 ; and 2010 = 61 .
parasite identification ticks were removed ( via pelt searching and fur combing ) and stored in 90 % molecular grade ethanol prior to immersion in 0.1 % saline solution for microscopic examination ( x30 magnification ) using a nikon dissecting microscope with fibre optic illumination , and identified to species using morphological features [ 14 ] , [ 47 ] .
ixodes hexagonus was the only tick species present and species identification of 15 specimens ( 5 adults , 5 nymph and 5 larvae ) was confirmed by the natural history museum .
occasionally , damage or desiccation prevented morphological identification so for these specimens we sought confirmation using mitochondrial dna cytochrome oxidase sub - unit 1 ( cox1 ) analysis as follows .
dna was extracted from 13 specimens , three adults , three nymphs and seven larvae , from four geographically separate hosts .
ethanol was evaporated fully from each sample .
extractions were conducted using a qiagen kit as per the manufacturer 's protocol ( qiagen dneasy blood and tissue handbook 2006 ) with the additional step of manually crushing each tick body with a sterile pipette tip at the start of the process .
pcr followed standard procedures ( qiagen dneasy blood and tissue handbook 2006 ) .
novel primers ( ihexco1f : 5 ' - tcataaagacattgggact - 3 ' , ihexco1r : 5 ' - tggtaaagaatggggtct - 3 ') were designed by alignment of cox1 mtdna from 8 reference tick species ( genbank : dermacentor reticulatus af132829 , haemaphysalis punctata fn394339.1 , hyalomma aegyptium af132821 , ixodes uriae nc006078 , i. hexagonus af081828.1 , i. lividus gu124743 , i. ricinus fn394342 and rhipicephalus sanguineus nc002074 ) .
these primers are specific to i. hexagonus .
the pcr reaction conditions were carried out in a 50 microl final volume , with 10x pcr buffer ii ( applied biosystems , uk ) , 50 mm mgcl ( applied biosystems , uk ) , 2.5 mm of each dntp , 10pmol / micro l of each primer , 0.5 u taq dna polymerase ( invitrogen ) for each 10 microl dna template .
pcr conditions ( genamp pcr system 9700 , applied biosystems , uk ) were : 95degreesc for 5 min , followed by 35 cycles of 94degreesc for 30 sec , 53degreesc for 1 min and 72degreesc for 1 min , with a final extension of 72degreesc for 10 min .
pcr products produced identical sized bands for all tick samples on a 1.5 % agarose gel .
four larvae , one nymph and one adult were sequenced ( qiagen , genomic services , germany ) using both forward and reverse primers .
all 592 bp sequences from the current study were identical and showed 99 % similarity to the corresponding region of genbank i. hexagonus af081828.1 .
this reference sequence , af081828.1 , was obtained from laboratory maintained ticks over ten years ago [ 48 ] , perhaps explaining the 3 bp discrepancy ( at position 130 transition t to c , and at positions 172 and 188 transversions a to c ) .
the next closest sequence match was 82 % with ixodes asanumai kitaoka 1973 ( genbank : ab231674.1 ) .
data preparation temporal variation in weather was quantified using mean monthly temperatures ( degreesc ) for central england ( ce temperature ) [ 49 ] and north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) phases ( http :// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov / products / precip / cwlink / pna / nao.shtml , data provided by the climate prediction centre of the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration website ) .
the mean of each was calculated for : i ) the month of host death ; ii ) the sixth month period preceding host death ; and iii ) the year preceding host death , for each otter .
these time periods were selected based on literature indicating that populations may be influenced by conditions during the previous season or year [ 16 ] , [ 50 ] .
spatial variation in climate was quantified using long - term averages , which are a useful tool to describe the state of the climate in a particular region [ 41 ] .
long - term yearly average ( 1971 - 2000 ) temperature ( maximum and minimum , degreesc ) and rainfall ( mm ) measures for meteorologically distinct regions of england and wales were collated [ 41 ] .
these regions are defined as east and northeast england , east anglia , southeast england and central south , northwest england and north wales , south wales and southwest england , and midlands ( figure 1 ) and are used by the meteorological office uk climate impacts programme ( ukcip ) to summarise weather patterns in the uk ( http :// www.metoffice.gov.uk / climate / uk / averages / 19712000 /) .
to determine the abiotic conditions for each sampled carcass , otters were assigned the regional average for climate data depending on their geographic location at time of death .
associations between these measures of climate and tick prevalence ( the number of hosts infested with specific parasitic species , in the current study ticks , divided by the total number of hosts examined [ 35 ]) , intensity ( the number of individuals of a particular parasite species on a single infested host [ 35 ]) and tick count ( the total number of ticks within a population ) were examined from otters found between 2004 and 2010 .
data analysis ectoparasites are thought to abandon dead hosts [ 51 ] .
we tested initially , therefore , whether there was a difference in tick abundance between fresh ( collected within 24 h of death , n = 610 ) and not fresh ( otters characterised as slightly or moderately decomposed , n = 210 ) otters .
we found no significant difference in tick presence / absence ( chi2 = 0.515 , n = 820 , df = 1 , p = 0.473 ) or median intensity ( kruskal - wallis h = 0.35 , n = 195 , df = 1 , p = 0.556 ) and subsequently pooled all data for further analyses .
the nao and ce temperatures , for each time period examined , and host factors ( sex , age , condition , season and year of death ) were combined in a general linear model fitted to the tick presence / absence data with a binomial error distribution ( n = 575 hosts , individuals were omitted where data was missing ) .
a generalised additive model incorporating these explanatory variables was fitted to the tick intensity data ( tick counts per otter excluding zero counts ) with negative binomial error distribution .
relationships between explanatory variables and tick intensity were non - linear .
a generalised additive model ( gam ) was applied therefore with splines fitted appropriately .
final models were selected using akaike information criterion ( aic ) .
tick counts were compared between the meteorologically distinct regions of england and wales ( described above ) by calculating regional mean tick intensities and testing for a correlation with the long - term yearly average maximum and minimum temperature ( degreesc ) and total rainfall ( mm ) in each region .
the spatial distribution of infested otter carcasses ( n = 199 ) was examined to look for clustering within the host distribution ( n = 820 ) by calculating a modified ripley 's k statistic , k [ i. ]( r ) , using ripley 's isotropic edge correction [ 52 ] with a simplified border of england and wales as a boundary ( for further details of methodology [ 53 ]) .
all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 2.12 [ 54 ] .

thereby mixed chimerism and transplantation tolerance are established in recipients conditioned solely with costimulation blockade and rapamycin .
however , clinical translation would be substantially facilitated if treg - stimulating pharmaceutical agents could be used instead of individualized cell therapy .
recently , it was shown that interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) complexed with a monoclonal antibody ( mab ) ( clone jes6 - 1a12 ) against il - 2 ( il - 2 complexes ) potently expands and activates tregs in vivo .
therefore , we investigated whether il - 2 complexes can replace treg therapy in a costimulation blockade - based and irradiation - free bm transplantation ( bmt ) model .
unexpectedly , the administration of il - 2 complexes at the time of bmt ( instead of tregs ) failed to induce bm engraftment in non - irradiated recipients ( 0 / 6 with il - 2 complexes vs. 3 / 4 with tregs , p < 0.05 ) .
adding il - 2 complexes to an otherwise effective regimen involving recipient irradiation ( 1gy ) but no treg transfer indeed actively triggered donor bm rejection at higher doses ( 0 / 8 with il - 2 complexes vs. 9 / 11 without , p < 0.01 ) and had no detectable effect at two lower doses ( 3 / 5 vs. 9 / 11 , p > 0.05 ) .
cd8 t cells and nk cells of il - 2 complex - treated naive mice showed an enhanced proliferative response towards donor antigens in vitro despite the marked expansion of tregs .
however , il - 2 complexes also expanded conventional cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells , nk cells , nkt cells and notably even b cells , albeit to a lesser extent .
notably , il - 2 complex expanded tregs featured less potent suppressive functions than in vitro activated tregs in terms of t cell suppression in vitro and bm engraftment in vivo .
in conclusion , these data suggest that il - 2 complexes are less effective than recipient tregs in promoting bm engraftment and in contrast actually trigger bm rejection , as their effect is not sufficiently restricted to tregs but rather extends to several other lymphocyte populations .

introduction interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) , originally discovered in the supernatant of activated t cells [ 1 ] , was first described to drive the clonal expansion and effector development of antigen activated t cells [ 2,3 ] .
later it was recognized that il - 2 has also a critical function in down - modulating immune - responses as mice with a defective il - 2 pathway developed lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders [ 4,5 ] .
this unexpected finding was soon ascribed to the critical function of il - 2 for regulatory t cells ( tregs ) [ 6,7 ] which prevent severe autoimmune diseases throughout the lifespan of mice ( and humans ) by suppressing auto - reactive t cells that escape thymic negative selection [ 8 ] .
il - 2 has consequently become of therapeutic interest for achieving auto - or transplantation tolerance [ 9,10 ] .
the compilation and tissue distribution of the il - 2 receptor probably accounts for the distinct effects of il - 2 to drive both effector and suppressor functions .
il - 2 preferentially binds to its high affinity receptor which is composed of the alpha - ( cd25 ) , beta - ( cd122 ) and common gamma - chains ( cd132 ) and with a lower affinity to the dimeric il - 2 receptor consisting of cd122 and cd132 .
the high affinity receptor is constitutively expressed on tregs and rapidly upregulated on conventional t cells and nk cells upon activation , while resting nk cells and memory cd8 t cells constitutively carry the low affinity receptor [ 11 ] .
this particular expression pattern of the il - 2 receptor can be exploited to preferentially target selected arms of the immune system by using different doses of il - 2 .
high dose bolus il - 2 is approved by the fda to treat renal carcinoma and melanoma , while low dose il - 2 therapies are currently tested in patients suffering from chronic graft - versus host disease ( gvhd ) or diabetes [ 9,10,12 ] .
high doses of il - 2 , however , carry the risk of vascular leak syndrome [ 13 ] and low dose il - 2 therapy requires daily administration to obtain a therapeutic benefit .
recently it was shown that the effect of il - 2 can be skewed either towards cd8 / nk cells or towards tregs by complexing it with distinct clones of mab against il - 2 ( il - 2 complexes ) [ 14 - 16 ] .
due to their extended serum half - life , il - 2 complexes exhibit a high biological activity and thereby circumvent the major disadvantages of recombinant il - 2 therapy [ 17 ] .
the alpha - il - 2 clone jes6 - 1a12 binds to a specific site on il - 2 that is relevant for its interaction with the low affinity beta chain ( cd122 ) of the il - 2 receptor , which is mainly expressed on resting nk and cd8 memory t cells , but preserves its binding to the high affinity alpha - chain ( cd25 ) which is expressed at the highest levels on tregs .
thereby the effect of il - 2 when bound to the complexes is preferentially directed towards cd25high regulatory cells rather than cd122 + nk / cd8 memory cells [ 16,18 ] .
il - 2 / jes6 - 1a12 complexes have been shown to alleviate several immune disorders in rodents owing to the extensive expansion and activation of tregs in vivo .
il - 2 complexes ameliorated collagen - induced arthritis , delayed the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , alleviated allergic airway disease and induced long term survival of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells [ 15,19,20 ] .
furthermore , il - 2 complexes enhanced the stable engraftment of mhc - matched allogeneic bm in sublethally irradiated mice [ 21 ] , but have not been explored in mhc - mismatched bmt models so far and neither in non - cytotoxic / irradiation - free bmt settings .
recently our group demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of recipient tregs obviates the need for cytoreductive conditioning ( i.e. irradiation or cytotoxic drugs ) in a fully allogeneic bmt model when given together with rapamycin and costimulation blockade ( alpha - cd40l , ctla4 - ig ) .
this regimen induces durable mixed chimerism and tolerance to skin and heart allografts [ 22,23 ] .
however , in terms of clinical translation it would be preferable if individualized cell therapies can be replaced by drugs that selectively expand and activate tregs in vivo .
therefore , we investigated the ability of il - 2 complexes to promote the engraftment of fully mismatched bm under costimulation blockade .

results il - 2 complexes inhibit bone marrow engraftment the adoptive transfer of polyclonal recipient tregs ( in vitro tregs ) is uniquely potent in promoting the engraftment of allogeneic bm in recipients conditioned only with rapamycin and costimulation blockade ( without irradiation ) [ 22,27 ] .
to test whether il - 2 complexes can substitute treg cell therapy in this setting , bmt recipients ( c57bl / 6 ) received fully mhc - mismatched balb / c bm ( 20x106 cells per mouse ) , costimulation blockade ( alpha - cd154 mab , ctla4 - ig ) and rapamycin together with either treg transfer or il2 complex ( 5mug il2 + 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) treatment ( 4 , 3 and 2 days before bmt ) .
unexpectedly , none of the mice receiving il - 2 complexes developed chimerism , whereas three of four mice treated with tregs developed chimerism [ 0 / 6 vs. 3 / 4 ; p = 0.0333 ] ( fig 1a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g001 fig 1 il - 2 complexes promote bm rejection .
the ability of il - 2 complexes to replace treg therapy was tested in different bmt models .
donor chimerism was analyzed in blood 14 days after transplantation by staining the balb / c specific marker h2 - dd on myeloid ( mac - 1 ) cells .
( a ) il - 2 complexes were less effective than treg therapy in promoting bm engraftment .
naive c57bl / 6 mice were grafted with 20x106 unseparated balb / c bm cells ( d0 ) under the cover of costimulation blockade ( alpha - cd154 , ctla4ig ) and a short course of rapamycin .
the recipients were additionally treated with either in vitro activated tregs ( 3x106 ) ( n = 4 ) , il - 2 complex expanded tregs ( 3x106 ) ( n = 4 ) or il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ; d - 4 , d - 3 , d - 2 ) ( n = 6 ) .

( b ) il - 2 complexes enhanced bm rejection .
naive c57bl / 6 mice received a total body irradiation of 1gy , costimulation blockade ( alpha - cd154 , ctla4 - ig ) , as well as 20x106 unseparated balb / c bm cells ( d0 ) with varying doses ( 1mug il - 2 / 5mug alpha - il - 2 , n = 8 ; 0.5 mug il - 2 / 2.5mug alpha - il - 2 , n = 5 , 0.25 mug il - 2 / 1.25mug alpha - il - 2 , n = 5 ) of il - 2 complexes ; ( d3 , d5 ) or without il - 2 complexes ( n = 11 ) .
two - color flow cytometry plots are shown from representative bmt recipients ( left ) .
each dot in the scatter diagram depicts one mouse from two individual experiments ( right ) [ no il - 2 complexes vs. 1mug il - 2 / 5mug alpha - il - 2 p = 0.0004 ; no il - 2 complexes vs. 0.5mug il - 2 / 2.5mug alpha - il - 2 : p = 0.7769 , no il - 2 complexes vs. 0.25mug il - 2 / 1.25mug alpha - il - 2 : p = 0.8966 ] .
( c ) omission of ctla4 - ig did not reverse the detrimental effect of il - 2 complexes .
naive c57bl / 6 mice were irradiated with 1gy tbi before receiving costimulation blockade ( alpha - cd154 ) and 20x106 unseparated balb / c bm cells ( d0 ) with ( 1mug il - 2 / 5mug alpha - il - 2 ; d3 , d5 ) ( n = 6 ) or without il - 2 complexes ( n = 6 ) .
two - color flow cytometry plots are shown from representative bmt recipients ( left ) .
each dot in the scatter diagram shows one mouse from one experiment ( right ) [ p = 0.0627 ] .
( d ) il - 2 complexes increased the reactivity of cd8 t cells and nk cells toward donor antigens .
splenocytes from untreated mice or mice treated with il - 2 complexes were stimulated in vitro with irradiated balb / c ( allogeneic ) or c57bl / 6 ( syngeneic ) bm cells .
the proliferation of cd8 t and nk cells was assessed by measuring the proliferation marker ki67 .
each symbol represents 2 mice from one experiment .
( f ) 4x105 responder splenocytes from congenic cd45.1 mice were stimulated in vitro with alpha - cd3 and co - cultured with equal number of either in vitro activated or il - 2 complex expanded tregs .
to avoid the potential stimulation of donor - reactive cd8 t and nk cells prior to transplantation , we next administered il - 2 complexes 3 and 5 days after bmt and also reduced the administered dose to a fifth ( 1mug il - 2 + 5 mug alpha - il - 2 ) .
this time , we conditioned the recipients with a regimen of non - myeloablative irradiation ( 1gy tbi ) and costimulation blockade that is effective without treg therapy to distinguish between the two possibilities that either the suppressive capacity of the il - 2 complex was merely insufficient for establishing engraftment ( in non - irradiated recipients ) or that indeed il - 2 complexes actively promoted rejection of donor bm. mice treated with il - 2 complexes again did not develop chimerism , while in contrast mice from the control group exhibited high levels of chimerism [ 0 / 8 with vs. 9 / 11 without il - 2 complexes , p = 0.0007 ] further reduction of the administered dose ( by 50 % and 75 % , respectively ) also did not improve bm engraftment ( fig 1b ) .
to exclude the possibility that ctla4 - ig impaired tregs expansion or function under il - 2 complexes [ 28 ] , we excluded the fusion protein from this non - myeloablative protocol ( conditioning only with anti - cd40l and 1 gy tbi ) .
again , none of the il - 2 complex treated mice developed chimerism [ 0 / 6 with vs. 3 / 6 without il - 2 complexes ; p = 0.627 ] ( fig 1c ) .
to directly test whether il - 2 complexes enhance alloreactivity , we stimulated splenocytes from naive or il - 2 complex treated mice in vitro with irradiated donor bm cells and analyzed proliferation based on the expression of ki67 [ 29 ] .
cd8 t and nk cells exhibited an increased rate of proliferation against allogeneic ( balb / c ) bm when stimulated with il - 2 complexes [ d1 : mean % ki67 ( untreated vs. il - 2 complexes ) of cd8 + : 2.7 % vs. 23.6 % and nk1.1 + : 32.0 % vs. 45.5 %] that was distinctly higher than against syngeneic ( c57bl / 6 ) implying that il - 2 complexes indeed reinforced alloreactivity ( fig 1d ) .
in addition , we isolated in vivo expanded tregs ( in vivo tregs ) from il - 2 complex ( 5mug il - 2 + 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) treated mice to assess their suppressive function in vitro and in vivo .
il - 2 complex expanded tregs were functional but less effective than in vitro activated tregs in suppressing the proliferation of polyclonal activated t cells in vitro ( fig 1e ) .
moreover , in contrast to in vitro tregs , in vivo expanded tregs failed to induce bm engraftment when combined with costimulation blockade and rapamycin [ 0 / 4 vs. 3 / 4 ; p = 0.1429 ] ( fig 1a ) .
in summary , these results demonstrate that il - 2 complexes promote the rejection of donor bm , likely through the activation of cd8 t and nk cells , and therefore cannot replace treg therapy for promoting engraftment of allogeneic bm. il - 2 complexes expand tregs through proliferation in the thymus and the periphery to determine why the activation of cd8 t and nk cells prevailed over the suppression by tregs we analyzed the origin and appearance of the expanding tregs in naive mice after treatment with il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il2 + 25mug alpha - il - 2 ; d0 , d1 , d2 ) .
as previously reported [ 15 ] , two days ( d4 ) after the last administration , the percentage of cd3 + cd4 + foxp3 + tregs in blood , spleen , lymph nodes and thymus was increased several - fold with up to 55 % of all cd4 t cells expressing foxp3 [% foxp3 within cd3 + cd4 + ( untreated vs. il - 2 complexes ) in spleen : 10.70 +/ - 1.09 vs. 48.55 +/ - 2.13 , p < 0.0001 and in lymph nodes : 11.80 +/ - 1.07 vs. 41.18 +/ - 2.01 , p < 0.0001 ] ( fig 2a upper panels ) .
furthermore , treatment with il - 2 complexes significantly increased the intracellular level of foxp3 expression within the cd4 t cell population , as assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of cd4 + cd25 + separated cells expressing mrfp under the control of foxp3 promotor .
the mfis of foxp3 were compared between resting ( ki67 - ) and proliferating ( ki67 +) tregs to avoid bias from the increased cell mass of the dividing cells ( fig 2b ) .
the expanding tregs exhibited an activated phenotype as determined by the up - regulation of distinct activation markers ( i.e. cd69 , cd25 , gitr ) ( fig 2c ) .
additionally , il - 2 complexes also caused a significant , although lesser , expansion of cd3 + cd8 + foxp3 + t cells [% foxp3 within cd3 + cd8 + ( untreated vs. il - 2 complexes ) in spleen : 0.20 +/ - 0.02 vs. 1.64 +/ - 0.69 , p = 0.0072 and in lymph nodes : 0.21 +/ - 0.1 vs. 1.12 +/ - 0.49 , p = 0.0129 ] ( fig 2a lower panels ) .
il - 2 complexes substantially increased treg proliferation , as assessed by ki67 expression , in blood , secondary lymphoid organs and the thymus ( fig 2d ) .
in conclusion , il - 2 complexes induce a substantial expansion of tregs in vivo by stimulating their proliferation in the thymus and the periphery .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g002 fig 2 il - 2 complexes induce treg proliferation in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues .
the effectivity of il - 2 complexes to expand and activate tregs in vivo was assessed .
female c57bl / 6 mice were injected i.p. for 3 days ( d0 , d1 , d2 ) with il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) or left untreated .
indicated tissues were analyzed 2 days after the last administration ( d4 ) by flow cytometry .
( a ) il - 2 complexes increased the proportion of foxp3 + tregs within cd3 + cd4 + ( upper panels ) and cd3 + cd8 + t cells ( lower panels ) in blood , spleen , lymph nodes and thymus .
histograms display representative mice ( n = 6 ) .
( b ) application of il - 2 complexes ( n = 4 ) increased the intracellular expression of foxp3 in comparison with untreated mice ( n = 4 ) as determined by the mfi of foxp3 - apc [ ki67 + : p = 0.0012 ; ki67 - : p = 0.0304 ] .
we compared foxp3 expression between ki67 + proliferating and ki67 - resting cd4 t cells to ensure that the measured effect was truly intrinsic and did not result from the increased cell mass of the dividing cells .
data are pooled from two independent experiments ( left ) .
the increase of foxp3 was also evident by epifluorescence microscopy of cd4 + cd25 + separated cells purified from foxp3 - mrfp reporter mice ( magnification 63x ) .
representative pictures are shown ( right ) .
( c ) in vivo expanded tregs exhibited an activated phenotype .
il - 2 complexes increased the surface expression of cd69 , pd1 , icos , gitr and cd25 on cd4 + tregs , as well as their intracellular expression of ctla4 .
representative mice are shown ( n = 4 ) .
( d ) cd4 + tregs primarily expand through proliferation in the blood , spleen , lymph nodes and thymus upon il - 2 complex treatment as determined by their intracellular expression of the proliferation marker ki67 .
representative mice were chosen for histograms ( n = 4 ) .
we also analyzed the relative proportion of peripheral derived tregs ( ptregs ) and thymus derived tregs ( ttregs ) after treatment with il - 2 complexes .
il - 2 complexes slightly but significantly increased the proportion of helios + neuropilin - 1 + ( nrp1 ) ttregs among foxp3 + cd4 + t cells [ 30,31 ] ( fig 3a ) .
helios + nrp1 + tregs also exhibited a higher rate of proliferation in response to il - 2 complexes than their helios - nrp1 - counterparts ( fig 3b ) .
helios + nrp1 + ttregs expressed higher levels of cd25 than double negative tregs both before and after treatment with il - 2 complexes ( fig 3c ) , suggesting that the differential expression of cd25 accounts for the difference in the proliferative response between the two treg subsets .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g003 fig 3 il - 2 complexes preferentially induce the proliferation of helios + nrp1 + tregs .
to determine the effect of il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) on thymus derived tregs , naive c57bl / 6 mice received three successive injections ( d0 , d1 , d2 ) and treg specific markers were measured in the spleen two days ( d4 ) after the last injection .
( a ) il - 2 complexes ( n = 6 ) slightly raised the amount of thymus derived helios + nrp1 + tregs compared to untreated mice ( n = 6 ) .
representative mice are displayed in two color dot plots ( left ) .
data are pooled from three independent experiments ( right ) [ p = 0.0287 ] .

the bars represent the mean of three mice from one experiment .
( d ) blockade of mhc class ii molecules decreased the amount and absolute cell number of cd4 + tregs in the spleen compared to single giving of il - 2 complexes .
two color dot plots illustrate representative mice ( left ) .
each bar shows the mean of 3 mice from one experiment ( right ) [ p = 0.0031 ] .
( e ) co - administration of alpha - mhc - ii did not change the proportion of helios + nrp1 + tregs after il - 2 complex treatment .
representative mice are shown in the two color dot plots ( n = 3 ) .
to address whether the increased proliferation of ttregs requires the interaction of their t cell receptors ( tcrs ) with self - antigens presented by mhc - ii , we blocked mhc - ii with an anti - i - a / i - e mab .
blocking mhc class ii reduced the expansion of tregs by approx. 25 % and their absolute number by almost 50 % but did not completely abolish it ( fig 3d ) .
since ttregs exhibit a higher affinity to self - peptide mhc - class ii complexes than ptregs [ 32 ] , we assumed that they would be more affected by the deprivation of a tcr signal .
however , mhc class ii blockade in the course of il - 2 complex treatment had no impact on the proportion of helios + nrp1 + tregs ( fig 3e ) .
hence , the tcr signal amplifies the expansion of p - and ttregs upon il - 2 complex treatment , but to a similar extent .
these data provide evidence that in the course of il - 2 complex treatment signaling via the tcr promotes overall treg proliferation , while the surface expression of cd25 , which is higher in ttregs , determines the extent of proliferation .
il - 2 complexes primarily target tregs but also expand other lymphocytes as the effect of il - 2 complexes was not exclusively restricted to tregs we aimed to assess the expansion of other lymphocyte populations .
in line with other reports , treatment with il - 2 complexes caused severe splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in otherwise naive mice [ 14 ] , with the total number of splenocytes increasing by 120 million cells on average ( i.e. two - fold ) .
tregs , which increased by more than 20 million cells ( ten - fold ) , accounted for only a sixth of the overall cell increase ( fig 4a ) .
il - 2 complexes also significantly increased the absolute numbers of conventional cd4 + foxp3 - t cells , cd8 t cells , nk cells , nkt cells and b cells , which reached the peak of expansion on day 6 ( up to five - fold expansion ) ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
in contrast , tregs exhibited a ten - fold increase that peaked already on day 4 ( fig 4c ) .
thus , although il - 2 complexes preferentially target tregs they also expand other lymphocyte subsets in naive hosts , albeit to a lesser extent .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g004 fig 4 il - 2 complexes also expand lymphocyte populations other than tregs .
distinct lymphocyte populations were analyzed in the spleen following il - 2 complex treatment to determine their specificity .
naive c57bl / 6 mice received il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) on three consecutive days ( d0 , d1 , d2 ) and absolute cell numbers were analyzed 2 ( d4 ) and 4 ( d6 ) days after the last administration .
( a ) il - 2 complexes increased the absolute number of splenocytes [ p = 0.0009 for d4 ; p = 0.0027 for d6 ] and splenic cd4 + tregs [ p < 0.0001 for d4 ; p = 0.0001 for d6 ] 2 ( d4 ) and 4 ( d6 ) days after the last injection .
the average increase in total splenocytes exceeds the mean increase of tregs indicating that il - 2 complexes also expand other lymphocytes .
both groups consisted of 4 mice from 2 independent experiments at each time point .
( b ) il - 2 complexes also expand splenic cd3 + cd4 + foxp3 - t cells [ p = 0.0491 for d4 ; p = 0.0028 for d6 ] , cd3 + cd8 + t cells [ p = 0.0118 for d4 ; p = 0.0016 for d6 ] , cd3 - nk1.1 + nk cells [ p = 0.0009 for d4 , p = 0.0004 for d6 ] , cd3 + nk1.1 + nk cells [ p < 0.0001 for d4 , p = 0.0012 for d6 ] and cd19 + b cells [ p = 0.0016 for d4 , p = 0.008 for d6 ] .
both groups consisted of 4 mice respectively at each time point .
data are pooled from 2 independent experiments .
( c ) fold change of distinct lymphocyte populations in the spleen at d4 and d6 .
il - 2 complexes mobilize b cells from the bone marrow il - 2 complexes likely induce the proliferation of cd8 t cells and nk cells directly through cd122 expressed on these subsets .
b cells also strongly expanded even though only very few (~ 1 %) b cells in the periphery express either the dimeric ( cd132 , cd122 ) or trimeric ( cd132 , cd122 , cd25 ) il - 2 receptor ( data not shown and [ 33 ]) .
moreover , il - 2 complexes increased the number of proliferating conventional cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells and nk cells but had no significant effect on the proportion of proliferating b cells in the spleen ( fig 5a ) .
as most cd25 + b cells are located in the bm ( data not shown and [ 33 ]) , we measured the proportion and absolute number of cd19 + b cells in the bm and found that both were significantly decreased upon treatment with il - 2 complexes [ proportion of cd19 + b cells within cd45 + leukocyte population in the bm ( naive vs. il - 2 complexes ) : 25.8 % +/ - 7.7 vs. 13.9 % +/ - 4.3 , p = 0.03 )] ( fig 5b ) .
taken together , these data suggest that il - 2 complexes stimulate b cells to relocate from the bm to secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g005 fig 5 il - 2 complexes relocate b cells from the bone marrow to secondary lymphoid organs .
the mechanisms of b cell expansion in secondary lymphoid organs were investigated .
naive c57bl / 6 mice received il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) for three days ( d0 , d1 , d2 ) and distinct cell populations were analyzed in indicated tissues 2 days ( d4 ) after the last dose .
( a ) cd3 + cd4 + foxp3 - t cells , cd3 + cd8 + t cells , cd3 - nk1.1 + nk cells and cd3 + nk1.1 + cells but not cd19 + b cells proliferated upon il - 2 complex treatment in the spleen as assessed by their expression of ki67 .
histograms are shown from representative mice ( n = 4 ) .
( b ) il - 2 complexes ( n = 4 ) reduced the proportion and absolute number of cd19 + b cells within cd45 + leukocytes in the bm as compared with untreated mice ( n = 4 ) .

rapamycin attenuates the expansion and activation of cd8 t cells next , we determined whether the selectivity of il - 2 complexes could be improved through the co - administration of additional therapeutics reducing the expansion of cd8 t cells while leaving treg expansion unperturbed .
for this purpose , we selected the mtor inhibitor rapamycin [ 34 ] , an anti - il - 6 mab ( alpha - il6 ) and an antagonistic mutated il - 15 - fusion protein ( il - 15 - fc ) [ 26 ] .
rapamycin promotes the expansion of tregs while inhibiting the differentiation and proliferation of effector t cells [ 35 ] .
furthermore , rapamycin - - which is part of the bmt protocol using treg therapy - - has recently been shown to synergize with il - 2 complexes in steering the immune response towards regulation [ 15,36 ] .
il - 6 has been shown to play a decisive role in determining whether naive t cells differentiate into tregs or pro - inflammatory th17 cells [ 37 ] .
therefore we assumed that blocking il - 6 [ 38 ] would direct the effect of il - 2 complexes more towards regulation than inflammation .
as il - 15 competes with il - 2 for the dimeric low - affinity il - 2 receptor ( cd122 , cd132 ) , but not the high affinity receptor ( cd25 , cd122 , cd132 ) , we anticipated that administration of a mutated , antagonistic il - 15 - fc would reduce the effect of il - 2 complexes on cd122 + cells .
in line with this , il - 15 - fc promotes tolerance induction when combined with an il - 2 fusion protein [ 39,40 ] .
co - administration of rapamycin or alpha - il - 6 with il - 2 complexes significantly reduced the expansion of cd8 t cells , while il - 15 - fc had no detectable effect 4 days after the last administration of il - 2 complexes ( fig 6a ) .
il - 2 complexes led to an increased proportion of ( central and effector ) memory phenotype cd8 t cells ( cd44hi cd62lhi or cd62llo , respectively ) .
rapamycin ( but not alpha - il6 or il - 15 - fc ) decreased the proportion of effector memory cd8 t cells ( cd44hi cd62llo ) [% cd44hi cd62llo among cd8 t cells ( il - 2 complexes vs. il - 2 complexes + rapamycin ) : 39.3 % vs. 16.6 %] ( fig 6b ) .
rapamycin and il - 15 - fc had no clear effect on the fraction of tregs , whereas alpha - il - 6 mab unexpectedly reduced treg expansion by one third ( fig 6c ) .
in summary , it appears that rapamycin reduces the expansion and activation of cd8 t cells , while simultaneously preserving the proliferation of tregs .
thus , beyond rapamycin , which is already part of our irradiation - free bmt protocol , neither il - 15 - fc nor alpha - il6 seems to provide a mechanistic rationale for combination with il2 complexes to increase specificity .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146245.g006 fig 6 rapamycin reduces the expansion and activation of cd8 effector cells .
il - 2 complexes were combined with selected agents to alleviate the unintended expansion and activation of cd8 t cells .
il - 2 complexes ( 5mug il - 2 / 25mug alpha - il - 2 ) were administered to female c57bl / 6 mice three times in succession ( d0 , d1,0 d2 ) together with specified agents .
the effect of combined therapy was determined on splenic cd8 + t cells and cd4 + foxp3 + tregs 2 ( d4 ) and 4 ( d6 ) days after the last injection .
( a ) co - administration of rapamycin ( n = 4 ) reduced the absolute cell number of splenic cd8 + t cells at both measured time points compared to mice treated only with il - 2 complexes ( n = 4 ) [ p = 0.0142 for d4 ; p = 0.0244 for d6 ] .
data are pooled from two independent experiments .
groups receiving alpha - il - 6 and il - 15 - fc consisted of 2 mice from one experiment at each time point .
( b ) rapamycin ( n = 4 ) but not alpha - il - 6 ( n = 2 ) or il - 15 - fc ( n = 2 ) considerably decreased the amount of effector memory cd8 + t cells ( d6 ) defined as cd44hi cd62lo compared to il - 2 complex treatment alone ( n = 4 ) .
two color dot plots depict representative mice .
( c ) addition of alpha - il - 6 ( n = 2 ) decreased the fraction of foxp3 + cells within splenic cd4 t cell population while rapamycin ( n = 4 ) and il - 15 - fc ( n = 2 ) had no profound effect ( d6 ) .
histograms illustrate representative mice of each group .
discussion modulating the balance between regulatory and effector t cells is of high interest for the treatment of immunological disorders .
while individualized regulatory cell therapy shows potent effects in pre - clinical studies , clinical translation faces substantial hurdles [ 41,42 ] .
treg - specific pharmacologic therapies with small molecules or biologics would be a highly attractive alternative .
in the present study , we explored whether treatment with il - 2 complexes could replace the transfer of tregs which is essential for achieving bm engraftment in an irradiation - free setting .
our results provide evidence that il - 2 complexes enhance rather than alleviate alloreactivity towards bm actually triggering its rejection .
this unintended effect was not abolished by delaying il - 2 complex administration until after bmt , which was beneficial in a sublethal mhc - matched bmt model [ 21 ] .
substantially lowering the il - 2 complex dose , which was effective in preventing diabetes in pre - diabetic nod mice [ 43 ] , still was unable to promote bm engraftment .
as ctla4 - ig abrogated the therapeutic effect of il - 2 complexes in a murine mhc class ii mismatched skin graft model [ 44 ] , we omitted the fusion protein from our protocol , but nevertheless did not detect a beneficial effect of il - 2 complexes .
we tested the il - 2 complexes in two bmt models .
first we deployed an irradiation - free non - cytotoxic one in which bm engraftment is critically dependent on treg therapy [ 22 ] to directly compare the efficacy of il - 2 complexes with that of adoptively transferred tregs .
further , we used a non - myeloablative model where treg therapy is not critically required but improves bm engraftment [ 45 ] in order to determine whether il - 2 complexes are just less effective than treg therapy or actively promote bm rejection .
in both models , il - 2 complexes failed to induce bm engraftment but instead triggered its rejection .
two factors were identified that are likely to contribute to this effect : the unintended activation of cd8 t and nk cells and the reduced suppressor function of il - 2 complex expanded tregs .
collectively , these results argue that il - 2 complexes cannot be substituted for treg cell therapy in a fully mhc - mismatched , non - cytotoxic bmt model .
il - 2 complexes consisting of the alpha - il - 2 clone jes6 - 1a12 were originally described to primarily expand tregs and to only modestly increase the number of cd122 positive cd8 t and nk cells [ 15 ] .
another group investigated the effect of il - 2 complexes on the proportion of b and myeloid cells without detecting significant differences [ 46 ] .
nevertheless , given the absolute cell numbers of treg expansion , the massive splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy observed in mice treated with il - 2 complexes [ 14 ] cannot be solely explained by the expansion of tregs .
intriguingly , patients receiving il - 2 immunotherapy as cancer treatment also feature a splenic enlargement [ 47 ] .
therefore we analyzed in detail the absolute cell numbers of distinct lymphocyte subsets in secondary lymphoid organs .
conventional cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells , nk cells , nkt cells and even b cells expanded after treatment with il - 2 complexes .
conventional cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells , nk cells , nkt cells proliferated in peripheral tissues upon il - 2 complex treatment although predominantly expressing the low - affinity il - 2 receptor .
as b cells did not proliferate in the periphery but were significantly reduced in the bm , we concluded that il - 2 complexes induce the migration of b cells from the bm to secondary lymphoid organs , which is consistent with the fact that cd25 expression constitutes a crucial step in pre - b cell development [ 48 ] and il - 2 - / - mice exhibit a disrupted b cell development and survival [ 49 ] .
however , from all expanding cell populations we were most concerned about cd8 t cells as they embody crucial mediators of acute bm rejection [ 50 ] , and because their proliferation in response to alloantigens was particularly sensitive to il - 2 complexes ( fig 1d ) and il - 2 expanded tregs seem less effective in suppressing cd8 than cd4 cells in vitro ( fig 1e ) .
therefore we intended to inhibit their expansion by co - administration of other reagents .
in contrast to il15 - fc , alpha - il - 6 and rapamycin reduced the number of expanding cd8 t cells at both measured time points .
rapamycin was , however , the only agent to preserve the proliferation of tregs under il - 2 complexes .
the synergistic effect of rapamycin and il - 2 complexes has already been shown to ameliorate eae , to promote the expansion of suppressive cd8 + foxp3 + cells after bmt and to stabilize in vitro induced tregs in a gvhd model [ 15,36,51 ] .
rapamycin presumably steers the effect of il - 2 complexes towards tregs by inhibiting the expression of cd25 on effector t cells [ 52 ] .
however , this effect of rapamycin was evidently insufficient to reverse the deleterious effect of il - 2 complexes in this specific bmt setting .
rapamycin efficiently inhibits the proliferation of nk cells but only has a modest effect on their ifn - gamma secretion or cytolytic activity [ 34 ] .
accordingly , we speculate that il - 2 complexes enhanced rapamycin - resistant nk cell mediated donor bm rejection [ 53 ] .
the effect of il - 2 complexes was partially prevented through the blockade of mhc class ii , decreasing ptregs and ttreg expansion to a similar degree , suggesting that tcr signals increase the turnover of tregs without , however , affecting the ratio between p - and ttregs .
in accordance with this observation , the administration of il - 2 complexes could partially restore the proliferation of adoptively transferred tregs in a mhc class ii deficient host [ 54 ] , obviating the need of a tcr signal for treg proliferation to a certain degree .
the non - cytotoxic bmt protocols yield very low levels of chimerism (~ 1 % myeloid donor cells in the blood after 2 weeks ) wherefore the rejection of only a small number of donor cells may be sufficient to lead to graft failure .
in such a stringent model the unintended activation of effector cells might thus be more devastating than in sublethal models where higher levels of chimerism are achieved [ 21 ] .
in such models the loss of some donor bm cells can more readily be withstood and does not immediately lead to engraftment failure .
under these circumstances the beneficial effects of il - 2 might then take hold .
besides , the absence of mhc disparities prevents direct allorecognition by t cells and circumvents nk cell mediated rejection which is likewise a mhc dependent process [ 55 ] .
under these circumstances the beneficial effects of il - 2 complexes are more likely to emerge .
il - 2 complexes also averted the rejection of fully mhc - incompatible pancreatic islets [ 15 ] .
we assume that the unintended activation of cd8 t and nk cells through il - 2 complexes is more detrimental in our bmt model as bm cells infused intravenously ( as opposed to islet cells transplanted under the kidney capsule ) are exquisitely sensitive to rejection through cd8 t cells and nk cells in the spleen before they home to the bm. in summary this study indicates that il - 2 complexes preferentially induce the proliferation of tregs but their effect is not sufficiently specific to replace the adoptive transfer of recipient tregs in a non - cytoreductive bmt model .

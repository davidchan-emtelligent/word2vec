elderly lady underwent right eye surgery for vitreous clot removal .
72 hours later , she complained of pain , redness and swelling in operated eye .
endophthalmitis was diagnosed .
she was started on piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin .
evisceration was required .
coagulase negative staphylococci were isolated and vancomycin was continued postoperatively .
she was discharged on home intravenous vancomycin therapy .
admitted one week later with painful oral ulcers , fever and diffuse erythmatous body rash .
vancomycin and other medications were stopped .
investigations revealed elevated double - stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and anti histone antibodies .
skin biopsy was suggestive of lupus rash .
she was started on 60 mg of oral prednisone , improved dramatically and discharged to home .
this article is available from : http :// casesjournal.com / casesjournal / article / view / 6293 case presentation we hereby present an interesting case of an elderly hispanic lady with known history of sle with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on chronic coumadin therapy .
she was taking only maintenance dose oral prednisone prior to admission for sle .
she developed right vitreous hemorrhage on coumadin and underwent clot removal surgery .
3 days later , she complained of severe pain , redness and swelling in right eye .
ct scan of orbits was suggestive of endophthalmitis .
she was started on iv piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin .
subsequently , she underwent evisceration of right eye .
intraoperative cultures were positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus and vancomycin was continued in the post operative period and at the time of discharge for a total duration of 2 weeks .
during this hospital stay she was continued on maintenance dose of 10 mg of prednisone for sle .
one week after discharge , she complained of weakness , dizziness and fever of 101 f at home .
no complaints of chest pain , dyspnoea , nausea or vomiting .
no complaints of dysuria , cough / sputum or diarrhea .
at the time of presentation to hospital , she was febrile , tachycardic and normotensive .
she had painful oral ulcers and rapidly spreading diffuse erythematous rash all over body .
rest of systemic examination was within normal limits .
vancomycin and all other medications except prednisone were stopped .
basic metabolic profile , urine analysis and white cell count were normal .
blood and urine cultures were sent , right eye was reevaluated for any residual infection .
auto immune panel for assessing the lupus activity was sent .
it showed elevated anti ds dna ( 229 u / ml )/ anti histone ( 119 u / ml )/ anti ssa ( 1055 u / ml )/ anti ssb ( 338 u / ml ) while anti sm / anti jo1 / anti rnp / complement remained normal .
she also underwent biopsy of skin lesions which showed irregular linear and granular deposition of igg , iga and kappa light chain along the dermoepidermal junction , which supported the diagnosis of lupus flare up. her prednisone was increased to 60 mg / daily .
within 2 days she showed defervescence of the symptom complex and was discharged successfully to home .
her steroids were tapered down to maintenance dose and she continues to be in remission .
her latest ds dna antibody levels were 94 iu / ml ( normal < 99 iu / ml ) in january 2009 .
discussion vancomycin hydrochloride is a chromatographically purified tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic derived from amycolatopsis orientalis [ 1 ] .
it is active against staphylococci , including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis ( including heterogeneous methicillin - resistant strains ) and streptococci .
common adverse effects include nephrotoxcity , ototoxicity , neutropenia , most common cutaneous side effect is red man syndrome [ 2 ] .
it is characterized by flushing and itching in upper torso with hypotension in severe cases and is caused by histamine release from the mast cells .
others include steven johnson syndrome , vasculitic rash and toxic epidermal necrolysis [ 3 ] .
lupus flare is one of the very rare side effects , with isolated similar cases reported in world literature [ 4 ] .
proposed mechanism is that the drug serves as a substrate for myeloperoxidase , which is activated in polymorphonuclear neutrophils .
this interaction causes the formation of reactive metabolites that directly affect lymphocyte function .
another is that the genetic differences in an individual 's p450 system causes drugs to be metabolized differently , which results in the generation of toxic metabolites that may facilitate autoimmunity [ 5 ] .
classical features include - more common occurrence in whites and older age groups , infrequent involvement of renal and cns , antihistone antibodies are common in > 90 % .
complement levels may be normal [ 6 ] .
clinically it can be associated with fevers , myalgias , arthralgias and a rash. and it usually resolves after several weeks after discontinuation of the offending medication [ 7 ] .
treatment includes stopping the culprit drug and short course of corticosteroids if the lupus symptoms are too debilitating as was the case with our patient .
follow up includes lupus antibody panel , complement levels and urine analysis .
long term prognosis is good .
our patient did receive piperacillin / tazobactum in the beginning of first admission for a short duration , but it was discontinued postoperatively , with isolation of coagulase negative staphylococcus .
she developed lupus symptoms 7 days postoperatively on vancomycin monotherapy .
the flare responded promptly to discontinuation of the same .
thus the probability of piperacillin as the offending agent remains low .
conclusions vancomycin is a potent antibiotic used in various life threatening infections .
it may lead to lupus flare up very rarely .
timely recognition of symptoms and discontinuation of the drug is key complete recovery .
systemic steroids may be needed if initial symptoms were severe .

for some technical reasons on photograph , igg appears stronger than iga , when the opposite was true on the real case .

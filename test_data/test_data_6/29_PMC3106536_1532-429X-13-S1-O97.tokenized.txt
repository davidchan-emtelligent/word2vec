arterial stiffening and decreased ac with resultant increase in pwv commonly results from aging , hypertension and atherosclerosis .
however , correlates of pwv in a large population of carefully screened normal subjects have not been reported .
objective we studied a non - invasive phase contrast cardiac mr ( cmr ) imaging approach to evaluate pwv and examined its relation to age , body mass index ( bmi ) , coronary ct calcium ( cct ) score and other clinical and cardiac variables in a large population of normal and obese subjects .
methods 223 consenting nondiabetic , normotensive volunteers without clinical cardiovascular disease or echocardiographic abnormalities ( 124 females , 116 hyperlipidemic ( 42 treated ) , age : 58.6 +/ - 14.9yrs , bmi : 24.8 +/ - 3.3 ( 24 with bmi > 28 ) were studied .
cmr studies were performed on a 1.5 tesla mr scanner ( siemens , germany ) using a phased array surface - coil and a spine - coil array .
pwv was assessed using breath - held through - plane phase - contrast gradient echo imaging of the ascending and descending aorta at the pulmonary artery level with a venc of 1.5 m / sec , temporal resolution of 24 frames per second and slice thickness of 6mm .
aortic images were manually contoured using qflow ( medis , leiden , the netherlands ) and pwv determined by the ratio of the distance between the ascending and descending aortic plane along a candy - cane view over the time of pressure pulse travel in between .
pearson and spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between pwv and age , cctscore , blood pressure ( bp ) , rate pressure product ( rpp ) , lipid levels , and cardiac function .
results ( tables 1,2. ) overall and in males and females separately , on univariate analysis , pwv was highly correlated with age , moderately correlated with cct score and rpp , and had modest correlations with systolic bp. in addition , there were modest correlations of pwv with total cholesterol , triglycerides , hdl and ldl in males and weak correlations with hypertension in females .
( all p < 0.05 ) however , after adjustment for age no other variables showed significant association with pwv .
cardiac function parameters including left ventricular ( lv ) stroke volume , ejection fraction ( ef ) , and mass index have no association to pwv even after adjusting for age and bp and there is no significant difference in pwv between males and females .

cct score strongly correlates with pwv .
after adjustment for age , no other variables show significant associations with pwv .
in normal subjects cardiac function parameters do not correlate with pwv .

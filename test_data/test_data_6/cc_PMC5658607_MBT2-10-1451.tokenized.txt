biofilm formation is a multifactorial and dynamic process .
stages of biofilm formation are highly regulated and include bacterial attachment to a target surface , formation of microcolonies , biofilm maturation and dispersion .
this article highlights recent research by gusnaniar et al. , ( 2017 ) in which the authors develop a device to investigate bacterial biofilm transmission between surfaces under shearing pressures .
the instrument can potentially be used to investigate the role of different genetic determinants and environmental cues on biofilm stability and transmission .

originally , bacteria were referred to as planktonic microorganisms .
however , they are commonly found associated with a broad range of biotic and abiotic surfaces forming complex and structured communities known as biofilms .
one of the earliest descriptions of a biofilm was reported in the early 1940s ( heukelekian and heller , 1940 ) , corroborating earlier observations by antonie van leewenhoek in which he identified bacteria growing on tooth surfaces ( donlan , 2002 ; lane , 2015 ) .
bacteria in biofilms are generally embedded in a self - produced extrapolymeric matrix that mainly consists of polysaccharides , proteins , lipids and nucleic acids .
this extracellular matrix is responsible for providing adhesiveness , cohesiveness , stability and three - dimensional architecture to the biofilm ( abee et al. , 2011 ; domenech et al. , 2012 ; flemming , 2016 ; rice et al. , 2016 ) .
in nature , bacterial biofilms are involved in multiple biogeochemical processes and , as a result , they are commonly used in different biotechnological applications ( halan et al. , 2012 ; smith et al. , 2015 ; flemming et al. , 2016 ) .
however , biofilms are also associated with numerous problems at industrial , clinical and agricultural levels , being responsible for major industrial contaminations and persistent infections in humans , animals and plants .
in fact , current estimations indicate that around 80 % of human infections are associated with the development of biofilms ( donlan , 2002 ; romling and balsalobre , 2012 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
this human health problem is often due to increased resistance of biofilms to different environmental stresses and antimicrobial agents ( davies , 2003 ; van acker et al. , 2014 ; flemming et al. , 2016 ) .
importantly , natural biofilms typically consist of multiple bacterial species , and some studies have demonstrated that mixed biofilms exhibit greater resistance to stressors than single - species biofilms ( van der veen and abee , 2011 ; lee et al. , 2016 ; rice et al. , 2016 ) .
biofilm formation is a complex phenomenon , that is generally divided into several stages .
the process starts with the approach and attachment of bacterial cells to the target surface .
this initial attachment is followed by cell multiplication , formation of microcolonies and the development of a mature biofilm .
in late stages of biofilm development , cells detach from the biofilm allowing bacterial dissemination and the subsequent colonization of new niches ( fig. 1 ) .
as a consequence , this detachment favours bacterial survival and , in the case of bacterial pathogens , disease progression ( o'toole et al. , 2000 ; yildiz , 2007 ; kaplan , 2010 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
biofilm dispersal can be an active or passive process .
the latter mainly refers to cell detachment caused by external physical forces such as fluid shearing , abrasion or mechanical interventions .
alternatively , active dispersal is triggered by the bacteria themselves and involves the sensing of environmental cues ( i.e. changes in nutrient availability , ph , temperature and oxygen levels ; nitric oxide , d - amino acids ) together with the recognition of intercellular and intracellular signals ( i.e. acyl - homoserine lactones , cis - unsaturated fatty acids , autoinducers 2 ) .
the sensing of these signals may result in the modulation of downstream transduction pathways ( kaplan , 2010 ; abee et al. , 2011 ; domenech et al. , 2012 ; petrova and sauer , 2016 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
thus , regulatory pathways involving quorum sensing ( qs ) , bacterial second messengers ( i.e. c - di - gmp , ( p ) ppgpp ) and small regulatory rnas have been shown to be involved in the modulation of biofilm dispersal though different mechanisms ( kaplan , 2010 ; petrova and sauer , 2016 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
among these mechanisms , active biofilm detachment can be promoted by the synthesis of matrix - degrading enzymes ( i.e. hydrolases , proteases , deoxyribonucleases ) and production of surfactants ( i.e. rhamnolipids , viscosin ) ( fig. 1 ) ( kaplan , 2010 ; petrova and sauer , 2016 ; fleming and rumbaugh , 2017 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
figure 1 stages of biofilm formation in bacteria and signals modulating biofilm dispersion .
biofilm transmission generally requires both the detachment of bacterial cells from a mature biofilm and the attachment of dispersed cells into the new surface .
among the mechanical forces affecting biofilm transmission , shearing is one of most common passive mechanisms ( donlan , 2002 ; hall - stoodley and stoodley , 2005 ; kaplan , 2010 ) .
in this issue of microbial biotechnology , gusnaniar et al .
( 2017 ) describe the development of an instrument to investigate biofilm transmission from stainless donor surfaces to silicone rubber tubes under shearing conditions ; a device that can be potentially adapted to the investigation of biofilm transmission between a broad range of donor and receiver surfaces .
the instrument consists of a stainless steel pipe ( donor surface ) attached to a holder that be moved downward over the total length of receiver rubber tube .
thus , a biofilm can be grown at the luminal side of the pipe , and this device can use to investigate shear - induced biofilm transmission to the extraluminal side of the receiver surface by quantifying the number of bacteria transmitted over the length of the silicone rubber tube ( see schematic fig. 1 in gusnaniar et al. ( 2017 )) .
to evaluate the performance of the instrument , gusnaniar et al .
( 2017 ) used two staphylococcal species , staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus , as model organisms .
the authors observed that transmission occurred gradually over the length of receiver surface , concluding that such transmission was associated with the lack of biofilm cohesiveness rather than due to a failure of adhesiveness to the donor surface .
importantly , the device designed by gusnaniar et al .
( 2017 ) achieved high reproducibility in the data obtained as compared with previous approaches described in the bibliography .
significantly , this technology can be used to evaluate how different bacterial genotypes ( i.e. screening bacterial mutants ) , environmental cues and antibiofilm agents ( i.e. bacteriophage cocktails ) affect biofilm stability , dispersal and transmission ( donlan , 2002 ; abee et al. , 2011 ; domenech et al. , 2012 ; alves et al. , 2016 ; petrova and sauer , 2016 ; rice et al. , 2016 ; guilhen et al. , 2017 ) .
for example , gusnaniar et al .
( 2017 ) investigated the role of extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) in the transmissibility of biofilms .
the authors found that eps - containing biofilms showed a decreased friction coefficient and , as a consequence , biofilms were transmitted at higher levels over the length of the receiver surface when high shearing speed was applied .
taken together , the technology presented by gusnaniar et al .
( 2017 ) may facilitate the characterization of biofilm 's properties throughout development , deciphering the role of different genetic and environmental factors on the dispersal and transmissibility of biofilms .
the original prototype can be improved to finally develop a technology that allows the automated modification of additional shearing parameters ( i.e. strength , friction angle ) to more precisely investigate how these factors affect biofilm transmission over a wide range of surfaces and materials .

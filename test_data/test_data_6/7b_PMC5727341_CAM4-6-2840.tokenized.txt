abstract despite an aging population and underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical trials , studies on elderly patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer are scarce .
this study investigated the use of chemotherapy and survival in elderly patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. from the netherlands cancer registry , all 9407 patients diagnosed with primary metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 2005 - 2013 were selected to investigate chemotherapy use and overall survival ( os ) , using kaplan - meier and cox proportional hazard regression analyses .
over time , chemotherapy use increased in all age groups (< 70 years : from 26 to 43 % , 70 - 74 years : 14 to 25 % , 75 - 79 years : 5 to 13 % , all p < 0.001 , and >= 80 years : 2 to 3 % p = 0.56 ) .
median age of 2,180 patients who received chemotherapy was 63 years ( range 21 - 86 years , 1.6 % was >= 80 years ) .
in chemotherapy - treated patients , with rising age (< 70 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , >= 80 years ) , microscopic tumor verification occurred less frequently ( 91 - 88 - 87 - 77 % , respectively , p = 0.009 ) and os diminished ( median 25 - 26 - 19 - 16 weeks , p = 0.003 ) .
after adjustment for confounding factors , worse survival of treated patients >= 75 years persisted .
despite limited chemotherapy use in elderly age , suggestive of strong selection , elderly patients (>= 75 years ) who received chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer exhibited a worse survival compared to younger patients receiving chemotherapy .
chemotherapy distant metastasis elderly pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival source - schema - version - number2.0component - idcam41240cover - datedecember 2017details - of - publishers - convertorconverter : wiley _ ml3gv2 _ to _ nlmpmc version : 5.2.8 mode : remove _ fc converted : 13.12.2017 cancer medicine 2017 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2840 - 2849 introduction pancreatic cancer is one of the most dismal types of cancer , with a 5 - year survival rate of only 5 - 7 % 1 , 2 .
these low survival rates reflect an advanced stage at diagnosis in the vast majority of patients : at least half of patients already have metastatic disease at time of diagnosis 3 , 4 .
median survival of unselected patients with metastatic disease is only 2 - 3 months 3 , 4 , 5 .
pancreatic cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly 2 , 6 , at least half of all patients are over 70 years of age and more than one - fifth is older than 80 years 6 , 7 .
unfortunately , elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials .
for example , the phase iii study which showed that folfirinox ( oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil , and leucovorin ) significantly improved survival compared with gemcitabine monotherapy ( median survival 11.1 vs. 6.8 months , respectively ) excluded patients over 75 years of age 8 .
the phase iii study on the combination of gemcitabine and nab - paclitaxel included patients until 88 years of age ( median survival 8.5 months vs. 6.7 months in patients with gemcitabine - alone ) , but the median age of 63 years suggests that few patients were older than 75 years 9 .
population - based studies have shown that in the past decades the administration of palliative chemotherapy steeply increased in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 3 , 10. whether the increased use of chemotherapy also applies to elderly patients , is unknown .
furthermore , some specialized institutions have reported acceptable safety and efficacy of chemotherapy in selected elderly patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , with survival comparable with younger patients 11 , 12 , 13 .
however , in these reports a direct comparison with younger patients (< 75 years ) was not performed 11 , 12 or a single age cut - off (< 70 , >= 70 years ) was used 13 which may mask variation within the older age group .
to the best of our knowledge , no population - based studies have been published which compare survival after chemotherapy according to age .
therefore , the purpose of this nationwide study is to examine the use of chemotherapy and its impact on overall survival in elderly patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , using multiple age groups .
methods netherlands cancer registry in the netherlands , a country with approximately 16.8 million inhabitants , all newly diagnosed malignancies are recorded in the nationwide netherlands cancer registry ( ncr ) .
besides notification by the automated pathological archive ( palga ) , the national registry of hospital discharge diagnoses is used .
subsequently , trained registrars collect information on patient , tumor and primary treatment from the medical records in all dutch hospitals .
the international classification of diseases for oncology ( icd - o - 3 ) is used for coding of morphology and tumor locations 14 .
histologically confirmed malignancies are staged according to the tumor - node - metastasis ( tnm ) staging classification 15 .
in patients without microscopically verified diagnosis a summary stage is recorded ( extent of disease , eod ) .
data quality is high and completeness is estimated to be at least 95 % .
follow - up for all patients is obtained by routinely linking the ncr to the municipal personal records database ( brp ) .
the brp contains information on the vital status of all dutch inhabitants ( dead or alive , date of death or emigration ) .
the ncr review board approved the study .
patients for this study , from the ncr all patients were selected who were diagnosed with primary invasive pancreatic ( ductal ) adenocarcinoma in the period 2005 - 2013 ( icd - o - 3 c25 , morphology codes 8010 , 8012 , 8020 , 8140 , 8141 , 8260 , 8310 , 8440 , 8470 , 8480 , 8481 , 8490 , 8500 , 8560 , or a nonmicroscopic verified invasive neoplasm of the pancreas suspected for adenocarcinoma ) .
patients diagnosed at autopsy , younger than 18 years or residing abroad were excluded .
tnm and eod staging information were combined to select patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis ( 53 % of patients ) .
to investigate a possible age gradient or age cut - off point , patients were divided into four age groups : < 70 years , 70 - 74 years , 75 - 79 years and >= 80 years of age .
due to the nature of the ncr , information on prior primary malignancies was available in all patients .
additionally , a slightly modified version of the charlson classification was recorded region - wide within 1 - 2 out of nine cancer regions ( 18 % of all patients ) .
serious comorbid conditions included chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases , cardiovascular diseases , cerebrovascular diseases , digestive tract diseases , diabetes mellitus and other serious diseases .
the number of comorbidities were categorized in three groups ( 0 , 1 , >= 2 ) .
furthermore , data on socioeconomic status ( ses ) were used 16 .
ses was based on reference data from the netherlands institute for social research .
scores on social deprivation were derived from income , education and occupation per 4 - digit postal code , and were broken into three ses - categories ( high : 1st - 3rd , intermediate : 4th - 7th , low : 8th - 10th deciles ) .
registered treatment after diagnosis included the cancer treatment modalities as mentioned in the treatment plan and provided to the patient ( i.c. resection , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ) .
time intervals between date of diagnosis and date of initiating chemotherapy were calculated to explore possible delay .
survival time was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or 1 january 2015 , whichever came first .
to reduce the influence of survivor treatment selection bias in analysis of survival of patients with versus without chemotherapy 17 , only patients were selected who survived at least 30 - days after diagnosis ( conditional survival ) .
in addition to information about delay of starting chemotherapy , survival time from the starting date of chemotherapy was calculated .
statistical analysis in each age group of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , chi square tests for trend were performed to assess the administration of chemotherapy in consecutive 3 - year periods ( 2005 - 2007 , 2008 - 2010 , 2011 - 2013 ) .
a two - sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
in patients receiving palliative chemotherapy , chi - square tests were also used to compare patient , tumor and treatment characteristics between age groups .
to compare time intervals between groups of patients , nonparametric kruskal - wallis tests were used .
univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of patient and tumor characteristics with the administration of chemotherapy .
kaplan - meier analyses with log rank tests were used ( 1 ) to evaluate overall survival of all patients with metastatic disease and ( 2 ) to compare overall and conditional survival of chemotherapy - treated and untreated patients within the different age groups .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , univariable and multivariable cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to evaluate predictors for a worse survival , using survival time calculated from ( 1 ) date of diagnosis and from ( 2 ) starting chemotherapy .
in multivariable models , a backward stepwise elimination procedure was used with a p > 0.10 in likelihood ratio tests for removal of variables .
missing values were included as separate categories or dummy variables .
in sensitivity analyses using region - wide data only , the additional influence of the number and type of comorbid conditions was investigated ( in addition to the predictors derived from the multivariable models in the total population ) .
all analyses were performed using stata / se ( version 13.0 ; stata corp. , college station , tx ) .
results patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer of 9,407 patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the period 2005 - 2013 , 32 % was 75 years or older .
twenty - three per cent of all patients received palliative chemotherapy .
over time , the administration of palliative chemotherapy more than doubled from 13 % in 2005 to 30 % in 2013 ( p < 0.001 ) .
although treatment with chemotherapy was far less common in elderly patients , an increased use of chemotherapy was found in all age groups ( fig. 1 ) .
in consecutive 3 - year periods , from 26 % to 43 % of patients under age 70 years received chemotherapy , from 14 % to 25 % of patients aged 70 - 74 years and from 5 % to 13 % of patients aged 75 - 79 years ( all p < 0.001 ) .
over age 80 years very few patients were treated with chemotherapy and the very small increase of 2 - 3 % was not statistically significant ( p = 0.56 ) .
besides elderly patients (>= 70 years ) and patients diagnosed in earlier years , also patients living in low ses neighborhoods , without tumor verification , with tumors located in the pancreatic head and patients with multiple metastatic sites independently had a lower probability of receiving chemotherapy ( table 1 ) , in addition , the accumulation of comorbid conditions showed a stronger association with not receiving chemotherapy than specific comorbid conditions .

john wiley & sons , ltd median overall survival ( os ) of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer was 9.5 weeks ( with rising age of patients [< 70 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , >= 80 years ] : 13 - 10 - 8 - 5 weeks , respectively , p < 0.001 ) , and os was 7 weeks in untreated patients versus 25 weeks ( 5.7 months ) in patients who received chemotherapy ( p < 0.001 ) .
as many as 26 % of all patients died within 30 days after diagnosis ( with rising age : 19 - 26 - 32 - 43 % , p < 0.001 ) .
in patients who survived 30 days , chemotherapy - treated patients under 75 years survived longer compared to untreated patients ( conditional survival [ cs ] < 70 years : median 26 vs. 12 weeks , 70 - 74 years : 27 vs. 11 weeks , both p < 0.001 ) , but the survival difference was smaller in patients over 75 years of age ( 75 - 79 years : median 20 vs. 11 weeks , p < 0.001 , >= 80 years : 16 vs. 10 weeks , p = 0.02 , fig. 2 ) .
figure 2 median overall survival and conditional overall survival with 95 % confidence interval of patients who received palliative chemotherapy ( ct ) for metastatic pancreatic cancer compared with untreated patients ( no - ct ) , by age group .
patients receiving systemic chemotherapy median age of 2,180 patients who received palliative chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer was 63 years ( range , 21 - 86 years ) and increased from 62 years in 2005 - 2007 to 64 years in 2011 - 2013 .
eight per cent of treated patients were 75 years or older and only few patients were over 80 years of age ( n = 35 , 1.6 %). with rising age (< 70 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , >= 80 years ) , the prevalence of a prior cancer diagnosis and the number of comorbid conditions increased ( both p < 0.001 ) , particularly cardiac and vascular diseases ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 , respectively , table 2 ) .
furthermore , older patients less often had microscopic verification of the current cancer ( 91 % , 88 % , 87 % , 77 % , respectively , p = 0.009 ) , although they all received chemotherapy .

john wiley & sons , ltd the date of initiation of chemotherapy was available in 77 % of patients and characteristics of these patients did not differ from the total group of patients ( data not shown ) .
median time - to - chemotherapy was 25 days ([ p25 - p75 ] 15 - 43 days ) and elderly patients started chemotherapy sooner after diagnosis ( table 2 ) , as well as patients with nonhead tumors ( head : median 32 days , nonhead : 21 , p < 0.001 ) and patients with at least two metastatic sites ( 1 : median 27 days , >= 2 : 22 , p < 0.001 ). with rising age (< 70 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , >= 80 years ) , median os of treated patients decreased : 25 , 26 , 19 , and 16 weeks , respectively , ( p = 0.003 ) .
in univariable survival analysis of patients who received chemotherapy , a higher probability of worse os was found in patients over 75 years of age , patients treated in earlier years of our study period , without microscopic tumor verification , with nonhead cancer , and in patients with multiple metastatic sites ( table 3 ) .
in the multivariable cox proportional hazard model , all these characteristics were independently associated with a poor os. compared with chemotherapy - treated patients younger than 70 years of age , patients over 75 years of age who received chemotherapy showed a worse os ( hazard ratio [ hr ] ( 75 - 79 vs. < 70 ) = 1.21 , 95 % ci 1.02 - 1.44 ; hr (>= 80 vs. < 70 ) = 1.48 , 95 % ci : 1.06 - 2.07 ) , but the intermediate age group did not ( hr [ 70 - 74 vs. < 70 ]= 0.92 , 95 % ci : 0.81 - 1.03 , p = 0.16 ) .
in sensitivity analysis , the number and type of comorbid conditions of treated patients seemed not significantly associated with a poor os ( borderline : pulmonary diseases : adjusted hr = 1.38 , 95 % ci : 0.94 - 2.01 , p = 0.10 ) .

discussion to our knowledge , this is the first nationwide study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that investigated chemotherapy use and survival in multiple elderly age groups .
the administration of palliative systemic therapy doubled between 2005 and 2013 in all age groups .
compared with younger patients receiving chemotherapy , treated patients over 75 years of age less often underwent microscopic tumor verification of cancer and showed a worse overall survival .
in consistent with previous population - based reports , overall survival of patients with primary metastatic pancreatic cancer in our study was only 2 - 3 months 4 , 5 , 18 .
our nationwide study also confirmed a recent regional report from the netherlands that the administration of palliative chemotherapy has increased rapidly in the past decade 3 .
chemotherapy prescription in the netherlands , however , ( overall 23 % , patients surviving 30 days 31 %) , seemed relatively low compared with population - based studies from the usa and france ( 42 - 54 %) 10 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
although no information on the type of chemotherapy was available in our study , it is plausible that gemcitabine - based therapies were prescribed to the vast majority of patients in the selected time period 20 , 21 , 22 .
treatment preference for gemcitabine was mainly based on its favorable clinical benefit response ( pain , performance status , weight ) and toxicity profile compared to 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) 23 , 24 .
only recently , the studies by conroy et al. on folfirinox ( oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil , and leucovorin ) 8 and von hoff et al. on the combination of gemcitabine and nab - paclitaxel ( mpact - trial ) 9 opened new treatment perspectives 25 , 26 , 27 .
however , despite a good performance status of included patients , prolonged survival in these studies went along with an increased risk of side effects .
possibly , modified folfirinox or gemcitabine with nab - paclitaxel treatment may be beneficial to older patients or patients with a less favourable performance status 28 .
similar to other reports 3 , 20 , 21 , chemotherapy use in the current study was far less likely in elderly patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer .
although the number of octogenarians receiving chemotherapy hardly increased , in the course of our study the age of patients who received palliative chemotherapy rose .
in patients aged 70 - 74 years who received chemotherapy , tumor verification rate , timing of chemotherapy , early mortality and overall survival in our study were very similar to that of treated patients younger than 70 years .
however , although very few and therefore highly selected elderly patients over 75 years of age were treated with palliative chemotherapy , a poor survival after chemotherapy was particularly found in this elderly age groups .
survival of treated elderly patients in our nationwide study (>= 75 years : median 4.0 months ) was strikingly worse than the median of 7 - 8 months in previous mono - institutional cohorts of patients over 75 years of age 11 , 12 .
our observations are likely related to the nationwide character of our study with a less selective cohort of elderly patients .
furthermore , additional analyses of the mpact - study data showed that older age ( defined as >= 65 years ) was an independent predictor for both worse overall and progression - free survival 29 .
unlike older age , in our study comorbid conditions seemed not strongly associated with a worse overall survival of treated patients .
possibly , a loss of ' functional reserve ' due to the process of aging may add to a worse survival of elderly patients , resulting in increased toxicity or reduced dose adherence and consequently reduced treatment efficacy and survival .
therefore , geriatric characteristics and co - morbid features predictive of treatment intolerance should be better defined .
overall , survival of the total group of patients who received palliative chemotherapy in our study was similar to other observational studies ( median 5.7 vs. 5 - 6.4 months ) 13 , 20 , 22 .
although as many as 32 % of patients in our study died within 90 days of starting chemotherapy , this may reflect the treatment goal directed at symptom management and the progressive character of pancreatic cancer .
generally , chemotherapy use in the last weeks of life is considered undesirable end - of - life care 30 .
particularly in pancreatic cancer patients with their already poor prognosis , palliative chemotherapy may jeopardize quality of end - of - life care and yield a limited cost - effectiveness 31 .
therefore , a better selection of patients with pancreatic cancer who may benefit from available palliative chemotherapies is clearly needed .
most previous observational studies only included patients with microscopically confirmed pancreatic cancer 5 , 11 , 13 , 21 , 22 , 32 .
although pathologic confirmation of pancreatic cancer prior to chemotherapy is strongly recommended 27 , 33 , one in ten of treated patients in our study started chemotherapy without prior microscopic tumor verification .
especially in elderly patients , microscopic verification was often omitted .
although in selected patients , a suspected mass on computer tomography ( ct ) , elevated serum marker ca19 - 9 and cancer - specific symptoms may result in a high specificity for pancreatic cancer 34 , misdiagnosis cannot be ruled out 35 , 36 .
our population - based study also revealed that especially patients with pancreatic head tumors started palliative chemotherapy several weeks after diagnosis ( median , 4 - 5 weeks ) .
many patients with pancreatic head tumors undergo stent placement to solve bile duct obstruction 37 .
other patients must recover from explorative surgical procedures 38 , 39 , 40 .
stent dysfunction and surgical morbidity may have delayed or precluded chemotherapy in a number of patients with metastatic disease .
indeed , patients with pancreatic head cancer in our study less likely received palliative chemotherapy ( 21 % , vs. 27 % in patients with body or tail disease ) .
important limitations in this population - based study concern the availability of data .
firstly , completeness of pancreatic cancer diagnoses in the ncr was questioned recently 41 .
although chemotherapy use in elderly patients and survival of untreated patients might slightly be overestimated , analyses of treated patients are expected to be highly accurate .
secondly , the ncr does not contain nationwide data on comorbid conditions and performance status of patients .
however , patients who received palliative chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer may already have a relatively favorable performance status and available ( region - wide ) comorbidity data did not show significant associations with a poor survival .
furthermore , this nationwide population - wide study reflects real - world treatment and survival patterns and also included patients without microscopic confirmation of cancer and patients who underwent pancreatic resection ( 0.7 %) .
excluding these patient groups did not alter our results .
thirdly , although conditional survival analysis has reduced survivor treatment bias ( immortal time bias ) , treatment choice was not at random ( treatment selection bias ) 17 .
therefore , the observed differences between treated and untreated patients are likely an overestimation of true survival differences .
finally , starting dates of chemotherapy were available in only three quarters of patients .
however , patients were representative for the total patient population and the available data revealed important information about the treatment process .
the recently initiated dutch nationwide pancreatic cancer project ( pacap ) , which combines data from the ncr with the dutch pancreatic cancer audit and dutch pancreatic biobank , is expected to provide more detailed information on systemic treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer , such as type and amount of chemotherapy 42 .
conclusions despite a limited chemotherapy use in elderly patients , suggestive of strong selection , especially patients over 75 years of age who received chemotherapy showed a poor survival .
improved definition of the geriatric characteristics and co - morbid features predictive of treatment intolerance is necessary to optimize selection of elderly patients for palliative chemotherapy .
in addition , appropriate chemotherapy regimens are required that are better tolerated by elderly patients .
conflict of interest none declared .

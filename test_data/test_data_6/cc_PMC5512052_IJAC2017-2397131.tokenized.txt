introduction the plectranthus genus ( labiatae ) is represented by ca .
300 species , which occur essentially in africa , asia , australia , and some pacific islands .
several species of this genus are cultivated for their edible tubes or as essential oil crops .
in addition , some species are used for medicinal purposes such as treating vomiting , nausea , and ear infections ; relieving toothache , headache , sores , and burns ; or as antiseptic [ 1 ] .
species of plectranthus show biosynthetic ability to produce bioactive diterpenes like the labdane diterpenoid forskolin , from p. forskohlii , that shows significant blood pressure lowering properties [ 2 ] and the abietane diterpenoids coleon u and horminone that show antimicrobial activity against methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin - resistant enterococcus faecalis [ 3 ] .
in brazil , plectranthus species are popularly known as " boldo " and widely used as medicinal plants. p. grandis is used in the treatment of gastric and hepatic disturbs , and the gastric hyposecretory activity of this plant was already proven [ 4 ] .
several diterpenes present in this plant have shown gastroprotective properties [ 5 - 7 ] .
these results validate the popular use of p. grandis in the treatment of digestive problems .
the abietane diterpenes barbatusin ( 1 ) and 3beta - hydroxy - deoxybarbatusin ( 2 ) ( figure 1 ) were isolated from p. grandis and p. barbatus [ 4 , 8 ] and showed good gastric protection activity in rats by oral administration ( 10 mg / kg ) .
the reduction of the gastric lesions was about 76 % for 1 and 96 % for 2 [ 8 ] .
2. experimental 2.1 .
general acetonitrile and methanol ( hplc grade ) were purchased from tedia ( r ) .
deionized water was obtained from a millipore milli - q system .
all other solvents and reagents were purchased from synth ( r ) .
chromatography columns were developed on silica ( phi mm 0,063 - 0,200 ) purchased from vetec ( r ) .
analytical tlc was performed on precoated 0.25 mm thick plates of silica gel 60 f254 from macherey - nagel ( r ) , and the spots were visualized under uv lamp ( 254 nm ) and by spraying with a solution of perchloric acid - vanillin in etoh , followed by heating .
2.2 .
plant material leaves of p. grandis (# 28377 ) , p. barbatus (# 24408 ) , p. ornatus (# 31929 ) , and p. amboinicus (# 28601 ) , grown under environmental conditions at the horto de plantas medicinais francisco jose de abreu matos ( official medicinal plant garden from ceara state , brazil ) , were collected in january 2013 , and their voucher specimens are deposited in prisco bezerra herbarium - ufc .
2.3 .
lc system and chromatographic method a shimadzu uflc chromatographic system ( model lc - 20a ) , with dad detector ( diode assay detector ) spd - m20a , and lc solutions software ( version 1.25 ) were used for data processing .
the analyses were conducted on a phenomenex ( r ) luna 5u c18 ( 2 ) 100a ( 250 x 4.60 mm , 5 microm ) analytical column in combination with a phenomenex guard column .
the methodology was based on the analysis of diterpenes in plants by hplc - dad [ 9 ] .
isocratic elution with 70 % acetonitrile in water was used for compound 1 ( method 1 ) and 45 % acetonitrile in water for compound 2 ( method 2 ) .
both methods were carried out at flow rate of 0.8 ml / min .
temperature of the column was 40degreesc , and detection wavelength was 254 nm. analyses were carried out in triplicate .
2.4 .
sample preparation and validation 2.4.1 .
isolation and identification of compounds 1 and 2 the dried leaves ( 3.5 kg ) of p. grandis were extracted with ethanol ( 5 x 8 l ) and yielded 295.0 g of extract after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure .
the crude extract was dissolved in 3 l of water / methanol ( 4 : 6 v / v ) and submitted to liquid - liquid extraction with dichloromethane ( 6 x 100 ml ) to yield 60.0 g of dichloromethane fraction .
successive chromatographic treatments in column , using sio2 as stationary phase and dichloromethane as mobile phase , gave 3.4 g of 1 and 140.0 mg of 2 .
the structures of both diterpenes were confirmed by high - resolution mass spectra , 1h - nmr ( 500 mhz , cdcl3 ) , 13c - nmr ( 125 mhz , cdcl3 ) , and comparison with literature data [ 10 ] .
2.4.2 .
preparation of samples leaves from four plectranthus species ( p. grandis , p. barbatus , p. ornatus , and p. amboinicus ) were dried at 40degreesc , pulverized to powder , and stored in a desiccator .
an accurately weighted amount of 1.0 g of each sample was extracted with 100 ml of ethanol in ultrasonic bath during 1 hour at 25degreesc .
extracts were filtered and the solvent was completely removed by vacuum distillation at 40degreesc .
each plant extract was dissolved in methanol ( hplc grade ) and transferred to a 25 ml volumetric flask for a final concentration 0.5 mg / ml to be analyzed by hplc - dad .
2.4.3 .
preparation of standard solutions barbatusin ( 1 ) and 3beta - 3 - hydroxy - 3 - deoxybarbatusin ( 2 ) isolated from leaves of p. grandis were used as standards for the analytical curves and method validation .
each diterpene was separately dissolved in methanol ( hplc grade ) , and the final concentration was adjusted to 1.0 mg / ml. the purities of standard compounds 1 and 2 were determined as >= 99 % by hplc - dad analyses .
2.4.4 .
linearity and selectivity solutions of the standard compounds 1 and 2 were prepared in methanol at 25 , 50 , 100 , 250 , and 500 microg / ml. then , 20 microl aliquots of these solutions were injected into hplc equipment , in triplicate .
for each analyte , the average peak area values were plotted against the respective concentrations , expressed in microg / ml. both the correlation coefficient ( r ) and general standard curve equation were obtained from linear least - square regression analysis ( graphpad prism ( r ) 5.03 software ) .
the method selectivity was determined through the analyses of the standard compounds 1 and 2 and extracts of the four plectranthus species .
in all extracts , the peaks corresponding to 1 and 2 were identified by comparison of their retention times with those from the standard compounds .
2.4.5 .
limits of detection and quantification the limits of detection ( lods , s / n >= 3 ) of the two diterpenes 1 and 2 were 0.015 and 0.22 microg / ml , and the limits of quantification ( loq , s / n >= 10 ) were 0.1 and 0.6 microg / ml , respectively .
2.4.6 .
precision and repeatability the precision of the method was evaluated in two levels , intraday and interdays .
intraday precision was evaluated by nine determinations ( triplicate ) in three different concentrations .
interdays precision was evaluated using the same three concentrations , during two consecutive days , and by changing operators .
the analyses were performed separately for each standard compound .
the relative standard deviations ( rsd ) were calculated for each determination and taken as a measure of precision and repeatability .
2.4.7 .
accuracy the accuracy was determined by recovery tests , which is an estimate of the accuracy of the methods .
extracts containing known amounts of 1 ( 166.5 , 249.0 , and 374.0 microg / ml ) and 2 ( 37.8 , 47.8 , and 62.8 microg / ml ) , in quintuplicate , were analyzed , besides the extracts with no addition of standard compounds .
the recoveries of both standard compounds were calculated from the corresponding calibration curve according to the following equation : ( 1 ) % recovery = amount foundamount addedx100 .
3. results and discussion two analytical curves were obtained , one for each standard compound 1 ( method 1 ) and compound 2 ( method 2 ) .
the linearity of the concentrations versus peak area plot for both methods was determined , and good correlation coefficients were achieved ( r2 = 0.9931 and r2 = 0.9966 ) .
table 1 shows the linear regression equation and values for the lod and loq which indicates that the developed methods are very sensitive and adequate for the investigated samples .
the chromatograms of 1 and 2 and p. grandis extract are shown in figure 2 .
the intraday precision was evaluated by triplicate injection at low , medium , and high concentrations levels .
relative standard deviations were calculated based on observed concentrations .
naturally , interdays precision shows relative standard deviation greater than intraday .
the accuracy was performed as recommended , by collecting data from a minimum of nine determinations over a minimum of three concentration levels [ 11 ] .
table 2 shows the precision of the methods for 1 and 2 , which were accurate with recovery rates ranging from 81.7 to 104.0 % for 1 and from 102.1 to 107.6 % for 2 .
the found recovery rates ( table 2 ) were acceptable since the objective of this study is mainly estimating the amount of diterpenes 1 and 2 .
table 3 shows the concentration ( mg / g ) of diterpenes 1 and 2 in leaves of the investigated plectranthus species .
both compounds were detected in p. grandis and p. barbatus while p. ornatus and p. amboinicus showed only the presence of 2 .
the highest concentrations of 1 and 2 were found in the leaves of p. grandis .
except in this species , diterpene 2 was found in low concentration in the leaves of the studied species .
no amount of 1 in p. ornatus and p. amboinicus was observed by the employed methodology .
the lack of clear - cut morphological criteria to discriminate some species of plectranthus has resulted in numerous taxonomic problems for identification of the specimens [ 1 ] .
therefore , this work may represent a new tool for discriminating plectranthus species , by using compounds 1 and 2 as chemomarkers .
4. conclusions in summary , the analytical methods were adequate for quantification of diterpenes 1 and 2 in the leaves of four plectranthus species .
barbatusin ( 1 ) was identified only in the extracts from p. grandis and p. barbatus , while compound 2 was present in all plectranthus species .
the highest amount of both compounds 1 and 2 was found in p. grandis .
this is the first report on the identification of 3beta - hydroxy - 3 - deoxybarbatusin ( 2 ) in the extracts from p. amboinicus and p. ornatus .

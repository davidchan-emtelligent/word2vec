this study aimed to describe the cross - sectional and longitudinal association between alcohol intake and gait parameters in older persons. methods .
community - dwelling persons aged 65 - 70 years ( n = 807 ) .
information on health , functional status , and alcohol use was self - reported at baseline and at 3 - year follow - up , whereas gait speed and stride - to - stride variability were measured while walking only ( single task ) and under dual tasking ( counting backwards ). results .
compared to light - to - moderate drinking , heavy drinking was associated with slower gait speed in single task ( adj. coeff. : - . 040 , 95 % ci : - . 0.78 to - . 002 , p = . 035 ) .
no significant association was observed between heavy drinking and gait speed variability .
nondrinkers walked significantly slower than light - to - moderate drinkers in dual task and had significantly higher gait speed variability in both single and dual task , but these associations disappeared after adjustment for comorbidity .
at follow - up , 35.2 % and 34.1 % of the participants walked significantly slower in single and dual task , respectively .
this proportion varied a little across drinking categories. conclusion .
at baseline , heavy alcohol consumption was significantly associated with slower gait speed in single task .
selective survival of the fittest heavy drinkers probably explains why this association faded in longitudinal analyses .

introduction the consequences of chronic alcohol abuse on gait and balance are well known , but the effects of moderate consumption on gait parameters still received little attention .
some previous studies observed that even moderate alcohol intake might affect cerebellar cells over the long term , causing ataxia and increased body sway , which may affect gait [ 1 - 3 ] .
however , the relationship between alcohol - related cerebellar damage and gait speed and variability remains controversial .
for instance , a study performed among older adults failed to demonstrate any significant association between alcohol - related reduced cerebellar volume and features of ataxic gait [ 2 ] .
even though moderate alcohol use might not cause gross alteration of usual gait , the effect of alcohol might become more obvious when stressors are added , such as walking under dual task condition .
indeed , gait is a highly complex , semiautomatic motor function , which requires some amount of attentional resources [ 4 , 5 ] .
it has been shown that gait slows under dual task condition , with increased gait variability [ 5 ] .
this effect is more pronounced when cognition is impaired , showing the inability to allocate attention properly when performing a simultaneous cognitive task , such as counting backward while walking [ 5 ] .
as alcohol also causes cortical brain damage , dual tasking might reveal subtle negative consequences of alcohol use in subjects who drink beyond recommended threshold , but who are not alcoholics .
on the other hand , there is some evidence that light - to - moderate alcohol use has a protective effect against vascular diseases [ 6 ] .
one could hypothesize that it could therefore balance the potential detrimental influence of alcohol on gait , by preventing damage to cerebral circulation .
despite the high prevalence of both gait impairment and alcohol use in older persons , we found no study that specifically investigated this relationship in this specific population .
this analysis aimed to examine the cross - sectional and prospective association between different levels of alcohol use and gait parameters .
the hypothesis was that drinking above recommended threshold would be associated with poorer gait performance measured over a 20 - meter walk , as compared to moderate drinking that might have a protective effect .
specifically , we expected that higher alcohol consumption would be associated with slower gait speed and higher gait speed variability .
the negative influence of higher alcohol intake on gait was expected to be more evident under cognitive dual task condition .
in addition , we hypothesized that controlling for comorbidity will attenuate the observed associations .
2. methods the design of the lausanne cohort 65 + study has been previously described [ 7 ] .
briefly , this population - based cohort launched in 2004 enrolled 1564 randomly selected community - dwelling persons aged 65 to 70 years , living in the city of lausanne , switzerland .
2.1 .
data collection in 2004 , participants completed a questionnaire that included data about demographics , education , lifestyle habits , health , and functional status .
alcohol use was measured using the audit - c [ 8 ] .
in 2005 , participants underwent a face - to - face interview with baseline physical examination as well as physical and cognitive performance tests , including gait analysis in a subsample of 807 participants ( 61.6 % of the 1310 participants ) .
the main reasons for missing gait parameters were unavailability of the recording device ( 64.8 %) , inability to walk due to health and / or safety problems ( 20.8 %) , and refusal ( 3.6 %) .
participants who underwent gait recording were more frequently men , were married , had higher education and better functional status , and reported fewer falls than those who did not ( data not presented ) .
in 2008 , follow - up assessment of gait performance was available in 684 ( 84.7 %) of the 807 participants .
deaths were ascertained using the local population register .
2.2 .
operationalization of the alcohol variable the average number of standard drinks ( wine , beer , and spirits ) consumed per week was estimated using the first and second questions of the audit - c. as described previously [ 9 ] , alcohol intake was categorized into " none ," " light - to - moderate ," " at - risk ," and " heavy . "
" light - to - moderate " drinking was defined according to the usual recommendation of maximum of 1 drink per day in women and 2 drinks per day in men [ 10 ] .
the threshold separating " at - risk " from " heavy " drinking was defined based on cut - offs used in similar studies , with at - risk drinking corresponding to 8 - 11 drinks per week in women and 15 - 19 drinks per week in men and heavy drinking encompassing any intake above these limits [ 11 ] .
2.3 .
gait assessment gait parameters were measured over 20 meters in a well - lit walkway , under the same conditions at baseline and 3 - year follow - up. participants were asked to walk at self - selected , usual , speed as when they go out to do shopping , for example .
during dual task , participants were asked to count backwards aloud from fifty while walking .
no instruction was given regarding prioritization of any task .
each test was performed once , except when the test failed due to a misunderstanding of the instructions or a technical problem .
gait speed ( m / s ) was estimated from the angular velocity recorded by the physilog ( r ) system , a device that includes 4 body - fixed sensors on lower limbs and a data logger carried on the waist ( bioagm , tour - de - peilz , switzerland ) [ 12 ] .
within person gait speed variability was assessed using the coefficient of variation ( cv in %) defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean value of gait speed for each stride .
2.4 .
statistical analyses characteristics of participants ( including gait parameters ) were compared across the categories of alcohol intake , using chi - square test for categorical variables .
kruskal - wallis test was used for continuous variables because of nonnormal distribution and the presence of outliers .
robust linear regression analyses were performed to examine the cross - sectional association between alcohol intake and gait parameters to take heteroscedasticity into account , both in bivariate and in multivariate models .
as men and women displayed different patterns of alcohol consumption and gait parameters , a gender - alcohol interaction was also systematically tested in multivariate models .
other covariates were included in the analyses based on their association with both alcohol consumption and gait speed : age , education ( with low education defined as less than 12 years of education ) , and comorbidity ( defined as self - reporting 2 or more medical diagnoses out of the following list : hypertension , coronary heart disease , other heart diseases , stroke , diabetes mellitus , chronic respiratory disease , arthritis , osteoporosis , gastrointestinal ulcer , depression , parkinson disease , and cancer ) .
the multivariate model also included abnormal cognition ( mmse < 24 ) , as cognition has been shown to significantly influence gait performance .
bivariate analyses examined the prospective association between baseline alcohol use and three - year changes in gait speed and its cv under single and dual task conditions , respectively .
regarding gait speed , the outcome was defined as a decline of 0.1 m / s , which is considered as a clinically meaningful change [ 13 ] .
analyses were conducted using stata , version 13.0 .
the study was approved by the cantonal human research ethical committee ( protocol 64 / 14 , decision : march 11 , 2014 ) , and written consent was obtained from all participants during the in - person visit .
3. results overall , 91.3 % of the participants ( mean age : 67 years , 55 % women , 46 % reporting more than one chronic disease , and 7 % reporting any impairment in basic activities of daily living ) reported consuming some alcohol over the previous 12 months .
among those , two - thirds reported light - to - moderate drinking , about a fourth reported at - risk drinking , and a tenth reported heavy drinking ( table 1 ) .
comparisons of baseline characteristics across drinking categories showed that nondrinkers and heavy drinkers were twice as likely as moderate and at - risk drinkers to report functional impairment ( 14.1 % , and 10.8 % , resp. , versus 6.1 % and 7.7 % among moderate and at - risk drinkers , p = . 073 ) .
nondrinkers more frequently reported comorbidity ( 59.2 % versus 40 % to 45 % in other categories , p = . 067 ) and were more often cognitively impaired ( 5.7 % versus < 2 % in other categories , p = . 001 , defined as a minimental state examination score < 24 / 30 ( 11 )) .
3.1 .
baseline gait analysis overall , gait speed was 1.13 +/ - 0.16 m / s under single task and decreased to 0.99 +/ - 0.19 m / s in dual task ( counting backwards ) .
average gait speed variability in the entire sample was 3.5 % under single task condition and increased up to 6.2 % during dual task .
comparison across categories indicated slower gait speed and higher gait speed variability among nondrinkers , as well as among heavy drinkers , but these differences were not significant in bivariate analysis ( table 1 ) .
during dual task , the proportion of participants counting backwards without any error was 63.3 % , 76.9 % , 83.4 % , and 76.1 % among nondrinkers , low - to - moderate drinkers , at - risk and heavy drinkers , respectively ( p = . 052 ) .
the mean number of errors did not differ significantly across categories of alcohol intake .
table 2 shows the results of the crude and adjusted models examining the cross - sectional relationship between gait parameters and alcohol intake , using the light - to - moderate drinkers as the reference group .
in bivariate analyses , the most consistent pattern was observed among nondrinkers who showed slower gait speed and increased gait variability under both single and dual task conditions .
however , these differences did not remain once controlling for comorbidity in multivariate analyses .
although heavy drinkers also presented with similarly altered gait pattern , only gait speed under single task condition was significantly reduced ( adjusted coeff. : - . 040 , 95 % ci : - . 0.78 to - . 002 , p = . 035 ) .
3.2 .
longitudinal analysis about 16 % of subjects had no follow - up gait recording , half of them because health - related reasons precluded the performance tests .
as compared to participants with follow - up measurements , they had slower gait speed at baseline ( 1.07 +/ - . 17 m / s versus 1.14 +/ - . 15 m / s , p < . 001 ) , as well as higher speed variability ( 4.1 % versus 3.4 % , p = . 003 ) .
over the three years of follow - up , 39 subjects died , corresponding to 8.1 % of heavy drinkers versus only 2.8 % of nondrinkers ( p = . 496 ) .
when comparing baseline and 3 - year gait performance , a clinically significant decline in speed (>= 0.10 m / sec ) was observed in 35.2 % of the subjects under single task condition .
this proportion did not differ across levels of alcohol use ( range : 32.8 % ( heavy drinkers ) to 37.7 % ( nondrinkers ) , p = . 690 ) .
speed decline occurred in a similar proportion ( 34.1 %) of participants under dual task condition .
again , no significant association was observed across drinking categories .
gait variability also deteriorated ( increase ) at 3 - year follow - up in 43.3 % and 45.0 % of participants under single and dual task condition , respectively .
figure 1 displays the proportions of participants in each drinking category with increased gait speed variability at follow - up under single and dual task conditions , respectively .
these proportions were highest in nondrinkers and lowest among light - to - moderate drinkers and increased progressively as alcohol consumption increased .
this u - shaped relationship was most apparent in single task condition but was not statistically significant .
4. discussion results from cross - sectional and longitudinal analyses in this large sample of community - dwelling elderly indicate that alcohol abstention as well as excessive use were associated with poorer gait performance ( slower gait speed and increased gait variability ) , suggesting a u - shaped relationship .
however , these associations were inconstant and varied according to adjustment for health variables .
several factors might contribute to the failure of finding an independent effect of alcohol on gait measurement .
first , both nondrinkers and heavy drinkers differ from moderate drinkers in terms of health status .
a previous analysis on a subgroup of abstinent participants ( n = 70 ) indicated that half were ex - drinkers , most of whom stopped drinking because of health problems , while the other half were never drinkers who also had a poorer health status than moderate drinkers [ 9 ] .
as this information was available for this small subsample only , it precluded its use for further analyses .
second , the small number of heavy drinkers ( n = 58 ) resulted in limited statistical power , especially in longitudinal analyses .
as heavy drinkers are less likely to participate in research study on health , the proportion observed in the current study probably underestimates their true prevalence .
however , this proportion is very similar to those observed in other studies undertaken in switzerland [ 14 ] .
in addition , results from the longitudinal analyses were probably biased by selective attrition of the less healthy participants and a healthy survivor effect : results showing worse gait performance at baseline ( slower gait speed and increased gait variability ) among participants lost to follow - up , as well as the increased death rate among heavy drinkers , support this hypothesis of a healthy survivor effect .
this likely resulted in underestimation of the deleterious effect of heavy alcohol intake on gait .
finally , although cognitive impairment has been shown to be associated with slower and more irregular gait speed [ 5 ] , the very low proportion of participants with cognitive impairment as assessed through an abnormal minimental state examination in our study precluded examining this association in more depth .
perhaps using more detailed neuropsychological tests focusing on executive functioning might have been useful in this context .
another interesting finding from this study is the relatively small proportion ( about a third for gait speed and a half for gait variability ) of participants who had worse gait performance at 3 - year follow - up. this observation extends previous observation showing that gait speed remains relatively constant throughout adult life until age of 65 where it starts to decline by 1 - 2 % per year (. 008 m / s to . 03 m / s ) up to 80 years [ 15 - 17 ] .
in this context , the use of the physilog device was useful to detect these subtle changes in gait speed and variability .
this low proportion of participants with decline in gait performance could also result from the previously mentioned healthy survivor effect .
in addition , while participants were relatively young and fit , their average gait speed at baseline was at the lower end of age - specific normative values previously reported in community - dwelling older persons [ 18 , 19 ] .
finally , an original contribution of this study is to show that dual tasking did not improve the detection of gait differences across drinking categories .
this was contrary to the hypothesis that excessive drinking would be associated to slower and more irregular gait , partly through poorer executive performance caused by excessive drinking [ 5 , 20 ] .
in addition to factors previously discussed , the selection of the dual task could explain this negative finding .
perhaps by selecting a more complex and challenging cognitive task than counting backward , it might have provided different results .
in conclusion , a negative association between heavy alcohol consumption and gait speed was significant in cross - sectional analysis and under single task only .
healthy survival effect probably explains why this association was not retrieved in longitudinal analyses .
the observed trend of poorer gait performance in nondrinkers disappeared after adjustment for comorbidity , suggesting confounding by a worse health status in this group .
even though this work did not show significant negative effects of excessive alcohol consumption on gait performance , these results do not mean that older persons should be encouraged to drink .
in particular , occasional heavier drinking confers an increased risk for falls and accidents .
globally , the risk associated with drinking above recommended thresholds may well outweigh any potential benefit for many older persons .

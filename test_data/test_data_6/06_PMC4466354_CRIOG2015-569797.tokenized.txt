1. introduction antenatal renal vein thrombosis is a rarely described diagnostic finding , with variable consequences for kidney function .
its prevalence ranges from 2.2 to 50 / 100 000 births [ 1 ] .
renal vein thrombosis is particularly serious and can occur insidiously during pregnancy .
it is difficult to define a group of patients at risk or a standardized approach to monitoring , surveillance , and prevention , given the small number of cases .
in the antenatal period , the condition is usually unknown to sonographers and it is mainly diagnosed after birth .
we present the case of an affected fetus that was born by cesarian section at 35 - week gestation .
2. case presentation the mother was a nulliparous female , with a personal history of ectopic pregnancy and epilepsy treated over the past 10 years .
her family history consisted of a paternal grandfather who had died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 65 , after cataract surgery .
her 1st and 2nd trimester ultrasounds were normal .
a 3rd trimester ultrasound , performed at 33 weeks , detected oligohydramnios with severe right renal hypotrophy , compared to the left kidney .
the right kidney appeared homogeneously hypoechoic in its cortex with a hyperechoic pyelovascular area .
it measured 31 mm (< 2nd percentile ) .
the left kidney measured 40 mm ( 10th percentile ) , had a thinner cortex , was hyperechoic , and showed anomalies of corticomedullar differentiation with 22 highly visible pyramids .
the fetus was eutrophic .
an ultrasound carried out at 35 weeks revealed two small kidneys , without cysts or expansions .
after birth by cesarian section , a renal ultrasound confirmed the prenatal abnormalities with a right kidney measuring 30 mm and a left kidney measuring 27 mm. renal vein thrombosis was not diagnosed at the time .
the baby died 20 days later of kidney failure , metabolic acidosis , and polypnea with severe hypotrophy .
autopsy revealed atrophied kidneys and adrenal glands with perirenal adhesions .
the vena cava had thrombosis occupying most of its length ( figure 1 ) .
the right renal vein was normal , while the left renal vein was threadlike and not permeable , with a white chalky content ( figure 2 ) .
there was no evidence of renal tract malformation or congenital renal vein defects .
histologically , there was necrosis of the left adrenal gland with asymmetrical bilateral renal impairment and signs of ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions .
the renal capsule was thickened on both sides and fibrosis extended to the perirenal brown fat ( figure 3 ) .
glomerular count was decreased for term .
a cross section of the left renal vein showed occlusion by precalcified fibrosis , confirming that the thrombosis took place gradually ( figure 4 ) .
a review of thrombophilia was carried out in the parents and the neonate including the search for factor v or factor ii mutations , protein s deficiency , antithrombin iii , and protein c , as well as a mutation in the mthfr gene .
the results revealed heterozygous factor v leiden in both the mother and the neonate .
3. discussion neonatal renal vein thrombosis was first described by rayer in 1837 and is a rare event that went undiagnosed for many decades until its discovery during surgery or postmortem .
its incidence varies from 0.5 / 1000 in admissions to neonatal intensive care units to 0.5 % in autopsy series [ 2 ] .
some cases may occur in the antenatal period .
most authors agree that thrombosis begins in the small veins of the renal parenchyma and expands towards the large venous trunks up to the renal vein or inferior vena cava .
furthermore , compression of the left renal vein by the aorta is also linked to a higher prevalence of thrombosis of the left renal vein , in its unilateral form [ 3 ] .
any maternal and / or fetal condition promoting hyperosmolarity may cause the development of renal vein thrombosis .
the risk factors for thrombosis can be classified into three types : biological , amnestic , and clinical .
biological risk factors include protein c , protein s , and antithrombin iii deficiencies ; factor ii or factor v mutations ; hyperhomocysteinemia linked to a homozygous mutation in the mthfr gene ; homozygous sickle cell disease ; anticardiolipin antibodies ; and circulating lupus anticoagulant in the mother 's blood which is transmitted to the fetus in utero [ 4 - 6 ] .
identified amnestic and clinical risk factors include caesarean section ; male gender ; prenatal anoxia ; maternal history of thrombosis ; pregnancy - induced hypertension ; gestational diabetes ; premature birth ; dehydration ; shock ; and any cause of increased osmolarity .
nearly 50 % of cases will demonstrate thrombophilia [ 7 , 8 ] .
in the case reported here , the mother and child were both heterozygous for the factor v leiden mutation .
a heterozygous mutation is associated with a 3 - to 4 - fold increase in thrombotic risk , while , in the case of a homozygous mutation , the risk is multiplied 50 to 80 times [ 9 ] .
as 5 % of the population have the heterozygous leiden mutation , there is no evidence that this is related to the renal vein thrombosis in our case [ 9 ] .
typical postnatal symptoms of renal vein thrombosis include an abdominal mass , bloody urine , and thrombocytopenia .
the diagnosis is achieved through ultrasound .
doppler ultrasound is the gold standard to confirm renal vein obstruction and to detect its extension to the contralateral kidney , inferior vena cava , and adrenal glands .
the ultrasound findings depend on the stage of thrombosis .
initially , the interlobar and interlobular furrows appear hyperechoic .
quickly , the kidney becomes globular and hyperechoic with hypoechoic pyramids , with the eventual loss of corticomedullar differentiation .
doppler ( done in postnatal studies ) reveals the disappearance of venous flow , an elevated resistance index in the artery , with , occasionally , the appearance of reverse flow [ 10 , 11 ] .
the symptoms can be difficult to identify in utero , especially as suggestive signs such as bloody urine are missing .
moreover , there can be technical obstacles ( unfavorable position of the fetus , multiple pregnancies , and lack of echogenicity of some patients ) .
there is also the possibility of false positives or spontaneous recovery .
a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis can be suggested in cases of a large hyperechoic kidney , hyperechogenicity following the path of the interlobular veins , thrombus in the inferior vena cava , and doppler indexes in the renal artery with reverse flow .
there is a prognostic relation between kidney size and postnatal consequences : the larger the kidney , the worse the prognosis [ 12 ] .
patients with a family or personal history of thrombosis , thrombophilia or autoimmune disease , diabetes , fetal growth restriction , or hypotrophy should be subjected to additional ultrasounds .
in these patients in particular , an extra focus on kidney examination is recommended .
medical management of renal vein thrombosis includes aggressive hydration and anticoagulation .
nevertheless , previous studies report conflicting data regarding the benefit of anticoagulation with regard to long - term renal function , particularly in cases of bilateral renal vein thrombosis [ 3 , 13 , 14 ] .
thrombolytic therapy may be considered in cases of bilateral renal vein thrombosis , especially if there is concomitant renal failure [ 15 ] .
definitive surgical treatment consists of nephrectomy and thrombectomy on a nonurgent basis , provided there is no caval extension and obstruction .
thrombectomy for bilateral renal vein thrombosis with caval involvement and obstruction has been described once before , but with subsequent unilateral nephrectomy [ 16 ] .
recently , lee et al .
[ 4 ] showed that bilateral renal vein thrombosis can be successfully managed with early surgical thrombectomy without the need for nephrectomy , thereby avoiding the significant morbidity associated with infant dialysis and renal transplantation .
successful restoration of renal function after surgical thrombectomy in his patient illustrates an encouraging treatment option [ 4 ] .
however , the relatively small number of reported cases and lack of prospective trials have opened up debate regarding the best way to manage this condition .
to date , there are still many unresolved issues regarding antenatal renal vein thrombosis .
there are still large discrepancies in diagnostic possibilities and prognosis .
it would be ideal to keep a register of all cases of antenatal renal vein thrombosis , from different obstetric teams .
a standardized approach for monitoring , surveillance , and prevention in subsequent pregnancies is yet to be defined .
it is essential to learn how to diagnose this condition , as is it necessary to update obstetric ultrasound books and teaching methods for obstetricians .
conflict of interests the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper .

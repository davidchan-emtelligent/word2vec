this study presents the effect of carbon to nitrogen ratio ( c / n ) ( mol / mol ) on the cell growth and poly ( 3 - hydroxybutyrate - co - 3 - hydroxyvalerate ) accumulation by comamonas sp .
eb172 in 2 l fermenters using volatile fatty acids ( vfa ) as the carbon source .
this vfa was supplemented with ammonium sulphate and yeast extract in the feeding solution to achieve c / n ( mol / mol ) 5 , 15 , 25 , and 34.4 , respectively. by extrapolating the c / n and the source of nitrogen , the properties of the polymers can be regulated .
the number average molecular weight ( m n ) of p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) copolymer reached the highest at 838 x 103 da with polydispersity index ( pdi ) value of 1.8 , when the culture broth was supplemented with yeast extract ( c / n 34.4 ) .
tensile strength and young 's modulus of the copolymer containing 6 - 8 mol % 3hv were in the ranges of 13 - 14.4 mpa and 0.26 - 0.34 gpa , respectively , comparable to those of polyethylene ( pe ) .
thus , comamonas sp .
eb172 has shown promising bacterial isolates producing polyhydroxyalkanoates from renewable carbon materials .
1. introduction biobased plastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates ( phas ) are gaining much interest from the polymer researchers as these materials share the thermal and mechanical properties similar to petrochemical based plastics .
a lot of research and development were carried out in order to select suitable microorganisms , to find appropriate substrates from renewable and cheaper carbon source and to improve the fermentation and downstream processes in order to make phas more economically viable and competitive , comparable to conventional plastics [ 1 ] .
one of the limiting factors for the economic production of phas is the cost of feedstock , which contributes up to 40 % of the total operating costs [ 2 ] .
several successful studies have been reported on pha production from cheap and renewable carbon sources , for example , date syrup , mahua flowers , and palm oil mill effluent ( pome ) [ 3 - 5 ] .
ntaikou et al .
[ 6 ] reported that combined biohydrogen and biopolymers were produced from olive oil mill wastewater by two - stage reactor system with poly - 3 - hydroxybutyrate , p ( 3hb ) yield of 8.94 % per dry biomass weight .
the use of potential nonrenewable substrates could be useful in reducing the overall pha production cost .
apart from that , fermentation under nonsterile condition , for example , by using activated sludge treating wastewater , has gained interest recently as this process does not need reactor sterilization , and organic materials in wastewater can be considered a negative cost [ 7 ] .
p ( 3hb ) homopolymer and p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) copolymer are normally the main biopolymer products produced from wastewater .
this was because most of organic waste materials were converted into vfa during facultative / anaerobic degradation which is suitable for pha production [ 6 , 7 ] .
this approach sounds as an environmental and economic promising alternative in reducing total production of pha .
we have recently reported on poly ( 3 - hydroxybutyrate - co - 3 - hydroxyvalerate ) [ p ( 3hb - co - 3hv )] production from a locally isolated bacterium comamonas sp .
eb172 , which was successfully isolated from an anaerobic digester treating pome [ 8 - 10 ] .
this novel bacterium can accumulate pha when vfas from anaerobically treated pome were used as carbon sources [ 9 ] .
the potential of this microorganism to accumulate pha in various types of vfa and at different initial medium ph has been tested , and the physical and thermal properties of the polyesters produced from comamonas sp .
eb172 had also been reported [ 10 ] .
apart from our study , there is limited number of reports on the pha accumulation by comamonas species .
it has been reported that comamonas acidovorans was able to accumulate p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) and poly ( 3 - hydroxybutyrate - co - 4 - hydroxybutyrate ) [ p ( 3hb - co - 4hb )] copolymers under specific carbon and fermentation conditions [ 11 , 12 ] .
a study by thakor et al .
[ 13 ] showed that p ( 3hb ) homopolymer can be obtained from naphthalene by comamonas testosteroni under specific growth requirement .
since comamonas sp .
eb172 is a newly characterized strain , it is necessary to monitor the factors affecting fermentation conditions with respect to their growth , pha production , p ( 3hv ) incorporation in the copolymer , and the physical properties of the polymer produced , especially molecular weight .
previously , it has been reported that the molecular weight of the p ( 3hb ) produced from azotobacter chroococcum 6b was reduced by eightfold by increasing the carbon to the nitrogen ratio [ 14 ] .
in another report , quagliano et al .
[ 15 ] discussed the effect on the chain transfer agent present in the medium on the molecular weight of the p ( 3hb ) .
another study reported that the amount of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase played a key role in controlling the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the polymer [ 16 ] .
on the other hand , dennis et al .
[ 17 ] claimed that , in vivo , the molecular weight would not be a sole function of pha synthase activity but of the relation between pha synthase activity and substrate availability. from previous studies , there are several factors affecting the molecular weight and other properties of the pha ; however , reports on pha properties from comamonas sp. are very limited .
thus , the present study is aimed at determining the effect of carbon to nitrogen ratio and organic nitrogen source on the cell growth and p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) production by comamonas sp .
eb172 in 2 l fermenter by a ph - stat fed - batch cultivation using technical grade vfas .
the effect of nitrogen source on the molecular weight and mechanical properties of the copolymer produced is also clarified .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
bacterial strain , cultivation , and ph - stat fed - batch cultivation processing in 2 l fermenter the inoculum preparation , media composition , and cultivation conditions for comamonas sp .
eb172 are similar to those reported previously , unless otherwise stated [ 10 ] .
the pregrown cells from the growth stage ( 10 % v / v ) were transferred into 900 ml of mineral salts medium ( msm ) containing 3 g / l of technical grade vfa mixtures .
the msm composition is similar to that previously reported unless otherwise stated [ 9 ] .
the technical grade vfa solution with the concentration of 500 g / l was prepared from mixtures of acetic , propionic , and butyric acids at a ratio of 5 : 3 : 2 ( 250 g / l : 150 g / l : 100 g / l ) for feeding during ph - stat fed - batch fermentation .
the composition of the vfa mixtures mimicked the original ratio of acids obtained from anaerobically treated palm oil mill effluent ( pome ) .
the technical grade vfa mixtures ( with higher concentration ) were used instead of real vfas from pome ( normally produced at lower concentration ~ 100 g / l ) in order to increase the cell densities in the fermenter .
the initial medium ph was set at ph 7.0 with 2 m naoh .
there were two types of nitrogen sources that were used in this study .
( nh4 ) 2so4 was used as inorganic nitrogen source , and the carbon / nitrogen ratios ( c / n ) ( mol / mol ) were set at 5 , 15 , and 25 , respectively .
yeast extract ( 10 - 11 % of nitrogen in ye , merck , germany ) was used as organic nitrogen source and supplemented with the vfa mixtures at 20 g / l equivalent to c / n 34.4 ( mol / mol ) .
the fermentation processes were conducted in batch mode for 10 - 12 h before the ph - stat fed - batch process was applied .
the ph of the culture broth was maintained at ph 7.0 by feeding in the vfa mixture ( 500 g / l ) with c / n ratio mentioned earlier .
dissolved oxygen tension ( dot ) in the fermenter ( sartorius , germany ) was maintained at 40 % air saturation using cascade mode by gradually increasing the impeller speed .
the cultures were incubated at 30degreesc for 35 h for all experiments .
2.2 .
analytical procedures 2.2.1 .
microscopy observation both cell cultures from growth and pha accumulation stage were subjected to microscopic analysis .
negatively stained cells were subjected to physical morphology such as shape , size , and the presence of flagella .
scanning electron microscope ( sem ) was used for observation on the cell 's morphology changes during growth and accumulation stage .
thin section of the cells containing phas was prepared and observed under the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .
the preparation of the bacterial cell samples was described elsewhere [ 18 ] .
2.2.2 .
volatile fatty acids determination the volatile fatty acids concentration from the broth media was determined by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) ( shimadzu , lc - 10 as ) as being described previously [ 3 ] .
2.2.3 .
gas chromatography analysis pha content and composition of the lyophilized cells were determined by using gas chromatography ( agilent , model 7890a ) using id - bp1 capillary column , 30 x 0.32 x 0.25 mum ( sge ) .
a total of 20 - 25 mg of lyophilized cells were subjected to methanolysis in the presence of methanol and sulfuric acid in the ratio of 85 % : 15 % ( v / v ) .
the resulting hydroxyacyl methyl esters were then analyzed according to the standard method [ 19 ] .
2.2.4 .
pha extraction pha in the cells was extracted using solvent extraction method by using chloroform as solvent .
the extracted pha samples ( 0.5 - 1.5 g ) were soaked in 50 - 100 ml chloroform for 24 - 48 h and until completely dissolved .
films were prepared by a solvent - casting technique from chloroform solutions of the polymer using borosilicate glass petri dishes ( duran , germany ) as casting surfaces .
the films were dried until constant weight in a vacuum at room temperature .
all samples were stored at - 20degreesc until further analysis .
2.2.5 .
gel permeation chromatography analysis number average molecular weight ( m n ) and weight average molecular weight ( m w ) were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) .
the molecular weight of the polyester samples were measured by size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) on a tosoh hlc - 8120 gpc system with a refractive index ( ri ) detector at 40degreesc using tosoh tskgel super hm - m column and chloroform as eluent at 0.6 ml / min .
the sample ( 12 mg ) was dissolved in chloroform ( 2 ml ) , and the solution was filtered through a ptfe membrane filter with pore size 0.45 mum ( millipore , usa ) and dispensed into collection vials prior to injection by automatic sampler .
the samples were run in triplicates , and average values were recorded .
2.2.6 .
differential scanning calorimetry analysis the thermal properties of the polymer were determined by differential scanning colorimetry ( dsc ) ( ta instruments ) .
approximately , 5 - 7 mg of copolymer samples was weighed and heated from 20 to 200degreesc at heating rates 10degreesc / min and held for 1 min .
the first scan was conducted to eliminate the history of polymer properties .
the samples were then fast cooled from 200degreesc to - 30degreesc .
the second scan was to reheat the samples to 200degreesc at the same heating rates , and the second scan was used in evaluating the thermal properties of the copolymers [ 10 ] .
2.2.7 .
mechanical properties analysis the pha films with average 0.25 - 0.35 mm of thickness and 3.0 - 3.3 mm of width were prepared from 2.0 g of extracted pha samples .
the samples were cut into dumbbell shape using a dumbbell cutter ( die bs 6476 ) .
the thickness of the samples was measured using a thickness gauge .
the tensile strength and young 's modulus were determined by using instron universal testing machine ( model 4301 ) ( usa ) at 5 mm / min of crosshead speed .
the results obtained from the computer system ( using merlin software ) , such as stress , strain , and elongation at break , were recorded .
the results were expressed as a plot of tensile strength ( mpa ) and tensile modulus ( gpa ) .
mechanical tensile data were calculated from the stress - strain curves on an average of four specimens .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
microscopy observation of comamonas sp .
eb172 during growth and production stage the comamonas sp .
eb172 is rod in shape , 0.7 to 0.8 by 2.0 to 2.64 mum in size , actively motile by a multipolar flagellum and gram - negative bacterium ( figure 1 ( a )) .
thin section electron micrograph of the isolates revealed typical pha granules , which clearly showed the existence of intracellular pha in the cell during nitrogen depletion condition ( figure 1 ( b )) .
it was observed that the morphological shape of the isolates has changed affected by the several packs of granules accumulated in the cell bodies .
figure 1 ( c ) shows sem micrographs of the isolate comamonas sp .
eb172 under growth stage , and no pha accumulation was observed .
meanwhile , the shape of the cells obviously changed over 35 h fermentation periods ( figures 1 ( d ) - 1 ( e )) from smooth rod shape to bulge shapes .
the accumulation of pha granules in comamonas sp .
eb172 was greatly discussed earlier [ 18 ] ; however , to our knowledge , the physical changes of the cell observed by the sem have not been described yet .
the size of the cells increased 4 - fold in the accumulation stage compared to growth stage .
several comamonas strains have been reported to be capable of accumulating pha such as c. testosteroni , c. denitrificans , and c. composti [ 13 , 20 , 21 ] .
however , none of them showed promising industrial applicability for pha production .
3.2 .
effect of c / n on the cell growth and p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) production in the 2 l fermenter fed - batch cultivation of comamonas sp .
eb172 using different c / n ratios was performed , and the results are depicted in figure 2 .
two types of nitrogen sources were used in this study , that is , ( nh4 ) 2so4 and yeast extract .
the highest cell dry weight ( cdw ) formation was recorded at 14.5 g / l when 20 g / l of ye ( equivalent to c / n 34.4 ( mol / mol )) was supplemented in the feeding solution containing 500 g / l of technical grade vfa mixtures ( figure 2 ( a )) .
this was followed by c / n 5 ( mol / mol ) ( 9.5 g / l ) , c / n 15 ( mol / mol ) ( 8.1 g / l ) , and c / n 25 ( mol / mol ) ( 5.1 g / l ) .
it was obvious that these results showed that the cdw formation was influenced by the amount of nitrogen ( c / n 5 , 15 , and 25 ( mol / mol ) from ( nh4 ) 2so4 ) supplemented into the medium .
in contrast , comamonas sp .
eb172 showed the highest cdw formation when supplemented with yeast extract even though nitrogen supplementation was limited ( c / n 34.4 ( mol / mol )) .
the vfa uptake profiles of all experiments are shown in figure 2 ( b ) .
approximately , 40 ml (=~ 20 g ) of vfa was consumed when c / n 34.4 was applied to fermentation process .
it was observed that the vfa uptake was correlated to the cdw formation .
a different trend was observed on the remaining nh3 - n ( mg / l ) concentration in the broth solution after 30 h of the fermentation period ( figure 2 ( c )) .
nh3 - n concentration kept accumulating up to 1300 mg / l when c / n 5 ( mol / mol ) was supplemented to fermentation medium .
however , nh3 - n concentration from c / n 15 and 25 ( mol / mol ) was maintained at values 200 - 400 mg / l. the nh3 - n concentration was low when ye was used as nitrogen source and totally exhausted towards 17 h of the fermentation period .
the residual nh3 - n content in the fermentation broth is closely related to the cdw ( figure 2 ( a )) whereby increased cell concentration caused a decrement in nh3 - n content .
this can be explained by the consumption of nitrogen by the cells .
the residual nh3 - n kept accumulating in the medium supplemented with c / n 5 ( mol / mol ) due to the high nitrogen content in the feed solution and exceeded the optimum requirement from microbial uptake .
on the other hand , pha accumulation was detected as early as 10 h but was considered low ( less than 10 wt. %) in the log phase during the growth stage .
the highest pha accumulation was recorded at 53 ( wt. %) when c / n 15 ( mol / mol ) feeding solution was fed into the bioreactor ( figure 2 ( d )) .
this was followed by c / n 5 ( 48 wt. %) , ye ( 43 wt. %) , and c / n 25 ( 40 wt. %). from the results obtained , it is suggested that comamonas sp .
eb172 was a growth associate pha producer as pha was accumulated during growth stage .
this was supported by the high amount of remaining nh3 - n concentration when c / n 5 feeding solution was used .
other factors such as oxygen limitation will also trigger the accumulation of pha [ 13 , 22 ] .
our finding from the shake flask study showed that oxygen limitation has increased the accumulation of pha by comamonas sp .
eb172 ( unpublished data ) .
thus nitrogen and oxygen limitation factors may influence mechanism of polymerization of biopolymers in this microorganism .
optimization of carbon to nitrogen ( c / n ) is necessary in order to monitor the requirement of growth and pha accumulation in bacterial cells .
prior to this study , several inorganic and organic nitrogen sources were tested in shake flasks experiment. from the results obtained , ( nh4 ) 2so4 and yeast extract were the best inorganic and organic nitrogen sources , respectively , for pha accumulation ( unpublished data ) .
furthermore , our previous reports have shown that c / n 30 ( mol / mol ) was the best for accumulation of phb but no significant difference on the cells formation ( using ( nh4 ) 2so4 as source of nitrogen ) [ 9 ] .
thus yeast extract was used in order to increase the cells production as well as accumulation of pha .
several studies have shown that suitable c / n ratio is crucial for obtaining optimal growth and pha production yield [ 22 - 24 ] .
feeding solution with c / n 10 was fed at the first stage of growth and was followed with c / n 50 to promote accumulation of p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) by alcaligenes eutrophus using propionic acid and resulted in 64 g / l of cdw and 58 ( wt. %) of accumulation , respectively [ 23 ] .
comamonas sp .
eb172 seems to accumulate pha during growth stage ; thus it may be grouped in the same group as azotobacter beijerinckii and alcaligenes latus , which are known to be the growth associated pha producers [ 22 ] .
even though the accumulation of pha by comamonas sp .
eb172 was not restricted under nitrogen - rich medium , the introduction of nitrogen limitation in the second stage of a fermentation period may enhance the pha accumulation .
wang and lee [ 24 ] reported that p ( 3hb ) accumulation was enhanced by 27 % in a. latus when nitrogen limitation was imposed to culture medium .
c / n ratio is indeed an important factor in order to obtain higher biomass formation and pha accumulation as proven by the results from this study .
our current results showed that up to 14.6 g / l of cells could be obtained from 0.4 g / l inocula , which is better than our previous report ( 9.6 g / l of cells from 1 g / l of inocula ) [ 10 ] .
this finding shows the highest cell dry biomass obtained so far from a genus of comamonas with the ability to accumulate pha .
3.3 .
physical properties of p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) copolymer produced table 1 shows pha yield , number average molecular weight ( m n ) , polydispersity index , and mechanical properties of polymers produced using different nitrogen sources .
the highest conversion ( 0.25 g / g ) of the volatile fatty acids to pha was recorded when ye was used as the organic nitrogen source .
the results suggested that ye can be a suitable organic nitrogen sources for pha accumulation in comamonas sp. eb172 .
the m n and pdi ( m w / m n ) recorded for this study ranged from 622 to 838 x 103 da and 1.8 to 2.1 , respectively. from table 1 , it is seen that the m n of the copolymer varied with the concentration and types of nitrogen source used for the fermentation .
the polymer obtained from fermentation with ye as the organic nitrogen source resulted in polymer with the highest molecular weight value. from the results , it can be concluded that the m n of the copolymer is correlated with the bacterial growth and copolymer yield .
this is in agreement with quagliano and miyazaki [ 14 ] whereby the reduction in the molecular mass of p ( 3hb ) produced was as a result of the low biomass achieved during fermentation .
overall , the use of ye as the nitrogen source stimulated the bacterial growth ( figure 1 ( a )) , pha yield , and m n of the copolymer ( table 1 ) .
enhanced bacterial growth is expected when ye is used as the nitrogen source since ye is a complex medium that contains growth precursors .
this may increase the cells metabolism and cause the provision of higher substrate levels to the acetoacetyl - coa reductase , which , resulted in higher production d - 3 - hydroxyacyl - coa and hence higher molecular weights of copolymer being produced [ 17 ] .
this is supported by the yield of pha ( y p / s ) obtained during fermentation ( table 1 ) whereby it is seen clearly that there is positive correlation between y p / s and the m n of the copolymer .
the high yield of the copolymer produced is a direct consequence of the high production of p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) in the cell , which is believed to be contributed by the increased cell metabolism when ye was used as the nitrogen source .
we previously reported that the m n and pdi for p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) produced from comamonas sp .
eb172 were in the range of 153 - 412 x 103 da and 2.2 - 2.6 , respectively [ 10 ] .
our present study shows that it is possible to regulate m n and pdi of the copolymer by using different types of nitrogen sources .
the ability to control the molecular weight of the copolymer is an advantage in polymer processing as it offers a wide range of biopolymer applications .
meanwhile , the toughness and flexibility of the p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) produced by comamonas sp .
eb172 were recorded within the range of 13.2 - 14.4 mpa and 0.26 - 0.34 gpa , respectively , sharing similar properties to those of polyethylene ( table 1 ) .
the flexibility of the copolymers as shown by young 's modulus values seemed to be influenced by the incorporation of the 3hv monomer unit .
the p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) containing 8 mol % of the 3hv units showed the highest stiffness ( 0.34 gpa ) .
the study on the mechanical properties of the copolymer produced is important to provide information about the characteristics of the material prior to its use .
p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) produced from this study exhibited similar properties to those of petroleum - based polyethylene [ 25 ] , and this is in agreement with other previous reports [ 2 , 11 ] .
4. conclusion we may conclude that an acid tolerant comamonas sp .
eb172 has shown its ability to produce pha biopolymer using vfas derived from pome , making this strain a suitable candidate for industrial application .
our investigation on pha production by this bacterial strain revealed that cdw , pha yield ( gpha / gsubstrate ) , 3hv ( mol %) , molecular weight , and mechanical properties of the copolymer can be controlled by varying carbon to nitrogen ratio ( mol / mol ) and nitrogen source as well .
overall , the natural ability of the bacterium to utilize vfas for p ( 3hb - co - 3hv ) production and the opportunity to regulate the molecular weight and mechanical properties of the copolymer produced should render wide - range applications of pha biopolymers from comamonas sp. eb 172 .
continuous production of pha from vfas by activated sludge during anaerobic treatment of palm oil mill effluent should be carried out in the future .

chest x - ray showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio with a prominent left heart border .
she underwent transthoracic echocardiography in which a large cystic structure with compressive effect on the left ventricle was identified ( fig. 1a ) .
further evaluation by transoesophageal echocardiography proved the structure to be a large left atrial appendage aneurysm ( laaa ) ( 7.7 x 4.4 cm ) with a 1 cm entrance to the atrial cavity ( fig. 1b ) .
the patient underwent aneurysm resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. fig. 1c shows the resected aneurysm , which had a very thin wall .
the postoperative course was uneventful. fig. 1 a transthoracic four chamber echocardiogram showing the aneurysmal left atrial appendage with compressive effect on left ventricle , b transoesophageal echocardiogram obtained at mid - oesophageal level in 60degrees showing the left atrial appendage aneurysm , c intraoperative image showing the resected left atrial appendage aneurysm , la left atrium , laa left atrial appendage , lv left ventricle , ra right atrium , rv right ventricle laaa are rarely encountered and generally present with palpitations , chest pain , dyspnoea or thromboembolic events [ 1 ] .
the chronic cough could have been caused by the mechanical airway compression by laaa .
once diagnosed , surgery is warranted regardless of presence of symptoms .

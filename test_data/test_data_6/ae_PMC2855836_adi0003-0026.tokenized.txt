objective to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of ritonavir - boosted saquinavir 1000 / 100 mg twice daily administered as a 500 mg film - coated tablet in hiv - 1 - infected patients .
methods in this open - label , observational , 24 - week survey conducted in 8 european countries , eligible hiv - infected participants had been prescribed saquinavir / ritonavir in combination with other nonprotease inhibitor ( pi ) antiretroviral agents as part of their hiv treatment regimen .
the safety ( grade 3 or 4 adverse events [ aes ]) , tolerability ( by an investigator - reported subjective rating system ) , and efficacy ( the percentage of participants with < 50 and < 400 copies / ml hiv rna and change from baseline in mean cd4 + cell count ) were analyzed for the overall study population and 7 subpopulations .
results the enrolled population included 2122 participants with 1908 completing the study ; 44 ( 2.1 %) withdrew prematurely because of aes , including 7 nontreatment - related deaths .
there were 33 grade 3 or 4 aes in 29 ( 1.4 %) participants ; 7 aes in 7 ( 0.3 %) participants were considered treatment - related .
tolerability was reported to be " very good " or " good " in 42 % and 25 % of participants , respectively. from baseline to week 24 , the proportion of participants with hiv rna < 50 copies / ml increased from 31.2 % to 47.6 % and the proportion with < 400 copies / ml increased from 42.5 % to 61.4 % ; the mean cd4 + cell count increased by 75 cells / microl .
in the subpopulation analysis , the greatest efficacy benefits occurred in participants who were treatment - naive and in those not having received prior pi therapy .
conclusions treatment with the saquinavir 500 mg film - coated tablet resulted in few grade 3 or 4 aes and was well tolerated and effective in a broad population of patients .
bioavailability ritonavir safety saquinavir tolerability introduction the current u.s .
[ 1 ] and european [ 2 ] guidelines for the initial treatment of human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( hiv - 1 ) - infected patients recommend a regimen comprising 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( nrtis ) and either a non - nrti ( nnrti ) or a protease inhibitor ( pi ) as components of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) .
this recommendation is based on the considerable reduction in hiv - 1 - related morbidity and mortality since the introduction of haart [ 3 - 5 ] and in particular the established efficacy of pis [ 1,2 ] .
saquinavir mesylate ( sqv ; invirase ( r ) , roche , inc ) is a potent inhibitor of the hiv protease .
sqv has been approved by the european medicines agency ( emea ) and the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) for the treatment of hiv infection in combination with other antiretroviral ( arv ) agents .
available for oral administration as a 200 mg hard gelatin capsule and a 500 mg film - coated tablet [ 6 ] , the 500 mg formulation of sqv was developed to meet the need for a more simplified arv regimen with a reduced pill burden .
the 500 mg tablet and 200 mg capsule offer equivalent bioavailability when administered at doses of 1000 mg in combination with 100 mg ritonavir ( r ) [ 7 ] .
the efficacy and safety of sqv / r 1000 / 100 mg twice daily in combination with other arvs have been established in randomized clinical trials [ 8 - 10 ] .
however , while there are sufficient data on the treatment experience with the 200 mg sqv capsule [ 8,9 ] , experience with the use of sqv 500 mg tablets at the fda - and emea - approved dose is limited .
the rainbow survey was initiated to establish a large database of patients being treated with the sqv 500 mg tablet at the approved dose of 1000 mg in combination with r 100 mg twice daily to evaluate the safety profile of sqv / r and to assess treatment response , as measured by cd4 + cell counts and hiv viral loads , in different patient subpopulations .
methods study design and participants this was an open - label , multicenter , phase 4 observational cohort study of hiv - infected patients 18 years of age or older who had been prescribed sqv / r 1000 / 100 mg twice daily with nrtis or nnrtis as part of their hiv treatment regimen .
excluded were patients who had received previous treatment with sqv , who had simultaneous treatment with a pi other than sqv / r , who had sqv / r at doses other than 1000 / 100 mg twice daily , or who had nonadherence or poor compliance to sqv / r that may have resulted in survey data being deemed unreliable .
all participants were prescribed sqv 1000 as 2 x 500 mg tablets twice daily .
survey data were transcribed by the investigator from the patient chart into an internet - based crf system tri @ l - it. in cases in which participants were being treated prior to enrollment , data were collected both retrospectively and prospectively .
baseline ( before the first dose of sqv / r ) demographic characteristics , hepatitis status , arv history , laboratory data ( including hiv rna viral load , cd4 + count , and lipid levels ) , and clinical data were recorded as well as year of hiv diagnosis and current clinical disease stage and concomitant medications including lipid - lowering agents .
the following data were collected from any visits occurring up to 24 weeks after initiation of therapy and were classified into the applicable time frame ( weeks 2 - 8 , weeks 8 - 16 , and weeks 20 - 30 ) : hiv rna viral load , cd4 + cell count , dates of these measures , assays used and lower limit of detection , changes in concomitant medications including changes in or introduction to lipid lowering agents , unexpected and grade 3 and 4 adverse events ( aes ) and relationship to the study specific medication , adherence information , and results of hematology and biochemistry tests .
safety analyses included the monitoring of changes in the following laboratory parameters from baseline to last available value : fasting lipids , bilirubin , glucose , alanine transaminase , aspartate transaminase , gamma - glutamyltransferase , and the percentage of patients receiving lipid - lowering agents .
this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki in its revised edition ( edinburgh , scotland , 2000 ) and the guidelines of current good clinical practice .
local ethics committees approved the study protocol and documents relevant to their local regulatory requirements prior to recruitment to the survey .
written informed consent was obtained before any observational data were collected for inclusion in the survey .
the right to request withdrawal of data from the study was reserved at any time .
analyses the primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with a grade 3 or 4 ae. secondary endpoints included the percentage of participants with < 50 copies / ml and < 400 copies / ml hiv rna at week 24 and the increase in mean cd4 + cell count ( cells / microl ) from baseline to week 24 .
the efficacy analysis was based on the intent - to - treat population .
overall tolerability and efficacy ( very good , good , sufficient , insufficient , cannot be evaluated ) were assessed by the investigator at week 24 .
analysis of safety and efficacy was also undertaken for the following subpopulations : treatment - naive ; treatment - experienced but naive to pis ; switched from an alternative pi regimen ( boosted lopinavir [ lpv / r ] , atazanavir [ atv / r ] or fosamprenavir [ fapv / r ] , or other pis ) due to toxicity ; switched from a prior non - pi regimen due to toxicity ; infected with hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) ; prior treatment at any time with a regimen that included a pi ( lpv / r , azv / r , f / apv / r or other ) ; and prior treatment at any time with a regimen that did not include a pi. participants could be included in more than one subpopulation .
note that these categories are not mutually exclusive , ie , a participant could have received a prior treatment regimen that included a pi as well as one that did not include a pi. in addition , aes were analyzed according to gender , race / ethnicity , and country of residence .
adverse events , reported diseases , and medications were not coded but provided as listings of the original terminology .
participants who discontinued sqv / r treatment for any reason prior to week 24 were included in the survey as treatment failures .
a planned sample size of 2000 was selected as sufficient to gain representative information about treatment experience .
descriptive summary statistics were used in the analysis of this survey .
results participant disposition and baseline characteristics a total of 119 investigators at centers in austria , germany , latvia , the netherlands , poland , spain , switzerland , and the united kingdom enrolled 2309 participants between may 3 , 2005 and september 20 , 2007. of those enrolled , 2122 were eligible for analysis and were included in the " all participants " population ( figure 1 ) .
the 187 participants not included in the analysis comprised : ( i ) 11 german participants and 49 polish participants , countries where the recruitment date was extended beyond the original date of february 28 , 2007 ; all participants recruited later than february 28 , 2007 were excluded from the global analysis but included in the local trial analyses ; ( ii ) 21 spanish participants and 23 participants from the united kingdom who were screened but ineligible ; and ( iii ) 80 german participants , one hispanic participant , and two polish participants were included in the tri @ l - it system but were either not marked as authorized for analysis by the investigator or excluded from analysis due to other documentation failure .
patients not marked as authorized for analysis were those for which the investigator did not complete the online data entry confirmation .
figure 1 participant disposition (" all participants " population ) .
since the recruitment phase of the survey was extended in germany and poland , participants from these countries who were enrolled after february 28 , 2007 , were not included in the global analysis .
in addition , no overall evaluation of tolerability was available for those from centers in germany since they were to be treated for longer than 24 weeks .
the number of participants in each subpopulation is presented in table 1 .
in total , 78 % were men with a majority ( 86 %) being caucasian ; the mean age was 43 years ( table 2 ) .
the median baseline plasma hiv rna viral load was 700 copies / ml , and the median cd4 + cell count was 323 cells / microl .
the mean time since hiv diagnosis was 9 years ( range : 0 - 35 years ) .
in the " all participants " population , 31 % had < 50 copies / ml hiv rna at baseline compared to only 1.5 % of the treatment - naive participants. of the 2122 participants initially enrolled , 1908 completed the study .
reasons for premature withdrawal by subpopulation are shown in table 3 .
while the percentages of participants withdrawn due to aes ( including nocturia , diarrhea , opportunistic infections , gastrointestinal intolerability , myocardial infarction , death , pneumococcemia , pregnancy , exanthema , vertigo , hyperglycemia , cachexia , erectile dysfunction , progression of lymphoma ) were similar across treatment groups , there was a disproportionate percentage of participants lost to follow - up in the treatment - naive and hcv coinfection subgroups ; the reasons for this are not known .

the incidence of aes was comparable between men and women ( 6.7 % vs. 7.4 %) and across ethnicities .
the highest occurrence of aes by country was reported for participants from spain while the lowest incidence ( 0.8 %) was reported in those from poland .
the investigators rated the tolerability of sqv 500 mg as " very good " in 42 % of participants , " good " in 25 % , " sufficient " in 4 % , and " insufficient " in less than 2 % ( table 6 ) .
no information about the evaluation of tolerability was available for 463 ( 22 %) participants because they continued to be followed in the subcohorts and subjective analysis was not carried out until the subjects left the survey .

an increase in cd4 + cell count was also seen during the survey period in 523 / 734 ( 71 %) of participants in the overall population having cd4 + cell count determinations ( table 8 ) .
the largest increase in cd4 + cell count ( 138 cells / microl ) and the highest proportion of participants achieving an increase in cd4 + cell count ( 92 %) occurred in the treatment - naive subpopulation .

discussion this observational survey demonstrated that treatment with the 500 mg film - coated tablet of sqv was well tolerated and effective in hiv - infected participants .
not only was there a very low incidence of grade 3 or 4 aes , investigators rated the tolerability of the regimen as " very good " or " good " in 67 % of their participants .
a comparison of the efficacy across subpopulations showed that the majority had a favorable response to treatment , with those who were treatment - and pi - naive deriving the most benefits .
this is to be expected since these subpopulations would be most susceptible to a new regimen or to the addition of a new class of agent .
there were certain limitations to this survey , including its open - label design and its subjective assessment of tolerability ( which could have biased the results ) and the short duration of follow - up of 24 weeks .
still , the lack of blinding or of a control regimen was unlikely to bias the laboratory - based virologic efficacy endpoints .
furthermore , it was not possible to control for the variability in arv regimens and populations across study sites .
however , the value of this survey is its " real - world " clinical setting , which increases the level of heterogeneity of the enrolled participants and the concomitant arv therapies .
these results compare favorably with those of a recent study that showed that at 24 weeks , approximately 60 % of trial nonparticipants ( those in prospective , population - based cohort studies ) achieved a viral load < 500 copies / ml when initiating treatment with one of three pi - based regimens [ 11 ] .
in contrast , at 24 weeks randomized controlled trial ( rct ) participants had a much higher efficacy ( approximately 75 %) .
the authors suggested that reasons for this may include the strict inclusion criteria for rct participants , the trial setting ( better outcome in high - volume centers ) , and more frequent monitoring or stronger adherence incentives .
in addition , a significantly higher percentage of rct participants were arv - naive at baseline compared to trial nonparticipants ( 57 % vs. 44 % , respectively ) [ 11 ] .
the gemini study [ 10 ] , an open - label , randomized , 48 - week study , established the noninferior efficacy of using the sqv 500 mg tablet at approved doses ( sqv / r 1000 / 100 mg twice daily ) compared to lpv / r , both in combination with once - daily tenofovir / emtricitabine , in treatment - naive hiv - infected participants .
the proportions of patients with hiv rna levels < 50 copies / ml were 64.7 % and 63.5 % for the sqv / r and lpv / r treatment groups , respectively ( estimated difference in proportion for noninferiority : 1.14 % , 96 % confidence interval : - 9.6 , 11.9 ; p < 0.012 ) ; triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the lpv / r group at week 48 .
the present study showed that in both treatment - naive and treatment - experienced patients , oral sqv 500 mg was effective and well tolerated with a more convenient and practical dosing regimen than prior sqv - containing regimens .

abstract background aberrant motor function is an integral part of schizophrenia .
in fact , abnormalities are frequently found in patients , in populations at risk , and in unaffected relatives .
motor abnormalities are suspected to be relevant for the clinical outcome and could probably predict the conversion from at - risk individuals to schizophrenia .
furthermore , motor function and has been argued as endophenotype of the disorder .
yet , which particular motor domain may classify as a potential endophenotype is unknown .
we aimed to compare schizophrenia patients , unaffected first degree relatives and healthy controls for different motor domains .
we expected impairments in all domains in patients and in some domains in relatives .
methods we included 43 schizophrenia patients , 34 unaffected first degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and 29 healthy control subjects , matched for age , gender and education level .
we compared motor function of five domains between the groups .
the domains comprise neurological soft sings ( nss ) , abnormal involuntary movements ( dyskinesia ) , parkinsonism , complex fine motor function applying the coin rotation task as well as finger tapping .
furthermore , we tested the association of motor function of the five domains with working memory , frontal lobe function and nonverbal intelligence for each group separately using within - group bivariate correlations .
results schizophrenia patients showed poorer motor function in all tested domains compared to healthy controls .
first - degree relatives had intermediate ratings with aberrant function in two motor domains .
in detail , relatives had significantly more nss and performed poorer in the finger tapping task than controls .
in contrast , in relatives complex fine motor function was intact .
relatives did not differ from controls in dyskinesia or parkinsonism severity .
discussion taken together , schizophrenia patients have motor abnormalities in all tested domains .
thus , motor abnormalities are a key element of the disorder .
likewise , first degree relatives presented motor deficits in two domains .
a clear difference between relatives and healthy controls was found for nss and finger tapping .
thus , nss and finger tapping may be a potential marker of vulnerability for schizophrenia .
the lack of association between genetic risk and dyskinesia or parkinsonism suggests distinct pathobiological mechanisms in the various motor abnormalities in schizophrenia .

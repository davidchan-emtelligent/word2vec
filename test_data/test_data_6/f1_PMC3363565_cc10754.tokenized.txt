to treat acidosis , sodium bicarbonate is often used ; however , its application has some side effects .
in this situation tris - hydroxymethyl aminomethane ( tham ) seems to be more effective .
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tham for treating metabolic acidosis after surgery - associated hemorrhage in pediatric oncology .
methods the observational study included 50 children aged 12 months to 16 years ( among them 27 boys ) with metabolic acidosis after surgery - associated hemorrhage : 40 % patients lost 58 +/ - 8.5 % of total blood volume , 26 % lost 150 +/ - 9.5 % of total blood volume .
patients received 3.66 % tham infusion .
the dose of tham infusion was calculated as the dose administered ( ml ) : negative standard be ( mmol / l ) xkg body weight , and did not increase 1.5 ml / kg body weight every 24 hours .
the following were analyzed : na + , k + , ionized calcium , lactate , ph , pco2 , hco3 and be of arterial blood , before therapy , and after receiving a one - half dose and a full dose of tham .
the significance of differences was assessed by student 's t test , mann - whitney coefficient and chi - square test ; p < 0.05 was considered statistically valid .
results there were no differences in the concentrations of electrolytes and lactate .
at the stages of the research the following significant dynamics have been noted : ph ( 7.27 +/ - 0.01 ; 7.31 +/ - 0.01 ; 7.35 +/ - 0.01 ; p < 0,01 ) , hco3 ( 18.59 +/ - 0.26 ; 19.5 +/ - 0.3 ; 21.2 +/ - 0.41 mmol / l ; p < 0.01 ) and be ( - 8.34 +/ - 0.3 ; - 6.58 +/ - 0.37 ; - 4.47 +/ - 0.45 mmol / l ; p < 0.01 ) .
paco2 tension did not change significantly ( 38.9 +/ - 0.83 ; 37.3 +/ - 0.94 ; 37.5 +/ - 0.95 mmhg ; p > 0.05 ) .
conclusion tham infusion resulted in metabolic acidosis correction without the development of hypernatremia and increase of co2 tension .
however , the small number of observations does not allow one to assess accurately the clinical effect of tham for these patients .

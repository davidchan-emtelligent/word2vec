introns in protein - coding genes are very rare in hemiascomycetous yeast genomes .
it has been suggested that these species have experienced extensive intron loss during their evolution from the postulated intron - rich fungal ancestor .
however , no intron - devoid yeast species have been identified and some of the introns remaining within the genomes of intron - poor species , such as saccharomyces cerevisiae , appear to be beneficial during growth under stress conditions .
in order to reveal the pattern of intron retention within intron - poor yeast species and better understand the mechanisms of intron evolution , we generated a comprehensive set of 250 orthologous introns in the 20 species that comprise the saccharomycetaceae , by analyzing rna deep - sequencing data and alignments of intron - containing genes .
analysis of these intron sets shows that intron loss is at least two orders of magnitude more frequent than intron gain .
fine mapping of intron positions shows that intron sliding is rare , and that introns are almost always removed without changing the primary sequence of the encoded protein .
the latter finding is consistent with the prevailing view that homologous recombination between reverse - transcribed mature mrnas and the corresponding genomic locus is the primary mechanism of intron loss .
however , we also find evidence that loss of a small number of introns is mediated by micro - homology , and that the number of intron losses is diminished in yeast species that have lost the microhomology end joining and nonhomologous end joining machinery .
intron loss yeast fungi introduction the origin and evolution of introns in eukaryotic genomes are intensively debated topics ( rogozin et al. 2012 ) .
two long - standing theories have been proposed to describe the origin of introns : the " introns early " and " introns late " hypotheses .
these theories placed the origin of introns before and after the eukaryota - prokaryota split , respectively ( doolittle 1978 ; stoltzfus et al. 1994 ) .
more recently , the " introns first " hypothesis , building on the " rna world " concept , has attributed the origin of introns to self - splicing rna molecules that were evolutionary forerunners of protein - coding rnas ( poole et al. 1998 ) .
almost all known eukaryotes possess at least a few introns and the machinery required to splice them .
however , it is generally considered unlikely that the eubacteria and archea ancestors ever possessed a spliceosome ( stoltzfus et al. 1994 ) .
the current consensus therefore is a version of the introns late hypothesis : that introns evolved early within the eukaryotic lineage ( rogozin et al. 2012 ) .
the most likely scenario is that the emergence of spliceosomal introns from founder group ii self - splicing introns happened shortly after the endosymbiosis of the protomitochondrial bacteria by the archeal host ( martin and koonin 2006 ) .
however , neither the introns early nor introns first theories have been conclusively discounted ( penny et al. 2009 ) .
analyses of intron distribution among different eukaryotes have pinpointed a surprisingly high percentage of shared intron positions in orthologous genes ( fedorov et al. 2002 ; rogozin et al. 2003 ) .
because some introns are present in the same positions in genes in plants , animals , and fungi , these studies concluded that they must have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor .
additionally , intron loss appears to be more common than gain throughout eukaryotic evolution .
in particular , a study restricted to fungal introns ( stajich et al .
2007 ) hypothesized an intron - rich fungal ancestor , from which extensive intron loss has occurred in the hemiascomycetous yeasts .
indeed , there is very little evidence of intron gain in any lineage , but this is likely , at least in part , to be due to the difficulty in detecting such events .
for example , in mammalian genomes , no unambiguous intron gains have been identified ( roy et al. 2003 ) .
a study of nematode introns found evidence for 122 gains ( coghlan and wolfe 2004 ) , but later sequencing of multiple worm species identified orthologous introns that push the intron origins further back in time ( roy and penny 2006 ) .
more recently , strong evidence for intron gain has been obtained using closely related fungal species ( torriani et al .
2011 ) and sequenced isolates of daphnia pulex ( li et al. 2009 ) .
both of these studies identify a number of unique , transient introns that have not yet been fixed within their respective populations .
various mechanisms of intron loss and gain have been proposed ( fig. 1 ) .
the most plausible intron loss mechanism is homologous recombination between reverse - transcribed mature mrna and the genomic locus ( mourier and jeffares 2003 ) .
this model is attractive in that it can explain the visible bias of intron position toward the 5 ' - end of genes of intron - poor species .
it has also been proposed that introns might be lost by " genomic deletion ," which involves enzymes from nonhomologous - and microhomology - mediated end - joining dna repair ( nhej and mmej ) .
it was initially assumed that intron loss promoted by double - strand breaks ( dsb ) would lead to imprecise intron deletions ( roy and gilbert 2005 ) but it was since noted that the presence of ag | gt consensus in both 5 ' - and 3 ' - splice sites could serve as a microhomology and thus facilitate exact intron deletion ( hu 2006 ; farlow et al. 2011 ; van schendel and tijsterman 2013 ) .
although the number of observed intron gain events is low , various mechanisms have been suggested to explain them , including insertion of a group ii intron ( martin and koonin 2006 ) , exon intronization ( gao and lynch 2009 ) , intron retrotransposition ( torriani et al. 2011 ) , and dsb repair ( li et al .
2009 ). fig. 1. - - postulated mechanisms of intron loss and gain .
simplified mechanisms of loss ( a ) and gain ( b ) are presented .
genomic contexts are represented as gray boxes , exons in dna as light green boxes , exons in rna as dark green , and introns as thin lines joining exons .
the resulting gene structure for each mechanism is framed in red .
note that the nhej / mmej - mediated mechanism does not necessarily lead to perfect intron gain or loss ( not shown ) .

hemiascomycetous yeast belong to one of the best - studied eukaryotic clades , frequently used for comparative and evolutionary studies ( cliften et al. 2001 ; dujon et al. 2004 ; gordon et al. 2009 ) .
the clade can be divided into three groups : early branching yeast species such as yarrowia lipolytica , the " ctg group ," which translates ctg as serine instead of leucine , and saccharomycetaceae , which includes saccharomyces cerevisiae .
the ancestor of s. cerevisiae underwent a whole - genome duplication ( wgd ) , followed by extensive loss of one copy of most paralogous genes ( wolfe and shields 1997 ) .
all hemiascomycetous yeast have experienced extensive intron loss , and on average introns are found in only 5 % of their genes ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
introns in s. cerevisiae have been well annotated due to the extensive efforts of the yeast scientific community ( saccharomyces genome database [ sgd ]) .
however , introns in most other yeast species are poorly annotated , and intron analyses therefore rely either on automatic annotation or small manually curated sets of intron orthologs .
this impedes the estimation of intron number and subsequent evolutionary studies .
nonetheless , even with limited intron information , interesting evolutionary observations have been made for the saccharomycotina subphylum .
for example , hemiascomycetous yeasts contain only the u2 spliceosome ; all the components specific to u12 spliceosome have been lost in the ascomycota ( russell et al. 2006 ; bartschat and samuelsson 2010 ) .
unlike in mammals , the intronic elements involved in splicing obey a strict consensus sequence pattern in saccharomycetaceae : gtatgt for the 5 ' - splice site ( 5 ' - ss ) , tactaac for the branch point ( bp ) ( bon et al .
2003 ) , and the 3 ' - splice site ( 3 ' - ss ) always finishes in ag. however , yeasts lack the usual poly - t track between the bp and 3 ' - ss ( irimia and roy 2008 ) ; instead the 3 ' - ss is defined by the distance from bp , which can vary between species ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
neuveglise et al .
( 2011 ) suggested that the bp - 3 ' - ss distance is constrained by the u2af1 splicing factor , and that species that have lost u2af1 , such as s. cerevisiae , candida glabrata , and kluyveromyces lactis , exhibit a longer bp - 3 ' - ss distance .
in this study , we present a comprehensive evaluation of intron evolution in the saccharomycetaceae by exploiting the high - quality orthologous relationships provided by the yeast gene order browser ( ygob ) ( byrne and wolfe 2005 ) , together with rna deep - sequencing data .
we constructed multiple sequence alignments of 235 intron - containing genes in 20 saccharomycetaceae species in order to determine the exact fate of each intron - containing gene after the wgd .
we found that intron loss events are at least two orders of magnitude more common than gains .
intron loss appears to be branch - and species - specific , and is usually " perfect ," suggesting that loss has resulted from replacement of the original intron - containing gene with the intron - less cdna .
furthermore , we found clear examples of intron loss accompanied by insertion of additional codons , at least one case of intron sliding , and we have shown that the uncoupling of snornas from introns of some genes was enabled by wgd .
lastly , an analysis of intron conservation in ribosomal protein genes among 12 tested species allowed us to draw conclusions about how ribosomal protein gene ( rpg ) intron function might have evolved .
we discuss the prominent mechanisms of evolution of yeast introns in relation to our findings .
materials and methods rnaseq saccharomyces cerevisiae strain by4741 , saccharomyces kudriavzevii , and naumovia castellii were cultured in standard ypd media in 30 degreesc and saccharomyces uvarum ncyc 2669 at 28 degreesc with shaking at 200 rpm , to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. rna of s. cerevisiae was extracted using trizol ( invitrogen , uk ) , precipitated in lithium chloride ( ambion , uk ) , washed twice with 70 % ethanol and the pellet resuspended in dh2o .
rna of the other three species was extracted using qiagen rna extraction kit according to manufacturer 's instructions .
ten micrograms of total rna from each s. cerevisiae , s. kudriavzevii , s. uvarum , and n. castellii was processed with the ribominus transcriptome isolation kit for yeast and bacteria ( invitrogen ) to deplete the rrna .
cdna libraries for each species were constructed and sequenced using the solid 4.0 system from life technologies according to the standard manufacturer 's protocol .
saccharomyces cerevisiae cdna was deposited on one - quadrant of a slide with one other barcoded library ( not presented here ) .
the other three libraries were barcoded and deposited on one - quadrant of a slide .
sequencing yielded a total of 77,286,181 reads for s. cerevisiae , 23,993,647 reads for s. uvarum , 6,287,432 reads for s. kudriavzevii , and 7,909,274 reads for n. castellii , all of 50 bps .
raw reads were filtered to obtain only reads with an average quality > 20 using the approach described by sasson and michael ( 2010 ) .
reads were mapped to genomes downloaded from ygob version 7 with bowtie 0.12.7 ( allowing up to two mismatches , and retaining only reads mapping to one location in the genome : - v 2 - m 1 ) .
splice junctions were identified using tophat with default parameters and defined intron size between 49 and 1,050 bp ( - i 49 - i 1050 ; representing the minimum and maximum lengths of introns in s. cerevisiae genes according to sgd , release 64 ) ( trapnell et al. 2009 ) .
the rnaseq data are deposited in the gene expression omnibus database ( accession number gse58884 ) .
intron alignments annotations for 306 introns in 286 genes for s. cerevisiae were extracted from sgd ( http :// www.yeastgenome.org / , release 64 , last accessed september 1 , 2014 ) .
the orthologs of the intron - containing genes in the s. cerevisiae clade were retrieved from the ygob pillar file ( http :// ygob.ucd.ie / , version 7 , last accessed september 1 , 2014 ) ( byrne and wolfe 2005 ) , which presents the gene homology among species .
in order to obtain alignments of intron - containing genes , we first used sequences for s. cerevisiae , saccharomyces mikatae , s. kudriavzevii , and s. uvarum to create a seed alignment with mlagan ( brudno et al .
2003 ) , and then manually edited it using ralee ( griffiths - jones 2005 ) to ensure the correct alignment of both splice sites and bps .
dna seed alignments were used to search for intron - containing genes in all other ygob species using hmmer 3.1b1 ( wheeler and eddy 2013 ) .
briefly , hmmbuild was used to build the profile hmm from sequence alignments , and then nhmmer was used to search the profile against a dna database containing all sequences from ygob .
lists of hits were manually inspected , and potential matches were extracted and aligned against the seed alignment using hmmalign .
an iterative procedure of hmmer search , alignment , manual inspection , and editing allowed us to construct full gene alignments , with annotated intron boundaries and bps .
these alignments allowed us to confirm intron presence , perfect deletion , or imperfect deletion resulting in the removal or insertion of additional codons .
where the alignment did not allow us to conclusively prove intron presence , we assumed the intron was removed by an unknown mechanism and , thus , counted it as an intron loss for the subsequent phylogenetic analysis .
in the cases where a significant portion of a gene sequence was missing from the assembly , the specific gene sequence was excluded from the alignment and subsequent analysis .
to detect orthologs of intronic snornas , we extracted the portion of each intron alignment that corresponded to a snorna annotation in s. cerevisiae ( sgd ) .
we then used the resulting alignments as seeds for iterative hmmer searches as described above .
we analysed the sequence surrounding the potential snorna matches to establish if they are encoded within introns of paralogous genes .
lastly , we used syntenic information provided by ygob to establish if the snorna hits lie in regions paralogous to those included in the seed alignment .
phylogenetic analysis syntenic relationships between intron - containing genes were extracted from ygob .
paralogous genes arising from wgd were grouped to represent one ancestral gene , and multiple introns in the same gene were treated separately .
the phylogenetic tree used to map intron gains and losses was taken from ygob ( simplified version from hedtke et al. 2006 ) .
an additional branch reflecting the wgd loci was added creating a tree with both a and b loci for all post - wgd species .
for the analysis of each intron alignment , the tree was pruned to include only the species found in that alignment .
for each ancestral intron , gains and losses were placed automatically on the pruned yeast tree using the dollo parsimony method ( farris 1977 ) implemented in the dollop script from the phylip package .
all assignments were manually inspected .
we assumed that the common ancestor had almost all introns currently present in tested species ( stajich et al. 2007 ) .
we therefore manually inspected all assigned intron gains , and 3 out of 11 were converted into losses on alternative branches of the tree .
after the event assignment was complete , we summed up all the instances of intron loss and gain on a simplified tree without the duplicated branch , so that each branch in post - wgd species represents a sum for corresponding branches in a and b loci .
results conserved splicing in saccharomyces sensu stricto species we used rna deep sequencing experiments to annotate intron positions in s. cerevisiae , s. kudriavzevii , s. uvarum , and n. castellii .
we predicted splice junctions from rnaseq data using tophat , and confirmed the presence of the canonical splice signals ( gtatgt / ag ) and bp ( tactaac ) sequences that are indicative of saccharomycetaceae introns .
we found 216 , 163 , 200 , and 155 predicted introns in s. cerevisiae , s. kudriavzevii , s. uvarum , and n. castellii , respectively. of these , three introns in s. cerevisiae , four in s. uvarum and ten in n. castellii are novel - - not present in the latest annotation in sgd - - although some have been previously experimentally validated ( table 1 ) .
novel introns in n. castellii are not present in saccharomyces sensu stricto genomes : eight appear to have been lost through cdna replacement and two are located in the out - paralogs of s. cerevisiae rpl29 and rpl39 genes .

next , we counted the reads spanning each identified junction in s. cerevisiae and compared the number with the orthologous junctions of three other species .
we found strong correlations between normalized junction read counts within the saccharomyces sensu stricto group , indicating similar number of spliced transcripts ( fig. 2a ) .
comparing the numbers of reads mapped to each intron among the various species revealed an even stronger correlation between species ( fig. 2b ) .
these results provide preliminary evidence that intron splicing and expression is generally highly conserved among the saccharomyces sensu stricto species , but more specific investigation of levels of intron splicing is warranted. fig. 2. - - conservation of intron splicing and expression in rnaseq data .

pearson 's product - moment correlation and p value are shown above each graph .
identifying orthologous introns we built multiple sequence alignments of intron - containing genes using the annotated gene set from s. cerevisiae ( sgd ) and introns predicted from the rnaseq data obtained for s. cerevisiae , s. uvarum , and n. castellii .
we extracted the orthologous genes from ygob and investigated the presence of introns for those species in which the host genes were present .
manual refinement of these alignments highlighted five additional unannotated introns in genes hop2 , cgi121 , ypr170w - b , ypr153w , and ypl109c , of which only the hop2 intron is present in s. cerevisiae ( the hop2 intron is not yet in sgd , but was recently described by chan et al. [ 2014 ]) .
thus the total number of ancestral intron sites used for the subsequent phylogenetic analysis was 250 .
the number of introns identified in each species is shown in table 2 .
we found 15 more introns in c. glabrata than estimated previously ( dujon et al. 2004 ; gabaldon et al .
2013 ) , a similar number in zygosaccharomyces rouxii and in k. lactis , and around 75 % of those previously predicted in eremothecium gossypii , lachancea kluyveri , and lachancea thermotolerans ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
because we focused on introns with orthologs in s. cerevisiae , it is expected that we identify only a subset of the introns annotated in the more distant species .

based on the multiple sequence alignments of intron sequences ( see supplementary material online ) we investigated the differences in the distance between the bp and the 3 ' - splice site ( referred to as the s2 distance ) among 20 species .
as reported previously , we found increased s2 distances in c. glabrata , k. lactis and to lesser extent in saccharomyces sensu stricto , kazachstania sp. and naumovozyma sp. all those species have lost the u2af1 splicing factor postulated to be correlated with short s2 distances ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
however , vanderwaltozyma polyspora , tetrapisispora phaffii , and tetrapisispora blattae also have a median s2 distance higher than 30 despite possessing the u2af1 gene ( fig. 3a ) .
we examined the u2af1 gene and protein structure in detail , and found that t. blattae and t. phaffii are the only species without the intron splitting the initial cysteine codon of the first zinc finger domain .
the t. blattae and t. phaffii u2af1 proteins also contain 105 and 60 amino acid insertions , respectively , but maintain all crucial domains ( fig. 3b ) .
the v. polyspora u2af1 gene contains the intron in the typical position and does not have extensive insertions .
it was previously suggested that the loss of the u2af1 protein might be responsible for increased s2 distance ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
our data show that this is not the case , at least in the vanderwaltozyma - tetrapisispora group .
a causal relationship between u2af1 loss and increased s2 distance is therefore unproven , but our data are consistent with an increased s2 distance allowing u2af1 to be lost in some species , rather than vice versa. fig. 3. - - s2 distance and u2af1 gene conservation .

intron gain and loss across the 20 species and 235 ancestral genes , there were total of 5,553 " intron sites ," defined as sites that could contain an intron based on the presence of an intron at that position in at least one other species .
in total , 1,168 of these intron sites are without an intron ( 0.21 introns missing per site per species ) and 4,385 contained an intron ( fig. 4 , supplementary table s1 , supplementary material online ) .
the majority of missing introns ( 825 / 1,168 , 71 %) left the gene replaced with its cdna version ( adding or deleting a maximum of two codons , fig. 5a ) .
there were 33 instances in 14 genes when intron removal was accompanied by a deletion or insertion of 3 - 40 codons .
we found one clear case of intron sliding in the rps22b gene in eremothecium cymbalariae , e. gossypii , and k. lactis , where the 5 ' - utr intron has been moved into the open reading frame ( orf ) and is present after the initial a ( fig. 5b ) .
finally , 310 additional introns , mainly in 5 ' - utrs , appear to have been lost , but the mechanism of loss is unclear. fig. 4. - - heatmap showing intron evolution within ygob species .

in order to understand better the evolutionary history of each intron , we placed intron gain and loss events on a phylogenetic tree using dollo parsimony , and refined those placements by manual inspection .
we found 630 evolutionary events of intron loss in 205 introns , with 159 introns lost more than once .
evidence for intron gains was much sparser : we identified only eight potential gain events in eight distinct genes .
introns in the 5 ' - utr of both mcr1 and mtr2 were only present in s. cerevisiae .
the mrk1 intron was only found in saccharomyces sensu stricto .
an additional intron in the ypl109c gene has been gained in l. thermotolerans and l. kluyveri .
we were able to identify divergent orthologous introns in gcr1 , usv1 , yjr112w - a , and an additional intron in rps22b , in closely related species only , and thus it is unclear if these should be considered true gains .
we conclude that intron gain events in yeast species occur at least two orders of magnitude less frequently than intron loss events .
for 38 ancestral introns , all extant host genes in all species tested also contain an orthologous intron .
nineteen of those introns were found in rpgs .
some branches of the species tree have experienced more extensive intron loss than others ( fig. 6 ) .
candida glabrata has the highest apparent number of intron losses in this analysis : of 266 genes orthologous to intron - containing genes in other species , c. glabrata contains only 144 introns .
additionally , c. glabrata appears to retain only one copy of each intron - containing gene after wgd ( fig. 4 ) , in contrast with other post - wgd species .
previous phylogenetic analyses placed v. polyspora , tetrapisispora phaffii , and t. blattae most distant of the post - wgd species from s. cerevisiae ( hedtke et al. 2006 ; scannell et al. 2007 ) .
our results show v. polyspora , tetrapisispora phaffii , and t. blattae have also experienced higher than average numbers of intron loss events .
however , intron losses are not exclusive to post - wgd species , as exemplified by z. rouxii , in which we identify 38 fewer introns than the sister species torulaspora delbrueckii .
at the other end of the spectrum , l. kluyveri has nine introns missing , with seven of them likely to be gains in other species and only one loss by an unknown mechanism on the l. kluyveri branch ( figs. 4 and 6 ). fig. 6. - - tree displaying mapped intron gains and losses in ygob species .

branches with more than 20 losses and species with more than 40 losses are displayed in red .
the percentages on the right represent the proportion of genes with lost introns .

( 2006 ) .
evolutionary history of intronic snornas it has been observed that introns containing functional noncoding rnas are usually well conserved across a broad evolutionary range ( chorev and carmel 2013 ) .
our analysis highlights examples where introns encoding snornas have been lost .
we therefore investigated the conservation of intronic snornas in more depth , taking into account wgd .
we found that after wgd , one genomic copy of the protein gene carrying intronic snornas was retained in 64 out of 84 cases across all genomes , preserving both the intron and the snorna ( fig. 7a ) .
we found only 13 cases where an intron encoding a snorna was lost from the host gene .
only in the case of snr191 in the nog2 gene of naumovozyma dairenensis did intron loss lead to snorna removal from the genome .
kazachstania africana has lost the same intron , but an additional copy of snr191 is present in a region non - paralogous to nog2 .
in the five cases where the intron encoding the snorna was lost , the snorna was retained within the intron of the paralogous gene , and for another six cases a copy of snorna was present in the paralogous region but without the associated protein - coding gene ( fig. 7b ) .
this last mode of gene loss with retention of the intronic snornas was previously described as " snorna deintronization " and has been shown to be common in the evolution of snorna genes in the saccharomycetaceae ( mitrovich et al. 2010 ). fig. 7. - - evolution of intronic snornas .

conservation of ribosomal protein introns introns in rpgs have been implicated in maintaining the correct expression ratio of paralogous mrnas in s. cerevisiae ( parenteau et al. 2011 ) .
it is well known that introns in ribosomal protein genes in s. cerevisiae are longer on average than introns of any other protein class ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ; parenteau et al. 2011 ) .
we found 59 ancestral rpg introns in 56 cytoplasmic and 2 mitochondrial rpgs .
the unusual nature of rpg introns is also reflected in the number of intron gains and losses : 105 losses for 59 ancestral introns across the 20 species , corresponding to 0.07 introns lost per locus in each species ( compared with 0.21 for all introns ) .
there are only two cases where the rpg appears to be lost from the genome - - mrpl44 in t. blattae and rpl30 in lachancea waltii .
mrpl44 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein and s. cerevisiae knockout mutants are viable , although with decreased competitive fitness .
the rpl30 protein is essential in s. cerevisiae and additionally has a regulatory feedback loop residing on exon - intron boundary .
how l. waltii compensates for the loss of this crucial 60s ribosome component remains to be discovered .
in the s. cerevisiae genome , 47 of the intron - containing rpgs have a paralogous copy .
interestingly , in saccharomyces sensu stricto , paralogs of intron - containing ribosomal proteins always have the paralogous intron as well ( fig. 8a ) .
this result , together with the strong conservation of spliced transcript number and intron expression ( fig. 2 ) , suggests that the function of rpg introns is conserved across saccharomyces sensu stricto .
however , outside the saccharomyces sensu stricto , there are multiple instances of the loss of one of the paralogous copies of a ribosomal protein gene .
candida glabrata and t. blattae show particularly striking patterns : in 51 and 48 out of 59 ancestral introns respectively , only one copy of the rpg is retained , but all retained copies preserve the intron .
in contrast , n. castellii and n. dairenensis nearly always retain the duplicated ribosomal protein genes together with their introns .
in other post - wgd species there is a varied degree of conservation of both ribosomal protein genes and introns .
the only intron retained in both copies in 18 out of 20 genomes was in the paralogous rps9a / b gene pair .
rps9a / b splicing has been reported to autoregulate the host genes not only in s. cerevisiae but also in drosophila melanogaster ( plocik and guthrie 2012 ) , thus it is not surprising that the presence of both intron - containing rps9 copies is required in yeast .
among pre - wgd species , the most prone to lose introns from rpgs was z. rouxii , with 26 introns missing out of an ancestral 59 .
it is also the only species where the number and length of rpg introns do not differ from other introns ( fig. 8b ) .
in summary , distinctive patterns for rpg intron conservation in different species lead us to conclude that the unusual characteristics of rpg introns are not shared by the whole saccharomycetaceae , and are probably restricted to the saccharomyces sensu stricto species. fig. 8. - - introns in ribosomal protein genes .

discussion intron evolution is branch - and species - specific this work represents a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of introns in the saccharomycetaceae .
it was previously proposed that hemiascomycetous fungi have undergone extensive intron loss ( stajich et al. 2007 ) .
the species in the saccharomycetaceae continued to lose introns even after the divergence from ctg species and early branching species like y. lipolytica ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) .
we observed that specific species and branches have undergone additional intron loss compared with s. cerevisiae .
candida glabrata has experienced a particularly high number of intron losses and is an extremely intron poor species .
this is consistent with the postulated reductive evolution of the c. glabrata genome , and the extensive loss of paralogous genes , both likely consequences of its pathogenic mode of life ( dujon et al. 2004 ) .
intron loss has also been particularly high in some other clades , both that diverged before and after the wgd event : the zygosaccharomyces clade ( represented here by z. rouxii ) and the vanderwaltozyma clade ( represented by v. polyspora ) ( souciet et al. 2009 ) .
in contrast to c. glabrata and z. rouxii , which have undergone reductions in genome size , v. polyspora has a similar genome size and gene number to s. cerevisiae ( scannell et al. 2007 ) .
we therefore suggest that increased gene density is neither sufficient nor necessary for increased intron loss in yeast .
prevalent intron loss provides insight into mechanisms of deletion our results show that introns are usually lost with very high precision , with at most two codons inserted or deleted at the intron - exon boundaries .
both microhomology - mediated intron loss and reverse transcription of spliced mrna and homologous dna recombination ( mourier and jeffares 2003 ) can lead to the replacement of intron - containing genes with their intronless versions .
all yeast species exhibit a 5 ' - bias in intron positions ( bolotin - fukuhara et al .
2006 ) , a bias only explained by homologous recombination between cdna and gene ( mourier and jeffares 2003 ) .
we therefore assume that homologous recombination is responsible for the majority of intron losses that accompanied the divergence of yeasts from other fungi .
outside the saccharomyces sensu stricto , individual species have lost between 15 % and 46 % of their introns , except for the lachancea clade , where 7 % of the introns tested appeared to have been lost on average .
the most extreme case of intron retention is l. kluyveri for which we observe a total of nine introns missing , seven of which are probably intron gains in other species .
interestingly , l. kluyveri has undergone an unprecedented loss of the proteins mediating nhej and mmej pathways of dna repair ( gordon et al. 2011 ) .
the closest relatives , l. waltii and l. thermotolerans , contain all genes involved in nhej / mmej , and we observed 13 events of perfect intron deletion .
we therefore hypothesize that the inability of l. kluyveri to remove introns by replacement of the gene by the cdna may be due to the loss of the nhej / mmej pathways .
this observation is consistent with previously proposed models of precise intron loss mediated by nhej / mmej ( hu 2006 ; farlow et al. 2011 ; van schendel and tijsterman 2013 ) .
against the background of intron loss by homologous recombination in the yeast ancestor , the data therefore suggest that the microhomology - mediated end joining pathway may have contributed to intron loss within recent clades of hemiascomycetes .
imperfect intron removal can alter the encoded protein and thus contribute to the landscape of protein evolution .
we found 33 cases of insertion or deletion of more than three codons associated with intron loss - - these might be due to an imperfect intron removal mechanism , such as degeneration of splice signals and subsequent deletions with preservation of the reading frame phase , or imprecise intron removal by nhej / mmej pathway .
we observed intron sliding only in the rps22b gene .
our results therefore indicate that imperfect intron removal events are rare , with only around 2.6 % of intron losses resulting in addition or deletion of more than three codons .
intron evolution patterns after whole - genome duplication we analyzed in detail the evolutionary history of the eight intronic snornas present in s. cerevisiae .
mitrovich et al .
( 2010 ) postulated that intronic snornas have been " deintronized " in the saccharomycotina clade through mutation of the boundary exons such that the snornas have been conserved while eliminating the protein - encoding genes .
our evidence suggests that wgd can facilitate this process .
in post - wgd species , protein - coding and intronic snorna genes have subfunctionalized , leading to retention of the intronless version of the gene at one duplicated locus , and retention of the snorna gene and loss of the protein - coding gene at the other .
besides deintronization of snornas , single intron loss after duplication was also common , and other variations on modifying or decoupling protein and rna genes were also observed ( fig. 7 ) .
ribosomal protein genes appear to have a distinct mode of intron evolution .
it has been previously noted that in s. cerevisiae , rpgs are enriched in introns and the introns are longer than for other classes of genes ( rodriguez - medina and rymond 1994 ; spingola et al. 1999 ) .
the increased number and size of rpg introns have also been observed for c. glabrata , k. lactis , and e. gossypii ( neuveglise et al. 2011 ) , and in all species besides z. rouxii in this study , thus it is a feature that is pertinent to both pre - and post - wgd species .
however , the degree of conservation of rpgs and introns varies among post - wgd species .
we speculate that saccharomyces sensu stricto retained most of the duplicated rpgs , and subsequently evolved a distinct mechanism regulating their expression .
accordingly , we observe a strict retention of rpg introns within saccharomyces sensu stricto species .
candida glabrata and t. blattae may have coped with the duplication of rpgs by reverting to the preduplication state in which only one of the rpg paralogs is retained .
all species usually maintain at least one intron - containing copy of each rpg , with the exception of z. rouxii , which exhibited increased intron loss .
zygosaccharomyces rouxii is a halotolerant and osmotolerant species responsible for food spoilage .
it was reported previously that s. cerevisiae introns contribute to the fitness in challenging stress conditions , so it would be expected that those introns would be kept in z. rouxii , which is frequently exposed to stress concentrations of salt and sugar .
we therefore hypothesise that z. rouxii has developed other mechanisms to increase its tolerance to stress , and the greater loss of introns observed for z. rouxii is due to relaxation or removal of the constraints on intron maintenance .
we conclude that rpg introns have been preferentially kept in yeast genomes .
it is likely that the introns perform different functions in different species .
for example , in the saccharomyces sensu stricto , the introns are probably regulating the level of rpg mrnas , as reported by parenteau et al .
( 2011 ) , but in z. rouxii their functional importance is decreased .
conclusions our multiple sequence alignments of orthologous introns in saccharomycetaceae provide an unprecedented resource for the study of intron evolution in intron - poor genomes .
their analysis , together with rnaseq data , allows us to identify hundreds of previously unannotated introns in yeast species .
we provide direct evidence for postulated mechanisms of yeast intron evolution .
in particular , our data strongly support the prevalence of precise intron loss by homologous recombination of mature mrna and genomic locus , but also nhej / mmej - mediated intron loss , in the recent history of saccharomycetaceae .
the complexity of organism - , gene - and intron - specific factors that affect intron fate are only just beginning to be understood .

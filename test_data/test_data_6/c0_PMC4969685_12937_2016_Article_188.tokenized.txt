background not only is glutamine deficiency an independent predictor of mortality in intensive care unit ( icu ) patients , but glutamine supplementation is also recommended for its proven outcome benefits .
however , recent data suggest that early glutamine supplementation in certain patient groups increase mortality .
the aim of this study was to investigate plasma glutamine levels of adult icu patients in the south african setting and to determine relationships between glutamine levels , gender , diagnostic categories and selected inflammatory markers .
the data from this study will be used as baseline measurement to support a large scale study that will be undertaken in the south african icu population .
methods this cross - sectional , analytical study included 60 mixed adult icu patients within 24 h post icu admission .
plasma glutamine levels were determined on admission .
the relationship between glutamine levels , interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and c - reactive protein ( crp ) ; as well as gender - and diagnosis - related differences in glutamine levels were also investigated .
a non - parametric roc curve was computed to determine the crp concentration cut - off point above which glutamine becomes deficient .
results the median plasma glutamine level ( 497 mumol / l ) was in the normal range ; however , 38.3 % ( n = 23 ) of patients had deficient (< 420 mumol / l ) and 6.7 % ( n = 4 ) had supra - normal glutamine levels (> 930 mumol / l ) .
no significant difference could be detected between glutamine levels and gender or diagnosis categories as a group .
when only the medical and surgical categories were compared , the median plasma glutamine level of the medical patients were significantly lower than that of the surgical patients ( p = 0.042 ) .
glutamine showed inverse associations with crp levels ( r = - 0.44 , p < 0.05 ) and il - 6 concentrations ( r = - 0.23 , p = 0.08 ) .
a crp cut - off value of 95.5 mg / l was determined above which glutamine levels became deficient .
conclusions about a third of patients ( 38 %) were glutamine deficient on admission to icu , whereas some presented with supra - normal levels .
while glutamine levels correlated inversely with inflammatory markers , and a crp value of above 95.5 mg / l indicated potential glutamine deficiency , the clinical application of this finding needs further investigation .

it is currently applied in various clinical settings to improve patient outcomes [ 1 ] .
glutamine , the most abundant non - essential amino acid , is the most - researched pharmaconutrient to date [ 2 ] .
previous studies showed decreased levels of plasma and muscle glutamine in selected critically ill , post - surgical , multiple trauma , burns , septic and general intensive care unit ( icu ) patients [ 3 - 5 ] , resulting in the classification of glutamine as a " conditionally essential amino acid " under certain circumstances .
glutamine deficiency and , therefore , its unavailability to perform important functions contributes to an inappropriate response to stress and injury , ultimately leading to an increased icu and post - icu mortality risk .
glutamine supplementation has been extensively studied for its contribution to the improvement of patient outcomes .
until recently , it has been deemed safe and effective in a variety of patient groups , including the severely ill , burns and surgical patient [ 6 - 9 ] .
outcome benefits such as reductions in length of hospital stay ( lohs ) , length of icu stay , mortality risk and infectious complications , as well as an improvement in nitrogen balance , was previously reported , depending on the specific patient group as well as the dose and route of administration [ 6 - 9 ] .
the reducing deaths due to oxidative stress ( redoxs ) study questioned the safety and applicability of glutamine supplementation in all patient groups .
in this study an increased mortality risk was found when supplementing multiple organ failure ( mof ) patients with high dosages of enteral and parenteral glutamine within 24 h after icu admission [ 10 ] .
in a sub - sample of this study only 31 % of patients were glutamine deficient (< 420 mumol / l ) while 15 % had supra - normal levels (> 930 mumol / l ) .
moreover , rodas et al .
[ 11 ] found that a u - shaped curve represents the association between glutamine and mortality , where both low (< 420 mumol / l ) and high (> 930 mumol / l ) levels were associated with a higher mortality risk .
it is , therefore , important to determine the glutamine status of patients in order to determine those requiring supplementation and those where supplementation may cause harm .
in order to do this , it would be ideal to measure plasma glutamine levels of all patients prior to supplementation , but it is not routine practice in most clinical settings .
furthermore , no south african ( sa ) based data are available on plasma glutamine levels in the icu setting .
consequently , identifying markers , which could aid in detecting patients in need of glutamine supplementation or those where glutamine is contraindicated , has become a priority .
the main aim of this study , was to examine plasma glutamine levels of sa adult icu patients on day one of admission .
in addition , the influences of gender and different diagnostic categories on glutamine status were investigated .
previously a relationship between inflammation and glutamine levels has been reported .
more specifically , an inverse association between interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and glutamine were established [ 12 , 13 ] .
this is also the case for the inflammatory marker c - reactive protein ( crp ) and amino acids [ 14 ] .
therefore , the relationship between glutamine levels and selected inflammatory markers , crp and il - 6 , were investigated to confirm earlier findings on il - 6 and to determine whether a relationship with crp exist .
the findings of this research study will be used as baseline data for a larger sa based study conducted in 2016 .
methods study design and setting this observational cross - sectional study was performed at two icu settings in the north west province , sa. the units are both mixed icus , consisting predominantly of medical patients , but also admitting surgery and trauma patients .
the study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and ethical approval was obtained from the north - west university human research ethics committee ( nwu - 00186 - 13 - s1 ) ; the policy , planning , research monitoring and evaluation committee of the north west department of health ; and the patient safety groups of both hospitals .
informed , voluntary consent to participate in the study was obtained from all participants or their legal proxy .
patients all adult patients (> 18 years ) admitted to the icus of the two participating hospitals during the study period ( march to august , 2014 ) were eligible for inclusion , provided they met the following criteria : informed consent obtained and blood sampling conducted within 24 h post - icu admission .
patients excluded were those receiving total parenteral nutrition with added glutamine prior to blood sampling ; those receiving glutamine - enriched enteral feeding , high protein or amino acid - based oral supplements prior to blood sampling ; and those who were pregnant or lactating. from the admission records of the hospital , a dropout analysis was performed to identify the characteristics of the patients admitted to the icu during the study period , but not included in the study .
blood sampling and laboratory analysis venous blood samples were taken within 24 h following icu admission .
plasma samples for glutamine and il - 6 analysis were collected in ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid ( edta ) tubes and centrifuged within 30 min at 3000 x g for 15 min ( 4 degreesc ) .
plasma was then stored at - 80 degreesc within one hour post - sampling and for no longer than 30 days , pending analysis .
plasma glutamine levels were determined by an adapted method of the ez : faast amino acid analysis procedure ( phenomenex , torrance , ca , usa ) for the analysis of free physiological amino acids , using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( hewlett packard hp 6890 series gas chromatography system , palo alto , ca , usa and agilent 5973 n mass selective detector , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
plasma glutamine levels of below 420 mumol / l were classified as deficient and above 930 mumol / l as supra - normal [ 11 , 15 ] .
il - 6 was measured by means of the il - 6 quantikine enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) , using the thermofisher scientific multiskan fc ( vanta , finland ) .
for the purpose of this research , il - 6 levels below 10 pg / ml were regarded as normal [ 16 ] .
for the determination of crp concentrations , serum gel tubes were prepared for analysis by centrifuging samples at 4000 rpm for 20 min .
analysis was conducted by means of the sequential multiple analyser computer , using the beckman coulter dxc880i ( beckman coulter , ireland ) .
a reference crp concentration of below 5 mg / l was regarded as normal , whereas mild inflammation , active and severe infection were classified according to 10 - 49 mg / l , 50 - 200 mg / l and > 200 mg / l respectively [ 17 , 18 ] .
statistical analysis the computer software package ibm spss ( r ) statistics 22 ( statistical package for social sciences , ibm , ny , usa ) was used for statistical analysis .
a p - value of <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
non - parametric data were log - transformed to improve normality and are reported as geometric means and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
normally distributed data are reported as means ( 95 % ci ) , and data that are still non - parametric following log transformation , as medians [ 25th - 75thpercentiles ] .
a mann - whitney u test were used to compare the median plasma glutamine level difference between genders .
the influence of different diagnoses on plasma glutamine levels was examined by using the kruskal - wallis analysis of variance ( anova ) with the bonferroni adjustment .
in order to determine the relationship between plasma glutamine levels and inflammatory markers , the spearman rank test was used .
other variables that could influence the levels of plasma glutamine , were included in the statistical models using analysis of covariance ( ancova ) .
a receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve was computed to determine the crp cut - off value at which glutamine becomes deficient .
results during the study period 60 icu patients were included in this study .
the baseline characteristics of the patients are presented in table 1 .

a non - significant difference was found comparing the median plasma glutamine levels of female and male patients ( p = 0.116 ) , and between the different diagnostic categories ( medical , surgery , trauma ) ( table 2 ) .
the inability to demonstrate a difference between the groups was possibly related to the statistical power , as very few trauma patients were admitted to the icus during the study period .
however when excluding the two trauma patients , a significantly lower median glutamine level was found in the medical patient group compared to the surgical group ( p = 0.042 ) ( after adjusting for age ). of the 42 medical patients included , 42.8 % had deficient plasma glutamine levels , whereas this was true for only 25 % of the surgical group ( table 2 ) .
one patient in the medical group and three of the patients admitted for surgical reasons had supra - normal plasma glutamine levels .
table 2 elaborates on these conditions .
additionally , the association between plasma glutamine levels and inflammatory markers ( crp and / or il - 6 levels ) was investigated .
a trend towards an inverse association could be found between plasma glutamine levels and il - 6 ( r = - 0.23 , p = 0.08 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
after adjusting for age by means of a partial correlation , the correlation remained insignificant .
however , a significant inverse association was demonstrated between crp and plasma glutamine levels ( r = - 0.44 , p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 2 ). fig. 1 relationship between plasma glutamine and interleukin - 6 levels ( r = - 0.23 , p = 0.08 ) fig. 2 relationship between plasma glutamine and crp levels ( r = - 0.44 , p < 0.05 ) .
crp , c - reactive protein a non - parametric roc curve was computed to determine the crp level cut - off point at which plasma glutamine levels became deficient ( fig. 3 ) .
the optimal cut - off was obtained from the youden index value at 95.5 mg / l [ sp ( specificity ) = 69 % , sn ( sensitivity ) = 62.2 % , auc ( area under the curve ) : 0.759 ( 95 % ci 0.653 ; 0.865 ) , p < 0.0001 ]. of the patients that had crp values above 95.5 mg / l ( n = 25 ) , 74 % had plasma glutamine levels below 420 mumol / l. fig. 3 the receiver operating characteristic curve , computing the c - reactive protein level above which glutamine becomes deficient .
area under curve ( auc ) : 0.759 ( 95 % ci 0.653 ; 0.865 , p < 0.0001 ) the il - 6 and crp values were also categorised to present the plasma glutamine levels visually in different categories of inflammation ( figs. 4 and 5 ) .
it was evident that the majority of patients with normal il - 6 levels (< 10 pg / ml ) , i.e. , without inflammation , also had normal plasma glutamine levels .
on the other hand , those with inflammation presented with lower plasma glutamine levels , especially those in the 150 - 500 pg / ml il - 6 and 50 - 200 mg / l crp groups .
in the hyper - inflammatory groups ( il - 6 > 500 pg / ml and crp > 200 mg / l ) the glutamine levels were scattered , ranging from very high to very low plasma glutamine levels. fig. 4 plasma glutamine levels presented per interleukin - 6 category .

gln , glutamine ; crp , c - reactive protein discussion this study aimed to establish the plasma glutamine levels in a group of mixed icu patients .
it is important as the measurement of glutamine levels is currently not readily available , expensive and impractical in most hospital settings .
this research serves as a pilot study for a larger study to be conducted in the sa setting , which will further elaborate on plasma glutamine levels throughout icu stay , taking into account severity of illness as well as nutritional status of the patients .
in order to obtain a representative sample of a real - life icu population , all patients admitted to the chosen icus during the study period were eligible for inclusion .
the median plasma glutamine level of this icu population ( 497 mumol / l [ 387 - 644 mumol / l ]) was in the normal range , with 38.2 % categorised as glutamine deficient .
this is comparable with findings by oudemans - van straaten et al .
[ 15 ] , indicating a median icu admission level of 495 mumol / l ( interquartile range 350 - 600 mumol / l ) together with other research reporting that 31 to 43 % of icu patients had deficient glutamine levels on day one of icu admission [ 11 , 15 , 19 ] .
the mechanism whereby glutamine becomes depleted is attributed to its translocation from the muscle to supply increased utilisation rates by vital splanchnic organs [ 20 ] .
finally , de novo synthesis may decrease and be insufficient to meet increased demands , resulting in glutamine depletion [ 20 - 22 ] .
low plasma glutamine levels are possibly life threatening , as they reflect the unavailability of glutamine to fulfil its important functions .
in addition , deficient admission plasma glutamine levels are an independent predictor of increased icu and post - icu mortality rates [ 11 , 15 ] .
supplementing patients who are not glutamine deficient may pose a risk , as rodas et al .
[ 11 ] reported a u - shaped curve association between plasma glutamine levels and mortality .
in this study , only 6.7 % of patients had supra - normal plasma glutamine levels .
similarly , heyland et al .
[ 19 ] reported supra - normal admission levels in 15 % of mof , icu patients .
other studies also found high levels in selected patients [ 11 , 15 ] .
both modest and very high plasma glutamine levels are attributed to organ failures , such as renal and acute liver failure [ 11 , 23 - 25 ] .
in this study group , however , only one of the acute liver failure patients had a glutamine level above 930 mumol / l. nevertheless , the two other liver failure patients had chronic liver failure , which is thought to rather lead to glutamine deficiency .
when considering diagnostic categories , it was difficult to distinguish differences between the glutamine statuses .
in a recent study it was found that 60 % of trauma icu patients presented with deficient plasma glutamine levels prior to glutamine supplementation [ 5 ] .
in the current study no conclusion could be drawn as to how trauma , as primary diagnosis , influenced glutamine levels , due to the few trauma patients included .
almost half of those admitted for medical reasons had deficient levels on icu admission .
they also had significantly lower glutamine levels than surgical patients .
diabetes , was previously thought not to influence glutamine status [ 26 , 27 ] .
interestingly , however , when investigating the patients admitted for medical reasons in further detail , the majority of diabetic patients had deficient admission levels .
on the other hand some of the included patients with renal - , liver , mof and sepsis , as determined by clinical history , physical findings and blood cultures , had deficient and normal glutamine levels , contrary to previous reports of elevated levels to be expected in these patients [ 19 , 28 ] .
earlier research suggested that a positive hiv status cause reduced plasma glutamine levels due to secondary infections and an increased need to maintain immune balance [ 29 ] .
findings in the current study showed that hiv reactive patients predominantly had normal glutamine levels .
this could be ascribed to the fact that the inflammatory response of the hiv positive patients in this study were lower than expected , since there were no statistically significant difference between hiv positive and negative individuals with regard to either crp ( p = 0.271 ) or il - 6 levels ( p = 0.654 ) .
it should be mentioned that hiv status was not tested , but only recorded if already diagnosed , and the disease progression was not documented .
nevertheless , this was not the typical glutamine profile that one would expect .
regarding post - surgery patients , reduced plasma glutamine levels have been well established as a characteristic of their amino acid profile [ 3 , 30 , 31 ] .
in the current study , more than half of the surgery patients presented with normal glutamine levels .
however , the degree to which levels are affected may be related to the severity , complexity , and duration of the surgery , which was not within the scope of this study [ 31 ] .
these findings stress the difficulty to make assumptions on glutamine status based only on the patient 's diagnosis .
other factors that may have influenced plasma glutamine levels were also considered .
in earlier studies , plasma glutamine levels were found to be significantly associated with gender in healthy individuals [ 32 ] .
however in this study no significant gender - related difference could be detected in the glutamine levels of patients .
it confirms findings by viggiano et al .
[ 31 ] , who similarly reported gender not to influence glutamine levels post - operatively .
the current research further indicates , in support of previous findings , that a definite relationship between plasma glutamine and inflammation exists .
two well - known inflammatory markers , il - 6 and crp , were measured .
il - 6 , described as an early marker of inflammation , drives inflammation , causing the release of crp and other markers of the acute - phase response .
it is also a predictor of the severity of the injury and major complications [ 33 ] .
a trend towards an inverse association was found between plasma glutamine and il - 6 levels .
this is supported by earlier studies reporting a negative association between il - 6 and glutamine [ 12 , 13 ] .
crp is an inflammatory marker frequently measured in the hospital setting .
suliman et al .
[ 14 ] reported an inverse association between crp and amino acids .
parenteral glutamine supplementation has further been found to significantly reduce crp concentrations [ 34 , 35 ] .
in the current study an inverse association was found between crp and glutamine levels ( p < 0.05 ) .
a cut - off point of 95.5 mg / l was determined as the crp value above which glutamine levels can potentially be expected to become deficient .
this is a novel finding and can possibly be used in the identification of patients at risk for glutamine deficiency .
when interpreting the plasma glutamine levels grouped per category of crp values , it is clear that the lower glutamine levels are evident in patients with crp levels that fall in the 50 to 200 mg / l crp value group ( fig. 5 ) .
however , those with crp values above 200 mg / l presented with a different profile , since a range of plasma glutamine levels could be found in this group ( fig. 5 ) .
this again shows that it is difficult to predict patients that present with deficient plasma glutamine levels by employing single biomarkers alone , due to the high variability within icu patient groups .
it could be postulated that those with the highest crp values , have more co - morbidities and hence the presence of mof amongst this group is a reality .
the latter situation is regarded as a contra - indication for glutamine supplementation [ 10 , 36 ] .
again the number of samples analysed in this study may be too small to draw any firm conclusions on the exact crp cut - off value , and the inclusion of more samples in future studies may provide clear - cut results .
this study had certain limitations .
as an observational study , its results reflect only the population included in the study and cannot be extrapolated to all icu settings .
together with this , calculating the patient 's severity of illness scores are not routinely done in the participating hospitals and could , therefore , not be reported .
body composition measurements were not taken into account in the interpretation of data .
furthermore , as the main aim of the study was to determine plasma glutamine levels on admission to the icu , glutamine determination was measured only once .
a recent study reported that low glutamine levels later during icu stay correlated with infection rates , length of icu stay and lohs [ 5 ] .
determination of plasma glutamine during the course of the icu stay might , therefore , yield better prognostic results and needs to be investigated further .
conclusion this study found glutamine deficiency in 38 % of patients in a mixed icu .
medical patients had significantly lower plasma glutamine levels , but no gender - related differences could be found .
a significant inverse association was found between plasma glutamine and crp levels , with a cut - off crp value of 95.5 mg / l above which glutamine levels may become deficient. whether this can be translated into a clinical recommendation regarding the use of crp as proxy marker in the determination of the need for glutamine supplementation , is questionable and a larger sample size may be required to better conclude on this .
these results , therefore , support earlier findings , which refuted a one - size - fits - all approach with glutamine supplementation .
based on the current literature and the findings of this study , clinicians should consider the holistic profile of the patient , including the patient condition and other biomarkers ( e.g. , crp ) when selecting patients for glutamine supplementation .
this research further contribute baseline measurements for a larger follow up study investigating the plasma glutamine levels of icu patients at different time points during icu stay and comparing them to patient outcome .

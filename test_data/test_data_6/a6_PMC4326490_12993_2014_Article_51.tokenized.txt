background aluminum overload can cause severe brain injury and neurodegeneration .
previous studies suggest that prostacyclin synthase ( pgis ) expression and prostacyclin receptor ( ip ) activation are beneficial for treatment of acute traumatic and ischemic brain injury .
however , the potential value of pgis / ip signaling pathway to chronic brain injury is still unclear .
in this study , we investigated the change of pgis / ip signaling pathway and the effect of beraprost sodium ( bps ) on chronic brain injury in chronic aluminum - overload rats .
methods rat model of chronic cerebral injury was established by chronic intragastric administration of aluminum gluconate ( al3 + 200 mg / kg per day,5d a week for 20 weeks ) .
the methods of elisa , qrt - pcr and western blotting were used to detect the pgi2 level and the pgis and ip mrna and protein levels in hippocampi of chronic aluminum - overload rats , respectively .
rat hippocampal superoxide dismutase ( sod ) activity and malondialdehyde ( mda ) content also were measured .
the effects of bps ( 6 , 12 and 24 mug.kg - 1 ) on brain injury in chronic aluminum - overload rats were evaluated .
results compared with the control group , pgis mrna expression , pgi2 level , and the ip mrna and protein expressions significantly increased in hippocampi of chronic aluminum - overload rats .
administration of bps significantly improved spatial learning and memory function impairment and hippocampal neuron injury induced by chronic aluminum overload in rats .
meanwhile , administration of bps resulted in a decrease of pgi2 level and downregulation of pgis and ip expressions in a dose - dependent manner .
aluminum overload also caused a decrease of sod activity and an increase of mda content .
administration of bps significantly blunted the decrease of sod activity and the increase of mda content induced by aluminum overload in rats .
conclusions bps has a significant neuroprotective effect on chronic brain injury induced by aluminum overload in rats .
remodeling the balance of pgis / ip signaling pathway and inhibition of oxidative stress involve in the neuroprotective mechanism of bps in aluminum - overload rats .
the pgis / ip signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for chronic brain injury patients .
keywords chronic brain injury beraprost sodium pgi2 level pgis ip receptor issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background aluminum , which accounts for about 8 % of the earth crust mass , is the most widely distributed metal in air , water and soil and is extensively used in modern daily life .
therefore , we unavoidably take in aluminum by various routes .
however , the physiological action of aluminum to humans is not clear .
it is well known that aluminum overload can cause severe brain injury and neurodegeneration since the aluminum toxicity to humans was first reported at early 1970s .
in particular , aluminum was detected in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) patients , indicating that aluminum neurotoxicity may be involved in the pathogenesis of ad [ 1,2 ] .
despite some debated studies , the majority of scholars think there is a close relationship between aluminum exposure and the risk of developing ad [ 3 ] .
aluminum could play a role in chronic brain damage and neurodegeneration by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation [ 4 ] .
however , the mechanism of aluminum neurotoxicity is not well understood and should be further clarified .
proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha , interleukins ( ils ) and transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta make large contributions to the neuroinflammatory response in patients with chronic brain injury .
il - 1 and tnf - alpha can activate many cerebral signaling pathways including the arachidonic acid ( aa ) metabolic cascade [ 5 ] .
under the action of cyclooxygenase ( cox ) , aa can be converted to bioactive prostaglandin ( pg ) h2 .
pgh2 serves as the substrate for multiple specific prostaglandin synthases ( pgs ) and can be metabolized to pgd2 , pge2 , pgf2a , pgi2 or thromboxane ( tx ) a2 .
cox has at least two isoforms , the constitutive cox - 1 and the inducible cox - 2 .
cox - 1 is prominently expressed in microglia of human brain [ 6 ] .
cox - 2 is highly expressed in the neuronal cell bodies and dendritic regions of hippocampus , cerebral cortex , and amygdale .
cox - 2 can be rapidly induced following traumatic brain injury , acute cerebral ischemia , seizures , and neurodegeneration [ 7 ] .
our previous studies also demonstrate that aluminum significantly induced brain injury and cox - 2 overexpression , and the cox - 2 inhibitor protected against chronic brain injury in rats [ 8 ] .
however , celecoxib and naproxen could neither prevent ad nor improve cognitive function of ad patients in some randomized trials [ 9,10 ] .
a further clinical trial shows that therapeutic effects of nsaids differ at different stages and cox inhibitors have serious adverse effects at later stages of ad [ 11 ] .
despite the failed clinical treatment trial and the terminated prevention trial for nsaids , the specific cox downstream signaling pathway has become a focus in neurological research to observe its potential therapeutic values for modification of chronic brain injury and for avoidance of the toxicities of nsaids .
prostacyclin , also known as pgi2 , is derived from pgh2 under the action of prostacyclin synthase ( pgis ). through acting mainly on the membrane - bound prostacyclin receptor ( ip ) , pgi2 and its analogues play lots of physiological and pharmacological functions .
combined gene transfer of cox - 1 and pgis could increase pgi2 level and decrease cerebral infarct volume in rats with ischemic reperfusion [ 12 ] .
administration of pgi2 significantly reduced the cortical lesion of rats with traumatic brain injury [ 13 ] .
ip knockout mice developed more severe cortical lesion than wild type mice [ 14 ] .
these studies suggest that activation of ip is beneficial for acute cerebral ischemic insult and traumatic brain injury .
however , the pgi2 level , and the mrna and protein expressions of pgis and ip in brains of rats with chronic brain injury have not been characterized .
moreover , there is no report about the effect of pgis / ip signaling pathway activation on cerebral damage in rat with chronic brain injury .
we previously established a rat model of chronic brain injury via chronic intragastric administration of aluminum gluconate .
administration of aluminum gluconate caused an increase of hippocampal aluminum level ( 21.53 +/ - 2.90 vs 61.17 +/ - 9.25 mug / g ) and learning and memory function disorder [ 15,16 ] .
the present study was designed to investigate the effects of beraprost sodium ( bps , an agonist of ip ) on chronic brain injury and to primary explore neuroprotective mechanism of bps through detecting the change of hippocampal neuronal pgi2 content , and the expressions of pgis and ip at mrna and protein levels in chronic aluminum - overload rats .

all experimental procedures on animals were approved by institutional animal ethics committee of chongqing medical university .
the research was also conducted in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals promulgated by the united states national institutes of health .
the 75 rats were randomly divided into five group depending on body weight ( each n = 15 ) : a control group , an aluminum - treated group ( al - overload group ) , and three bps - treated groups ( 6 , 12 , and 24 mug.kg - 1 bps , marked as bps - 6 group , bps - 12 group and bps - 24 group , respectively ) .
rats in the al - overload group received chronic intragastric administration of aluminum gluconate ( al3 + 200 mg / kg per day ) , followed by administration of 0.5 % cmc - na 2 h later .
aluminum was administrated 5 days per week for 20 continuous weeks .
two hours later after aluminum administration , rats in bps - treated groups were intragastrically administered with bps ( 6 , 12 , and 24 mug.kg - 1 ) .
the control group was treated with an equal volume of sodium gluconate followed by an equal volume of 0.5 % cmc - na 2 h later [ 8,16 ] .
morris water maze test on the next day after aluminum administration was stopped , the rats in each group were subjected to spatial learning and memory test using a dms - 2 morris water maze ( institute of materia medica , chinese academy of medical sciences , beijing , china ) with a diameter of 1.5 m , height of 0.5 m , water depth of 0.4 m and temperature of 23 +/ - 2degreesc .

the supernatant was collected for detection of pgi2 level according to the manual of the enzyme - linked immuno - sorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( cayman , usa ) .
since pgi2 can be easily metabolized , the level of 6 - keto - prostaglandin f1alpha ( 6 - keto - pgf1alpha ) , a metabolite of pgi2 , was detected .
in order to avoid the post - mortem production of prostanoids from oxylipids , the indomethacin , a nonselective inhibitor of cox - 1 and cox - 2 , was added according to the manual of the elisa kit .

discussion episodic memory is a type of long - term memory based on personal daily events and factual knowledge , which is the most clinically relevant memory system .
episodic memory depends on the limbic system , hippocampus and frontal lobes .
any morphological alteration of hippocampal neurons will result in cognitive impairment , which is the most common hallmark for brain injury and neurodegeneration [ 18 ] .
therefore , in this study , we observed the change of histopathology in chronic aluminium gluconate - overload rat hippocampi .
the present study results showed that chronic administration of aluminium gluconate resulted in the impairment of spatial learning function and spatial memory function and hippocampal neuron injury in rats .
this is similar with our previous reported results [ 8,15 ] .
prostacyclin synthase ( pgis ) converts the pgh2 derived from arachidonic acid via cox to pgi2 and produces important physiological function by acting mainly on ip. besides endothelial cells , pgis is also predominantly expressed in cortex and hippocampus neurons companied with ip expression .
cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury will result in a delayed and transient induction of pgis in cortex and hippocampus neurons [ 19 ] .
cox - 1 / pgis adenoviral gene transfer to substantia nigra can prevent 6 - ohda - induced dopamine depletion and behavioral deficits in rats [ 20 ] .
combined gene transfer of cox - 1 and pgis also can increase pgi2 level and reduce cerebral infarct volume [ 12 ] .
ip - / - mice compared with wide type mice show significantly larger infarct volume and greater behavioral damage , and administration of beraprost can significantly improve the neurological deficits and decrease the infarct volume in wild type mice [ 21 ] .
these previous studies indicate that activation of pgis / ip signaling is neuroprotective for acute traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemic reperfusion insult .
however , potential value of such activation for chronic brain injury is still not clear .
we are the first to find that compared with the control group , pgis mrna expression , pgi2 level and the ip mrna and protein expressions significantly increased in hippocampus of chronic aluminum - overload rats .
our results suggest that there is activation of pgis / ip signaling pathway in chronic brain injury rat hippocampus subjected to aluminum overload .
however , our studies showed that although the expression levels of ip in the hippocampus were significantly induced , the rats still displayed obvious spatial learning and memory impairment and obvious hippocampal neurons injury .
these observations may be due to the increase of ip levels being insufficient to antagonize the injury caused by aluminum overload .
therefore , exogenous ip agonists should be supplied .
our experiments also showed that the administration of bps , which is an agonist of ip , could significantly improve spatial learning and memory function impairment and hippocampal neuron injury in chronic aluminum overload rats .
meanwhile , the administration of bps resulted in a decrease of pgi2 level and a downregulation of pgis and ip expressions .
our results suggest that bps has a protective effect on cerebral injury induced by chronic aluminum overload in rats .
oxidative metabolism can supply energy to neurons .
at the same time , this process may produce a lot of reactive compounds such as oxyradicals and hydrogen peroxide , which may cause peroxidation of biomembrane lipids , dna damage , and neuronal death .
the present study results showed that aluminum gluconate overload resulted in a significant decrease of sod activity and a significant increase of mda content .
our results further confirmed that oxidative stress contributed to aluminum gluconate induced chronic brain injury .
our previous studies showed that chronic aluminium gluconate exposure caused significant increase of al , fe , mn , cu and zn level in rat hippocampus [ 9 ] .
the brain accumulation of these metals ( al , fe , mn , cu and zn ) could cause a significant oxidative stress .
the latter cause the tissue damage and formation of aa by degradation of cell membrane phospholipids .
bps administration also significantly blunted the decrease of sod activity and the increase of mda content induced by aluminum overload in rats .
about the neuroprotective mechanisms of bps , considering it can relieve oxidative stress in aluminum - overload rat , the effect of bps on lipid peroxide formation may involve in the neuroprotective mechanisms .
previous research reported that bps could relieve the ischemic and recirculation - induced cerebral injury through inhibition of lipid peroxide formation [ 22 ] .
besides this , bps can relieve oxidative stress injury and inhibit the neuroinflammation in cns by stimulating the ip receptor and in turn results in decrease of cell membrane phospholipids degradation and pgh2 formation .
the decrease of pgh2 level might cause the decrease of pgis expression and pgi2 content .
on the other hand , a long - term use of bps also caused downregulation of ip mrna and protein expressions by a negative feedback regulation mechanism of receptor .
together with these results , our experimental results suggest that the pgis / ip signaling pathway in chronic brain injury rat hippocampus is activated and that beraprost sodium has a neuroprotective effect on chronic brain injury through remodeling the balance of pgis / ip signaling pathway and inhibition of oxidative stress in aluminum - overload rats .
the pgis / ip signaling pathway is promising to potential therapeutic strategy for chronic brain injury patients .
however,the effect of bsp on ip downstream signaling pathway is necessary to further study in detail .

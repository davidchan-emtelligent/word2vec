see comment : http :// jbiol.com / content / 8 / 3 / 24 when i wrote my 2009 comment ' are we training pit bulls to review our manuscripts ? ?
[ 1 ] i was motivated by the aggressive search for flaws that we teach - yes it 's our best defense against incomplete scientific evidence for new hypotheses and worse , fraud - but i proposed that we had become overly zealous .
instead of a laser - like focus on demanding more data , more statistics , more of everything , how could we instead teach students to recognize timely , solid , and important findings that actually reflect the type of work most of us publish , most of the time ?
the recommendations to give students a better grounding in evaluating typical , very good papers were simple : 1 .
read the papers in the bibliographies of ' important ' papers and key reviews to learn the context from the past .
note where these papers are published - they are usually in a wide range of journal types .
2. learn to consider the current state of questions and technologies when a group likely started their work , not what has just become possible to do. help students see that commitment to an appropriate technology at a specific time is often necessary to get anything done and that jumping to ' the next new thing ' may not be possible given the biological materials or the budget .
3. talk to a group of authors who are writing a current paper about the triage of which data to include , what parts of the manuscript represent confirmatory evidence , and which parts are novel or add a new insight to a current model .
following the publication of the journal of biology comment [ 1 ] , i received nearly 20 emails and many campus comments , and participated in many general discussions at meetings .
this is far more feedback than for all but a handful of papers i 've written .
several people wanted the list of the ' dirty dozen ' papers with fatal flaws to use in their teaching .... hmmmm , did they read the comment ?
but most people expressed parallel concerns and offered more suggestions on involving students in manuscript writing and in reading the reviews received .
the latter idea is quite good i think , if authors are willing to share this information , because in my experience student evaluations of papers are more thoughtful and thorough than most professional reviews .
students would grasp how some papers with fatal flaws slip through the review and editorial process if they read some of the very superficial reviews authors do receive .
second , students would feel the pain of authors they know when offhand or incorrect comments might doom a manuscript .
more importantly , they would see that even enthusiastic reviewers often have excellent suggestions for improving the manuscript , in ways that the authors might not have considered .
many papers are better on rewriting or re - visioning , actually thinking everything through afresh after comments .
students who participated in the rebuttal to reviews would also learn some of the negotiating and ' spin ' skills so necessary to advocate for acceptance .
learning to recast the ' state of knowledge ' to pinpoint how your report is a step forward often highlights a weakness in the introductory material of the original submission - if reviewers could n't see how this was new , they are more likely to suggest rejection .
collectively the active participation of students in manuscript crafting , rewriting , and composing rebuttal letters would prepare them for writing up their own work .
i think students would be more realistic about when to start writing , about choosing the appropriate journal for the data in hand ( not the dream journal ) , and how best to anticipate reviewers' comments and write a manuscript that forthrightly addresses legitimate issues , including recognizing that some data types are weaker than others .
one final clarification : i 'm a cat person - completely afraid of large dogs , so for me the pit bull inspires terror .
on the other hand , quite a few readers own and love this breed , and they were hurt that once again pit bulls were used as a symbol of unnecessary aggression .
i apologize and point out that feline hunters show little mercy to their prey ; thus , the original article could have been titled are we training tigers or lions or tabbies ?

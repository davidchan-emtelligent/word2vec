however , maintaining bg in the target range , while avoiding hypoglycemia , is challenging .
continuous glucose monitoring ( cgm ) is a promising technology that may help address these challenges .
we investigated the performance and safety of medtronic sentrino ( r ) , a newly developed cgm for critically ill adults , in the cardiac icu .
methods adult patients with actual or planned cardiac icu admission at a single tertiary center were approached for participation and signed consent .
other inclusion criteria were treatment with i.v. insulin ( target bg < 140 mg / dl ) and life expectancy > 96 hours .
after initiation of i.v. insulin , sentrino ( r ) subcutaneous glucose sensors were inserted into patients' anterior thighs with planned study participation of 72 to 96 hours .
reference bg was collected according to icu protocol , obtained from central venous catheter and analyzed with bedside blood gas analyzer ( bga ; i - stat ( r ) , abbott , usa ) .
sensor glucose ( sg ) results were displayed , and its predictive alerts and alarms fully enabled .
additional reference bgs were obtained during alarms and calibration .
all treatment decisions were based on bga data , not on sg values .
results a total of 21 patients were enrolled ; all successfully completed the study .
mean age was 65 years , 38 % were women , 67 % had diabetes .
types of surgery were cabg ( 38 %) , valve replacement ( 29 %) , combined cabg and valve ( 19 %) and cardiac transplant ( 14 %) .
sg was displayed 95 % of the time during the study , and 864 paired bg - sg points were used for analysis .
overall mean absolute relative difference ( mard ) was 12.2 % .
no differences in cgm system accuracy were seen within subgroups of low versus high society of thoracic surgeons ( sts ) score ( mard 12.1 % and 10.6 % for sts > 8 % vs. <= 8 % , respectively ) or hemodynamic status ( mard 12.0 % and 12.4 % for compromised vs. stable hemodynamics ) .
consensus grid analysis showed > 99 % of sg values within a / b zones , and 0 % in d / e zones .
no device or study - related adverse events were reported .
in total , 80 % and 100 % of clinicians found sentrino ( r ) easy to use after one and two patients , respectively .
conclusion the sentrino ( r ) cgm system demonstrated good analytic and clinically relevant accuracy , excellent reliability and safety in critically ill cardiac patients ; and was easy to use and integrate in the cardiac icu .
future studies are needed to determine whether cgm can improve bg control and reduce hypoglycemia in this patient group .

introduction the long - term use of benzodiazepines ( bzd ) and z - drugs in older populations is associated with a variety of sociodemographic and health - related factors .
recent studies reported that long - term bzd and z - drugs use is associated with increased age , female sex , and severe negative psychological ( e.g. , depression ) and somatic ( e.g. , chronic disease ) factors .
the current study explores the sociodemographic and health - related factors associated with long - term bzd and z - drugs use in the elderly .
methods we conducted a cross - sectional survey among randomly selected patients of one health insurance plan (" aok north - west ") with bzd and z - drugs prescriptions in the past 12 months .
the sample was stratified by appropriate german prescription guidelines ( yes vs. no ) and age ( 50 - 65 vs. > 65 years ) .
to examine the association of selected sociodemographic and psychological variables ( e.g. , sex , employment status , quality of life , depression ) with long - term use , a binary logistic regression analysis was conducted .
results in total , data from 340 patients were analyzed .
the mean age was 72.1 ( sd = 14.5 ) years , and the most commonly used substances were zopiclon ( 38.1 %) , oxazepam ( 18.1 %) , and lorazepam ( 13.8 %) .
the mean defined daily dose ( ddd ) was 0.73 ( sd = 0.47 ) .
insomnia was the main reason for prescribing bzd and z - drugs .
the long - term use of bzd and z - drugs was significantly associated with unemployment ( or = 2.9 , 95 % ci [ 1.2 - 7.1 ]) and generally problematic medication use ( or = 0.5 , 95 % ci [ 0.2 - 1.0 ]) .
discussion unemployment status and problematic medication use had a significant association with the patient - reported , long - term use of bzd and z - drugs .
divergent prescription patterns might suggest problematic patterns of bzd and z - drugs use .
the causal connection between the identified factors and problematic bzd and z - drugs prescription is not discussed in this paper .
nevertheless , employment status and possible evidence of general problematic drug use may be a warning signal to the prescribers of bzd and z - drugs .
z - drugs older people psychological and sociodemographic factors benzodiazepines insomnia unemployment daily structure long - term use the authors received no funding for this work .
introduction benzodiazepines ( bzd ) and z - drugs ( e.g. , zopiclone , zolpidem ) are frequently used to treat insomnia and anxiety among elderly patients ( lohse & muller - oerlinghausen , 2013 ; ashton , 1994 ) .
despite the positive effects of bzd and z - drugs , a variety of negative side effects may occur ; these include a risk of falling , cognitive difficulties , abuse and dependence on the drug ( baldwin et al. , 2013 ; lader , 2011 ; cumming & le couteur , 2003 ; cimolai , 2007 ) .
to avoid these negative consequences , international guidelines recommend prescription for acute and short - term treatment only , with " short - term use " not exceeding four weeks ; other medical or psychological treatment options should be considered before bzd is chosen ( american psychiatric association , 1990 ; fialova , topinkova & gambassi , 2005 ; morgenthaler et al. , 2007 ; joint formulary committee , 2010 ; american geriatrics society , 2015 ) .
although the guiding principles of bzd use are clearly defined in clinical practice , long - term use seems to increase with age ( petitjean et al. , 2007 ) , leading to a high prevalence rate of long - term users , particularly among the older population ( hogan et al. , 2003 ; naja et al. , 2000 ; neutel , 2005 ; verthein et al. , 2013 ) .
a study from olfson and colleagues shows that the percentage of bzd use increased with age from 2.6 % ( 18 - 35 years ) to 5.4 % ( 36 - 50 years ) to 7.4 % ( 51 - 64 years ) to 8.7 % ( 65 - 80 years ) .
the proportion of long - term users increased with age from 14.7 % ( 18 - 35 years ) to 31.4 % ( 65 - 80 years ) ( olfson , king & schoenbaum , 2015 ) .
the proportion of german patients using bzd for > 6 months increased with age ( 65 - 70 years : 12.3 % ; 71 - 80 years : 15.5 % ; 81 - 90 years : 23.7 % ; > 90 years : 31.6 %) ( jacob , rapp & kostev , 2017 ) .
recent studies show an increased risk for older women regarding potentially inappropriate use of bzd , indicating a significant difference by sex among older patients ( morgan et al. , 2016 ) .
unemployment ( magrini et al. , 1996 ) and female sex ( neutel , 2005 ; verthein et al. , 2013 ) are further parameters related to the risks of potentially inadequate bzd or z - drugs intake .
in addition to linking patterns of bzd use to demographic , lifestyle and clinical variables , these studies suggest a positive association of long - term bzd use with alcohol consumption , anxiety and psychological stress ; exercise was negatively related to chronic use ( nordfjaern et al. , 2013 ) .
psychological factors such as anxiety , depression and addiction behavior are associated with problematic misuse use of bzd and z - drugs ( manthey et al. , 2012 ; kan , hilberink & breteler , 2004 ; zandstra et al. , 2004 ) .
in studies looking for association between depressive disorders and the use of bzd , people were more likely to be unemployed , have a history of child abuse , or suffer from comorbid panic disorder and have higher anhedonia scores ( rizvi et al. , 2015 ) .
when comparing short - and long - term users of bzd , the latter had a more severe history of mental health problems for which they had received more serious treatment , more psychotropic drugs , and more frequent hospital consultations .
they were also more likely to suffer from chronical physical illnesses such as diabetes , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , hypertension and serious skin disorders ( zandstra et al. , 2002 ) .
furthermore , the potentially inappropriate use of especially high doses of bzd and z - drugs reduced quality of life , social functioning , and has high levels of psychological distress ( lugoboni et al. , 2014 ; tamburin et al. , 2017 ; ventegodt & merrick , 2003 ) .
many factors are associated with long - term bzd and z - drugs use .
these patterns suggest that further analysis could reveal important variables that may lead to broader and more evidence - based risk prevention .
avoiding the long - term use of these drugs could be facilitated by the use of risk indicators ( zandstra et al. , 2002 ) .
these may produce a decline in long - term bzd use , especially in elderly patients .
consequently , there is great need to understand these patterns and determine the patient - related characteristics associated with long - term bzd use .
awareness of these patient - related factors may lead to adjustments in the care offered to this older population .
therefore , this paper sought to analyze the association between patient characteristics ( such as sociodemographic factors or psychological and clinical components ) and the long - term use of bzd and z - drugs .
methods the study design is a cross - sectional survey of data sampled from people over the age of 50 , all of whom were recipients of bzd or z - drugs prescriptions .
the study was carried out as part of the project " benzodiazepines and z - drugs - - concepts for risk reduction among older patients " , sponsored by the federal ministry of health .
data were accessed through the german health insurance aok north - west .
relevant patient data were stratified by age ( 50 - 65 vs. > 65 years ) and by prescription behavior ( short - term versus long - term intake ) .
the risk of patients forgetting the reasons for initial use was reduced by limiting the intake time to a maximum of five years .
the last prescription of bzd and z - drugs , whether adhering to guidelines or not , must have occurred within the previous twelve months .
stratification by age was used to help uncover specific causes , symptoms and attendant circumstances likely involved with long - term consumption of bzd and z - drugs among elderly patients .
the group stratification was as follows : ( 1 ) potentially inappropriate or long - term users (< than four weeks ) are patients with two currently consecutive or more than two consecutive prescriptions in the past year ( 2013 - 2014 ) ; ( 2 ) potentially appropriate or short - term (> as four weeks ) users were patients with only one prescription in the past year ( 2013 - 2014 ) and no prescriptions in the previous year ( 2012 - 2013 ) .
ethical approval was obtained from the board of the medical ethics committee of hamburg ( pv4688 ) .
procedure a group size of n = 100 was sufficient to substantiate statistically relevant small - to medium - effect sizes with a steady distribution of characteristics ( d >= . 30 , alpha = 0 , 05 , power = 80 %) and medium effects with differences of relative frequency ( diff. >= 20 % , or >= 2 , 3 ) .
aok north - west has 1.4 million insured persons .
german insurance police data suggested that approximately 5 % of the insured population received prescriptions of bzd or z - drugs within one year and that at least 16 % had long - term prescriptions .
elderly patients are overrepresented in this finding .
thus , 11,000 aok insured members were eligible for the target group of long - term intake , and the total of short - term users was estimated to be approximately 44,000 persons .
based on experience , aok predicted a feedback rate of 10 % .
based on this , 4 x 1,000 patients were contacted ( according to the stratification outlined above ) .
four thousand eligible people , one thousand per stratum , were coincidentally identified through insurance databases and contacted by their insurance company .
over the last several years in germany , one can observe a trend that may seem at first paradoxical : while the rates of long - term bzd use through government insurance declined , the rates of private prescriptions ( in the case of legally insured persons ) increased ( hoffmann , glaeske & scharffetter , 2006 ) .
thus , it cannot be assumed that the prescriptions have been fundamentally reduced but rather that a shift in the regulations from cash to private prescriptions has occurred .
pharmacists estimate that approximately half of all z - drugs in the western federal states are private prescriptions ( hoffmann , glaeske & scharffetter , 2006 ) .
patients who received bzd and z - drugs via private prescription were also included to consider another group potentially affected by long - term use .
for this purpose , a hamburg pharmacist , in the pharmacy proper , asked these patients to participate ; another 100 persons were contacted .
a personalized and mailed letter invited them to participate in the study .
those who were contacted were asked to complete the questionnaire and to use the anonymous , stamped return envelope , which was sent to the university medical center hamburg - eppendorf ( uke ) research group .
to ensure anonymity , participants were reminded throughout not to include any personal information .
the respondents did not receive any incentives to participate in the study .
the questionnaire survey was run in between december 2014 and february 2015 .
measures sociodemographic data included sex , age , family , living and employment status , care dependence , and questions related to bzd and z - drugs .
the analysis of psychological factors was based on the following standardized inventory : anxiety via generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire ( gad - 7 ) ( williams , 2014 ) , depression via patient health questionnaire ( lowe et al. , 2004 ; kroenke & spitzer , 2002 ) , alcohol use via audit ( bradley et al. , 2007 ; daeppen et al. , 2000 ) , quality of sleep via pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi - short ) ( buysse et al. , 1989 ; carpenter & andrykowski , 1998 ) , beliefs - related medication use via beliefs about medicines questionnaire ( bmq ) ( horne , weinman & hankins , 1999 ; mahler et al. , 2012 ) , health - related quality of life via hrql - sf - 12 questionnaire ( cheak - zamora , wyrwich & mcbride , 2009 ) and general medication use via a short questionnaire of medication use ( watzl et al. , 1991 ) ( german : kurzfragebogen fur medikamentengebrauch , kfm ) .
the short survey for drug use ( kfm ) is a validated and standardized 12 - item survey used to assess the abuse of sleep - inducing drugs , mood stabilizers and tranquilizing medications .
it is often used in research and epidemiological studies on drug use in germany ( watzl et al. , 1991 ) .
the bmq specific comprises two factors assessing beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication ( specific - necessity ) and concerns about prescribed medication based on beliefs about the danger of dependence and long - term toxicity and the disruptive effects of medication ( specific - concern ) .
statistical analyses descriptive statistics were calculated to present demographic characteristics .
adjustment for missing values was carried out by replacing the value ( without imputation ) , which did not occur below the specified values .
to analyze differences between long - and short - term users , we used chi2 tests for categorical variables and t - tests for metric variables .
to reduce multicollinearity , we used univariate analysis ( r , person - product - moment correlation coefficient ) to examine highly correlated variables and remove one of the pair for the final model .
for effect sizes , cohen 's d was calculated with the effect size calculator of the university of colorado ( becker , 1998 ) .
finally , to examine the association of the selected sociodemographic and psychological variables for long - term use , binary logistic regression analysis was conducted .
we used the forward entry method to test all variables in one model .
to analyze the variables of this method for content , the threshold values of categorical scale were dichotomized .
nagelkerke 's r2 and the hosmer - lemeshow statistic were calculated as a goodness - of - fit measure for the model .
all analyses were performed using statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) .
results as outlined above , 4,000 aok patients were contacted ( based on the stratification categories of age and appropriate prescription ) and asked to fill out and return a nine - page questionnaire .
a total of 466 persons completed the questionnaire , which produced a feedback rate of 11.7 % .
the response rate was considered to be 12 % .
following a preliminary discussion with ako nordwest , corresponding experiences should only be provided with a certain degree of process depth .
in addition , 16 participating pharmacists were able to procure 43 private patients , falling short of the target number of 100 .
overall , there were 509 questionnaires completed , and the projected recruitment target of 466 patients was nearly reached .
however , only 340 persons were included in the statistical analyses , as 169 individuals , mainly from the group of short - term users , did not record their intake of benzodiazepines or z - drugs .
the extent to which missing answers could be attributed to memory lapses , ignorance about the medication or actual non - use of these prescription medications cannot be assessed .
most of the 340 patients were married , lived with partners / children , were unemployed and were not care dependent .
the most commonly used substances were zopiclon , oxazepam , and lorazepam ( table 1 ) .
the defined daily dose ( ddd ) was 0.73 on average .
the standardized daily dose ( ddd ) is statistically significantly higher than those with guideline - based prescription rate .
in both patients group was the medications taken in a lower dose , on average less than one ddd .

the univariate analysis ( table 1 ) looks at substantial differences between short - term and long - term users of the medication .
it shows that long - term users were significantly older than short - term users .
while short - term users were more likely to be married or in a relationship , long - term users were more often divorced or widowed .
furthermore , long - term users were more often divorced or widowed .
furthermore , long - term users were more likely to be unemployed than short - term users were .
short - term users of bzd and z - drugs needed care less often than long - term users did .
finally , long - term users consumed a greater amount z - drugs , while more short - term users took bzd and z - drugs ; the ddd is significantly higher among long - term users .
in the next methodic step the univariate analysis was carried out ( table 2 ) .
the univariate analysis was conducted to determine the correlations between the analyzed psychological variables .
the mean average of phq - 9 for surveying depression , as well as that of gad - 7 for measuring anxiety , suggest a light to moderate manifestation of the respective symptoms in each group , without a significant difference between the groups .
the screening instrument audit - c , which investigates the risks of incurring alcohol - related dysfunctions , suggests a low rate on average in both groups .
sf - 12 evaluation of health - related quality of life regarding physical state indicates below average statistics for both groups ; data in this field are even lower than those concerning mental well - being .
figures from the pittsburgh sleep quality index suggest poor sleep quality among both groups .
the bmq necessity spectrum , meanwhile , produces a mean average of m = 3.3 ( sd = 1.14 ) and suggests a significant difference between the groups .
this strongly indicates that patients consider bzd and z - drugs intake vital , particularly those belonging to the group of long - term users .
in contrast , the chart looking at concerns regarding bzd and z - drugs intake generates a low mean average , which suggests indiscriminate use of the medication .
the kfm - score examined problematically medication intake indicates a differences in the groups to show the significantly accordance between long term users and problematically medication use score .

table 3 presents an analysis of multi - collinearities through the partial correlations between the variables examined .
there is no chance of multi - collinearity if the correlation coefficients are smaller than the value of 0.8 ( schendera , 2014 ) .
overall , no strong correlations of variables were detected .
the manifestations of phq - 9 and gad - 7 show moderate positive correlation , which is comprehensible on a symptom level .
both disorders are frequently co - morbid .
moderately strong negative correlations can be seen between sf - 12 mental scale and gad - 7 as well as phq - 9 .
this interrelation is understandable , since strong mental quality of life is incompatible with anxiety and depression .
another negative correlation can be found between sf - 12 physical scale and need of care .
poor physical quality of life and need of care are comprehensible .
finally , it becomes apparent that people at an advanced age are more likely to be married or in a relationship , as well as working less or retired .

for measuring depression and anxiety values as predictors were selected , ranging from zero to mild symptomatology .
this was done because the sample analyzed was not clinical and did not show any distinct symptomatology .
the model shows that unemployment ( or = 2.9 , p = 0.021 ) and problematically medication use ( or = 4.7 , p = 0.055 ) are statistically significantly associated with long - term use .
all other of the analyzed variables were not significantly associated .
the total explained variance amounted to 24.1 % and the hosmer - lemeshow statistic indicates a good fit ( horne , weinman & hankins , 1999 ) .

abbreviations or odds ratio psqi pittsburgh sleep quality index phq - 9 patient health questionnaire gad - 7 generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire audit - i alcohol use disorders identification test consumption bmq beliefs about medicines questionnaire specific n necessity c concerns kfm short questionnaire of medication use sf12 short version of health related quality of life ( hrql ) p physical m mental discussion in the univariate analysis we found that long term users were older , were more likely to be unmarried and unemployed and used a different primary medication compared with short term - users .
regarding the psychological variables , long - term users had significantly higher scores on bmq necessity and kfm than short - term users did .
the multivariate analysis identified unemployment status and problematic medication use as clear factors of long - term use .
all other analyzed independent variables were not significant for a reliable association .
this study did not identify either sex or age as predictors for long - term intake of bzd and z - drugs .
this partly contradicts the results of epidemiological studies ( verthein et al. , 2013 ) that analyzed benzodiazepine prescriptions over a prospective period of 12 months within a larger sample consisting of patients of all ages .
it can be argued that age is a predictor of long - term use when comparing younger adults with the elderly , but within the group of people over 50 years , age does not seem to influence use .
the present research focused on people age 50 and older and was not epidemiological in nature .
sex as a predictor could not be confirmed in the present study .
as in previous research ( verthein et al. , 2013 ; kan , hilberink & breteler , 2004 ) , there were more female users ( 68.5 %) than males in the sample , but there were no differences in their tendencies to use the medication in a long - term manner .
marital and living - situation status were not predictors for long - term intake in our analysis .
long - term intake , as established by kfm , reveals a difference between the groups examined and may serve as a predictor .
the questionnaire increased the stratified breakup of the groups .
it becomes clear that older people who use bzd and z - drugs for more than four weeks may continue their problematic consumption ( not just regarding the time criterion ) .
the attitudes ( bmq ) toward medication use reveal that patients consider bzd intake to be vital , a view that is especially prevalent among long - term users of the drug .
meanwhile , the chart looking at concerns about drug consumption produced a low mean average , which allows for the view that indiscriminate use of bzd or z - drugs is widespread .
the idea that divergent prescription harbors problematic patterns of drug use , questioning previous treatment methods , is beyond dispute at this point .
the survey at hand used psqi to collect data about this condition ; not surprisingly , both groups - - all older patients with short - term intake and those without it - - seem to experience sleeping difficulties .
this result is consistent with findings from other studies ( poyares et al. , 2004 ; vaapio et al. , 2015 ; beland et al. , 2010 ) .
people are likely to experience sleep disorders , regardless of the length of bzd and z - drugs intake .
earlier studies revealed that nearly every elderly patient reported having at least one symptom of insomnia , while those with medical problems were particularly likely to suffer from symptoms ( foley et al. , 2004 ; foley et al. , 1995 ) .
the long - term use of bzd and z - drugs for insomnia seems to be an effective of treating symptoms .
the result , however , can be low - dose addiction , which constitutes a new problem .
at this point , the benefits of ongoing short - term treatment of symptoms should be weighed against its consequences , namely , drug dependency .
the respective pros and cons of treatment should be appraised .
alternative medicinal and non - medicinal treatment options should also be considered .
both doctors and patients should engage in a decision - making process to achieve a shared ideal outcome .
established approaches regarding topics such as medicinal over - prescription are applicable to this field .
unlike other studies ( manthey et al. , 2012 ; kan , hilberink & breteler , 2004 ; morin , belanger & bernier , 2004 ) depression and anxiety were not confirmed as predictors .
this survey uses the value " mild depression " when examining patients already suffering from depressive symptoms .
it emerges that mild depressive symptomatology increases the likelihood of long - term intake , contradicting studies looking at the correlation between depression and bzd and z - drugs use .
these studies focused on specific facets of depression ( e.g. , diagnosed depression , heavy episodes , comorbid disorder ) in combination with equally specific forms of bzd intake ( bzd and z - drug addiction ) .
as with depression , the value " mild anxiety " was used for symptoms of anxiety .
we assumed that patients taking bzd and z - drugs temporarily to combat a state of anxiety would discontinue the drug after a short while , resulting in fewer symptoms .
patients with long - term intake , however , will continue to deal with symptoms of anxiety .
still , we could not identify mild anxiety as a predictor .
our results show that unemployment is a significant factor for the long - term use of bzd and z - drugs .
it is known that people without employment , daily structure , social contacts and daily goals have a higher risk of developing a mental disorder ( butterworth et al. , 2012 ; perreault et al. , 2016 ) .
it is also known that problematic substance use increases the likelihood of unemployment and decreases the chance of finding and holding down a job .
conversely , it can be assumed that people use the medication over the long term because they are unable to work for health reasons ( henkel , 2011 ) .
research shows that unemployment , on average , has a negative impact on an individual 's psychological and physical well - being ( mckee - ryan et al. , 2005 ) .
knowing this , particularly in the case of the elderly , suggests that attention should be paid to employment and , after the pension , to everyday life activity to maintain a daily structure and social contacts and thereby improve or maintain their well - being and reduce the risk of long - term medication use .
in the present analysis , the quality of life as a parameter does not differ between the groups and , thus , cannot serve as predictor for long - term consumption .
this outcome runs counter to previous research ( gelatti et al. , 2006 ; gonzalez - salvador et al. , 2000 ) .
both groups , however , show that mental well - being is considered more important than physical fitness with increased age .
the greatest discomfort was observed in items exploring physical ability .
the long - term use of bzd and z - drugs affects this area the most , in accordance with previous research ( gray et al. , 2006 ) .
as elderly people are more susceptible to physical infirmity , this result is understandable ( gnjidic et al. , 2009 ; berdot et al. , 2009 ) .
conclusion as no psychological predictors emerge from our analysis , a closer look is needed at the daily routine of older adults , at their employment status , and at their medication use overall .
long - term consumption , perhaps , can be explained but not yet predicted by anxiety , depression , and sleep disorders or poor quality of life .
at this point , our results point away from symptoms : daily activities and routine , purposeful performance of a task , and engaging with other people all contribute significantly to the non - problematic consumption of bzd and z - drugs .
further research and clinical discussion should continue from here to find solutions of a systemic nature .
limitations cross - sectional studies cannot conduct causal tests .
the results of this paper should therefore be interpreted with caution .
furthermore , the results of this stratified study do not lend themselves to generalization .
they merely provide reference points .
further longitudinal studies should be carried out to address the question of predictive values regarding potentially inappropriate intake of sedatives and hypnotics .
many important factors such as physical well - being , chronic ailments , and additional medication use were not analyzed in this study .
attempts to discontinue the drug were not considered , and the role of the prescriber was excluded .

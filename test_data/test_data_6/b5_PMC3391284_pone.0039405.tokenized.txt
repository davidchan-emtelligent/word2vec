superficial mycoses caused by dermatophyte fungi are among the most common infections worldwide , yet treatment is restricted by limited effective drugs available , drug toxicity , and emergence of drug resistance .
the stilbene fluorescent brightener calcofluor white ( cfw ) inhibits fungi by binding chitin in the cell wall , disrupting cell wall integrity , and thus entails a different mechanism of inhibition than currently available antifungal drugs .
to identify novel therapeutic options for the treatment of skin infections , we compared the sensitivity of representative strains of the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum and candida albicans to cfw and a panel of fluorescent brighteners and phytoalexin compounds .
we identified the structurally related stilbene fluorescent brighteners 71 , 85 , 113 and 134 as fungicidal to both t. rubrum and c. albicans to a similar degree as cfw , and the stilbene phytoalexins pinosylvan monomethyl ether and pterostilbene inhibited to a lesser degree , allowing us to develop a structure - activity relationship for fungal inhibition .
given the abilities of cfw to absorb uv365 nm and bind specifically to fungal cell walls , we tested whether cfw combined with uv365 nm irradiation would be synergistic to fungi and provide a novel photodynamic treatment option .
however , while both treatments individually were cytocidal , uv365 nm irradiation reduced sensitivity to cfw , which we attribute to cfw photoinactivation .
we also tested combination treatments of cfw with other fungal inhibitors and identified synergistic interactions between cfw and some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors in c. albicans .
therefore , our studies identify novel fungal inhibitors and drug interactions , offering promise for combination topical treatment regimes for superficial mycoses .
introduction dermatophytoses , the infections of keratinized tissues such as the skin , hair and nails by the highly specialized dermatophyte fungi such as trichophyton rubrum , represent the most common type of human infection worldwide , particularly in aging , diabetic or immunocompromised individuals [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
current therapeutic options for treatment of superficial mycoses rely on topical or oral applications of drugs including griseofulvin ( targets microtubules ) , polyenes ( amphotericin b and nystatin and natamycin ) , terbinafine ( allylamine ) , miconazole ( imidazole ) and other azole drugs such as itraconazole ( all of which target ergosterol biosynthesis / membranes ) [ 3 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
however , treatment efficacy is limited by drug side effects including hepatotoxicity , narrow spectrum of action , long duration of treatment , cost and the development of microbial drug resistance [ 3 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] .
therefore , the identification of new antifungal drugs and treatment regimes is necessary .
one method to improve treatment efficacy is by antifungal combination regimes as certain combination treatments exhibit synergistic antifungal action , as well as providing broader spectrum of activity , and reducing the chance of drug resistance arising .
given the accessibility of skin infections to light , photodynamic therapy whereby selective killing from oxidative damage is mediated by a combination of sensitizing drug and photons of light of a wavelength specific to the sensitizer 's absorption properties , offers an alternative therapeutic approach for dermatophytoses .
specifically , a number of sensitizers , particularly porphyrin compounds such 5,10,15 - tris ( 4 - methylpyridinium ) - 20 - phenyl - [ 21h,23h ] - porphine trichloride ( sylsens b ) and the porphyrin precurser 5 - aminolevulinc acid , combined with light at various wavelengths and sources , have been found to be effective against t. rubrum and other fungi both in vitro and in vivo ( reviewed in [ 10 ]) .
fluorescent brighteners are typically diaminostilbene derivative compounds that fluoresce upon exposure to uv light , and bind through hydrogen bonding to beta - linked fibrillar polymers such as cellulose and chitin [ 11 ] .
due to these properties , fluorescent brighteners such as calcofluor white ( cfw ) have been used extensively in the textile , detergent and paper industry for creating a whitening effect , as well as in fungal diagnostics and research [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
in fungi , binding of fluorescent brighteners to nascent chitin chains affects normal chitin assembly by competing for hydrogen bonding sites , and because chitin is an essential component of fungal cell walls , fluorescent brightener binding compromises cell wall integrity , inhibiting fungal growth [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
even though chitin comprises the innermost of three layers in cell walls of dermatophytes such as t. rubrum ( outer layer beta - glucans , second layer galactomannan , inner layer chitin ) , differing from those of yeast such as c. albicans ( outer layer mannoprotein , inner layers beta - glucans and chitin ) , the staining pattern for fluorescent brighteners 220 and 119 indicates that binding predominantly occurs at the chitin layer , causing substantial perturbation of the entire cell wall layer ultrastructure [ 17 ] .
fluorescent brighteners are considered nontoxic to mammals , verified by comprehensive toxicology studies performed due to the extensive use of these products in the textile industry ( eg [ 22 ] , [ 23 ]) .
therefore , fluorescent brighteners may have utility as topical drug treatments .
to identify novel dermatologic therapeutic options , we evaluated the inhibition of two divergent , dermatologically - relevant species t. rubrum ( the most commonly isolated fungus from dermatophyte infections [ 3 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ]) , and candida albicans ( the most significant yeast contributor to skin infections [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 26 ]) by a panel of stilbene and non - stilbene fluorescent brighteners , and determined a structure - activity relationship for drug efficacy .
given the ability of cfw to selectively bind fungi and absorb light at the wavelength 365 nm , we explored the antifungal effects of combination cfw / uv365 nm irradiation treatment .
we also determined drug interactions between cfw and recognized fungal inhibitors for topical drug application .
materials and methods strains , media and growth conditions strains used in this study included the sequenced reference strain c. albicans sc5314 [ 27 ] and the clsi - recommended reference strain t. rubrum atcc mya - 4438 [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , as well as t. rubrum mr851 , mr1505 , mr1461 , and mr827 ( provided by dr. r. barton , university of leeds , uk ). c. albicans was cultured on yeast peptone dextrose ( ypd ) plates or broth , and t. rubrum was cultured on potato dextrose agar ( pda ) .
for mic assays for both species , rpmi 1640 ( sigma r1383 ) was supplemented with dextrose ( 2 g / l ) and mops ( 34.54 g / l ) , and the ph was adjusted to 7.0 .
for disc diffusion assays , rpmi 1640 medium was solidified with agar ( 20 g / l ) .
plates were incubated at 30degreesc for 1 or 2 days ( c. albicans ) or 5 days ( t. rubrum ) , or at room temperature for least 14 days for t. rubrum conidiation .
drug preparation drugs were dissolved in dmso , ethanol , 1 m naoh , or water , and used at the working concentration ranges indicated in table s1 .
for testing drug interactions , concentration ranges of cfw included 0.179 - 11.46 microg / ml ( for t. rubrum ) and 0.72 - 45.85 microg / ml ( for c. albicans ) , 0.19 - 12.0 microg / ml of fluorescent brightener 113 , and 0.34 - 21.82 microg / ml of fluorescent brightener 85 .
ten - fold concentrations of drugs were serially diluted two - fold , and 20 microl aliquots were added to the wells of 96 - well flat - bottomed microtitre plates .
when the drug solvent comprised dmso , ethanol or 1 m naoh , the diluent consisted of 10 % ( vol / vol ) dmso or ethanol or 0.1 m naoh , respectively , thus the final concentration of dmso or ethanol in assays was 1 % ( vol / vol ) , or 0.01 m naoh .
when testing drug interactions , 10 microl of 20 - fold dilutions of each drug were added to assay wells .
mic and mfc assays minimum inhibitory concentration assays ( mic ) were prepared for t. rubrum atcc mya - 4438 and c. albicans sc5314 as described previously [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
briefly , the c. albicans sc5314 inoculum was prepared from an overnight ypd culture that had been washed twice in sterile dh20 , and resuspended in rpmi medium to a concentration of 1.1x103 cells / ml , determined using a hemocytometer .
the t. rubrum atcc mya - 4438 inoculum was prepared to a concentration of 1.1x104 microconidia / ml by washing microconidia off a pda plate culture with 5 ml sterile dh20 , filtering through an 8 microm whatman filter , and washing the filtrate with dh20 .
an aliquot of inoculum was diluted accordingly and plated to agar plates in triplicate to determine the exact viable cell concentration .
volumes of 180 microl of cells were added to the 20 microl drug dilutions in 96 - well microtitre plate wells .
plates were sealed and following incubated for 5 days ( t. rubrum ) , 24 h ( c. albicans mics for clotrimazole , voriconazole , thioconazole , and itraconazole combinations ) , or 48 h ( all other c. albicans mics ) .
the shorter 24 h incubation time for c. albicans with various azoles was used to circumvent the confounding trailing effect observed following 48 h incubation with these drugs , as recommended previously [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
since drugs were tested for their potential as topical treatments , microtitre plates were incubated at the physiologically relevant temperature of 30degreesc ( while the average skin temperature is affected by clothes coverage , location , air temperature , or patient age , the mean temperature of uncovered human skin at room temperature ( 23 - 25degreesc ) is 31.5degreesc , with foot temperature ( site of onychomycosis ) even lower [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ]) .
30degreesc is also the temperature recommended by american type culture collection for the growth of both c. albicans sc5314 and t. rubrum atcc mya - 4438 ( www.atcc.org ) , and commonly for these species in antifungal susceptibility studies , ( for example [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ]) .
following incubation , the optical density at wavelength 600 nm ( od600 ) was read using a tecan sunrise plate absorbance reader .
the mic80 was designated the lowest concentration of drug / treatment condition resulting in at least 80 % reduced growth compared with the od600 reading of the no - drug / treatment control .
to determine minimum fungicidal concentrations ( mfc ) , the entire contents of wells containing no visible growth were plated to ypd ( c. albicans ) or pda ( t. rubrum ) .
the mfc was defined as the lowest concentration of drug / treatment resulting in an at least 99 % ( t. rubrum , mfc99 ) reduction of viable cfu from the inoculum .
for c. albicans , the 10 - fold lower inoculum size precluded the determination of 99 % killing with a high level of accuracy ; thus a 95 % reduction ( mfc95 ) endpoint was employed .
all mic and mfc experiments were performed in triplicate .
the fractional inhibitory concentration ( fic ) was employed to quantify drug interactions and was calculated as follows : fic = [( mic80 of drug a in combination / mic80 of drug a alone )/( mic80 of drug b in combination / mic80 of drug b alone )] .
in accordance with asm guidelines , interactions with fic <= 0.5 were considered synergistic , indifferent if > 0.5 to <= 4.0 , and antagonistic if > 4.0 [ 43 ] .
uv365 nm treatment to test the effect of irradiation on cell inhibition by cfw , microtitre plates containing cfw , rpmi media and c. albicans or t. rubrum were set up as described for mic assays , and wells were individually irradiated at a peak wavelength of 365 nm using a hamamatsu lc - l2 uv - led module with 12 mm wide diode ( led head unit l10561 series , control box model c10608 , driver hub unit model c10558 ) .
the diode was held directly over wells so that the edge of the diode touched the top of the microtitre plate , ensuring the diode was equidistant from cultures in each experiment ( the irradiation distance from the light source to the well bottom was approximately 15 mm ) .
to circumvent light exposure to neighbouring wells during irradiation , black - walled assay 96 well plates ( corning costar ) were used , and wells were covered before and immediately after irradiation with foil .
light intensity was measured using a light power meter ( model c6080 - 13 , hamamatsu photonics k.k. ) , equipped with a 365 nm detector ( model fd1591 ) and averaged 624 mw / cm2 when the distance from the light source was 5 mm. wells were irradiated for 0 , 30 (~ 18.7 j / cm2 ) , 60 (~ 37.4 j / cm2 ) , 90 ( 56.2 j / cm2 ) or 120 seconds ( 74.8 j / cm2 ) respectively .
irradiation times of 180 (~ 112.2 j / cm2 ) , 240 ( 149.6 j / cm2 ) and 300 ( 187 j / cm2 ) seconds in the absence of cfw were also tested .
each experiment was performed in triplicate .
disc diffusion assays disc diffusion assays were employed to visualize various interactions between cfw and drugs shown to be synergistic by mic80 assays .
rpmi 1640 agar plates were prepared containing 0 or 11.46 microg / ml cfw. c. albicans suspensions , containing approximately 1x106 cfu , were spread uniformly on plates using sterile cotton - tipped applicators .
blank 6 mm sterile paper discs ( becton dickinson ) were impregnated with 10 microl volumes of a 10 - fold range of drug concentrations , and after drying , were placed on inoculated plates .
plates were observed following 2 days incubation at 30degreesc .
experiments were performed in duplicate .
results and discussion inhibition by stilbene fluorescent brighteners and compounds because cfw and the structurally similar fluorescent brightener 220 have been shown to inhibit fungal growth , we tested a panel of related stilbene and non - stilbene fluorescent brighteners ( fig. 1 ) for the ability to inhibit the growth of the t. rubrum and c. albicans .
consistent with previous findings , cfw was fungicidal to both t. rubrum ( mic80 2.87 microg / ml , mfc99 5.73 microg / ml ) and c. albicans ( mic80 11.46 - 22.92 microg / ml , mfc95 22.92 - 45.85 microg / ml ) ( table 1 ) .
a number of structurally related compounds were also fungicidal when used at similar molarities , with the most inhibitory including fluorescent brighteners 85 , 113 and 71 , followed by 134 ( table 1 ) .
we found no inhibition by the less structurally similar 4,4 ' - diamino - 2 - 2 ' - stilbenedisulfonic acid , 4,4 ' - diisothiocyanatostilbene - 2,2 ' - disulfonic acid disodium salt hydrate , or fluorescent brighteners er - ii or er - iii .
furthermore , while antifungal testing of the non - stilbene fluorescent brightener 135 was limited due to poor water solubility , we found no inhibition by this compound .

the compounds giving the best inhibition contained the core structure depicted in fig. 1a .
there was considerable flexibility allowed at the r1 residue , with various modifications resulting in minimal changes to fungal sensitivity , with the least tolerated change observed consisting of the substitution of r1 to a methoxy group ( fluorescent brightener 134 ) .
modification of the r2 residue from a hydrogen to a sulfate group had a greater impact on function , with at least 10 - fold reduced sensitivity of strains to fluorescent brightener 220 compared with cfw , or fluorescent brightener 210 compared with fluorescent brightener 71 ( the r1 groups are the same for both cfw and fluorescent brightener 220 , and both fluorescent brighteners 210 and 71 ) .
possible scenarios by which r - groups could influence fungal inhibition by fluorescent brighteners include effects on solubility , hydrogen - bonding to the substrate , conformation , or steric hindrance .
while literature has concentrated on the fungal effects of fluorescent brightener binding to chitin , cfw may also bind other hexopyranose polymers in the beta - conformation in vitro [ 11 ] , as is present in beta - glucans , thus any changes to the substrate specificity of fluorescent brighteners on fungal inhibition may also be exerted at the level of changes to beta - glucan binding and perturbation .
various naturally occurring phytoalexins are also stilbenoid compounds and some have been reported to have antifungal activity [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
therefore , we also tested a group of structurally related stilbene phytoalexins ( fig. 1 ) for the ability to inhibit t. rubrum and c. albicans .
in contrast to findings by jung et al .
[ 44 ] , [ 45 ] who showed inhibition of a different c. albicans strain ( timm 1768 ) by 20 microg / ml resveratrol in ypd medium , and in agreement with weber et al .
[ 48 ] who found no inhibition of three c. albicans ( including sc5314 used in this study ) or five other candida species by resveratrol at <= 128 microg / ml in rich and minimal media , we found no inhibition of c. albicans sc5314 by resveratrol ( mic > 45.65 microg / ml ) .
furthermore , t. rubrum was also not inhibited at the concentrations tested ( table 1 ) .
we also found no inhibition by astringin or rhapontin .
interestingly , both pinosylvin monomethyl ether and pterostilbene ( dimethylether analog of resveratrol ) inhibited t. rubrum and c. albicans , and pinosylvin inhibited t. rubrum , although inhibition required higher concentrations of drug than for cfw inhibition .
while the inhibitory mechanism of stilbene fluorescent brighteners is likely due to the binding of fungal chitin ( and / or beta - glucans ) , affecting cell wall integrity , the antifungal target of action of stilbene phytoalexin compounds is less well understood .
disruption of drug efflux genes increased sensitivity to stilbene phytoalexins in s. cerevisiae and aspergillus nidulans , suggesting that in contrast to cfw , the inhibitory mechanism is internal to the cell [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
furthermore , the antifungal efficacy of stilbene phytoalexins are likely correlated with their ability to be transported into cells , for example , the weak activity of resveratrol has been attributed to its hydrophilic character , making it difficult to pass through membranes [ 52 ] .
the conjugated bond system of hydroxystilbenes form charge transfer complexes with affinity for proteins .
these compounds have also been shown to inhibit fungal enzymes such as tyrosinases [ 53 ] , affect membranes [ 52 ] , and affect expression of genes required for methionine and lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function [ 50 ] .
hence , hydroxystilbene phytoalexins exert wide - ranging effects on the physiological and biochemical processes of fungi .
therefore , although the fluorescent brighteners and phytoalexins studied shown here to inhibit fungi were all stilbene compounds , the mechanisms of antifungal activity likely differ between the two groups .
uv365 nm irradiation reduces cfw efficacy because cfw selectively binds and kills fungi at low concentrations and has a uv absorption peak of 365 nm ( uva - 1 ) , which is within the wavelength spectrum already reported to be fungicidal for t. rubrum ( 340 - 550 nm at 40 j / cm2 [ 54 ]) , we tested the hypothesis that cfw and uv365 nm irradiation combination treatments would be synergistic for t. rubrum and c. albicans inhibition .
irradiation alone was found to be fungicidal , with 80 % inhibition of growth of t. rubrum at 56.2 j / cm2 and c. albicans at 149.6 j / cm2 , 99 % killing of t. rubrum at 74.8 j / cm2 , and 95 % killing of c. albicans at 149.6 j / cm2 .
interestingly , we find that uv365 nm treatment at 37.4 and 56.2 j / cm2 reduces both the c. albicans cfw mic80 and mfc95 levels , but the same was not observed for t. rubrum ( table 2 ) .
however , we find that a lower level of uv365 nm irradiation of 18.7 j / cm2 resulted in 8 - 32 - fold increased cfw mic80 and mfcs for both t. rubrum and c. albicans ( table 2 ) .
similar results were obtained using other strains of t. rubrum ( mr851 , mr1505 , mr1461 and mr827 ) , and uv365 nm irradiation at 18.7 and 37.4 j / cm2 also increased the t. rubrum mic80 for fluorescent brighteners 113 and 85 to > 24.02 and > 21.82 microg / ml , respectively .
therefore , subinhibitory levels of uv365 nm irradiation are antagonistic with cfw for both t. rubrum and c. albicans .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039405.t002 table 2 combination treatments with cfw and uv365 nm irradiation .
uv treatment ( j / cm2 ) a t. rubrum mic80 ( microg / ml ) t. rubrum mfc99 ( microg / ml ) c. albicans mic80 ( microg / ml ) c. albicans mfc95 ( microg / ml ) 0 2.87 2.87 11.46 45.85 18.7 45.85 91.70 183.40 > 183.40 37.4 22.92 91.70 2.87 22.92 56.2 0 91.70 0.36 1.43 a 80 % growth inhibition for uv treatment alone was 56.2 j / cm2 for t. rubrum and 149.6 j / cm2 for c. albicans .
99 % and 95 % fungicidal uv treatment alone was 74.8 j / cm2 for t. rubrum and 149.6 j / cm2 for c. albicans , respectively .
we first tested the hypothesis that uv365 nm irradiation triggered a cellular response that resulted in reduced sensitivity to cfw , for example , by altering transcription of genes for chitin production .
although photoreceptors such as white collar 1 and 2 are absent in both species [ 55 ] , it remains possible that chitin ( and / or beta - glucan ) production could be affected by other stresses triggered by uv light , such as an oxidative stress response .
implied in this hypothesis , uv365 nm irradiation of cells immediately prior to cfw addition should also reduce sensitivity to cfw .
therefore , we irradiated c. albicans cells in microtitre wells for 0 , 18.7 , or 56.2 j / cm2 immediately prior to cfw addition .
for each uv365 nm treatment , the cfw mic80 remained unchanged at 11.46 microg / ml. therefore , our results do not support the hypothesis that uv365 nm induces a cellular response that antagonizes cfw action .
to test the hypothesis that uv365 nm irradiation antagonism of cfw treatment is due to photoinactivation of the cfw , we irradiated cfw solutions at 0 , 18.7 , or 56.2 j / cm2 immediately prior to its addition to c. albicans cells .
cfw that had been irradiated for 0 , 18.7 , or 56.2 j / cm2 resulted in c. albicans mic80 s of 11.46 , 22.92 and 45.85 microg / ml , respectively , indicating that uv365 nm treatment was indeed inactivating the cfw .
inactivation is likely not due to heat inactivation caused by heat emitted by the diode , as cfw mic80 s were unchanged from cfw treatment alone when wells containing c. albicans , rpmi 1640 medium and cfw , covered by foil ( which blocks light yet should still allow heat transfer ) , were irradiated .
furthermore , no inhibition of c. albicans was observed even up to 5 min irradiation ( 187 j / cm2 ) of covered wells containing no cfw , and thus heat from uv365 nm irradiation treatment was also not affecting c. albicans growth in the absence of cfw .
therefore , reduced sensitivity of c. albicans and t. rubrum to cfw in the presence of uv365 nm irradiation is likely due to photoinactivation of cfw .
stilbene compounds are known to undergo photoisomerization , photodimerization , and photocyclization reactions in the presence of uv due to the nature of their conjugated bond system [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] , thus any photoinactivation of cfw is not unexpected .
therefore , while cfw and uv365 nm irradiation are individually fungicidal to both t. rubrum and c. albicans , the combination treatment was antagonistic , and not a viable treatment option .
similarly , rather than increasing any inhibitory effect , subinhibitory concentrations of stilbene fluorescent brighteners in combination with uv254 nm increased spore germination in various fungi [ 16 ] , [ 58 ] , and protected cells from uv254 nm damage [ 16 ] , although we did not observe any cfw - mediated protection from uv365 nm inhibition in our studies .
possible photoinactivation of cfw by uv light raises the concern that efficacy of topical cfw treatment could be reduced by exposure to sunlight .
however , given that topical application concentrations of cfw would be higher than the mic of the infecting fungus , and uv irradiation in these experiments is at substantially higher levels than that present in natural sunlight , photoinactivation effects would be negligible , and could be avoided completely by covering the treatment area .
drug interactions with cfw combination drug treatment regimes may provide a broader spectrum of action and reduce the emergence of drug resistance .
therefore , using checkerboard assays , we investigated whether cfw had synergistic inhibitory effects with other inhibitors of t. rubrum and / or c. albicans with differing cellular targets .
all mic80 results are listed in table 3 .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0039405.g002 figure 2 disc diffusion assays showing enhanced c. albicans inhibition when treated with cfw and ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors .
starting at the bottom right disc and moving clockwise , the amounts of each drug added per disc included 14.11 , 3.52 , 1.41 and 0 ng of itraconazole , 8.32 , 2.08 , 0.83 , and 0 ng of miconazole , and 6.07 , 1.52 , 0.61 , and 0 ng of fenpropimorph .
drugs were diluted in dmso , and dmso comprised the no - drug control .
nikkomycin z inhibits chitin synthase , reducing levels of the cfw target , chitin [ 59 ] .
conversely , treatment with cfw and other fluorescent brighteners increases chitin production in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans [ 19 ] , [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] .
therefore , we predicted that nikkomycin z would be antagonistic with cfw , as has been observed previously with nikkomycin z and cfw and related fluorescent brighteners in s. cerevisiae [ 59 ] , [ 62 ] .
for t. rubrum , nikkomycin z had no inhibitory effect alone and did not affect sensitivity to cfw .
however , consistent with previous results , increasing amounts of nikkomycin z antagonized c. albicans sensitivity to cfw , increasing the cfw mic80 to > 45.85 microg / ml with nikkomycin z concentrations at , or exceeding , 6.19 microg / ml. manumycin a inhibits farnesyltransferases , a target not yet exploited for fungicides .
we found that manumycin a inhibited both t. rubrum ( mic80 10.32 microg / ml ) and c. albicans ( mic80 22.02 microg / ml ) and was fungicidal to t. rubrum ( mfc99 20.64 microg / ml ; mfcs were not tested for c. albicans ) .
the fic values for treatment with cfw and manumycin a were 2 for t. rubrum and 0.75 for c. albicans ; thus the drug interaction in both species was indifferent .
the antibiotic griseofulvin binds tubulin , interfering with microtuble function and inhibiting mitosis , and is administered orally for dermatophyte infections .
although c. albicans was not inhibited by griseofulvin at the concentrations used (<= 22.92 microg / ml ) , t. rubrum was sensitive with an mic80 of 0.55 microg / ml , comparable with previous results ( 0.125 - 4 microg / ml , incubation at 28degreesc , 7 days [ 63 ]) , and the interaction of griseofulvin in combination with cfw was indifferent ( fic 1 ) .
the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin inhibits the tor pathway via binding to fkbp12 [ 64 ] , and is synergistic with other antifungals [ 65 ] , [ 66 ] .
although the use of an immunosuppressant may not be recommended as an orally administered antifungal treatment since many patients are already immunocompromised , topical applications may have utility .
while rapamycin did not inhibit t. rubrum at the concentrations used (<= 45.71 microg / ml ) , we observed a positive interaction with cfw treatment , with a four - fold reduced cfw mic80 at rapamycin concentrations >= 1.43 microg / ml. rapamycin treatment reduced the cfw mic80 in c. albicans , although the fic observed of 0.75 is defined as indifferent .
the azole drugs ( clotrimazole , itraconazole , miconazole , thioconazole and voriconazole ) inhibit lanosterol 14alpha - demethylase , the allylamine drugs ( butenafine hcl and terbinafine hcl ) inhibit squalene epoxidase , and the morpholine fenpropimorph inhibits both sterol c8 - c7 isomerase and c - 14 - reductase ; all of these enzymes are required for the synthesis of the membrane component ergosterol [ 26 ] .
for t. rubrum , sensitivities to ergosterol synthesis inhibitors in the absence of cfw were comparable to previously published result ranges , for example the voriconazole mic80 of 0.014 microg / ml , miconazole mic80 of 0.150 microg / ml , and clotrimazole mic80 of 0.034 microg / ml , were within the published ranges of 0.008 - 0.06 microg / ml ( for incubation at 35degreesc ) [ 28 ] , 0.031 - 4 microg / ml , and 0.031 - 0.5 microg / ml ( for incubation at 28degreesc , 7 days ) [ 63 ] , respectively .
we found no synergistic interaction for cfw with any of the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors .
butenafine hcl and terbinafine hcl did not inhibit c. albicans at any of the concentration tested .
the c. albicans mic80 s for other ergosterol biosynthesis - inhibiting drugs were also within published ranges for microdilution assays incubated at 35degreesc , for example the voriconazole mic80 of 0.011 microg / ml and itraconazole mic80 of 0.022 microg / ml , were within the range of 0.007 - 1 microg / ml [ 31 ] , 0.008 - 2 microg / ml [ 67 ] , respectively .
clotrimazole , itraconazole , thioconazole , and voriconazole all reduced the cfw mic80 for c. albicans , however , fic values were all within the range considered indifferent .
despite the interaction between these drugs and cfw being designated as indifferent , we observed increased halos of inhibition by a subset of these compounds ( itraconazole , fig. 2 ; and clotrimazole , data not shown ) in the presence of cfw .
interestingly , miconazole and fenpropimorph were both synergistic in combination with cfw ( fic 0.26 and 0.13 , respectively ) .
disc diffusion assays also indicated enhanced inhibition of c. albicans by combination treatments of cfw and miconazole , and fenpropimorph , than either drug individually .
not only did cfw result in wider halos of inhibition for each drug , but also the elimination of the partial growth of colonies within halos observed for each drug in the absence of cfw ( fig. 2 ) .
chitin synthesis is under tight spatial and temporal regulation , and cell wall perturbations caused by cfw treatment trigger signaling cascades , such as the hog , pkc and calcineurin pathways , to respond to cell wall damage and make compensatory changes in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans [ 60 ] , [ 68 ] .
therefore , drugs that either affect chitin levels or signaling cascades that respond to cfw - mediated perturbations could have interactions with cfw .
for example , in addition to the nikkomycin z / fluorescent brightener antagonism discussed previously [ 62 ] , pretreatment with cfw ameliorates c. albicans sensitivity to echinocandin by stimulation of chitin synthesis [ 69 ] .
a mechanism for the positive interaction between ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition and cfw in c. albicans is unclear , although synergism between inhibition of chitin synthesis ( nikkomycin z ) and azoles has also been demonstrated in this species [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] , [ 72 ] .
the synergism between nikkomycin z and azoles has been attributed to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors perturbing the synthesis , transport to the membrane , or stability of membrane - located chitin synthase [ 71 ] , [ 73 ] , [ 74 ] .
however , given our results that the chitin synthase inhibitor nikkomycin z is antagonistic rather than synergistic with cfw , any inhibition of chitin production by ergosterol inhibitors would not explain the synergistic interaction with cfw observed in c. albicans .
others have reported that reduced ergosterol production instead causes enhanced chitin synthesis and irregular distribution , which could be detrimental to cells already compromised in chitin assembly and cell wall integrity by cfw treatment , and indeed , results in sensitivity to cfw [ 75 ] .
to test whether reduced cell wall integrity contributed to the synergistic effect of cfw and ergosterol inhibitors , we determined the effect of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol on cfw and fenpropimorph combination treatment of c. albicans using checkerboard assays .
the presence of sorbitol ( 1 m ) increased by > 2 - fold the individual cfw mic80 , and did not alter the individual fenpropimorph mic80 .
consistent with the reduced cell wall integrity hypothesis , sorbitol addition partially ameliorated inhibition by fenpropimorph in the presence of cfw , with a 4 - fold increased cfw concentration required to inhibit growth in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of fenpropimorph for which a synergistic interaction was previously observed .
in contrast to c. albicans , the lack of synergistic interaction between ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and cfw in t. rubrum may be due to different mechanisms of regulation of chitin synthesis between the divergent species , and the possibility that in addition to chitin binding , cfw may also effect t. rubrum growth by binding beta - glucan present in the outermost cell layer of this species .
conclusions in an endeavor to extend the compendium of effective treatments for superficial mycoses , we have identified various cfw - related stilbene fluorescent brighteners and stilbene phytoalexins with fungicidal activity against a representative strain of both t. rubrum and c. albicans .
furthermore , we found several synergistic interactions with cfw and clinically relevant ergosterol synthesis - inhibiting antifungal drugs for c. albicans , offering potential for combination treatments that increase the spectrum of antifungal activity , while reducing the chance of drug resistance arising .
the efficacy of particular cfw and related compound treatments and combinations may be somewhat environment - , strain - , species - , and cell morphology - specific due to the differences in mechanisms controlling chitin synthesis and differences in cell wall composition .
therefore , in the future it would be interesting to test our findings using more c. albicans and t. rubrum isolates , different dermatophyte species , to compare hyphal and arthrospore susceptibilities , and in different environmental conditions such as high and low temperatures .
nonetheless , the importance of chitin in the cell walls of spores , hyphae and yeast cells of fungi suggest that targeting this unexploited antifungal target with cfw and related compounds will have widespread application against all cell morphologies from evolutionarily diverged fungi .

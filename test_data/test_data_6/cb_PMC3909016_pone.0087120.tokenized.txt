glypican - 3 ( gpc3 ) has been reported to be a novel serum and histochemical marker for hcc .
the positivity or negativity for gpc3 in hepatic precancerous lesions , such as dysplastic nodules ( dn ) , has also been described .
moreover , our previous studies have demonstrated that some dn in liver cirrhosis represent monoclonal hyperplasia , and confirmed their neoplastic nature .
however , additional studies must be performed to investigate further the relationship between dn with gpc3 positivity and hcc .
thus , we first investigated the expression of gpc3 in 136 hcc and 103 small dn ( less than 1 cm in diameter ) by immunohistochemical staining and determined the clonality of 81 dn from female patients using x - chromosome inactivation mosaicism and polymorphism of androgen receptor ( ar ) gene .
then we examined these samples for chromosomal loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) at 11 microsatellite polymorphism sites .
the results demonstrated that gpc3 immunoreactivity was detected in 103 of 136 hcc ( 75.7 %) and 19 of 103 dn ( 18.4 %) , and the positive ratio correlated with hbsag positivity .
clonality assays showed that 15 gpc3 - positive dn from female patients , including 12 high - grade dn ( hgdn ) , and 28 ( 42.4 %) of 66 gpc3 - negative dn , were monoclonal .
in addition , among 19 gpc3 - positive dn , chromosomal loh was found at loci d6s1008 ( 100 % , 19 / 19 ) , d8s262 ( 52.6 % , 10 / 19 ) and d11s1301 ( 57.9 % , 11 / 19 ) .
however , the loh frequency in gpc3 - negative dn was 5.95 % ( 5 / 84 ) , 23.8 % ( 20 / 84 ) , and 4.76 % ( 4 / 84 ) in three loci , respectively .
thus , we concluded that gpc3 - positive dn , especially gpc3 - positive hgdn , was really a late premalignant lesion of hcc .

introduction hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide [ 1 ] .
up to 80 % of hccs develop in the setting of liver cirrhosis related to hepatitis b and c virus infections .
different lesions have been suggested to represent preneoplastic conditions in human liver .
they include dysplastic nodules ( dns ) and dysplastic foci ( df ) , which are further classified into large cell change ( lcc ) and small cell change ( scc ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ]. whether both of these types of lesions represent true precursor lesions and which of these precursors is more closely related to hcc are intensely debated .
mounting evidence suggests that scc represents precursor lesions that are more advanced than lcc in the course of human hepatocarcinogenesis [ 4 ] .
both lesions contain shorter telomeres compared with surrounding non - dysplastic hepatocytes of cirrhosis , but only scc shows a high prevalence of checkpoint abrogation .
the above data support the preneoplastic status of scc in human hepatocarcinogenesis .
dns , including low grade dysplastic nodular ( lgdn ) and high grade dysplastic nodular ( hgdn ) , are distinctly nodular lesion that differ from the surrounding liver parenchyma regarding size , color , and texture .
they are usually detected in cirrhotic livers , and most of them measure about 1 cm in diameter .
histologically , lgdn shows mild cytologic atypia and increase in cell density with a monotonous pattern compared with that of cirrhotic nodules .
lcc may be found , but scc is not present .
hgdn always shows a certain degree of cytological and architectural atypia but insufficient for a diagnosis of malignancy .
scc is frequently seen inside the nodule but lcc can also be detected .
the premalignant nature of dns has been supported by some evidences [ 5 ] .
regarding the occurrence of preneoplastic and neoplastic nodules during hepatocarcinogenesis as described by park [ 5 ] , these precancerous lesions develop gradually into early hcc which corresponds to in situ or microinvasive carcinoma ; and then develop into progressive hcc through the stage of " nodule - in - nodule " - type hcc .
in this line , we propose that surveillance of at - risk cirrhotic population with special focus to their genetic changes could aid in the earlier detection of hcc and may decrease its morbidity and mortality rates .
glypican - 3 ( gpc3 ) has been reported as a novel serum and histochemical marker for hcc by several groups [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
it is an oncofetal protein and expressed abundantly in the fetal liver .
it is also inactive in the normal adult liver , and shows great promise as an adjunct in the diagnosis of hcc .
positive immunostaining for gpc3 has been reported in 52.5 % to 85 % of hccs [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
simultaneously , the positivity for gpc3 of dn has been reported [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
however , it is not clear whether a few gpc3 - positive nodules are indicative of hcc and their molecular genetic changes .
monoclonality is a major characteristic of most tumors. by contrast , normal tissue and reactive hyperplasia are polyclonal .
a lesion , which is neoplasm or reactive hyperplasia , may be determined by clonality assay based on x - chromosome inactivation mosaicism and polymorphism at the phosphoglycerate kinase ( pgk ) and androgen receptor ( ar ) loci in female somatic cells .
in the previous studies , we ever examined the clonality of some small dn ( less than 1 cm in diameter ) in liver cirrhosis , and the results demonstrated that part of lgdn and all hgdn in liver cirrhosis tissue represented monoclonal hyperplasia .
the occurrence of hgdn with scc is a late event during dn progression and considered to be a premalignant morphologic phenotype [ 21 ] .
these observations further support the contention that dn is a premalignant lesion of hcc .
in order to assess further the relationship between dn with gpc3 immunostaining and hcc , we investigated the expression of gpc3 in 136 cases of hccs and 103 dn ( including 30 hgdn and 73 lgdn ) , and examined the clonality of dn from female patients using x chromosome inactivation mosaicism and polymorphism of androgen receptor ( ar ) genes in female somatic cells , and observed the chromosomal loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) of all dn at 11 microsatellite loci .
materials and methods 2.1 .
ethics statement the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics commission of the fourth military medical university in xi'an , china .
written informed consent from all participants involved in our study was obtained .
2.2 .
samples liver tissue samples from 136 surgically resected hcc , consisting of 128 cases with and 8 cases without clinical data , were collected between january 2007 and december 2011 from tangdu hospital , the fourth military medical university ( xi'an , china ) .
each case was examined by three pathologists and diagnosed according to the world health organization international histological classification of tumors .
hcc samples were graded according to edmondson 's criteria .
all samples were surgically resected , fixed in 10 g / l neutral formalin , and embedded in paraffin .
serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h / e ) .
103 small dn ( less than 1 cm in diameter ) , including 81 from females and 22 from males , was classified according to the criteria of the international working party .
specifically , the morphological characteristics of lgdn are same as that of so - called regenerative nodules .
they usually show mild increase in cell density with a monotonous pattern and / or clonal changes composed of glycogen - storing clear cells and glycogen - depleted amphophilic cells .
lgdn may show bland cytologic but not frank architectural atypia .
lcc is frequently seen inside and outside the nodules as microscopic dysplastic foci .
hgdn is composed of glycogen - storing clear cells and basophilic cells , and shows an increased cell density , a certain degree of cytological and architectural atypia , but insufficient for a diagnosis of malignancy .
scc is frequently seen inside the nodule .
2.3 .
immunohistochemistry sections ( 4 - microm thick ) from a representative block from each case were deparaffinized , rehydrated in graded alcohols , incubated with h2o2 to block the activity of endogenous peroxidases ; and then subjected to heat - induced epitope retrieval in 0.1 mol / l citrate buffer at ph 6.0 in a microwave for 20 minutes .
the slides were then incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody specific for gpc3 ( dilution , 1:200 , maixin ltd company , fuzhou , china ) for 2 hours at room temperature .
after incubation with a rabbit anti - mouse secondary antibody , a subsequent reaction was performed using a biotin - free horse - radish peroxidase enzyme - labeled polymer and visualized using the envision plus detection system .
the chromogen 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dako ) was used and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin .
placental tissues were used as positive controls .
nonspecific igg was used as a negative control .
the gpc3 staining was considered positive when the granular brown reaction was found in the cytoplasm and / or the membranes .
therefore , each case was observed by three pathologists .
in detail , immunoreactivity was determined semi - quantitatively by examining fields ( magnification , x200 ) .
using a ( 0 - 3 +) scale , the staining was described as 0 staining ( negative ) , 1 + staining (< 10 % of cells ) , 2 + staining ( 10 % - 25 % of cells ) , or 3 + staining (> 25 % of cells ) .
statistical analysis was performed using the 2 - tailed fisher exact test or the chi2 test with the yates continuity correction .
a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
2.4 .
laser microdissection and dna extraction we selected the corresponding paraffin block with dn , specially gpc3 - positive dn , according to the results of immunohistochemical staining , and then prepared eight serial 10 - microm tissue sections which were then placed on a uv - absorbing membrane for laser microdissection by lmd6000 ( leica microsystems ltd , wetzlar , germany ) .
after he staining , the slides were mounted on a microstat , and the selected nodules were dissected by a uv laser through motorized optical beam scanning .
the dissected tissues ( with the attached specimen ) were pooled into the cap of a 0.5 - ml microcentrifuge tube that was filled with 40 microl lysate buffer and 10 microl protease k. along with each dissected nodule , the surrounding normal liver tissue of the same size was isolated and analyzed as a control .
the microcentrifuge tubes were placed in a waterbath ( 48degreesc ) to digest the tissue specimens .
after digestion for 12 - 20 h , genomic dna was extracted using qiagen blood & tissue kit ( germany ) and confirmed by gel electrophoresis ( 20 g / l agarose ) , and then stored at - 20degreesc until use .
2.5 .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplification for clonality nested polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was used to amplify the length polymorphism of cag short - tandem repeat ( str ) in exon 1 of the ar gene loci as described previously [ 22 ] .
the genomic dna extracted from dn and the surrounding normal liver tissues for the ar gene 10 microl each , was incubated with 5 u of hha i ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) at 37degreesc for 3 h in a volume of 20 microl containing 2 microl of 10x reaction buffer .
the digested dna samples , 1 microl each , were then subjected to nested pcr .
the reaction mixture was 50microl in volume , containing 4 microl of 10 mm dntp ( gibco brl , life technologies , inc. , gaithersburg , md , usa ) , primers ar1a and ar1b ( 20 microm each ) , and 5 microl of 10x buffer , 1.5 microl of 50 mm mgcl2 and 2.5u of taq dna polymerase ( gibco brl ) .
the amplification was conducted using a pt - 200 thermocycler ( mj research , inc. , watertown , ma , usa ) for 25 cycles ( 94degreesc for 40 sec , 56degreesc for 50 sec , and 72degreesc for 1 min ) for the first round .
pcr products ( 1 microl ) were used as templates for a second pcr reaction using primers ar2a and ar2b .
the amplification procedure was the same as that in the first round .
finally , the amplification efficiency was checked by resolving pcr reaction aliquots on 2 % agarose gels .
the pcr products , 4 ul for each , were also mixed with the same volume of loading buffer ( 1 g / l xylene cyanole , 1 g / l bromophenol blue , in formamide ) , and resolved on an 8 % polyacrylamide gel containing 8 mol / l urea using the mini - ve system ( amersham biosciences , san francisco , ca , usa ) at 120 v for 4 h. bands were visualized using silver staining .
2.6 .
analysis and assessment of pcr products images of pcr gels were recorded and the intensities of the pcr bands for both alleles were quantified using an image - analyzing system ( labworks 3.0 , uvp , cambridge , uk ) .
a reduction in fluorescence intensity of at least 50 % for either band , as compared to the intensity of the bands obtained in the absence of hha i digestion , was used as an indicator of a loss of x chromosome inactivation mosaicism [ 22 ] .
a corrected ratio ( cr ) was calculated by dividing the ratio of the upper - band intensity to the lower - band intensity , or vice - versa , of the same sample before and after digestion to give a cr value > 1 .
in the present study , a cr value >= 2 was used to define a loss of x chromosome inactivation mosaicism .
2.7 .
loh analysis the dn and the surrounding normal liver tissues were analyzed for loh by pcr amplification of polymorphic microsatellite markers .
eleven microsatellite markers ( table 1 ) were selected according to our previous data of loh loci that occur at high frequency in hcc .
for pcr amplification , 1 microl dna samples were subjected to pcr .
the reaction mixture was 50microl in volume and contained 1.25 microl of 10 mm dntp ( gibco brl , life technologies , inc. , gaithersburg , md , usa ) , primers 1a and 1b ( 20 microm each ) , and 5 microl of 10x buffer , and 2.5u of taq dna polymerase ( gibco brl ) .
the amplification was conducted using a pt - 200 thermocycler ( mj research , inc. , watertown , ma , usa ) for 35 cycles or 25 cycles ( 95degreesc for 40 sec , 60degreesc for 50 sec , and 72degreesc for 1 min ) .

results 3.1 .
clinicopathologic features of hcc of the 128 patients with clinical data , there were 108 males and 20 females , with a male - to - female ratio of 5.4:1 .
there were 82 ( 75.9 %) males and 17 ( 85 %) females with liver cirrhosis .
the ages of patients with hcc ranged from 27 to 84 years ( mean : 52 years ) .
unfortunately , no other information was obtained in 26 out of 128 patients except for age , sex , and hcc grade .
hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) were detected in the sera of 61.76 % ( 63 / 102 ) and 5.88 % ( 6 / 102 ) patients , respectively .
56.86 % ( 58 / 102 ) of patients had elevated serum alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) levels with values of 21.51 - 35350 ng / ml. histopathologically , 10.94 % ( 14 / 128 ) of hcc were well - differentiated , 60.93 % ( 78 / 128 ) were moderately differentiated , and 28.13 % ( 36 / 128 ) were poorly differentiated ( table 2 ) .

gpc3 expression in hcc and dn we assayed for gpc3 expression in 136 cases of hcc , and found that 103 cases ( 75.7 %) stained positive for gpc3 .
the amount of reactivity was graded as 1 + (< 10 % of cells ) in 13 cases ( 12.62 %) , 2 + ( 10 % - 25 % of cells ) in 22 cases ( 21.36 %) , and 3 + (> 25 % of cells ) in 68 cases ( 66.02 %) .
next , we evaluated the expression of gpc3 in relation to the clinicopathological features , such as age , sex , afp level and hbsag or hcv in serum , hcc differentiation , tumor size , and metastasis .
gpc3 expression closely correlated with hbsag positivity ( p < 0.05 ) .
although gpc3 expression was higher in moderately and poorly differentiated hcc than in well differentiated hcc , this difference in expression was not statistically significant ( p = 0.295 ) .
similarly , the difference in gpc3 expression in hccs with or without extrahepatic metastasis did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.959 ) ( table 2 ) .
moreover , we found 3 different immunostaining patterns in gpc3 positivity for hcc : predominantly cytoplasm ( figure1a ) , predominantly membrane ( figure1c , d ) , and both membrane and cytoplasm ( figure1b ) .
however , these 3 different staining patterns did not appear to correlate with the differentiation status of hcc , ages , and gender .

a ) weakly positive ; b , c , and d ) strongly positive .
gpc3 staining was performed in 103 dn , including 30 hgdn and 73 lgdn .
the results demonstrated that 19 dn ( 18.4 %) , including 15 hgdn and 4 lgdn , were positive ( table 3 ) .
the ratio of hgdn ( 15 / 30 , 50 %) was obviously higher than that of lgdn ( 4 / 73 , 5.48 %) , and this difference is statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 4 , 5 ) .
the amount of reactivity was graded as 1 + (< 10 % of cells ) in 4 cases ( 21.05 %) , 2 + ( 10 % - 25 % of cells ) in 10 cases ( 52.63 %) , and 3 + (> 25 % of cells ) in 5 cases ( 26.32 %) .
moreover , we noticed that there were two types of gpc3 expression in dn. only several hepatocytes were positive for gpc3 in some dn ( figure2 ) , but the whole nodule was positive for gpc3 in the other dn ( figure3 ) .
the positive immunostaining pattern of gpc3 for dn was similar to that in hcc .
namely , the positive reactivity for gpc3 was predominantly in membrane ( figure3a , 3b , 3c , and 3f ) or cytoplasm ( figure3d , and 3e ) .

3.3 .
gpc3 expression in hcc and its adjacent dn in the same patient , we found that gpc3 expression in hcc to be congruent with the adjacent dn. in other words , gpc3 was detected in the adjacent hcc if it was also detected in the dn ( figure2 , and figure3 ) .
on the contrary , it was not necessary to express gpc3 in the adjacent dn if it was positive for hcc .
thus , we concluded that gpc3 - positive dn was closely related to hcc .

3.4 .
clonality determination of dn the clonality assay was used to detect the nature of 81 dn from females at the ar loci .
in these samples , 15 gpc3 - positive dn ( including 12 hgdn and 3 lgdn ) and 28 ( 12 hgdn and 16 lgdn ) out of 66 gpc3 - negative dn showed loss of x - chromosomal inactivation mosaicism upon digestion with hha i ( table 3 and table 4 ) .
in other words , all of hgdn ( 100 % , 24 / 24 ) and 33.3 % ( 19 / 57 ) lgdn were monoclonal .
the results further confirmed our previous observations [ 21 ] .
the ar pcr gel pictures showed that the dna samples obtained from tissues without hha i digestion produce two bands .
when the dna samples from dn with gpc3 - positive reactivity were digested with hha i , one of the two bands disappeared , indicating neoplastic hyperplasia .
however , the surrounding normal liver tissue digested with hha i still showed two bands with equal intensities ( figure4 ) .
in addition , we found that 3 gpc3 - positive lgdn with monoclonal hyperplasia were from two patients without hgdn ( case 13 and case 15 , table 3 ) .

this indicated that part of gpc3 - positive lgdn might directly progress into hcc .

loh analysis loh was detected at the loci d8s262 , d11s1301 and d6s1008 , but not at other microsatellite markers .
in the 19 gpc3 - positive dn , chromosomal loh was found at loci d8s262 ( 52.6 % , 10 / 19 ) , d11s1301 ( 57.9 % , 11 / 19 ) and d6s1008 ( 100 % , 19 / 19 ) ( table 6 , figure 5 ) .
however , the frequency of loh in gpc3 - negative dn was 23.8 % ( 20 / 84 ) , 4.76 % ( 4 / 84 ) , and 5.95 % ( 5 / 84 ) , in the above three loci , respectively .
namely , fisher 's exact test demonstrated that the frequency of loh was differentially higher in gpc3 - positive dn compared to gpc3 - negative dn at the above three loci ( table 6 ) .
moreover , this difference is also statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , the ratio of hgdn was higher than lgdn once there was chromosomal loh at any loci .
this indicated that there was a close relationship between hgdn and its adjacent hcc .

discussion glypican - 3 ( gpc3 ) is an oncofetal antigen and a member of the glypican family of the membrane - bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans .
it has roles in the development and regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis in specific tissues [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
the gene is expressed in fetal liver and progenitor cells , as well as in many cases of hcc and in other tissues .
recently , several studies have demonstrated that gpc3 is positive in most hcc , and positive immunostaining has been detected in 52.5 % to 85 % of hcc , but not in healthy livers or various benign liver lesions , including cirrhotic livers , hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia .
this pattern of expression suggests great promise for gpc3 as a diagnostic marker of hcc [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
in our studies , gpc3 immunoreactivity was detected in 103 of 136 hcc cases ( 75.7 %) , and gpc3 expression was closely related with hbsag positivity , but not with sex , hcc differentiation , age , serum afp level , tumor size , and extrahepatic metastasis .
the high expression of gpc3 in hcc is similar to previous studies [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , and further supports the diagnostic value of gpc3 for hcc .
however , some authors have demonstrated positive staining in benign liver nodules ranging from none [ 25 ] to 7 % to 22 % of hgdn [ 6 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] and to 75 % of hgdn and 25 % of lgdn [ 19 ] .
other reports have found variable degrees of positivity in benign cirrhotic nodules , although the staining is usually described as weak and focal [ 19 ] .
moreover , some authors considered that the transition from premalignant lesions to small hcc is associated with a sharp increase in gpc3 expression in a majority of cases .
simultaneously , the occurrence of small focal positivity for gpc3 in liver cirrhosis indicated strongly hcc regardless of the percentage of positive cells for gpc3 [ 10 ] .
thus , gpc3 positive liver nodules may have important value for monitoring the occurrence and early diagnosis of hcc .
like other cancers , hcc is also characterized by an obvious multistage process of tumor progression [ 5 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] based on histopathological and molecular studies .
the greatest number of hcc occurs mainly in liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis b and c infection .
precancerous lesions known as df and dn also appear in the chronically diseased liver , especially cirrhotic liver .
thus , it is of clinical importance to investigate the expression of gpc3 in precancerous lesion , the relationship between gpc3 - positive nodules and hcc , and whether there is a genetic link between gpc3 - positive nodules and hcc .
monoclonality is an important characteristic of most tumors .
in our previous studies , we ever microdissected 93 nodular lesions from 9 liver cirrhosis tissues from female patients , observed their histopathological features , and examined their clonality status .
the results showed that loss of x chromosomal inactivation mosaicism was detected in 3 large regenerative nodules and 12 hgdn , indicating their neoplastic nature .
among the 60 lgdn , 29 ( 48.3 %) were shown to be monoclonal , while 4 clear - cell lesions and 14 regenerative nodules were found to be polyclonal .
thus , we concluded that some dn in the hbv - associated liver cirrhosis , particularly hgdn , was already neoplastic lesions .
hgdn with scc is a late event during dn progression and suggests a premalignant phenotype [ 21 ] .
in this study , we firstly found that 19 out of 103 dn ( 18.4 %) , including 15 ( 50 % , 15 / 30 ) hgdn and 4 ( 5.48 % , 4 / 73 ) lgdn , were positive for gpc3 .
the ratio of hgdn expression was higher obviously than that of lgdn expression for gpc3 .
the results were similar to that reported in literatures .
therefore , gpc3 expression in hcc was congruent with the adjacent dn in the same patient .
in other words , gpc3 was detected in the adjacent hcc if it was also detected in the dn. on the contrary , it was not necessary to express gpc3 in adjacent dn if it was positive for hcc .
thus , we concluded that gpc3 - positive dn , especially gpc3 - positive hgdn , was closely related to hcc .
second , we found that all 15 gpc3 - positive dn and 28 gpc3 - negative dn from females were monoclonal .
moreover , all 24 hgdn from females were monoclonal regardless whether they expressed gpc3 .
these results support further that there is a close relationship between gpc3 - positive dn in cirrhotic hepatic tissues and hcc though it remains controversial to use gpc3 to screen for premalignant hepatic lesions [ 13 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 30 ] .
at least we can consider gpc3 - positive dn , especially hgdn , to be late precancerous lesion of hcc , making it possible to monitor for the occurrence of hcc. of course , additional studies must be performed to investigate the potential role of gpc3 during liver cirrhosis transformation to hcc .
in addition , we found that 3 gpc3 - positive lgdn with monoclonal hyperplasia were from two patients without hgdn .
moreover , the 3 gpc3 - positive lgdn located in adjacent hcc .
this indicated that part of gpc3 - positive lgdn might directly progress into hcc .
interestingly , we observed that only several cells were positive for gpc3 in a few lgdn .
however , the clonal assay revealed that these dn were also monoclonal .
the most likely explanation for this is that these gpc3 - positive cells are the ones that will eventually transform to hcc during hepatocarcinogenesis. of course , further studies are required to determine the pathogenesis , significance , and other potential diagnostic uses of gpc3 in non - neoplastic liver disease. of course , clonal assays based on x - chromosome inactivation mosaicism and polymorphism of ar gene used in this study has its limitations .
specifically , it can only be used to analyze samples from female individuals .
molecular genetic studies have revealed that the occurrence of malignant tumors is related to the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes ( tsg ) .
an important form of tsg inactivation is the mutation of one allele and the loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) of the other allele .
to further expand our analyses and confirm further our conclusions , we selected 11 microsatellite markers to assess the chromosomal loh of 81 dn from females and 22 dn from males .
the results demonstrated that a high frequency of loh was detected at loci d6s1008 , d8s262 and d11s1301 , respectively .
moreover , the loh frequency was significantly higher in gpc3 - positive dn than in gpc3 - negative dn at any loci .
this indicated that genetic changes occurred in these gpc3 - positive dn , further supporting that they represented the premalignant lesions of hcc .
moreover , the ratio of hgdn was higher than lgdn once there was chromosomal loh at any loci .
this indicated that there was a close relationship between hgdn and its adjacent hcc .
thus , we concluded that gpc3 - positive dn , especially gpc3 - positive hgdn , might be considered as a biomarker for the early diagnosis and detection of hcc .
moreover , the tumor suppressor gene adjacent to d6s1008 , d8s262 and d11s1301 may be related to the occurrence of early hcc .
in conclusions , we concluded that gpc3 - positive dn , especially gpc3 - positive hgdn , was really a late premalignant lesion of hcc .

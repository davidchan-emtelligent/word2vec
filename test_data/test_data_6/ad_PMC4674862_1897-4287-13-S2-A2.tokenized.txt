little is known about the etiology of the disease despite significant new insights into the mutation signatures common this disease .
changes in microelements serum levels are reported in pancreatic cancer .
in the current study we have examined the levels of se , cu , fe , zn and mg in a moderately sized pancreatic cancer population and compared it to a healthy age - matched population .
material and methods a total of 84 pancreatic cancer patients and 84 aged - matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study after providing informed consent .
the patients with pancreatic cancer were enrolled to the study from the hospital of the ministry of internal affairs and administration in szczecin , poland .
for each pancreatic cancer patient included in this study an unaffected individual registered in international hereditary cancer center , pomeranian medical university of szczecin , was used as a control .
each person enrolled in the study donated ~ 10 ml edta blood for sufficient serum to be isolated and examined for the elements se , cu , fe , zn and mg. the level of se , cu , fe , zn and mg , in the serum was determined by mass spectrometry inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( elan drc - e , perkinelmer ) .

there is a very strong correlation between the level of selenium , copper in serum and the occurrence of pancreatic cancers in the polish population .
2. the se , cu level in serum may be a useful diagnostic tool of pancreatic cancer .
3. further investigations are needed to determine if se , cu levels can be used in : a. differential diagnosis between pancreatic cancer ( pc ) and non - malignant pancreatic lesions b. monitoring of systemic treatment efficiency in pc c. identification of prognostic factors of pancreatic tumors d. identification of factor of pc causative

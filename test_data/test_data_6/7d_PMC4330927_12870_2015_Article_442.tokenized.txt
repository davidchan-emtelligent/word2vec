background rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide .
we previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene pid2 , which encodes a transmembrane receptor - like kinase containing an extracellular b - lectin domain and an intracellular serine / threonine kinase domain .
however , little is known about pid2 - mediated signaling .
results here we report the functional characterization of the u - box / arm repeat protein ospub15 as one of the pid2 - binding proteins .
we found that ospub15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of pid2 ( pid2k ) in vitro and in vivo and the arm repeat domain of ospub15 was essential for the interaction .
in vitro biochemical assays indicated that pid2k possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate ospub15 .
we also found that the phosphorylated form of ospub15 possessed e3 ligase activity .
expression pattern analyses revealed that ospub15 was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein ospub15 was localized in cytosol .
transgenic rice plants over - expressing ospub15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses , including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide , up - regulated expression of pathogenesis - related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains .
we also observed that , along with plant growth , the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype .
conclusions these results reveal that the e3 ligase ospub15 interacts directly with the receptor - like kinase pid2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance .

keywords u - box e3 ligase protein interaction blast resistance cell death rice issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background plants respond to pathogen infection using their innate immunity system , which includes two layers , pathogen / microbe - associated molecular pattern ( pamp / mamp ) - triggered immunity ( pti ) and effector - triggered immunity ( eti ) [ 1,2 ] .
pti , also known as the plant basal defense , is mediated by plant pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) through recognizing the conserved microbial features pamps / mamps [ 3,4 ] .
compared to eti , pti mediates a relatively weaker immune response with broad - spectrum defense against pathogens .
there are some typical downstream responses in this pathway , including the activation of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , rapid production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and the induction of pathogenesis - related ( pr ) genes [ 5 - 7 ] .
when pathogens develop specific effectors to suppress pti , plants evolve corresponding resistance proteins to recognize these effectors and lead to eti , a much more rapid and robust immune response [ 8 ] .
besides the signaling process present in pti , hypersensitive response ( hr ) , a form of localized programmed cell death ( pcd ) at the infection sites of plant to prevent the spread of pathogens , is usually accompanied with eti [ 9 ] .
some plant mutants develop spontaneous cell death lesions similar to hr cell death in the absence of pathogen infection and such mutants are called lesion mimic mutants [ 10,11 ] .
there are a lot of overlaps in the signal pathways of lesion mimic pcd and plant innate immunity , suggesting the existence of signaling crosstalk between them [ 12,13 ] .
protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( ups ) plays critical roles in plant immunity .
ups is used for selectively degrading proteins through a process of polyubiquitination in eukaryotic organisms .
ubiquitination of a target protein is carried out by attaching ubiquitin molecules to the target through a sequential action of ubiquitin - activating enzyme ( e1 ) , ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme ( e2 ) and ubiquitin protein ligase ( e3 ) .
the protein conjugated with a poly - ubiquitin chain is then targeted to the 26s proteasome for degradation [ 14,15 ] .
among the ups components , e3 ligases are the most diverse members as they determine the substrate specificity [ 16,17 ] .
e3 ligases can be classified into different groups based on the presence of specific hect , ring , or u - box domains [ 18,19 ] .
the u - box domain is a modified ring domain consisting of ~ 70 conserved amino acids [ 20,21 ] .
in both rice ( oryza sativa l. ) and arabidopsis thaliana , the largest group of predicted plant u - box proteins ( pubs ) contains varying repeats of c - terminal armadillo ( arm ) motif which are involved in the protein - protein interactions [ 22 - 24 ] .
many plant u - box / arm repeat proteins have been identified as active e3 ligases with important roles in diverse biological processes , such as self - incompatibility [ 25,26 ] , plant hormone responses [ 27 - 30 ] , abiotic stresses [ 31 - 35 ] , flowering time [ 36,37 ] , plant cell death and defense responses [ 36,38 - 42 ] .
rice blast disease , caused by the fungus of magnaporthe oryzae ( m. oryzae ) , is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide [ 43 ] .
to date , more than two dozens of rice blast resistance genes have been cloned and characterized , but the immediate downstream signaling events mediated by these resistance genes are largely unknown .
the rice blast resistance gene pid2 encodes a transmembrane b - lectin receptor - like kinase [ 44 ] .
to identify the interaction partners of pid2 , we formerly used the intracellular kinase domain of pid2 as bait to screen a rice cdna library via yeast two - hybrid approach and obtained some binding proteins [ 45 ] .
among them , a protein encoded by loc _ os08g01900 was previously reported as a u - box / arm repeat protein called ospub15 [ 23 ] .
here , we report that ospub15 is able to interact directly with the kinase domain of pid2 in vitro and in vivo .
our study also reveals that ospub15 could be phosphorylated by pid2k in an arm - dependent manner and the phosphorylated ospub15 exhibits e3 ligase activity .
furthermore , overexpression of ospub15 in rice leads to a spontaneous cell death phenotype and a constitutive activation of plant basal defense response .
these findings demonstrate that ospub15 plays critical roles in plant cell death and innate immunity .
results ospub15 is a u - box / arm repeat protein the previous study identified ospub15 as one of the pid2k - interacting proteins through yeast two - hybrid screening [ 45 ] .
according to the rice genome annotation database ( http :// rice.plantbiology.msu.edu ) , ospub15 is annotated as a putative arm ( armadillo ) repeat family protein composed of 824 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximate 90 kd. the smart ( http :// smart.embl - heidelberg.de /) database shows that ospub15 contains a conserved u - box domain spanning the amino acid residues 232 to 295 and five tandem repeats of arm motifs in its c terminus ( figure 1 ) .
phylogenetic analysis on the arm repeat - containing pubs revealed that ospub15 was most closely related to ntpub4 ( 51.8 % sequence identity ) and atpub4 ( 50.4 % sequence identity , additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
ntpub4 was reported to interact directly with the receptor - like kinase chrk1 and it was predicted to be involved in modulating the plant developmental signaling pathway mediated by chrk1 [ 46 ] .
atpub4 was identified to influence male fertility through impacting growth and degeneration of tapetal cells of arabidopsis [ 47 ] .
in rice , ospub15 was grouped into cluster i of the rice u - box / arm repeat protein subfamily [ 22,23 ] and it was found to share the highest sequence similarity ( 50.2 % identity , 65.7 % similarity ) with ospub16 , an uncharacterized pid2k - interacting protein [ 45 ] .
figure 1 predicted amino acid ( aa ) sequence of ospub15 .
the u - box domain from amino acid 232 to 295 is underlined , in which the conserved amino acids are indicated in bold .
five arm repeat motifs in the c - terminal region are separately shown in italics .
the arm repeat domain of ospub15 is required for directly interacting with pid2k to confirm the interaction between ospub15 and pid2k detected from the yeast - two - hybrid system , we performed in vitro pull down assays .
for these assays , pid2k was expressed in frame with glutathione s transferase ( gst ) in yeast and ospub15 was expressed as a his - tagged fusion protein in escherichia coli ( e. coli ) , respectively .
the expressed gst - pid2k was then purified with glutathione sepharose 4b beads and incubated with the purified his - ospub15 .
following extensive washings , the proteins bound to the beads were separated by sds - page and immunoblotted with anti - ospub15 and anti - gst antibodies , respectively .
we found that the anti - ospub15 antibody was able to specifically detect a clear band about 90 kd as the size of ospub15 from the components pulled down by gst - pid2k ( figure 2b , lane 4 ) whereas no band was detected from those pulled down by gst alone ( figure 2b , lane 5 ) .
this result reveals that ospub15 is able to interact with pid2k directly , which is consistent with the result obtained from yeast - two - hybrid .

( b ) in vitro binding analysis of ospub15 and its truncated variants to the pid2 kinase domain .
the purified his - fusion proteins were separately mixed with equal quantities of resin bound gst - pid2k and then pulled down by the resin .
after extensive washings , the pull - down products were immunoblotted with anti - ospub15 ( top panel ) or anti - gst ( bottom panel ) antibody .
one - tenth of the input of purified his fusions , his - ospub15 ( lane 1 ) , his - ospub15c ( lane 2 ) and his - ospub15n ( lane 3 ) , were loaded as controls .
( c ) subcellular localization of ospub15 and pid2k , respectively .
rice protoplasts were co - transformed with the nuclear marker mcherry - vird2nls ( mcherry - nls ) accompanied with gfp alone ( top panel ) or gfp fused proteins ( middle and bottom panel ) driven by 35s promoter , respectively .
the panels from left to right are confocal micrographs of gfp signal ( green ) , mcherry signal ( red ) , bright - field images and the resultant overlaid images , respectively .

( d ) bifc analysis of in vivo interaction between pid2k and ospub15 or its variants .
pid2k and the ospub15 variants were respectively fused to the inactive n - terminal ( neyfp ) or the c - terminal ( ceyfp ) part of eyfp , and the pairs of indicated recombinant proteins were transiently expressed in rice protoplasts along with mcherry - vird2nls ( mcherry - nls ) , a nuclear marker .
the fluorescence signals were monitored by confocal microscopy .
the panel shows fluorescence images of the eyfp signal ( green ) , the mcherry signal ( red ) , the bright - field illumination of protoplasts and the overlaid images , respectively .
bars = 5 mum .
the above experiments were repeated three times with similar results .
in order to determine the fragment of ospub15 which is essential for its interaction with pid2k , two ospub15 variants , ospub15c ( c - terminus of ospub15 , amino acids 307 - 824 ) and ospub15n ( n - terminus of ospub15 , amino acids 1 - 351 , figure 2a ) were separately expressed as his - fused proteins and the purified his - ospub15c and his - ospub15n were respectively introduced into gst pull - down assays .
we found that the anti - ospub15 antibody was able to detect a positive band from the pulled down components of gst - pid2k post incubation with his - ospub15c ( figure 2b , lane 6 ) rather than with his - ospub15n ( figure 2b , lane 8 ) , whereas no band was detected from the pulled down components of gst post incubation with his - ospub15c or his - ospub15n ( figure 2b , lane 7 and lane 9 ) .
these results suggest that the c - terminal fragment containing the entire arm repeat domain of ospub15 is essential and sufficient for the interaction between ospub15 and pid2k .
to further verify the interaction between ospub15 and pid2k , we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( bifc ) assays .
before this analysis , we firstly determined the subcellular localization of ospub15 and pid2k , individually .
we fused the coding region of ospub15 and pid2k to the n - terminus of green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) , respectively , to produce the ospub15 - gfp and pid2k - gfp fusion proteins .
each of these fusion proteins under the control of camv 35s promoter was co - expressed with the nuclear marker mcherry - vird2nls in rice protoplasts , respectively .
we found that the fluorescence signals were present at cytosol when the protoplast cells were transformed with ospub15 - gfp , whereas the fluorescence signals were present at cytosol and nucleus when the protoplast cells were transformed with pid2k - gfp ( figure 2c ) .
these results suggest that ospub15 is located in cytosol while pid2k , the separated intracellular part of pid2 , distributes in both the nucleus and the cytosol of rice cells .
to further determine the domain required for ospub15 to interact with pid2k in vivo , we created another variant called ospub15n - 1 ( amino acids 1 - 506 , figure 2a ) , which is longer than ospub15n , and applied it to the following bifc assays .
pid2k and the variants of ospub15 were respectively fused to the split n - terminal ( neyfp ) and c - terminal ( ceyfp ) fragments of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein ( eyfp ) to generate the constructs , pid2k - neyfp , ospub15 - ceyfp , ospub15c - ceyfp and ospub15n - 1 - ceyfp .
the pairs , pid2k - neyfp / ospub15 - ceyfp , pid2k - neyfp / ospub15c - ceyfp and pid2k - neyfp / ospub15n - 1 - ceyfp , were respectively co - transformed with mcherry - vird2nls into rice protoplasts .
we detected the fluorescence signals in cytosol when the pair of pid2k - neyfp / ospub15 - ceyfp was co - transformed into protoplasts ( figure 2d ) , suggesting that ospub15 did interact with pid2k .
this result is consistent with the cytosolic co - localization of both pid2k and ospub15 ( figure 2c ) .
moreover , the fluorescence signals were also appeared in the cytosol of the protoplasts transformed with pid2k - neyfp / ospub15c - ceyfp , but not in the protoplasts transformed with pid2k - neyfp / ospub15n - 1 - ceyfp ( figure 2d ) , suggesting that the variant , ospub15c but not ospub15n - 1 interacts with pid2k .
together with the sequences and structures of ospub15c and ospub15n - 1 ( figure 2a ) , these results also suggest that the arm domain of ospub15 is essential for the interaction of ospub15 with pid2k in vivo .
ospub15 is transphosphorylated by pid2k in an arm - dependent manner since pid2k is the putative kinase domain of pid2 [ 44 ] , we were interested in determining whether pid2k really possessed kinase activity .
for this purpose , we performed in vitro phosphorylation assay on the purified protein gst - pid2k and found that the pid2k was capable of autophosphorylation ( figure 3a ) .
this result suggests that pid2 is an active kinase .
as ospub15 could interact with pid2k directly , we wondered whether pid2k was capable of phosphorylating ospub15 .
we then performed a similar kinase activity analysis on gst - pid2k co - incubated with the purified his - ospub15 .
we found that not only gst - pid2k but also his - ospub15 was phosphorylated , whereas , his - ospub15 was not phosphorylated when it was incubated in the absence of gst - pid2k ( figure 3a ) .
our results indicate that pid2k is able to transphosphorylate ospub15 and thus ospub15 is a substrate of the active kinase pid2k .
figure 3 the arm repeat domain is required for ospub15 to be phosphorylated by pid2k .
in vitro phosphorylation analysis of ospub15 ( a ) , ospub15n ( b ) , ospub15c - 1 ( c ) or ospub15c - 2 ( d ) by the kinase domain of pid2 .
the purified his fusion proteins were incubated with purified gst - pid2k in the presence of [ gamma - 32p ] atp .
gst - pid2k was used as a positive control .
samples were separated with sds - page followed by coommassie brilliant blue staining ( cbb staining ) and autoradiography ( autorad ) , respectively .
similar results were obtained from three independent experiments .
to examine whether the phosphorylation sites of ospub15 are in the arm repeat domain as it is responsible for interacting with pid2k , we conducted additional phosphorylation assays using the ospub15 variants as substrates .
to avoid the potential confusion likely caused by the same molecular weight ( 65 kd ) of his - ospub15c and gst - pid2k , his - ospub15c - 1 ( amino acids 481 - 824 , 45 kd ) , with different molecular weight , was created and used in the assays .
we found that his - ospub15c - 1 could be efficiently phosphorylated by gst - pid2k ( figure 3c ) , whereas his - ospub15n was not ( figure 3b ) .
furthermore , we also found that the variant ospub15c - 2 ( amino acids 611 - 824 ) containing only four arm motifs was sufficient for ospub15 to be phosphorylated by pid2k ( figure 3d ) .
these results suggest that the pid2k - phosphorylated residues are mainly distributed in the arm repeat domain of ospub15 .
phosphorylation is required for ospub15 to exhibit its e3 ligase activity as u - box proteins usually possess e3 ubiquitin ligase activity [ 22,28,48,49 ] , we presumed that ospub15 might function as an e3 ligase .
to test this hypothesis , we performed in vitro self - ubiquitination assay on bacterially expressed his - ospub15 .
however , no e3 ligase activity was detected for the purified his - ospub15 in the presence of wheat e1 , human e2 ( ubch5b ) and his - tagged ubiquitin as well as in the reactions lacking of e1 , e2 or his - ospub15 , while the positive control sdir1 showed strong self - ubiquitination activity evidenced by detection of high - molecular - weight bands with an antibody to ubiquitin ( additional file 1 : figure s2 ) .
we then performed additional ubiqutination assays on the purified his - ospub15 using ten different arabidopsis e2s , ats1 , ats2 , ats5 , ats6 , ats8 , ats9 , ats10 , ats12 , ubc4 and ubc32 , respectively , and found that his - ospub15 did not show any detectable e3 ligase activity when incubated with any of these e2s ( data not shown ) .
considering that post translational modification might be required for the e3 ligase activity of ospub15 , we pre - incubated the purified his - ospub15 with the total protein extracts of rice and used such pre - incubated his - ospub15 for the in vitro ubiquitination assay .
the result showed that such pre - treated his - ospub15 displayed e3 ligase activity in the presence of e1 , e2 , and ubiquitin ( figure 4a , lane 8 ). by contrast , no protein ubiquitination was detected on untreated his - ospub15 ( figure 4a , lane 4 ) as well as in the reactions lacking of e1 , e2 , or his - ospub15 ( figure 4a , lanes 1 - 3 , 5 - 7 ) .
these findings suggest that post translational modification is essential for ospub15 to exhibit its e3 ligase activity .
figure 4 the pre - treated ospub15 possesses e3 ligase activity .
( a ) e3 ligase activity analysis of pre - incubated his - ospub15 .
the purified his - ospub15 was incubated with total protein extracts of rice for one hour , and then was put into self - ubiquitination assays in the presence of wheat e1 , human e2 ( ubch5b ) and 6xhis tag ubiquitin ( his - ub ) or in the absence of e1 , e2 or his - ospub15 ( lanes 5 - 8 ) .
as a control , the un - pre - incubated his - ospub15 was included in the assays ( lanes 1 - 4 ) .
after the reactions , samples were separated by 12 % sds - page and immunoblotted with anti - ub ( top panel ) or anti - ospub15 ( bottom panel ) antibody .
( b ) e3 ligase activity analysis of pid2k - phosphorylated his - ospub15 .
the untreated his - ospub15 ( lanes 1 - 4 ) and the pid2k - phosphorylated his - ospub15 ( lanes 5 - 8 ) were assayed for ubiquitination activity , respectively .
the reaction products were immunoblotted with anti - ub ( top panel ) or anti - ospub15 ( bottom panel ) antibody .
these experiments were repeated three times with similar results obtained .
as ospub15 could be phosphorylated by pid2k , it was attractive for us to figure out whether the phosphorylation modification was required for ospub15 to be an active e3 ligase .
for this purpose , we carried out self - ubiquitination assay on the his - ospub15 pre - phosphorylated by gst - pid2k .
as expected , the results showed that the phosphorylated form of his - ospub15 indeed exhibited ubiquitination activity in the presence of e1 , e2 , and ubiquitin ( figure 4b , lane 8 ) , whereas no ubiquitination activity was detected on unphosphorylated his - ospub15 or in the reactions lacking of e1 , e2 , or his - ospub15 ( figure 4b , lanes 1 - 7 ) .
these results suggest that the phosphorylation modification by pid2k is required for ospub15 to release its e3 ligase activity .
ospub15 is constitutively expressed in rice plants to reveal the expression profile of ospub15 , we performed northern analysis on the rna samples prepared from diverse tissues , including root , stem , leaf , young panicle and mature panicle of the two rice cultivars , taipei309 ( tp309 ) and digu , using the cdna of ospub15 as the probe .
the result shows that ospub15 is ubiquitously expressed in the tested tissues of both rice cultivars , with relatively higher expression level in the leaf of tp309 and in the leaf , young panicle and mature panicle of digu as well ( figure 5a ) .
figure 5 expression pattern of ospub15 . ( a ) northern analysis of ospub15 in different tissues of rice cultivars tp309 and digu .
the total rnas extracted from various rice tissues were hybridized with 32p - labeled ospub15 probe , rrna signals were used as a sample loading control .
r , s , l , yp and mp denote root , stem , leaf , young panicle and mature panicle , respectively .
( b ) qrt - pcr analysis of ospub15 expression profiling in tp309 and digu at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 days post inoculation ( dpi ) with the blast strain zb15 .
the expression level of ospub15 at 0 day was set as 1.0 .
the expression level of rice actin1 gene was used as an internal control for normalization of the data .
values are means +/ - sds of three biological repeats .
because pid2 confers resistance to m. oryzae isolate zb15 [ 44 ] and ospub15 physically interacts with pid2k , we wondered whether the expression of ospub15 was affected by inoculation with zb15 .
to address this question , we carried out quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) analysis to examine the expression level of ospub15 in the resistant rice cultivar digu and the susceptible cultivar tp309 , respectively , post inoculation with zb15 .
we found no obvious changes in the expression level of ospub15 in both rice cultivars , which were well but differently responsive to the inoculation as expected ( figure 5b , additional file 1 : figure s3 ) .
this is consistent with the previous result that the expression level of pid2 was not affected by inoculation with zb15 either in susceptible or resistant rice varieties [ 44 ] .
overexpression of ospub15 leads to plant cell death accompanied with excessive accumulation of ros to investigate the biological function of ospub15 in rice , we subcloned the coding region of ospub15 into the binary vector ptck303 under the control of maize ubiquitin promoter to generate the ospub15 overexpression construct ( figure 6a ) .
we then introduced the construct and the empty vector into the calli derived from tp309 , respectively , by agrobacterium - mediated transformation .
we obtained more than 30 independent transgenic plants over - expressing ospub15 ( hereafter referred to as ospub15ox ) in total .
a few days after the regenerated transgenic rice plants produced , some brown lesions appeared spontaneously on the early - emerged old leaves of all the ospub15ox plants and the lesions spread over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in plants death within one month even under sterile conditions. by contrast , no morphological abnormalities were observed on the control transgenic plants expressing the empty vector ( figure 6b , additional file 1 : figure s4 ) .
quantitative rt - pcr analysis showed that the expression of ospub15 in randomly selected ospub15ox rice lines were up - regulated compared with that in control plants ( figure 6c ) .
these results indicate that overexpression of ospub15 leads to rice plants death as a result of uncontrolled propagation of spontaneous lesions .

( c ) qrt - pcr analysis of ospub15 expression in two - week - old ospub15ox plants and the control plants .
the expression level of ospub15 in the control plants was set as 1.0 .
the expression level of the rice actin1 gene was used as an internal control for normalization of the data .
data represent means +/ - sds of three replicates .
( d ) histochemical assays of the ospub15ox plants and the control plants .
leaves of two - week - old transgenic plants were stained with trypan blue ( left panel ) , dab ( middle panel ) or nbt ( right panel ) to indicate cell death , superoxide or hydrogen peroxide accumulation , respectively .
l3 and con represent ospub15ox line 3 and the control plants , respectively .
( e ) transcript expression analysis of pr genes in transgenic rice plants .
total rna was extracted from leaves of two - week - old transgenic plants .
rt - pcr was performed with specific primers for pr1a , pr1b , pr10 and pbz1 , respectively .
control rt - pcr reactions were conducted with rice actin1 .
con , l - , l + , l5 and l6 represent leaves of the control plants , later - emerged young leaves of ospub15ox before lesion formation , early - emerged old leaves of ospub15ox with lesions , total leaves of ospub15ox - l5 and ospub15ox - l6 , respectively .
( f ) disease resistance determination of ospub15ox seedlings to m. oryzae isolates .
the control rice seedlings and the ospub15ox seedlings were treated with indicated blast strains , and the responses were analyzed two days later .
the above experiments were repeated three times with similar results obtained .
to explore the biochemical mechanisms underlying the development of aggressive lesions in ospub15ox seedlings , we evaluated the expression of several histochemical markers in ospub15ox plants and control transgenic plants .
when stained with trypan blue , an indicator of irreversible membrane damage or cell death , cells at the lesion sites of ospub15ox leaves exhibited deep blue in color whereas the cells in the leaves of control transgenic plants did not ( figure 6d ) .
moreover , the dab ( diamino benzidine ) and nbt ( nitro blue tetrazolium ) staining analyses revealed that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , such as h2o2 and o2 - , were closely correlated with lesion formation in ospub15ox leaves .
on the contrary , no ros production was detected in leaves of the control transgenic plants ( figure 6d ) .
these results reveal that the development of cell death in ospub15ox plants is likely resulted from excessive accumulation of ros .
overexpression of ospub15 activates rice defense responses constitutively in most cases , the presence of lesion mimic cell death in plant is correlated with elevated expression of pathogen - related ( pr ) genes and enhanced resistance to pathogens [ 9,50 ] .
thus , we measured the transcript levels of four pr genes , pr1a , pr1b , pr10 and pbz1 , by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) analysis .
we found that the expression of all these genes were up regulated in the ospub15ox plants both before and after lesion appearance ( figure 6e ) .
to test whether over - expression of ospub15 enhances plant resistance to blast disease , we inoculated the ospub15ox plants and the control plants with seven m. oryzae isolates , zhong - 10 - 8 - 14 , zb13 , zb15 , ch706 , 99 - 26 - 1 , 99 - 26 - 2 and 97 - 27 - 2 , respectively .
we found that , compared to the control transgenic plants , the ospub15ox plants confer enhanced resistance to all of the tested blast isolates ( figure 6f ) .
taken together , these findings suggest that overexpression of ospub15 constitutively activates the basal defense responses against diverse isolates of m. oryzae in rice .
discussion rice blast , caused by the most devastating rice pathogen , is a severe threat to global rice production [ 43 ] .
more than 20 rice blast resistance genes have been cloned in the past years .
however , only a few rice blast resistance genes , such as pita , pb1 and pit , have been well studied with the immediate downstream components identified [ 51 - 53 ] .
in this study , we characterized the rice u - box / arm repeat protein ospub15 , an interacting component of rice blast resistance protein pid2 .
we found that the kinase domain of pid2 was able to interact directly with and transphosphorylate ospub15 .
we also found that the phosphorylation by pid2k was required for ospub15 to function as an active e3 ligase under our experimental conditions .
moreover , the fact that the ospub15ox plants exhibited spontaneous cell death phenotype and conferred enhanced basal defense suggest that ospub15 regulates plant pcd and innate immunity .
ospub15 is a key factor involved in plant cell death and defense responses plant u - box / arm repeat proteins have been studied extensively in connection with plant defense responses and cell death .
spl11 was the first characterized pub e3 ligase involved in cell death and defense in rice .
the spl11 mutant developed spontaneous cell death in leaves and conferred enhanced resistance to multiple fungal and bacterial pathogens , suggesting that spl11 might serve as a negative regulator of plant pcd and pathogenic defense [ 42,54 ] .
as the closest arabidopsis ortholog of rice spl11 , the atpub13 was also found to be involved in the regulation of cell death and plant defense [ 36 ] .
the u - box e3 ligases cmpg1 and acre276 were characterized as positive regulators of hypersensitive response in tobacco [ 40,41 ] .
in addition , the arabidopsis pub17 - knockout mutants conferred compromised resistance to avirulent pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato [ 40 ] .
on the contrary , the arabidopsis triple mutant pub22 / pub23 / pub24 was reported to display enhanced resistance to diverse pathogens , accompanied with oxidative burst and plant cell death [ 39 ] .
moreover , it is reported that the homozygous pub44 / pub44 mutant exhibited a seedling lethal phenotype resulting from widespread cell death lesions [ 38 ] .
we investigated the biological function of ospub15 using transgenic approach .
the plants over - expressing ospub15 exhibited cell death phenotype and conferred enhanced resistance to many m. oryzae isolates ( figure 6b , f ) .
interestingly , the excessive accumulation of ros was observed in the lesion leaves of the ospub15ox plants ( figure 6d ) .
it is likely that the high level of ros in transgenic plants induces the abnormal phenotype and increases the resistance to pathogens , as rapid generation of ros is a well - known process involved in plant pcd and innate immunity [ 55 - 57 ] .
however , we failed to obtain transgenic rice lines with significantly decreased expression of ospub15 by trying to introduce two ospub15 - rnai constructs ( targeting different parts of the ospub15 mrna ) individually into pid2 rice calli or tp309 calli , respectively .
it is likely that the potential regenerated plant or positive rice calli with drastically reduced expression of ospub15 ( attribute to the strong driving effect of the rice actin promoter for ospub15 - rnai ) could not survive .
this explanation is also supported by the findings that the homozygous t - dna insertion mutant of ospub15 in the rice variety dongjin exhibits a seedling lethal phenotype [ 32 ] .
interestingly , the ros accumulation and its impact on plant cell death were also found in the ospub15 - knockout mutants [ 32 ] .
collectively , these results indicate that both up - and down - regulated expression of ospub15 is able to induce accumulation of ros and ultimately leading rice plants to death at seedling stage .
thus , we believe that the steady - state expression of ospub15 is essential for plant survival and normal development .
additionally , ospub15 is also involved in the responses against abiotic stresses as the expression of ospub15 was up - regulated upon salt or drought stresses ( additional file 1 : figure s5 ) .
taken together , our study reveals that ospub15 works as a key regulator for various ros - related signaling pathways , including plant innate immunity , pcd and abiotic stresses .
ospub15 is a substrate of the receptor - like kinase pid2 the rice u - box / arm repeat protein ospub15 was previously isolated as one of the pid2k - interacting proteins through a yeast two - hybrid screening strategy [ 45 ]. by using the gst pull - down and bifc approaches , we confirmed the interaction between ospub15 and pid2k in vitro and in vivo ( figure 2b , d ) .
furthermore , we found that the arm repeat domain of ospub15 is essential for such interaction ( figure 2b , d ) , which is well consistent with the defined protein - protein interaction function of this domain [ 23,24 ] .
the previous study has shown that pid2 is a transmembrane receptor - like kinase ( rlk ) containing a putative intracellular serine / threonine kinase domain [ 44 ] .
many rlks with such cytosolic kinase domains , such as xa21 [ 58 ] , osserk2 [ 59 ] , bri1 [ 60 ] , bak1 [ 61 ] , efr [ 62 ] and fls2 [ 63 ] , have been reported to possess kinase activity .
similarly , our present work reveals that pid2k is an active kinase ( figure 3 ) .
moreover , we also found that pid2k is able to transphosphorylate ospub15 in vitro ( figure 3 ) .
the results that pid2k interacts directly with and transphosphorylates ospub15 support the notion that ospub15 is a substrate of pid2 .
e3 ligase activity of ospub15 relies on its phosphorylation as is known , whether the e3 ligase activity of a protein could be successfully detected in vitro relies on the specific e2 enzyme ( s ) used for the ubiquitination assay .
for example , the polyubiquitination of the e3 ligase ospub73 could be detected in the presence of the arabidopsis e2 enzyme atubc8 or atubc9 rather than atubc7 [ 23 ] .
moreover , the u - box / ring proteins h - goliath and avrptob were able to exhibit strong ubiquitination activity when respectively incubated with the human e2 ubch5c whereas they failed to display detectable ubiquitination activity when incubated with ubch5b [ 64,65 ] .
in addition , park et al. found that out of the four e2s used ( atubc5 , atubc8 , atubc10 and ubch5c ) , only ubch5c ( also named hubc5c ) is effective in testing the e3 ligase activity of ospub15 [ 32 ] .
unfortunately , ubch5c is not available for the ospub15 ubiquitination assay in our study .
it seems that such e2 preference in ubiquitination assay may explain why we failed to detect the e3 ligase activity of bacterially expressed ospub15 even though a total of 11 e2s were used .
interestingly , after pre - incubating the bacterially expressed ospub15 with total protein extracts of rice or pre - phosphorylated by pid2k ( figure 4 ) , we successfully detected the e3 ligase activity of ospub15 .
our results suggest that the e3 ligase activity of ospub15 depends on its phosphorylation under our experimental conditions .
in addition , we believe that the pre - incubation strategy used in this study would be adaptable to other prokaryotically expressed plant proteins for their in - vitro ubiquitination assays , especially when the most suitable e2s are not available or the post - translational modification is required .
the mechanism for ospub15 to regulate plant cell death and defense responses in this study , we extensively characterized the interaction between pid2k and ospub15 ( figure 2 ) .
we also found that pid2k is able to form homo - dimers in rice protoplast cells ( additional file 1 : figure s6 ) .
however , unlike pid2k , which lacks of the transmembrane and extra - cellular domain , the full - length pid2 ( fl - pid2 ) is not able to form homo - dimers or interact with either ospub15 or ospub15c ( additional file 1 : figure s7 ) .
this indicates that the binding ability of pid2k with its partners is abolished in the native status of fl - pid2 .
we deduced that the binding sites of the native protein fl - pid2 in its kinase domain might not be well exposed and binding with a specific ligand ( for example , the elicitors from blast pathogens ) would be required for its conformational change enabling pid2 to homodimerize and / or to interact with its substrate ( s ) , such as ospub15 .
many previous studies have revealed that homo - dimerization is required for some rlks to be auto - phosphorylated in order to activate their full kinase activity , and in turn , the downstream signaling pathways in animals and plants [ 66 - 71 ] .
according to this notion , we deduced that the homodimerization and autophosphorylation of pid2 might be required for the activation of pid2 - mediated immune signaling .
collectively , we propose a model to summarize these results ( figure 7 ) .
in the absence of a corresponding ligand , the immune receptor pid2 is in a stable inactive state .
the perception of the ligand by its extracellular b - lectin domain activates pid2 and promotes its homodimerization and autophosphorylation , as well as the recruitment and phosphorylation of cytosolic ospub15 .
after that , the phosphorylated ospub15 release e3 ligase activity to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of its substrate ( s ) , which might be - involved in regulating rice immune responses .
unfortunately , we could not provide genetic evidences to support this model as we failed to obtain the pid2 plants silenced for ospub15 .
in future study , it will be interesting to determine the biological functions of ospub15 in pid2 - mediated immunity using alternative genetic approaches .
figure 7 a proposed model for ospub15 to regulate pid2 - mediated signaling .
the unknown ligand from pathogen is likely able to activate the immune receptor pid2 by changing its conformation , which leads directly to the homodimerization and autophosphorylation of pid2 .
such phosphorylated form of pid2 then recruits and transphosphorylates ospub15 .
the phosphorylated ospub15 serves as an active e3 ligase to mediate the degradation of unknown substrate ( s ) , which is / are likely involved in pid2 - mediated immune responses .
previous studies indicated that pid2 belonged to the non - rd subclass of rlks [ 45,72 ] , which is characterized by carrying an uncharged residue ( such as cysteine , glycine , phenylalanine or leucine ) in place of the conserved arginine ( r ) located just before the catalytic aspartate ( d ) residue with known roles in regulation of innate immunity in both animals and plants [ 73 ] .
besides pid2 , the well - characterized immune receptors , xa21 and fls2 , also belong to non - rd kinases [ 73 - 75 ] .
interestingly , both xa21 and fls2 also interact directly with their respective plant e3 ligases to regulate plant defense responses [ 76,77 ] .
thus , we suggest that the signal pathway mediated by interactions between non - rd kinases and e3 ligases responsible for regulating innate immunity might broadly exist in plant kingdoms .
more interestingly , the transgenic plants over - expressing ospub15 but lacking of functional pid2 constitutively exhibit enhanced disease resistance to blast pathogens , accompanied with typical immune responses , such as rapid production of ros and up - regulated expression of pr genes ( figure 6 ) .
these findings suggest that ospub15 also regulates plant basal defense responses in a pid2 - independent manner .
together with its involvement in plant cell death , salt and drought stresses , our study reveals that ospub15 functions in many biological processes in rice , including plant growth , biotic and abiotic stresses .
conclusions in this study , we confirmed that ospub15 , a u - box / arm repeat e3 ligase , was a binding partner of rice blast resistance protein pid2 .
in addition , we found that the kinase domain of pid2 was an active kinase capable of phosphorylating ospub15 and ospub15 was a substrate of pid2 .
we also found that rice plants over - expressing ospub15 displayed spontaneous cell death , excessive accumulation of ros , increased expression of pathogenesis - related genes and enhanced resistance to different blast strains .
taken together , our study demonstrates that ospub15 interacts with pid2 and plays significant roles in plant cell death and defense responses .

the nucleotide sequence of pid2k was amplified from pid2 - cdna [ 44 ] using primers # 1 and # 2 , and the pcr product was cloned into the shuttle vector pegh in frame with gst to generate gst - pid2k construct .
ospub15 ( primers # 3 and # 4 ) , ospub15n ( primers # 3 and # 5 ) and ospub15c ( primers # 6 and # 4 ) fragments were separately amplified from fl ( full length ) - cdna of ospub15 and cloned into pet - 30a ( novagen ) in frame with 6 x his tag to generate his - ospub15 , his - ospub15n and his - ospub15c constructs , respectively .
afterwards , these constructs were transformed into host strains , respectively .
gst - pid2k was induced to largely express ( 2 % d - galactose , 14h , 30degreesc ) in yeast strain y258 and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione sepharose 4b ( ge healthcare ) .
the his - tagged proteins were individually induced to express ( 0.1 mm isopropyl beta - d - thiogalactosiadse , overnight , 28degreesc ) in e. coli strain transetta ( de3 ) ( transgen biotech , china ) and purified with magnehis ( tm ) ni - particles ( promega ) .
the eluted his - tagged proteins were incubated with purified gst - pid2k or gst alone bound to glutathione beads , respectively .
after 4 h of incubation at 4degreesc , the beads were extensively washed four times with gst binding buffer ( pbs , ph 7.3 ) .

the rice e3 ligase sdir1 [ 78 ] was used as a positive control .
the assays were conducted as described previously [ 79 ] .
after the reactions , the resulting proteins were subjected to protein blot analysis using anti - ub ( produced by the laboratory of prof. qi xie , institute of genetics and developmental biology , chinese academy of sciences ) or anti - ospub15 antibody .
subcellular localization and bifc assays in rice protoplasts rice protoplasts were prepared as described previously [ 80 ] .
the coding sequences of ospub15 ( primers # 3 and # 9 ) and pid2k ( primers # 10 and # 11 ) without the stop codons were amplified and subcloned into the pbi221 - gfp vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus ( camv ) 35s promoter and in frame with the green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) to create 35s : : ospub15 - gfp and 35s : : pid2k - gfp constructs , respectively .
these constructs and the control 35s : : gfp vector were respectively co - transformed into rice protoplasts along with psat6 - mcherry - vird2nls plasmid [ 81 ] by polyethylene glycol - mediated transformation [ 80 ] .
after incubation at 28degreesc in the dark for 14 h , the florescence signals were monitored with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( lsm 510 meta ; zeiss , goettingen , germany ) .
the bifc vectors were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center ( http :// abrc.osu.edu /) .

generation of ospub15ox transgenic plants the coding region of ospub15 was amplified using primers # 3 and # 20 and cloned into the binary vector ptck303 [ 83 ] to create the ospub15 overexpression construct driven by maize ubiquitin promoter .
the construct was then introduced into embryogenic calli derived from tp309 seeds by agrobacterium - mediated transformation method [ 84 ] .
as a control , the empty ptck303 vector was introduced into tp309 with similar procedures .
fungal treatments seven m. oryzae isolates , zhong - 10 - 8 - 14 , zb13 , zb15 , ch706 , 99 - 26 - 1 , 99 - 26 - 2 and 97 - 27 - 2 , were used in this study .
the fungal spores of the m. oryzae isolates were harvested by washing with 0.25 % gelatin solution and diluted into the suspension at a concentration of 2 x 105 spores / ml. to determine the transcript expression of ospub15 in rice plants post inoculated with the m. oryzae isolate zb15 , such spore suspension were sprayed on four - leaf stage rice seedlings of digu and tp309 , respectively .
on the other hand , to assess the response of ospub15ox seedlings to seven blast strains , 2 mul spore suspension were dropped onto the leaves of the two - week - old regenerated ospub15ox rice plants and the control plants grown on half - strength ms medium .
subsequently , the treated seedlings were put into a chamber kept at 28degreesc and 100 % relative humidity in the darkness for 24 h and then transferred to a greenhouse with 16 h / 8 h ( day / night ) photoperiod at 25 - 28degreesc in conditions of relatively high humidity as well .
for the expression analysis of ospub15 , the treated seedlings were sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 days post inoculation ( dpi ) ; for the disease resistance analysis , the lesions on inoculated leaves of ospub15ox rice plants and the control plants were evaluated at 2 dpi , respectively .

for rt - pcr analysis , the extracted rna was treated with dnasei ( promega ) to eliminate genomic dna contamination and first - strand cdna was synthesized from 2 mug of dna - free rna using reverse transcriptase ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) in a 25 mul reaction volume .
then 0.5 mul of each reverse transcription product was used as template for pcr reactions with gene - specific primers ( primers # 21 - # 32 in additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
the pcr reaction was conducted under the following conditions : 5 min at 94degreesc , 25 cycles ( for the loading control actin1 ) or 30 cycles ( for the other genes ) of 30 s at 94degreesc , 30 s at 60degreesc and 30 s at 72degreesc , followed by a 5 min extension at 72degreesc .

the rice actin1 gene ( primers # 31 and # 32 ) was used as an internal control for normalization of rna samples .
histochemical analysis leaf samples of ospub15ox were collected for histochemical analysis after lesions appeared ( about two weeks after the regenerated plantlets arisen ) .
leaves of the control plants at the same stage were used for comparison analysis .
trypan blue staining , dab ( diamino benzidine ) staining and nbt ( nitro blue tetrazolium ) staining are indicative of cell death , h2o2 and o2 - accumulation , respectively .
these staining analyses were performed following the protocols described previously [ 86 ] .
abiotic stress treatments two - week - old tp309 rice seedlings grown in dishes were treated with 20 % peg ( for drought stress ) or 200mm nacl solution ( for salt stress ) .
the shoot of seedlings collected at time - points 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 24 h after treatment were used for rna extracting for ospub15 expression analysis .

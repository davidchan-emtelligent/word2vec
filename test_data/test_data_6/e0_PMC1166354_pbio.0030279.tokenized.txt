functional analysis of human hematopoietic stem cell gene expression using zebrafish each day , the bone marrow of an adult makes upwards of 200 billion new red blood cells , along with lesser numbers of white blood cells and platelets .
this process , called hematopoiesis , depends on hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) , which divide to make both more stem cells and progenitor cells that differentiate into all the cell types of the blood .
the genetic controls on this process are poorly understood .
in this issue , catherine verfaillie and colleagues show how a two - stage analysis , generation of transcript microarrays followed by functional validation in zebrafish , can identify key regulators of the hematopoietic process .
the study of human hematopoiesis has been hampered in part because it 's not possible to use surface markers to identify and isolate hscs , a technique used to purify other cell types .
the authors used a strategy they had previously developed to isolate hscs from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood that produces a yield up to 10 - fold greater than standard protocols for purifying human hsc .
gene expression in this hsc - enriched cell population was then compared with that in an hsc - depleted population using transcript microarrays (" rna chips ") to identify those genes whose expression was most different between the two groups of cells .
they identified 277 genes whose expression in both marrow and cord blood significantly different between the hsc - enriched and - depleted populations .
using a zebrafish microarray , researchers discovered which human genes are active during hematopoiesis , the formation of blood cells of these 277 genes , verfaillie and colleagues identified 61 whose functions were not already known and which had close matches in the zebrafish , a small fish in which hematopoiesis follows essentially the same path as in humans .
to prevent expression of these 61genes , they designed complementary antisense molecules against them , and injected them into zebrafish embryos .
in 14 of the 61 genes , knocking down expression led to observable defects in hematopoiesis .
the authors note that three of these 14 genes are involved in signaling of fibroblast growth factor , a powerful regulator of development , suggesting that fibroblast growth factor may play a central role in hematopoiesis .
more generally , they believe that the combination of using gene transcript microarrays to identify candidates and producing antisense molecules in zebrafish for functional screening of these candidates offers a way to quickly identify genes with central roles in vertebrate development .

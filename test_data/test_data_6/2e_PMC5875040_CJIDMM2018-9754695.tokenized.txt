information on mosquito - borne filarioid helminths in austria is scarce , but recent discoveries of dirofilaria repens indicate autochthonous distribution of this parasite in eastern austria .
in the current xenomonitoring study , more than 48,000 mosquitoes were collected in eastern austria between 2013 and 2015 , using different sampling techniques and storage conditions , and were analysed in pools with molecular tools for the presence of filarioid helminth dna .
overall , dna of d. repens , setaria tundra , and two unknown filarioid helminths were documented in twenty mosquito pools within the mitochondrial cox1 gene ( barcode region ) .
these results indicate that s. tundra , with roe deer as definite hosts , is common in eastern austria , with most occurrences in floodplain mosquitoes ( e.g. , aedes vexans ) .
moreover , dna of d. repens was found in an anopheles plumbeus mosquito close to the slovakian border , indicating that d. repens is endemic in low prevalence in eastern austria .
this study shows that xenomonitoring is an adequate tool to analyse the presence of filarioid helminths , but results are influenced by mosquito sampling techniques , storage conditions , and molecular protocols .

introduction in europe , filarioid helminths of veterinary and / or medical relevance have mainly been documented in mediterranean regions , but increasingly these pathogens are being reported in temperate climate zones in central and northern europe as well [ 1 - 3 ] .
the most important filarioid helminths in europe are dirofilaria immitis and d. repens , causing canine pulmonary ( d. immitis ) , subcutaneous ( d. repens ) , and ocular ( mainly d. repens ) dirofilariosis [ 4 ] .
both , d. immitis and d. repens , are zoonotic parasites [ 4 ] .
the first central european discoveries of d. immitis were confirmed in switzerland , in 1995 and 1998 [ 5 , 6 ] .
since then , both parasites , d. immitis and d. repens , have been described in humans ( accidental hosts ) , dogs ( definite hosts ) , and mosquitoes ( vectors ) in many central european countries .
both filarioid species have now been shown to be present in all countries neighbouring austria except for liechtenstein , namely , switzerland , italy , slovenia , hungary , slovakia , the czech republic ( d. repens only ) , and germany [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 - 11 ]. d. repens was documented in most central european countries prior to d. immitis .
mosquito - borne filarioid helminths of the genus setaria mainly parasitize in the abdominal cavities of artiodactyls , hyracoids , and equines .
mosquitoes of the genus aedes are thought to be the main vectors of these parasites ( e.g. , ae. vexans for s. labiatopapillosa ) [ 12 , 13 ] .
setaria tundra is a parasite of roe deer documented in several european countries such as austria , switzerland , germany , france , italy , hungary , poland , spain , and denmark ( summarized in enemark et al. [ 14 ]) .
in northern europe , s. tundra can also be found in domestic reindeer , wild forest reindeer , and moose [ 15 ] .
this species is associated with climate changes and causes severe outbreaks of periodontitis in semidomestic reindeer in finland [ 16 ] .
the aim of this study was to xenomonitor eastern austrian mosquitoes for the presence of dna of filarioid helminths - - with the main focus on dirofilaria repens and d. immitis but also on setaria tundra and other mosquito - borne filarioid helminths .
2. materials and methods the present study combines the analysis for filarioid helminth dna in mosquitoes sampled in two independent mosquito monitoring programs using two different storage conditions ( dry and - 80degreesc ) conducted between 2013 and 2015 .
2.1 .
mosquito sampling method 1 in 2013 and 2014 , adult female mosquitoes were trapped at three locations in vienna using new standard miniature light traps ( john w. hook company , gainesville , florida ) baited with co2 .
collection was carried out on a daily basis for 24 hours from march to october .
mosquitoes were killed using the insecticide dichlorvos as soon as they entered the trap .
once a week , the traps were emptied , and culicidae were dried and stored at room temperature until further processing [ 17 ] .
2.2 .
mosquito sampling method 2 mosquitoes were monitored across three provinces of eastern austria ( burgenland , lower austria , and vienna ) at 35 permanent and 23 nonpermanent trapping sites .
at permanent sampling sites , mosquitoes were monitored on a regular basis every second week for a 24 - hour time period from april to october 2014 - 2015 using biogents sentinel traps ( regensburg , germany ) equipped with carbon dioxide as attractant .
nonpermanent sampling sites were investigated at least once and up to six times during the summer months using biogents sentinel traps ( regensburg , germany ) or exhausters .
all mosquitoes were stored at - 80degreesc until further processing [ 18 ] .
mosquitoes were identified morphologically using the identification key of becker et al .
[ 19 ] and pooled by species , collection site , and date , with a maximum number of 50 individuals per pool .
to each pool , 400 microl of dna / rna lysis buffer ( zymo research corp. , usa ) and two ceramic beads ( precellys ceramic beads , peqlab biotechnologie gmbh ) were added , and the samples were homogenized in a tissuelyser ii ( qiagen , germany ) .
approximately 350 microl of the homogenized pulp was loaded onto a qiashredder ( qiagen , germany ) .
the filled qiashredders were centrifuged for two minutes at 13,000 rpm to filter the samples ( solid components remained on the column ) .
in the next step , dna was extracted using a zr - duet ( tm ) dna / rna miniprep kit ( zymo research corp. , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
dna extracted from female mosquito pools was examined for the presence of genomic material of filarioid helminths using primers and pcr conditions published elsewhere [ 20 ] .
the primers used target a 724 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i gene and are specific for various filarioid helminths ( e.g. , dirofilaria , wuchereria , brugia , onchocerca , setaria , and acanthocheilonema ) .
pcr products were separated by electrophoresis in 2 % agarose gels stained with midori green advance dna stain ( nippon genetics europe , germany ) .
finally , purified pcr products were sequenced by a commercial company ( lgc genomics gmbh , germany ) .
sequences thus obtained were compared for similarity to sequences available in genbank ( r ) database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / blast ) .
3. results and discussion 45,848 mosquitoes representing 25 mosquito species were analysed for the presence of filarioid dna in this xenomonitoring survey ( table 1 ) , resulting in the identification of dna from d. repens , s. tundra , and two unknown filarioid helminths in 20 of the mosquito pools ( table 2 ; figure 1 ) .
dna of d. repens was only found in 2015 in a single anopheles plumbeus mosquito in marchegg ( lower austria ) close to the slovakian border .
although several mosquito species of different genera are proven as potential vectors of d. repens [ 21 ] , dna of this parasite has so far only been detected in other anopheles species ( an. algeriensis and an. maculipennis complex ) in austria [ 2 ] .
to date , all d. repens positive mosquitoes have been collected in close proximity to the slovakian ( this study ) and the hungarian borders [ 2 ] .
in both slovakia and hungary , d. repens is known to be endemic with a prevalence above 10 % in dogs in the bratislava area , close to the austrian border [ 22 , 23 ] .
previous metadata analysis has shown that most reported but also potential autochthonous findings in dogs were in eastern austria [ 10 ] .
furthermore , duscher et al .
[ 24 ] described the examination of d. repens positive dogs in the same districts where positive mosquitoes were documented ( ganserndorf and neusiedl am see ) .
this indicates that d. repens might be endemic with low prevalence in this area .
simon et al .
[ 4 ] postulated that two preconditions are required for a successful establishment of d. repens and d. immitis in a novel area : ( i ) the presence of competent mosquito vectors , which is the case in austria , and ( ii ) a certain number of positive dogs shedding microfilaria .
the second precondition seems to limit the distribution of d. repens ( but also d. immitis ) because there are almost no stray dogs , and kennel holding is not common in austria .
dirofilaria immitis was not identified in the present large - scale survey , confirming previous results that this parasite has not yet established itself in eastern austria [ 10 ] .
this pathogen has however been confirmed in dogs [ 22 , 23 , 25 ] and in mosquitoes [ 26 , 27 ] in slovakia and hungary in the vicinity of our study area .
the most commonly found filarioid helminth within the present study area in eastern austria was s. tundra , with most occurrences of s. tundra dna in mosquitoes of the genus aedes , especially ae. vexans .
similarly , prevalences of up to 12.3 % have been reported in roe deer in central europe ( e.g. , northern bavaria [ 28 ]) .
this parasite has also been recorded in ae. vexans in studies in germany and hungary [ 1 , 27 , 29 , 30 ] , suggesting that s. tundra is a common parasite of roe deer in eastern austria .
the discovery of dna of unknown filarioid helminths in ornithophilic culex mosquitoes ( cx. modestus and cx. pipiens complex ) is not surprising because several avian filarioid helminths ( with low pathogenicity for bird hosts ) are present in central europe [ 29 ] .
4. conclusions this xenomonitoring survey confirms the presence of dna of certain filarioid helminths in mosquitoes in eastern austria and indicates possible vector competence of select mosquito species .
however , comparison of the two sampling techniques and storage schemes used here suggests that storage of dried mosquitoes at room temperature increases the number of false negative pools because of a decrease of dna quality , a circumstance that has also been noticed during analyses of mosquito dna itself [ 31 ] .
moreover , different techniques for mosquito sampling ( certain mosquito species are attracted by certain traps ) and the use of different pcr protocols also influence the outcome of xenomonitoring studies [ 32 ] .
nevertheless , xenomonitoring is an effective tool to examine if certain pathogens are present in an area ( e.g. , [ 27 ]) .
it can be concluded that d. repens , s. tundra , and unknown filarioid helminths ( most probably avian parasites ) are present in eastern austria .
further studies are needed to monitor in more detail the situation of d. repens and d. immitis in austria and neighbouring countries .

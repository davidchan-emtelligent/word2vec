introduction as libraries continue to evolve in the services that they provide , librarians may be increasingly responsible for managing large projects , planning programs and outreach , and coordinating teams .
while some projects can be easily executed by a single person , others may involve a team and several moving parts .
in the latter case , a project leader may be responsible for developing a project plan , establishing a timeline , recruiting team members , assigning tasks , managing progress , and apprising sponsors and upper management of the project 's progress .
managing projects and teams can sometimes seem overwhelming .
fortunately , there are several free project management solutions to assist project leaders in managing their workflow .
one of those solutions is trello , a cloud - based tool that uses the kanban method of project management .
under the kanban method , all project - related activities are displayed in a single landscape that is viewable to all members of the project team. with trello , users can visually organize projects into boards , divide projects into groups , and subdivide groups into tasks .
trello 's user - friendly interface makes it ideal for a wide variety of users , from individuals managing personal projects such as home renovations to organizations managing multiple large projects and teams .
to meet users' needs , trello offers various levels of service at different price points .
this review focuses on the free version .
major features trello requires only an internet connection , eliminating the need for users to install software or enter product keys .
registered users can create an unlimited number of boards and designate one board per project .
users can then assign multiple task groups ( lists ) to each board and assign subgroups ( cards ) to each list .
users can create cards by either adding them manually or copying and pasting existing text lists from microsoft word or excel. with the latter method , users have the option to create a card for every line of text or create a single card with multiple lines of text .
cards can be further granulized with to - do lists , which appear only when cards are expanded .
users can also upload attachments and add comments to expanded cards .
once users have created lists , they can easily recreate that list and reorder multiple lists .
for example , my library recently organized a seven - part seminar series comprising seven topics and identical task lists for each topic .
to facilitate the organization of this board , we created one list and designated four cards , and then copied the list and its cards six times , changing only the list name each time .
once we assigned dates to each seminar , we reordered the lists sequentially using the platform 's drag - and - drop feature ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 sample trello lists and cards users can easily coordinate teams and assign cards to team members ( board members ) by sending invitation emails directly from the project board .
once a board member has been assigned a card , the card will reflect the designation , and the board member 's initials will appear on the card .
board members do not need a trello account to view boards , but those who create an account will benefit from greater functionality and will receive alerts pertaining to their cards .
users who work consistently with the same group of people can create teams and eliminate the need to add board members individually .
to facilitate the timely completion of tasks , users assign due dates to cards .
once users have assigned due dates , they and their board members can integrate the board into gmail or outlook using the power - ups feature .
to integrate trello boards into outlook , users should follow these steps : open outlook ( client or web version ) - - > click the calendar tab - - > select " open calendar " - - > select " from internet " - - > enter the personal icalendar feed uniform resource locator ( url ) that is generated by trello .
instructions for integrating with gmail can be found in trello 's faqs .
in both gmail and outlook , trello calendars will appear as new calendars , which can be turned on or off as desired .
trello tasks will not appear in default user calendars .
because trello is a visual tool , it allows users to classify cards by assigning color - coded labels that can be further customized with words to designate statuses such as " complete " or " on hold. " for users with color blindness , trello offers patterned rather than solid - colored labels , which can be customized with status words as well .
these color - coded labels offer the most efficient way of marking tasks as complete .
finally , trello offers two additional standard power - ups : voting and card aging .
the voting feature allows users to " like " a particular card , and the card aging feature alerts users when cards have been inactive for a period of time .
as weeks pass ( one , two , and four weeks ) , cards become increasingly transparent .
shortcomings the most substantial shortcoming is that there is no straightforward way to designate tasks as complete .
currently , users may mark tasks as complete by applying a color - coded label ; therefore , users would have to know that green , for example , indicates " complete. " furthermore , to prevent a card from showing as overdue , users must delete the due date and , if desired , assign an appropriate label .
while this process works fine for small projects , it would become cumbersome with larger projects .
pricing trello has three main pricing options : free , business class , and enterprise .
trello also has a semi - hidden gold level that users unlock once they invite new team members to join the free version .
the basic version of trello is simply referred to as " free. " the basic version allows users to create unlimited boards and integrate with dropbox , google drive , and box .
it contains 3 basic power - ups ( calendar integration , voting , and card aging ) , and allows users to attach files up to 10 megabytes ( mb ) in size .
trello gold is : $ 5 per month per person or free when users invite new members to join. with gold , users can add custom backgrounds and stickers and upload files up to 250 mb in size .
users access trello gold from a circuitous interface ; this level is not available via the traditional pricing information page .
business class : business class provides team overviews and offers integration with a number of apps , including , but not limited to , google hangouts , github , slack , and mailchimp .
users may attach files up to 250 mb in size .
enterprise : enterprise is intended for large organizations managing multiple projects and teams .
enterprise users enjoy the same features as those with business class with extra layers of security .
overall value for a free product , trello is an excellent project management tool that can assist users with completing projects on time .
trello allows users to communicate with board members through using the commenting feature and by assigning members to cards .
the ability to assign due dates and integrate those due dates into a personal calendar is especially useful .
furthermore , through the use of labels and due date notifications , trello allows users to get a visual snapshot of project progress .
i recommend trello to individuals managing small to medium - sized projects and teams at the personal and professional level .

high expression of ring finger protein 7 ( rnf7 ) in cancer cells is known to play a key role in tumor progression .
however , the role of rnf7 in prostate cancer progression is not well elucidated .
in this study , we silenced rnf7 by shrna interference in two castration resistant prostate cancer ( crpc ) cell lines , du145 and pc3 .
rnf7 knockdown attenuated proliferation and enhanced sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to cisplatin treatment .
invasive property of du145 and pc3 cells was also attenuated by rnf7 silencing .
the underlying mechanisms appear to be associated with accumulation of tumor suppressive proteins p21 , p27 and noxa , while inactivation of erk1 / 2 by rnf7 knockdown .
we demonstrated that rnf7 knockdown induced growth suppression of prostate cancer cells and inactivated erk1 / 2 pathway , which suggested rnf7 might be a potential novel therapeutic target for crpc .
worldwide , an estimated 1.1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer ( pc ) every year1 .
prostate cancer progression is amenable to repression at an early stage by androgen deprivation therapy ( adt ) .
however , most patients with pc will eventually become castration resistant , which leads to its relapse .
this feature makes prostate cancer the second cause of cancer death in men according to international agency for research on cancer234 .
hence , identification of molecules that are functionally associated with tumor initiation , progression , invasion and metastasis is a key research imperative in cancer therapeutics .
rnf7 , also referred to as sag ( sensitive to apoptosis gene ) , roc2 ( regulator of cullins 2 ) or rbx2 ( ring - box 2 ) , consists of 113 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 12.6 kda .
rnf7 was originally identified as a redox - inducible anti - oxidant protein5 .
it is a highly conserved protein and is extensively expressed in human skeletal muscles , heart and testis5 .
as a redox - inducible anti - oxidant protein , production of rnf7 can be induced by redox agents , which can protect cells from apoptosis caused by oxidation5 .
rnf7 is also a component of e3 ubiquitin ligases .
when combining with other components to assemble e3 ubiquitin ligases , rnf7 has e3 ubiquitin ligase activity6 .
although rnf7 is inducible by the transcription factor of activator protein - 1 ( ap - 1 ) , rnf7 inhibits tumor - promoting functionality of ap - 1 by ubiquitinylation and degradation of c - jun7 .
rnf7 has been shown to mediate ubiquitinylation of various cellular proteins such as , p218 , p27910 , pro - caspase - 311 , ikappabalpha1213 , hif - 1alpha14 , noxa15 and nf116 .
it is reported that rnf7 is over - expressed in many human cancers , such as carcinomas of lung , colon , stomach and liver15 .
silencing of sag expression by rna interference was shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells ( lung cancer cell line h1299 , glioblastoma cell line u87 , pancreatic carcinoma cell line panc - 1 ) in vitro and reverse radiation - resistance15 .
the mechanisms underlying this effect may include inactivation of nf - kappab and mtor pathway8 and / or accumulation of tumor suppressive proteins , such as nf1 , deptor , procaspase - 3 , p21 , p27 , noxa , and bim1517 .
as a component of e3 ubiquitin ligase , rnf7 may interact with massive cellular proteins .
further investigations are needed to reveal the novel functional aspects of rnf7 and their underlying mechanisms .
the role of rnf7 in prostate cancer , especially in castration resistant prostate cancer ( crpc ) , is not yet clear .
in this study , we found that knockdown of rnf7 in two crpc cell lines , du145 and pc3 , enhanced the sensitivity of these cells to cisplatin treatment .
the underlying mechanisms were likely associated with increased cell apoptosis and inhibited erk1 / 2 activity .
results rnf7 was efficiently silenced by rna interference du145 and pc3 cell lines were transfected with shrnf7 retroviruse ( shrnf7 - 1 or shrnf7 - 2 ) or with negative control retrovirus ( shcon ) .
protein and mrna levels of rnf7 were determined by western blot and qrt - pcr , respectively .
rnf7 expression was significantly decreased after interference with shrnf7 - 1 or shrnf7 - 2 in both du145 and pc3 cells ( fig. 1a ) .
to measure knockdown efficiency of rnf7 , rnf7 mrna expression level was determined by qrt - pcr .
rnf7 transcription was statistically inhibited by shrnf7 - 1 or shrnf7 - 2 interference , p < 0.001 ( fig. 1b ) .
rnf7 mrna level in du145 cells silenced by shrnf7 - 1 or shrnf7 - 2 compared to shcon - negative control was 26.2 % +/ - 4.7 % and 12.1 % +/ - 6.4 % , respectively .
while the rnf7 mrna level in pc3 cells silenced by shrnf7 - 1 or shrnf7 - 2 compared to shcon negative control was 24.9 % +/ - 5.3 % and 11.2 % +/ - 2.4 % , respectively .
the silencing efficiency of shrnf7 - 2 was significantly greater than that of shrnf7 - 1 , both in du145 and pc3 cells , p < 0.001 ( fig. 1b ) .
these data were consistent with reduced rnf7 protein expression detected by western blot assay .
our results demonstrated that both shrnf7 - 1 and shrnf7 - 2 efficiently decreased rnf7 production .
rnf7 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell growth rapid cell division is one of the properties of cancer cells .
to determine the effect of rnf7 knockdown on prostate cancer cell proliferation , we seeded 1 x 105 cells in 12 well plates and cultured them for 7 days .
cell numbers were recorded every day .
cell proliferation in the shrnf7 - 2 interfered group was significantly attenuated than that in the control ( shcon ) group from the third day onwards ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 2a and b ) .
on the 7th day , the number of du145 cells decreased to 78.4 % by rnf7 interference ( fig. 2a ) , and 69.6 % of pc3 cells ( fig. 2b ) .
the results indicated significant attenuation of du145 and pc3 cell proliferation after rnf7 knockdown .
rnf7 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells to investigate the underling mechanism of growth suppression caused by rnf7 knockdown , cell cycle distribution of shrnf7 and shcon cells were measured by pi staining on flow cytometer .
the mean percentage of negative control cells in g2 phase , in which rnf7 were normally expressed , were about 25.9 % and 21.3 % ( fig. 3a and b ) , respectively .
however , mean percentage of g2 phase in rnf7 silenced du145 and pc3 cells were about 41.2 % and 38.7 % ( fig. 3a and b ) , respectively .
these results showed that rnf7 knockdown induced significantly g2 phase arrest in both du145 and pc3 cells , p < 0.001 .
rnf7 knockdown accelerated prostate cancer cell apoptosis and cell death upon administration of chemotherapy to investigate whether rnf7 knockdown had synergetic effect with chemotherapy on prostate cancer treatment , du145 and pc3 cells transfected with shrnf7 - 2 or shcon were treated with cisplatin .
apoptosis cells were positively stained with annexin v or double positively stained with annexin v and pi , while dead cells were only pi positive ( fig. 4a ) .
in du145 cells , cisplatin combined with shrnf7 - 2 interference induced significantly higher apoptosis or necrosis indicated by annexin v and / or pi staining positive ( 25.7 %) as compared to that induced by cisplatin alone ( 15.3 %) ( p < 0.0001 ) ( fig. 4b ) .
also , cisplatin induced significantly higher cell apoptosis or necrosis ( 26.3 %) in shrnf7 - 2 silenced pc3 cells compared to shcon control group ( 19.4 %) , p < 0.0001 ( fig. 4b ) .
so , rnf7 silencing enhanced the sensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines to cisplatin .
rnf7 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion cell invasion plays a critical role in cancer relapse and causes death .
the role of rnf7 in du145 and pc3 cell invasion were analyzed by invasion assay .
our results showed that the invasive ability reduced significantly after rnf7 silencing in du145 ( fig. 5a ) and pc3 ( fig. 5b ) cells , p < 0.0001 .
rnf7 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell colonization and tumorigenesis colony formation indicates the ability of tumorigenesis .
clonogenic survival assay was performed to detect the role of rnf7 in prostate cancer cell colony .
as inspected , du145 ( fig. 6a left panel ) and pc3 ( fig. 6b left panel ) cells exhibited higher colony forming ability .
however , this ability was significantly compromised by rnf7 interference , p < 0.0001 ( fig. 6a and b , middle and right panels ) .
the size and weight of tumors developed from du145 ( fig. 6c ) or pc3 ( fig. 6d ) cells in nude mice were significantly decreased by rnf7 silencing , p < 0.0001 .
these data demonstrated that rnf7 knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis in prostate cancer cells .
rnf7 knockdown induced accumulation of p21 , p27 and noxa , and inhibition of erk1 / 2 activity in both du145 and pc3 cells , the expression of pro - apoptosis protein noxa and tumor suppressor proteins p21 and p27 was highly up - regulated by rnf7 silencing ( fig. 7a ) .
erk plays a critical role in tumor cell survival and proliferation. and phosphorylation indicates activation of erk .
to investigate the effects of rnf7 knockdown on erk activation , prostate cancer cells were activated by epidermal growth factor ( egf ) for 5 to 60 minutes and erk phosphorylation was detected by western blot .
our study showed that it was the activity not the expression of erk that was inhibited by rnf7 knockdown in du145 and pc3 cells ( fig. 7b ) .
these data demonstrated that rnf7 knockdown up - regulated expression of pro - apoptosis and / or tumor suppressor proteins , while inhibited the activity of erk pathway .
to verify that proliferation suppression was associated with accumulation of p21 , p27 , and noxa in rnf7 silenced prostate cancer cell , p21 , p27 , or noxa was silenced by sirna in rnf7 knockdown du145 and pc3 cells .
four days after sirna interference , cell proliferation was measured by mtt assay .
our results showed that cell proliferation increased significantly by silencing of p21 , p27 , or noxa in both rnf7 knockdown du145 ( fig. 8a ) and pc3 cells ( fig. 8b ) .
these results showed that the suppressive effect of rnf7 knockdown on cell growth was likely attributable to accumulation of p21 , p27 and noxa .
in conclusion , our study demonstrated that rnf7 knockdown could suppress proliferation and inhibit tumor formation of prostate cancer cells .
the underlying mechanisms were associated with accumulation of tumor suppressive proteins p21 , p27 and noxa , and inactivation of erk1 / 2 pathway .
discussion prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death in males worldwide .
while most prostate cancer patients respond to adt initially , a vast proportion of them will eventually relapse due to castration resistance234 .
hence , development of treatment regimens that reverse castration resistance is a key priority in crpc research .
chemotherapy is one of the main therapeutic modalities for crpc .
it was reported that docetaxel could prolong survival time 2 to 3 months18 .
other chemotherapeutic agents used for improving treatment efficacy either singly or in combination with docetaxel include , cisplatin1920 , estramustine21 , 153sm - lexidronam22 , prednisolone23 , mitoxantrone2425 , epirubicin26 , bortezomib27 , zoledronic acid28 , capecitabine29 , and vinorelbine30 .
other regimens were used or studied in clinical trials include , combination of estramustine phosphate , ifosfamide and cisplatin20 ; prednisone plus cabazitaxel and prednisone plus mitoxantrone25 ; epirubicin and cisplatin31 ; and cisplatin plus prednisone32 .
although these regimens enhanced the 50 % survival time up to 15 - 20 months , more efforts are needed for improving the treatment efficacies .
it was reported that cisplatin induced reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in prostate cancer cells. and the production of ros in hormone - sensitive lncap cells was significantly higher than that of crpc du145 and pc3 cells33 .
increasing the ros production in crpc cells may improve efficiency of chemotherapy especially cisplatin treatment .
rnf7 is highly expressed in various human cancers , such as lung , liver and stomach cancers15 .
also we found high expression level of rnf7 in prostate du145 and pc3 cells .
rnf7 was proved to be an antioxidant by yi sun and his colleagues5 .
then we hypothesized that silencing of rnf7 might have a synergistic effect with cisplatin chemotherapy .
so we sought to investigate the effect of rnf7 knockdown on sensitivity of du145 and pc3 cells to cisplatin treatment .
retrovirus based shrna were used to silence rnf7 expression .
the knockdown efficiency was comparable to that reported in previous studies78 .
rnf7 knockdown significantly inhibited du145 and pc3 cell proliferation starting from the third day , which may be associated with rnf7 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest in g2 phase .
consistent with our study , tan et al. recently showed that rnf7 knockdown by lentivirus - based sirna significantly decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation34 .
we also investigated the effect of rnf7 knockdown on crpc cell sensitivity to cisplatin .
rnf7 knockdown combined with cisplatin chemotherapy induced significantly higher percentage of annexin v positively stained apoptosis cells as compared to that observed with cisplatin treatment only .
the underlying mechanism might be associated with increased expression of pro - apoptosis protein noxa in rnf7 silenced cells .
we further investigated the effect of rnf7 silencing on cancer cell invasion .
rnf7 knockdown significantly inhibited invasive properties of du145 and pc3 cells .
consistent with our study , tan et al. also showed that rnf7 knockdown significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell migration and clone formation in vitro34 .
based on the above results , we hypothesized that rnf7 silencing might counteract crpc tumorigenesis .
our study showed that clonogenic forming ability of du145 and pc3 in vitro , and its tumor formation ability in nude mice were significantly decreased by rnf7 interference .
these results were consistent with increased expression of tumor suppressor proteins p21 and p27 .
similar findings have been reported from a previous study on lung cancer cells8 .
we also sought to figure out the potential signal transduction pathway involved in rnf7 knockdown mediated cell growth inhibition .
while tan et al. showed that rnf7 knockdown decreased akt activation34 , we observed inactivation of erk1 / 2 activity by rnf7 silencing .
multiple signaling pathways might be involved in the inhibition of cell growth and tumorigenesis mediated by rnf7 knockdown .
to address further whether erk1 / 2 inactivation is associated with inhibition of ras activity , we detected ras activity of shrnf7 and shcon cells , and we did not observe ras inactivation caused by rnf7 interference ( data not shown ) , indicating erk1 / 2 inactivation by rnf7 knockdown might not due to ras inactivation by potential nf1 accumulation .
more investigations are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to demonstrate that erk1 / 2 activation is regulated by rnf7 in cancer cells .
in conclusion , our study demonstrated that rnf7 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis , suggesting that rnf7 might be a promising target for crpc treatment .
the underlying mechanisms might be associated with accumulation of tumor suppressive proteins p21 , p27 and noxa , and inactivation of erk1 / 2 activity .

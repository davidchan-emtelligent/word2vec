we propose a single - cell - level biochemical fingerprinting approach named " ramanome " , which is the collection of single - cell raman spectra ( scrs ) from a number of cells randomly selected from an isogenic population at a given time and condition , to rapidly and quantitatively detect and characterize stress responses of cellular population .
scrs of escherichia coli cells are sensitive to both exposure time ( eight time points ) and dosage ( six doses ) of ethanol , with detection time as early as 5 min and discrimination rate of either factor over 80 % .
moreover , the ramanomes upon six chemical compounds from three categories , including antibiotics of ampicillin and kanamycin , alcohols of ethanol and n - butanol and heavy metals of cu2 + and cr6 + , were analyzed and 31 marker raman bands were revealed which distinguish stress - responses via cytotoxicity mechanism and variation of inter - cellular heterogeneity .
furthermore , specificity , reproducibility and mechanistic basis of ramanome were validated by tracking stress - induced dynamics of metabolites and by contrasting between cells with and without genes that convey stress resistance .
thus ramanome enables rapid prediction and mechanism - based screening of cytotoxicity and stress - response programs at single - cell resolution .
detection and characterization of stress - response in a cellular population or consortium have found numerous applications in life science and biotechnology industry1 .
analysis of such response at the single - cell level is often advantageous or even essential , due to the ability to reduce cultivation time , to tackle yet - to - culture microbes and to distinguish genetically identical cells that exhibit biologically meaningful phenotypic difference2 ( which can be crucial for adaptation to a fluctuating environment3 ) .
a variety of such single - cell bio - sensing techniques , which detect and profile molecular information within individual cells , have been proposed45 .
a traditional approach is based on fluorescence labeling .
for example , e. coli whole - cell biosensors , which carry a fluorescent protein - encoding reporter gene fused to a promoter inducible by particular stress , can be highly sensitive and specific , however the requirement for stress - specific promoters and transformability of cells limits their wider application .
moreover , as typically only one or a few molecules are labelled at a time , a comprehensive , mechanism - based view of cellular response is usually not possible .
on the other hand , omics - based methods that profile molecules ( e.g. mrna6 and metabolites2 ) in individual cells can provide a landscape - like view of stress response , however the disruptive nature of such methods usually precludes rapid detection and sensing .
moreover , their application can be limited by the inability to amplify single - cell proteome and metabolome , potential bias associated with nucleic - acid amplification and typically high demand for consumable costs and technical skills .
therefore , a label - free , non - disruptive , simple yet sensitive method that rapidly yields a comprehensive , landscape - like profile of stress response program at single - cell resolution is of great value .
a single - cell raman spectrum ( scrs ) is a phenotypic profile of a single cell and can be obtained by raman microspectroscopy ( which directly detects vibrations of chemical bonds through the inelastic scattering by a laser light7 ) from an individual live cell in a label - free , non - disruptive manner .
a scrs sums up molecular vibrational signals in a single cell and provides a landscape - like profile of the cell89 .
scrs has shown promise in identification of bacterial cells101112 , measurement of metabolite production1314 , and probing metabolic states of cells1516171819 ( see reviews2021 ) .
we demonstrated the ability of scrs to discriminate microalgal cells between nitrogen - replete and nitrogen - depleted conditions at 6 hours upon stress with > 93.3 % accuracy , and among the eight time points ( from 0 hr to 96 hr ) under stress with > 90.4 % accuracy13 .
one recent study showed that the temporal variation of e. coli scrs was correlated with phenotypic response to the stress of 1.2 % v / v n - butanol22 .
a second study suggested scrs of e. coli can distinguish between individual antibiotics upon 30 min stress19 .
these observations usher in the hypothesis of whether scrs in a cellular population can be exploited to detect , distinguish and characterize stress responses in a sensitive , specific and rapid manner .
however , it is not known , ( i ) how scrs is quantitatively influenced by the type , dose and duration of stresses ; ( ii ) whether and to what degree scrs can rapidly and specifically distinguish or reveal stress - response mechanisms among different classes of stressors ; ( iii ) whether such cellular response as captured by scrs is specific to a particular stress .
here , employing e. coli as a model , we first showed that a " ramanome " , defined as the collection of scrs from a number of cells randomly selected from an isogenic population at a given time and condition , is sensitive to both exposure time and dosage of ethanol , with detection time as early as 5 min ( under 5 % v / v eth ) and classification rate of either factor > 80 % .
moreover , ramanomes upon six chemical stressors from three categories , i.e. , antibiotics of ampicillin ( amp ) and kanamycin ( kan ) , alcohols of ethanol ( eth ) and n - butanol ( n - but ) and heavy metals of cu2 + ( cuso4 ) and cr6 + ( k2cro4 ) , were compared .
a subset of 31 marker raman bands representing a wide spectrum of chemical classes were revealed , which distinguished the cell responses via cytotoxicity mechanism .
furthermore , specificity , reproducibility and mechanistic basis of the method were validated by tracking stress - induced ramanomes between cells with and without genes that convey resistance to a particular antibiotic stress .
the results suggested scrs - based stress - response profiling can be label - free , rapid , quantitative , specific and mechanism - based , thus this approach is valuable to the screening of cytotoxicity , stress - response or stressors among individual prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells .
results and discussion as each of the 1581 raman bands in a scrs represents a particular type of molecular bonds in the cell , a scrs can be considered as a digital image of thousands of pixels that carry the signature of the metabolome state of a cell .
comparison of the matching pixels between or among different time points or conditions thus can reveal features of the stress response program ( fig. 1 ) .
one " ramanome " , i.e. , the collection of scrs from multiple cells ( e.g. , 20 ) that were randomly sampled from the population at a given time and condition , was generated from each biological replicate of cell population ( fig. 1 ; figure s - 1b ; methods ) .
to test whether and how the state of cellular response conveyed via ramanome is influenced by the type , duration and concentration of stressors , ramanomes under various duration or doses of eth were first generated , and then time - series ramanomes were compared among six singular chemical stressors ( figure s - 1b ) .
dose and duration sensitivity of ramanomes to ethanol dose - dependent ramanome variation stress - dose response of e. coli cells as measured by ramanome was profiled under the six eth concentrations of 0 % ( control ) , 0.5 % , 1 % , 2 % , 3 % and 5 % ( v / v ) after 30 min stress - exposure .
standard deviation of the mean ( sdm ) 1213 among biological replicates ranged from 0.12 +/ - 0.007 to 0.16 +/ - 0.005 , supporting high reproductively of the ramanome measurement .
significant distinction was detected between each of the five stressed ramanomes and the control ( p = 0.001 for each ; anosim ) .
for example , in discriminating between 0.5 % ( v / v ) eth and control , > 95 % accuracy was reached at 30 min , although the two growth curves were not significantly different even after 8 hr ( figure s - 3a ) .
moreover , distance between the stressed and the control ( as measured by r - value ) is highly correlated with the dose ( anosim ; pearson coefficients r2 = 0.94 ; table s - 1 ) , suggesting the ability of ramanome to model dosage response .
in fact , the ramanome discriminated the five eth doses from 0.5 % to 5 % with ~ 85 % accuracy on average at 30 min , which is much more sensitive than od600 , as the latter failed to discriminate between 0.5 % and 1 % within 8 hr ; table s - 1 ; figure s - 3a ) .
to identify dose - sensitive features , the stressed ramanomes were compared to the control via the fingerprint region of 640 ~ 1800 cm - 1 ( figure s - 2a ) .
the results revealed high correlation of pc - lda factor1 with dose ( r2 = 0.88 ) , supporting dose as main driver of ramanome variation ( figure s - 2b ) .
dose - sensitive changes of scrs were detected in 18 bands ( revealed via pc - lda factor1 between eth - treated and eth - free cells ) : e.g. , intensity of nucleic - acid bands ( 1574 , 1481 , 811 , 782 , 728 cm - 1 , etc ) was reduced dramatically with increasing eth dose , while most protein ( 1002 , 1242 , 1308 cm - 1 , etc ) and lipid ( 1661 , 1448 , 1127 cm - 1 , etc ) bands exhibit an increase trend ( within 30 min ) .
these eth - dose - sensitive bands can serve as individual markers in place of the whole fingerprint region ( consisting of more than 1000 bands ) for modeling dosage response .
duration - dependent variation of ramanome to test its sensitivity to stress duration , ramanome was measured after cells were stressed with 5 % ( v / v ) eth for 0 min , 5 min , 10 min , 20 min , 30 min , 1 hr , 3 hr , 5 hr , 8 hr and 20 hr , respectively .
sdm among biological replicates ranged from 0.13 +/ - 0.003 to 0.17 +/ - 0.006 , supporting technical reproducibility ( table s - 2 ) .
significant distinction was detected between a stressed ramanome and its corresponding control at each of the time points that started with 5 min ( p = 0.001 for each ; anosim ) , suggesting rapid response of ramanome to stress .
moreover , distance between the stressed and the control followed a linear relationship with duration within the first 1 hr of eth stress ( r2 = 0.91 ; anosim ; table s - 2 ) .
furthermore , ramanome is able to distinguish among each of the time points ( and its associated condition ) from 5 min to 20 hr , with 90 % specificity and 90 % sensitivity ( random forest ; table s - 2 ) , supporting the value of ramanome in modeling the duration of stress .
interestingly , ramanome reaches ~ 94 % sensitivity in distinguishing eth - stressed cells at 5 min of exposure , as compared to 20 min using growth curve ( tracked via od600 ; table s - 2 ; figure s - 3b ) .
this underscores the potential of ramanome in applications where rapid detection of stress response is required .
duration - sensitive raman bands that serve as individual markers for predicting the temporal / stressed stage of a cell were identified via random forest , which consist of seven major nucleic - acid - , protein - , lipid - associated bands ( derived from the first 50 raman bands as ranked by significance ) .
at either condition , intensity of such nucleic - acid bands ( 1575 , 1481 , 812 , 783 cm - 1 , etc ) exhibit gradual reduction temporally , while such protein ( 1002 cm - 1 , etc ) and lipid ( 1658 , 1448 cm - 1 , etc ) bands exhibit gradual increase .
moreover , at each of the time points , intensity of the nucleic - acid bands in eth - stressed cells was always lower than the control , yet the lipid bands were consistently higher ( fig. 2a ) .
these observations collectively indicated that eth altered the pace but not the program of physiological development .
validation of eth - induced phenotypic changes as captured by ramanome to test whether the ramanomes provided mechanistic insights of stress response , density of intracellular nucleic acids and lipids were temporally profiled via conventional approach , in which metabolites were first extracted from culture - aliquots and then quantified ( methods ; supporting information ) .
to test the degree of correlation between the conventional and the ramanome - based approaches , a plsr model1323 was generated between averaged density of lipid / dna in individual cells ( conventional ) and scrs ( ramaome - based ) , using the first two biological replicates from each approach as training data and the third as testing data .
the correlation coefficients ( r2 ) was 0.95 ( 0.97 for calibration dataset and 0.92 for validation dataset ) for single - cell lipid density and 0.89 ( 0.96 for calibration dataset and 0.80 for validation dataset ) for single - cell dna density ( fig. 2b ; table s - 3 ) .
these results underscored the ability of ramanome to provide insights into stress - response mechanisms .
variation of ramanome among different types and categories of chemical stressors analysis of ramanomes by anosim and random forest to probe whether ramanome can distinguish different stress - response programs , five additional chemicals from three categories were profiled for temporal dynamics ( i.e. , at seven time points within the first 5 hr of stress exposure , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 , 180 , and 300 min ) , including a second alcohol of n - but , two antibiotics of amp and kan , and two heavy metals of cu2 + and cr6 + .
doses of the chemicals were each set at a level that causes > 50 % inhibition of growth within an 8 hr culture ( figure s - 4a ; table s - 4 ) 24 .
sdm among biological replicates of ramanome ranges from 0.113 +/ - 0.009 to 0.168 +/ - 0.004 ( the pearson correlation is > 0.98 ) , suggesting high reproducibility of measurement ( table s - 4 ) .
significant distinction was detected between the stressed cells and their corresponding control cells at each duration time for each stressor ( figure s - 5 ; p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , temporal patterns of ramanome between stressed and control cells were highly diversified among the stressors ( as represented by r - value ; anosim ; fig. 3a ) .
the temporal pattern is relatively inert and stable for certain stressors ( e.g. amp ) , yet can be quite dynamic for others , exhibiting dramatic up - down ( e.g. , eth and n - but ) , down - up ( e.g. , cu2 +) or more complex patterns ( e.g. , kan and cr6 + ; fig. 3b ) .
in fact , ramanome is able to reliably classify these stressors , as evidenced by 100 % accuracy in classification ( random forest ) and the low pearson correlation r values among the stressors ( fig. 3c ) .
link and distinction among the six stress - response programs as unveiled by ramanome dynamics to identify specific features that underlie the characteristic ramanome variation of each stressor , those raman bands in the fingerprint region that exhibit significant variation between the stress and control conditions were first identified for each of the six stressors ( methods ) .
they were then grouped into two clusters , c1 and c2 , based on temporal variation patterns as compared to their corresponding controls for each stressor ( k - means clustering with the largest silhouette coefficient or se ; methods ) .
in each cluster , the largest functional category annotated ( accounting for 25 ~ 60 %) is protein - related raman bands2526 .
( i ) under eth , 194 such bands were clustered into c1 ( 114 bands ) and c2 ( 80 bands ) ( fig. 4 ; se = 0.41 ) .
in c1 , ~ 50 % raman bands were assigned to nucleic acids , which underwent a gradual decrease after the onset of eth .
the significant decreased intensity of nucleic - acid bands under eth was likely due to the " dilution " effect , as cell was greatly enlarged upon stress ( 1 ~ 6 fold longer and slightly wider ; figure s - 4b ) , while there was no evidence for increased dna / rna degradation under eth24272829 .
cluster c2 featured increased intensities of lipid and carbohydrate bands , which was supported by enrichment of membrane - related biomass , such as membrane lipids and polysaccharides upon eth stress2930 .
under n - but ( 314 such bands , with 144 in c1 and 170 in c2 ; fig. 4 ; se = 0.26 ) , for both clusters , composition and temporal features of bands were mostly similar to those under eth .
transcriptomic and metabolic basis of cellular response under n - but stress were identical to those under eth , especially in increase of carbohydrates24 and lipids31 .
however , eth appears to induce a more dramatic change of ramanome ( i.e. , greater change in intensity of matching raman bands ) .
moreover , lipid - related bands in c2 under n - but exhibit a temporal pattern distinct from those under eth : at 30 min , lipids accumulated under eth , yet without detectable change under n - but ( figure s - 6 ) .
this led to distinct patterns of ramanome variation between the two alcohols ( p < 0.001 ; wilcoxon rank sum test ) .
( ii ) under amp ( 143 such bands , with 55 in c1 and 88 in c2 ; fig. 4 , se = 0.22 ) , in c1 , ~ 50 % of the bands were assigned to proteins , whose intensities underwent an increase within 20 min of stress exposure ( might result from the up - regulated amino - acids metabolism transcripts32 ) , followed by a decrease afterwards until 1 hr ( supported by the inhibition of certain protein metabolism transcripts under amp , such as those of outer membrane protein biosynthesis33 ) .
in c2 , bands assigned to carbohydrates were enriched as compared to c1 ; these bands underwent a decrease within 10 min and an increase to 1 hr , consistent with the induced expression of colanic acid ( capsular exopolysaccharide of e. coli ) biosynthetic pathway genes after 30 min of amp exposure33 , which helps cells cope with stress .
under kan ( 253 such bands , with 108 in c1 and 145 in c2 ; fig. 4 , se = 0.25 ) , nucleic - acid bands in c1 (~ 45 % proportion ) underwent an increase , which might be due to growth arrest rather than to direct response to kan - stress .
extended duration of kan - stress might result in retardation or pause of cell growth or reproduction ( due to the inhibition of dna - repair function by kan34 ) , resulting in temporal stability of nucleic acid level , which was in contrast to its temporal reduction in control cells .
c2 featured a larger proportion of protein bands and the presence of carbohydrate bands .
kan functioned as an inhibitor of 30s ribosome and induced degradation of mistranslated proteins , and the resulted up - regulation of protease transcripts35 might explain the intensity decrease of proteins bands in c2 .
on the other hand , the relative signal reduction of carbohydrate bands in c2 ( as compared to control ) during kan stress might be explained by the down - regulation of transcripts in cell wall biogenesis32 .
( iii ) under cu2 + ( 155 such bands , with 85 in c1 and 70 in c2 ; fig. 4 , se = 0.31 ) , in c1 , nucleic acid and lipid bands were the second and third largest functional categories , showing an initial ( within 1 hr ) decrease followed by an increase after 3 hr of stress .
the intensity reduction of nucleic - acid bands might be due to the slightly diluted density of cellular metabolites within 1 hr of stress caused by the enlarged cell size under cu2 + ( figure s - 4b ) , as well as due to dna degradation3637 , while the increase after 3 hr of stress might indicate growth arrest ( or cell death ) .
for lipid - related bands , decrease in intensity of 1445 cm - 1 ( total lipids ) and 1128 cm - 1 ( saturated lipids ) was apparent during the first 1 hr of cu2 + stress , suggesting high cellular sensitivity during this initial phase , as proportion of unsaturated fatty acids was found positively correlated with cu2 + sensitivity36 ( fig. 4 ; table s - 5 ) .
however , the increased intensity of lipid bands after 5 hr stress duration might indicate loss of cell viability under cu2 + , which was consistent with the temporal pattern of nucleic - acid bands .
cluster c2 , which is enriched in protein bands , experienced an increase within 30 min stress and then a decrease after 3 hr duration , which might be explained by the stimulation of genes encoding periplasmic proteins upon 5 min of cu2 + - stress38 .
under cr6 + ( 155 such bands , with 94 in c1 and 61 in c2 ; fig. 4 , se = 0.23 ) , c1 exhibit a larger proportion of lipid and carbohydrate bands , as compared to c2 ; these bands underwent an increase trend , which was supported by up - regulation of transcripts in carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms under cr6 + stress ( e.g. , in yeast39 , pseudomonas putida4040 and caulobacter crescentus42 ) .
c2 primarily featured decrease of protein bands under cr6 + , which was supported by the strongly inhibited expression of amino acid metabolism genes in p. putida41. between these two heavy metals , although the temporal patterns of ramanome are significantly different ( p < 0.001 ; wilcoxon rank sum test ) , those for the protein - and carbohydrate - related bands were mostly similar .
this can be explained by the shared features of cu2 + - and cr6 + - responses such as enrichment of ribosome biogenesis and assembly genes ( protein synthesis ) and upregulation of common - metal - responsive genes in ( carbohydrate metabolism ) 39 .
a raman barcode distinguishes six stressors via mechanism of stress - response raman barcode of cellular - response to stress ( rbcs ) by pooling those marker raman bands that are both specific and shared among the six stress - response programs ( methods ) , we proposed rbcs , which consists of 31 elementary raman bands that collectively characterize the temporal pattern of ramanome ( table s - 5 ) .
among them , six bands , representing nucleic acids ( 666 , 811 , and 1575 cm - 1 ) , proteins ( 853 , 1302 cm - 1 ) and lipids ( 957 cm - 1 ) respectively , were found among the marker bands for all the six stressors , thus they correspond to a general cellular response. between alcohols and heavy metals , the 13 shared bands included nine nucleic - acid bands ( 620 , 720 , 782 , 823 , 1092 and 1481 cm - 1 , in addition to the three all - shared nucleic acid bands above ) , thus changes of nucleic - acid appeared to be particularly responsive to alcohol and heavy metal stress. between antibiotics and heavy metals , only seven bands were shared ( including one protein band of 1620 cm - 1 , in addition to the six all - shared bands ) , indicating highly distinct mechanism of response .
within the same stress category of alcohol , 18 of the 31 bands were shared between eth and n - but , with most assigned to nucleic - acids and lipids ( table s - 5 ) .
fewer than a half of the bands ( mostly lipids and protein related ) were shared between amp and kan , suggesting a more different action mode .
in contrast , 26 of the 31 bands ( mostly protein assigned ) were shared between cu2 + and cr6 + , indicating a largely shared response mechanism to heavy metals .
clustering analysis of the rbcss allowed mechanism - based classification of the six stress - response programs ( fig. 5 ) .
the clustering pattern of rbcss was mostly consistent with that of the categories of alcohol , antibiotics and metals , except that the rbcss of amp and kan were not clustered together ( fig. 5 ) .
these two antibiotics , with amp from the beta - lactam family and kan from the aminoglycoside family , exert their anti - bacteria activity as cell - wall synthesis inhibitors and ribosome inhibitors respectively34 .
kan stress inhibited protein synthesis and resulted in retardation or pause of cell growth , which was consistent with the decreased intensity of protein - related bands such as 853 and 1002 cm - 1 and the increased intensity of nucleic - acid bands such as 782 , 811 , 1481 and 1575 cm - 1 ( as compared to control cells ; fig. 5 ) .
however , amp mostly inhibits the synthesis of cell wall or cell membrane ( consistent with the variation of lipid bands such as the up - regulated 1660 cm - 1 and the down - regulated 957 , 1302 and 1445 cm - 1 ; fig. 5 ) .
thus clustering of rbcs is based on the stress - response mechanism , and not via the conventional classification scheme of chemicals .
ramanome - based detection of cellular heterogeneity change under stress in addition to stress - response phenotypes at the population level , ramanome provides temporal information for the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity among individual cells in a stress - response process .
the relative standard deviation ( rsd ) of each of the raman bands within a ramanome can be used to quantify the inter - cellular heterogeneity .
for example , along the duration of stress - response , inter - cellular heterogeneity of the three member bands of rbcs , 1445 ( alkyl c - h2 bend , lipid ) , 1002 ( benzene ring breathing , such as phenylalanine ) and 782 cm - 1 ( cytosine , uracil , ring str , such as dna / rna ) remained stable under alcohol - stressed , heavy - metal - stressed and control cells .
however , the 782 cm - 1 band underwent a remarkable increase upon 5 hr of antibiotics stress , particularly under kan stress ( p < 0.05 , kruskal - wallis test ; fig. 6 ) .
on the other hand , raman bands with different assignments can exhibit distinct heterogeneity patterns in response to environmental perturbation .
for example , heterogeneity of the nucleic acid band 782 cm - 1 underwent a sharp elevation specifically at 5 hr under kan stress , likely due to the increased heterogeneity in growth stage among the cells as caused by kan treatment .
specificity of the link between stress response and ramanome to test the specificity of links between stress response and ramanome , the stress response programs as captured by ramanome were compared between wild - type e. coli dh5alpha ( i.e. , kans , stress - sensitive cells with blank plasmid ) and its engineered strain into which resistance to a particular chemical stressor was introduced ( i.e. , kanr , stress - resistant cells that harbor a kan - resistant plasmid ) .
as expected , wt + kan exhibit a profoundly distinct rbcs from wt + h2o and from wt + eth ( figure s - 7a ) .
moreover , rbcs of kans + kan clustered with that of wt + kan , indicating that introduction of a control plasmid left the kan - sensitive response program largely intact ( figure s - 7a ) .
interestingly , the rbcs of kanr + kan is highly distinct from kans + kan , and actually clustered with wt + h2o , suggesting introduction of kan - resistant plasmid to host cells converted the stress - response program from a highly kan - sensitive one to a resistant one .
rbcs of kanr + h2o was more identical to kanr + kan than to wt + h2o ( figure s - 7a ) .
thus the observed variation between kanr + kan and wt + h2o is due to presence of the plasmid , which highlights the sensitivity and specificity of ramanome to stressors .
the stress - dependent variation of inter - cellular phenotypic heterogeneity observed also supported the specificity of links between stress response and ramanome .
the heterogeneity under kans + kan is identical to wt + kan ( p > 0.05 ) yet distinct from wt + h2o ( p < 0.05 ) , supporting a change of inter - cellular heterogeneity as induced by kan .
interestingly , the heterogeneity under kanr + kan ( e.g. rsd of 782 cm - 1 ; figure s - 7b ) is highly distinct from kans + kan ( p < 0.05 ) , while is identical to that under wt + h2o ( p > 0.05 ) , suggesting introduction of kan - resistant plasmid converted the heterogeneity pattern from a highly kan - sensitive one to a resistant one .
thus the variation of heterogeneity under kan stress , such as that for nucleic acids ( i.e. , 782 cm - 1 ) , was also highly specific and reproducible .
conclusions here we proposed the ramanome approach for the detection of stress - induced temporal variation from a cell population using single - cell raman spectra ( scrs ) .
we showed that ramanome was able to detect , distinguish and characterize both population - level features and inter - cellular variation of stress responses in a sensitive , specific , rapid and quantitative manner .
thus ramanome can serve as a multiplex , phenotypic and high - resolution signature for a particular state of stress response in e. coli .
moreover , rbcs which is a barcode of temporal pattern of 31 raman bands was proposed as a cytotoxicity mechanism based signature for a stress - response program .
compared to other single - cell stress - response profiling methods such as morphological analysis43 , fluorescence imaging based biosensing45 or transcriptomics6 , ramanome can be advantageous .
ramanome , in a label - free , non - disruptive and simple manner , rapidly yields a comprehensive and landscape - like view of molecular events of stress response without the need for preexisting biomarkers .
moreover , ramanome can be used as cell sorting criteria and applied to raman activated cell sorting ( racs ) , such as raman - activated cell ejecting ( race44 ) and raman - activated microfluidic sorting ( rams4546 ) .
subsequent genomics and transcriptomics after racs can establish specific links between dna sequence or gene expression and a ramanome .
for a given cell population , integrated profiling of ramanome , genome , transcriptome and lipidome should allow investigation into the genomic or transcriptomic basis of particular stress - response states or microevolution programs at single - cell resolution .
the sensitivity and dependency of ramanome to stressor , host cell genotype as well as a multitude of environmental variables ( e.g. , nutrient repletion / depletion , dissolved oxygen tension , osmolarity , temperature , ph , etc ) suggested a probably unlimited size and search space for such multivariate single - cell biochemical - fingerprint data .
thus at present , when the scope and depth of available ramanome data are limited while the procedure or parameters of data measurements are not yet standardized , the practical utility of ramanome as a universal signature of stress response remains a question .
for example , at the present stage it is not clear to what degree the change of cell type impacts the choice of raman markers underlying rbcs .
however , this question can be addressed by comparing the time - series ramanome datasets derived from different types of cells that span various phylogenetic distances .
on the other hand , as the ramanome approach can be extended to theoretically any kinds of host cells ( regardless of cultivability ) and any abiotic or biotic stressors , a database of reference ramanome or rbcs for the most common cells and stressors ( e.g. antibacterial agents or drugs ) might be warranted .
it can serve as a valuable community resource that aids rapid annotation or screening of unknown cells , stressors and stress - response programs .
moreover , global analysis of such phenotypic data for the vast combination of cells and stressors might provide new insights into diversity and mechanisms of stress - response programs in nature .
materials and methods strains and growth conditions stress response of e. coli dh5alpha cells to each of the six chemical stressors was assessed with 60 replicates ( 20 cells from each of the three biological replicates of cell culture ) sampled at different states of cell growth .
the cell growth was measured by od600 in a 96 - well plate .
dose of each stressor was set based on that producing > 50 % inhibition of the growth within 8 hours .
single - cell raman spectrometry and chemometrics analyses sample preparation and then scrs acquisition followed a consistent procedure ( figure s - 1a ; supporting information ) .
briefly , cells from each sample were spread onto caf2 slides for 532 nm raman spectra measurement .
all raw raman spectra ( 600 cm - 1 to 1800 cm - 1 ) from a triplicate of samples were baseline - corrected and normalized using labspec 5 , followed by chemometrics analyses such as principal component analysis ( pca ) and principal component and linear discriminant analysis ( pc - lda ) , random forest , and analysis of similarities ( anosim ) .
the raman bands with significant changes under each stress were clustered via temporal patterns using k - means clustering with euclidean distance ( highest silhouette coefficients ; r 3.0.3 ) ( see more details in supporting information ) .
determining cellular dna and lipid density via independent methods total dna was isolated from 1 ml aliquots of cell culture using dneasy blood & tissue kit ( qiagen ) and then quantified by qubit ( r ) 2.0 .
total lipids were measured via biphasic chloroform / methanol / - water extractions26 , followed by drying under n2 flux and weighting in precision electronic balance .
dna / lipid content in individual cells was estimated by dividing the total weight by the number of cells .
plsr model was used to test the correlation between ramanome and the dna / lipid density of individual cells as estimated above .
full description of methodology is provided in supporting information .

the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) is an excellent molecular marker for the studies of evolutionary ecology and conservation genetics because it is a family of highly polymorphic genes that play a key role in vertebrate immune response .
in this study , the functional genes of mhc class ii b ( dab ) were isolated for the first time in a vulnerable species , the chinese egret ( egretta eulophotes ) .
using a full length dna and cdna produced by pcr and race methods , four potential mhc dab loci were characterized in the genome of this egret and all four were expressed in liver and blood .
at least four copies of the mhc gene complex were similar to two copies of the minimal essential mhc complex of chicken , but are less complex than the multiple copies expressed in passerine species .
in mhc polymorphism , 19 alleles of exon 2 were isolated from 48 individuals using pcr .
no stop codons or frameshift mutations were found in any of the coding regions .
the signatures of positive selection detected in potential peptide - binding regions by bayesian analysis , suggesting that all of these genes were functional .
these data will provide the fundamental basis for further studies to elucidate the mechanisms and significance of mhc molecular adaptation in vulnerable chinese egret and other ardeids .

introduction the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) is a multi - gene family , representing an important component in the acquired immune system of the vertebrate species .
traditionally , mhc genes are classified into two major classes , designated class i and class ii. the mhc class ii genes consists of two genes , named a and b , in which the b genes are responsible for the majority of the polymorphism .
mhc is a favored molecular marker for evolutionary ecology and conservation genetics because of their diverse functions and characteristics relevant to evolutionary and adaptive processes [ 1 - 6 ] .
studies on the functional genes of mhc ii b ( dab ) complex in birds have indicated that multiple copies of these genes are highly variable among different species [ 5,7 - 18 ] .
the most complex of the mhc structures were found in passerine birds [ 19 - 21 ] while the " minimal essential " structures were found in a non - passerine bird , the red jungle fowl ( galliformes , phasianidae , gallus gallus ) [ 22,23 ] .
other non - passerine birds , including raptors and seabirds , paleognath birds , and penguins have been reported to have more complex mhc structures than the " minimal essential " genes [ 24 ] .
efficient and reliable genotyping of mhc genes is a difficult task , yet remains a basic prerequisite to understand the mhc complex in these species [ 13,16,25 ] .
target loci are commonly expressed as multiple copies , and allele sequences , even at a single locus , may be very divergent .
this makes for a more challenging problem to identify all alleles carried by an individual and reconstruction of multilocus genotype in an individual .
the presence of both expressed loci and pseudogenes further complicates the problem in identifying functional variants [ 14,20,26 ] .
moreover , the copy number of mhc genes in birds is highly variable .
therefore , the precise genotyping and full understanding of the molecular architecture of the multilocus mhc complex remains an important and challenging problem [ 12,27 ] .
the chinese egret ( ciconiiformes , ardeidae , egretta eulophotes ) is listed as a vulnerable species with an estimated global population of 2600 - 3400 individuals [ 28,29 ] .
this egret is a migratory colonial waterbird , wintering in the south of asia and breeding on offshore islands in russia , north korea , south korea and china .
this breeding pattern may facilitate pathogen transmission and advance mhc polymorphisms [ 24 ] .
several molecular studies have been carried out on this species [ 30 - 32 ] , including reports of mhc and two dna sequences of the dab gene from exon 2 to exon 3 but these studies did not confirm their expression [ 33 ] .
the aims of the present study were to : ( 1 ) isolate the complete mhc dab genes in the chinese egret and determine their architecture ; ( 2 ) confirm the expression of all the loci ; ( 3 ) estimate variability in each locus and test to determine if positive selection was acting on the mhc dab genes ; and ( 4 ) to investigate the usefulness of noncoding sequence variation for the design of locus - specific amplification strategies .
successful completion of these objectives will provide the essential fundamentals for further studies to determine the mechanism and significance of mhc molecular adaptation in vulnerable chinese egret and other ardeids .
materials and methods ethics statement this research and all procedures involving collection of animal tissue in the wild were approved by the administration center for wildlife conservation in fujian province ( fjwca - 1208 ) .
the scientific license for access to the study site was issued by the administration department of xiamen egret natural reserve ( xmenr - 1005 ) .
blood samples (~ 0.5 ml ) were collected from 32 nestlings ( aged around 15 days ) of e . eulophotes by puncturing the wing vein and using a syringe to draw up the blood .
the nestlings were immediately returned to the nest after stanching the blood with cotton .
collection of the blood sample was conducted during the morning , and visits to the breeding colony were restricted to a maximum of two hours per day .
methods for dna extraction , rna extraction and reverse transcription blood samples were collected from 48 nestlings ( aged around 15 days ) of the chinese egret on the riyu islet ( 27degrees01'n , 120degrees25'e ) in fujian province of china as described above , and frozen at - 80degreesc until dna extraction .
total genomic dna was isolated using the universal genomic dna extraction kit ver .
3.0 ( takara ) , and total rna was extracted from the blood and from the liver of one individual chinese egret that died at this islet by trizol ( invitrogen , switzerland ) , respectively .
isolation of mhc dab genes a fragment from exon 1 to exon 3 of the mhc dab gene complex in the chinese egret was first amplified with degenerate primers 34f and rap3r [ 11 ] .
pcr reactions were carried out on a biometra t gradient thermocycler in a final volume of 20 microl containing 1 x pcr buffer ( 50 mm kcl , 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.3 , 1.5 mm mgcl2 ) , 0.2 mm of each dntp , 0.4 microm of each primer , 0.7 u of taq polymerase ( takara ) and 100 ng of genomic dna .
the conditions for pcr amplification were a denaturing step at 94 degreesc for 3 min , followed by 35 cycles at 94 degreesc for 30 s , 55 degreesc for 30 s , 72 degreesc for 2 min , and a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
the 3 ' and 5 ' rapid amplification strategy of cdna ends ( race ) [ 34 ] was used to isolate the entire gene sequence and confirm the gene transcription by using 3 ' - full race core set ver .
2.0 ( takara ) and 5 ' - full race kit ( takara ) .
based on the dna sequence obtained from the fragment , gene specific outer / inner primers were designed in conserved exon 3 regions for 3 ' race ( 23sp1 : acaggctggtttgctacgtgacg 23sp2 : cggcggagat tgaggtgaagtgg ) and 5 ' race ( 25sp1 : ccacctggcacatgtag gtgtcc 25sp2 : tggtttccagcatcaccagcacctg ) respectively , using oligo 6.0 ( molecular biology insights ) .
pcr reactions were carried out following the protocols and applications as described in the kit .
a 580 bp segment and a 650 bp fragment were obtained from the 3 ' race and 5 ' race , respectively .
after removing the overlapping region , a 1060 bp long cdna segment of the mhc dab genes from the 5 ' utr to the 3 ' utr was obtained .
according to the complete cdna sequence , two primers 25utrf : cagaactctgcccggagacgg and 23utrr : ctgcagagcagcgacag cgaa were designed to amplify the complete dna sequence of the mhc dab gene .
pcr reactions were carried out on a biometra t gradient thermocycler in a final volume of 50 microl containing 1x la pcr buffer ii , 2.5 mm mgcl2 , 0.4 mm dntp , 0.5 microm of each primer , and 2 u takara , la taq .
pcr conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95degreesc for 3 min , 35 cycles of denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s , annealing at 62degreesc for 30 s , primer extension at 72degreesc for 3 min , and a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
to verify differences among the four mhc dab loci in the intron 1 and locate the conserved regions to design locus - specific primers , two primers 25utrf1 : agctcatttcgggagggggtc and 23exr : catcaccagcac ctggtaggtcc were used to amplify a fragment from the 5 ' utr to exon 3 for the 32 nestlings randomly selected .
pcr reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 microl containing 1 x pcr buffer ( 50 mm kcl , 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.3 , 1.5 mm mgcl2 ) , 0.2 mm of each dntp , 0.4 microm of each primer , 0.7 u of taq polymerase ( takara ) and 100 ng of genomic dna .
the condition for pcr amplification included a denaturing step at 94 degreesc for 3 min , followed by 35 cycles of 94 degreesc for 30 s , 62 degreesc for 30 s , 72 degreesc for 2 min , and a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
all pcr products were purified using the agarose gel dna purification kit ver .
2.0 ( takara ) , then ligated into pmd 18 - t vector ( takara ) and transformed into escherichia coli dh5alpha .
ten positive colonies of each band were selected to sequence bidirectionally on an automatic sequencer ( abi prism 3730 ; invitrogen biotechnology co. ltd. ) using universal m13 sequencing primers and bigdye version 3 ( applied biosystems ) .
polymorphism of the mhc dab gene complex to detect polymorphism within the mhc dab genes in wild populations of the chinese egret , 48 nestlings on the riyu islet were genotyped by semi - nested pcr combined with single strand conformation polymorphism ( sscp ) .
first , four forward locus - specific primers in intron 1 were designed and designated as dab01f - 04f ( dab01f : gaggtgctg ggtgtgggtgg , dab02f : gaggtgctgggtgtgggaatgg , dab03f : cactaccaggaca cggcttgtgg and dab04f : ctacaattccagtttaa gtgcgactg ) .
these were combined with the reverse primer dab2exr : ccacgt gctcacctctcctatcc to amplify the four loci , respectively .
pcr was carried out in a 20 microl reaction mixture containing 1 microl genomic dna , 0.7 u of taq polymerase ( takara ) , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 200 microm of each dntp and 0.4 microm of each primer , for 25 cycles at 94degreesc for 30 s , 58degreesc for 30 s and 72degreesc for 1min .
second , to obtain suitable length fragments for sscp genotyping and scanning of the variation in exon 2 of each locus , a second round pcr as carried out using the primer dab2exf : ctgcacaaacaggg gttttccag .
dab2exr was used to amplify the entire exon 2 in each locus .
the reaction conditions for the second round pcr were identical with those described for the first round .
the pcr products from first round were diluted 100 - fold and used as the template .
the amplicons were separated by sscp analyses as described by fain [ 35 ] .
five microl of each pcr product were mixed with an equal volume of 95 % formamide , denatured for 5 min at 99degreesc and immediately chilled on ice water for 10 min .
the reaction mixture was loaded on an 8 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel ( page ) ( 37.5:1 ) .
electrophoresis was carried out at 10degreesc for 5 h at 8 w per gel followed by a sensitive silver - staining procedure , as described by budowle [ 36 ] .
samples with equal banding patterns were rearranged and electrophoresed a second time on a nondenaturing page on adjacent lanes to ensure the genotyping , and samples with unique genotypes , were typed using two independent pcr reactions .
all sscp - bands were cut from at least two individuals of each genotype and incubated in 80 microl water for at least 3 h at 37degreesc .
one microl was used as template in a second pcr under the same conditions as described above .
the products were screened in an additional sscp analysis and every allele was directly sequenced in both directions from at least two individuals or two independent pcrs from one individual .
exclusion of pcr errors and definition of alleles for all pcrs , the amplification , cloning or sequencing was carried out twice and only sequences found in both experiments were included in the analysis to avoid the inclusion of pcr artifacts .
since recombination of cloned pcr products can introduce additional artifacts [ 37,38 ] , direct sequencing of uncloned pcr products was used for agreement with the polymorphic sites .
the sequence obtained from sscp was directly sequenced in both directions .
only completely identical sequences found in two independent pcr events were defined as alleles .
these alleles were referred to as " verified " because the same sequence could not arise twice from independent amplification errors .
throughout this study , the word " allele " is used to describe a 270 bp exon 2 sequence derived from sscp genotyping .
data analyses the complete dna and cdna sequences for mhc dab , derived from the chinese egret , were aligned using the dnaman software package ( lynnon biosoft , quebec , canada ) .
exons and introns were distinguished using the genscan program [ 39 ] .
dna fragments obtained from the 32 nestlings were edited in the bioedit sequence alignment editor [ 40 ] .
alignment gaps were treated as missing data in all analyses .
sequence variability statistics were calculated using the mega 4.0 program [ 41 ] .
the proportion of synonymous ( ds ) and non - synonymous ( dn ) substitutions were calculated for both the 24 possible peptide - binding regions ( pbrs ) as defined by brown [ 42 ] , and the remaining non - antigen binding sites ( non - pbrs ) for each of the four loci .
the z - test in the mega 4.0 was used to test for directed selection .
standard errors were obtained with 1,000 bootstrap replicates , including average rates of synonymous ( ds ) and nonsynonymous ( dn ) substitutions per site according to the nei - gojobori method with jukes - cantor correction for multiple substitutions [ 43 ] .
population allele frequencies and tests of deviation from hardy - weinberg equilibrium were calculated using genepop 4.0 [ 44 ] .
the programme codeml in the paml package , version 3.15 [ 45 ] was used to test for the presence of codon sites affected by positive selection and to identify those sites in exon 2 sequences of the chinese egret , and the neutral model m7 and the positive selection model m8 were compared using maximum likelihood ratio tests ( lrt ) .
results characterization of mhc dab gene complex in this study , dna sequences of four different mhc dab genes were isolated from one individual chinese egret , which was highly similar over large stretches but distinguished by the divergent intron 1 .
according to klein [ 46 ] , these four genes were designated as egeu - dab1 , egeu - dab2 , egeu - dab3 and egeu - dab4 ( genbank accession kc282841 - kc282844 ) .
the result of race analyses indicated that each of the four genes comprised a total of 780 bp encoding for 260 amino acid residues sequences in exons .
this encoded for six of the expected exons , including the signal peptide , the beta1 , beta2 , transmembrane proteins and the cytoplasmic domains ( figure 1 ) .

when expression analyses were carried out by rt - pcr in six individuals , a total of nine alleles were obtained after sequencing of the cloned rt - pcr products .
four of these alleles were derived from egeu - dab1 , two from egeu - dab2 , one from egeu - dab3 and two from egeu - dab4 ( genbank accession kc282845 - kc282853 ) .
the cdna sequences contained features expected of functional class ii molecules , and blast searches produced significant hits with known mhc dab protein sequences .
cd - search identified a beta1 domain in exon 2 and an igc1 domain ( beta2 domain ) in exon 3 .
smart confirmed these domains , and identified a signal peptide and a trans - membrane domain .
the manual survey confirmed the conserved intra - domain cysteine salt bridges within beta1 and beta2 domains ( figure 2 ) .
additionally , the successful amplification from liver and blood shows that all four genes were expressed in these tissues .

locus identification and polymorphism using the primers 25utrf1 and 23exr , 32 of 48 nestlings were amplified , and 22 sequences were obtained from independently replicated individuals .
according to the sequence differences in intron 1 , 9 of the 22 sequences were derived from egeu - dab1 , 5 from egeu - dab2 , 3 from egeu - dab3 and the remainder from egeu - dab4 ( genbank accession kc282854 - kc282875 ) .
this grouping was also confirmed by the neighbor joining analysis ( figure 3 ) .
based on the clustering results , four forward locus - specific primers were designed on intron 1 for each locus , respectively .
the sscp results showed one or two alleles per individual on each locus , certifying the locus separation .

a barn owl mhc class ii sequence , tyaldab1 ( accession numbers eu442606 ) , served as the outgroup .
polymorphism in the mhc dab gene complex complete four loci genotypes were obtained for 48 nestlings using a combination of sscp and direct sequencing for each allele .
nineteen alleles in total were obtained from four loci , including 9 from egeu - dab1 , 6 from egeu - dab2 , 1 from egeu - dab3 and 3 from egeu - dab4 ( genbank accession kf314166 - kf314184 ) .
among the four genes , egeu - dab1 had the greatest number of alleles and showed the most variability in nucleotide and amino acid sequences , whereas egeu - dab3 was monomorphic on exon 2 ( table 1 and table s1 ) .

frequency of allele and hardy - weinberg equilibrium our allele frequency results ( table 2 ) showed that alleles of each locus had an uneven distribution .
on each locus there were one or two alleles had higher frequency than others , such as egeu - dab1 * 05 , egeu - dab2 * 02 , egeu - dab2 * 05 and egeu - dab4 * 01 .
the departure from hardy - weinberg equilibrium within each locus was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) .

furthermore , it was tested if positive selection was acting on the exon 2 in the chinese egret .
the lrt statistic comparing m7 and m8 models indicated that m8 fitted the data significantly better than m7 ( p < 0.001 ) .
the estimates from m8 suggested that 17 amino acid sites of the exon 2 were under strong positive selection .
as shown in table 3 , egeu - dab1 had the greatest number of residues with posterior probabilities of positive selection ( p >= 0.95 ) .
the peptide binding regions ( pbr ) were slight different from humans [ 42 ] , but highly consistent with some birds , such as chicken , thin - billed prion and raptor [ 11,16 ] .

discussion using a pcr - based approach , four mhc dab genes in the chinese egret were isolated and characterized .
compared with the results of li 's study [ 33 ] , two loci , egeu - dab2 and egeu - dab3 , were newly discovered in this egret .
these four mhc dab genes were all functional , based on the following findings : ( 1 ) they were expressed in several tissues ; ( 2 ) some sites on pbr were under strong positive selection ; ( 3 ) no frame shift mutations and stop codons were found in any coding region .
these findings are thus in accord with the postulate that mhc organization is relatively simple , and contains rare pseudogenes in the nonpasserine birds [ 11,22,47,48 ] .
the dominantly expressed ' major ' chicken mhc ii beta - chain ( b - lb ) gene showing high sequence variation and high expression levels across tissue types , was previously described [ 22,49 ] .
among the four mhc dab genes in the chinese egret , genetic diversity in egeu - dab1 locus was higher than other three loci , and the number of alleles obtained from this locus by rt - pcr was more than that from the other three loci .
additionally , the dn / ds values ( all site or pbr site ) suggested that egeu - dab1 locus was under positive selection .
therefore , these results suggest that egeu - dab1 may represent a major class ii gene in the chinese egret .
in contrast to the greater sequence variation of egeu - dab1 , egeu - dab3 showed extremely limited variation and was monomorphic in the pbr - site , suggesting this locus may represent a minor dab gene [ 49 ] .
moreover , codeml analyses revealed 17 residues with posterior probabilities of positive selection ( p >= 0.95 ) in mhc dab exon 2 , indicating that positive selection played a part in the adaptive evolution of this egret .
many studies on characterization of the mhc gene complex have , as a major goal , identification of single mhc gene for population genetic studies .
however , it is difficult to identify individual genes because the molecular mechanisms that underlie mhc evolution , including selection and concerted evolution , can obscure the genealogical relationships among alleles [ 50 ] .
segregation analyses using individuals with well - defined pedigrees may aid in clarifying the number of loci and assigning sequences to loci .
however , such pedigree information is not available for wild birds such as the chinese egret .
therefore , using noncoding and conserved regions as an indicator of which sequences representing individual loci , is an acceptable option , as it is less variable and not subject to balancing selection .
efforts to sequence noncoding regions of mhc loci can be rewarded by the ability to characterize individual loci , and can enhance the utility of these genes as molecular markers in evolutionary ecology research .
this experimental strategy also contributes greatly to the study of mhc gene family evolution across the breadth of avian diversity .
in this study , intron 1 was used to show that this intron was more divergent than the other regions of the mhc dab genes , suggesting it may be the best candidate for locus specific primers in single locus typing of mhc class ii in the chinese egret .
the low number of loci in this egret will allow us to completely genotype each locus of the mhc ii b in individual egrets .
moreover , the primers designed for this study are targeting highly conserved regions across class ii genes , and therefore , similar fragments in other ardeid species are likely to be cross - amplified successfully .
supporting information table s1 genotyping data collected from 4 mhc dab loci in the chinese egret .
the null alleles are indicated by dots .

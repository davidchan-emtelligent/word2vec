while obesity is an indicated risk factor for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be inversely associated with the development of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension .
the purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effects of high body mass index and smoking on hypertensive disorders during pregnancy .
this was a case - control study based on national registers , nested within all pregnancies in iceland 1989 - 2004 , resulting in birth at the landspitali university hospital .
cases ( n = 500 ) were matched 1:2 with women without a hypertensive diagnosis who gave birth in the same year .
body mass index ( kg / m2 ) was based on height and weight at 10 - 15 weeks of pregnancy .
we used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals as measures of association , adjusting for potential confounders and tested for additive and multiplicative interactions of body mass index and smoking .
women 's body mass index during early pregnancy was positively associated with each hypertensive outcome .
compared with normal weight women , the multivariable adjusted odds ratio for any hypertensive disorder was 1.8 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.3 - 2.3 ) for overweight women and 3.1 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.2 - 4.3 ) for obese women .
the odds ratio for any hypertensive disorder with obesity was 3.9 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.8 - 8.6 ) among smokers and 3.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.1 - 4.3 ) among non - smokers .
the effect estimates for hypertensive disorders with high body mass index appeared more pronounced among smokers than non - smokers , although the observed difference was not statistically significant .
our findings may help elucidate the complicated interplay of these lifestyle - related factors with the hypertensive disorders during pregnancy .

introduction hypertensive disorders , including chronic hypertension , gestational hypertension , and preeclampsia , occur in approximately 6 - 8 % of all pregnancies [ 1 ] and are a significant source of maternal and fetal morbidity [ 2 ] .
as the prevalence of advanced maternal age [ 3 , 4 ] and obesity [ 5 ] increase among childbearing women in western countries , hypertensive disorders are likely to become increasingly common obstetric conditions .
compared with offspring of normal pregnancies , offspring of preeclamptic pregnancies have a 1.5 - to 2 - fold increased risk of perinatal or infant mortality .
approximately a third of babies born after a preeclamptic pregnancy are growth restricted , and preeclampsia is responsible for 15 % of all preterm births [ 6 ] .
while obesity is a known risk factor for preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders [ 7 , 8 ] , smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be inversely associated with the development of preeclampsia [ 9 , 10 ] .
data are scarce on the potential interaction of these two lifestyle - related factors on these common pregnancy conditions [ 11 ] .
to what extent maternal smoking and body mass index ( bmi ) interact in the development of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension is not well established .
we therefore aimed to examine the association between bmi and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy , accounting for demographic and pregnancy related factors , as well as to assess the combined effect of bmi and smoking on hypertensive disorders among pregnant women .
materials and methods study design we conducted a case - control study nested within all pregnancies in iceland 1989 - 2004 , which resulted in birth at the landspitali university hospital .
the study was based on data from the national medical birth registry and maternity records linked via women 's unique personal identification number .
health care is publicly funded and accessible to everyone in iceland .
prenatal care is offered in a uniform manner at local primary care clinics every two to four weeks of pregnancy ( 10 visits for nulliparous women and 7 visits for others ) , with the first prenatal visit occurring between pregnancy weeks 10 and 15 .
women who need specialized care receive more follow up [ 12 ] .
the landspitali university hospital provides secondary and tertiary services for the whole of iceland .
it covered approximately 2900 births annually , 45000 in total , during the study period [ 13 , 14 ] , mainly including mothers residing in the capital area ( table 1 ) , as well deliveries among mothers in need of specialized medical care .

* cases and controls gave birth in the same calendar year .
all cases and controls are restricted to women without any registered diabetes during pregnancy .
ascertainment of cases and controls as cases we randomly selected a total of 500 women from the electronic national medical birth registry with any registered hypertensive disorder during pregnancy ( international classification of disease , 10th revision [ icd - 10 ] codes , o10 - 16 ) [ 15 ] and no diagnosis of diabetes ( icd - 10 codes , o24 , e08 - 13 ) .
the population was restricted to women without any registered diagnoses of diabetes in light of evolving clinical guidelines and non - uniform screening of gestational diabetes during the study period [ 16 ] .
hypertensive disorders during pregnancy were further categorized as : pre - existing hypertension ( o10 ) , gestational hypertension ( o13 , o16 ) and preeclampsia ( o14 , o15 , o11 ) .
preeclampsia superimposed on pre - existing hypertension ( o11 ) was included with preeclampsia , as only four such cases were identified .
no cases of gestational edema and proteinuria without hypertension ( o12 ) were identified .
according to the diagnostic criteria [ 17 ] , pre - existing hypertension is defined as hypertension that is present and observable before pregnancy or that is diagnosed before the 20th week of pregnancy ; gestational hypertension and preeclampsia occur after pregnancy week 20 .
as controls we randomly selected a total of 1000 women from the medical birth registry , who had no registered diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder or diabetes during pregnancy and gave birth in the same year as each case ( 1 case : 2 controls ) .
when selecting the number of cases and controls we assumed an odds ratio of at least 2.0 for any hypertensive disorder and 80 % power .
measures of body mass index and smoking information on measured weight , height and self - reported smoking behavior during pregnancy was manually retrieved from maternity records .
weight ( kg ) and height ( m ) were measured at the first prenatal visit , which occurred on average at pregnancy week 13.2 ( median , 13.8 weeks ; interquartile range , 12.0 - 15.3 weeks ) in the study population .
body mass index ( bmi ) was defined in accordance with international standards [ 18 ] as kg / m2 and used as a continuous and a categorical variable : underweight ( bmi < 18.5 ) , normal weight ( bmi 18.5 - 24.9 ) , overweight ( bmi 25.0 - 29.9 ) , obese ( bmi >= 30.0 ) .
bmi was available for 1445 ( 96.3 %) of the study population , i.e. 483 ( 96.4 %) of cases and 962 ( 96.3 %) of controls .
smoking behavior was self - reported at first prenatal visit and categorized as : non - smoker , smoker and discontinued smoker ( smoked during early pregnancy but quit ). of the 1445 women with known bmi , 77.8 % ( n = 1124 ) reported no smoking , 17.9 % ( n = 259 ) reported smoking during pregnancy , another 2.8 % ( n = 41 ) discontinued smoking during pregnancy , and 1.5 % ( n = 21 ) had an unknown smoking status .
in the analyses we excluded discontinued smokers because of uncertainty of when exactly smoking had been discontinued .
information on quantity or type of smoking was not available .
covariates additionally , we obtained information on women 's demographic and pregnancy related characteristics from the national medical birth registry , including maternal age at delivery , nationality , residency , working status and cohabitation with other parent , parity , multiple gestation and gestational length .
other registered maternal conditions , such as renal diseases ( icd - 10 codes n00 - n99 , q61 , o27.1 ) , collagen vascular diseases ( icd - 10 codes l93 , l94 ) and endocrine disorders ( icd - 10 codes e00 - e90 ) were assessed but not used as covariates because of too few observations .
data analysis of 1500 unique personal identification numbers extracted , records were incomplete or unavailable for three women and data on bmi missing for another 52 women ; resulting in 1445 women ( 483 cases , 962 controls ) available for the main data analysis .
analyses in which smoking status was included contained a total of 1383 women after exclusion of those with missing values ( n = 21 ) and discontinued smoking ( n = 41 ) .
we first calculated the crude odds , odds ratios ( or ) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) , as measures of association of hypertensive disorders during pregnancies ( any ; pre - existing hypertension , gestational hypertension , preeclampsia ) separately with bmi groups ( normal weight , overweight , obese ) and smoking status ( no , yes ). with logistic regression models we then simultaneously adjusted for all relevant covariates ( maternal age at delivery , parity and multiple gestations ) identified by backward selection and yates continuity corrections [ 19 ] .
other available covariates did not affect the effect estimates , but in all instances calendar year was controlled for by the study design , i.e. matching on year of birth .
as the matching criteria was wide , i.e. the only matching condition being that cases and controls gave birth during the same calendar year , we chose not to conduct conditional regression models .
we tested additive and multiplicative interactions of maternal smoking and overweight / obesity and estimated multiplicative joint effects for maternal smoking and overweight / obesity .
we performed sensitivity analyses : 1 ) to validate the registration of hypertensive outcomes in the medical birth registry we extracted systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) levels , measured at first and last prenatal visits , from the maternity records of all cases and controls .
s1 fig demonstrates higher blood pressure values among cases than controls , especially at the last prenatal visit .
( s1 fig. mean blood pressure ( mm hg ) by diagnosis of hypertensive disorder during pregnancy ) .
we then further restricted hypertensive cases to those that met the threshold of at least 140 mmhg sbp or 90 mmhg dbp at the last ( preeclampsia , gestational hypertension ) and first prenatal visit ( pre - existing hypertension ) .
data on proteinuria in maternity records were not accessible to use for validation of the hypertensive outcomes .
2 ) to evaluate the effect of potential misclassification of bmi exposure because of weight gained in early pregnancy , we restricted all analyses to women who had their first prenatal visit before the end of pregnancy week 15 .
all analyses were performed using r.2.7 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) statistical software for computing .
the study was approved by the icelandic national bioethics committee ( vsnb2012040011 / 03.07 ) and the data protection authority ( 2012050619at / - ) .
an informed consent from women in the study population was not obtained as all personal information was anonymized and de - identified prior to analysis .
results demographic and pregnancy characteristics of women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy ( cases ) and controls ( no hypertensive disorders ) are detailed in table 1 .
the demographic characteristics of cases and controls were largely similar , but they differed in parity .
hypertensive cases were more likely than controls to be nulliparous ( 59 % vs. 39 %) , and they were also slightly younger than the controls ( 28.1 vs. 28.5 years ) .
the distribution of characteristics of women with known and unknown bmi values were also similar ( s1 table ) , except women with missing bmi were more likely to be non - icelandic .
according to measured height and weight at around 13 weeks of pregnancy , 1.7 % ( n = 24 ) of the 1445 women were underweight , 57.4 % ( n = 829 ) were normal weight , 26.0 % ( n = 376 ) overweight and 14.9 % ( n = 216 ) were obese .
we collapsed the underweight women with the normal weight group in all analyses .
the odds of being diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy were lower for smokers than non - smokers ( 13.9 % vs. 21.2 %) ; with a crude odds ratio of 0.60 ( 95 % ci 0.44 - 0.82 ) .
adjusting for parity , multiple gestation , maternal age or any other available covariate did not affect the effect estimate ( oradjusted = 0.60 , 95 % ci 0.44 - 0.82 ) .
we found a reverse association of smoking with each separate hypertensive outcome but the or magnitude differed ; preeclampsia ( oradjusted = 0.68 , 95 % ci 0.47 - 0.96 ) , gestational hypertension ( oradjusted = 0.31 , 95 % ci 0.13 - 0.75 ) and pre - existing hypertension ( oradjusted = 0.53 , 95 % ci 0.26 - 0.97 ) .
the point estimates of the reverse associations diminished in magnitude with increasing bmi , for any hypertensive disorder and for preeclampsia as shown in s2 table .
the associations between bmi and hypertensive disorder during pregnancy are detailed in table 2 .

adjusting for parity , multiple gestation and maternal age amplified positive effect estimates somewhat .
we found positive associations of bmi with each separate hypertensive outcome ( preeclampsia , gestational hypertension and pre - existing hypertension ) .
in comparison to normal weight women , the odds of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension increased by about 1.7 - fold for overweight women and 2.4 - to 3 - fold for obese women , with effect estimates slightly higher when adjusting for parity , multiple gestation and maternal age .
the adjusted odds ratios were highest for pre - existing hypertension ; 1.79 and 4.42 among overweight and obese women , respectively , compared with normal weight women .
only maternal age seemed to affect the association between bmi and pre - existing hypertension , by slightly attenuating the estimates .

the effect estimates stratified by smoking status were of similar magnitude for preeclampsia , but we lacked statistical power to meaningfully evaluate the association of bmi with gestational hypertension and pre - existing hypertension .
neither additive nor multiplicative interactions of maternal smoking and overweight / obesity were significant .

analyzing bmi as a continuous independent variable did not significantly alter the results of the main analysis associations demonstrated in tables 2 and 3 .
restricting all analyses to women with the first prenatal visit before end of pregnancy week 15 did not significantly alter the observed effect estimates .
restricting cases to women with the specified blood pressure criteria led to increased or magnitudes for the associations of bmi with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension , but attenuated or magnitudes for pre - existing hypertension ( data not shown ) .
discussion the results of this population based case - control study indicate that overweight and obese women are , compared with women of normal weight , at increased risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy , including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension .
in our data the risk increased appeared to be amplified in women who smoke .
conversely , smoking alone appears to attenuate the risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy .
these findings may help elucidate the complicated interplay of these lifestyle - related factors with the hypertensive disorders .
the risk increase we observed for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy was nearly 2 - fold among overweight women and 3 - fold among obese women when compared with normal weight women .
a dose - dependent relation of bmi was apparent with each separate hypertensive outcome , i.e. preeclampsia , pre - existing and gestational hypertension .
this is consistent with previous results found among pregnant women , although most have focused on the relationship with preeclampsia [ 20 , 21 ] .
but as bateman et al .
[ 22 ] demonstrated , using nationally representative data from nhanes , obesity is an independent risk factor for hypertension among all women of reproductive age , with prevalence increasing in near linear fashion with bmi .
consistent with the elevated risk for preeclampsia observed among overweight ( or = 1.7 ) and obese ( or = 2.4 ) women in our data , bodnar et al .
[ 20 ] also found that pre - pregnancy bmi had a dose - dependent relation with preeclampsia , with a triple risk among women with a bmi of 30 compared with women who had a bmi of 21 .
these findings are in line with the results of a systematic review from 2003 , including 13 cohort studies , that the risk of developing preeclampsia doubled for every 5 - 7 kg / m2 increase in bmi [ 23 ] .
most previous studies assessing bmi and gestational hypertension have analyzed it as a combined outcome with preeclampsia [ 20 , 24 ] .
as these two hypertensive conditions have been shown to share many risk factors [ 25 ] , their similar association with bmi as demonstrated in our data is not of surprise .
pre - existing hypertension and preeclampsia / gestational hypertension are , on the other hand , viewed as independent entities [ 17 ] .
while the latter generally occur after week 20 of pregnancy , pre - existing hypertension is by definition detected earlier .
several studies have , however , demonstrated these different entities to share at least one risk factor , namely obesity [ 22 , 26 ] .
but as bmi and smoking - status were measured after the onset of pre - existing hypertension in our data , we cannot ascertain these as definite causal risk factors for pre - existing hypertension , even though effect estimates indicate associations thereof .
advanced age has also been considered in previous studies a risk factor for pre - existing hypertension [ 22 ] .
after adjusting for age in our data the positive relationship between overweight / obesity and pre - existing hypertension remained , although slightly attenuated , which could reflect an independent effects of age or the duration of obesity or smoking habits on the outcome .
in line with previous findings [ 27 - 29 ] , our data showed an inverse association between smoking and preeclampsia / gestational hypertension , primarily in women of normal weight .
conclusive results regarding potential effect modification of bmi on this association between smoking and hypertensive disorders can , however , not be drawn from our data due to lack of statistical power .
although non - conclusive , underlying biologic pathways for this inverse association have been hypothesized ; such as the role of circulating angiogenic proteins [ 30 ] , which could be released through the combustion of tobacco products , e.g. carbon monoxide [ 29 ] .
recently it has also been hypothesized that this inverse association with smoking may be due to miscarriage , or preterm delivery , of pregnancies with poor placentation due to smoking , i.e. smokers that would have developed hypertension or preeclampsia had they completed 40 weeks [ 31 , 32 ] .
in our data , cases , i.e. women with hypertensive disorders , were more likely than controls to give births preterm .
but how does smoking affect the observed risk increase among overweight and obese women for hypertensive disorders ?
although our results indicated that the increased risk of hypertensive disorders with overweight / obesity might be higher among smokers than non - smokers , observations based on a larger number of pregnancies are needed to draw a definite conclusion on this .
previous studies have shown somewhat conflicting results on the combined association of bmi and smoking on the hypertensive outcomes during pregnancy .
while , very few studies have examined smoking as an effect modifier , some have studied how bmi affects the association between smoking and hypertensive disorders .
stone et al .
[ 33 ] suggested in a retrospective study based on data from birth certificates , that smoking decreased the risk for preeclampsia regardless of women pre - pregnancy bmi .
while on the other hand , ness et al .
[ 11 ] showed in a large , prospective cohort study that the inverse association between preeclampsia and smoking was eliminated if a woman was overweight or obese .
however , as their study data were based on 7,757 pregnancies from over five decades ago , i.e. 1959 to 1965 , obese and overweight women had to be pooled into one group for the lack of obese women .
nevertheless , the results of ness et al. are in line with our supplementary data indicating that the inverse association decreases as women 's bmi increases , although lack of statistical power in our data impedes conclusive results on smoking as an effect modifier .
study strengths and limitations the present study was conducted over a 15 - year period in iceland , where women have equal access to prenatal care free of charge [ 12 ] .
the data originated from women who gave birth at the national university hospital , where over 75 % of all births in the country occurred [ 13 ] .
the study strengths mainly lie in the homogeneous study population , uniform diagnostic - and health care system , which reduce residual confounding by factors such as socio - economic status and differential prenatal care .
although the biological effects studied are likely to be generalizable beyond the icelandic population , this cannot be empirically validated and , as such , the homogeneity may compromise the generalizability of our findings .
our study has several limitations .
first , we restricted the study population to women with no registered diagnosis of diabetes , as screening was not uniform during the study period .
future work will need to be directed at understanding the role of diabetes as a confounder / mediator of the association between bmi and hypertensive disorders , and the way in which it impacts on the observed interaction between bmi , smoking status , and hypertensive disorders .
second , the exact dates of hypertensive diagnoses were not available , limiting our possibility to know if the disorder had an early or late onset ( i.e. before or after week 34 of pregnancy ) .
previous findings have indicated that while early onset of preeclampsia may be linked to abnormal placentation [ 34 ] and have a genetic component [ 35 ] , late onset is more likely to be related to maternal factors [ 34 , 36 ] .
in both instances , though , obesity has been indicated as a crucial risk factor [ 21 ] .
third , although all hypertensive diagnoses in this study were based on icd - 10 codes , misclassification of disease status may be a possibility and our data do not include information on patients' history or family history of hypertension during pregnancy .
to evaluate the validity of diagnoses in the medical birth registry we compared women 's diagnosis status with their mean blood pressure values , as registered in maternity records at the first and last prenatal visits .
when we restricted cases to women who additionally met the blood pressure criteria for hypertension according to maternity records , the effect estimates were intensified for both preeclampsia and gestational hypertension .
fourth , misclassification of exposure is also a possibility .
to minimize the effect misclassification due to weight gained during early pregnancy , we restricted all analyses to women who had their bmi measured before the end of pregnancy week 15 and found very similar effect estimates as observed in the main analyses .
further , demographic and pregnancy characteristics were similarly distributed between women with known and unknown bmi .
finally , as smoking was self - reported some women may have misreported their status .
we would expect such misreporting mainly to have been smokers classified as non - smokers , which would in turn have attenuated the observed difference in effect estimates for hypertensive disorders with overweight / obesity between smokers and non - smokers .
similarly , such misreporting would have attenuated the inverse associations found between smoking and hypertensive disorders .
conclusion in conclusion , our data indicate that obesity and overweight play a crucial role in relation to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and that smoking may potentially magnify this relation even further .
further research is needed to draw definite conclusions about the combined effects of these lifestyle - related factors on the hypertensive disorders , especially in light of current and previous findings showing that smoking has an independent inverse association with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy .

doi : 10.3389 / fimmu.2017.01376 osteoclast intereleukin - 7 intereleukin - 7 receptor alpha stat5 rankl monocyte in the original article , there was a mistake in the legend for figure 2 as published .
here , the expression " sfmcs from healthy individuals " should be corrected to " sfmcs " .
the correct legend appears below .
the authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way .
figure 2 | interleukin ( il ) - 7 induced osteoclast formation in synovial fluid mononuclear cells ( sfmcs ) from joint fluid of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) patients .
sfmcs were cultured with m - csf ( 20 ng / ml ) , rankl ( 50 ng / ml ) , or il - 7 ( 2 ng / ml ) for 10 days by replacing the medium at 3 - day intervals with fresh cytokines as described in figure 1 ( left panel ) .
to determine the effect of pretreatment with il - 7 , sfmcs were cultured with il - 7 ( 2 ng / ml ) for 3 days , then treated with m - csf ( 20 ng / ml ) , rankl ( 50 ng / ml ) , or il - 7 ( 2 ng / ml ) for 7 days , replacing the medium as described above ( right panel ) .
trap staining and enumeration were performed as described in figure 1 .
representative images ( a ) and quantification ( b ) of trap + cells at days 10 and 15 are shown .
results are representative of five independent experiments with five different donors .
bars represent the mean and p values were obtained using the unpaired two - tailed student 's t - test .
( c ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured on top of dentine disks in 96 - well culture plates in the above condition for 30 days .
then , surface roughness was analyzed as described in figure 1 .
results illustrate three independent experiments ( n = 3 ) .
roughness parameter and the number of pits were analyzed as described in figure 1 .
the graph represents the mean +/ - sem and p values were obtained using the unpaired two - tailed student 's t - test .
the original article was updated .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

burns and goldstein raise several issues regarding our paper ( kamel et al .
2005 ) , in which we reported that applicators chronically exposed to moderate levels of pesticide experience more neurologic symptoms .
they assert that our measures of exposure and effect are not " meaningful. " we disagree .
burns and goldstein state that "' multiple symptoms' is not a definable disease or illness. " although this is true , symptoms cause many medical visits and so are significant to public health .
further , we made no claim that applicators reporting more symptoms had a particular disease .
indeed , in some of our analyses we purposely excluded individuals reporting neurologic disease in order to evaluate associations of pesticide use specifically with symptoms .
we studied a mixed group of symptoms , all sometimes associated with neurologic dysfunction or disease , although with varying specificity .
excluding two relatively nonspecific symptoms ( headache and fatigue ) did not appreciably change the distribution of the symptom variable .
the assertion that we limited our analysis to " a single episode " is inaccurate : our main analyses evaluated multiple rather than single symptoms , and we took symptom frequency into account in our analysis of individual symptoms ( kamel et al. 2005 ; table 4 ) .
we acknowledged the limitations of cross - sectional analysis in our article .
however , the associations we observed were with cumulative pesticide use ; accounting for recent use did not change results .
the issue is not whether the symptoms we studied are diagnostic of neurologic or other disease , but whether experiencing these symptoms is associated with pesticide exposure .
burns and goldstein cite lundberg et al .
( 1997 ) but omit lundberg et al. ' s conclusion that the exposure - related relationship of symptom reporting to organic solvent exposure makes this approach useful for comparing groups with different exposures .
at least 23 previous studies used symptom reporting to evaluate neurologic effects of pesticide exposure , with 19 reporting positive associations ( kamel and hoppin 2004 ) .
we extended this approach to a very large group of applicators who had detailed exposure information available .
burns and goldstein discuss potential factors related to symptoms , citing spurgeon 's biopsychosocial model ( spurgeon et al. 1996 ) .
we agree that personal and social factors likely influence both experience and reporting of symptoms .
however , spurgeon ( 2002 ) noted that discussion of the determinants of symptom reporting does not constitute a dismissal of the farmer 's illness but simply a recognition that it is likely to result from a complex interaction of physical , psychological , and social processes .
she described a study of farmers whose symptoms were associated with five factors , one being handling sheep within 48 hr of pesticide dipping .
thus , pesticide exposure may still be associated with increased symptoms even ( or perhaps especially ) when psychosocial factors are taken into account .
most of the factors burns and goldstein list are unlikely to be related to exposure in licensed applicators and so cannot explain the associations seen .
further , confounding by psychosocial factors would likely produce associations with all types of pesticides , but our findings were specific to insecticides .
finally , we do not understand burn 's and goldstein 's comment that our findings are " the result ... of a common ailment such as influenza " ; are they suggesting that pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of flu ?
burns and goldstein call our exposure measures limited , citing biomonitoring studies which show that variations in internal exposure are not completely correlated with external exposure .
this point is largely irrelevant because the associations seen depend not on identifying the absolute level of pesticide exposure but rather on ranking applicators as relatively more or less exposed .
variation in the degree to which self - reported days of use represents internal exposure is probably nondifferential with respect to symptom reporting , with resulting misclassification likely to bias associations towards the null ; the true relationship may be stronger than we observed .
our findings of associations with insecticides only , and with cumulative but not recent exposure , suggest that recall bias does not fully account for our results .
we see no problem in combining pesticides for a class - wide analysis , particularly because many grouped pesticides exert effects through similar or related biologic mechanisms .
using class - wide analyses may minimize confounding because most applicators used multiple pesticides .
ultimately , it will be interesting to evaluate the effects of individual chemicals ; we are planning such studies .
thus , our measures of both exposure and effect are sufficient for their purpose , which is to examine the association of symptom reporting with moderate insecticide exposure .
our study clearly demonstrates such an association .
importantly , it is independent of both recent exposure and a history of high exposure or poisoning , suggesting that lifetime exposure at moderate levels may have health consequences .
this finding has implications for farmers' health and deserves to be reported and evaluated further .

background laparoscopic - assisted transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( laercp ) is used for treatment in patients after roux - en - y gastric bypass ( rygb ) , where transoral access to the biliary tree is not possible .
we describe our technique and experience with this procedure .
methods electronic medical record search was performed from september 2012 to january 2016 , identifying patients who underwent laercp per operative records .
charts were reviewed for demographic , clinical , and outcomes data .
results sixteen patients were identified .
average time since bypass was 6.9 years , and length of stay was 3.7 days .
five patients underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy .
eleven patients , or 43 % , had cholecystectomy more than 2 years previously .
ercp with sphincterotomy was completed in 15 of 16 patients ( 94 %) .
our technique involves access to the bypassed stomach via a laparoscopically placed 15 mm port .
we observed one major complication of post - ercp necrotizing pancreatitis .
no minor complications nor mortalities were seen in our series .
conclusion biliary obstruction can occur many years after rygb and cholecystectomy .
our findings suggest that rygb patients may be at a higher risk of primary cbd stone formation .
laercp is a reliable option for common bile duct ( cbd ) clearance ; our technique of laercp is technically simple and associated with low complication rate , making it appealing to surgeons not trained in advanced laparoscopy .
1. introduction roux - en - y gastric bypass ( rygb ) alters gastrointestinal anatomy such that transoral endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) is not routinely feasible .
bariatric surgery patients are predisposed to cholelithiasis , especially within the rapid weight loss period of 12 - 18 months postoperatively .
cholecystectomy at time of bypass is not routinely performed because ursodiol use postoperatively reduces the incidence of gallstone formation [ 1 , 2 ] .
nevertheless , patients after gastric bypass will continue to develop indications for ercp because of choledocholithiasis .
several approaches exist to access the biliary system in this patient population .
endoscopic intubation of preexisting open gastrostomies was first reported in the 1970s for both gastrointestinal bleeding and ercp [ 3 ] .
the first laparoscopic gastrostomy created specifically for ercp was reported in 2002 [ 4 ] .
early techniques for laercp included creation of gastrostomy and then allowing several weeks of maturation before use [ 4 , 5 ] .
in 2007 , ceppa et al .
[ 6 ] described a laparoscopic purse - string technique with immediate intraoperative gastrotomy closure with sutures or staples in ten patients with no surgical complications .
several other techniques have been described ; however , they can be technically challenging or require multistep procedures [ 7 - 12 ] .
nonsurgical alternatives with the use of interventional radiology ( ir ) or endoscopic techniques exist , but they tend to involve external drains and multiple procedures [ 13 - 17 ] .
a retrospective review by brockmeyer et al .
[ 18 ] studied rates of biliary symptoms after rygb in 1366 patients .
three hundred and eighty patients had cholecystectomy before rygb , and three of this group developed primary cbd stones (< 1 %) .
two of the three patients were treated with laercp , and one required ptc clearance of the biliary system [ 17 ] .
these results indicate that primary common duct stone formation was a relatively rare event in this population .
our aim is to report our technique and experience with a combined endoscopic - surgical procedure for management of biliary obstruction in patients post - rygb .
2. methods the study is a retrospective review of operative cases performed at our tertiary referral center in winston - salem , north carolina .
after approval by our institutional review board , a chart review of our electronic medical record ( emr ) from september 2012 to january 2016 was performed .
a keyword search of operative reports was performed using the following terms : ercp , sphincterotomy , laparoscopic gastrostomy , laparoscopic gastrotomy , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , and cholangiography .
inclusion criteria were age greater than 18 , rygb bariatric surgery patients , and laercp dictated in operative report .
indications for ercp were choledocholithiasis , cholangitis , and radiographic or clinical evidence of common bile duct ( cbd ) obstruction .
four surgeons and two gastroenterologists were involved .
nineteen patients were identified who met the screening criteria. of these 19 patients , three patients were excluded because they had cbd clearance laparoscopically .
sixteen patient charts were then reviewed , and information was gathered for analysis , including patient demographics , laboratory and physiologic data , surgical history , operative and endoscopic reports , hospital length of stay , postprocedure outcomes , and follow - up .
3. operative technique our operative technique was similar in all 16 patients ; some variability in laparoscopic port placement occurred in those patients undergoing simultaneous cholecystectomy .
if recent cholecystectomy had occurred , an open technique was employed to place a periumbilical port through a previous port site .
if the abdomen had not been recently accessed , we entered with a 5 mm optical trocar in either the right or left upper quadrant just below the costal margin with the side chosen at the surgeon 's discretion .
a 12 mm port was placed in the right upper quadrant for passage of the stapler , and it was used if simultaneous cholecystectomy was to be done .
two additional 5 mm ports were placed on either side of the 12 mm port in an arc surrounding the right costal margin .
in cases that included cholecystectomy , additional 5 mm ports were placed as per the standard technique .
if the patient had a gallbladder present , it was dissected , a cholangiogram was performed , and it was removed via a standard technique .
cholangiogram was performed with intraoperative consult to gi in those patients with rygb anatomy undergoing cholecystectomy for gallbladder pathology and uncertain preoperative assessment of the common duct .
cholangiograms were not performed in those patients who had previous cholecystectomy as preoperative radiographic assessment was adequate to establish choledocholithasis and need for ercp .
the bypassed stomach was identified , and adhesions were lysed to mobilize the greater curve up to the abdominal wall .
an incision was made in the left upper quadrant to accommodate a 15 mm port .
two 2 - 0 pds or prolene sutures were placed through the anterior wall of the stomach on either side of the proposed gastrostomy site .
a gastrostomy was then created with cautery .
early in the series , the gastrostomy site was dilated to accommodate a 15 mm port .
this step was deemed to be unnecessary , and it was subsequently omitted .
a 15 mm port was placed through the abdominal wall and guided through the gastrostomy as stomach was brought to the abdominal wall with the use of the stay sutures ( figure 1 ) .
the sutures were then clamped tight to hold the stomach against the abdominal wall .
the 15 mm port was then redraped widely for the endoscopy team to proceed with nonsterile ercp .
after the ercp was completed , the 15 mm port was removed , and the gastrotomy was closed with the use of an endoscopic gastrointestinal stapler using a 3.5 mm staple load .
if the patient required repeat endoscopic access of the stomach or biliary tract , the gastrotomy was converted into a stamm gastrostomy .
the patient was either sent home from the postoperative recovery unit or admitted for observation .
4. results we identified sixteen cases of laercp in patients status post - rygb for morbid obesity .
all patients were intraoperatively confirmed to have standard rygb anatomy .
eleven of sixteen patients ( 69 %) had undergone cholecystectomy before laercp .
seven of the eleven , or 43 % , had cholecystectomy performed greater than 2 years prior to presentation , with a range of 2 - 17 years .
four of eleven patients with prior cholecystectomy had cholecystectomy at referring institution , immediately prior to transfer or referral , where intraoperative cholangiogram revealed a filling defect in the cbd .
the remaining five patients ( 31 %) underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy with laercp at our institution .
table 1displays our patient 's demographic and descriptive data .
the longest time from referral to intervention was seven weeks from the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis .
three patients had laercp within 48 hours of direct transfer .
four asymptomatic patients were scheduled electively .
three patients underwent an attempt at transoral ercp by gastroenterologists at referring institutions prior to referral .
the average time between cholecystectomy and laercp was nine years ( range 0 - 15 years ) .
four patients underwent outpatient procedures , defined as hospital stay less than 24 hours .
the overall average length of stay was 3.7 days .
all patients were initially sent to the floor .
one patient who developed post - ercp pancreatitis required subsequent admission to the intensive care unit .
table 2 summarizes our perioperative data .
ercp with sphincterotomy and cannulation of the cbd was successful in 15 of 16 patients ( 94 %) .
in one patient , the ampulla could not be identified endoscopically .
this patient required a percutaneous transhepatic choledochostomy ( ptc ) drain to relieve cbd obstruction and allow access for duct clearance over a 4 - week period .
in all fifteen laercp procedures , cholangiogram findings were consistent with choledocholithiasis , and balloon - sweep clearance of the duct was successful .
in the five cases of simultaneous cholecystectomy , intraoperative cholangiograms via the gallbladder were performed , and all revealed filling defects .
in one patient , a cystic duct stump leak was noted at the time of laercp that resulted from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed one week priorly .
primary closure of the cystic duct stump could not be performed .
a biliary stent was placed via ercp , and the gastrostomy was converted to a gastrostomy tube for retrieval of the stent after leak resolution at 6 weeks .
one patient was converted to laparotomy with continued endoscopy to locate the ampulla of vater , which was successful .
this patient had a history of laparoscopic rygb 13 years before and a gastrojejunostomy revision 6 years before laercp .
a portion of the gastric remnant was resected at laparotomy due to nonviability from extensive adhesiolysis and dissection .
the patient subsequently suffered post - ercp necrotizing pancreatitis with associated critical illness that eventually necessitated video - assisted retroperitoneal debridement ( vard ) .
this was the major morbidity for our series , and no minor complications occurred .
all patients underwent successful cbd clearance .
there were no mortalities at 30 days .
5. discussion our institution 's experience illustrates several points not already described in the literature .
we describe a technique that can be a single - stage procedure that is technically uncomplicated .
our technique proved to be a useful tool in treating the combination of choledocholithasis and associated cystic duct stump leak .
this particular patient had the gastrostomy tube removed 6 weeks after a repeat ercp and stent removal after confirming resolution of the cystic stump leak .
the management of this combination with laercp has not been described in the literature before .
we performed five simultaneous cholecystectomy and laercp procedures , with four patients undergoing cholecystectomy within 6 weeks of laercp .
seven of sixteen patients had remote cholecystectomy with average time before laercp of 9 years .
for the series , the average time since rygb was 6.9 years .
interestingly , 43 % of our patients presented two or more years after initial cholecystectomy .
our findings suggest that cbd obstruction can occur many years after both cholecystectomy and gastric bypass .
this suggests that rygb may predispose patients to primary cbd stone formation .
more investigation into the causes and preventive measures should be considered based on these results .
familiarity with laercp as a means of biliary system clearance for obstructing stones is recommended for surgeons caring for patients who have had rygb , as this patient population can develop biliary obstruction from stones even after cholecystectomy .
the need for laercp will only increase as the number of rygb patients continues to grow , necessitating nonbariatric surgeons to be familiar with the procedure .
the technique presented here for access is simple and effective and can be utilized by surgeons without advanced laparoscopic or bariatric surgery training .
we had one failure of the procedure necessitating ir ptc placement with eventual clearance of stones over a 4 - week period .
we had one complication of post - ercp necrotizing pancreatitis .
our failure and complication rates are consistent with those reported in the literature [ 4 , 5 , 10 ] .
limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the small size of the case series .
long - term follow - up was limited , as most of the patients returned to their referring physicians and institutions .
6. conclusion a subset of patients will develop cbd obstruction after rygb and require clearance alternatives to standard transoral ercp .
we choose laercp because it allowed for the possibility of treating patients with a single - stage procedure , avoiding drain or gastrostomy tube maintenance .
the patient population that will require laercp is small , but it will increase as rygb is employed as a treatment for the epidemic of obesity in this country .
primary common bile duct stone formation may be higher than in the general population , as 43 % of our patients were two or more years from cholecystectomy at presentation .
it is possible that rygb anatomy and physiology create a predisposition for primary common duct stones .
this finding is not well described and needs further research .

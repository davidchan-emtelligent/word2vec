acinetobacter baumannii is a gram - negative bacterium capable of causing hospital - acquired infections that has been grouped with enterococcus faecium , staphylococcus aureus , klebsiella pneumoniae , acinetobacter baumannii , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and enterobacter species as eskape pathogens because of their extensive drug resistance phenotypes and increasing risk to human health .
twenty - four multidrug - resistant a. baumannii strains isolated from wounded military personnel were sequenced and annotated .
u.s. department of defense ( dod ) http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100000005w81xwh - 12 - 2 - 0035luis a. actiscover - datejuly / august 2016 genome announcement the gram - negative coccobacillus acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic human pathogen causing myriad human diseases , including pneumonia , bacteremia , urinary tract infections , meningitis , and wound infections. a. baumannii is the fifth most common gram - negative pathogen associated with nosocomial infections ( 1 , 2 ). of concern is the increasing multidrug resistance of a. baumannii isolates , which has caused this bacterium to be included as an eskape ( enterococcus faecium , staphylococcus aureus , klebsiella pneumoniae , acinetobacter baumannii , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and enterobacter species ) pathogen , underscoring its ability to " escape " antimicrobials ( 3 ) .
in fact , a. baumannii strains resistant to all known antibiotics have been encountered , demonstrating the paramount impact of this pathogen on public health ( 2 ) .
the genomes of 24 a. baumannii strains isolated from wounded warriors at walter reed army medical center ( wramc ) and san antonio military medical center ( sammc ) , fort sam houston , san antonio , tx , were sequenced using next - generation sequencing for future analyses to investigate the resistance and virulence mechanisms of this emerging pathogen .
as described previously , strains were routinely stored at - 80degreesc in 10 % glycerol ( 4 ) .
dna was isolated from overnight lb cultures grown with agitation at 37degreesc using the dneasy blood and tissue kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) .
absorption at 260 nm and 280 nm was measured for each sample to determine quantity and quality using the nanodrop 2000 ( thermo scientific , wilmington , de , usa ) .
dna concentrations for library preparation were determined by the sybr green ( life technologies , grand island , ny ) standard curve method in a black 96 - well plate ( corning , tewksbury , ma , usa ) using a filtermax f5 spectrophotometer with multimode analysis software version 3.4.0.25 ( molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) .
whole dna was sheared to approximately 500 bp in a microtube - 50 using an m220 focused ultrasonicator ( covaris , woburn , ma , usa ) .
fragmentation of the resultant libraries was examined with a bioanalyzer 2100 high - sensitivity dna analysis kit ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) using version b.02.08.si648 software .
individual libraries were normalized , pooled , and then sequenced using the miseq version 3 600 - cycle kit ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) to perform 300 - bp paired - end sequencing on a miseq instrument ( illumina ) , per the manufacturer 's instructions .
de novo assembly was performed using genomics workbench 8.0 with the bacterial genome finishing module ( clc bio , boston , ma , usa ) run on a workstation with an amd opteron 2.10 ghz 16 - core processor with 128 gb ddr3 ecc random access memory ( ram ) .
genomes were annotated with prokka version 1.10 on a quad - core i7 workstation with 32 gb ddr3 running ubuntu 14.04 lts ( 5 ) .
the de novo assembly statistics for 24 a. baumannii isolates are shown in table 1 .

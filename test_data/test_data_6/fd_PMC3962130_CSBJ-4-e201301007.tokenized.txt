natural remedies , such as those based on traditional chinese medicines , have become more popular also in western countries over the last 10 years .
the composition of these herbal products is largely unknown and difficult to determine .
moreover , since plants respond to their environment changing the metabolome , the composition of plant material can vary depending on the plant growth conditions .
however , there is a growing need of a deeper knowledge on such natural remedies also in view of the growing number of reports of toxicity following the consumption of herbal supplements .
untargeted metabolomics is a useful approach for the simultaneous analysis of many compounds in herbal products .
in particular , liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) can determine presence , amount and sometime structures of plant metabolites in complex herbal mixtures , with significant advantages over techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) .
lc - ms herbal products herbal intoxications natural remedies daucus carota multivariate analysis 1 ) introduction plants have provided humans with medicines since the dawn of civilization , and up to 80 % of the population in many asian and african countries still depends on traditional herbal medicines for primary health care [ 1 ] .
in western countries , herbal medicines were supplanted by modern drugs with defined pharmaceutical ingredients , but their popularity is increasing once again , particularly for the alleviation of mild disease symptoms .
approximately one third of the uk adult population now uses herbal products [ 2 ] and the market for herbal medicines in the usa was $ us 5 billion in 2010 [ 3 ] .
herbal medicines raise a number of safety issues such as the identification of plant materials in herbal products , the active principles , the method of preparation , dosing regimens , the potential to interact with other herbal remedies and conventional drugs , and assurances that herbal products are genuine and do not contain toxins or contaminants .
the lack of clear safety guidelines for herbal medicines has resulted in many reports of toxic effects , such as the 13 cases of hepatic toxicity leading to the withdrawal of a green tea product used for weight loss , which was distributed by exolise ( arkopharma , carros , france ) [ 2 ] .
green tea ( prepared from camellia sinensis leaves ) is a popular herbal product that contains polyphenols such as catechins , which are thought to promote health by reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease , diabetes and obesity [ 4 ] .
the cluster of hepatic toxicity cases mentioned above was probably caused by high levels of epigallocatechin gallate ( egcg ) [ 5 ] .
although low doses of egcg appear to be safe and even beneficial , it is impossible to control the dosage of herbal products as effectively as formulated pharmaceuticals [ 6 ] .
other plants often used in herbal preparations ( e.g. heliotropium spp. , senecio spp. , symphytum spp. , crotalaria spp. and borago officinalis ) accumulate high levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids , which can induce veno - occlusive disease ( vod ) associated with acute liver failure or liver fibrosis and cirrhosis [ 5 ] .
valeriana officinalis is a popular herbal product used to alleviate insomnia but extracts are known to induce severe hepatitis , supported by in vitro studies that demonstrate the inhibition of cytochrome p450 isoforms cyp3a4 , cyp2d6 and cyp2c19 [ 7 ] .
the regulation of herbal products marketing has been attempted through initiatives such as the traditional herbal medicinal products directive ( thmpd ) which came into force throughout the european union ( eu ) in april 2011 [ 2 ] .
under this directive , a plant product is eligible for registration as a traditional herbal medicine only if it has been used as treatment for specific minor ailments for at least 30 years , including a minimum of 15 years in europe .
the efficacy and safety of such plant products is accepted only if a long history of use is demonstrated .
however , no clinical trials are required , which sets traditional herbal medicines aside from newer herbal products and defined pharmaceutical ingredients .
in the usa , herbal products are regulated as dietary supplements , and no claims that they prevent diseases are allowed , so fda registration and chemical analysis are not required .
however , if specific health claims are made , then the products must be registered as drugs and must undergo the rigorous fda approval process [ 2 ] .
beside the existing national or over - national laws , the effective safety and regulation of herbal products do require methods that can provide convincing evidence of clinical efficacy ( in some cases through clinical trials ) and powerful analytical tools that can determine the composition of herbal products and identify the active principles .
metabolomics appears ideal for this purpose .
according to the metabolomics society home page , metabolomics can be defined as the " comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in a biological system " ( http :// www.metabolomicssociety.org /) .
in turn , such small metabolites represent the outcome of gene expression and define the biochemical phenotype of a cell , tissue , organ and organism .
the small metabolites include the intermediates and end products of metabolism , and they compass both primary metabolites ( e.g. sugars , amino acids , fatty acids and organic acids ) and secondary metabolites ( e.g. phenylpropanoids and alkaloids ) .
metabolomics can also characterize the dynamic metabolome , reflecting changes in the abundance of small molecules during development and in response to external stresses .
the most popular analytical methods in metabolomics are those based on nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry ( ms ) .
nmr allows the rapid , high - throughput and automated analysis of crude extracts , and the quantitative detection of many different groups of metabolites [ 8 , 9 ] , providing also structural information including stereochemical details [ 10 ] .
however , nmr is less sensitive than ms - based approaches [ 9 ] and nmr data have been metaphorically compared to ' the tip of the iceberg ' , with lc - ms providing details of the much larger , submerged portion [ 11 ]. between these extremes , gc - ms is particularly suitable for the detection of thermally stable volatile compounds ( or compounds with volatile derivatives ) .
lc - ms is more sensitive than gc - ms and it allows the analysis of thermally labile non - volatile compounds [ 12 ] .
the molecules that can be detected by lc - ms range from polar sugars and non - aromatic organic acids [ 13 ] through to various lipids [ 14 ] , as discussed in recent reviews [ 9 , 12 , 15 ] .
here we focus on the use of lc - ms for untargeted metabolomics , allowing the composition of complex plant tissues and their products to be unraveled .
2 ) lc - ms untargeted metabolomics allows the comprehensive analysis of complex plant tissues the ability to analyze various kinds of metabolites by lc - ms depends strongly on the ionization source and the chromatographic method used for analyte fractionation and elution .
two examples are provided in fig. 1. the first is a grape berry methanolic extract , analyzed using an electrospray ionization ( esi ) source and reverse phase chromatography with gradient elution rising to 75 % acetonitrile , allowing the detection of sugars , aromatic and aliphatic organic acids , anthocyanins , flavonoids and stilbenes ( fig. 1a and table 1 ) .
the second is an arabidopsis thaliana methanolic extract , analyzed using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ( apci ) source and reverse phase chromatography with prolonged equilibration in 100 % acetonitrile , allowing the additional detection of polar lipids such as monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and digalactosyl diacylglycerol ( fig. 1b ) .
therefore , among the available approaches , lc - ms - based untargeted metabolomics combines high sensitivity and an untargeted approach to provide an ideal procedure for the analysis of a wide range of non - volatile metabolites .

the experimental design , extraction and data acquisition methods depend on the aim of the investigation , on the material used for analysis and the available instrumentation [ 16 ] .
several recent studies have considered the challenge of data processing in untargeted metabolomics , which has benefited enormously from the development of automated procedures [ 15 , 17 ] .
recent data - processing tools such as metalign ( http :// www.metalign.wur.nl ) , mzmine ( http :// mzmine.sourceforge.net /) and xcms ( http :// metlin.scripps.edu / download /) [ 18 ] are designed to extract relevant information automatically from batches of crude chromatographic data , allowing the rapid processing of thousands of data points , which transforms the concept of untargeted metabolomics into practical reality .
the principal challenges these tools must overcome include background subtraction , signal recognition , signal quantification and signal alignment , so that the output of a batch of lc - ms chromatograms is usually a table listing the amount of each signal in all samples .
figure 2 typical untargeted metabolomics workflow .
2.2 ) data analysis in untargeted metabolomics after data processing , data analysis can follow one of two major routes [ 15 ] .
if the aim is to profile a small number of specific metabolites , usually the more abundant ones ( targeted metabolomics ) , quantitative methods are used to analyze the targeted variables one by one and statistical significance can be tested using univariate methods or other classical statistical approaches .
in contrast , if the aim is to provide a holistic picture of the system under investigation ( untargeted metabolomics ) , a large number of known and unknown metabolites are quantified and all the obtained variables are considered simultaneously , making univariate and other classical statistical methods unfeasible .
indeed , to take into account the correlation structures between the measured variables , multivariate statistical methods must be applied .
both targeted and untargeted metabolomics reveal the expected behavior of known metabolites , but only untargeted metabolomics also allows the detection of synergic effects between variables which cannot be observed at an individual level .
untargeted metabolomics is usually a hypothesis - free approach .
the most widely - used multivariate techniques are those based on projection .
projection methods combine the measured variables into so - called latent variables that can solve the problem under investigation .
for exploratory data analysis principal component analysis ( pca ) can be successfully applied .
pca is an unsupervised technique that can summarize the information in an experimental data set using a small number of orthogonal latent variables obtained by searching the direction of maximum variance in the data set .
however , pca does not always extract hidden information that explains system behavior because this may not correspond to the information summarized in the latent variables .
supervised techniques may be preferred for these cases .
indeed , training sets comprising samples with well - known properties can be used to drive the projection in directions that produce latent variables capable of solving the problem of interest .
latent variable regression methods such as bidirectional - orthogonal projection to latent structures ( o2pls ) [ 19 ] and their formulation for discriminant analysis have been used successfully to solve regression or classification problems .
in many cases , the latent variables produced by projection can be interpreted in terms of single measured variables , and simple models can be built using a subset of the original data .
in particular , when classification problems are considered single putative markers can often be highlighted by exploring the latent structure of the projective model .
2.3 ) metabolite identification in untargeted metabolomics the identification of metabolites can be a significant challenge in untargeted metabolomics , particularly because plants often transform secondary metabolites by glycosylation and the formation of esters to generate species - dependent metabolic profiles .
these diverse molecules can be valuable in terms of their pharmacological properties but difficult to identify with accuracy .
several lc - ms metabolite feature databases have been assembled , such as massbank ( http :// www.massbank.jp / index.html ) [ 20 ] , metlin ( http :// metlin.scripps.edu /) [ 21 ] and ms2t ( http :// prime.psc.riken.jp / lcms / ms2tview / ms2tview.html ) [ 22 ] , but because of the sheer diversity of plant metabolites the coverage provided by databases remains inadequate .
however , the accurate mass determination and fragmentation patterns obtained by tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) , especially when combined with soft - ionization techniques such as esi , can allow the elucidation of metabolite structures de novo .
for example , high - performance liquid chromatography diode array detection ( hplc - dad ) , electrospray ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( hplc - esi - tof - ms ) and electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry ( hplc - esi - ms / ms ) have been used for the isolation , identification and structural analysis of water - soluble phenolic and nonpolar diterpenoid constituents in danshen roots ( salvia miltiorrhiza ) [ 23 ] and flavonoid compounds in extracts of dendrocalamopsis oldham leaves [ 24 ] .
in the latter study , the authors were able to determine the structures of 11 compounds , and thus identify four mono - c - glycosylflavones , three o,c - diglycosylflavones and three o - glycosylflavones , including three types of aglycone ( luteolin , apigenin and tricin ) .
in another example , esi - ms / ms was combined with reversed - phase hplc to identify proanthocyanidins in saskatoon berries ( amelanchier alnifolia ) , confirming the presence of multimeric proanthocyanidin compounds ranging from dimers through to heptamers and even higher polymers [ 25 ] .
3 ) lc - ms untargeted metabolomics can unravel environment - dependent plant cell composition plants are sessile organisms and must adapt to changes in their environment by modulating their developmental , physiological and biochemical responses .
plants benefit from the ability to synthesize a broad and diverse range of secondary metabolites , because such compounds allow them to adapt or survive when exposed to biotic and abiotic stress [ 26 , 27 ] .
the metabolic profile of plants can therefore change according to the environment , which means the active principles in herbal remedies can vary qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the growth conditions. from a quality control perspective , the active principles in herbal remedies need to be standardized , but this can be difficult in plants subjected to variable environments [ 28 ] .
3.1 ) responses of carrot cells to environmental conditions : an example of environment dependent cell composition unraveled by lc - ms untargeted metabolomics the challenging issue of determination of plant material composition requires adequate technologies in order to be properly faced .
lc - ms - based untargeted metabolomics , as described in the flow chart of fig. 2 , is suitable to analyze the environmental variability of plant cell accumulated metabolites .
a simple example ( data unpublished ) is the comparison of carrot suspension cells initially growing under standard conditions [ 29 , 30 ] , and then switched to constant light or darkness for one cell cycle ( 14 days ) .
methanolic extracts prepared from each of the cultures were analyzed by hplc - dad and hplc - esi - ms with the same methods described by toffali et al .
[ 31 ] .
the resulting hplc - dad chromatogram comprised 11 peaks corresponding to various hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids , anthocyanins , flavonoids and two unidentified molecules ( fig. 3 a - c ) .
however , quantitative analysis showed that the compounds represented by all 11 peaks were much less abundant in cells grown in the dark ( fig. 3 d ) .
many additional peaks were revealed by hplc - esi - ms ( fig. 3 e ) , and mzmine resolved 218 different signals , 75 of which were putatively identified including 65 metabolites and 10 isotopes and / or fragments .
the tentatively identified metabolites included 21 caffeic acid derivatives , 9 anthocyanins , 5 sucrose - derivatives , 5 sinapic acid derivatives , 4 ferulic acid derivatives , 2 coumaric acid derivatives , 13 hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives ( including 3 vanillic acid derivatives ) , 2 flavonoids and 4 non - aromatic organic acids .
the remaining 143 signals could not be identified but valuable information was nevertheless obtained because they were univocally identified by their mass to charge ratios , retention times and fragmentation patterns ( ms / ms and ms3 ) .
figure 3 r3m carrot cell suspension extract analyzed by hplc - dad and hplc - esi - ms. a : absorbance ( 245 - 600 nm ) expressed in arbitrary units ( mau ) using a scale is set from a minimum level of absorbance ( - 10 mau ) shown in purple , to a maximum (+ 100 mau ) shown in red .
b : chromatogram at 320 nm. c : chromatogram at 520 nm. the peaks were characterized by lc - ms as follows .

d : quantification of the 11 major peaks detected by lc - dad .
black and white columns represent cells cultivated in constant darkness and under constant illumination , respectively .
the values are the average of three independent biological replicates .
e : lc - esi - ms analysis of cells cultivated under constant illumination .
several peaks , which are not detected by lc - dad , are also present in the chromatogram .
three biological and two technical replicates were analyzed for each of the two growing conditions , so the dimension of the data matrix was ( 3 x 2 x 2 ) x 218 corresponding to 2616 data points .
o2pls - da was used to confirm the impact of light on the metabolome by imposing a two - class classification ( light / dark ) to generate a statistically significant model in which the light samples were clearly separated from the dark ones ( fig. 4 a ) .
the s - plot [ 32 ] shown in figure 4 b confirmed that light induces the accumulation of most of the secondary metabolites , especially hydroxycinnamic acids , hydroxybenzoic acids and flavonoids .
unlike hplc - dad , this approach also revealed molecules that were not affected by light or dark conditions , such as sugars , some hydroxycinanmic and hydroxybenzoic acids , and non - aromatic organic acids .
finally , three derivatives of vanillic acid that were not detected by hplc - dad were shown to accumulate specifically in cells grown in the dark .
similar experiments using cells treated under different conditions have been carried out also in basil [ 33 ] and echinacea angustifolia [ 34 ] .
figure 4 a : score scatter plot of r3m carrot suspension cell cultures obtained by opls - da of 218 metabolites quantified by lc - ms. each symbol represents a single chromatography experiment , with cells grown under illumination shown in orange and those grown in the dark shown in blue .
the analysis was carried out using three independent biological replicates for each treatment ( i.e. l1 , l2 , l3 = cells cultivated in the light ; b1 , b2 , b3 = cells cultivated in the dark ) and two independent technical replicates for each biological replicate ( i.e. l1.1 , l1.2 are the technical replicates of biological replicate 1 ) .
b : s - plot of r3m carrot suspension cells cultivated in the light and in the dark , obtained by mapping p against pq ( corr ) in opls - da. each point represents a compound detected and quantified by lc - ms. p is an indicator of the " weight " of each molecule in the model , which directly depends on its abundance ; pq ( corr ) indicates the ability of a compound to distinguish the dark and light samples ( two classes ) .
although the relatively simple and easily controlled environments of plant cells provide useful models , the metabolic profiles of whole plants can be modulated by their environments in a more complex manner .
for example , the same spearmint chemotype ( mentha spicata l. ) was cultivated at four sites in turkey characterized by diverse geographical and climate conditions , resulting in a significant quantitative impact on essential oil composition .
sesquiterpenes accumulated to higher levels in plants growing in warmer areas , whereas monoterpenes accumulated to higher levels in plants growing in temperate regions [ 35 ] .
similarly , the growth of garden thyme ( thymus vulgaris ) , and the qualitative and quantitative profile of its metabolites , was shown to vary across three ecologically - diverse areas in iran [ 36 ] .
4 ) analysis of natural remedies using lc - ms untargeted metabolomics 4.1 ) lc - ms to investigate the composition of medicinal herbs untargeted metabolomics has recently been used to investigate the composition of specific medicinal herbs , which can be composed by one or more herbs or parts of them .
lc - dad / esi - ms / ms was used to determine the metabolic fingerprint of euonymus alatus ( thuhb ) siebold ( eas ) , which is recommended for the prevention of atherosclerosis. by comparing the metabolic profiles of herbs acquired at different locations , the authors found significant regional differences in the abundance of specific major and minor metabolites [ 37 ] .
they also found that different tissues from the same plant ( leaf , fruit , stem , and root ) were qualitatively similar in terms of the metabolic profile but that individual metabolites differed in abundance , suggesting that the metabolomic analysis of different plant tissues could help to determine which is likely to have the most potent medicinal effects [ 37 ] .
lc - esi - ms / ms has also been used to analyze the rhizomes of dysosma versipellis ( hance ) m. cheng , dysosma pleiantha ( hance ) woodson and sinopodophyllum emodi ( wall. ex royle ) ying [ 38 ] .
these plants are commonly called gui - jiu and they contain various lignans , flavonoids and steroids with health - promoting properties but also podophyllotoxin - related lignans which are highly toxic , requiring such herbal products to be carefully controlled .
the authors analyzed 15 constituents in the crude extract of d. versipellis by lc - esi - ms / ms in negative ion mode , and claimed that the combination of esi - ms / ms and lc - esi - ms / ms allowed the rapid and accurate characterization of podophyllotoxin - related glucosides and flavonoid glycosides in the crude extracts , reducing the risk of toxicity cases following the consumption of gui - jiu .
4.2 ) lc - ms for the analysis of complex herbal medicines although untargeted lc - ms analysis has been applied to specific medicinal herbs , many traditional preparations comprise multiple herbs , so the abundance of specific bioactive compounds can vary due to the mixing ratio as well as the effect of different environments on the individual herbal components [ 39 ] .
the high selectivity , sensitivity and versatility of lc - ms analysis makes it ideal also for such complex herbal medicines .
for example , chinese licorice ( gan cao ) is one of the oldest and most popular herbal medicines in the world , derived from the roots of glycyrrhiza uralensis root and present in approximately 60 % of all traditional chinese medicine prescriptions [ 40 , 41 ] .
lc - esi - ms / ms was used to identify licorice flavonoids and saponins in si - jun - zi decoction , which comprises four chinese herbs , including gan cao [ 42 ] .
lc - dad / esi - ms was used to analyze the chinese medicine preparation gan - lu - yin , revealing 14 key compounds including liquiritigenin , liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid from gan cao [ 43 ] .
lc - ms has also been used to analyze phy906 , a modified pharmaceutical preparation of huangqin tang , which is used in traditional chinese medicine to treat diarrhea , nausea and abdominal cramps [ 44 ] .
phy906 comprises four medicinal herbs - scutellaria baicalensis georgi ( s ) , paeonia lactiflora pall .
( p ) , glycyrrhiza uralensis fisch .
( g ) and ziziphus jujuba mill .
( z ) - at a ratio of 3:2:2:2 .
lc - ms identified or tentatively characterized 64 peaks , including flavonoids , triterpene saponins and monoterpene glycosides , all of which could be assigned to the four individual herbs , and some of which were reported for the first time [ 45 ] .
in the future , untargeted metabolomics could be used not only to characterize single herbs and mixtures , but also to integrate data from different experimental platforms , as explained in the concepts of phytomicsqc and herbalome .
the sensitivity and versatility of lc - ms led to the development of the phytomicsqc concept , which combines chemical analysis , bioresponse analysis and animal pharmacology to determine batch - to - batch reproducibility .
this platform integrates molecular fingerprints , quantitative analysis and statistical pattern comparisons for the analysis of natural remedies [ 44 ] .
the herbalome project [ 46 ] aims to globalize traditional chinese medicines by using lc - ms to determine the composition of different products and the structure and function of their components , and establishing a standard resource library to unravel the synergistic and complementary effects of these components on multiple targets .
5 ) summary and outlook recently , plant - based natural remedies have become very popular in western countries , but , unlike the modern drug , their chemical composition is still partially unknown and difficult to determine .
moreover , the chemicals of herbal products can vary from batch to batch since they are largely affected by environmental growth conditions of the original plants and manufacture practices .
in order to assure the safeness of such products , a deeper knowledge on these natural remedies is strongly required .
lc - ms - based untargeted metabolomics is particularly suitable for the analysis of this material .
the presence , amount and structures of plant metabolites can be unraveled by using this approach .
recently , two new initiatives , herbalome project and phytomicsqc , have been launched to improve herbal safeness and to unify traditional chinese medicines with western medicine by using lc - ms untargeted metabolomics for the simultaneous analysis of many compounds in herbal products .

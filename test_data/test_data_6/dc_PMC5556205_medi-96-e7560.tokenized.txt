http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract the clinical significance of tumor markers after radical gastrectomy has not been well characterized .
the purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of early postoperative tumor marker normalization in n3 stage gastric cancer ( gc ) patients .
a total of 259 n3 stage gc patients with preoperatively elevated carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea , > 5 ng / ml ) or carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( ca19 - 9 , > 37 u / ml ) levels underwent radical gastrectomy were analyzed retrospectively .
early postoperative tumor marker response was considered as a normalization of cea or ca19 - 9 levels 4 weeks after surgery .
the disease - free survival ( dfs ) and overall survival ( os ) were analyzed .
n3 stage gc patients were divided into n3a ( n = 157 ) and n3b ( n = 102 ) groups according to the 8th tnm stage system .
early tumor marker response was identified in 96 of 157 n3a patients ( 61.15 %) and 57 of 102 n3b patients ( 55.88 %) .
in n3 stage gc patients with a tumor marker response , significant increase was observed in both dfs ( 25.2 months vs 12.5 months , p < . 001 ) and os ( 32.5 months vs 18.5 months , p < . 001 ) compared with those without tumor marker response .
n3b patients with a tumor marker response showed more favorable dfs ( 19.2 months vs 13.6 months , p = . 019 ) and os ( 25.8 months vs 19.0 months , p = . 013 ) compared with n3a patients lacking a tumor marker response .
multivariate analysis revealed that early tumor marker response was an independent factor for dfs and os in n3 stage gc , as well as for depth of invasion and metastatic lymph node rate ( p < . 05 ) .
early postoperative cea or ca19 - 9 normalization serves as a strong prognostic indicator in n3 stage gc. both n3a and n3b patients with increased early postoperative tumor marker levels showed poor outcomes .
keywords ca19 - 9 carcinoembryonic antigen gastric cancer n3 stage prognosis open - accesstrue 1 introduction gastric cancer ( gc ) , the fourth most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer - related death worldwide , remains one of the lethal diseases globally. [ 1 ] the prognosis of the gc is poor in china due to higher rates of metastasis. [ 2,3 ] nowadays , the tumor - node - metastasis ( tnm ) staging system provides a standard for the classification of the anatomic extent , prediction of prognosis , as well as establishing of treatment regimen .
recently , the latest 8th edition of the american joint commission on cancer ( ajcc ) tnm stage system subclassifies the n3 stage of gc into a n3a ( 7 - 15 regional lymph nodes metastasis ) and a n3b (> 15 regional lymph nodes metastasis ) category .
such subclassification influences the final stages of gc. [ 4 ] carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) and carbohydrate antigen ( ca ) 19 - 9 are the most commonly used markers for the early diagnosis of cancer .
these markers have been used for the prediction of prognosis and recurrences of gc after surgery. [ 5 - 9 ] however , rare studies have been focused on the evaluation of the prognostic significance of serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels within 4 weeks after curative resection .
the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of postoperative serum cea and ca19 - 9 in n3 stage gc patients .
our study provides an auxiliary value for the rationality of the n3 subclassification .
2 patients and methods 2.1 methods a total of 383 gc patients ( n3 stage ) with preoperative elevation of cea (> 5 ng / ml ) or ca19 - 9 (> 37 u / ml ) admitted in the qilu hospital of shandong university from january 2004 to october 2011 were included .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : perioperative mortality , those with incomplete clinical records ( including those lost to follow - up ) , patients receiving palliative surgery , patients subjected to surgery with metastasectomy , and those subjected to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
finally , 259 patients received d2 or d2 + radical gastrectomy were enrolled in this study .
patients were either subclassified as stage n3a ( n = 157 , 60.62 %) or stage n3b ( n = 102 , 39.38 %) according to the 8th ajcc tnm stage system .
serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels were measured preoperatively and at 4 weeks after surgery .
tumor marker response was considered as a normalization of either cea or ca19 - 9 levels 4 weeks after radical gastrectomy and before administration of systemic chemotherapeutic agents .
written informed consent was obtained from each patient .
the study protocols were approved by the ethical committee , qilu hospital of shandong university .
2.2 determination of serum cea and ca19 - 9 peripheral blood sample was collected from each patient .
serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels were measured preoperatively and 4 weeks after surgery , respectively .
the determination was performed using a roche elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer ( roche , penzberg , germany ) using the electrochemiluminescence method .
2.3 follow - up follow - up was conducted 4 weeks after surgery , and then was conducted every 1 to 3 months in the first year , every 3 to 6 months in the next 2 years , and every 6 months thereafter until 5 years postoperatively .
the median duration of follow - up at the cutoff date was 26.5 months ( range = 5.3 - 107.0 months ) .
during the follow up , the patients were required to receive physical examination , determination of serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels , chest radiogram and abdominal ultrasound ( us ) .
diagnostic imaging such as abdominopelvic computer tomography ( ct ) , esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) , or positron emission tomography - ct was performed if necessary .
recurrence was evaluated by clinical symptoms , imaging findings , histological biopsy , or findings at reoperation .
2.4 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using spss 22.0 software .
clinicopathologic features were analyzed using chi - square test .
the median disease - free survival ( dfs ) and overall survival ( os ) were estimated according to the kaplan - meier method , and log - rank test was performed for the comparison .
variables that significantly affected the dfs and os were investigated by multivariate analysis according to the cox regression model .
p < . 05 was considered to be statistically significant .
3 results 3.1 clinicopathologic features clinicopathologic features of 259 patients ( male : 171 ; female : 88 ) of stage n3 are summarized in table 1 .
the median age was 57 years ( 23 - 86 years ) .
based on the 8th ajcc tnm stage system , 157 patients ( 60.62 %) were categorized into n3a stage , while 102 patients ( 39.38 %) were categorized into n3b stage .
early postoperative serum cea or ca19 - 9 normalization was observed in 153 patients ( 59.07 %) .
no significant differences were noticed in the sex , age , n3 subclassification , depth of invasion , tumor size , tumor location , type of surgery , as well as lymph vessel invasion and differentiation between the 2 groups .
patients with no tumor marker response showed metastatic lymph node ratios of >= 0.4 compared with those with tumor marker response ( p = . 025 ) .

3.2 comparison of survival outcomes in patients with or without tumor marker response survival curves of gc patients are depicted in fig. 1 based on the tumor marker response status .
gc patients at n3 stage with a tumor marker response showed favorable outcomes than those lacking of a tumor marker response ( nonresponse ) in terms of dfs ( 25.2 months vs 12.5 months , p < . 001 , fig. 1a ) and os ( 32.5 months vs 18.5 months , p < . 001 , fig. 1b ) .
n3a patients showed significantly higher dfs ( 24.0 months vs 15.5 months , p = . 016 , fig. 2a ) and os ( 29.5 months vs 22.9 months , p = . 022 ; fig. 2b ) than those of n3b patients .
interestingly , the n3b patients with a tumor marker response showed significantly better outcomes than n3a patients lacking a tumor marker response in terms of dfs ( 19.2 months vs 13.6 months , p = . 019 , fig. 3a ) and os ( 25.8 months vs 19.0 months , p = . 013 , fig. 3b ) , respectively .
no statistical differences were noticed in the dfs ( 13.6 months vs 10.8 months , p = . 365 , fig. 3a ) or os ( 19.0 months vs 17.6 months , p = . 697 , fig. 3b ) between patients at n3a and n3b stages lacking a tumor marker response .

3.4 prognosis factors prognostic factors for dfs and os were analyzed using multivariate analysis according to cox regression model .
univariate analysis showed that several factors were risk factors for dfs including tumor marker response ( p < . 001 ) , n3 subclassification ( p = . 016 ) , depth of invasion ( p = . 001 ) , metastatic lymph node rate ( p < . 001 ) , tumor location ( p = . 025 ) , type of surgery ( p = . 002 ) , and lymph vessel invasion ( p = . 047 , table 3 ) .
meanwhile , the risk factors for os were tumor marker response ( p < . 001 ) , n3 subclassification ( p = . 022 ) , depth of invasion ( p = . 001 ) , metastatic lymph node rate ( p < . 001 ) , tumor size ( p = . 011 ) , tumor location ( p = . 034 ) , and type of surgery ( p = . 004 ) .
according to the multivariate analysis , several independent factors for dfs and os were identified including tumor marker responses ( p < . 001 ) , as well as for depth of invasion ( p = . 001 ) and metastatic lymph node rate ( p < . 001 ) .

4 discussion n3 stage gc has been recognized as an advanced malignancy with a poor prognosis , even after radical resection. [ 10 ] the prognosis of gc patients vary greatly even within patients at the same tnm stage. [ 11 ] our study showed that early cea or ca19 - 9 normalization after radical gastrectomy was a prognostic factor for n3 stage gc , which was particularly relevant for patients with high preoperative levels of tumor markers .
n3b patients with tumor marker response showed a better prognosis compared to that of n3a patients lacking tumor marker response .
we assumed that early postoperative cea or ca19 - 9 may reflect the radical extent of surgery in n3 stage gc patients .
several studies demonstrated that elevation of preoperative cea and ca19 - 9 could serve as independent prognostic factors for patients underwent radical surgery. [ 7,12,13 ] nam et al [ 14 ] reported that early postoperative tumor marker levels might be used for the prediction of survival of gc patients .
however , early stage gc patients showed lower recurrence sensitivities of postoperative tumor markers compared with that in advanced gc. [ 15 ] at present , the prognostic impact of tumor markers in n3 stage gc patients remains elusive .
n3 stage gc patients are more likely to show abnormal preoperative tumor marker levels. [ 16 - 18 ] according to our experience , n3 stage gc patients with elevated tumor markers after radical gastrectomy tended to show poor outcomes .
therefore , a precise determination of the prognostic value of tumor markers in n3 stage gc would be of substantial importance in clinical practice .
to our best knowledge , our study firstly reported the prognostic impact of the early postoperative serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels in n3 stage gc patients .
in this study , the prognostic value of the postoperative serum tumor marker response in patients with n3 stage gc was analyzed retrospectively .
postoperative serum cea and ca19 - 9 concentrations were initially measured 4 weeks after surgery to reduce the potential for any confounding effects of adjuvant treatment on postoperative serum tumor markers levels .
according to our results , 106 patients ( 40.93 %) showed aberrant serum cea or ca19 - 9 levels .
n3 stage gc patients in the tumor marker nonresponse group showed lower dfs and os than those in the response group .
tumor markers were expressed in the process of tumorigenesis and progression and may indicate the presence of a neoplasm as well as the relative malignancy burden and aggressive nature of the biological response. [ 19 ] early postoperative nonresponse tumor markers were more likely to be found in patients with higher tumor burdens , and those with the potency for increased prevalence of micrometastases. [ 20 ] in cases of the fact that serum tumor markers failed to get in the normal range within 4 weeks postoperatively , the possibility of an incomplete resection of the primary tumor should be considered with or without the presence of micrometastases. [ 14,21 ] the recurrence rate within 1 year after surgery was significantly higher in nonresponse ( 53.13 %) as compared with response ( 21.43 %) patients .
therefore , as the half - life of cea and ca19 - 9 was short ,[ 22,23 ] we cautiously suggested that an early normalization of tumor markers might reflect the efficiency of radical operation and an elimination of the invasive potential of the cancer .
n3 stage gc patients , particularly those with no tumor marker response at the early stage , should be closely followed up together with administration of intensive chemotherapy .
the extent of lymph node metastasis was considered to be the most important independent prognostic factor for gc. [ 16,24 ] in this study , statistical difference was noticed in the outcomes between n3a and n3b patients , which was also reflected in the tnm stage of the latest 8th ajcc edition. [ 4 ] when n3 patients were stratified into 4 groups based on early postoperative tumor marker status and n3 subclassification , we interestingly found that n3b patients with a tumor marker response showed more favorable outcomes than n3a patients lacking a tumor marker response .
however , for both n3a and n3b patients lacking a tumor marker response , the dfs and os were similar and presented in a decline tendency .
therefore , more attention should be paid to the postoperative management of n3 stage gc patients based on their early postoperative tumor marker status , rather than simple stratification based on the ajcc tnm staging system .
identification of prognostic factors may contribute to the prediction and improvement of outcomes in gc patients .
as an important prognostic factor , depth of tumor invasion is included in the ajcc tnm stage system. [ 25 ] moreover , metastatic lymph ratio has also been reported as a promising prognostic indicator in gc. [ 26,27 ] our study revealed that early tumor marker response , depth of invasion , and metastatic lymph node ratio were the independent prognostic factors for dfs and os according to multivariate analysis .
therefore , these factors can serve as useful parameters to predicate the prognosis of n3 stage gc patients after radical gastrectomy .
indeed , there are limitations in our study .
firstly , our study was retrospective with a relatively small sample size .
secondly , we only assessed 2 markers in our analysis while ca72 - 4 that was considered as a useful follow - up tumor marker after gastrectomy was not included .
finally , it is not possible to apply our results to all stages of gc patients as it is still a challenge to identify the presence of high levels of preoperative tumor markers in early stage gc patients .
5 conclusions in conclusion , early postoperative serum tumor marker responses can serve as a strong prognostic indicator for n3 stage gc. early postoperative serum cea and ca19 - 9 levels may contribute to the prediction of prognosis , which can better reflect the status of the curative resection .
during the postoperative follow - up , careful attention should be paid to n3 stage gc patients based on their postoperative tumor marker levels , rather than simply stratifying patients based on the ajcc tnm staging system .
meanwhile , n3a and n3b patients with elevation of early postoperative tumor marker levels should be closely followed up together with administration of intensive chemotherapy .

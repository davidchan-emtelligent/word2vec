electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy is a well - established spectroscopic method for the examination of paramagnetic molecules .
proteins can contain paramagnetic moieties in form of stable cofactors , transiently formed intermediates , or spin labels artificially introduced to cysteine sites .
the focus of this review is to evaluate potential scopes of application of epr to the emerging field of optogenetics .
the main objective for epr spectroscopy in this context is to unravel the complex mechanisms of light - active proteins , from their primary photoreaction to downstream signal transduction .
an overview of recent results from the family of flavin - containing , blue - light dependent photoreceptors is given .
in detail , mechanistic similarities and differences are condensed from the three classes of flavoproteins , the cryptochromes , lov ( light - oxygen - voltage ) , and bluf ( blue - light using fad ) domains .
additionally , a concept that includes spin - labeled proteins and examination using modern pulsed epr is introduced , which allows for a precise mapping of light - induced conformational changes .
photoreceptor epr spectroscopy distance determination radicals flavoproteins deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft10.13039 / 501100001659rtg1976 , project p13 introduction electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy is a well - established spectroscopic method for the examination of the global as well as the local structure of paramagnetic molecules .
although only a minority of proteins is intrinsically paramagnetic , numerous proteins contain paramagnetic molecules in form of stable cofactors ( e.g. , organic molecules , transition - metal ions , or transition - metal clusters ) ( jeschke , 2005 ) .
in addition , paramagnetic states can be generated transiently during the course of a reaction of a protein .
in such a case , cofactor , amino acid and / or substrate radicals can be generated and thus characterized ( frey et al. , 2006 ) .
last , artificial paramagnetic labels ( spin labels ) can be attached to a specific site of the protein of interest .
among others , small and metastable nitroxide spin labels are commonly used , which can be covalently bound to cysteine residues ( klare and steinhoff , 2009 ; jeschke , 2012 ) .
as a consequence , cysteines ( and afterwards radicals ) can be introduced to virtually any position of interest ( commonly named as site - directed spin labeling , sdsl ) with the help of established molecular - biology techniques ( berliner et al. , 2000 ; hubbell et al. , 2000 ; fanucci and cafiso , 2006 ) .
epr spectroscopy is not only helpful to characterize stable paramagnetic states , but is extremely powerful to analyze radical intermediates , which often occur in electron - transfer reactions .
here , epr methods have one advantage as compared to other methods such as nmr : protein - size restrictions do not apply to epr because the detection of epr is limited to the paramagnetic molecule itself and only those parts of a biomolecule that directly interact with it. as a non - invasive or minimally invasive method , epr allows for the investigation of such systems in a functional state or even under in - cell conditions ( berliner , 2010 ; hansel et al. , 2014 ) .
during the last decade , electron - electron double resonance ( deer or peldor ) spectroscopy , a modern pulsed epr method , became increasingly popular ( jeschke , 2002 , 2012 ; schiemann and prisner , 2007 ; reginsson and schiemann , 2011 ; hubbell et al. , 2013 ) .
here , the strength of the dipolar coupling between two radicals is determined , and from that , the distance between two radicals may be obtained with high accuracy .
when combining this method with the aforementioned sdsl , distances ( and even orientations ) between any position in a protein may be obtained , which makes eldor spectroscopy similarly powerful as established methods , such as forster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) spectroscopy .
the focus of this review is to evaluate potential scopes of application of epr to the emerging field of optogenetics - - the genetic encoding of light - sensitive proteins that activate signaling pathways in response to light .
the main objective for molecular spectroscopy in this context is to unravel the complex mechanisms of light - active proteins ( photoreceptors ) , from their primary photoreaction to downstream signal transduction .
in principle , the mechanism of photoreceptors can be separated into three parts : ( i ) the response of the chromophore immediately after light excitation , ( ii ) signal propagation from the chromophore to the signaling domain ( or very crudely expressed : from the center of the protein to its surface ) , and ( iii ) activation of the signaling domain .
the time scales of these processes range from picoseconds for the first process down to ( milli ) seconds for the subsequent ones ; therefore , various spectroscopic techniques are necessary to disentangle the entire mechanism .
only if all these facts are at hand , rational decisions can be made , which photoreceptor to choose for an optogenetic study , and more importantly , how the respective light - responsive proteins may be genetically encoded .
up to now , in most cases , small libraries of fusion variants with several tens of members were prepared and screened manually for optimized response ( moglich and moffat , 2010 ) .
additionally , many of these constructs show only partially activation / deactivation upon illumination , and thus , could be further optimized .
although various other photoreceptors , in particular rhodopsins have been investigated using epr spectroscopy ( van eps et al. , 2015 ) , and have been successfully implemented as optogenetic transponders ( zhang et al. , 2011 ) , this review is focused to provide an overview of recent results from epr spectroscopy on flavin - containing photoreceptors .
the three up to now characterized flavin - based receptor classes can in principle be further divided into the large (~ 60 kda ) cryptochrome / photolyase ( cry / pl ) class , and the small (~ 20 kda ) modular lov ( light - oxygen - voltage ) and bluf ( blue - light using fad ) domains. from the very beginning , flavin - containing photoreceptors have been identified as important tools for optogenetics , and several applications have been published to date ( e.g. , wu et al. , 2009 ; kennedy et al. , 2010 ; moglich and moffat , 2010 ; christie et al. , 2012 ) .
one should keep in mind that since their discovery , molecular spectroscopy of all flavors has been applied to these proteins ( a number of recent reviews excellently summarize the results , e.g. , chaves et al. , 2011 ; zoltowski and gardner , 2011 ; losi and gartner , 2012 ) , but only bringing the results of the application of various techniques together resulted in the wealth of knowledge on their ( photo ) chemistry that we have accumulated up to now .
introduction to selected epr techniques it is beyond the aim of this review to comprehensively introduce the theory and all practical aspects of epr spectroscopy ; for this purpose , the reader is referred to a number of excellent and in - depth reviews and books ( e.g. , weil et al. , 1994 ; schweiger and jeschke , 2001 ; jeschke , 2005 ) .
however , we would like to present a few special epr techniques that have been proven very helpful when working with light - active flavoproteins .
specifically , continuous - wave epr ( cwepr ) is commonly applied for a first more rough characterization of a stable paramagnetic species ; for a more detailed characterization of the local structure of a radical , advanced methods , such as pulsed electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) spectroscopy , are preferably applied .
for the characterization of meta - stable paramagnetic intermediates , transient epr ( trepr ) with its high time resolution is for sure the method of choice .
steady - state epr spectroscopy cwepr spectroscopy is typically used to determine the g - tensor and large anisotropic hyperfine couplings ( hfcs ) of a stable paramagnetic species .
in addition to the in general fast and technically simple measurement , one further advantage of cwepr originates from the so - called lock - in detection .
here , a modulation of the magnetic - field strength with high frequency is applied , and a subsequent detection of the epr signal at the same modulation frequency results in a significantly increased signal - to - noise ratio .
the downside of this technique is its limitation in time resolution , which is restricted to time scale of several tens or hundreds of microseconds when the most common modulation frequency of 100 khz is applied .
while the isotropic g - value of an organic radical can be easily measured at x - band microwave ( mw ) frequencies , the full resolutions of the g - tensor 's anisotropy and hyperfine coupling ( hfc ) parameters typically require high mw frequencies , at least the commercially available q - and w - band frequencies .
figure 1 ( left panel ) shows a very high - magnetic - field cwepr spectrum of xenopus laevis ( 6 - 4 ) photolyase with its protonated fadh * cofactor ( dashed line ) .
a least - squares best fit ( drawn line ) of the experimental data revealed the g - tensor principal values and some components of the anisotropic hfcs of n ( 5 ) , n ( 10 ) , and h ( 5 ) .
the spectrum was recorded with a laboratory - built epr spectrometer operating at 360 ghz ( schnegg et al. , 2006 ) because with lower ( commercially available ) mw frequencies it is impossible to fully resolve the g - tensor principal components of flavin radicals ( schleicher and weber , 2012 ) .
due to the very high magnetic field of 12.8 t , not only the g - tensor is fully resolved , but even a splitting of the gy - component of the g - tensor is observed .
it originates from the projection of the h ( 5 ) hfc component ay onto the y principal axis of g. figure 1 ( a ) cwepr spectrum of xenopus laevis ( 6 - 4 ) photolyase recorded at 360 ghz .
the experimental spectrum and its spectral simulation are depicted as dashed and solid lines , respectively .
in addition to the well resolved principal values of the g - tensor , a splitting on the gy component of the spectrum can be observed , which is due to the projection of the h ( 5 ) hfc component ay onto the y principal axis of g. signals arising from magnetic - field calibration are labeled by asterisks (*) .

( 2010 ) .
pulsed ( davies - type ) endor spectroscopy ( for in - depth reviews , see e.g. , prisner et al. , 2001 ; murphy and farley , 2006 ) reveals hfcs of a sample by inducing nmr transitions within a paramagnetic species and surrounding hyperfine - coupled nuclei and detecting them via epr .
for this purpose , the epr spectrometer is equipped with a radio - frequency ( rf ) source and amplifier .
in comparison to cwepr , a static magnetic field is applied ; its optimal value has to be determined in advance .
the davies - endor pulse sequence ( see scheme 1 ) then starts with a 180degrees ( i.e. , pi ) mw pulse to invert the magnetization of the electron - spin system , thus generating an " inverted " spin system , in which nmr transitions can be induced by application of a 180degrees ( i.e. , pi ) rf pulse of varying frequency following the mw pulse .
in case of resonance , the rf pulse will again invert the magnetization , thus reducing the net magnetization .
the pulse sequence is finished by a standard hahn echo ( pi / 2 - pi ) sequence .
the final spectrum shows the inverted echo intensity as function of the radio frequency .
this allows a direct readout of the type of coupling nucleus by its nuclear larmor frequency .
some limitation of this technique is due to the relaxation time of the electron - spin system , which has to be long enough to apply the rf pulse that is relatively long as compared to the mw pulses ; however , this is only a minor problem when working with organic radicals .
scheme 1 the davies - endor pulse sequence .
importantly , hfcs are , via the electron - spin density , quite sensitive to changes in their environment , and thus , altered hfcs can be used to gain structural information on the close surroundings of a paramagnetic molecule .
in general , hfcs of a particular nucleus can be directly read out from endor spectra as pairs of resonance lines that are , according to the condition nuendor = | nun +/ - a / 2 | , either equally spaced about the magnetic - field dependent nuclear larmor frequency nun and separated by the hfc constant a ( for the case nun > | a / 2 |) , or centered around a / 2 and separated by 2nun ( for nun < | a / 2 |) .
a typical proton endor spectrum of a flavin radical at x - band microwave frequency can be divided into five parts : ( 1 ) the strong central matrix - endor signal reaching from around 13 - 16 mhz , originating from weakly coupled protons like backbone or water protons close to the flavin , or those directly attached to the isoalloxazine ring , namely h ( 3 ) , h ( 7alpha ) and h ( 9 ) .
( 2 ) flanking the matrix - endor signal couplings at around 12 and 17 mhz that are assigned to the proton h ( 6 ) can be observed .
( 3 ) the most intensive features in a flavin radical endor spectrum arise from the protons of the methyl group at c ( 8 ) , which can be detected at 10 - 12 mhz and 17 - 19 mhz .
( 4 ) in most published spectra , one of the two beta - protons attached to c ( 1 ') of the ribityl side chain is visible as small shoulders at 9 - 10 and 19 - 20 mhz ( schleicher et al. , 2010 ) .
( 5 ) in the neutral protonated state of the flavin radical , a broad rhombic feature can be observed reaching from 20 up to 34 mhz , which is assigned to the proton attached to n ( 5 ) .
two exemplary proton endor spectra , one originating from the fadh * of synechocystis sp. cry dash , and the other from the fad * - of drosophila melanogaster cry , are shown in the right panel of figure 1 .
as a first result , the protonation state of the flavin radical can be directly read out of the respective endor spectrum : depending on the presence or absence of a broad signal between 20 and 34 mhz originating from h ( 5 ) , deprotonated anionic or protonated neutral flavin radical states , respectively , can be easily distinguished .
additionally , significantly different proton hfcs [ in particular h ( 8alpha ) and h ( 6 )] can be observed upon transforming the anionic fad * - into the neutral fadh * radical .
this is because protonation at n ( 5 ) results in a significant redistribution of the unpaired electron - spin density from the less polar xylene ring of the isoalloxazine moiety toward the pyrazine and pyrimidine rings .
in sum , proton endor spectroscopy allows for an easy discrimination between the two protonation states , and gives access to the molecular wave function of a paramagnetic molecule via the determination of electron - spin densities ( that are directly related to the respective hfcs ) .
transient epr spectroscopy short - lived paramagnetic intermediates , such as triplet states or radical pairs ( rp ) generated in the course of photo - chemical reactions , can be favorably studied by measuring the epr signal intensity as a function of time at a fixed magnetic field ( stehlik and mobius , 1997 ; bittl and weber , 2005 ; van der est , 2009 ) .
typically , the best - possible time response of a commercial epr spectrometer is in the order of about 20 mus ( see chapter " steady - state epr spectroscopy "). by removing the magnetic - field modulation , the time resolution can be pushed into the 10 - 8 - 10 - 9 s range presupposed a suitably fast data acquisition system is present to directly record the transient epr signal amplitude as a function of time .
in transient epr spectroscopy ( trepr ) , paramagnetic species are generated by a nanosecond laser flash , which also serves as a trigger signal .
spectral information can be obtained from a series of trepr signals recorded at various magnetic - field points , thus yielding a two - dimensional variation of the signal intensity with respect to both the magnetic field and the time .
similar to e.g. , transient absorption spectroscopy , trepr spectra can be extracted at any fixed time after the laser pulse as slices parallel to the magnetic - field axis .
in figure 2a , the one - dimensional representation of the trepr signal from the photo - generated triplet state of fmn is shown ( kowalczyk et al. , 2004 ; schleicher et al. , 2004 ) .
due to signal detection in the absence of any source modulation , the sign of the resonances directly reflects the emissive ( e ) or enhanced absorptive ( a ) spin polarization of the epr transitions , which arises due to the generation of the electron - spin state with an initial non - equilibrium energy - level population ( turro et al. , 2000 ; woodward , 2002 ; hirota and yamauchi , 2003 ) .
the spectral width of the signal reflects the strong mutual interaction of the unpaired electron spins in the triplet configuration .
because they are both localized on the same molecule ( in this example on the isoalloxazine moiety of fmn ) , the spin - spin interactions are strong and hence , trepr spectra of flavin triplet states are rather broad ( kowalczyk et al. , 2004 ) .
the weak transition at low magnetic fields arises from the only weakly allowed " deltams = +/ - 2 " - transition .

( 2004 ) .
the weak transition at ~ 170 mt originates from the " deltams = +/ - 2 " - transition .
( b ) trepr spectrum of a photogenerated rp comprising a flavin and a tryptophan radical , measured at 274 k ( biskup et al. , 2009 ) .
in rps , the average distance between the two unpaired electron spins is typically much larger .
hence , trepr - spectra of photo - generated ( and electron - spin polarized ) rp states are narrower due to the reduced mutual dipolar and exchange interactions as compared to flavin triplet states ( schleicher et al. , 2009 ) .
in figure 2b , the trepr signal of a flavin - tryptophan - based rp with a distance of ~ 20 a is depicted .
the drastic influence of the strength of electron - electron interactions on the width of the spectra is obvious .
analysis of the spectral shapes of trepr - signals yields information on the chemical nature of the individual radicals composing the rp , and their interaction with each other and with their immediate surroundings .
spectral simulations based on the correlated - coupled rp mechanism are typically performed ; these are outlined in more detail elsewhere ( closs et al. , 1987 ; hore , 1989 ; kothe et al. , 1991 ; van der est , 2009 ) .
briefly , the signal of a single pair of coupled radicals consists of four resonance lines arranged in two antiphase doublets , each centered at the resonance magnetic - field position of the individual radical , respectively .
the spacing between the lines within the antiphase signals is determined by the exchange and / or dipolar interactions .
each line pair may be further split by hyperfine interactions .
in non - oriented frozen samples , interaction anisotropies will contribute to an inhomogeneous spectral broadening of some or all transitions .
state of the art : intermediates in flavin - dependent photoreceptors probed by modern epr spectroscopy cryptochromes crys are blue - light photoreceptors with a wide range of regulatory functions in plants , animals and microorganisms .
they are closely related to photolyases ( pls ) , with tight homologies in amino - acid sequence and spatial structure ( essen , 2006 ; muller and carell , 2009 ) .
pls catalyze the light - driven , enzymatic cleavage of certain uv - induced lesions in dna ( sancar , 2004 ; weber , 2005 ; essen and klar , 2006 ) .
except in mammals , pls are very common in all three kingdoms of life ( essen and klar , 2006 ) .
both proteins use a flavin adenosin dinucleotide ( fad ) as their primary redox - active chromophore / cofactor that is non - covalently bound in a cavity of the protein ( moglich et al. , 2010 ; chaves et al. , 2011 ; losi and gartner , 2012 ) .
some of the characterized proteins carry an additional chromophore for light harvesting .
in pls , these second chromophores range from methenyltetrahydrofolate ( essen and klar , 2006 ; klar et al. , 2006 ; muller and carell , 2009 ) via flavin derivatives to recently identified ribolumazine ( geisselbrecht et al. , 2012 ; zhang et al. , 2013 ) ; however , the relevance for cry photochemistry and function is still under debate ( selby and sancar , 2012 ) .
crys can function as classical photoreceptors or work as light - independent transcription factors ( lin and todo , 2005 ) .
examples are flower development and the entrainment of the circadian rhythm ( guo et al. , 1998 ; van der horst et al. , 1999 ; chaves et al. , 2011 ) .
crys have also been suggested to play a major role in the magnetic orientation system of migratory birds , fruit flies and other animals ( gegear et al. , 2008 ; hore , 2012 ) .
both classes of proteins show similarities in their basic structure , which are divided into an n - terminal domain and a c - terminal chromophore - binding domain where the fad binding site is located .
additionally , crys contain an extended c - terminal region , the so - called c - terminal tail ( ctt ) .
its length is rather variable ; usually it is longer in plant crys than in animal crys , and it is supposedly involved in signal transduction .
in the recently solved full - length structure of fruit fly cry , the ctt forms an alpha - helix which occupies the fad access cavity , at which the dna lesion binds in pls ( czarna et al. , 2013 ) .
after light excitation , pls are able to engage in two light - dependent reactions : if the fad cofactor is in its fully reduced fadh - state , an electron can be transferred to the dna lesion , which results in splitting of the damaged dna .
subsequent electron transfer back to the fad renders this reaction net - zero with respect to the number of exchanged electrons .
on the other hand , pls and crys are able to react in the so - called photoreduction reaction : if the fad is not in its fully reduced fadh - state , electrons can be transferred from the surface of the protein to the fad by receiving an electron from a proximal tryptophan .
trp306 ( e. coli pl numbering ) , which is located at the surface of the protein and is about 20 a apart from the fad , was first identified via a point - mutational study ( li et al. , 1991 ) .
this distance is too large for an efficient direct electron transfer , and soon thereafter , two additional tryptophans ( trp359 and trp382 ) were discovered as part of the so called " tryptophan triad " ( trp - triad ) ( li et al. , 1991 ) .
this triad represents a highly conserved electron - transport chain , which can be found in almost all members of the cry / pl family .
after the first electron transfer step , the electron hole is transported via well - defined intermediates from the proximal tryptophan to the surface - exposed ( terminal ) tryptophan , which in turn results in a transiently formed rp between the fad and the terminal tryptophan .
this intermediate state could either recombine back to the ground state , or is further stabilized via a subsequent deprotonation of the tryptophanyl cation radical involving solvent water molecules to form a neutral tryptophanyl radical ( aubert et al. , 2000 ) .
the life time of the secondary rp comprising of fad * - ( or fadh * - in case of plant crys and pls ) and trp * is significantly prolonged up to the millisecond range .
if the neutral tryptophanyl radical is reduced by an external electron donor , then the fad remains in a one - electron reduced state. by substitution mutations it could be shown that both the surface - exposed tryptophan as well as the two bridging tryptophans are crucial for photoreduction ability .
in pls , however , the relevance of this intraprotein reaction for physiological dna repair has been questioned ( kavakli and sancar , 2004 ) .
despite the ctt region , cry and pl structures are highly homologous , and although both harbor fad as their redox - active chromophore , it seems that crys lost their ability to repair dna damages .
earlier studies pointed out that the resting state in vivo in pls is the fully reduced fadh - ( payne et al. , 1987 ) .
to elucidate if the in vivo redox state is different in crys , insect cells overexpressing various crys were measured in the dark and after blue - light illumination using uv - vis and epr spectroscopy .
oxidized fad can in principle be detected in cells by fluorescence spectroscopy ( by monitoring the emission at 525 nm , galland and tolle , 2003 ) or by uv - vis spectroscopy ( by monitoring the absorbance at ~ 450 nm ) .
it could be shown that a light induced absorbance change matching the reduction of oxidized fad occurs after a few minutes of blue - light illumination .
the drawbacks of these optical methods are that ( i ) direct concentration measurements of the illuminated fad states are not possible , and ( ii ) large experimental uncertainties arise from the intrinsic absorbance ( and / or fluorescence ) of cells .
on the other hand , the use of epr spectroscopy enabled direct measurements of the formation of the semiquinone radicals in living cells .
specifically , dark - grown intact cells overexpressing various crys were illuminated for defined time intervals with blue light , and were subsequently shock - frozen in liquid nitrogen ( banerjee et al. , 2007 ; bouly et al. , 2007 ; hoang et al. , 2008 ) .
the increase of an organic radical signal could be detected after a few minutes of illumination ; control cells did not show any radical signal .
furthermore , a decrease of the signal back to a complete decay could be measured after dark incubation of the samples overnight ( engelhard et al. , 2014 ) .
to further characterize the detected radical signatures , and to assign the signal to a specific molecule , ( davis ) endor was applied at 80 k. clearly , resonances could be obtained that are highly similar to those of purified protein - bound fad * - and fadh * radicals found in plant and animal cryptochromes , respectively. with these results at hand , a novel mechanism of plant and animal crys could be proposed : in contrast to pls , crys are activated via photoreduction of fad starting from the oxidized fad state ( banerjee et al. , 2007 ; bouly et al. , 2007 ; hoang et al. , 2008 ) .
the formation of the fully - reduced fadh - state is strongly inhibited .
as a next logical step , the intermediate rps that appear during the photoreduction reaction have been investigated in more detail .
to this end , a trepr study of wild - type cry dash of x. laevis ( xcry ) was conducted to shed light on light - induced paramagnetic intermediates ( biskup et al. , 2009 ) .
the obtained spectrum of wild - type xcry resembles those published previously from trepr on light - induced short - lived rp species in fad photoreduction of pls ( weber et al. , 2002 ; weber , 2005 ) .
the origin of the rp signature in xcry could be unraveled by examination of a point mutant , trp324phe , which lacks the terminal tryptophan ( equivalent to trp306 in e. coli cpd photolyase ) of the conserved electron - transfer cascade .
this mutant did not show any trepr signal .
the conclusion , that trp324 is indeed the terminal electron donor in electron - transfer reaction in xcry was further supported by spectral simulations , which have been performed on the basis of the correlated coupled rp model .
the calculations were performed using published g - tensor parameters for fad and tryptophan neutral radicals .
the relative orientations of the principal axes of both g - tensors and the dipole - dipole coupling tensor were taken from a xcry homology model and kept fixed ( biskup et al. , 2009 ) .
after assigning the trepr signal of the wt to the rp [ fad. .
trp324 ] , the role of the first two tryptophans of the triad , namely trp377 and trp400 was explored in more detail ( biskup et al. , 2013 ) .
for this purpose , two additional mutants , trp377phe and trp400phe , were produced and examined under otherwise identical experimental conditions .
in contrast to the trp324phe sample , trepr signals could be - - most unexpectedly - - observed in both mutants .
at first glance , the obtained trepr signal patterns are similar to the ones from the wt ; however , slight differences could be detected upon closer inspection : most importantly , the signals are shifted toward lower magnetic field , which corresponds to at least one paramagnetic species with g - tensor components larger than those of a tryptophan radical ( biskup et al. , 2013 ) .
published redox potentials and g - values lead to the conclusion that tyrosine is the only amino acid that is able to form such a rp ( bleifuss et al. , 2001 ) .
a closer inspection of the xcry structural model revealed two tyrosines , namely tyr50 and tyr397 to be ideal candidates to form a bridge between the fad and the protein surface .
in addition , these tyrosines are close to the trp - triad and thus , are able to serve as a backup and function as an alternative electron transfer pathway .
the assignment of the trepr signals from the xcry trp377phe and trp400phe mutants was again corroborated by spectral simulations , in which identical parameters as of the wt were used ( biskup et al. , 2013 ) .
only the g - tensor adjusted to be compatible with a tyrosine radical instead of a tryptophan radical .
the resulting simulations showed signals shifted to lower magnetic fields , thus confirming a [ tyr ... fad ] rp species .
another experimental way to prove this alternative electron transfer path was to investigate a tyr50phe / trp400phe double mutant , in which tyrosine and tryptophan were replaced by the redox - inert phenylalanine .
its weak trepr signal was again shifted toward a higher magnetic field that closely resembles the wt signal , thus indicating a rp between trp324 and the fad .
in 2011 , biskup et al. expanded the concept of the highly conserved trp - triad being the only electron - transfer pathway in the cry / pl family even further ( biskup et al. , 2011 ) .
figure 3 depicts results from a trepr study of wild - type and point - mutated cry dash protein from synechocystis sp .
( scry ) .
here , an alternative et pathway was revealed because a point mutation of the terminal tryptophan ( trp320phe ) showed the same trepr spectrum as compared to the wt protein .
an investigation of the protein structure identified an alternative tryptophan ( trp375 ) that could function as terminal electron donor .
however , with 8.2 a between trp375 and the middle tryptophan ( trp373 ) , the alternative terminal trp ' is nearly 5 a further apart from trp373 as the " expected " conserved terminal trp .
to probe this suggestion a second point mutant , trp375phe , was produced .
no trepr could be recorded , even with the conserved trp - triad being fully intact , thus indicating that in scry an alternative pathway for electron transfer is used .
the spectral evidence is supported by calculations based on marcus' theory of charge transfer ( krapf et al. , 2012 ) .
here the change in gibb 's free enthalpy for moving a positive charge along the conserved ( deltag = - 62 kj / mol ) and alternative ( deltag = - 81 kj / mol ) pathways were computed , showing that the stabilization energy is about 20 kj / mol higher for the alternative trp ' .
this demonstrates that distance is not necessarily the decisive parameter to determine the electron - transfer pathways in crys and pls , but solvent accessibility , and the stabilization of the charge - separated states , as well as the relative orientation of the involved molecules contribute substantially .

( 2011 ). with the new results from the last years , the picture of a rp being formed upon photoexcitation in crys seems to be widely proven .
but different from the early expectations the conserved trp - triad is not the only pathway for electrons from the protein surface to the fad chromophore .
different paths and also different types of amino acids can be used for electron transfer , even with the classic trp - triad being fully intact .
why different types of crys use different routes for the electrons is a question , which needs to be answered in the future .
lov domains first discovered as tandem sensor domains in the plant photoreceptor phototropin ( christie et al. , 1998 ) , " light - oxygen - voltage " ( lov ) domains have since been found in several plant , fungal , and bacterial proteins ( christie , 2007 ) .
lov domains constitute a subclass of the per - arnt - sim ( pas ) family whose members serve as versatile sensor and interaction domains in diverse signaling proteins ( moglich et al. , 2009 ) ; their identified responses range from phototropism ( briggs , 2007 ) via entrainment of the circadian clock ( kim et al. , 2007 ) to regulation of morphogenesis ( moglich et al. , 2010 ) .
the first structure of a lov domain was that of the lov2 domain of adiantum capillus - veneris phototropin ( crosson and moffat , 2001 , 2002 ) , and it confirmed the canonical pas fold .
residues involved in fmn coordination and the photoreaction are largely conserved and define the flavin - binding pocket ( krauss et al. , 2009 ) .
lov domains are distinguished from other flavoproteins by their characteristic photochemistry .
after absorption of a photon in the blue spectral region by the dark - adapted lov - 450 state , the fmn cofactor undergoes efficient intersystem crossing within nanoseconds to yield a lov - 700 intermediate state with fmn in its triplet state ( swartz et al. , 2001 ; kennis et al. , 2003 ) .
within microseconds a covalent thioether bond between atom c ( 4a ) of the flavin ring and a conserved nearby cysteine residue is formed ( a so - called cysteinyl - 4a - adduct ) , the lov - 390 state ( salomon et al. , 2000 , 2001 ) .
the photoreaction is fully reversible , and the signaling state thermally reverts to the ground ( dark ) state .
in principle , adduct formation can occur via three different molecular mechanisms : a concerted mechanism , an ionic mechanism following initial protonation of the excited 3fmn triplet state , and a rp mechanism .
to elucidate which leads to adduct formation , we designed a trepr and optical study with various lov domains at low - temperature : triplet states of lov domains were measured and compared to triplet states of flavins in solution ( kowalczyk et al. , 2004 ; schleicher et al. , 2004 ) .
specific protein - cofactor interactions that alter the electronic structure of lov1 and lov2 domains could be identified .
in detail , a phenylalanine residue , which is highly conserved in lov1 domains , alters the triplet - wavefunction ( in particular the triplet " delocalization parameter " | d |) and is supposed to change the yield of adduct formation .
moreover , results from optical measurements clearly confirmed that adduct formation is possible at low temperatures , but the absorption spectra showed distinct changes as compared to spectra from frozen lov domains with cysteinyl - 4a - adduct .
additional triplet spectra were recorded at different ph values ( in particular ph 2.8 , which is well below the pka of 4.4 for the protonation of 3fmn , schreiner et al. , 1975 ) , both with fmn in aqueous solution and bound to lov domains .
if a protonation of the fmn triplet would have occurred in the lov domains prior to adduct formation at 77 k , then the resulting 3fmnh + would have been visible in the trepr spectra , and could easily be distinguished from 3fmn by its zero - field splitting parameters | d | and | e | , and also by its triplet relaxation time ( kowalczyk et al. , 2004 ) .
trepr experiments on protein - bound fmn and in frozen aqueous solution confirmed that proton transfer to 3fmn does not occur at 77 k , which rules out the presence of 3fmnh + as an intermediate at 77 k. these findings clearly demonstrated that adduct formation via an ionic mechanism can be excluded under these experimental conditions .
another possibility is that the thioadduct is formed via a concerted mechanism , directly from the triplet state. by the principle of conservation of angular momentum , however , the photoproduct is expected to be also formed in a triplet - spin configuration , and thus , should be detectable by trepr ; however , no such paramagnetic species was observed .
this could be due to the fact that the triplet of the adduct species is hidden under the backdrop of an excess of triplets from unreacted lov domains .
it should be pointed out , however , that the triplet - state energy of the photoadduct is expected to be very high due to the formation of an sp3 - hybridized c ( 4a ) from a formerly delocalized , and hence , stabilized pi - electron system of the isoalloxazine ring .
therefore , we consider a concerted mechanism via such a transition state rather unlikely .
the only remaining plausible mechanism is the rp mechanism : after electron transfer from the functional cysteine to 3fmn , a very short - lived and yet uncharacterized rp species is generated , which instantly forms a covalent bond after rapid triplet - to - singlet conversion .
the generated protonated cysteinyl - 4a - adduct deprotonates ( an process inhibited at low temperature ) , and the signaling state is formed .
despite closely similar sequence and almost identical structure , individual lov domains differ markedly in their kinetics and quantum yields of the photocycles .
notably , dark - recovery times between a few seconds up to hours have been recorded ( kasahara et al. , 2002 ; zoltowski et al. , 2009 ) .
one approach for understanding these phenomena is to assume that minor changes in the cofactor environment lead to subtle changes in protein conformation , which in turn could alter the stability of the carbon - sulfur bond , and thus , modulate the reaction speed of the deltag - driven c - s bond splitting .
a number of examples in the literature show significant modulation of adduct formation / bond breaking via point mutations at various sites of the phototropin protein ( christie et al. , 2007 ; jones et al. , 2007 ; raffelberg et al. , 2011 , 2013 ) .
therefore , these findings support the idea that minute changes in lov domains can lead to significant changes in their reactivity .
for a profound understanding of this unique photochemical reaction , information on the hydrogen - bonding situation and the close environment of the photo - labile center is crucial .
for this purpose , a study has been designed where parts of the micro - environment in the close vicinity of the flavin cofactor of a lov domain was altered and , via endor spectroscopy , the influence on the protein 's reactivity was elucidated ( brosi et al. , 2010 ) .
resolving the micro - environment of cofactors in proteins and its influence on biological function is difficult as most of these structural changes are far beyond the typical resolution of protein x - ray crystallography : to increase structural information extractable from experimental data , its temperature dependence needs also to be taken into account. from these data , the internal energy of the system , and hence , the strength of interaction between the cofactor and its surrounding can be estimated .
for this purpose , site - directed mutagenesis of lov domains where the reactive cysteine residue is exchanged with either alanine or serine , were devised .
this prevents the formation of the c4a adduct and instead leads to a meta - stable fmnh * , which has been identified to serve as a reaction intermediate analog .
in detail , it was possible to detect a unique spectral behavior of avena sativa lov2 ( aslov2 ) c450a samples as their 8alpha methyl - group rotational motion is slowed down starting at already rather elevated temperatures ( t < 110 k ) ( brosi et al. , 2010 ) .
to identify responsible amino acids for altered protein - cofactor interaction , an extended mutagenesis study has been performed with modifications introduced to in the direct vicinity of the 8alpha methyl - group , where three amino acids , namely leu496 , phe509 , and asn425 , are located ( see figure 4 ) .
mutations in these three amino acids clearly showed changed temperature behavior , which is in line with the predicted altered sterical interaction ( see figure 4 , left panel ) .
moreover , the hfcs from the three arrested 8alpha protons shift as depending on the individual mutants ( see figure 4 , right panel ) .
spectral assignment of these hfc tensors in combination with dft calculations resulted in the precise determination of the orientation of the methyl group with respect to the isoalloxazine ring plane .

left : spectra were recorded at 120 k ( dashed lines ) , 80 k ( black lines ) , and 10 k ( gray shaded ) for all samples .
right : sections of aslov2 10 - k spectra with accompanying spectral simulation of the outer wing of the spectrum ( measured spectrum , dashed lines ; single simulated hfcs , shades of blue , green , and red ; envelope of simulated hfcs , black lines ) .
two protein samples , aslov2 c450a / f509a and aslov2 c450a / n425c , require another hyperfine component of axial symmetry for accurate spectral fitting .
this feature represents hfcs from fast rotating 8alpha methyl group protons , is shown in purple and is denoted as h8alphaiso .
finally , as an important link between molecular spectroscopy and protein photochemistry , asn425 was identified as a central amino acid for the photochemistry of lov domains ( brosi et al. , 2010 ) .
kinetic measurements demonstrated that the aslov2 asn425cys sample has a seven - fold shorter adduct - state life time as compared to aslov2 wt. this is most likely due to altered asn425 - fmn interaction , which in the end destabilizes the intrinsically weak c - s bond of the cysteinyl - 4a - adduct .
this type of study was recently repeated with an engineered lov photoreceptor yf1 using optical and epr spectroscopy ( diensthuber et al. , 2014 ) .
to probe for benign or adverse effects on receptor activity , all amino acids surrounding the fmn were mutated and their impact on light regulation was determined .
while several mutations severely impaired the dynamic range of the receptor ( e.g. , ile39val , arg63lys , and asn94ala ) , residue substitutions in a second group were benign with little effect on regulation ( e.g. , val28thr , asn37cys , and leu82ile ) .
both detection methods identified correlated effects for certain of the latter mutations on chromophore environment and response kinetics in yf1 and the lov2 domain from avena sativa phototropin 1 .
in sum , both studies concluded that mutations close to the fmn cofactor provide a powerful tool to adjust the light - responses of lov photoreceptors as demanded for optogenetic applications .
as outcome from low - temperature endor studies , a slight reorientation of the fmn binding position and as a consequence , a ( de ) stabilization of the c ( 4a ) adduct seems to be the most likely effect .
bluf domains in 2000 , the most recent member of blue - light percepting proteins , the flavin - containing blue - light receptors exemplified in the n - terminus of the appa protein of the purple bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides , was first described in the literature ( masuda and bauer , 2002 ) .
appa acts here as a transcriptional antirepressor and interacts with the photosynthesis repressor protein ppsr to form a stable appa - ( ppsr ) 2 complex in the dark .
the blue - light activated form of appa cannot associate with ppsr and thus , enables photosynthetic genes inhibition ( braatsch and klug , 2004 ). via comparison of amino - acid sequences , a new class of blue - light photoreceptors , the so - called bluf (" blue - light using fad ") domains ( gomelsky et al. , 2000 ) , were introduced .
this class contains a series of proteins from proteobacteria , cyanobacteria and some eukaryotes ( gomelsky and klug , 2002 ) .
three - dimensional structures from x - ray crystallographic data are now available for a number of bluf proteins .
their arrangement is unique among flavin - binding proteins and bears a more global similarity to a ferredoxin fold rather than to other photoreceptor molecules ( anderson et al. , 2005 ; kita et al. , 2005 ; grinstead et al. , 2006 ; jung et al. , 2006 ; yuan et al. , 2006 ) .
some sort of photocycle has been assumed for bluf proteins , however , no specific structural changes upon illumination have been observed so far .
illumination of bluf domains induces a small but distinct red shift of about 10 nm of the fad absorption in the uv - visible region ( laan et al. , 2003 ) , which is reversible in the dark .
lifetimes between a few seconds and up to several hours have been determined ( kraft et al. , 2003 ; masuda et al. , 2004 ) .
the photocycle is unique compared to the lov photoreceptors , in which light absorption induces relatively large spectroscopic changes of the chromophore .
although the molecular mechanism of bluf photochemistry is still under significant discussion ( see , e.g. , domratcheva et al. , 2008 ; wu and gardner , 2009 ) , three conserved amino acids are believed to be essential for this light - driven reaction : a tyrosine , a tryptophan and a glutamine , which are all located in direct proximity to n ( 5 ) of the fad 's isoalloxazine moiety .
a reaction scheme was first proposed by gauden and coworkers ( gauden et al. , 2005 ; laan et al. , 2006 ) : following blue - light illumination , a transient rp comprising of the fad and a conserved tyrosine is formed , which drives the hydrogen - bonding network around the n ( 5 ) position to rearrange .
in contrast to the triplet intermediate state in lov domains , the bluf reaction starts out mainly from the excited singlet state of the fad ( the complete reaction cycle is proposed to be completed within 1 ns ) ( gauden et al. , 2005 ) .
nevertheless , it has been demonstrated , that also triplet - state precursors are able to perform a hydrogen network rearrangement ( zirak et al. , 2005 ) .
as the primary light reaction is not accessible within the time scale of trepr , light - activated intermediates of the fad cofactor in three bluf domains from r. sphaeroides ( appa - bluf ) , synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 ( slr - bluf ) , and escherichia coli ( ycgf - bluf ) have been probed at low temperature ( weber et al. , 2011 ) .
it was the goal of this study to shed some light on intermediate states , and to identify specific protein - cofactor interactions that modulate their electronic wave functions .
as larger conformational changes are inhibited at these temperatures , the formation of intermediate states can be monitored ; however , no final signaling state is formed thus rendering the reaction cyclic .
photo - induced flavin triplet states and rp species have been detected on a microsecond time scale , but revealed a completely different behavior as compared to previously investigated lov domains ( schleicher et al. , 2004 ) .
moreover , bluf domains exhibit much higher spectral diversity .
while the trepr spectrum of the appa - bluf protein ( see figure 5 , upper panel ) is very similar to that of the lov domains , triplet - state spectra obtained from the ygcf - bluf protein show a completely different electron - spin polarization pattern ( see figure 5 , middle panel ) .
moreover , spectra recorded from the slr - bluf protein exhibit an even more complex spectral shape around g ~ 2 ( see figure 5 , lower panel ) .
to rationalize these differences , spectral simulations of flavin - triplet state trepr spectra have been performed ( see dashed lines in figure 5 ) ( weber et al. , 2011 ) .
it is interesting to note that pre - illuminated bluf domains did not show any signal assuming an efficient deactivation process that is completed within a ns - time scale ( mathes et al. , 2012 ) .

upper : dark - adapted and blue - light adapted appa - bluf protein .
middle : dark and blue - light illuminated ycgf - bluf samples .
lower : dark and blue - light illuminated slr - bluf protein .
the respective dashed curves represent spectral simulations of the dark - state sample .
trepr spectra from ycgf - bluf domains led us to the assumption that a nearby methionine can alter the wave function of the flavin triplet state , and thus , can be responsible for the unusual electron - spin polarization pattern ( weber et al. , 2011 ) .
moreover , slr - bluf undergoes a competing electron - transfer reaction , which is tentatively assigned to a flavin - tyrosine rp , but deserves further investigation .
nevertheless , it remains unclear why only slr - bluf samples show light - induced electron transfer under the chosen experimental conditions .
the answer to this question may be the key to correlating the electronic structure of light - induced excited states with biological signaling activity , which most likely depends on the stability of the light state .
on the other hand , based on the rather broad trepr rp signature , long - range electron transfer ( over distances larger than 1 nm ) can be excluded .
here , trepr beautifully shows its potential for assigning electron - transfer partners even in molecules with several potential electron donors .
in a different approach , dark - state bluf domains from thermosynechococcus elongatus were illuminated at low temperature , and the resulting meta - stable radicals were characterized using steady - state epr methods ( nagai et al. , 2008 ; kondo et al. , 2011 ) .
the illumination at 5 - 200 k derived an epr signal with a separation of 85 g between the main peaks around g ~ 2 , showing a typical pake powder pattern of magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between two nearby radicals .
extended illumination induced an epr signal at g = 2.0045 , which was assigned to a neutral flavosemiquinone fadh * .
the pake doublet was not detected in a mutant protein , in which the tyrosine residue was replaced with phenylalanine .
further analysis by pulsed - endor spectroscopy revealed an assignment to an fadh * and a tyrosine neutral radical by comparison with published endor signals ( mino et al. , 1997 ) .
very recently , a gln50ala mutant of slr - bluf was investigated ( fudim et al. , 2015 ) .
without the central glutamine , no red - shifted signaling state is formed , but light - induced proton - coupled electron transfer between the protein and flavin takes place , analogous as to the wt protein .
results from ultrafast optical spectroscopy demonstrated that the lifetime of the neutral flavin semiquinone - tyrosyl rp is greatly prolonged ( from < 100 ps in the wild - type protein ) to several nanoseconds , which indicates that the formation of radical intermediates drives the hydrogen - bond rearrangement in bluf photoactivation .
this lifetime is now in a range suitable for detection by trepr ; therefore , this method was applied to investigate this gln50ala mutation at ambient temperatures ( fudim et al. , 2015 ) .
the resulting trepr spectrum consists of a point - symmetric e / a / e / a signal pattern spanning a width of 15.5 mt , without any resolved hyperfine structure. from the symmetric pattern of the signal and its signature , a spin - correlated rp species with a singlet excited - state precursor can be assumed .
this is in contrast to the aforementioned low - temperature spectrum of wt slr - bluf , which has been assigned to a triplet - based spin correlated rp. a comparison between the rp observed in bluf domains and cryptochromes , respectively , reveals major differences regarding signal pattern and width .
for a quantitative analysis of the spectra obtained from the slr - bluf gln50ala sample , however , spectral simulations of this , for the first time in a protein observed strongly - coupled rp have to be performed to obtain exact distances and radical compositions .
summary the to date proposed and commonly accepted primary light reactions of the three examined flavin - dependent photoreceptors are summarized in figure 6 .
both differences as well as commonalities between each of the molecular mechanisms can be detected : whereas all signaling states are in principle reversible , only the cry reaction comprises of a redox reaction and thus , a yet unidentified electron donor is required in order to facilitate signaling - state formation in vivo ( established electron donors like edta or dtt are used for in vitro measurements ) .
this in turn demands an oxidizing agent ( most likely molecular oxygen in case of in vitro measurements ) for back reaction to the dark state .
in contrast , no additional reagents could yet be identified for back reaction in bluf and lov domains .
their signaling states are intrinsically metastable and thus , back reactions are only dependent on the thermal energies of the system .
consequently , the back reaction of crys directly depends on the accessibility and on the concentration of the oxidizing agent , whereas the life times of the signaling states in lov and bluf domains can be significantly modulated by the amino acids surrounding the flavin cofactor .
figure 6 proposed primary light reactions of flavin - dependent photoreceptors .
on the other hand , all mechanisms unify an electron transfer reaction after light excitation , very likely because of the large oxidation potential of excited - state flavins , which is estimated to be around 1.8 v ( heelis et al. , 1990 ) .
however , clear differences of the life times and the distances between the three intermediate rps are obtained .
whereas , cry rps are ~ 20 a apart , and hence , have millisecond life times , distances of ~ 6 a and correspondingly short life times are obtained in bluf and lov domains .
in sum , investigations with epr spectroscopy are an obvious choice and indeed , played a substantial role for the elucidation of the primary reactions of these photoreceptors .
in detail , first mechanistic proposals based on results from epr ( and optical ) investigations were published for crys and lov domains ( schleicher et al. , 2004 ; banerjee et al. , 2007 ; bouly et al. , 2007 ) .
in addition , trepr has been proven valuable for characterization of electron - transfer channels and the participating amino acids ( biskup et al. , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 ; weber et al. , 2010 ) .
the signaling - state generation in bluf domains , however , is generated within only a few nanoseconds , which inhibit direct results from epr spectroscopy .
in this case , either slowing down the reaction by decreasing the temperature or altering the reaction by selective mutations has been used .
how can secondary events like conformational changes be investigated by molecular spectroscopy ?
the signal - transduction events following the primary photo - processes are far from being fully understood in all three photoreceptor classes , although some key results emerge to shed light onto the principal mechanisms : more than 10 years ago , ground - breaking results from nmr spectroscopy demonstrated a reordering or even an unfolding of the helix ( named jalpha ) bridging a lov2 domain and its signal - transduction module ( harper et al. , 2004a,b ; herman et al. , 2013 ) , and thus , displayed a first molecular concept for signal propagation .
subsequent experiments with other lov domains yielded evidence that also dimerization reactions can occur after light excitation ( buttani et al. , 2007 ; moglich and moffat , 2007 ; nakasako et al. , 2008 ; zayner et al. , 2012 ; herman et al. , 2013 ) .
in arabidopsis cry2 , a homo oligomerization and subsequent binding to its partner protein cib1 has been identified ( hulsebosch et al. , 1997 ; kennedy et al. , 2010 ) , however , the variability of the ctt domain in crys implies that also other mechanisms are possible .
in bluf domains , also monomerization reactions have been identified ( prisner et al. , 2001 ; yuan et al. , 2006 ; wu and gardner , 2009 ) .
despite these initial achievements in unraveling signal - transduction pathways , several major questions regarding these secondary steps in photoreception remain unanswered : up to now , the interaction between individual multi - domain photoreceptors ( e.g. , lov1 and lov2 ) and how the two domains modulate the light - sensing signal are still unknown .
moreover , the slow dark - state recovery and the remarkable divergence of this reaction depending on the organism are still far from being understood .
furthermore , most amino acids that are responsible for conformational changes remain unidentified .
knowledge of these is in turn essential for application to optogenetics : exact control of the photoactivation and photoreversion rates , and optimized affinities between photoreceptor and signaling domain are highly desired and necessary .
in principle , photoreceptors are ideal for examining conformational changes as ( i ) both dark and signaling states can be generated with almost 100 % yield ; subsequent temperature reduction enables freezing the light state and allows for steady - state spectroscopy on both states , ( ii ) all reactions are in principle reversible , which permits accumulation of signals from intermediate states , and ( iii ) , short light pulses can be perfectly used as intrinsic trigger for time - resolved spectroscopy .
the application of structure determination methods such as x - ray crystallography or nmr spectroscopy , however , are limited for the analysis of the signaling states because ( i ) dimerization reactions and / or reordering of domains " precludes " crystallization and ( ii ) , most photoreceptors are too large for nmr spectroscopy .
on the other hand , epr spectroscopy in combination with sdsl may help to uncover conformational changes in photoreceptors .
to examine structural changes upon light excitation , various epr experiments are conceivable .
in general , the room temperature epr - spectral shape of a nitroxide sl is sensitive to the reorientational motion of its side chain due to partial motional averaging of anisotropic components of the g - and hfc - tensors ( klare and steinhoff , 2009 ; hubbell et al. , 2013 ) .
therefore , changes in mobility , accessibility and polarity can be used to characterize the effects on the epr signature due to the motional rate , amplitude , and anisotropy of the overall reorientational motion ( marsh , 2010 ; klare , 2013 ) .
changes in these parameters result in altered g - factors , spectral line widths , hf splittings , relaxation times , and rotational correlation times ; all of them can be extracted from an epr spectrum via spectral simulations ( klare and steinhoff , 2009 ; klare , 2013 ) .
this concept can be applied to all photoreceptors as changes in mobility of dark - and signaling state can be probed via cwepr at ambient temperatures .
to do so , a number of sdsl proteins have to be produced , and differences between the two states mapped. with the help of modern computational chemistry , changes of epr parameters can nowadays be correlated to structural changes ( mchaourab et al. , 2011 ; polyhach et al. , 2011 ) .
the drawback of this method is that only qualitative conclusions are possible .
for a quantitative analysis of conformational changes , the aforementioned concept has to be expanded to doubly - sl proteins .
the basis for this approach is that the distance between the two sls can be determined precisely through quantification of their mutual spin - spin interaction .
spin - spin interaction comprises static dipolar interaction , modulation of the dipolar interaction by the residual motion of the spin label side chains , and exchange interaction .
the combination of static dipolar and exchange interaction in an unordered , immobilized sample leads to considerable broadening of the cwepr spectrum if the interspin distance is less than 2 nm. in this case , interspin distances can then be determined by a detailed line - shape analysis of epr spectra of frozen protein samples using spectra - deconvolution ; however , this approach is still prone to various sources of errors ( hubbell and altenbach , 1994 ; hubbell et al. , 2000 ; steinhoff , 2004 ) .
on the other hand , exchange interaction is typically negligible for interspin distances larger than 2 nm. here , the direct measurement of the dipolar coupling is possible with the deer / peldor pulse sequence , which separates the dipole - dipole interaction from other contributions to the spin hamiltonian .
deer / peldor is based on the separate excitation of two groups of electron spins by applying 2 mw frequencies .
the strength of the dipolar interaction is directly observed as modulated decay curves in the time domain ( figure 7 ). via fourier transformation , the frequency of the modulation can be extracted and directly correlated to the interspin distance ( polyhach et al. , 2011 ; jeschke , 2012 ) .
comparison of distances between dark - and signaling states , performed with a number of differently doubly sl photoreceptors , results in a mapping of distance distributions that correspond to the extent of conformational changes .
as a representative example , the expected alteration of the distance distribution in phototropins is depicted in figure 7 .
the aforementioned reordering of the jalpha - helix is expected to result in a displacement of the kinase domain .
if sls are attached to one of the lov domains and to the kinase domain , these structural changes can be monitored and analyzed .
although the accessibility of full - length structural information is very helpful for the analysis of distance data , interpretation is still possible without this information at hand : a combination of structural information of the individual domains and modern structure modeling is able to bypass missing full - length structures .
it has to be mentioned that this concept can be easily adapted to follow dimerization ( monomerization ) reactions : here , the photoreceptor is labeled at one position , and deer / eldor spectra of dark - and signaling states are recorded .
distances will only be obtained when the photoreceptor is in its dimeric state .
figure 7 distance determination of dark - and signaling - states via pulsed eldor spectroscopy .
as a representative example , plant phototropin has been chosen .
the only disadvantage of the concept is that for efficient and selective coupling of the sl to the protein , cysteine residues at defined positions are obviously prerequisite .
in case of small lov and bluf domains , no or only a few cysteines are encoded in the wt proteins ; however , a number of naturally occurring cysteine residues are found in large photoreceptors such as phototropins or plant cryptochromes .
here , " unwanted " cysteines need to be removed with the help of molecular - biology methods prior labeling to avoid attachment of more than two sl thereby complicating distance analysis .
although the general procedure is well established , mutating a number of amino acids in a protein may always lead to misfolded and / or non - functional protein .
but such effects can in principle be controlled by a " clever " mutation scheme .
additionally , various recently developed labeling techniques using click - chemistry and unnatural amino acids enable the possibilities to circumvent general labeling problems such as cysteine - rich proteins ( fleissner et al. , 2009 ) .
moreover , the usage of orthogonal labeling with two different sls attached to the protein of interest provides additional information and clear advantages in performing eldor / deer spectroscopy as modulation depths of the recorded time traces are significantly increased and selective mw excitation can be applied ( chen et al. , 2011 ) .
clearly , bringing together modern pulsed epr , ideally performed at various magnetic - field / microwave - frequency ranges to exploit orientation - selection effects , with other nowadays well established methods such as sdsl , freeze quenching , molecular quantum mechanics , molecular mechanics , and , last but not least , sophisticated frequency analysis to accurately extract sl distances , provides the means of unraveling the structure and structural changes of photoreceptors , isolated and in complex with other proteins .
although this global combined approach is challenging and not straightforward to apply , it may be the only means in cases where other more highly resolving techniques , such as x - ray diffraction , due to the lack of high - quality single crystals , or nmr , due to the too large size of a protein complex , do not lead to meaningful propositions for a full comprehension of the functioning of photoreceptors .
while epr and in particular trepr have already demonstrated their value in unraveling the primary photochemistry of blue - light photoreceptors , deer / peldor still needs to prove itself in the vibrant but challenging photoreceptor research field .
nevertheless , we are confident , that within the next decade significant insight in signal transduction will be presented based on pulse epr distance analyses .

the pax2 transcription factor plays a crucial role in axon - guidance and astrocyte differentiation in the optic nerve head ( onh ) during vertebrate visual system development .
however , little is known about its function during regeneration .
the fish visual system is in continuous growth and can regenerate .
muller cells and astrocytes of the retina and onh play an important role in these processes .
we demonstrate that pax2a in goldfish is highly conserved and at least two pax2a transcripts are expressed in the optic nerve .
moreover , we show two different astrocyte populations in goldfish : pax2 + astrocytes located in the onh and s100 + astrocytes distributed throughout the retina and the onh .
after peripheral growth zone ( pgz ) cryolesion , both pax2 + and s100 + astrocytes have different responses .
at 7 days after injury the number of pax2 + cells is reduced and coincides with the absence of young axons .
in contrast , there is an increase of s100 + astrocytes in the retina surrounding the onh and s100 + processes in the onh .
at 15 days post injury , the pgz starts to regenerate and the number of s100 + astrocytes increases in this region .
moreover , the regenerating axons reach the onh and the pax2a gene expression levels and the number of pax2 + cells increase .
at the same time , s100 +/ gfap +/ gs + astrocytes located in the posterior onh react strongly .
in the course of the regeneration , muller cell vitreal processes surrounding the onh are primarily disorganized and later increase in number .
during the whole regenerative process we detect a source of pax2 +/ pcna + astrocytes surrounding the posterior onh .
we demonstrate that pax2a expression and the pax2 + astrocyte population in the onh are modified during the pgz regeneration , suggesting that they could play an important role in this process .
introduction the fish visual system is in continuous growth and can regenerate after suffering a lesion [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
in the peripheral growth zone ( pgz ) of the retina new retinal ganglion cells ( rgc ) are added to the mature retina .
these rgc extend their axons , which travel throughout the most vitreal part of the retina , reach the optic nerve head ( onh ) and incorporate into the optic nerve in an organized way [ 3 ] .
in this organized trajectory , muller cells and astrocytes in the retina and onh play fundamental roles .
during both development and , in fish , also during continuous growth , muller cells establish contacts with the growing axons and release different adhesion and guidance molecules , such as laminins , ephrins or immunoglobulins to the basal lamina participating in the guidance of axons through the retina [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
moreover , astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer ( nfl ) pack the rgc axons and seem to participate in guiding young rgc axons coming from the pgz [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
in the onh , both types of glial cells are involved in the formation of a favorable environment , expressing guidance molecules such as r - cadherin , netrin1 or slit2 , which promote the axon growth and their incorporation into the optic nerve [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
after injury , in contrast to mammals , fish astrocytes promote axon regeneration and actively participate in the regenerative process [ 1 ] , [ 9 ] .
muller cells are capable of dedifferentiating and originating all kinds of retinal cells recuperating the damaged region [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
moreover , they seem to produce molecules that protect the lesioned rgc during the first stages after optic nerve crush in mammals [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
astrocytes in the onh also participate in the guidance and organization of the axons after an injury , modifying the expression of axon - guidance molecules , such as netrin1 , and packing the newly formed axons [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
in vertebrates there is a population of pax2 + astrocytes in the onh during development and in adulthood [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
pax2 belongs to the transcription factor subfamily pax2 / 5 / 8 characterized by the paired domain ( pd domain ) and the partial sequence homeobox as dna binding - domains , an octapeptide that interacts with other proteins , and a transactivating / inhibiting domain [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
during development it participates in the choroid fissure closure , glial precursor differentiation and rgc axon guidance throughout the onh and the optic chiasm [ 24 ] .
moreover , pax2 acquires a special importance in the region that originates the onh [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
in the absence of the pax2 gene expression the choroid fissure fails to close and determines the human disease called coloboma [ 28 ] .
pax2 seems to promote the astroglial phenotype in adults , as well as participating in axon guidance processes in fish [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
in some teleosts such as zebrafish ( danio rerio ) , the pax2 gene is duplicated in two genes : pax2a and pax2b .
the pax2a is more similar to the mammalian pax2 gene in its expression pattern .
the pax2b gene also participates in optic nerve development , though its expression is delayed [ 22 ] .
in this work we propose to analyze the astrocyte response in the onh after removing the pgz , paying special attention to the pax2 + astrocytes , whose function has not yet been analyzed during regeneration .
using the goldfish ( carassius auratus ) as an animal model of central nervous system regeneration , we find that the pax2 + astrocyte population and pax2a gene expression are affected in the absence of young rgc axons after pgz elimination and react strongly when the regenerating axons reach the onh again .
we also compare pax2 + astrocytes [ 19 ] with the s100 + astrocyte population in the retina and onh , previously described [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 17 ] , and we find that they belong to different astrocyte subpopulations .
moreover , we discover that s100 + astrocytes are not only involved in onh reorganization after an injury , but also in pgz regeneration .
we also describe morphological modifications in vitreal muller cell processes in the onh during the whole regenerative process , suggesting that they are also involved in the guidance and reorganization of the regenerating axons .
finally , we characterize a new source of astroblasts activated after injury in the posterior onh .
results pax2 + cells in control onh pax2 + cells are exclusively located in the goldfish onh limiting the retina and the central artery ( ca ) with the optic nerve ( fig. 1a ) .
we had already characterized these pax2 + cells as astrocytes [ 19 ] .
they express the two astrocyte intermediate filaments : gfap and cytokeratin , and the zonula occludens ( zo1 ) proteins .
moreover , they have the typical astrocyte ultrastructure features , such as a euchromatic nucleus , intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm and desmosome cell junctions [ 19 ] .
furthermore , pax2 + astrocytes show a close relationship with the young rgc axons labeled with zn8 antibody ( fig. 1a and c ) , which recognizes the surface molecule neurolin present in the growing axons [ 5 ] .

pax2 + cells in the onh of cryolesioned animals in this work we analyzed the pax2 + astrocyte response in the goldfish onh after pgz cryolesion .
although pax2 + cell distribution in the onh was similar to that of controls during the whole regenerative process ( figs. 1a - f ) , we found modifications in number and immunolabeling features .
at 2 d post - cryolesion , there was no difference in the pax2 + astrocyte number compared with control animals ( p > 0.05 ) ( fig. 1b ) .
nevertheless , at 7 d post - cryolesion , zn8 + growing rgc axons were not detected ( fig. 1d ) , and coincident with this , pax2 immunolabeling was much weaker than in control animals ( figs. 1c - d ) and there was a highly significant decrease in the number of pax2 + cells (** p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 1b ) .
the intensity of labeling in pax2 + cells was recovered once the first zn8 + regenerating axons reached the onh at 15 ( data not shown ) - 21 d after cryolesion ( fig. 1e ) .
furthermore , at this time after injury there was an increase in the number of pax2 + cells , which was highly significant (** p < 0.01 ) at 30 d ( fig. 1b ). from 90 d after injury we found a large amount of regenerating rgc axons arriving at the onh ( fig. 1f ) .
this coincided with the high quantity of zn8 + growing rgc axons immunodetected in the pgz ( fig. 1g ) .
pax2 + cell labeling was similar to that of control animals ( figs. 1c , f ) , as well as their number from 60 d until the 120 d post - injury stages analyzed in this work ( fig. 1b ) .
we combined double immunolabeling of pax2 with the astrocyte antibodies anti - intermediate filaments , gfap and cytokeratin , and the zo1 protein as we did previously in control animals [ 19 ] .
we did not find differences in pax2 + cell characterization , nor in gfap , cytokeratin or zo1 protein distribution compared with controls ( not shown ) .
to further study the modifications and changes in the cell typology of pax2 + cells after cryolesion , we analyzed their ultrastructure by immuno - electron microscopy .
at 7 d and 21 d after the cryolesion , we found pax2 labeling located precisely in the nucleus of some cells with the typical ultrastructural features of astrocytes ( figs. 2a - b ) , similar to that of control animals [ 19 ] .
they showed a euchromatic nucleus with indentations , they had packs of intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm and they joined to each other by numerous desmosomes ( figs. 2a - b ) .
as we described previously in control animals [ 19 ] , we also found pax2 - astrocytes ( not shown ) .
at 21 d post - injury , in contrast to control and 7 d , we also found numerous cells with euchromatic nuclei , and some of them showed pax2 immunolabeling ( figs. 2c - d ) .
these are probably astrocytes .
it is noteworthy that surrounding all these cells there were a great number of astrocyte processes ( figs. 2c , e ) , adding another characteristic to the astrocyte reaction .
in accordance with this , we also found numerous regions in degeneration ( fig. 2c ) and granulocyte cells , with dark and light vesicles in their cytoplasm , associated with the blood vessels ( fig. 2c ) .
dividing cells ( fig. 2c ) and pax2 + immature cells , probably astroblasts ( fig. 2f ) , were also found .
interestingly , in all dividing and immature cells , doughnut - shaped mitochondria were detected in their cytoplasm ( fig. 2f ) .

molecular characterization of goldfish pax2a and phylogenetic analysis to analyze the goldfish pax2a gene expression level in onh during regeneration using rt - qpcr assays , firstly , two partial - length cdnas of 404 bp and 359 bp were cloned ( fig. 3a ) .
sequence analysis encoding both cdnas showed two open reading frames ( orf ) of 134 and 119 amino acids , respectively , which include the pax2a octapeptide domain .
comparing these two goldfish cdnas with other pax2a isoforms identified for alternative splicing in zebrafish ( pax2a _ tv1 : ensdart00000076992 and pax2a _ tv2 : nm _ 131184.2 [ 29 ] , in fig. 3b - c ) , we found that both goldfish transcripts are highly homologous to 11 isoforms of zebrafish ( 98 % of identity ) and we denominated the new isoforms characterized in this work pax2a _ tv1 and pax2a _ tv2 .
what is more , as shown in figs. 3d - e , the comparison of each pax2a isoform of goldfish with its corresponding zebrafish homolog showed a 99 % of identity with only a single change of a threonine in goldfish instead of a serine in zebrafish .

the octapeptide domain is marked in grey .
in order to analyze the phylogeny of the two goldfish pax2a transcript variants found in this work , using the neighbour - joining ( nj ) method , a phylogenetic tree of the aligned amino acid sequences from pax2 of different representative species was constructed ( fig. 4 ) .
we included two other members of the pax2 / 5 / 8 subfamily ( pax5 and pax8 ) [ 30 ] and the drosophila melanogaster shaven [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] sequence , which were used as out groups in this analysis .
we found that both isoforms of pax2a of goldfish and zebrafish belong to the same clade and they are separated from the pax2 of other vertebrates .
in addition , the ancestral d. melanogaster shaven is found in a basal position compared to the rest of the members of the pax2 / 5 / 8 subfamily in the tree ( fig. 4 ) .
thus , we demonstrate that transcripts of goldfish pax2a are orthologous to the rest of vertebrate pax2 .

expression analysis of goldfish pax2a of the onh as most pax2a studies in zebrafish are carried out with the transcript variant pax2a _ tv2 , which is orthologous to the rest of vertebrate pax2 , we chose goldfish pax2a _ tv2 to analyze its expression during regeneration .
as shown in fig. 5a , we previously checked goldfish pax2a _ tv2 expression in control retina and onh using rt - pcr assays .
we found that pax2a _ tv2 is expressed in both ; however , it is noteworthy that gene expression level in retina is lower than in the onh .

the highly significant differences are indicated with two asterisks (** p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , in rt - qpcrs , we found changes in pax2a _ tv2 expression levels during regeneration after cryolesion ( fig. 5b ) .
at 2 d post - injury , we did not detect differences in pax2a _ tv2 expression compared with controls ( p > 0.05 ) .
nonetheless , from 7 d ( 3.51 fold ) to 30 d after cryolesion ( 2.90 fold ) its gene expression level was highly significantly increased (** p < 0.01 ) compared with control animals ( 1 fold ) .
the pax2a _ tv2 expression level reached the maximum at 15 - 30 d regenerative stages ( 15 d : 7.68 fold ; 21 d : 5.72 fold ; 30 d : 6.36 fold ) , anticipating the arrival of axons at the onh at 21 d post - injury ( fig. 1e ) .
finally , at 90 d post - injury ( 1.01 fold ) pax2a _ tv2 expression was similar to control levels ( p > 0.05 ) .
s100 + cells in control retina to better analyze the astrocyte response after pgz cryolesion in the onh , we used the typical astrocyte marker s100 .
we found that s100 + cells were distributed throughout the nfl of the retina from the pgz ( fig. 6a - b ) to the central retina close to the onh ( fig. 6c ) in control animals .
s100 + cells did not show any close relationship with either young zn8 + rgc axons or retinal blood vessels ( fig. 6a ) .
nevertheless , the number of s100 + cells was higher in the intermediate zone than in the pgz and the central retina (^ 0.01 < p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 6k ) .

some retinal s100 + cells had weak gfap + labeling in their processes , which never co - localized with the s100 immunolabeling ( figs. 6d - e ) .
both s100 +/ gfap - ( fig. 6d ) cells and s100 +/ gfap + cells ( fig. 6e ) showed the same elongated morphology and location in the nfl , suggesting that both of them are astrocytes , as previously proposed for tench [ 8 ] .
s100 + cells in cryolesioned retina at 7 d after cryolesion , the pgz was completely disorganized ( fig. 6f ) and we did not find zn8 + young rgc axons ( data not shown ) .
in this stage of degeneration , the s100 + cell population changed .
in the pgz , they were specially located close to the injured zone showing a round morphology ( fig. 6f ) , but there was no significant increase in their density ( p > 0.05 ) ( fig. 6k ) .
on the other hand , in the central retina , there was a highly significant increase in their density compared with controls (** p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 6k ) .
these s100 + cells maintained their elongated morphology and were distributed throughout the whole nfl ( fig. 6g ) .
at 15 - 21 d after cryolesion , a high amount of regenerating rgc axons was labeled with the anti - zn8 antibody in the pgz ( fig. 6h ) .
in this region we found a highly significant increase of s100 + cells (** p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 6k ) .
some of these s100 + cells were closely located to the zn8 + regenerating axons , but other s100 + cells were not related with them ( fig. 6h ) .
however , some s100 + cells migrated or directed their processes to the inner layers of the retina ( figs. 6h - i ) establishing a limit between the damaged retina and the intact retina ( figs. 6i ) .
the density of s100 + cells in the central retina was not significantly different from control retinas ( p > 0.05 ) ( fig. 6k ) and the cells maintained their elongated morphology ( fig. 6j ) .
meanwhile , the number of s100 + cells in the intermediate zone suffered a significant decrease (* 0.01 < p < 0.05 ) compared with controls ( fig. 6k ). from 30 d post - injury , the pgz started to regenerate ( fig. 1g ) and the number of s100 + cells reached the control levels ( p > 0.05 ) in all regions of the retina ( fig. 6k ) .
s100 + cells in control onh in the onh of control animals , s100 + cells were scarce and they had an elongated shape and processes similar to those previously described in retina ( fig. 7a ) .
s100 + cells were mainly located longitudinal to the rgc axons and they did not limit the optic nerve with the ca and the retina ( fig. 7a ) .
moreover , few of them showed co - localization with the astrocyte marker gfap ( fig. 7a ) .
we also found a few s100 + cells with rounded and small soma without processes , mainly located in the optic disc and always negative to gfap .
it has been suggested that they may be oligodendrocytes ( fig. 7a ) [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .

s100 + cells in the onh of cryolesioned animals at 7 d after cryolesion , we found a high increase in s100 + processes in the whole onh ( figs. 7b - d ) .
s100 + cells located between the rgc axons maintained their elongated shape but they presented longer processes compared with controls ( fig. 7c ) .
in the posterior part of the onh limiting with the choroids and sclera , some s100 + cells reacted strongly to the injury ( figs. 7b , d ) .
they were barely detected in control animals .
these cells , whose somata are located in the glia limitans forming a ring , direct their processes transversally to the inner onh ( fig. 7d ) and they also co - express glutamine synthetase ( gs ) in their cytoplasm ( fig. 7d ) .
we did not see any change in the s100 +/ gfap + cell population located in the onh ( not shown ) .
at 15 - 21 d after the cryolesion , the appearance of s100 labeling among the rgc axons was similar to that of control animals ( figs. 7e - f ) and was maintained until the latest regenerative stages analyzed in this work ( fig. 7h ) .
however , we detected strongly labeled s100 + processes , which leave from the inner part of the inner plexiform layer ( ipl ) and they are addressed to the optic nerve longitudinal to the rgc axons ( figs. 7e - f ) .
these processes were also positive for gfap ( fig. 7e ) and gs ( fig. 7f ) .
in the posterior onh , the s100 + ring was conserved in this regenerative stage and co - localizes with gfap ( fig. 7e ) and gs ( fig. 7f ) .
the same structure appeared pax2 - ( fig. 7g ) .
this suggests that there are two populations of astrocytes that react to the injury .
s100 + cells recovered an organization similar to that of control animals , including the s100 + ring located in the posterior onh , from 30 d post - injury onwards ( fig. 7h ) .
during the whole regenerative process , we did not find changes in the s100 + cells with round - shape and small soma ( not shown ) .
muller cells surrounding the onh fish retina muller cells have been clearly characterized as gfap +/ gs + in control animals [ 7 ] , [ 19 ] .
those located surrounding the onh also have special morphological features and establish a limit between the retina and the optic nerve in the optic disc [ 7 ] .
in the first regenerative stages ( 7 - 21 d ) we did not find many gfap +/ gs + muller cell vitreal processes surrounding the onh ( figs. 7d - g ) .
in contrast , at 30 - 90 d post - injury , a high number of these muller processes were detected surrounding the onh ( fig. 7h ) .
this was coincident with the massive arrival of regenerating rgc axons in this region , some of them located far from the growing edge ( figs. 1e , g ) .
dividing cells in the onh in cryolesioned animals we also analyzed the number of proliferative cells labeled with pcna during the whole regenerative process in the onh .
similar to pax2 + cells , the pcna + cell number did not undergo significant changes at 2 d after cryolesion ( p > 0.05 ) compared with controls ( fig. 8j ) .
however , from 7 d to 90 d post - injury , the number of pcna + cells was highly significant (** p < 0.01 ) compared with controls ( fig. 8j ) .
the normal number of cells ( p > 0.05 ) was reached at 120 d post - cryolesion ( fig. 8j ) .

ca : central artery .
in order to know which of these pcna + cells were pax2 + astrocytes , we performed immunolabeling. from 15 d to 60 d after cryolesion ( figs. 8c - g ) , we found more pax2 +/ pcna + cells than in control animals ( figs. 8a - b ) .
however , the majority of the pcna + cells were negative to pax2 .
the pax2 +/ pcna + cells found were part of the glia limitans of the central artery ( ca ) ( figs. 8c , f - g ) , but at earlier regenerative stages , they were mostly located in the posterior limit between the retina and the optic nerve forming a ring around the onh ( figs. 8d - e ) .
we did not find pax2 +/ pcna + cells among the rgc axons .
to analyze if there was some s100 + cell renewal , we also carried out double immunolabeling with pcna .
we found more s100 +/ pcna + cells than in control animals especially present at 15 - 21 d post - injury ( figs. 8h - i ) .
however , similar to the results described for pax2 +/ pcna + cells , we found few s100 +/ pcna + cells among the whole pcna + cell population during regeneration ( 8h ) .
these s100 +/ pcna + cells were always located between the rgc axons but not forming the glia limitans ( fig. 8i ) .
discussion to our knowledge this is the first report analyzing the pax2 + astrocyte population and the pax2a gene expression in the onh during regeneration of the rgc axons .
in addition , with the combination of different astrocyte markers we differentiate the pax2 + astrocyte population from s100 + astrocytes , which have a different location in the onh and extend throughout the retina .
moreover , they react differently during the degeneration and regeneration of young rgc axons .
this suggests that pax2 + astrocytes and s100 + astrocytes belong to different glial subpopulations in the onh .
pax2 + and s100 + cells in control animals in the onh we demonstrate , that the pax2 protein is exclusively located in a subpopulation of astrocytes in the onh control [ 19 ] and during regeneration .
recent studies have demonstrated that pax2 expression is maintained in adult vertebrate retina and onh and they suggest that this transcription factor is involved in the astrocyte phenotype maintenance [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
we find that s100 + cells may belong to a different glial subpopulation than pax2 + astrocytes .
the s100 + cells are firstly located in the nfl and onh in contrast to the pax2 + astrocytes , which are exclusively located in the onh [ 19 ] .
moreover , s100 + cells are preferably arranged longitudinal to the rgc axons probably packing them as they do in tench [ 7 ] .
however , pax2 + astrocytes are mostly located limiting the retina and ca with the onh and they co - localize with gfap [ 19 ] .
furthermore , s100 + astrocytes are not closely located to newly formed rgc axons in the retina and onh , in contrast to pax2 + astrocytes [ 19 ] .
also , s100 + astrocytes are not related with blood vessels in contrast to pax2 + astrocytes in the goldfish optic nerve , which limit the blood vessels [ 19 ] and retinal pax2 + astrocytes in mammals , which are highly involved in retina angiogenesis [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
pax2 + and s100 + cells in lesioned animals in the onh after injury , we find a different response of pax2 + with regard to s100 + astrocytes after the first days post - cryolesion .
in the absence of young axons , the number of pax2 + cells decreases as well as the immunolabeling intensity .
this maybe a strong response of the s100 + astrocyte population in the goldfish onh as described in tench [ 17 ] .
this decrease of pax2 + cells could be due to the cell death led by the axon degeneration , as demonstrated in mammals [ 37 ] .
however , we cannot discard the possibility that the pax2 protein changes its phosphorylation level [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] not being detectable by the antibody [ 40 ] .
in accordance with this last supposition , we find that pax2a mrna levels are 3.5 fold elevated at 7 d post - injury , showing that although the protein is not detectable , the gene is highly transcribed .
the arrival of the young axons to the onh is coincident with the increase of pax2 + astrocytes reaching higher levels than in control animals .
previous studies during mouse , zebrafish and chicken development demonstrate that pax2 is directly involved in the rgc axon guidance throughout the onh and optic chiasm [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 41 ] .
it is known that astrocytes play a fundamental role guiding , organizing and packing the regenerating axons [ 9 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] .
probably the pax2 + astrocyte increase in the onh is related with those processes .
however , the s100 + cells increase during the first days of lesion. with regard to the retina , the s100 + increase their number when newly formed rgc in the pgz send their growing axons to the optic nerve .
this high quantity of s100 + cells is probably due to their migration from the medial retina , where their number decreases at the same regenerative stage .
although , we do not discount the idea that some s100 + cells divide and increase their number , most of them did not show co - labeling with pcna ( not shown ) .
s100 protein is involved in numerous intracellular and extracellular processes potentially active in regeneration [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
thus , its intracellular activity in the cytoskeleton dynamic may explain the high amount of s100 + processes and the numerous astrocyte processes filled by intermediate filaments revealed by electron microscopy .
on the other hand , in the extracellular environment s100 protein may be involved in the positive chemotactic attraction of the high quantity of microglia / macrophages described in the tench onh [ 17 ] and prevent neuronal death and promote axon growth .
interestingly , we describe for the first time an s100 +/ gfap +/ gs + astrocyte ring located in the posterior part of the onh and strongly activated after injury .
these astrocytes may be involved in the reorganization of the regenerating axons , ensuring their entrance to the optic nerve and starting to pack them into bundles [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 44 ] .
this ring has a similar location to the lamina cribosa in mammals and birds [ 45 ] .
molecular characterization of goldfish pax2a here we identify two partial transcripts of goldfish pax2a , which are highly homologous to the ones identified in zebrafish .
we analyze its predicted protein sequences and demonstrate that both goldfish isoforms pax2a are orthologous to other identified vertebrate pax2 .
pax2 splicing has been identified in different vertebrates such as zebrafish [ 29 ] , african clawed frog ( xenopus laevis ) [ 46 ] , chicken ( gallus gallus ) [ 20 ] , mouse ( mus musculus ) [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] and human ( homo sapiens ) [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , however , little is known about the functions of the transcript variants .
moreover , we demonstrate by rt - pcr that the pax2a _ tv2 isoform is also expressed in goldfish retina , but its expression level is less intense than in the onh .
although we have not detected the pax2 protein in the retina , it has been recently reported that muller cells in chicken and zebrafish central retina express it [ 18 ] , [ 20 ] .
we hypothesized that the retina may contain pax2 but the sensitivity of antibody used in the immunohistochemical assays could be too low to detect very low amounts of the pax2a protein .
expression analysis of goldfish pax2a in the onh it has been proposed that pax genes may play an important role during regeneration processes [ 53 ] .
while pax6 expression in the retina has been analyzed by rt - qpcr after pgz cryolesion in goldfish and tench [ 54 ] and by western blot after optic nerve crush in zebrafish and a lizard ( ornate crevice - dragon , ctenophorus ornatos ) [ 55 ] ; there are no previous studies that analyze pax2 expression after injury and regeneration .
here we show that the pax2a gene expression in the onh is highly affected during regeneration after pgz lesion , suggesting that it plays an important role in this process .
during the process of development of the visual system there is a mechanism of reciprocal inhibition between pax6 and pax2 that determines their specific location in the retina and optic nerve [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
when we compare the pax6 gene expression level in the goldfish cryolesioned retina [ 54 ] with the pax2a gene expression level in the onh , we find that the expression level of pax6 increases when pax2a expression decreases at later regeneration stages .
it seems likely that the inhibitory mechanism can be conserved in adult fish and may be actively working during regeneration .
upstream and downstream elements involved in the pax2a pathway during visual system development [ 24 ] , such as retinoic acid [ 58 ] or netrin - 1 [ 59 ] , are affected during regeneration .
this suggests that the whole signaling network could be maintained in models of continuous growth and regeneration .
rodger et al .
[ 55 ] proposed that pax6 inhibition in zebrafish retina after optic nerve crush is related with the spontaneous regeneration of rgc axons .
the maximum pax2a expression level we detected coincides with the arrival of the first regenerating axons to the onh .
previous studies during visual system development in mice and zebrafish lacking the pax2 expression [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] and pax2 over expression in chicken [ 41 ] , demonstrate that pax2 is responsible for an appropriate rgc axon guidance throughout the optic nerve .
thus , it seems likely that pax2 is participating in the axon guidance during regeneration .
on the other hand , the increase of pax6 expression [ 54 ] and the decrease of pax2a expression in the latest regenerative stages appear to be involved with the restoration of topographic connections [ 55 ] when the regenerating axons arrive at the optic tectum [ 60 ] .
dividing cells in the onh in cryolesioned animals we find that pax2 +/ pcna + cells are particularly located in the posterior part of the onh close to the retina , as they are in control animals [ 19 ] , and are activated after injury forming a ring .
this new source of astroblasts in the visual system has only been described during mammal development [ 35 ] , [ 61 ] .
thus , we demonstrate for the first time this new astroblast source , present in adult vertebrate control animals [ 19 ] , which becomes more active in injured animals , and participates in both continuous growth and regeneration processes. with immunogold labeling we show that pax2 is not only present in mature astrocytes , but also in the nucleus of immature astrocytes .
in both pax2 + and pax2 - dividing and immature cells we find doughnut - shaped mitochondria .
this particular kind of mitochondria has been described in the cytoplasm of astrocytes in rat hippocampus ( http :// synapses.clm.utexas.edu / atlas / 1 _ 1 _ 4 _ 9.stm ) .
however , nothing is known about their significance .
we hypothesize that they could be related with plasticity mechanisms .
due to the high proliferation rate in the onh after injury , especially the first post - lesion days , pax2 may have similar functions as during development , such as promoting pax2 + cell survival [ 62 ] , assuring their astrocyte identity [ 18 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 63 ] and preventing their differentiation into pigmentary epithelium [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] .
materials and methods animals for immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) and pcr analyses we employed adult goldfish ( c. auratus ) , 8 - 12 cm in body length obtained from commercial suppliers .
also , for pcr experiments we used ~ 200 zebrafish embryos ( d. rerio , ab wild type strain ) of 5 days post - fertilization ( dpf ) .
goldfish were kept in aquaria at 18 +/ - 1degreesc and zebrafish at 28.5 +/ - 1degreesc , all of them in a 12 h light / dark cycle and , prior to analysis , they were deeply anesthetized with 0.03 % tricaine methanesulfonate in water ( ms - 222 ; sigma ) .

invitrogen 33 - 9100 1:100 for the statistical analysis of the number of cells in the onh , we counted cells from 2 - 6 tissue sections randomly selected from four control and cryolesioned animals of each survival time analyzed ( 2 - 120 d ) .
we counted all labeled cells from the area located between the two edges of the neural retina near the onh excluding the central artery ( ca ) [ 19 ] .
for the statistical analysis of the number of cells in the retina , we divided the in toto retina in three parts : pgz , intermediate zone and central retina close to the onh and we counted cells of each part considered from the four quadrants of the in toto retina , measuring 544,000 microm2 each .
we used 6 control and 6 cryolesioned animals of 7 , 21 and 30 d post - lesion .
all cell counts were performed with imagej software ( http :// rsb.info.nih.gov / ij / index.html ) .
the statistical analysis was performed using anova followed by the post - hoc bonferroni test to compare different regions in the same experimental group and the post - hoc dunnett 's t - test to compare animals with different survival times with control ones .
immunogold labeling six animals were transcardially perfused with a fixative solution containing 4 % paraformaldehyde , 0.2 % picric acid and 0.25 % glutaraldehyde in pb. the onh were dissected out and post - fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0.25 % glutaraldehyde in pb for 2 h at rt. after several washes in pb , the onh were cryoprotected in 25 % sucrose and 10 % glycerol in pb , frozen and thawed three times and washed with pb. the immunostaining was performed following the protocol described by parrilla et al .
[ 19 ] .
the concentration of the primary anti - pax2 antibody is indicated in table 1 and the ultra - small gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( aurion , nl ) was diluted 1:100 .
afterwards , the onh were fixed with 0.5 % osmium tetroxide ( ems ) for 20 min at rt , dehydrated at 4degreesc , and flat - embedded in epon 12 resin ( ems ) .
ultrathin sections were stained with 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate .
photomicrographs some of the light microscopy images were obtained with an olympus apogee digital camera coupled to an olympus ax - 70 photomicroscope and the rest of the fluorescent images were obtained with a laser scanning spectral confocal microscope ( leica tcs sp2 ) .
in order to evaluate co - localizations , the same exposure and confocal settings were maintained for each fluorescent channel in the optical and confocal microscope respectively .
the ultrathin sections were observed in a zeiss em900 electron microscope and the pictures were taken with the coupled digital camera using imagesp software .
original pictures were further processed with adobe photoshop cs4 software .
isolation of rna , rt - pcr and expression analysis optic nerves , onh and retina from 24 adult goldfish and 200 whole zebrafish embryos of 5 dpf were mechanically homogenized separately .
each sample of total rna was extracted in accordance with the rneasy ( r ) mini kit protocol ( qiagen ) and purified from genomic dna with the turbo dna - free ( tm ) kit ( applied biosystems ) .
the quantification of rna and posterior cdna was carried out using a nanophotometer ( implen gmbh ) .
total rna , primed with random primers , was reverse - transcribed into cdna using the first - strand cdna synthesis kit ( improm - ii reverse - transcriptase system ; promega ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
an rna - free ( negative ) control sample was used in these experiments .
in order to identify the sequence of goldfish pax2 mrna by pcr assays , we used 25 microl pcr mixture containing 50 ng of cdna template , 20 pmol of each pair of primers ( table 2 ) , 0.2 mm dntps , 1.5 mm mgcl2 and 5 units of gotaq flexi dna polymerase ( promega ) .
we used the zebrafish pax2a interexonic primers designed by pfeffer et al .
[ 22 ] .
also , zebrafish beta - actin primers , taken from cid [ 54 ] ( table 2 ) were used as an internal and loading control .
pcr amplifications were as follows : 1 cycle at 95degreesc for 5 min as an initial denaturation step , denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s , annealing at 58 - 63degreesc for 1 min and extension at 72degreesc for 1 min ( 35 cycles ) followed by further incubation for 7 min at 72degreesc .
the pcr products were loaded on 2 % agarose gels in 40 mm tris - acetate , 1 m methylenediamine tetraacetic acid ph 8.0 and visualised by ethidium bromide staining .
a dna free ( negative ) control sample was used which did not produce any amplified bands .

the pcr product ( 50 - 150 ng ) and 3 pmol of the sequenced primer ( table 2 ) were used for sequencing reactions which were performed in a 3100 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems ) .
dna sequencing was performed on both strands from 2 different animals .
dna sequences were analyzed with chromas 2.3 ( r ) software ( school of health science , griffith university , australia ) and compared with other nucleotide and / or protein sequence databases using the fasta and blast programs from the european molecular biology laboratory ( embl ; http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / embl ) and from the national centerfor biotechnology information ( ncbi ; http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) .
the retrieved dna and protein sequences were aligned with the clustalw program , setting all the parameters as default [ 65 ] .
the obtained multiple sequence alignments were then used to construct a neighbour - joining ( nj ) tree with mega4.0.2 ( molecular evolutionary genetics analysis ) software [ 66 ] to analyze p - distance ( calculating the proportion of amino acid differences ) with the following parameters : complete deletion and considering a bootstrap value of 1000 replicates .
the other settings were given as default by the program .
quantitative reverse transcription real time pcr in order to quantify the gene expression level of goldfish pax2a _ tv2 in the onh during regeneration by rt - qpcr assays , we used the rna samples retrotranscribed into cdna samples obtained from the onh of 3 control goldfish pooled and 3 cryolesioned animals pooled from 2 to 90 d post - lesion .
goldfish ef1alpha and 18 s rrna endogenous genes were used as housekeeping genes [ 67 ] .
primers for qpcr ( table 2 ) were designed based on the pax2a _ tv2 sequence obtained by us and on the available sequence for goldfish ef1alpha gene in the genebank database ( table 2 ) , with the help of oligoperfect ( tm ) designer software ( invitrogen ) ; 18 s rrna primer sequences were taken from cid [ 54 ] .
qpcrs were performed using the sybr - green method with a 2x master mix ( applied biosystems ) .
each reaction contained 10 microl of master mix , 0.4 microl of each pair of primers ( table 2 ) , 1 - 3 microl of each cdna sample in a different serial cdna quantity for each gene , and milliq water up to 20 microl .
the amplification reaction took place in an abi prism 7300 detection system ( applied biosystems ) , with the following conditions : 10 min at 95degreesc followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95degreesc and 1 min at 60 - 63degreesc depending on each pair of primers .
three pcr reactions were performed for each sample per plate , and each experiment was repeated twice .
the comparative threshold cycle ( ct ) method was used for presenting quantitative data [ 68 ] .
following the removal of outliers , raw fluorescence data were used to determine the pcr amplification efficiency ( e ) according to the formula e = [ 10 ( - 1 / slope ) - 1 ]* 100 .
all amplifications had an e value of 100 +/ - 10 % the e value close to 100 % being an indicator of efficient amplification .
the relative gene expression value (" fold change ") for each transcript was calculated according to the equation e - ( deltact " condition 1 " - deltact " condition 2 ") , where " condition 1 " corresponds to experimental samples ( 1 - 90 d ) , " condition 2 " to samples of control animals and deltact of each " condition " is ct " experimental gene " - ct " endogenous gene " [ 68 ] , [ 69 ] .
a standard error for each relative gene expression value was calculated as a measure of data variation .
one - way anova and subsequent post hoc dunnett 's t - test were applied to establish the statistical significance of differences .

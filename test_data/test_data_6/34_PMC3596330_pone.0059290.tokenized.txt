testing cardiac gene and cell therapies in vitro requires a tissue substrate that survives for several days in culture while maintaining its physiological properties .
the purpose of this study was to test whether culture of intact cardiac tissue of neonatal rat ventricles ( organ explant culture ) may be used as a model to study gene and cell therapy .
we compared ( immuno ) histology and electrophysiology of organ explant cultures to both freshly isolated neonatal rat ventricular tissue and monolayers .
( immuno ) histologic studies showed that organ explant cultures retained their fiber orientation , and that expression patterns of alpha - actinin , connexin - 43 , and alpha - smooth muscle actin did not change during culture .
intracellular voltage recordings showed that spontaneous beating was rare in organ explant cultures ( 20 %) and freshly isolated tissue ( 17 %) , but common ( 82 %) in monolayers .
accordingly , resting membrane potential was - 83.9 +/ - 4.4 mv in organ explant cultures , - 80.5 +/ - 3.5 mv in freshly isolated tissue , and - 60.9 +/ - 4.3 mv in monolayers .
conduction velocity , measured by optical mapping , was 18.2 +/ - 1.0 cm / s in organ explant cultures , 18.0 +/ - 1.2 cm / s in freshly isolated tissue , and 24.3 +/ - 0.7 cm / s in monolayers .
we found no differences in action potential duration ( apd ) between organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue , while apd of monolayers was prolonged ( apd at 70 % repolarization 88.8 +/ - 7.8 , 79.1 +/ - 2.9 , and 134.0 +/ - 4.5 ms , respectively ) .
organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue could be paced up to frequencies within the normal range for neonatal rat ( cl 150 ms ) , while monolayers could not .
successful lentiviral ( lv ) transduction was shown via egfp gene transfer .
co - culture of organ explant cultures with spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes increased the occurrence of spontaneous beating activity of organ explant cultures to 86 % .
we conclude that organ explant cultures of neonatal rat ventricle are structurally and electrophysiologically similar to freshly isolated tissue and a suitable new model to study the effects of gene and cell therapy .

introduction new therapies for various cardiovascular diseases are currently being developed with a focus on gene and cell therapy .
for gene therapy , lentiviruses are attractive vectors because they are capable of transducing non - replicating cells [ 1 ] ( e.g. , cardiomyocytes ) , stably integrating the gene of interest into the host genome [ 2 ] , and carrying relatively large genes [ 3 ] .
the expression of lentivirally - transduced genes requires several days .
this time is needed to allow the viral mrna to be reverse transcribed into dna , which is required for subsequent integration and expression .
evaluating the effects of cell therapy may also require several days [ 4 ] .
experimental models to test gene and cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases should therefore replicate the in vivo situation over a period of at least days .
although this may be achieved via animal studies , these studies have important drawbacks , including their high cost and labor intensity .
therefore , suitable in vitro models are important , especially as an initial strategy screening tool .
while current in vitro models , such as cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes , provide the opportunity of testing cells over 1 - 2 weeks , important properties of the in vivo situation are lost in this system .
for instance , neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes cultured in a syncytium ( monolayer ) show a flat , star - shaped morphology instead of the normal rod - like shape , along with a reduction in peak transient outward current , sodium current , and calcium current [ 5 ] .
furthermore , these cells display a depolarized resting membrane potential ( rmp ) , a reduced action potential upstroke velocity , and spontaneous beating [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
these properties are correlated to the loss of i k1 [ 8 ] and the number of myofibroblasts present in these cultures [ 9 ] .
miragoli et al. described a fast phenotypic switch from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts when in culture [ 10 ] .
these myofibroblasts expressed both connexin - 43 and connexin - 45 at contact sites between each other and with cardiomyocytes .
since myofibroblast have a more depolarized membrane potential , coupling between myocyte and myofibroblast is believed to induce depolarization in the cardiomyocyte , thereby causing depolarization - induced automaticity [ 11 ] .
several studies describe methods to limit the changes due to cell culturing , including anisotropic growth and the use of pharmacologic agents and cell separation to reduce the number of ( myo ) fibroblasts [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] .
however , a 3 - dimensional system would still be preferable over a 2 - dimensional cell culture for various reasons , including differences in gene expression , regulation of cell growth and fibroblast morphology [ 13 ] .
furthermore , the 3 - dimensional structure more closely resembles the in vivo situation and may be particularly relevant when studying electrical phenomena such as current - to - load mismatch [ 14 ] .
clearly , the development of a 3 - dimensional cardiac in vitro model that remains viable for several days , yet maintains its electrophysiologic properties , is crucial to reliably study various gene - and cell - based therapies .
previous studies have reported on short - term culturing of cardiac tissue slices .
however , extensive electrophysiologic characterization after several days is lacking from these reports [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] .
therefore , in the present study , we investigated the ( immuno ) histologic and electrophysiologic properties of 6 - 8 days old cultured intact cardiac tissue ( organ explant culture ) .
we compared outcomes to both freshly isolated cardiac tissue and to monolayers to address the following questions .
( 1 ) are organ explant cultures viable for 6 - 8 days ?
( 2 ) how do the ( immuno ) histologic and electrophysiologic properties differ among these in vitro systems ?
( 3 ) can organ explant cultures be transduced by lentiviral vectors ?
( 4 ) can organ explant cultures functionally couple to spontaneously beating neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ?
materials and methods 2.1 preparation of organ explant cultures and monolayers all animal experiments were approved by the local animal experiments committee ( academic medical center , university of amsterdam ; dca102499 ) and carried out in accordance with national and institutional guidelines .
organ explant cultures to obtain organ explant cultures , 2 - day old wistar rats ( charles river ) were decapitated , and hearts were excised and stored in cold hbss ( gibco , # 14025 ) .
atria were removed and ventricles were separated into right ventricle , left ventricle , and septum .
we either used these explants immediately for electrophysiologic studies or immunohistochemistry , or cultured them , endocardial side down , on drained collagen gels [ 18 ] .
organ cultures and gels were placed in an incubator at 37degreesc and 5 % co2 .
organ cultures were left untreated overnight to allow for attachment to the gel , after which complete m199 medium ( gibco , # 31150 ) was added , containing ( mm ) nacl 117 , kcl 5.3 , cacl2 1.8 , mgso4 0.8 , nahco3 26.2 , and na2hpo4 1.0 , supplemented with 1 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin 100x ( gibco , # 15140 - 122 ) , 5 mug / ml insulin , 5 mug / ml transferrin , 5 ng / ml selenium ( its , collaborative research inc. , # 40351 ) , and 2 mm l - glutamine ( gibco , # 25030 - 081 ) .
this medium , now called organ explant medium , was changed after 4 days and we conducted electrophysiologic and ( immuno ) histologic characterization after 6 - 8 days .
monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to obtain monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes we used previously described protocols [ 19 ] .
briefly , after excision of the hearts and removal of the atria , ventricles were dissected into 4 - 6 fragments , which were left to rotate overnight at 4degreesc in hbss ( gibco , # 14170 ) without ca2 + and mg2 + but containing trypsin ( 1 mg / ml , usb , # 22720 ) .
the next day , after inactivation of trypsin with culture medium , cells were dissociated in three steps in hbss containing collagenase ( 1 mg / ml , worthington # 4176 , 315 units / mg ) at 37degreesc .
dissociation solutions were centrifuged and cells were resuspended in 10 % culture medium .
to separate fibroblasts from cardiomyocytes , cells were preplated for 2 hours in tissue - culture treated polystyrene t175 cell culture flasks at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 .
after two hours , non - adherent cells were collected and plated ( 0.6x106 cells on 22 mm o fibronectin ( bd biosciences , # 356009 ) coated glass coverslips ) .
neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were cultured at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 in monolayer medium , consisting of m199 ( gibco , # 31150 ) containing ( mm ) nacl 117 , kcl 5.3 , cacl2 1.8 , mgso4 0.8 , nahco3 26.2 , and na2hpo4 1.0 , supplemented with 1 % hepes ( gibco , # 15630 - 080 ) , 5000 u / l penicillin - g ( sigma , # p7794 ) , 2 mg / l vitamin b12 ( sigma , # v2876 ) , 3,5 g / l glucose , 1 % non essential amino acids ( gibco , # 11140 - 050 ) , 1 % l - glutamine ( gibco , # 25030 - 081 ) , and either 10 % ( until day 3 ) or 2 % ( from day 3 ) fetal bovine serum ( gibco , # 16140071 ) .
also , several monolayers were cultured in organ explant medium to exclude an effect of culture medium composition on electrophysiologic characteristics .
we conducted electrophysiologic and ( immuno ) histologic characterization after 6 - 8 days .
2.2 histology after embedding freshly isolated tissue and organ explant cultures in tissue - tek o.c.t ( sakura , # 4583 ) , 10 mum thick sections were cut by microtome and stored at - 20degreesc .
for fixation of monolayers , glass coverslips with cells attached were washed with pbs twice and then covered in methanol ( - 20degreesc ) for 2 minutes .
subsequently , the coverslips were washed with pbs 3 times .
fixed monolayers were kept at 4degreesc .
he staining for hematoxylin - eosin ( he ) staining , tissue sections were thawed for 2 hrs and fixed in 4 % pfa for 10 minutes .
afterwards , both the fixed sections and the previously fixed monolayers were washed with distilled h2o , stained with hematoxylin ( sigma ) for 5 minutes , washed with h2o , and stained with eosin ( sigma ) for 30 seconds .
after washing with h2o , the preparations were shortly rinsed with 70 % ethanol , 96 % ethanol and 100 % ethanol , after which they were left in xylol ( bufa ) for 5 minutes and mounted with pertex ( histolab ) .
immunohistologic staining for immunohistochemistry , tissue sections , after thawing for 2 hrs , were rehydrated in pbs ( lonza , # be17 - 516f ) for 5 minutes .
monolayers were already stored in pbs .
afterwards , 0.2 % triton x - 100 ( sigma , # t8787 ) in pbs was added for 1 hr to increase permeability of the cell membrane .
after 4 washes with pbs , 2 % bsa ( mp biomed ) in pbs was added for 30 minutes .
the primary antibody , dissolved in pbs containing 10 % normal goat serum ( gibco , # 16210 - 064 ) , was left to incubate overnight .
the next day , sections were washed with pbs .
tissue sections were incubated with secondary antibodies and nucleic acid staining ( diluted in pbs containing 10 % normal goat serum ) for 2 hours .
sections were sealed with glycerol : pbs ( 1:1 ) and stored at 4degreesc .
primary antibodies used are anti - connexin - 43 mouse monoclonal ( 1:100 ; bd transduction ; # 610061 ) , anti - alpha - smooth muscle actin mouse monoclonal ( 1:1000 ; sigma , # a2547 ) , anti - alpha - actinin mouse monoclonal ( 1:1000 ; sigma ; # a7811 ) .
secondary antibodies used were alexa - fluor antibodies diluted 1:250 , nuclear staining used was sytox orange ( invitrogen ; # s11368 , 1:1000 ) .
the specificity of secondary antibodies was verified by incubating control sections with secondary antibodies only .
sections treated this way did not show any non - specific staining .
2.3 intracellular recordings to assess rmp , intracellular microelectrode recordings were made of tissue and cell cultures at 37degreesc in tyrode 's solution , which contained ( mm ) nacl 140 , kcl 5.4 mm , cacl2 1.8 , mgcl2 1.0 , glucose 5.5 , hepes 5.0 ( ph 7.4 with naoh ) .
microelectrodes were filled with 3 m kcl , and tip resistance was 15 - 35 momega .
a reference electrode was placed in the tissue bath .
action potentials were recorded at 16 khz using a data acquisition system ( biosemi actiview ) , and analyzed using custom - made software based on matlab ( mathworks ) .
we characterized tissue by ( 1 ) the presence of spontaneous beating activity , ( 2 ) the presence of phase 4 depolarization , defined as a diastolic depolarization rate of at least 5 mv / s measured over the 50 ms interval starting at the maximal diastolic potential ( mdp ) , and ( 3 ) mdp or rmp ( mdp in case of preparations showing phase 4 depolarization ; rmp in case of quiescent tissue ) .
action potential amplitude , action potential duration ( apd ) , and upstroke velocity were not measured due to difficulty keeping the microelectrode intracellular during contraction , especially in organ cultures .
2.4 optical mapping to assess conduction velocity ( cv ) and action potential properties , optical mapping of tissue and cell cultures was done .
after exposure to 15 mum di - 4 - anepps ( invitrogen , # d1199 ) in ebss ( gibco , # 24010 ) for 7.5 minutes , explants were placed in an optical mapping set - up in tyrode 's solution ( 37.0 +/ - 0.5degreesc ) containing ( mm ) nacl 140 , kcl 5.4 mm , cacl2 1.8 , mgcl2 1.0 , glucose 5.5 , hepes 5.0 ( ph 7.4 with naoh ) and blebbistatin 10 mumol / l ( tocris bioscience , # 1760 ) .
six power light emitting diodes ( 5 w per diode , band - pass filtered 510 +/ - 20 nm ) delivered excitation light .
emission fluorescence ( filtered > 610 nm ) was transmitted through a tandem lens system on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip ( micam ultima ) with a spatial resolution of 100x100 pixels .
data acquisition was carried out with a sample frequency of 1 khz for freshly isolated tissue and organ explant cultures , and 0.5 khz for monolayers ( because of lower fluorescence intensity in monolayers ) .
data were analyzed using custom made software based on matlab ( mathworks ) .
we characterized tissue by ( 1 ) the presence of spontaneous beating activity , ( 2 ) cv , ( 3 ) anisotropy ratio , ( 4 ) maximal upstroke velocity , ( 5 ) apd at 20 % , 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % repolarization ( apd20 , apd50 , apd70 , apd90 ) , and ( 6 ) the ability to stimulate tissue at different cycle lengths ( cls ) varying from 500 ms to 100 ms. cv and maximal upstroke velocity were measured at a pacing cl of 500 ms. cv was calculated from activation times - based on time of maximal upstroke velocity - recorded at 2 sites along a line perpendicular to the isochronal lines , when stimulated at 2 times stimulation threshold at a cycle length of 500 ms. the anisotropy ratio was defined as maximal cv divided by cv measured perpendicular to maximal cv. maximal upstroke velocity was determined in normalized action potentials - baseline was set to 0 and maximal amplitude to 100 - and defined as the maximal rise in percentage of action potential amplitude per ms ( d (% apa )/ dtmax ) .
because of the lower sample frequency , this could not be measured in monolayers .
2.5 gene and cell therapy a lentiviral egfp expression vector ( prrl - cppt - cmv - x2 - ires - egfp - pre - sin lentiviral transfer vector , from here on called lv - egfp ) was made as described previously [ 20 ] .
virus was produced via cotransfection of hek293t cells , and titrated by detection of egfp expression 3 days after transduction of hela cells .
to test the feasibility of gene transfer we injected virus lv - egfp ( 1x106 iu ) into organ explant cultures at day 0 , before attachment of the tissue to the gel , in the presence of dextran ( 10 mug / ml ; sigma , # d9885 ) .
after overnight incubation , we added complete m199 medium .
to test the utility of cell therapy , freshly isolated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were seeded on top of one - day old organ explant cultures ( 0.3x106 cells per explant ) to form a spontaneously beating confluent monolayer .
spontaneous beating of organ explant cultures was measured via microelectrode measurements and optical mapping .
2.6 statistical analysis data are presented as mean +/ - sem .
statistical tests used include student 's t - test and one - way anova for normally distributed continuous data and pearson 's chi - squared test or fisher 's exact test for categorical data .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
spss 18 was used for statistical analysis .
results 3.1 histology hematoxylin - eosin ( he ) stained organ explant cultures had a more loose tissue structure than freshly isolated tissue , but maintained a longitudinal fiber orientation .
in contrast , monolayers did not show a longitudinal fiber orientation ( figure 1a ) .
immunohistochemistry for the cytoskeletal protein alpha - actinin , which is localized to the z - discs , showed a striated pattern in all groups ( figure 1b ) .
also , immunostaining for the gap - junction protein connexin - 43 showed a similar pattern in all 3 groups , i.e. , localization not only to the intercalated discs , but along all cell borders ( figure 1c ) .
expression of alpha - smooth muscle actin , a marker for myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells , was abundantly present throughout the whole preparation in monolayers , while this was not the case in both freshly isolated tissue and organ explants cultures .
in the example of freshly isolated tissue shown in figure 1d , alpha - smooth muscle actin was present in vascular smooth muscle cells .

3.2 intracellular recordings table 1 shows results from microelectrode measurements ; figure 2 depicts typical examples of stimulated action potentials when stimulated at 500 ms cl. twenty percent of organ explant cultures ( n = 10 ; 4 left ventricle , 3 right ventricle , 3 septum ) showed spontaneous beating activity .
this proportion was similar to freshly isolated tissue ( 17 % [ n = 6 ; 2 left ventricle , 2 right ventricle , 2 septum ] , p = ns ) .
in contrast , 82 % of monolayers ( n = 17 ) beat spontaneously ( p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ) .
accordingly , we observed phase 4 depolarization in 20 % of measurements in organ explant cultures , never in freshly isolated tissue , and in 67 % of the monolayers ( p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ) .

similar to intracellular recordings , the proportion of spontaneous beating activity of organ explant cultures was comparably low as in freshly isolated tissue ( 36 % [ n = 22 ; 7 left ventricle , 7 right ventricle , 8 septum ] and 33 % [ n = 12 ; 4 left ventricle , 4 right ventricle , 4 septum ] , respectively , p = ns ) , but much higher in monolayers ( 89 % [ n = 26 ] , p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ) .
in spontaneously beating preparations , cycle length did not differ between organ explant cultures , freshly isolated tissue and monolayers ( 468 +/ - 97 ms , 677 +/ - 85 and 582 +/ - 60 ms , respectively ) .

electrical conduction remained anisotropic in organ explant cultures ( anisotropy ratio 2.5 +/ - 0.1 ) , similar to freshly isolated tissue ( 2.1 +/ - 0.2 , p = ns ) , while conduction in monolayers was isotropic ( 1.2 +/ - 0.04 , p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ) .

while apd20 , apd50 , apd70 , and apd90 did not differ between organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue ( 33.6 +/ - 4.0 , 35.0 +/ - 2.9 for apd20 ; 65.8 +/ - 6.5 , 61.5 +/ - 2.8 for apd50 ; 88.8 +/ - 7.8 , 79.1 +/ - 2.9 for apd70 ; and 116.8 +/ - 10.9 and 107.5 +/ - 9.8 ms for apd90 , respectively ) , apd70 and apd90 were increased in monolayers ( 134.0 +/ - 4.5 and 230.8 +/ - 9.5 ms ; p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ; figure 4a ) .

when stimulated at 500 , 400 and 300 ms cl , all groups showed similar capture rates ( n = 15 organ explant cultures , n = 10 freshly isolated tissue , n = 26 monolayers ; figure 4c ) .
when stimulated at 200 ms cl , only 54 % of monolayers were captured , as compared to 100 % of organ explant cultures and 100 % of freshly isolated tissue ( p < 0.05 vs. both other groups ) .
this difference was more prominent at shorter cls , e.g. , at 150 ms ( 93 % of organ explant cultures , 100 % of freshly isolated tissue , 8 % of monolayers ) and at 100 ms ( 40 % of organ explant cultures , 60 % of freshly isolated tissue , 8 % of monolayers ) .
we further established that the composition of the culture medium was not of influence on monolayer characteristics ( figure 5 ) .
monolayers grown in organ explant medium ( n = 10 ) showed electrophysiologic characteristics similar to monolayers grown in monolayer medium ( n = 9 ) .
both groups showed a high occurrence of spontaneous beating activity ( 89 % vs 90 %) , similar cl of spontaneous beating activity ( 399 +/ - 37 vs 479 +/ - 86 ) , and no differences in cv , apd , and capture when stimulated at different cls ( all p = ns ) .

3.4 gene and cell therapy after establishing that electrophysiologic and histologic properties of organ explant cultures were highly comparable with freshly isolated tissue , we next tested how well organ explant cultures were suitable for lentiviral gene transfer .
injection of lv - egfp into the center of organ explant cultures ( n = 4 ) resulted in expression of egfp at the site of injection ( figure 6a ) .

finally , we investigated whether organ explant cultures may be useful in evaluating the effects of cell therapy , by testing their capability to couple to other cardiomyocytes .
here we found the addition of 0.3x106 spontaneously active neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to increase the percentage of spontaneously beating organ explant cultures to 86 % ( cl 605.8 +/ - 70.8 ms ; figure 6b ) .
in comparison , above reported unmodified organ explant cultures exhibited spontaneous beating only in 28 % ( n = 32 ) of the samples ( p < 0.05 ) .
figure 6c shows a typical example of an isochronal activation map , with spontaneous beating originating from the monolayer of isolated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes , with capture of the organ explant culture .
discussion interpretation of the results from in vitro studies on gene therapies in culture models of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes is often confounded by the occurrence of a partial loss of the native physiologic properties .
in the present study , we investigated whether a new in vitro model of long - term organ explant culture retained its in vivo properties , and whether this model is suitable for studying gene - and cell - based therapies .
using ( immuno ) histochemical and electrophysiologic analysis , we demonstrated that long - term heart organ explant cultures were viable up to 8 days in culture , while still retaining multiple critical properties of freshly isolated cardiac tissue .
cardiomyocytes in organ explant culture retained their longitudinal fiber orientation , while expression patterns of the structural proteins alpha - actinin , connexin - 43 , and alpha - smooth muscle actin were similar to freshly isolated cardiac tissue .
also , the electrophysiologic properties were largely preserved in organ explant cultures .
as in freshly isolated cardiac tissue , most of the cultures did not show spontaneous beating activity and had stable rmp of approximately - 85 mv. in addition , cv , anisotropy ratio , maximal upstroke velocity , and apd were unaltered .
in comparison , alterations in ( electro ) physiologic properties in monolayers were more pronounced .
immunoreactivity for alpha - smooth muscle actin was abundantly present throughout monolayers , indicative for the presence of myofibroblasts .
moreover , monolayers often beat spontaneously , and showed a depolarized rmp , an increased presence of slow diastolic depolarization , a loss of anisotropic conduction , and a prolonged apd as compared to freshly isolated tissue .
also , while organ explant cultures could be paced at frequencies similar to freshly isolated tissue , monolayers were more frequently not captured at short cls .
finally , we demonstrated that organ explant cultures can be transduced with lv - egfp ( inferred from the expression of egfp ) , and are capable of functional coupling to spontaneously beating neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes .
origin of alpha - smooth muscle actin expression in monolayers the expression of alpha - smooth muscle actin in organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue is related to the presence of smooth muscles in the vasculature [ 21 ] .
in monolayers , the origin of the alpha - smooth muscle actin is less clear .
while recent reports suggest that this is due to the presence of myofibroblasts [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , it could also be the result of dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes , since alpha - smooth muscle actin is also temporarily expressed in fetal rat cardiomyocytes [ 22 ] .
zhang et al. have shown that cultured cardiomyocytes can dedifferentiate and express early transcription factors , but they did not investigate the expression of alpha - smooth muscle actin in these cells [ 23 ] .
in vivo , the expression of alpha - smooth muscle actin in both adult cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts has been described in cardiac diseases such as atrial fibrillation and right ventricular pressure overload [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
myofibroblasts , mdp , and spontaneous activity several studies investigated the effects of different amounts of ( myo ) fibroblasts on mdp and spontaneous beating activity of monolayers [ 10 ] , [ 26 ] .
in these studies a preplating step was used to separate fibroblasts from cardiomyocytes , and bromodeoxyuridine was added to influence the growth of ( myo ) fibroblasts present in culture .
miragoli et al. described a decrease in mdp from approximately - 80 mv to - 50 mv when the amount of myofibroblasts increased .
in that study , experiments were performed in 3 - 4 days old preparations .
since we want to use our model to further study the effect of lentiviral gene transfer after 6 days , we tried to decrease the number of myofibroblasts this way .
however , in our experience , decreasing the amount of ( myo ) fibroblasts via preplating and bromodeoxyuridine was only effective for a limited amount of time .
alternatively , pharmacologic interventions such as cytochalasin d or latrunculin b have been shown to disturb actin function , restore membrane potential and stop spontaneous beating in cell pairs of myofibroblasts and neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes [ 12 ] .
yet , we did not attempt to use this type of interventions as they do not prevent abundant presence of myofibroblasts and membrane potentials remain relatively depolarized at approximately - 74 mv. another factor that can contribute to spontaneous beating in cultured cells is a decreased inward rectifier current ( ik1 ) , which has been shown in both adult rat and rabbit ventricular myocytes [ 8 ] , [ 27 ] .
this progressive decrease in ik1 was correlated to a depolarization of the rmp , and could thus also influence the occurrence of spontaneous beating .
even in the absence of myofibroblast and with a rmp of approximately - 84 mv , some of the organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissues showed spontaneous beating activity .
spontaneous beating was observed in some preparations where we did not detect phase 4 depolarization .
this likely occurred in settings where the impalement site was not at the origin of spontaneous membrane depolarization .
we showed that the beating activity in organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue did not originate from the dissection border of the tissue , excluding tissue damage as a causative factor in our preparations .
since part of the conduction system is still present in freshly isolated tissue and organ explant cultures , it is possible that spontaneous beating originated from these cells .
conduction velocity cv of freshly isolated tissue was relatively low ( 18.2 +/ - 1.0 cm / s ) compared to reported values for adult rat ventricle ( 66 +/ - 8 cm / s ) [ 28 ] .
only few papers have reported cv in neonatal rat heart [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] , and showed values ranging from 21 cm / s in 2 - day old rats to 31 cm / s in 10 - day old rats .
this increase in cv with increasing age was found in several species [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
we found that cv in monolayers was higher than in organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue .
this was somewhat surprising , given the fact that organ explant cultures had electrophysiologic properties and tissue architecture that were more favorable ( i.e. , conducive to high cv ) than monolayers .
cv has multiple determinants , whose net contributions are difficult to predict .
for instance , fiber direction , a determinant of cv [ 34 ] , appears more favorable for organ explant cultures than monolayers , as longitudinal cell orientation ( associated with large cv in the longitudinal direction ) was preserved in organ explant cultures , but not in monolayers .
paradoxically , tissue geometry may also provide a potential cause for the lower cv in organ explant cultures .
since a monolayer is a 2 - dimensional network , the activation wavefront must travel in a horizontal plane , i.e. , the plane that is measured by optical mapping .
however , in organ explant cultures , the loose 3 - dimensional tissue structure may give rise to activation wavefronts that travel outside the planes of optical measurement .
in that case , the cv will be underestimated .
another factor that can influence cv is the magnitude of the upstroke velocity [ 35 ] .
however , since the sample time was 2 ms in optical mapping of monolayers , we could not measure upstroke velocity and compare this to organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue , as these were mapped with a sample time of 1 ms. a possible contributor to higher cv in monolayers may be larger cell size .
while we did not quantify cell surface area , in both he staining and immunohistochemistry , cell surface area in monolayers appeared to be larger , which may partly explain larger cv [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
a final determinant of cv to consider is cell - to - cell coupling [ 36 ] .
however , this determinant is not likely to explain differences in cv , as connexin - 43 expression was similar in all groups ; being distributed along all cell borders , instead of being localized to the intercalated discs as in adult tissue [ 38 ] .
we did not investigate cx45 expression and therefore cannot rule out potential differences among the individual groups .
although the presence and role of connexin - 45 during embryonic development have been well established [ 39 ] , its role in neonatal and adult tissue seems limited , as it has consistently been found in very low quantities in both neonatal and adult heart [ 40 ] - [ 42 ] .
furthermore , in cell pairs of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes there is a linear correlation between gap junction conductance and connexin - 43 immunosignal [ 43 ] .
we therefore like to suggest that potential differences in connexin - 45 are unlikely to explain the differences in cv in our study .
nevertheless , if there is a difference in expression of connexin - 45 in monolayers as compared to freshly isolated tissue and organ explants cultures , this could influence cv , as mixed channels containing both connexin - 43 and - 45 have a lower channel conductance [ 44 ] - [ 46 ] .
this lower gap junction conductance is expected to decrease cv [ 47 ] .
while cv is higher in monolayers than organ explant cultures , freshly isolated tissue has a similar cv to organ explant cultures , which leads us to believe that the organ explant cultures in this study showed a cv within the normal range for neonatal rat ventricular tissue .
action potential duration the apds of freshly isolated neonatal rat ventricle and monolayers reported vary between different studies , and the values as reported in this paper are consistent with previously published studies [ 48 ] - [ 50 ] .
the prolonged apd seen in monolayers as compared to freshly isolated tissue can be explained by their depolarized mdp .
due to this depolarization , both the transient outward current ( ito ) and the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current ( ikr ) are inactivated more strongly [ 51 ] - [ 53 ] .
the resulting decrease in repolarizing currents is expected to prolong apd .
bursac and colleagues indeed showed that blocking ito with 4 - aminopyridine in freshly isolated tissue strongly increased the apd , while blocking ito had no effect on the apd in monolayers [ 49 ] .
stimulation at different cycle lengths often properties of monolayers are studied at a 2 hz pacing rate .
since neonatal rat hearts beat at around 350 beats per minute ( cl ~ 170 ms ; [ 54 ] , [ 55 ]) , we also investigated capture at shorter cls .
while both organ explant cultures and freshly isolated tissue could still be paced with a cl of 150 ms , capture was frequently lost in monolayers at cls of around 200 ms. this finding is in accordance with the longer apd found in monolayers .
conclusion in conclusion , we developed a method of organ explant culture that provides an in vitro model of cardiac tissue that is structurally and electrophysiologically similar to freshly isolated tissue .
in accordance with its tissue architecture , ( near ) absence of spontaneous beating and myofibroblasts render this model superior to the well established model of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes cultured in monolayer .
because the cultured organ explant model also appeared readily modified by methods of gene and cell therapy , this model may offer a powerful screening tool for the evaluation of biological approaches aimed at treatment of cardiovascular disease .

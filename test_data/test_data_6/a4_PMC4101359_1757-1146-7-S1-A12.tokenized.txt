furthermore , foot orthoses ( fos ) are also recognized for their actions on the dynamics of the foot [ 4 ] but not for their actions on an isolated subtalar arthrodesis ( isa ) .
previous studies have shown that depending on the type of fos [ 5 ] and along the comfort felt by the subject [ 6 ] , the variations induced by different fos were significantly different .
the aim of this study was to compare the effects of different types of fos on gait analysis with an isa .
two subjects with isa were volunteers for one session of three repeated measures : without fos ( control ) , with classical fos ( fosc ) and with molded fos ( fosm ) .
after a clinical examination , these two types of fos are custom - made including same posting .
we compared walking variations through the latero - medial index ( lmi ) on force platform .
four data 's have been compared : latero - medial force index ( lmfi ) , latero - medial area index ( lmai ) together with observation of these index at 100ms which correlate with hind foot activity phase during walking [ 7 ] .
the perception of comfort was evaluated by using previously established footwear comfort measures [ 6 ] : 100mm visual analog scale ( vas ) .
results using the vas , subjects did n't feel a real comfort in shoes without fos ( vas = 47,5mm ) .
fos increased vas (> 17,9mm ) .
thus , fosm were perceived as significantly more comfortable than fosc , respectively 97mm and 65,5mm .
dynamics assessment showed the isa and control foot had same lmi except for the lmai .
lmai observed at 100ms , fosc induce pronation on both hind feet while fosm induce wider lateral contact ( figure 1 ) .
lmfi showed fosc produced an asymmetrical ground reaction force between isa and control foot .
for lmfi at 100ms , the difference increased with fosc , which induced a higher supination of the isa and a pronation of the control hind foot .
fosm reduced this difference increasing both supination ( figure 2 ) .
figure 1 lmai at 100ms and vas figure 2 lmfi at 100ms and vas conclusions fos induced effects on the gait of subjects with isa depending on orthoses type and parameters observed .
the comfort is significantly improved by fos and much more by fosm .
the data suggests no correlations between linear improvement of vas and variations of lmi .
however , a wider lateral contact and a greater lateral excursion of ground reaction force on the hind foot during walking could induce greater comfort of patients with isa .

background pim ( proviral insertion in murine lymphoma ) kinases are a small family of constitutively active , highly conservative serine / threonine oncogenic kinases and have 3 members : pim1 , pim2 , and pim3 .
pim kinases are also implicated in the regulation of b - and t - cell responses to cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors .
the roles of pim kinases in the regulation of primitive hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) are largely unknown .
methods in the current study , pim1 - / - 2 - / - 3 - / - triple knockout ( tko ) mice were used to determine the role of pim kinases in hematopoiesis .
peripheral blood hematological parameters were measured in pim tko mice and age - matched wild - type ( wt ) controls .
primary , secondary , and competitive transplantations were performed to assay the long - term repopulating hscs in pim tko mice .
in vivo brdu incorporation assay and ex vivo ki67 staining and caspase 3 labeling were performed to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis of hscs in pim tko mice .
results compared to age - matched wt controls , pim tko mice had lower peripheral blood platelet count and exhibited erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis .
the bone marrow cells from pim tko mice demonstrated decreased hematopoietic progenitor colony - forming ability .
importantly , pim tko bone marrow cells had significantly impaired capacity in rescuing lethally irradiated mice and reconstituting hematopoiesis in primary , secondary and competitive transplant models .
in vivo brdu incorporation in long - term hscs was reduced in pim tko mice .
finally , cultured hscs from pim tko mice showed reduced proliferation evaluated by ki67 staining and higher rate of apoptosis via caspase 3 activation .
conclusions pim kinases are not only essential in the hematopoietic lineage cell development , but also important in hsc expansion , self - renewal , and long - term repopulation .
serine / threonine kinase pim kinase hematopoietic stem cells hematopoietic stem cell transplantation proliferation apoptosis knockout mouse background pim1 , pim2 and pim3 belong to a small family of serine / threonine protein kinases and are evolutionarily conserved in multicellular organisms .
pim1 and pim2 were originally identified from cloning the retroviral integration sites in murine moloney leukemia virus ( mulv ) - induced lymphomas [ 1,2 ] .
pim3 was identified through high throughput retroviral tagging in tumors of c - myc transgenic mice deficient for pim1 and pim2 [ 3 ] .
although pim kinase genes are located on different chromosomes , they encode proteins with a high degree of sequence homology [ 4,5 ] .
additionally , the functions and expression patterns of pim kinases overlap significantly with each other [ 4,6,7 ] .
for example , pim3 can compensate for the loss of pim1 and pim2 in mulv - induced lymphomagenesis [ 3 ] .
emumyc - emupim2 double transgenic mice develop b cell lymphoid tumors similar to those seen in emumyc - emupim1 double transgenic mice [ 8,9 ] .
pim kinases are constitutively active and play an important role in tumor cell cycle regulation and in cancer cell survival [ 5 ] .
over the last two decades , several genetically modified mice were generated to facilitate the studies of the functional roles of pim kinases .
these animal models included emu - pim1 transgenic mice [ 8 ] , pim1 - / - single knockout ( ko ) mice [ 10 ] , pim2 - / - single ko mice [ 11 ] , and pim1 - / - 2 - / - 3 - / - triple ko ( tko ) mice [ 4 ] .
pim1 - / - and pim2 - / - single ko mice do not show any anatomic or developmental defects likely in part due to the functional redundancy and overlap of pim kinases .
pim single or triple ko mice are all viable and show subtle hematological changes such as anemia , erythrocyte microcytosis , reduced peripheral t - and b - cell numbers , and impaired t - and b - cell responses to il - 2 , il - 3 and il - 7 stimulation [ 4,10 ] .
grundler , et al .
[ 12 ] recently found that pim1 was important in regulating the surface expression of cxcr4 chemokine receptor in hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) .
pim1 phosphorylates serine 339 of the intracellular domain of cxcr4 , a site critical for cxcr4 recycling [ 12 ] .
however , very little is known about the effects of pim kinases on hematopoiesis and the roles of pim kinases in the expansion and proliferation of primitive hscs .
we recently reported a quantitative real - time pcr - based technique for determination of donor cell engraftment in a competitive murine transplantation model [ 13 ] .
our pcr method measures the y chromosome specific gene , i.e. , zfy - 1 , and can be used for any strain of mouse transplantation models .
in the current study , we performed serial transplant experiments and competitive transplant experiments to analyze the hematopoietic phenotypes of pim tko mice .
we showed that pim tko hscs are deficient in self - renewal and long - term repopulation .
these defects are at least in part due to reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in the most primitive hsc compartment in pim tko mice .
results thrombocytopenia and erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis in pim tko mice to determine the effects of pim kinases on hematopoiesis , we first measured peripheral blood white blood cells , red blood cells , platelets and hemoglobin in 3 different age groups of pim tko mice ( i.e. , 1 - 2 months old , 2 - 4 months old and 6 - 7 months old ) .
sex - and age - matched wildtype ( wt ) control mice were used for comparison .
while the total white blood cell counts were comparable between pim tko mice and wt controls , the platelet count was significantly reduced in pim tko mice ( figure 1a , p < 0.01 ) .
consistent with previous reports with pim deficient mice [ 4,10,11 ] , pim tko mice exhibited erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis that was characterized by unchanged total hemoglobin level with increased red blood cell count ( figure 1b , 1st and 2nd panel ) .
the erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis was further confirmed by measuring the mean corpuscular volume ( mcv ) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( mch ) of red blood cells , both of which were significantly reduced in pim tko mice ( figure 1b , 3rd and 4th panel , p < 0.01 ) .
we then performed a detailed peripheral cell subset analysis that quantified the absolute number of peripheral gr - 1 + granulocytes , cd3 + t cells , cd4 + cells , cd8 + cells and b220 + b cells [ 14 ] .
compared to wt controls , pim tko mice had significantly lower number of cd3 + t cells , predominantly in the cd4 + t helper cell population ( figure 1c , p < 0.01 ) .
gr - 1 + granulocytes were also reduced in pim tko mice .
these results suggested that pim tko mice had impairment in multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells .
figure 1 reduced peripheral platelet counts and erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis in pim tko mice .
( a ) peripheral blood white blood cell count and platelet count .
( b ) peripheral blood hemoglobin , red blood cell count , mcv and mch .
peripheral blood samples were collected from 3 different age groups of pim tko mice and age - matched wt control mice .
peripheral hematological parameters were measured using scil abc plus hematology analyzer (** p < 0.01 ) .
group 1 : 1 - 2 months old ( n = 8 for pim tko mice ) ; group 2 : 2 - 4 months old ( n = 8 for pim tko mice ) ; group 3 : 6 - 7 months old ( n = 3 for pim tko mice ) .
( c ) peripheral blood cell subset analysis .
peripheral blood was obtained from 3 months old pim tko mice and age - matched wt controls , stained with various antibodies as described in the materials and methods , and analyzed by flow cytometry .
(* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
reduced hematopoietic stem / progenitor cell number and colony - forming units in pim tko mice pim tko mice were significantly smaller in size than heterozygous littermates [ 4 ] .
interestingly , when we measured the spleen weight and adjusted it to the total body weight , the pim tko mice still exhibited significant reduction in the spleen - to - body weight ratio .
the spleen - to - body weight ratio was reduced by half in pim tko mice compared to sex - and age - matched wt controls ( figure 2a , p < 0.01 ) .
additionally , pim tko mice had significantly lower number of total bone marrow cells ( measured from 2 femurs and 2 tibias of each mouse ) ( figure 2b , p < 0.05 ) .
total number of splenocytes was also reduced in pim tko mice in comparison to wt controls ( figure 2c , p < 0.01 ) .
these data suggested a broadly diminished hematopoietic compartment in pim tko mice .
figure 2 spleen weight , total bm cell number , and cfus in pim tko mice .
( a ) reduced spleen weight in pim tko mice .
spleens from pim tko mice and wt controls were isolated and weighted .
data shown are the percentage of spleen weight to total body weight ( n = 5 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
( b ) reduced total bone marrow cells in pim tko mice .
bone marrow cells from 2 femurs and 2 tibias were harvested from pim tko mice and age - matched wt mice , depleted of rbcs , and counted ( n = 7 , * p < 0.05 ) .
( c ) reduced total splenocytes in pim tko mice .
spleens from pim tko mice and age - matched wt mice were harvested , depleted of rbcs and counted ( n = 5 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
( d ) reduced cfus in pim tko mice .
bm cells were harvested from pim tko mice or wt controls and plated in methocult ( r ) gf 3434 ( 1x105 / dish in triplicate ) .
the numbers of cfus - gm , bfus - e and cfus - gemm were counted at day 7 , day 9 , and day 12 , respectively ( n = 4 , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
( e ) comparable percentages of lsk cells in pim tko mice .
rbc - depleted bm cells were analyzed for lsk cell population .
data shown represent fold change over wt controls ( n = 7 ) .
( f ) reduced absolute number of bm lsk cells in pim tko mice .
the absolute lsk cells were calculated by multiplying the total number of bm cells ( from 2 femurs and 2 tibias ) with the percentage of lsk cells ( n = 3 , * p < 0.05 data representative of 3 independent experiments ) .
( g ) unchanged percentage of lt - hscs , st - hscs , and mpps in pim tko mice .
bone marrow cells were harvested , depleted of rbcs and enriched for lin - cells using lineage depletion kit .
the enriched lin - cells were then stained with cd34 , cd135 , sca - 1 , and c - kit antibodies as described in the materials and methods .
data represent fold changes over wt control mice ( n = 5 ) .
we next performed in vitro colony - forming unit ( cfu ) assay to determine the frequency of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ( hspcs ) in the bone marrow ( bm ) of pim tko mice .
as shown in figure 2d , cfus - granulocyte / macrophage ( cfus - gm ) , burst - forming units - erythrocyte ( bfus - e ) , and cfus - granulocyte , erythrocyte , monocyte , and megakaryocyte ( cfus - gemm ) were significantly reduced in pim tko mice , demonstrating reduced clonogenic activity of hspcs in pim tko mice .
we also measured the percentage and absolute number of lin - sca - 1 + c - kit + ( lsk ) cells in bm ( figure 2e ) .
lsk cells virtually account for all hspcs in mice .
we found that the percentage of lsk cells in the bm of pim tko mice was comparable to that in wt controls ( figure 2e ) .
however , since the total bm cell mass was reduced in pim tko mice , the absolute number of lsk cells was significantly lower in pim tko mice than in wt mice ( figure 2f ) .
to further characterize hspc population in pim tko mice , we measured long - term ( lt ) - hscs ( cd34 - cd135 - lsk cells ) , short - term ( st ) - hscs ( cd34 - cd135 + lsk cells ) , and multi - potential progenitor cells ( mpps ; cd34 + cd135 + lsk cells ) [ 15 ] .
we found that the percentages of lt - hscs , st - hscs and mpps were quite similar between pim tko mice and wt controls ( figure 2g ) , although one would expect that their absolute numbers would be decreased in pim tko mice .
reduced self - renewal and long - term repopulating capacity of hscs in pim tko mice hscs have the ability to self - renew and differentiate into all lineages of hematopoietic cells .
these functions are best demonstrated using transplantation models in which the transplanted hscs rescue lethally irradiated recipients and reconstitute the whole hematological system .
we transplanted lethally irradiated ( 11 gy ) fvb / j mice with bm cells harvested from pim tko mice or sex - and age - matched wt controls ( 5x105 cells / recipient mouse ) .
as showed in figure 3a , the mice transplanted with wt bm cells all survived after transplantation .
in contrast , 75 % of the mice transplanted with bm cells from pim tko mice died after transplantation .
additionally , those pim tko bm transplant recipient mice that survived showed significantly lower peripheral white blood cell counts at various time - points post transplantation ( figure 3b ) .
the platelet count at 3 months post transplantation was also significantly lower in pim tko bm transplant recipient mice than that in the mice transplanted with wt bm cells ( figure 3c ) .
the impaired hematological reconstitution seen in pim tko primary transplant recipient mice was not due to fewer number of lsk cells transplanted .
all mice received equal number of bm cells and the percentages of lsk cells were similar between pim tko bm grafts and wt bm grafts ( figure 2e ) .
figure 3 reduced animal survival and delayed hematological recovery in primary transplant mice receiving bm cells from pim tko mice .
lethally irradiated female fvb / j mice were injected via tail vein with bm cells obtained from male pim tko mice or male wt controls ( 5 x 105 cells / recipient mouse ( n = 7 / group )) .
animal survival ( a ) was monitored daily .
peripheral blood white blood cell count ( b ) was measured at 1 , 2 , and 3 months post transplantation (* p < 0.05 ) .
peripheral platelet count ( c ) was measured at 3 months post transplant (* p < 0.05 ) .
to further define the role of pim kinases on hsc self - renewal and long - term repopulation , we performed secondary bm transplantation ( figure 4a - 4b ) .
bm cells were harvested from primary bm transplanted recipient mice at 4 months post transplantation and injected into lethally irradiated female fvb / j mice ( 1x107 cells / mouse ) .
at 3 months post transplantation , the secondary transplant mice receiving pim tko cells had significantly reduced peripheral white blood cell counts ( figure 4a ) .
donor cell engraftment in bm was quantified at 4 months post transplantation using a quantitative pcr - based method measuring the sex - determining region y ( zfy1 ) [ 13,16 ] .
we found that the male donor cells engraftment in secondary pim tko transplant recipients was significantly lower than that in controls ( figure 4b ) .
our data demonstrated that the self - renewal potential and the long - term repopulating capacity of hscs were impaired in pim tko mice .
figure 4 delayed hematological recovery and reduced donor cell contribution in secondary transplant mice receiving bm cells from pim tko primary transplant recipients .
bm cells were harvested from primary transplant recipients at 4 months post transplantation and injected into lethally irradiated female fvb recipients ( 1 x 107 / mouse ) .
( a ) lower peripheral white blood cell counts in pim tko secondary transplant recipient mice .
peripheral white blood cell count in the secondary transplant recipient mice was measured at 3 months post transplant ( n = 6 for wt ; n = 3 for pim tko mice , * p < 0.05 ) .
( b ) reduced donor cell engraftment in the bm of pim tko secondary transplant recipient mice .
the secondary transplant recipient mice were sacrificed at 4 months post transplant and bm cells were harvested and analyzed for male donor cell engraftment (* p < 0.05 ) .
competitive repopulating capacity of pim tko bm cells was also examined .
in this series of experiments , 5x105 bm cells from male pim tko mice or male wt controls were mixed with 2x105 of competitive wt female fvb / j bm cells and transplanted into lethally irradiated female fvb / j recipients .
male donor cell engraftment in peripheral blood at 3 months post transplantation was estimated by quantitative pcr .
as shown in figure 5a , mice transplanted with pim tko bm cells had a lower percentage of donor - derived male cells compared to control mice ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results indicated that pim tko bm cells were less efficient and less competent in reconstituting the hematopoietic system than wt bm cells .
we also determined donor cell engraftment in three main peripheral blood cell subsets ( i.e. , gr - 1 + granulocytes , t cells and b cells ) in the competitive transplant recipient mice .
as shown in figure 5b , the donor cell engraftment was reduced in all these three cell subsets in competitive transplant recipient mice receiving pim tko bm cells , suggesting impairment in multi - potential hscs in pim tko mice .
figure 5 reduced repopulating capacity of pim tko bm cells in competitive transplants .
5x105 total bm cells from male pim tko mice or wt controls , along with 2x105 female competitor bm cells , were transplanted into irradiated female recipients .
( a ) reduced engraftment capacity of pim tko bm cells .
male donor engraftment in peripheral blood at 12 weeks post transplant was estimated (** p < 0.01 ) .
( b ) reduced engraftment in all three main cell subsets with pim tko bm cells .
gr - 1 + granulocytes , cd3e + t cells and b220 + b cells were sorted from pooled peripheral blood samples .
genomic dnas from each population were isolated and the male donor cell contribution in these cell subsets was determined .
reduced hsc proliferation and increased apoptosis in pim tko mice to understand the mechanisms underlying the reduced capacity of pim tko hscs in reconstituting hematopoiesis , we investigated the proliferation status of hscs in pim tko mice .
we first measured in vivo brdu incorporation in lt - hscs , st - hscs and mpps of the mice .
we observed significantly lower number of brdu positive cells in the pim tko lt - hsc population ( figure 6a ) .
the brdu incorporation in st - hsc and mpp compartments was not affected in pim tko mice ( figure 6a ) .
we next measured ki67 labeling in cultured lsk cells in vitro .
we sorted bm lsk cells from pim tko mice or wt mice and cultured the cells in stemspan medium supplemented with growth factors for 48 hours .
consistent with our in vivo brdu results , we found that the mean fluorescent intensity ( mfi ) of ki - 67 expression in pim tko lsk cells was reduced by 20 % compared to that in wt lsk cells ( figure 6b ) .
these data suggested that pim tko hscs were less proliferative .
figure 6 decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of pim tko hscs .
( a ) decreased in vivo brdu incorporation in lt - hscs of pim tko mice .
pim tko mice or wt mice were injected with 2 doses of brdu , and bm cells were harvested and labeled with antibodies .
brdu - positive cells in lt - hscs , st - hscs , and mpps were analyzed ( n = 6 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
( b ) decreased in vitro ki67 labeling in pim tko lsk cells .
lsk cells were sorted from pim tko mice or wt mice and cultured in stemspan medium supplemented with tpo , scf and flt3 for 2 days .
the cells were then stained with ki67 antibody .
representative histogram of three independent experiments was shown ( mfi : mean florescent intensity ) .
( c ) increased cell death in pim tko lsk cells .
the cultured lsk cells were stained with live / dead dye and representative histogram of three independent experiments was shown .
( d ) increased caspase 3 - activation in pim tko lsk cells .
cultured lsk cells were fixed and stained with caspase 3 antibody .
representative histogram of three independent experiments was shown .
to determine the role of pim kinases in regulating hsc cell survival , we measured cell death and caspase 3 - activation in lsk cells ex vivo .
pim tko lsk cells and wt lsk cells were cultured in vitro with growth factors for 48 hours .
cell death was measured by live / dead fixable dye and caspase 3 - activation was determined by intracellular caspase 3 antibody staining .
compared to wt lsk cells , pim tko lsk cells showed increased rates of cell death ( figure 6c ) and caspase 3 - activation ( figure 6d ) .
discussion hematopoiesis is regulated by many different molecular pathways [ 17 ] .
in the current study , we examined the role of pim kinases in regulating the primitive hscs in mice .
we used serial transplant experiments , competitive transplant assay , and in vivo and in vitro proliferation assays to investigate the long - term repopulating hscs in pim tko mice .
our study provides direct evidence for an important role of pim kinases in hematopoiesis .
our findings are consistent with and support previous observations reported by others [ 4,10 - 12 ] .
for instance , we found that pim tko mice had reduced body size , displayed erythrocyte microcytosis , and had reduced t cell numbers .
we did not observe significant changes in the peripheral b - cell number .
this is also consistent with previous observation by mikkers , et al. , who found that in young pim tko mice , peripheral b - cell numbers were reduced whereas in older animals , the b - cell number was unaltered [ 4 ] .
importantly , our current study extended our observations beyond previous results .
we demonstrated that : 1 ) .
deletion of pim kinases affects multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells including platelet counts ( figures 1 ) .
2 ) .
deletion of pim kinases affects the self - renewal and long - term repopulating capacity of hscs ( figures 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
3 ) .
deletion of pim kinases affects the proliferation of the most primitive hscs in vivo and in vitro ( figure 6 ). and 4 ) .
deletion of pim kinases increases apoptotic cell death of hscs ( figure 6 ) .
our study provides new insights into the roles of pim kinases in the regulation of hscs .
the reasons the effects of pim kinases in hscs were not previously reported are : 1 ) previous studies had been focused on the effects of pim kinases on t - and b - cells .
this seemed logical because overexpression of pim1 kinase induced clonal t cell lymphoma / leukemia [ 8 ] .
2 ) pim - deficient mice were generated on fvb / j background [ 4,10,11 ] .
fvb / j mice lack readily available surface markers to separate donor - derived cells from congenic recipient - origin cells .
this presents a technical challenge in determining the long - term repopulating capacity and self - renewal of hscs in transplantation models .
3 ) the percentage of lsk cells in the bm of pim tko mice was comparable to that in wt controls , as we showed in figure 2e .
in the absence of serial transplant experiments , this finding may lead investigators to assume that hsc population is unaltered in pim - deficient mice .
the pcr - based method that we reported recently [ 13 ] allows us to reliably determine donor cell engraftment in our transplant experiments .
several published studies suggested a potentially important role of pim kinases in hematopoiesis and in hscs .
for example , pim1 is highly expressed in human fetal hematopoietic tissues [ 18 ] .
additionally , pim1 kinase is a key target for hoxa9 , a homeoprotein important in hematopoiesis [ 19 ] .
pim1 and pim3 were found to be important in maintaining the self - renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells , and loss of pim1 and pim3 led to cell differentiation [ 20 ] .
furthermore , overexpression of pim kinase protected hematopoietic cells from apoptosis [ 21 ] , and enhanced growth factor - independent survival in myeloid cells [ 22,23 ] .
recent study by grundler , et al .
[ 12 ] suggested that pim1 kinase was critical in cxcr4 expression and hsc homing .
using transplant models , our study provides direct evidence for an important role of pim kinases in hematopoiesis .
pim kinases regulate diverse signal pathways in both hematological and non - hematological malignant cells .
pim kinases promote cell proliferation by regulating enzymes that are important in cell cycle progression , including cdc25a [ 24,25 ] and p27kip1 [ 26 ] .
pim kinases regulate cell survival by phosphorylating the apoptotic protein bad [ 27 ] and ask1 [ 27 ] .
furthermore , pim1 kinase regulates pras40 phosphorylation and increases the activities of mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase [ 29 ] .
pim kinase was found to be important in controlling energy metabolism and cell growth [ 30 ] .
consistent with these observations in cancer cells , our studies suggest that pim kinases are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival in hscs .
our study has important implications .
pim kinases are being investigated as a potential target in the drug development for the treatment of cancer [ 31 ] .
several compounds including pan - pim inhibitors are currently under development and have shown interesting preclinical activities in multiple cancer histologies .
clinical data and safety profiles of these inhibitors in human are very limited .
our current studies suggest that it would be important to understand and monitor the potential hematological side effects when using pim kinase inhibitors .
conclusions we demonstrated that pim kinases play a fundamental role in hsc regulation .
our findings support the notion that oncogenes are not only important in tumorigenesis , but also involved in normal cell development .
identifying these roles is an important step in developing safe and effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers .

cell sorting for cd3e + t cells , gr - 1 + granulocytes , and b220 + b cells peripheral blood samples ( 150 mul / mouse ) were collected from each group ( 5 mice / group ) at 4 months post competitive bm transplant and pooled .
after rbc depletion , the leukocytes were stained with apc - conjugated anti mouse cd3e , pe - conjugated anti mouse gr - 1 and fitc - conjugated anti mouse b220 antibodies and subjected to cell sorting on mo - flo sorter ( dakocytomation ) .
sorted cd3e + t cells , gr - 1 + granulocytes and b220 + b cells were processed for genomic dna isolation .
male donor cell engraftment in each cell subset was determined by real time pcr analysis as described above .
in vitro culture of lsk cells and cell proliferation and apoptosis assay rbc - depleted total bm cells obtained from pim tko mice or wt control mice were first enriched for lin - cells by lineage selection kit .
lin - cells were then stained with scal - 1 and c - kit antibodies and sorted on flow cytometry for lsk cells .
lsk cells ( 6,000 / well ) were cultured in stemspan sfem medium ( stemcell technologies ) supplemented with 100 ng / ml of murine stem cell factor ( scf ) , murine thrombopoietin ( tpo ) , and murine flt3 ( all from invitrogen ) for 2 days .
cells were then stained with aqua live / dead fixable dye ( invitrogen ) followed by fixation and permeabilization ( bd cytofix / cytoperm kit ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the fixed cells were then stained with pe - cy7 - conjugated ki - 67 antibody and fitc - labeled caspase 3 antibody .
statistical analysis the values were reported as mean +/ - sem of multiple experiments or mean +/ - sd from a representative experiment .
differences were analyzed by student 's t test .
p < 0.05 was regarded as significant .

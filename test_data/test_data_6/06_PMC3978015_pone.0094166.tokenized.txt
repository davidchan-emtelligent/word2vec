beta - mannanase sacte _ 2347 from cellulolytic streptomyces sp. sirexaa - e is abundantly secreted into the culture medium during growth on cellulosic materials .
the enzyme is composed of domains from the glycoside hydrolase family 5 ( gh5 ) , fibronectin type - iii ( fn3 ) , and carbohydrate binding module family 2 ( cbm2 ) .
after secretion , the enzyme is proteolyzed into three different , catalytically active variants with masses of 53 , 42 and 34 kda corresponding to the intact protein , loss of the cbm2 domain , or loss of both the fn3 and cbm2 domains .
the three variants had identical n - termini starting with ala51 , and the positions of specific proteolytic reactions in the linker sequences separating the three domains were identified .
to conduct biochemical and structural characterizations , the natural proteolytic variants were reproduced by cloning and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli .
each sacte _ 2347 variant hydrolyzed only beta - 1,4 mannosidic linkages , and also reacted with pure mannans containing partial galactosyl - and / or glucosyl substitutions .
examination of the x - ray crystal structure of the gh5 domain of sacte _ 2347 suggests that two loops adjacent to the active site channel , which have differences in position and length relative to other closely related mannanases , play a role in producing the observed substrate selectivity .

introduction mannan , one of the major hemicelluloses in higher plants , is primarily composed of beta - 1,4 linked d - mannose units .
structural variations of mannan are classified according to the types of sugars that are incorporated into the mannan chain .
for example , galactomannan contains d - galactose attached to the mannan chain via alpha - 1 , 6 linkages [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , while glucomannan has the chain substituted with d - glucose .
furthermore , galactoglucomannan , which is prevalent in pine wood , has glucose incorporated into the mannan chain and galactosyl branching .
in addition to the incorporation of sugar , the c2 and c3 hydroxyl groups of both mannosyl and glucosyl unit of mannan are frequently acetylated [ 2 ] .
hydrogen bonding interactions between the galactosyl branches and the mannan chain along with the physical association of hemicellulose with cellulose makes deconstruction of hemicellulose and other plant cell wall polysaccharides a formidable task [ 3 ] .
thus , enzymatic hydrolysis of mannan - containing polymers is essential for deconstruction of plant cell wall , particularly softwoods such as pine .
mannan hydrolysis is carried out by free - living soil microorganisms [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] , including numerous species in the streptomyces genus .
in order to utilize mannan - containing polysaccharides , these organisms secrete beta - mannanases , beta - mannosidases , alpha - 1,6 galactosidases , and acetylmannan esterases in addition to other polysaccharide - degrading enzymes [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
synergy between enzymes of different functions enables efficient deconstruction of biomass .
recently , we described the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic capability of streptomyces sp. sirexaa - e , an aerobic microbe that is a prominent member of a bacterial / fungal symbiotic community associated with the invasive pinewood - boring wasp sirex noctilio [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
proteomic analysis showed that when sirexaa - e is grown on biomass substrates , it secretes numerous endo - and exocellulases , xylanases , polysaccharide monooxygenases , a caffeoyl - coa dioxygenase [ 12 ] , and a single beta - mannanase , sacte _ 2347 [ 11 ] .
the specific activity of the sirexaa - e secretome was comparable to that of spezyme cp ( genencor , international inc , ny , usa ) , an early generation commercial cellulase cocktail prepared from trichoderma reesei rut - c30 .
moreover , the xylan - and mannan - hydrolytic activities of the sirexaa - e secretome were higher than those detected in spezyme cp .
sacte _ 2347 was identified in secretomes produced when sirexaa - e was grown on cellobiose , cellulose , or various pretreated biomass samples .
interestingly , polypeptides with masses of 53 , 42 and 34 kda were identified by mass spectrometry fractions of the sirexaa - e secretome containing the highest mannanase activity , presumably generated by extracellular proteolytic processing .
since the hemicellulosic fraction of pine wood is greatly enriched in mannan - containing polysaccharides , the properties of enzymes participating in hemicellulosic deconstruction was of interest .
here we report that the three different variants of beta - mannanase from sirexaa - e are derived from sacte _ 2347 .
as all three are abundant in the secreted proteome , we determined the catalytic properties of each .
all three variants were capable of hydrolyzing mannan , glucomannan , and galactomannan , which are the three different forms of mannan predominant in pine wood .
the full - length enzyme , which contains the cbm2 domain , has modestly improved catalytic efficiency for reaction with pure beta - d - mannan and ionic liquid - pretreated pine wood .
additionally , we report the atomic resolution ( 1.06 a ) crystal structure of the gh5 domain of sacte _ 2347 , which revealed a unique arrangement of two loops adjacent to the active site channel .
the product distributions obtained from exhaustive hydrolysis of galactomannan are interpreted in light of the structural constraints presented by this newly observed arrangement of loops .
a potential role of this enzyme in the sirex - microbe symbiotic community during the invasive attack on pine wood is also considered .
results bioinformatics the sirexaa - e genome encodes three gh5 family enzymes : sacte _ 0482 ( subfamily 2 , with cellulase activity detected ) ; sacte _ 5461 ( subfamily 19 , no functional assignment ) ; and sacte _ 2347 , which is a member of subfamily 8. of the 101 genes currently assigned to gh5 subfamily 8 , only 18 have been experimentally shown to possess beta - 1,4 - mannanase activity ( black dots in figure 1 ) .
sacte _ 2347 is a three - domain protein ( figure 2 ) that consists of a gh5 catalytic domain ( residues 63 - 308 ) , a fibronectin type - iii domain ( fn3 , residues 362 - 437 ) , and a cbm2 ( residues 459 - 559 ) that are connected by two short linkers ( residues 309 - 361 and residues 438 - 458 ) .
the gene also encodes a twin - arginine translocation signal peptide ( residues 1 - 41 ) , which targets fully folded proteins for secretion [ 13 ] , and is frequently associated with cellulolytic proteins secreted by sirexaa - e [ 11 ] .

the location of c - terminal tryptic - digest polypeptides for each variant is shown ( gh5 , 34kda - c , fn3 , 42kda - c , cbm2 ; also shown in table 2 and figure s1 ) .
forms of sacte _ 2347 in cellulolytic secretomes the preparation of cellulolytic secretomes from sirexaa - e , ion exchange separation , and preliminary determination of various enzymatic activities has been reported [ 11 ] .
here we provide an in - depth biochemical and structural characterization of sacte _ 2347 , the only secreted mannanase from this highly cellulolytic organism .
all fractions from ion exchange that exhibited mannanase activity contained three dominant polypeptides with masses of ~ 34 kda , ~ 42 kda and ~ 52 kda ( figure 3a ) .
to qualitatively screen the mannan - degrading activities of these polypeptides , an in - gel assay was carried out with beta - 1,4 d - mannan .
after electrophoretic separation and time for the enzymatic reaction to proceed , congo red staining showed that all three polypeptides had beta - mannanase activity ( figure 3b ) .
this suggested that the three polypeptides were derived from full - length sacte _ 2347 .
since prolonged incubation of the secretome increased the proportion of the two smaller polypeptides at the expense of the larger , this proteolysis was a property of the secretome , which is known to contain several proteases [ 11 ] .

regions of the gel that contain polysaccharide bind the dye and appear orange ; regions of the gel containing enzyme activity no longer contain polysaccharide and so have a grey - colored appearance .
in order to identify the n - and c - terminal amino acid sequences of the three sacte _ 2347 polypeptides , amino terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry were performed ( figure 2 , table 1 and figure s1 ) .
all three sacte _ 2347 variants had the same n - terminal sequence of ala51 - ala52 - gly53 - leu54 .
interestingly , this sequence does not correspond to that immediately following the predicted twin arginine translocation signal in sacte _ 2347 , which is asp42 - leu43 - pro44 - gln45. whether this difference is due to reaction of the transport peptidase at a position different than that predicted by bioinformatics or is due to the presence of another protease in the secretome cannot be determined at this time .

the names of peptides are also used in figure 2 .
b observed m / z. analysis of the mass data revealed that the largest protein corresponded to the sequence from ala51 to ala562 , where the intact m / z = 52581 da [ m + h ]+ is in agreement with the theoretical molecular weight of 52564 da. this protein also yielded diagnostic tryptic peptides from the gh5 , fn3 and cbm2 domains ( m / z = 1330.12 , 1305.2 and 879.96 , respectively ) .
the intermediate sized protein ( intact m / z = 42373 da [ m + h ]+ and theoretical molecular weight of 42355 da ) yielded diagnostic tryptic peptides from both gh5 and fn3 domains ( m / z = 1330.12 and 1305.2 , respectively ) , while the smallest protein ( intact m / z = 33,875 da [ m + h ]+ , and theoretical molecular weight of 33822 da ) yielded a diagnostic tryptic peptide from only the gh5 domain ( m / z = 1330.12 ) .
furthermore , c - terminal peptides for the intermediate and smallest sized protein were also detected ( table 1 and figure s1 ) .
a peptide with m / z = 725.34 [ m + h ] 2 + was identified corresponding to the sequence from ser441 to gly456 at the c - terminus of the intermediate - sized protein .
this peptide lies in the linker region between the fn3 and cbm2 domains .
furthermore , a peptide with m / z = 1088 [ m + h ] 2 + was identified from the c - terminus of the smallest protein , corresponding to the sequence from glu344 to thr367 .
this peptide includes the linker region between the gh5 and fn3 domains , and also the first six residues from the fn3 domain .
no other peptides with masses consistent with assignment to the c - terminus were detected .
the combination of masses of the different polypeptides and sequence assignments for the c - terminal peptides confirm that the proteolytic processing of sacte _ 2347 occurs at specific positions in the linker regions between the domains .
in order to better understand the function of sacte _ 2347 and its proteolytically processed forms , plasmids encoding the protein sequences identified by n - terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry were produced , and the corresponding proteins were expressed in escherichia coli , purified , and assayed with a panel of different substrates .
these three recombinant proteins are designated sacte _ 2347 _ fl ( residues 51 - 562 ) , sacte _ 2347 _ 42kda ( residues 51 - 456 ) , and sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda ( residues 51 - 367 ) .

active site channel despite the high degree of amino acid sequence diversity , the gh5 family is defined by eight strictly conserved residues [ 14 ] .
in sacte _ 2347 , these eight residues correspond to arg100 , his136 , asn177 , glu178 , his244 , tyr246 , glu273 , and trp303 ( figure 4 ) , with glu178 and glu273 serving as the catalytic acid / base and nucleophile , respectively .
the conservation of active site residues and the distances between the catalytic acid and base suggests that sacte _ 2347 hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds with retention of the anomeric configuration through a double displacement mechanism [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .

b , comparison of the active site channels of sacte _ 2347 ( green ) and tfmana ( blue ) .
residues that form the surface of the channel are highlighted in gray , and the positions of loops l1 and l2 are indicated .
positions of the catalytic residues ( glu178 and glu273 in sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda ) are shown in red .
mannobiose observed in the - 3 and - 2 subsites of the tfmana structure is shown as ball and sticks .
an extended solvent - exposed oligosaccharide binding channel that spans the face of the ( beta / alpha ) 8 - barrel is a prominent features of gh5 enzyme architecture ( figure 4b ) .
structural differences along this channel provide the molecular basis for the remarkable diversity of activities that are observed among gh5 members .
while six subsites ( - 4 , - 3 , - 2 , - 1 , + 1 , and + 2 ) were identified in the mannotriose - bound tfmana structure ( pdb id 3man , 0.35 a rmsd [ 17 ]) , conserved structural features between the two enzymes and the shorter length of the sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda oligosaccharide binding channel ( figure 4b ) allowed us to positively identify five potential mannose - binding subsites ( - 3 , - 2 , - 1 , + 1 and + 2 ) [ 18 ] .
the glycosidic bond placed between the - 1 and + 1 sites is at the position of hydrolysis .
several aromatic and polar residues positioned along this channel provide a platform for sugar binding .
for example , trp30 of tfmana forms a stacking interaction with a mannose at the - 3 subsite , and trp80 from sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda aligns with this residue .
residues that form the - 3 and - 2 subsites in the tfmana mannotriose - bound structure ( e.g. , tyr81 , trp109 , his136 , trp303 , and asn308 ) are also identical or highly conserved in sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda and all other gh5 subclade 8 enzymes , suggesting that binding at the - 3 and - 2 subsites is conserved within this family .
the sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda and tfmana structures differ substantially in lengths and positions of two loops , l1 and l2 , that form part of the active site channel ( figure 4b ) .
additional analysis on the positioning of comparable loops in other gh5 enzymes is provided in table s1 .
in summary , among the 19 structures of gh5 enzymes that were solved with and without bound ligands including his tags , the position of the loops that compose the substrate bind channel do not change regardless of whether oligosaccharides or his tags are present or not .
thus , the presence of the bound his tag is not likely to have a significant impact on the position of l1 and l2 in the sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda structure .
in the following , we present an analysis of the positioning of loops l1 and l2 in sacte _ 2347 relative to the catalytic residues ( glu178 and glu273 , red surface in figure 4b ) , and then consider how this arrangement permits reaction with galactomannan typically found in pine wood .
figure 4b shows that l1 loop residues ( 275 - 284 ) in the sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda adopts an extended conformation that might alter substrate accessibility at the + 1 and + 2 subsites relative to tfmana , which lacks a comparable loop ( figure s2 ) .
interestingly , tyr281 from sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda is positioned at the tip of l1 , where it could interact with a bound mannan chain sugar , but also provide steric exclusion to the placement of an alpha - 1 , 6 linkaged glucomannan unit into the + 1 and perhaps the + 2 subsites .
furthermore , l2 loop ( residues 302 - 315 ) in the sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda is two residues shorter and shifted toward the - 3 site as compared to l2 loop of tfmana ( figure s2 ) .
in the structures of tfmana and other mannanases , the additional two residues in the l2 loop are part of a two - turn helix that protrudes into the active site channel .
this feature might provide closer steric interaction at the - 2 and - 1 subsites , than those possible in sacte _ 2347 , which lacks this loop .
furthermore , l1 and l2 do not make contacts with each other in sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda , but instead provide an opening between the two loops that is perpendicular to the main path of the channel ( figure 4b ) and above the catalytic residues .
the space between l1 and l2 is large enough to allow a branching sugar to bind in the - 1 position .
moreover , the shorter and displaced position of l2 offers the possibility to accommodate a branching sugar at the - 2 position of sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda .
function of sacte _ 2347 to test our hypothesis for substrate selectivity arising from the unique features in the sacte _ 2347 structure , sacte _ 2347 and its proteolytically processed forms were tested using a panel of different substrates .
the sacte _ 2347 variants did not react with any of seven fluorescent substrates tested , including mum , a diagnostic analog for mannobiosidase activity .
this result indicates that mannosyl groups must occupy at least three sugar binding subsites along the active site channel in order to achieve catalysis .
reactions with insoluble polysaccharides were tested using the dns assay to detect release of reducing sugars .
the sacte _ 2347 variants were able to hydrolyze beta - 1,4 d - mannan , acetylated glucomannan and locust bean gum , the latter of which contains on average one galactose branching unit for every 3 - 4 mannose units .
no variant was active on cellulose , galactan or xylan .
table 3 lists the steady - state kinetic parameters for hydrolysis obtained with the different sacte _ 2347 variants .
these studies were conducted at ph 6.0 and 40degreesc , which was an optimum condition for the sacte _ 2347 ( figure 3s ) , and the kinetic parameters were from short time assays ( 15 min ) where only ~ 1 - 2 % of the total substrate present was hydrolyzed .
among the three variants , sacte _ 2347 _ fl containing the cbm2 domain showed a modest increase in apparent k cat / k m for mannan , acetylated glucomannan , and il - pine relative to sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda lacking the cbm2 domain .
this relationship did not hold with locus bean gum , a structurally more complex substrate , where equivalent k cat / k m values were observed with all three variants .

d il - pine has the following composition : 34 % glucose ; 9 % xylose ; 8 % mannose ; 4 % arabinose , and 8 % galactose .
sacte _ 2347 did not hydrolyze cellulose , xylan and other polysaccharides described in the materials and methods , and likewise did not react with fluorogenic small molecule analogs .
in the following , the bold numbers shown below the structures of the substrates and products shown in figure 5 will be used as identifiers .
an hplc analysis was performed to determine the end products from sacte _ 2347 - catalyzed reactions .
sacte _ 2347 did not hydrolyze mannobiose ( 2 ) , but produced mannose ( 1 ) and 2 from mannotriose ( 3 ) .
these products may arise from binding of 3 across either the - 2 to + 1 or the - 1 to + 2 subsites .
to better understand the binding mode of 3 , we performed reactions in buffer enriched with 18oh2 to trace the positioning of the substrate in the sugar binding subsites at the time of hydrolysis [ 19 ] .
the relative 18o incorporation in 1 versus 2 was determined by esi - tof mass spectrometry , and ~ 7.5 - fold excess of 18o - mannobiose over 18o - mannose was observed , indicating a preference for occupation of the - 1 to + 2 subsites during catalysis ( figure 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0094166.g005 figure 5 schematic diagram of the binding subsites of sacte _ 2347 correlated with reaction of purified oligomannosides and galactosyl - substituted oligomannosides .
the active site schematic shows the positions of sugar binding subsites , the catalytic residues glu178 and glu272 , and the position of loops l1 and l2 .
mannosyl groups ( grey circles ) and galactosyl groups ( black circles ) of purified substrates studies are aligned in the - 3 to + 2 subsites under the schematic of the active site channel .
loop l1 blocks binding of a substituted mannosyl group in either the + 1 of + 2 subsites .
the space between l1 and l2 allows placement of a substituted mannosyl group in the - 1 subsite , while shortened l2 allows placement of a substituted mannosyl group into the - 2 subsite .
all reaction products can be rationalized to arise from hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond between the - 1 and + 1 subsites after accounting for steric interactions with l1 and l2 .
in other reactions , 2 was the only product observed from mannotetraose ( 4 ) .
thus , sacte _ 2347 lacks beta - 1,4 mannosidase activity .
this catalytic selectivity is also consistent with the lack of activity with the diagnostic fluorescent substrate mum .
several purified alpha1,6 - linked galactosyl mannooligosaccharides were used to further correlate the reactivity with the positions of the l1 and l2 selectivity loops relative to the assigned sugar binding subsites ( figure 5 ) .
sacte _ 2347 hydrolyzed 62 - alpha - d - galactosyl - mannotriose ( 6 ) into 61 - alpha - d - galactosyl - mannobiose ( 5 ) and 1 , and 63,64 - alpha - d - galactosyl - mannopentaose ( 7 ) into 61,62 - alpha - d - galactosyl - mannotriose ( 8 ) and 2 .
sacte _ 2347 did not further react with products 5 or 8 .
in summary , sacte _ 2347 reacted with purified mannan and galactosyl branched mannans to give 2 , and two branched oligosaccharides , 5 and 8 .
locust bean gum is a natural product mannan containing alpha - 1,6 - linked galactosyl groups .
according to the manufacturer , this material contains , on average , 1 galactosyl modification per 3.5 mannose units .
figure 6 show that the products obtained from exhaustive hydrolysis of locust bean gum by sacte _ 2347 were 2 , 5 , and 8 .
among these three compounds , there are a total of 7 mannose units and 3 galactosyl units .
after normalization using the integrated areas of the chromatograph peaks , the calculated relative proportion of mannose to galactose in the total final products was 3.7 , which matches the value obtained by chemical hydrolysis reported by the manufacturer .
according to the structural constraints established by l1 and l2 , 8 accumulates as a non - reactive product , while 2 and 5 are too short to be further hydrolyzed .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0094166.g006 figure 6 end products from exhaustive hydrolysis of locust bean gum by sacte _ 2347 determined by hplc .
the three major products identified by comparison of elution times with purified commercial standards were 1g,2g - m3 ( 8 ) , 1g - m2 ( 5 ) , and m2 ( 2 ) .
since pine wood is the preferred natural substrate for the sirex symbiotic community , il - pine and other biomass substrates were tested for reaction .
the monocot substrates ( corn stover and switchgrass ) contain only a minor fraction of mannan , and so no significant reactivity was observed .
all sacte _ 2347 variants reacted with il - pine , which contains ~ 8 % ( w / w ) of mannan polysaccharides , although the k cat and k cat / k m values were lower than for the purified polysaccharides .
given this result , it was of interest to determine the binding selectivity of the cbm2 domain in sacte _ 2347 .
cbm2 domains have been experimentally demonstrated to bind to cellulose , xylan and chitin [ 20 ] - [ 22 ] .
the equilibrium binding of each isoform was tested by using insoluble polysaccharide pull - down assays ( figure 7 ) .
the presence of the cbm2 domain in sacte _ 2347 _ fl promoted binding to pure cellulose and galactomannan , whereas the two smaller isoforms lacking the cbm2 domain did not bind .
interestingly , none of the sacte _ 2347 isoforms bound tightly enough to insoluble mannan to be detected by the pull - down assay .
binding was observed with afex - treated corn stover and switchgrass , which is consistent with the exposure to cellulose provided by this pretreatment [ 23 ] .
the binding capacity with the il - treated biomass and il - pinewood increased as the biomass was changed from a grass to mixed biomass and then pine , possibly corresponding to a progressive increase in the galactomannan content .
furthermore , sacte _ 2347 _ fl bound to the lignin from the pine and synthetic g - dhp lignin [ 24 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0094166.g007 figure 7 insoluble substrate binding assays .
sacte _ 2347 variants were tested for binding to the insoluble substrates indicated using a pull - down format .
a , sacte _ 2347 _ fl .
b , sacte _ 2347 _ 42kda .
c , sacte _ 2347 _ 34kda .
the presence of protein in the pellet fraction ( p ) indicates binding , as the control lane showed each variant was fully soluble in the conditions tested in the absence of an insoluble substrate .
black stars indicate the substrates for which binding was observed .
discussion gh5 subfamily 8 the gh5 family is separated into 53 subfamilies , with each subfamily defined by sequence similarity , amino acid conservation , and experimentally determined biochemical properties [ 25 ] .
in this study , we report biochemical and structural properties of sacte _ 2347 , a gh5 mannanase from the cellulolytic sirexaa - e .
sacte _ 2347 is a member of the gh5 subfamily 8 ( figure 1 ) .
the majority of enzymes with beta - 1,4 mannanase activity have been assigned to either the gh5 or gh26 [ 17 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 29 ] , with one example from gh113 reported [ 30 ] .
although enzymes from these families hydrolyze mannan with retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon , the families differ in their domain structures .
whereas gh5 mannanases are most often a combination of catalytic domains with a cbm and / or additional gh domains , gh26 mannanases are primarily single domain enzymes .
the sirexaa - e genome does not encode a member of the gh26 or gh113 family .
consequently , the sacte _ 2347 gene is the only annotated mannanase present in the sirexaa - e genome .
this gene encodes a polypeptide consisting of gh5 , fn3 , and cbm2 domains .
differences in domain structures of cellulolytic enzymes provide the variation needed to deconstruct the diversity of polysaccharide structures present in plant cell walls [ 31 ] .
for example , single domain mannanases have been proposed to more readily hydrolyze soluble , easily accessible to oligomannosaccharides without the potential complication of being adsorbed to insoluble polysaccharides ( or other biomass constituents ) through the presence of a cbm domain [ 27 ] .
in contrast , multi - domain enzymes that contain a cbm might have increased activity on insoluble mannan by virtue of the ability of the cbm to more efficiently associate the catalytic domain to the substrate surface .
our results indicate that sacte _ 2347 is proteolytically processed to yield three well - defined variants in the sirexaa - e secretome obtained from growth on biomass .
all variants of sacte _ 2347 retained the ability to hydrolyze insoluble mannan substrates , but did not react with galactan , xylan , or cellulose .
overall , there was little difference in the k cat / k m observed for the three variants with the purified mannans , but sacte _ 2347 _ fl , containing the cbm2 domain , had a 40 - 60 % improvement in k cat / k m for reaction with pure mannan and il - pine , a galactomannan - enriched substrate ( table 3 ) .
the sacte _ 2347 cbm2 domain was bound to cellulose , galactomannan and various lignins analogs in pull - down assays .
thus , tight - binding interaction of sacte _ 2347 _ fl with biomass likely occur via exposed regions of any of these polymers .
it is also interesting that sacte _ 2347 _ fl was bound to galactomannan , but not to pure d - mannan ( composition of 97 % mannose and 3 % galactose ) .
this result implies that galactosyl - branches on the mannan chain may have an important contribution to binding interactions with this cbm2 .
structural basis for subsite selectivity the sacte _ 2347 _ 32kda structure has a his tag from a symmetry related monomer bound in the active site channel .
comparison with other structures of gh5 enzymes surprisingly revealed no significant differences in the positions of active site residues and adjacent loops regardless of whether ligands or his tags were bound in the active site ( table s1 and associated analysis ) .
although attempts to obtain structures from sacte _ 2347 lacking the his tag or by soaking the tagged protein with various substrates and products were not successful , we used catalytic studies with purified of beta - 1,4 d - mannan , alpha - 1,6 substituted mannans , and locust bean gum to provide further insight into the structural basis for selectivity of sacte _ 2347 hydrolysis .
for the catalytic studies , the his tag was removed .
figure 5 provides a schematic of the sacte _ 2347 active site channel showing the positions of the catalytic residues ( glu178 and glu272 ) , and correlates the proposed subsites used for substrate binding with the positions of selectivity - controlling loops l1 ( including y281 ) and l2 , and the observed products .
all sacte _ 2347 variants were unable to hydrolyze 2 but did hydrolyze 3 and 4 .
the preferential formation of 18o - mannobiose suggests that 3 must bind across the - 2 to + 1 subsites .
this result is also consistent with the end product formation pattern determined in 61 - alpha - d - galactosyl - mannotriose .
the exclusive hydrolysis of 4 to 2 indicates that 4 must bind across the - 2 to + 2 subsites , and again emphasizes the importance of occupying the - 2 to + 1 subsites .
the extended configuration of l1 , which includes tyr281 at the tip of the loop , provides a potential steric mechanism for refining interactions with substrates .
for example , a favorable interaction of tyr281 with a mannosyl group bound in the active site channel would also disfavor placement of mannosyl groups with a branching sugar substitution into the + 1 and + 2 subsites .
galactosyl mannooligosaccharides were used to further clarify the ability of sacte _ 2347 to hydrolyze branched mannans ( figure 5 ) .
the hydrolysis of 6 resulted in the formation of 5 and 1 .
thus 6 must bind across the - 2 to + 1 subsites to react to give the observed products but also to satisfy the steric constraints imparted by l1 .
reactions that contained 7 yielded 8 and 2 .
there was no further breakdown of 8 , an oligomannoside with adjacent branches .
this can be attributed to unfavorable steric interactions of the 61 - galactosyl branch with l1 , which interferes with productive binding leading to catalysis .
relative activities of the sacte _ 2347 variants it has been suggested that gh26 enzymes , which lack cbm domains , can preferentially hydrolyze soluble substrates , whereas gh5 enzymes , which possess cbm domains , have preferential utility in hydrolysis of insoluble substrates [ 27 ] .
the different variants of sacte _ 2347 had similar k cat / k m values ( table 3 ) , although sacte _ 2347 _ fl , which uniquely contains the cbm2 domain , had a modestly improved k cat / k m when reacted with pure mannan .
the observed kinetic parameters for sacte _ 2347 were comparable to that of tfmana , the closest structural homolog [ 32 ] .
furthermore , although sacte _ 2347 _ fl was the largest protein studied , it also showed the best specific activity with il - pine , demonstrating the utility of the attached cbm2 domain .
mannanase in symbiotic communities sirexaa - e was isolated from the evolutionarily specialized sirex / fungus / bacteria community [ 11 ] .
the fungal and bacterial members of this community make important contributions to the invasive nature of the insect infestation through the deconstructive activities of their secreted enzymes .
since pinewood has a large fraction of mannan , it is perhaps not surprising that sacte _ 2347 is the fourth most abundant protein secreted by sirexaa - e. it is somewhat surprising , however , that sirexaa - e does not use mannan as a growth substrate , suggesting other members of the community that use these compounds may be cross - fed by the action of this enzyme .
similar considerations apply to the non - reactive branched galactomannans 5 and 8 , which are likely further processed by other enzymes from the microbial community .
proteolytic processing of cellulases and xylanases has been studied [ 21 ] , [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] .
for example , xylanase from streptomyces halstedii jm8 was proteolytically cleaved into two different forms , xys1l ( 45 kda ) and xys1s ( 35 kda ) [ 21 ] , [ 36 ] .
both forms were reported to be similarly active on soluble and insoluble oat spelt xylan and birchwood xylan .
similarly , cellulase ( avicellase ) from streptomyces reticuli was proteolytically processed , and the full - length enzyme was shown to be more active than processed enzyme with cellulose polymers ( avicel , carboxymethylcellulose , and hydroxyethylcellulose ) , whereas the 42 - kda variant had higher activity than the full - length enzyme with para - nitrophenylcellobioside [ 35 ] .
proteolytically processing of a mannosidase in the lilly flower plant has been reported [ 37 ] , but no other studies on the consequences of proteolysis of mannanases have been reported .
the external environment of the larval feeding tunnel , where sirexaa - e lives , is a harsh environment where h2o2 , metal - containing oxidative enzymes , and numerous proteases are present .
moreover , exposed lignin provides a surface where enzymes might be non - specifically adsorbed and inactivated .
our mass spectral results indicate that proteolysis of sacte _ 2347 occurs at specific inter - domain positions .
once formed , the proteolyzed variants are relatively stable .
proteolytic processing of sacte _ 2347 in the larval tunnel may overcome non - specific adsorption , particularly if the attachment occurs through the cbm domain .
interestingly , all three forms of sacte _ 2347 had equivalent k cat / k m and specific activity for reaction with locust bean gum , a galactomannan representative of the mannan fraction present in pine .
these results suggest each of the naturally proteolyzed forms of sacte _ 2347 present in the sirexaa - e secretome play a role in biomass processing in the larval feeding tunnel .

afterwards , the gel was stained in 0.1 % congo red for 10 min and washed in 1 m nacl , at room temperature .
to identify the location of protein , a comparable 12 % page gel lacking mannan was prepared using the same voltage and time and stained with coomassie blue .
both gel images were captured using the gel doc ez imager ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca ) enzyme assays for assays using the fluorogenic substrates , 0.2 mm samples of the substrate were prepared immediately before use in 0.1 m sodium phosphate , ph 8.0 .

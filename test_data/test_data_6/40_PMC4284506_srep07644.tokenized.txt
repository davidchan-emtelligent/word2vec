among the key applications are ultrafast time - resolved studies of dynamics of matter by observing responses to fast excitation pulses in a pump - probe manner .
detectors with sufficient time resolution for observing these processes are not available .
therefore , such experiments typically measure a sample 's full dynamics by repeating multiple pump - probe cycles at different delay times .
this conventional method assumes that the sample returns to an identical or very similar state after each cycle .
here we describe a novel approach that can provide a time trace of responses following a single excitation pulse , jitter - free , with fs timing precision .
we demonstrate , in an x - ray diffraction experiment , how it can be applied to the investigation of ultrafast irreversible processes .
the understanding of phenomena in matter often relies on the investigation of its structure , meaning its atomic composition , and its dynamics describing how the structure undergoes changes .
many fundamental dynamic processes , such as the formation or breaking of chemical bonds , are related to the motion of atoms .
the time scales of the vibrational movement of atoms typically lie in the sub - picosecond range .
the advent of femtosecond lasers has provided a powerful tool for the study of transient matter .
in pump - probe experiments they are used to push a system out of equilibrium using a pulsed excitation ( pump ) and the subsequent relaxation dynamics are measured by applying a second pulse to determine the status of a particular property of the sample after a given delay ( probe ). with the advent of suitable sources such as laser plasmas12 , high - harmonic generation3 , femto - slicing4 , and x - ray free - electron lasers567 , x - ray probe pulses are receiving increasing attention , as x - rays offer a rich variety of resonantly enhanced contrast mechanisms to reveal element - specific and even chemical information .
x - ray based spectroscopic methods applied on a femtosecond time scale8 can also directly interrogate local changes of electronic states .
when using multi - kev or hard x - rays , the structural dynamics of matter can be probed by diffraction experiments12910 .
all these experiments measure one particular delay after the arrival of the pump pulse at a time .
thus , these techniques are essentially limited to the study of reversible processes that reproducibly return to their ground state after each pump - probe cycle , or they require an identical , fresh sample for each shot , with identical orientation in the case of diffraction experiments .
this has hindered pump - probe studies of highly excited materials at near - solid densities as they reach local thermal equilibrium : the so - called " warm dense matter " regime11 .
since these very high - energy density experiments permanently damage the samples with each shot , and constant supply of fresh identical samples is only possible in some experiments , it is most useful to find a way to get complete time traces of the response from a single x - ray pump pulse .
another important limitation for ultrafast time - resolved experiments at x - ray fel sources has been the loss in time resolution due to the timing jitter between the pump and probe pulses .
typically , the external pump lasers are synchronized to the x - ray fel via radiofrequency phase - locking , resulting in short term jitter of more than 100 fs12 , and long term drifts in the ps range .
the development of more advanced techniques , e.g. exploiting the terahertz emission from the fel undulator13 or the signal from electron bunch monitors14 for the stabilization of the x - ray and optical pulses , is a topic of intense research .
a pragmatic and robust method involves monitoring the relative time delay on a per - shot basis and re - sorting the data accordingly .
this approach can reduce timing errors to below 10 fs15 , but it obviously requires data sets collected using many pump pulses and is therefore of limited use for single - shot experiments .
a fundamental way to avoid timing jitter between pulses is to split them from the same parent pulse and to control their temporal separation by a delay line .
several such instruments based on mirrors1617 and bragg crystals1819 have been developed for soft and hard x - ray fel radiation , respectively .
however , both approaches only provide one delay time per x - ray pulse .
we pursue a split - and - delay approach based on diffraction gratings as shown in figure 1 .
a set of beam splitter gratings sn with different periods pn diffracts a small fraction of the incoming radiation into a fan of beams .
a second set of gratings rn is positioned half way between sn and the sample to recombine the diffracted beams with the direct , undiffracted beam at the sample position .
for this purpose , the recombiner periods qn must be half the period pn of the corresponding sn grating .
the deflection deltaxn = alambda / 2pn in the recombiner plane with respect to the undiffracted beam results in a delay deltatn of where a denotes the distance between sn and the sample , c the speed of light , and lambda the x - ray wavelength .
for weak sn gratings - meaning gratings of low diffraction efficiency - most of the intensity remains in the undiffracted beam , which can be used as a pump pulse to excite the sample .
this pulse is followed by a series of probe pulses , each a diffracted beam , with delays that are precisely defined by the geometrical parameters and not subject to any pump - probe jitter .
the probe beams diverge again downstream of the sample , and a streak of delayed probe pulses can be recorded on a detector array , analogously to commonly used electron streak cameras .
no time resolving detector is required .
the positive and negative diffraction orders of each splitter grating sn create a symmetric pair of beams propagating towards the recombiner gratings rn. in our set - up depicted in figure 1 , the beams diffracted in the upward direction are deflected by the corresponding rn gratings to probe the pumped region of the sample .
however , the beams diffracted downwards are deflected by rn gratings having a slightly larger period , in order to hit the sample at a slightly different position than the pump beam and the probe beams ( see inset of figure 1 ) .
the bragg reflection of these beams can be used to provide the unpumped response for the very same shot as a reference .
in addition to the above - mentioned intrinsic absence of jitter , the availability of several probe beams , and the possibility to record the unpumped response , the experimental setup described here has several particular properties , that make it robust and easy to use at x - ray fel sources : as the rn gratings are placed half - way between the sn gratings and the sample , the set - up is achromatic in the sense that it can accept the full range of photon energies of the self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) without losing the intersection point of the pump and probe beams .
contrary to set - ups based on reflective optics , the use of transmission gratings makes the set - up insensitive to mechanical drift and vibrations .
the deflection angles of the beams are determined by the grating periods , they are not affected by lateral displacements of the gratings , and are very tolerant with respect to changes of the incidence angle onto the gratings .
due to the use of two gratings in each delayed beam , the pulse fronts remain parallel to that of the pump beam .
this avoids the pulse stretching effect often encountered when using diffractive optics20 .
we implemented such an experiment at the xcs instrument of the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) 21 , operated at 4.5 kev photon energy and 40 fs pulse length .
the essential design parameters are listed in table 1 .
the set - up comprises each 15 delayed probe and reference channels with delays spanning over more than a picosecond .
as can be seen from eq .
1 , the time delays scale linearly with the length of the setup a , and inverse to the square of the grating periods .
in order to achieve delays of up to 1.277 ps at 4.5 kev photon energy , we chose a to be 12.2 m , limited by the dimensions of the experimental hutch .
in spite of this large distance , the required periods qn need to be as small as 17.4 nm , which is close to the fabrication limits of nanolithographic techniques .
moreover , the grating periods need to be exact within extremely narrow tolerances .
furthermore , due to their nanoscale dimensions , the gratings for long delays could only be made with shallow line profiles , making the gratings and thus the corresponding channels very inefficient , see table 1 .
more information on the grating fabrication tolerances and a possible route to improve the channel efficiency is given in the methods section .
it should be noted at this point that the maximum delay demonstrated in the described experiment does not represent a fundamental limit .
as the delay scales proportionally with the sqaure of the x - ray wavelength ( see eq .
1 ) , a delay range of more than 11 ps could be covered at 1.5 kev photon energy using the same grating periods pn and qn and the same sn - to - sample length a. the multiple split - and - delay line was used in the scattering geometry shown in figure 1 to record the bragg reflection from a bismuth < 111 > crystal .
we chose a scattering geometry in the horizontal plane in order to ensure that the delayed beams , which are incident at varying vertical angles , all fulfilled the bragg condition .
figure 2 displays averaged and single shot data of the bragg - reflected intensities in the case where the direct pump beam was blocked using the attenuator near the rn plane .
although the signal level drops rapidly with increasing delay , even resulting in several " dead " channels , we can clearly observe the delayed streaks of probe and reference pulses .
in particular , it should be noted that the 15th channel can still be disinguished from the detector noise level even for the single shot recordings .
the time delays depend on the grating periods and grating distances , both of which can be determined with a relative accuracy of better than 10 - 3 .
the dominating uncertainty of the delays is given by the fact that , according to eq .
1 , the path length and therefore the delay is wavelength dependent .
at lcls the beam is subject to a 0.5 % shot - to - shot wavelength jitter related to fluctuations of the accelerator energy4 .
as the latter is monitored for each shot , its effect on the delay is known .
the relative spectral width of the individual pulses is limited by the sase process to deltalambda / lambda =~ 0.2 % 6 , resulting in deltat / deltat = 2deltalambda / lambda = 0.4 % .
the timing uncertainty deltatn is only a few fs even for the longest delays ( see table 1 ) , which is well below the x - ray fel pulse length itself .
the motivation for using bi < 111 > as the sample in these diffraction experiments was to investigate whether phonon oscillations could be observed .
their effect on the bragg reflectivity of bismuth has been studied in a number of experiments using infra - red pump lasers for excitation189 .
we collected the x - ray streaking signal for several thousand pump events at various pump levels between 1 x 109 w / cm2 and just below the damage threshold which was found to be at 2 x 1012 w / cm2 .
we tried a variety of experimental settings regarding the pump and probe spot sizes and found no evidence of any oscillatory behaviour in the probe streak .
it is unclear whether the contrast of the phonon oscillation signal was too low to be distinguished from shot - to - shot fluctuations of the measured signals or whether no phonon oscillations can be excited with multi - kev x - rays at pump fluences below the damage threshold .
the latter explanation is plausible in view of the fact that ir - pumped measurements on phonon oscillations in bi typically require pump intensities within a factor of two from the stability limit19 .
it is expected that the bragg reflectivity decreases rapidly once the crystal lattice of the sample disorders for pump levels above the damage threshold .
we can follow the dynamics of this effect as displayed in figure 3 .
in the unpumped case one can observe the same probe and reference streak as in figure 2 , though recorded using a 2 - dimensional pixel detector .
the three single - shot measurements were performed at a pump fluence far beyond the damage threshold .
the probe streak measurement dies out with a decay time of about 50 - 70 fs , which is somewhat longer than the nominal pump pulse length of 40 fs. the order of the atomic lattice obviously vanishes within a few tens of fs , which is consistent with observations by ultra - fast electron diffraction22 .
the fact that the reference streak signal remains constant proves that the change in bragg reflectivity is limited to the pumped region .
a more precise observation of the lattice dynamics would require a systematic variation of the pump fluence , which was not possible during the available beam time .
these very first x - ray streaking measurements are unique , as they directly show the evolution of the femtosecond response of a sample following a single , destructive pump pulse , free of timing jitter .
the presented experimental set - up can be further improved in particular with respect to the channel efficiency and shot - to - shot fluctuations , as described in the methods section .
a variety of novel experiments could be performed by x - ray streaking .
one could , for example , use protein crystals as a sample to directly determine the required pulse length in serial nano - crystallography at x - ray fels23 .
the damage mechanisms and time scales are of high relevance in structural biology and have so far only been investigated by calculations and indirect measurements24 .
changes in the x - ray absorption on the femtosecond scale could be observed using the multiple split - and - delay line by placing sample and detector in a transmission geometry .
such measurements could reveal the dynamics of processes following multiple core - shell ionization processes or the formation and dissociation of chemical bonds .
in this context , the method could also be used with an external pump laser or other excitation mechanisms .
this addition would greatly increase the variety of accessible phenomena , and even though it means losing intrinsic timing with respect to the excitation event , the relative timing of the response would still be accurate .
in summary , we have developed a novel technique for x - ray pump - probe measurements that can provide a series of probe pulses for each pump event .
the probe beams have different delays with respect of the excitation pulse , which are intrinsically free of timing jitter , and accurate to the femtosecond level .
the technique also provides reference pulses with the same delays that provide information of the unpumped sample for normalization purposes .
in a demonstrator experiment at 4.5 kev photon energy , we have presented single - shot measurements of the bragg reflectivity of a bismuth crystal pumped with a fluence level far beyond the damage threshold .
we found that the reflectivity decays within a few tens of femtoseconds , indicating a fast loss of order in the crystal structure .
this unique type of ultra - fast measurements opens up a new path towards the investigation of matter subject to extreme excitation levels that cannot easily be investigated by conventional pump - probe techniques requiring many repetitions of pump - probe cycles at different delay values .
methods grating fabrication all gratings were generated using a 100 kev electron - beam writer ( vistec ebpg5000plus ) .
as the sn gratings were subject to the full lcls beam , they were made from polished 10 mum thick diamond membranes ( diamond materials gmbh ) to avoid beam damage .
details on the fabrication of diamond diffractive x - ray optics and the radiation hardness in x - ray fel beams can be found elsewhere25 .
each diamond grating had an area of 1 mm x 1 mm to accept the full lcls beam .
as the rn gratings only received much lower fluence they could be made on silicon nitride membranes .
in analogy to a process for the fabrication of diffractive lenses26 , we used a line doubling procedure based on the coating with iridium using an atomic layer deposition ( ald ) process27 .
the rn gratings were 500 mum x 500 mum in size .
the diffraction efficiency of all gratings was measured with synchrotron radiation at the csaxs station of the swiss light source .
the channel efficiencies listed in table 1 are the efficiency products of both gratings in each channel .
experimental setup the experiments were performed at the xcs instrument of lcls .
to reduce absorption losses all components except for the sample and the detectors were placed inside helium - filled enclosures , separated from the beam line vacuum by a 100 mum thick diamond window .
the attenuation of the setup was 88 % up to the sample and another 40 % between the sample and the detectors placed 1.6 m further downstream .
we used the full sase emission from lcls at 4.5 kev photon energy , 2 mj pulse energy and 40 fs pulse length throughout the experiments .
the delayed beams were focused onto the sample by a beryllium refractive lens ( see fig. 1 , x - ray lens 1 ) giving a spot size close to the diffraction limit of =~ 1 mum .
the size of the direct beam was increased to =~ 30 mum by an additional refractive lens ( see fig. 1 , x - ray lens 2 ) to facilitate overlap of the pump and the probe beams .
in order to achieve a positioning accuracy of the probe beams with respect to the pump beam of 10 mum or better , the grating diffraction angles need to be precise to better than =~ 1 murad , requiring the grating periods to have a relative accuracy of better than =~ 10 - 4 .
for the finest rn grating this means that its pitch of qn = 17.391 nm needs to be accurate within =~ 0.002 nm. the alignment of the probe beams and the reference beams with respect to the pump beam was performed by placing a high resolution (~ 2 mum ) x - ray camera in the sample position , and tuning the rotation angles of the sn gratings around the optical axis as well as the distances between the gratings and the sample .
a spatial overlap of clearly better than 10 mum could be obtained .
the bismuth < 111 > crystal consisted of a cleaved bulk sample ( by mateck gmbh ) providing single crystal domains of several mm in size .
the bragg angle was 20.15degrees , the mosaic spread of the reflections was typically 0.1 mrad , resulting in an accepted bandwidth of about 10 ev , which matches the bandwidth of a single sase pulse ( deltae / e =~ 0.2 % , deltae =~ 9 ev ) .
the damage threshold of bi was found to be at =~ 2 x 1012 w / cm2 .
data acquisition and data treatment for the data shown in fig. 2 , we used a gotthard strip detector28 with 50 mum pitch .
a series of 10.000 shots was acquired at 120 hz repetition rate , while monitoring the accelerator energy and the photon pulse intensity for each shot .
we found that the relative peak heights varied substantially from shot to shot , and that this variation is clearly correlated with the accelerator energy and pulse intensity .
the data displayed in fig. 2 were selected to have similar accelerator energies and pulse energies close to the mean values of the series , and therefore exhibit very similar peak heights .
the data shown in fig. 3 were collected with a cs - pad 140 k detector module29 with 110 mum x 110 mum pixel size .
the data were taken in single shot mode in order to choose a fresh sample region after every shot .
the background caused by the flare of the pump beam was subtracted from the delayed probe and reference peaks .
the remaining intensity was integrated over the delayed spots and normalized with the integral over the corresponding spots of the unpumped shot .
no data binning according to accelerator energy and pulse intensity was applied due to the small number of single - shot experiments .
this is the main cause for the fairly large scatter of the data points .
a route for improvement two main limitations of the described set - up are due to the grating performance : ( i ) the low efficiencies at high channel numbers needs to be enhanced by improving the grating efficiencies .
for such weak gratings the efficiency scales with the square of the height of the grating lines .
as the channel efficiency is determined by the efficiency product of both corresponding gratings , already a doubling of the structure height in each grating would lead to a channel efficiency increase by a factor of 16 .
such an increase in structure height could for example be achieved by using the gratings in a tilted geometry30 .
( ii ) the strong shot - to - shot fluctuation of the relative peak heights can be explained by a fluctuating illumination of the gratings .
as these devices have inhomogeneous efficiency distributions across their area , this will translate into fluctuations of the channel efficiencies .
the correlation with the accelerator energy and thus with the photon energy is due to the corresponding changes in sn diffraction angle , causing the beam to illuminate a different part of - or even partly miss - the rn gratings .
this problem must be addressed by fabricating larger and more homogeneous gratings .

figure 1 x - ray streaking principle .
diffraction gratings are used to create a multiple split - and - delay line .
the upstream x - ray lens 1 focuses the xfel beam onto the sample .
the undiffracted ( direct ) beam serves as a pump , and can be attenuated and focused independently by x - ray lens 2 .
the beams diffracted upwards by the splitter gratings sn are redirected towards the sample by the recombiner gratings rn , and probe the pumped sample region with defined delays .
the beams diffracted downwards by sn are steered to a region of the sample that is 100 mum below the pump beam ( see inset ) to provide reference signals of the unpumped response on the very same shot .
all beams are recorded separately on a detector array .
only three delayed beam pairs are shown for simplicity .
the sample 's scattering plane is chosen perpendicular to that of the gratings , in order to minimize coupling of the scattering angles .
figure 2 x - ray diffraction data of 15 pairs of delayed probe and reference pulses .
the data were taken with the set - up sketched in fig. 1 using a bi < 111 > crystal as sample .
the black curve shows the average over twelve xfel shots , while the coloured curves are single shot data .
the curves are shown on a linear scale and are offset in the vertical direction for clarity .
the grey regions mark the channels that were reduced in transmission by additional attenuators ( not shown in fig. 1 ) on the rn gratings in order to make better use of the dynamic range of the strip detector .
the direct pump beam was completely blocked .
the insets show probe and reference signals for long delays ( n >= 6 , deltat >= 243 fs ) .

the experimental geometry is the one depicted in fig. 1 , however using a 2 - dimensional pixel detector .
the centre of the detector is protected by a beam stop .
panels ( a ) - ( d ) show the signal of the probe and reference beams on a logarithmic scale ( log10 ) .
panel ( a ) was recorded with the pump beam blocked upstream of the sample , panels ( b ) - ( d ) display three single shot measurements at the full pump power density of =~ 3 x 1014 w / cm2 , meaning that no attenuators were used in the pump beam .
panel ( e ) shows the intensities integrated over the spots of ( b ) - ( d ) , normalized with the corresponding intensities of ( a ) , versus delay time .
the probe pulses decay due to the destruction of the bi crystal lattice , whereas the reference signals remain constant .
the dashed lines merely serve to guide the eye and do not represent experimental data .
table 1 parameters and properties of the multiple split - and - delay line .
15 probe and reference channel pairs were realized in the geometry shown in figure 1 for 4.5 kev photon energy and a sn - to - sample distance of a = 12.2 m. the recombiner grating pitches qn and q'n refer to the probe and reference channels , respectively .
the channel efficiencies etan and eta'n of the probe and reference channels are the products of the diffraction efficiencies of the two gratings in each channel .
they represent the relative channel intensities compared to the direct pump beam intensity when no attenuators are used .
deltatn denotes the resulting delay with respect to the direct pump beam , deltatn is the chromatic delay uncertainty calculated for a 0.2 % relative energy bandwidth .

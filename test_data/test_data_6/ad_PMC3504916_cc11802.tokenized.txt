sirs is considered to be present when patients have more than one of the following clinical findings : body temperature > 38degreesc or < 36degreesc ; heart rate > 90 / minute ; hyperventilation evidenced by a respiratory rate > 20 / minute or paco2 < 32 mmhg ; and white blood cell count > 12,000 cells / mul or < 4,000 / mul [ 1 ] .
on the other hand visceral leishmaniasis ( vl ) , or kala - azar , is a parasitic disease that consists of a protracted course of fever , pallor , wasting , hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia [ 2,3 ] .
the aim of our study is to start a discussion about vl and sepsis .
methods from 45 adults patients diagnosed with vl between january 2005 and december 2009 in the service of infectious diseases , university hospital centre of tirana , albania , we have selected 36 patients who presented with fever > 38degreesc and leucopenia < 4,000 / mul .
the diagnosis of vl was based on demonstration of leishmania parasites in bone marrow smears .
results from 36 patients 58.3 % were males and 41.6 were females .
age ranged from 17 to 69 years , the average age was 43.2 years .
main clinical and laboratory findings were : fever in 100 % , malaise in 100 % , hepatosplenomegaly in 100 % , anemia in 82 % , leucopenia in 100 % , thrombocytopenia in 50 % , and increased liver enzymes in 52.7 % of cases .
bone marrow aspirate was performed in all cases with amastigotes identified in 100 % of the cases .
meglumine antimoniate was used in all cases as an initial treatment .
treatment failure occurred in two cases ( 5.5 %) that were treated subsequently with liposomal amphotericin b. the case fatality was 5.5 % .
the main causes of death were liver and cardiac failure .
conclusion based on the clinical and laboratory findings vl could be considered a systemic inflammatory response .
maybe in this disease we have not evaluated an inflammatory test like c - reactive protein or procalcitonin to be convicted if higher than the normal value , but we think we need to start a study about markers of sepsis in this systemic parasitic disease , because our opinion is that vl is a sirs plus parasitic systemic infection - which does mean sepsis .
in malaria , pct levels are elevated in both severe and uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria , but how useful is this inflammatory test in vl [ 4 ] ?

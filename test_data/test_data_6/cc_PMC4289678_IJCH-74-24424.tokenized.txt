objective measure the prevalence of self - reported myocardial infarction ( smi ) in sami and non - sami populations in rural areas of norway , and explore whether possible ethnic differences could be explained by established cardiovascular risk factors .
design cross - sectional population - based study .
methods a health survey was conducted in 2003 - 2004 in areas with sami and non - sami populations ( saminor ) .
the response rate was 60.9 % .
information concerning lifestyle was collected by 2 self - administrated questionnaires , and clinical examinations provided anthropometric measurements , and data on blood pressure and lipid levels .
results the total number for the subsequent analysis was 15,206 men and women aged 36 - 79 years ( born 1925 - 1968 ) .
sex - specific analyses revealed no ethnic difference in smi .
in terms of the most important risk factors such as smoking , blood pressure , and lipid levels , no or only trivial ethnic differences were found in both women and men .
conclusion in this study , we found no difference in smi between sami and non - sami in rural areas in norway .
the similar risk profile is the most plausible explanation ; similar living conditions and close interaction between the ethnic groups may explain this .
cardiovascular disease indigenous norway the sami are an indigenous people whose settlement area ( sapmi ) covers the northern parts of norway , sweden and finland , and russia 's kola peninsula .
the traditional sami settlement area in norway stretches from finnmark in the north to engerdal in hedmark county in the south .
in the latter half of the 20th century , sami and non - sami populations in norway underwent lifestyle changes resulting in more sedentary lifestyles and dietary changes ( 1,2 ) .
the knowledge concerning the burden of myocardial infarction among the sami is limited , and we do not know whether the prevalence of this disease differs between sami and non - sami populations in norway .
some studies have , however , been carried out ; for example , the first finnmark study was initiated in 1974 - 1975 , wherein sami / finnish men aged 35 - 49 years had on average a 40 % higher cardiovascular risk score compared with norwegians ( 3 ) .
the score was based on sex , serum total cholesterol , systolic blood pressure and current cigarette smoking ( ibid. ) .
despite this risk profile , the prevalence of self - reported myocardial infarction ( smi ) was considerable lower in the sami compared with the norwegian population ( ibid. ) .
since then , prevalence and follow - up data have shown no or only minor differences in risk factors and risk of ischaemic heart disease ( ihd ) ( 2,4 - 10 ) .
in terms of mortality from cardiovascular disease , conflicting results have been presented ( 11,12 ) .
various definitions of sami ethnicity have been used in these studies .
the primary objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of smi in sami and non - sami populations , and to explore whether possible differences could be explained by established cardiovascular risk factors .
methods as part of the norwegian institute of public health 's ( niph ) health survey in finnmark , the centre for sami health research conducted in 2003 - 2004 a population - based survey in areas with sami and non - sami populations ( saminor ) ( 13 ) , also including areas outside finnmark .
the age cohorts included in saminor were 30 and 36 - 79 year - olds .
all eligible residents in the selected municipalities registered in the national population register were invited regardless of ethnic background ( n = 27,987 ). of these , 16,865 ( 60.3 %) participated and gave consent to medical research .
the response rate in the age group 36 - 79 ( n = 16,538 ) was 60.9 % .
the population was almost exclusively rural .
the regional committee for medical research ethics approved the study and the participants gave written informed consent .
questionnaires information on ethnicity and lifestyle was collected by using 2 questionnaires , that is , the initial and main questionnaires ( 13 ) .
ethnicity was measured by the following : what language ( s ) do / did you , your parents and your grandparents use at home ?
the response categories were " norwegian ," " sami ," " kven " or " other. " kvens are descendants of finnish settlers who immigrated to northern norway in the 1700s and 1800s ( 14 ) .
providing the same response options , we also asked : what is your , your father 's and your mother 's ethnic background ?
the respondents also reported whether they considered themselves to be norwegian , sami , kven or other ( self - perceived ethnicity ) .
on all these questions multiple answers were allowed .
these variables are described in detail by lund et al .
( 13 ) .
based on these variables we generated 2 ethnic categories : sami and non - sami .
the sami category included respondents reporting at least one sami identity mark ( sami language spoken by the respondent or at least one parent or grandparent , or sami ethnic background or self - perceived sami ethnicity ) .
those not reporting a sami identity mark were included in the non - sami group .
myocardial infarction was measured by the following question : do you have , or have you ever had : a heart attack ?
( yes / no ) .
missing values ( n = 640 ) were considered negative responses ; for such variables , this is a conventional ad - hoc imputation method ( 15 ) .
the following question measured family history of myocardial infarction : tick off relatives who have , or have ever had , any of the following conditions , and report the age of when they got the illness : " heart attack before the age of 60 years " and " heart attack after the age of 60 years. " the possible response categories were " mother ," " father ," " sister ," " brother ," " children " and " no one. " the variables were combined to create a variable of total family history of myocardial infarction .
observations providing a negative response but reporting the age for when their relative ( s ) got the illness were given a positive response ( n = 9 ) .
data on smoking were collected by asking : are you currently , or were you previously , a daily smoker ?
" yes , currently ," " yes , previously ," " never. " never smokers ( n = 37 ) , current smokers ( n = 86 ) and observations with missing data on smoking status ( n = 14 ) reporting the number of years since they stopped smoking were coded as previous smokers .
education was measured by asking : how many years of schooling / education have you completed ( including all the years you attended school or have been studying ) ?
use of cholesterol - lowering drugs during the last 4 weeks was registered by the following item : state the name of the medicine and your reason for taking / having taken them ( disease , symptoms ) : tick one box for each line .
relevant atc reference codes were used .
medical examination a trained group of experienced fieldworkers from the niph performed the medical examinations , which took place in 2 buses traveling between the municipalities .
invitations with the time and date for the medical examination were sent in the mail together with the questionnaires .
waist circumference was measured at the umbilicus to the nearest centimetre at the end of exhalation with the individual standing and breathing normally .
the methods used and procedures followed for the measurement of blood pressure , total cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol and glucose are described in detail elsewhere ( 9 ) .
all blood samples in the saminor study were non - fasting .
we used self - reported diabetes and information about anti - diabetic medication to define diabetes .
additionally , a non - fasting blood glucose level >= 11.1 was defined as having diabetes ( 16 ) .
statistical analysis means in tables i and ii were tested by 2 - sample t - tests ; rates were tested by pearson 's chi - square tests or 2 - sample wilcoxon rank - sum ( mann - whitney ) tests .
the distributions of hdl cholesterol and glucose were skewed and thus log - transformed ; the displayed means are geometric .
the direct method was used to age - standardize the prevalence of total smi ( table iii ) to the european standard population of 1976 ( 17 ) .
logistic regression was then used to evaluate the effects of the explanatory variables on the relationship between ethnicity and smi ( table iv ) .
systolic blood pressure , hdl cholesterol and total cholesterol were included in the regression models as categorical variables , as displayed in tables i and ii. appropriate goodness - of - fit tests were performed to optimize the regression models .
alcohol consumption , leisure - time physical activity , and intensity and duration of smoking ( pack - years in current smokers and time since smoking cessation in previous smokers ( 18 ) were also included in the regression models to assess any additional confounding effects .
we also performed the regression analysis with and without the ad - hoc imputation to assess if the imputations of negative smi cases influenced estimates and results in table iv. table i characteristics of the female study group by ethnicity .

an alternative categorization of sami ethnicity was assessed by dichotomizing sami ethnicity into sami i ( sami language is used as the home language by all grandparents and parents and by the participant ) and sami ii ( at least one sami identity mark , i.e. sami language spoken by the respondent or at least one parent or grandparent , or sami ethnic background or self - perceived sami ethnicity ) .
all statistical analyses were performed using stata version 13.0 ( statacorp , college station , tx ) .
results the total number for the subsequent analysis was 15,206 men and women aged 36 - 79 years ( born 1925 - 1968 ) ; those aged 30 years ( n = 327 ) ( low response rate and few disease events ) and those who did not respond to the initial ( n = 207 ) and main ( n = 785 ) questionnaires were excluded from the analysis .
also excluded were recent immigrants ( n = 257 ) , those with missing information on ethnicity ( n = 52 ) and participants who did not turn up for the medical examination ( n = 31 ) .
recent immigrants were responders who were born abroad and answered " other " to the first 2 questions on ethnicity ( see questionnaires ) .
tables i and ii display the levels of selected risk factors by ethnicity in women and men , respectively .
in women , statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) but small differences between non - sami and sami were found for hdl cholesterol , glucose and family history of myocardial infarction .
in men , statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) differences were found for total cholesterol , family history of myocardial infarction , years of education and smoking .
these differences were also small .
in both sexes , the sami had higher levels of hereditary myocardial infarction .
nonetheless , in terms of the most important risk factors such as smoking , blood pressure and lipid levels , no or only trivial ethnic differences were found in both women and men .
table iii displays age - specific , and total crude and age - standardized , prevalence rates of smi by sex and ethnic groups .
similar rates and overlapping confidence intervals were seen when comparing sami and non - sami women and men .
in women , the total age - standardized rates for non - sami and sami were 1.5 % ( 95 % ci : 1.2 - 1.9 ) and 2.0 % ( 95 % ci : 1.5 - 2.5 ) , respectively .
the total age - standardized rates for non - sami and sami men were 5.8 % ( 95 % ci : 5.2 - 6.4 ) and 5.3 % ( 95 % ci : 4.5 - 6.1 ) , respectively .
odds ratios ( ors ) for smi in sami compared with non - sami are presented in table iv. in both women and men , univariable and multivariable regression analyses revealed no significant ethnic difference in odds of smi .
no confounding due to alcohol consumption , leisure - time physical activity , and intensity and duration of smoking was observed ( data not shown ) .
the ad - hoc imputation of negative cases of smi did not affect the end result ( data not shown ) .
furthermore , the alternative categorization of ethnicity ( see methods ) did not affect the results in the univariable and multivariable regression analyses ( data not shown ) .
discussion in this study , we found no difference in smi between sami and non - sami in selected rural areas in norway ; the similar risk profile is the most plausible explanation .
an alternative categorization of ethnicity ( see methods ) did not affect the end result ( data not shown ) .
the similar risk profile and burden of smi in sami and non - sami in rural areas of northern norway are in line with those found in earlier studies ( 2,4 - 10 ) .
in sweden , a few follow - up studies have shown little or no difference between sami and non - sami with regard to cardiovascular risk factors ( 19,20 ) , and a somewhat higher sami mortality rate due to ihd in women ( 21,22 ) .
a lower incidence rate of acute myocardial infarction has also been documented in sami reindeer - herding women compared with swedish women ( 22 ) .
other arctic indigenous peoples such as the greenlandic inuit present similar ihd morbidity rates compared to american and european populations ( 23 ) .
having used the same data as in this study , previous saminor publications have already presented small ethnic differences in risk factors for cvd ( 2,9,10 ) .
the similar living conditions and close interaction between the ethnic groups may explain this ; it is likely that the mentioned lifestyle changes have occurred in all parts of the rural population in northern norway independent of ethnicity ( 9 ) .
however , in a recent publication based on the same data used in this study , eliassen et al .
( 24 ) found an excess of self - reported angina pectoris in sami compared with non - sami , which was surprising given the strikingly similar risk profile .
this may suggest that our grasp of ihd aetiology in the sami population may be missing key factors ; unknown genetic or environmental factors may influence the occurrence of ihd in this population .
limitations sensitivity has been found to be quite high for smi in other populations ( 80 - 97.7 %) , whereas positive predictive values have been reported lower ( 43 - 87 %) ( 25 ) .
a recent study , using the spanish cohort of the epic study , found self - reported information on myocardial infarction to be a valid instrument when compared with medical records ( ibid. ) .
previous population studies in northern norway support agreement between smi and medical records ( 26,27 ) .
this may provide some support to the validity of the self - reported data .
however , at present we do not know the validity of smi in this population and in the 2 ethnic groups ; the fact that eliassen et al .
( 24 ) found an excess burden of angina pectoris among sami in the same sample may suggest a potential bias in this study .
body , health , and disease are cultural phenomena ; there is no universal connection between a medical condition and the way it is experienced ( 28 ) ; and standardized questions in a self - administrated questionnaire may convey different meanings to different peoples ( 29 ) .
this might thus have produced differential misclassification of disease status by ethnicity .
this study had a cross - sectional design ; we were unable to assess potential causal relationships .
we have limited information about non - responders other than that they tended to be younger , single and male ( 2 ) ; potential selection bias is thus difficult to assess .
we do not know the response rate by ethnicity ; we are therefore unable to assess whether differences in participation have influenced the observed disease burden in the ethnic groups .
an additional limitation is that the data are approximately 10 years old ; the results may therefore have reduced applicability today .
strengths a relatively high overall response rate ( 61 %) and a large population - based sample have enabled an in - depth comparative analysis of smi in sami and non - sami populations .
generalizability in saminor refers to whether the general population in the defined saminor area systematically differs from the rural population in general in northern norway , and whether those who participated in the study systematically differ from those not included ( 9 ) .
we believe that our results can be generalized to the sami and non - sami living in the rural areas of northern norway .
however , they may be less valid for the population in nordland due to the low response rate in this region ( 9,13 ) .
conclusions in this study , we found no difference in smi between sami and non - sami in rural areas in norway .
the similar risk profile is the most plausible explanation ; similar living conditions and close interaction between the ethnic groups may explain this .

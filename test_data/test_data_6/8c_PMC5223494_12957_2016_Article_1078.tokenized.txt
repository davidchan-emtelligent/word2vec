background the first - line treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer ( rpc ) is surgical resection .
however , our patients have often experienced early recurrence after curative resection for rpc , with desperately poor prognosis .
some reports indicated that minimally distant metastasis not detected at operation might cause early recurrence .
the present study aimed to identify preoperative clinicopathological features of early recurrence after curative resection of rpc .
methods ninety rpc patients who underwent curative resection between 2000 and 2014 at our institution were retrospectively analyzed .
results of the 90 patients , 32 had recurrence within 1 year .
univariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen ( ca19 - 9 ) >= 529 u / ml ( p = 0.0011 ) , preoperative serum s - pancreas - 1 antigen ( span - 1 ) >= 37 u / ml ( p = 0.0038 ) , and histological grades g2 - g4 ( p = 0.0158 ) were significantly associated with recurrence within 1 year after curative resection .
multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml ( p = 0.0477 ) and histological grade g2 - g4 ( p = 0.0129 ) were independent predictors of recurrence within 1 year .
recurrent cases within 1 year postoperatively had significantly more distant metastasis than cases with no recurrence within 1 year ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions preoperative serum ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml and histological grades g2 - g4 were independent predictive factors for recurrence within 1 year after pancreatectomy for rpc .
furthermore , recurrent cases within 1 year had more frequent distant metastasis than cases with no recurrence within 1 year .
these results suggest that rpc patients with preoperative serum ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml should receive preoperative therapy rather than surgery .
keywords resectable pancreatic cancer preoperative predictors ca19 - 9 histological grade tumor diameter issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background patients with pancreatic cancer have been reported to have a 5 - year overall survival ( os ) of approximately 5 % [ 1 ] .
only 20 % of patients with pancreatic cancer are candidates for potentially radical resection [ 2 ] .
surgical resection is associated with a median os of 11 to 23 months and with a 5 - year os of about 20 % [ 3 , 4 ] .
furthermore , 60 % of patients experience local and systemic relapse within the first 12 months after curative surgery [ 3 ] .
preoperative predictors of survival time after surgery have been reported as tumor size [ 3 ] , preoperative lymph node metastasis [ 3 ] , preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen ( ca19 - 9 ) level [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] , g3 - g4 on pathological grading [ 2 ] , duration of symptoms [ 2 ] , and preoperative modified glasgow prognostic score ( mgps ) [ 6 ] .
moreover , some studies have suggested that minimally distant metastasis undetectable even by recent advanced diagnostic imaging might have existed at the time of surgery in patients with early recurrence [ 7 , 8 ] .
in fact , occult peritoneal or liver metastatic disease has been reported to be missed by ct in 4 to 15 % of patients [ 3 ] .
the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) guidelines recommend surgical resection as the first choice for the treatment of rpc .
however , some researchers found that median os of patients with rpc was approximately 12 months after surgery alone [ 9 ] .
other researchers found that the median os of patients with rpc was < 2 years after surgery and adjuvant therapy [ 10 , 11 ] .
furthermore , at least 25 % of patients cannot receive adjuvant chemotherapy because of complications related to surgery [ 9 ] .
one group of investigators found that the median os in patients undergoing resection for rpc was 27 months using preoperative chemoradiation therapy , while the median os was 17 months in patients receiving surgery alone ( p = 0.004 ) [ 12 ] .
however , no randomized controlled trials have been reported on the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for rpc .
although randomized controlled trials will give us the answer whether preoperative therapy is needed for all rpc , we think preoperative treatment is not needed for all rpc .
if early recurrence of rpc can be predicted before performing surgery , we suppose that preoperative therapy should be selected prior to surgical resection for rpc patients .
the aim of this study was to identify preoperative predictors of early recurrence after curative resection for rpc .
the results of this study could aid oncologists and surgeons in discriminating high - risk cases of rpc in which the cancer could recur within 1 year and selecting the patients who would benefit from preoperative therapy .
methods study selection and inclusion and exclusion criteria from january 2000 to december 2014 , 183 patients underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic ductal carcinoma at our institution .
the study was approved by the ethics committee of osaka city university and was in compliance with helsinki declaration .
informed consent was obtained from all patients to use specimens for this study according to the institutional rules of our hospital .
all patients were histologically confirmed to have the common type of invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas double checked by two pathologists .
any patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma , mucinous cystic carcinoma , or intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma were excluded. of the 183 patients , 93 patients were excluded for the following reasons : cases with r2 resection margins , 19 ; borderline resectable cancer , 52 ; unresectable cancer , 18 ; and censored cases , 4 .
the data from the remaining 90 patients were retrospectively analyzed .
all of the 90 study patients were diagnosed with resectable pancreatic cancer according to the nccn guidelines , version 2.2014 .
outcome measures the demographic and clinical variables included age , sex , body mass index ( bmi ) , tumor location , tumor size , histological grade , preoperative serum s - pancreas - 1 antigen ( span - 1 ) level , preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level , preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) level , preoperative serum albumin , preoperative serum white blood count ( wbc ) , preoperative serum lymphocyte count , preoperative serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) , and preoperative mgps .
in patients with preoperative jaundice , the data after the jaundice was reduced was used for the preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level .
in patients with jaundice at our medical center , endoscopic or percutaneous bile duct drainage is usually performed .
the ca19 - 9 level in all patients was the value after total bilirubin was reduced to < 5 mg / dl. surgery and pathology surgery involved standard or subtotal stomach - preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy in 41 patients ( 45.6 %) , distal pancreatectomy in 47 ( 52.2 %) , and total pancreatectomy in two ( 2.2 %) .
regional lymph node dissection was performed in all patients .
the resected specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin at room temperature , and the size and gross appearance of the tumor were recorded .
the pathologic stage of all tumor specimens was determined using the american joint committee on cancer , 6th edition , staging system [ 13 ] .
tumor differentiation was classified according to the world health organization ( who ) classification as well differentiated ( g1 ) , moderately differentiated ( g2 ) , poorly differentiated ( g3 ) , and undifferentiated ( g4 ) [ 14 ] .
adjuvant therapy and follow - up all patients were followed for survival .
enhanced ct was performed every 4 months within 1 year after the surgery .
one year later after the surgery , we performed enhanced ct every 6 months .
if it was necessary , we added mri or pet - ct. basically before 2006 , adjuvant therapy has not been performed .
as adjuvant chemotherapy , gemcitabine was administered by reference to the results of conko - 001 since 2006 [ 11 ] .
s - 1 was administered by reference to the results of jaspac01 since 2013 [ 15 ] .
statistical analysis the clinicopathological features were compared between patients who experienced recurrence within 1 year ( rec1 ) and those who did not ( non - rec1 ) .
categorical variables were compared using the chi 2 test or fisher 's exact test .
a receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve was constructed to estimate the optimal cutoff value of preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level , preoperative serum span - 1 level , tumor diameter , preoperative serum cea level , wbc , lymphocyte count , and crp .
the cutoff value was determined as the point closest to the upper left - hand corner of the graph .
variables with a significance of p < 0.05 on univariate analysis were included in multivariate regression analysis to identify factors associated with recurrence within 1 year after surgery .
survival was calculated using the kaplan - meier method and compared between groups by the log - rank test .
p values < 0.05 were considered significant .
on multiple comparison test , bonferroni correction was used .
statistical analyses were performed using sas version 9.0 software ( sas institute , inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
results characteristics of rpc patients the characteristics of the 90 study patients who underwent curative surgery for rpc are given in table 1 .
among all the patients , 71 received adjuvant chemotherapy .
the median follow - up period was 26.8 ( 5.6 - 175.2 ) months .
the median os was 41.5 months .
the actuarial 3 - and 5 - year survival rates were 54.2 and 38.9 % , respectively .
the median preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level of the 90 patients was 92 u / ml. a roc curve demonstrated that preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level of 529 u / ml was the optimal cutoff point for recurrence within 1 year after surgery , with sensitivity of 86.2 % and specificity of 50 % .
the area under the curve ( auc ) was 0.6815 .

the median os was 37.5 months in histological grade g2 - g4 , compared to 64.6 months in g1 ( p = 0.0648 ) .
figure 2 shows the disease - free survival ( dfs ) of each independent risk factor for rec1 .
median dfs was 8.4 months in patients with ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml , compared to 27.1 months in patients with ca19 - 9 < 529 u / ml , with a significant difference between the groups ( p = 0.0008 ) .
median dfs was 16.1 months in patients with histological grade g2 - g4 , compared to 51.5 months in patients with g1 , with no significant difference ( p = 0.2197 ) .
in a further step , the 90 rpc patients were stratified into three groups : group a , ca19 - 9 < 37 u / ml ; group b , ca19 - 9 >= 37 u / ml and < 529 u / ml ; group c , ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml. we drew a survival curve for each group , as shown in fig. 3. the median os in group a did not reach the median time , the median os in group b was 40.5 months , and the median os in group c was 23.1 months .
the survival times were not statistically significantly different between the three groups , but stratified kaplan - meier curves could be drawn for these divided groups .

among the 90 study patients , 60 ( 66.7 %) experienced recurrence .
the median os of the patients with recurrence was 26.4 months , and their 5 - year survival rate was 10 % .
recurrence patterns were defined as the first recurrent locations .
distant metastasis included peritoneal dissemination , and local recurrence included regional lymph node and plexus nerve recurrence .
patterns of recurrence showed that 28 ( 46.7 %) patients initially had distant metastasis and 32 ( 53.3 %) patients initially had local recurrence .
among rec1 , 22 ( 68.8 %) patients had distant metastasis and 10 ( 31.2 %) patients had local recurrence .
on the contrary , among non - rec1 , six ( 21.4 %) patients had distant metastasis and 22 ( 78.6 %) patients had local recurrence .
rec1 experienced significantly more frequent distant metastasis than non - rec1 .

we have encountered several patients in whom the preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level was very high despite small tumor diameter without distant metastasis ; we suspect that such cases had distant metastasis undetectable by preoperative imaging modalities .
we hypothesized that patients with small tumor diameter and high preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level experienced recurrence in the form of distant metastasis more frequently than the other patients .
the study population was stratified into four groups according to tumor diameter and preoperative ca19 - 9 as follows ( table 5 ) : group 1 ( n = 5 ) , ca19 - 9 level >= 529 u / ml and tumor size < 25 mm ; group 2 ( n = 32 ) , ca19 - 9 level < 529 u / ml and tumor size < 25 mm ; group 3 ( n = 20 ) , ca19 - 9 level >= 529 u / ml and tumor size >= 25 mm ; and group 4 ( n = 33 ) , ca19 - 9 level < 529 u / ml and tumor size >= 25 mm. in group 1 , all patients had recurrence , and four of the five patients ( 80 %) experienced recurrence in the pattern of distant metastasis .
in group 2 , 16 of the 32 patients ( 50 %) had recurrence , and seven of those 32 patients ( 21.9 %) experienced recurrence in the pattern of distant metastasis .
in group 3 , 16 of the 20 patients ( 80 %) had recurrence , and 11 of the 20 ( 55 %) had distant metastasis .
in group 4 , 23 of the 33 patients ( 69.7 %) had recurrence , and 10 of the 23 ( 30.3 %) had distant metastasis .
further , regarding median os , group 1 had a median os of 12 months , group 2 did not reach the median , group 3 had a median os of 27 months , and group 4 had a median os of 45.3 months .
the survival rate of group 1 was significantly poorer than that of group 2 ( p = 0.0002 ; significant values of p < 0.01 was considered after bonferroni correction ) .

the median os of the recurrent cases among the rpc patients was 26.4 months , and the 5 - year survival rate was 10 % .
furthermore , the proportion of cases having recurrence within 1 year after curative resection for rpc was 35.6 % , and the median os was 14.2 months .
these results suggest that even if the patients with rpc could be treated by curative surgery , more than half of them would experience recurrence , and their prognosis would be poor .
furthermore , independent risk factors for rec1 were histological grades g2 - g4 and preoperative serum ca19 - 9 >= 529 u / ml .
rec1 experienced recurrence in the pattern of more frequent distant metastasis , which might suggest that occult metastasis existed at the time of surgery .
these results are crucial for the treatment strategy of rpc in the future .
the present study identified preoperative ca19 - 9 level >= 529 u / ml and histological grade g2 - g4 as preoperative factors of recurrence within 1 year after curative resection for rpc .
however , as it is usually difficult to diagnose the histological grade before surgery , the degree of differentiation is usually a post - resectional parameter .
in fact , at our institution , the histological grade is not usually able to be diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound ( eus )/ fine needle aspiration ( fna ) before surgery .
therefore , histological type cannot be considered as an appropriate preoperative factor .
this suggests that the most appropriate preoperative independent factor is preoperative ca19 - 9 level >= 529 u / ml , excluding histological grade .
the ca19 - 9 tumor antigen was initially described by koprowski et al. as a colorectal cancer marker [ 16 ] and is currently the most clinically useful marker of pancreatic cancer .
furthermore , ca19 - 9 is reliable as a possible prognostic marker for tumor resectability , recurrence , and survival [ 12 , 17 ] .
berger et al. reported a longer median survival and greater percentage of patients surviving to 5 years among patients with either normal or undetectable preoperative levels of ca19 - 9 compared with patients having elevated levels [ 18 ] .
other investigators found that a postoperative decrease in ca19 - 9 and a postoperative ca19 - 9 value < 200 u / ml were both significant predictors of survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [ 4 , 19 ] .
humphris et al. reported that normalization of ca19 - 9 within 6 months of resection was a prognostic factor [ 20 ] .
on the other hand , it has been reported that only the preoperative ca19 - 9 level was associated with the prognosis or resectability of patients .
nakao et al. reported that the only preoperative predictor of survival time after surgery is a preoperative ca19 - 9 value >= 2000 u / ml [ 5 ] .
furthermore , other investigators have found that elevated preoperative ca19 - 9 levels were significantly associated with tumor unresectability , although the reported cutoff levels ranged from 100 to 350 u / ml [ 21 - 28 ] .
in the present study , the auc of the cutoff point of the ca19 - 9 value was 0.6815 , and so it is difficult to say whether this auc is the optimal value .
henceforth , the optimal cutoff value of ca19 - 9 should be evaluated by collecting a larger number of cases .
additionally , turrini et al. suggested that the preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level by itself should not preclude surgery in patients who have undergone preoperative staging [ 29 ] .
these investigators noted that even patients with very high values of preoperative ca19 - 9 may normalize their serum ca19 - 9 levels and have an overall survival equivalent to patients with normal preoperative serum ca19 - 9 levels .
in the current study , we found that the group with higher ca 19 - 9 values tended to have poorer median os. it is possible that preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level is associated with prognosis .
but , careful evaluation is needed to determine whether the prognosis of this patient group was based on only the preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level .
we additionally examined the patterns of recurrence of rpc .
the patients who experienced recurrence within 1 year had a greater amount of distant metastasis than local recurrence .
these results might suggest that patients with early recurrence after curative surgery had minimally distant metastasis that was not detected via imaging modalities at the time of surgery , and their lesions did not visibly appear until after surgery .
furthermore , we examined the recurrence patterns of each group stratified according to the combination of preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level and tumor size .
the patients whose preoperative ca19 - 9 level was high despite smaller tumor diameter tended to have the poorest survival. from this result , it might also be speculated that patients whose preoperative ca19 - 9 level was high despite small tumor size had minimally distant metastasis before or at the time of surgery .
it should be kept in mind that rpc patients with high preoperative serum ca19 - 9 levels have potentially distant metastasis .
in particular , the possibility exists that patients whose preoperative ca19 - 9 level is high despite smaller tumor diameter have distant metastasis .
additionally , from the results of the present study , an appropriate cutoff value of preoperative serum ca19 - 9 value might be approximately 500 u / ml. chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer has recently been developed .
a previous study reported that the median os was 11.1 months after treatment with folfirinox for metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 30 ] and was 8.5 months after treatment with nab - paclitaxel plus gemcitabine [ 31 ] .
the median os of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is 24 months after first - line folfirinox with about 1 / 4 being resectable after this therapy [ 32 ] .
another study found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy contributed to high resection rates of local advanced pancreatic cancer [ 17 ] .
considering those reports , one option may be to administer preoperative chemotherapy for rpc patients who have high preoperative serum ca19 - 9 values , intending to exclude those patients who have the potential for early recurrence after surgery and to control minimally distant metastasis in those patients .
it has recently been reported that staging laparoscopy in patients with local advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is effective for selecting patients with occult distant organ metastasis [ 33 ] .
to perform staging laparoscope for rpc patients having high preoperative ca19 - 9 values may make better patient selection for preoperative therapy .
in this study , we mainly focused on preoperative therapy .
but , postoperative adjuvant therapy after curative resection has been showed to improve survival [ 34 ] .
conko - 001 showed treatment with gemcitabine for 6 months after complete resection of pancreatic cancer significant increased disease - free survival ( dfs ) and os compared with observation alone .
espac - 3 showed no significant difference in survival between adjuvant 5 - fluorouracil / folinic acid and adjuvant gemcitabine .
but , about 15 % of patients may develop overt metastatic disease during postoperative recovery period ; therefore , early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy within 20 days after surgery has been shown to improve dfs and os [ 35 , 36 ] .
these reports may indicate we should perform combination of preoperative therapy and postoperative early adjuvant therapy for rpc cases with ca19 - 9 >= 529 .
rct trial ( preopanc trial ) as to preoperative radiochemotherapy versus immediate surgery for resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is conducted at the moment ; the results will lead our studies to further directions [ 37 ] .
the limitations of the present study were as follows .
this was a retrospective study conducted at a single institution , and the sample size was small .
approximately 5 - 10 % of the general population was lewis antigen a - and b - negative , which meant that they did not synthesize ca19 - 9 antigen and would not have elevated levels , even with pancreatic cancer .
in the present series , the data related to lewis antigens a and b could not be included .
conclusions preoperative serum ca19 - 9 level >= 529 u / ml and histological grades g2 - g4 were independent predictive factors for identifying recurrence within 1 year after pancreatectomy for rpc .
furthermore , rec1 had more frequent distant metastasis than non - rec1 , which suggested that patients experiencing recurrence within 1 year had minimally distant metastasis .
this might indicate the possibility that patients with high preoperative serum ca19 - 9 values and have potential distant metastasis despite suffering from rpc , especially , with small tumor , should receive combination of preoperative therapy and postoperative early therapy .

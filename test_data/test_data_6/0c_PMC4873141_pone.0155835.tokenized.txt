background restless leg syndrome ( rls ) is a sleep disorder with high prevalence among patients on hemodialysis .
it has been postulated that high phosphate and high parathyroid hormone may be implicated in its pathogenesis .
standard international criteria and face - to - face interview are not always applied .
methods this was an interventional prospective study in which 19 patients ( 6 men , aged 48 +/ - 11 years ) with severe hyperparathyroidism were evaluated .
rls diagnosis and rating scale were accessed based on the international rls study group pre - and post - parathyroidectomy .
patients also underwent standard polysomnography .
results at baseline , rls was present in 10 patients ( 52.6 %) , and pain was the most reported symptom associated with the diagnosis .
patients with rls had higher serum phosphate ( p = 0.008 ) that remained independently associated with rls in a logistic regression model , adjusted for hemoglobin , age and gender ( hr = 7.28 ; ci = 1.14 - 46.3 , p = 0.035 ) .
after parathyroidectomy , there was a reduction of serum parathyroid hormone , phosphate , calcium and alkaline phosphatase , and an increase of 25 ( oh ) - vitamin d , and fetuin - a. parathyroidectomy alleviated rls ( from 52 % to 21 % ; p = 0.04 ) , which was accompanied by a decrease in severity scale , in association with relief of pain and pruritus .
polysomnography in these patients showed an improvement of sleep parameters as measured by sleep efficiency , sleep latency and percentage of rem sleep .
conclusion rls is associated with high levels of phosphate in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on hemodialysis .
pain is most reported complain in these patients .
parathyroidectomy provided an opportunity to relief rls. whether the reduction of serum phosphorus or parathyroid hormone contributed to this improvement merits further investigation .

introduction restless leg syndrome ( rls ) is a movement sleep disorder characterized by voluntary leg movements prompted by an urge to move , which is often associated with unpleasant paresthesia .
the prevalence of rls in the general population is approximately 5 to 10 % of adults [ 1,2 ] , while can reach prevalence as high as 70 % [ 3 ] [ 3 - 6 ] among patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) .
the impact of rls on cardiovascular events and mortality is high for both general population [ 7 ] and patients with esrd [ 3,8 ] .
nonetheless , its underlying pathophysiology is not completely elucidated .
elevated levels of serum phosphate [ 9 ] and parathyroid hormone ( pth ) [ 10 ] were already associated with the pathogenesis of rls in patients with esrd .
a recent meta - analysis found , however , no association between pth and rls , evaluating patients on dialysis as an entire group , without distinguish those with and without hyperparathyroidism [ 11 ] .
secondary hyperparathyroidism , a condition relatively common in esrd patients , seems to be the ideal scenario for rls , as usually exhibit high phosphate and pth .
parathyroidectomy , which is a surgical treatment of this condition , on the other hand , seems to be the ideal intervention to confirm the association between phosphate , pth and rls , as it promptly corrects these biochemical abnormalities .
so far , studies on rls in secondary hyperparathyroidism are observational , have applied non - validated questionnaires , have not used face - to - face interview to confirm the diagnosis , and have not had focus specifically in rls .
nevertheless , these studies have observed an improvement of rls symptoms post - parathyroidectomy , in association with a reduction of phosphate , and an increase of the referred sleep duration .
as objective data obtained from polysomnography is lacking , and the international criteria indicated for the diagnosis of rls was not usually applied , those results are still debatable .
here , we aimed to verify if there is an improvement of rls in esrd on hemodialysis with severe hyperparathyroidism , in a prospective design , pre - and post - parathyroidectomy .
in addition , clinical presentation and polysomnography data were also obtained .
materials and methods subjects patients were recruited from the chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorder ( ckd - mbd ) outpatient clinic , in a tertiary care hospital in sao paulo , brazil ( hospital das clinicas da faculdade de medicina da universidade de sao paulo ) , from march 1 , 2013 to february 31 , 2014 .
consecutive patients attended during the study period , with a pre - established date for ptx , were invited to participate , regardless of sleep symptoms .
inclusion criteria were patients with esrd at least 18 years of age undergoing conventional hemodialysis thrice a week for at least 12 months , with severe hpts and indication for surgery treatment .
all patients underwent total ptx with a forearm parathyroid auto graft or subtotal ptx .
we excluded diabetic patients and anyone who was been treated for obstructive sleep apnea , polyneuropathy or rls .
prior to polysomnography ( psg ) , demographic characteristics , medical history , laboratory data and prescribed medications were recorded .
pain and pruritus were evaluated using the visual numeric scale .
protocol this clinical study was in conformity with the principles outlined by the declaration of helsinki .
the protocol was approved by the research ethics boards of the universidade de sao paulo ( comissao de etica para analise de projetos de pesquisa - - cappesq # 0810 / 11 ) , and all subjects provided written informed consent before participation .
we prospectively studied a selected sample of patients with esrd and severe hyperparathyroidism , on hemodialysis .
patients were invited to undergo clinical evaluation , psg , and blood work within 0 - 4 weeks pre - and 12 - 16 weeks post - ptx .
parathyroidectomy ( ptx ) patients selected for ptx were entered in a waiting list according to the chronological order .
as our institution is a tertiary academic hospital , patients on ptx waiting list were referred from many other dialysis facilities in sao paulo province .
even though the original criterion for surgery was time on the waiting list , the severity of symptoms ( such as worsening of pain , tendon rupture , new fractures ) was actually a main guide to anticipate surgery .
laboratory data all laboratory analyses were performed by standard techniques , specifically : ionic calcium [ reference range ( rr ) = 4.6 to 5.3 mg / dl ; selective ion method ] ; serum phosphate ( rr = 2.7 to 4.5 mg / dl ; enzymatic colorimetric method ) ; iron ( rr = 59 to 158 mug / dl ; enzymatic colorimetric method ) ; ferritin ( rr = 30 to 400 ng / ml ; eletroquimioluminescence method ) ; transferrin saturation index ( rr = 20 to 40 %) ; alkaline phosphatase ( rr = 32 to 122 u / l ) ; parathyroid hormone ( rr = 11 to 62 pg / ml , immunoradiometric assay ) ; 25 ( oh ) - vitamin d ( rr = 30 to 100 ng / ml ; quimioluminescence method ) ; serum fetuin - a ( rr = 0.244 to 1,000 ng / ml ; luminex xmap , milliplex analytes , millipore corp , st. charles , mi ) .
all samples were collected in fasting state .
subjective daytime sleepiness the epworth sleepiness scale ( ess ) assessed subjective daytime sleepiness .
the ess is a self - administered questionnaire designed to measure the general level of daytime sleepiness .
patients rate on a scale of 0 - 3 how likely they are to fall asleep in eight different situations commonly encountered in daily life .
total ess score ranges from 0 to 24 ; higher scores indicate more subjective sleepiness [ 12 ] .
restless leg syndrome evaluation the diagnosis of rls was established according to the international restless leg syndrome study group ( irlssg ) [ 13 ] in a face - to - face interview , by the same observer .
essential diagnostic criteria for rls included urge to move the legs , worse during rest or inactivity , worse in the evening or night and relieved by movement such as walking .
to consider the diagnosis of rls , patient should answer " yes " to all 4 questions .
pruritus or pain as isolated symptoms , without circadian characteristic and without relief with movement were not considered as rls .
patients with diagnosis of rls were asked to fill the international rls severity scale ( irls ) questionnaire .
the irls has been developed by the irlssg and comprises a 10 - item scale to enable a well - validated and easily administered measurement of rls severity .
patients are classified as having mild , moderate , severe and very severe rls according to scores 1 - 10 , 11 - 20 , 21 - 30 and 31 - 40 , respectively [ 14 ] .
polysomnography full - night assisted psg was performed to assess all sleep parameters , focusing in periodic leg movements ( plm ) .
all subjects underwent overnight psg in the sleep laboratory of otorhinolaryngology division of hospital das clinicas , which was performed using a digital system ( embla ( r ) s4500 , embla systems inc. , broomfield , co , usa ) during their usual sleep time .
the following physiological tests were performed : electroencephalography , electrooculography , electromyography , electrocardiography , and airflow detection by a thermocouple and by nasal pressure .
in addition , the following physiological parameters were evaluated : respiratory effort using thoracic and abdominal x - trace belts , snoring and body position by embla ( r ) sensors , and arterial oxygen saturation ( sao2 ) and pulse rate by an embla ( r ) oximeter .
signals were recorded on a computerized sleep recording system ( remlogict psg software ) and seen by a neurologist and sleep specialist blind to the moment of study ( pre or post ptx ) according standard criteria .
the eeg and leg movements were classified with the use of standard techniques and scoring criteria for sleep stages and arousals from sleep [ 15 ] .
obstructive apnea was defined as a > 90 % reduction of tidal volume for >= 10 seconds in the presence of out - of - phase thoracoabdominal motion , and obstructive hypopnea was defined as a 50 % to 90 % reduction in tidal volume from baseline for >= 10 seconds with out - of - phase thoracoabdominal motion or airflow limitation on nasal pressure .
apneas were classified as central in the absence of thoracoabdominal motion , and hypopneas were classified as central in the presence of in - phase thoracoabdominal motion and without airflow limitation on nasal pressure .
the severity of sleep apnea was classified according to ahi : mild ( ahi between 5 and 15 ) , moderate ( ahi between 15 and 30 ) and severe ( ahi > 30 ) .
statistical analysis comparisons of continuous values from pre to post - ptx were done by paired t test or wilcoxon matched test , appropriately .
for categorical variables , a chi - square test was performed .
relationships between single variables were examined by the spearman or pearson correlation coefficient according to data distribution .
logistic regression analysis was also undertaken with rls as the dependent variable and with age , hemoglobin and gender as the independent variables .
data are presented as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) unless indicated otherwise .
a p value < 0.05 was considered significant .
analyses were performed with the use of spss 21.0.1 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) and graphpad prism 6 software ( graphpad software inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
results in total , 30 patients were screened of whom 5 did not agree to participate , 2 were excluded because of insufficient sleep at sleep laboratory ( sleep efficiency < 20 %) , and four underwent pre - but refused to perform post - ptx psg .
demographic , clinical and biochemical characteristics pre - and post - ptx of the remaining 19 patients ( 6 males ) who underwent both pre - and post - ptx psg are described .
in general , our study population was relatively young , 48 +/ - 11 years , with long dialysis vintage [ 94 ( 60,131 ) , ranging for 20 to 192 months ] .
the etiology of esrd was hypertension in 6 patients ( 31.6 %) , chronic glomerulonephritis in 2 patients ( 10.5 %) , chronic pyelonephritis in other 2 patients ( 10.5 %) , three patients with other causes ( 15.8 %) and 6 patients with unknown cause ( 31.6 %) .
three patients ( 15.8 %) informed that they had smoking habits .
five patients were taking vitamin d analogues ( 2 with and 3 without rls ) .
none of them were receiving cinacalcet .
rls was found in 10 patients ( 52.6 %) pre ptx .
pain was the most reported symptom associated with the diagnosis , presented in 6 patients , while paresthesia was reported only in 4 patients .
table 1 shows demographic , clinical , biochemical and sleep parameters characteristics regarding rls diagnosis .
there were no significant differences in most of the baseline characteristics among patients with and without rls , with the exception of most severe pain and higher serum phosphate among those with rls .
there were no differences in any sleep parameter , with a trend towards higher plmi in patients with rls .
logistic regression showed that serum phosphate remained the only independent variable associated with rls ( hr = 7.28 ; ci = 1.14 - 46.3 , p = 0.035 ) , in a model adjusted for hemoglobin , age and gender .
the severity of rls pre - ptx correlated with the dose of erythropoietin / kg / week ( r = 0.689 , p = 0.039 ) .
there was no correlation between the severity of rls and serum 25 ( oh ) - vitamin d ( p = 0.656 ) .

discussion the major findings of this study were as following : 1 .
using standard and recommended criteria for the diagnosis of rls , we confirmed a high prevalence of this syndrome in patients with esrd on hemodialysis ; 2 .
pain , instead of paresthesia , was the main reported complain in these patients ; 3 .
high serum phosphate was independently associated with rls ; 4 .
there was an alleviation of rls symptoms following ptx ; 5 .
sleep parameters have improved in patients with rls after ptx .
in agreement of previous studies [ 3 - 6 ] , we found a high prevalence of rls ( 52.6 %) , in patients with esrd , although such comparison is not trustful , as not all studies have applied the irlssg diagnostic criteria .
there are two currently theories involved in the pathogenesis of rls , iron and dopamine metabolisms , suggesting a dysfunction of hypothalamic dopaminergic cells that are the source of spinal cord dopamine .
in this regard , patients with esrd , who usually have iron depletion , may be at high risk of rls .
in the present study , however , the alleviation of rls post ptx cannot be imputed to iron stores , as there was no change in iron , transferrin saturation and ferritin from pre - to post - ptx .
interesting , the severity of rls was correlated with the dose of erythropoietin / kg / week , which may be related to inflammation and resistance to the action of erythropoietin .
patients with rls do not usually report pain , and parethesia is the most usual complain .
even the rls international guidelines do not call attention for this symptom .
we can speculate that , at least for patients with severe hyperparathyroidism , pain , though explained as bone pain , may reflect , in fact , the presence of rls .
although we have applied a specific questionnaire for rls diagnosis , it must be stressed that some symptoms such as pruritus and pain are very common among patients on dialysis , and might be alleviated by ptx , regardless of rls presence .
we trust that the diagnosis of rls was not influenced by the presence of these symptoms .
indeed , several patients presented pruritus and pain and did not fit the criteria for rls diagnosis .
nevertheless , " pain " instead of any other symptom , was the main complain we have verified among patients with rls on hemodialysis , and the guidelines do not even mention to this particularity .
high levels of phosphate before parathyroidectomy were independently associated to the presence of rls , a finding that was previously verified by takaki and col .
in patients on hemodialysis [ 9 ] .
phosphate can be considered a uremic toxin [ 16 ] based on its biological effects , and also based on adverse effects of hyperphosphatemia .
it 's already known that high levels of phosphate are deleterious to the cardiovascular system [ 17 ] .
perhaps , phosphate may configure as a uremic toxin also due to its effects on sleep disorders .
although already described , we found no association between rls and pth , possibly because of the study design where all patients have high levels pre - and low levels post - ptx , regardless of the rls presence .
hyperparathyroidism is almost universal in esrd .
ptx remains the primary therapeutic means for medication - refractory shpt patients .
bone pain , pruritus , fractures , cardiovascular disease and mortality are its major outcomes and all of them can be reduced by such surgical treatment [ 18 ] , with a significantly reduction in rates of all - cause and cardiovascular mortality in these patients [ 19 ] .
we evaluated patients with severe hpts [ median serum levels of ipth 1554 ( 972 , 2814 )] refractory to available medical therapy , including dietary phosphate restriction , calcium - free phosphate binders , and calcitriol .
this situation has given us a unique opportunity to assess an alleviation of ptx - related rls .
we confirmed previous report [ 20 ] , demonstrating that ptx could relieve rls in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism .
in addition , we have demonstrated that ptx could reduce the severity of rls in those patients that remained with this diagnosis .
an important aspect of our study was the use of the international and validated questionnaire for the rls diagnosis , and the face - to - face interview , as other comorbidities can mimic the symptoms of rls .
furthermore , another unique finding of the current study is showing that psg data did improve after parathyroidectomy .
previous studies that have demonstrated an increase in sleep duration and improvement on sleep quality , either following parathyroidectomy [ 20,21 ] , or when comparing patients with and without rls , [ 21,22 ] , were based on subjective data with no polysomnography measurement .
we found no improvement on sleep respiratory parameters , which was not a surprise .
however , we expected to find some improvement in sleep efficiency , which did not occur .
due the small number of patients evaluated , further studies with psg data are necessary before definitely conclude whether ptx is capable to improve sleep quality .
hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased risk of other sleep disorders , such as insomnia , accompanied by bone pain , pruritus and general weakness [ 23 ] .
previous studies have shown an improvement of sleep disorders , sleep hours per night and severity of insomnia following ptx , in association with amelioration of those symptoms [ 21 ] .
however , there was no psg data confirming these findings .
in the present study , we have demonstrated that successful ptx relieved the symptoms of pain and pruritus , in association with an improvement on sleep architecture .
as an additional finding , we have confirmed that serum fetuin - a levels increased after ptx , which was previously demonstrated by wang and col [ 24 ] .
since fetuin - a is one of the several potential vascular calcification inhibitors in chronic kidney disease patients [ 25 ] , an increase in its levels may be beneficial , as it was associated with a significant reduction in the all - cause mortality of uremic patients [ 26 ] .
levels of 25 ( oh ) - vitamin d increased after ptx as a result of oral supplementation , which could be contributed to the alleviation of rls , as previously described [ 27 ] .
however , as all patients receiving vitamin d supplementation , regardless the diagnosis of rls , other studies are need to assess the role of vitamin supplementation in this population .
certain limitations of this study should be considered .
first , the relatively small sample size might have reduced the ability to find differences between patients with and without rls .
we partially overcome this issue , by analysing the same patient pre and post a major intervention ( ptx ) .
also , it might influence the multivariable analyses , and the overfitting should not be completed eliminated .
another limitation is that we have tested the rls in a short time period after ptx , and this result must be confirmed in a long - term study .
still , the straights of the present study are demonstrating , based on standard criteria , and face - to - face interview that ptx may improve rls and sleep architecture .
in summary , rls , a disable and painful condition in patients with esrd can be relieved by parathyroidectomy .
serum phosphate is so far , the main marker of this disease .
it is recognized that ptx can improve survival , and rls should be also kept in mind as another potential target to indicate this surgical treatment .

cytotoxic t - lymphocyte antigen 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , an immune - checkpoint receptor and regulator of t - cell activation , has become an important therapeutic target for immunotherapy in cancer and autoimmune diseases .
to date , clinical trials involving cancer immunotherapies , such checkpoint blocking antibodies directed at ctla - 4 ( ipilimumab ) , have excluded patients with underlying autoimmune disease given concern for potential triggering of autoimmune exacerbations .
we present the first known cases to our knowledge of two patients with active autoimmune diseases who received ipilimumab .
in this limited clinical experience , no serious exacerbations of underlying autoimmunity have yet been observed , and one patient benefited from ipilimumab .
these cases advocate for further investigation of the safety of cancer immunotherapies in cancer patients with underlying autoimmune conditions in carefully designed clinical trials with cautious monitoring .
keywords immunotherapy ipilimumab immune - related adverse events ( iraes ) autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis melanoma issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background cytotoxic t - lymphocyte antigen 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , an immune - checkpoint receptor and regulator of t - cell activation , has become an important therapeutic target for immunotherapy in cancer .
ipilimumab , a fully human antibody that blocks ctla - 4 , was the first immunomodulatory checkpoint inhibitor approved by the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) for patients with advanced melanoma [ 1,2 ] .
treatment with ipilimumab can be associated with inflammatory side effects , termed " immune - related adverse events " ( iraes ) [ 3,4 ] .
given the critical role of ctla - 4 in maintaining immunologic homeostasis , clinical trials involving ipilimumab and cancer immunotherapies in general have excluded patients with underlying autoimmune diseases out of concern for triggering autoimmune exacerbations in these individuals .
in preclinical models , anti - ctla - 4 treatment is known to enhance onset and severity of several t cell - mediated experimental autoimmune diseases , including murine models of encephalomyelitis [ 5,6 ] , myasthenia gravis [ 7 ] , and type 1 diabetes [ 8 ] .
yet , the clinical experience treating patients with ipilimumab who have advanced melanoma and concomitant , underlying autoimmune diseases has not been described .
we report two patients with advanced melanoma and a concomitant autoimmune disorder who were treated with ipilimumab ; one had multiple sclerosis and another had rheumatoid arthritis .
ipilimumab was well tolerated in both patients without related exacerbation of their known autoimmune disease .
one patient had a profound anti - tumor effect from ipilimumab .
case presentation 1 a 52 - year - old man was diagnosed in march 2010 with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) when he presented to a neurologist with episodes of fatigue , lower extremity paresthesias , and bowel and bladder incontinence .
the diagnosis of ms was made based upon the mcdonald criteria with multiple clinical events associated with characteristic imaging findings [ 9 ] .
he received initial treatment with glatiramer 20 mg daily via subcutaneous injection ( an immunomodulatory drug that activates regulatory t - lymphocyte suppressor cells ) and dalfampridine 20 mg twice daily orally ( a potassium channel blocker affecting nerve conduction ) .
after a year of treatment , he then received interferon beta 44mcg three times weekly via subcutaneous injection .
his ms , characterized as the relapsing - remitting subtype , was active as he had suffered flares associated with increased weakness once every few months , requiring hospitalization and subsequent rehabilitation .
nonetheless , he was fully ambulatory and independent with his activities of daily living .
the patient 's melanoma history began shortly after initiation of treatment for ms when the patient first noted a lump on his right lower back .
shave biopsy revealed invasive , ulcerated melanoma to a depth of at least 3.5 mm breslow thickness .
he then underwent a wide excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy .
sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed micrometastatic disease in one lymph node in the right axilla , and a separate lymph node with melanoma was involved in the right inguinal region .
molecular analysis showed no detectable braf v600 mutation .
after extensive discussion of options , the patient elected a program of vigilant observation rather than complete lymph node dissection of the two involved lymph node basins .
interferon alpha was discussed , but due to the patient 's active multiple sclerosis , he was thought not to be a good candidate for aggressive adjuvant therapy .
nine months after wide excision , patient 's cancer recurred as multiple skin nodules involving his right flank , as well as right groin and right axilla lymphadenopathy .
excisional biopsy of a right groin nodule revealed metastatic melanoma .
he was treated initially with temozolomide 75 mg / m2 daily in an extended dosing regimen [ 10 ] .
after one month , a computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed evidence of disease progression with worsening lymphadenopathy , as well as progressive subcutaneous lesions on his right flank .
due to limited treatment options and after carefully considering the risks and benefits of treatment , standard ipilimumab was initiated at 3 mg / kg every three weeks for four doses .
during ipilimumab , he had no significant iraes and no exacerbation of his ms. he continued to receive interferon beta treatment for his multiple sclerosis while receiving ipilimumab .
unfortunately , after completing ipilimumab , a positron emission tomography ( pet ) scan showed progressive disease with worsening widespread metastatic melanoma .
despite subsequent treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel , he died due to melanoma progression in march 2013 .
case presentation 2 a 67 - year - old woman presented to a rheumatologist with anemia , weight loss , and multiple joint effusions .
based upon clinical criteria as per the american college of rheumatology / european league against rheumatism collaborative initiative [ 11 ] , she was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) in 2007 .
she underwent a left knee aspiration , showing 16,000 white blood cells with neutrophil predominance .
she was then started on treatment with prednisone 20 mg daily and methotrexate 15 mg weekly with significant improvement in her symptoms .
around this time , she was also diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma .
she first noticed a pigmented lesion on her right calf in 2005 .
biopsy of the right leg lesion was performed , with pathology revealing invasive melanoma , 0.72 mm in breslow thickness , no ulceration was seen .
local excision of the melanoma and right inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy one month later showed no residual malignant melanoma .
following initial surgical resection , the patient remained without melanoma recurrence until november 2011 when she noticed subcutaneous lesions in the left anterior neck and right lower back .
she underwent skin excisional biopsy of the suspicious site on her right lower back with pathology consistent with metastatic melanoma .
molecular analysis revealed no apparent mutation in braf , nras or kit .
whole body pet / ct scan revealed metastatic disease with multiple lung and subcutaneous nodules .
though ipilimumab was initially considered , it was deferred out of concern it would exacerbate the patient 's ra , which still required methotrexate and low - dose corticosteroids for maintenance .
instead , the patient was treated on a clinical trial involving a gamma secretase inhibitor in combination with cisplatin , vinblastine , and temozolomide ( cvt ) chemotherapy .
despite initial clinical benefit with this regimen , melanoma progression was observed eight months later .
given limited treatment options , ipilimumab was pursued after a complete discussion of its potential risks and benefits in the setting of known ra. in october 2012 , the patient was initiated on a course of ipilimumab ( 3 mg / kg every three weeks for four doses ) .
after completing four doses of ipilimumab , subsequent imaging showed partial response , with overall decreased bilateral lung nodules , soft tissue and osseous involvement ( figure 1 ) .
following completion of ipilimumab , she did note slightly increased bilateral knee pain consistent with known osteoarthritis rather than ra , and this was effectively treated with celecoxib .
throughout this course , the patient was maintained on methotrexate 15 mg weekly and low - dose prednisone ( 5 mg daily ) .
figure 1 timeline of treatment and demonstration of response .
( a ) baseline chest ct scan prior to ipilimumab showed multiple subcutaneous , intramuscular , and pulmonary nodules ( largest nodule indicated by white arrow ) .
( b ) two months after completion of four treatments with ipilimumab , restaging pet scan showed decreased size of lung nodules , soft tissue and osseous involvement .
( c ) repeat ct scan showed near radiographic resolution of lung nodule .
( d ) timeline of described events ( not to scale ) .
in january 2014 , over one year since starting ipilimumab , a computed tomography ( ct ) scan demonstrated slow progression of disease .
given the long initial response , ipilimumab re - induction has been pursued , and she is currently undergoing this treatment .
she has had no worsening symptoms related to ra throughout the remainder of course to date .
conclusions we describe two patients with active autoimmune diseases treated with ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma due to limited alternative treatment options .
to our knowledge , this is the first description of patients with active autoimmune diseases to have received ipilimumab .
despite the known irae profile of ipilimumab and the theoretical concern that ipilimumab could exacerbate an underlying autoimmune disorder , whether ipilimumab truly exacerbates underlying autoimmune conditions remains unknown .
the patient described in case 2 had benefit from ipilimumab .
in this patient , the ongoing immune suppression ( corticosteroids and methotrexate ) required to optimally treat ra , did not preclude a response to ipilimumab .
this finding is consistent with other recently published cases where patients benefited from ipilimumab , despite ongoing low - dose immunosuppression needed for prior solid organ transplants [ 12 ] .
there remains no published literature documenting that concurrent immunosuppressive treatments eliminate the possibility of a favorable therapeutic outcome from ipilimumab , and the potential benefit of ipilimumab in this context merits further study .
notably , patient 1 was diagnosed with melanoma soon after starting immunosuppression for ms. patient 2 experienced a melanoma recurrence after initiation of immunosuppression for ra. while initial immunosuppression and timing of melanoma may have been completely independent events and due to increased clinical contact , it is theoretically possible that they were related as has been previously described [ 13 ] .
we recognize these are only two patient experiences , and anecdotal experiences cannot be seen as definitive evidence for the safety of immunotherapy in this setting .
the experiences with these two patients' autoimmune conditions may also not be generalizable to patients with other autoimmune disorders , which may have different underlying pathophysiology .
nevertheless , these experiences advocate for further evaluation of cancer immunotherapies for patients with underlying autoimmune conditions .
professional societies and patient advocacy groups may consider mechanisms for patient registries , and carefully designed clinical trials with cautious monitoring will help to increase our understanding of immunotherapies in this patient population .
this may become increasingly important as approaches targeting the programmed cell death - 1 ( pd - 1 ) receptor , which is typically associated with minimal inflammatory toxicity , expand in multiple malignancies .
such efforts will help define the tenuous line between enhancing antitumor immunity and avoiding exacerbation of an underlying autoimmune disorder .

the functional deficiencies of bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) may contribute to the aging process and age - related diseases , such as osteoporosis .
although it has been reported that micrornas ( mirnas ) played an important role in mechanisms of gene regulation of aging , and their expression profiles in mscs osteogenic differentiation were established in recent years , but it is still elusive for the dynamic patterns of mirnas in aging process .
importantly , the mirnas in aged bone tissue had not been yet reported so far .
here , we combined high through - put sequencing with computational techniques to detect mirnas dynamics in mscs and bone tissue of age - related osteoporosis .
among the detected mirnas , 59 identified mirnas in mscs and 159 in bone showed significantly differential expressions. and more importantly , there existed 8 up - regulated and 30 down - regulated mirnas in both mscs and bone during the aging process , with the majority having a trend of down - regulation .
furthermore , after target prediction and kegg pathway analysis , we found that their targeted genes were significantly enriched in pathways in cancer , which are complex genetic networks , comprise of a number of age - related pathways .
these results strongly suggest that these analyzed mirnas may be negatively involved in age - related osteoporosis , given that most of them showed a decreased expression , which could lay a good foundation for further functional analysis of these mirnas in age - related osteoporosis .

introduction aging increases the risk to develop several diseases , such as osteoporosis , which is regarded as highly age - related [ 1 ] , featuring the bone loss and susceptibility to fragility fractures [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
theoretically , as an attractive therapeutic candidates for several diseases and degenerative applications , mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) have also been evaluated as a vital factor in the development of osteoporosis , since it keeps the ability of self - renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types , including osteocytes , chondrocytes , and adipocytes [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
indeed , recently , it has been reported that the functional deficiencies of mscs could lead to the declining of bone integrity and function in the elderly [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
moreover , other studies showed that mscs were involved in continuous maintenance and repair of bone during aging [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
environmentally , the neighboring aged tissues should also be taken into account , for they could exert potential impact on mscs , further causing the decrease in regenerative potential of bone [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
furthermore , epigenetically , micrornas ( mirna ) could influence many basic cellular and pathological processes by regulating gene expression post - transcriptionally through binding to complementary sequences in the 3 ' untranslated region ( 3 ' utr ) of target mrnas [ 16 ]. and recent studies showed that mirnas participated in regulation of aging and a variety of age - associated pathways [ 17 ] .
for example , inukai et al .
[ 18 ] screened mirna expression by using brains from mice of different ages and found that there was a global downward trend of mirna expression during aging .
additionally , mori et al .
[ 19 ] observed an attenuated mirna processing in adipose tissues during aging in mice , worm , and human , suggesting that it could be a conserved feature of aging .
hence , as for osteoporosis , being an age - related disease , it may be closely linked to mirna expressions .
however , to date , only limited types of tissues or organs have been analyzed in the mouse and human [ 15 ] .
yet little is known about the mirna expression in the bone of mouse at different ages .
here , in this study , to acquire a better understanding of potential contributions of mirnas to age - related osteoporosis , we used high through - put deep sequencing to perform a comprehensive survey of mirna expressions in mscs and bone tissue based on a mouse model of osteoporosis .
this study could provide reliable evidence for further uncovering the development mechanisms of osteoporosis in human during aging .
results construction of a small rna library [ 20 ] by deep sequencing mscs in order to detect the mirnas dynamics in age - related osteoporosis , a small rna library of mscs samples in three groups were obtained by deep sequencing .
overall , 14,565,370 clean reads were detected in young group ( 2 m ) , 13,834,317 clean reads were detected in adult group ( 8 m ) , and 13,001,553 clean reads were detected in old group ( 25 m ) .
after alignment to the mouse genome ( mm9 ) , the results indicated that 11,843,150 ( 81.31 %) reads in young mscs , 11,194,206 ( 80.92 %) reads in adult mscs and 10,666,211 ( 82.04 %) reads in old mscs were matched to mm9 .
the small rnas were classified into different categories according to their biogenesis and annotation .
among the total reads , the ratio of noncoding rna , including rrna , trna , snrna and snorna accounted for 1.99 % , 1.3 % and 1.03 % in young , adult and old group , respectively ( table s1 ) .
the remaining small rnas were retained for further analysis .
bone tissue total rna of the bone tissue samples of femurs and tibiae from three groups were extracted , subsequently , we used high through - put sequencing to identify mirna profiles in bone .
14,979,697 clean reads , 14,597,780 and 10,899,301 clean reads were detected in young , adult and old group , respectively .
but unlike the mscs , there had a much lower genome - matched rate in three bone groups .
the ratio was 54.75 % ( 8,201,928 ) , 68.63 % ( 10,017,983 ) and 64.00 % ( 6,975,893 ) in young , adult and old bone , respectively .
at the same time , the rates of rrna , trna , snrna and snorna were increased in bone ; they were 32.8 % , 28.8 % and 18.9 % in young , adult and old group , respectively ( table s1 ) .
mirnas profiles in age - related osteoporosis to investigate mirna expressions in age - related osteoporosis , genome - aligned reads correspond to known mirnas were compared with mirbase database ( mirbase18 ) to obtain the mirna count .
the total 1157 mirnas were detected ; however , only 587 , 578 , and 574 mirnas were expressed in 2 m - mscs , 8 m - mscs and 25 m - mscs , respectively ( table s2 ) .
for bone tissue samples , there were 676 , 657 and 603 mirnas expressions in 2 m - bone , 8 m - bone and 25 m - bone , respectively ( table s3 ) .
differential expressions of known mirna to analyze the variance of mirnas that is differentially regulated during bone aging process of mice , we compared the known mirna expressions between two samples to find out the differentially expressed mirna .
the expression of mirna in two samples was shown by plotting log2 - ratio figure and scatter plot .
for mscs , the expression levels of mirnas were shown in table s4 and figure 1a - c. for bone , the expression levels of mirnas were shown in table s5 and figure 1d - f. to generate a convinced list of mirnas variation in age - related osteoporosis , we filtered these data step by step .
firstly , selecting two - fold altered expression between the 2 m and 25 m samples , and ensuring p - value < 0.05 .
the expression data were in table s6 .
in mscs , there were 59 mirnas differently expressed , the mirna expression changes were shown in figure 2a .
comparing the numbers between down - regulated and up - regulated mirnas ( 30 versus 29 ) , we found that it reached a new homeostasis for the whole mirna pattern in aged mscs .
in other words , there existed the transition of steady state of mirna dynamics in different aged mscs .
however , from figure 2b , we could find the changes of mirna expressions in 2 m and 25 m bone , in 159 changed mirnas , majority of them were down - regulated in old bone ( 114 versus 45 ) .
interestingly , some mirnas changes trends were opposite in mscs and bone ( red cells in table s6 ) .
so , secondly , considering the mirna expressions showed a consistent changing trend either decreasingly or increasingly among the three samples of mscs and bone .
finally , screening the common mirnas existed in the mscs and bone , and ensuring the p - value < 0.05 ( table s7 ) .
the results showed that there were 8 up - regulated and 30 down - regulated known mirnas during bone aging ( table 1 ) .
biological functions of corresponding mirnas are involved in aging and osteoblastic differentiation was shown in table 2 .

except for mir - 10b , other mirnas showed similar expression trends in qpcr and deep sequencing data .
this result suggests that high through - put sequencing is an effective method for identifying mature mirnas , and shows our prospect on the further research on the function of single mirna .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071895.g003 figure 3 mirna expression validated by qrt - pcr in mscs and bone .
qpcr results were normalized to u6 snrna expression levels .
values showed that these mirnas were significantly different between 2m and 25m samples .
computational target prediction of changed mirnas and pathway analysis to identify the potential targets of changed mirnas , we computationally identified mrna targets of mirnas using the software mireap ( software developed by bgi ) .
to annotate the target genes corresponding to certain biological function during bone aging , we used go ( gene ontology ) enrichment analysis to reveal the functions significantly related with predicted target gene candidates of changed mirnas .
the significantly enriched go terms of biological process in genes repressed by changed mirnas were shown in table 3 and table 4 .
to further understand the biological functions of changed mirnas , kegg pathway analysis was carried out among the predicted target genes of mirnas .
the kegg analysis could reveal the main pathways which the target gene candidates are involved in. for up - regulated mirnas , we found that cell cycle pathway ( ko04110 , p - value = 0.01621647 ) , pathways in cancer ( ko05200 , p - value = 0.01038872 ) and calcium signaling pathway ( ko04020 , p - value = 0.006787428 ) were significantly targeted kegg pathways ( figure s1a - c ) .
these pathways were correlated with cell proliferation , osteogenic differentiation , and aging. and for down - regulated mirnas , pathways in cancer ( ko05200 , p - value = 0.01555212 ) was significantly targeted kegg pathway ( figure s1d ) .

hence , here only mir - 31 was chosen as representative , for it has been shown to be associated with aging and osteogenic differentiation in some other studies .
after kegg analysis , its target genes were indeed enriched in the p53 and wnt signaling pathways , which are important parts of ko05200 ( figure 4 , table s8 ) .
notably , based on the literature , p53 signaling pathway is associated with aging and wnt pathway is associated with cell differentiation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071895.g004 figure 4 the correlated pathways were predicted to be targeted by mir - 31 .

materials and methods animals male c57bl / 6j mice ( experimental animal center of fourth military medical university , china ) , 2 months - old ( young group ) , 8 months - old ( adult group ) and 25 months - old ( old group , osteoporosis ) were used , each group had three samples .
ethics statement all animal experiments were performed under an animal study protocol approved by the ethics committee of fourth military medical university .
cell culture and bone collect femurs and tibiae were isolated from nine mice .
the bone marrow was flushed out with alpha - mem ( gibco , new york , ny , usa ) containing 20 % fbs ( gibco , new york , ny , usa ) and seeded in 90 - mm dishes , cultures were refeeded every 3 ~ 4 days , maintained about 15 days , then cells were passaged .
the femurs and tibiae without bone marrow were stored in liquid nitrogen .
rna preparation total cellular rna was extracted from the second passage mscs using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions. and the total rna of femurs and tibiae was extracted as described by the office of shared research facilities in the university of chicago ( http :// fgf.uchicago.edu / protocols _ microarray.php ) , with slight modifications .
in brief , guanidine buffer ( containing 7.5 ulbeta - me per ml ) was replaced by trizol reagent , and phenol / chloroform / isoamyl alcohol was replaced by chloroform / isoamyl alcohol .
high through - put deep sequencing high through - put deep sequencing was carried out using hiseq2000 sequencer ( illumina ) ; the sequencing procedure was described by chen et al .
[ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
then the small rna digitalization analysis based on the the image files generated by the sequencer were processed .
the 50 nt sequence tags from hiseq sequencing go through the data cleaning first , which included getting rid of the low quality tags and several kinds of contaminants from the 50 nt tags .
clean reads that correspond to known mirnas were compared with a mirbase database ( release 18.0 ) and the total copy number of each sample was normalized to 1,000,000 .
the data was processed using software developed by bgi .
the high through - put sequencing data for this study have been submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / traces / sra ) under accession number sra072825 and sra074415 .
known mirna expression analysis considering the diversity of mirna expression changes with age , we studied samples ( mscs and bone ) from 2 , 8 and 25 months - old mice to generate a convinced list of mirnas variation in age - related osteoporosis .
primarily , we compared the known mirna expressions between two samples , including 2 m versus 8 m , 8 m versus 25 m and 2 m versus 25 m. then , the data were screened step by step .
mirna expressions between the 2 m and 25 m samples were analyzed in detail , the mirna with two - fold changed expressions ( p - value < 0.05 ) were selected .
after that , we analyzed the data of 8 m samples , selected the mirnas with consistent changing trend during aging process for further study .
at last , we confirmed the convinced list of mirnas variation by screening the common mirnas existed in the mscs and bone .
mirna target prediction and functional analysis targets for known mirnas were predicted using software mireap ( software developed by bgi ) .
go enrichment analysis of target gene candidates was carried out according to the go terms in the database ( http :// www.geneontology.org /) .
kegg pathway analysis is also used for the target gene candidates .
genes with fdr < 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched in target gene candidates .
quantitative rt - pcr assay for real time pcr validation , mirna cdna was obtained according to specification of the one step primescript mirna cdna synthesis kit ( takara , japan ) , equal amounts of cdna were used in duplicate and amplified with sybr premix ex taq ii ( takara , japan ) .
mature dna sense sequences ( mirbase http :// microrna.sanger.ac.uk /) of tested mirnas were used as forward pcr primers .
u6 snrna was used as internal standard .
all real time pcr reactions were performed on bio - rad cfx manager .
mirna fold changes between different groups were calculated by the 2 - deltadeltact method .
all assays were done with three wells per condition in three independent experiments .
statistics differences were statistically evaluated by student 's t - test .
unless otherwise stated , p - value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
discussion global expression profiling of mirnas in various aged tissues or organs of different species have been performed .
however , few data on mirnas pattern are available so far in terms of age - related osteoporosis .
in present results , we provided mirnas dynamics in mscs and bone tissue of age - related osteoporosis and further performed target prediction and kegg pathway analysis , which strongly suggested that multiple mirnas may be involved in this complex process .
as multipotent adult stem cells , mscs are capable of differentiating into osteoblast cells , however , many studies proved that this ability declined with age [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
on the molecular level , an increasing number of mirnas have been identified to regulate osteogenic differentiation of mscs [ 8 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
therefore , mirnas are crucial in the bone aging process .
however , aside from wagner et al .
[ 5 ] revealed an up - regulation of mir - 371 , mir - 369 - 5p , mir - 29c , mir - 499 and let - 7f upon in human mscs replicative senescence , there was no reports for mirna expression profiling of mscs in aging process .
in our results , compared with the young group , 30 down - regulated and 29 up - regulated mirnas were identified in the old mscs group .
the overall level of changes was no significant difference .
due to the fact that one cell type failed to represent the overall mirna alteration in one organism [ 15 ] , so , next we compared the mirnas expression changes between the young and old bone tissues .
among which in total 114 mirnas and 45 mirnas showed significant decreasing and increasing expressions , respectively .
notably , the majority of mirnas were down - regulated ( fold change >= 2 ) in bone , meaning that aged tissue environment might play important roles in bone aging process .
after carefully screening step by step , 8 up - regulated and 30 down - regulated mirnas in both mscs and bone were confirmed. that is to say , during aging process , the bone exhibits predominant mirna down - regulation , which was in agreement with other mirna studies on aging tissues and organisms [ 16 ] , [ 45 ] .
however , compared with other studies , some known sa - mi - rnas [ 46 ] , like mir - 34a [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , mir - 499 [ 5 ] , [ 49 ] , mir - 605 [ 50 ] , mir - 17 [ 16 ] , [ 51 ] and so on , there was no significant difference in our study .
one possibility was the difference of tissue specific , or because of in our study only common mirnas in mscs and bone were considered .
possibly , the descend trend could be associated with dicer , since recently study has provided evidence that the dicer was declined with age [ 17 ] , this might explain the decreases of multiple mirnas in aging process .
additionally , other groups demonstrated that dicer deficiency in osteoblast dominantly suppressed the bone formation [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , and further showed that dicer generated mirnas are essential for the bone formation .
therefore , it is speculated that the down - regulated mirnas may play protective roles in the bone aging .
large numbers of studies have reported that mirnas regulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation [ 42 ] , [ 54 ] .
so , the next interesting point for us is how these changed mirnas functioned in the bone aging process .
when referring to literature , the mechanism of mirnas worked by inhibiting gene expression , including positive and negative transcriptional factor and cytokine regulators , which are target genes of mirnas [ 55 ] , and regulate bone phenotype through certain biological processes [ 54 ] .
we firstly used go enrichment analysis to reveal the biological processes related with predicted target gene candidates of changed mirnas .
results showed that the go term transport ( go : 0006810 ) significantly was enriched in the predicted target genes of both up - regulated and down - regulated mirnas .
especially for the up - regulated mirna related target genes , they enriched in go terms regulation of response to stimulus ( go : 0048583 ) and cell differentiation ( go : 0030154 ) .
this result suggests us the up - regulated mirnas might suppress some genes associated with the ability to respond on external stimulus .
for example , the response of the cells to higher ros ( reactive oxygen species ) levels , the mscs from old mice might reduce ros defense for the low expression level of related genes , further resulting in bone aging [ 13 ] .
on the other hand , osteogenic differentiation of mscs decline with age is clear , so , the differentiation - related gene was inhibited by the up - regulated mirnas might be one of the reasons that caused age - related osteoporosis .
for example , mir - 214 , which displayed up - regulation , could target atf4 , a positive transcription factor regulated osteoblast function , to inhibit bone formation [ 56 ] .
some studies reported that mirna can affect pathways involved in aging , including p53 pathway , igf pathway , mtor pathway and sirtuins [ 15 ] .
in our study , we analyzed the kegg pathways of target genes that were related with significant alterations in mirna expressions .
cell cycle pathway , calcium signaling pathway and pathways in cancer were significantly targeted kegg pathways of up - regulated mirnas , thereinto , pathways in cancer were affect by down - regulated mirnas as well .
these results suggest that the up - regulated mirnas inhibited their target genes , which might mediate cell cycle control and regulate calcium ion homeostasis , which were important factors influencing the mscs aging and mineralisation .
moreover , cancer is an age - related disease as well , so the mirna regulates the pathways in cancer was reasonable in our study .
however , according to the figure s1 , almost all of genes in cancer pathways ( ko05200 ) were targeted by up - and down - regulated mirnas , especially for most down - regulated mirnas , it was hard for us to make appropriate judgments on which pathways play more important roles during bone aging process .
so , in this study , we selected one of validated mirnas to study its enriched pathways of likely targets , and analyzed the genes with known roles in aging or osteogenesis .
mir - 31 , which was down - regulated in our study , and some published studies reported the function of mir - 31 in aging , radio - resistance , cancer and cell differentiation .
for example , lynam - lennon et al [ 57 ] found that mir - 31 directly targeted 13 genes involved in dna repair to decrease cellular defense against dna damage .
goff et al [ 58 ] reported that mir - 31 might be an inhibitor of the osteocyte differentiation pathway .
another study also showed that mir - 31 was under - expressed in osteo - differentiated mscs [ 43 ] .
rokah et al [ 59 ] found that mir - 31 regulated cell cycle related genes , like cyclind1 .
in our result , mir - 31 was down - regulated during bone aging process , after kegg enrichment analysis , we found that several negative regulator of wnt signal pathway , such as dkk1 , gsk - 3beta and ccnd1 were targeted by mir - 31 .
it has been recognized that wnt signaling plays an important role in the regulation of bone formation [ 60 ] and aging [ 61 ] .
moreover , we also found cyclind1 was a target gene of mir - 31 , which was a crosstalk of wnt pathway and p53 pathway .
it is noteworthy that p53 is well known as an age - related protein [ 62 ] , and has ability to decrease bone mass [ 63 ] .
as stated above , mir - 31 might play an important role in regulating the age - related osteoporosis through its target genes , which were regulators in wnt and / or p53 signal pathways .
in conclusion , age - related osteoporosis is a complex process , so , it was impossible to specify individual mirna or signal pathway has decisive influence on bone aging .
it was important to know how the networks of mirnas and signal pathways operate temporally ; the research on the networks and roles of mirnas and / or their targeting genes in age - related osteoporosis was our further object .

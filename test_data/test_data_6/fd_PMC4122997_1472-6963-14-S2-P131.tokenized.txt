the objectives of this study were to examine surgeon decision - making related to referral to oncology services for potentially curable non - small - cell lung , breast , or colorectal cancer patients , and to identify the specific factors that influence their decision to refer ( or not to refer ) .
materials and methods a qualitative study was conducted , guided by the principles of grounded theory .
the study design was informed by our ongoing research , as well as a model of access to health services .
data were collected through in - depth , semi - structured interviews with lung , breast , and / or colorectal cancer surgeons in nova scotia , canada ( n = 28 ) .
data were collected and analyzed concurrently , with two investigators coding and analyzing the data .
analysis involved an inductive , grounded approach using constant comparative analysis .
research team meetings were held to discuss preliminary findings and question the data and interpretations .
data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation was reached .
results seven factors were found to influence surgeon decisionmaking related to oncology referral , with the magnitude of influence differing depending on their decisional proximity .
at the core of surgeon decision - making is the clinical encounter wherein the decision is made .
within this encounter , surgeons consider and negotiate their understanding of ( 1 ) indications / contraindications for ( neo ) adjuvant therapy ( e.g. , tumor pathology , patient comorbidities / health status ) alongside ( 2 ) patient beliefs and preferences ( e.g. , the desire or not for chemotherapy ) .
surrounding the clinical encounter is a number of important mediating factors : ( 3 ) a belief that oncologists are the experts , ( 4 ) knowledge of local standards of care , and ( 5 ) consultation with oncology colleagues .
when making decisions about oncology referral , surgeons were also acutely aware of the outer context in which these decisions occur , including ( 6 ) system resources and capacity ( e.g. , access to staging investigations , technology to facilitate coordination of care ) and ( 7 ) a need to navigate patient logistics ( e.g. , drug coverage , transportation / lodging ) .
while factors within this outer context infrequently influence referral decisions in a direct way , they often make dealing with the decision more difficult .
conclusions the findings of this study contribute to our broader understanding of how surgeons make decisions about oncology referral and provide a basis to design contextually - appropriate strategies to narrow this gap in our province .

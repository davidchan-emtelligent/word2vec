however , the role of et in cold tolerance varies in different species .
this study revealed that low temperature promotes the release of et in grapevine .
the treatment of exogenous 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylate increased the cold tolerance of grapevine. by contrast , the application of the et biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine reduced the cold tolerance of grapevine .
this finding suggested that et positively affected cold stress responses in grapevine .
the expression of vaerf057 , an et signaling downstream gene , was strongly induced by low temperature .
the overexpression of vaerf057 also enhanced the cold tolerance of arabidopsis .
under cold treatment , malondialdehyde content was lower and superoxide dismutase , peroxidase , and catalase activities were higher in transgenic lines than in wild - type plants .
rna - seq results showed that 32 stress - related genes , such as cbf1 - 3 , were upregulated in vaerf057 - overexpressing transgenic line .
yeast one - hybrid results further demonstrated that vaerf057 specifically binds to gcc - box and dre motifs .
thus , vaerf057 may directly regulate the expression of its target stress - responsive genes by interacting with a gcc - box or a dre element .
our work confirmed that et positively regulates cold tolerance in grapevine by modulating the expression of vaerf057 .
ethylene ( et ) is a gaseous plant hormone that regulates many aspects of the plant life cycle , including seed germination , leaf senescence , fruit ripening , abscission , and biotic and abiotic stress responses123 .
et biosynthesis is mainly regulated by 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylate synthase ( acs ) and 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylate oxidase ( aco ) at transcriptional or post - translational levels45 .
in arabidopsis , et can be captured by a five - member endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) - localized receptor family , including ethylene response1 and 2 ( etr1 and etr2 ) , ethylene response sensor1 and 2 ( ers1 and ers2 ) , and ethylene insensitive4 ( ein4 ) .
these receptors remove the block of constitutive triple response1 ( ctr1 ) on ein2678 .
ein2 becomes released and then activates ein3 / ein3 - like1 , which positively regulates the expression of ethylene response factor ( erf ) transcription factors , such as erf191011 .
these erf transcription factors participate in developmental and stress - related signal pathways by regulating the expression of downstream genes12 .
low temperature is a primary environmental factor that limits plant growth and development , productivity , and geographical distribution13 .
plants must adjust to various physiological and biochemical processes in response to cold stress14 .
endogenous et levels altered under cold stress have been observed in many plant species .
however , the role of et in cold tolerance varies in different plant species , even in arabidopsis grown in different environments .
for instance , the cold tolerance of soil - grown arabidopsis seedlings treated with 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylate ( acc ) is enhanced15 but is reduced in vitro ; cold tolerance is increased when aminoethoxyvinylglycine ( avg ) is applied14 .
et positively affects the cold tolerance of tomato ( lycopersicon esculentum ) 16. by contrast , et levels are negatively correlated with the cold tolerance of medicago truncatula17 .
et also negatively influences the cold tolerance of tobacco ( nicotiana tabacum ) , whereas avg application enhances cold tolerance18 .
therefore , the role of et on cold tolerance is possibly species dependent19 .
as such , the function of et in different species under cold stress should be investigated to elucidate the diverse roles of the et signal transduction pathway in plants during cold stress .
erf transcription factors , which are located downstream of the et signal pathway , belong to the apetala2 / erf ( ap2 / erf ) family .
this family can be divided into ap2 , c - repeat binding factor / dehydration - responsive element binding factor ( cbf / dreb ) , erf , rav , and other subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and number of ap2 / erf domains20 .
the erf subfamily proteins contain single ap2 / erf domain and mainly participate in responses to biotic stresses , such as pathogenesis , by binding to the gcc - box present in the promoter of et - inducible pathogenesis - related ( pr ) genes2122 .
erf genes can recognize dehydration - responsive element ( dre ) and play an important role in abiotic stress responses23 .
the erf overexpression in arabidopsis , tobacco , and soybean plants positively regulates the expression of several pr genes ; as a result , the resistances to bacterial , fungal , or viral pathogens of these plants are enhanced242526 .
erf genes also respond to various abiotic stresses .
for instance , overexpression in the sense or antisense orientation of terf2 / erf2 can increase or decrease the freezing tolerance of tomato and tobacco , respectively18 .
the overexpression of gmerf7 enhances the salt tolerance of transgenic tobacco27 ; by contrast , the overexpression of oserf3 decreases the drought tolerance of rice28 .
although many erf genes have been identified in different species , the regulatory pathway of the abiotic stress response of the erf subfamily remains poorly understood .
grapevine ( vitis ) is a widely cultivated fruit crop worldwide .
low temperature is a crucial environmental factor that negatively affects grapevine productivity and quality .
to address this problem , researchers widely investigated the genetic mechanisms of cold acclimation in grapevine .
previous studies mainly focused on the cbf pathway in grapevine .
the overexpression of cbf genes , including cbf1 - 4 of grapevines , induces the expression of downstream genes and thus increases the freezing tolerance of transgenic arabidopsis or tobacco plants293031 .
cbf genes belong to the cbf / dreb subfamily of the ap2 / erf family .
the ap2 / erf family in grapevine has been subjected to genomic and transcriptomic analyses , and 149 members , including 122 erf transcription factors , have been identified32 .
three erf members , namely , vperf1 , vperf2 , and vperf3 from v. pseudoreticulata , are involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses30 .
xin et al.33 performed a transcriptomic analysis and identified 16 ap2 / erf transcription factors that respond to low temperature in grapevine .
however , the function of et and its downstream erf genes under low temperature remains unclear .
this study aimed to obtain insights into the function of et in the cold tolerance of grapevine .
a cold - hardy species ( v. amurensis ) and a freezing - sensitive cultivar ( v. vinifera ' muscat hamburg ') were used to investigate the differences in the et - related signaling pathway of these two species .
et production under cold treatment was determined in these two grapevine species .
the effects of exogenous et addition and endogenous et synthesis inhibition on the cold tolerance of grapevine were also evaluated .
the function of vaerf057 , which belongs to the erf transcription family and is strongly induced by cold stress and exogenous et , was analyzed in transgenic arabidopsis .
rna - seq was performed with vaerf057 - overexpressing arabidopsis transgenic lines to determine the putative downstream genes regulated by vaerf057 .
on the basis of our results , we proposed a comprehensive model of et - dependent signal transduction in grapevine under cold stress .
results low temperature increased et production in grapevine the function of et in cold tolerance varies in different plant species .
et biosynthesis increases or decreases under cold stress depending on the plant species15163435 .
to investigate et production under cold stress in grapevine , we first determined et biosynthesis in v. amurensis and ' muscat hamburg ' plantlets that were subjected to low temperature ( 4 degreesc ) .
a similar evolution of et production was observed in both species throughout the treatment with low temperature ( fig. 1a ) .
et production rapidly increased after initiating the cold stress , reached the maximum at 8 h , and then decreased to the original level at 48 h ( fig. 1a ) .
however , the maximum changes in the two grape species were slightly different ( 1.7 - fold in v. amurensis and 2 - fold in ' muscat hamburg ') .
these results indicated that et biosynthesis in grapevine was remarkably enhanced at the early period of cold stress .
acc is a direct product of acs and its content can be used as an indicator of acs activity .
acc content in the two grape species rapidly increased , reached the maximum at 8 h after initiating the cold stress , and then decreased ( fig. 1b ) .
the greatest change in acc content was up to 4.3 - fold in v. amurensis and up to 2.6 - fold in ' muscat hamburg ' .
similar to the changes in acc content , aco activity under cold stress first increased and then decreased ( fig. 1c ) .
moreover , the fold changes in aco activity were greater in v. amurensis than in ' muscat hamburg ' .
aco is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of the et biosynthetic pathway by converting acc into et. the results of the evolution of both acc content and aco activity strongly support the increase in et production in grapevines during the early stage of cold stress .
application of acc and avg respectively enhanced and reduced the cold tolerance of grapevine to establish the relationship between et production and cold tolerance , we measured the semi - lethal temperature ( lt50 ) of grapevine leaves treated with et precursor ( acc ) and acs inhibitor ( avg ) .
application of exogenous acc reduced lt50 value from - 9.2 degreesc to - 11.3 degreesc in v. amurensis and from - 7.3 degreesc to - 10.2 degreesc in ' muscat hamburg ' ( fig. 2 ) .
the application of avg ( 100 mum ) under cold stress largely inhibited acc biosynthesis and aco activity in grapevine ( fig. 1b,c ) , indicating that avg can inhibit et production in grapevine under low temperature. by contrast , application of exogenous avg increased lt50 values to - 8.1 degreesc in v. amurensis and - 5.7 degreesc in ' muscat hamburg ' ( fig. 2 ) .
previous results indicated that an increased et production resulting from exogenous application of et precursor enhances cold resistance , whereas a reduced cold tolerance was expected from suppression of et production both in v. amurensis and ' muscat hamburg ' .
isolation and characterization of vaerf057 and vverf057 the erf transcription factors found downstream of the et signal pathway play an important role in response to abiotic stresses , including salt , drought , and cold stresses1836 .
our previous study revealed that erf057 is significantly upregulated under cold stress33 .
we isolated the vaerf057 and vverf057 genes from v. amurensis and ' muscat hamburg ' , respectively .
the putative protein sequences of vaerf057 and vverf057 showed 97.5 % identity with proteins containing the same ap2 / erf domain ( fig. s1 ) .
analysis of the conserved ap2 / erf domain of 59 amino acids showed that the ap2 / erf domain shares over 90 % identity with its homologs from different plant species ( fig. 3a ) .
based on the conventional classification37 , the ap2 / erf domain is divided into two conserved segments ( yrg and rayd ) , and the protein formed contains three beta - sheets and a single alpha - helix ( fig. 3a ) .
phylogenetic analysis further revealed the evolutionary relationship to the erfs of arabidopsis , suggesting that vaerf057 and vverf057 belong to group vii of the erf family ( fig. 3b ) .
given that no significant differences exist between vaerf057 and vverf057 , the functional studies described below mainly focused on vaerf057 .
increased expression levels of vaerf057 and vverf057 were dependent on enhanced et production under cold stress the expression patterns of vaerf057 and vverf057 in response to cold , acc and avg were analyzed by quantitative real time rt - pcr ( qrt - pcr ) .
transcript levels of vaerf057 and vverf057 rapidly increased after initiating cold stress and peaked at 12 h ( 6.2 - fold ) and 48 h ( 12.8 - fold ) , respectively ( fig. 4a ) .
expression of vaerf057 and vverf057 also rapidly increased in the plants after acc application ( fig. 4b ) .
the expression of vaerf057 increased by 8.2 - fold at 2 h and vverf057 increased by 15.3 - fold at 4 h. the effects of cold stress on the expression of vaerf057 and vverf057 were totally inhibited when the plants were subjected with avg under cold condition ( fig. 4a,c ) .
these results suggested that the response of vaerf057 and vverf057 possibly relies on the increased et release during cold stress .
overexpression of vaerf057 enhanced cold tolerance of transgenic arabidopsis by reducing malondialdehyde ( mda ) content and by increasing superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , peroxidase ( pod ) , and catalase ( cat ) activities to further investigate the possible role of vaerf057 in abiotic stress responses , we generated 10 t3 homozygous transgenic arabidopsis lines , which were confirmed by genomic dna pcr and qrt - pcr ( data not shown ) .
three representative transgenic lines ( oe1 , oe2 , and oe3 ) displaying high vaerf057 expression levels were used in subsequent experiments .
vaerf057 - overexpressing arabidopsis plants displayed significantly improved cold tolerance ( fig. 5a ) .
the average survival rate of the vaerf057 - overexpressing plants was over 85 % after cold stress at - 11 degreesc , whereas that of the wild - type ( wt ) and empty vector ( ev ) plants demonstrated only 21.4 % and 23.8 % survival rate , respectively ( fig. 5b ) .
to further investigate the physiological changes under cold treatment in the vaerf057 - overexpressing arabidopsis , we determined the four important physiological indexes , namely , mda , sod , pod , and cat , which reflect plant cold tolerance .
no significant differences were observed among transgenic lines and the controls ( wt and ev ) under normal conditions ( fig. 6 ) .
however , under cold stress , mda content was significantly lower in transgenic plants than in wt and ev plants ( fig. 6a ) , whereas sod , pod , and cat activities were significantly increased in the transgenic plants compared with that in the wt and ev plants ( fig. 6b - d ) .
these results suggested that the tissues of the vaerf057 - overexpressing plants were less injured as reflected in their low mda index , and this phenomenon should increase sod , pod , and cat activities to improve tolerance of arabidopsis to cold stress .
transcriptome analysis of the vaerf057 - overexpressing arabidopsis revealed altered expression of genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses to determine the possible direct or indirect targets of vaerf057 , we performed whole transcriptome sequencing ( rna - seq ) of two biological replicates of wt and three transgenic arabidopsis lines mixture ( oe1 , oe2 , and oe3 ) under normal conditions .
a total of 140 significantly differentially expressed genes demonstrating changes of more than 2 - fold were found in the transgenic lines compared with the wt plants .
among these altered genes , 89 were upregulated and 51 were downregulated ( table s2 ) .
to confirm the rna - seq results , we verified the 23 significantly differentially expressed genes , including 16 upregulated and 7 downregulated genes by using qrt - pcr ( fig. s3 ) .
all of these verified genes showed similar changes in expression as revealed by rna - seq and qrt - pcr , indicating the reliability of the transcription profile analysis .
to gain insight into the functions of these genes , we performed gene ontology ( go ) term enrichment analysis by using agrigo v1.2 in default parameters38 .
the most significantly enriched biological processes among these significantly differentially expressed genes in transgenic arabidopsis are involved in responding to stimuli ( including biotic and abiotic stimuli , cold , heat , water deprivation , hypoxia , wounding , pathogen , and osmotic and oxidative stresses ) , metabolic processes , biological regulation , and signal transduction ( fig. s2 ) .
among the significantly differentially expressed genes , 39 genes are involved in cold , drought , salt , hypoxia , and pathogen stresses ; 32 of these genes were upregulated and 7 were downregulated ( table 1 ) .
many key genes involved in these stress tolerances were identified .
for instance , cbf1 , cbf2 , and cbf3 , which encode a small family of transcriptional activators that play an important role in freezing tolerance and cold acclimation in arabidopsis3940 , were upregulated by 3.9 - , 2.4 - , and 4.5 - fold , respectively .
nced3 ( upregulated by 2.7 - fold ) is a key gene in the aba biosynthesis pathway and enhances plant tolerance to abiotic stresses by regulating endogenous aba biosynthesis4142 .
these results showed that vaerf057 overexpression can regulate expression of many genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress response .
the enhanced cold tolerance of the vaerf057 - overexpressing arabidopsis suggested that vaerf057 directly or indirectly regulates expression of these stress - responsive genes .
vaerf057 demonstrated binding activity to gcc - box and dre motifs previous studies have shown that some erf proteins can bind to gcc - box or dre motif242543 .
especially , aterf71 / hre2 , the closest homologue of vaerf057 in arabidopsis , can bind to both gcc - box and dre motifs43 .
to determine whether vaerf057 can also bind to gcc - box and dre motifs , we cloned four tandem copies of gcc - box , dre , or their mutants into pabai vector , which was interacted with the pgadt7 activation domain vector harboring vaerf057 by using y1h system .
figure 7 shows that vaerf057 can specifically bind to both gcc - box and dre motifs but failed to bind to all of the mutated gcc - box and dre motifs .
among the 140 significantly differentially expressed genes , 24 genes contain gcc - box and 54 genes contain at least one dre core motif upstream of their 1 kb promoter region ( table s2 ) .
these results suggested that vaerf057 regulates the expression of target genes by binding to gcc - box and dre motifs in their promoter regions .
discussion this study explored the function of et and the roles of its downstream gene vaerf057 in grapevine during cold stress .
our results demonstrated that cold stress enhanced the production of et and the expression of et signal pathway downstream genes , such as vaerf057 and vverf057 , in grapevine .
enhanced et synthesis is essential in cold tolerance both in cold - hardy ( v. amurensis ) or cold - sensitive ( v. vinifera ' muscat hamburg ') grapevine .
our findings are consistent with previous results15161835 wherein an increase of et level positively regulates the cold tolerance of grapevine .
in addition , et biosynthesis is required for the accumulation of antifreeze proteins in winter rye ( secale cereale ) during cold acclimation44 .
et has also been proposed to protect mitochondrial activity in arabidopsis under cold stress45 .
however , an opposite conclusion was reached in other studies on several plant species , including arabidopsis14 , m .
truncatula17 , winter wheat ( triticum aestivum ) 34 , and dwarf bean ( phaseolus vulgaris ) 46 .
especially in arabidopsis , catala et al.15 reported that et production increases under cold treatment and that et positively regulates cold tolerance , whereas shi et al.14 obtained the opposite results .
these different results can be largely caused by the different growth conditions employed in these studies .
catala et al.15 used soil - grown plants , whereas shi et al.14 used seedlings grown on murashige and skoog ( ms ) medium in petri dishes , implying a growth condition of high relative humidity .
indeed , et production is inhibited in response to cold stress under high relative humidity4748 .
in our research , the grapevine plantlets were grown on half - strength ms medium in a conical flask covered with a sealing film that allows good aeration .
the relative humidity in our study was higher than the relative humidity the soil - grown plants were exposed to but lower than that to which the plants grown on ms medium in petri dishes were exposed .
therefore , a critical value of relative humidity possibly inhibits et production under cold stress .
the function of et in cold stress in different species exposed to different conditions still requires further investigation .
erf transcription factors , which are located downstream of the et signal pathway , were reported to respond to various biotic and abiotic stresses in several species .
in arabidopsis , aterf1 - 5 genes were differentially regulated by et and by abiotic stresses , such as cold , drought , wounding , high salinity , or pathogen .
aterf1 , aterf2 , and aterf5 function as activators , whereas aterf3 and aterf4 act as repressors by downregulating not only the basal transcription levels of a reporter gene but also the transactivation activity of other transcription factors4950 .
many other erfs were identified as stress - responsive through detection of their expression under various stress conditions , although functional studies on erf genes remain limited .
transcript analysis in ' cabernet sauvignon ' grapevines revealed 13 et - responsive transcripts upregulated and 7 downregulated after cold treatment , whereas erf057 was n't included51 .
this study isolated the group vii erf genes ( vaerf057 and vverf057 ) from grapevine , and these genes can be induced by cold stress and exogenous et. avg can also totally inhibit the inductive effect of cold stress on the expression of these genes .
low temperature promoted the release of et , and the et increased the expression of vaerf057 and vverf057 .
therefore , the enhanced expression of vaerf057 under cold stress was possibly directly induced by et , the release of which was promoted by low temperature ( fig. 8 ) .
as transcription factors , the ap2 / erfs play important roles in stress response by regulating the expression of downstream stress - related genes .
for instance , overexpression of cbf genes in plants enhances cold tolerance by regulating the expression of cold - responsive genes525354 .
terf2 / erf2 overexpression can also increase cold tolerance in rice , tomato , and tobacco by activating expression of cold - related genes1855 .
in the present study , vaerf057 overexpression enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis .
these physiological adjustments confer cold tolerance to the transgenic arabidopsis .
moreover , rna - seq analysis showed that vaerf057 overexpression in arabidopsis regulated the expression of the cold - induced regulatory genes , including atcbf1 - 3 , wrky33 , wrky70 , nced3 , and erf5 under normal condition .
an increasing number of evidence indicates that erf transcription factors play critical regulatory roles in response to stress by interacting with gcc - box or dre motif to activate expression of targeted stress - responsive genes245657 .
aterf71 / hre2 is the closest homologue of vaerf057 in arabidopsis .
binding of aterf71 / hre2 to gcc - box and dre motifs was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) , fluorescence measurement and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy ( biacore ) experiments43 .
in this study , we provided evidence that vaerf057 can bind to both gcc - box and dre motifs by y1h system .
our results indicate that vaerf057 in arabidopsis possibly directly upregulates expression of its targeted genes by interacting with these cis - elements .
the accumulated expression of vaerf057 and vverf057 was also found in other stress conditions , such as drought and high salinity ( data not shown ) .
further studies should be conducted to overexpress or to knock down vaerf057 and vverf057 in grapevine and thus elucidate their functions in stress response .
in summary , low temperature can promote the release of et and endogenous et can enhance the cold tolerance of grapevine .
we isolated a group vii stress - responsive erf gene ( vaerf057 ) , which is located downstream of the et signal pathway and is implicated as a positive regulator of cold tolerance .
vaerf057 overexpression enhanced the cold tolerance of arabidopsis .
this finding indicated that vaerf057 , when induced by et , may function as a key regulator that improves the cold tolerance of grapevine .
vaerf057 may directly upregulate the expression of its target stress - responsive genes by interacting with gcc - box or dre / crt element in grapevine .
on the basis of our results , we proposed a comprehensive model of et - dependent signal transduction in grapevine under cold stress ( fig. 8 ) .
further studies should be performed to determine other components related to vaerf057 and to gain a clear - cut silhouette of the major hub in the network .
methods plant materials and treatments micropropagated v. amurensis and v. vinifera ' muscat hamburg ' plantlets were grown on half - strength murashige and skoog ( 1 / 2 ms , ph 5.8 ) solid medium containing 30 g l - 1 of sucrose and 0.7 % agar in conical flasks ( 120 ml ) in a growth chamber at 26 degreesc ( fig. s3 ) .

the gas samples were subsequently injected into a gas chromatograph ( agilent 7890a ) equipped with an hp - 5 column and a flame ionization detector .
the detector and injector were operated at 180 degreesc and 120 degreesc , respectively , whereas the oven temperature was set at 110 degreesc .

in the treatment of diabetes , first behavioral methods are used , then oral anti - diabetic drugs , then , in the course of the disease progress , a combined therapy ( non - insulin plus insulin ) and finally , solely insulin therapy .
unfortunately , many patients are afraid of including insulin for the treatment. by delaying the proper therapy , patients expose themselves to the increased risk of complications due to the macro - and microvascular pathologies .
the prevention , prediction and minimalizing of the short - and long - term complications is a main focus of health care and it is at the front of the activities of many local and global organizations ( see e.g. [ 1,2 ]) .
scientific background our two years long study ( 2011 - 2012 ) on the quality of life of the out clinic patients in wroclaw suffered from the diabetes type 2 , revealed the following : 1 quality of life was highest in patients treated with oral anti - diabetic drugs and the lowest in patients treated with insulin , only , and 2 .
general physical health of patients was worse than the general mental health .
moreover , we stated that the patients are more prone to develop depression than the general population .
besides of treatment method , within the factors that influence the quality of life , we found : age , disease duration , gender , obesity and presence of other diseases , including diabetes complications .
one of the frustrating for patient complication , problematic in the treatment , is development of the diabetes foot , which is very often leading to the amputation , which in turn , shorten the patients' life .
therefore , remote monitoring of the feet condition may allow for due to time medical intervention .
outlook and expert recommendations prevention of the complication as diabetic food may be possible by assessing the conditions for the pathology development .
we expect that the local temperature distribution , as well as podobarographic data differ in healthy population and diabetes patients .
multi - institutional clinical study will help to gather enough data which may be exploited for finding the predictive factors of diabetic foot development .
in patients already suffering from this complication , it could be possible to react promptly in order to prevent amputation .
such an approach will allow treating patients individually , simultaneously in the most economic way .

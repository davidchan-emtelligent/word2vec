issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction over the last decade , with a mature cmos - compatible top - down technique , silicon photonics has been proved to be very promising for supercomputing and data - communications1 - 6 .
it features a variety of advantages including large - scale manufacturability , high reproducibility , and high integration density .
similar to the advancement of integrated electronics with the feature width of interconnect decreasing down to sub - 10 - nm level driven by moore 's law7 , 8 , size miniaturization of integrated photonics also develops rapidly for higher operation speed , less power consumption , and so on9 - 11 .
however , compared to electric current in a metal wire with relatively low frequency , optical frequency signals in a waveguide are much more sensitive to the surface roughness , leading to roughness - induced optical loss in top - down fabrication structures12 .
for example , with rms surface roughness down to 0.1 - nm level13 , a subwavelength - diameter silica nanofiber can guide light with propagation losses well below 0.005 db cm - 1 14 , 15 , which is far beyond the reach of up - to - date fabrication techniques for silicon nanowaveguides ( e.g. , 0.4 db cm - 1 for strip waveguides16 and 0.3 db cm - 1 for ridge waveguides17 ) .
on the other hand , around the same time , relying on a bottom - up approach such as vapor - liquid - solid growth , the chemical and material communities have grown a variety of free - standing nanowires ( fnws ) for electron and photon transportation18 - 23 .
these highly uniform one - dimensional nanostructures , with diameters of a few to hundreds of nanometers , show surface roughness down to atomic level ( i.e. , the same order of the silica nanofiber ) , offering an opportunity for deep - subwavelength optical waveguiding with low optical loss24 , 25 .
moreover , benefiting from the bottom - up process that synthesizes nanowires from atomic - size nucleation sites , the nanoscale transverse cross sections of fnws allow large lattice mismatch in single - crystalline structures26 - 28 , which offers much greater material diversity for active and nonlinear applications compared with the traditional top - down technique29 - 34 .
in order to merge the advantages of the bottom - up and the top - down techniques , previously there have been some successful studies on integrating fnws with on - chip waveguides35 - 37 .
the big challenge is to assemble fnws into functional photonic circuits with low coupling loss and high precision .
in previous papers , the coupling efficiency is usually low ( e.g. , below 5 % 34 , 36 ) due to the mismatch of mode overlapping and photon momentum .
here we report flexible integration of fnws and silicon photonics merging their advantages together via an elaborate near - field coupling structure .
in our layout design , the as - fabricated on - chip waveguides provide precise positioning for the fnw assembling .
as a result , the coupling efficiency between a fnw and a silicon waveguide ( sw ) can be up to ~ 97 % in the wavelength range from 1,535 to 1,620 nm , corresponding to a minimum loss of ~ 0.14 db. hybrid photonic integrated circuits such as mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) and racetrack resonators are fabricated with nonlinear or active fnws .
especially , using 405 nm switch pulses with a low peak power of 250 muw to pump on the cds fnw arm of a hybrid mzi , we switch out signal pulses at 1.5 mum with a modulation depth ( defined by the differential transmission deltat / t ) of 100 % , which is four times larger than that case when the sw arm is pumped .
besides , waveguided luminescence at telecommunication band is also realized by integrating active tellurite glass fnws with silicon racetrack resonators .
results optical near - field coupling between fnws and sws the integration of a fnw into a typical silicon photonic circuit is illustrated schematically in fig. 1a , where a fnw is used to bridge the two sws via side - by - side near - field optical coupling .
on - chip sws were fabricated with a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) wafer by the processes of e - beam lithography and subsequent dry - etching ( see methods section ) .
an as - grown cds fnw ( supplementary note 1 ) was first transferred onto the silicon chip via micromanipulation , and then pushed to make close contacts with the two sws at the ends by using a tapered fiber probe under an optical microscope ( fig. 1b and c , also see supplementary note 2 ) .
to achieve an efficient coupling , the diameter of the fnw was chosen to have phase - matching with the sw38 ( supplementary note 3 ) while the length of the coupling region was determined automatically by the layout of the sw ( which consists of a straight section and an s - bend ) , as shown in fig. 1b .
such a quasi - self - aligned assembling process is very helpful and robust for achieving the efficient coupling .
for optical characterization , a broadband light at telecommunication band was coupled into / out from the chip via grating couplers. by measuring the transmissions of sw pairs ( 340 - nm height , different widths ) bridged by an identical 860 - nm - diameter cds fnw ( supplementary note 5 ) , we obtained the coupling efficiencies between the fnw and sws with different core widths ( fig. 1d ) .
within the measured spectral range of 1,535 - 1,620 nm , the coupling efficiency of the fnw with a 300 - nm - width waveguide is averagely very high , with a maximum value of about 97 % around 1,585 nm after calibrating the propagation losses of the fnw and the sw ( supplementary note 5 ) .
a small deviation to this optimal width ( e.g. , +/ - 20 nm ) leads to notable wavelength - dependent efficiency , which is mainly due to the phase mismatches in these cases ( supplementary notes 3 and 4 ). fig. 1 integration of a fnw into a silicon chip using side - by - side near - field optical coupling .

the coupling lengths are about 2.5 mum integrated fnw - sw mzi for all - optical modulation the high - efficiency fnw - waveguide coupling scheme can be readily exploited to construct on - chip functional photonic devices .
figure 2a gives an sem image of a hybrid mzi integrated with a cds fnw connected with a u - shaped sw. measured transmission spectrum ( fig. 2b ) shows evident interference fringes with extinction ratios up to 20 db. the measured free spectral range ( fsr ) is about 3.1 nm around 1,598 nm , which agrees well with the calculated value of 3.0 nm. small ripples in the spectrum are mainly owing to back reflection - induced fabry - perot resonance39 .
to generate free carriers for refractive index modulation similar to silicon optical modulators9 , here we illuminated chopped 405 - nm - wavelength ( 3.06 ev , larger than the bandgaps of cds and silicon ) pulses ( repetition rate ~ 67 hz , pulse duration ~ 0.75 ms , and peak power ~ 250 muw ) onto the cds fnw with a spot size of about 6 mum2 ( area a in fig. 2c ) , and measured the transmission response of a 1.5 - mum cw signal light propagating along the mzi circuit ( fig. 2c , see also supplementary note 6 ) .
as shown in fig. 2d , the signal light ( red line ) was modulated clearly by the switch light ( blue line ) , suggesting a potential application of all - optical modulation40 .
the modulation depth was about 100 % .
for reference , when the sw ( area b in fig. 2c ) was illuminated by the switch light under the same condition , the modulation was about four times weaker ( black line ) .
the results show that , compared with sw , cds fnw presented higher carrier - induced optical nonlinearity , and thus offered higher modulation depth in the integrated circuit .
it is worth to note that , benefiting from the material diversity41 , there are many other fnws ( e.g. , knbo3 29 ) can be used for various nonlinear photonic applications. fig. 2 integrated fnw - sw mzi for all - optical modulation .

d modulated outputs from the mzi with 405 - nm - wavelength switch pulses integrated fnw - sw resonator using a vertical coupling scheme besides the side - by - side coupling scheme ( fig. 1a ) , we also bridge two sws by placing a fnw in vertical contact , as illustrated in fig. 3a .
the measured coupling efficiency between a 770 - nm - diameter cds fnw and a 320 - nm - width sw can go up to 87 % around 1575 nm ( fig. 3b ) .
using this vertical coupling approach , we constructed a hybrid resonator by bridging the gap of a racetrack waveguide with a 730 - nm - diameter cds fnw ( fig. 3c ) .
figure 3d gives the resonance spectrum of the fabricated hybrid resonator with extinction ratios up to 16 db and quality factors of ~ 1,400 .
the measured fsr of 2.7 nm agrees well with the calculated value of 2.6 nm. by illuminating the cds fnw with a 405 - nm switch light , evident modulated output is clearly observed ( fig. 3e ). fig. 3 integration of a fnw into a silicon chip using a vertical coupling scheme .

e modulated signal output by all - optical modulation when the fnw is excited by 405 - nm switch pulses integrated fnw - sw resonators for on - chip light generation in additional to the nonlinear fnws , we can also integrate rare - earth - doped fnws with silicon photonics for on - chip light generation .
for example , by vertically coupling an er3 +/ yb3 + - codoped tellurite glass fnw to a silicon racetrack resonator ( fig. 4a ) , and exciting the fnw by a 976 - nm cw laser ( fig. 4b ) , we obtained spectrum - sliced photoluminescence42 , 43 around the telecommunication band at the drop waveguide ( fig. 4c ) .
tellurite glass fnws were directly drawn from doped bulk glasses as described in a previous study44 .
green light observed on the excited fnw is attributed to the up - conversion luminescence of er3 + ions45 .
the modal spacing of 4.0 nm around 1,540 nm agrees well with the calculated value of 3.9 nm. the spacing is determined by the perimeters of resonators .
for example , we obtained a modal spacing of 10.8 nm by using a 50 - mum - perimeter ring resonator ( fig. 4e ). fig. 4 integrated fnw - sw - resonators for on - chip light generation .
the active fnws used here are er3 +/ yb3 + - codoped tellurite glass nanofibers .

scale bar , 20 mum discussion in conclusion , by elaborately defining the structural geometry for both strong near - field coupling and precise positioning , we demonstrated a simple and flexible approach to integrate fnws into sws with a coupling efficiency up to ~ 97 % .
the versatility of this approach is experimentally verified by device applications including all - optical modulation and light generation on silicon .
benefitting from the material diversity of fnws and high reproducibility of the mature top - down fabrication techniques , a variety of novel multifunctional nanophotonic circuits can be expected .
for example , by adding metallic46 - 49 or organic fnws50 - 52 , it is also possible to integrate nanoplasmonics or nanobiology into silicon photonics for diverse opportunities .
the sw - assisted micromanipulation we used here is a direct and precise approach to rapid device prototyping and proof - of - concept demonstration .
although at the moment it is still challenging for massive production , our work demonstrated here may open an alternative route to on - chip hybrid integration with high flexibility .
moreover , compared with previous reports on nanophotonic devices assembled with individual nanowires , the reproducibility of the hybrid photonic circuits has been improved largely by the pre - determined coupling length design ( supplementary note 7 ) .
also , in recent years , rapid progress has been made on deterministic or large - scale nanowire assembly53 - 56 , which may offer more possibilities to improve the hybrid fnw - sw integration to a scalable technique .
eventually , the flexible integration of nanostructures fabricated by top - down and bottom - up techniques may add a practical pathway to circumventing bottlenecks and continuing the success of both techniques , as well as suggesting a new route to future on - chip nanophotonics .
methods fabrication of silicon photonic circuits the silicon photonic circuits were fabricated on an soi wafer with a 340 - nm - thick top silicon layer and a 2 - mum - thick buried oxide layer .
after spin - coating photoresist on the wafer , we used an e - beam lithography process to define silicon - waveguide patterns on the photoresist .
then an inductively coupled plasmon dry - etching process was conducted to fully etch the top silicon layer down to the buried oxide layer with the photoresist mask .
for assembling fnws on the silicon photonic chip with direct contacts , the sws are air - cladded .
synthesis of cds fnws cds fnws were grown by evaporating cds powder at 800 degreesc with a high - purity argon flow ( 150 s.c.c.m. ) in a quartz tube furnace .
small silicon substrates coated with au film were put downstream of the cds powder to collect the deposited fnws .
after 1.5 h of growth , the tube was cooled down to room temperature and the silicon substrates with as - grown fnws were taken out for experiments .
scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used for fnw morphology characterization .
optical characterization of integrated fnw - sw circuits we used an amplified spontaneous emission source for broadband optical characterization of the integrated fnw - sw circuits .
two single - mode fibers ( corning smf - 28 ) mounted at an angle of 10degrees were employed to realize input and output coupling with grating couplers of sws ( fig. 1c ) .
the grating couplers were designed for te - polarized light with a period of 610 nm and a duty cycle of 50 % .
output signals were sent to an optical spectrum analyzer .
optical modulation with integrated fnw - sw circuits the signal light from a cw 1574.8 - nm - wavelength laser was sent into the integrated fnw - sw devices via input gratings .
a 405 - nm - wavelength cw laser was mechanically chopped to generate switch pulses , which were coupled into a tapered fiber probe to illuminate the target areas of the circuits for optical modulation ( supplementary note 6 ) .
modulated output was collected by a photodetector and measured by an oscilloscope .

high - throughput rna sequencing enables quantification of transcripts ( both known and novel ) , exon / exon junctions and fusions of exons from different genes .
discovery of gene fusions - particularly those expressed with low abundance - is a challenge with short - and medium - length sequencing reads .
to address this challenge , we implemented an rna - seq mapping pipeline within the lifescope software .
we introduced new features including filter and junction mapping , annotation - aided pairing rescue and accurate mapping quality values .
we combined this pipeline with a suffix array spliced read ( sasr ) aligner to detect chimeric transcripts .
performing paired - end rna - seq of the breast cancer cell line mcf - 7 using the solid system , we called 40 gene fusions among over 120,000 splicing junctions .
we validated 36 of these 40 fusions with taqman assays , of which 25 were expressed in mcf - 7 but not the human brain reference .
an intra - chromosomal gene fusion involving the estrogen receptor alpha gene esr1 , and another involving the rps6kb1 ( ribosomal protein s6 kinase beta - 1 ) were recurrently expressed in a number of breast tumor cell lines and a clinical tumor sample .
author summary advances in sequencing technology are enabling detailed characterization of rna transcripts from biological samples .
the fundamental challenge of accurately mapping the reads on transcripts and gleaning biological meaning from the data remains .
one class of transcripts , gene fusions , is particularly important in cancer .
some gene fusions are prominent markers in leukemia , prostate , and other cancers and putatively causative in certain tumor types .
we present a set of new rna - seq analysis techniques to map reads , and count expression of genes , exons and splicing junctions , especially those that give evidence of gene fusions .
these tools are available in a software package with a straightforward graphical user interface .
using this software , we called and validated several gene fusions in a breast cancer cell line. by testing the presence of these fusions in a larger population of tumor cell lines and clinical samples , we found that two of them were expressed recurrently .
introduction the transcriptome comprises the set of all transcripts in a cell and their quantity at a specific stage and time .
rna - seq enables hypothesis - neutral investigation of the expression of the transcripts including non - coding rna and viruses [ 1 ] .
rna - seq provides advantages over microarray technology such as the detection of novel transcripts ( both truly novel as well as those arising from alternative splicing ) and sensitivity over a greater range of expression [ 2 ] .
methods to more comprehensively analyze rna sequencing data are being developed , with particular focus on normalization of differential gene expression , annotation of the transcriptome , and characterization of the splicing junctions [ 3 ] - [ 12 ] .
paired - end rna - seq further enhances quantification of alternative transcripts [ 13 ] - [ 16 ] .
analysis of tissue and single - cell - specific rna is revealing cellular gene expression diversity and phenotypy [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
gene fusions arise from mutations including translocations , deletions , inversions , or trans - splicing .
fusion genes are thought to cause tumorigenesis by over - activating proto - oncogenes , deactivating tumor suppressors , or altering the regulation and / or splicing of other genes which lead to defects in key signaling pathways [ 20 ] .
fused rnas are found to occur in significantly higher frequency in cancer than in matched benign samples and may be potential biomarkers [ 21 ] .
for example , 95 % of patients with clinical chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) express the bcr - abl gene fusion in their leukemia cells due to a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
bcr - abl is also found to be a factor in 30 % to 50 % of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases [ 24 ] .
imatinib is a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting bcr - abl and is an effective treatment for cml [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
gene fusions are also detected repeatedly in other tumors .
examples include etv6 - ntrk3 in mesoblastic nephroma , congenital fibrosarcoma , and breast carcinoma [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] .
myb - nfib in head and neck tumors [ 30 ] , tmprss2 - erg / ets in prostate cancer [ 31 ] - [ 34 ] , and eml4 - alk in lung cancer [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] .
most lung tumors with alk rearrangements are shown to shrink and stabilize when patients are given the alk inhibitor crizotinib [ 36 ] .
hypothesis - neutral gene fusion detection with rna - seq was recently demonstrated by different groups [ 37 ] - [ 46 ] .
for example , the fusionseq software uses paired - end reads to find candidate fusions , and applies a set of filtration modules to remove false positive candidates [ 41 ] .
fusionseq applies misalignment filters for large - and small - scale homology , low complexity repetitive regions , and mitochondrial genes particularly considering reads that fall on snp regions or on rna edited transcripts that may cause misalignments .
defuse guides a dynamic programming based spliced read detection module with paired - end alignments [ 42 ] .
both of these methods reply upon paired - end alignments as the initial evidence and apply spliced read mapping on the candidate regions .
peralign relies upon mapping spliced reads to the whole genome first and then guiding them with paired - end alignments [ 38 ] .
in this study , we describe a new method which considers spliced - read and paired - end alignments independently from each other , enabling detection of fusions from single fragment or paired - end experiments .
we also introduce techniques for mapping of spliced - reads to a suffix array based virtual gene fusion reference with annotation - aided pairing rescue and methods for quality assessment of alignments and splice junctions .
we tested our analysis tool by calling the exon / exon junctions and gene fusions from data generated by sequencing three paired - end rna - seq libraries , each with two technical replicates .
we also compared our results to tophat and fusionseq software on the mcf - 7 sample .
next we validated candidate mcf - 7 gene fusions using taqman ( r ) assays and showed that 90 % of the calls were valid and over 65 % were specific to mcf - 7 .
we also identified what appears to be an early breakpoint bias at the 5 ' fused genes .
finally , we surveyed a subset of mcf - 7 and uhr fusions on a panel of breast cancer cell lines and discovered evidence for recurrence .
results a combined strategy to detect splice junctions and fusion breakpoints we prepared strand - specific , paired - end rna libraries from the universal human reference ( uhr ) , the human brain reference ( hbr ) , and the breast cancer cell line mcf - 7 using the total rna - seq kit from applied biosystems .
these rna libraries were sequenced using ligation - based high throughput solid ( tm ) system [ 47 ] .
fragments were gel - selected for insert sizes between 100 - 200 base pairs ( figure s1 in text s1 ) .
using a new transcriptome alignment pipeline in which each pair of reads is mapped to genome , junction , exon and filter references and paired with a pairing quality value ( pqv ) , we obtained total of 580 million read pairs that were confidently mapped to the human genome ( table s1 in text s2 ) .
histograms of gene expression showed a wide range of distribution , and average r2 correlation of gene expression between replicates ranged from 0.95 to 0.96 ( figures s2 , s3 in text s1 ) .
splice junctions were discovered by combining three approaches : ( 1 ) bridge evidence found by paired - end reads in which the forward read maps on an exon and the reverse read maps on another exon with a pqv above a confidence threshold ; ( 2 ) span evidence found by single reads ( of paired - end reads ) in which the read alignment spans the breakpoint of a set of known and putative splice junctions ; ( 3 ) fusion span evidence found by fusion alignments spanning hypothetical breakpoints of any two exons discovered using the sasr aligner which assesses all exon - exon combinations in the genome ( figure 1 ) .
using this strategy , for each sample , we identified an average of 133,000 refseq and 15,315 non - refseq ( putative ) splice junctions and 5 to 56 candidate fusion breakpoints ( table 1 and table s1 in text s2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1002464.g001 figure 1 rna - seq mapping and splice junction detection methodology. a. four reads that span ( spliced single reads ) , and three reads that bridge ( paired - end reads ) the junction are shown .
the top chart shows a bird 's eye view of the genomic alignments detected for seven pairs of reads between the two exons .
areas of the read highlighted in red correspond to colors that do not align to a genomic reference , and dots in the reference are unknown colors / bases. b. mapping pipeline is reviewed in the methods sections .
candidate junctions correspond to a sparse graph of junction evidences .
after the candidates are found , splice junction and fusion predictions are made with optional quality thresholds. c. as a first step in sasr , 10 to 35 bp ends from each end of the exon are stored in two lexicographical dictionaries .
stored suffix starts are shown as a vertical stop and end with empty triangles. d. 10 base pairs from the left and right ends of the read ( decamers ) are searched in the 3 ' and 5 ' end dictionaries , respectively , with a binary string search .
decamers are matched without mismatches .
matching decamers are extended as possible ( with up to two mismatches ) to determine whether they cover the entire suffix .
mismatches are illustrated as vertical lines .
up to ten bases are clipped from the ends of the reads until a matching read is found. e. decamer block size frequency in the hg18 refseq database .

120 and 150 refer to insert size of rna library .
mcf - 7 and mcf - 7 - 2 libraries were prepared separately from the same lot .
known splicing events are found in refseq database whereas putative splicing events were not .
to assess the performance of mapping quality values generated with the system , we compared fold - change ratio ( log2 [ uhr / hbr ]) of gene rpkm values with gene expression assays from the microarray quality control ( maqc ) project [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
we compared correlation of four different pqv ( 1 , 10 , 20 and 40 ) thresholds with the assays ( figure s4 in text s1 ) .
pearson correlations of data from taqman assays with that of the data from the solid system were not significantly different between pqv thresholds .
the slope ( m ) of the regression fits , however , was significantly affected by the threshold settings .
as pqv is increased from 1 to 40 , the slope increased dramatically from 0.77 to 0.88 , indicating significantly greater accuracy compared to a " gold standard " qpcr method .
the increase in accuracy is likely a result of increased specificity .
essentially , the log ratio dynamic range increases with increasing pqv settings ( figure s5 in text s1 ) .
rpkm distributions show an increase in low - end signal for lower pqv .
if this increase in " sensitivity " represents additional noise , it can contribute to a loss of accuracy in the fold change calculations .
the increase in the low end suggests that these reads may be spurious ( figure s6 in text s1 ) .
parameter stringency and quality assessment in order to find optimal filters for detecting splice junctions with our combined approach , we compared three quality thresholds using data from the uhr and hbr barcoded libraries : ( 1 ) one span evidence ( 1 - sr ) , ( 2 ) two unique span evidences ( 2 - sr ) , and ( 3 ) one bridge and one span evidences ( 1 - pe - 1 - sr ) .
in addition to these tested thresholds , we applied default filter of choosing only primary alignments with pqv > 10 .
the results , as illustrated in figure 2 , suggest an increased number of false positives for 1 - sr evidence even though it may have greater sensitivity .
1 - pe - 1 - sr threshold reduced false positives especially for fusions , generating less calls than 2 - sr threshold .
for the analyses described later in the text , 1 - pe - 1 - sr threshold was chosen for calling splice junctions and 2 - pe - 2 - sr for calling gene fusions .
on average , 82 % of junctions identified in the libraries were present in the refseq database .
84 % of these known junctions and 26 % of the putative junctions were shared between at least two of the three libraries ( figure s7 in text s1 ) .
the highest number of library - specific known junctions was observed in hbr , and the highest number of library - specific putative junctions was observed in mcf - 7 .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1002464.g002 figure 2 combined evidence improves specificity of splice and fusion detection .
scatterplots show the increasing mapped coverage ( x - axis ) versus left : known refseq junctions ; middle : putative junctions ; right : fusion junctions .
top track shows results for uhr and bottom track for hbr .
three different evidence thresholds were compared : 1 ) red line : one span ( sr ) evidence required for junction call , 2 ) magenta line : two span ( 2 - sr ) evidences required for junction call , and 3 ) blue line : one span and one bridge evidence ( 1 - sr - 1 - pe ) required for junction call .
next , we formulated a junction confidence value ( jcv ) and investigated its utility to identify true versus false junctions .
details of jcv and its formulation are explained in supplementary methods in text s1 .
one type of false positive fusion junction is likely called between highly expressed exons for which the random chance of encountering a misalignment or mispairing is elevated .
homology between highly expressed genes would also increase this type of false positive .
we created jcv to test the quantity and quality of bridge evidences when compared to an ' error expectation metric ' .
this metric is defined as the estimation of the null hypothesis of encountering a random junction between the two exons .
increasing jcv increased known / putative junction ratio which was predictive of the false discovery rate and at the same time distinguished significant number of novel junctions to either lower or higher score bins ( figure 3a ) .
known / putative ratios ranged from 0.15 for jcv cutoff of 0 ; 3 for jcv cutoff of 50 and 16 for jcv cutoff of 100 .
in order to test the sensitivity of jcv , we simulated 1,000,000 junctions based on a combination parameter model of true junction expression ratio and false junction misalignment ratio .
true positive rate ( tpr ) and false positive rate ( fpr ) were calculated by comparing whether a called junction was real ( figures s8 , s9 , s10 in text s1 ) .
these simulations showed that jcv was predictive of true junction calls and higher jcv thresholds resulted in much less fpr and slightly less tpr .
we performed a separate simulation of gene fusion detection using reads from a dh10b ( e.coli ) dna sequencing experiment where introns , exons and a gene model were simulated to make the data similar to rna - seq experiments .
our algorithm was able to detect 86 out of 93 simulated fusions in this experiment ( figure s11 in text s1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1002464.g003 figure 3 improvements by junction confidence value and comparison to tophat. a. logarithms of number of known and putative junctions are shown with yellow and blue bars respectively .
the ratio of known over putative is shown with dashed line .
dataset consisted of 64,000 sample uhr junctions called with default thresholds. b. tophat and lifescope candidate calls were compared to each other and also to refseq database .
tophat junctions were filtered with score > 5 , and lifescope junctions were filtered with 1 - sr - 1 - pe threshold ( requiring one span and one bridge evidence ) .
next , we ran tophat ( v1.3.0 ) on the mcf - 7 - 1 dataset by using default paired - end parameters for color space .
tophat reported 124,236,156 mapped reads of which 33,634,800 were properly paired whereas lifescope reported 404,901,929 mapped reads , of which 300,341,259 pairs were mapped to the same chromosome and 158,050,096 were properly paired ( table s1 in text s2 ). of note , tophat allows 2 mismatches on mapped reads by default and does not report pairs of reads mapped across different chromosomes .
next we identified appropriate score threshold for calling tophat junctions .
for each junction found , tophat reports a score which corresponds to the number of reads that span the junction .
tophat reported 1,391,319 total junctions without any score filter and with score > 5 threshold this number reduced to 53,402 ( figure s12 in text s1 ) .
we used tophat candidate junctions with score > 5 for comparison to refseq known and lifescope candidate junctions ( figure 3b ) .
there is some evidence that score > 10 may yield more specific results for tophat ( figure s12 in text s1 ). of note , known ( refseq ) junctions called by tophat dropped from 129,316 ( score > 0 ) to 106,962 ( score > 5 ) .
these results suggest that tophat detects a large number of putative novel junctions yet is not as sensitive when distinguishing false positives .
lifescope detected 15,074 putative novel junctions between known exons of the same gene that were n't called by tophat .
we could distinguish that more than half of these ' lifescope - only ' junctions were likely true positives by looking at their jcv ; 3,520 had jcv = 0 and 8,481 had jcv = 100 with the rest having scores between 0 and 100 .
detection and validation of fusion transcripts in the mcf - 7 cell line using the combined bridge & span approach described above on the uhr sample , we called and validated previously reported gene fusions including bcr - abl1 , gas6 - rasa3 , arfgef2 - sulf2 , nup214 - xkr3 and bat3 - slc44a4 [ 37 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
these fusions were not described in the literature for hbr , and as expected were not identified in the hbr samples sequenced .
in mcf - 7 , a total of 40 putative fusions were identified in the first sequencing run ( 50x25 paired - end ) , of which 26 were detected again in a second run ( 75x35 paired - end ) out of a total 56 fusion calls ( table s2 in text s2 ) .
we also analyzed first mcf - 7 sequencing dataset using fusionseq ( sboner et. al. ) .
six of the forty gene fusions identified by lifescope were also called by this software .
fusionseq 's confidence value ( resper ) for these calls ranged from 1.15 to 4.53. of importance , the ribosomal filter and single read validation module of fusionseq ( version 0.7 ) did not handle color space data or data with different read length pairs adding to 5807 total calls with resper > 1 ( table s3 in text s2 ) .
based on the calls from the first mcf - 7 sequencing experiment , we prepared 40 taqman fusion assays and run them on the uhr , hbr , and mcf - 7 samples along with the prostate cell line pc - 3 as an additional control .
36 ( 90 %) of the fusions were validated with the assays and 25 ( 63 %) were found to be specific to mcf - 7 and uhr ( table 2 and table s4 in text s2 ) .
to note , 19 of these " specific " fusions were called with our algorithms in the second run of mcf - 7 .
jcv values correlated with whether a fusion was called again , and also with the number of unique start points ( figure s13 in text s1 ) .

inverted fusions are on same chromosome but different strands .
last four columns show the cycle threshold ( ct ) value in taqman assays .
lower ct values indicate higher expression .
real - time pcr cycle threshold ( ct ) values showed that each of the mcf - 7 gene fusions was expressed in uhr with around ten - fold less expression ( table 2 ) .
this suggests that mcf - 7 or one of its parent or sister cell lines is very likely part of the uhr pool .
according to the information provided by the supplier , uhr rna is prepared from a pool of ten different cancer cell lines , one of which is an ' adenocarinoma , mammary gland ' .
mcf - 7 is an adenocarcinoma cell line from mammary gland. from the rna - seq calls , nine of the mcf - 7 gene fusions were detectable in uhr with ~ 200 million confidently mapped reads whereas these fusions were detectable in mcf - 7 with only ~ 80 million reads .
it is likely that deeper sequencing of the uhr pool would have identified the remaining fusions .
many mcf - 7 fusions were between genes in three bands of chr 1 , chr 17 and chr 20 ( figure 4 ) .
these bands were previously described as rearrangement " hot - spots " [ 50 ]. of the total 11 inter - chromosomal or inverted intra - chromosomal fusions , five had premature stop codons ( not in frame ) , while six were in frame .
two of the fusions were alternatively spliced including the fusion from the second exon of esr1 to the sixth and seventh exon of c6orf97 , and the fusion from the first and second exon of adamts19 to the tenth exon of slc27a6 .
we also found several new intra - chromosomal gene fusions mostly between adjacent or neighboring genes ( table s4 in text s2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1002464.g004 figure 4 localization of gene fusions on specific chromosomal regions. a. whole genome and b. chr 1 , 17 and 20 gene fusions circular graph .
red lines represent inter - chromosomal gene fusions , blue lines represent inverted intra - chromosomal and black lines represent same - strand intra - chromosomal fusion events .
graphs were drawn with circos software [ 61 ] .
we observed an enrichment of fusions for which the breakpoints were in the first intron of a gene , a similar bias explained also in inaki et al. , 2011 .
this pattern was not observed for the uhr and hbr samples ( figure 5a - b ) .
on average , first introns in the refseq database ( hg18 ) constitute 22 % of a gene .
we asked whether the large intron size alone might explain the breakpoint bias at the 5 ' introns .
we used a parametric bootstrap approach to test the hypothesis that gene fusions are more likely to occur towards the 5 ' end of a gene ; for example , after the first exon .
assuming that the breakpoint was in the middle of the intron following the fused exon , we considered breakpoints for 23 fusions from table 2 ( omitting multiple splices for esr1 and adamts19 ) .
we simulated 100,000 gene fusion locations in these 23 genes from a uniform distribution within the gene .
we normalized the location of the real gene fusions by gene length ( defined as the distance between the start of the first exon and the end of the last exon ) .
we calculated the mean fusion location of the 23 genes , in the observed fusions and in the simulated fusions .
in the real fusions , the mean insert location was 0.2587 ( 26 % of the length of the gene , figure 5c ) .
in 100,000 simulated sets of 23 fusions , the mean was 0.5 and the standard deviation was 0.06 .
only three in 100,000 of the simulated sets of fusions had a value less than 0.2587 .
thus the observed location of the gene fusions is statistically significantly biased towards the 5 ' end of the gene , with a p - value estimated at 3x10 - 5 .

23 fusions correspond to the gene fusions from table 2 ( except for esr1 - c6orf97 , and adamts19 - slc27a6 alternatively spliced fusions merged into single data points ) .
survey of uhr and mcf - 7 fusions in cell lines and clinical tumor samples to test recurrence , we selected 24 fusions from uhr and mcf - 7 and investigated their expression in 20 cancer cell line samples ( figure 6 ) .
uhr fusions bcr - abl1 and bat3 - slc44a4 were found expressed in the myelogenous leukemia cell line k562 but with eightfold higher expression than in uhr .
gas6 - rasa3 fusion was expressed only in uhr .
most of the fusions in mcf - 7 were also expressed at a low level in the du4475 cell line with a higher ct value (> 35 for most cases ) .
both mcf - 7 and du4475 cell lines are traced to a 69 / 70 - year old caucasian female from georgetown , but contamination , mixing , mislabeling , or differences in culturing may have caused the observed expression .

lower cycle threshold ( ct ) indicates a higher level of expression and is highlighted in blue .
high ct ( max 40 , yellow ) indicates no expression .
ppia is used as positive control and non template control sample ( ntc ) as negative control .
two of the intra - chromosomal gene fusions were expressed in multiple samples : esr1 - c6orf97 and rps6kb1 - tmem49 .
the first of these fusions , between the estrogen receptor alpha gene esr1 and its neighboring gene c6orf97 on chr 6 was expressed in two other er + breast cancer cell lines in addition to uhr , mcf - 7 , and du4475 .
this fusion may have occurred due to an inversion or rearrangement , as normally the esr1 gene is downstream of c6orf97 on the genome ( on the same strand , 128,831 base pairs apart ) ; yet the fusion junction was observed to be from the second exon of esr1 to the sixth exon of c6orf97 , in the reverse order of expected transcription .
we noted that these two genes were considerably expressed in mcf - 7 ( rpkm 16 and 46 average ) , though not expressed at all in hbr ( rpkm < 0.5 ) , and weakly expressed in uhr ( rpkm 1 and 1.8 ) .
the second recurring fusion , rps6kb1 - tmem49 , was found expressed in four cancer cell lines including hcc2157 and helas3 .
we further tested the presence of 24 candidate fusions in cdna from 48 clinical samples of normal and breast tumors ( origene ) .
we found esr1 - c6orf97 expressed in one er + tumor , and none of the other fusions were expressed .
discussion rna - seq allows interrogation of known and novel transcript expression and discovery of gene fusions .
we describe a new suffix array algorithm to find fusion breakpoint spanning reads in a hypothesis - neutral fashion .
we combine this algorithm with a new paired - end mapping approach to detect gene fusions sensitively and reliably .
our mapping method works with a predefined set of exon boundaries which is readily available for the human genome from refgene or ensembl databases .
to detect novel splicing sites different from the known junctions , one can first find novel expressed islands of reads with tools such as tophat [ 8 ] , and next add the predicted novel exons to the gene model , prior to using our tool .
other de novo assembly algorithms , as long as they generate de novo exon boundaries , and mapped back to genome coordinates , may also be used with our tool [ 51 ] - [ 54 ]. by sequencing and analyzing the maqc samples uhr and hbr , and the breast cancer cell line mcf - 7 , we validated 25 gene fusions specific to mcf - 7 and uhr. of these , five were not in frame and had premature stop codons .
these fusions might still deploy a negative constraint on the fused genes by increasing non - sense mediated decay ( nmd ) [ 55 ] .
in addition , several gene fusions that occur at the genomic level might not have been detected by messenger rna sequencing ( mrna ) because their pre - cursor mrnas would have been degraded by the nmd mechanism .
such fusions may be identified by dna - level sequencing. of the 29 intra - chromosomal fusions called in mcf - 7 in this study , 12 were not described in investigated literature ( table s4 in text s2 ) .
interestingly , most of the adjacent mcf - 7 gene fusions did not fit the standard definition of " read - through " since they did not occur between last and first exons of the fused genes and in some cases they occurred in inverse order of expected transcription .
this indicates that these fusions may had arisen due to trans - splicing or structural mutations such as deletions or inversions .
these hypotheses may be tested by directly sequencing the dna from these regions. by surveying cancer cell lines with taqman assays , we observed that two of the mcf - 7 fusions involving adjacent genes , esr1 - c6orf97 and rbs6kb1 - tmem49 were expressed recurrently .
fusions of the esr1 gene may disrupt estrogen signaling pathways and thus events involving this gene may be significant .
rbs6kb1 - vmp1 fusion was described as a recurrent event recently by another group [ 45 ] .
vmp1 is another name for tmem49 .
amplification of the rps6kb1 loci ( ribosomal protein s6 kinase beta - 1 ) was described in other breast cancers as an oncogene event [ 56 ] .
still , it is possible these recurrent fusions arise only in immortalized cell lines rather than being driver mutations .
in fact , the esr1 fusion tested positive in only one of the 48 clinical breast samples , while the rps6kb1 fusion was not expressed in any of them. of interest , six of the fusions originated on the band 17q23 , which was previously identified as a common region of amplification in cancer [ 57 ] .
in many of the mcf - 7 fusions , the first or early introns of the 5 ' genes harbored the gene fusion breakpoint .
a similar pattern was observed in prostate cancer : the complete exon - 1 of tmprss2 was identified to fuse with etv1 or erg as one of the most recurrent rearrangements [ 31 ] .
recent studies on prostate cancer found extended breakpoints at the androgen receptor binding sites possibly due to line - 1 - induced orf or topoisomerase - ii beta .
these enzymes , when co - recruited with an androgen receptor , were linked to increased chromosomal translocations of the tmprss2 , etv1 , and erg genes [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] .
presence of the early 5 ' breakpoints in mcf - 7 genes suggest that recurrent double - stranded breaks may occur in breast tumors at the gene promoter and early splicing sites due to factors not mediated by the androgen receptor .
in conclusion , we presented a novel method of splice and fusion detection from rna - seq data .
we sequenced mcf - 7 , uhr and hbr , and demonstrated high specificity in finding splices and fusions de novo .
we further showed that two of the mcf - 7 gene fusions are expressed recurrently in a number of tumor cell lines .

rna - seq alignment pipeline reads were aligned to a reference using the mapreads module of the bioscope 1.3 and lifescope 2.0 software ( http :// www.lifetechnologies.com / lifescope ) .
four fasta references were used for increased throughput and accuracy : ( 1 ) genomic reference , ( 2 ) junction reference , ( 3 ) exon reference , and ( 4 ) filter reference ( figure 1b ) .
filter reference contained polya , polyc , polyg , polyt , ribosomal rnas , trnas , line , sine , ltr and satellite repeats , rrna , scrna and snrnas , as well as adaptor , barcode , and primer sequences .
in our experiments , most reads filtered to ribosomal rnas and merged adaptor - barcode - primer sequences .
when aligning reads to the genome , two mismatches were allowed on the seed , and alignments were extended when possible based on a dynamic scoring function .
the junction reference library was generated from a list of known and putative exon - exon pairs within refseq transcripts and contained approximately two million fasta entries .
reverse reads in our experiments were shorter than forward reads ( 25 vs 50 , or 35 vs 75 ) .
to increase the mapping rate for the shorter reverse reads , they were additionally aligned to an ' exon reference ' by allowing three mismatches on the seed .
this exon reference contained each known exon as a separate reference entry .
an exon rescue step was performed for reads where one pair was mapped within a gene and its pair was unaligned , by aligning the unmapped read within the downstream exons of the same gene with up to six mismatches .
the genome , exon , junction , and rescued alignments were merged to generate a single set of alignments for the forward and reverse tags separately .
reads that aligned confidently to the filter reference were subtracted from these alignments .
a final pairing step was performed to find most probable alignment pairs and assign a pairing quality value ( for formulas see methods in text s1 ) .
these final paired alignments were put in a genome - coordinate bam file which represents the summary of mapped alignments except for fusion alignments found by sasr .
suffix array spliced read ( sasr ) fusion finder for reads that were admissible as a candidate to be spliced on a fusion junction ( see methods in text s1 for admission criteria ) , we performed a suffix array search as follows .
a read was defined to provide evidence of a splice junction between an exon x and exon y if and only if ( 1 ) exon x maps to the prefix of the read , ( 2 ) exon y maps to the suffix of the read and ( 3 ) the sum of the two map lengths is equal to the length of the read .
for 50 - bp long reads ( or 49 colors plus a leading base ) , the suffix data structure was simply a list ( an array ) of all suffixes of length 10 through 38 from all exons .
the suffixes were stored in lexicographically increasing order .
a string s = s1s2 ... sm is lexicographically ( i.e. alphabetically ) less than a string t = t1t2 ... tn if s1 < t1 or s1 = t1 , and string s2s3 ... sm is lexicographically less than string t2t3 ... tn. each suffix was represented compactly by a pair of integers ( an integer and a byte in the implementation ) : an index to the relevant exon in the input exon list , and the length of the suffix .
such a data structure is called a suffix array [ 60 ] .
because of the lexicographic order proper , all suffixes that start with any given decamer were consecutive in such a list .
therefore , one may quickly find all matching suffixes with a binary search into the suffix array .
once the list of exons that mapped to the prefix and suffix of the read were identified , it could be determined whether the read provided evidence for a unique junction .
junction evidence graph and evaluation filters a read was considered to be a span evidence for a junction x - y between two exons if it was already junction mapped or if it was discovered by sasr as described above .
a paired - end read was considered bridge evidence for a junction x - y if one read of the pair mapped to exon x and the other mapped to exon y with pqv > 10 .
candidate junctions were stored , each with a count of evidence , number of unique start points and corresponding pqv , in a sparse , directed graph .
in this graph , exons corresponded to nodes , and span and bridge evidences corresponded to two types of edges between nodes .
after all evidence was collected , junctions were called by evaluating each candidate and assigning a junction confidence value .
at least one and two unique evidences of each type were respectively required to call same - gene and different - gene junctions ( fusion ) .
exons could partially overlap , allowing for junctions with different donor and acceptor sites to be counted as alternative splices as long as at least two alternatives were detected .
genes with overlapping annotations were not counted towards a gene fusion if the evidence was ambiguous .
paired - end rna library preparation and sequencing human breast adenocarcinoma ( mcf - 7 ) total rna and firstchoice ( r ) human brain reference rna ( hbr ) were obtained from ambion .
universal human reference total rna ( uhr ) was obtained from stratagene .
oligo ( dt ) selection was performed twice by using micropoly ( a ) purist ( tm ) kit ( ambion ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
after polya selection , 500 ng polya rna was fragmented using rnase iii .
50 ng fragmented rna was then subjected to hybridization and ligation using the solid total rna - seq kit ( ambion ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
duplicate libraries , with three different insert sizes ( 100 - 200 bp , 100 - 300 bp , 150 - 250 bp ) , were generated from hbr and uhr rnas .
a total of 12 libraries were multiplexed using the solid rna barcoding kit ( applied biosystems ) and pooled at an equi - molar ratio .
two libraries were made from same lot of mcf - 7 polya rna with standard insert size ( 100 - 200 bp ) .
the final purified products were quantitated using a nanodrop ( r ) instrument , and the size range of the products was confirmed by bioanalyzer ( tm ) instrument analysis .
the samples were then diluted and used for emulsion pcr .
libraries were sequenced utilizing 50 or 75 bp forward and 25 or 35 bp reverse paired - end sequencing chemistry on the solid system [ 47 ] .
taqman real - time pcr assay validation taqman probes and primers were designed for selected fusion targets .
for each putative fusion call , the target region for assay design was composed of 200 bases around the fusion point : the first 100 from the 5 ' gene exon and the second 100 from the 3 ' gene exon .
if either of the exons was smaller than 100 bases , the entire exon was taken but no bases from a further exon were used .
therefore , any target region had a maximum of 200 bases .
these target sequences were then used to select taqman assay probes and primers which were ordered from applied biosystems .
these assays were used to validate the novel fusion candidates in universal human reference rna sample ( stratagene ) , mcf - 7 rna ( ambion ) , human brain reference rna ( ambion ) , and a no template control sample .
cdnas were generated from 2.5 ug total rna from each sample using the high capacity cdna archive kit and protocol ( applied biosystems ) .
the resulting cdna products were diluted twenty - fold and four replicates were run for each gene for each sample in a 384 - well format plate on 7900ht fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
cancer cell line and breast cancer clinical sample screening 24 selected fusion targets ( figure 6 ) were screened across 20 cancer cell line rnas and negative template control ( ntc , table s5 in text s2 ) using taqman probe and primers .
real - time pcr reactions were run as described above .
the same selected 24 fusion targets were also screened in 48 breast cancer clinical samples ( origene ) using taqman probe and primers .
cdnas were generated from 2 ng total rna from each sample using the high capacity cdna archive kit and protocol ( applied biosystems ) .
the resulting cdna was subjected to a 16 - cycle pcr amplification followed by real - time pcr reaction using the manufacturer 's taqman preamp master mix kit protocol ( applied biosystems ) .
preamplifed cdna products were diluted twentyfold and four replicates were run for each gene for each sample in a 384 - well plate on a 7900ht fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .

noise - induced hearing loss ( nihl ) is a global health problem affecting over 5 % of the population worldwide .
we have shown previously that acute noise - induced cochlear injury can be ameliorated by administration of drugs acting on adenosine receptors in the inner ear , and a selective a1 adenosine receptor agonist adenosine amine congener ( adac ) has emerged as a potentially effective treatment for cochlear injury and resulting hearing loss .
this study investigated pharmacokinetic properties of adac in rat perilymph after systemic ( intravenous ) administration using a newly developed liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry detection method .
the method was developed and validated in accordance with the usa fda guidelines including accuracy , precision , specificity , and linearity .
perilymph was sampled from the apical turn of the cochlea to prevent contamination with the cerebrospinal fluid .
adac was detected in cochlear perilymph within two minutes following intravenous administration and remained in perilymph above its minimal effective concentration for at least two hours .
the pharmacokinetic pattern of adac was significantly altered by exposure to noise , suggesting transient changes in permeability of the blood - labyrinth barrier and / or cochlear blood flow .
this study supports adac development as a potential clinical otological treatment for acute sensorineural hearing loss caused by exposure to traumatic noise .

introduction hearing loss is a growing health problem affecting 360 million people worldwide .
disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 40 db in the better hearing ear in adults and a hearing loss greater than 30 db in the better hearing ear in children [ 1 ] .
noise - induced hearing loss ( nihl ) is caused by exposure to high intensity impulse noise or prolonged exposure to moderate or high levels of noise .
the lack of hearing protection at work , increasing usage of portable music players , and the frequent exposure to recreational noise are considered to have a significant impact on the incidence of nihl [ 2 , 3 ] .
hearing loss ( measured as auditory threshold shift ) may be temporary ( tts ) , if a repair mechanism is able to restore the organ of corti or permanent ( pts ) when the sensory hair cells or auditory neurons die .
exposure to continuous or impulse noise can cause mechanical damage and metabolic disruptions in the cochlea of the inner ear [ 4 , 5 ] .
oxidative stress commences during noise exposure and continues for up to two weeks after noise exposure [ 6 ] .
other mechanisms of nihl include glutamate excitotoxicity , ca2 + overload in sensory hair cells , inflammation , ischemia / reperfusion injury , and cochlear synaptopathy [ 5 , 7 ] .
currently , prosthetic devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants are the only treatments for nihl .
both options are costly , and neither can mitigate cochlear injury .
therefore , there is a strong demand for novel pharmacological or molecular treatments of sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) .
targeting adenosine a1 receptors in the cochlea has recently shown promise for the treatment of snhl [ 8 - 12 ] .
adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator and a cytoprotective substance released from tissues in response to stress [ 13 , 14 ] .
adenosine can enhance endogenous antioxidant defenses , increase oxygen supply , improve blood flow , inhibit glutamate release , trigger anti - inflammatory responses , and promote antiapoptotic pathways [ 14 , 15 ] .
adenosine can also promote angiogenesis , which may be crucial in tissue repair after injury [ 15 , 16 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated a wide distribution of adenosine receptors in the mammalian cochlea , including chinchillas and rats [ 18 , 19 ] .
all four adenosine receptors ( a1 , a2a , a2b , and a3 ) are expressed in the rat cochlea , with the strongest immunoexpression of otoprotective a1 adenosine receptors ( a1ar ) in sensory hair cells , supporting deiters' cells and spiral ganglion neurons [ 19 ] .
previous studies have shown that noise - and drug - induced hearing loss can be prevented in experimental animals by local or systemic administration of a1ar agonists [ 9 , 12 , 20 , 21 ] .
in 2010 , we demonstrated for the first time that the postexposure administration of selective a1ar agonists ( 2 - chloro - n6 - cyclopentyladenosine and adenosine amine congener ) could ameliorate nihl in rats [ 8 , 10 ] .
adenosine amine congener ( adac ) is a synthetic a1ar agonist which was designed in a functionalised congener concept [ 22 ] .
this compound is able to cross the blood brain barrier and is well tolerated by animals after systemic administration .
namely , no cardiovascular side effects ( hypotension , hypothermia , and bradycardia ) were observed at the dose used for neuroprotection [ 10 , 23 - 25 ] .
our study [ 10 ] demonstrated that even a single intraperitoneal injection of adac 24 hours after traumatic noise exposure partially reversed the hearing loss and reduced sensory hair cell death in rats .
a five - day treatment of daily adac injections , starting six hours after exposure to noise , was most effective , rescuing approximately 25 - 30 db of otherwise permanent hearing loss .
the improvement of hearing thresholds was supported by increased survival of sensory hair cells and reduced expression of oxidative stress markers in the cochlea [ 10 ] .
in a follow - up study , we investigated dose - and time - dependent effects of adac in a rat model of nihl [ 11 ] .
the dose - response study indicated that adac was most effective at 100 - 200 mug / kg doses .
best effect of the treatment was observed in the first 24 hours after noise exposure , but even delayed treatment after 48 hours provided clinically significant improvement at some hearing frequencies .
however , little is known about the biological fate of adac after systemic administration and its pharmacokinetic properties at the target organ ( cochlea of the inner ear ) .
pharmacokinetics describes the movement of a drug through the living organism , including its absorption , distribution , metabolism , and elimination [ 26 ] .
understanding the pharmacokinetic properties of adac in experimental animals is essential for assessment of its clinical applicability , as it may provide a prediction of adac pharmacokinetics in humans [ 27 ] .
in the present study , we used liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lcms / ms ) to establish the pharmacokinetic properties of adac in rat perilymph after systemic administration .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animals male wistar rats sourced from the animal facility at the university of auckland were used in this study .
at the age of 8 - 10 weeks they were randomly assigned to control or noise - exposed groups ( table 1 ) .
the use of animals and experimental procedures were approved by the university of auckland animal ethics committee and conformed to international guidelines for the ethical use of animals .
2.2 .
noise exposure rats were exposed to octave - band noise ( 110 db spl , 8 - 16 khz bandwidth ) for 2 hours to study the effect of acoustic overexposure on adac concentrations in perilymph .
noise exposures were carried out in a custom built acoustic chamber ( shelburg acoustics , sydney , australia ) equipped with an internal light source and ventilation system .
the noise was produced by a noise generator , filtered , amplified , and delivered via two internal speakers suspended from the ceiling of the booth .
two rats per cage were positioned in the centre of the sound chamber directly underneath the suspended speakers .
the sound exposure levels within the chamber were measured using a handheld calibrated sound level meter ( rion nl - 52 , tokyo , japan ) .
control animals were exposed to ambient noise levels in the animal facility ( 55 - 65 db spl ) and kept for two hours in the sound - proof booth without noise exposure .
2.3 .
adac preparation adac ( sigma - aldrich ) was dissolved in 1 m hcl and then in 0.1 m phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ; ph 7.4 ) to prepare a 100 mug / ml stock solution .
the stock solution was aliquoted and stored at - 20degreesc , and it was later used to prepare calibration standards and injection solutions .
when required , adac aliquots were heated in a 37degreesc water bath for 30 min and administered through the femoral vein to animals exposed to traumatic or ambient noise .
2.4 .
adac administration and perilymph sampling animals were anaesthetised with ketamine ( 25 mg / kg ) and medetomidine ( domitor ( r ) , 10 mg / kg ) administered intraperitoneally .
once an appropriate depth of anaesthesia was achieved , the skin on the upper medial aspect of the left leg was disinfected with 70 % ethanol , followed by a skin incision parallel to the femoral vein .
the femoral vein was exposed and the intravenous line inserted for adac injection .
the rat was supinely positioned under a dissection microscope ( leica wild m7a ) and the head was placed in the head - holder .
a heating blanket was used to maintain a rectal temperature at 38degreesc .
the ventral neck region was opened with a large incision , and the salivary and sublingual glands were exposed by separating the fascia and connective tissue and dissected out using thermocautery .
the trachea was exposed by bluntly teasing out the sternohyoid muscle , and the endotracheal tube was inserted .
the tympanic bulla was exposed by gently teasing away the muscles and connective tissue , and a hole was made in the bulla to expose the cochlea .
the cochlea was wiped with tissue paper and dried using compressed air to avoid any seepage and loss of perilymph due to capillary effect .
at intervals ( 1 - 120 min ) after adac ( 100 mug / kg , i.v. ) injection , the area corresponding to the scala vestibuli in the apical turn was punctured using a fine needle (~ 50 mum ) .
a calibrated capillary tube ( harvard apparatus gc100 - 10 , 1.0 mm od x 0.58 mm id ) was held over the perforation as soon as the perilymph fluid started oozing out .
the total volume of the perilymph collected per cochlea was 2.26 mul .
the capillary tubes were calibrated for volume using the id and length of capillary .
to avoid contamination with cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) or endolymph , the volume of 2.26 mul was chosen as lesser than the average rat cochlear perilymph volume ( 3.02 mul ) [ 28 ] .
the collected perilymph sample was emptied into a vial with 50 mul of saline and transferred to an lc vial with plastic insert ( agilent technologies ) .
only one perilymph sample was collected from each cochlea .
the samples were then stored at - 80degreesc for lcms / ms analysis .
2.5 .
lcms / ms instrumentation the lcms / ms system used in this study was agilent 1200 series rp - hplc ( agilent technologies ( r ) , santa clara , california ) coupled with agilent 6460 series triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with jet stream electron spray ionisation source ( agilent technologies ) .
chromatographic separation was achieved using a phenomenex ( r ) gemini column ( 5 mum c18 110 a , 150 x 3.00 mm ) protected with a phenomenex gemini c18 guard column ( 4 x 2 mm id ) .
the lcms / ms conditions and instrument settings are summarised in table 2 .
data were acquired and analysed using agilent masshunter software .
the assay was validated in rat plasma in accordance with the us fda guidelines on bioanalytical methods for linearity , selectivity / specificity , precision , and accuracy [ 29 ] .
selectivity / specificity was examined by collecting blank plasma , homogenised cochlear tissues , and perilymph samples from untreated rats to look for any endogenous peaks that could interfere with the adac peak .
accuracy and precision were evaluated by analysing the matrix spike samples at two concentration levels : low qc ( 1 ng / ml ) and high qc ( 50 ng / ml ) .
five replicates were examined per qc concentration .
accuracy was calculated by comparing the detected concentration with the true spiked concentration in plasma .
precision was expressed as relative standard deviations ( rsd %) .
calibration curves obtained in this study included a blank sample , five nonzero samples including the lower limit of quantification ( lloq ) .
lloq was evaluated on the signal to noise ratio of 5 : 1 with precision and accuracy within 20 % of the nominal value .
linearity was assessed by preparing calibration curves and plotting the peak area size of adac against its concentration .
2.6 .
data analysis unpaired two - tailed t - test was used to compare mean adac concentrations in perilymph of noise - exposed and nonexposed animals .
the pharmacokinetic ( pk ) data were analysed by pksolver [ 17 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
lcms / ms method development and validation procedure the lcms / ms method was developed from the rp - hplc method for adac detection in rat plasma reported in our previous study [ 11 ] .
during the method development , low collision energy ( 20 v ) was able to shred the adac molecule ( m / z 577 ) into two daughter ions with m / z 445 and 132 , respectively .
after evaluating the molecular structure of adac ( figure 1 ) , the data suggested that the bond breakage occurred at the bond where the side chain joins the ribose sugar .
the larger ion ( m / z 445 ) presented the stronger signal ; hence the final method used multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) for the larger ion only .
the run time was 10 min and the retention time ~ 2.5 min ( figure 2 ( a )) .
the homogenised cochlear matrix sample , the cochlear matrix spike sample , the perilymph matrix sample , and the perilymph matrix spike sample are shown in figures 2 ( b ) - 2 ( e ) .
no endogenous peaks coinciding with the retention time of adac were observed in blank plasma ( n = 5 ) , homogenised rat cochlea ( n = 6 cochleae from 3 animals ) , and perilymph samples ( n = 5 ) from untreated animals .
accuracy and precision were assessed using qc samples and values are reported in table 3 .
variations for both low and high spikes were less than 15 % from the true values .
the comparison of loq and lloq for adac using rp - hplc and lcms / ms methods is shown in table 4 .
3.2 .
assessment of adac concentrations in perilymph by lcms / ms rats were randomly assigned to a control or noise - exposed group to investigate whether noise exposure had any impact on the permeability of the blood - perilymph barrier and adac concentrations in perilymph .
after noise exposure , animals were allowed to rest for 1 h before intravenous administration of adac , and a single perilymph collection was performed for each cochlea at different intervals over a period of 120 min after adac administration .
figure 3 illustrates changes in adac concentrations in perilymph of noise - exposed and nonexposed animals .
in control animals exposed to ambient noise , adac appeared in the perilymph within 2 min after injection into the femoral vein , peaked at 7 min , followed by drug elimination phase .
adac was still detectable in the perilymph after 120 min ( figure 3 ) .
in noise - exposed animals , adac peaked at the same time ( tmax = 7 min ) but resulted in higher peak concentration ( apparent cmax = 15.35 ng / ml in noise - exposed versus 10.77 ng / ml in control animals ) .
adac concentration dropped quickly in noise - exposed rats after reaching the peak and fluctuated in the first 60 min after administration followed by steady drug elimination phase .
the results suggest that adac can reach the perilymph promptly after injection into the femoral vein , and its concentration is maintained above mec for at least 2 h. comparison of the two experimental conditions revealed higher average drug concentrations in perilymph of the nonexposed cochleae ( 6.20 +/ - 2.38 ; mean +/ - sd across all time points ; n = 22 ) compared to noise - exposed cochleae ( 4.26 +/ - 3.80 ; n = 31 ; p = 0.03 , unpaired t - test ) .
the data were then analysed using pksolver ( an add - in program for pharmacokinetic data analysis in microsoft excel ) to determine basic pk parameters , including half - life in perilymph , area under curve , and clearance .
drug half - life ( t1 / 2 ) and mean residence time ( mrt ) were shorter in noise - exposed animals ( figure 3 ) .
at the same time , area under curve ( auc ) was reduced , and the volume of distribution ( vd ) increased with noise exposure , indicating lower adac concentration in perilymph .
the comparison of the elimination constant ( k10 ) and clearance ( cl ) indicated faster drug elimination in noise - exposed animals ( figure 3 ) .
pk analysis thus suggests that noise exposure affects adac absorption , distribution , and elimination in perilymph .
4. discussion in this study , we have developed and validated the lcms / ms analytical method to study adac pharmacokinetics in cochlear perilymph .
adac was easily fragmented using low collision energy ( 20 v ) to obtain two daughter ions ( m / z of 445 and 132 ) from the parent ion. by reconstructing the two daughter ions back to their original structure , we deduced that the fragmentation took place at the neck in between the side chain and the ribose sugar backbone ( figure 1 ) .
subsequent analysis suggested that the larger ion emitted stronger signal ; hence it was selected for the quantitative analysis by multiple reaction monitoring .
our previous study [ 11 , 30 ] used uv - vis detection method to demonstrate a short ( 5 min ) half - life of adac in rat plasma after intravenous administration , which was attributed to rapid distribution in tissues .
here , we used a novel lcms / ms method for adac detection in rat perilymph which complies with limits set by us fda guidelines including accuracy , precision , specificity , and linearity [ 29 ] .
most importantly , it was possible to achieve a lloq of 0.1 ng / ml , which is three orders of magnitude greater sensitivity compared to the uv - vis detection method reported previously [ 11 ] .
as the minimum effective concentration ( mec ) for adac in rats ( 0.49 ng / ml ) [ 31 ] is almost five times higher than lloq , our lcms / ms method was suitable for detection of adac at pharmacologically relevant concentrations .
the present study demonstrates that the concentration of adac in the cochlea after 2 hours is still higher than mec for this drug , suggesting that the cochlea can maintain the therapeutic concentrations of adac for at least 2 h after intravenous administration .
we were also able to reduce the i.v. dosage ( 400 mug / kg ) from the study in rat plasma [ 11 ] to the standard dose ( 100 mug / kg ) used for the treatment of nihl [ 10 , 11 ] .
measuring drug concentration at its proposed site of action provides the most direct evidence of the pharmacokinetics of that drug [ 32 ] .
to date , there are no pharmacokinetic studies of adenosine a1 receptor agonists in cochlear perilymph .
the method for adac detection in perilymph is a technically demanding procedure as it requires direct perilymph sampling from the cochlear apical turn in anaesthetised animals and a very sensitive analytical method to measure drug concentrations in small volumes (~ 3 mul ) .
in previous studies , perilymph samples were obtained from the basal turn of the cochlea through an opening in the bony capsule or round window [ 33 , 34 ] .
such samples are likely to be contaminated with csf , as scala tympani and the csf are connected via the cochlear aqueduct near the round window membrane [ 35 ] .
therefore , in this study the perilymph was sampled from the apex of the cochlea in order to avoid csf contamination [ 32 ] .
after exposing the cochlea , a perforation was made in the apex and only the initial 2.26 mul of perilymph was collected , which is less than estimated perilymph volume in rats ( 3.02 mul ) [ 28 ] .
immediate collection and precise measurement of volume reduced the risk of sample contamination by csf [ 32 ] .
adac was detected in perilymph in the first two minutes after drug injection into the femoral vein .
the concentration reached the peak ( cmax ) within seven minutes , followed by elimination phase .
traceable amount of adac could still be detected at 120 min after administration and the concentrations were above its mec .
differences in adac absorption , distribution , and elimination between the noise - exposed and control animals were likely due to the breach of the blood - labyrinth barrier after noise exposure .
the blood - labyrinth barrier is formed by the capillary beds with tight junctions between adjacent endothelial cells and pericytes [ 36 ] .
the blood - labyrinth barrier in the inner ear regulates the volumes and the composition of the inner ear fluids [ 37 - 39 ] .
numerous studies have suggested that the disruption of this barrier can result in imbalance of local ionic homeostasis [ 35 , 36 ] , reduced drug entry [ 36 ] , endolymphatic hydrops [ 40 ] , and hearing loss [ 41 ] .
a recent study reported the change of blood - labyrinth barrier 's permeability after noise exposure [ 42 ]. that study identified leaky tight junctions as a possible cause of increased permeability of the blood - labyrinth barrier in the guinea pigs exposed to noise due to decreased cellular expression of claudin - 5 and occludin [ 42 ] .
it is possible that noise exposure in our study resulted in leaky tight junctions , leading to a faster adac diffusion across the blood - labyrinth barrier .
in addition to the compromised blood - labyrinth barrier , noise - induced changes in cochlear blood flow [ 43 ] could also affect adac pharmacokinetics in perilymph .
adac fluctuations in cochlear perilymph could also be attributed to cellular uptake and release by nucleoside transporters , as adac has a similar structure to adenosine .
it has been shown previously that adenosine transporter ent1 is able to transport tecadenoson , a selective a1ar agonist , across the blood brain barrier [ 44 ] .
nucleoside transport in the cochlea is sensitive to noise exposure [ 45 ] , which may result in fluctuations of adac concentrations in perilymph .
5. conclusion measurements of drug levels in cochlear fluids after local or systemic administration are required to determine their clinical potential for the treatment of inner ear disease .
human pharmacokinetic parameters are often predicted based on animal preclinical pharmacokinetic data [ 27 ] ; hence pharmacokinetic studies of adac using a rat model likely represent a good indicator of clinical concentration - time changes in perilymph .
the pharmacokinetic studies revealed that adac was able to reach cochlear perilymph rapidly after systemic ( intravenous ) administration , irrespective of the blood - perilymph barrier .
the pharmacokinetic studies also indicated that the minimal effective concentration of adac in the cochlea was maintained for at least two hours after intravenous administration , which further underlines the clinical potential of adac for the treatment of inner ear injury and hearing loss .

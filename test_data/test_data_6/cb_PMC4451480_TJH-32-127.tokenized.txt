objective : wnt5a is one of the most studied noncanonical wnt ligands and is shown to be deregulated in different tumor types .
our aim was to clarify whether hypermethylation might be the cause of low wnt5a mrna levels and whether we could restore this downregulation by reversing the event .
materials and methods : the expression of wnt5a mrna was studied in a large acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) patient group ( n = 86 ) by quantitative real - time pcr .
the methylation status was detected by methylation - specific pcr ( mspcr ) and bisulphate sequencing .
in order to determine whether methylation has a direct effect on wnt5a expression , disease - representative cell lines were treated by 5 ' - aza - 20 - deoxycytidine .
results : here we designed a validation experiment of the wnt5a gene , which was previously examined and found to be differentially expressed by microarray study in 31 t - cell all patients .
the expression levels were confirmed by quantitative real - time pcr and the expression levels were significantly lower in t - cell all patients than in control thymic subsets ( p = 0.007 ) .
mspcr revealed that 86 % of the patients were hypermethylated in the wnt5a promoter region .
jurkat and rpmi cell lines were treated with 5 ' - aza - 20 - deoxycytidine and wnt5a mrna expression was restored after treatment .
conclusion : according to our results , wnt5a hypermethylation does occur in all patients and it has a direct effect on mrna expression .
our findings show that epigenetic changes of wnt signaling can play a role in all pathogenesis and reversing methylation might be useful as a possible treatment of leukemia .

wnt5a methylation downregulation gene expression all introduction wnt signaling is a highly conserved pathway that has critical roles in differentiation , proliferation , migration , and hematopoiesis ; it is widely studied in normal and malignant development [ 1 ] .
the wnt pathway is divided into 2 main paths : the canonical , which is dependent on beta - catenin , and the noncanonical , which is independent of beta - catenin .
the molecular mechanism of the canonical wnt pathway has been studied comprehensively , whereas the exact mechanism of the noncanonical wnt pathway remains unclear .
noncanonical pathways are activated by the binding of specific wnt ligands like wnt4 , wnt5a , and wnt11 to frizzled and disheveled as in the canonical counterpart with different downstream members .
among all the noncanonical factors , wnt5a is most widely studied , since it was shown to have roles in both canonical and noncanonical wnt pathways .
wnt5a was found to be overexpressed in many solid tumors , such as in breast , prostate , colon , and lung cancers [ 2,3,4,5 ] .
on the contrary , it has been shown that wnt5a is essential for proper development but that hemizygous wnt5a mice could develop normally , except for the fact that some wnt5a hemizygous mice developed b - cell leukemia [ 6 ] .
liang et al. showed that wnt5a inhibits the proliferation of b - cells and plays a tumor - suppressing role in hematologic malignancies [ 7 ] .
the role of canonical wnt signaling was also shown in normal t - cell development [ 8 ] , but it is not well described in malignant development of t - cell leukemia .
in our previous study , we showed that canonical wnt signaling is highly deregulated in t - acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) patients .
to evaluate the potential role of wnt signaling in t - cell leukemogenesis , we performed expression analysis of key components of the wnt pathway .
more than 85 % of the childhood t - all patients showed upregulated beta - catenin expression at the protein level as compared to normal human thymocytes .
the impact of this upregulation was reflected in high expression of known target genes ( axin2 , c - myc , tcf1 , and lef ) .
when the beta - catenin gene was silenced by small interfering rna , the cancer cells showed higher rates of apoptosis .
these results demonstrate that abnormal wnt signaling activation occurs in a significant fraction of human t - all cases independently of known t - all risk factors .
we concluded that deregulated wnt signaling is a novel oncogenic event in childhood t - all [ 9 ] .
here we show that wnt5a is downregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients , which is caused by epigenetic silencing .
this finding confirms our previous results about abnormal canonical activation of wnt in t - all and the controversial actions of canonical and noncanonical wnt pathways .
materials and methods patients and controls eighty - six childhood all patients ( 52 males and 34 females ) were included in this study .
the mean age was 8.11 years ( min : 16 days , max : 17 years ) .
bone marrow samples were obtained from patients at the time of diagnosis .
all patients were treated according to the bfm protocol .
the mean wbc count was 65x109 / l ( min : 1x109 / l , max : 600x109 / l ) and cases were grouped as < 50x109 / l [ n = 45 , mean : ( 129 +/ - 110 ) x109 / l ] or > 50x109 / l [ n = 27 , mean : ( 15 +/ - 11 ) x109 / l ] .
as controls , cd19 - positive b - cells were obtained from the healthy bone marrow of transplantation donors ( n = 6 ) and normal peripheral blood ( n = 10 ) , and healthy thymocytes were obtained from healthy thymus tissue of patients scheduled for cardiac surgery .
the control samples were sorted with a facs aria ii cell sorter ( bd , usa ) .
mononuclear cells were isolated by density - gradient centrifugation over ficoll - hypaque and contained at least 90 % b cells as determined by fluorescent cd19 staining for b - cell controls and cd3 for t - cell controls .
this study was approved by the local ethics committee of the medical faculty of istanbul university ( reference number and date : 2008 / 305 and 20.02.2008 ) and informed consent was obtained from all patients and healthy controls or their families .
rna isolation and cdna synthesis bone marrow samples were stored at - 80 degreesc after homogenization in rtl buffer ( qiagen , 79216 ) .
total rna was isolated with the qiagen rneasy protect mini kit ( qiagen , 74104 ) .
rna samples were treated with dnase ( 1 u / microg , sigma , ampd1 - 1kt ) for possible dna contaminations during isolation .
one microgram of total rna was used for cdna synthesis by random hexamers and mmlv reverse transcriptase ( mbi fermentas , epo351 ) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer .
analysis of gene expression by real - time quantitative rt - pcr quantitative pcr ( qrt - pcr ) was carried out on the light cycler instrument 1.5 ( roche diagnostics , germany ) with sybr premix ex taq ( takara , rr420a ) .
the pcr conditions were prepared as per the instructions of the manufacturer and all samples were studied in duplicate .
the specificity of amplification of the products was confirmed by melting curve analyses and agarose gel electrophoresis .
the pcr program was as follows : initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 7 min ; amplification segment of 5 s at 95 degreesc , 10 s at 59 degreesc , and 10 s at 72 degreesc for 45 cycles ; and melting curve segment of 15 s at 60 degreesc for 1 cycle .
wnt5a relative expression levels were normalized to 3 reference genes ( beta - actin , cypa , and abl ) .
dna isolation , bisulphate treatment , methylation - specific pcr , and bisulphate sequencing following the dna isolation , bisulphate treatment was performed as described previously [ 10 ] .
bisulphate - treated dna was purified with the gene clean iii kit ( qbiogene , 74104 ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
after bisulphate treatment , the samples were amplified for the proximal region of the wnt5a promoter , which has been shown to regulate wnt5a transcription of the gene , by methylation - specific pcr ( mspcr ) .
the mspcr primers were designed by the methprimer database [ 11 ] .
the pcr yields were analyzed on 4 % agarose gel with ethidium bromide under uv light .
as the mspcr positive control , a healthy peripheral blood sample was methylated in vitro by the sssi methylase enzyme ( new england biolabs , m0226s ) .
to confirm the mspcr findings , samples that were treated with bisulphate were also sequenced directly by the sanger sequencing method , with a primer set that was designed outside of the cpg island area .
sequence results were analyzed with the clc main workbench 6.0 program as described by the manufacturer .
wnt5a gene expression and 5 - azacytidine treatments in acute leukemia cell lines we analyzed wnt5a methylation and expression status among the acute leukemia cell lines ( fleb14 - 4 , molt4 , jurkat , t - all1 , and rpmi 8402 ) .
methylation was confirmed by bisulphate sequencing .
the wnt5a methylated cell lines jurkat and rpmi 8402 were cultured for 4 days with 5 ' - aza - 20 - deoxycytidine ( aza ; sigma - aldrich , a3656 ) at 5 mm and 10 mm concentrations respectively in 24 - well plates ( 5x105 cells / well ) supplemented with 1 ml of rpmi 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and 1 % antibiotics ( penicillin and streptomycin ) at 37 degreesc in a humid atmosphere containing 5 % co2 .
at the 96th hour , the cells were collected for dna and rna isolations as previously described for mspcr and qrt - pcr studies .
statistical analysis relative expression levels were calculated by the delta ct method .
differences between the relative expression levels of cases and controls were tested with the mann - whitney test .
the clinical characteristics according to the methylation status were analyzed by chi - square test , fisher 's exact test , or multivariate analysis where appropriate and p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
the kaplan - meier method was used to estimate survival rates .
the median follow - up was 66 months ( min : 1 month , max : 158 months ) .
overall survival was defined by the interval from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow - up. event - free survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to treatment failure , relapse , death , or last follow - up. differences were compared with the 2 - sided log - rank test .
multivariate survival analysis was estimated according to the cox regression model .
all statistical analyses were done with spss 19.0 for windows ( ibm spss data editor inc. , usa ) and graphpad prism v ( graphpad software inc. , usa ) .
results downregulated expression of wnt5a in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases the raw data of our previous expression array study [ microarray data are available at http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo / ( accession no .
gse46170 )] were reanalyzed and evaluated for the noncanonical wnt pathway members by defining a gene list obtained from public databases and web portals ( ncbi entrez gene , wnt homepage , http :// www.stanford.edu /~ rnusse / wntwindow.html ) .
the data set was filtered to exclude genes showing minimal variation across the set of arrays from the analysis .
probe sets whose expression differed by at least 2 - fold from the median in at least 20 % of the arrays were retained .
the heat map results showed that the wnt5a is downregulated in t - all patients when compared to control thymic subsets ( figure 1 ) .
to validate the downregulation of wnt5a detected in expression array analysis , quantitative mrna expression of wnt5a was assessed by qrt - pcr for all patients' samples .
the expression of wnt5a was found to be downregulated both in b - all and t - all patients when compared to specific control cell populations ( figure 2a ) , but only in t - all was the difference statistically significant ( p = 0.007 ) .
among the phenotypic groups , wnt5a mrna levels were lower in t - all patients than b - all patients and the difference was statistically significant ( figure 2b , p < 0.0001 ) .
wnt5a promoter is heavily methylated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients according to ms - pcr results , in total 84 % of the all patients were methylated for the wnt5a promoter region ( figure 3 ) .
among the analyzed cell lines , fleb14 - 4 , molt4 , jurkat , and t - all1 were determined as methylated for the wnt5a promoter region and the results were also confirmed by bisulphate sequencing , both in patients and cell lines ( supplemental figure 1 ) .
to determine the effect of this methylated region on wnt5a transcription , we treated cell lines that were also methylated for the wnt5a promoter with aza .
in the rpmi 8402 cell line 10 mm ( figures 4a and 4c , p = 0.0002 ) and in the jurkat cell line 5 mm ( figures 4b and 4d , p = 0.004 ) concentrations of aza were able to demethylate the wnt5a promoter region and the wnt5a mrna levels were increased after treatment , which shows that the studied region regulates wnt5a transcription .
clinical implications of wnt5a methylation the relations between wnt5a promoter methylation and clinical findings like age ( p = 0.50 ) , sex ( p = 0.8 ) , white blood cell count at the time of diagnosis ( p = 0.55 ) , and immunophenotype ( p = 0.72 ) were analyzed and no statistical significance was detected ; the results are summarized in table 1 .
the kaplan - meier estimate of probability both for overall ( p = 0.31 ) and event - free ( p = 0.36 ) survival according to wnt5a methylation status showed no significant difference ( figures 5a and 5b , respectively ) .
multivariate regression analysis revealed no significant association between clinical features and wnt5a promoter methylation .
discussion wnt5a is one of the most studied noncanonical wnt ligands and it has shown to be expressed both in normal b and t cells [ 7,12 ] .
wnt5a is found overexpressed in different solid tumors , such as in lung cancer , prostate cancer , metastatic carcinomas , and squamous head and neck carcinomas [ 13,14 ] .
wnt5a was also described as a potential tumor suppressor gene , able to prevent and reverse tumor genesis [ 7,15 ] .
however , like in endometrial carcinomas , wnt5a mrna expression was downregulated in some malignant tumors [ 16,17 ] and types of leukemia [ 18,19,20 ] .
one of the most well - known mechanisms for downregulation of a gene is epigenetic modification , such as promoter hypermethylation .
wnt5a is silenced in most colorectal cancer cell lines and nasal nk / t - cell lymphoma due to promoter methylation [ 21 ] .
multistep deregulation of the wnt pathway was previously shown in childhood all by others and by our group [ 7,9,18 ] .
in this study , we detected downregulation of wnt5a gene expression in t - all samples by microarray and confirmed decreased mrna levels by real - time pcr both in b - all and t - all patients .
the downregulation was more dramatic in t - all than b - all patients that had approximately 4 - fold higher wnt5a mrna levels .
we then showed that downregulation of wnt5a expression is caused by promoter hypermethylation , which was previously described by gomez et al. , although their methylation rates were not as high as in our study [ 20 ] .
this difference may be due to the primer regions that were selected .
in this study , the primers were designed from the wnt5a proximal promoter , which resides within 631 bp upstream of the major transcription start site that was shown to have the strongest promoter activity [ 22 ] .
the direct effect of the methylated region on transcription was confirmed by 5 ' - aza treatment , and when the methylation was undone , wnt5a expression was restored .
deng et al. also showed downregulation of wnt5a mrna expression caused by promoter methylation , and it was restored in complete remission samples [ 23 ] .
some demethylating agents are also used in chemotherapy protocols and this may be the reason for loss of methylation in remission patients .
the lack of remission samples limits our study as we could not detect the methylation status of remission samples , but we can speculate that the loss of wnt5a may cause leukemogenesis and methylation restoration might help complete remission in patients with leukemia .
hypermethylation of wnt5a has been reported previously both in t - all and b - all , but without any significant differences between the lineages .
wnt5a was shown to be essential for normal t - cell development and the thymocytes of wnt5a knockout mice could rescue them from apoptosis [ 18 ] , whereas the same effect could not be detected for b cells [ 7 ]. that result shows a role for noncanonical wnt signaling in cell death and t - cell homeostasis .
our results are in concordance with this finding , showing that the noncanonical pathway is downregulated specifically in t - all but not in b - all .
this downregulation may cause the thymocytes to escape apoptosis and take part in leukemia development in our t - all cohort .
topol et al. showed that even low levels of wnt5a were able to reduce canonical wnt signaling via degradation of beta - catenin , independent of gsk - 3beta activity [ 24 ] .
in conclusion , we have demonstrated that wnt5a , an important member of the noncanonical wnt pathway , was silenced by hypermethylation in all .
we have also shown that this methylation has a direct effect on gene expression , which may reveal that wnt5a can be used as a specific marker to reverse leukemic development .

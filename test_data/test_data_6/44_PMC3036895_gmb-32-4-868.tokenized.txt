catfishes of the genus pseudoplatystoma are very important species due to both their high commercial value and their ecological role as voracious predators .
they undertake lengthy migratory movements during their life - cycle , this including reproductive migration which occurs from october to december in the rainy season .
in the present study , seven microsatellite loci were analyzed to access genetic variability in two samples of p. reticulatum from the upper paraguay basin .
the loci were highly polymorphic ( mean = 7.28 ) .
according to all analysis , the two samples of p. reticulatum revealed pronounced genetic differentiation .
fst value was 0.2290 , rst value 0.1067 and amova 22.90 % ( fst ) and 10.67 % ( rst ) , all being highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) .
the division of the fishes into two groups was confirmed by microsatellite multi - locus bayesian assignment testing .
the results obtained present evidence of genetic structuring in a p. reticulatum population .
fish population genetics microsatellite homing population structure catfishes of the genus pseudoplatystoma belong to the family pimelodidae , the 93 species of which occurring in the major river basins of south america ( ferraris , 2007 ) .
they are migratory species of high commercial value , besides playing an important ecological role in the basins where they occur , due to their predatory behavior ( sato et al. , 1988 ; miranda , 1997 ) .
the upriver migratory movement for reproduction usually occurs from october to december ( resende , 2003 ) .
almost all the stocks of these giant catfishes had declined in the last years ( barthem and goulding , 2007 ) .
the loss of biodiversity in aquatic environments is one among the most serious problems faced by countries all over the world ( moyle and leidy , 1992 ) , compromising the ecosystem functioning as a whole .
the conservation of these ecosystems is vital for various economical sectors in many countries ( ehrlich and ehrlich , 1992 ) .
according to allan and flecker ( 1993 ) , several factors have been identified as causing the decline of fish diversity in several aquatic ecosystems , such as the introduction of exotic species , industrialization , urbanization , destruction of forests and riparian vegetation , pollution by pesticides and gold mining camps , and the construction of physical barriers for the generation of electricity .
the pantanal area is located at the upper paraguay river basin , with a drainage basin extending from the border between brazil and paraguay up to the limits of the amazon river basin , and covering about 140,000 km2 ( vila da silva , 1995 ) .
in the pantanal , fisheries constitute the second activity in economic importance .
furthermore , and apart from their ecological importance , fish resources are fundamental for subsistence , amateur , professional and sports fisheries , and the transaction of native crafts ( catella , 2003 ) .
microsatellite markers have been extensively used in studies on the genetics of fish populations .
these markers have a co - dominant inheritance pattern , a high degree of polymorphism , and allow for easy analysis through experiments involving the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) ( wright and bentzen , 1994 ; triantafyllidis et al. , 2002 ; salgueiro et al. , 2003 ; barroso et al. , 2005 ; makinen et al. , 2006 ) .
studies using microsatellites have revealed pronounced genetic differences even among populations isolated by short geographic distances ( koskinen et al. , 2002 ) .
in this study , we analyzed two natural populations of pseudoplatystoma reticulatum (" cachara ") collected in the upper paraguay river basin , by using seven microsatellite loci originally developed for p. corruscans to access the genetic diversity of these samples .
these data can be used as subsidies for setting up management policies for the development and conservation of these species .
a total of 52 adult specimens of p. reticulatum were caught by gill nets at two points on the paraguay river basin .
31 specimens were collected from the paraguay river ( prp ) ( 16degrees 04 ' 00 " s 57degrees 41 ' 00 " w ) and 21 from the jauru river ( prj ) ( 15degrees 51 ' 00 " s 58degrees 27 ' 00 " w ) .
fin clips were the source of nuclear dna .
these were collected from freshly caught fish and immediately preserved in 95 % ethanol .
after collection , the fishes were sold .
for the extraction of genomic dna , about 0.1 mg of tissue was incubated in 200 mul of 5 % chelex ( sigma ( r )) at 65 degreesc overnight .
the p. reticulatum samples were screened for variation at each of the seven microsatellite loci .
five of these loci have already been described by revaldaves et al .
( 2005 ) ( pcor01 , pcor05 , pcor08 , pcor10 , and pcor21 ) , and two by pereira et al .
( 2009 ) ( pcor23 and pcor28 ) .
pcr amplification reactions were conducted in a thermocycler ptc - 100 ( mj research ) with a final volume of 12.5 mul , consisting of about 10 ng of dna , 0.25 mum of each primer , 0.2 mm of dntp , 1.2 mm of mgcl2 , 0.2 u of taq - pht dna polymerase , 1x pcr buffer ( 50 mm kcl , 10 mm tris - hcl , 0.1 % triton x - 100 , and 1.5 mm mgcl2 ) and water .
we used the following pcr profile for the loci pcor01 , pcor02 , pcor05 , pcor08 , pcor21 , pcor23 and pcor28 : initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 5 min , 30 cycles of 10 s at 95 degreesc , 15 s at an annealing temperature of 55 degreesc , 15 s at 72 degreesc and a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
for the locus pcor10 , the pcr profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 5 min , 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 degreesc , 30 s at an annealing temperature of 48 degreesc , 30 s at 72 degreesc and a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
amplified products were resolved on 6 % polyacrylamide gels stained with silver nitrate .
microsatellite alleles were identified by their size in base - pairs .
allele lengths were estimated by comparison with a 10 bp ladder ( 10 pb dna ladder - invitrogen ) , using kodak digital science 1d software .
allelic count , expected and observed heterozygosity ( he , ho ) , inbreeding coefficient ( fis ) and gene flow ( nm = 0.25 ( 1 - fst )/ fst ) were obtained with popgen 1.32 software ( yeh and boyle , 1997 ) .
allelic richness and nei gene diversity were obtained with fstat v2.9.3 software ( goudet , 2001 ) .
deviation from hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) was tested with the genepop 3.3 package ( raymond and rousset , 1995 ) .
micro - checker 2.2.1 ( van oosterhout et al. , 2004 ) software was used to infer the most probable cause of hwe departures .
in order to investigate the genetic structure in samples of p. reticulatum , fst ( weir and cockerham , 1984 ) indices , assuming the infinite allele model ( iam ) , and rst ( slatkin , 1995 ) , which assumes the stepwise mutation model ( smm ) , were calculated for all loci using arlequin 3.11 ( excoffier et al. , 2005 ) .
their significance estimates were based on 1,000 permutations .
analysis of molecular variance ( amova ) ( excoffier et al. , 1992 ) , incorporated in arlequin 3.11 ( excoffier et al. , 2005 ) , was used to check the partition of variance among and within populations .
these analyses were carried out with both distance indexes ( fst and rst ) , and their significance was tested with 1,000 permutations .
corrections of the significance level for multiple tests were performed following the bonferroni procedure ( rice , 1989 ) .
the frequency of private alleles was obtained manually , observing the distribution of alleles in each locus for two analyzed populations .
bayesian clustering was also used to assess population relatedness by means of the structure 2.2 ( pritchard et al. , 2000 ) program .
the number of populations ( k ) was estimated by using the ' no admixture ' ancestral model with correlated alleles , thereby allowing for maximal population resolution , with k ranging from 1 to 6 .
three independent runs of 500,000 markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) generations and 100,000 generations of ' burn - in ' were used for each value of k. the true number of populations is expected to be the value of k that maximizes the estimated model log - likelihood , log ( p ( x | k )) ( falush et al. , 2003 ) .
the number of alleles per polymorphic locus ranged from two ( pcor10 , pcor21 , pcor23 and pcor28 ) to 11 ( pcor08 ) , and allelic richness from 1.722 ( pcor28 ) to 9.503 ( pcor08 ) ( table 1 ) .
nei gene diversity ranged from 0.056 ( pcor28 ) to 0.870 ( pcor01 ) .
a total of 51 alleles were detected , of which 26 were private ( table 2 ) .
the private alleles showed frequencies ranging from 0.0167 ( six alleles ) to 0.3333 ( one allele ) ( table 2 ) .
expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.0556 ( pcor28 - prj ) to 0.8615 ( pcor01 - prj ) and from 0.0556 ( pcor28 - prj ) to 0.5556 ( pcor08 - prj and prp ) , respectively ( table 1 ) .
significant departures from hwe ( p < 0.025 adjusted according to bonferroni correction ) were detected at the population level for seven loci ( table 1 ) .
the occurrence of genotyping errors due to null alleles , stuttering or large allele drop - out were checked with the micro - checker program .
significant values were , however , not found due to stuttering or large allele drop - out .
estimates of the occurrence of null alleles revealed positive values for all cases in which departure from hwe was identified .
the fis index suggested the existence of heterozygote deficiency in eight out of 14 comparisons in the populations analyzed ( table 1 ) .
genetic differentiation between the two populations of p. reticulatum , estimated through the fst index for all the loci , was 0.2290 and was statistically highly significant ( p < 0.025 , after bonferroni correction ) , thereby showing the existence of strong genetic differentiation among the analyzed samples .
the rst index estimated for all the loci was 0.1067 , which was also statistically highly significant ( p < 0.025 , after bonferroni correction ) .
individual multi - locus genotypes were used to assign individuals to their respective population of origin .
on considering the correct assignment of all individuals , 98.3 % were correctly assigned to the prp population and 99.1 % to the prj population .
hierarchical amova revealed that most total genetic variance was to be found within populations fst = 77.10 % and rst = 89.33 % .
the values for variability between populations were fst = 22.90 % and rst = 10.67 % .
these were highly significant ( p < 0.0001 ) , thus revealing the strong structure of p. reticulatum populations .
structure analysis without admixture inferred that the two populations were genetically distinct , with k = 2 populations maximizing the estimated log likelihood in the model ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the value of gene flow parameter nm was calculated from the mean fst value .
the mean value obtained was nm = 0.8417 , indicating that some gene exchange had occurred among the sampled populations .
the microsatellites displayed a high degree of polymorphism ( mean = 7.28 ) , consistent with the mean number observed in other fish species ( dewoody and avise , 2000 ) .
however , pereira et al .
( 2009 ) found a mean number of 15.28 alleles in six populations of p. corruscans .
a significant deviation of hwe ( p < 0.05 ) was observed in seven loci within two samples analyzed ( table 1 ) .
hwe departure is , however , common with microsatellites ( alam and islam , 2005 ; carreras - carbonell et al. , 2006 ; chevolot et al. , 2006 ) .
five potential causes may induce such a phenomenon in a given population : ( i ) the high number of alleles per locus , ( ii ) technical artifacts , such as the occurrence of null alleles , stuttering or large allele drop - out , ( iii ) the wahlund effect , ( iv ) the selection of specific alleles , and ( v ) inbreeding ( hoarau et al. , 2002 ; pereira et al. , 2009 ) .
estimates of the occurrence of null alleles revealed positive values for all cases in which hwe departure was identified ( table 1 ) .
the occurrence of null alleles is a common problem in the study of microsatellites , and may be explained by the low efficiency of the primer hybridization used to amplify some loci , due to point mutation in one or more annealing sites of these primers ( callen et al. , 1993 ; oconnell and wright , 1997 ; dakin and avise , 2004 ) , besides the possible differential amplification of alleles with different sizes ( wattier et al. , 1998 ) .
the inbreeding coefficient fis was calculated for all loci .
the results acquired displayed significant departure from hwe ( table 1 ) , thereby showing heterozygote shortage .
these data show that inbreeding could be one possible cause for hwe departure .
however , the cases that revealed hwe departure were those in which loci showed the largest number of alleles ( table 1 ) .
we therefore believe that the null allele hypothesis is that which best explains hwe departure .
there was significant populational structuring between the two samples of p. reticulatum analyzed , as demonstrated through the different tests employed in this study .
the fst and rst index observed between populations of p. reticulatum showed high ( 0.2290 ) and moderate ( 0.1067 ) values , respectively ( p < 0.025 ) , thus suggesting there is a strong genetic structure .
the differences of values between indices were probably due to differences in the mutation models on which they were based .
while fst is based on iam , rst is based on smm .
the rst index may be the best for microsatellite analysis , and it is expected that rst values under a strict smm pattern would be higher than those of fst ( slatkin , 1995 ) .
however , as can be seen from our results , fst values were higher than rst .
this may be explained by the fact that probably not all microsatellite loci evolve strictly in accordance to a smm model ( balloux and lugon - moulin , 2002 ) .
this presupposes that mutations occur by the addition or subtraction of a single repetition unit in the microsatellite immediately anterior or posterior to a known and highly related mutation .
departure from this strict smm pattern would result in the inferior performance of rst in relation to fst ( slatkin , 1995 , balloux et al. , 2000 ) .
departure from the smm model observed in the present study may be related to the fact that in three of our eight loci repetitions were imperfect ( pcor01 - ( tc ) 9gc ( tc ) 9 - ; pcor05 - ( tc ) 8cc ( tc ) 15 - and pcor10 - ( gtcg ) 15 ( gt ) 9 ( cc - ) .
the results obtained through amova analysis revealed the occurrence of significant differentiation between populations of p. reticulatum on using both indices ( fst and rst ) , thereby depicting the occurrence of strong genetic structuring .
the values of molecular variation among populations were 22.90 % ( fst ) and 10.67 % ( rst ) , both with highly significant p values ( p < 0.0001 ). through structure analysis without admixture , it was shown that both populations were genetically distinct , with k = 2 populations maximizing the estimated log - likelihood in the model ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the genetic flow of all loci in the two populations was estimated as nm = 0.8417 migrants per generation .
according to nei ( 1987 ) , nm values above 1 suggest that genetic flow constitutes a positive factor against genetic differentiation among populations ( spieth , 1974 ) .
thus , our data showed that genetic flow between the two populations analyzed did not exist or was very low , thereby reinforcing the hypothesis of genetic structure .
the results obtained in the assignment tests were extremely positive , as described in the literature for other fish groups ( triantafyllidis et al. , 2002 ) .
in the present study involving seven microsatellites ( fst = 0.2290 ) , 98.3 % and 99.1 % of the individuals were correctly assigned to the location from which they were sampled ( prp and prj , respectively ) .
these results are consistent with the values found by pereira et al .
( 2009 ) when analyzing six p. corruscans populations ( values ranging from 93.6 % to 98.2 %) .
cornuet et al .
( 1999 ) showed by simulations that 100 % correct assignments can be achieved through the bayesian method with as few as 10 microsatellite loci and 10 individuals sampled per population , when populations are sufficiently diverged ( fst ~ 0.1 ) .

points are averages of three independent runs of 100,000 generations of ' burn - in ' followed by 500,000 mcmc generations .
twenty - six private alleles were found in the two populations of p. reticulatum analyzed .
in five of these , frequency was higher than 10 % ( table 2 ) .
the existence of private alleles places in evidence the absence of gene flow , or at least that it is at a minimum and frequently present in structured populations .
thus , these data reinforce the existence of firm structuring in the p. reticulatum analyzed .
furthermore , all the tests employed confirmed the strong structure in these populations .
thus , our work renders preliminary evidence of the genetic structure in p. reticulatum .
as the results presented are consistent with those obtained for p. corruscans ( pereira et al. , 2009 ) and , on considering the similar behavior between these two species , we suggest that p. reticulatum also presents homing behavior .
the ability to identify and define biological populations is crucial for taking informed decisions concerning conservation and management ( waples and gaggiotti , 2006 ) .
considering the ecological and economic importance of p. reticulatum , the present data constitute a particularly important element when contemplating their management and conservation .
it also places in evidence , the importance of preserving each population to further a positive outcome in the genetic conservation of these species .

the effects of silicon ( si ) amendment have been studied in several plant / pathogen interactions ; however , studies in horticultural tree crops are limited .
effects of amendment with soluble potassium silicate ( agsil ( r ) 32 , approximately 30 % available si ) , or milled cement building board by - products ( mineral mulch ( mm ) or mineral dust ( md ) , containing 5 % available si ) were investigated in field and greenhouse trials with avocado .
orchard soil drench applications with potassium silicate improved yield and quality of fruit , but visual health of trees declining from phytophthora root rot ( prr ) was not affected .
orchard spray or trunk injection applications with potassium silicate were ineffective .
amendment of potting mix with mm and md reduced root necrosis of avocado seedlings after inoculation with calonectria ilicicola , an aggressive soilborne pathogen causing black root rot .
application of mm to mature orchard trees declining with prr had a beneficial effect on visual tree health , and si accumulation in leaves and fruit peel , after only 10 months .
products that deliver available si consistently for uptake are likely to be most successful in perennial tree crops .
phytophthora potassium silicate available silicon anthracnose stem end rot 1 .
introduction silicon ( si ) has been shown to reduce disease and increase plant growth in a number of agricultural crops , predominantly cereal grains and dicotyledonous annual crops such as cucumber and tomato , and the topic has been recently reviewed [ 1,2 ] .
likely mechanisms include formation of physical barriers to pathogen ingress , activation of biochemical plant defenses , and influence on absorption of essential nutrients .
the benefits of si amendment for ameliorating toxicities and abiotic stresses is also well established [ 3 ] , which may also influence plant health and disease suppression , although those interactions have not been thoroughly investigated .
the reports concerning effects of amendment with soluble si to horticultural tree crops is still scarce .
field or soil applications of various formulations and concentrations of si to mango , citrus or apple reduce diseases caused by bacterial [ 4,5 ] or fungal pathogens [ 6,7,8,9 ] ; enhance resistance to insect pests [ 10 ] and physiological disorders [ 11 ] ; and increase yield [ 7 ] , fruit size [ 12 ] , and biomass [ 13 ] .
reports of si amendment in avocado primarily concern effects on fruit quality including postharvest physiology and anthracnose disease , caused by colletotrichum spp. and health of trees affected by phytophthora root rot ( prr ) , caused by phytophthora cinnamomi ( pc ) .
many of these reports have not been published in the mainstream literature , thus are reviewed in detail below .
studies undertaken in 2004 provided the first indication that soluble si , applied as trunk injections ( common in avocado for the delivery of phosphonate to protect roots from prr ) , could reduce anthracnose development as fruit ripen after harvest .
" hass " avocado trees carrying crops of developing fruit were injected with approximately 60 ml of 1000 ppm potassium silicate , and fruit harvested for quality assessments 2 , 8 and 12 weeks later .
there was no significant difference in anthracnose disease when harvested two weeks after injection treatment , however , anthracnose was significantly reduced by si injection compared with controls when fruit were harvested and ripened at the later harvests , with 80 % reduction in severity , and increased shelf life , recorded in fruit harvested two months after si injection treatment [ 14 ] .
a subsequent study confirmed that injecting with 1000 or 2000 ppm potassium silicate during early fruit development ( 28 weeks prior to harvest ) , or 12 weeks prior to harvest , reduced anthracnose development compared with untreated controls by at least 40 % .
treatment with 1000 ppm during fruit development and 2000 ppm 12 weeks prior to harvest had greater than 60 % reduction in fruit anthracnose which was significantly less than that recorded in fruit from untreated trees .
interestingly , 1000 ppm injected at each of the treatment times did not significantly reduce anthracnose , and there was no effect on stem end rot disease in fruit [ 15 ] .
five orchard sprays at intervals of approximately six weeks throughout fruit development with 1000 ppm potassium silicate were not effective at reducing postharvest disease or improving marketability of " hass " avocado fruit , compared with industry standard fungicide applications [ 16 ] .
the effects of si soil drench applications in orchards , or as post - harvest applications , on avocado fruit physiology and accumulation of si have been assessed .
soil drench applications ( concentrations not reported ) in - field during fruit development had no effect on accumulation of si in the exocarp and mesocarp of fruit , or on co2 production in ripe fruit [ 17 ] .
however , dipping harvested fruit into high concentrations (< 2500 ppm ) of potassium silicate suppressed respiration ( reduced co2 ) and ethylene production .
energy dispersive x - ray analyses demonstrated that si accumulated in the exocarp of such fruit approximately 14 % wt , with < 1 % in the mesocarp .
although no data were presented , the authors stated that none of the si treatments affected anthracnose disease in fruit , and thus concluded that , despite the suppression of ripening parameters , an enhanced shelf life was not achieved because of the severity of postharvest disease [ 17 ] .
similarly , there was no significant difference in anthracnose upon ripening when harvested fruit were dipped in 1000 ppm potassium silicate , compared with untreated control fruit , although there was an indication of enhanced defense enzyme activity [ 18 ] .
tesfay et al .
[ 19 ] reported the potential of potassium silicate postharvest treatment to improve avocado fruit quality via maintenance of fruit moisture , increased catalase enzyme activity , and increased accumulation of phenolic compounds .
in preliminary greenhouse tests with one - month - old avocado seedlings , several si products , including potassium silicate ) , calcium silicate ( wollastonite ) and magnesium silicate were not as effective at reducing root necrosis caused by pc as phosphonate , a standard treatment for prr [ 20 ] .
there were some indications of root health improvement following some treatments , but effects were inconsistent .
conversely , greenhouse tests undertaken in south africa with advanced nursery stock ( 12 - 18 months old ) showed that one soil drench application of potassium silicate before and four applications after inoculation with pc resulted in significantly healthier root systems than inoculated control plants , and were comparable to those treated with phosphonate , in two of four experiments [ 21 ] .
root mass and new root growth was increased by si , suggesting that si may stimulate root growth and fortification under high pc disease pressure .
a single si soil drench application a day prior to inoculation was not effective at reducing root necrosis , and the authors suggested that for effective disease suppression , plant - available si should be applied continuously , due to the rapid polymerization of soluble si. a day was most likely not sufficient time for si to be translocated and deposited and for defenses to pathogen infection to be activated .
effects of soil drench applications on canopy health and root densities were assessed in an orchard trial with mature trees .
twenty liters per tree of potassium silicate , 20 ml / l ( approximately 4000 ppm ) , was applied once , twice or three times at four monthly intervals , in the first year , and repeated in year 2 .
two or three applications resulted in significantly healthier canopies , compared with untreated trees , which declined in health over time [ 22,23 ] .
the trees receiving two or three si treatments per year had the highest root densities ( determined by image analyses of 0.5 m2 soil surface area of each tree ) , compared with controls or those receiving industry standard injections with phosphonate , suggesting that si may aid in the regeneration of roots in prr - compromised trees .
one or two soil drench applications with si reduced tree yields , however , three applications increased yields .
the authors suggested that the optimal timing of applications was during flowering / fruit set , before fruit drop , and prior to the summer root flush , however the timing of applications should be determined by soil structure as si leaches easily , i.e. , sandy soil will require more regular applications .
there were inconsistent effects against postharvest diseases ( anthracnose and stem end rot ) and physiological disorders of fruit .
stem injections of si did not improve tree health or increase root growth [ 23 ] .
there was an indication of increased leaf boron uptake in si treated trees , but no consistent effect on leaf or root si content [ 23 ] .
dixon et al .
[ 24 ] applied sodium metasilicate as a soil drench ( delivering 100 or 200 ppm a.i. soluble si ) , to avocado trees in severe decline due to prr , and assessed tree health 6 and 13 months later .
the single application did not significantly improve tree health at the final assessment ; however , there was a slight improvement in trees treated with the higher rate .
root health was improved at six months compared with untreated controls , and the authors concluded that multiple applications may have been more effective .
phytophthora root rot remains the key challenge to orchard productivity for avocado growers in australia , particularly in the eastern tropical and sub - tropical regions which have encountered high rainfall in recent years , favoring this root disease .
prr has significantly impacted productivity at orchard and whole - industry level due to tree decline and death , an abundance of small fruit which can be difficult to market , and poorer quality fruit from prr affected trees [ 25 ] .
the nectriaceous soilborne fungi calonectria ilicicola and dactylonectria spp. are common nursery pathogens infecting roots and may cause tree deaths with 12 months of planting [ 26,27 ] .
the most problematic fruit diseases are anthracnose , caused by colletotrichum spp. and stem end rots , caused by colletotrichum spp. , and / or fungi in the family botryosphaeriaceae [ 25 ] .
currently , orchard management includes a range of cultural and chemical practices , such as optimized drainage , irrigation and fertilizer regimes , mulching and targeted sprays with fungicides for fruit disease and injections with phosphonate for prr .
it is wise for the industry to remain open - minded about alternative or complementary management options .
the successful management of pests and diseases will rely on an integrated approach , which utilizes as many cultural , chemical and agronomic options as possible .
the aim of the current research was to investigate effects of two products with high available si contents , for their effects on avocado canopy health , fruit quality and accumulation of si. greenhouse trials were undertaken over 3 - 4 months where treated seedlings were inoculated with root pathogens calonectria ilicicola or phytophthora cinnamomi .
trials at several sites were conducted over 2 - 3 years in established orchards where trees were declining due to prr .
potassium silicate ( sio2 / k2o ) , for example agsil ( r ) 32 ( pq australia p / l ) , has been available for many years , and has been used in many of the studies described above .
mineral mulch ( mm ) and mineral dust ( md ) are cement building board by - products available commercially in australia from shiftwaste p / l since 2014 .
research with mm to date has concentrated on sugarcane , a si accumulator , where yield increases of up to 16 % above untreated controls have been recorded after its application [ 28 ] .
anecdotal data also showed positive response of capsicum and macadamia to mm ; however , neither mm nor md have been evaluated in avocado .
trials in commercial orchards over multiple years are essential , where assessments of yield , tree health , fruit quality and packout data are critical for determining the role of such amendments in improving orchard productivity .
2. results 2.1 .
field trials with agsil 32 ( 2014 - 2016 ) trials were conducted on - farm at childers , goodwood , beechmont ( qld ) and comboyne ( nsw ) .
at site 1 , childers , there were no significant effects on tree health of agsil drench applications ( 5000 ppm solution of si delivered in 20 l water per tree on three occasions annually ) eight months to two years after the initiation of the trial ( table 1 ) .
in april 2015 , one year after commencement of the trial , images of root growth within the " windows " placed under each tree were captured , and analyzed with winrhizo software .
there were no significant differences in root lengths , area or diameter between the trees treated with agsil drench vs. non - drenched trees ( data not shown ) .
yields were recorded mid - way through the trial in july 2015 when yields from agsil drenched trees were not significantly different compared with non - drenched trees ( table 1 ) .
single bins of fruit from each treatment were run through a commercial packingshed ( hence no statistical analysis was possible ) .
there were small increases in the percentage of fruit in premium grade and total percent packouts from the agsil drench treated trees , however , there was a 40 % increase in 2nd grade fruit ( and decrease in 3rd grade fruit ) from agsil - drenched trees compared with non - drenched trees ( table 2 ) .
the trial at site 2 , goodwood , ( qld ) , consisted of two rows of trees treated with agsil drench ( 5000 ppm si per tree delivered in 20 l water ) in two separate blocks , with untreated rows either side assessed as the untreated controls .
agsil did not consistently improve tree health compared with untreated trees at any time point , however tree yields from agsil drenched trees were approximately 13 % and 39 % higher than trees in the untreated rows for the two blocks ( data not presented ) .
treatments to trees at site 3 , beechmont , ( qld ) , were undertaken by project staff , ( not the orchard operator ) , and included agsil soil drenches ( 5000 ppm solution of si delivered in 20 l water per tree ) , foliar spray ( 3300 ppm solution of si delivered in 5 l water per tree ) and trunk injection ( 3000 ppm solution of si delivered in 5 x 20 ml injection sites per tree ) .
tree health was not significantly affected by agsil treatment at any of the assessment dates between may 2014 and august 2016 ( table 3 ) .
a tray of fruit from each trial tree was harvested at commercial maturity in 2015 and 2016 and assessed for postharvest disease .
there were no significant differences in severity or incidence of anthracnose among treatments in either 2015 or 2016 , however fruit from trees sprayed or drenched with agsil had significantly less severe stem end rot than those that were injected in 2015 ( table 4 ) .
there were no significant effects of agsil on stem end rot in 2016 ( table 5 ) .
agsil was applied six times to selected trees in the trial at site 4 , comboyne , ( nsw ) , between august 2014 and june 2016 .
health of agsil drenched trees had improved by the final assessment compared with untreated controls , but the effect was not statistically significant ( table 6 ) .
however , estimated yield was 14 % higher for the agsil drenched trees ( table 6 ) .
one bin of fruit from each treatment was transported to a commercial packingshed to obtain packout data .
while the percentage of fruit in the premium grade was similar for fruit from the two treatments , there were more 2nd grade from agsil treated trees than from untreated controls ( table 7 ) .
2.2 .
greenhouse trials with mineral mulch and mineral dust 2.2.1 .
experiment 1 twenty - eight days after inoculation with c. ilicicola ( ci ) , seedlings were significantly shorter and had reduced leaf / stem and root biomass , and a greater proportion of necrotic roots , compared with those which were uninoculated ( table 8 ) .
there was no significant effect of md treatment on plant height , compared with plants which did not receive md amendment .
there were indications of a md effect amongst the uninoculated treatments , where the healthiest roots ( least necrosis ) were from seedlings receiving 2 g md , and were significantly healthier than those receiving 6 g md ( table 8 ) .
si concentration in leaves and roots of seedlings treated with 2 g and 6 g md were not significantly different from those receiving no md ( figure 1 ) .
2.2.2 .
experiment 2 the treatments for the second experiment were modified to replace 6 g md treatment with 2 g mm. there was a significant effect of ci reducing plant height over the four - week duration of the experiment , although not as severely as in experiment 1 .
there were no significant differences in seedling growth among treatments when comparing respective inoculated and uninoculated seedlings ( table 9 ) .
leaf and stem and root biomass ( fw and dw ) were not significantly reduced by fungal inoculation within treatment comparisons ( table 9 ) .
both mm and md significantly reduced the percentage of necrotic roots compared with non - amended seedlings when assessed four weeks after inoculation ( table 9 ) .
inoculation with ci reduced si accumulation in roots compared with respective non - inoculated plants , however , there were no significant differences in si accumulation in leaves or roots of mm or md treated seedlings compared with respective ci - inoculated or uninoculated controls ( figure 2 ) .
2.2.3 .
experiment 3 phytophthora cinnamomi , the oomycete pathogen causing prr , was included as a second inoculation treatment in experiment 3 .
there were significant differences amongst treatments for all measured parameters .
inoculation with either ci or pc significantly reduced seedling growth , root biomass and increased severity of root rot ( table 10 ) , with effects of pc inoculation generally ( but not always statistically ) worse than ci. amendment with either md or mm did not affect plant growth ( height ) , biomass or root necrosis compared with respective uninoculated or inoculated controls .
root necrosis was approximately 16 % or 24 % less severe in plants treated with md or mm , respectively , before inoculation with ci compared with untreated controls , however the difference was not statistically significant ( table 10 ) .
there were no leaf and root nutrient analyses obtained for this experiment .
2.3 .
preliminary field trials with mineral mulch table 11 shows the average tree ( canopy ) health for treated and untreated trees at each site at the date of mm application ( july 2016 ) and at the first assessment ( may 2017 ) .
at the kumbia site , all trees improved in health , irrespective of treatment , and , in may 2017 , there was no significant difference in canopy health between treatments ( table 11 ) .
at kumbia , there were no differences in heights and diameters between trees treated with mm or those which received no treatments ( data not shown ) .
at the goodwood orchard , canopy health in 2016 was significantly worse in the trees selected for mm application than those in adjacent rows selected as the untreated controls ( table 11 ) .
however , 10 months after mm application , the tree health had improved considerably , to be the same as that in untreated trees .
a similar trend was also observed in the childers orchard , where the improvement in tree health over time was more rapid for the mm treated trees than untreated controls ( table 11 ) .
fruit were collected in 2017 for postharvest disease assessments and nutrient analyses .
there were no differences amongst orchards or treatments in the interval between harvest and " eating ripe " stage .
there were significant differences among treatments ( and orchards ) in severity of anthracnose disease , where fruit from kumbia or childers treated with mm , or childers untreated , had significantly more disease than from goodwood , or kumbia untreated ( table 11 ) .
a similar trend was observed in stem end rot .
these results must be viewed with extreme caution , as most trees from kumbia and childers had no fruit , so a composite sample from only a few trees was available for testing .
there were also limited numbers ( replicates ) from each treatment at each site .
the usual practice for fruit assessments is to harvest a full tray of fruit ( 18 - 20 pieces ) from a replicate tree , ensuring at least six replicate trees per treatment .
future trials should include more treated trees and incorporate more robust sampling and replication .
si concentration in leaves and fruit peel was determined , however , it must be noted that statistical analyses were not performed on the data , as there was only one replicate sample for each tissue type and treatment at each site .
si concentration in leaves was higher in mm treated trees at two sites , kumbia and childers , and higher in fruit peel at each site , compared with leaves and peel from untreated control trees ( figure 3 ) .
this provides strong indication that si is taken up by roots in mature orchard trees and translocated and deposited in leaves and fruit peel , within a relatively short time frame ( 10 months ) .
3. discussion the four trials with soluble potassium silicate ( agsil ( r ) 32 ) conducted on growers' orchards highlight the inconsistent effects of agsil under field conditions .
tree health was generally improved in agsil treated trees , but not significantly compared with untreated trees .
in two of the three trials where yields were measured , average yields per tree were 13 - 39 % greater from agsil - drenched trees compared with untreated trees .
fruit quality and packout data demonstrate that , after two years of application , fruit from agsil treated trees had higher proportions of fruit in 2nd grades ( but not premium grade ) , superior quality with reduced stem end rot and defects attributed to pepper spot ( superficial necrotic lesions < 0.5 mm , caused by colletotrichum spp. ) , than fruit from non - drenched trees .
one packingshed estimated the improved quality represented a 20 % increase in net return to the grower , based on prices received at the time of packing .
fruit postharvest evaluations from one trial showed that stem end rot was significantly reduced in the first year of agsil treatment , resulting in a greater proportion of marketable fruit .
anthracnose was not reduced by potassium silicate drench treatments .
previous studies showed the reverse with potassium silicate injection treatments , i.e. , reducing anthracnose but having no effect on stem end rot [ 14,15 ] .
lack of effect of spray applications on disease severity was , however , consistent with a previous study [ 16 ] .
it is possible that more frequent applications of agsil targeted more closely to autumn and spring root flushes , may improve uptake and translocation of available si and hence efficacy .
while the disease - reducing beneficial effects of si applications are most frequently attributed to enhancement of physical barriers to pathogen ingress and activation of plant defense mechanisms , a direct fungicidal effect is also possible , depending of course on the formulation of si and its applied concentration .
soluble potassium silicate ( 20.7 % sio2 ) was tested for its effects on in vitro growth of several phytopathogenic fungi including sclerotinia sclerotiorum , fusarium oxysporum , f. solani , colletotrichum coccodes , a. solani and oomycetes , p. cinnamomi and pythium sp .
[ 30 ] .
concentrations of 5 ml and 10 ml potassium silicate / l agar completely inhibited growth of p. cinnamomi and s. sclerotiorum , however , mycelial growth of f. oxysporum , f. solani and verticillium theobromae was increased compared with controls at these concentrations .
growth was inhibited at the higher concentrations tested , 20 , 40 and 80 ml / l agar [ 30 ] .
potassium silicate amendment increased ph of media , however , mycelial growth of all fungi tested occurred at corresponding high ph ( adjusted with koh ) , demonstrating the fungicidal effect of the potassium silicate solution was not simply due to alkalization of the agar media [ 30 ] .
this information is important when considering field applications .
it would be counterproductive to apply a treatment which enhanced growth of an economically important pathogen rather than suppressing it !
an effect of si on pathogen or other microbial populations ( including beneficial or suppressive microbes ) and diversity in soil has not been reported , but requires further investigation .
there are strong indications that mineral mulch and / or mineral dust amendment to potting mix of greenhouse avocado plants reduces the root necrosis caused by c. ilicicola , the nectriaceous fungus causing black root rot of avocado .
in greenhouse experiment 3 , it is clear that the inoculation with p. cinnamomi and subsequent conditions favouring disease were too severe , and there was little chance of observing treatment effects when seedlings were overwhelmed by the pathogen .
in a fourth greenhouse experiment , there was an indication that treatment with md and mm reduced root necrosis after inoculation with either ci or pc ( data not shown ) .
md reduced necrosis by approximately 30 % and 18 % , while mm reduced necrosis by approximately 19 % and 9 % , compared with ci or pc inoculated controls , respectively .
this was also observed for md and mm in ci inoculated plants , in experiments 2 and 3 , where md appeared to be more effective at reducing necrosis than mm. however , the higher rate , 6 g , of md applied in greenhouse experiment 1 , was likely to have been too high , and resulted in less healthy ( lower biomass and more necrosis ) than those treated with 2 g. perhaps 6 g md was too much in a short timeframe and overwhelmed plant defense responses .
it is possible that the smaller particle size of md contributed to faster nutrient uptake and defense responses than mm , but this requires further investigation , and supports the idea of a combined md + mm treatment compared with md and mm alone , in planned field trial investigations .
si accumulation in roots and leaves were measured in dried tissue from two greenhouse experiments .
amendment with md or mm enhanced accumulation by around 30 % in roots compared with untreated controls ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .
however , smaller increases ( 7 - 18 %) in leaf si accumulation were observed in experiment 1 , while concentration actually decreased compared with untreated controls in experiment 2 .
in preliminary field trials with mm , application at approximately 2 t / ha had a beneficial effect on tree health at two sites , and si accumulation in leaves and fruit peel , after only 10 months .
some larger particles of mm were still clearly visible underneath trees at each site , and may provide a consistent and sustained delivery of si over a period of time .
these preliminary results are extremely promising and warrant further replicated field trials , with suggested treatments of mm at 2 and 4 t / ha and a combined mm and md application .
md may provide a rapid delivery of si , while the larger particle size of mm ensures release over several months .
canopy health as well as fruit yields and quality , and nutrient analyses will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of mm applications in commercial avocado orchards .
comprehensive soil testing , including microbial and chemical ( nutrient , ph , ec ) analyses would also be desirable .
future trials should evaluate treatments applied to whole rows ( e.g. , 30 trees ) , compared with grower standard treatment , at different orchards across australia ( for replication ) , and across at least three years .
whole - row treatments can be assessed for productivity ( yield ) as well as commercial packout and quality .
this approach would give more meaningful and realistic outputs .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .
field trials with agsil32 agsil ( r ) 32 is a soluble potassium silicate product from pq australia pty .
ltd. , and contains 32 % w / v sio2 and 21 % w / v k2o .
field trial sites were conducted at 4 locations between central queensland and the mid new south wales coast to assess the effect of potassium silicate on tree health and productivity by reducing prr .
each site was visited between april and june 2014 to establish trial sites , establish baseline tree health and establish communication links with growers for potassium silicate application and ongoing management .
grower collaborators were responsible for agsil applications at three sites ( all drench applications ) , and the pathology team independently conducted the 4th trial on an orchard at beechmont , qld .
the selected trial sites enabled evaluation of the potential for potassium silicate application to manage prr across 3 growing regions , with unique orchard management activities at each site .
agsil was applied as a drench at 300 ml / tree delivered in 20 l ( 5000 ppm solution of si delivered in 20 l water per tree ) , to the active root zone .
application was planned to coincide with periods of active root flush ( autumn and summer ) , however , frequency and timing varied across sites for a number of reasons .
tree canopy health was determined at each site visit by visual assessment according to a widely - used rating scale [ 29 ] .
fruit yields were collected from sites 1 and 2 in 2015 , and site 4 in 2016 .
additionally , commercial packout data were obtained for fruit from site 1 in 2015 and site 4 in 2016 .
fruit was harvested from trees in the fully replicated trial at site 3 in 2015 and 2016 , ripened and assessed for development of postharvest anthracnose and stem end rot .
site 1 ( childers , qld ) : the entire orchard is currently treated with a low dose of potassium silicate on a monthly basis by fertigation .
sick / declining trees were treated at a high " treatment " rate of 300 ml agsil per tree ( 5000 ppm solution of si delivered in 20 l water per tree ) on 3 occasions annually .
given the entire orchard currently receives agsil , this trial was set up to examine the effects of withdrawing agsil treatment from selected trees with obvious signs of decline due to prr .
a total of 22 trees were selected for monitoring over the duration of the trial , with 11 of these clearly identified for agsil treatment withdrawal .
at the trial initiation , the average health ratings of trees subject to agsil withdrawal and continuing treatment was 5.36 and 5.67 respectively .
the tree health rating system used across all trial sites is based on the established system , where 1 = totally healthy and 10 = dead tree [ 29 ] .
root windows to facilitate measurements of root growth were installed under a selection of agsil drench and non - drenched trees .
trees received 300 ml agsil per tree , delivered in 20 l of water at each treatment date throughout the trial ( february , may , july and october 2014 ; february , may , august and december 2015 ; and may 2016 ) .
site 2 ( goodwood , qld ) : this trial site was established on a well - managed orchard with no history of potassium silicate treatment .
the trial consisted of two treatment rows in which potassium silicate soil drenches were applied , one in a block of relatively " healthy " trees , and the other row within a block of " sick " declining trees .
rows either side of the agsil treated rows were assessed for canopy health as the untreated controls .
trees received 300 ml agsil per tree , delivered in 20 l of water ( i.e. , approximately 5000 ppm ) at each treatment date throughout the trial ( july , october and december 2014 ; october and november 2015 ; and march 2016 ) .
yield data was collected in may 2015 .
site 3 ( beechmont , qld ) : this trial site was established on a small orchard with no history of potassium silicate treatment .
trees currently receive a phosphorous acid injection annually , however an area of the orchard in mid - decline was selected to evaluate a range of potassium silicate application methods .
treatments were undertaken by project staff , ( i.e. , not the grower ) , and included agsil soil drenches as per trial sites 1 and 2 ( 300 ml agsil per tree , delivered in 20 l of water , i.e. , 5000 ppm solution ) , foliar spray ( 50 ml agsil per tree delivered in 5 l water , i.e. , 3300 ppm solution ) and trunk injection ( approximately 1 ml agsil per tree in 100 ml water , i.e. , 3000 ppm solution delivered in 5 x 20 ml injection into vascular tissue per tree ) .
in 2014 trees were treated in june ( all treatments ) and december ( spray and drench ) , 2015 trees treated in may ( all treatments ) and december ( spray and drench ) , 2016 treated in may ( spray and drench ) and june ( all treatments ) .
tree health assessments have been obtained at least twice each year , and fruit were harvested for quality assessments in 2015 and 2016 .
site 4 ( comboyne , nsw ) : this trial site was established on an orchard with no history of potassium silicate treatment .
trees have been receiving recent spray applications of phosphorous acid to restore tree health , however a row of trees in mid - decline was identified as a treatment site .
nine and ten trees , respectively , were selected for untreated controls or agsil drench applications ( 300 ml agsil per tree , delivered in 20 l of water , i.e. , 5000 ppm ) .
agsil was applied by farm staff in august 2014 ; february , june , november and december 2015 ; and may and june 2016 .
trees were either pruned heavily or staghorned in march 2015 .
this trial was visited twice only , prior to treatment application and at the end of the trial in 2016 .
all trees in the trial were harvested at the time of final tree health assessment ( august 2016 ) and one bin of fruit from each treatment were transported to a commercial packingshed to obtain packout data .
4.2 .
greenhouse trials with mineral mulch and mineral dust mm and md are sustainable soil amendment by - products from the manufacture of cement building boards .
the major components are sand ( approximately 50 %) , pine pulp , cement and water , and contains 51 % total silica ( as sio2 ) , with 5 % as plant - available silica ( monosilic acid ) and calcium silicate .
the waste boards are milled so that 80 % of mm is composed of particles 1000 microm in size , while 88 % of md has particles in the 75 - 300 microm size range .
the effects of mineral mulch in avocado have not previously been reported .
four greenhouse trials with avocado seedlings were undertaken between 2015 and 2017 , and consisted of three steps ; treatment of avocado seedlings with md or mm , inoculation of the plants with ci or pc and assessment of seedling growth , root necrosis and nutrient uptake .
there were 12 replicate seedlings per treatment , and md or mm was applied twice , approximately 4 - 6 weeks apart .
treatments are outlined in result table 8 , table 9 , table 10 and table 11 the dust / mulch was gently incorporated into the top 1 - 2 cm of potting mix .
approximately 30 days later , all plants were re - potted into 140 mm diam .
round pots and inoculated with pc or ci. pathogen colonized grain , 10 - 20 ml ( or uncolonized grain as controls ) was sprinkled on a thin layer of potting mix sitting at the bottom of each pot .
the seedling was placed on top of the inoculum , and the pot back - filled with potting mix .
pc inoculated pots were watered until damp , placed on saucers to simulate waterlogging for 5 days before saucers were removed and all plants watered as required .
plant height was measured from the base of the stem to the apex and recoded just after inoculation and at the conclusion of the experiment .
at the conclusion of the trial , plants were uprooted , roots were washed to remove potting mix , and percentage of necrotic roots was assessed for each plant .
above - ground parts ( leaves and stems excised above the seed ) and root systems of each plant were placed into paper bags , weighed and dried for three days at 55 degreesc .
dried roots and leaves from selected treatments of experiments 1 and 2 were ground to a fine powder using a domestic coffee and spice grinder , then sent to the analytical services unit , school of agriculture and food science , university of queensland .
the samples were prepared by closed - vessel microwave assisted acid digestion , ( to solubilize elements in the presence of organic molecules ) , and then analyzed by icp - oes ( inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ) .

field trials with mineral mulch site 1 ( kumbia , qld ) : trees in this orchard were approximately 5 years old at the start of the trial .
a poorer section of the orchard was selected , where trees had not established well , or had died .
eight pairs of trees which were stunted , yellow and not thriving were tagged .
each tagged tree was rated for canopy health ( 0 = completely healthy and 10 = dead ) , and height and canopy diameter measured .
mm was spread under one of the trees in each pair , in an area corresponding to the canopy drip zone , at the rate of 255 g mm / m2 .
tree height varied considerably throughout the trial , so mm applications ranged from a minimum of 0.5 kg applied to the smallest tree up to 2.7 kg applied to the largest tree .
the same canopy heath , height and diameter measurements were recorded approximately 10 months after the mm application .
leaves and fruit were collected for quality and nutrient analyses , as described previously , but many of the trees had either no fruit or very little fruit , potentially skewing results .
site 2 ( goodwood , qld ) : trees in this orchard were approximately 11 years old at the start of the trial , and sections of the orchard are showing fairly uniform decline due to phytophthora root rot .
ten trees in mid - decline were selected and tagged .
mm was applied by manual broadcast to the drip zone of 10 trees in the centre row at the rate of 4.5 kg / tree .
canopy heath was again assessed approximately 10 months later , and leaves and fruit were collected for quality and nutrient analyses .
site 3 ( childers , qld ) : a section of 5 - year - old trees near a farm dam was selected , as trees were showing decline due to phytophthora root rot .
trees were also showing signs of moderate salt ( chloride ) leaf burn .
canopy health was recorded , and mm applied by manual broadcast to the drip zone of 10 trees in the centre row at the rate of 1.9 kg / tree .
canopy heath was again assessed approximately 10 months later , and leaves and fruit were collected for quality and nutrient analyses , as described previously .
there were limited numbers of fruit on trees .

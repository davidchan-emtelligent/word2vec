methods 40 patients from group health cooperative ( ghc ) , a large integrated healthcare system in washington state , with existing t2d and hemoglobin a1c values between 7.5 - 9.5 % , were recruited to receive up to eight free visits of anc over one year in addition to their usual care .
changes from baseline in self - care , self - efficacy and mood based on validated instrument scores were compared within the intervention group after 6 - and 12 - months .
clinical risk factors were also compared within group , and to a control group generated using electronic medical records ( n = 329 ) , at the end of one - year .
results significant improvements were measured in composite scores of the summary of diabetes self - care activities ( sdsca ) instrument for diet (+ 20 % mean score , p = 0.001 ) , exercise (+ 28 % mean score , p = 0.02 ) and glucose testing (+ 45 % mean score , p = 0.001 ) .
significant changes were also measured in depression scores measured by phq - 8 ( - 33 % mean score , p = 0.001 ) and improved self - efficacy measured by the self - efficacy scale (+ 25 % mean score , p = 0.0001 ) .
many of the observed changes in self - care corresponded to the period of more intensive anc utilization , i.e. the first six months , however improvements in glucose testing , self - efficacy and improved mood scores persisted at 1 - year (+ 24 % mean score , p = 0.002 ; + 43 % mean score , p = 0.003 ; and - 33 % mean score , p = 0.005 respectively ) .
changes in clinical risk factors were small during the period of anc , though hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) improved significantly within group ( - 0.90 % , p = 0.02 ) and compared to electronic controls ( - 0.51 % , p = 0.07 ) at 6 - months .
conclusion patients with inadequately controlled t2d improved in their self - care behaviors , self - efficacy , mood and clinical risk during the period of anc .
clinical trials are feasible and warranted .

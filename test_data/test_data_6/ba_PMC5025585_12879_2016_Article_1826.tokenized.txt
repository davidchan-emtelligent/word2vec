background acute hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection ( ahcvi ) outbreaks have been described recently within defined areas worldwide among hiv - infected homosexual men .
this study aims to describe the cumulative frequency and incidence of firstly acquired ahcvi in an hiv - infected population in southern spain .
methods this is a retrospective study conducted at the infectious diseases units of eight hospitals in andalusia , southern spain .
primary ahc was considered as hcv immunoglobulin g antibody seroconversion .
the time of infection was considered the moment between the last negative and the first positive hcv antibody determination .
results a total of 23 cases of primary ahcvi have been detected from 2000 to 2014 .
incidence rates [ ir ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci )] were 0.036 ( 2.272 - 0.054 ) per 100 person - years ( py ) in the overall population over a follow - up period of 64170 py. of the 22 ( 95.7 %) male subjects , 21 ( 95.5 %) had acquired ahcvi by homosexual contact , the ir ( 95 % ci ) was 0.039 ( 0.024 - 0.06 ) per 100 py in this subpopulation .
there was no evidence of an increase of ahcvi ir. the incidence of ahcvi was slightly lower between 2000 and 2004 as compared to 2005 - 2009 [ ir ratio ( irr ) of 8.8 ( 95 % ci : 1.279 - 378.794 ; p = 0.01 )] but reached a plateau afterwards [ irr between 2010 and 2014 versus 2005 - 2009 : 0.727 ( 0.286 - 1.848 ; p = 0.5 )] .
the median ( q1 - q3 ) time between the last negative anti - hcv and the first positive anti - hcv determination was 4.7 ( 1.9 - 11.2 ) months .
peak ( q1 - q3 ) alt and total bilirubin values during ahcvi were 496 ( 291 - 656 ) iu / ml and 1.15 ( 0.9 - 1.98 ) mg / dl , respectively .
conclusions in contrast to what has been reported from other areas , the incidence of primary ahcvi in the hiv - infected population is stable in southern spain and there is no evidence of an epidemic , in spite of the high prevalence of hiv / hcv - coinfection in this area .

these epidemics have affected mainly men who have sex with men ( msm ) and have led to an increase in the incidence of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection in some particular areas [ 5 , 6 ] .
additionally , recent studies conducted in very specific areas within large spanish cities have reported an increase in the number of cases of ahcvi among hiv - infected msm [ 7 , 8 ] .
to date , no cases of ahcvi among the hiv - infected population from southern spain have been published , in spite of the fact that in this area over one third of hiv - infected subjects currently bear an active hcv coinfection [ 11 ] .
this might suggest that , whatever the reason , the occurrence of acute hcv infection outbreaks among hiv - infected msm is subject to regional variations .
however , cases of acute hcv infection may also go unnoticed , since many of them are subclinical .
because of this , underreporting of ahcvi could have underlied the lack of detection of outbreaks of this disorder in our area .
it is to note that approximately 40 % of the hiv - coinfected population in the southern spanish region of andalusia does not show positive serology for hcv and is thus susceptible for ahcvi .
to provide insight on this point , this study aimed to determine the number of cases of firstly acquired ahcvi infection among hiv - infected patients seen at eight southern spanish hospitals , who attend a vast population of hiv - infected individuals with high prevalence of hcv coinfection .
methods study population this retrospective study was conducted in the infectious diseases units of eight hospitals throughout the southern spanish provinces of almeria , cadiz , huelva , malaga and seville .
all hiv - positive patients seen from 2000 to 2014 and who showed negative plasma igg antibody against hcv ( anti - hcv ) were included .
in our area , all hiv - infected patients are cared for at public hospitals , where they attend at least once every 6 months , and may ask for additional visits when required or at their own decision .
in all this institutions , routine blood parameters , including liver function test are conducted every visit .
also , hcv serum antibodies are determined at the first visit and every 12 - 18 months , as well as when clinically appropriated , in previously seronegative patients .
all cases of firstly acquired ahcvi in hiv - infected patients diagnosed in the above - stated institutions according to the below - stated criteria were analyzed retrospectively .
definition of firstly acquired ahcvi an episode of ahcvi was diagnosed in patients with confirmed prior absence of anti - hcv if i ) anti - hcv seroconversion or a 10 - fold increase in alt levels above the upper limit of normality ( uln ) along with detectable plasma hcv - rna were observed ; ii ) acute hepatitis b virus and hepatitis a virus infection were ruled out by negative igm anti - hbc and igm anti - hav tests and iii ) toxic acute hepatitis was reasonably excluded .
the date of ahcvi was estimated as the midpoint between the date of the last anti - hcv negative result and the date of the first positive determination or when hcv - rna was detected for the first time .
laboratory determinations serological determinations were conducted by enzyme immunoassay ( advia centaur xp , siemens healthcare diagnostics s.l. tarrytown , ny , usa or elecsys ( r ) anti - hcv ii , roche diagnostics , basel , suisse ) .
plasma hcv rna was quantified as described elsewhere [ 12 ] .
hcv genotype was determined using the versant hcv genotype 2.0 kit ( siemens healthcare , erlangen , germany ) .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics of demographic factors , hiv transmission route and analytical values were carried out .
incidence rates ( ir ) and the 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) of firstly acquired ahcvi were calculated and presented as cases per 100 person - years ( py ) .
study periods were defined as followed : 2000 - 2004 ( period 1 ) , 2005 - 2009 ( period 2 ) and 2010 - 2014 ( period 3 ) .
subsequently , based on poisson regression , ir ratios ( irr ) were determined in order to evaluate the relative risk for acquisition of ahcvi between the different study periods , as well as for possible geographic differences were calculated .
analyses were carried out by means of the spss statistical software package release 23.0 ( ibm corporation , somers , ny , usa ) and stata 9.0 ( statacorp lp , college station , tx , usa ) .
ethical aspects the study was designed and performed according to the helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethics committee of the valme university hospital ( seville , spain ) .
all patients gave their written informed consent .
results a total of 23 cases of primary ahcvi were detected .
all of them were observed in five of the eight participating hospitals : 10 cases were reported from malaga and the remaining 13 individuals were identified in seville .
the characteristics of the patients at the moment of ahcvi diagnosis are listed in table 1 .

the majority ( 91.3 %) of the patients were msm , none of whom had any history of injecting drug use during follow - up. the distribution of patients according to the years of seroconversion is depicted in fig. 1. over a follow - up period of 64170 py from 2000 to 2014 , the overall ir ( 95 % ci ) was 0.036 ( 2.272 - 0.054 ) per 100 py. the ir ( 95 % ci ) for second and the first study period were 0.054 ( 0.027 - 0.097 ) per 100 py versus 0.006 ( 0.001 - 0.034 ) per 100 py , resulting in an irr of 8.8 ( 95 % ci : 1.279 - 378.794 ; p = 0.01 ) .
the irr between the third ( ir 0.039 per 100 py ; 95 % ci : 0.02 - 0.071 ) versus the second period was 0.727 ( 0.286 - 1.848 ; p = 0.5 ) .
in the subpopulation of msm , the overall ir ( 95 % ci ) was 0.039 ( 0.024 - 0.06 ) per 100 py. the ir ( 95 % ci ) for the first , second and third study periods were 0.008 ( 0.001 - 0.041 ) per 100 py , 0.066 ( 0.032 - 0.121 ) per 100 py and 0.04 ( 0.19 - 0.073 ) per 100 py , respectively .
the corresponding irr were 8.682 ( 95 % ci : 1.235 - 376.792 ; p = 0.012 ) for the second versus the first period and 0.605 ( 95 % ci : 0.226 - 1.62 ; p = 0.27 ) for the third versus the second period .
the ir for each study year are shown in fig. 1. a subanalysis to compare the ir between malaga and seville revealed ir of 0.048 and 0.044 , respectively ( irr : 0.937 ; 95 % ci : 0.38 - 2.388 , p = 0.872 ) .

the median ( iqr ) peak alt values and total bilirubin levels during ahcvi were 496 ( 291 - 656 ) iu / ml and 1.15 ( 0.9 - 1.98 ) mg / dl , respectively .
fifteen ( 65.2 %) patients showed 10 - fold or greater increases in alt levels above the uln throughout the episode of ahcvi .
likewise , 6 ( 26.1 %) individuals showed total bilirubin levels above 2 mg / dl at some point during acute infection .
discussion in this study , the number of firstly acquired ahcvi episodes among hiv - infected patients seen at 8 hospitals from southern spain has not experienced a progressive increase , as observed in other areas [ 3 , 6 - 8 ] .
conversely , the number of cases diagnosed after 2003 has remained stable .
this data strongly suggest that currently there is no ongoing outbreak of ahcvi among hiv - infected patients in southern spain .
a recent analysis of a nationwide spanish cohort of hiv - infected individuals suggested an augmented hcv follow - up testing of possible hcv seroconversion in the hiv - infected population in the last years in our area [ 13 ] .
in spite of this , the incidence of ahcvi observed in the present study did not change during the last years .
it is , however , to note that no cases of ahcvi were reported between 2000 and 2003 , which resulted in a slightly lower ir for the first study period .
still , the increase in the number of cases from before to after 2003 was minimum , with a peak of 4 patients per year .
furthermore and in contrary to what was observed in other cities , [ 1 - 10 ] the incidence of primary ahcvi has been stable throughout the last decade , with no evidence of a trend towards an increase .
considerable increases of the number ahcvi episodes have been reported from very specific areas of spain .
in this context , a retrospective study conducted from 2008 to 2012 in an outpatient clinic of madrid reported 19 cases of ahcvi , seven of which were diagnosed in 2012 [ 7 ] .
likewise , a case report derived from a clinic attending the largest msm community in madrid , reported four cases of recently acquired ahcvi among msm hiv - infected patients [ 9 ] .
additionally , a retrospective analysis conducted in hiv - infected individuals seen from 2003 to 2015 in a clinic from barcelona , which also attend a large community of msm , reported an important increase of ahcvi episodes .
thus , while only 3 patients were diagnosed for ahcvi between 2003 and 2006 , approximately one episode per month was registered from 2007 to 2011 , reaching a peak of almost 30 diagnoses in 2012 [ 8 ] .
clearly , this tendency is not observed in our study , despite the presence of a msm community especially in the costal area of southern spain and in the seville area [ 11 ] .
interestingly , there was no also no difference in the incidences of ahcvi when comparing the inland city of seville and the coastal city of malaga .
the lack of an epidemic of ahcvi in an area where , on the one hand , approximately 60 % of the hiv - infected patients are positive for hcv antibodies [ 11 ] and , on the other hand , only 20 % show active hcv - infection , [ 14 ] is an intriguing point .
this fact may have different reasons .
on the one hand , it has been speculated that host genetic factors play a role in the susceptibility of hcv infection [ 15 ] .
however , the role of host genetics in this context remains unclear and it is unlikely that there is a significant genetic diversity between the populations of central / northern spain and the herein analyzed individuals [ 16 ] .
on the other hand , the results of phylogenetic analyses of the viral strains and a disproportionately high frequency of hcv genotype 4 infection suggest a clustering of strains causing ahcvi outbreaks in hiv - infected msm [ 2 , 4 , 7 , 17 , 18 ] .
likewise , in hiv - infected msm with ahcvi in spain , the proportion of acute hcv genotype 4 infections is higher than expected when compared to the prevalence of hcv genotype 4 in chronically infected populations [ 7 , 8 ] .
conversely , in the present study acute infection with genotype 1 was predominantly observed , standing in accordance with the hcv genotype distribution commonly observed among hiv / hcv - coinfected individuals seen in our area [ 11 ] .
thus , this observation adds up to the conclusion that the situation in southern spain is different to what is observed elsewhere .
finally , differences in sexual risk behaviour may account for the lack of an epidemic in our setting .
while transmission of hcv is rare in hiv - positive population , [ 6 ] and even more uncommon in hiv - negative heterosexual couples , certain practices often carried out by msm , such as unprotected anal sex with bleeding , fisting or group sex have been associated with hcv transmission [ 3 , 19 , 20 ] .
additionally , in msm , hiv - coinfection itself might favour sexual hcv transmission [ 21 ] .
although no comparative studies on sexual risk behaviour have been conducted between different areas , data obtained from hiv - infected msm in our setting suggest that high risk behaviour is also common among them [ 22 ] .
in our opinion , certain hcv strains particularly infective through transmucosal way may spread among a specific msm subset with high risk practises leading to an outbreak of ahcvi .
it is unlikely that this chain of events has taken place in our area so far .
this is supported by another southern spanish study conducted in hiv - infected patients who had achieved treatment - induced hcv clearance and which found a very low incidence rate of reinfection with hcv [ 23 ] .
however , this point requires further investigation but , if confirmed , it would have important implications for preventing hcv transmission among hiv - infected msm .
the main limitation of this study is its retrospective design .
indeed , since episodes of ahcvi are frequently asymptomatic , [ 24 ] as in was the case in our patients , we cannot rule out that some cases could have gone unnoticed .
however , it is unlikely that diagnosis of ahcvi was missed to a great extent in our hospitals in the last decade .
in fact , hcv serology is usually performed at the first visit and sequentially afterwards in order to diagnose hcv infection at the infectious diseases units in our area .
still , a prospective study to evaluate the incidence of ahcvi in hiv coinfection is warranted .
this study should include a detailed questionnaire about sexual practices that enabled to compare data with those already carried out in other regions .
conclusions in conclusion , the number of cases of primary ahcvi in hiv - infected patients in southern spain is both low and stable .
prospective studies to determine the incidence of ahcvi , as well as the reasons for the lack of an epidemic outbreak in this setting , are necessary .
these data are crucial for preventing ahcvi .
in the meantime , awareness and sequential screening for hcv antibodies in seronegative patients are needed .

this paper presents an analysis of the level of blood hemoglobin and the rates of anemia in chinese rural residents in the 2010 - 2012 national nutrition and health survey , and the change in its prevalence in rural residents during the last ten years .
our methodology included data from the chinese nutrition and health surveillance in 2010 - 2012 , where samples were selected through the method of probability proportion to size .
the study objects were from 150 sites in provinces , autonomous regions , or municipalities in china .
the concentration of blood hemoglobin was determined using the cyanmethemoglobin method .
anemia was judged by the anemia standard recommended by the world health organization ( who ) , combined with elevation correction standard .
the level of blood hemoglobin , the prevalence of anemia , and the 95 % ci ( confidence interval ) value were analyzed using complex sampling weighted processing , combined with the population figures released by the national bureau of statistics in 2009 .
our results indicate that the level of blood hemoglobin of the chinese rural area population was 145.92 +/ - 0.83 g / l , with the prevalence of anemia in the chinese rural population at 9.7 % ( 95 % ci : 9.4 % - 10.0 %) .
the prevalence of anemia in children 6 - 11 years old was 5.5 % ( 95 % ci : 5.0 % - 6.0 %) , 8.1 % ( 95 % ci : 7.5 % - 8.7 %) for 12 - 17 - year - old teenagers , 10.0 % ( 95 % ci : 9.4 % - 10.6 %) for 18 - 44 - year - old adults , 9.6 % ( 95 % ci : 9.0 % - 10.1 %) for 45 - 59 - year - old adults , and 12.6 % ( 95 % ci : 11.9 % - 13.3 %) for the elderly above 60 years old .
our conclusion shows that the prevalence of anemia in the chinese rural population in 2010 - 2012 had obviously decreased compared to the last decade ; however , women of reproductive age and the elderly still had a high prevalence of anemia .
anemia chinese rural residents hemoglobin nutrition survey 1 .
introduction anemia is a condition in which the number and size of red blood cells , or the hemoglobin concentration , falls below an established cut - off value , consequently impairing the capacity of the blood to transport oxygen around the body .
it is a common nutritional problem worldwide , and more than a quarter of the global population - - especially in developing countries - - suffer from anemia [ 1 ] .
anemia is common in infants and young children , women of childbearing age , pregnant women , lactating women , and the elderly .
there are many reasons that can lead to anemia , such as iron deficiency , a lack of vitamin b12 , sickle cell anemia , infections like malaria , etc. ; however , iron deficiency is usually the main cause .
iron - deficient anemia affected 1.2 billion people in 2013 [ 2 ] .
studies reported that anemia in infancy and children may lead to irreversible body development , including the brain , which is the fastest developing organ in infancy and early childhood and increased mortality and morbidity [ 3,4,5 ] .
severe maternal anemia can contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes and affect the iron status of newborns [ 6,7 ] .
national nutrition and health surveys are not only important indicators of economic and social development , healthcare , and the population health quality of a nation or region , but also provide basic information necessary to formulate national strategies for public health and disease prevention and control .
china carried out its first national nutrition and health survey in 1959 , and it has subsequently been conducted every ten years since 1982 [ 8 ] .
the determination of hemoglobin content is the most commonly used method for evaluating anemia status .
china uses the determination of hemoglobin as a monitoring indicator of anemia in the national nutrition survey .
the global prevalence of anemia in 2010 was 32.9 % [ 1 ] .
in 2002 , the china national nutrition and health survey indicated that the anemia prevalence rate of chinese residents was 20.1 % , with an urban level of 18.2 % and rural level of 20.8 % [ 9 ] .
in 2010 - 2012 , china completed its fourth national nutrition and health survey .
in this paper , we take monitoring data from the 2010 - 2012 china national nutrition and health survey to evaluate the prevalence of anemia and the improvement status for rural residents in this decade .
the hemoglobin level was determined by the cyanmethemoglobin method , which is a frequently - used method for hemoglobin determination in many anemia - related studies [ 10,11,12,13 ] , and one of the methods generally recommended for use in surveys to determine the population prevalence of anemia by the world health organization ( who ) [ 14 ] .
2. subjects and methods 2.1 .
sample design and study population the 2010 - 2012 china national nutrition and health survey ( cnnhs ) was a national , representative , and cross - sectional study on diet and chronic disease .
it covered all 31 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government throughout china ( with the exceptions of taiwan , hong kong , and macao ) .
participants were recruited by a random stratified multistage cluster sampling design .
the cnnhs contained four strata : large cities , small - to - medium - sized cities , ordinary rural areas , and poor rural areas , according to their economic characteristics and social development .
large cities were municipality and provincial capitals that contained a population of more than one million people .
small - to - medium cities were defined as downtown areas that excluded the large cities .
poor rural areas were key poverty counties that were designated according to the " 2001 - 2010 national rural poverty alleviation and development program " .
ordinary rural areas were counties that excluded the key poverty counties .
the sample size was about 160,000 , which was calculated according to the low incidence of diabetes ( 3 %) , adults above 18 years old ( 78 %) , and the lost rate of follow up ( 10 %) .
according to the population proportion , the first stage of sampling involved a total of 150 counties as monitoring sites , including 34 large cities , 41 small - to - medium cities , 30 ordinary rural areas , and 45 poor rural areas .
the second stage involved the random selection of six village committees in each monitoring site .
the third stage involved the random selection of 75 families in each village committee [ 15 ] .
all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the ethical committee of institute of nutrition and food safety , chinese center for disease control and prevention ( 2013 - 018 ) .
for residents under the age of 18 , informed written consent was obtained from the participants' parents prior to the start of the study .
for residents above the age of 18 , informed written consent was obtained from the participants .
the flow chart of the national nutrition and health survey was shown in figure 1 .
2.2 .
blood sample and hemoglobin measurement peripheral whole venous and fasting blood were first collected in edta ( ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ) tubes , where 10 mul anticoagulant whole blood by 10 mul quantitative capillary tube ( drummond scientific company , broomall , pa , usa ) were collected especially for the hemoglobin test .
all blood samples were used for double determination .
we used the cyanmethemoglobin method to analyze the hemoglobin level .
it is the most reliable laboratory method for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin , and serves as a reference for the comparison and standardization of other methods [ 14 ] .
laboratory operations staff participated in the uniform national team training and examination .
after becoming qualified , they could take part in the hemoglobin measurement .
the intra - and inter - assay cv ( coefficient of variation ) in the analysis method were 1.03 % - 2.91 % and 2.04 % - 3.70 % , respectively .
blind samples ( high and low value hemoglobin ) were measured and qualified before proceeding with fieldwork .
after the official start of the fieldwork , we tested one quality control analysis every thirty samples .
2.3 .
criteria of anemia it is well - known that normal hemoglobin distributions vary with age , gender , and altitude .
therefore , the correct interpretation of hemoglobin requires the consideration of modulating factors in selecting appropriate cut - off values .
those values at sea level for hemoglobin corresponding to anemia are presented in table 1 [ 14 ] .
hemoglobin levels at various altitudes are shown in table 2 [ 14 ] .
2.4 .
data check the determination of hemoglobin level was finished in each monitoring site , and data were input into the unified soft " china national nutrition and health survey system platform " .
therefore , the unified data check principle was mainly formulated on the following aspects : ( 1 ) whether the individual code was repeated ; ( 2 ) the difference of two parallel determination values should be less than 20 % of the mean ; ( 3 ) after receiving the reported data , we calculated the hemoglobin level according to the absorbance value of spectrophotometer ; and finally , compared with the reported values .
thus , the calculated hemoglobin level and reported values should be the same .
according to the unified data check principle , the problem record was returned to the monitoring site for the second check .
2.5 .
statistical analysis we used the population figures released by the national bureau of statistics in 2009 as a standard population .
hemoglobin levels and anemia rate analyses were adjusted for sample weights and the clustered survey design [ 15 ] .
hemoglobin results were expressed as means +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
an anova ( analysis of variance ) test ( student - newman - keuls ) was used to compare multiple groups of hemoglobin levels .
a t - test was used to compare two groups of hemoglobin levels .
the anemia rate was expressed as the rate , followed by the 95 % ci ( confidence interval ) .
the rao - scott chi - square test was used to compare anemia prevalence among different groups .
all statistical analyses were performed using statistical analysis systems 9.2 software ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
3. results the total sample size was originally designed to about 160,000 people , of which about 87,000 people were invited from rural areas and 80,814 people participated in a medical examination .
excluding the people who did not wish to participate and unqualified data , the rural population distribution by age , sex , and area in city and rural area in the final study is presented in table 3 .
around 73,182 subjects from the rural area were involved in the blood hemoglobin measurement , including 33,826 men ( 46.2 %) and 39,356 women ( 53.8 %) .
additionally , 1763 pregnant women were also included .
the average hemoglobin of a chinese rural resident was 145.92 g / l. except for the 6 - 11 age group residents , the hemoglobin levels of males were higher than that of females among other age groups .
the hemoglobin level of all age groups in rural residents is shown in table 4 .
the average hemoglobin of rural pregnant women was 123.5 g / l. there were significant differences in hemoglobin levels between different age groups ( f = 324.18 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the hemoglobin of 6 - 11 - year - old children was the lowest , and that of the 18 - 44 - year - old adults was the highest .
the hemoglobin of poor rural areas was significantly lower than that in the ordinary rural areas ( t = 3.21 , p = 0.0013 ) .
the female hemoglobin rate was significantly lower than that of males ( t = 105.46 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the prevalence of anemia in chinese rural residents was 9.7 % , with males at 7.2 % and females at 12.4 % .
the prevalence of anemia also appeared to increase with age , with a high prevalence of the elderly aged over 60 .
the prevalence of anemia in childbearing women between 18 and 44 years was higher than all other age groups .
the prevalence of anemia for all age groups in rural residents is shown in table 5 .
there were significant differences in anemia prevalence rate between different age groups ( chi2 = 169.2 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the prevalence of anemia in 6 - 11 - year - old children was the lowest , and was highest in the elderly over 60 years old .
the anemia rate in poor rural areas was significantly higher than that of ordinary rural areas ( chi2 = 47.5 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the female anemia rate was significantly higher than that of males ( chi2 = 228.4 , p < 0.0001 ) .
for rural pregnant women , the anemia prevalence rate was 17.5 % ( 15.8 % - 19.2 %) , among which the ordinary rural area level was 16.1 % ( 14.0 % - 18.1 %) and the poor rural area level was 20.0 % ( 17.1 % - 23.0 %) .
in 2002 , the anemia prevalence rate of chinese rural residents ( aged 6 years and above ) was 22.2 % , among which the rate in males was 18.4 % and in females was 25.5 % .
compared with that in 2002 , the anemia rate of chinese rural residents aged 6 years and above fell by 12.5 percentage points ( chi2 = 3815.9 , p < 0.0001 ) , male levels fell by 11.2 percentage points ( chi2 = 1453.1 , p < 0.0001 ) , and females fell by 13.1 percentage points ( chi2 = 2420.3 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the anemia rate of 6 - 11 - year - old children fell by 7.5 percentage points ( chi2 = 320.4 , p < 0.0001 ) .
teenagers aged 12 - 17 years fell by 9.4 percentage points ( chi2 = 371.0 , p < 0.0001 ) .
rural residents in the age group 18 - 44 years fell by 11.8 percentage points ( chi2 = 788.0 , p < 0.0001 ) , and rural residents aged 45 - 59 years fell by 15.4 percentage points ( chi2 = 1559.3 , p < 0.0001 ) .
elderly people aged 60 years and above fell by 19.0 percentage points ( chi2 = 1360.9 , p < 0.0001 ) .
the anemia prevalence rate of all age groups in rural residents in the 2002 survey is shown in table 6 .
the anemia prevalence rate of rural pregnant women in the 2002 survey was 30.4 % , compared with that in 2002 , the rate of anemia in rural pregnant women fell by 12.9 percentage points ( chi2 = 129.7 , p < 0.0001 ) .
4. discussion and conclusions anemia is a global public health problem affecting both developing and developed countries , and is always used as an indicator of both poor nutrition and poor health .
in this survey , the blood hemoglobin level of the chinese rural area population was 145.92 +/ - 0.83 g / l. the anemia prevalence of the chinese rural area population was 9.7 % ( 95 % ci : 9.4 % - 10.0 %) , which was lower than the global anemia prevalence ( 32.9 %) in 2010 [ 1 ] .
the prevalence of anemia in chinese rural residents is significantly lower than it was ten years ago .
the prevalence of anemia in 18 - 44 - year - old women is much improved , but is still the highest in all age groups , even higher than that of women over 60 years of age .
this may be related to the 18 - 44 - year - old group being involved in periods of birth , breast - feeding , and menstruation .
in this period , the body requires a lot of iron , otherwise it results in iron deficiency anemia ( ida ) , which develops when body stores of iron drop too low to support normal red blood cell ( rbc ) production .
the who has conducted a study on the anemic status of childbearing - aged women from 107 countries all over the world and found that the anemia rate of childbearing aged women fell from 33 % in 1995 to 29 % in 2011 [ 16 ] .
a japanese study on the prevalence of anemia in healthy japanese women also showed that women aged 20 to 49 had a significantly higher rate of anemia than other age groups of women [ 17 ] .
the problems of anemia in childbearing age women caused wide attention around the world ; indeed , the world health assembly in 2014 ( wha ) proposed global nutrition goals which aim at reducing anemia in women of childbearing age by 50 % before 2025 [ 18 ] .
in addition , the prevalence of anemia in the elderly is higher than the national average , which is equivalent to that in developed countries .
it has been reported that in the united states , more than 10 % have ida at age 65 and older [ 19 ] .
anemia is common in the elderly , and its impact on various important health outcomes has recently been clearly demonstrated [ 20,21,22 ] - - especially for the very elderly .
in the very elderly ( age 85 and older ) , ida carries an increased risk of mortality ( hazard ratio 1.41 ) in addition to conditions causing anemia [ 23 ] .
china has entered the aging society , and in 2014 , the elderly population reached 200 million .
in the next 20 years , the elderly population will enter a rapid growth period and reach a third of the population in 2050 .
therefore , more attention needs to be directed towards the intervention of anemia in the elderly , and actions need to be considered to improve the quality of life for the elderly .
iron deficiency is the most important cause of anemia .
in 2013 , anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 183,000 deaths , down from 213,000 deaths in 1990 [ 2 ] .
the total dietary iron intake of rural adults above 18 years old was 21.2 mg / day [ 24 ] , down from 23.1 mg in the 2002 survey .
iron absorption has obvious differences in different food types .
for example , iron absorption is one percent for rice , three percent for corn , five percent for flour , and 22 % for animal meat [ 25 ] .
in this survey , pork and poultry intake were 59.9 g / day and 13.1 g / day , respectively [ 24 ] , increased from 47.2 g / day and 10.6 g / day in 2002 .
therefore , we believe that the increase of meat consumption may help to improve anemia levels .
one study on the iron status of the chinese population in poor rural areas ( n = 4186 ) [ 26 ] found that the average concentration of serum ferritin ( sf ) for residents in poor rural areas was 98.7 ng / ml - - 140 ng / ml for males , and 72.1 ng / ml for females .
the average serum transferrin receptor ( stfr ) concentration for the anemic population in poor rural areas was 4.05 mg / l - - 3.48 mg / l for anemic males , and 4.47 mg / l for anemic females [ 26 ] .
furthermore , the iron deficiency rate of anemic residents in poor rural areas was 32.6 % , 15.5 % for anemic males and 43.7 % for anemic females [ 26 ] .
criteria of stfr > 5.0 mg / l ( male ) and stfr > 4.4 mg / l ( female ) or sf < 15 ng / ml can be diagnosed as iron deficiency .
as there were no related iron status data in the 2002 nutritional survey , a conclusion could not be made that the decline of iron deficiency anemia was the main cause of anemia improvement , even though it is generally believed that iron - deficiency is the main cause of anemia .
public health strategies for the prevention and improvement of anemia levels include improving dietary diversity , food iron and folic acid fortification , and increases in the intake of iron nutritional supplements .
food fortification is the most common method in which to supplement nutrients in food , and could effectively decrease the incidence of nutrient deficiencies [ 27 ] .
this is demonstrated by europe and the united states , where iron fortification in flour has improved the iron anemia prevalence rate from 30 % to 10 % [ 1 ] .
in china , soy sauce fortified with nafeedta ( sodium iron ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ) has been used to improve the anemia situation .
it has been reported that nafeedta - fortified soy sauce has had an obvious effect on correcting iron deficiency and reducing anemia [ 28,29 ] .
in addition to food fortification , we also concluded that the following factors might also be conducive to changes in anemia prevalence .
first , actively promoting the risks of anemia through school education , the media , and community health programs .
second , by improving the living standards of the residents , especially in dietary diversity and an increased intake of iron - rich foods .
third , the increase of public health awareness , regular physical examinations , and adopting intervention measures after the discovery of anemia .
a variety of reasons have contributed to the decrease of the prevalence of anemia .
there are some limitations to this study ; as we initially did not think that there had been great improvements in the prevalence of anemia , the nutrition survey did not include examining some of the causes of improvement in anemia rates , such as iron supplements , nafeedta - fortified soy sauce usage , or other iron - fortified food .
the strength of the study lies in the fact that the data used comes directly from the cnnhs , which covers all 31 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government throughout china , therefore providing this study with very good representativeness and an accurate assessment on the status of anemia .
in short , the prevalence of anemia in chinese rural residents has improved greatly compared with that ten years ago .
future attention needs to be paid to the evaluation of the intervention measures used to improve anemia , strengthen the concern for key crowd anemia , and put forward effective and safe measures for anemia improvement in order to achieve the nutritional disease control target proposed by the development of chinese food and nutrition program ( 2014 - 2030 ) , which aims at an anemia prevalence rate of under 10 % for the whole population .

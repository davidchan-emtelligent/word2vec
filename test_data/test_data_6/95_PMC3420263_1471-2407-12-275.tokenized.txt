background primary extracranial meningiomas ( pems ) originating from the nasal septum are extremely rare , as are extracranial metastases of meningiomas .
case presentation a 44 - year - old male presented with a 2 - month history of left - side nasal obstruction and frequent episodes of epistaxis .
a friable mass originating from the nasal septum was resected completely via an endoscopic endonasal approach .
according to who criteria , the tumor was diagnosed as an atypical meningioma radiologically and histopathologically .
two years later , a tumor recurred at the primary site with the same histopathological findings , and the patient was given local external radiotherapy ( 6840 cgy in 38 fractions ) .
two months after this local recurrence , a left anterior chest wall mass and a left parietal area scalp mass were observed .
the subcutaneous mass was resected and showed histological evidence of malignant transformation .
several months after the last operation , the patient died .
conclusions we describe the clinical , radiological , and bio - pathological features of this unique case and review the literature on atypical pems originating in the nasal septum .
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of an atypical pem originating from the nasal septum that recurred with malignant transformation and extracranial metastasis .
extracranial meningiomas ectopic meningiomas atypical meningiomas nasal septum nasal cavity metastasis background meningiomas are relatively common entities , accounting for 13 - 18 % of intracranial neoplasms in adults , but they are rarely seen in extracranial locations , such as the spine , skull convexities , neck , chest , shoulder , and peritoneum [ 1,2 ] .
meningiomas in these locations are called extracranial meningiomas , and they account for fewer than 2 % of all meningiomas [ 3 ] .
extracranial meningiomas include both primary and secondary types , based on the absence or presence of intracranial attachments , respectively .
primary extracranial meningiomas ( pems , ectopic meningiomas ) arise ectopically within a given tissue with no evidence of direct attachment to the brain tissue. of these pems , only 11.5 % are encountered in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses [ 4 ] , and one pem originating from the nasal septum has been reported [ 5 ] .
atypical meningioma is a rare variant that comprises 5 - 15 % of all meningiomas .
the reported rate of malignant change in meningiomas is less than 7 % [ 6 ] .
although metastases may be more frequent in pems than in intracranial meningiomas [ 7 - 9 ] , metastatic meningiomas are extremely rare ( 0.1 %) [ 10 ] .
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of an atypical pem originating from the nasal septum with distant metastasis and ultimately fatal progression .
case presentation a 44 - year - old male was admitted to our clinic with a history of left - side nasal obstruction , episodes of epistaxis , hyposmia , and postnasal discharge over the previous 2 months .
the patient had undergone endoscopic sinus surgery 2 years earlier for bilateral sinusitis at another clinic .
otherwise , his medical history was unremarkable .
general and neurological examinations and routine laboratory test results were unremarkable .
non - contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) sections revealed an extensive hypodense non - calcified lesion occupying the left nasal cavity and pushing against the lateral nasal wall ( figure 1a ) .
the lesion showed heterogeneous iodinated contrast enhancement and demonstrated remodeling of the adjacent bony structure ( figure 1b ) .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed that the tumor mass was of slightly lower intensity than the brain parenchyma on t1 - weighted images and heterogeneously isointense on t2 - weighted images , with significant heterogeneous contrast enhancement on gadolinium administration ( figure 2a - d ) .
the preoperative ct and mri showed an endonasal soft tissue mass with no intracranial connection .
during the operation , a friable mass originating from the bony - cartilage junction of the nasal septum and extending to the lateral nasal wall was resected completely with the attached septal cartilage and nasal mucosa via an endoscopic endonasal approach .
the safety margins were free of disease .

( a ) t1 - weighted pns mri showed a primary lesion of slightly lower signal intensity in the left nasal cavity .
( b ) the lesion was heterogeneously isointense on t2 - weighted images .
( c ) contrast - enhanced mri showed heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion .
( d ) coronal reconstruction of a t1 - weighted mri scan revealed an isolated primary lesion with no evidence of direct attachment to brain tissue .
microscopically , the tumor cells were arranged in sheet - like growths or were uninterrupted and patternless and showed nasal septum invasion ( figure 3a ) .
no cellular whorl , psammoma body , or necrosis was observed .
individual tumor cells had round - to - oval nuclei , with prominent nucleoli and dense nuclear membranes .
mitosis was seen frequently ( 7 / 10 hfp , figure 3b ) .
the immunohistochemical profile was positive for epithelial membrane antigen ( figure 3c ) and vimentin ( figure 3d ) , focal positive for s - 100 protein , and negative for cytokeratin , p63 , and smooth muscle actin .
this histopathological investigation led to a diagnosis of an atypical meningioma ( who grade ii ) according to who criteria [ 11,12 ] .

( b ) atypical cells having round - to - oval nuclei , with prominent nucleoli and occasional mitoses ( x400 , h & e ) .
the tumour cells were diffusely positive for ema ( c , x400 ) and vimentin ( d , x400 ) .
two years later , the patient was readmitted to the hematology and oncology department of our hospital with recurrent severe epistaxis and general weakness , which had developed over the previous month .
he also described breathing difficulties .
paranasal sinus ct showed recurrence of the left nasal cavity tumor , with palate and maxilla region involvement .
histological investigation of this second tumor showed morphological characteristics similar to the primary tumor ( figure 4a ) .
positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) was used to identify distant metastases .
pet / ct showed no abnormal glucose metabolic activity , except in the nasal cavity and palate region .
the patient received local external radiotherapy ( 6840 cgy in 38 fractions ) for local recurrence of meningioma .

( a ) atypical cells having round - to - oval nuclei , with prominent nucleoli and frequent mitoses in the nasal cavity recurring tumour .
( b ) the metastatic tumour had a higher mitotic index ( up to 40 mitoses within 10 hpf ) and ki - 67 labeling index ( 40 %) than the primary tumour ( x400 , h & e ) .
( c ) geographic tumoural necrosis and hemorrhage ( x400 , h & e ) .
two months after local recurrence , subcutaneous tumors were found located on the left anterior chest wall ( 1.5 x 1.2 cm ) and left parietal region ( 0.5 x 0.4 cm ) .
the tumors were removed under local anesthesia .
histological examination showed morphological characteristics similar to the primary tumor ( figure 4b ) ; however , the mitotic index ( up to 40 mitoses within 10 hpf ) and ki - 67 labeling index ( 40 %) were higher than those of the primary counterpart .
foci of geographic necrosis were also found ( figure 4c ) .
the tumor was classified as a malignant ( who grade iii ) meningioma .
after radiation therapy , the nasal cavity tumor shrank markedly .
however , 2 weeks after the radiation therapy , multiple small subcutaneous tumors occurred over the entire body .
at that time , the patient was very debilitated and did not want any other intensive treatment .
he was transferred to a palliative care facility and died 3 months later .
conclusions primary extracranial meningiomas of the nasal cavity are extremely rare .
to date , about 36 cases have been reported [ 5,11,12 ] .
the origin of pems is unclear .
pems are thought to arise from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells that get trapped or misplaced in intraosseous locations [ 13 ] .
conceivably , pems could arise from undifferentiated arachnoid cap cells associated with blood vessels or cranial nerves traversing the skull [ 14 ] .
atypical meningioma is a rare variant .
according to who criteria , meningiomas are classified into three grades .
most meningiomas are benign ( who grade i ) ; 5 - 15 % of meningiomas are atypical ( who grade ii ) ; and 1 - 2 % are anaplastic / malignant ( who grade iii ) [ 15 ] .
atypical meningiomas are diagnosed when increased mitotic activity ( defined as >= 4 mitoses / 10 hpf ) or three or more of the following features are encountered : increased cellularity , small cells with a high nucleus : cytoplasm ratio , prominent nucleoli , uninterrupted patternless or sheet - like growth , and necrosis [ 16 ] .
malignant meningiomas ( who grade iii ) exhibit histological features of malignancy , including obviously malignant cytology ( e.g. , an appearance similar to sarcoma , carcinoma , or melanoma ) and / or a high mitotic index (>= 20 mitoses / 10 hpf ) [ 16 ] .
moreover , malignant meningiomas are usually fatal and have a higher rate of recurrence and metastasis [ 15 ] than the benign variant .
perry et al .
[ 17 ] showed that the median survival time for malignant meningiomas was 1.5 years , with a 5 - year mortality rate of 68 % .
the incidence of metastases in meningiomas is very low .
although surgical removal may increase the risk of iatrogenic metastases of histologically aggressive meningiomas [ 18 ] , malignant meningiomas can disseminate with no previous surgery [ 19 ] .
the reported incidence of distant metastases in malignant meningioma is around 43 % [ 20 ] .
the mode of metastatic spread is unclear .
three possible dissemination patterns have been described : hematogenous , lymphatic , and via the csf [ 20 ] .
in pems , the likely routes of distant metastases are venous and lymphatic , because pems have no intracranial attachments .
metastasis via the venous system usually causes pulmonary , hepatic , and skeletal metastases , while that via the lymphatic system causes lymph node and subcutaneous metastases [ 21 ] .
in this case , distant metastases were seen in the anterior chest wall and scalp 2 months after local recurrence .
however , with time , multiple subcutaneous tumors developed over the entire body , so it is possible that distant metastasis to vital organs , such as the lungs or liver , occurred .
we presented the case of a middle - aged male with distant metastasis from a pem of atypical histology originating from the nasal septum .
although classified histologically as atypical , the meningioma exhibited unusually aggressive behavior and transformed to a malignant meningioma after surgery .
additionally , it is known that meningiomas tend to become more histologically aggressive with each recurrence [ 21 ] .
in our case , this clinical characteristic was seen .
currently , complete surgical excision of pems is the treatment of choice and there is no need for adjuvant treatment [ 11 ] .
however , our case showed that tumors invade adjacent septal cartilage , and it has been reported that adjuvant radiotherapy contributed significantly to improvements in overall survival and recurrence - free survival in intracranial meningiomas with local tissue invasion [ 22 ] .
given their anatomical complexity and the fact that they are covered with mucosal epithelium , which has many vascular and lymphatic channels , pems in the nasal cavity have a higher risk of incomplete tumor resection .
therefore , routine postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and careful postoperative imaging may be necessary to improve the outcome in patients with atypical pems in the nasal cavity .

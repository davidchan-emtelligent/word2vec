we found that the temperature during post meiotic megagametogenesis ( zygotic embryogenesis ) and seed maturation shift the growth cycle program of the embryos in the seeds , resulting in significant and long lasting phenotypic changes in the progeny .
traits that are affected include the timing of dehardening and bud burst in the spring ; leader shoot growth cessation in the summer , and bud set and cold acclimation in the autumn .
all processes are advanced or delayed in correspondence with the temperature during female reproduction .
colder reproductive environment advance bud set and cold acclimation during autumn and dehardening and bud burst during spring in their progenies .
temperature dependent difference in timing of terminal bud formation in identical clones was equivalent to a 4 - 6degrees latitudinal ecotypic difference .
the progeny " remember " the temperatures and photoperiod prevailing during zygotic embryogenesis and seed maturation and this memory , affecting the climatic adaptation in this species , is an epigenetic phenomenon .
this phenomenon is not only of evolutionary significance but has clear practical implications .
this memory can help the conifer to cope with the anticipated rapid change in climatic conditions .
it will have importance for the deployment of seedlings produced in seed orchards containing clones that are translocated to warmer sites , and it may be used to produce seedlings that have specific adaptive properties .
so , it is possible to produce distinct phenotypes ( epitypes ) in norway spruce , however this type of long lasting effects is not well documented in other organisms so far .
the molecular mechanism behind this striking epigenetic memory phenomenon is not yet unraveled but transcriptional changes are clearly involved .
in epigenetically different progenies , transcriptional analysis revealed that seedlings from full - sib families produced at different embryogenesis temperature under long and short day conditions differed .
suppressive subtracted cdna libraries revealed significant differences in their transcriptomes .
using qrt - pcr , microrna pathways genes padcl1 and 2 and pasgs3 as well as transposons related genes are differential expressed in the epigenetically different progenies with phenotypic differences in bud burst and bud set .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are endogenous small rnas that can exert epigenetic gene regulatory impacts .
we have examined the possible role of mirna in the epigenetic phenomena , and found that norway spruce contains a set of conserved mirnas as well as a large proportion of novel non - conserved mirnas. from concatemerized small rna libraries from seedlings from the same parents , originated from seeds developed in a cold and warm environment from a family with distinct epigenetic effects , contrasted to one from a family with little response , mirnas potentially involved in this epigenetic memory was identified .
most of the mirnas target unknown genes or genes with no known function .
the expression of seven conserved and nine novel mirnas showed significant differences in transcript levels in progenies with distinct epigenetic difference in bud set , but not in the progenies from a non - responding family , making them excellent candidate mirnas .
the differentially expression of specific mirnas in genetically identical but epigenetically different progeny indicate their putative participation in the epigenetic regulation .
epigenetic mechanisms influence phenotype through altered regulation of gene expression that is mitotically ( and sometimes meiotically ) propagated .
understanding the mechanisms involved in the initiation , maintenance , and heritability of epigenetic states is an exiting aspect of research in current biology .
epigenetic regulation may be realized through several interconnected molecular pathways including dna methylation , histone modification and chromatin remodeling , small non - coding rnas and transposable element regulation .
among spruce ests we found 64 homologs of genes described as involved in dna methylation , histone modification and chromatin remodeling and small rna biogenesis in other plant species .
in general , known epigenetic mechanism related genes are very well represented in the spruce genome .
we analyzed the transcription patterns of these genes using rt - pcr in epigenetically different zygotic embryogenic samples on different stages of development and in seedlings , originated from full - sib families clearly differed in epigenetic response .
the largest difference in gene expression of selected genes was found at the earlier stages of embryogenesis while in seedlings a low number of these genes were differentially expressed .
most of the known epigenetic mechanism related genes in seedlings were steadily expressed in all studied samples independently of their epitype .
to get a deeper analysis of epigenetic related transcriptome we used high - throughput sequencing ( rna - seq and mirna - seq ) in cooperation with genxpro gmbh .
using mace ( massive cdna 3'end sequencing ) deep mrna sequencing on the illumina gsii platform , we analyzed the genes differentially expressed in p. abies during early stages of embryonic development .
we selected genes which could be involved into epigenetic response by comparison warm and cold originated " embryonic epitypes " from the same full - sibs family somatic embryos developed in cold ( 18degreesc ) and warm ( 30degreesc ) environmental conditions .
additionally , for more distinct analysing of the large amount of " no database hit " reads we sequenced one normalised library using 454 titanium gs flx sequencing to get reference transcript set of expressed genes .
the sequencing data is currently under processing and we are going to discuss main results here .
to proceed with our initial study of mirnas in spruce , we used illumina / solexa sequencing to identify small rnas expressed at the same epigenetic responsive family developed in warm and cold environment progenies following short - day treatment .
the identification of novel mirna candidates are in progress and the confirmation of conserved and novel mirna by qrt - pcr analysis will be presented .

over the last century , intakes of omega - 6 ( omega - 6 ) fatty acids in western diets have dramatically increased , while omega - 3 ( omega - 3 ) intakes have fallen .
resulting omega - 6 / omega - 3 intake ratios have risen to nutritionally undesirable levels , generally 10 to 15 , compared to a possible optimal ratio near 2.3 .
we report results of the first large - scale , nationwide study of fatty acids in u.s. organic and conventional milk .
averaged over 12 months , organic milk contained 25 % less omega - 6 fatty acids and 62 % more omega - 3 fatty acids than conventional milk , yielding a 2.5 - fold higher omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio in conventional compared to organic milk ( 5.77 vs. 2.28 ) .
all individual omega - 3 fatty acid concentrations were higher in organic milk - - alpha - linolenic acid ( by 60 %) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( 32 %) , and docosapentaenoic acid ( 19 %) - - as was the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid ( 18 %) .
we report mostly moderate regional and seasonal variability in milk fatty acid profiles .
hypothetical diets of adult women were modeled to assess milk fatty - acid - driven differences in overall dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios .
diets varied according to three choices : high instead of moderate dairy consumption ; organic vs. conventional dairy products ; and reduced vs. typical consumption of omega - 6 fatty acids .
the three choices together would decrease the omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio among adult women by ~ 80 % of the total decrease needed to reach a target ratio of 2.3 , with relative impact " switch to low omega - 6 foods " > " switch to organic dairy products " =~ " increase consumption of conventional dairy products. " based on recommended servings of dairy products and seafoods , dairy products supply far more alpha - linolenic acid than seafoods , about one - third as much eicosapentaenoic acid , and slightly more docosapentaenoic acid , but negligible docosahexaenoic acid .
we conclude that consumers have viable options to reduce average omega - 6 / omega - 3 intake ratios , thereby reducing or eliminating probable risk factors for a wide range of developmental and chronic health problems .

introduction dairy products contribute significantly to dietary intakes of saturated fat in the united states and europe , which has led to widely endorsed recommendations to limit consumption of whole milk and other high - fat dairy products , in favor of low - and non - fat dairy products [ 1 ] .
however , these recommendations are based primarily on the serum - ldl (" bad ") - cholesterol - raising effect of dairy fat , a single marker of risk for cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
they give little or no consideration to the cvd - risk reducing components in milk fat , especially omega - 3 ( omega - 3 ) fatty acids ( fas ) , conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ) , the possibly beneficial trans fas , trans - 18:1 [ 2 ] and trans - 16:1 [ 3 ] , protective minerals , and a beneficial effect on serum hdl (" good ") cholesterol [ 4 ] .
two recent reviews of epidemiological evidence question common beliefs about the health effects of dairy fat .
one finds a contradiction between the evidence from long - term prospective studies and perceptions of harm from the consumption of dairy products [ 5 ] .
the other review highlights inconsistent evidence of harm [ 4 ] .
most of the reviewed studies began before low - fat dairy products became widely used .
these reviews conclude that high consumption of milk and milk fat may be overall neutral [ 4 ] or beneficial [ 5 ] regarding all - cause mortality , ischemic heart disease , stroke , and diabetes .
most recently , ludwig and willett have questioned the scientific basis for recommending reduced - fat dairy products [ 6 ] .
additional studies have linked dairy fat consumption to diminished weight gain [ 7 ] , attenuated markers of metabolic syndrome , including waist circumference [ 8 ] , and reduced risk of cvd [ 9 ] and colorectal cancer [ 10 ] .
milk products are good sources of many nutrients , including several of concern in at least some u.s. population cohorts - - calcium , potassium , vitamin d ( in fortified milk products ) , vitamin b12 , and protein [ 1 ] , [ 11 ] .
alpha - linolenic acid ( ala ) and other omega - 3 fa are also of concern , and are well recognized in milk products [ 12 ] , but some major reviews do not mention dairy sources [ 1 ] , [ 11 ] .
there is increasing evidence that the dietary balance of omega - 3 and omega - 6 fa is perhaps as important as the dietary proportions of saturated , monounsaturated , and total fat [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
health concerns stemming from increasing dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios have stimulated research on ways to improve the fa profile of common foods , including milk and dairy products [ 15 ] - [ 23 ] .
changes in dietary fa intakes during the last century have been brought about largely by : ( a ) increased consumption of major vegetable oils [ 13 ] , [ 24 ] , and ( b ) generally low consumption of oily fish , vegetables , fruits , and beans [ 25 ] .
average dietary ratios of these two classes of polyunsaturated fa in the u.s. have increased from about 5 to about 10 , with some ratios in excess of 20 [ 13 ] , [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] .
the omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio in human breast milk has also increased dramatically in this time period , driven by changes in maternal dietary ratios [ 28 ] .
although the optimal omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio depends on the health measure in question and genetic factors [ 13 ] , some authors have suggested a target ratio of 2.3 .
at this ratio , the conversion of ala to long - chain omega - 3 docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) is thought to be maximized [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
in addition , epidemiological studies have reported no further cvd - prevention benefits from lowering the omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio below ~ 2.3 [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] .
milk from cows consuming significant amounts of grass and legume - based forages contains higher concentrations of omega - 3 fas and cla than milk from cows lacking routine access to pasture and fed substantial quantities of grains , especially corn [ 15 ] - [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] .
in turn , lactating women consuming such milk have an increased cla concentration in their breast milk [ 33 ] .
the balance of fas in animal - derived foods like milk depends on the animal 's dietary lipid intake and on its digestive physiology .
the relationship between diet composition and lipid transfer into milk , meat and eggs has been reviewed by woods and fearon [ 34 ] .
the rumen in dairy cattle influences the suitability of different feeds and also has a major impact on the nature of fas absorbed and ultimately secreted into milk .
pigs and poultry , like humans , have a relatively simple digestive system and absorb fas in approximately the same proportions as found in their diet .
lipid absorption by cattle and sheep is heavily influenced by rumen microbial activity that hydrogenates ( saturates ) up to 95 % of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) , making it challenging to increase the pufa content of ruminant milk or meat .
however , increased reliance on fresh herbage in dairy cow diets does elevate the omega - 3 content of milk produced [ 15 ] - [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] .
the u.s. national organic program ( nop ) requires that lactating cows on certified organic farms receive at least 30 % of daily dry matter intake ( dmi ) from pasture during that portion of the year when pasture grasses and legumes are actively growing , with a minimum of 120 days per year [ 35 ] .
pasture and conserved , forage - based feeds account for most of the dmi year - round on a growing portion of organic dairy operations in the u.s .
[ 36 ] .
although several european studies have compared the composition of organic and conventional milk [ 18 ] - [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , there is limited comparative data from the u.s. also , published u.s. studies are based on relatively limited sampling and reflect milk production during only a portion of a year , hence providing no insight into seasonal changes in milk quality [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
the two main objectives of the present study were first , to quantify average , annual fa differences between organic and conventional milk in an extensive , 18 - month cross - u.s. survey , with attention to regional and seasonal variations , and second , to address the degree to which consumption of predominantly organic dairy products may enhance public health by decreasing dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios from today 's generally unhealthy levels [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 28 ] - [ 31 ] , [ 37 ] - [ 48 ] .
methods we selected 14 commercial milk processors from 7 regions throughout the u.s. that produce organic milk products , and usually also conventional milk , pasteurized by either the high - temperature - short - time method ( htst ) or by the ultra - high - temperature method ( uht , also known as ultra - pasteurization ) .
the processors were located in the northwest region ( 2 htst , 1 uht ) ; california ( 1 htst , 1 uht - - organic only ) ; rocky mountains ( 1 htst ) , texas ( 1 htst ) ; midwest ( 1 htst , 1 uht - - organic only ) ; mid - atlantic ( 1 htst , 1 uht - - organic only ) ; and northeast ( 1 htst , 2 uht ) .
these processors receive and market organic milk through the organic valley brand , the largest u.s. cooperative of organic farmers , based in la farge , wisconsin .
because three of the uht processors produce only organic milk , we obtained more organic than conventional samples , and more uht organic samples than uht conventional samples. from each processor we obtained one fresh , whole - milk sample nominally every month for 18 months , january 2011 through june 2012 .
a total of 220 organic and 164 conventional samples were taken from either 1 - gallon or half - gallon retail containers , transferred to sterile plastic bottles , refrigerated , and shipped with frozen ice packs by overnight courier to silliker , inc. , an iso / iec 17025 accredited lab in chicago heights , illinois .
analyses for fa and total fat used method aoac 996.06 , revised 2001 [ 49 ] , with capillary column supelco sp - 2560 , 100 mx0.25 mm , 0.2 microm film .
the lab did not report non - quantifiable amounts defined as < 0.001 g / 100 g. statistical analysis digital laboratory data were transferred automatically to an excel spreadsheet and spot - verified by one of us against printed lab reports .
the data are available from authors mal and drd .
statistical analyses used ncss 2004 software ( kaysville , utah ) , plus excel 2003 for some descriptive statistics and t distributions .
excel results were verified with ncss [ 50 ] .
primary data were inspected with scatter plots and normal probability plots , and small numbers of clear outliers with large deviations from normality were removed as follows : first , 6 milk samples with total fat <= 2.52 and >= 4.17 g / 100 g , leaving 218 organic and 160 conventional samples ; then 7 extreme outlier values ( g / 100 g ) for individual fa 12:1 ( 0.046 ) , 18:2 linoleic acid ( la ) ( 0.006 ) , 20:1 ( 0.026 , 0.026 , 0.032 ) , and 20:5 ( eicosapentaenoic acid , epa ) ( 0.041 , 0.084 ) .
the removed outliers deviated from the respective fa means by 5 to 70 sds , and represent 0.07 % of all values examined .
differences between means were evaluated by 2 - tailed t test for approximately normal distributions or by 2 - tailed mann - whitney test , as indicated .
mann - whitney tests were used for non - normal distributions and those with insufficient numbers of samples to evaluate normality .
ideally our data would have been amenable to anova - based methods , but we chose alternative methods because of complex data that could not be consistently transformed to normality with equal variances , requiring both parametric and non - parametric methods .
there are also some 2 - and 3 - fold differences in the numbers of organic and conventional samples , and in the number of regional samples .
because of multiple comparisons of organic vs. conventional fa concentrations in 2 tables , about 2 findings of p = 0.05 and 0.5 finding of p = 0.01 can be expected there by chance alone , but our key findings are highly significant ( p < 0.0001 ) and not vulnerable to type - i errors ( incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis ) .
to prevent or minimize potentially biased statistical comparisons caused by possible correlation between monthly fa concentrations , we limited statistical comparisons of monthly data between organic and conventional samples to individual months or groups of 6 months .
to compare coefficients of variation we used the method by forkman [ 51 ] .
we calculated u.s. average fatty acid concentrations and ratios as means of samples from all 12 months in 2011 and all 7 geographical regions , calculated separately for organic and conventional samples .
for regional concentrations and ratios , we averaged all 12 monthly samples separately for each region and for both production methods .
similarly , we calculated seasonal concentrations and ratios by averaging samples from all 7 geographical regions , separately for 18 months in 2011 - 2012 and for both production methods .
the numbers of samples are shown in the resulting tables , figures , or figure caption .
three ratios of fas in conventional versus organic milk are reported .
la / ala is the simplest ratio and represents the major omega - 6 and omega - 3 fas in milk and human diets .
the most commonly encountered ratio of omega - 6 and omega - 3 fas is total omega - 6 / total omega - 3 , where the totals may include , besides la and ala , arachidonic acid ( aa , omega - 6 ) , epa ( omega - 3 ) , dha ( omega - 3 ) and possibly docosapentaenoic acid ( dpa ) ( omega - 3 ) and other minor fas .
our inclusive ratio omega - 6 / omega - 3 includes primarily la ( omega - 6 ) , 8,11,14 - eicosatrienoic acid ( 20:3 , omega - 6 ) , aa ( omega - 6 ) , ala ( omega - 3 ) , epa ( omega - 3 ) , and dpa ( omega - 3 ) , plus infrequently reported , small amounts of 18:3 gamma - linolenic acid ( omega - 6 ) , 20:2 eicosadienoic acid ( omega - 6 ) , 22:2 docosadienoic acid ( omega - 6 ) , 22:4 docosatetraenoic acid ( omega - 6 ) , 18:4 moroctic acid ( omega - 3 ) , 20:3 11,14,17 - eicosatrienoic acid ( omega - 3 ) , and dha ( omega - 3 ) .
to more fully reflect the variations in levels of health - promoting dairy fas , we include a third ratio in which we add to the omega - 3 total the amount of cla ( 18:2 conjugated ) .
this fa is widely accepted as beneficial for heart health and prevention of cancer [ 52 ] - [ 54 ] .
diet scenarios and la / ala ratios to estimate the impact on dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios of replacing conventional with organic dairy products , we calculated la / ala ratios for hypothetical diets of moderately active women , age 19 - 30 , selected in part because of the importance of omega - 3 fa during women 's child - bearing years .
we limited this estimate to la and ala , because of the lack of reliable u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) composition data for epa , dpa , and dha in non - dairy foods .
in addition , la accounts for 90 % of total omega - 6 in both organic and conventional milk , and ala accounts for 79 % to 80 % of total omega - 3 .
our estimated impacts on la / ala of a switch from conventional to organic dairy foods underestimates the full array of health benefits following such a switch , because cla and long - chain , omega - 3 fas fall outside the la / ala ratio .
table 1 shows model diets containing hypothetical servings of 4 common dairy foods in 3 diet scenarios - - low - fat , average - fat , and high - fat ( respectively 20 % , 33 % , and 45 % of energy from fat ) .
except for the low - fat scenario , the " moderate dairy intakes " follow the recommended 3 daily servings of milk and milk products in the dietary guidelines for americans [ 1 ] .
the moderate - dairy , low - fat scenario uses reduced amounts of 3 of the 4 dairy foods , thereby reducing its content of fat and other nutrients from dairy products , e.g. , for calcium , from 1040 mg to 850 mg .
( however , the reduced dairy intake adds nutrients from 128 kcal of additional non - dairy foods needed to keep total energy at 2,100 kcal. ) to quantify the likely maximum benefit possible from consuming milk products with enhanced fa profiles , we use whole milk and full - fat cheese in the diet scenarios , instead of reduced - fat versions .
for the recommended 3 cups fluid milk equivalent we use 1.5 cups milk + 1.5 ounces cheese ( 1 cup fluid milk equivalent ) + 6 ounces low - fat yogurt with fruit ( about 0.5 cup fluid milk equivalent ) .
ice cream is categorized separately as " dairy dessert " [ 1 ] .

8.79 kcal / g dairy fat .
in table 1 " energy from fat " = 2100 kcal for a moderately active woman [ 1 ] x 20 % , 33 % or 45 % ; " energy from dairy fat " = serving weight x fat content / 100 gx8.79 kcal / g , summed over the 4 foods , using the footnoted values from usda 's national nutrient database for standard reference [ 55 ] ; " energy from other fat " = " energy from fat " - " energy from dairy fat. " we converted the dairy and non - dairy fat - energy values from table 1 into fat weights using usda 's 8.79 kcal / g for dairy fat and 8.9 kcal / g for typical non - dairy fat , and then calculated the amounts of la and ala contained in these dairy and non - dairy sources .
for dairy fat , we used the average amounts of la , ala , and total fas found in this research , plus the conversion from milk fa weight to milk fat weight ( 0.933 g fa / g fat ) [ 56 ] .
for non - dairy fat , we used usda data to calculate the amounts of la and ala per 100 kcal of fat in 8 foods - - mcdonald 's french fries , plain tortilla chips , higher - fat chocolate chip cookies , soy oil ( salad or cooking ) , regular stick margarine , ground chicken , composite pork cuts , and ground beef ( 15 % fat ) .
we selected these 8 foods because they are commonly consumed and usda reports amounts of their fully differentiated la ( cis,cis - 18:2 n - 6 ) and ala ( cis,cis,cis - 18:3 n - 3 ) [ 55 ] .
on average they contain 23.23 g la and 1.841 g ala per 100 kcal fat , which we used to calculate the amount of la and ala in " other " ( non - dairy ) fat in table 1 .
to estimate the effect of reducing la intakes , we made substitutions for 3 of the above 8 foods - - pita chips instead of tortilla chips ( la / ala = 20 , instead of 40 for tortilla chips ) , canola oil instead of soy oil , and canola oil margarine instead of regular margarine , all with available fully differentiated data for la and ala [ 55 ] .
these 3 substitutions yield average contents for non - dairy fat of 13.84 g la ( a 40 % reduction ) and 2.731 g ala ( a 48 % increase ) per 100 kcal of fat .
fatty acids in fish compared to other sources the dietary guidelines for americans [ 1 ] recommend consumption of about 8 ounces per week of a variety of fish ( about twice the average u.s. consumption ) , with up to 12 ounces per week for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding .
the fish varieties may include those with higher and lower amounts of epa and dha , but should include some with higher amounts , to achieve an average intake of 250 mg / day of epa + dha .
because fish also contain la , ala , and dpa , we used usda data [ 55 ] to estimate the amounts of these 5 fas in fish and compared them with amounts in the dairy products and non - dairy sources used in our dietary scenarios .
we selected 7 representative fish with available data for fully differentiated ala and ( in most cases ) la. results table 2 shows fa concentrations in conventional and organic milk , averaged over a full calendar year of milk production ( 2011 ) .
the complete 18 - month test period through june 2012 is used to assess seasonal variations .
table 2 includes sums of saturated , monounsaturated , and polyunsaturated fa , as well as omega - 3 , omega - 6 , and trans fa , plus cla , cla + ala , and various ratios of fa levels , such as la / ala and omega - 6 / omega - 3 .
fa names include the number of carbon atoms followed by a colon and the number of double bonds .
table 2 also shows descriptive statistics , including coefficients of variation ( cv = sd / mean ) , a measure of nationwide percentage variation during 2011 .
supplemental table s1 reports the same values expressed as a percentage of total fas .
as expected , percentage variations ( cvs ) tend to be smaller in table s1 than in table 2 , especially for the dominant fractions , total saturated fa (~ 67 %) and monounsaturated fa (~ 25 %) .
supplemental figures s1 and s2 illustrate key concentrations and ratios .

because of multiple comparisons , about 2 findings of p = 0.05 and 0.5 finding of p = 0.01 can be expected by chance .
+ these group means ( means of sums of saturated , monounsaturated , or polyunsaturated fa ) are biased slightly low , because they include some sums containing unreported small values (< 0.001 ) treated as zero .
in contrast , when n is less than the number of samples ( organic n < 143 , conventional n < 108 ) , means of individual fa are biased slightly high by omission of unreported small values .
thus these group means are slightly less than the sum of means of the individual fa .

s the trans fa group mean exceeds the sum of individual trans fa , because it includes small amounts of trans - 14:1 omitted from the table due to small numbers of reported values ( 42 organic , 27 conventional ) .
there were small or negligible differences between organic and conventional milk in total fas (< 1 % , not statistically significant ) , and in total saturated ( 4 % higher in organic ) , monounsaturated ( 7 % lower in organic ) , and trans fas ( 2 % lower in organic , not statistically significant ) .
however , 12 - month - average concentrations of total pufas , total omega - 6 , and la were significantly higher in conventional compared to organic milk ( by 11 % , 33 % , and 34 % respectively , all p < 0.0001 ) , while concentrations of total omega - 3 , ala and cla were significantly higher in organic compared to conventional milk ( by 62 % , 60 % , and 18 % respectively , p < 0.0001 , < 0.0001 , and < 0.001 ) .
similarly , 12 - month average concentrations of the more active , longer - chain omega - 3 fas epa and dpa were significantly higher in organic milk compared to conventional milk ( 33 % and 18 % respectively , both p < 0.001 ) .
data for dha are not shown , because over the 18 months of testing , quantifiable levels (>= 0.001 g / 100 g ) were found in only 4 of 218 organic and 2 of 160 conventional samples .
our results are similar to other studies that report significant levels of epa and dpa in dairy products , but little or no dha [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] .
circulating epa and dha in cow blood are believed to have extremely low uptake in the udder .
it is speculated that epa , but very little dha , is synthesized de novo in the udder , and that this synthesis is the primary source of epa in cow milk [ 57 ] .
as a result of the observed composition differences , the 2011 average ratios la / ala , omega - 6 / omega - 3 , and omega - 6 /( omega - 3 + cla ) are much higher in conventional compared to organic milk - - 2.4 - fold higher for la / ala , 2.5 - fold higher for omega - 6 / omega - 3 , and 2.0 - fold higher for omega - 6 /( omega - 3 + cla ) ( table 2 , all p < 0.0001 ) .
regional differences national 12 - month averages show a few clear differences between regions in both the concentrations of la , ala , and cla ( figure 1 ) and in the fa ratios la / ala , omega - 6 / omega - 3 , and omega - 6 /( omega - 3 + cla ) ( figure 2 ) .
most notably , conventional milk from california ( ca ) ( represented in this study by its far northern humboldt county ) is unusually low in la and high in ala and cla , and it has a fa profile similar to nationwide organic milk .
conversely , conventional milk from the mid - atlantic region has unusually high ratios of la / ala and omega - 6 / omega - 3 .
one - way analyses of variance among regions for conventional milk do not consistently conform to assumptions of normality and equal variance , but they suggest that values for the ca region differ from all other regions with high reliability ( p < 0.000001 , anova of log - transformed data , followed by tukey - kramer pair - wise comparisons ) .
for other comparisons of possible interest in figures 1 and 2 , two values are likely reliably different ( p < 0.05 ) if their se error bars are well separated in vertical position .

for la and ala , all differences between organic and conventional contents are statistically significant by mann - whitney test ( p < 0.005 ) except for the ca region ( p >= 0.10 ) .
for cla no such differences are statistically significant ( p > 0.08 ) except for the ne region and all regions ( p < 0.001 ) .

for some measures in figures 1 and 2 , variability among regions is notably larger for conventional compared to organic samples , as measured by cvs of the regional means .
even excluding the most variable values for conventional milk from ca , cvs are about 3 - fold larger in conventional compared to organic samples for ala ( 23 % vs. 7.6 % , p = 0.02 ) , la / ala ( 25 % vs. 8.8 % , p = 0.03 ) , and omega - 6 / omega - 3 ( 29 % vs. 8.9 % , p = 0.015 ) .
for cla , there is an opposite trend toward greater regional variability in organic milk ( cv = 18 % vs. 8.2 % without ca , p = 0.08 ) .
there is negligible difference in regional variability for la ( organic 6.5 % vs. conventional 7.2 % without ca , p = 0.8 ) .
seasonal differences figure 3 shows monthly variations in the national average composition of organic and conventional milk over the full 18 months of the study .
concentrations of la and ala , and the differences between them , are similar across time ( figures 3a and 3b ) .
in contrast , there is substantial seasonal variation in cla , especially in organic milk ( figure 3c ) .
we compared the national average cla concentrations during the " summer " calendar months of may - october ( may - oct .
2011 and may - june 2012 ) with those during the " winter " months of november - april ( jan .
- apr. and nov .

in organic milk the cla concentration was 55 % higher in summer than in winter , with averages +/ - se ( in mg / 100 g ) of 0.0283 +/ - 0.0008 in summer vs. 0.0183 +/ - 0.0005 in winter ( p = 0.000000 by mann - whitney test , n = 96 and 122 respectively ) .
in conventional milk the summer increase was a much smaller 12 % ( 0.0200 +/ - 0.0006 vs. 0.0179 +/ - 0.0003 mg / 100 , p = 0.0074 , n = 67 and 90 ) .

b : alpha - linolenic acid ( ala , omega - 3 ) .
c : conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ) .
the number of monthly samples in all panels is 10 to 13 for organic and 7 to 10 for conventional milk , except 5 conventional in october 2011 .
for la and ala , all differences between organic and conventional contents are statistically significant by mann - whitney test ( p < 0.02 ) .
we also compared the above national average cla concentrations between organic and conventional samples , separately by season .
in the summer months the organic average was 42 % higher ( 0.0283 +/ - 0.0008 vs. 0.0200 +/ - 0.0006 mg / 100 g , p = 0.000000 by mann - whitney test , n = 96 and 67 respectively ) .
but in the winter months the difference between organic and conventional samples was negligible ( respectively 0.0183 +/ - 0.0005 vs. 0.0179 +/ - 0.0003 mg / 100 g , p = 0.86 , n = 122 and 90 ) .
averaged over the full year of 2011 , the cla concentration was 18 % higher in organic compared to conventional samples ( table 2 ) .
similarly for ala in organic milk , figure 3 shows a small ( 4 %) but statistically significant increase in summer compared to winter ( 0.0262 +/ - se 0.0003 vs. 0.0252 +/ - se 0.0003 mg / 100 g , p = 0.022 , by mann - whitney test , n = 95 and 122 ) .
a corresponding 2.6 % summer increase in conventional milk is not statistically significant ( p = 0.54 , n = 69 and 96 ) .
differences between organic and conventional milk are highly reliable in both summer and winter ( p = 0.000000 ) and reliable for each of the 18 months ( p <= 0.020 ) .
for la , we find no evidence for seasonal variability in national averages for either organic or conventional milk ( p = 0.13 and 0.85 , respectively , by mann - whitney tests ) .
however , la differences between organic and conventional milk are highly reliable in both summer and winter ( p = 0.000000 ) and reliable for each of the 18 months ( p <= 0.017 ) .
in figure 3 the smaller variability of 18 monthly means in organic compared to conventional milk is statistically significant for ala ( cv = 5.2 % vs. 9.8 % , p = 0.014 ) , but not for la ( cv = 3.7 % vs. 4.2 % , p = 0.58 ) .
for cla monthly variability is larger in organic samples , 24 % vs. 10 % , p = 0.0013 .
diet scenarios and la / ala we analyzed a series of diet scenarios to assess the impact of conventional and organic dairy products on total dietary la / ala ratios ( see table 1 ) .
the top half of table 3 shows the resulting intakes of la and ala in hypothetical diets for an adult woman consuming an average portion of energy from fat ( 33 %) and typical non - dairy fat sources .
the highest la / ala ratio of 11.3 occurred in the diet with moderate amounts ( 3 servings per day , fluid milk equivalent ) of conventional whole milk and other mostly full - fat dairy products .
compared to this baseline value , the ratios decreased to 10.0 with either a switch to organic dairy products or a 50 % increased consumption of conventional dairy products ( 4.5 servings per day , fluid milk equivalent ) .
a combination of both changes ( high intake of organic dairy products ) reduced the la / ala ratio to 7.8 .
expressed as a percentage of the reduction needed to reach a goal of la / ala = 2.3 , either change alone ( switch to organic or increase in conventional dairy consumption ) achieves about 15 % of the needed reduction , and a dual switch to organic and increased consumption of organic dairy products accomplishes about 40 % of the necessary reduction .

corresponding calculations for low - la non - dairy fat use 13.84 g la and 2.731 g ala per 100 kcal non - dairy fat .
the bottom half of table 3 shows the effects of the same variations in types and amounts of milk in the context of a diet with reduced amounts of la from non - dairy sources .
in these low - la scenarios , we substituted pita chips for tortilla chips , canola oil for soy oil , and canola - oil margarine for regular margarine , with no change in french fries , chocolate chip cookies , chicken , pork , or beef .
these reductions in la intake consistently reduced the overall dietary la / ala ratios to about 4 or 5 , or 68 % to 80 % of the way toward 2.3 , even with moderate consumption of conventional , mostly full - fat dairy products .
figure 4 shows the above percentages of progress toward an la / ala ratio of 2.3 , along with the results of additional scenarios in which we varied the baseline intake of total fat ( to 20 % and 45 % of energy , in addition to 33 % .

discussion this study is the first large - scale , national milk - fat composition survey in the u.s. comparing milk from organic and conventional farms .
the results are based on 378 samples of organic and conventional milk from 7 regions collected over 18 months .
the sampling protocol allows assessment of the impacts of organic and conventional production systems on milk fa composition , as well as regional and seasonal differences .
a key finding is that the nationwide average ratios of la / ala and omega - 6 / omega - 3 in 2011 were 2.6 and 2.3 respectively for organic milk samples , compared to 6.3 and 5.8 for the samples from cows on conventionally managed dairies ( p < 0001 ) .
although the omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio of both conventional and organic dairy fat is healthier than the ratio of most other commonly consumed fat sources , full - fat organic dairy products offer clear advantages for individuals striving to reduce their overall dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio .
this study confirms earlier findings that milk from cows consuming significant amounts of grass and legume - based forages contains less la and other omega - 6 fas and higher concentrations of ala , cla , and the long - chain omega - 3s epa and dpa , compared to cows lacking routine access to pasture and fed substantial quantities of grains [ 17 ] - [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 58 ] .
in most countries , lactating cows on organically managed farms receive a significant portion of daily dmi from pasture and conserved , forage - based feeds [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , while cows on conventional farms receive much less .
in the most recent u.s. government dairy sector survey , only 22 % of cows had access to pasture [ 59 ] , and for most of these , access was very limited in terms of average daily dmi .
the greater regional variation in conventional compared to organic milk ( figs. 1 and 2 ) likely arises from large regional variations in the feed sources in lactating cow rations .
for example , conventional dairy farms near vegetable oil , soy biodiesel , or ethanol plants are likely to feed byproducts from these plants [ 60 ] .
other farms might rely on brewers dried grain ( from malting barley ) or a wide range of food processing wastes .
organic dairy operations , in contrast , are much more dependent on relatively uniform pasture and forage - based feeds , in part because of the grazing requirement in the nop rule [ 35 ] .
also , certified organic sources of most processing wastes and byproduct feeds are not available in substantial quantities .
the fa similarities between conventional and organic milk from our ca region ( figs. 1 and 2 ) were unexpected .
these conventional and organic milk samples came from the humboldt county area in far northern ca , a coastal region where both types of dairy farms graze cattle for over 250 days per year .
this heavy reliance on pasture contrasts sharply to the near - zero access to pasture on most conventional dairy farms throughout ca 's central valley ( the major dairy production region in ca ) [ 61 ] .
in the u.k. and much of europe , cows on conventional farms have routine access to grazing , although less so than cows on organic farms in the u.s. in a study of organic and conventional dairy farms in north england , grazing accounted for 37 % of average dmi on 29 organic farms , compared to 20 % on conventional outdoor farms and 3 % on conventional indoor operations ( annual averages ) [ 19 ] .
during the cold season , indoor - period organic dairy diets had a higher ratio of conserved forage to concentrate compared to conventional dairy diets [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] .
on most u.s. organic dairy farms , pasture and on - farm , forage - based feeds account for more than 30 % to well over one - half of daily dmi for much of the year [ 36 ] .
in contrast , the proportion of fresh forage in conventional dairy diets has decreased continuously over the last 40 years in the u.s. grain - based " total mixed rations " now dominate the conventional u.s. dairy sector .
in 2007 , 94 % of dairy farms milking 500 or more cows fed a total mixed ration , as did 71 % of high - production dairies ( herd average > 20,000 pounds annual milk production per cow ) [ 59 ] .
the differences in feeding regimes between organic and conventional dairy farms ( and associated impacts on milk composition ) would therefore be expected to be greater in the u.s. than in europe .
we find little seasonal variability in milk concentrations of la , ala , and cla , with the notable exception of cla in organic milk ( fig. 3 ) .
in organic milk , cla peaked during may through october and fell back in december through march to levels similar to conventional milk .
other studies show that cla levels are especially dependent on pasture feeding with immature , nutrient - rich grasses and legumes , and that any form of mechanical harvest and storage leads to some loss of forage quality , affecting especially the cla content of milk [ 15 ] , [ 19 ] .
these findings likely explain why cla levels in milk fall on most organic farms over the winter , and peak in the spring and summer , when pasture quality is optimized , and why there is little or no seasonal cla variation in milk from conventional cows with little access to pasture .
our results and others confirm that there are significant opportunities to improve the fa profile of milk and dairy products .
the potential human health benefits stemming from such improvements are less clear and must be evaluated in the context of overall dietary fa intakes and trends .
during the last century in the u.s. and other developed countries , increasing intakes of la from vegetable oils , especially soy oil used by food processors , account for most of the shift in typical omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios from a relatively healthy ~ 5 in the early 1900s to ~ 15 in much of europe [ 62 ] and around 10 to 15 in the u.s .
[ 13 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 63 ] .
la and ala are the main omega - 6 and omega - 3 pufas and account for respectively 84 % - 89 % and 9 % - 11 % of the total pufa intake in western diets [ 26 ] .
in contrast , intakes of the more potent , longer - chain omega - 3 fas such as epa , dpa , and dha are relatively low in most western diets , caused by low fatty fish intakes .
many studies and reviews have concluded that reducing dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios during adulthood will lower risks of cvd [ 14 ] , [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] , metabolic syndrome and diabetes [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 64 ] , overweight [ 7 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 62 ] , and violent behavior [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 65 ] .
one study reported that a group of adults with the highest plasma ala levels had ~ 30 % lower incidence of diabetes [ 44 ] , and a systematic review of lipid - lowering agents concluded that omega - 3 fas are as effective as statin drugs in lowering cvd risk [ 47 ] .
expected benefits from reduced dietary omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios , coupled with increased long - chain omega - 3 intakes , are almost certainly greatest for women hoping to bear a child , for pregnant women and their babies , and for infants and children through adolescence [ 45 ] - [ 48 ] .
high omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios and / or low long - chain omega - 3 intakes predispose the developing fetus to a wide range of adverse neurological and immune system disorders , and can also impair the visual system [ 66 ] .
recent research shows that high la / ala dietary ratios depress long - chain omega - 3 levels in the blood of pregnant women by two mechanisms - - by depressing the conversion of ala to long - chain omega - 3s and by blocking incorporation of pre - formed , long - chain omega - 3s into phospholipids [ 67 ] - [ 71 ] .
adults are able to convert a small fraction of ala to epa , dpa , and - - mainly in women - - to dha [ 67 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 70 ] , [ 72 ] - [ 75 ] .
however , excess dietary la competes with ala for the enzymes involved in these conversions [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] .
one study found that an la intake of 30 g / day reduces ala conversion to dha by ~ 40 % [ 71 ] , while others have shown that certain diets allow pre - menopausal women to convert up to 3 - fold more dpa to dha than males [ 68 ] .
accordingly , the improved la / ala ratio in organic milk ( 2.6 organic vs. 6.3 conventional ) secondarily benefits consumers by enhancing conversion of ala to long - chain omega - 3s .
fatty acids in fish compared to other sources table 4 shows that 8 ounces per week of a variety of fish ( represented by the 7 - fish average ) contains small amounts of la compared to dairy products , and only 12 % and 7 % as much ala as conventional and organic dairy products , respectively .
compared to the more dominant non - dairy sources of pufas , fish contributes negligible la and ala , and its average la / ala ratio of 6.5 is not distinctive .
an important implication is that recommended servings of fish cannot significantly alter u.s. dietary ratios of la / ala .
fish also cannot greatly alter omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios that are typically dominated by la and ala .
however , our dietary scenarios show how la / ala ratios and presumably omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios can be improved by changing the types and amounts of dairy fat , and especially by reducing la intake .
the most distinctive fa of fish in table 4 is dha , which does not occur in plant foods or significantly in cow 's milk .
fish is less unique for epa and not unique for dpa .
recommended amounts of dairy products , if mostly full - fat , contain about one - third as much epa as a mixture of fish varieties , and contain as much dpa - - or if organic , somewhat more dpa .
cla and other trans fatty acids although industrially - produced trans fas are recognized as generally harmful , cla and the other major trans fa in cow 's milk are probably beneficial or harmless to humans [ 76 ] .
the dominant cla in milk ( 75 % - 90 %) [ 16 ] is cis - 9,trans - 11 18:2 , known as rumenic acid and shown as " 18:2 conjugated " in table 2 .
because clas have probable benefits in humans [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] and proven benefits in animals [ 16 ] , [ 54 ] , the u.s. food and drug administration does not count them as trans fa for food labeling purposes [ 77 ] .
conventional dairy products account for about 75 % of u.s. cla consumption [ 16 ] , and organic production , especially spring pasture , is known to increase cla levels [ 18 ] - [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] .
we find an annual average 18 % increase .
the major trans fa in dairy fat is trans - 18:1 ( included in " trans - 18:1 incl .
elaidic " in table 2 ) , of which the dominant isomer ( 25 % - 75 %) is trans - 11 18:1 , vaccenic acid [ 16 ] .
at the high range of human intakes , vaccenic acid has little or no effect on cvd risk factors [ 78 ] .
humans convert about 20 % of it to the rumenic acid form of cla [ 16 ] .
in our samples , trans - 18:1 is reduced by 7 % in organic milk .
in human plasma , trans - 16:1 comes almost exclusively from dairy fat and ruminant meats and thus serves as a marker for consumption of these foods .
a recent study found that plasma levels are strongly associated with dairy fat consumption and also with broad health benefits - - reduced incidence of new - onset diabetes , favorable cvd risk profile , reduced insulin resistance and inflammation ( c - reactive protein ) , and slightly lower body fat [ 3 ] .
we find that trans - 16:1 is 12 % higher in organic compared to conventional milk .
organic dairy products and la / ala ratios in this study , organic production reduced the 12 - month - average omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio of whole milk from the conventional milk level of 5.77 to only 2.28 .
the 18 % higher level of cla in organic milk is an additional health benefit [ 52 ] - [ 54 ] , as are the generally higher levels of antioxidants in organic milk [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
but a key question remains - - is the shift in fa profiles in organic milk and dairy products sufficient to improve health outcomes ? and if so , by how much , and for whom ?
our dietary scenarios show that organic dairy products can improve dietary la / ala and omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios in adults .
because both conventional and organic dairy fat have omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratios superior to most other fat sources in typical western diets , replacing non - dairy fat with full - fat dairy products , whether conventional or organic , will improve total dietary la / ala ratios .
without other changes , increasing dairy fat intake would increase overall dietary fat and calories , an unwelcome outcome for most people .
but if coupled with reduced intakes of food products containing vegetable oils and / or other sources of saturated fat , overall fat content and energy intake can remain unchanged or even decline , while dramatically improving the diet 's ala content and omega - 6 / omega - 3 ratio .
the impact - - and importance - - of selecting low - la alternatives to high - la foods is unmistakable in our dietary scenarios ( table 3 and figure 4 ) .
they focus on women of childbearing age because of the heightened importance of adequate omega - 3 intakes during pregnancy and lactation , as well as the need for efficient conversion of ala to long - chain omega - 3s .
the scenarios suggest that the la / ala ratio can be reduced by ~ 30 % to 45 % of the way toward the target of 2.3 through high consumption of mostly full - fat organic dairy products , compared to moderate ( dietary guidelines ) consumption of corresponding conventional dairy products .
but when coupled with partial reduction of high - la foods , women can achieve ~ 80 % of the reduction needed to reach a target ratio of la / ala ~ 2.3 .
our scenarios may be summarized as follows : for adult women consuming typical - la non - dairy fat sources , an increase from moderate to 50 % higher intakes of conventional dairy products alone reduces dietary la / ala ratios by about 10 to 15 % of the way toward a target ratio of 2.3 .
alternatively , a switch to only moderate amounts ( 3 servings per day ) of mostly full - fat , organic dairy products achieves similar reductions .
the switch to 50 % higher amounts of organic dairy products adds a further roughly 25 % increment toward the 2.3 goal ( for a total increment near 40 %) .
the additional step of partially choosing low - la sources of non - dairy fats brings the overall reduction to ~ 75 - 80 % of the way toward the 2.3 goal .
we conclude that increasing reliance on pasture and forage - based feeds on dairy farms has considerable potential to improve the fa profile of milk and dairy products .
although both conventional and organic dairies can benefit from grazing and forage - based feeds , it is far more common - - and indeed mandatory on certified organic farms in the u.s .
- - for pasture and forage - based feeds to account for a significant share of a cow 's daily dmi .
moreover , improvements in the nutritional quality of milk and dairy products should improve long - term health status and outcomes , especially for pregnant women , infants , children , and those with elevated cvd risk .
the expected benefits are greatest for those who simultaneously avoid foods with relatively high levels of la , increase intakes of fat - containing dairy products , and switch to predominantly organic dairy products .

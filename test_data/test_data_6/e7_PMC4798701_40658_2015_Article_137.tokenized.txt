here , an automatic method to obtain an image - derived input function ( idif ) using mr - pet data is presented and several partial volume correction methods ( pvc ) are evaluated .
data from three tumour patients were acquired in a 3t mrbrainpet .
a bolus of 3mbq / kg of body weight of 18f - fet was administrated to each subject and a dynamic pet scan ( dpet ) was performed during 60min .
pet data were reconstructed in 23 frames with variable frame length using op - osem ( 32it , 4sub ) including all the corrections .
an mprage scan was acquired ( te / tr / ti = 3 / 2250 / 900 ms , fa = 9degrees ) .
five venous blood samples ( vbs ) were drawn at the later times later times each 10min .
to estimate an idif , internal carotid arteries were segmented automatically and these regions were transferred to dpet .
after , 4 post reconstruction pvc were applied and the impact of a scaling factor based on a single vbs was also evaluated based on the area under the curve ( auc ) .
all the tested pvc methods resulted in an under estimation of the auc at later frames which was mitigated after scaling with a vbs at 50 min .
in the earlier frames the different pvc resulted in different auc , which were not possible to validate .
the fully automated procedure presented allows one to obtain an idif without user interaction .
nevertheless , the initial findings regarding the pvc require further validation with a larger data set .

background in critically ill patients the incidence of invasive fungal infections caused by candida spp. has increased remarkably .
echinocandins are recommended as initial treatment for invasive fungal infections .
the safety and efficacy of micafungin compared to caspofungin is similar , but no comparison is made between anidulafungin and micafungin concerning safety and efficacy .
we therefore performed a retrospective study to assess these aspects in critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis .
methods all patients in the intensive care unit ( icu ) with invasive candidiasis , who were only treated with anidulafungin or micafungin , between january 2012 and december 2014 were retrospectively included .
baseline demographic characteristics , infection characteristics and patient courses were assessed .
results a total of 63 patients received either anidulafungin ( n = 30 ) or micafungin ( n = 33 ) at the discretion of the attending intensivist .
baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups , suggesting similar risk for developing invasive candidiasis .
patients with invasive candidiasis and liver failure were more often treated with anidulafungin than micafungin .
response rates were similar for both groups .
no difference was observed in 28 - day mortality , but 90 - day mortality was higher in patients on anidulafungin .
multivariable cox regression analysis showed that age and serum bilirubin were the best parameters for the prediction of 90 - day mortality , whereas apache ii , candida score and antifungal therapy did not contribute ( p > 0.05 ) .
none of the patients developed impaired liver function related to antifungal use and no differences were seen in prothrombin time , serum transaminases and bilirubin levels between the groups , after exclusion of patients with liver injury or failure .
conclusion micafungin can be safely and effectively used in critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis .
the observed increased 90 - day mortality with anidulafungin can be explained by intensivists unnecessarily avoiding micafungin in patients with liver injury and failure .
keywords critically ill micafungin anidulafungin invasive candidiasis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background the incidence of invasive fungal infections caused by candida spp. is increasing in critically ill patients [ 1 , 2 ] .
the latter is associated with prolonged duration of hospitalization and higher mortality rates [ 3 - 5 ] .
the mortality of invasive candidiasis is directly correlated with a delay in starting antifungal therapy and therefore early treatment with an appropriate antifungal drug is mandatory [ 6 , 7 ] .
a relatively novel class of antifungal agents are echinocandins which have activity against a broad spectrum of candida spp. , including c. glabrata and c. krusei , against which fluconazole has less activity [ 8 ] .
echinocandins are recommended as initial treatment for invasive candidiasis in patients with moderate to severe illness , keeping fluconazole reserved for less critically ill patients [ 9 ] .
the recommendation are based on prospective randomized clinical trials which demonstrated that all three echinocandins are at least as effective as fluconazole for the treatment of invasive candidiasis [ 10 - 15 ] .
the antifungal activity , pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of each echinocandin is slightly different , but the relevance of this finding remains unclear [ 16 ] .
both caspofungin and micafungin undergo hepatic metabolism , in contrast to anidulafungin , which undergoes spontaneous degradation [ 17 ] .
concerns about possible hepatotoxicity of micafungin have been raised which may affect its use in daily practice [ 2 ] .
two randomized controlled trials [ 16 , 18 ] and one retrospective observational trial [ 19 ] , compared the safety and efficacy of micafungin versus caspofungin in the treatment of invasive candidiasis , showing similar results in the safety and efficacy of micafungin compared with caspofungin .
one systematic review including 8,000 patients [ 20 ] and one observational cohort study with 8,696 patients [ 21 ] , evaluated the safety of micafungin versus other echinocandins , showing no increased risk of hepatic injury by micafungin .
both studies only evaluated the safety concerning hepatotoxicity of antifungal medication in mostly non - icu patients , but did not evaluate mortality or efficacy .
as far as we are aware there are no studies comparing the efficacy and safety of micafungin versus anidulafungin in critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis .
we performed a retrospective study to compare the safety and efficacy of micafungin versus anidulafungin in critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis .
methods patients we retrospectively gathered data from the patients' medical records using a predefined checklist. between january 1 , 2012 , and january 1 , 2015 , all patients over the age of 18 with invasive candidiasis and who only received anidulafungin or micafungin as systemic antifungal treatment in the intensive care unit ( icu ) of the erasmus university medical center rotterdam , were considered for participation .
candidemia was defined as at least one positive blood culture for candida spp. drawn from a peripheral vein .
invasive candidiasis was defined as a positive culture with candida spp. obtained from a normally sterile site , such as pleural or peritoneal fluid , in the context of pleural exsudate / empyema , and secondary or tertiary peritonitis following a ruptured viscus and surgery , respectively [ 22 ] .
in addition , patients needed to have one or more of the following signs and symptoms of infection : fever or hypothermia ; hypotension ; localized signs and symptoms of inflammation ; or radiological findings of invasive candidiasis. between january 2012 and december 2014 there were 124 patients diagnosed with invasive candidiasis of whom 20 received caspofungin , 38 stepped - down to fluconazole and 3 received both antifungals .
in total there were 63 patients with invasive candida spp. infection who only received anidulafungin or micafungin .
the dutch law states that informed consent is not required in case of retrospective analysis in which data collected during routine clinical care were used and anonymously analyzed .
clinical protocol patients were taken care of by attending intensivists according to national and local guidelines .
in our center selective decontamination of the digestive tract ( sdd ) is routinely used for patients with an expected duration of mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. this involves administration of an oral paste and of a suspension via the nasogastric tube , containing the non - absorbable antibiotics tobramycin , amphotericin - b and colistin .
patients also received cefotaxime intravenously at 4 times 1 g a day for a three - day period .
inventory cultures are taken of the throat , tracheal aspirates , and rectum as part of this protocol on admission .
to monitor the effect of sdd treatment , surveillance cultures ( from throat , tracheal aspirates , and rectum ) were routinely performed three times per week .
all sdd cultures were screened for the presence of gram - negative rods , and yeast that were identified to the species level ( see below ) .
in case a patient is suspected for having an infection , additional cultures ( besides the routinely sdd cultures ) can be taken from the possible source of infection , which includes the use of blood cultures .
all materials obtained from a normally sterile site were cultured onto relevant agar plates for the detection of both bacteria and yeast .
blood culture bottles , specific for the recovery of yeast ( bactec mycosis ic / f ) , that became positive were subcultured onto chocolate agar , sabouraud agar , and chromagartm to ensure purity or mixed infection and differentiation of yeast , and incubated at 35 degreesc .
auxacolor ( sanofi diagnostics pasteur ) or maldi - tof was used to identify the species level of a candida colony as soon as visible growth from a normally sterile site was observed .
susceptibility testing of isolates obtained from normally sterile sites was performed using a clsi broth microdilution method ( sensititre ( r ) , thermoscientific , usa ) and results for azoles , amphotericin b and caspofungin , were reported according to revised species - specific clsi clinical breakpoints .
for fluconazole , c. albicans was considered susceptible if the minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) was <= 2 mg / l , and reduced susceptibility was defined as a mic of >= 4 mg / l [ 23 ] , after 24 - 48 h of growth .
the decision to start an echinocandin was taken by the attending intensivist in collaboration with infectious disease specialist .
the initiation of antifungal therapy was based on clinical signs ( i.e. fever , hypothermia , hypotension , leukocytosis or leukopenia ) , risk factors for invasive candidiasis , culture results , radiological findings of invasive candidiasis , and according to published criteria [ 9 ] .
caspofungin was introduced in 2001 , followed by anidulafungin and micafungin respectively .
in case of severe liver injury and liver failure , which was defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of an abnormal liver function ( increased liver enzymes , hyperbilirubinemia , coagulopathy and encephalopathy ) , intensivists prefer anidulafungin over micafungin .
in all other instances , the choice between anidulafungin or micafungin was at the discretion of the attending intensivist .
for anidulafungin patients received an intravenous daily dose of 100 mg after an initial single loading dose of 200 mg. micafungin was administered at a dose of 100 mg intravenous once daily without a loading dose .
no dose adjustment was needed for body weight or impaired renal or hepatic function .
drainage of suspected pus collections as well as removal of iv catheters suspected to be the origin of infection was routinely done .
the duration of the antifungal therapy was decided in close collaboration with the infectious diseases physician , based on dutch invasive fungal infection guidelines which take several factors into account , such as duration of positive cultures , the certainty of good drainage and clinical improvement ( absence of fever for > 24 h , haemodynamic stability , and neutropenia ) [ 9 , 24 , 25 ] .
study protocol and data collection demographic data and clinical date were recorded on admission , including severity of illness scores , risk factors for invasive candida spp. infection ( neutropenia , recent surgery , diabetes mellitus , cancer , mechanical ventilation , renal replacement therapy , total parenteral nutrition , transplant and central venous catheters ) , the duration of icu stay , and mortality at day 28 and 90 after start of antifungal therapy .
patients were checked for abnormal liver function during antifungal therapy , serum aspartate transaminase ( ast ) and serum alanine transferase ( alt ) were recorded at start and stop of echinocandin treatment .
serum bilirubin , prothrombin time ( pt ) , ast , and alt peak values were recorded daily during echinocandin treatment .
at the start of echinocandin treatment a candida score was calculated for each patient to help , when > 3 , establishing the risk for invasive candidiasis vs colonization [ 26 ] .
the primary site of infection and the obtained culture results were recorded .
a global response at the end of treatment was defined as both clinical success ( cure - resolution of signs and symptoms of candida spp. infection , or improvement - incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms of candida spp. infection ) and microbiological success ( 2 negative follow - up cultures for candida spp. , or presumed eradication when the follow - up culture was not available and clinical response was defined as cure or improvement at the end of treatment ) .
the duration of candida spp. infection was defined as the period between the first positive culture and the first negative culture or icu death or discharge .
duration of treatment was defined as the period between initiation and stop of antifungal therapy or icu death or discharge .
statistical analysis continuous variables were presented with median and interquartile range because of the not normal distribution ( kolmogorov - smirnov test , p < 0.05 ) .
continuous data were examined with the mann - whitney u test and categorical data with the fisher exact test .
the kaplan - meier estimation of survival curves ( compared by log rank tests ) and multivariable cox regression were used for survival analysis .
all reported p values are two - tailored .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
results sixty - three patients with invasive candidiasis received either anidulafungin ( n = 30 ) or micafungin ( n = 33 ) .
patients using anidulafungin were more often on renal replacement therapy ( table 1 ) .

the average candida score was 3 for both groups .
anidulafungin was initiated at median day 3 and micafungin was initiated at median day 2 after icu admission .
there were no echinocandin - resistant strains .
four c. albicans isolates were considered less sensible to fluconazole with an average clinical breakpoint of 100 mg / l. there was no difference in the duration of treatment and infection , and response rates , even when corrected for liver failure .
both groups had a similar duration of icu stay .
no difference was observed in 28 - day mortality , but 90 - day mortality was higher in patients on anidulafungin ( table 2 and fig. 1 ) .
multivariable cox regression analysis showed that age ( hazard ratio 1.13 , 95 % confidence interval 1.02 - 1.23 , p = 0.02 ) and serum bilirubin ( hazard ratio 1.06 , 95 % confidence interval 1.01 - 1.12 , p = 0.03 ) were the best parameters for the prediction of 90 - day mortality , whereas apache ii , candida score and antifungal therapy did not contribute ( p > 0.05 ) .

liver enzymes and function in all patients who were treated with anidulafungin and micafungin ( a ) and in patients without liver failure ( b ) abbreviations : alt alanine transaminase , ast aspartate transaminase costs table 4 describes the involved costs for both treatment strategies .
the total treatment costs per patient seemed to be higher for micafungin , because of the longer treatment period .
however , the treatment costs per patient per day were lower for micafungin .

no differences were seen in response rates , liver function and enzymes , and mortality .
treatment with micafungin seems to be less expensive then that with anidulafungin .
echinocandins inhibit synthesis of the beta - ( 1 - 3 ) - d - glucan compound of the fungal cell wall and are considered as safe drugs [ 2 , 17 ] .
the overall efficacy between the three echinocandins is comparable , showing only little difference [ 27 ] .
nevertheless , the ema still recommend to only use micafungin in case other antifungals are not appropriate , as rat experiments suggested a potential risk for the development of liver tumors [ 27 ] .
however , these results were obtained from studies using high dosages for prolonged time in male animals , similar effects were not reported by other studies on humans or animals [ 17 ] .
both caspofungin and micafungin undergo hepatic metabolization , in contrast to anidulafungin , which undergoes spontaneous degradation [ 17 ] .
transient elevation of liver enzymes occurs in 2 to 15 % of patients treated with an echinocandin [ 28 ] .
in this study we found an elevation in serum ast of 38 % and 35 % , and an elevation in serum alt of 33 % and 29 % , in patients treated with anidulafungin or micafungin , respectively .
the observed incidence of elevated liver enzymes in this study is much higher , but equal between both groups of echinocandins , but we only looked at elevated liver enzymes in general and not specifically caused by the echinocandins .
abnormal liver function tests can be found in up to 61 % of critically ill patients , as caused by sepsis , drugs or ischemia [ 29 ] .
our results suggest that micafungin is as safe as anidulafungin concerning hepatotoxicity .
the results are in line with two previous studies , which both concluded that anidulafungin and micafungin had a low risk of elevated liver enzyme levels not requiring the cessation of treatment [ 20 , 21 ] .
both studies only evaluated the safety concerning hepatotoxicity of antifungal medication in mostly non - icu patients , but did not evaluate mortality or efficacy , as we did .
therefore , this study adds important information about the safety and efficacy of micafungin compared with anidulafungin in critically ill patients .
at day 28 the overall mortality was 60 % which is comparable to the mortality described in other studies [ 30 , 31 ] .
the data suggest that higher 90 - day mortality with anidulafungin than micafungin reflects more severe underlying liver disease rather than effect of treatment itself .
the type and duration of treatment of invasive candidiasis depends on culture results and sensitivity testing , the extent of organ involvement and patients' clinical condition [ 9 , 24 ] .
in patients with invasive fungal infections the recommended length of therapy is 14 days after the first negative blood culture [ 9 , 24 ] , which is in line with the observed median length of treatment of 12 - 14 days in this study .
the overall response rates in this study are comparable to those found in other performed studies [ 11 , 32 ] .
the overall response rate of micafungin is comparable to that of anidulafungin .
our retrospective data , concerning the safety and efficacy of micafungin are in line with a recent performed study , which evaluated the safety and efficacy of micafungin monotherapy in critically ill patients with cancer and invasive candidiasis [ 32 ] .
however , the study did not make a comparison with anidulafungin , as we did .
the pharmacokinetics of micafungin are very well defined in non - critically ill patients and seems to be similar in critically ill patients [ 33 ] .
in critically ill patients micafungin reaches a steady state by day 3 , without the need for a loading dose , in contrast to caspofungin and anidulafungin [ 9 , 24 , 25 , 33 ] .
dose adaptations are not required for body weight and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and renal replacement therapy [ 33 ] .
the involved costs per patient per day of treatment with micafungin seems to be a bit lower compared with anidulafungin .
one of the limitations of this study is the relatively small number of patients included , so that results should be regarded as preliminary .
this study enrolled 63 patients with invasive candidiasis caused by candida spp. in a four year period in a tertiary care icu with 2,000 admissions per year .
hence , the reported incidence of invasive candidiasis in a large review was 5 to 10 cases per 1,000 icu admission , which is comparable with our reported incidence of 6 per 1,000 icu admissions [ 34 ] .
second , because of the retrospective design we cannot exclude that the use of either agent may have been subject to bias .
conclusion in conclusion , our results suggest that micafungin can be safely and effectively used in critically ill patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis .

the data included in the study were reported in medical journals and met definite criteria for inclusion .
methods we collected cases of neurological complications of eclampsia reported in english - language medical journals from 1980 to 2008 .
the study methods include structural and frequency analysis of brain mrt / ct image protocols .
results the analyzed sample included 77 cases of neurological complications of eclampsia .
we extracted the following positions from the plain texts of mrt / ct descriptions : brain injury areas ( occipital , temporal , parietal and frontal lobes ) ; injury depth ( cortical and / or subcortical matter ) ; brain structures undergoing injury ( classification was too complicated ) ; injury nature ( vasogenic / ischemic edema , hemorrhage ) .
abnormalities in occipital ( 84.6 %) and parietal ( 70.7 %) lobes were the most frequent , injuries in temporal lobes were quite rare ( 26.9 %) , but damage in frontal lobes was the most uncommon ( 24.4 %) .
combined injury in occipital and parietal lobes was recorded in more than two - thirds of cases ( 72.4 %) .
combined injury in occipital - frontal lobes ( 29.3 %) and occipital - temporal ( 27.6 %) lobes were observed in almost one - third of patients .
synchronous injury in the temporal and frontal lobes was the least common ( 6.9 %) .
simultaneous damage of three and more lobes was observed quite rarely ( 14.6 %) .
most abnormalities were bilateral with frequency not less than 78.0 % .
unsymmetrical injury observed in some patients was located in the right lobe in most cases .
all analyzed cases include only 7.1 % of single left injury and all of them were located in the occipital lobe .
vasogenic edema occurred in 83.5 % of cases , while ischemic damage was observed in 10.4 % .
the incidence of hemorrhage was 6.1 % .
conclusion the analysis reveals a general picture of the most distinctive features of brain damage following neurological complications of eclampsia .

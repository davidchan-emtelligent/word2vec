insects require molting fluids to shed the old cuticle during molting .
beta - n - acetyl - d - hexosaminidase , known as hex1 , together with various chitinases , is responsible for degrading the chitin component of the old cuticle .
this study showed that another beta - n - acetyl - d - hexosaminidase , termed ofhex3 , interacted with hex1 and functioned in the molting fluid , although the homolog of ofhex3 was known as a sperm - plasma enzyme functioning in egg - sperm recognition .
ofhex3 is an enzyme cloned from the insect asian corn borer , ostrinia furnacalis , which is one of the most destructive pests of maize .
the enzymatic activity analysis indicated that ofhex3 was able to degrade chitooligosaccharides , but at a lower rate than that of ofhex1 .
because ofhex3 did not have substrate inhibition , we deduced that the presence of ofhex3 might help ofhex1 relieve substrate inhibition during chitin degradation during molting .
the expression patterns of ofhex3 during o. furnacalis development were studied by real - time pcr as well as western blot .
the results showed that both gene transcription and protein translation levels of ofhex3 were up - regulated during larval - larval molting .
the tissue - specific expression pattern analysis indicated that ofhex3 was mostly localized in the fat body and testis .
all these data further supported that hex3 was involved in molting as well as in fertilization .
this study may help to understand the complexity of cuticle degradation during insect molting , and may provide a possible target for pest control .

introduction molting is an important process in insect growth and development [ 1 ] .
to molt , an insect synthesizes and secrets molting fluids into a lumen located between the old and new cuticle [ 2 ] .
because chitin is the primary component of insect cuticle , one of the main functions of molting fluid is to hydrolyze this highly polymerized saccharide .
the chitinolytic activity of molting fluids was first reported in the exuvia fluid of bombyx mori ( lepidoptera ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , then two kinds of chitinolytic enzymes , previously termed endo - chitinase and exo - chitinase but now named chitinase ( ec3.2.1.14 ) and beta - n - acetyl - d - hexosaminidase ( hex ; ec 3.2.1.52 ) , respectively , were isolated and characterized .
chitinases degrade chitin into oligosaccharides , and hexes degrade oligosaccharides to n - acetyl - beta - d - glucosamine ( glcnac ) [ 4 ] .
insect genomes contain as many as seven genes encoding hex that function during different life processes .
these genes fall into four phylogenetic classes [ 5 ] .
the class i hexes ( hex1s ) possess chitinolytic activities and have been found in several insects [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
it occurs in dimeric and glycosylated form [ 6 ] .
studies of the enzymatic properties of hex1 from both manduca sexta ( lepidoptera ) and b. mori suggested that it could degrade ( glcnac ) 6 to glcnac [ 9 ] and was more active toward the synthesized substrate pnp - beta - glcnac ( p - nitrophenyl - n - acetyl - beta - d - glucosaminide ) than toward pnp - beta - ( glcnac ) 2 ( p - nitrophenyl - beta - d - chitobiose ) [ 6 ] .
the first crystal structure of an insect hex1 , ofhex1 from ostrinia furnacalis ( lepidoptera ) , provided an elegant structural explanation for why chitinolytic hex1s possess highly catalytic activity towards chitooligosaccharide substrates [ 10 ] .
the expression pattern of hex1 was also studied .
in m. sexta , mshex1 was mainly expressed in the epidermis on the sixth and seventh days of the fifth instar [ 11 ] .
in tribolium castaneum ( coleoptera ) , rna interference against tchex1 interrupted larval - larval , larval - pupal , and pupal - adult development [ 5 ] .
in choristoneura fumiferana ( lepidoptera ) , immunohistochemistry staining indicated that cfhex1 was localized in molting fluid , epidermis and trachea [ 12 ] .
taken together , these data demonstrated that hex1 is an enzyme involved in chitin degradation .
here , we cloned another hex , named ofhex3 , from the asian corn borer , o. furnacalis , an important lepidopteran pest of maize and cotton .
ofhex3 belongs to class iii hexes .
although previously reported class iii enzymes were involved in sperm - egg interaction [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , this study found that ofhex3 occurred with ofhex1 in molting fluids .
enzymatic activity and expression pattern both suggested that besides functioning in fertilization , ofhex3 worked with ofhex1 in cuticle degradation .
materials and methods molecular cloning and sequence analysis of ofhex3 total rna was isolated from fifth - instar larvae of o. furnacalis using rnaiso reagent ( takara , dalian , china ) .
cdna was synthesized using 3 ' - full race core set ver.2.0 ( takara ) from 2 microg total rna using random hexamer primers and oligo - ( dt ) as reverse transcript primers .
gene - specific primers were designed based on conserved sequences within insect hexes ( table s1 ) and used for pcrs ( figure s1 ) .
the 5 ' - and 3 ' - ends were obtained using 3 ' - full race core set ver.2.0 and 5 ' - full race kit ( takara ) , respectively .
the signal peptide of ofhex3 was predicted by signal p 4.0 program [ 17 ] .
structure - based multiple sequence alignments of ofhex3 and other insect hexes were performed with promals3d [ 18 ] using the crystal structure of ofhex1 ( pdb code : 3nsm ) as structure input .
sequence alignment was performed by using the software espript 2.2 [ 19 ] .
phylogenetic trees of insect hexes were constructed with mega 5 [ 20 ] using the neighbor - joining method with a 5,000 bootstrap replicates .
the structure model of the catalytic domain of ofhex3 was generated by modeller 9.10 [ 21 ] using the catalytic domain of ofhex1 as template [ 10 ] .
the best of 20 generated models was selected and refined using the loop refinement module in modeller 9.10 according to the reports by procheck [ 22 ] and verify _ 3d [ 23 ] .
the structure figure was prepared using pymol .
recombinant expression and purification of ofhex3 ofhex3 cdna lacking the first 54 nucleotides encoding the signal peptide was cloned into ppic9 vector ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) between the ecor i and not i sites with alpha - factor at the n - terminus and 6xhis - tag at the c - terminus in frame .
the generated plasmid , named ppic9 - ofhex3 , was linearized using pme i and transformed into pichia pastoris strain gs115 by electroporation .
positive clones were selected as previously described [ 24 ] .
the selected recombinant p. pastoris was precultured in bmgy medium and then transferred to bmmy medium for inducible expression by 1 % methanol according to the manufacture 's instruction .
after 144 h of induction , the recombinant protein was obtained first by 75 % saturation of ammonium sulfate precipitation and then by affinity chromatography on imac sepharose high performance column ( 5 ml , ge healthcare ) [ 24 ] .
the purity of recombinant ofhex3 was analyzed by 10 % ( w / v ) sds - page .
for determination of deglycosylation , 20 microg of the purified ofhex3 were denatured and reacted with either 2 microl glycopeptidase f ( takara ) or 2 microl water according to the manufacturer 's instruction , and then analyzed by 10 % sds - page .
enzymatic assay for the substrates pnp - beta - glcnac and pnp - beta - galnac ( p - nitrophenyl - n - acetyl - beta - d - galactosaminide ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) , the reaction mixture contained substrate ( 0.05 - 5 mm ) and 2 microl enzyme in 60 microl of britton - robinson 's wide range buffer ( ph 2 - 12 ) .
after incubation at 25degreesc for 30 min , the reaction was stopped by adding 60 microl of 0.5 m na2co3 and absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a sunrise microplate reader ( tecan , mannedorf , switzerland ) .
the reaction velocity was quantified by comparing the absorbance of the product pnp ( p - nitrophenol ) with a standard curve of pnp with known concentrations .
for the substrates ( glcnac ) n ( n = 2 - 4 ) , glcnacbeta1,2man , and glcnacbeta1,3galnac ( toronto research chemicals , toronto , canada ) , the enzymatic reaction mixture consisted of 30 microl substrate ( 0.1 - 1 mm ) in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer , 25 microl of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) , and 5 microl of enzyme .
the reaction mixtures were incubated at 25degreesc for an appropriate time , and then the reaction was immediately stopped by incubation on ice .
the hydrolysis products were analyzed by hplc using a tskgel amide - 80 column [ 25 ] .
the hydrolytic products were quantified by converting the peak area to concentration values according to a standard curve of glcnac made with known concentrations .
enzymatic reactions were terminated before 15 % of substrate was consumed .
the k m and k cat values were also calculated by linear regression of the data using lineweaver - burk plots .
for the pyridylaminated ( pa ) substrates gngn [ glcnacbeta1,2manalpha1,6 ( glcnacbeta1,2manalpha1,3 ) manbeta1,4glcnacbeta1,4glcnac ] , ga2 [ galnacbeta1,4galbeta1,4glc ] and gb4 [ galnacbeta1,3galalpha1,4galbeta1,4glc ] , the enzymatic reaction mixture consisted of 25 microl of 10 microm substrate in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer , 20 microl of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) , and 5 microl of enzyme .
the reaction mixtures were incubated at 25degreesc for 24 h and the hydrolysis products were analyzed by hplc as previously described [ 25 ] .
expression pattern of ofhex3 during o. furnacalis development to evaluate the temporal expression pattern of ofhex3 , insects ranging from the third - instar day - 2 to pupa day - 2 were sampled .
for tissue - specific expression , samples of the integument , midgut , fat body , trachea , malpighian tubule , silk gland , and testis of the fifth - instar day - 3 larvae were isolated .
gene - specific primers for real - time pcr were designed according to the most unique sequence of ofhex3 ( table s2 ) .
the housekeeping gene ofrps3 ( genbank id : eu275206 ) was chosen as the endogenous control [ 26 ] .
the standard curves for each gene were generated by serial ( 5x ) dilutions of pcr products .
rnas were isolated from the samples collected and cdnas were synthesized .
real - time pcr was performed and the expression levels of ofhex3 were calculated as described previously [ 27 ] .
a unique peptide (" kdptpivyepswvfkc ") of ofhex3 was synthesized and used as an antigen to produce an antibody .
this peptide was highly conserved among lepidopteran hex3s .
the ofhex3 antiserum was further purified by affinity purification using peptide - conjugated agarose gel .
proteins were extracted from the samples and separated by 10 % sds - page .
western blotting was performed as described previously [ 25 ] .
the antibodies used for western blot were 1:400 dilution for ofhex3 and 1:2000 dilution for tubulin .
to determine the specificity of hex3 antibody for b. mori hex3 ( bmhex3 ) , the gene encoding bmhex3 ( genbank id : nm _ 001085364 ) was cloned into the vector pet22b and expressed in e. coli .
after induction by 1 mm of iptg for 4 h , cells were collected .
western blot analysis was applied to determine if the antibody for hex3 could recognize bmhex3 .
the effect of tissue - specific expression of hex3 in b. mori on protein level was detected using the hex3 specific antibody .
samples from different tissues of day - 5 fifth - instar larvae were collected , including the integument , midgut , fat body , trachea , malpighian tubule , silk gland , ovary , and testis .
proteins were extracted and western blotting was performed as described above .
his - tag pull - down assay of ofhex1 molting fluid was collected from pharate pupae of o. furnacalis and b. mori ( unpublished data , mingbo qu ) .
hex3 - specific antibody was used to detect protein in the molting fluid .
a his - tag pull - down assay was used to detect the interaction between hex1 and hex3 .
the purified ofhex1 - his protein was prepared as previously described [ 24 ] .
in the experimental group , ofhex1 - his protein dissolved in binding buffer ( 20 mm sodium phosphate , 0.5 m nacl , ph 7.4 ) was incubated with molting fluid from b. mori .
one negative control was purified ofhex1 - his incubated with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .
another negative control was pbs incubated with molting fluid , so as to exclude the possibility of any proteins bind to the nta beads .
after incubation for 4 h , the samples were loaded on to ni - nta beads ( ge healthcare ) and incubated for 1 h. after five washes with binding buffer , the beads were washed five times with binding buffer plus 75 mm imidazole .
finally , the protein was eluted with binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and separated on 10 % sds - page .
hex3 antibody was used to detect hex3 in each sample as described above .
subcellular localization of ofhex3 in insect cells ofhex3 was expressed in the insect cell line sf9 using insect expression vector pib - v5 / his ( invitrogen ) .
full - length ofhex3 was inserted in pib - v5 / his with a c - terminal v5 tag and 6xhis - tag in frame .
following the same strategy as with full - length ofhex3 , several n - terminal truncations ( delta19 - 55 , delta19 - 104 , and delta19 - 155 ) of ofhex3 were also constructed to investigate whether the subcellular localization was influenced by its n - terminal sequence .
all the recombinant expression vectors were transfected into sf9 using cellfectin ii ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the subcellular localization of the recombinant proteins were determined by immunofluorescence as described previously [ 28 ] .
mouse anti - v5 antibody ( invitrogen ) was used to detect the recombinant protein expressed and cy3 conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody was used for visualization .
results sequence analysis of ofhex3 the cdna of ofhex3 was cloned from total rna of fifth - instar larvae of o. furnacalis by rt - pcr and races .
sequence analysis indicated that ofhex3 contains an open reading frame of 1827 nucleotides encoding 609 amino acid residues .
ofhex3 was predicted by signal p 4.0 to be a secreted protein with a signal peptide ( residues 1 - 18 ) [ 17 ] .
the phylogenetic analysis of insect glycoside hydrolase family 20 ( gh20 ) hexes from four insect species , including b. mori , o. furnacalis , drosophila melanogaster ( diptera ) and t. castaneum , indicated these hexes fell into four groups ( fig. 1a ) .
group i included chitinolytic hexes , e.g. ofhex1 ( genbank id : abi81756 ) [ 29 ] .
group ii comprised hexes with a broad substrate spectrum , e.g. ofhex2 ( genbank id : abo65045 ) [ 25 ] .
group iv consisted of n - glycan modifying hexes , e.g. dmfdl ( genbank id : aal55992 ) [ 30 ] .
ofhex3 belonged to group iii , which also included bmhex3 ( genbank id : baf52531 ) [ 31 ] , dmhexo2 ( genbank id : aaf46406 ) [ 32 ] and tcnag2 ( genbank id : abq95983 ) [ 5 ] .

phylogenetic tree was constructed with mega 5 using the neighbor - joining method with a bootstrap evaluation of 5,000 replications .
( b ) structure - based multiple sequence alignments of ofhex3 and other insect beta - n - acetyl - d - hexosaminidases .
the important residues for binding + 1 sugar in the substrate are labeled with black triangles .
( c ) comparison of active pocket structures of ofhex1 and ofhex3 .
the catalytic residues are labeled in pink while the important residues for binding + 1 sugar in the substrate are labeled in blue .
the structure - based multiple sequence alignment showed that ofhex3 contained all the critical residues that are important for the activity of gh20 hexes , including asp267 , his321 , asp391 and glu392 for catalysis , arg238 , tyr503 , asp505 and glu541 for substrate binding and trp452 , trp476 and trp539 for substrate binding via stacking interactions ( fig. s2 ) .
the most obvious differences among the four groups of insect hexes were the lengths and amino acid compositions of two loops , l314 - 335 and l478 - 496 , located at the entrance of the active pocket of ofhex1 ( fig. 1b ) .
group iii and group iv hexes possessed the longest l314 - 335 .
the residues val and glu ( black triangles in fig. 1b ) , which interacted with the + 1 sugar of the substrate in group i enzymes , were changed to ile and gln in the group iii enzymes ( ile351 and gln352 in ofhex3 ) , respectively .
the structure model of the catalytic domain of ofhex3 was built using the catalytic domain of ofhex1 ( pdb id : 3nsn ) as a template and was validated using procheck ( 89.8 % of the residues were in the most favored regions ) and verify _ 3d ( 93.4 % of the residues had an average three - to one - dimensional score > 0.2 ) .
the coordinates of ( glcnac ) 2 were built based on the structure of the ( glcnac ) 2 complexed chitobiase from serratia marcescens ( pdb id : 1qbb ) [ 33 ] .
the structures of the active pockets of ofhex1 and ofhex3 were then compared ( fig. 1c ) .
although catalytic residues ( asp367 and glu368 in ofhex1 , asp391 and glu392 in ofhex3 ) were conserved , the key residues comprising the + 1 subsites were very different .
ofhex3 did not have the aromatic residue ( trp490 in ofhex1 ) to stack with the + 1 sugar of the substrate .
unlike in ofhex1 , the residues ile351 and gln352 in ofhex3 were set in a position outward of the active pocket such that they could not interact with the + 1 sugar of the substrate .
recombinant expression , purification , and characterization of ofhex3 the gene encoding mature ofhex3 was successfully expressed in the yeast strain p. pastoris gs115 and the recombinant ofhex3 was purified from the culture supernatant with a yield of about 1 mg / l. the purified ofhex3 was resolved as a single band with a molecular weight of 75 kda by sds - page analysis and was verified by western blotting using anti - his - tag antibody ( fig. s3 ) .
the molecular weight of the recombinant ofhex3 was reduced by 15 kda after glycopeptidase f treatment ( fig. s3 ) .
the kinetic parameters of ofhex3 for pnp - beta - glcnac , pnp - beta - galnac , and ( glcnac ) 2 were determined .
as indicated by k cat / k m values , ofhex3 hydrolyzed the putative physiological substrate , ( glcnac ) 2 , 1.4 times faster than it did pnp - beta - glcnac ( table 1 ) .
moreover , ofhex3 hydrolyzed pnp - beta - glcnac at an 8.1 - fold higher efficiency than it did pnp - beta - galnac ( table 1 ) .
no substrate inhibition was observed using physiological substrate ( glcnac ) 2 even with a concentration as high as 10 mm ( fig. 2a ) .

ofhex3 could hydrolyze glcnacbeta1,4glcnac at a rate of 20.6 microm min - 1 , which was 10 - fold higher than that of glcnacbeta1,2man ( fig. 2b ) , but it could not hydrolyze glcnacbeta1,3galnac ( data not shown ) .
to determine whether ofhex3 could hydrolyze glcnac - containing glycans from glycoproteins and glycolipids , several commercial available pa substrates including gngn - pa ( glcnacbeta1,2manalpha1,6 ( glcnacbeta1,2manalpha1,3 ) manbeta1,4glcnacbeta1,4glcnac - pa ) , ga2 - pa ( galnacbeta1,4galbeta1,4glc - pa ) and gb4 - pa ( galnacbeta1,3galalpha1,4galbeta1,4glc - pa ) were tested .
the results indicated that there were no hydrolytic products after 24 h co - incubation of ofhex3 with these substrates ( data not shown ) .
ofhex3 occurred with ofhex1 in molting fluids since ofhex3 exhibited the activity of hydrolyzing chitooligosaccharides , we tested the molting fluid to see if it contained ofhex3 .
the molting fluid was collected during larval - pupal molting of o. furnacalis and the specific antibody against ofhex3 was applied for western blot analysis .
the results showed that ofhex3 was present in the molting fluid ( fig. 2c , lane 1 ) .
as hex1 also occurs in molting fluid , the interaction between hex3 and hex1 in molting fluid was tested by pull - down assay .
here the molting fluid from b. mori ( bmmf ) was used for the pull - down assay instead .
bombyx mori is a close relative to o. furnacalis , and bmhex3 shares 67 % identity in amino acid sequence with ofhex3 .
the benefit of using b. mori is that they are much bigger than o. furnacalis , making it easier to collect enough molting fluids. and the specificity of hex3 antibody towards bmhex3 was confirmed by western blot ( fig. s4 ) .
the ofhex3 antibody could also recognize bmhex3 in the molting fluid from b. mori ( fig. 2c , lane 2 ) .
the results suggested that bmhex3 could be pulled down by ofhex1 with high specificity compared with the control with no bait protein or molting fluid ( fig. 2d , lanes 1 - 4 ) .
expression pattern of ofhex3 during o. furnacalis development the expression pattern of ofhex3 was studied at both gene and protein level .
transcripts of ofhex3 could be detected in various tissues dissected from the fifth - instar day - 3 larvae , including integument , midgut , fat body , malpighian tubule , trachea , and testis .
the highest gene expression was found in the testis ( fig. 3a ) while the protein was found mainly in the fat body and testis ( fig. 3b ) .
to further confirm the tissue specificity of ofhex3 , we used the larger model insect b. mori to allow better tissue separation .

in : integument , fb : fat body , mg : midgut , sg : silk gland , mt : malpighian tubule , tr : trachea , te : testis .
tubulin was chosen as a loading control .
the tissue distribution of hex3 from b. mori agreed well with those from o. furnacalis , specifically bmhex3 was mainly found in the fat body and testis but not in the integument , midgut , or ovary of the fifth - instar day - 5 larvae ( fig. s5 ) .
additional bands were found in samples isolated from trachea and testis from either o. furnacalis or b. mori , but only one band was found in samples of molting fluid and fat body .
as the hex3 antibody has been proved very specific , these additional bands could be partially degraded hex3 .
the gene expression levels of ofhex3 from day - 2 third - instar larvae to day - 2 pupae were detected using real - time pcr .
the results indicated that ofhex3 was up - regulated during larval - larval molting in day - 3 third and fourth instars and during larval - pupal molting in the day - 1 pupae ( fig. 4a ) .
the protein distribution of ofhex3 in the whole body during development was detected with rabbit anti - hex3 antibody .
as shown in fig. 4b , the protein level of ofhex3 was up - regulated on the last day of the third and fourth instars , and the highest levels were in day - 2 fifth - instar larvae through day - 2 pupae ( fig. 4b ) .

subcellular localization of ofhex3 in insect cell line sf9 the subcellular localizations of ofhex3 were studied using the insect cell line sf9 .
immunofluorescence showed that the recombinant ofhex3 proteins were in puncta structures that co - localized with golgi marker man ii - gfp , indicating a possible cellular localization of ofhex3 in the golgi apparatus ( fig. 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071738.g005 figure 5 subcellular localization of ofhex3 in the insect cell line sf9 .
ofhex3 was expressed in insect cell line sf9 fused with n - terminal v5 tag .
it was co - transfected with golgi marker man ii - gfp .
the subcellular localizations of the recombinant proteins were detected through immunofluorescence using anti - v5 antibody .
the red signal indicates recombinant protein and the green signal indicates man ii - gfp in merge .
several n - terminal truncations ( delta19 - 55 , delta19 - 104 , and delta19 - 155 , fig. 5 ) of ofhex3 were constructed to investigate whether the subcellular localization was influenced by its n - terminal sequence .
for the delta19 - 55 , although some proteins were in cytoplasm , puncta structures co - localized with golgi marker man ii - gfp were still found ( fig. 5 ) .
the truncations delta19 - 104 and delta19 - 155 were all in the cytoplasm ( fig. 5 ) , indicating that the n - terminal sequence determined the subcellular localization of ofhex3 .
discussion insect molting fluid contains hex , which participates in the degradation of old cuticle during molting .
hex is encoded by genes that belong to four groups to function in different life processes .
so far , only hex1 was proved to be present in molting fluid and to function as a chitinolytic enzyme involved in the degradation of cuticle chitin [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 29 ] .
here , we showed that ofhex3 , the class iii hex from o. furnacalis , was also in the molting fluid , too .
this is the first report of a class iii hex that functions as a molting fluid enzyme besides playing roles in sperm - egg recognition .
the enzymatic properties of the recombinant ofhex3 revealed its role as a chitinolytic enzyme .
first , ofhex3 could efficiently hydrolyze ( glcnac ) 2 with k cat value of 21.07 s - 1 , which was faster than other tested substrates such as pnp - beta - glcnac , pnp - beta - galnac , and glcnacbeta1,2man .
second , ofhex3 did not show substrate inhibition at high substrate concentration ( 10 mm ( glcnac ) 2 ) , unlike ofhex1 , which showed substrate inhibition at 0.2 mm ( glcnac ) 2 [ 34 ] .
also , ofhex3 interacted with ofhex1 in the molting fluid according to the pull - down assay .
therefore , we hypothesized that ofhex3 might cooperate with ofhex1 in cuticle degradation during molting .
this speculation was supported by a previous study of hex3 in t. castaneum and d. melanogaster .
rnai of hex3 ( tcnag2 ) from t. castaneum caused lethal phenotypes during larval - larval , larval - pupal and pupal - adult transitions , and the pharate adults could not fully enclose from the pupal cuticle [ 5 ] .
the enzymatic study of hex3 ( dmhexo2 ) from d. melanogaster showed that it could hydrolyze chitotriose [ 30 ] .
notably , ofhex3 was very different from ofhex1 in terms of enzymatic properties .
ofhex1 exhibited higher affinity and activity toward chitooligosaccharides and severe substrate inhibition at low substrate concentration ( 0.2 mm for ( glcnac ) 2 ) [ 34 ] .
in contrast , ofhex3 showed much lower activity for chitooligosaccharides ( with a k cat / k m value for ( glcnac ) 2 142.8 - fold lower than that of ofhex1 ) but no substrate inhibition .
to understand the structural basis for the difference in enzymatic properties , the structure of the catalytic domain of ofhex3 was modeled using that of ofhex1 as template .
striking differences were observed between the + 1 subsites of the active pockets of these enzymes .
the active pocket of ofhex3 was wider than that of ofhex1 ( fig. 1c ) .
the ofhex1 trp490 that is vital for substrate binding was absent in ofhex3 [ 10 ] .
the lack of substrate inhibition for ofhex3 might be attributed to the absence of trp490 , because the mutation of trp490 to ala490 relieved the substrate inhibition of ofhex1 [ 34 ] .
we deduced that hex3 would be an alternative chitinolytic hexosaminidase in molting fluid when substrates concentration tolerance is an issue for hex1 .
in addition to the enzymatic analysis , both the gene transcription and translation levels indicated ofhex3 's involvement in molting .
during the development of o. furnacalis , both gene and protein levels of ofhex3 were highly up - regulated during larval - larval molting and larval - pupal metamorphosis , suggesting that ofhex3 was involved in chitin degradation during molting .
in summary , ofhex3 , a class iii hex , cooperated with ofhex1 , a class i hex , to function as chitinolytic enzymes in the molting fluids of insect .

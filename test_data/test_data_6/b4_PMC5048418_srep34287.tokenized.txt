we performed a longitudinal resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) study in 42 treatment - naive first - episode schizophrenia patients ( fesp ) at baseline and then after 8 - weeks of risperidone monotherapy , and compared the findings to 38 healthy volunteers .
spontaneous brain activity was quantified using the fractional amplitude of low - frequency fluctuations ( falff ) and regional homogeneity ( reho ) and compared between patients and controls .
pretreatment , patients exhibited higher falff in left caudate compared with controls .
after treatment , patients had elevated falff in bilateral putamen and right caudate , and increased reho in right caudate and left putamen .
greater increase of falff in the left putamen correlated with less improvement in positive symptoms .
thus , abnormalities of spontaneous neural activity in chronic schizophrenia is at least partly due to a medication effect .
the observed post - treatment increase in striatal intrinsic activity may reflect counter - therapeutic functional adaptation to dopamine d2 receptor occupancy required for medication effects on psychosis .
resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfmri ) studies have identified spontaneous brain function alterations in schizophrenia .
such rfmri measurements , including amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ( alff ) , fractional alff ( falff ) and regional homogeneity ( reho ) , are indices of spontaneous brain activity .
reho1 is used to represent the degree of synchronization of a given voxel with its nearest neighbors at a voxel wise level .
while both alff2 and falff3 are utilized to evaluate the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent ( bold ) signal , relative to alff , falff can suppress non - specific signal components in rfmri and is more sensitive and specific for detection of spontaneous brain activities .
cross - sectional studies have reported falff4 and reho5 alterations in the early phase of schizophrenia .
more extensive falff678 and reho910 abnormalities have been observed in chronic schizophrenic patients ( csp ) , potentially an indication that the findings are the result of disease progression or effects of chronic illness .
alternatively the findings could be due to the effects of antipsychotic medication .
all known effective antipsychotic drugs are d2 - 4 dopamine receptor antagonists or partial agonists11 , in cortical regions , such as prefrontal and cingulate cortices , and subcortical regions , such as basal ganglia ( caudate , putamen and globus pallidus ) and amygdala12 .
dopamine ( da ) modulates spontaneous brain activity .
levodopa regulates alff measures in main cortical output areas of the striatum and reho values in striatal - cortical loops in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) 1314 .
administration of amisulpride , an atypical antipsychotic , for seven days to healthy volunteers , alters falff receiving dopaminergic imput , with changed falff levels in putamen correlating with drug plasma concentration15 .
finally , imaging genetics studies report associations between polymorphisms of da - related genes and resting - state brain activities161718 .
collectively , these data imply a modulatory role of antipsychotic treatment in spontaneous brain activity .
to date , one longitudinal study19 has examined the effect of 6 - weeks of antipsychotic treatment on resting - state alff measures in 34 drug - naive first - episode schizophrenia patients ( fesp ) .
medications examined in that study included sulpiride , clozapine , olanzapine , risperidone and aripiprazole .
increased alff in frontal gyrus , parietal lobule , temporal gyrus and striatum was observed after treatment although the affected brain regions varied .
the heterogeneity of drug binding affinities may potentially cloud the net effect on spontaneous brain activity .
positron emission tomography ( pet ) studies2021 have shown that different classes of antipsychotics have different effects on neural metabolism and blood flow .
to distinguish effects of medication from early disease effect requires a longitudinal study of drug - naive fesp treated with standardized protocol - driven , antipsychotic monotherapy to separately determine disease effects and pharmacological effects on spontaneous brain activities .
post - treatment alterations of fmri measurements that correlate with symptom improvement may shed light on possible mechanisms of action of existing treatments .
previously published results , however , have varied in the nature of the associations between brain functional measurements and clinical symptoms , possibly due to differences in sample characteristics and medication heterogeneity .
in 34 drug - naive fesp treated with different antipsychotics , such as olanzapine , sulpiride , risperidone and clozapine , lui et al.19 found that longitudinal increases of alff in frontal gyrus , parietal lobule , temporal gyrus and right caudate were negatively correlated with improvement of positive symptoms .
in 23 antipsychotic - naive fesp treated with amisulpride monotherapy , nielsen et al.22 reported that the change of bold signals in ventral striatum showed positive correlation with the improvement of positive symptoms .
in contrast , medication - naive fesp treated with risperidone , olanzapine or quetiapine23 showed no correlation between improvement of symptoms and alteration of cortex activation examined by fmri .
therefore , we conducted a longitudinal fmri study in a relatively large sample of drug - naive fesp , within 12 months of psychosis onset , to quantify falff and reho both at baseline and after 8 weeks treatment with risperidone monotherapy .
we also performed an exploratory analysis to explore whether alterations of reho or falff were related to changes in clinical symptoms .
at baseline , we hypothesized that patients would exhibit abnormalities of falff and reho compared with healthy volunteers .
we hypothesized that risperidone monotherapy would modulate reho and falff in regions with dopaminergic input , and that change would be related to clinical improvement .
results demographic characteristics the demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in table 1 .
healthy volunteers did not differ from patients with respect to age ( p = 0.929 ) , gender ( p = 0.888 ) , years of education ( p = 0.373 ) , and alcohol ( p = 0.282 ) and tobacco use ( p = 0.967 ) .
longitudinal alterations of clinical symptoms as shown in table 1 , after 8 - week treatment , patients had pronounced reductions in positive and negative syndrome scale ( panss ) total symptom ( panss - t ) , positive symptom ( panss - p ) , and general psychopathology symptom ( panss - g ) scores , but no significant alterations in panss negative symptom scores ( panss - n ) results of one - sample t - test within group one - sample t - test showed higher standardized falff and reho values relative to whole brain in cortical regions , such as prefrontal and cingulate cortices , and subcortical regions , such as striatum ( caudate , putamen and globus pallidus ) in both patients group and controls group .
it may reflect higher spontaneous neuronal activity in these brain areas during resting but awake state .
( supplementary figures s1 and s2 ) .
baseline alterations in falff and reho at baseline , patients had higher falff in left caudate ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) compared with healthy volunteers ( fig. 1a , table 2 ) .
patients also had higher falff in right caudate and bilateral putamen , as well as reho in right caudate and left putamen ( p < 0.005 , uncorrected ) , although these differences did not survive multiple comparisons correction ( supplementary table s1 ) .
no regions showed lower falff / reho in patients relative to healthy volunteers .
longitudinal alterations in falff and reho after 8 - weeks of treatment , falff increased in right caudate and bilateral putamen ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) ( fig. 1b , table 2 ) , and reho increased in right caudate and left putamen compared with baseline ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) ( fig. 1c , table 2 ) .
no regions demonstrated decreased falff or reho after treatment .
relationships between longitudinal alterations of fmri measures and clinical variables longitudinal increases of falff in left putamen were negatively correlated with improvement in panss - p scores ( t = - 4.739 , p = 0.0006 , fdr corrected ) ( fig. 1b ) .
the baseline falff of left putamen in patients showed trend - level positive correlation with the baseline panss - p scores ( t = 2.297 , p = 0.082 , fdr corrected ) ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
there were no significant correlations between the longitudinal alterations of falff / reho and the changes in panss - t or panss - g symptom scores after treatment ( ps > 0.05 ) .
discussion to our knowledge , this is the first longitudinal study examining the effect of risperidone monotherapy on falff and reho in treatment - naive fesp .
prior to treatment , patients had higher falff in left caudate , and a similar trend in the right caudate and bilateral putamen , as well as reho in right caudate and left putamen , relative to healthy volunteers .
after 8 weeks of treatment , there was a further increase of falff in right caudate and bilateral putamen , and an increase in reho in right caudate and left putamen .
as hypothesized , our results indicated that risperidone monotherapy altered reho and falff in brain regions within the dopaminergic pathway in fesp .
additionally , the degree of post - treatment increase of falff in the left putamen correlated with less improvement in positive symptoms .
this study demonstrates that abnormalities of spontaneous neural activity documented in csp may be partly a medication effect and partly due to the disease .
higher striatal rfmri indices at baseline are consistent with elevated striatal neural activity in schizophrenia .
moreover , the higher spontaneous neural activity of striatal region ( left putamen ) correlated with greater severity of positive symptoms at a trend level , consistent with previous studies4112425 showing that the striatal overactivity is critically involved in the pathomechanism of schizophrenia , especially psychosis .
according to the da hypothesis for schizophrenia11 , the excessive release of striatal presynaptic da underlies psychosis ( fig. 2a ) .
given the potential associations between da signals and spontaneous brain activity131416 , we propose that the higher spontaneous neural activity of striatal region observed in this study may be due to excessive release of striatal da ( fig. 2a ) .
post - treatment increases of falff in right caudate and bilateral putamen , as well as increases of reho in right caudate and left putamen , indicate that greater spontaneous neural activity in striatal areas after short - term risperidone monotherapy .
antipsychotic medications increase firing of da neurons that project to striatal regions - including the putamen , caudate and palladium , and block d2 - 4 receptors , which both ameliorates positive symptoms and causes extrapyramidal symptoms11 .
consequently , altered spontaneous neural activities in the caudate and putamen are not unexpected .
consistent with our findings , a longitudinal resting - state fmri study19 reported increased striatal alff after 6 weeks of treatment in fesp .
moreover , pet and structural mri studies have also demonstrated that antipsychotic cause activity increases2126 and volume enlargement2728 in striatum of schizophrenia patients .
however , the post - treatment increases of striatal spontaneous activity observed in the present study may not be directly therapeutic .
first , prior to treatment , patients have abnormally higher falff in left caudate , and a comparable trend in right caudate and bilateral putamen , as well as that of reho in right caudate and left putamen .
second , greater post - treatment increases of falff in left putamen was associated with less improvement in positive symptoms , and higher baseline falff in left putamen correlated with greater severity of positive symptoms prior to treatment on a trend level .
furthermore , the da hypothesis for schizophrenia proposes that excessive release of ventral or limbic striatal da reflects part of the pathogenesis of psychosis , and antipsychotic treatment ameliorates psychosis through blocking striatal postsynaptic d2 - 4 da receptors. that action , in turn leads to elevated striatal da release ( due to blockade presynaptic d2 autoreceptors ) and potentially increased d1 / 5 signaling since d2 - 4 receptors are blocked by the medication11 .
given the previous evidence suggesting potential associations between da and modulation of spontaneous brain activity1317 , we propose that the posttreatment striatal hyperactivity observed in our current study may result from treatment - induced compensatory increase of ventral striatal da release ( fig. 2b ) .
in addition , risperidone is also a strong 5 - ht2a antagonist , but there is little evidence suggesting potential associations between 5 - ht and modulation of spontaneous brain activity .
the increase in the magnitude of the spontaneous activity in the striatum cannot be readily explained by an effect of 5 - ht2a antagonism .
overall , posttreatment increases of striatal spontaneous activities observed in this study may be treatment - induced hyperactivity , which could reflect ineffective functional adaptation to d2 - 4 receptor occupancy and may mitigate the treatment response of psychosis .
it is noteworthy that antipsychotics acutely cause increases in da release in response to receptor blockade and an increase in presynaptic da synthesis , in contrast , subacute medications can decrease it112930 .
future longer - term follow - up studies in fesp are needed to clarify how changes in striatal intrinsic function progresses over time and is linked to changes in da release and signaling .
we found alterations of reho / falff after risperidone monotherapy treatment in striatum but not extrastriatal regions , in contrast to the findings of lui et al.19 that found both striatum and extrastriatal regions , such as frontal and temporal cortices demonstrated increases of alff in fesp after short - term treatment .
one potential explanation for the differences between the findings of these studies may be the difference in medications administered , as in their study patients were treated with an array of drugs , including quetiapine , clozapine , olanzapine , sulpiride , aripiprazole and risperidone .
different antipsychotic agents produce different patterns of occupancy .
for example , clozapine and quetiapine produce preferentially block da d2 receptors in temporal cortex compared with putamen31 ; olanzapine and risperidone have less affinity for extrastriatal da d2 receptors3233 ; while aripiprazole shows comparable da d2 receptor blockade in striatal and extrastriatal areas34 .
although the work of lui et al. also demonstrated alff alterations of both striatal and extrastriatal regions in a subgroup of patients treated with risperidone monotherapy , the relatively small sample ( n = 12 ) in the subgroup may explain the differences between their results and our current findings , which were confined to striatum .
although measurements of spontaneous neural activity appear to have moderate test - retest reliability35 , the lack of repeated fmri scans for the healthy volunteer group is a limitation of our present study as we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the posttreatment changes of reho / falff might be related to a time - dependent change over the test - retest period .
however , we did formally rule out the impact of simply having repeated fmri scans .
although reho and falff are considered to represent spontaneous brain activity , there remains a lack of consensus regarding the exact physiological basis of the two measures , which will need to be further examined in future studies .
given that a recent paper highlighted the clusterwise interference is problematic , we added a discussion about the method ( see supplementary discussion ) .
finally , future studies exploring different antipsychotics effects in several clinical subgroups with large samples of treatment - naive fesp are needed to further clarify the potential heterogeneous effects of antipsychotic agents on intrinsic neural activity .
in conclusion , this study found that short - term risperidone monotherapy results in increased striatal intrinsic activity in drug - naive fesp , overlapping with brain regions that exhibit abnormalities of spontaneous neural activity prior to treatment .
posttreatment increases of striatal intrinsic activities may represent ineffective functional adaptation to d2 receptor blockade and moderate the treatment effects on psychosis .
these results provide new insight into antipsychotic medication effects on resting - state neural function , and offer promise that falff and reho measures can be used as potential biomarkers for tracking long - term medication effects to individualize patient care .
in the future , therefore , longer - term follow - up pharmacological studies in fesp may clarify how changes in intrinsic neural function progress over time and how these are associated with the occurrence of medication resistance in some individuals .
methods participants forty - two treatment - naive fesp and 38 age - , gender - , handedness - , and education - matched healthy volunteers were recruited from the second affiliated hospital , xinxiang medical university , china ( table 1 ) .
all the participants were also included in our previously published longitudinal study of mr spectroscopy data36 .
in that previous study , we collected 1h proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy data to explore the n - acetylaspartate level , while in the current study we collected rfmri data to explore the spontaneous brain activity , and the rfmri data presented here have not been previously published .
patients were diagnosed by at least two trained psychiatrists using the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv - tr , patient version ( scid - i / p ) .
they were suffering from their first episode of schizophrenia and were free of other dsm - iv diagnoses or clinically significant medical disease .
they had less than 1 year of illness duration .
healthy volunteers were screened according to the scid - np ( non - patient edition ) for lifetime absence of any psychiatric disorder .
this study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
the ethics committee of the second xiangya hospital of central south university ( no .
s088 , 2012 ) and the cooperated hospital , the second affiliated hospital of xinxiang medical university approved this study , and written informed consent from all subjects were obtained .
all participants were permitted to withdraw from the study at any time .
all patients had mri scans within 24 hours after enrollment in this study , a time when they were free from drug .
post - treatment scans were scheduled for patients after an 8 - week treatment course .
one patient 's fmri data at baseline was excluded due to quality control , and 4 patients withdrew from the follow - up mri scans .
we collected fmri data from 41 fesp at baseline , 38 patients after treatment and 38 healthy volunteers .
therapy and clinical assessments all patients were stabilized on risperidone monotherapy at a dosage of 4 - 6 mg / day for 8 weeks .
mood stabilizers and antidepressants were not used .
the efficacy and safety of risperidone was assessed weekly by clinical interviews .
during the treatment , no serious adverse effects occurred .
symptoms severity of all patients ( n = 42 ) were evaluated at baseline and follow - up with the 30 - item positive and negative syndrome scale ( panss ) 37 .
fmri imaging imaging data were collected using a 3t magnetic resonance imager ( siemens verio , erlangen , germany ) .
participants were fitted with earplugs and foam pads to reduce scanner noise and limit head motion .
participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed , relax , but not fall asleep during scanning .
rfmri was completed using a gradient - echo echo - planar imaging ( ge - epi ) with following parameters : tr / te = 2000 / 30 ms , fov = 240 x 240 mm2 , flip angle = 90degrees , matrix size = 64 x 64 , 240 volumes , slice thickness = 3 mm , slice gap = 0 , and voxel size = 3.75 x 3.75 x 3 mm3 .
high resolution sagittal t1 - weighted anatomical scans were obtained with a spoiled gradient echo ( spgr ) pulse sequence ( tr / te = 1900 / 2.52ms , fov = 250 x 250 mm2 , flip angle = 9degrees , slice thickness = 1 mm , slice gap = 0 , 176 slices ) .
patients were scanned both at baseline and follow - up , while healthy volunteers underwent once .
image preprocessing the data processing assistant for resting - state fmri ( dparsf ) 38 which is based on statistical parametric mapping ( spm , http :// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm ) and the toolbox for data processing & analysis of brain imaging ( dpabi , http :// rfmri.org / dpabi ) 39 were used to preprocess the fmri image .
to avoid non - equilibrium effects of magnetization , we discarded the first 10 volumes for each participant .
slice timing and realignment correction were performed .
any subject with head motion > 1.5 mm translation or > 1.5degrees rotation in any direction was removed .
the data were then normalized to standard epi template in spm ( resampled voxel size 3 x 3 x 3 mm3 ) .
we also performed another t1 co - registration analysis to process the data ( the detailed methods and results showed in supplementary information ) .
calculation of falff the resampled images were smoothed with a gaussian kernel of 8 mm and detrended to remove the linear signal drift .
next , nuisance variables ( including friston 24 - parameter model head motion , white matter ( wm ) signal and cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) signal ) were regressed from the data .
the falff of all subjects were calculated based on the method of zou et al.3 .
finally , the raw falff value of each voxel was divided by the global average falff value for standardization .
calculation of reho the resampled images were detrended and regressed the friston 24 head motion , wm and csf signal .
then the band - pass filtering ( 0.01 - 0.08 hz ) was performed to remove the effects of high - frequency noise .
reho maps1 were conducted by calculating kendall 's coefficient of concordance for a given voxel time series with those of its nearest 26 neighbors .
for standardization purpose , the reho value of each voxel was divided by the whole brain mean reho value .
group - level analysis of falff and reho the dpabi toolbox was used to conduct group - level analyses of falff and reho .
one - sample t - test was performed to indicate the baseline maps of falff and reho .
two - sample t - test was used to analyze group differences between patients at baseline and healthy volunteers , with age and gender as control covariates .
paired - sample t - test was used to assess longitudinal changes of the rfmri measures in patients at baseline and follow - up. multiple correction was performed using cluster - extent correction ( alphasim ) as implemented through dpabi , and the parameters were set as follows : individual voxel threshold p = 0.001 , number of monte carlo simulations = 1000 , and p = 0.05 as the effective threshold for cluster - extent correction .
we performed a whole brain approach by computing falff and reho value for every brain voxel and then doing group level analysis .
based on the literature1112151922 , we hypothesized that risperidone monotherapy would modulate reho and falff of regions within dopaminergic pathway in patients .
even though we had such brain region specific hypotheses , a brain - wide voxel approach can both test whether these regions show the abnormality or treatment effect , and demonstrate that neighboring regions do not show the effect. that approach both supports the hypothesized brain regions as being involved and excludes the non - hypothesized brain regions .
the brain regions with significant longitudinal changes of rfmri measures were individually extracted as masks , and then the masks were used to extract the mean falff and reho values respectively from patients at baseline and follow - up. the associations between baseline falff or reho and baseline symptoms were evaluated by using multiple regression analysis with age and gender as control variables .
the associations between longitudinal alterations of falff or reho ( follow - up minus baseline ) and improvement of clinical symptoms ( baseline panss scores minus follow - up panss scores ) were evaluated by using multiple regression analysis with baseline panss scores , age and gender as control variables .
we performed false discovery rate ( fdr ) 40 correction in n1 ( number of regions showing significant posttreatment alterations of reho or falff ) xn2 ( numbers of panss dimensions showing significant longitudinal alterations ) multiple tests ( cut - off value 0.05 ) for the correlation analysis .
statistical analysis two - sample t - tests were used to compute the differences in age and years of education between fesp and healthy volunteers ; and chi - square tests were performed to assess the differences in gender , alcohol and tobacco use between the two groups .
paired - sample t - test was used to compare patients' longitudinal alterations of panss scores .
threshold of statistical significance was p < 0.05 .

figure 1 comparison and correlation results of falff and reho .
( a ) at baseline , patients had higher falff in left caudate ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) compared with healthy volunteers .
( b ) after 8 - weeks of treatment , patients showed increased falff in right caudate and bilateral putamen ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) relative to baseline .
the associations between longitudinal increases of falff ( follow - up minus baseline ) and improvement of clinical symptoms ( baseline panss scores minus follow - up panss scores ) were evaluated by using multiple regression analysis with baseline panss scores , age and gender as control variables .
correlation analysis showed more posttreatment increases of falff in left putamen was associated with less improvement of positive symptoms ( t = - 4.739 , p = 0.006 , fdr corrected ) .
( c ) after treatment , patients showed elevated reho in right caudate and left putamen compared with baseline ( p < 0.05 , alphasim corrected ) .

figure 2 the proposed mechanism of higher striatal spontaneous neural activity at baseline and follow - up in fesp .
( a ) according to the da hypothesis for schizophrenia11 , the excessive release of striatal presynaptic da is fundamental to the generation of the psychosis .
given the potential associations between da and modulation of spontaneous cerebral function , we propose that the higher spontaneous neural activity of striatal region observed in this study may be underlied by the excessive release of striatal presynaptic da .
( b ) antipsychotic treatment ameliorates psychosis through blocking the striatal postsynaptic d2 dopamine receptors , which would compensatorily elevate striatal presynaptic dopamine ( due to blockade presynaptic d2 autoreceptors ) and further paradoxically deteriorate the pre - existing pathological abnormality , i.e. excessive release of striatal presynaptic dopamine .
we propose that the posttreatment striatal hyperactivity observed in this study may result from treatment - induced compensatory increase of striatal presynaptic da. fesp , treatment - naive first - episode schizophrenia patients ; da , dopamine .

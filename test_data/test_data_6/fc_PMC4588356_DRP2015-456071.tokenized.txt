actinic keratosis ( ak ) is a common precancerous skin lesion and many ak management guidelines exist , but there has been limited investigation into the quality of these documents .
the objective of this study was to assess the strengths and weaknesses of guidelines that address ak management .
a systematic search for guidelines with recommendations for ak was performed .
the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation ( agree ii ) was used to appraise the quality of guidelines .
multiple raters independently reviewed each of the guidelines and applied the agree ii tool and scores were calculated .
overall , 2,307 citations were identified and 7 fulfilled the study criteria .
the cancer council of australia / australian cancer network guideline had the highest mean scores and was the only guideline to include a systematic review , include an evidence rating for recommendations , and report conflicts of interest and funding sources .
high - quality , effective guidelines are evidence - based with recommendations that are concise and organized , so practical application is facilitated .
features such as concise tables , pictorial diagrams , and explicit links to evidence are helpful .
however , the rigor and validity of some guidelines were weak .
so , it is important for providers to be aware of the features that contribute to a high - quality , practical document .
1. introduction actinic keratosis ( ak ) , or solar keratosis , is a common dysplastic lesion of the keratinocyte [ 1 , 2 ] .
over a 10 - year period from 1990 to 1999 , ak was diagnosed in more than 47 million visits and was found to occur in 14 % of all patients visiting dermatologists [ 3 ] .
ak may be treated due to concern for carcinogenesis , patient discomfort , or cosmesis .
the most common treatment for ak is cryotherapy [ 4 ] , likely due to easy access , ease of care for patients , and speed of the procedure .
other management methods include observation , alternative destructive therapies , topical chemotherapies , chemical peels , photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) , and preventative measures such as sunscreen [ 5 ] .
given the high prevalence of ak and the variety and number of clinicians within an organization that encounter ak , cpg can serve as a resource upon which management approaches are unified .
clinical practice guidelines ( cpg ) can guide clinicians' diagnostic and therapeutic decisions by succinctly reviewing the literature and proposing evidence - based management recommendations .
cpg are defined by the institute of medicine as " statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options .
rather than dictating a one - size - fits - all approach to patient care , cpg offer an evaluation of the breadth and quality of the relevant scientific literature and an assessment of the likely benefits and harms of a particular treatment " [ 6 ] .
thus , a high - quality cpg will include an extensive literature review and an evidence rating scale can help readers be aware of the potential limitations of the sources .
the quality of cpg can vary for many reasons including the adequacy of the literature search , types of studies incorporated , and bias by the authors [ 7 , 8 ] .
to our knowledge , there is no published assessment of ak cpg quality .
we used the agree ii instrument [ 9 ] to assess the strengths and weaknesses of cpg addressing multiple modalities of ak management for patients without immunosuppression .
2. methods the prisma checklist was used as a guide for this investigation .
a medical librarian performed a systematic search of the medical literature for cpg with recommendations for ak. an extensive search of medline / pubmed ( 1966 - march 20 , 2014 ) was conducted for relevant clinical practice guidelines using a combination of the key terms " actinic " and " keratosis " and " guideline " as well as " keratosis , actinic " as a major medical subject heading .
results were limited to practice guideline and guideline publication types .
there were no date or language restrictions .
in addition the national guideline clearinghouse , national institute for health and clinical excellence , european academy of dermatology and venereology , guidelines international network , trip database , australian government clinical practice guidelines portal , scottish intercollegiate guidelines network , guidelines and audit implementation network , professional organizations and royal colleges , health service executive guidelines and the american academy dermatology web sites were searched using key terms " actinic " and " keratosis. " the inclusion criteria were established a priori and ( 1 ) included an explicit statement identifying the document as a management guideline , ( 2 ) were written by multiple authors including at least one dermatologist , and ( 3 ) made recommendations concerning multiple options to manage ak. exclusion criteria included ( 1 ) consensus statements or review articles that did not include identifiable management recommendations , ( 2 ) reviews of a published guideline , ( 3 ) focus on only preventative , epidemiology , or research methods , ( 4 ) focus on a limited or specific patient population , and ( 5 ) discussion of one form of management .
two reviewers ( ts and jk ) independently examined the retrieved titles and abstracts to assess the articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria .
the full text of these articles was retrieved and the same two reviewers ( ts and jk ) reviewed the selected articles again for eligibility .
disagreement was resolved through discussion by the reviewers ( ts and jk ) .
seven of the guidelines were selected for analysis .
the agree ii tool was used to describe the quality of the selected cpg .
it was developed to evaluate the validity and feasibility of cpg as well as assess sources of bias [ 9 ] .
the agree and agree ii tools have been validated and widely applied , including cpg of dermatologic conditions [ 17 , 18 ] as well as in other disciplines [ 19 - 21 ] .
four of the authors independently reviewed and scored the cpg .
jk and es are dermatologists , ts was a first - year medical student , and ha is a family practitioner .
all four reviewers read the agree ii users' manual and completed the online orientation and training .
the agree ii instrument was used to define the assessment variables and rating system and to store data [ 9 ] .
this instrument provides criteria to appraise the quality of cpg and consists of 23 items grouped into six domains : ( 1 ) scope and purpose , ( 2 ) stakeholder involvement , ( 3 ) rigor of development , ( 4 ) clarity of presentation , ( 5 ) applicability , and ( 6 ) editorial independence .
each item is rated on a seven - point likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree ( 1 - 7 , resp. ) .
the results for each domain consist of a domain score , which is the sum of the scores of the individual domain items and standardized by scaling the total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain .
the maximum score for each domain was the number of questions multiplied by 7 ( strongly agree ) .
the minimum score was the number of questions multiplied by number 1 ( strongly disagree ) : ( 1 ) scaled domain score = sum of domain scores - minimum possible scoremaximum possible score - minimum possible scorex100 % .
the minimum standardized score for each domain was , therefore , 0 % and the maximum was 100 % .
a standardized domain score above 60 % has been suggested as the threshold to indicate sufficient minimum quality to consider practical use of this portion of the guideline [ 18 ] .
this study was exempted from review by the penn state institutional review board .
2.1 .
statistical analysis the scores were compiled and reviewed ; upon visual inspection one investigator had scores that appeared to deviate from the other three .
the pearson correlation coefficient is very sensitive to outlying values so spearman 's rho was used to determine interrater reliability [ 22 ] .
the degree of agreement was classified as follows : poor ( 0.00 ) , slight ( 0.00 and 0.20 ) , fair ( 0.21 to 0.40 ) , moderate ( 0.41 to 0.60 ) , substantial ( from 0.61 to 0.80 ) , and very good or almost perfect ( 0.81 to 1.00 ) [ 23 ] .
a descriptive statistical analysis of the scores was performed and included the mean and standard deviation .
a p value of <. 05 was considered significant .
all analyses were performed using sas 9.3 ( sas , cary , nc ) .
3. results the search strategy identified 2,307 records and after review ultimately seven records were included in the study ( figure 1 ) .
the characteristics of the seven cpg are listed in table 1. of the seven cpg , one was from australia [ 11 ] , one was from britain [ 12 ] , three were from germany [ 13 - 15 ] , one was from italy [ 16 ] , and one was from the united states [ 10 ] .
the range for interrater agreement was 0.39 - 0.86 .
analysis showed that one appraiser had only fair agreement with other appraisers ( 0.39 [ p = . 38 ]) .
this rater was a first - year medical student and it was presumed that this reflected clinical experience rather than cpg quality so his scores were removed and subsequent calculations did not include these scores .
the correlation coefficients among the three remaining appraisers , which included two dermatologists and a family practitioner , were moderate or better ( 0.54 - 0.86 ) .
the cca / acn guideline [ 11 ] was the only cpg to perform a systematic review , include evidence - based ratings for recommendations , and report conflicts of interest and funding sources ( table 1 ) .
it was also the only cpg to have scores for all domains above 60 % and had the highest score for each of the six domains and overall category ( table 2 ) .
the domains with the highest mean scores were domain 1 ( scope and purpose ) and domain 4 ( clarity of presentation ) with means of 50.2 % and 51.1 % , respectively .
the domains with the lowest mean scores were domain 5 ( applicability ) and domain 6 ( editorial independence ) with means of 28.6 % and 32.1 % , respectively .
domain 6 ( editorial independence ) also had the lowest individual score of 6.3 and the greatest range in individual scores ( 8.3 % to 80.6 %) .
this may reflect wide variation in disclosure of funding and conflict of interests .
while five of the seven cpg included a conflict of interests statement , only two had a disclosure regarding funding sources ( table 1 ) .
three guidelines were recommended by at least three raters ( cca / can [ 11 ] , de berker et al. [ 12 ] , stockfleth and kerl 2006 [ 13 ]) .
the cpg by stockfleth et al .
2008 [ 14 ] was recommended by two of the three raters .
this second article by stockfleth et al .
2008 [ 14 ] had higher scores in domains 1 ( scope and purpose ) , 2 ( stakeholder involvement ) , 4 ( clarity of presentation ) , and 5 ( applicability ) but lower scores in domains 3 ( rigor of development ) and 6 ( editorial independence ) .
domain 3 's ( rigor of development ) score may have been lower due to a lack of a systematic review and the methods which were reported as " consultation and discussion of best practice was adopted as a means of formulating a consensus of opinion. " this article reported funding by a pharmaceutical company that has ak - related products in its portfolio , which may have negatively impacted the scores in domain 6 ( editorial independence ) .
the 2011 update by this group ( european dermatology forum ) was recommended by two of the three raters and compared to the cpg from 2006 and 2008 ; this document had lower scores than the 2006 and 2008 cpg from this group across all domains except for domain 6 ( editorial independence ) .
in contrast to the two prior versions , this cpg had a table at the beginning of the document that listed the coi for each author ; however there was no explicit statement of funding .
4. discussion high - quality cpg can supply clinicians with succinct research findings , specific suggestions for management in particular clinical scenarios , and economic considerations for a specific condition [ 24 ] .
ak is a common skin lesion and many cpg have been published .
our goal was to review the quality of cpg that are broadly applicable to ak management rather than focus on a specific population or treatment .
aks are treated by providers from multiple disciplines with an array of treatments , so it is valuable and increasingly common for cpg to be written by representatives from the stakeholder groups , including generalists , specialists , and patients [ 8 , 25 ] .
the cca / acn was the only guideline to score above 60 % for the stakeholder involvement domain ; it was developed by a multidisciplinary " working party " that included dermatologists , pathologists , plastic surgeons , general practitioners , health economists , epidemiologists , and patients .
the cca / can was also the only cpg that utilized a systematic review and had the highest scores for the rigor of development domain .
the results of this review are consistent with previous appraisals of cpg for acne , psoriasis , and pressure ulcers that showed that the rigor of development domain often had lower scores [ 17 , 18 ] .
this domain is important to cpg value since it supports the validity of the recommendations [ 8 ] .
other cpg had less rigorous search methods or incomplete descriptions of the methods .
cpg help readers to understand the strengths and limitations of the recommendations by including a rating of the supporting evidence .
the cca / acn , stockfleth and kerl 2006 [ 13 ] , and stockfleth et al .
2011 [ 15 ] cpg used a published evidence - based rating scale , while the de berker et al .
[ 12 ] cpg used a rating scale based on evaluator opinion .
cpg rigor is also supported by an evaluation of potential sources of bias , such as conflict of interests ( coi ) .
the editorial independence domain includes a rating of coi and funding sources and had the lowest mean score of all the domains .
coi reporting by the cpg contributors varied greatly .
the stockfleth et al .
2008 [ 14 ] article does address coi and discloses a grant that was received but failed to divulge that the grant came from a pharmaceutical group that produces topical fluorouracil and topical diclofenac products .
the cca / acn and stockfleth et al .
2011 [ 15 ] cpg clearly listed coi .
other articles ( rossi et al. , drake et al . )
[ 10 , 16 ] lacked a coi statement .
the clearly and specifically worded coi and funding statements offered in the cca / acn guideline likely contributed to its having the highest mean score in this domain .
one of the primary purposes of cpg is to make practical , evidence - based recommendations about management of a condition .
a summary of the recommendations from the three cpg with the highest scores is presented in table 3 .
all seven cpg addressed common topical and destructive therapies .
in addition , sun avoidance and sun - protection were included in all cpg as a part of ak prevention and management .
three cpg [ 11 , 12 , 16 ] summarized evidence that aks have a low rate of malignant transformation , but only one [ 12 ] mentioned observation , emollients , and sunscreen as possible management options [ 26 ] .
the results of this study should be considered in the context of the limitations , including cpg that were not included and the effects of score variation between raters and within raters .
since the literature search was completed in 2014 , this review does not include cpg published more recently which may be valuable [ 27 , 28 ] .
this review included four reviewers but the scores for one reviewer were not used because they did not correlate well with the others .
also , the cpg were appraised according to the information contained within them and additional supporting documents were not evaluated .
it is possible that additional information may have increased scores for some of the cpg but was simply missing from the published version of the guidelines .
also , it is important to consider that high - quality methods or well - written cpg do not necessarily produce valid recommendations .
effective cpg are evidence - based with recommendations that are concise and organized , so practical application is facilitated [ 29 - 31 ] .
the cca / acn guideline had the highest scores and included a clear , organized , and concise table at the beginning of the document with helpful evidence - linked recommendations .
however , the reviewers found that the recommendations lacked sufficient detail to apply in a clinical setting .
for example , the recommendations included " cryotherapy achieves consistently high cure rates for solar keratosis " but lacks details that would facilitate use , such as the duration of the freeze - thaw cycle or number of freeze - thaw cycles .
also , the cca / acn ak recommendations were interspersed among the recommendations for nonmelanoma skin cancer .
this made identifying the ak - specific information challenging .
stockfleth et al .
[ 14 ] included a pictorial algorithm and raters thought this was an effective method to present information , yet scores in other domains lagged behind the cca / acn cpg .
in closing , cpg are useful tools to guide clinical practice based on existing evidence ; however it is important for providers and guideline authors to be aware of the features that contribute to a high - quality , practical , and valuable document .

table 3 samples of recommendations from the three cpg with the highest overall scores .
guideline samples of cpg recommendations cca / acn [ 11 ] ( i ) in many cases solar keratosis [ ak ] regresses spontaneously and uncommonly ; it evolves into squamous cell carcinoma ( ii ) the chances that an individual solar keratosis [ ak ] will develop into scc are extremely small ; however when one encounters scc , the chance that it has arisen in association with solar keratosis is very high ( iii ) thickening and tenderness on lateral palpation are signs that a solar keratosis may have developed into invasive squamous cell carcinoma de berker et al .
[ 12 ] ( i ) studies indicate a high spontaneous regression rate in the order of 15 - 25 % for aks over a 1 - year period and a low rate of malignant transformation , less than one in 1,000 per annum. ( ii ) no therapy or emollient is a reasonable option for mild aks ( iii ) sun block applied twice daily for 7 months may protect against development of aks ( iv ) 5 - fluorouracil cream used twice daily for 6 weeks is effective for up to 12 months in clearance of the majority of aks ; due to side - effects of soreness , less aggressive regimens are often used , which may be effective but have not been fully evaluated ( v ) cryosurgery is effective for up to 75 % of lesions in trials comparing it with photodynamic therapy ; it may be particularly superior for thicker lesions but may leave scars stockfleth and kerl ( 2006 ) [ 13 ] ( i ) cryotherapy is often used and controlled studies are missing .
complete responses differ from 75 % to 98 % ; the recurrence rates of aks have been estimated from 1.2 % to 12 % within a 1 - year follow - up period ( ii ) the clinical experience in ak patients receiving mal - pdt shows complete response rate of 70 - 78 % after a single treatment session and 90 % after two treatment sessions one week apart ; negative effects of pdt are local pain , risk of photosensitivity ( mainly for ala ) , and time delay between application of cream and treatment .
photodynamic therapy in comparison to cryotherapy shows significantly better cosmetic results

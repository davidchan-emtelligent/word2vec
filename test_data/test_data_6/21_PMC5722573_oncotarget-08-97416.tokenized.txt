objective this study was designed to investigate the effect of combination of ursolic acid ( ua ) with cisplatin ( ddp ) on cervical cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis .
methods the mrna and protein expressions of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) p65 in cervical cancer cells were examined using rt - pcr and western blot .
mtt and colony formation assays were performed to examine the ddp toxicity and the proliferation ability of cervical cancer cells .
cell morphology was observed by means of hoechst33258 and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .
the apoptosis rate and cell cycle were assessed through flow cytometry assay .
western blot was used to detect the expression of apoptosis - related molecules .
results the mrna and protein expressions of nf - kappab p65 in cervical cancer cells were significantly higher than that in cervical epithelial cells .
the combined treatment of ua and ddp inhibited cervical cancer cell growth and promoted apoptosis more effectively than ddp treatment or ua treatment alone ( p < 0.05 ) .
compared with the ddp group and ua group , the expressions of bcl - 2 and nf - kappab p65 in ddp + ua group were decreased , while the expressions of bax , caspase - 3 and parp cleavage were observably increased .
the expression of nuclear nf - kappab p65 significantly reduced in ua group and ddp + ua group .
si - p65 group displayed a decrease of cell proliferation ability and led to a significant reduction in the number of siha cell colony formation .
conclusion the combination of ua with ddp could more effectively inhibit siha cells proliferation and facilitate cell apoptosis through suppressing nf - kappab p65 .
cervical cancer ursolic acid cisplatin nf - kappab p65 proliferation introduction cervical cancer is considered one of the most common female diseases and also a major cause of cancer - related death in female populations [ 1 ] .
advanced stage cervical cancer cells are extremely invasive , which is more likely to induce cancer cell metastasis and increases the mortality rate of the cancer [ 2 ] .
current therapeutic approaches of the cervical cancer include surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy which may be used individually or in combination with other approaches [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , both surgical removal and radiotherapy can incur long - term complications or sequela , which may exert negative influence on the prognosis of cervical cancer patients [ 5 ] .
ursolic acid ( ua ) , a natural pentacyclic triterpene compound , is extracted from various herbal plants including ligustrum lucidum and eriobotrya japonica [ 6 ] .
like other triterpenoids , ua possesses anti - oxidation , anti - microbial , anti - inflammation and anti - tumor properties [ 7 , 8 ] .
current research has indicated that ua might have an inhibitive function on tumorigenesis and tumor growth [ 9 , 10 ] .
furthermore , ua has been found to induce apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells [ 11 ] , prevent the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells [ 12 ] and induce breast cancer cell apoptosis [ 13 ] .
although the anti - cancer function of ua has been widely studied , the explicit anti - cancer mechanism of ua remains unknown .
cisplatin ( ddp ) is a cell cycle non - specific antineoplastic drug , which is applicable for the treatment of several types of cancers and it is also recommended to applied to chemotherapy for epithelial malignancies , such as lung cancer [ 14 ] , ovarian cancer [ 15 ] , testicular cancer [ 16 ] and cervical cancer [ 17 ] .
ddp and its derivatives have been found to have encouraging anti - cancer effects on different types of cancers [ 18 ] .
ddp - based chemotherapy along with radiotherapy is the most widely accepted approach for the treatment of cervical cancer [ 19 ] , but the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy is still limited [ 20 ] .
therefore , many researchers encourage the combined method of chemotherapies with multiple therapeutic drugs to improve overall treatment efficacy .
additionally , ddp is an efficacious anti - tumor agent and exerts cytotoxic effects on cancer cells and promotes cancerous cell apoptosis .
moreover , ddp is found to have the capability to induce the activation of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) in cancer cells [ 21 ] .
nf - kappab is a family of transcription factors which play a significant role in the regulation of diverse genes involved in cell proliferation , inflammation , immune response and oncogenesis [ 22 ] .
the activation of nf - kappab , which is induced by chemotherapeutic compounds in cancer cells , has a negative impact on the treatment efficiency of cancer [ 23 ] .
it has been reported that nf - kappab is constitutively activated in high - grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinomas of human uterine cervix [ 24 ] .
numerous previous studies suggested that nf - kappab activation not only contributes to the migration and invasion of cancer cells , but also affects cell survival and gene expressions related to tumor proliferation and metastasis [ 25 - 27 ] .
five subunits of nf - kappab have been identified , namely , gp105 / p50 ( nf - b1 ) , p100 / p52 ( nf - b2 ) , p65 ( rela ) , relb , and c - rel [ 28 ] .
the most common and best - characterized form of nf - kappab is the p50 / p65 heterodimer , which is widely expressed in the cns and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression [ 29 ] .
in the current study , we studied on the effect of ua on nf - kappab p65 .
we hypothesized that ua may be able to inhibit nf - kappab p65 activation [ 30 ] .
until now , little evidence of the synergism between ua and ddp in the treatment of human cervical cancer has been revealed .
therefore , we carried out this study in order to clarify the synergistic anti - cancer effect of ua and ddp on human cervical cancer cells .
we suspected that ua coupled with ddp may offer superior therapeutic effects on human cervical cancer .
results nf - kappab p65 expression was up - regulated in cervical cancer cells cells were collected at logarithmic growth period .
nf - kappab p65 expression was detected using rt - pcr and western blot .
the mrna expression level of nf - kappab p65 was significantly increased in cervical cancer cell lines hela , siha , c - 33a and me - 180 when compared with human cervical epithelial cells h8 ( figure 1a , all p < 0.01 ) .
as shown in figure 1b and 1c , the protein expression level of nf - kappab p65 was consistent with the trend of the nf - kappab p65 mrna expression .
notably , siha cells presented a relatively high expression in nf - kappab p65 .

ua enhanced ddp - induced proliferation inhibition of cervical cancer cells the proliferation of cervical cancer cells was observed by mtt assay for activity and colony formation assay for amount .
as suggested by mtt assay , a dose - dependent effect was clearly observed in ddp - treated siha cells and the proliferation rate decreased as the dosage increased .
similarly , there was a dose - response effect in cells treated with ua. ddp in conjunction with ua also exhibited a similar dose - response impact on cells ( figure 2a ) .
to avoid the increase of necrotic cells caused by excessive concentration , 4mum ddp , 8mum ua and 4mum ddp + 8mum ua were selected for subsequent experiments .
the joint treatment of ddp and ua significantly reduced the proliferation of siha cells compared with the ddp or ua treatment solely ( all p < 0.01 , figure 2b ) .
colony formation assay was also conducted to test the proliferation of siha cells treated with ddp or ua. as shown in figure 3a , dosing groups displayed a prominent reduction in the colony formation of siha cells in comparison with the control group .
compared with the ddp or ua single treatment groups , the combined treatment of ddp and ua significantly diminished the colony formation capabilities of siha cells ( all p < 0.01 ) .
other cell lines showed the same trend in siha cells , though the proliferation of cells in other cell lines was lower than in siha cells ( figures 2c - 2h and 3b - 3d , all p < 0.01 ) .
all of these results revealed that ua could increase ddp - induced proliferation inhibition of cervical cancer cells .
the experimental results of all cell lines have no connection with hpv phenotype and the siha cells were selected for subsequent experiments objects due to their higher sensitivity .

ua promoted ddp - induced siha cell morphologic changes the nuclei of apoptotic cells and typical apoptotic bodies stained by hoechst33258 were observed under fluorescence microscopy .
nuclear condensation and fragmentation were observed at 24h after ddp therapy with ua ( figure 4a ) .
transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) showed integrity of cell membrane in the control group .
the cells in the dosing groups , particularly in combination ddp + ua treatment group , presented apoptotic features of cells , such as cell shrinkage , nuclear chromatin concentration and broken cell membranes with nuclear lysis ( figure 4b ) .
these results demonstrated that the ultrastructure of siha cells was severely damaged under the joint influence of ddp and ua. figure 4 ua promoted ddp - induced siha cell morphological changes ( a ) determination of apoptosis in the siha cells 24h post ddp in the presence of ua was analyzed by hoechst 33258 staining method ( x200 ) .

results from flow cytometry analysis showed that the apoptosis percentage ( mean +/ - sd ) of siha cells treated with ddp ( 12.29 +/ - 0.66 ) % was significantly increased when compared with those treated with ua ( 9.87 +/ - 0.31 ) % ( p < 0.01 ) , whereas that of cells in the control group was significantly lower ( 4.11 +/ - 0.98 ) % ( both p < 0.01 ) .
for siha cells , the combined treatment of ddp and ua significantly elevated the apoptotic rate of the cells in comparison with either ddp treatment group or ua treatment group ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
as shown in figure 5c and 5d , cell mitosis was suppressed and most of cells were arrested in g0 / g1 in dosing groups , especially in ddp + ua group ( all p < 0.05 ) , the percentage of apoptotic cells exhibit in supplementary table 1 .
these findings demonstrated that the combined treatment of ua with ddp further induced the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells .

the expression of apoptosis - related molecules and cell cycle factors western blot was used to detect the expression of apoptosis - related molecules , including bcl - 2 , bax , caspase - 3 and parp .
the expression level of bcl - 2 was significantly down - regulated while the expressions of bax and caspase - 3 as well as parp cleavage were significantly up - regulated in ddp or ua treatment groups when compared with the control group ( all p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , the expression level of bcl - 2 in the cells treated with both ddp and ua significantly decreased , whereas the expressions of bax , caspase - 3 and parp cleavage significantly increased in comparison with the ddp treatment group ( all p < 0.05 ) ( figure 6a and 6b , supplementary table 2 ) .

we speculated that the cell cycle changes were incurred by the changing cell cycle factors .
to verify our hypothesis , western blot was used to examine the protein expression levels of the cell cycle factors .
the results displayed that the ddp group and ua group had considerably higher p21 expression and lower expressions of cyclin d1 and cyclin e than control group ( all p < 0.05 ) .
the expression of p21 in ddp + ua group dramatically increased , whereas the expressions of cyclin d1 and cyclin e significantly decreased compared with those in ddp group ( all p < 0.05 ) ( figure 6c and 6d , supplementary table 3 ) .
ua restrained ddp - induced nf - kappab p65 activation in siha cells we also assessed the influence of ua on ddp - induced nf - kappab p65 activation in siha cells .
as suggested by figure 7a and 7b and supplementary table 4 , the expression of nuclear nf - kappab p65 significantly reduced in ua group and ddp + ua group in comparison with the ddp group ( all p < 0.05 ) .
mtt and colony formation assays were employed to examine ddp toxicity .
compared with control group , si - p65 group displayed a decrease of cell proliferation ability ( p < 0.05 ) .
moreover , the proliferation of cells in the ddp + si - p65 decreased more dramatically than that in ddp group ( p < 0.01 ) .
there was no significant difference between control group and nc group ( figure 7c ) .
as shown in figure 7d , si - p65 led to a significant reduction in the number of siha cell colony formation in comparison with the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , the combined treatment of ddp and si - p65 diminished the colony formation capabilities of siha cells more significantly than ddp group ( all p < 0.01 ) .
similarly , there was no significant difference between control and nc groups .
all the above results indicated that ua could inhibit ddp - induced nf - kappab activation in siha cells .

discussion cervical cancer is one of the most disturbing health issues in females and it is also the second most common cause of cancer - related death in female population around the world [ 1 ] .
but both surgical removal and radiotherapy can bring about long - term complications or sequela , which give rise to negative influence on the prognosis of cervical cancer patients [ 1 ] .
in our study , we tried to figure out the anti - cancer function of ua , ddp and the combination ua and ddp on cervical cancer cells .
a large number of studies have reported that nf - kappab which play a significant role in the regulation of diverse genes involved in cell proliferation , inflammation , immune response and oncogenesis [ 22 ] .
the p50 / p65 , the member of nf - kappab , is widely expressed in the cns and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression .
in the current study , we studied on the effect of ua on nf - kappab p65 firstly .
mtt assay , colony formation assay and flow cytometry assay revealed that ua augmented the ddp - induced cell proliferation inhibition and facilitated apoptosis of cervical cancer cells via the suppression of nf - kappab p65 activation .
conventional chemotherapies , including platinum - based and non - platinum - based regimens , are currently applied to the treatment of cervical cancer .
these chemotherapies are associated with strong non - specific cytotoxicity , restricted therapeutic indices , adverse effects and chemo - resistance to single agents [ 20 , 31 ] .
therefore , the treatment of chemotherapies combined with several agents is considered a promising therapeutic strategy , which can help enhance the efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of cervical cancer treatment .
many chemotherapeutants like ddp can exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis .
ddp also can activate a significant transcription factor nf - kappab in the process of human tumor pathogenesis [ 32 ] .
we determined the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells to reflect ddp toxicity after nf - kappab p65 was silenced .
we also found that exogenous expression of nf - kappab reduced the toxicity of ddp .
combined with the results of the mrna and protein expression levels of nf - kappab p65 , we came to the conclusion that the increased apoptosis induced by ua in ddp treated cervical cancer cells was due to nf - kappab suppression .
this result verified the findings reported by xing et al. that nf - kappab is responsible for tumor cell survival , tumor cell growth and direct activation of anti - apoptotic gene products [ 33 ] .
atoxigenic nf - kappab suppressors may contribute to a reduced anti - apoptotic threshold of drug resistance , potentially enlarging the sensitivity of medications and thus the suppressive effects of medications on tumor cells may become more significant [ 34 ] .
a large number of studies have reported that the overall effectiveness of treatments for cervical cancer is likely to be enhanced through the combination of various chemotherapy agents [ 34 , 35 ] .
previous studies have reported that the combination of ua17 ( an ua derivative ) and ddp could enhance cell growth inhibition via the induction of cell cycle arrest at s phase and g1 / s transition , as well as apoptosis [ 36 ] .
this finding was consistent with our results as presented in figure 5 .
we also verified our hypothesis that the causes of the changes in cell cycles were the altered cell cycle factors including p21 , cyclin e and cyclin d1 .
our study showed that the combination of ua and ddp down - regulated bcl - 2 expression levels and up - regulated the expression levels of bax and caspase - 3 .
this indicated that ddp - induced cervical cancer cell apoptosis was enhanced via the down - regulation of bcl - 2 expression and the up - regulation of bax and caspase - 3 expressions .
ua is a pentacyclic triterpenoid which may produce multifarious biologic activities including hepatoprotective , antibacterial , anti - proliferative and immunomodulatory activities [ 37 ] .
ua induces the release of apoptosis factors from mitochondrion in m4beu cells and inhibits tumor progression , tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through the suppression of lipoxygenase , cox - 2 , mmp - 9 and nos expressions [ 11 , 38 ] .
in addition , ua stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic mechanism characterized by bax over - expression , bcl - 2 under - expression and the breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential [ 9 ] .
this intrinsic apoptotic mechanism also includes caspase - 9 - mediated cascade reaction which culminates in caspase - 3 activation , a significant mediator of cell apoptosis [ 39 ] .
in the current study , only one human cervical cancer cell line siha ( hpv 16 positive ) was used in our study and in vivo experiment was lacked in our study , thus the influence of ua and ddp on cervical cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis may not be completely representative .
additionally , whether the effects of ua and ddp have synergistic effects or additive effects has not been fully explored .
therefore , there still exist some limitations in this study , which need to be addressed in future researches .
the molecular mechanism of ua in combination with ddp in the treatment of cervical cancer needs to be further investigated .
in summary , the synergism of ua and ddp could significantly induce cell apoptosis and enhance growth inhibition of human cervical cancer cells by suppressing nf - kappab p65 activation .
the findings suggested that the combined approach of ua with ddp may generate better therapeutic effects on cervical cancer compared with conventional treatments .
ua might be a novel adjuvant therapeutic drug for the treatment of cervical cancer .

then , cells were re - suspended in prepared sample buffer containing 20 mul 5 mug / ml propidium iodide and 50 mul 10 mg / ml rnase a. cells were then incubated in the dark for 10 min at 37 degreesc .
annexin v - fluorescein isothiocyanate ( annexin v - fitc ) and propidium iodide ( pi , sigma ) apoptosis detection kit ( becton dickinson , nj , usa ) were used to evaluate the apoptosis status of siha cells .
cells were re - suspended in binding buffer and mediated to a concentration level of 0.5 ~ 1 x 106 / ml. the suspension ( 100 mul ) was incubated with 5 mul of annexin v - fitc and pi for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark .
after 400mul binding buffer was added into each tube , apoptotic cells were evaluated with flow cytometry ( beckman fc 500 mcl / mpl , usa ) .
western blot assay the expression level of nf - kappab p65 , bcl - 2 , bax , caspase - 3 , parp , parp cleavage , p21 , cyclin d1 and cyclin e were examined by western blot .
after 48 - hour treatment , cellular proteins were extracted and nuclear extracts were obtained using the nuclear protein extraction kit ( beyotime institute of biotechnology , china ) .
bca method was adopted for protein concentration detection .
an equal amount of proteins in each group was loaded and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis ( sds - page ) .
the proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes ( pvdf ) and blocked with 5 % non - fat milk .
the membranes were then probed with primary antibodies against p65 , bcl - 2 , bax , caspase - 3 , parp , parp cleavage , p21 , cyclin d1 , cyclin e and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) ( mouse anti - human , cst , american ) respectively at 4degreesc overnight , .
membranes were washed three times using tbst ( 10 min each ) .
horseradish - peroxidase - linked secondary antibodies ( rabbit anti - mouse ) were then added and membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. after this , membranes were washed three times ( 10 min each ) with tbst , and signal detection was carried out using super ecl plus detection reagent kit ( applygen technologies inc. , china ) .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19.0 software .
significant differences in numerical data ( mean +/ - sd ) among different groups were compared using the analysis of variance ( anova ) .
p - value < 0.05 indicated a statistical significance .

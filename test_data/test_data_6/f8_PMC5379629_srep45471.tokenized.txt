understanding of lipid metabolism in microalgae is important to isolate oleaginous strain capable of overproducing lipids .
it has been reported that reducing starch biosynthesis can enhance lipid accumulation .
however , the metabolic mechanism controlling carbon partitioning from starch to lipids in microalgae remains unclear , thus complicating the genetic engineering of algal strains .
we here used " dynamic " metabolic profiling and essential transcription analysis of the oleaginous green alga chlamydomonas sp .
jsc4 for the first time to demonstrate the switching mechanisms from starch to lipid synthesis using salinity as a regulator , and identified the metabolic rate - limiting step for enhancing lipid accumulation ( e.g. , pyruvate - to - acetyl - coa ) .
these results , showing salinity - induced starch - to - lipid biosynthesis , will help increase our understanding of dynamic carbon partitioning in oleaginous microalgae .
moreover , we successfully determined the changes of several key lipid - synthesis - related genes ( e.g. , acetyl - coa carboxylase , pyruvate decarboxylase , acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , acetyl - coa synthetase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase ) and starch - degradation related genes ( e.g. , starch phosphorylases ) , which could provide a breakthrough in the marine microalgal production of biodiesel .
increasing global energy demands have resulted in considerable effort to construct a recycling - oriented society utilizing novel sustainable energy sources1 .
biomass has significant potential as an effective , environmentally benign renewable energy source that is biodegradable and non - toxic2 .
microalgae are promising biodiesel producers due to their high growth rate , high co2 fixation efficiency , high environmental stress tolerance , and the capacity to accumulate a large amount of lipid without competing for arable land and potable water2345 .
however , the commercial production of microalgal biodiesel currently faces the serious challenges of low lipid productivity and high production costs267 .
enhancing the economic feasibility of microalgal biodiesel will require critical engineering innovations in large - scale cultivation and breakthroughs for regulating lipid metabolism8 .
microalgae typically accumulates energy - rich compounds such as lipid and starch under environmental stress such as nitrogen depletion and high salinity by redirecting carbon flow towards these compounds for storage689 .
synthetic pathway to produce lipid and starch by co2 fixation have been determined in chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( c. reinhardtii ) ( fig. 1 ) ; the genes encoding phosphoglucoisomerase ( pgi ) , phosphoglucomutase ( pgm ) , adp - glucose phosphorylase ( agpp ) , alpha - amylase ( amy ) and starch phosphorylase ( sp ) are related to starch biosynthesis and degradation1011 .
also , the genes encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) , pyruvate - ferredoxin oxidoreductase ( pfor ) , acetyl - coa ( accoa ) carboxylase ( acc ) , pyruvate decarboxylase ( pdc ) , acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ( aldh ) , accoa synthetase ( acs ) , and glycerol 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gpdh ) are related to lipid biosynthesis11121314151617 .
the compartmentalization of carbon metabolism in c. reinhardti was reviewed by johnson et al. in detail9 .
siaut et al. established that microalgae initially synthesize starch for a short - term energy reserve , then lipid is synthesized as the long - term energy storage compound18 .
thus , previous studies have demonstrated that the lipid content of microalgae can be enhanced by switching carbon partitioning from starch to lipid synthesis using starch - related - gene - knockout approaches , while the cell growth of such engineered strains is inhibited18192021 .
slower cell growth will result in a decreased lipid productivity even if the lipid content is improved .
another current major limitation of microalgal biodiesel production is the shortage of freshwater resources22 .
this highlights the importance of developing microalgal strains that are highly tolerant of seawater .
moderate salinity stress may induce lipid accumulation in some microalgae , but also may cause growth inhibition823 .
metabolomics is a powerful tool for functional biology242526 and allows the comprehensive profiling of metabolite accumulation in specific biosynthesis pathways21 .
although several studies have focused on the pool size of key metabolites during partial metabolic profiling , there are no reports describing the regulation of " dynamic " metabolism in microalgae2728 .
in addition , transcriptomic analysis is vital for providing comprehensive profiling of the mrna levels of key enzymes related to environmental stress2930 .
we have developed feasible methods for lipid production using the oleaginous green alga chlamydomonas sp .
jsc4 , which was isolated from the south taiwan coast233132 .
as a hopeful biomass producer , jsc4 possesses advantageous characteristics such as high growth potential and high starch / lipid content2331 .
importantly , lipid accumulation in jsc4 is effectively triggered by addition of sea salt ( ss ) in combination with nitrogen depletion , and the highest lipid productivity of 312 mg l - 1 d - 1 per unit dry cell weight ( dcw ) was attained previously under the photoautotrophic conditions31 .
also , dynamic metabolic profiling using an in vivo13c labeling was carried out under different light intensities to reveal carbon metabolism after co2 fixation3133 .
for efficient lipid production by microalgae , it is required to understand the regulatory networks that control carbon partition from starch to lipid9 .
however , the starch - to - lipid switching mechanisms in chlamydomonas spp. under the salinity condition has yet to be elucidated .
in this study , the switching mechanism was explored by monitoring in vivo dynamic metabolic profiles .
furthermore , mrna regulation of the key genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis / biodegradation was assessed for the first time in jsc4 .
this study demonstrates that salinity is a powerful regulator for switching lipid / starch biosynthesis , and reveals the key mechanisms for maximizing the lipid production in jsc4 .
results feasibility of using jsc4 as a biodiesel producer the growth performance of jsc4 under salinity stress was investigated by cultivating under 0 % , 1 % , or 2 % ( w / v ) ss ( fig. 2 ) .
high biomass levels were obtained in medium containing 0 % and 1 % ss ( 5.6 g l - 1 and 6.4 g l - 1 after 9 days' cultivation , respectively ) .
jsc4 exhibits significant lipid accumulation more than 45 % of dcw under 1 % and 2 % ss , which is obviously superior than the lipid content triggered by single stress of nitrogen depletion ( table 1 ) .
this result indicates that the salinity stress coupled with nitrogen depletion significantly improves the lipid content of jsc4 .
the highest lipid productivity of 358 mg l - 1 d - 1 was provided under 1 % ss , which is superior than our previous results ( in the range of 233 - 312 mg l - 1 d - 1 ) 2331 and previous studies ( table s1 ) .
energy storage compound switched from starch to lipid under salinity stress since most of the carbohydrate in chlamydomonas spp. is starch19 , we compared the time - course profiles of the total carbohydrate and total lipid content under different ss concentrations ( fig. 2 and table 1 ) .
at 0 % ss , the carbohydrate content sharply increased from 33.8 % ( day 2 ) to 61.3 % ( day 4 ) and remained constant thereafter , whereas the lipid content gradually increased and attained a maximum value of 32.8 % ( day 8 ) .
the carbohydrate content in 1 % or 2 % ss also increased to around 60 % during early - stage culture ( day 2 to day 4 ) , but then dramatically decreased after 4 days' cultivation , in parallel with an increase in the lipid content .
a maximum lipid content of 46.5 % and 56.9 % was obtained in 1 % and 2 % ss , respectively .
these results illustrated that the dominant energy storage compound was rapidly switched from starch to lipid upon salinity stress .
in addition , we observed salinity - induced lipid accumulation under a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .
the images depicted in fig. s1 clearly show many large oil drops formed under salinity stress .
taken together , we demonstrate that energy - flow was shifted from carbohydrate ( mainly starch ) to lipid by salinity stress .
time - course profiles of key metabolite in starch and lipid synthesis with / without salinity stress to investigate the metabolic mechanism at the lipid production stage , jsc4 cells were cultivated under 0 % or 2 % ss for 3 , 5 and 7 days , and the intracellular metabolites were analyzed comprehensively .
in the whole metabolites , we focused on the key metabolites related to starch and lipid synthesis and quantified the pool sizes ( fig. 3 ) .
the pool size of 3 - phosphoglycerate ( 3pga ) was similar under the two conditions .
starch is synthesized in chlamydomonas spp. cells by the polymerization of adp - glucose ( adp - glc ) 19 .
the pool sizes of the sugar phosphates ( i.e. , fructose 6 - phosphate ( f6p ) and glucose 6 - phosphate ( g6p )) were significantly higher under 0 % ss at day 5 and 7 .
taken these results with the carbohydrate content shown in fig. 2 , high pool sizes of these metabolites would be corresponding to high carbohydrate content under 0 % ss. lipid is biosynthesized from glycerol 3 - phosphate ( g3p ) and malonyl - coa9 .
the pool sizes of g3p , pyruvate , and accoa were higher under salinity stress ( fig. 3 ) .
during the lipid accumulation under 2 % ss ( day 5 and 7 ) , the pool sizes of g3p , pyruvate , and accoa were higher than under 0 % ss. when combined the results obtained in fig. 2 , the pool sizes of these metabolites would be corresponding to the lipid content and vital for lipid accumulation .
effects of salinity on 13c incorporation from co2 into metabolic intermediates the newly accumulated level of each metabolic intermediate was determined by an in vivo13c - labeling assay31 using 13co2 .
13co2 was transported and then fixed into 3pga by ribulose 1,5 - bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase ( rubp ) .
the assimilation rate of carbon into each metabolite is reflected by the 13c labeling amounts and thus can help elucidate the dynamics of starch and lipid biosynthesis .
13c labeling , in this study , is defined as the amount of carbon that is newly incorporated into metabolites .
figure 4 shows the 13c labeling for several metabolites in cells cultivated under 0 % and 2 % ss. all these13c - labeled metabolites were obviously decreased at from day 3 to day 7 .
higher 13c labeling values for f6p , g6p , and glucose 1 - phosphate ( g1p ) were observed under 0 % ss than 2 % ss on day 5 , whereas the 13c labeling of g3p was significantly increased at day 3 and 5 under 2 % ss. moreover , the 13c labeling of pyruvate and accoa was higher under 2 % ss at day 5 and 7 .
relative quantification of mrna levels related to lipid and starch synthesis with / without salinity stress a better understanding of salinity - induced starch - to - lipid conversion in jsc4 requires time - course transcription analyses of the genes related to starch biosynthesis / degradation and lipid biosynthesis .
genome sequencing revealed that key genes in the lipid and starch metabolism pathway are conserved between c. reinhardtii and jsc4 ( fig. 1 ) .
the switching of starch / lipid synthesis induced by salinity stress described above was substantiated by quantifying mrna levels by quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) ( fig. 5 ) .
transcription of genes involved in synthesis and degradation of starch1011 was measured simultaneously .
at day 5 , the mrna levels of starch - synthesis - related genes such as pgi and pgm were significantly higher under 0 % ss than under 2 % ss. in particular , the level of agpp drastically increased more than 10,000 - fold from day 3 to day 5 .
the mrna levels of enzymes involved in starch degradation , such as sp1 and sp2 , were significantly higher under 2 % ss than under 0 % ss. the levels of sp1 and sp2 dramatically increased from day 3 to day 5 , and the level of sp2 further increased 13.5 - fold from day 5 to day 7 .
the level of amy1 under salinity stress was higher than that under 0 % ss at day 3 and 5 , while amy2 expression was lower under 2 % ss. next , transcription of genes involved in lipid synthesis11121314151617 was measured .
determination of the mrna expression involved in lipid synthesis showed that pfor mrna under 2 % ss increased approximately 10.5 - fold from day 3 to day 5 and then remained constant ; these levels are much higher than under 0 % ss. the levels of pdc , aldh , acs2 , and acs3 under 2 % ss were also significantly higher than under 0 % ss. in particular , pdc showed 8.3 - fold increase from day 3 to day 7 under 2 % ss .
acs2 and acs3 were enhanced from day 3 to day 5 under 2 % ss ( 5.7 - and 18.4 - fold , respectively ) .
acc in chlamydomonas spp. contains biotin carboxyl carrier protein ( bccp ) , biotin carboxylase ( bc ) , and carboxyltransferase alpha - subunit ( alphact ) and beta - subunit ( betact ) 16 .
the mrna levels of bccp , bc , alphact , and betact was constantly higher under 2 % ss. gpdh expression was higher under 2 % ss at day 3 , but dramatically decreased thereafter , whereas extremely low signals of gpdh were detected under 0 % ss throughout the cultivation period .
determination of starch - degrading enzyme activity under salinity stress amy and sp activities in the cells were evaluated on day 5 and 7 to investigate the starch degradation pathway affected by salinity .
amy activity was not largely affected by the addition of ss ( fig. 6 ) .
in contrast , sp activity was significantly increased under 2 % ss ( 3.2 - and 10.5 - fold at day 5 and 7 , respectively ) .
discussion the economic feasibility of microalgal biodiesel can be enhanced by selecting / engineering a strain capable of maintaining high biomass production and rapid accumulation of lipid under environmental stress6 .
we previously reported that jsc4 is not only a robust producer of both biomass and lipid but a strain with high tolerances of irradiance and salt , which is quite suitable to apply for seawater - based outdoor cultivation2331 .
nitrogen stress is one of the key factors for enhancing lipid accumulation in many microalgal species3 , however , the single stress of nitrogen depletion could not always induce the lipid accumulation of microalgae .
in some microalgal strains , combining the dual stresses are required6 .
salinity is also an important factor affecting the lipid content of some microalgae species , but their lipid productivity under high salinity stress is usually lower due to the concomitant strong inhibition of cell growth6 .
metabolic profiling enables us to discover the metabolic mechanism for improving lipid accumulation in a microalga34. by utilizing knowledges of the lipid metabolism pathway , we can construct an oil - overproducing algal strain through genetic engineering2034 .
however , the mechanism of salinity - induced lipid synthesis in jsc4 has not been elucidated in previous studies233132 .
in this study , dynamic metabolic profiling together with transcription analysis under salinity stress were conducted for the first time , and the switching mechanisms from starch to lipid synthesis in jsc4 was demonstrated .
we also successfully identified the metabolic rate - limiting step ( e.g. , pyruvate - to - accoa ) and several key genes ( e.g. , acc , pdc , aldh , acs , pfor , and sp ) for enhancing lipid accumulation in jsc4 .
we show that salinity stress reduces starch and concomitantly enhances lipid accumulation ( fig. 2 ) , and significantly increases the pool sizes of key lipid - synthesis - related metabolites ( fig. 3 ) .
wang et al. indicated that salt causes osmotic stress , resulting in a dramatic accumulation of glycerol in dunaliella tertiolecta and dunaliella bardawil35 .
this is in agreement with the rapid accumulation of g3p under 2 % ss shown in this study , since g3p is an important intermediate for glycerol synthesis .
in fig. 4 , the 13c labeling of g1p was slightly higher at day 5 under 0 % ss , indicating that more g6p would be converted to g1p , and that the reaction from g6p to g1p might be activated to maintain a high starch content .
in addition , a much higher 13c labeling of g6p was observed at day 5 under 0 % ss. carbohydrate accumulation in chlamydomonas spp. is mainly regulated by agpp activity as the rate - limiting step192136 .
we here propose that enhancing the reaction rate from g6p to g1p could also play an important role in improving starch accumulation in microalgae .
in transgenic tobacco plants , overexpression of plastidial pgm increased starch content37 .
this research may support our proposal .
the 13c labeling of g3p was significantly higher under 2 % ss , particularly at day 3 and 5 ( fig. 4 ) .
the 13c labeling of accoa under 2 % ss was also higher compared to under 0 % ss. thus , the higher 13c labeling of g3p and accoa under ss may correlate with higher lipid accumulation in the cell .
on the other hand , the 13c labeling of pyruvate under salinity stress was clearly higher than that of accoa , likely due to not only an increase of carbon influx into pyruvate but also a limitation in the conversion to accoa .
in fig. 3 , pyruvate was accumulated in the presence of ss , while the level of accoa was not largely increased .
the results suggest that the lipid biosynthesis can be further improved by accelerating the metabolic reaction from pyruvate to accoa. by tracking the dynamic carbon flow , we found the likely rate - limiting steps in starch / lipid synthesis ( e.g. , starch : g6p - to - g1p ; lipid : pyruvate - to - accoa ) , and proposed the strategy of starch - to - lipid conversion under salinity stress to effectively enhance lipid accumulation in microalgae .
decreased 13c labeling of these metabolites at day 5 and 7 ( fig. 4 ) suggests that lipid production was performed not only by using newly incorporated co2 but also by using intracellular carbon sources ( i.e. carbohydrates ) .
level of key gene transcripts is important for understanding the metabolic pathway .
although previous transcriptomic analyses in c. reinhardtii shed light on carbon partitioning between lipid and starch9 , the levels of key transcripts related to starch and lipid biosynthesis and starch degradation under salinity stress were here evaluated simultaneously and dynamically for the first time in jsc4 ( fig. 5 ) .
lower levels of the pgi and pgm transcript under 2 % ss indicate that the conversion of f6p to g1p via g6p can be retarded to slow down starch biosynthesis .
at day 5 , the drastically increased agpp transcript under 0 % ss may correlate to a high content of starch in the cells since the metabolic reaction by agpp should be the main step for producing starch21 .
interestingly , the significant enhancement of the sp1 / sp2 transcripts under 2 % ss at day 5 and 7 indicates that sp1 and sp2 were immediately activated during salinity stress , thus aiding the switch from starch to lipid synthesis. with the results shown in fig. 6 , these findings clearly indicate that the upregulation of genes related to starch degradation by salinity stress could lead to the production of more sp , and the concomitant generation of more lipids. c. reinhardtii possesses functional amy and sp as starch degradation enzymes38 , however , it accumulates both lipid and starch under salinity stress18 .
under salinity stress , the jsc4 cells produce lipid by degrading starch , and this would be the characteristic feature of this strain .
we focused on characterizing the mrna levels of lipid biosynthesis - related genes ( fig. 5 ) .
the dramatic increase in pfor transcript under 2 % ss and the extremely low levels of pdh transcript was observed .
these results raise the possibility that the metabolic reaction from pyruvate to accoa may be primarily catalyzed by pfor , but not pdh .
in the oleaginous green alga chlorella desiccata , activation of the pdh - bypass , which consists of pdc , aldh and acs , is required for higher lipid biosynthesis under nitrogen deprivation39 .
in jsc4 , expression levels of pdc , aldh , and acs were increased under ss. this result suggests that the pdh - bypass might also play important roles in lipid production under salinity condition .
notably , because gpdh is a critical enzyme in catalyzing the reversible conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) to g3p , the high level of the gpdh transcript at day 3 under salinity stress indicates that large amounts of g3p would be produced and be available for lipid synthesis , which consistent with the results in figs 3 and 4 .
thus , by using transcription analysis combined with metabolic profiling , we suggest that carbon flow between starch and lipid biosynthesis in microalgae can be regulated by salinity stress .
there is a possibility that some gene functions are also regulated at post - translational levels .
further examination of the specific enzymatic activity is required to strengthen the hypothesis obtained in this study .
the pool size of metabolites in chlamydomonas spp. has been evaluated by metabolic profiling analysis .
bolling and fiehn reported changes in the pool sizes of metabolites in c. reinhardtii following the depletion of various components of the growth medium27 .
however , changes in the pool size are not always reflected in the dynamic metabolism40 .
accordingly , the dynamic metabolic turnover and carbon fraction of these metabolites must be investigated4142 .
recently , kempa et al. reported the turnover of metabolites in c. reinhardtii by analyzing 13c isotopomer flow , however , it does not shed light on how to enhance a specific metabolic reaction41 .
our study is the first report to provide comprehensive information regarding dynamic carbon flux and transcription related to the switching mechanisms between starch and lipid biosynthesis .
increase in cellular biomass was observed after nitrate depletion ( fig. 2 ) , likely due to the utilization of intracellular nitrogen source including protein .
as previously reported , the jsc4 strain demonstrates protein reduction after nitrate depletion23 .
some algae have shown cellular biomass increase along with intracellular protein reduction after the nitrogen depletion2328 .
further study is required to elucidate the biomass increment mechanism .
we suppose that the reason why jsc4 accumulates lipid under the salinity condition would be related to the fact that they originally live in the brackish - water region23 .
in the brackish water , nutrients required for photosynthesis might be sufficiently supplied from river .
when jsc4 is carried to the open ocean by oceanic current , they might suffer from both starvation and salinity stress , which triggers accumulation of lipid as an energy source for long term survival .
as the freshwater microalga c. reinhardtii , which was originally isolated from amherst in the united states42 , does not carry out the salinity - induced carbon flow switching18 , it might be a brackish water - specific response to starvation .

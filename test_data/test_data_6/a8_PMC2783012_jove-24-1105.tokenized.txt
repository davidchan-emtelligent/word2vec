the influenza a viral genome consists of eight negative - sense , single stranded rna molecules , individually packed with multiple copies of the influenza a nucleoprotein ( np ) into viral ribonulceoprotein particles ( vrnps ) .
the influenza vrnps are enclosed within the viral envelope .
during cell entry , however , these vrnp complexes are released into the cytoplasm , where they gain access to the host nuclear transport machinery .
in order to study the nuclear import of influenza vrnps and the replication of the influenza genome , it is useful to work with isolated vrnps so that other components of the virus do not interfere with these processes .
here , we describe a procedure to purify these vrnps from the influenza a virus .
the procedure starts with the disruption of the influenza a virion with detergents in order to release the vrnp complexes from the enveloped virion .
the vrnps are then separated from the other components of the influenza a virion on a 33 - 70 % discontinuous glycerol gradient by velocity sedimentation .
the fractions obtained from the glycerol gradient are then analyzed on via sds - page after staining with coomassie blue .
the peak fractions containing np are then pooled together and concentrated by centrifugation .
after concentration , the integrity of the vrnps is verified by visualization of the vrnps by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining .
the glycerol gradient purification is a modification of that from kemler et al .
( 1994 ) 1 , and the negative staining has been performed by wu et al .
( 2007 ). 2 protocol part 1 : disruption of the influenza a virion add 750 microl of mnt buffer ( 20 mm mes , 150 mm nacl , 30 mm tris , ph 7.5 ) into one beckman polycarbonate centrifuge tube ( 11 mm x 34 mm ) designed to fit into a tla - 120.2 rotor for use in a beckman optima max - e ultracentrifuge .
add 500 microl of the influenza a virus ( h3n2 x - 31 a / aichi / 68 strain ; 2 mg / ml ) into that tube .
mix the virus with the mnt buffer by pipetting up and down several times .
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 109,000 x g , 4 degreesc , in a beckman optima max - e centrifuge using a tla - 120.2 rotor .
remove the supernatant , and resuspend the pellet in 500 microl disruption buffer ( 100 mm kcl , 5 mm mgcl2 , 5 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 50 mm octylglucoside , 10 mg / ml lysolecithin , 1.5 mm dithiothreitol , 100 mm mes , ph 5.5 ) .
vortex vigorously , and then shake at 31 degreesc for 20 minutes in an eppendorf thermomixer .
part 2 : glycerol gradient sediment velocity centrifugation prepare a glycerol gradient by placing the following amounts of glycerol into a beckman ultraclear centrifuge tube ( 13 mm x 51 mm ) : 1 ml 70 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0.75 ml 50 % glycerol , 0.375 ml 40 % glycerol , and 1.8 ml 33 % glycerol .
glycerol solutions are made by mixing pure glycerol with nm buffer ( 150 mm nacl , 50 mm mes , ph 5.5 ) .
also prepare a balance tube containing both glycerol and buffer .
vortex the disrupted viral sample again , and load it onto the glycerol gradient .
centrifuge the gradient for 3.75 hours at 217,000 x g , 4 degreesc , in a beckman mls - 50 swinging - bucket rotor .
after the centrifugation is complete , manually collect 250 microl aliquots of the gradient starting from the top of the tube .
keep fractions on ice or at 4 degreesc .
part 3 : analysis of the glycerol gradient fractions by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis remove 20 microl from each fraction to a fresh tube .
add 5 microl of 5x sds - page sample buffer .
heat to 95 degreesc for 5 minutes .
spin down the samples briefly and load them onto a 10 % polyacrylamide gel , and include molecular weight markers in one of the wells .
run the samples on the gel until the bromphenol blue loading dye reaches close to the bottom of the gel .
stain the gel with coomassie blue .
part 4 : concentration of the vrnp fractions choose the glycerol fractions containing mainly np , combine them , and distribute them into two beckman polycarbonate centrifuge tubes ( 11 mm x 34 mm ) .
fill each tube with diethyl pyrocarbonate ( depc ) - treated ultrapure water , and pipet up and down several times to mix .
centrifuge for 4.5 hours at 157,000 x g , 4degreesc , in a beckman tla - 120.2 rotor .
remove the supernatant , and resuspend the pellet in 50 microl of depc - treated water .
if desired , the a280 of the concentrated vrnps can be measured .
as np is the major component present in the pooled fractions , an estimate of the molarity of np can be calculated using its extinction coefficient of 55,350 m - 1 cm - 1 ( as determined via protparam3 ) .
aliquot the purified vrnps , and store them frozen at - 80 degreesc for later use .
part 5 : negative staining of vrnps dilute 1 microl of purified vrnp into 9 microl of freshly - made and filtered - twice mnt buffer ( 20 mm mes , 150 mm nacl , 30 mm tris , ph 7.5 ) .
other buffers are also ok to dilute the vrnps and to wash the specimen grid ( step 5.5 ) , but do not use pbs if uranyl acetate is used for negative staining .
glow - discharge a specimen ( copper tem ) grid previously coated with a parlodion and carbon film for 30 seconds .
hold the freshly glow - discharged specimen grid with tweezers , and apply a 5 - microl drop of diluted vrnp onto the specimen grid .
leave the drop of specimen on the grid for 8 minutes .
while waiting , place a small strip of parafilm on the bench , and dispense 2 drops containing 10 microl each of mnt buffer ( to wash the grid ) , and a 80 - microl drop of the freshly made staining solution ( 1 % ammonium molybdate or 1 % uranyl acetate ) onto the parafilm .
after the 8 - minutes of adsorption , wick off part of the sample solution from the specimen grid with a piece of filter paper ( cut into triangles ) .
do not let the specimen grid to dry .
wash specimen grid in 2 drops containing 10 microl each of mnt buffer for a total time of 1 minute .
this is done by carefully lowering the specimen grid on the drop , and then wicking off part of the sample solution from the specimen grid with a piece of filter paper ( without letting the specimen grid dry ) .
immediately after wicking off the last drop of buffer from specimen grid , completely submerge the specimen grid within the stain droplet and wait 1 minute .
completely wick off the stain solution from the specimen grid with a piece of filter paper .
allow the specimen grid to air - dry for several minutes before observation under a transmission electron microscope .
part 6 : representative results : figure 1 as influenza a np (~ 56 kda ) is the major protein found in viral ribonucleoprotein complexes , the np band generally is the strongest band in the fractions containing the vrnps ( figure 1 ) .
in addition to np , each influenza vrnp also contains a copy of a trimeric rna polymerase ( molecular weights of 82 , 86 and 86.5 kda ) complex .
these may or may not be visible by coomassie blue staining because their abundance is low compared to that of np. the polymerases , however , can be detected if , instead of a commassie blue stain , a silver stain of the gel is performed .
the influenza matrix protein m1 (~ 28 kda ) should be minimally present in the fractions where the np protein peak fractions are present .
figure 2 negatively - stained vrnps as visualized under a transmission electron microscopy should yield vrnps that resemble rod - shaped particles with variable length that are approximately 30 nm to 120 nm in length ( figure 2a ) .
the oligomeric np is organized as a chain of np molecules that is further folded into a double helical repeat structure , so loops on either ends of these rod - shaped particles can sometimes be seen ( figure 2b ) .
discussion the purification of vrnps is based on the procedure described by kemler et al .
( 1994 ). 1 we and others have also used this protocol to isolate vrnps to study their nuclear import.2,4,5 we recommend the use of rnase - free tips and tubes when manipulating vrnps because the viral genome is composed of rna , and therefore degrades easily in the presence of rna .
in addition , all buffers should be made in water that is rnase free .
the protocol described here was performed with an acidic extraction ( e.g. the ph of the disruption buffer and the glycerol gradient is 5.5 ) .
similarly , a basic extraction can be performed ( as described by kemler et al .
( 1994 ) 1 ) by substituting mes , ph 5.5 with tris , ph 7.8 .

background patients qualified for gastric bypass surgery have an enlarged and fatty liver .
an essential step in gastric bypass surgery is elevation of the left liver lobe to expose the gastroesophageal junction .
an enlarged and fatty liver complicates the surgical procedure and increases the risk for laceration of the liver .
the aim of our study was to evaluate methods to reduce liver volume in patients prior to gastric bypass surgery .
methods a systematic literature search of multiple databases , including pubmed , embase.com , and the cochrane library and a hand search of reference lists , was performed .
we used the search terms morbid obesity and liver , including their synonyms and controlled terms .
inclusion criteria were as follows : patients with morbid obesity who qualified for bariatric surgery , the use of a preoperative treatment to reduce liver volume , and the use of imaging techniques before and after treatment .
results in total , 281 patients in 11 different studies were included .
preoperative diets reduced liver size by an average of 14 % , alternative methods including nutritional supplements , reduced liver size between 20 and 43 % , and an intragastric balloon by 32 % .
conclusions this review showed that nutritional supplements and intragastric balloon are more effective than low calorie diets in reducing liver volume prior to gastric bypass surgery .
however , low calorie diet is the preferable method to reduce liver volume , considering the level of evidence and practical applicability .
there is a need for well - designed randomized studies with sufficient power in order to confirm the effectiveness of preoperative methods to reduce liver volume .
keywords bariatric surgery laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass preoperative care preoperative diets liver liver volume issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media new york 2016 introduction morbid obesity is a growing global problem with an increasing number of patients in need for bariatric surgery .
in the past decade , the prevalence of morbid obesity in the usa has increased by 70 % , from 2.1 % in 2000 to 3.7 % in 2010 [ 1 ] .
laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass ( lrygbp ) is the gold standard in europe and the usa and successfully reduces weight in patients with morbid obesity [ 2 ] .
patients qualified for lrygbp often have an enlarged and fatty liver .
the prevalence of steatosis and steatohepatitis in patients qualified for bariatric surgery varies between 52 and 90 % and between 33 and 89 % , respectively [ 3 - 9 ] .
an enlarged and fatty liver complicates lrygbp in two ways .
first , the enlarged left liver lobe complicates the approach to the gastroesophageal junction .
second , the soft fatty liver is vulnerable and thereby increasing the risk of bleeding upon surgical manipulation .
for these reasons , an enlarged and fatty liver is the most common reason for conversion from laparoscopic to open roux - en - y gastric bypass [ 10 ] .
the overall conversion rate in lrygbp is approximately 4 % , and an enlarged liver is responsible for approximately 50 % of the conversions [ 11 ] .
currently , a preoperative low calorie diet is recommended in patients qualified for lrygbp in order to reduce liver volume and facilitate surgery [ 12 - 22 ] .
the duration and content of the diet differ per country and per institution .
there are also pharmacological and endoscopic measures to reduce liver volume that could be an alternative for preoperative diets .
the objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of different preoperative methods to reduce liver volume in patients qualified for bariatric surgery .
methods data sources we conducted a systematic literature search to identify studies relevant to the review .
initially broad search terms were used , including [ morbid obesity ] , [ preoperative care ] , [ liver volume ] , and [ bariatric surgery ] , including their synonyms and controlled terms .
the search was performed in multiple databases , including pubmed , embase.com , and the cochrane library ( via wiley ) from inception to november 6 , 2013 .
the search strategy for pubmed included the following search terms : " obesity , morbid " [ mesh ] or " morbid obesity " [ tiab ] or " morbidly obese " [ tiab ] or " excess body weight " [ tiab ] and " liver " [ mesh ] or " liver " [ tiab ] .
the search strategy for embase included the following search terms : " morbid obesity "/ exp or " morbid obesity " : ti,ab or " morbidly obese " : ti,ab or " excess body weight " : ti,ab and " liver "/ exp or liver : ti,ab. the search strategy for the cochrane library included the search terms " morbid obesity " and " liver. " the electronic search was supplemented by a hand search of reference lists of the available relevant literature .
the search was performed by one of the authors ( ej ) .
data selection studies focusing on preoperative methods to reduce liver volume in patients qualified for bariatric surgery were included .
the exact inclusion criteria were as follows : studies in patients undergoing bariatric surgery for treatment of morbid obesity , studies that investigated methods to reduce liver volume as pretreatment before bariatric surgery , and studies that used radiographic measurements of total liver volume or volume of left hepatic lobe .
statistical analysis a meta - regression analysis on the studies focusing on the effect of preoperative lcd 's was performed .
the separate effect of the amount of calories and the duration of the lcd on liver volume was analyzed , taking the number of patients in each study as a weighing factor .
statistical analyses were performed using spss ( statistical package for the social sciences , version 20 , 2009 , chicago , il , usa ) .
results study characteristics the initial search yielded a total of 1897 references .
two researchers ( jw and nb ) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance .
after removing duplicates of references that were selected from more than one database , 1310 references remained. from these , 1283 references were excluded because they were not relevant to the study. from the remaining 27 articles , full texts were screened for relevance .
finally , 11 studies were found eligible involving a total of 281 patients .
the process of data selection is summarized in fig. 1. fig. 1 flowchart of study inclusion data evaluation in total , 9 prospective observational studies , 1 retrospective observational study , and 1 retrospective case - matched - control study were included .
seven studies ( 60 % of all patients ) investigated the effect of a preoperative low calorie diet , 3 studies ( 29 % of all patients ) focused on preoperative pharmacological measures , and in 1 study ( 11 % of all patients ) , the effect of a preoperative intragastric balloon on liver volume was evaluated .
overall , 59 % of the patients were women , 27 % were men , and in 14 % , gender was not described .
the mean age of the studied patients varied from 34 to 48 years of age .
the nine cohort studies that were included showed considerable heterogeneity in terms of patient population , sample sizes , intervention methods , and assessment of outcome .
only two studies had a controlled design .
edholm et al .
[ 17 ] used a control group with the same gender and approximately the same sample size as the intervention group .
the method of selection of the control group was not reported .
aberle et al .
[ 12 ] used a retrospectively matched control group .
preoperative low calorie diet in total , seven studies [ 13 , 15 - 18 , 20 , 22 ] investigated the effect of a preoperative low calorie diet on liver volume .
the median duration of the preoperative diet was 6 weeks ( range 2 - 12 weeks ) .
the amount of calories ranged from a minimum of 456 kcal / day to a maximum of 1520 kcal / day .
body mass index ( bmi ) before preoperative diet ranged from 43 to 56 kg / m2 .
the median change in bmi after the low calorie diet was a reduction of 9.1 % ( range 4.2 - 12.5 %) .
the median change in liver volume was a reduction of 15 % ( range 5 - 20 %) .
the weighted average of change in liver volume was 14 % .
generally , longer duration of the diet showed more reduction in liver volume .
however , the maximum percentage of change in liver volume did not correspond with the maximal duration of the diet or the minimum amount of calories per day .
an overview of the effect of preoperative low calorie diets is shown in table 1 .

using the same weighing factor in a linear regression analysis , the resulting constant ( beta0 ) is - 3.294 , and the regression coefficients for the number of kilocalories and number of weeks ( beta1 and beta2 ) are - 0.002 and - 1.372 , respectively .
in other words , a low calorie diet of 500 kcal during 3 weeks for example would result in a reduction in liver volume of ( - 3.294 + ( 500 * - 0.002 ) + ( 3 * - 1.372 ) = - 8.41 % .
alternative preoperative measures three studies [ 12 , 14 , 21 ] investigated the effect of alternative preoperative measures on liver volume .
aberle et al .
[ 12 ] studied the effect of 15 mg sibutramine for 6 weeks in a retrospective case - matched - control study .
patients in the group treated with sibutramine lost an average of 4.8 kg and the matched control group gained an average of 7 kg in 6 weeks .
the greatest decrease was seen in the longitudinal measurements of the right hepatic lobe in the group treated with sibutramine ( mean decrease of 1.9 +/ - 2.2 cm ) .
brody et al .
[ 14 ] investigated the effect of nuvista ( r ) together with a low calorie diet ( 1200 - 1500 kcal / day ) for 4 weeks .
ianelli et al .
[ 21 ] investigated the effect of 1500 mg omega - 3 fatty acids a day for 4 weeks without any dietary restrictions .
an overview of preoperative alternative measures is shown in table 2 .

[ 19 ] investigated the effect of an intragastric balloon for 6 months prior to lrygbp in super obese ( bmi > 50 kg / m2 ) .
mean bmi decreased from 55.2 +/ - 6.9 to 47.4 +/ - 7.7 kg / m2 .
liver volume was measured by ct and decreased from 2938.5 +/ - 853.1 to 1918 +/ - 499.8 cm3 ( 31.8 %) .
approach of gastroesophageal junction three studies [ 13 , 15 , 22 ] investigated the effect of a preoperative low calorie diet and reported a relatively easy approach of the gastroesophageal junction during lrygbp .
colles et al .
[ 15 ] also reported that none of the surgical procedures were converted from laparoscopic to open .
lewis et al .
[ 22 ] also reported a soft liver that could easily be manipulated during surgery by using a very low calorie diet .
ianelli et al .
[ 21 ] reported no difficulties in the approach of the gastroesophageal junction in patients treated with omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids .
in addition , the liver could be easily retracted during surgery .
discussion this study included 7 studies that investigated the effect of low calorie diets on liver volume in 6 different countries , including israel , australia , new zealand , usa , mexico , and sweden .
the duration and the content of the diets varied widely between the studies .
all studies reported a reduction in liver volume varying from 5 to 20 % .
the lowest reduction in liver volume was associated with the shortest duration of the diet .
studies with a longer duration of the diet showed on average more reduction in liver volume by approximately 2.4 % per week .
this indicates that the duration of the diet correlates with the amount of reduction of liver volume .
however , the highest reduction in liver volume was not associated with the longest duration of the diet or the lowest amount of calories , suggesting that the content of the diet , i.e. the amount of protein , carbohydrates , and fat , also plays an important role in reducing liver volume .
meta - regression analysis showed that the effect of the amount of calories is marginal compared to the effect of the number of weeks of the lcd .
although the number of studies is considered not sufficient for a robust meta - regression analysis , it is remarkable that the amount of calories has no effect on liver volume .
these results suggest that any kind of diet will reduce liver volume and that the focus should lie on the duration of the diet and the adherence .
a downside of a low calorie diet is that it is relatively expensive and burdensome for the patient .
common side effects of dietary foods are nausea , vomiting , stomach discomfort , and constipation .
in addition , patients often have difficulties with adherence to the diet .
another serious drawback of this method is that low calorie diets for multiple weeks may induce a catabolic state , which could be a disadvantage in recovery after surgery .
all studies that investigated the effect of low calorie diets had several limitations .
first , all studies used a relative small number of patients , varying between 14 and 40 patients .
second , there was a lack of well - designed randomized studies .
six studies were prospective observational , 1 study was retrospective , only 1 study used a control group , and none of the studies was designed as a randomized controlled trial .
in addition , none of the studies performed a power calculation .
three studies investigated the effect of alternative measures to reduce liver volume .
aberle et al .
[ 12 ] investigated the effect of sibutramine on bmi and liver volume compared to a case - matched - control group in a retrospective study .
sibutramine is a centrally acting serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor developed for the treatment of obesity .
it increases the metabolism ; it induces an earlier feeling of satiety and is thereby a successful method to reduce weight .
[ 23 ] patients were advised to use sibutramine prior to surgery and retrospectively compared the group that had used sibutramine with a historic control group .
this design has such a high probability of selection bias , that it is hard to draw any conclusions .
brody et al .
[ 14 ] studied the effect of the nutritional supplement nuvista ( r ) combined with a low calorie diet .
nuvista ( r ) is a nutritional supplement that consists of a high protein content and a wide range of vitamins and minerals .
they reported the greatest decrease in liver volume ( 43 %) of all studies .
unfortunately , they did not use a control group ; so , the additional effect of nuvista ( r ) cannot be determined .
but , the combination of nuvista ( r ) and a low calorie diets seems to be the most effect way to reduce liver size .
ianelli et al .
[ 21 ] investigated the effect of omega - 3 fatty acids on liver volume and found a reduction of 20 % of the left hepatic lobe .
the results of this study are promising , because they proved that it could be an effective method to reduce liver volume without the need for dietary restrictions .
a limitation of this study is that they only reported the bmi at baseline and not after treatment with omega - 3 fatty acids .
therefore , it is uncertain whether the reduction in liver volume was caused by the use of omega - 3 fatty acids alone or that weight loss could also have played a role .
only one study [ 19 ] reported on the effect of an intragastric balloon in order to reduce liver volume in super obese patients prior to lrygbp .
downsides of this method are high risk of side effects and the invasive character of this method .
therefore , this method should only be reserved for super obese patients that require a considerable reduction of weight and liver volume in order to facilitate lrygbp .
three studies [ 13,15,22 ] that investigated the effect of a low calorie diet on liver volume reported that there were no problems with the approach of the gastroesophageal junction during surgery .
in addition , pretreatment with omega - 3 fatty acids also resulted in an easy approach of the gastroesophageal junction and in a soft liver that could easily be manipulated [ 21 ] .
since these two factors are the most important rationale behind preoperative treatment with a low calorie diet , it is remarkable that only four studies reported information on this matter .
six studies [ 12 , 14 - 17 , 21 ] reported information about postoperative outcome .
in general , there were no differences in the effect of preoperative methods on postoperative outcome .
however , this review included not enough studies to investigate the effect of preoperative methods to reduce liver volume on postoperative outcome .
in the most recent review on this topic by cassie et al .
[ 24 ] , the authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the positive effects of preoperative diets on postoperative outcome .
our study had several limitations .
first , only a small number of studies with a relative small number of patients were included .
second , it was difficult to make a proper comparison of the studies because of their differences in study design .
third , there were different radiographic methods used to evaluate liver volume .
in addition , some studies measured whole liver volume and some only the left hepatic lobe .
in our opinion , the best radiographic method to measure liver size and fat content is magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , because it gives an accurate estimation of liver size and fat content .
computed tomography ( ct ) gives an accurate estimation of liver size ; however , liver ct is not the best method to measure steatosis [ 25 ] .
at this moment , ultrasound ( us ) is most used to diagnose steatosis or steatohepatitis [ 26 ] .
however , us is not the best method to measure liver size , especially not in morbidly obese subjects .
in conclusion , this systematic review showed that pharmacological measures and an intragastric balloon are more effective than low calorie diets in reducing liver volume prior to gastric bypass surgery .
however , low calorie diet is the preferable method to reduce liver volume , considering the level of evidence and practical applicability .
on average , low calorie diets reduce liver size by 2.4 % per week ; therefore , we would recommend a low calorie diet of at least 4 weeks prior to surgery .
if patients do not tolerate a low calorie diet , alternatives such as nuvista ( r ) or omega - 3 fatty acids should be considered .
in the super obese , a gastric balloon is an effective method to prepare these patients for lrygbp .
there is a need for well - designed randomized studies with sufficient power in order to confirm the effectiveness of preoperative methods to reduce liver volume .
conflict of interest we have no conflict of interest to report .

advanced engineering and functional ceramics are sensitive to damage cracks , which delay the wide applications of these materials in various fields .
ceramic composites with enhanced fracture toughness may trigger a paradigm for design and application of the brittle components .
this paper reviews the toughening mechanisms for the nanolayered max phase ceramics .
the main toughening mechanisms for these ternary compounds were controlled by particle toughening , phase - transformation toughening and fiber - reinforced toughening , as well as texture toughening .
based on the various toughening mechanisms in max phase , models of sic particles and fibers toughening ti3sic2 are established to predict and explain the toughening mechanisms .
the modeling work provides insights and guidance to fabricate max phase - related composites with optimized microstructures in order to achieve the desired mechanical properties required for harsh application environments .

introduction conventional ceramic materials mainly include glasses , structural clay products , whitewares , refractories , abrasives , cement and the newly developed advanced ceramics .
ceramic materials offer many distinct advantages such as excellent corrosion , wear resistance , high hardness and stiffness , chemical inertness , high - temperature characteristics as well as low density , which make them attractive for applications such as industries [ 1,2,3,4 ] , medical [ 5 ] , fuel constituents [ 6,7 ] and daily life [ 8 ] , ranging in size scale from micro - electromechanical systems through large aerospace components .
however , ceramic materials are severely limited in various fields of human activities by their mechanical properties [ 9,10,11 ] .
the achilles heel of ceramic materials is the low reliability , which is given by the disposition of inherent brittleness to catastrophic fracture with very low energy absorption .
one of the macroscopic properties that characterizes this disposition of a ceramic is the fracture toughness ( kic ) which is the resistance of ceramics to incipient cracking or defect generation and the microstructural mechanisms that are the source of such resistance [ 1 ] .
the fracture toughness can be strongly influenced by microstructure or by the using of various reinforcements .
there are two fundamentally different approaches : flaw control and toughening [ 12 ] .
the toughening mechanisms have been well documented and can be conveniently considered to involve either intrinsic toughening mechanisms or extrinsic toughening mechanisms ( figure 1 ) [ 13 ] .
the intrinsic toughening is an inherent property of the material , which is induced essentially from plasticity and enhances a material 's inherent damage resistance .
thus , it is active irrespective of crack size and geometry .
the intrinsic toughening is the primary source of fracture resistance in ductile materials [ 13 ] .
in contrast , most structural ceramics are essentially impossible to be tough intrinsically due to the absence of mobile dislocation activity [ 13,14 ] and the extrinsic toughening is the primary source of toughening in ceramics which act primarily behind the tip to impede crack advance .
extrinsic toughening acts to lower the local stress and strain fields at the crack tip without the inherent fracture resistance of the material changed ; as it depends on the presence of a crack , it affects only the crack - growth toughness , specifically through the generation of a rising r - curve [ 13 ] .
so far , a number of extrinsic toughening methods have been developed : transformation toughening , dispersed ductile / brittle particle toughening ( microcracking toughening ) , fiber / lamella bridge toughening [ 15 ] , whisker toughening [ 16 ] , the frictional interlocking of grains during intergranular fracture in monolithic ceramics and complex structure toughening etc .
intergranular fracture is generally an essential requirement here for the operation of these mechanisms .
max phases are a group of new nanolayered ceramics with a general composition of mn + 1axn [ 17,18,19,20,21,22 ] where m is an early transition metal , a is iiia or iva element , and x = c or n ( n = 1 ~ 7 ) .
until now , more than 50 m2ax phases ( ti2alc , cr2alc , ti2snc etc. ) , 6 m3ax2 phases ( ti3sic2 , ti3alc2 etc. ) and 8 m4ax3 phases ( ti4aln3 , nb4alc3 , etc. ) have been discovered and investigated along with many possible solid solution permutations and combinations [ 18 ] .
in the unit cell of max phase , the m and x atoms form two common edges , m6x tetrahedron with the stronger covalent bond which is separated by a atomic planes , and the link between a atomic planes and m6x tetrahedron is weaker due to the m - a metallic bond .
due to such unique nanolaminated structure , the max phases are able to combine metal and ceramic materials demonstrating high thermal and electrical conductivities , excellent machinability and high - temperature oxidation resistance .
recently , max phases have attracted much attention due to their special qualities and potential applications in sensors , radiation hardened in nuclear energy and electrochemical energy storage systems [ 18,19,20,21 ] .
in this content , enhancement of the reliability of these nanolayered max phases with desired mechanical properties becomes critical .
the present work gives a critical review of toughening mechanisms for the nanolayered max phases .
based on the present toughening work for max phases , microstructure - based models were established for a better understanding of the toughening mechanisms of these ceramics with nanolayered structures .
finally , an outlook of future directions for the toughening of these nanolayered ceramics is also provided .
2. toughening in nanolayered max phases the fascinating max phase ceramics have gained increasing attention due to their fruitful potential applications in industry .
great efforts have been made to investigate the fracture toughness and its enhancement of max phases [ 23 ] .
the toughening mechanisms in max phases can be categorized into four basic types : particle toughening , phase - transformation toughening , fiber - reinforced toughening , and texture toughening .
2.1 .
particle toughening the particle toughening is a general concept that refers to impending crack growth by dispersion particles such as tic [ 24 ] , al2o3 [ 25 ] , zrc [ 26 ] , bn [ 27,28 ] and carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) [ 29 ] etc .
unfortunately , these brittle particle reinforcements can modestly enhance the toughness of max phases due to lack of plasticity of ceramic particles , and the most common activated toughening mechanisms are crack deflection and crack bridging .
zrc particles - reinforced ti3alc2 composites were obtained by in situ reactive hot - pressing at 1500 degreesc under a pressure of 30 mpa for 2 h in ar using ti , al , graphite and zrc powders as starting materials [ 26 ] , and the fracture toughness of 20 vol % zrc / ti3alc2 composite could reach up to 11.5 +/ - 1.0 mpa.m1 / 2 while the fracture toughness of monolithic ti3alc2 was 7.8 +/ - 0.4 mpa.m1 / 2 .
as shown in figure 2 , the fracture toughness improvement could be ascribed to energy consuming by zrc particles and residual stresses in the zrc / ti3alc2 composite derived from the cooling process in the composite preparation .
a ( tib2 + tic )/ ti3sic2 composite with higher fracture toughness was obtained by hot - pressing at 1500 degreesc under a pressure of 25 mpa for 2 h in ar atmosphere by applying tih2 , si , graphite and b4c powders as starting materials [ 24 ] .
the microstructures of the ( tib2 + tic )/ ti3sic2 composites ( 10 vol % tib2 ) characterized by high - resolution transmission electron microscope ( hrtem ) demonstrated clean and clear grain boundaries between the ti3sic2 matrix and reinforcements ( figure 3a,b ) .
the fracture toughness of the as - prepared composites was higher than the pure ti3sic2 ceramic and other ti3sic2 - matrix composites [ 30 ] .
the fracture toughness of the ( tib2 + tic )/ ti3sic2 composites increased from about 9 mpa.m1 / 2 for the composites with 5 vol % tib2 reinforcements to 9.55 mpa.m1 / 2 for the one with 10 vol % tib2 reinforcements .
however , further increasing tib2 volume content up to 20 vol % resulted in a reduction of the fracture toughness of the composites [ 24 ] .
the improvement of the fracture toughness of the composites was due to the very close interatomic distance of close - packed plane of atoms for tib2 ( 0.3028 nm ) and tic ( 0.3055 nm ) , resulting in a coherent interface with strong binding energy ( figure 3c ) , which would lead to transgranular fracture and increase fracture energy as well as the residual compressive stress caused by the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch , which could increase the crack propagation resistance [ 24 ] .
2.2 .
whisker - and fiber - reinforced toughening in the whisker - and fiber - reinforced ceramic composites , the reinforcements could provide a ceramic matrix with large strains before failure and maintain themselves intact .
however , limited work has been performed to investigate the toughening behaviors of fiber - or whisker - reinforced max phases due to the high reactivity between the fibers and max phase matrix .
most of the work focused on the fabrication of the whisker or fiber / max phase composites and the main fibers include sic fiber [ 31,32,33 ] , carbon fiber [ 34 ] and al2o3 fiber [ 35,36 ] .
the reactivity of ti2alc or ti3sic2 powders with uncoated sic fibers at the temperature up to 1550 degreesc were evaluated [ 31 ] .
the results indicated that the uncoated sic fibers could be used as reinforcement in ti3sic2 but not in ti2alc , attributing to the reactivity that no apparent reaction occurred between ti3sic2 and sic fibers , while ti2alc could react with sic fibers to form ti3 ( al1 - xsix ) c2 , tic and al1 + xti1 - x alloy .
to reduce the reaction between the sic fibers and al - contained max phase , a ti barrier layer was applied between the sic fibers and ti3alc2 which could effectively hinder the inward diffusion of al from the ti3alc2 matrix [ 32,33 ] .
in the sicf / ti3alc2 composites prepared at 1250 and 1300 degreesc , only minor phases of ti5 ( al,si ) 3 alloy and tic , as well as ti2alc were detected as interfaces .
compared to the monolithic ti3alc2 bulk , the load - displacement curves of as - prepared composites showed a noncatastrophic failure and a step - like fracture model was observed in the fracture surfaces using a field emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem , figure 4 ) which indicated an improvement of the toughness [ 32 ] .
furthermore , ti2alc matrix loaded with two type of al2o3 fibers ( 20 vol %) was obtained by spark plasma sintering ( named as ti2alc / 720f and ti2alc / 610f ) [ 36 ] .
the fracture experiments and the post - mortem analysis of the fracture surface by sem revealed that kinking along with intergranular cracking and delamination played an important role in deformation of ti2alc .
the dynamic fracture toughness ( 5.46 mpa.m1 / 2 ) was higher than the quasi - static value ( 4.03 mpa.m1 / 2 ) by approximately 35 % , and the fracture toughness of the composites reduced when increasing the temperature .
2.3 .
transformation toughening transformation toughening in max phases can be traced back to 2007 [ 37,38 ] .
a 20 wt % zro2 / ti3alc2 was obtained by uniaxial hot - pressing at 1450 degreesc under a pressure of 20 mpa for 2 h in vacuum and the measured fracture toughness of 20 wt % zro2 / ti3alc2 composite was 6.8 mpa.m1 / 2 , while the fracture toughness of monolithic ti3alc2 was 4.6 mpa.m1 / 2 [ 37 ] .
the sem observations of the fracture surface indicated that the fracture toughness improvement can be ascribed to the compressive stress in the matrix generated by the zro2 particles transformation process .
in the 3 mol % yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia ceramics ( 3y - tzp ) reinforced ti3sic2 composites prepared by spark plasma sintering ( sps ) at 1300 degreesc , the fracture toughness could reach 11.94 mpa.m1 / 2 with 30 vol % 3y - tzp additions [ 38 ] .
some amount of m - zro2 phase could be found on the fracture surface indicating that the phase transformation of t - zro2 - - > m - zro2 occurred during the fracture [ 38 ] .
on the other hand , transformation toughening is not an exclusive toughening mechanism in the zirconia toughened composites ( ztcs ) .
the second phase formed by phase transformation could toughen the matrix through multiple toughening mechanisms to a different degree , such as crack deflection and bridging [ 39 ] .
2.4 .
texture toughening texture is also an effective approach for toughening of max phases ceramics [ 40,41,42,43,44,45,46 ] .
so far , slip casting in a strong magnetic field coupled with spark plasma sintering was applied to produce textured max phases .
textured nanolayered nb4alc3 ceramic with a shell - like microstructure was fabricated by strong magnetic field alignment technology followed by spark plasma sintering [ 40 ] .
after sintering , the tailored microstructures were schematized and analyzed by sem and tem observations ( figure 5 ) .
figure 6 shows that the texture microstructure can activate the toughening mechanisms of crack deflection , through grain pull - out and bridging in nb4alc3 ceramic .
consequently , the fracture toughness of the textured nb4alc3 ceramic was extremely high and increased from 7.1 mpa.m1 / 2 for the as - grown ceramic to 17.9 +/ - 5.16 and 11.49 +/ - 1.38 mpa.m1 / 2 along the directions of parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis direction , respectively [ 40 ] .
similar work has been reported on other 211 and 312 max phases in a spark plasma facility and the fracture toughness of ti2alc increased from 6.0 mpa.m1 / 2 in the as - sintered ceramic to 7.9 mpa.m1 / 2 and 6.5 mpa.m1 / 2 parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction , respectively , in the deformed ceramic [ 42 ] .
3. toughening models for max phases the toughening mechanisms in ceramics can be understood and predicted by the modeling work which can contribute insights and theoretical instructions for material design , process development and optimization .
many approaches were applied and developed for ceramic toughening mechanism simulations such as finite element method ( fem ) , first principles calculation ( fpc ) [ 47,48 ] and the empirical electron theory ( eet ) of solids and molecules [ 49,50,51,52 ] .
for a comprehensive understanding of the toughening mechanisms in these nanolayered max phase ceramics , sic particle and fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 composites were selected as models and simulated using a primary 3d finite element model ( 3d - fem ) , which is schematically represented in figure 7 .
the main material parameters used in 3d - fem are listed in table 1 .
for the sic fiber toughening ti3sic2 max phase , the elliptical sic fibers with a length - diameter ratio of 20:1 was applied in 3d - fem .
in fracture mechanics , there are three types of basic fracture modes , as shown in figure 8 : mode i opening model , mode ii shearing mode and mode iii tearing mode , where ( x1 , x2 , x3 ) is the local cartesian coordinate system centered at the crack front with the x1 - axis perpendicular to the crack front , the x2 - axis perpendicular to the crack plane , and the x3 - axis along the crack front .
in those modes , the stress - intensity factor , k , is a parameter describing the field of the crack tip which only correlates to the loads and geometries .
in the present study , mode i , the opening mode , was selected for sic particle and fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 composites where the stress - intensity factor , ki , can be expressed by the following formula and be obtained from the extended finite element method ( efem ) by using an abaqus / cae 2016 software package .
( 1 ) ki = limr - - > 0sigma22 ( x1 = a + r,x2 = 0 ) 2pir in the formula , sigma22 is the biaxial stress in the vicinity of the crack tip , x1 and x2 are cartesian coordinates at x1 - axis and x2 - axis , respectively , a is the crack length and r is the radius for a 3d penny - shaped crack .
3.1 .
sic particle - reinforced ti3sic2 max phase figure 9a represents the finite element mesh for the composite of sic particle - reinforced ti3sic2 matrix , and figure 9b shows the boundary conditions applied on the top and bottom sides of the geometry respect to the x axis and y axis respectively .
the geometry displacement at the x axis direction is constrained to zero .
figure 10 illustrates the maximum principal stress distribution at the onset of crack propagation predicted by the fracture model for the composite with 6.8 vol % sic reinforcement .
the corresponding value of the stress - intensity factor , ki , obtained from this simulation is 6.26 mpa.m1 / 2 .
as shown in figure 10 , the sic particles can prevent crack from propagating and lead to stress concentration at the crack tip and the stress - intensity factor ki can be considered as a critical factor for fracture toughness ( ki = kic = 6.26 mpa.m1 / 2 ) , which demonstrates a sufficient reinforcement to enhance the toughness of monolithic ti3sic2 max phase [ 30 ] .
3.2 .
sic fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 max phase similar to sic particle - reinforced ti3sic2 max phase , figure 11 shows the finite element mesh and boundary constraint for the sic fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 composite .
in the finite element mesh ( figure 11a ) , the seed point distribution on the inner ellipse sic fiber edge are 16 points and the seed distribution on the cubic edge of ti3sic2 matrix are 6 points at its high dimension , 4 points at its long dimension and 1 point at its wide dimension .
for the boundary constraint , as shown in figure 11b , the displacement of the top of ti3sic2 matrix constraint to - 4 x 105 mm in the u1 direction , - 2 x 105 mm in the u2 direction and 0 mm in the u3 direction , the displacement of the bottom of ti3sic2 matrix constraint to 4 x 105 mm in the u1 direction , - 2 x 105 mm in the u1 direction and 0 mm in the u3 direction .
consequently , figure 12 shows the predicted maximum principal stress distribution at the onset of crack propagation for the proposed sic fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 composites with 5 vol % reinforcements .
the predicted maximum principal stress is 176.2 mpa .
the higher the maximum principal stress , the stronger the fiber can prevent crack from initiating .
the stress - intensity factor ki computed from 3d - fem method is 12.65 mp.m1 / 2 indicating a significant improvement in the toughness of the ti3sic2 max phases .
the successful prediction of toughness of the sic particle and fiber - reinforced ti3sic2 using 3d - fem can provide insight and valuable guidance to the experimental work to fabricate max phase - based composites with optimized microstructures to obtain the desired mechanical properties .
however , more modeling prediction should be done to further optimize the microstructures of the composites to achieve the required properties for their applications .
4. conclusions this paper reviews the toughening mechanisms for a family of nanolayered max phases and the related composites .
based on the experimental results , sic particle and fiber toughening max phase models were established for a better understanding of the toughening mechanisms and prediction of the improvement of the toughness , which may contribute with insights and theoretical instructions for material design , process development , and optimization .
meanwhile , it also opens many perspectives in toughening those nanolayered ceramics : ( 1 ) to apply these nanolayered max phases as higher performance and reliable structural components , a further tailoring of the microstructure should be done to enhance both strength and toughness. through additional microstructure modification e.g. , by grain size control , it is probable that the flexural strength or fracture toughness can be further enhanced .
( 2 ) for the fiber toughening max phases , more work should be done to optimize the interface between max phase and fibers , e.g. , by selecting different fibers which could be phase equilibrium with max phase during the high - temperature processing or by new processing methods that can consolidate the composites with fast densification technology to reduce or avoid the reaction between the fibers and max phase matrix .
( 3 ) the modeling work presented here is just a first attempt to predict the improved toughness of the max phase - based composites by using 3d - fem .
however , more modeling parameters such as selection of proper reinforcements , the volume fraction of reinforcement as well as size and dimensions of the reinforcements etc .
need to be further investigated and refined , which may provide valuable theoretical guidelines for material design , process development , and optimization .
success in addressing these points may expand max phases and related composites to numerous structural and high - temperature applications .

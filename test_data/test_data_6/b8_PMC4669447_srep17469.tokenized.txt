in this paper , we present a first study on the transition matrix of a family of weight driven networks , whose degree , strength , and edge weight obey power - law distributions , as observed in diverse real networks .
we analytically obtain all the eigenvalues , as well as their multiplicities .
we then apply the obtained eigenvalues to derive a closed - form expression for the random target access time for biased random walks occurring on the studied weighted networks .
moreover , using the connection between the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of a network and its weighted spanning trees , we validate the obtained eigenvalues and their multiplicities .
we show that the power - law weight distribution has a strong effect on the behavior of random walks .
as a standard tool , random walks on a network describes various dynamical processes in the network , such as search12 spreading3 , diffusion4 , to name a few .
due to its role as a fundamental mechanism characterizing diverse other processes , random walks on complex networks have attracted considerable attention in the past years5678910111213141516171819 .
the vast literature provided novel methods for computing mean first - passage time , steady - state distribution , as well as many other properties of random walks .
since random walks are completely described by the transition matrix20 , most interesting quantities and properties related to random walks are determined by the spectra ( eigenvalues and eigenvectors ) of the transition matrix .
first of all , the mean first - passage time from one node to another can be represented through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix20 .
furthermore , the sum of reciprocals of one minus every eigenvalue , excluding the eigenvalue 1 itself , determines the random target access time21 .
finally , the smallest eigenvalue , together with the second largest eigenvalue , provides an upper bound and a lower bound for the mixing time22 .
in addition to the properties of random walks , the spectra of the transition matrix for a network are also pertaining to structural aspects of the network , for example , spanning trees2324 and effective resistance25 , which can also be determined by the spectra of laplacian matrix26 .
thus , transition matrix is closely related to laplacian matrix , with the latter being widely used in quantum walks2728 and quantum algorithms29 .
in view of the significance , the study of spectra for transition matrix has become a central issue30 .
in the past decade , there has been important progress in determining the eigenvalues for transition matrix of different networks or characterizing their properties .
examples include random graphs3132 , sierpinski gasket3334 , tower of hanoi graph35 , cayley tree and extend t - fractal36 , fractal3738 and non - fractal3940 scale - free networks .
these works provided a deeper understanding on spectral characteristics of the transition matrix of different networks , as well as the effects of network topology on the spectral density and random - walk process .
extensive empirical research has unveiled that real networks are characterized by the heterogeneity4142 , not only in the aspect of degree distribution43 but also in the context of weight distribution444546 .
previous works about spectra of the transition matrix were limited to binary networks , and the influence of inhomogeneous weight distribution on the spectral properties of transition matrix still remains unknown .
in this paper , we study analytically the eigenvalues for transition matrix of a class of weighted networks47 , which exhibit some prominent properties that are observed in real - world systems444546 , such as the power - law distribution of node degree , strength , and edge weight .
based on the particular construction of the networks , we find all the eigenvalues and their corresponding multiplicities .
using the obtained eigenvalues , we deduce an explicit expression for the random target access time , as well as its leading scaling , which is different from those previously obtained for binary heterogeneous networks , implying that the weight has an important impact on the random - walk behavior .
moreover , we determine the weighted counting of spanning trees in the studied networks using the eigenvalues , which is consistent with that derived by another technique , corroborating the validity of our computation for the eigenvalues .
results construction and properties of weight driven scale - free weighted networks the network family , parameterized by two positive integer m and delta , is constructed in an iterative manner47 .
let denote the network class after g ( g >= 0 ) iterations .
then , the network family is built as follows .
for g = 0 , consists of an edge ( link ) with unit weight connecting two nodes ( vertices ) .
for g >= 1 , is obtained from by performing the following operations .
for each edge with weight w in , we add mw new nodes for either end of the edge and connect each of the mw new nodes to the end by new edges of unit weight ; then we increase weight w of the edge by mdeltaw .
figure 1 illustrates the network generation process for a special case of m = 2 and delta = 1 .
let ng , eg , qg denote , respectively , the total number of nodes , the total number of edges , and the total weight of all edges in . and let nv ( g ) and ne ( g ) denote , respectively , the number of nodes and the number of edges that are created at iteration g. then , ne ( g ) = nv ( g ) holds for all g >= 1. by construction , for g >= 0 , we have which under the initial condition q0 = 1 yields furthermore , it is easy to derive that for all g >= 1 , thus , and for an edge e connecting two nodes i and j in , which is born at iteration tau , we use we ( g ) or wij ( g ) to denote its weight .
then , we ( g ) = wij ( g ) = ( deltam + 1 ) g - tau .
let si ( g ) ( resp. di ( g )) be the strength ( resp. degree ) of node i in , which is added to the network at generation gi. it is easy to obtain and where omegai is the set of neighbors of i in . the resultant networks display prominent properties as observed in real systems444546 , with their degree , strength , and edge weight following power law distribution47 .
eigenvalues and multiplicities of transition matrix after introducing the construction and properties of the weighted scale - free networks , in this section we study eigenvalues and their multiplicities of the transition matrix for the networks .
recursive relation of eigenvalues let wg be the generalized adjacency matrix ( weight matrix ) of . the entries wg ( i , j ) of wg are defined as follows : if nodes i and j are adjacent in , or otherwise .
then , the transition matrix for biased random walks4849 in , denoted by tg , is defined as , where sg is the diagonal strength matrix of with its ith diagonal entry being the strength si ( g ) of node i. thus , the ( i , j ) th element of tg is , which represents the local transition probability for a walker going from node i to node j. we now consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of tg. since tg is asymmetric , we introduce the following real and symmetric matrix pg defined as by definition , the ( i , j ) th entry of pg is . since pg is similar to tg , they have the same set of eigenvalues .
furthermore , if phi is an eigenvector of matrix pg associated with eigenvalue lambda , then is an eigenvector of tg corresponding to eigenvalue lambda .
therefore , we reduce the problem of finding eigenvalues for an asymmetric matrix tg to the issue of determining eigenvalues for a symmetric matrix pg. suppose that lambda is an eigenvalue of pg , and is its corresponding eigenvector , where phij is the component corresponding to node j in . let be a vector of dimension ng - 1 that is obtained from phi by restricting its components to the old nodes , namely , nodes generated before or at iteration g - 1 .
as will be shown below , is an eigenvector of pg - 1 , associated with eigenvalue , from which lambda is generated. by definition , we have let o be an old node in . according to eq .
( 9 ) , where theta denotes the set of the do ( g ) neighbors of node o. let be the set of the do ( g - 1 ) old neighbors of node o , while the other new neighbors form set . for each new neighboring node , one has , which implies . thereby , the component phii satisfies implying in the case lambda != 0 , inserting eq .
( 12 ) into eq .
( 10 ) and considering the two relations and , we obtain an equation only involving old nodes , which were already existing at iteration g - 1 .
for lambda != 0 , eq .
( 13 ) is true for an arbitrary node present at generation g - 1 .
thus , we can compare eq .
( 13 ) with the following corresponding equation for the old node o at iteration g - 1 : this indicates that is an eigenvector of pg - 1 , corresponding to eigenvalue . it is not difficult to see that the entry pg - 1 ( o , i ) of generation g - 1 is times its counterpart pg ( o , i ) of generation g. then , eqs .
( 13 ) and ( 14 ) coincide , provided that which relates lambda to . solving the quadratic equation in the variable lambda given by eq .
( 15 ) yields which shows that each eigenvalue of pg - 1 gives rise to two eigenvalues of pg , lambda + and lambda - . let phi + and phi - denote the eigenvectors of lambda + and lambda - , respectively .
then , both phi + and phi - can be obtained from in the following way .
for the nodes already present at iteration g - 1 , the components of phi + and phi - are equivalent to the corresponding components of ; while for the nodes generated at iteration g , their components can be determined by replacing lambda in eq .
( 12 ) with lambda + or lambda - . therefore , lambda + ( or lambda - ) has the same number of linearly independent eigenvectors as that of . moreover , the eigenvectors of lambda + ( or lambda - ) are linearly independent , because pg is real and symmetric .
multiplicities of eigenvalues equation ( 16 ) indicates that from the eigenvalues of generation g - 1 , one can obtain the eigenvalues of the next generation g , with the exception of those zero eigenvalues .
thus , if there exists an eigenvalue lambda that cannot be derived from eq .
( 16 ) , it must be zero eigenvalue .
let represent the degeneracy of eigenvalue lambda for matrix pg. because pg - 1 is a real and symmetrical matrix , each eigenvalue of pg - 1 has linearly independent eigenvectors .
it is the same with either of its child eigenvalues , lambda + or lambda - . next we determine the multiplicity of each eigenvalue for matrix pg. for small networks , the eigenvalues and their multiplicities can be calculated directly .
the eigenvalues of p0 are 1 and - 1 .
for p1 , its eigenvalues are 1 , - 1 , 0 , , and , where two pairs of eigenvalues ( 1 and , - 1 and ) are generated , respectively , by eigenvalues 1 and - 1 of p0 .
moreover , the offspring eigenvalue of 1 and - 1 has a single degeneracy .
for g >= 2 , the eigenvalues of matrix pg display the following remarkable nature .
every eigenvalue appearing at current generation gi always exists at the next generation gi + 1 , and all new eigenvalues of are those produced via eq .
( 16 ) by substituting with those eigenvalues that were newly borne at generation gi ; moreover every new eigenvalue inherits the multiplicity of its parent .
hence , for g >= 2 , all eigenvalues ( excluding zero eigenvalue ) of pg are generated from 1 , - 1 , and 0 , with all the offspring eigenvalues of 1 and - 1 being nondegenerate .
therefore , all that is left is to determine the multiplicity of 0 , as well as the multiplicities of its descendants .
let r ( m ) denote the rank of matrix m. then , the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalues for pg is we now evaluate r ( pg ) .
for the set of all nodes in , let alpha denote the subset of nodes in , and beta the subset of nodes newly produced at generation g. then , pg can be written in a block form where the fact that pbeta,beta is the ( ng - ng - 1 ) x ( ng - ng - 1 ) zero matrix is used .
notice that r ( palpha,beta ) = r ( pbeta,alpha ) .
we can prove that ( see methods ) pbeta,alpha is a full column rank matrix .
then , and . according to eq .
( 17 ) , the multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 for matrix pg is : for g = 0 ; and for g >= 1 .
because each eigenvalue in pg keeps the degeneracy of its parent , the number of each of the first - generation descendants of zero eigenvalue is , the number of each of the second - generation descendants of zero eigenvalue is , and so on. thus , the total number of zero eigenvalue and its descendants in pg ( g >= 1 ) is for eigenvalue 1 ( or - 1 ) , the total number of its descendants in pg ( g >= 0 ) , including 1 ( or - 1 ) itself , is adding up the number of the above - obtained eigenvalues yields which implies that we have found all the eigenvalues of matrix pg and thus the transition matrix tg. since the distribution of eigenvalues conveys much important information , in fig. 2 we display as a histogram the distribution of eigenvalues for a specific network for the case m = 2 and delta = 1 .
because eigenvalues 1 , - 1 , and their offspring are nondegenerate , we only provide the density of eigenvalue 0 and its descendants .
figure 2 indicates that the eigenvalue distribution is heterogeneous .
application of eigenvalues in this section , we apply the obtained eigenvalues and their multiplicities to determine the random target access time for biased random walks and the weighted counting of spanning trees in the weighed scale - free networks . note that since has a treelike structure , the weighted counting of spanning trees is just be the product of weights of all edges in . thus , our aim for evaluating this quantity is to verify that our computation for eigenvalues and their multiplicities is correct .
random target access time transition matrix tg describes the biased discrete - time random walks in , and thus various interesting quantities related to random walks are reflected in eigenvalues of the transition matrix .
for example , the sum of reciprocals of 1 minus each eigenvalue ( excluding eigenvalue 1 itself ) of transition matrix tg determines the random target access time , also called eigentime identity , in 21 .
let hij ( g ) denote the mean first - passage time from node i to node j in , defined as the expected time for a walker starting from node i to visit node j for the first time .
let represent the steady state distribution for random walks on 4849 , where satisfying and . the random target access time , denoted by , for random walks on , is defined as the expected time needed by a walker from a node i to another target node j , chosen randomly from all nodes according to the steady state distribution , that is , which does not depend on the starting node20 and can be recast as since can be looked upon as the average trapping time of a special trapping problem11 , it encodes much useful information about trapping in . we introduce a matrix lg = ig - pg , where ig denotes the ng x ng identity matrix .
actually , lg is the normalized laplacian matrix232531 of . let lambdai ( g ) ( 1 <= i <= ng ) be the ng eigenvalues of pg. by definition , for any i , sigmai ( g ) = 1 - lambdai ( g ) is an eigenvalue of lg. it can be proved48 that can be represented in terms of the nonzero eigenvalues of lg , given by where is assumed , with lambda1 ( g ) = 1 being the largest non - degenerated eigenvalue of pg. in methods , we derive that obeys the following recursive relation : which , with the initial condition , is solved to obtain can be further represented in terms of of network size ng as thus , for large networks ( i.e. , ) , , growing linearly with the network size .
this is in sharp contrast to that obtained for unweighted scale - free treelike networks39 and cayley tree36 ( where ) , as well as fractal trees ( where with eta > 1 ) 3736 .
thus , the heterogenous distribution of edge weight has a substantial influence on the behavior of random walks in weighted networks .
weighted counting of spanning trees for a weighted network , denote by the set of its spanning trees .
for a tree , its weight is defined to be the product of weights of all edges e in , that is , , where we is the weight of edge e. let denote the weighted counting of spanning trees of , which is defined by . since is a tree , it has only one spanning tree , which is in fact itself .
then , the weighted counting of spanning trees in is , where the product is running over the weight we ( g ) of all edges . according to previous results24 , we have for the sum term in the denominator of eq .
( 28 ) , we have for the two product terms and in the numerator of eq .
( 28 ) , we use deltag and lambdag to represent them , respectively .
according to the above - obtained results , the two quantities deltag and lambdag obey the following two recursive relations : and multiplying eq .
( 30 ) by eq .
( 31 ) results in applying delta0 = 1 and lambda0 = 2 , eqs .
( 32 ) is solved to give inserting the results in eqs .
( 29 ) and ( 33 ) into eq .
( 28 ) yields on the other hand , since has a treelike structure , equals the product of weight of all edges in . thus , can be directly obtained by evaluating this product. by construction , obeys the recursive relation . considering , we have , which is consistent with eq .
( 34 ) , indicating the validity of our computation on the eigenvalues and their multiplicities for the transition matrix tg of . discussion in conclusion , we have considered the spectra of transition matrix for a class of weight - driven networks , whose degree , strength , and edge weight follow power - law distribution , which is observed in various real - world systems .
we have determined all the eigenvalues and their multiplicities of the transition matrix for the networks .
moreover , we have used the obtained eigenvalues to derive a closed - form expression about the random target access time for biased random walks taking place on the networks .
finally , we confirmed our results for the eigenvalues and their multiplicities via enumerating the weighted spanning trees , based on the connection between the two quantities .
we note that although the considered networks look self - similar , they are not topologically fractal .
since many real - life networks are fractal505152 , in future it deserves to study the spectra of transition matrix for weighted fractal networks .
furthermore , various structural and dynamical properties of a network are also relevant to the spectra of other matrices30 , such as adjacency matrix and non - backtracking matrix .
future work should include determining the spectra for adjacency matrix31 and non - backtracking matrix5354 of weighted scale - free networks .
methods proof for the statement that p beta,alpha is a full column rank matrix let v be an arbitrary vector of order ng - ng - 1 : where mi is the ith column vector of pbeta,alpha so that . let . assume that v = 0 .
then , we can prove that ki = 0 holds for arbitrary ki. by construction , for any old node , it has a new leaf neighboring node . then , in the expression , only , while all mx,l = 0 for x != i. from vl = 0 , one obtains ki = 0 .
hence , pbeta,alpha is a full column rank matrix .
derivation for the recursive relation between and let be the set of the ng - 1 nonzero eigenvalues of matrix lg. for g >= 1 , omegag includes 1 , 2 , , and other eigenvalues generated by them .
thus , omegag can be classified into three nonoverlapping subsets , and , satisfying , where consists of all the eigenvalues 1 , contains only the unique eigenvalue , and includes those eigenvalues generated by 1 , 2 , or . for and , we have and . while for , it can be evaluated in the following way. from eq .
( 15 ) , we can derive the following relation dominating the eigenvalues of lg and lg - 1 : which shows that every eigenvalue in omegag - 1 generates two eigenvalues , and , belonging to . using vieta 's formulas , we obtain and . then which implies that combining the above - obtained results leads to the following recursive relation between and : additional information how to cite this article : zhang , z. et al. spectra of weighted scale - free networks. sci. rep .

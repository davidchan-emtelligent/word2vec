in vietnam , m. mekongensis is called as " xoai thanh ca " , and this plant is cultivated for its edible fruit and has been used in traditional vietnamese medicine for treating anti - aging , diabetes , vermifuge , dysentery [ 1 , 2 ] .
a research for biologically active compounds with reduction of the rate of glucose absorption , a screening has been initiated to evaluate natural product extracts for the inhibition of enzyme alpha - glucosidase .
it is effective in controlling postprandial hyperglycaemia and prevents complications associated with type - ii diabetes , such as microvascular ( i.e. , retinal , renal , and possibly neuropathic ) , macrovascular ( i.e. , coronary and peripheral vascular ) , and neuropathic ( i.e. , autonomic and peripheral ) complications [ 3 , 4 ] .
previously , we reported that the methanolic extracts of embelia ribes , oroxylum indicum , and artocarpus altilis exhibited significant inhibitory activity on alpha - glucosidase [ 5 - 8 ] .
in a part of our continued research on the screening of medicinal plants of different origins , we also found that the n - hexane extract of the bark of m. mekongensis showed strong alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity with ic50 value of 1.71 microg / ml. thus , we carried out the bioactivity - guided fractionation of n - hexane extract of this plant and isolated two new steroids , mekongsterols a ( 1 ) and b ( 2 ) , together with seven known compounds ( 3 - 9 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
in this paper , we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of these compounds by spectroscopic methods as well as their alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity. fig. 1 structures of the isolated compounds from the bark of m. mekongensis result and discussion chemistry the dried powdered bark of m. mekongensis was extracted with n - hexane in soxhlet extractor to yield n - hexane fraction .
further separation and purification of this fraction led to the isolation of two new steroids , mekongsterols a ( 1 ) and b ( 2 ) , together with seven known compounds ( 3 - 9 ) .
the known compounds were identified by the analysis of their spectroscopy data and comparing with the literature data to be as beta - sitosterol ( 3 ) [ 9 ] , stigmastane - 3,6 - dione ( 4 ) [ 10 ] , beta - sitosteryl - 3 - o - beta - d - glucopyranosyl - 6 ' - o - palmitate ( 5 ) [ 11 ] , mangiferonic acid ( 6 ) [ 12 ] , mangiferolic acid ( 7 ) [ 12 ] , ambonic acid ( 8 ) [ 13 ] , and ambolic acid ( 9 ) [ 12 ] ( fig. 1 ) .
mekongsterol a ( 1 ) was obtained as a white crystal and showed the quasimolecular ion at m / z 733.6223 [ m + k ]+ , corresponding to the molecular formula c48h86o2k in hr - esi - ms. the ir spectrum of 1 showed absorption of ester carbonyl ( 1720 cm - 1 ) , double bond ( 1610 cm - 1 ) , and methyl , methylene , and methine ( 2950 and 2870 cm - 1 ) groups .
the 1h nmr spectrum of 1 ( table 1 ) displayed signals due to two methyl singlets ( deltah 0.68 , 1.02 , each s ) , three methyl doublets ( deltah 0.81 , d , j = 6.8 hz ; deltah 0.84 , d , j = 6.8 hz ; deltah 0.92 , d , j = 6.5 hz ) , a methyl triplet ( deltah 0.82 , t , j = 7.5 hz ) , an oxymethine ( deltah 4.62 , m ) , and trisubstituted olefinic bond ( deltah 5.38 , d , j = 4.4 hz ) , together with many aliphatic methylene and aliphatic methine groups ( deltah 0.95 - 2.30 ) .
the 13c nmr ( table 1 ) and dept spectra of 1 exhibited signals for six methyls ( deltac 12.0 , 12.1 , 18.9 , 19.2 , 19.5 , 19.9 ) , an oxymethine ( deltac 73.8 ) , and two olefinic carbons ( deltac 122.7 and 139.9 ) .
these data closely resembled those of beta - sitosterol ( 3 ) [ 9 ] , a common steroid found in plants , but they were characterized by the presence of additional signals due to a saturated fatty ester chain having 19c , which showed ester carbonyl ( deltac 173.5 ) , many methylenes ( deltah 1.20 - 2.27 ; deltac 22.8 - 34.9 ) , and one methyl triplet ( deltah 0.88 , t , j = 6.9 hz ) .
the location of saturated fatty ester chain was determined to be at c - 3 on the basis of the low - field shift of h - 3 ( deltah 4.62 ) compared to that of 3 ( deltah 3.51 ) , which was confirmed by the hmbc correlation from h - 3 to c - 1 ' ( fig. 2 ) .
the orientation of saturated fatty ester group at c - 3 was determined beta - equatorial from the noesy correlations h - 3 / h - 2alpha and h - 3 / h - 4alpha , and large j value ( 7.7 hz ) between h - 3 and h - 4beta ( fig. 3 ) .
the relative stereochemistry of 1 was assigned on the basis of noesy correlations and coupling constant data .
the noesy correlations h - 3 / h - 4alpha , h - 3 / h - 2alpha , h - 14 / h - 17 , h - 2beta / h3 - 19 , h - 4beta / h - 19 , h - 19 / h - 8 , h - 8 / h3 - 18 , and h3 - 18 / h - 20 , together with the large coupling constant ( j = 11.9 ) between h - 8 and h - 14 suggested that rings c and d to be trans - fused. from this spectroscopic evidence , the structure of 1 was concluded as 3beta - nonadecanoylsitosterol ( mekongsterol a ) .

the 1h nmr spectrum of 2 ( table 1 ) displayed signals due to two methyl singlets ( deltah 0.68 , 1.02 , each s ) , three methyl doublets ( deltah 0.81 , d , j = 6.8 hz ; deltah 0.84 , d , j = 6.8 hz ; deltah 0.92 , d , j = 6.5 hz ) , a methyl triplet ( deltah 0.84 , t , j = 7.5 hz ) , an oxymethine ( deltah 4.62 , m ) , and trisubstituted olefinic bond ( deltah 5.38 , d , j = 4.5 hz ) , together with many aliphatic methylene and aliphatic methine groups ( deltah 0.95 - 2.30 ) .
the 13c nmr ( table 1 ) and dept spectra of 2 exhibited 38 carbons including six methyls ( deltac 12.0 , 12.1 , 18.9 , 19.2 , 19.5 , 19.9 ) , an oxymethine ( deltac 73.8 ) , two olefinic carbons ( deltac 122.7 and 139.9 ) , an ester carbonyl carbon ( deltac 173.4 ) , and an acid carbonyl carbon ( deltac 178.5 ) .
these 1h and 13c data were similar to those of beta - sitosterol ( 3 ) [ 9 ] , the steroid isolated from the same extract , except for the presence of additional signals due to monoester derivative of nonadioic acid .
this was confirmed by the cosy and hsqc spectra , and from them , the partial structure c ( 2 ') h2 - c ( 3 ') h2 - c ( 4 ') h2 - c ( 5 ') h2 - c ( 6 ') h2 - c ( 7 ') h2 - c ( 8 ') h2 were deduced .
furthermore , the hmbc correlations from two methylene groups h2 - 2 ' and h2 - 3 ' to the ester carbonyl carbon c - 1 ' , while two methylene groups h2 - 7 ' and h2 - 8 ' gave significant correlations to the acid carbonyl carbon c - 9 ' suggesting the monoester azelaic acid .
the location of this moiety was determined to be at c - 3 based on hmbc correlations from h - 3 to c - 1 ' ( fig. 2 ) .
the configuration of monoester nonadioic acid moiety at c - 3 to be beta - equatorial orientation from the noesy correlations h - 3 / h - 2alpha and h - 3 / h - 4alpha , and large j value ( 7.6 hz ) between h - 3 and h - 4beta ( fig. 3 ) .
the relative stereochemistry of 2 was confirmed to be the same as 1 based on the results of difference noe experiments .
thus , the structure of 2 was concluded as 3beta - ( 8 - carboxyoctanoyl ) sitosterol ( mekongsterol b ) .

5 4.2 acarbosea 138.4 apositive control the isolated compounds were tested for their alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity ( table 3 ) .
the assay was carried out at various concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 microm .
compounds 1 , 2 , 5 - 9 possessed significant alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity in a concentration - dependent manner , and showed more potent inhibitory activity , with ic50 values ranging from 1.2 to 112.0 mum , than that of a positive control acarbose ( ic50 , 214.5 mum ) , which is currently used clinically in combination with either diet or anti - diabetic agents to control blood glucose level of patients [ 14 ] .
among isolated compounds , the sterol compounds ( 1 - 5 ) with saturated fatty ester chain or sugar group at c - 3 ( 1 , 2 , and 5 ) showed potent alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity , while the compounds with hydroxyl or ketone grop at c - 3 ( 3 and 4 ) were inactive .
on the other hand , all isolated cycloartane triterpenes ( 6 - 9 ) showed strong alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity , however , their structure - activity relationships have not been discussed yet due to the limited number of compounds .
these results indicated that the strong active compounds such as mekongsterol b ( 2 ; ic50 , 2.5 mum ) and magiferonic acid ( 8 ; ic50 , 1.2 mum ) can potentially be developed as a novel natural nutraceutical to decrease the blood glucose level because of their strong alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity .

alpha - glucosidase inhibitory assay the inhibitory activity of alpha - glucosidase was determined according to the modified method of kim et al .
[ 15 ] .
3 mm p - nitrophenyl - alpha - d - glucopyranoside ( 25 mul ) and 0.2 u / ml alpha - glucosidase ( 25 mul ) in 0.01 m phosphate buffer ( ph = 7.0 ) were added to the sample solution ( 625 mul ) to start the reaction .
each reaction was carried out at 37 degreesc for 30 min and stopped by adding 0.1 m na2co3 ( 375 mul ) .
enzymatic activity was quantified by measuring absorbance at 401 nm. one unit of alpha - glucosidase activity was defined as amount of enzyme liberating p - nitrophenol ( 1.0 mum ) per min .
the ic50 value was defined as the concentration of alpha - glucosidase inhibitor that inhibited 50 % of alpha - glucosidase activity .
acarbose , a known alpha - glucosidase inhibitor , was used as positive control .
conclusions in this paper , we have reported two new compounds , mekongsterol a ( 1 ) and mekongsterol b ( 2 ) , together with seven known compounds isolated from the bark of m. mekongensis .
seven compounds possessed alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity .
this is the first report on alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity of the bark of this plant .
these results suggested that the traditional use of the bark of m. mekongensis for the treatment of diabetes diseases in vietnam may be attributable to the alpha - glucosidase inhibitory activity of its steroid and cycloartane constituents .

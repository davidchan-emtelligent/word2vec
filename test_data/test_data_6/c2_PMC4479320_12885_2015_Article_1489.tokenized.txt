background valosin containing protein ( vcp ) is a critical mediator of protein homeostasis and may represent a valuable therapeutic target for several forms of cancer .
overexpression of vcp occurs in many cancers , and often in a manner correlating with malignancy and poor outcome .
here , we analyzed vcp expression in canine lymphoma and assessed its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease .
methods vcp expression in canine lymphomas was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry .
the canine lymphoma cell lines clbl - 1 , 17 - 71 and cl - 1 were treated with the vcp inhibitor eeyarestatin 1 ( eer - 1 ) at varying concentrations and times and were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion , apoptosis by tunel and caspase activity assays , and proliferation by propidium iodide incorporation and facs .
the mechanism of eer - 1 action was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses of lys48 ubiquitin and markers of er stress ( ddit3 ) , autophagy ( sqstm1 , map1lc3a ) and dna damage ( gammah2afx ) .
trp53 / atm - dependent signaling pathway activity was assessed by immunoblotting for trp53 and phospho - trp53 and real - time rt - pcr measurement of cdkn1a mrna .
results vcp expression levels in canine b cell lymphomas were found to increase with grade .
eer - 1 treatment killed canine lymphoma cells preferentially over control peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
eer - 1 treatment of clbl - 1 cells was found to both induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in g1 .
unexpectedly , eer - 1 did not appear to act either by inducing er stress or inhibiting the aggresome - autophagy pathway .
rather , a rapid and dramatic increase in gammah2afx expression was noted , indicating that eer - 1 may act by promoting dna damage accumulation .
increased trp53 phosphorylation and cdkn1a mrna levels indicated an activation of the trp53 / atm dna damage response pathway in response to eer - 1 , likely contributing to the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest .
conclusions these results correlate vcp expression with malignancy in canine b cell lymphoma .
the selective activity of eer - 1 against lymphoma cells suggests that vcp will represent a clinically useful therapeutic target for the treatment of lymphoma .
we further suggest a mechanism of eer - 1 action centered on the dna repair response that may be of central importance for the design and characterization of vcp inhibitory compounds for therapeutic use .

keywords lymphoma valosin containing protein therapeutic targeting dna damage apoptosis dog issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background canine lymphoma shares many similarities with human non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) with respect to its molecular and clinical features [ 1 , 2 ] .
it is one of the most common neoplasms in dogs and its incidence is reported to be on the rise , at more than 33 diagnoses per 100 000 dog - years in 2002 [ 3 ] .
dogs will usually present with rapidly progressing , high grade , multicentric disease in an advanced stage ( iii or iv / v ) .
not unlike humans , the most common histologic subtype diagnosed is diffuse large b cell lymphoma [ 4 ] .
first line treatment is a " chop " - based ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , corticosteroids ) chemotherapy protocol , which results in a complete response of 6 to 11 months duration in greater than 80 % of cases .
however , overall survival for dogs with lymphoma remains brief , and averages 12 months with approximately 10 % surviving 2 years [ 5 ] .
as is the case for human nhl , chemoresistance occurring either at onset or at recurrence is a main reason why treatment ultimately fails [ 6 , 7 ] .
the many similarities as well as the rapid course of disease make canine lymphoma an attractive model for the study of novel therapeutics for nhl .
several strategies are currently being investigated to circumvent chemoresistance .
one that seems to hold particular promise is the development of molecular - targeted therapies based on the molecular pathways that drive nhl cell proliferation and survival [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] .
among the druggable targets currently under investigation in the pharmaceutical industry is valosin containing protein ( vcp , also known as p97 ) .
vcp is a member of the aaa family of atpases and is a critical mediator of protein homeostasis [ 8 ]. through its interaction with several accessory proteins and cofactors , vcp notably mediates endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation ( erad ) , the process by which misfolded proteins localized in the er lumen or membrane are eliminated .
following their ubiquitination , vcp is thought to extract the targeted proteins from the er in an atp - dependent manner , and maintain their misfolded state until they can be degraded by the cellular proteasomal machinery [ 9 ] .
vcp is also involved in the aggresome - autophagy pathway , which is required for the clearance of misfolded proteins that form aggregates in the cytosol .
here , vcp may act to recruit e4b ubiquitin ligase activity to aggregates of misfolded proteins [ 10 ] and / or mediate the fusion of misfolded protein - containing autophagosomes with lysosomes [ 11 ] .
more recently , vcp has also been associated with the degradation of chromatin - associated proteins , including those involved in processes such as dna replication and repair , cell division , and gene transcription [ 12 , 13 ] .
inhibition of vcp activity therefore has a range of consequences for the cell , beginning with the accumulation of misfolded , polyubiquitinated proteins and culminating in apoptosis , often triggered by er stress and the unfolded protein response [ 14 , 15 ] .
due to their higher metabolic and proliferative rates , cancer cells require increased activities of er machinery in facilitating protein folding , assembly , and transport , and are therefore thought to be more reliant on vcp for the clearance of misfolded proteins that their normal counterparts [ 16 ] .
this is supported by the documented overexpression of vcp in many cancers including lymphoma , and often in a manner correlating with malignancy and poor outcome [ 17 - 20 ] .
evidence is accumulating that suggests that vcp represents a valid therapeutic target for a range of cancers. of particular relevance to the present study , the vcp inhibitor eeyarestatin 1 ( eer - 1 ) was shown to have a strongly preferential cytotoxic activity against various human haematological cancer cell lines , relative to peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) [ 15 ] .
eer - 1 also inhibited tumor growth in a mouse non - small cell lung cancer xenograft model , without overt side effects [ 21 ] .
these studies , coupled with the ongoing development of small molecule inhibitors of vcp intended for therapeutic use [ 22 , 23 ] , indicate that vcp will represent a major target in the development of the next generation of cancer treatments .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate vcp as a therapeutic target for lymphoma using the canine model .
here , we show that vcp expression correlates with malignancy in canine b - cell lymphoma .
we further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of vcp results in preferential lymphoma cell kill over pbmcs , validating vcp as a therapeutic target .
unexpectedly , we also found evidence suggesting that eer - 1 induces apoptosis in clbl - 1 cells via the accumulation of dna damage rather than by the induction of er stress .
these findings will serve as the conceptual basis for the design of clinical trials using vcp inhibitory compounds for the treatment of lymphoma .

results vcp expression correlates with malignancy in canine b cell lymphomas to study vcp expression in canine lymphoma , tumor vcp protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting and compared to normal lymph nodes .
whereas low grade b - cell lymphomas were found to express vcp at levels comparable to normal lymph nodes , significantly higher vcp expression was found in high grade b - cell lymphomas ( fig. 1a ) .
immunohistochemical analyses confirmed these findings and further showed that low grade b - cell lymphomas express vcp at a level comparable to lymphocytes present in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles , whereas vcp expression in medium and high grade b - cell lymphomas was more comparable to that found in lymphocytes of germinal centers ( fig. 1b ) .
vcp expression in t - cell lymphomas on the other hand did not vary significantly according to grade ( fig. 1a ) .
vcp expression levels in canine lymphoma cell lines were also analyzed by immunoblotting and compared to pbmcs .
analyses included the b - cell lymphoma - derived lines clbl - 1 and 17 - 71 , and the t - cell lymphoma line cl - 1 .
vcp expression was found to be to be higher in all lymphomas cell lines compared to pbmcs ( fig. 1c ). fig. 1 vcp protein expression in canine lymphoma .

high , inter ( intermediate ) and low refer to grade , t and b refer to lymphoma cellular subtype , ln = normal lymph node lymphoma cells have an increased sensitivity to vcp inhibition to determine if vcp inhibition would affect lymphoma cells differently than their normal counterparts , clbl - 1 , cl - 1 , 17 - 71 cell lines as well as pbmcs were cultured for 48 h and exposed to increasing concentrations of eer - 1 .
whereas even the highest tested dose failed to reduce numbers of viable pbmcs below ~ 40 % of control , virtually all lymphoma cells were killed by 2 mum ( clbl - 1 and cl - 1 ) or 3 mum ( 17 - 71 ) eer - 1 ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 vcp inhibition decreases canine lymphoma cell viability .
pbmcs , clbl - 1 , 17 - 71 and cl - 1 cells were treated for 48 h with graded doses of eer - 1 .
cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion .
at 1 and 2 mum doses , the proportion of viable pbmcs was significantly higher than in cl - 1 cells ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 , respectively ) .
at 3 , 4 and 5 mum , the proportion of viable pbmcs was significantly higher than clbl - 1 , 17 - 71 or cl - 1 cells ( p < 0.001 for each cell line and for each inhibitor concentration ) .
data are presented as means +/ - sem ( error bars ) , n = 4 replicates per treatment .
the experiment was repeated three times , and a representative result is shown to determine if eer - 1 treatment induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells , tunel assays were done on cultured cells treated with 1 , 2 or 3 mum eer - 1 for 48 h. significant increases in the number of tunel - positive cells was noted in all cell lines at doses of 2 mum or greater , with clbl - 1 cells being the most sensitive to eer - 1 treatment ( fig. 3a , b ) .
to further analyze the kinetics of induction of apoptosis by eer - 1 , clbl - 1 cells were cultured for 6 , 12 and 24 h with or without 3 mum eer - 1 , and the activation of the caspase cascade determined using the caspase - glo 3 / 7 assay. by this method , eer - 1 was found to induce apoptosis as early as 12 h post - treatment ( fig. 3c ). fig. 3 vcp inhibition induces apotosis in canine lymphoma cell lines .

for both experiments , n = 3 replicates per treatment , each experiment was repeated three times and a representative result is shown to assess the effects of vcp inhibition on cell proliferation , cell cycle distribution was determined in clbl - 1 cells at different times following eer - 1 treatment .
propidium iodide incorporation and facs analyses showed no effect of eer - 1 after 6 or 12 h of treatment ( not shown ) , but after 24 h the proportion of cells in the s and g2 / m phases was reduced , as evidenced by decreased heights of the g2 / m peak and the s - phase plateau between the g0 / g1 and g2 / m peaks ( fig. 4 , quantification shown in 4a ) .
this was accompanied by a modest ( c.5 %) but significant increase in g0 / g1 peak ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 vcp inhibition results in g1 cell cycle arrest.a propidium iodide incorporation / facs analysis of vehicle - treated ( white columns ) or eer - 1 - treated ( black columns ) cells .

gray arrows indicate the populations that were defined as g0 / g1 , s and g2 / m vcp inhibition results in dna damage and trp53 pathway activation vcp is central to cellular protein homeostasis [ 8 ] .
as such it is involved in many aspects of cellular protein degradation including endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation ( erad ) , the aggresome - autophagy pathway ( aa ) and chromatin - associated degradation ( cad ) .
to determine if the cytotoxicity of eer - 1 in lymphoma cells could be specifically associated with perturbations in any of the aforementioned processes , clbl - 1 cells were cultured and treated with eer - 1 over a time course .
immunoblotting was then done to assess levels of lys48 polyubiquitinated proteins , as well as markers of erad ( ddit3 ) , aa ( sqstm1 , map1lc3a ) and dna damage ( gammah2afx , a marker of double - stranded dna breaks ) .
as expected , eer - 1 treatment resulted in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins with peak levels observed 6 h post - treatment ( fig. 5 ) , reflecting decreased proteosomal degradation .
surprisingly however , no alterations in ddit3 , sqstm1 or map1lc3a were detected , whereas the positive controls thapsigargin and chloroquine readily induced ddit3 and map1lc3a ( ii ) expression , respectively ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
these findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of eer - 1 were not the result of erad or aa inhibition .
conversely , a dramatic increase in gammah2afx levels was noted at all time points , attaining peak levels at 12 h following eer - 1 treatment .
immunofluorescence analyses of clbl - 1 cells confirmed the increase in gammah2afx expression in response to eer - 1 , and in a manner coincident with the accumulation of lys48 polyubiquitinated proteins in both the cytoplasm and nucleus ( fig. 6 ). fig. 5 vcp inhibition induces concomitant increases in lys48 polyubiquitinated proteins and gammah2afx .

the experiment was repeated three times , and a representative result is shown fig. 6 vcp inhibition results in nuclear lys48 ubiquitin protein accumulation and dna damage .
cells were cultured for 12 h with or without 3 mum eer - 1 .
co - immunolabelling was performed for lys48 ubiquitin and gammah2afx for treated ( right panels ) and untreated cells ( left panels ) .
a negative control was performed without the primary antibody ( not shown ) as these results suggested that eer - 1 - induced apoptosis in clbl - 1 cells may be the direct result of dna damage , we determined if eer - 1 treatment activates the trp53 / atm - dependent signaling pathway .
in the latter , the kinase atm is recruited to double - stranded dna breaks and phosphorylates a range of substrates including the tumor suppressor protein trp53 .
phospho - trp53 in turn participates in the transcriptional activation of the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor cdkn1a , resulting in cell cycle arrest g1 / s checkpoint or apoptosis [ 27 ] .
clbl - 1 cells were cultured and treated with eer - 1 in a time course experiment , and trp53 ( ser15 ) phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblotting and cdkn1a expression was evaluated by qrt - pcr .
both phosphotrp53 and the ratio of phospho : total trp53 increased progressively in response to eer - 1 , attaining statistical significance at 24 h post - treatment ( fig. 7a ) .
cdkn1a mrna levels were also increased in the treated group compared to control at all time points examined ( fig. 7b ). fig. 7 eer - 1 treatment results in trp53 pathway activation in canine lymphoma cells .

the experiment was repeated three times , and representative results are shown discussion a number of studies so far have examined vcp expression in human malignancies [ 18 - 20 , 28 - 33 ] , but only zhu et al. have specifically studied lymphoma [ 17 ] .
in the latter report , vcp expression levels in primary orbital malt lymphoma ( a type of b - cell lymphoma ) were found to correlate in a positive manner with disease recurrence and in a negative manner with patient survival [ 17 ] .
here , we show for the first time that increased vcp expression also occurs in canine b - cell lymphoma , specifically in high - grade forms of the disease .
the biological significance of this finding remains to be determined , but could indicate that malignant b - cell lymphomas produce greater amounts of polyubiquitinated and misfolded proteins than normal b cells , therefore requiring increased levels of vcp expression to ensure their proteosomal degradation , reduce er stress and avoid undergoing apoptosis .
why malignant b cells would produce more polyubiquitinated and misfolded proteins is also unclear , but could simply be a by - product of their increased secretory , metabolic and proliferative activity .
indeed , others have suggested that the secretory demands that come with b - cell differentiation may result in a basal level of er stress and unfolded protein response activation [ 34 - 36 ] .
furthermore , we found vcp expression in high - grade b - cell lymphomas to be comparable to that found in the germinal centers of lymph nodes , which represent a highly proliferative subpopulation of b cells [ 37 ] .
conversely , vcp expression in low grade b - cell lymphomas was comparable to that found in the ( more differentiated and less proliferative ) b cells that compose the mantle zone .
vcp expression may therefore reflect both the malignancy and the proliferative activity of b - cell lymphomas , and may be predictive of their responsiveness to vcp - targeted therapies .
the latter theory appears to be supported by our pharmacological studies , as the b - cell lymphoma lines 17 - 71 and clbl - 1 had increased vcp expression and were far more sensitive to vcp inhibition than normal blood mononuclear cells .
given the nature of its biological functions , several authors have proposed that vcp could represent a pharmacological target for the treatment of cancer [ 8 , 12 , 16 , 21 , 38 ] .
indeed , several novel vcp - inhibitory compounds have recently been reported [ 14 , 22 , 23 , 39 - 41 ] and are currently under development for therapeutic use .
the first indication that vcp inhibitors could be useful against lymphoma was a study by wang et al. , which showed that eer - 1 has a strongly preferential cytotoxic activity against several human haematological cancer cell lines ( including mantle cell and burkitt 's lymphoma lines ) relative to blood mononuclear cells [ 15 ] .
in the present study , we show that eer - 1 has a similar selective toxicity towards canine lymphoma cells relative to normal mononuclear cells .
this finding suggest that vcp - targeted therapy will be as relevant to canine lymphoma as it will to the human disease , and further highlights the value of spontaneous canine lymphoma as a model for translational studies .
to investigate the mechanism of eer - 1 action in clbl - 1 cells , we began by assessing its effects on er stress .
wang et al. demonstrated that treatment of the mantle cell lymphoma line jeko - 1 with 10 mum eer - 1 resulted in a dramatic increase in the expression of er stress markers including ddit3 within 10 h [ 15 ] .
these authors further showed that the er stress - responsive transcription factors atf3 and atf4 participate in the transcriptional activation of the pro - apoptotic gene noxa , suggesting that the induction of er stress by eer - 1 represents a major pathway through which it exerts its cytotoxic effect .
surprisingly , we were not able to find any evidence of increased er stress ( or alteration of the functioning of the aggresome - autophagy pathway ) in clbl - 1 cells under the treatment conditions that we used , leading us to investigate additional vcp - regulated biological processes .
multiple studies in recent years have shown that vcp extracts ubiquitinated substrates from chromatin , and that interference with this activity results in protein - induced chromatin stress , the consequences of which include inadequate responses to dna damage and genomic instability [ 12 ] .
here , we show that eer - 1 treatment results in a rapid accumulation in dna damage in clbl - 1 cells in a manner co - incident with the accumulation of lys48 polyubiquitinated proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus .
we further show that this is accompanied by an induction of the trp53 / atm - dependent signaling pathway and results in an increase in cdkn1a expression , which in turn is a likely mediator of both the g1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis that were observed .
exactly how eer - 1 treatment results in increased dna damage remains to be determined .
a recent study [ 42 ] has shown that the dna damage recognition subunits ddb2 and xpc must be promptly removed from chromatin in a vcp - dependent manner during dna excision repair .
reduced vcp activity results in prolonged retention of ddb2 and xpc , which in turn results in an attenuation of repair and causes chromosomal aberrations [ 42 ] .
further studies will be required to determine if a similar mechanism occurs in lymphoma cells in response to eer - 1 , if additional processes and mediators are involved in mediating eer - 1 toxicity , as well as to verify that the " dna damage " mechanism is also relevant to human lymphoid malignancies .
conclusions this study validated vcp as a novel therapeutic target for canine lymphoma and identified a novel cellular mechanism of eer - 1 action centered on the dna repair response .
further studies are needed to determine the precise pathways that lead to dna damage , trp53 activation and to apoptosis .
although an unexpected mechanism of action was identified in this instance , the canine model nonetheless permits the evaluation of novel therapeutic targets in an immunocompetent host with a spontaneously occurring cancer , and will therefore , in our opinion , represent a valid and valuable system to study vcp as a therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies .

in africa , asia , latin america , and parts of oceania , envenoming after snakebite is a serious public health problem [ 1 ] .
conservative data suggest that between 1.2 and 5.5 million people suffer snakebites every year , resulting in 25,000 to 125,000 deaths and leaving approximately 400,000 victims with permanent sequelae [ 2,3 ] .
despite its significant impact on human health , this disease remains largely neglected by national and international health authorities , funding agencies , pharmaceutical companies , patients' organizations , and health advocacy groups [ 1,2 ] .
most initiatives aiming to study snakes , snake venoms , and snakebite envenoming and its treatment approach the problem from a biomedical and technological perspective .
notwithstanding the substantial scientific and clinical legacy generated through this view , significant gaps remain in our understanding of other highly relevant aspects of this problem and its solutions .
the emerging field of global health has brought about a more holistic approach to health issues by incorporating a " biosocial approach " to the understanding of diseases and the circumstances behind their occurrence [ 4 ] .
the centrepiece of this approach is the integration of biomedical aspects - - including etiology , pathophysiology , diagnosis , and therapy - - with the analysis of the social , economic , psychological , cultural , and political contexts in which diseases occur .
snakebite envenoming is predominantly a disease of the poor [ 5 ] , with the highest incidence and severity seen in regions facing complex and interrelated social and economic problems .
understanding how this interplay of variables influences both the circumstances leading to snakebite injury and its consequences is crucial to developing successful strategies to mitigate the problem .
a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach incorporating social research into the study of snakebite envenoming is needed .
hereby , we aim to increase awareness of the following areas where reinvigorated social research would be highly beneficial .
dimensioning the magnitude and social implications of the snakebite problem a key issue undermining advocacy efforts to measure the impact of snakebite envenoming worldwide is the poor level of information on incidence , mortality , sequelae , and social suffering associated with this disease .
most studies are based on hospital statistics that greatly underestimate the burden .
well - designed , adequately powered , community - based surveys of snakebite incidence and mortality are required to provide reliable data ( see [ 6,7 ] , for example ) .
one key morbidity indicator , the disability adjusted life year ( daly ) , is rarely used to appreciate the impact of snakebite envenoming .
we stress the need to evaluate the degree of broader " social suffering ," i.e. , the effects on people with personal and economic links to the envenomed person .
gathering this information will be possible by using community surveys and household interviews to collect data on the circumstances of the bites , whether the victim attended health facilities , the extent and type of attention provided by local traditional healers , and the consequences and sequelae of envenoming , including physical , psychological , and economical aspects .
we recommend that these surveys also identify socio - ethnic , occupational , biogeographic , and behavioural factors that remain undetected in conventional hospital - based or national - level public health data .
these efforts should also shed light on the incidence of post - envenoming disability , both temporary and permanent .
few studies highlight the large impact of physical , psychological , and economic sequelae that result from snakebites [ 8,9 ] .
identifying barriers to antivenom access availability and accessibility of antivenoms is limited in sub - saharan africa , asia , and , to a lesser extent , latin america [ 2 ] .
such shortages lead to a vicious cycle whereby poor supply results in higher prices and lower confidence in the public health sector 's ability to provide effective and safe antivenoms [ 10,11 ] .
we stress that a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of pharmaceutical supply , distribution , and affordability in regions with limited access to antivenom is crucial for devising improved accessibility strategies .
concomitantly , there is a need for economic analysis of both the sustainability of antivenom supply systems and the modelling of new economic strategies for financing production , distribution , and supply through to the end users .
cost - effectiveness studies of antivenom treatment should also be promoted [ 12 ] .
comparisons of approaches used for vaccines and other biologicals may provide useful insights .
we trust that renewed research efforts on these topics will help in designing novel strategies for improving antivenom availability and accessibility .
exploring the access to health services snakebite envenomings are medical emergencies that require prompt medical attention .
hence , a key issue for reducing their biosocial impact is rapid access to effective healthcare .
in many snakebite - affected countries , an envenomed victim may need to walk ( or be carried ) for many kilometres to reach a primary health post .
thus , studies of the circumstances that delay the access of people bitten by a snake to health centres are of great value .
moreover , having antivenom in stock is not the complete answer .
rural health facilities also require the proper storage infrastructure , which encompasses cold - chain procedures and equipment and access to the other medicines , equipment , and consumables that are necessary to administer antivenom .
beyond initiating treatment , reliable communications infrastructures , transport routes , and ways to ensure the safe transfer of envenomed patients to advanced facilities are all needed [ 13 ] .
we urge research on the organization of public health services and infrastructure in regions of high incidence of snakebites , as well as on issues associated with medical training and antivenom supply and use .
innovative schemes are needed and they require field studies , such as the centralized " hub - and - spoke " strategy proposed for nigeria , which not only broadens antivenom access but also implements quality assurance , standardization , and training of health staff [ 14 ] .
likewise , a " diagonal " approach in primary health care should be explored , in which the prevention and treatment of envenomings parallel the general strengthening of public health systems .
improving the training of health staff : how to organize teaching activities tailored to local needs the skills of personnel at all levels of the health system are critical determinants of effective snakebite envenoming treatment .
while much of this education needs to be integrated into the curricula of medical and nursing schools , it should also be included in continuing medical education programs , especially in areas where envenoming is common .
training programs should be designed around robust performance indicators that can be regularly evaluated to assess teaching outcomes , and evaluate the currency and appropriateness of their content .
to this end , the preparation of national or regional guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of snakebite envenomings is of utmost relevance .
the design of training curricula should be guided by baseline research aimed at determining the current level of staff knowledge in different roles and settings .
information and communication technologies open the door to much wider dissemination of standard protocols ; the selection of the particular technologies implementable in each local setting should be supported by a knowledge - based approach strengthened by renewed research initiatives .
understanding the impact of the local context : the perception of snakebite in different cultural settings one of the great failures of " vertical ," top - down interventions in public health issues is the lack of understanding of the way local communities perceive health problems .
consequently , snakebite prevention and intervention programs at the community level should include in - depth analyses of the cultural characteristics of the communities , the way snakes and snakebites are perceived , the cultural background of local healers , and the perception of state - based , westernized medical services .
the reasons why people bitten by snakes do not attend local facilities should be thoroughly investigated .
in this context , ethno - anthropological research is a priority and should be readily implemented in regions of high snakebite incidence .
designing strategies to improve prevention and early management : how do communities organize help for snakebite victims ?
the two most critical aspects of any comprehensive snakebite management strategy linked to local settings and community organizations are prevention and early management of cases .
public campaigns for snakebite prevention require a detailed knowledge of the cultural features of rural communities and their organization and leadership through anthropological research .
the use of local languages and dialects , and the involvement of the local population in the community programs , should be incorporated at early stages in prevention efforts .
in general , the active engagement of communities in the development of health intervention programs greatly increases the likelihood of success [ 15 ] .
final remarks we wish to stress that the approaches to confront snakebite envenoming as a public health problem must go beyond the biomedical and technological paradigms and should encompass socio - ethnic , socio - economic , and anthropological perspectives .
the integration of natural and social sciences in the study of snakebite envenoming , in association with community - based , national , and international advocacy efforts , will certainly bring a fresh and renewed perspective towards understanding and reducing the dramatic burden of this complex and neglected health problem .

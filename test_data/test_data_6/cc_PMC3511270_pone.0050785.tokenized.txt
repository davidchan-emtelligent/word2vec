the wild species solanum habrochaites is more cold tolerant than the cultivated tomato ( s. lycopersicum ) .
to explore the mechanisms underlying cold tolerance of s. habrochaites , seedlings of s. habrochaites la1777 introgression lines ( ils ) , as well as the two parents , were evaluated under low temperature ( 4degreesc ) .
the il la3969 and its donor parent la1777 were found to be more cold tolerant than the recurrent parent s. lycopersicum la4024 .
the differences in physiology and global gene expression between cold - tolerant ( la1777 and la3969 ) and - sensitive ( la4024 ) genotypes under cold stress were further investigated .
comparative transcriptome analysis identified 1613 , 1456 , and 1523 cold - responsive genes in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively .
gene ontology ( go ) term enrichment analysis revealed that more go biological process terms were significantly enriched among the up - regulated genes in the two tolerant genotypes , whereas more biological processes were significantly repressed by cold stress in the sensitive one .
a total of 92 genes with significant differential expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress were identified .
among these , many stress - related go terms were significantly enriched , such as ' response to stimulus' and ' response to stress ' .
moreover , go terms ' response to hormone stimulus ' , ' response to reactive oxygen species ( ros )' , and ' calcium - mediated signaling ' were also overrepresented .
several transcripts involved in hormone or ros homeostasis were also differentially expressed .
ros , hormones , and calcium as signaling molecules may play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress .
moreover , the expression of various transcription factors , post - translational proteins , metabolic enzymes , and photosynthesis - related genes was also specifically modulated .
these specific modifications may play pivotal roles in conferring cold tolerance in tomato .
these results not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance in tomato , but also provide potential candidate genes for genetic improvement .

introduction low temperature is one of the key limiting factors that affect plant distribution , growth , development , production , and survival .
plants from temperate regions can increase freezing tolerance by cold acclimation [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]. by contrast , plants from tropical regions , such as rice , maize , and tomato , are unable to cold acclimate and are sensitive to chilling temperatures ( 0 to 12degreesc ) [ 3 ] .
the cultivated tomato ( s. lycopersicum ) suffers from chilling injury at all stages of plant growth and development , including seed germination , growth , and fruit set. by contrast , the wild species s. habrochaites grows well at chilling temperatures and has been proposed as a potential germplasm resource of cold tolerance in tomato breeding [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
in the past decade , many physiological responses to cold stress were comparatively analyzed between s. habrochaites and s. lycopersicum , for review see [ 5 ] .
although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain tolerance or sensitivity to chilling in plants , the physiological mechanisms responsible for cold tolerance remain unclear [ 7 ] .
the c - repeat binding factor ( cbf ) cold response pathway is currently the best documented genetic system that plays a pivotal role in gene regulation during cold acclimation [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] .
exposing arabidopsis plants to low temperatures results in the rapid induction of cbf genes [ 9 ] .
cbfs can bind to the crt / dre regulatory element in the promoters of many cold - inducible genes and activate their expression [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
global transcriptome analysis revealed that approximately 12 % of cold - regulated genes are controlled by the cbfs in arabidopsis [ 11 ] .
tomato also has a complete cbf cold response pathway , but its cbf regulon differs from that of arabidopsis and appears to be considerably smaller and less diverse in function [ 3 ] .
the cbf cold response pathway in tomato is not as important as in cold - acclimated plants .
several studies have explored the genetic basis of cold tolerance in s. habrochaites .
vallejos and tanksley identified three quantitative trait loci ( qtls ) for the plastochron index at low temperatures using a bc1 population derived from cold - sensitive s. lycopersicum cv .
t3 and a cold - tolerant s. habrochaites [ 12 ] .
in another study , several qtls associated with shoot wilting and root ammonium uptake under low temperatures were identified in a s. lycopersicum x s. habrochaites bc1 population [ 13 ] .
a major - effect qtl for shoot turgor maintenance under root chilling stress was then fine mapped to a 2.7 cm region between markers t1670 and t1673 on chromosome 9 [ 7 ] .
meanwhile , an il population of s. habrochaites la1777 was developed by monforte and tanksley [ 14 ] .
this il population represents more than 85 % of the genome of s. habrochaites la1777 in the genetic background of s. lycopersicum la4024 .
this il population provides a valuable resource for exploring qtls / genes involved in cold tolerance in tomato .
transcriptome analysis using microarray has been widely used to investigate global gene expression in response to abiotic stress .
transcriptional profiling under cold stress has been carried out in different plant species , such as arabidopsis [ 11 ] , [ 15 ] , rice [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , and barley [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
in tomato , transcriptome analysis has been used to compare patterns of gene expression under salt or drought stress [ 20 ] - [ 22 ] .
however , to the best of our knowledge , comparative transcriptome analysis of cold - tolerant and - sensitive tomato under cold stress is yet to be reported .
in this study , the il la3969 and its donor parent la1777 were found to be more tolerant to cold stress than the recurrent parent s. lycopersicum la4024 under cold stress .
to explore the differences in gene expression between cold - tolerant and - sensitive tomato genotypes under cold stress , the gene expression profiles of the two tolerant genotypes ( la1777 and la3969 ) and the cold - sensitive recurrent parent ( la4024 ) were comparatively analyzed .
the results presented here provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cold tolerance of the wild tomato s. habrochaites .
materials and methods plant materials and cold stress treatment seeds of 93 ils as well as their two parents , s. lycopersicum la4024 and s. habrochaites la1777 , were kindly supplied by tomato genetics research center ( university of california , davis , usa ) .
most of the lines contain a single defined introgression from la1777 in the genetic background of la4024 [ 14 ] .
all the seeds were surface - sterilized and then sown individually in 10 cm diameter plastic pots containing peat , vermiculite and soil ( v / v / v = 1:1:1 ) .
the seedlings were grown in temperature regimes of 24 - 28degreesc day / 20 - 25degreesc night and relative humidity of 70 - 80 % under natural light in a greenhouse .
six - week - old seedlings were used for cold stress treatments .
to screen cold - tolerant ils , uniform - sized plants were selected and transferred into a cold chamber with a temperature of 4degreesc , a 16 h photoperiod ( irradiation intensity 120 micromol m - 2s - 1 ) , and 70 % to 80 % relative humidity .
three replicates were used for each il , with nine plants per replicate .
in the first round of screening , 22 ils that exhibited less severe wilting than the recurrent parent la4024 after 3 d of chilling stress were identified as putative cold - tolerant lines .
these selected ils and the two parents were further analyzed .
after two weeks of chilling stress and then one week of recovery , the survival rates of these ils were recorded .
for physiological and microarray analysis , uniform seedlings of the selected line la3969 and the two parents were used .
the cold stress treatment was conducted as described above .
seedlings of the control group were grown at 25degreesc .
the second and third leaves were sampled after 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 d of treatment .
the leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc until use .
three independent biological samples for each treatment were harvested , and each replicate contained 15 plants .
measurements of electrolyte leakage , lipid peroxidation , proline and total soluble sugars relative electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation were used to evaluate the cell membrane damage .
lipid peroxidation was estimated by determining malondialdehyde ( mda ) content .
relative electrolyte leakage of leaf discs and mda content were determined as described by campos et al .
[ 23 ] .
levels of free proline were measured according to the method described by zhang et al .
[ 24 ] .
total soluble sugar content was analyzed using the anthrone method , with glucose as the standard [ 25 ] .
measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the third leaves were measured at different time points after the treatment using a pulse - modulated fluorometer ( fms - 2 , hansatech , uk ) according to the method described by wingler et al .
[ 26 ] .
the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii ( psii ) photochemistry was calculated as fv / fm = ( fm - f 0 )/ fm. the quantum yield of psii electron transport , phipsii was calculated as phipsii = ( f 'm - fs )/ f'm. histochemical detection of ros histochemical staining of superoxide radical ( o2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) was performed as previously described by xia et al .
[ 27 ] with minor modifications .
the terminal leaflets of the first fully expanded leaf from six - week - old seedlings treated at 4degreesc for 0 , 1 , and 3 d were used for staining .
to detect the presence of o2 - , the leaflets were vacuum infiltrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.8 ) containing 0.1 mg ml - 1 nitroblue tetrazolium ( nbt ) and incubated at 25degreesc in the dark for 2 h. to detect the presence of h2o2 , the leaflets were vacuum infiltrated in 1 mg ml - 1 diaminobenzidine ( dab ) in 50 mm tris - acetate ( ph 3.8 ) and incubated at 25degreesc in the dark for 8 h. to remove chlorophylls , the stained samples were transferred to 80 % ethanol and incubated at 70degreesc for 10 min .
images were taken with a digital camera .
enzyme extraction and assay tomato leaves ( approximately 200 mg ) were homogenized in 2 ml of ice - cold 0.1 m phosphate buffer ( ph 7.0 ) containing 0.1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone .
the homogenates were centrifuged at 4degreesc for 15 min at 12,000 rpm .
the supernatant was used for the determination of enzyme activities .
superoxide dismutase ( sod ; ec 1.15.1.1 ) , ascorbate peroxidase ( apx ; ec 1.11.1.11 ) , and catalase ( cat ; ec 1.11.1.6 ) activities were assayed as described by mittova et al .
[ 28 ] .
peroxidase ( pod ; ec 1.11.1.7 ) activity was assayed following the method described by morohashi [ 29 ] .
microarray analysis total rnas from the leaf samples of the control and cold stress treatment ( 3 d at 4degreesc ) were used for microarray analysis .
microarrays were performed using the tom2 oligo microarray ( http :// ted.bti.cornell.edu /) .
three independent biological replicates were applied for each pair of control and cold stress treatments .
dual channel microarray hybridization was carried out with a cy3 - labeled control sample and a cy5 - labeled cold stress - treated sample .
rna isolation , amplification , labeling , and array hybridizations were performed essentially as described by gong et al .
[ 21 ] .
arrays were scanned with a luxscan 10ka confocal laser scanner ( capitalbio , china ) , and the raw data were extracted using luxscan ( tm ) 3.0 software ( capitalbio , china ) .
a print - tip lowess normalization method was used to normalize the ratio values [ 30 ] .
normalized ratio data were then log2 transformed .
to identify cold - responsive genes , data were analyzed with the sam ( significance analysis of microarrays ) package [ 31 ] .
genes with a q - value ( false discovery rate ) of less than 0.05 and a log2 ratio ( cold stress / control ) more than 2 or less than - 2 were considered as cold - responsive genes .
to further identify cold - responsive genes with significant ( p < 0.05 ) differential expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes , statistical comparisons between tolerant and sensitive genotypes were made by student 's t test using sigmaplot 12 .
the probe sequences of differentially expressed genes were retrieved from the tomato functional genomics database ( http :// ted.bti.cornell.edu ) .
to determine the chromosomal location of these genes , the probe sequences were further used as query sequences for the blastn search against sgn tomato whole genome chromosome database ( sl2.40 ; http :// solgenomics.net / tools / blast / index.pl ) .
gene annotation and go term enrichment analysis were performed using the tomato functional genomics database [ 32 ] .
identification of significantly altered biochemical pathways was performed using the plant metgenmap system [ 33 ] .
the mapman software was employed to reveal the cold - responsive genes associated with photosynthesis , ros , calcium regulation , transcription , and post - translational modifications [ 34 ] .
gene expression profiles were clustered using genesis software [ 35 ] .
the microarray data have been deposited in the tomato functional genomics database , accession number e060 .
quantitative rt - pcr total rna was isolated using the trizol reagent ( invitrogen , usa ) , and dnase i was used to clean out dna .
first - strand cdna was synthesized from 3 microg of total rna with oligo ( dt ) and mmlv reverse transcriptase ( toyobo , osaka , japan ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) was carried out using the lightcycler480 system ( roche ) and sybr ( r ) premix ex taq ( tm ) ( takara ) according to the supplier 's manual .
the pcr cycling conditions were as follows : 95degreesc for 1 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 5s and 60degreesc for 20 s. melting curve was routinely performed after 40 cycles to verify primer specificity .
tomato elongation factor 1alpha ( ef1alpha ) was used as internal control for qpcr analysis [ 36 ] .
the fold change in the expression of each gene was calculated using the deltadeltact method [ 18 ] .
the relative gene expression level was log2 transformed to make the data easily comparable with the array value .
the primers used for this analysis were designed using the primer3 software ( http :// frodo.wi.mit.edu / primer3 ) .
the primer sequences are listed in table s1 .
results and discussion identification of cold - tolerant il to identify the major chromosomal regions of s. habrochaites genome conferring cold tolerance , seedlings of 93 s. habrochaites ils and the two parents , s. lycopersicum la4024 and s. habrochaites la1777 , were evaluated by cold stress treatment .
twenty - two ils with s. habrochaites introgressions on chromosomes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , and 12 , exhibited less severe wilting than the recurrent parent la4024 after 3 d of treatment at 4degreesc .
after further treatment for two weeks , only one il ( la3969 ) survived and exhibited strong tolerance to cold stress like the donor parent la1777 .
to evaluate accurately the tolerance of la3969 , we compared the performance of this il to its parents during cold stress .
the phenotypic performance of la3969 was quite close to that of la1777 during cold stress and recovery , and showed stronger cold tolerance than la4024 ( figures 1a to 1d ) .
after 10 d of cold stress and recovery for two weeks , the survival rates of la3969 and la1777 were significantly higher than that of la4024 ( p < 0.01 ; figure 1e ) .
although some plants of la4024 still survived , nearly all leaves were dead , except the newly grown ones ( figure 1d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0050785.g001 figure 1 phenotypic and physiological responses of the three tomato genotypes under cold stress .
seedlings of la1777 , la4024 , and la3969 in control ( a ) , treated at 4degreesc for 3 d ( b ) , treated at 4degreesc for 10 d ( c ) , and recovered for two weeks after10 d of cold treatment ( d ) .
survival rates after two weeks of recovery ( e ) .
changes in relative electrolyte leakage ( f ) , mda content ( g ) , proline content ( h ) , and soluble sugar content ( i ) in leaves of the three genotypes treated with 4degreesc for 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 d. three independent biological replicates were used in each treatment , with 15 plants ( six - week - old ) per replicate .
data are presented as mean +/ - se of three independent biological replicates .
asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between tolerant and sensitive genotypes .
* , p < 0.05 ; ** , p < 0.01 , student 's t test .
la3969 contains a large introgressed segment from s. habrochaites on chromosome 12 .
vallejos and tanksley identified three qtls from s. habrochaites responsible for growth at low temperatures , and the locus pgi - 1 on chromosome 12 elicits a significant and positive effect only at low temperatures [ 12 ] .
truco et al. also detected a qtl from s. habrochaites , on chromosome 12 , responsible for recovery from chill - induced wilting [ 13 ] .
therefore , at least one major qtl / gene responsible for cold tolerance is located on s. habrochaites chromosome 12 .
less severe membrane damage in the cold - tolerant genotypes plants subjected to low temperatures frequently suffer membrane damage , which can be evaluated by the relative electrolyte leakage and mda production [ 23 ] .
during cold stress , all tomato genotypes presented a tendency to increase the relative electrolyte leakage and mda content , but the levels of the two tolerant genotypes were significantly lower than that of the sensitive one after 3 d of cold stress ( p < 0.05 ; figures 1f and 1g ) .
the results indicated that the cold - tolerant genotypes suffer less severe membrane damage than the sensitive genotype under cold stress .
compatible solutes , such as proline and carbohydrates , play important roles in cell osmotic adjustment and maintaining membrane integrity [ 37 ] .
therefore , we analyzed the differences in accumulation of proline and soluble sugars between cold - tolerant and - sensitive genotypes under cold stress .
during cold stress , the proline content increased continuously in la1777 .
after 5 d of cold treatment , la1777 had significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher level of proline than la4024 .
but no significant difference in proline content was found between la3969 and la4024 during cold stress ( figure 1h ) .
the total soluble sugar content exhibited an upward trend in all three genotypes during cold stress .
only at 3 d of cold treatment , both tolerant genotypes showed significantly ( p < 0.05 ) lower levels of total soluble sugar than the sensitive one ( figure 1i ) .
therefore , a positive correlation between proline and soluble sugars accumulation and cold tolerance in tomato could not be found .
differences in gene expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress to investigate the differences in gene expression between cold - tolerant ( la1777 and la3969 ) and - sensitive ( la4024 ) tomato genotypes in response to cold stress , we performed comparative transcriptome analysis using tom2 microarray .
after 3 d of cold stress , a total of 1613 ( 864 up - and 749 down - regulated ) , 1456 ( 770 up - and 686 down - regulated ) , and 1523 ( 800 up - and 723 down - regulated ) cold - responsive genes ( q - value < 0.5 , log2 ratio ( cold stress / control ) above 2 and below - 2 ) were identified in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively ( figures 2a and 2b ) .
among them , 103 cold - responsive genes ( 51 up - and 52 down - regulated ) were exclusively identified in both la1777 and la3969 , whereas 196 cold - responsive genes ( 89 up - and 107 down - regulated ) were uniquely observed in la4024 .
a total of 890 genes ( 502 up - and 388 down - regulated ) were commonly regulated by cold stress in all three tomato genotypes .
the large number of cold - responsive genes identified in all three genotypes suggests a common response mechanism to cold stress between cold - tolerant and - sensitive genotypes. s. habrochaites la1777 showed a higher number of specific cold - responsive genes compared to la3969 and la4024 ( figures 2a and 2b ) .
these genes may reveal the difference in response to cold stress between s. habrochaites and s. lycopersicum .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0050785.g002 figure 2 venn diagrams showing number and overlap of differentially expressed genes under cold stress in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 .

( b ) number of down - regulated genes ( log2 ratio stress / control <= - 2 and q - value < 0.05 ) .
the number in parentheses indicates the total number of genes up - or down - regulated by cold stress in each genotype .
to distinguish the cold - responsive genes which are differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , the individual gene expression levels of tolerant and sensitive genotypes were compared further by using student 's t test .
a total of 92 cold - responsive genes with statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) in expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes were identified ( figure s1 ) .
to identify genes that localize to genomic regions contributing to cold tolerance , these 92 genes were mapped to the tomato chromosomes ( sl2.40 ) .
thirty - two genes were found to be located on the introgressed chromosomal segments of the 22 selected cold - tolerant ils and / or cold tolerance qtls identified previously in s. habrochaites ( figures 3 and s1 ). of these , 11 genes were localized to the introgressed segment of la3969 .
according to expression profiles and gene annotation , five genes may play critical roles in conferring the difference in cold tolerance between la3969 and la4024 .
among them , four ( sgn - u212650 , sgn - u219719 , sgn - u212639 , and sgn - u216055 ) were more strongly induced by cold stress in the tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( table 1 ) .
sgn - u212650 encoding leucine aminopeptidase a1 ( lap - a1 ) was up - regulated by 4.04 - , 3.96 - , and 1.70 - fold in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively .
lap - a1 transcript is induced by various stimuli , and it is essential for regulating defense and wound signaling in tomato [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
sgn - u216055 encodes a nac transcription factor similar to arabidopsis rd26 .
the expression of rd26 is induced by cold in arabidopsis , and its transcript level in response to low temperature is significantly reduced in the pi4kiiibeta1beta2 double mutant whose germination is hypersensitive to chilling [ 40 ] .
sgn - u212639 encodes a protein similar to molecular chaperone hsp90 - 1 .
hsp90 is recruited for stomatal closure and serves essential functions in plants to integrate signals from their biotic and abiotic environments [ 41 ] .
glutathione plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential for the regulation of oxidant stress .
the key enzyme involved in glutathione homeostasis is gamma - glutamyltransferase .
sgn - u218110 encoding a gamma - glutamyltransferase was more severely repressed in la4014 than in la1777 and la3969 under cold stress ( table 1 ) .

sgn - u215123 and sgn - u234004 encoding homologues of arabidopsis wrky31 and myb15 were more strongly induced by cold stress in la4024 than in la1777 and la3969 .
atmyb15 has been found to negatively regulate the expression of cold - responsive genes in arabidopsis [ 42 ] .
the other five genes were more strongly induced in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one .
the precise roles of these differentially expressed genes remain to be elucidated via other experimental approaches , such as over - expression and / or rnai strategies .
differences in gene expression between la1777 and la3969 under cold stress la3969 only contains a large introgressed segment from chromosome 12 of s. habrochaites , there are still additional qtls for cold tolerance on other chromosomes of s. habrochaites .
to further identify other genes which may confer cold tolerance in s. habrochaites , the expression levels of individual genes were compared further between la1777 and la3969 by using student 's t test .
a total of 295 cold - responsive genes with statistically significant differences ( p < 0.01 ) in expression between la1777 and la3969 were identified .
among these , 126 genes also showed statistically significant differences in expression between la1777 and la4024 ( table s2 ). of these , 48 genes were mapped to the introgressed regions of the 22 selected cold - tolerant ils and / or cold tolerance qtls identified previously in s. habrochaites ( table s2 ) .
according to chromosomal location , expression profiles , and gene annotation , 15 genes that are most likely to confer cold tolerance were identified ( table 1 ) .
the expression of seven genes in la3969 and la4024 showed opposite expression patterns from la1777 under cold stress .
sgn - u214065 , sgn - u229565 , sgn - u213791 , and sgn - u212850 , coding for a udp - glucosyltransferase , a zinc finger family protein , an acidic 27 kda endochitinase , and a peroxidase , respectively , were down - regulated by cold stress in la1777 , whereas they were up - regulated in la3969 and la4024 .
for example , sgn - u212850 was down - regulated by 1.02 - fold in la1777 , but it was induced by more than 5.50 - fold in la3969 and la4024 under cold stress .
on contrary , two hypothetical proteins ( sgn - u213115 and sgn - u216044 ) , and an amine oxidase ( sgn - u227893 ) were up - regulated by cold stress in la1777 , while they were down - regulated in la3969 and la4024 .
six genes ( sgn - u215206 , sgn - u216449 , sgn - u218236 , sgn - u223072 , sgn - u212825 , and sgn - u223737 ) showed significantly higher fold induction in la1777 than in la3969 and la4024 under cold stress .
it suggested these genes may play positive roles in response to cold stress in tomato .
for instance , sgn - u212825 encoding a homologue of arabidopsis los2 was up - regulated by 3.37 - fold under cold stress in la1777 , whereas only by 0.67 - and 0.88 - fold in la3969 and la4024 , respectively ( table 1 ) .
in arabidopsis , los2 encodes a bi - functional enolase and plays a positive role in the regulation of cold - responsive genes expression via transcriptional repression of zat10 / stz which is a negative regulator of cbf - target genes [ 43 ] .
confirmation of microarray results to confirm our microarray results , 42 genes with differential expression patterns were evaluated using qpcr .
the microarray data showed a very good correlation with the qpcr results ( r = 0.93 ; figure s2 ) .
most of these genes verified by qpcr showed the same expression patterns among the three tomato genotypes as in microarrays .
differences between the two methods were on the quantitative levels .
the qpcr results showed a slightly higher fold induction or repression than the microarray analysis ( table s3 ) .
similar phenomenon has been reported previously [ 44 ] .
previous studies have identified several genes that were regulated by cold stress in tomato .
among them , seven were identified as cold - responsive genes in microarray results .
these include dehydrin [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] , sap8 and sap11 [ 47 ] , alternative oxidase [ 48 ] , levde [ 49 ] , erf2 [ 50 ] , and gme [ 51 ] .
the expression patterns of these genes were similar among the three genotypes or higher in the two tolerant genotypes ( table s4 ) .
for example , sgn - u213745 encoding a dehydrin protein was up - regulated significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive genotype when subjected to cold stress ( 4degreesc ) for 3 days ( p < 0.05 ; figure s1 ) .
this gene has been considered to be a marker gene for cold stress response in tomato [ 46 ] .
these results demonstrate that our microarray results are reliable .
go term enrichment analysis to unravel the significantly altered biological processes upon cold stress , the up - and down - regulated genes of the three tomato genotypes were subjected to the go term enrichment analysis [ 32 ] .
as expected , some stress - related go biological process terms , such as ' response to stress ' , ' response to temperature stimulus ' , ' response to stimulus ' , ' response to abiotic or biotic stimulus ' , and ' defense response ' , were significantly enriched ( p < 0.01 , fdr as the cut - off ) among the up - or down - regulated genes in at least one tomato genotype ( table s5 ) .
more go terms were significantly enriched ( p < 0.01 , fdr as the cut - off ) among the up - regulated genes in the two tolerant genotypes ( figure 4 ; table s5 ) .
among these , ten go terms were specially enriched in both tolerant genotypes. of these , four were involved in stress responses , including ' immune response ' , ' response to abiotic stimulus ' , ' negative regulation of response to stimulus response ' , and ' response to uv ' .
only three go terms were exclusively enriched among the up - regulated genes in la4024 .
however , 23 biological processes were significantly suppressed only in la4024 ( figure 4 ; table s5 ) .
interestingly , some of them are associated with stress responses , such as ' response to external stimulus ' , ' regulation of hormone levels ' , ' calcium ion homeostasis ' , and ' oxidation reduction ' ( figure 4 ) .
more biological processes were significantly inhibited exclusively in la4024 suggests the sensitive genotype is more severely influenced than the two tolerant genotypes under cold stress .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0050785.g004 figure 4 comparison of go biological process terms significantly enriched among the up - and down - regulated genes of la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 under cold stress .
the image was generated using genesis software [ 35 ] .
each colour rectangle in the figure represents one go term .
red indicates go biological process terms that are significantly enriched ( p < 0.01 , fdr as the cut off ) among the up - regulated genes , green indicates go biological process terms that are significantly enriched among the down - regulated genes , and yellow indicates no significant .
significantly enriched go biological process terms identified in both tolerant genotypes or exclusively in the sensitive one are listed .
for more details see table s4 .
to explore the modulated biological processes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , the 92 differentially expressed genes were also analyzed using go term enrichment analysis [ 32 ] .
a total of 21 biological process go terms varied significantly between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( p < 0.01 , fdr as the cut - off ; table s6 ) .
most of them were involved in stress responses , such as ' response to stimulus ' , ' response to heat ' , ' response to abiotic stimulus ' , ' response to stress ' , and ' response to uv ' .
a large proportion ( 41.3 %) of differentially expressed genes was classified into functional category ' response to stimulus ' .
moreover , go terms ' response to auxin stimulus ' , ' response to gibberellin stimulus ' , ' response to reactive oxygen species ( ros )' , ' brassinosteroid metabolic process ' , and ' calcium - mediated signaling ' were also overrepresented .
several transcripts involved in hormone or ros homeostasis were also found to be differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress .
these results indicate ros , hormones , and calcium as signaling molecules may play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress .
less inhibition of photosynthesis in the cold - tolerant genotypes go term enrichment analysis showed that photosynthesis was significantly inhibited by cold stress , and more related genes were down - regulated in la4024 ( tables s5 and s7 ) .
the significant suppression of photosynthesis - related genes under cold stress has been observed in arabidopsis and barley [ 15 ] , [ 18 ] .
the down - regulated genes covered all the aspects of photosynthesis , including the light reactions , calvin cycle , and photorespiration ( figure 5a ; table s7 ) .
the suppression of the photosynthetic light reactions contained psi , psii , atp synthase , and electron carriers .
many transcripts involved in psii were strongly repressed in la4024 , and some were down - regulated by more than 5 - fold , such as sgn - u218907 , sgn - u218911 , sgn - u234083 , sgn - u212937 , and sgn - u218904 .
most of these genes encode chlorophyll a / b binding proteins .
in addition , some genes involved in photorespiration and calvin cyle were also severely suppressed in la4024 , such as sgn - u232245 , sgn - u212963 , sgn - u215203 , and sgn - u213321 ( table s7 ) .
a transcript , sgn - u225498 , encoding rubisco small subunit 3b was more strongly induced in the two tolerant genotypes ( figure s1 ) .
the expression of seven genes involved in photosynthesis was validated by qpcr .
as shown in figure 5b , nearly all of them were strongly down - regulated in la4024 .
among these , sgn - u231963 and sgn - u232245 coding for a ferredoxin - nadp (+) - oxidoreductase and a glycolate oxidase , respectively , were less severely suppressed in la1777 and la3969 than in la4024 ( p < 0.05 ) .
sgn - u218904 and sgn - u232496 coding for a chlorophyll a / b binding protein and a psii reaction center w protein , respectively , were less severely suppressed in la1777 than in la4024 ( p < 0.01 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0050785.g005 figure 5 comparison of the effects of cold stress on photosynthesis - related gene expression and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics among the three tomato genotypes .
( a ) differential expression of genes involved in photosynthesis among the three genotypes subjected to cold stress ( 4degreesc ) for 3 d. this figure was modified from the photosynthesis pathway obtained using mapman software [ 34 ] .
the expression images were generated using genesis software [ 35 ] .
the three color squares from left to right indicate the expression levels of one related gene in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively .
the color intensity represents gene expression value ( log2 ratio stress / control ) , as indicated by the color scale .
gray squares indicates the missing data .
more details are given in table s5 .
( b ) qpcr analysis of selected photosynthesis - related gene expression under cold stress .
leaf samples from control and cold - treated ( 3 d at 4degreesc ) plants were used for qpcr analysis .
ef1alpha expression was used as internal control .
the relative expression level is shown as log2 ratio ( cold stress / control ) .
data are presented as mean +/ - se of three independent biological replicates .
asterisks indicate a significant difference between tolerant and sensitive genotypes .
* , p < 0.05 ; ** , p < 0.01 , student 's t test .
( c ) comparison of the maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry ( fv / fm ) and the quantum yield of psii electron transport ( phipsii ) among the three genotypes during cold stress .
six - week - old seedlings were treated at 4degreesc for 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 d. measurements were performed on the third leaves of plants .
data are presented as mean +/ - se of six replicates .
asterisks indicate a significant difference between tolerant and sensitive genotypes .
* , p < 0.05 ; ** , p < 0.01 .
transcriptome analysis suggested that the psii was inhibited more severely in the sensitive genotype ( figure 5a ; table s7 ) .
to confirm this , the maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry ( fv / fm ) and the quantum yield of psii electron transport ( phipsii ) were measured .
as shown in figure 5c , all tomato genotypes displayed a time - dependent decline in fv / fm and phipsii under cold stress , but the decrease was greater in the sensitive genotype .
after 7 d of cold stress treatment , la1777 and la3969 showed significantly higher values of fv / fm and phipsii than la4024 .
previous study indicated that s. habrochaites showed less severe inhibition of photosynthesis than s. lycopersicum during chilling stress [ 4 ] .
these results demonstrate that photosynthesis ( especially psii ) is suppressed more severely in the cold - sensitive genotype than in the cold - tolerant genotype under cold stress .
differences in gene expression and enzyme activity related to ros between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress go term enrichment analysis showed that the biological process ' oxidation reduction ' was significantly suppressed in la4024 ( figure 4 ) , and the functional category ' response to ros' was significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( table s6 ) .
to further characterize the differences in ros - related gene expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes , cold - responsive genes related to ros were analyzed .
a total of 74 ros - related genes were regulated by cold stress , and eight of them were confirmed by qpcr ( table s8 ; figure s3a ) .
among these , seven showed significant differences in gene expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( table s8 ) .
both microarray and qpcr analysis showed that sgn - u215231 was more strongly induced by cold stress in la1777 and la3969 than in la4024 ( figures s1 and figure s3a ) .
sgn - u215231 encodes a peroxidase similar to the pepper peroxidase capo2 .
qpcr analysis showed that sgn - u215628 encoding an amine oxidase was more severely repressed by cold stress in la4024 than in la3969 and la1777 ( figure s3a ) .
both capo2 and amine oxidase are involved in ros generation [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] .
three glutathione s - transferase genes ( sgn - u213825 , sgn - u214482 , and sgn - u226166 ) were more strongly induced by cold stress in la1777 and la3969 than in la4024 ( table s8 ) .
for instance , sgn - u226166 was up - regulated by 2.26 - and 2.18 - fold in la1777 and la3969 , respectively , but it was down - regulated by 0.43 - fold in la4024 under cold stress .
previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of gsts in tobacco improved cold tolerance [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
the significantly higher expression of gsts in the two tolerant genotypes might have contributed to cold tolerance by reducing oxidative damage and regulating cellular redox homeostasis .
we further analyzed the activities of some antioxidant enzymes under cold stress , including apx , pod , cat , and sod .
after 3 d of cold treatment , apx activity was significantly lower in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( figure s3b ). by contrast , pod activity was significantly higher only at 3 d of cold treatment in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( figure s3c ) .
this is consistent with the expression pattern of peroxidase gene ( sgn - u215231 ) mentioned above .
cat activity was significantly decreased in la1777 than in la4024 after 5 d of cold treatment , but no significant difference was found between la396 and la4024 during cold stress ( figure s3d ) .
no significant difference in sod activity was found between tolerant and sensitive genotypes during cold stress ( figure s3e ) .
to check whether the changes in gene expression and enzyme activities would cause differences in ros accumulation between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , the presence of h2o2 and o2 - in the leaves of the three genotypes were detected with dab and nbt staining .
all three tomato genotypes exhibited a tendency of increased staining , indicating the accumulation of ros during cold stress .
but no remarkable difference between tolerant and sensitive genotypes was observed ( figures s3f and s3g ) .
ros have traditionally been regarded as toxic molecules .
however , recent studies indicated that ros play a key role in the complex signaling networks in plant [ 56 ] - [ 58 ] .
transcriptome analysis revealed that oxidative - mediated transcriptional regulatory network configures the early response mechanisms to chilling stress in japonica rice [ 17 ] .
thus , the accumulation of ros may not be the main reason that causes cellular damage under cold stress in tomato .
ros as signaling molecules may play a critical role in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress .
differentially expressed genes involved in hormone metabolism and signaling comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that a large number of genes related to abscisic acid ( aba ) , jasmonic acid ( ja ) , auxin , cytokinins ( cks ) , ethylene , gibberellin , and brassinolides were regulated by cold stress in tomato ( table s9 ) .
three hormone - related go biological processes were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , which are ' response to auxin stimulus ' , ' response to gibberellin stimulus ' , and ' brassinosteroid metabolic process' ( table s6 ) .
hormones as signaling molecules are supposed to play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress in tomato .
a total of 14 hormone - related genes were differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( table s9 ) .
among these , sgn - u214274 encoding a homologue of arabidopsis aba3 was more severely suppressed in the sensitive genotype , which was validated by qpcr ( figure s1 ; table s3 ) .
in arabidopsis , the aba - deficient mutant aba3 / los5 shows a significant reduction in the expression of cold stress - responsive genes and exhibits higher sensitivity to freezing stress [ 59 ] .
the significant suppression of this gene may influence the expression of many downstream cold - responsive genes in the sensitive genotype .
two auxin - related genes , sgn - u215655 and sgn - u215106 , were differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress .
sgn - u215655 encoding an auxin - responsive family protein was more strongly induced in la4024 .
its homologue in arabidopsis and peach was also found to be regulated by cold stress [ 60 ] .
the expression of sgn - u215106 was up - regulated by 2.25 - and 2.78 - fold in la1777 and la3969 , respectively , whereas only by 0.95 - fold in la4024 under cold stress ( figure s1 ) .
sgn - u215106 encodes an auxin - binding f - box protein similar to atskp2a .
overexpression of atskp2a increased tolerance to osmotic stress in arabidopsis [ 61 ] .
this gene was more strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes , suggesting its up - regulation may confer cold tolerance in tomato .
five genes involved in the ja biosynthesis pathway were differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( table s9 ) .
among these , two lipoxygenase genes ( sgn - u214851 and sgn - u234711 ) and two 12 - oxophytodienoate reductase genes ( aj242551 and sgn - u228308 ) were more severely repressed in la4024 .
however , sgn - u217795 encoding an allene oxide synthase was more strongly induced in la4024 as compared to la1777 and la3969 .
ja is essential for regulating the systemic defense response in tomato [ 62 ] .
the depression of ja biosynthesis would affect the expression of ja - responsive genes .
previous studies indicated that the expression of leucine aminopeptidase a1 ( lap - a1 ) , ja2 , pathogenesis - related proteins ( prs ) , and phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( pal ) were induced by ja [ 38 ] , [ 63 ] , [ 64 ] .
interestingly , we found ja2 ( sgn - u216055 ) , pr ( sgn - u215661 ) , pal1 ( sgn - u239712 ) , and lap - a1 ( sgn - u212650 ) were more strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( figure s1 ) .
ja may act as a positive regulator in response to cold stress in tomato .
both microarray and qpcr analysis showed significantly lower expression of sgn - u223622 in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( table s9 ) .
sgn - u223622 encodes a ck oxidase / dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the degradation of ck. the expression of ckxs was much lower in the arabidopsis ck - deficient ipt mutant and the mutant was more tolerant to salt and drought stress than the wild type [ 65 ] .
therefore , sgn - u223622 possibly plays a negative role in response to cold stress in tomato .
differentially expressed genes involved in calcium signaling go term enrichment analysis revealed that the biological process ' calcium - mediated signaling ' was significantly ( p < 0.05 , fdr as the cut - off ) enriched among the differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress ( table s6 ) .
a total of 30 , 24 , and 29 genes involved in calcium regulation were affected by cold stress in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively ( table s10 ) .
among them , seven genes were differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes. of these , sgn - u214767 , sgn - u220721 , sgn - u227216 , and sgn - u215654 were more strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( figure s1 ; table s10 ) .
the qpcr analysis showed that the expression of sgn - u227216 , a gene encoding calcium - binding protein , was significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one under cold stress ( p < 0.01 ; up - regulated by 7.16 - , 5.17 - , 2.41 - fold in la1777 , la3969 , and la4024 , respectively ) .
sgn - u214767 and sgn - u220721 encode calcium - binding proteins which are similar to arabidopsis tch2 and atcp1 , respectively .
previous studies indicated that tch2 and atcp1 were induced by cold stress in arabidopsis [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] .
sgn - u215654 encodes a putative calmodulin .
calcium - binding proteins and calmodulin are ca2 + sensors that sense changes in cellular ca2 + and regulate the expression of downstream genes [ 68 ] .
the up - regulation of these four ca2 + sensors was significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes under cold stress , suggesting these might act as positive regulators in tolerance to cold stress in tomato .
three genes were more strongly induced in the sensitive genotype .
both sgn - u221694 and sgn - u231357 encode sodium / calcium exchanger family proteins , and sgn - u214886 encodes a calmodulin - dependent protein kinase , similar to ntcpk4 .
in tobacco , ntcpk4 expression was induced by salt stress and gibberellin [ 69 ] .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0050785.g006 figure 6 hypothetical working model of cold tolerance in tomato mediated by the introgressed chromosomal segment of s. habrochaites la1777 .
ros , calcium , and hormones as signaling molecules may play critical roles in tomato adaptation to cold stress .
the modulation of these signaling pathways then activated transcription regulation .
the differential expression of transcription factors then caused many transcripts modified between tolerant and sensitive genotypes , such as functional proteins , post - translational modification proteins , and genes associated with physiological and metabolic processes , such as photosynthesis , ros production or scavenging system , and metabolic enzymes .
the modulation of the expression of genes associated with post - translational modifications , ros , and hormones then feedback to fine - tune transcription factors , ros , and hormone signaling networks .
these specific modifications make la3969 be close to its donor parent la1777 , and both showed more cold tolerant than the recurrent parent la4024 .

differentially expressed transcription factors transcription factors ( tfs ) play crucial roles in regulating the expression of stress - responsive genes under biotic and abiotic stresses .
a larger number of tfs were regulated by cold stress at least in one tomato genotype .
representative zf families included myb , nac , wrky , ap2 / erebp , hsf ( heat shock factor ) , bhlh , bzip , and zinc finger ( figure s4 ) .
among these , ten zfs were specifically expressed in the two tolerant genotypes under cold stress ( figure s4a ) .
sixteen tfs were regulated by cold stress exclusively in la4024 , and most of them were down - regulated ( figure s4b ) .
a total of 96 tfs were regulated by cold stress common to all three genotypes .
nearly half of them belong to nac , wrky , and zinc finger zf superfamilies ( figure s4c ) .
nac , wrky and zinc finger tfs play important roles in response to abiotic stress by controlling stress - responsive gene expression and / or modifying other signaling and regulatory networks [ 70 ] - [ 72 ] .
so many nac , wrky , and zinc finger tfs were induced in all three genotypes , depicting the development of complex and highly interconnected regulatory networks in response to cold stress in tomato .
all cold - responsive genes , belonging to nac , wrky , ap2 / erebp , and hsf gene families , were enhanced in all three genotypes .
the up - regulation of two wrkys ( sgn - u215123 and sgn - u213637 ) was confirmed by qpcr ( table s3 ) .
many tomato wrky tfs were also found to be induced by salt or drought stress [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
therefore , the up - regulation of wrky tfs may be a general stress response common to various abiotic stresses in tomato .
among these cold - responsive tfs , eight showed significant changes in transcript abundance between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , including sgn - u221957 , sgn - u224924 , sgn - u218469 , sgn - u234004 , sgn - u215123 , sgn - u216055 , sgn - u216769 , and sgn - u215577 ( figure s4 ) .
sgn - u221957 and sgn - u224924 encode hsfs .
the expression of sgn - u221957 was down - regulated by 2.58 - fold in la4024 , whereas it was slightly up - regulated in la1777 and la3969 ( 0.22 - and 0.72 - fold , respectively ) under cold stress .
sgn - u224924 was more strongly up - regulated by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes than the sensitive one ( figure s1 ) .
hsfs play a central role in regulating the expression of heat shock proteins ( hsps ) in response to heat and other stress stimuli [ 73 ] .
we found that the expression of two hsps ( sgn - u212639 and sgn - u212643 ) was significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one under cold stress ( figure s1 ) .
sgn - u216769 ( sap11 ) encoding an a20 / an1 zinc finger protein that has been found to be induced by cold stress in tomato [ 47 ] .
sgn - u234004 and sgn - u218469 encode mybs similar to arabidopsis myb15 and myb107 .
myb15 is a negative regulator of cold tolerance in arabidopsis [ 42 ] .
these two mybs were more strongly induced in the sensitive genotype adumbrating them as negative regulators of cold tolerance in tomato .
sgn - u215577 , encoding a homologue of arabidopsis aspg1 ( aspartic protease in guard cell 1 ) , was more severely suppressed by cold stress in la4024 .
overexpression of the aspg1 gene conferred drought avoidance in arabidopsis by up - regulating the expression of drought - and / or aba - inducible genes , such as kin1 , kin2 , rab18 , and rd26 [ 74 ] .
kin1 , kin2 , and rab18 are also cold - inducible genes [ 75 ] - [ 77 ] .
these results suggest that the aspg1 gene may also play a positive role in plant adaptation to cold stress by activating the downstream stress - responsive genes .
differentially expressed genes involved in post - translational modifications post - translational modifications play important roles in rapid and fine - tuned regulation of transcription factors under abiotic stress [ 78 ] .
a total of 171 genes associated with post - translational modifications were regulated by cold stress in at least one tomato genotype ( table s11 ) .
among these , six showed significant differences in expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , including sgn - u215679 , sgn - u212650 , sgn - u229977 , sgn - u234375 , sgn - u220612 , and sgn - u215106 ( figure s1 ; table s11 ) .
sgn - u220612 and sgn - u234375 encoding ring - h2 - type zinc - finger proteins similar to arabidopsis xerico were more strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one ( table s11 ) .
overexpression of xerico enhances drought tolerance by accumulating more aba in arabidopsis [ 79 ] .
the significantly higher up - regulation of these two unigenes in the two tolerant genotypes suggested that they might act as positive regulators in the cold stress response in tomato .
another gene , sgn - u215106 , encodes a homologue of arabidopsis skp2a .
skp2a is an auxin - binding f - box protein , and its overexpression in transgenic arabidopsis confers tolerance to osmotic stress [ 61 ] .
f - box proteins are part of the ubiquitin ligase scf complex that catalyzes the degradation of the aux / iaa proteins through ubiquitination pathway [ 80 ] .
previous studies indicated that auxin regulates transcription by promoting the degradation of the aux / iaa proteins [ 81 ] .
the remarkable increase in the expression of this gene in the two tolerant genotypes may activate the auxin - mediated transcription under cold stress .
interestingly , we found the go term ' response to auxin ' was significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress .
these results suggested a potential link between cold and auxin signaling pathways .
biochemical pathways significantly altered between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress to identify the significantly altered biochemical pathways between cold - tolerant and - sensitive tomato genotypes under cold stress , the 92 differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the plant metgenmap system [ 33 ] .
seven biochemical pathways varied significantly between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress , including jasmonic acid biosynthesis , brassinosteroid metabolic process , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , starch degradation , leucine biosynthesis , calvin cycle , and removal of superoxide radicals ( table 2 ) .
the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and calvin cycle pathways were significantly enhanced in the two tolerant genotypes under cold stress compared with the sensitive one .
three udp - glucosyltransferase genes involved in brassinosteroid metabolic process were more strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one .
some genes from udp - glucosyltransferase family genes have been found to be regulated by abiotic and / or biotic stresses in arabidopsis [ 82 ] .
sgn - u213712 , encoding a beta - amylase involved in starch degradation , was more severely suppressed in the sensitive genotype .
previous studies indicate that the increase in beta - amylase activity is correlated with maltose accumulation which contributes to the protection of the psii photochemical efficiency , proteins , and membranes during freezing stress [ 83 ] , [ 84 ] .
therefore , the significant repression of this beta - amylase gene may decrease maltose content and reduce psii photochemical efficiency in the cold - sensitive genotype under cold stress .
in agreement with this , we found that the psii photochemical efficiency was repressed more severely in la4024 after 7 d of cold stress treatment ( figure 5c ) .
conclusions in this study , a total of 93 s. habrochaites la1777 ils , together with their donor ( s. habrochaites la1777 ) and recurrent ( s. lycopersicum la4024 ) parent were evaluated for cold tolerance at the seedling stage .
the il la3969 and its donor parent were found to be more cold tolerant than the recurrent parent during cold stress ( figures 1a to 1e ) .
to better understand the mechanisms of cold tolerance in tomato , differences in stress - related physiological indicators and global gene expression between cold - tolerant ( la3969 and la1777 ) and - sensitive ( la4024 ) genotypes under cold stress were investigated .
during cold stress , the two tolerant genotypes showed less severe membrane damage , less photoinhibition of psii , and lower apx activities than the sensitive genotype .
comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 92 genes were differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes after 3 d of cold stress ( 4degreesc ) .
a total of 80 genes with significant differences in expression between s. habrochaites and s. lycopersicum were mapped to the introgressed chromosomal regions of the 22 selected cold - tolerant ils and / or cold tolerance qtls reported previously in s. habrochaites [ 7 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
according to chromosomal location , expression differences , and gene annotation , 30 genes that are most likely to confer cold tolerance in s. habrochaites were identified ( table 1 ) .
ros , calcium , and hormones as signaling molecules may play critical roles in tomato adaptation to cold stress .
the modulation of these signaling pathways could activate directly stress response - related genes or interact directly / indirectly with several other signaling networks to regulate transcription .
the activated tfs ( e.g. , mybs , hsfs , wrkys , nacs , and zinc fingers ) then caused differential expression of many transcripts among tolerant and sensitive genotypes , such as functional proteins ( e.g. , hsps , prs , and dehydrin ) , post - translational modification proteins ( e.g. , skp2a , lap - a1 , and xericos ) , and genes associated with physiological and metabolic processes , such as photosynthesis ( e.g. , fnr , goxs , and rbcs3b ) , ros production or scavenging system ( e.g. , pods , ao , and gsts ) , hormone biosynthesis and metabolism ( aba3 , loxs , and ugts ) , and other metabolic enzymes ( e.g. , pal and bam ) .
these specific modifications make la1777 and la3969 more cold tolerant than la4024 , by reducing cell membrane damage and photoinhibition , regulating metabolism , and maintaining hormone and ros homeostasis .
based on our results , we summarized a hypothetical working model for the potential roles of this introgressed chromosomal segment from s. habrochaites la1777 in the regulation of cold stress tolerance ( figure 6 ) .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report comparing the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress in tomato .
the results not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance in tomato , but also provide potential candidate genes for genetic improvement of the cultivated tomato .

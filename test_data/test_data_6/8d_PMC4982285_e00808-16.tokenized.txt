the cellulose producer and model organism used for the study of cellulose biosynthesis , gluconacetobacter hansenii ay201 , is a variant of g. hansenii atcc 23769 .
we report here the complete nucleotide sequence of g. hansenii ay201 , information which may be utilized to further the research into understanding the genes necessary for cellulose biosynthesis .
cover - datejuly / august 2016 genome announcement the genus gluconacetobacter contains several strains of gram - negative bacteria that are particularly efficient producers of pure , highly crystalline cellulose , one of which is gluconacetobacter hansenii , formerly known as acetobacter xylinum .
the export of this crystalline cellulose into the culture medium results in a membrane located at the air - liquid interface called bacterial cellulose ( bc ) ( 1 - 3 ) .
because of its distinctive properties , bc is particularly well suited for medical , industrial , and commercial applications due to its ultrafine reticulated structure , high crystallinity , great mechanical strength , high water - holding capacity , moldability during formation , and biocompatibility ( 4 - 7 ) .
the results presented in this report will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of bacterial cellulose biosynthesis and add to the study of the gluconacetobacter genus. g. hansenii ay201 ( atcc 23769 ) was developed from an isolate of g. hansenii atcc 23796 that exhibited non - wild - type pellicle and colony morphology ( unpublished data ) .
it is an important model organism for the study of cellulose biosynthesis ( 8 - 10 ) .
however , until now , its genome had not been available for study .
the dna of g. hansenii ay201 was extracted and subjected to sequencing using an illumina hiseq 2000 pe100 system ( university of texas at austin , icmb core facility ) .
the reads were assembled into contigs using velvet version 1 / 2 / 02 ( 11 ) and downloaded into geneious version 8.1.2 , which revealed that it is approximately 3.35 mbp in size with a gc content of 55.9 % ( 12 ) ; a total of 6,443 open reading frames were predicted using glimmer ( 13 ) .
preliminary annotation data on contigs containing cellulose synthase genes were determined .
the complete annotation of the full genome is in progress .
a homology comparison to g. hansenii atcc 23769 ( genbank accession no .
ab091060 ) was performed and resulted in a 95 % identity to g. hansenii ay201 .
previous studies have determined that g. hansenii ay201 contains at least two similar but nonidentical cellulose synthesizing regions , the acsabcd operon and the acsaii coding region ( 9 , 10 ) .
investigations into the genome of g. hansenii atcc 23769 indicated that the organism contains a total of three separate coding regions for cellulose biosynthesis : acsabcd , acsaii , and acsabc ( 9 ) .
a homology comparison of the shared cellulose - synthesizing regions revealed a sequence identity of 100 % .
the acsabcd operon is flanked by genes coding for proteins which have been determined to be essential for proper cellulose biosynthesis to occur : cmcax , ccpax , and bglax ( 14 - 17 ) .
the genes flanking the acsabcd operon also shared 100 % sequence identity to g. hansenii atcc 23769 .
since g. hansenii ay201 is a model organism for genetic study , further investigations into both cellulose synthase - coding regions and why an isolate of g. hansenii atcc 23769 lost a third may aid in providing a better understanding of the mechanisms necessary for cellulose biosynthesis to occur .

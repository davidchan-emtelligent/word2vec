filgap , a rho gtpase - activating protein ( gap ) , acts as a mediator of rho / rock ( rho - associated protein kinase ) - dependent amoeboid movement , and its knockdown results in rac - driven mesenchymal morphology .
herein , we focus on the possible roles of filgap expression in normal and malignant lymphocytes .
eighty - three cases of follicular lymphoma ( fl ) , 84 of diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) , and 25 of peripheral t - cell lymphoma ( ptcl ) , as well as 10 of normal lymph nodes , were immunohistochemically investigated .
in normal lymph nodes , filgap immunoreactivity was significantly higher in lymphocytes in the mantle zone as compared to those in the germinal center and paracortical areas .
in contrast , the expression levels of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear rac1 were significantly lower in the germinal center as compared to paracortical regions , suggesting that changes in the filgap / rac axis may occur in b - cell lineages .
in malignant lymphomas , filgap expression was significantly higher in b - cell lymphomas than ptcl , and the immunohistochemical scores were positively correlated with cytoplasmic rac1 scores in fl and dlbcl , but not in ptcl .
patients with fl and germinal center b - cell - like ( gcb ) - type dlbcl showing high filgap scores had poor overall survival rates as compared to the low - score patients .
moreover , multivariate cox regression analysis showed that a high filgap score was a significant and independent unfavorable prognostic factor in fl , but not in dlbcl .
in conclusion , filgap may contribute to change in cell motility of b - lymphocytes .
in addition , its expression appears to be useful for predicting the behavior of b - cell lymphoma , in particular fl. b - lymphocyte filgap follicular lymphoma prognosis rac introduction follicular lymphoma ( fl ) is the most common type of indolent b - cell lymphoma , accounting for 10 - 20 % of all malignant lymphomas ( mls ) 1 .
fl is characterized by frequent relapses and progression to treatment - resistant disease or transformation to high - grade feature , despite initial responsiveness to chemotherapy or radiotherapy 2,3 .
for risk assessment , the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index ( flipi ) has been developed on the basis of five variables , including age , ann arbor stage , hemoglobin levels , number of nodal site areas , and serum low - density lipoprotein ( ldh ) 4 , in contrast to the international prognostic index ( ipi ) for aggressive mls 5 .
the low - , intermediate - , and high - risk groups are identified with 10 - year overall survival ( os ) rates of 71 % , 51 % , and 36 % , respectively 6 .
thus , clinical data represent the major source of prognostic information , but many biological factors are not yet clinically validated or easily assessable .
abnormal cell migration and invasion are characteristics of malignant cells , being closely associated with tumor progression .
members of the rho gtpase family , including rhoa , rac , and cdc42 , are key regulators of cell migration by modulating mesenchymal and amoeboid motility 7,8 .
amoeboid movement is most commonly observed in mls and small cell lung carcinomas , allowing tumor cells to undergo early detachment and metastatic spread from primary tumors .
in contrast , cells with mesenchymal migration , such as fibrosarcomas and glioblastomas , have a fibroblast - like spindle - shaped morphology that is dependent on integrin - mediated adhesion dynamics 9 .
filgap is a rho gtpase - activating protein ( gap ) and binds to the actin filament cross - linking protein filamin a ( flna ) 10 - 12 .
knockdown of endogenous filgap induces a rac - driven elongated mesenchymal morphology , while its overexpression results in membrane blebbing and a rounded amoeboid morphology , indicating that filgap mediates antagonism between rac and rho that suppresses cell protrusion and promotes cell contraction 13,14 .
however , little is known about possible roles of filgap in mls .
in this study , we investigated the expression of filgap , with reference to the status of its associated molecules , including flna , integrin beta2 , epithelial cell transforming factor 2 ( ect2 ) , and rac1 , in fl , diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) , and peripheral t - cell lymphoma ( ptcl ) .
in addition , we also examined whether filgap is suitable as an independent prognostic factor of mls .
materials and methods clinical cases a total of 192 cases of mls , including 83 of fl , 84 of dlbcl , and 25 of ptcl newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2012 in kitasato university hospital , were selected for this retrospective study .
all tumor tissues were obtained from each patient by lymph node biopsy .
pathological diagnosis was made according to the criteria of the world health organization classification ( 2008 ) 1 .
all patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy such as chop or chop - like regimes , with or without rituximab .
all clinical and laboratory data , along with the follow - up data , were obtained from the hospital 's medical records and patient charts and then flipi for fl and ipl for dlbcl were evaluated ( table s1 ) .
ten biopsy specimens of non - neoplastic lymph nodes were also investigated .
all tissues were routinely fixed in 10 % formalin and processed for embedding in paraffin wax .
in addition , a variety of organ tissues obtained from five autopsy cases were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) and western blot assays .
approval for this study was given by the ethics committee of the kitasato university school of medicine ( b13 - 29 ) .
immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) was performed using a combination of microwave oven heating and polymer immunocomplex ( envision , dako , glostrup , denmark ) methods , with the following primary antibodies : cd3 , cd5 , cd10 , cd20 , cd79a , bcl2 , bcl6 , and mum1 , all from dako .
both flna and integrin beta2 were from millipore ( billerica , ma ) .
ect2 and rac 1 were from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca ) and bd bioscience ( san jose , ca ) , respectively .
rabbit polyclonal anti - filgap antibody was developed as described previously 10 .
to evaluate the specificity of the filgap antibody in ihc analysis , absorption assay was performed , as described previously 15 .
briefly , the primary antibody was incubated for 1 h with excess purified filgap antigen , and then ihc analysis was carried out .
for evaluation of the ihc findings , cases were considered as positive when more than 30 % of tumor cells were stained , on the basis of the methods reported by hans et al .
16. with respect to the immunophenotype of dlbcl , cases positive for cd10 and bcl6 and negative for mum1 were regarded as having a germinal center - like ( gcb ) phenotype and others as non - gcb type ( table s1 ) , as described by hans et al .
16. immunoreactivity scores for filgap , flna , integrin beta2 , ect2 , and cytoplasmic rac 1 were also calculated by multiplying the percentage of immunopositive cells by the immunointensity values , as described previously 17 .
perinuclear rac1 grade was subdivided into four categories as follows : 0 , negative ; 1 , weak immunointensity ; 2 , moderate ; and 3 , strong .
the perinuclear immunointensity of lymphocytes at paracortical regions , used as internal controls , was designated as strong .
in addition , perinuclear rac1 score was calculated by multiplying the percentage of perinuclear immunopositive cells by the perinuclear grade .
in situ hybridization riboprobes for filgap containing nucleotides 1027 to 1726 of the filgap gene were generated by in vitro transcription , using full length filgap cdna 10 , and in situ hybridization ( ish ) assays were performed using the genpoint tyramide signal amplification system ( dako ) , as described previously 18 .
cases with more than 10 % cells positive for ish signals were defined as positive .
rt - pcr cdna was synthesized from 2 mug of total rna and amplification was carried out using specific forward primers for the filgap gene as follows : variant ( v ) 1 primer located in exon 3 : 5 ' - atccctgcaatgaagagaaccc - 3 ' , v2 in exon 6 : 5 ' - tacgatgcctgaagaccggaat - 3 ' , and v3 in exon 4 : 5 ' - tgcgtagaccagaccagtgac - 3 ' .
common reverse primer located in exon 7 was 5 ' - gagccagacggttcccatatc - 3 ' ( fig. 2a ) .
primers for the gapdh gene were also applied as internal control , as described previously 17 .
western blot assays total cellular proteins were harvested using 2x laemmli sample buffer .
aliquots of the proteins were resolved by sds - page ( sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) , transferred to membranes , and probed with primary antibodies , coupled with the ecl detection system ( amersham pharmacia biotechnology , tokyo , japan ) .
statistics comparative data were analyzed using the mann - whitney u test and the pearson 's correlation coefficient .
os was calculated as the time between onset and death or the date of the last follow - up evaluation .
progression - free survival ( pfs ) was also examined from the onset of treatment until relapse , disease progression , or last follow - up evaluation .
os and pfs were estimated using the kaplan - meier methods , and the statistical comparisons were made using the log - rank test .
univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the cox proportional hazards regression model .
the cut - off for statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 .
results immunohistochemical specificity of the anti - filgap antibody to examine the specificity of the anti - filgap antibody on formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded sections , absorption assay was performed using normal human kidney tissues which have the highest expression in podocytes 10,19 .
conventional ihc assay revealed distinct cytoplasmic filgap immunoreaction in both podocytes and tubules , but such immunoreactivity was decreased and / or disappeared by pretreatment with excess filgap antigen ( fig. 1 ) .

filgap expression in normal human tissues several filgap isoforms produced by alternative splicing are ubiquitously expressed in most cells and tissues 10,20,21 .
to examine the expression patterns of filgap isoforms in a variety of human tissues , rt - pcr and western blot assays were carried out .
as shown in figure 2a , full length ( v1 ) and shorter mrna variants lacking the n - terminal pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain ( v2 and v3 ) were detected in all tissues investigated .
in contrast , the western blot results demonstrated the presence of various protein isoforms at varying expression levels that diverge from the rt - pcr findings ( fig. 2b ). by ihc analyses , higher levels of filgap immunoreactivity were observed in lymphocytes in the spleen ( fig. 2c ) , as well as podocytes and tubules in the kidney ( fig. 1 ) .

representative ihc findings for filgap , flna , integrin beta2 , ect2 , and rac1 in normal lymph nodes are illustrated in figure 3a .
immunopositivity for these molecules was mainly observed in cytoplasmic compartments of lymphocytes .
perinuclear rac1 immunoreactivity was also observed in lymphocytes with relatively intense cytoplasmic staining , and was found to have significant positive correlation with cytoplasmic rac1 status ( fig. s1a and table s2 ) .
filgap scores were significantly higher in the mantle zone as compared to those in the germinal center and paracortical regions .
flna scores showed stepwise increases from the germinal center , through the mantle , to the paracortical region .
ect2 scores were significantly higher in the germinal center as compared to those in the mantle zone , in contrast to the significantly higher integrin beta2 and cytoplasmic and perinuclear rac1 scores in the paracortical region ( figs.3b and s1a ) .

overall , average filgap scores were negatively correlated with those for integrin beta2 , ect2 , and cytoplasmic rac1 , as well as perinuclear rac1 grades ( r = - 0.38 , p = 0.01 ) .
cytoplasmic rac1 scores were also positively related to flna and integrin beta2 scores. by evaluating the immunostaining according to the two regions , follicles and paracortex , filgap scores showed strong positive correlation with flna scores in both categories , in contrast to a lack of association with cytoplasmic rac1 scores ( table1 ) .

the immunoreaction patterns of these markers were similar to those in normal lymphocytes .
perinuclear rac1 immunoreactivity was also observed frequently in all ml categories , and cytoplasmic rac1 scores were found to be significantly correlated with both perinuclear rac1 grades and scores ( fig. s1b and table s2 ) .
in 10 cases of fl and 9 of dlbcl , positivity for filgap mrna signals as detected by ish assay was significantly associated with the immunoreactivity in most cases ( fig. 4b ) , indicating that its expression may be mainly regulated at the transcriptional level .

average filgap scores were significantly higher in b - cell lymphomas than those in ptcl , while flna , integrin beta2 , and ect2 scores were significantly higher in ptcl than those in fl. there were no significant differences in cytoplasmic rac1 scores among any categories ( fig. 4c ) .
as shown in table2 , filgap scores were positively correlated with cytoplasmic rac1 scores in both fl and dlbcl , along with significantly positive correlation with perinuclear rac1 grade ( r = 0.47 , p = 0.02 ) in the former .
cytoplasmic rac1 scores were also positively correlated with flna scores in fl and gcb - type dlbcl , and negatively to ect2 scores in ptcl .
in addition , the filgap score was significantly higher ( p < 0.01 ) in fl than that in normal b - lymphocytes located at the germinal center , while such findings were not observed for the cytoplasmic rac1 score ( data not shown ) .

associations of filgap expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis in mls to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of filgap expression , filgap scores were divided into two categories ( high and low ) on the basis of the mean + sd values ( 9 , 9 , 11 , and 3 in fl , gcb - type dlbcl , non - gcb - type dlbcl , and tcl , respectively ) as the cut - off .
there were no significant differences in age , sex , clinical stage , flipi or ipi category , or nuclear grade between low and high filgap score groups in any categories ( table s3 ) .
no differences in the regimens and courses of chemotherapy were also evident between the two groups ( table s3 ) .
kaplan - meier curves for survival rates with respect to the filgap expression status are shown in figure 5 .
both stage i - iv and iii / iv patients with fl who displayed high filgap scores had poorer os rates as compared to the low filgap score patients .
similar associations were also observed in gcb , but not non - gcb type , dlbcl , although the difference did not reach significance in patients with stage iii / iv disease , probably due to the relatively small number of cases investigated .
there were no significant differences in both 2 and 5 year pfs rates between low - and high - filgap score patients with fl or dlbcl ( fig. s2 ) .
no significant differences in os rates between low and high scores of integrin beta2 , ect2 , and cytoplasmic rac1 were evident in stage i - iv patients of fl when cases were subdivided on the basis of the mean + sd values ( fig. s3 ) .

multivariate cox regression analysis showed that filgap score was a significant and independent prognostic factor for stage i - iv , but not iii / iv , fl ( table4 ) .
such associations were not observed for ptcl ( data not shown ) .

discussion this study clearly provided evidence that cytoplasmic rac1 immunoreactivity was frequently observed in normal and malignant lymphocytes .
in addition , the perinuclear staining appeared to be relatively common in such cells , with significant association between perinuclear and cytoplasmic rac1 status .
interestingly , activated rac1 has been reported to relocalize to the plasma membrane and perinuclear vesicles 22 - 24 .
given that , rac1 protein levels are posttranscriptionally regulated either by an increase in rna stability , translation efficiency , and / or protein stability in glioblastomas 24 , it appears that subcellular localization of rac1 may also be an important factor for determination of its functional status .
consistent with the present data , a rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that filgap is expressed ubiquitously in most cells and tissues , with the highest expression in kidney , particularly in podocytes 10,19 .
our findings also demonstrated significantly higher filgap expression in lymphocytes in the mantle zone as compared to those in the germinal center and paracortical areas , and were positively correlated with that of flna , as well as perinuclear rac1 status , but negatively to that of ect2 .
the interaction of filgap with flna emerges as a key factor in maintaining low levels of active rac in mechanically challenged cells 25 , while ect2 is capable of mediating gtp exchange on rac1 during mesenchymal migration and invasion 26 .
given the evidence for a close association between decreased filgap expression and induction of amoeboid - mesenchymal transition ( amt ) 13,27 , it is possible that amt - like features may occur in b - cell lineages through alteration in the rac1 / filgap axis in the lymph nodes , particularly in the follicular region .
in fact , elongated and enlarged lymphocytes are frequently observed in the germinal center area , in contrast to the presence of small round cells in the mantle zone .
integrins form an essential mechanical linkage between extracellular and intracellular environments , with beta - integrin tails connecting to the actin cytoskeleton by binding directly to flna 9 .
mechanical strain increases beta - integrin binding to flna , whereas it causes filgap to dissociate from flna 28 .
in general , amoeboid tumor cells have a low degree of adhesiveness for collagens , due to their low integrin expression .
in addition , lymphocytes and leukocytes are considered to be completely or partially independent on the integrin - mediated adhesion system for cell migration 9 .
our results showed that the filgap score was negatively correlated with integrin beta2 status in normal lymph nodes , with the exception of the paracortical region .
in addition , a lack of such association was also evident in all of the ml categories , indicating that integrin beta2 - related signaling may have a relatively minor role in the filgap - flna - actin network in normal and malignant lymphoid tissues .
an interesting finding in this study was that three alternative splicing variants of the filgap mrna were detected in all human tissues investigated , in contrast to the variable expression levels of the protein isoforms , which suggests posttranslational modification of the filgap protein .
in fact , it was demonstrated that the short filgap splice isoform ( p73rhogap2 / rc - gap72 ) was expressed in only vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells , while its mrna was frequently detected in a variety of tissues 21,29 .
in addition , the shorter isoforms lacking functional ph domain could influence cell motility at the level of phosphoinositide metabolism , since the domains are strongly similar to those of akt , cytohesin , and grp1 ( general receptor for phosphoinositides - 1 ) 30 .
it was recently shown that filgap is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to activated small gtp - binding protein arf6 through the ph domain 31 .
an unexpected finding in this study was that filgap and / or flna scores were positively correlated with cytoplasmic rac1 scores in b - cell lymphomas , which is inconsistent with idea that the filgap / flna system suppresses rac1 activity 9 - 11 .
although we are presently unable to provide an appropriate explanation for this observation , it appears that the regulatory mechanism for rac1 / filgap / flna axis may be very complex in b - cell lymphomas .
since our findings demonstrated significantly higher filgap expression in fl as compared to that in the b - lymphocytes located at the germinal center region , in contrast to no changes in rac1 expression , it is possible that increased expression of filgap relative to rac1 may be due to activation of filgap / flna system in fl. this complexity is also supported by the evidence that rac1 - gtp binds to the ph domain of dbs , a rhoa gef ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) , and stimulates its catalytic activity , leading to rhoa activation in certain cell types 32 - 34 .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first immunohistochemical analysis of filgap expression in mls to delineate its relationship with prognosis .
although there were no associations between several clinicopathological factors and filgap expression , the os of stage i - iv and / or iii / iv patients with fl or gcb - type dlbcl showing high filgap scores were significantly poorer than that of filgap - negative tumors according to the kaplan - meier survival curves .
moreover , filgap expression was shown as an independent prognostic factor for fl , but not dlbcl , by cox regression analysis , suggesting that filgap - positive fl may constitute the unique subtype with aggressive clinical course .
it is likely that high filgap expression causes establishment and maintenance of amoeboid features in lymphoma cells , which induce adaptation of their shapes to squeeze through pores in the extracellular matrix , resulting in the accelerated progression and the extensive dissemination .
further studies to clarify these points are clearly warranted .
in conclusion , the present study clearly provided evidence that filgap is frequently expressed in b - lymphocytes .
moreover , filgap appears to be useful for predicting the behavior of b - cell lymphomas , in particular fl. this study was supported by a grant from jsps kakenhi grant number 23590415 .

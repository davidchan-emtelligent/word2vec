introduction molar incisor hypomineralization ( mih ) is a frequently noticed developmental defect found mainly in molars and incisors .
molar incisor hypomineralization is defined as the developmentally derived dental defect that involves hypomineralization of one to four permanent molars , frequently associated with similarly affected permanent incisors.1 the european academy of pediatric dentistry congress 2000 reported mih with names , such as condition hypomineralized first permanent molar ( fpm ) , 2 idiopathic hypomineralization in fpm , cheese molar,3 and nonfluoride hypomineralization in fpm.4 molar incisor hypomineralization clinical appearance may vary from white to yellow opacities to soft and porous enamel .
the porous enamel subjected to masticatory stress leads to posteruptive breakdown of enamel , making tooth susceptible to thermal and cold stimuli .
the various etiological factors for mih depend on the prenatal , perinatal , and postnatal conditions of a child .
the ameloblast during its secretory phase is sensitive to hypoxic conditions and temperature variation .
any disturbance during enamel formation leads to severe hypomineralization at the cusps of an affected tooth , with a well - defined border between the hypomineralized and normal enamel at the cervical third.5 molar incisor hypomineralization is an important clinical problem of concern to a pediatric dentist due to its challenging management .
the affected tooth are prone to dental caries with the lapse of time ; more complex restorations in cooperative child and repeated breakdown of tooth and restoration may further aggravate the problem .
the purpose of the present study is to know the prevalence of mih in children , to determine the possible etiological factors , and to compare the obtained data with its prevalence in other countries .
materials and methods study population in the present study , a total of 1,369 children were examined in the age group of 8 to 12 years .
the level of fluoride in the drinking water was optimal ( 0.7 - 1 ppm ) .
the children with generalized hypoplastic / hypomineral - ized defects , such as amelogenesis imperfecta and those suffering from any chronic illness were excluded from the present study .
selection criteria all the children who participated in the present study were instructed to brush prior to the clinical examination .
the status of permanent incisors and molars was evaluated and recorded , according to the judgment criteria.6 all the children diagnosed with mih were reexamined by a second investigator to rule out any discrepancy regarding perception of judgment criteria .
the entire indexed tooth was kept wet while examination to rule out opacities due to excessive drying , and the size of lesion was not taken into consideration .
a set of questionnaires was given to the parents / guardian accompanying the 191 diagnosed children .
the questionnaire contained a detailed history of mothers' pregnancy , time of birth of child , and postnatal history of the child .
molar incisor hypomineralization lesions were divided into three categories based on the severity of lesion , viz. , opacities , posteruptive breakdown , and atypical restoration .
statistical analysis all the analyses were carried out using statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) 16.0 version ( chicago , inc. , usa ) .
chi - square / fisher exact test was used to compare the dichotomous variables .
the relative risk ( rr ) with its 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) was calculated to find the risk of mih with gender distribution , aliments , such as jaundice , chest and ear infections , and type of delivery .
the p - value < 0.05 was considered as significant .

data of 191 children diagnosed with mih were statistically analyzed .
the interexaminer agreement was good ( kappa = 0.872 ) .
a total of 48.2 % male and 51.8 % female children were diagnosed with mih with mean age 10.25 +/ - 1.25 ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) ( table 1 ) .
distribution of the subjects by age and gender is presented in graph 1 .
a total of 125 reported with a history of pre - and postnatal infection / antibiotic treatment .
based on the questionnaire , a correlation was established between probable etiology and occurrence of mih .
vitamin a deficiency and ear infection in early childhood showed a marked and statistically significant correlation with mih ( p - value 0.03 and 0.04 respectively ) ( table 2 ) .
prevalence of hypomineralized lesions was assessed ; the majority of children were unaffected , whereas 191 ( 13.95 %) had either molar / incisor or both affected with mih .
the children diagnosed were divided into three categories on the basis of tooth affected , viz. , molars , molars with incisors , and incisors with opacities .
the rr with its 95 % ci was calculated to find the risk in molars or incisors or both and its distribution with gender ( tables 3 and 4 ) and type of delivery ( tables 5 and 6 ) .
discussion molar incisor hypomineralization is a common finding across the globe with a range of prevalence of 2 to 25 %. 78 this difference may be due to variation in ethnicity , sample size , and age of population in the preceding studies .
the present study showed a prevalence of 13.9 % in a group of indian children , which is more than the prevalence reported in germany , libya , and greece ( table 7 ) .
no significant difference was found between male and female children diagnosed with mih , which is in agreement with other prevalence studies.7 however , female population showed a slightly high incidence of mih as compared with male children , which is in agreement with the preceding studies.79 the prevalence of mih is more severe in molars as compared with incisors .
mandibular molars and maxillary incisors are the commonly involved tooth , which is in concurrence with other preceding studies.10 in the present study , a strong correlation of mih was observed with prenatal , perinatal , and postnatal infection / disorder in the children .
a total of 125 of 191 children diagnosed with mih had a history of postnatal infections , such as jaundice , chicken pox , cardiac disorder , kidney disorder , chest infection , vitamin a deficiency , high fever , long - term breastfeeding , and intake of antibiotics for long duration .
among all the aliments , chicken pox , vitamin a deficiency , and ear infections11 were the most common reasons for mih in the present study .
varicella zoster virus and vitamin a deficiency cause abrupt changes or disturbances in epithelium - derived ameloblast , leading to hypomineralized enamel because of reduced secretory ability of ameloblast during enamel maturation.12 similarly , antibiotic therapy during the first 3 years of birth may alter the secretory ability of ameloblast.11 chest infection during the first year of life may create hypoxic conditions for ameloblast leading to mih.12 a total of 9.9 % of the diagnosed mih children gave a history of high fever / fever of unknown origin .
this is in agreement with a previous study13 as maternal pyrexia or high fever in the newborn can have disastrous effects on amelogensis ranging from enamel hypoplasia / hypomineralization to complete cellular degeneration .
the study of 12 children diagnosed with mih reported to have a history of long - term breastfeeding was in agreement with the findings of alaluusua et al.14 this can be explained by the fact that some environmental hazardous elements ( e.g. , dioxins , mercury , pthalates ) or the malnourished status of nursing mother may deprive the child of adequate nutrition leading to hypomineralization .
on the contrary , whatling and fearne15 found no association regarding breastfeeding duration and mih .
apart from a history of postnatal infections , 7 mothers reported to have gestational diabetes , 5 had hypertension , 12 had a history of intake of amoxicillin during pregnancy , 9 children had low birth weight (< 2.5 kg ) , while 7 accounted for preterm birth (< 7 months ) , constituting 40 children in total diagnosed with mih .
molar incisor hypomineralization in 26 ( 13.6 %) of the diagnosed children cannot be correlated with any of the known etiological factors or history of pregnancy / diseases in early childhood .
also type of delivery , i.e. , cesarean and normal , did not have any significant impact on occurrence of mih with the place of birth ( urban or rural ) .

however , involvement of both incisors and molars was significantly high in females ( p = 0.002 ) as well as for females with incisor opacities ( p = 0.002 ) .
it was observed that prevalence of affected single molar was high ( 37.7 %) , and 14 cases ( 7.3 %) reported involvement of all four molars .
also the data in the present study revealed that higher the number of affected tooth , most likely is the severity of the lesions which can be explained by duration and time of insult during enamel formation .
the finding of the present study is in accordance with the observation of jalevik et al and leppaniemi et al in 2001 .
also the mean age of the affected children was 10.25 years in the present study , and it was observed that more severe lesion was present with increased age .
the children in the age group of 8 to 9 years showed opacities or fewer breakdowns as compared with older children .
this can be explained by the fact that a hypomineralized tooth after eruption is subjected to masticatory stress and caries attack leading to breakdown of tooth as the age increases , thus demanding need for more complex restorations .
this finding supports the observation by weerheijm et al that even minute opacities need years of follow - up to detect the breakdown as eventually it is uncertain which part of tooth will break and which will remain intact .
comparing the mih prevalence data among different countries , the present study showed a moderate prevalence .
however , the actual comparison between the data is not possible due to difference in diagnostic criteria , sample size , and study design as some of the preceding studies laid stress on treatment needs , while others differentiated the severity of lesions .
the limitation of the present study is paucity of literature and technologies to differentiate between opacities due to caries / trauma and mih .
this may lead to false - positive load of mih in population when opacities are taken into consideration .
conclusion the present study reports a prevalence of 13.9 % in children of age group 8 to 12 years .
thus , mih is a frequently occurring dental ailment in the pediatric population .
it is an established fact from literature as well as the present study that any pre - and postchanges affecting ameloblast during enamel formation may lead to mih .
hence , a protocol for early diagnosis and follow - up to access the squeal of breakdown should be undertaken along with parents and health workers .
this may prevent the requirement of extensive restorative treatment , and preventive measures ( pit fissure sealants , resin infiltrations ) alone can reduce the severity of mih .
more studies in this field are needed to be undertaken to spread awareness in the general population and to practice specific preventive health care to the mother and child .

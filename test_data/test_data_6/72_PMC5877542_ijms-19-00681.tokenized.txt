in sickle cell disease ( scd ) , hydroxyurea ( hu ) treatment decreases the number of vaso - occlusive crisis ( voc ) and acute chest syndrome ( acs ) by increasing fetal hemoglobin ( hbf ) .
data are lacking regarding the frequency of hu dose modification or whether sub - therapeutic doses (< 15 mg / kg / day ) are beneficial .
we reviewed the medical records of 140 patients from 2010 to 2014 .
the laboratory parameters and scd complications were compared between the first and last visits based on hu use .
fifty patients ( 36 %) never took hu or suspended hu (" no hu " group ) .
among patients taking < 15 mg / kg / day hu on their first visit , half remained at the same dose , and the other half increased to >= 15 mg / kg / day .
among patients taking >= 15 mg / kg / day , 17 % decreased to < 15 mg / kg / day , and 83 % stayed at >= 15 mg / kg / day .
the " no hu " group had fewer episodes of voc and acs .
both hu treatment groups had a reduction in both complications ( p < 0.0001 ) .
this improvement was observed in all scd phenotypes .
the white blood cell ( wbc ) counts were found to be lower , and hbf increased in both hu groups ( p = 0.004 , 0.001 ) .
the maximal hbf response to hu in hbs / beta + - thalassemia was 20 % , similar to those observed for hbss ( 19 %) and hbs / beta0 - thalassemia ( 22 %) .
hbs / beta + - thalassemia could have a similar disease severity as hbss or hbs / beta0 - thalassemia .
patients with hbs / beta0 - thalassemia or hbs / beta + - thalassemia phenotypes responded to hu. sickle cell disease sickle beta thalassemia hydroxyurea fetal hemoglobin 1 .
introduction sickle cell disease ( scd ) is the most common inherited hemoglobin disorder in africa and has prompted the world health organization ( who ) to call for the implementation of regional strategies to increase disease awareness and provide a national infrastructure to reduce its morbidity and mortality [ 1 ] .
overall , 5 % of the global population are carriers for hemoglobinopathies , with 40 % of them being represented by hbs [ 2,3 ] .
the burden of this and other hemoglobin disorders is expected to increase in the coming decades because of the reductions in infant mortality in many low - income countries and the increasing migration from high - to low - hbs - frequency areas worldwide [ 4 ] .
childhood deaths have declined over the last 3 decades in europe and north america due to newborn screening , routine prophylaxis with penicillin , pneumococcal vaccinations , and access to medical care [ 5,6,7,8 ] .
despite these advances , mortality due to disease and organ dysfunctions has remained high in patients with scd .
the median age of death was reported to be 42 years for men and 48 years for women [ 9,10 ] .
hydroxyurea ( hu ) has been approved for treating scd [ 11 ] .
hu increases production of fetal hemoglobin ( hbf ) with a concomitant reduction in the intracellular concentration of hbs , which affects the polymerization of deoxygenated hbs .
it also reduces the white blood count ( wbc ) and the expression of cell adhesion molecules that contribute to vaso - occlusion and may serve as a nitric oxide donor [ 12,13,14,15 ] .
long - term studies demonstrated its efficacy in decreasing both the number and severity of vaso - occlusive crisis ( voc ) and acute chest syndromes ( acs ) by increasing fetal hemoglobin ( hbf ) , leading to a reduction of red cell sickling [ 16,17,18,19,20 ] .
although the long - term use of hu has improved overall survival , it was not clear what proportions of patients were taking a therapeutic dose of >= 15 mg / kg / day [ 21,22 ] .
there was also inadequate reporting of the frequency of hu dose modification during follow - up and whether those who were treated with doses < 15 mg / kg / day benefitted from hu. in this work , we evaluated the effects of different hu doses in patients with scd in terms of hematologic improvement , possible changes in organ dysfunction , and causes of death at a single referral institution .
2. results 2.1 .
hydroxyurea dosing adjustment was common the 140 patients at the hospital " v. cervello " had a median enrollment age of 35 years ( range 0.4 - 61 years ) with equal gender proportions ( table 1 ) .
the mean duration of follow - up was 6.6 years .
the criteria to start hu treatment were those suggested by charache et al. , 1995 (> 3 painful vaso - occlusive crises per year and / or > 2 acute chest syndrome [ 20 ]) .
hu was started at a dose of 10 mg / kg orally , on a daily basis , and increased at a rate of 5 mg / kg / week as long as the hematologic values remained in an acceptable range .
among 64 patients who did not take hu at the initial visit , 39 stayed off treatment , 10 patients started hu later and maintained the dose at < 15 mg / kg / day , and another 15 patients started and maintained hu at >= 15 mg / kg / day at the last visit. of 76 patients who were taking hu at the first visit , 11 discontinued hu by the last clinic visit due to cytopenia : 7 patients had a reduction in neutrophil counts , 3 patients suffered decreased hemoglobin levels , and 1 patient had a decrease in platelet counts .
these 11 patients , combined with the 39 patients who never took hu , formed the " no hu " group ( n = 50 of 140 , 36 %) .
among patients who took < 15 mg / kg / day hu at the first visit , 14 stayed in the same dosage , and 15 increased to >= 15 mg / kg / day at the last follow - up. of the patients who took >= 15 mg / kg / day , 6 decreased to < 15 mg / kg / day due to neutropenia , and 30 stayed in the same dose range .
overall , there were 30 patients ( 21 %) in the " hu < 15 mg / kg / day " group and 60 ( 43 %) in the " hu >= 15 mg / kg " group .
2.2 .
hydroxyurea led to similar beneficial hematologic changes in all sickle phenotypes patients with hbss ( 18 %) represented a small proportion of all patients compared to hbs / beta0 ( 39 %) and combined hbs / beta + ( 43 %) .
the median age , proportion of males and females , and survival status were similar in all three groups ( table 2 ) .
the proportion of patients taking hu , increases in hbf , and increases in mcv , were also similar .
at the last visit , the mean white blood cell ( wbc ) count was lower in both hu groups compared to the no - hu group ( p < 0.05 ) ( supplemental table s2 ) .
the mean absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) and total hemoglobin levels in both hu groups , however , were not significantly different than the no - hu group , possibly due to hu not being at the maximally tolerated doses .
the hbf levels in the no - hu group at the first visit were higher due to the inclusion of four patients with high hbf levels and two < one - year - old children .
the hbf levels in this group subsequently decreased at the last visit .
in contrast , both hu groups had increased hbf levels at the last visit , and these changes were significant ( p < 0.05 ) compared with the no - hu group ( supplemental table s2 ) .
hu - treated groups showed hbf last visit / hbf first visit ratios > 1 .
these ratios were 1.12 and 1.24 in the >= 15 mg / kg / day and < 15 mg / kg / day hu - treated groups , respectively .
instead , no hu - treated patients showed hbf last visit / hbf first visit ratio < 1 ( ratio 0.65 ) .
however , hu treatment was not associated with changes in liver enzymes , serum creatinine ( scr ) , tricuspid valve regurgitant velocity ( trv ) , or ejection fraction ( ef ) ( supplemental table s2 ) .
2.3 .
hydroxyurea reduced voc and acs events the overall 50 patients in the no hu - group , compared to both hu groups at the first visit , had milder disease with lower percentage of patients with voc ( 60 % vs. 94 %) and acs ( 22 % vs. 50.5 %) ( p = 0.001 ) .
the prevalence of patients having >= 1 new voc hospitalization or >= 1 new acs at first and last visit was similar ( 49 % vs. 67 % for voc and 18 % vs. 30 % for acs ) , if the 39 / 50 no - hu sub - group of patients who never took hu was considered .
these findings suggest as the inclusion , in the no - hu treated group , of the cohort with 11 patients who discontinued drug treatment before last visit , may not have any role in increasing complications .
the no - hu group follow - up suggests as the prevalence of patients with >= 1 new voc hospitalization before the last visit was 70 % , very close to the 60 % at the first visit .
the number of voc episodes per patient / year was even similar ( 2.0 and 2.5 at first and last visit , respectively ) .
acs prevalence , in the no - hu treated group , was similar between the first ( 22 %) and the last visit ( 28 %) , respectively .
finally , even the number of mean episodes of acs per patient was similar ( 0.2 vs. 0.28 ) in contrast , both hu - treated groups , < 15 mg / kg / day and >= 15 mg / kg / day , had higher prevalence of voc at the first ( 90 %) and last visit ( 97 %) , respectively .
however , these values decreased significantly at the last visit , moving from 90 to 57 % and from 97 to 60 % , respectively .
the number of voc episodes per patient / year decreased from 4.3 to 1.2 and from 4.1 to 1.1 , in the hu group < 15 mg / kg / day , and in the hu - group >= 15 mg / kg / day , respectively .
the number of mean acs episodes per patient in both hu groups also decreased by nearly 2 / 3 , from 0.7 to 0.23 and from 1.1 to 0.32 , respectively .
the patients with hbs / beta + - thalassemia had also severe phenotype , when they were compared to others .
indeed , the same proportion of patients with hbs / beta0 - and hbs / beta + - thalassemia died during the follow - up period ( table 2 ) .
additionally , the prevalence of patients with voc and acs , the number of voc per patient / year , the number of acs episodes per patient were similar among the three phenotypes .
finally , at the last visit , all three phenotype groups had the similar reduction in voc and acs on hu treatment ( figure 1 ) .
2.4 .
mortality fifteen deaths have been registered over 6.6 years follow - up. the median age of death was 46 years ( 24 - 68 years ) , with a male to female ratio of 2:1 .
deceased patients at the first visit were significantly older ( 42.06 vs. 33.13 years ) .
among the 15 deaths , five patients did not received treatment with hu , four patients received hu at < 15 mg / kg / day and 5 patients at >= 15 mg / kg / day ; one patient took hu < 15 mg / kg / day but it was discontinued at the last visit .
worst hepatic , renal , cardiopulmonary , and iron overloading findings at the first visit were shown in patients who died in comparison with those who did not ; the same pattern was observed at the last visit ( table 3 ) .
there were no differences in hematologic parameters between the alive and deceased patients at the first visit ( hb 9.9 vs. 10.0 g / dl , mcv 82 vs. 81 fl , wbc 8.9 vs. 10.4 k / microl , hbf 12.2 vs. 12.1 %) .
however , significant differences were observed at the last follow - up ( dead vs. alive , hb 9.4 vs. 11.3 g / dl , mcv 82 vs. 85 fl , wbc 12.6 vs. 8.4 k / microl , hbf 11.5 vs. 11.8 %) .
overall causes of death may be considered sickle - cell related : 4 deaths for acs , 1 for acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) 1 for voc , 1 for sepsis , 2 for post - ischemic intestinal hemorrhage , during voc , 3 for myocardial infarction and 3 for cirrhosis with liver failure in hcv - rna negative patients .
3. discussion scd , even under contemporary medical care , is burdened by high morbidity and mortality [ 23 ] .
the introduction of hu , the only medication approved for its treatment , has improved the outcome of many patients with scd [ 11 ] .
however , since its approval , it is not clear which proportion of patients is taking a therapeutical dosage (>= 15 mg / kg / day ) and / or the rate at which hu dosage changes occur during the follow - up. these findings suggest as , in our adult cohort of patients with caucasian sickle - cell - beta thalassemia , during an average follow - up of 6.6 years , hu was administered to 54 % and to 64 % of patients at the initial and final visit , respectively .
moreover , the dosage adjustment was common .
a large proportion of no hu - treated patients at the initial visit ( 25 out of 64 , 39 %) began and remained on hu by the last visit .
an equally large proportion of hu < 15 mg / kg / day patients at the initial visit ( 15 out of 29 , 52 %) increased hu dosage to >= 15 mg / kg / day .
the hu >= 15 mg / kg / day dosing group appeared to be the most stable , with 30 out of the 36 patients ( 86 %) remaining above 15 mg / kg / day .
most of dose reductions in hu group were due to neutropenia during hu escalation dosage aimed at reaching the maximally tolerated dose .
the rate of hu administration , in this caucasian cohort of patients with sickle - cell beta - thalassemia , was comparable with the recent papers reporting as hu rate of administration was 50 % both in the inpatient cohort of a multi - center study [ 24 ] and in the us federal and state insurance - based analysis [ 25 ] .
while it was prescribed from 50 to 75 % by us hematologists [ 26,27 ] .
the main hematological findings between first and last visit suggest as : ( 1 ) wbc counts were lower in hu - treated groups ; ( 2 ) hemoglobin levels changing were not statistically significant during the observation period ; ( 3 ) the hbf levels at the last visit increased significantly in hu - treated groups compared with no hu - treated group ( p < 0.05 ) .
these data confirm as even in caucasian population with sickle - cell / beta - thalassemia , hu is able to decrease wbc count and to increase the hbf , percentage [ 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 ] .
these changes are associated with decreasing of voc , acs , and the other complications [ 30,31,32 ] .
recently , rigano et al. , in a cohort of 652 sickle - cell anemia adult patients with heterogeneous descent , suggested as hu treatment was associated with a significant increase in mean total and fetal hemoglobin and a significant decrease in mean white blood and platelet count [ 32 ] .
this study confirmed the data about mortality that were shown in prior studies over the last several years - - pulmonary and cardiac complications , with a vaso - occlusive crisis are the most common causes of death in patients with scd [ 27,33,34 ] .
in our study , acs after voc was a more common cause of death , followed by heart failure during a voc .
our study showed that patients hbss , hbs / beta0 - thal , and hbs / beta + - thal all responded to hu similarly .
patients in each subgroup showed improved hematological parameters ( wbc , anc , mcv , hbf ) after the treatment , suggesting that higher dosages led to better results .
unfortunately , the small sample size precluded subtype analysis .
the limitations of this retrospective study were due to the lack of patient follow - up data from birth .
moreover , hu treatment decision and doses were made at the discretion of the treating physician .
furthermore , compliance with hu was inferred by medical record reviews and not independently verified , so hu use may have been intermittent .
however , these data suggest , as in real - life and in a caucasian population with sickle - cell beta thalassemia , hu treatment is effective and safe at long - term .
4. methods 4.1 .
patient population medical records were retrospectively reviewed , and 140 patients were enrolled at the haematology department of ospedale v. cervello between january 2000 and april 2014 .
scd subtypes were determined by dna sequencing and high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) : 25 patients ( 18 %) were homozygous for hemoglobin s ( hbss ) ; 54 ( 38 %) with compound heterozygous for hbs / beta0 - thalassemia ; 56 with hbs / beta + - thalassemia , 4 with hbs / deltabeta - thalassemia , and 1 hbs / lepore ( 44 % , supplemental table s1 ) .
the patients were also divided into three groups based on hu use : patients who never took hu and those who suspended hu intake before the last visit ( no hu group , n = 50 , 36 %) ; those who reported taking hu at < 15 mg / kg / day at the last visit ( n = 30 , 21 %) ; or those taking hu >= 15 mg / kg / day at the last visit ( n = 60 , 43 %) .
4.2 .
clinical , laboratory , and echocardiographic data clinical , laboratory , and echocardiographic evaluations were performed at the first visit and every three to six months during follow - up , when appropriate .
data analysis included inpatient and outpatient visits to hospital " v. cervello " following enrollment .
data obtained from outside hospitals close to the time of death were included for comparison .
for each subject , the maximum hbf , mean corpuscular volume ( mcv ) , and maximum hu dose were defined as the highest values observed during the follow - up. the frequency of voc and acs episodes at the first visit were compared to new reports of these sickle - related complications since the first visit .
blood counts , hbf response , organ function parameters , and changes in scd complications were compared between the first and last visits .
4.3 .
hydroxyurea status and dose determination hu treatment and dosing decisions were made at the discretion of the treating physician .
the dose determinations were screened by electronic outpatient clinic notes , inpatient admission records , and medication orders .
4.4 .
statistical analysis groups were analyzed based on survival status , hydroxyurea dosing , and hbf response .
comparisons were performed using t - tests , wilcoxon rank tests , and chi - square tests , when appropriate .
a cox proportional hazard regression was used to relate survival and hydroxyurea exposure with laboratory values and other potential covariates .
all analyses were performed using sas ( version 9.1.3 ; sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) and jmp ( version 8.0 ; sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) .
acknowledgments additional support for our research was provided by foundation franco and piera cutino .
moreover , we would like to thank courtney d. fitzhugh for helping us with the data interpretation and massimiliano sacco for helping us with statistical analysis .
finally , we would like to thank all patients and their families .

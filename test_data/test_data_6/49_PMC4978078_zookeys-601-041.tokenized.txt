doi : 10.3897 / zookeys.601.8349 introduction the spider genus draconarius ovtchinnikov , 1999 is distributed in central and east asia and has a high level of species diversity with 244 species described to date ( world spider catalog 2016 , wang 2016 ) .
a total of 151 draconarius species has been reported from china , but more than half of these species are described from only the male or female ( world spider catalog 2016 ) .
draconarius jiangyongensis ( peng , gong & kim , 1996 ) was first described as a member of the genus coelotes blackwall , 1840 based on six female specimens from jiangyong county , hunan province , china ( peng et al. 1996 ) .
wang ( 2003 ) transferred this species to the genus draconarius .
draconarius jiangyongensis was illustrated by song et al .
( 1999 ) , and redescribed by wang ( 2003 ) and yin et al .
( 2012 ) , but only based on the females from the type locality .
during the expedition to langshan national geopark in november of 2014 , ten females and eleven males were identified to be draconarius jiangyongensis based on comparison with the type specimens .
the female is redescribed here and the male is described for the first time in the present study .
material and methods specimens were examined with an olympus szx16 stereomicroscope and an olympus bx53 compound microscope .
photos were taken with a canon powershot g12 digital camera mounted on an olympus bx53 compound microscope .
both the male palp and the female epigyne were examined and illustrated after being dissected from the spider bodies .
all specimens examined in this study are deposited in the college of life sciences , hunan normal university ( hnu ) .
all measurements are given in millimeters .
eye diameters are taken at the widest point .
leg measurements are given as : total length ( femur , patella + tibia , metatarsus , tarsus ) .

all specimens are collected by hand picking by haiqiang yin , cheng wang , bing zhou , jiahui gan and yuhui gong. diagnosis .
female of draconarius jiangyongensis can be distinguished from other draconarius by the presence of a vase - shaped septum of epigyne ( figs 2b , 3e ) , the anteriorly originating and laterally extending copulatory ducts , and the spermathecae widely separated basally and contiguous distally ( figs 2b , c , 3e , f ) .
the male of draconarius jiangyongensis is similar to draconarius yadongensis ( hu & li , 1987 ) in having a simple conductor , an embolus arising at approximately 10 o'clock ( left palp ) and the short cymbial furrow ( figs 1c , d , 3b , c ) , but can be distinguished from the latter by the shape of the conductor ( the conductor axe - shaped , with a wrinkly surface in draconarius jiangyongensis , but narrow with a sharp end tip and broad dorsal edge in draconarius yadongensis ) ( figs 1d , f , 3b , d ) .

promarginal and retromarginal teeth of chelicera and the dorsal pattern of opisthosoma are the same as male ( fig. 2a ) .
epigyne ( figs 2b , c , 3e , f ) : teeth triangular , large and thin , located anterolaterally ; septum large , with the base much wider than the stem ; atrium divided into two parts by septum ; the bases of spermathecae highly convoluted and separated about two times their diameter from each other , and the distal ends of spermathecae contiguous ; copulatory ducts short , anteriorly situated and laterally extending. remark .
the draconarius and coelotes are two most species - rich genera in the coelotinae , with 244 and 183 species described to date , respectively .
most of those species were described based on only the male or female .
as a result , some might be incorrectly placed .
this species described here is more likely to be a member of the genus coelotes than draconarius based on the following combination of characters : the large epigynal teeth , the atrium ( atrium divided into two parts by septum ) and short copulatory ducts in the female ; the large patellar apophysis , the short and prolaterally originating embolus and the short cymbial furrow ( less than 1 / 3 length of the cymbium ) in the male .
it differs from coelotes atropos ( walckenaer , 1830 ) by the presence of septum .
it also differs from the type species and many other species of draconarius ( for example , draconarius guizhouensis ( peng , li & huang , 2002 ) , draconarius latellai marusik & ballarin , 2011 and so on ) by the number of cheliceral teeth ( this species with three promarginal and four retromarginal teeth while the type species and many other species of draconarius have three promarginal and two retromarginal teeth. ) distribution .

cyclic amp receptor protein ( crp ) , a global regulator in escherichia coli , regulates more than 180 genes via two roles : activation and repression .
few methods are available for predicting the regulatory roles from the binding sites of transcription factors .
this work proposes an accurate method predcrp to derive an optimised model ( named predcrp - model ) and a set of four interpretable rules ( named predcrp - ruleset ) for predicting and analysing the regulatory roles of crp from sequences of crp - binding sites .
a dataset consisting of 169 crp - binding sites with regulatory roles strongly supported by evidence was compiled .
the predcrp - model , using 12 informative features of crp - binding sites , and cooperating with a support vector machine achieved a training and test accuracy of 0.98 and 0.93 , respectively .
predcrp - ruleset has two activation rules and two repression rules derived using the 12 features and the decision tree method c4.5 .
this work further screened and identified 23 previously unobserved regulatory interactions in escherichia coli .
using quantitative pcr for validation , predcrp - model and predcrp - ruleset achieved a test accuracy of 0.96 (= 22 / 23 ) and 0.91 (= 21 / 23 ) , respectively .
the proposed method is suitable for designing predictors for regulatory roles of all global regulators in escherichia coli .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction cyclic amp receptor protein ( crp ) is one of the most important transcription factors ( tfs ) in escherichia coli ( e. coli ) .
crp was the first purified1 , crystallised2 , and the most well - studied tf in e .
coli3 - 9 .
crp regulates more than 180 genes10 by cooperating with camp .
the latter transduces intracellular signals by changing its intracellular concentration in response to environmental signals .
once the concentration of intracellular camp changes , the production of the camp - crp complex will be affected10 - 14 .
when the camp - crp complex acts on a binding site for gene regulation , it has one of two opposing regulatory roles : activation or repression15 .
the crp - regulated genes are typically involved in energy - related metabolic pathways , such as galactose metabolism , citrate metabolism , and the phosphoenolpyruvate group translocation system16 .
to predict the regulatory roles of crp , we first needed to know more about the crp - binding site .
there are two categories of methods to identify the binding site of a specific tf. one category consists of the low - throughput methods such as the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the dnase i footprinting assay17 .
the other category comprise high - throughput methods such as the chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assay , a sequencing - based method ( chip - seq ) 18 and elegant computational methods focusing on predicting tf - binding sites19 - 21 .
once information on the crp - binding sites has been obtained , we can further predict the regulatory roles of crp .
there are two approaches to determining regulatory roles of a tf. one is a low - throughput approach such as the promoter - lacz fusion17 and quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) 22 .
the other consists of a high - throughput approach such as gene expression analysis using rna - seq23 or microarray data .
however , gene expression analysis has a limit in determining indirect effects such as co - expressed but not co - regulated genes24 .
currently , the identification of directly co - regulated genes is particularly challenging24 .
these observations imply that the determination of the regulatory roles of a tf on co - regulated genes is also a challenging problem .
few methods are available for predicting the regulatory roles of a global tf from tf - binding sequences .
the widely used 3 - class rules state that if a crp - binding site satisfies some conditions , crp tends to be an activator .
the class i rule states that if the crp - binding site is located at position - 61.5 , then crp tends to be an activator25 - 27 .
the class ii rule states that if the crp - binding site is located at position - 41.5 , then crp tends to be an activator25 - 27 .
the class iii rule states that if a crp - dependent promoter has two or more crp - binding sites , then the promoter tends to be an activator25,27 .
at present , there is no rule linking conditions in the camp - crp complex to it acting as a repressor25 - 27 .
hence , we propose an accurate method , predcrp , to derive an optimised model ( named predcrp - model ) and a set of four interpretable rules ( named predcrp - ruleset ) for predicting and analysing the regulatory roles of crp from given sequences of crp - binding sites .
the design of predcrp includes four parts ( see fig. 1 ) : ( 1 ) establishment of a dataset consisting of 169 crp - binding sites with regulatory roles strongly supported by evidence , ( 2 ) feature extraction from the crp - binding sites , ( 3 ) feature selection in cooperation with a support vector machine ( svm ) , and ( 4 ) rule acquisition based on the decision tree method c4.5 .
more information about feature extraction , feature selection , and rule acquisition are found in the materials and methods section .
figure 1 components for developing and evaluating the proposed predcrp method .
( 1 ) establishment of the crps dataset consisting of 169 crp - binding sites with regulatory roles supported by strong evidence , ( 2 ) feature extraction from the training dataset cprs - trn , ( 3 ) feature selection in cooperation with an svm , ( 4 ) predcrp - ruleset obtained based on the decision tree method c4.5 , ( 5 ) predcrp - model evaluated by crp - binding sties with weak evidence ( the crpw dataset ) and ( 6 ) the qpcr experimental validation on the regulatory roles of crp .
as a result , a set of 12 informative features was identified from 380 candidate features of crp - binding sites using an inheritable bi - objective combinatorial genetic algorithm ( ibcga ) 28 ( see the materials and methods section ) .
various prediction models were evaluated to examine both prediction accuracy and interpretation ability .
predcrp - model achieved a training and test accuracy of 0.98 and 0.93 , respectively .
predcrp - ruleset covered 88 % of the crp - binding sites and achieved a training accuracy of 0.95 .
among the four interpretable rules , the covered binding regions of two activation rules contain the regions of the widely used class i and ii rules of crp .
the other two rules for the repression role are novel and describe the condition relating to the crp - binding site 's locations and sequence composition .
furthermore , we used predcrp - model and predcrp - ruleset to screen and identify 23 previously unobserved regulatory interactions in e. coli and validated these regulatory roles using qpcr experiments .
experimental results showed that 22 and 21 of the 23 interactions were correct using predcrp - model and predcrp - ruleset , respectively .
results evaluation of predcrp - model twelve informative features were selected using the ibcga , which include eight of the 256 4 - mer motifs in the composition descriptor ( aacg , catt , gaac , gagc , tgcg , ttac , ttat , and tttt ) and four features in the location - dependent descriptor : ( 1 ) l3 : the size of the overlap region between the crp - binding site and the region from - 35 to - 10 ; ( 2 ) l6 : the size of the overlap region between the crp - binding site and the region from - 10 to 2 ; ( 3 ) l12 : the size of the overlap region between the crp - binding site and the region from - 60 to 60 ; and ( 4 ) l15 : the size of the overlap region between the crp - binding site and the region from - 95 to - 35 .
tables 1 and 2 show the performance comparison among various feature sets with the svm classifier on the training ( crps - trn ) and test ( crps - tst ) datasets , respectively .
the parameter settings of the svms for various feature sets except for predcrp - model were determined by a grid search method .
the positive and negative sites are the binding sites on which crp act as a repressor and an activator , respectively .
the all - feature svm model works as a baseline model .
predcrp - model with the 12 informative features was significantly better than svms with various feature sets for both the training and test datasets ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
predcrp - model achieved test acc and mcc values of 0.93 and 0.79 , respectively .
the feature selection of predcrp enhanced the svm classifier with all features by test acc 0.13 (= 0.93 - 0.80 ) and mcc 0.53 (= 0.79 - 0.26 ) .
the additional dataset ( named crps - tst - 2 ) was used to evaluate predcrp - model in this study .
predcrp - model achieved test acc and mcc values of 0.97 and 0.91 , respectively .

as shown in fig. 2 , predcrp - model has the auc value of 0.90 with the test dataset , which is better than the svm method with other feature sets : 0.71 for eight informative 4 - mer motifs , 0.73 for four informative location features , 0.79 for all features , 0.61 for composition features , 0.79 for location - dependent features , and 0.70 for location - independent features .
figure 2 roc curves of various methods using the crps - tst dataset .
the aucs of predcrp - model and svms with informative 4 - mer motifs , informative location features , all features , composition feature , location - dependent feature , and location - independent feature were 0.71 , 0.73 , 0.90 , 0.79 , 0.61 , 0.79 , and 0.70 , respectively .
the svms with the eight motif features and four location features yielded test accuracy of 0.82 and 0.82 , respectively .
this result reveals that the use of the 4 - mer motifs or location features only cannot produce satisfactory prediction results .
furthermore , the use of a combination of informative motif and location features is important for accurate prediction .
predcrp - model makes the best use of both the informative 4 - mer motifs and location features .
evaluation of predcrp - ruleset predcrp - ruleset has two activation rules and two repression rules obtained from the decision tree method c4.5 , along with the 12 informative features .
each extracted interpretable rule corresponds to a specific path from the root to a specific leaf of the decision tree .
each rule has its own cover ratio on the crps dataset consisting of 133 activators and 36 repressors .
figure s1 shows the extracted rules for activators and repressors .
after careful inference of the location and motif features , two activation rules and two repression rules with high cover ratios were derived , as shown in fig. 3. the detailed inference procedure is presented in supporting information , and the location criteria of activation rules 1 and 2 , and repression rules 1 and 2 are shown in the supplementary figures ( figures s2 , s3 , s4 , and s5 ) .
figure 3 four interpretable rules for illustrating the regulatory roles of crp acting on the binding region .
activation rule 1 the activation rule 1 ( a1 ) states that if a crp - binding site is located in binding regions denoted as location variable region , where region <= - 49.5 and region >= 49.5 , and the number of tttt motifs is smaller than or equal to 2 in a crp - binding site , then crp generally acts as an activator .
a1 covers 66.2 % (= 88 / 133 ) of activators in the crps dataset and shows an accuracy of 93.6 % (= 88 / 94 ) .
furthermore , the binding regions of a1 contain the region of the widely used class ii rule of crp .
the region <= - 49.5 of a1 covers 87 activators and the region >= 49.5 covers only one activator .
activation rule 2 the activation rule 2 ( a2 ) states that if a crp - binding site is located in the binding region of - 70.5 to - 28.5 and there is no aacg motif in the crp - binding site , then crp generally acts as an activator .
a2 covers 23.3 % (= 31 / 133 ) of activators in the crps dataset and shows accuracy of 96.8 % (= 31 / 32 ) .
furthermore , the binding region of a2 contains the region of the widely used class i rule of crp .
repression rule 1 the repression rule 1 ( r1 ) states that if a crp - binding site is located in the binding regions , where 2 < region < 70.5 and - 49.5 <= region < - 10 , and there is no ttac motif in the crp - binding site , then crp generally acts as a repressor .
r1 covers 38.9 % (= 14 / 36 ) of repressors in the crps dataset and shows accuracy of 93.3 % (= 14 / 15 ) .
the binding region ( - 49.5 to - 10 ) strongly overlaps with the rna polymerase - binding site ( - 35 to - 10 ) .
on the other hand , the binding region ( 2 to 70.5 ) is located downstream of the transcription start site .
therefore , when crp binds to these regions , it may block the transcription process .
the 2 < region < 70.5 of r1 covers five repressors , and the - 49.5 <= region < - 10 covers nine repressors .
repression rule 2 the repression rule 2 ( r2 ) states that if a crp - binding site is located in the binding region of - 31 to 23 and if neither ttac nor gagc motif is present in this crp - binding site , then crp generally acts as a repressor .
r2 covers 19.4 % (= 7 / 36 ) of repressors in the crps dataset and shows accuracy of 100 % (= 7 / 7 ) .
this binding region of - 31 to 23 also strongly overlaps with the rna polymerase - binding site ( - 35 to - 10 ) .
hence , when crp binds to the region ( - 31 to 23 ) , it may block the transcription process .
validation of the predicted regulatory roles of crp by quantitative pcr experiments this work utilised the interpretable rules to predict the regulatory roles of crp acting on 23 crp - binding sites with weak evidence .
the predicted roles of crp were validated by quantitative pcr experiments .
the results show that the prediction accuracy of predcrp - model is as high as 0.96 (= 22 / 23 ) .
the only wrong prediction of crp - binding sites occurred on the ldtb gene in which crp acts as a repressor based on qpcr validation , but predcrp - model predicted an activator role .
on the other hand , the prediction accuracy of the predcrp - ruleset is 0.91 (= 21 / 23 ) .
the wrong prediction of crp - binding sites occurred on the ldtb and exut genes .
based on the qpcr validation , the regulatory roles of crp acting on the ldtb and exut genes are repressor and activator , respectively , which predcrp - ruleset predicted to have opposite roles .
the results of the qpcr experiments are shown in fig. 4 and table s2 , and the inference of relative quantity in qpcr is in the supporting information .
figure 4 the quantitative pcr experiments for determining the regulatory roles of crp on the 23 previously unobserved regulatory interactions in e. coli .
the y - axis represents the relative quantity .
the whiskers are the standard deviation of relative quantity .
the black bars belong to the control group ( 0 mm camp concentration ) , and the white bars belong to the case group ( 1 mm camp concentration ) .
discussion considering the trade - off between prediction accuracy and interpretation ability , both an svm model and a set of interpretable rules were proposed .
predcrp - model had a higher accuracy of 0.96 (= 22 / 23 ) but with less interpretation ability .
predcrp - ruleset obtained satisfactory accuracy of 0.91 (= 21 / 23 ) and also provides a cover ratio that biologists can easily analyse for the regulatory roles of crp - binding sites .
the regulatory role of crp acting on ldtb was wrongly predicted using predcrp - model .
on the other hand , the regulatory roles of crp acting on both ldtb and exut were wrongly predicted using predcrp - ruleset .
the crp - binding site of ldtb has no informative 4 - mer motifs ( aacg , catt , gaac , gagc , tgcg , ttac , ttat , or tttt ) , which satisfies the motif conditions of the four rules .
nonetheless , its location satisfies the a2 rule only .
the ldtb gene is annotated with the following go terms : go : 0006508 ( proteolysis ) , go : 0009252 ( peptidoglycan biosynthetic process ) , go : 0043164 ( gram - negative - bacterium - type cell wall biogenesis ) , and go : 0030288 ( outer membrane - bounded periplasmic space ) .
these processes take place in the outer - membrane - bounded periplasmic space and may involve more complex regulatory mechanisms rather than the simple blocking mechanism suggested by our two repression rules .
on the other hand , both the informative 4 - mer motifs tttt and catt appeared once on the crp - binding site of exut .
similarly , exut is also annotated with membrane - related go terms ( go : 0055085 - transmembrane transport , go : 0015736 - hexuronate transport , and go : 0005886 - plasma membrane ) .
we assume that exut may involve more complex activation mechanisms rather than class i and ii mechanisms .
the predcrp method can be applied to predict the regulatory roles of other global regulators in e. coli .
first , one can download the dataset of tf - binding sites from regulondb , and use the feature extraction programme from https :// github.com / nctuiclab / predcrp .
this programme can retrieve the tfs of interest with a given evidence level ( strong or weak ) .
consequently , one can use a similar process like that described in the materials and methods section to train a predictor of regulatory roles .
materials and methods figure 1 illustrates the main components of predcrp , consisting of an accurate model ( predcrp - model ) and a set of interpretable rules ( predcrp - ruleset ) , including ( 1 ) establishment of datasets of crp - binding sites , ( 2 ) feature extraction from crp - binding sites , ( 3 ) feature selection in cooperation with an svm , ( 4 ) predcrp - ruleset based on the decision tree method c4.5 , ( 5 ) an accurate predcrp - model and ( 6 ) experimental validation of the regulatory roles of crp .
to provide the crp prediction service to the scientific community , predcrp - model can be accessed and downloaded at https :// github.com / nctuiclab / predcrp .
datasets of crp - binding sites a dataset ( named crps ) consisting of 169 crp - binding sites with regulatory roles supported by strong evidence was established to train and evaluate this work .
the crps dataset was retrieved from the regulondb database ( version 8.8 ) 29 , containing up - to - date information on e. coli .
the retrieval procedure of crps was given as follows : step 1 : retrieve tf - binding sites where the " tf name " column was annotated with ' crp ' from the regulondb database .
step 2 : categorise crp - binding sites into strong and weak evidence groups using the " evidence " property obtained from the regulondb database .
step 3 : remove redundant crp - binding sites with the same transcription start site by checking the leftmost and rightmost positions in the genome .
step 4 : filter out the crp - binding sites with lengths not equal to 22 base pairs .
the strong - evidence group in the regulondb v8.8 database is the set of sites selected by performing mutation experiments on tf - binding sites29 .
as a result , the crps dataset consisting of 169 crp - binding sites was randomly divided into training and test datasets in a ratio of 2:1 , referred to as crps - trn and crps - tst , respectively .
crps - trn consists of 24 repression sites and 89 activation sites , while crps - tst consists of 12 repression sites and 44 activation sites .
the crps dataset was subsequently used to design and evaluate this work .
an additional dataset ( crps - tst - 2 ) was used as an independent test for evaluating the predcrp - model .
the crps - tst - 2 dataset consists of the strong evidence crp - binding sites that appeared in version 9.4 but not version 8.8 of the regulondb database .
crps - tst - 2 contains 12 sites of activation and 8 sites of repression .
to explore the regulatory roles of crp on all crp - regulated genes , we enumerated all possible crp - binding sites and screened putative ones using interpretable rules .
the possible crp - binding sites were first retrieved from the regulondb database with weak - evidence annotation ( crpw ) .
the weak evidence was annotated using the following methods29 : ( 1 ) binding in cellular extracts , ( 2 ) gene expression analysis , ( 3 ) similarity to consensus sequences , ( 4 ) reaction blocked in a mutant , ( 5 ) inferred by a curator , ( 6 ) inferred from a mutant phenotype , and ( 7 ) prediction results .
the conserved sequence of crp - binding sites , - nnntg5tg7annnnnntc16ac18annn - , a well - known palindromic sequence , is bound by crp25 - 27 .
in this consensus sequence , the nucleic acid g at positions 5 and 7 and the nucleic acid c at positions 16 and 18 play crucial roles in providing binding free energy between crp and the crp - binding site30 - 32 .
the detailed crp - binding ability in these four positions is provided in supporting information .
the consensus sequence criterion can help to determine whether a site is a binding site or not but cannot determine the regulatory roles of crp directly .
we selected only the four important sites in which the nucleic acids at positions 5 , 7 , 16 and 18 were g , g , c , and c , respectively .
consequently , 23 previously unobserved , putative crp - binding sites with regulatory roles predicted by predcrp - model and predcrp - ruleset were identified .
although the 23 putative crp - binding sites have high probability to be crp - binding sites according to the consensus sequence criterion , we further proved the 23 sites as crp - binding sites by referring to the ecocyc database ( see supporting information ) .
the 23 predicted crp - regulated interactions are given in figure s6 , which were validated by qpcr experiments .
feature extraction from crp - binding sites a comprehensive feature set of crp - binding sites was established , comprising 380 features , including 17 features from a location - dependent descriptor ( table s3 ) 18 , three features from a physicochemical property descriptor , 320 features from the composition descriptors ( 256 features of 4 - mer motif composition descriptor and 64 features of the 3 - mer motif composition descriptor ) , and 40 features from a global sequence descriptor .
this work extended the length of crp - binding sites from 22 to 42 base pairs by respectively adding k base pairs of flanking nucleotides to the regions upstream and downstream of a crp - binding site for considering interactions within a cis - regulatory region18 .
in this work , k = 10 was used .
the detailed feature extraction is given in supplementary information .
feature selection in cooperation with a support vector machine selecting a minimal set of m informative features from n = 380 features while maximising the prediction accuracy of the svm classifier using these m features is a bi - objective combinatorial optimisation problem c ( n , m ) .
to deal with this large parameter optimisation problem , the inheritable bi - objective combinatorial genetic algorithm ( ibcga ) was used28 .
the ibcga , using an intelligent evolutionary algorithm33 , can simultaneously obtain a set of solutions , sr , where r = rstart , rstart + 1 , ... , rend in a single run using an inheritance mechanism to efficiently search for the solution sr + 1 to c ( n , r + 1 ) by inheriting a good solution sr to c ( n , r ) .
sm is the best solution among solutions sr. the ibcga can efficiently solve large - scale feature selection problems and is useful for deriving an optimised svm model34,35 .
the intelligent evolutionary algorithm is good at solving large parameter optimisation problems , such as inferring roles within a large - scale quantitative gene regulatory work36 .
the optimised svm classifier with the m selected informative features is evaluated using the following measurements : prediction accuracy ( acc ) , sensitivity ( sen ) , specificity , and matthews 's correlation coefficient37 .
to provide prediction service to the scientific community , we developed a user - friendly tool based on the svm model .
the detailed algorithm is shown in supporting information .
the parameter settings of the feature selection module are shown in table s4 .
predcrp - ruleset based on c4.5 the m informative features for predicting the regulatory roles of crp and crps were utilised to develop a rule acquisition method based on the decision tree method c4.538 .
a set of if - then rules for distinguishing activators from repressors can be derived from the established decision tree .
the interpretable if - then rules are used to further elucidate the regulatory roles of crp .
an accurate model predcrp - model in this work , the fitness function of the ibcga is the prediction accuracy of k - fold cross - validation .
the numbers of repressors and activators for training the svm model are 24 and 89 , respectively .
to maximise the number of training repressors used , k = 24 was used in this study .
the input of the ibcga is n - dimensional feature vectors of crp - binding sites with regulatory roles in crps - trn , and the output contains a set of m selected features and an svm - based classifier with associated parameter settings of gamma and c. predcrp - model is the optimised svm classifier with the m selected informative features .
predcrp - model is evaluated using the following measurements : prediction accuracy ( acc ) , sensitivity ( sen ) , specificity , and matthews 's correlation coefficient37 .
experimental validation of the regulatory roles of crp experimental design of quantitative pcr experiments crp is a well - known tf governing carbohydrate metabolism39 .
when e. coli grows in a medium containing glucose , the intracellular camp concentration is low40 .
the dna - binding ability of crp is regulated by the camp concentration39,41 .
a quantitative measurement of crp - mediated transcriptional regulation was performed by measuring the gene expression level in an e. coli k12 strain lacking the cyaa gene producing endogenous camp42 , under various camp concentrations .
mutant strains used were e. coli bw25113 derivatives generated from the keio collection system and provided by the national institute of genetics of japan43 .
the regulatory roles of crp on a crp - regulated gene can be determined using the difference between the expression levels of the wild type with the camp concentrations of 0 and 1 mm. quantitative measurement of gene expression levels the quantitative pcr method can obtain expression profiles of genes of interest in a high - throughput and accurate manner22 .
in this work , the same experimental conditions were used44 .
rna isolation was based on the suggested protocol in the tri reagent - rna kit ( molecular research center , cincinnati , oh , usa ) .
rna samples for quantitative pcr were pre - treated with dnase i ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) .
the dna primers used in the quantitative pcr were designed by primer express software ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) and their complements ( table s5 ) .
dna was synthesised using superscript iii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
the quantitative pcr experiments were conducted in an abi prism ( r ) 7000 instrument ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) using the sybr premix ex taq reagent ( takara , tokyo , japan ) .
all quantitative pcr experiments were performed with two replicates .

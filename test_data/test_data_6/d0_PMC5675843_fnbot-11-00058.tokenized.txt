this paper investigates two types of eye movements : vergence and saccades .
vergence eye movements are responsible for bringing the images of the two eyes into correspondence , whereas saccades drive gaze to interesting regions in the scene .
control of both vergence and saccades develops during early infancy .
to date , these two types of eye movements have been studied separately .
here , we propose a computational model of an active vision system that integrates these two types of eye movements .
we hypothesize that incorporating a saccade strategy driven by bottom - up attention will benefit the development of vergence control .
the integrated system is based on the active efficient coding framework , which describes the joint development of sensory - processing and eye movement control to jointly optimize the coding efficiency of the sensory system .
in the integrated system , we propose a binocular saliency model to drive saccades based on learned binocular feature extractors , which simultaneously encode both depth and texture information .
saliency in our model also depends on the current fixation point .
this extends prior work , which focused on monocular images and saliency measures that are independent of the current fixation .
our results show that the proposed saliency - driven saccades lead to better vergence performance and faster learning in the overall system than random saccades .
faster learning is significant because it indicates that the system actively selects inputs for the most effective learning .
this work suggests that saliency - driven saccades provide a scaffold for the development of vergence control during infancy .
active efficient coding saccades vergence binocular saliency map generative adaptive subspace self - organizing map reinforcement learning introduction biological vision systems are often active and rely on a number of eye movements to sense the environment .
remarkably , these vision systems have the ability to autonomously self - calibrate , but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood .
here , we focus on vergence and saccadic eye movements .
vergence eye movements are slow and disconjugate ( the two eyes move in opposite directions ) .
they serve to align the images acquired by the two eyes so that they can be binocularly fused .
saccadic eye movements are rapid and conjugate ( the two eyes move in the same direction ) .
they serve to direct gaze so that the fovea , the region with highest visual acuity , falls on objects of interest .
the two types of eye movements often cooccur .
for example , they are both involved when eye movements are made to direct gaze toward different objects in a 3d scene ( yang et al. , 2002 ) .
the association between vergence and saccades facilitates the imaging of objects of interest onto the fovea of both eyes ( zee et al. , 1992 ) .
saccades are of great importance for human vision .
at any time , the visual system receives a large amount of information from the environment , but has limited capacity for sensing and signal processing .
humans use saccades to direct foveal vision toward places with relevant information ( yarbus , 1967 ; renninger et al. , 2007 ) .
these saccades can be driven by top - down ( gao et al. , 2009 ; kanan et al. , 2009 ; yang and yang , 2012 ) or bottom - up ( itti et al. , 1998 ; hou and zhang , 2007 ; zhang et al. , 2008 ; bruce and tsotsos , 2009 ; han et al. , 2011 ) attention mechanisms .
top - down attention is voluntary and task - driven , whereas bottom - up attention is involuntary and stimulus - driven .
we focus here on the bottom - up mechanism , where saccades are assumed to be generated according to a saliency map , which assigns salience to different points on an image by combining a number of low - level features .
for example , itti et al .
( 1998 ) proposed to generate a saliency map by combining the outputs of feature maps that are sensitive to different features , such as color , intensity , and orientation .
since the primary visual cortex ( area v1 ) is one of the first stages of visual information processing , many models have been inspired by the processing found there .
for example , li ( 2002 ) proposed to generate the saliency map by combining the responses of model v1 neurons tuned to input features such as orientation and color .
the attention based on information maximization ( aim ) saliency model , proposed by bruce and tsotsos ( 2009 ) , combines feature maps generated by a set of learned basis functions that are similar to the receptive fields of v1 neurons .
most proposed saliency models , including those described earlier , assume monocular images , ignoring the importance of depth in human vision .
depth cues play an important role in visual attention ( wolfe and horowitz , 2004 ) and have a strong relationship with objects , since depth discontinuities suggest object boundaries .
although some saliency models have incorporated depth cues , they have typically processed depth and 2d texture information separately , e.g. , by combining saliency maps computed by considering each cue in isolation .
for example , wang et al .
( 2013 ) proposed a visual saliency model that combines a saliency map computed from disparity with a saliency map computed from monocular visual features .
liu et al .
( 2012 ) proposed a saliency model where disparity information is extracted by taking the difference between the left and right images .
they compute the overall saliency as the weighted average of the saliencies computed from disparity , color , and intensity separately .
we describe here an integrated vision system that combines binocular vergence control and binocularly driven saccadic eye movements .
this system extends prior work on learning binocular vergence control using the active efficient coding ( aec ) framework , first proposed by zhao et al .
( 2012 ) .
the aec framework is an extension of barlow 's ( barlow , 1961 ) efficient coding hypothesis , which states that the activity of the sensory - processing neurons encodes their input using as few spikes as possible .
a primary prediction of the efficient encoding hypothesis is that the properties of the sensory - processing neurons adapt to the statistics of the input stimuli .
the aec framework extends the efficient coding hypothesis to include the effect of behavior .
it posits that in addition , the organism 's behavior adapts so that the input can be efficiently encoded. by combining unsupervised and reinforcement learning , aec simultaneously learns both a distributed representation of the sensory input and a policy for mapping this representation to motor commands .
thus , it jointly learns both perception and action as the organism behaves in the environment .
in previous work , aec has been shown to model the development of many reflexive eye movements and other behaviors , such as vergence control ( zhao et al. , 2012 ; lonini et al. , 2013 ; klimmasch et al. , 2017 ) , smooth pursuit ( zhang et al. , 2014 ; teuliere et al. , 2015 ) , optokinetic nystagmus ( zhang et al. , 2016 ) , the combination of vergence and smooth pursuit ( vikram et al. , 2014 ) , and imitation learning ( triesch , 2013 ) .
we make several contributions in this work .
first , in the original work by zhao et al .
( 2012 ) , saccades were generated completely randomly .
this paper integrates the vergence control process with a more realistic model of saccade generation .
second , we extend bruce and tsotsos 's ( bruce and tsotsos , 2009 ) aim saliency model , which was formulated for monocular images , to binocular images .
in particular , instead of using a set of fixed pre - trained monocular basis functions learned on a separate database , our model uses a set of binocular basis functions that are learned as the model agent interacts with the environment .
these low - level binocular features integrate depth and texture information much earlier than in the prior work described earlier and are consistent with what is known about the visual cortex .
poggio and fischer ( 1977 ) claimed that most cortical neurons ( 84 %) are sensitive to the depth of a stimulus .
third , we propose a saliency model , where the saliency of a given point depends upon the current fixation point , whereas most prior saliency models have assigned saliency independently of the current fixation point .
in this version of the saliency model , image points that are different from the current fixation point in terms of appearance or depth are more salient .
fourth , rather than treating saliency and vergence control as two separate problems , our model exhibits a very close coupling between the two .
not only are the two behaviors learned at the same time but they also share the same set of low - level feature detectors .
materials and methods architecture overview our model assumes the robot is in an environment that has multiple objects located at different depths .
we have made a video1 to demonstrate how our system works in the icub simulator ( tikhanoff et al. , 2008 ) .
one frame of the video is shown in figure 1 .
the system drives the robot eyes to saccade to different fixations chosen according to a probability distribution over the points in the scene .
this probability distribution is derived from the saliency map of the scene .
fixations last 400 ms. during each fixation , the system controls the vergence eye movement .
after each fixation , the robot saccades to another fixation point in the environment .

the two red rays indicate the eye gaze vectors .
the inset at the lower right hand corner outlined in red shows a red - cyan anaglyph of the stereo images .
the architecture of the integrated active vision system is illustrated in figure 2 .
it consists of three main parts : the perceptual representation mechanism , the saccade control mechanism , and the vergence control mechanism .

red regions in the saliency map correspond to high values while blue regions correspond to low values .
the red arrows identify the steps in generating the saccade command .
the blue arrows identify the steps in generating the vergence command .
the inputs to the system come from pairs of sub - windows from the left and right camera images .
the input to the saccade control mechanism comes from the largest pair of sub - windows , which cover most of the images .
this pair is down - sampled to generate a coarse scale representation .
the input to the vergence control mechanism comes from three pairs of sub - windows : a pair of small fine scale sub - windows , a pair of medium - sized medium scale sub - windows , and a pair of large coarse scale sub - windows .
the perceptual representation mechanism encodes the binocular image inputs using a distributed representation learned using the generative adaptive subspace self - organizing map ( gassom ) algorithm ( chandrapala and shi , 2014 ) .
the gassom model is a statistical generative model for time - varying sensory input that combines both sparsity and slowness .
the same perceptual representation is used to generate the input to both the saccade and the vergence control mechanisms .
the vergence control mechanism maps the gassom representation of the binocular inputs at all three scales to a set of discrete vergence actions .
the vergence action is chosen according to a probability distribution computed using a neural network with a softmax output .
the image input in the next iteration changes because of the vergence action .
the saccade control mechansim maps the gassom representation of the entire left and right eye images at the coarse scale to a fixation point by sampling the fixation point from a 2d probability distribution generated by a binocular saliency map .
the saliency control policy also includes inhibition of return ( ior ) to prevent the system from returning to a previously generated fixation too quickly .
saccades move the eyes to the selected fixation point while keeping the vergence angle the same .
below , we describe in more detail the experimental setup and the three parts of the integrated active vision system .
to avoid clutter in the notation , we do not indicate time explicitly .
however , it should be understood that most quantities evolve over time either due to the agent 's behavior in the environment , e.g. , the inputs and actions , or due to learning , e.g. , the network weights .
both behavior and learning progress simultaneously .
experimental setups we trained and tested our system in two different simulation environments : the tsukuba environment and the icub environment .
most experiments are implemented in the tsukuba environment .
the results of experiments using the icub environment are reported in figures 5 and 10 .
the tsukuba environment is based on the tsukuba dataset ( martull et al. , 2012 ) , which contains 1,800 photorealistic stereo image pairs created by rendering a virtual 3d laboratory environment .
the environment contains objects located at various depths , resulting in a large range of disparities .
each image has size 640 - by - 480 pixels .
we simulated the effect of eye movements by extracting sub - windows from a single pair of stereo images , where the locations of the extracted sub - windows changes over time .
in particular , we define fixation points in the left and right images .
the left and right fixation points share the same vertical position , but are offset horizontally by an amount modeling the vergence angle .
if the vergence angle is equal to the disparity in the original image , then the fixation points correspond to the same point in the virtual environment .
the stereo input to the saccade control mechanism is obtained by extracting the largest equally sized sub - windows from the left and right images such that the left and right fixation points are aligned in the two sub - windows .
let m and n denote the vertical and horizontal sizes of the images in pixels .
if the horizontal offset between the left and right fixation points is d , then the upper left and lower right locations of the sub - windows are ( d , 1 ) and ( m , n ) in the left image and ( 1,1 ) and ( m - d + 1 , n ) in the right image .
these sub - windows are down - sampled by a factor of 4 , resulting in a coarse scale representation .
we applied bicubic interpolation to implement the image down - sampling .
the stereo input to the vergence control mechanism is obtained by extracting pairs of square sub - windows centered at the fixation points and then possibly down - sampling to generate pairs of 55 - by - 55 pixel images corresponding to three scales : coarse , medium , and fine .
the coarse scale input is obtained by down - sampling 220 - by - 220 pixel sub - windows by a factor of 4 .
the medium scale input is obtained by down - sampling 110 - by - 110 pixel sub - window by a factor of 2 .
the fine scale input is obtained by extracting 55 - by - 55 pixel sub - windows without down - sampling .
simulations consist of 10 frame periods of fixation separated by saccades .
assuming a frame rate of 25 frames per second , each fixation lasts for 400 ms. during each fixation , the horizontal location of the right fixation point is adjusted according to the command given by the vergence control mechanism .
if learned correctly , the vergence control mechanism adjusts the horizontal shift so that both sub - images are centered on the same point in the scene .
we define the retinal disparity to be the difference between the shift and the original image disparity .
when the retinal disparity is 0 , the images in the left and right sub - windows are aligned .
the binocular image pair is changed after every 30 fixations ( 300 frames ) , modeling a change in the scene. between fixations , the system uses the saccade mechanism to choose the left image fixation point .
the right image fixation point is located at the same vertical location but is offset horizontally by a shift , which models the vergence angle .
the initial vergence angle of each fixation is the same as the last vergence angle from the previous fixation .
the icub environment runs in the icub simulation platform ( tikhanoff et al. , 2008 ) .
the icub is a humanoid robot with an active binocular vision system .
the horizontal and vertical field of view are 64degrees and 50degrees , respectively .
to simplify the simulation of the environment , we created the icub world using some simple objects as shown in figure 1 .
the virtual environment in front of the icub robot contains a number of frontoparallel planar surfaces : a large background plane at a depth of 2 m , and five smaller planes of size 0.6 m x 0.6 m square placed at varying depths between the icub and the background plane and at varying frontoparallel offsets .
the planes are textured with images randomly chosen from the mcgill natural image database ( olmos and kingdom , 2004 ) .
binocular images pairs with size 320 - by - 240 pixels are generated by rendering this environment based on the positions and gaze angles of the two eyes .
in our simulations , the icub remains stationary , except for changes in the gaze directions of its left and right eyes , which are controlled by three degrees of freedom : the version , tilt , and vergence angles .
as in the tsukuba environment , simulations consist of 10 frame periods of fixation separated by saccades .
however , the left and right fixation points are both fixed at the center of the images .
saccades between fixations are implemented by changing the version and tilt angles , which are common to both eyes .
during saccades , the vergence angle remains constant .
during fixation , vergence eye movements are implemented by changing the vergence angle between the two eyes while keeping the version and tilt angles fixed .
the icub environment is more realistic than the tsukuba environment , but simulations are more time consuming due to the rendering .
every 30 fixations ( 300 frames ) , the virtual environment is changed by choosing a new set of images from the database to apply to the planar surfaces and by randomizing the depths and positions of the smaller surfaces .
perceptual representation mechanism the vergence and saccade control mechanisms are based on the same perceptual representation mechanism applied to the left and right eye inputs .
the left and right eye images are divided into 2d arrays of 10 - by - 10 pixel patches .
for saccade generation , the patches are offset by a stride of one pixel .
for the vergence control , the patches are offset by a stride of five pixels .
at each scale s and for each pair j of corresponding patches in the left and right eye sub - windows , we concatenate the image intensities into a 200 - dimensional binocular vector , ( 1 ) xs,j = xl,s,jxr,s,jinr200 where s in { c , m , f } ( c , m , f stand for the three scales : coarse , medium , and fine scale , respectively ) , and the monocular vectors , xl,s,j and xr,s,j , contain the pixel intensities from the left and right image patches , which are normalized separately to have zero mean and unit variance .
the representation mechanism has three sets of n = 324 binocular feature extractors , each set corresponding to one scale .
the binocular stimulus xs,j is encoded by the set of feature extractors at the associated scale s. the n - th feature extractor in scale s is defined by a two dimensional subspace of the input space , which is spanned by the basis defined by the columns of a matrix phis,n in r200x2 where n in { 1 , ...
, n } .
given an input patch vector xs,j , the response of the n - th feature extractor is defined to be the squared length of the projection of xs,j onto the subspace defined by phis,n : ( 2 ) rn ( xs,j )= phis,ntxs,j2 where the superscript t denotes the transpose operation .
for each feature extractor phis,n , we define the response map to be the 2d set of responses of that feature detector to the 2d array of patches .
the operations involved in computing the response maps are similar to those used in computing the binocular energy model , which is commonly used to model the responses of orientation , scale , and disparity tuned binocular complex cells in the primary visual cortex ( ohzawa et al. , 1990 ) .
the subspace projection operation computes two weighted sums of the binocular image intensities .
thus , each basis vector ( column of phis,n ) is analogous to the linear spatial receptive field of a binocular simple cell .
after learning , these basis vectors exhibit gabor - like structures and are in approximate spatial phase quadrature ( chandrapala and shi , 2014 ) .
as in the binocular energy model , the response rn ( xs,j ) combines the squared magnitudes of two binocular simple cells .
the magnitude of the response reflects the similarity between the binocular image patch and the binocular receptive fields .
the subspaces are initialized randomly and develop according to the update rules for the gassom algorithm described in chandrapala and shi ( 2014 ) .
the gassom exploits the concept of sparsity by using only one subspace to represent the input and captures the slowness by assuming that the subspace representing x ( t ) is more likely to be the same as the one that generated x ( t - 1 ) .
the model parameters , e.g. , the matrices phis,n , are learned in an unsupervised manner , by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data .
the update to each subspace is calculated by ( 3 ) deltaphis,n = sumjhs,n.x ~ s,j,n.xs,jtphis,nx ^ s,j,nxs,j where hs,n determines the amount that subspace phis,n is updated towards the observation , x ~ s,j,n = xj - x ^ s,j,n is the difference between the input xj and its projection onto subspace phis,n , where the projection is computed by x ^ s,j,n = phis,nphis,ntxj .
thus , each subspace at time t is updated by ( 4 ) phis,n ( t )= phis,n ( t - 1 )+ lambdadeltaphis,n ( t - 1 ) where lambda > 0 is the learning rate .
under the aec framework , both the gassom model parameters and the parameters of the vergence control policy ( described below ) are learned simultaneously .
vergence control mechanism the vergence control mechanism maps the visual input to a probability distribution over a discrete set of 11 possible vergence actions averg .
for the tsukuba environment , the 11 discrete vergence actions are averg = { - 16 , - 8 , - 4 , - 2 , - 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 } pixels , which modify the shift between the centers of the left and right sub - windows .
for the icub environment , the vergence actions are averg = { - 3.2 , - 1.6 , - 0.8 , - 0.4 , - 0.2 , 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.6 , 3.2 } degrees .
the vergence control policy is implemented by a two layer neural network .
the input to the network is a 3n - dimensional vector : ( 5 ) rverg = rcrmrf where for each s in { c , m , f } , rs in rn is obtained by spatially pooling the response maps of the feature detectors at scale s : ( 6 ) rs = 1psumj = 1pr1 ( xs,j )... 1psumj = 1prn ( xs,j ) where p = 100 is the number of the patches .
the output layer of the network contains 11 neurons , each corresponding to a possible vergence command .
the vector of activations to the output neurons , zverginr11 , is computed as : ( 7 ) zverg = thetatrverg where thetatinr972x11 is a matrix of synaptic weights .
the vector of probabilities for selecting the different vergence actions , piverginr11 , is calculated by applying a softmax operation to the activation vector zverg : ( 8 ) piverg = softmaxzverg / betaverg where the softmax function y = softmax ( z ) is defined component - wise by : ( 9 ) yi = expzisumk = 111expzk for i in { 1 , ...
, 11 } the temperature parameter , betaverg , balances exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning .
in the following experiments , betaverg is set to 1 .
the neural network weights develop according to the natural actor - critic reinforcement learning algorithm ( bhatnagar et al. , 2009 ) .
in our system , the reinforcement learner seeks a vergence control policy that minimizes the error in the perceptual representation of the sensory input , or equivalently maximizes the fidelity of the perceptual representation .
we define the instantaneous reward to be the negative of the average squared reconstruction error across the three scales , which is defined by ( 10 ) rverg = - eavg = - 13sumsinses where es is the mean squared reconstruction error at scale s averaged across all patches .
the reconstruction error of each patch is defined as the squared length of the residual between the input vector xs,j and its projection onto the best - fitting subspace : ( 11 ) es = 1psumj = 1pxs,j - phis,ms,jt.xs,j2 where ms,j is the index of the best - fitting subspace for xs,j , ( 12 ) ms,j = arg maxn phis,nt.xs,j2 .
the weight matrices of the value and policy networks are updated during fixation , but not across saccades .
saccade control mechanism binocular saliency model the binocular saliency map is generated using binocular attention based on information maximization ( baim ) , which we propose as a binocular extension of the aim model of bruce and tsotsos ( 2009 ) .
the baim architecture is illustrated in figure 3 .
in essence , we replace the monocular basis functions learned by ica in the aim model with the binocular basis functions learned by gassom .
whereas the monocular basis functions encode only texture information , the binocular basis functions used here jointly encode depth and texture information .
since our experiment use only gray scale images , we do not jointly encode color as in the experiments by bruce and tsotsos ( 2009 ) .
however , the extension to include color is straightforward , involving only an expansion of the size of the input vector .
figure 3 the architecture of the binocular attention based on information maximization ( baim ) .
the left and right parts of image patches and basis vectors are shown as 10 - by - 10 pixel images and aligned vertically .
red regions in the response maps and saliency maps correspond to high values while blue regions correspond to low values .
the red squares in the response maps represent the local area where response histograms are generated .
the computations to obtain the salience map are performed at the coarse scale .
we assign saliency values to 10 - by - 10 pixel patches , which are extracted with a stride of one .
given coarse scale images with size m1 x m2 , we obtain a 2d array of psal =( m1 - 9 ) x ( m2 - 9 ) binocular patches .
to obtain a saliency map at the original resolution , we use zero padding to increase the size of the coarse scale map to m1 x m2 pixels and then upsample by a factor of 4 .
the saliency value for the j - th coarse scale binocular image patch , s ( xc,j ) , is a measure of how informative or unlikely the responses of the gassom feature detectors are in the context of the responses from the other patches .
more specifically , it is the sum of saliency values computed for individual feature extractors in the gassom representation , sn ( xc,j ) : ( 13 ) sxc,j = sumn = 1nsnxc,j. the saliency of each feature extractor is the shannon self - information of the response : ( 14 ) snxc,j = - ln pnrc,nxc,j where pn [.] is the probability distribution of the responses of the n - th feature extractor at the coarse scale , which we estimate empirically using a histogram .
each response map is normalized to the range 0 - 1 .
the histogram of each response map is generated using k = psal equal width bins : ( 15 ) pnrc,nxc,j = alpha + 1 - alphasumk = 0k - 1hn ( k ). 1kk,k + 1krc,nxc,j where ( 16 ) 1a,bx = 1 ifxina,b0 ifxnot - ina,b is an indicator function with a and b as free parameters .
the parameter alpha = 10 - 6 is a small number that guarantees that the response probabilities are non - zero .
the coefficients ( 17 ) hn ( k ) = 1psalsumj = 1psal1kk,k + 1krnxc,j for kin0,1,2 ,... , k - 1 are empirical estimates of the probability that the response falls into the k - th bin computed over psal patches .
we considered both global binocular attention based on information maximization ( gbaim ) and local binocular attention based on information maximization ( lbaim ) versions of the saliency map , which differed according to patches used to estimate the coefficients hn ( k ) in eq .
17. in the gbaim model , the coefficients were computed by summing over all coarse scale patches .
in the lbaim model , the sum was over only the coefficients from a 31 x 31 array of patches centered around the current fixation point .
the lbaim model tends to favor patches where the gassom responses are more unlike those in the local neighborhood of the current fixation point .
to speed up computations , we use only a random subset of the gassom feature extractors to compute the sum in eq .
13. to determine the size of the subset , we computed the correlation coefficients ( ccs ) to measure the similarity between the saliency maps generated by random subsets of feature extractors and by all feature extractors .
the cc between two saliency maps s1 and s2 is defined as : ( 18 ) cc = sumjs1 ( xc,j ) - mu1s2 ( xc,j ) - mu2sumjs1 ( xc,j ) - mu12sumjs2 ( xc,j ) - mu22 where mu1 and mu2 are the mean saliencies in the maps .
figure 4 plots the ccs averaged over salience maps computed from 1,800 pairs of binocular images from the tsukuba dataset .
for each saliency map , the subsets of a certain number of feature extractors are chosen randomly from all 324 feature extractors .
using only 25 feature , extractors generates a baim saliency map that is very similar to the one using all 324 features .
thus , in our experiments , we sum over 25 randomly selected feature extractors .
figure 4 the average correlation coefficient ( cc ) values between the binocular attention based on information maximization ( baim ) saliency maps generated by all feature extractors and the saliency maps generated by different subsets of feature extractors .
a logarithmic scale is used on the x - axis .
error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals for the mean values of the ccs .
inhibition of return given the current fixation , a saccade target for the next fixation is generated by combining the saliency map at the full image resolution with a simple ior mechanism ( dorris et al. , 2002 ) , which prevents the system from saccading to recently visited image locations .
defining the full resolution saliency map by s ( j ) where j indexes the patch , we choose the next fixation point by sampling from the probability distribution ( 19 ) pj = sj.iorjsumksk.iork where ior (.) is a mask that suppresses recently visited image locations .
posner and cohen ( 1984 ) indicate that the currently attended region is inhibited for approximately 500 - 1,000 ms. since fixations last for 10 frames , and assuming a frame rate of 25 frames per second , we prevent the system from visiting the last two fixation points , resulting in a 800 ms long ior window .
assuming the indices of most recent and second most recent fixation locations are j1 and j2 , we set ( 20 ) iorj = fj,j1,sigma12.fj,j2,sigma22 where ( 21 ) fj,k,sigma2 = 1 - exp - pj - pk22sigma2 .
where pj is the 2d image location of patch j , sigma1 = 20 pixels and sigma2 = 10 pixels .
results baim - driven saccades accelerate vergence learning we compared the rate at which vergence control policies emerged and the quality of the final polices under different saccade control policies including a random policy where p ( m , n ) in eq .
19 was uniform over all image locations and policies where s ( m , n ) in eq .
19 was computed according to the saliency model of itti et al .
( 1998 ) , the aim model ( bruce and tsotsos , 2009 ) , and the gbaim and lbaim models proposed here.2 figure 5 shows the evolution of the root mean squared error ( rmse ) between the learned vergence control policies during training and the ideal policy that zeros out the input disparity in both the tsukuba and the icub environments .
for the tsukuba environment , we ran three training trials for each saccade control policy .
we set the same learning rate for the vergence control learner to make all the saccade methods comparable .
each trial used binocular inputs generated by disjoint sets of 120 randomly chosen stereo images , but we used the same image sets to train the different saccade policies .
we sampled the vergence policies at 20 equally spaced checkpoints during training .
at each checkpoint , we presented the policy with inputs with initial disparities ranging from - 20 to + 20 pixels and let the vergence policy run for 10 iterations .
the rmse in pixels was computed as the square root of the mean squared retinal disparity after 10 iterations averaged over all initial disparities and 100 inputs per disparity .
the images used to characterize the policies at all testing points and for all saccade policies were identical and disjoint from those used in training .
for the icub environment , we also ran three training trials for each saccade control policy .
each trial was conducted in a different randomly generated environment with disjoint sets of image textures mapped on to the surfaces .
the same environments were used to train under different saccade policies .
during testing , the icub was presented with frontoparallel surfaces at depths ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 m and textures disjoint from those used in training and allowed to verge for 10 iterations starting from initial vergence angles ranging from 0degrees to 10degrees .
the rmse of the final vergence angle was averaged over all depths and all initial vergence angles .

error bars indicate the sd computed over three training runs .
as shown in figure 5 , the random saccade policy performs the worst , resulting in the largest vergence control policy rmse at the end of training .
the two baim - driven saccade policies result in the best final performance .
although there is little difference between the two final policies , the lbaim model exhibits faster vergence learning , with a faster decrease in the rmse .
the two monocular saccade models result in vergence control policies with rmse values lying between those learned under random and binocularly driven saccades , with the aim model exhibiting slightly faster learning and lower final rmse .
figure 6 shows visualizations of the final policies learned in the tsukuba environment .
it is clear that the final vergence control policies learned using the baim - driven saccades are closer to the ground truth .
the " blurred " images for the policy learned using random and monocular saliency driven saccades indicate that the policies are less reliable in zeroing out the retinal disparity .

each policy is presented as an image .
the horizontal axis indicates the initial disparity and the vertical axis indicates the change in vergence after 10 iterations of the policy .
the intensity of each pixel corresponds to the probability of the change in vergence given the initial disparity , i.e. , the entries in each column sum to 1 .
for the ground truth policy , the change in vergence is always the negative of the initial disparity .
baim - driven saccades select image regions with higher entropy to understand better how the different saccade policies lead to vergence control policies with different performance , we examined the entropy of the image regions around the fixation points chosen by the different saccade policies .
the entropy is defined as : ( 22 ) e = - sumipilog2pi where pi is the probability of the pixel intensity value i , which is estimated from the histogram of pixel intensity values .
the entropy is a measure of the spread of gray values and is one measure of the information content .
image regions whose pixels all have the same intensity have zero entropy .
textured regions will have more variability in gray levels , and therefore a higher entropy .
intuitively , it will be harder to learn vergence from regions without texture ( with lower entropy ) .
figure 7 shows the median entropies computed over the 55 - by - 55 pixel fine scale sub - windows at the fixation points selected by the different saccade control methods .
the statistics were collected over 1,800 sub - window pairs .
for each of the 180 stereo image pairs obtained by taking every 10th frame from the 1,800 stereo image pairs in the tsukuba dataset , we ran the saccade / vergence policy learned after 100,000 iterations ( the first checkpoint in figure 5 ) for 10 fixations ( 100 frames ) , and averaged the entropies of the left and right sub - windows .
our testing results for the learned systems at other checkpoints were similar .

the error bars represent the sem .
baim - driven saccades lead to improved encoding of small disparities by selecting different fixation points , the different saccade policies expose the perceptual representation to binocular patches with different statistics .
since the feature extractors evolve to maximize the likelihood of the observed data , these differences in the input statistics will be reflected as differences in the learned feature extractors .
to study these differences , we learned feature detectors in the tsukuba environment using sub - windows centered at fixation points chosen by the different saccade control policies .
since differences in the vergence control policies will affect the input disparity statistics , we chose the vergence angles so that the retinal disparities d between the fixation points followed a discrete truncated laplacian distribution between - 40 and + 40 pixels : ( 23 ) pd = me - d / d,din - 40 , - 39 ,... , 40 where m is a normalization factor that ensures that p ( d ) sums to one .
the parameter d controls the spread of the input disparities .
this enabled us to isolate the effects of the saccade policies on the perceptual representations .
figure 8 shows the average reconstruction error eavg of the perceptual representations after training under different saccade control policies and assuming two different disparity statistics .
the values of eavg are plotted as a function of the retinal disparity at the fixation points .
they are computed by averaging the values of eavg computed according to eq .
10 over sub - windows taken at 1,000 fixation points from 100 images in the tsukuba dataset ( 10 fixations per image ) .
images used in testing were disjoint from those used in training .
figure 8 the average reconstruction error for the perceptual representations learned under different saccade control policies plotted as a function of the retinal disparity between the sub - windows .
the retinal disparity at the fixation points followed truncated laplacian distributions with parameters : ( a ) d = 50 and ( b ) d = 5 .
in general , the curves have a characteristic " v " shape , being symmetric around and achieving their minima at zero disparity .
this suggests that the perceptual representation is adapted to best represent binocular stimuli with zero disparity and that there are more feature extractors tuned to zero disparity .
there is no preference for positive or negative disparity stimuli .
these observations are consistent with the distribution of retinal disparities in the input , which is peaked at and symmetric around 0 .
the " v " shape indicates small reconstruction error at 0 and large average reconstruction error at large disparities .
the " v " shape is more pronounced the more tightly the input disparity statistics are clustered around zero disparity , which is obtained by choosing a smaller value of d in eq .
23. figure 9a shows the reconstruction error curves of the perceptual representations learned after joint learning under different saccade control policies .
the differences are much more pronounced , with curves corresponding to the baim - driven saccade policies exhibiting much more pronounced " v " shapes .
to quantify how pronounced those " v " shapes are , we fit the reconstruction error curves with the function ( 24 ) fa,mu,b,cd = c - a.exp - d - mub where c is a vertical offset , mu sets the location of the minimum , and a and b control the slope and depth of the " v ," respectively .
figure 9b shows one example of a fit .
we measure the sharpness of the " v " by the ratio a / b , which is the absolute value of the slope at mu. figure 9c shows the evolution of the slope during training under the different saccade control policies .
in all cases , the slope increases over time , indicating that the basis functions evolve so that they provide a better encoding of stimuli with zero disparity .
however , the rate and magnitude at which the slope increases are largest under the baim - driven saccade control policies .

( b ) the experimentally estimated reconstruction errors of local binocular attention based on information maximization ( lbaim ) and the corresponding curve fit .
( c ) the change of the slope a / b over the training process .
larger slopes indicate that the perceptual encoding exhibits a stronger preference for inputs with zero disparity .
error bars represent the sd computed over three training runs .
lbaim - driven saccades target locations with different disparities figure 5 indicates that the rmse of the final vergence control policies learned under the gbaim and lbaim saccade policies are similar , but that the vergence control policy emerges faster under lbaim .
the similarities between the reconstruction error curves and slope trajectories of the perceptual representations learned under gbaim and lbaim in figures 8 and 9 suggest that the faster learning is not due to differences in the perceptual representation .
rather , we suggest the learning is faster because lbaim presents more challenging vergence control stimuli to the system .
as a concrete example , figure 10 shows two examples of saliency maps computed by lbaim in the icub environment .
the maps were computed in the same environment , which had two objects with the same textures in front of the icub : one on the left at a closer distance and one on the right at a farther distance and partially occluded by the closer object .
figures 10a,b show example images from the left and right eye cameras .
the two saliency maps were computed assuming the icub was fixating either on the closer or the farther object .
comparing their intensities , we observe that points on the closer object become more salient when the icub is fixating on the farther object and vice versa .
figure 10 ( a,b ) left ( a ) and right ( b ) eye images obtained from the icub simulator when the robot was viewing two planar objects : one on the left which is closer and the other on the right which is farther .
( c,d ) examples of the local binocular attention based on information maximization ( lbaim ) saliency map computed with the icub fixating on the closer ( c ) and farther ( d ) objects .
bright regions correspond to high saliency .
the red points indicate the fixation point .
the red squares indicate the local area over which the empirical response histogram is computed .
for a more comprehensive and quantitative comparison , we estimated the expected absolute disparity difference between current and next fixations for different saliency models according to ( 25 ) deltad = 1psumi,jdi - djp ( i | j ) where i indexes all possible next fixations , j indexes the current fixation point , di is the disparity at i , and p is the number of current fixation points considered .
the term ( 26 ) pi | j = si | jsumksk | j is the probability of choosing the next fixation point i given the current fixation point j. it is similar to eq .
19 except that we do not include the ior and that we make explicit the dependency of the saliency map s ( i | j ) on the current fixation .
for all of the saliency mechanisms except lbaim , the saliency map does not change with the current fixation location .
the lbaim saliency model shows a clear preference toward selecting targets with disparities that are different from that at the current fixation point .
figure 11 shows the expected absolute disparity difference under different saccade policies normalized by the expected absolute disparity difference under the random saccade policy .
the expected differences were estimated from data in the tsukuba data set , for which ground truth disparity data are available .
we selected 200 binocular images randomly from the 1,800 image frames in the video of the tsukuba dataset .
for each binocular image , we computed the saliency maps at 10 fixation points ( i.e. , p = 2,000 ) .
figure 11 the estimated expected absolute disparity difference , deltad , for saccades generated by the different saliency models normalized by the expected difference estimated using random saccades .
the error bar represents the sd. change of reconstruction error within one fixation the average reconstruction error of the perceptual representation , eavg , plays a critical role in this system .
both the learning of the perceptual representation and the learning of the vergence control policy seek to minimize eavg .
large decreases in eavg during fixation suggest that the vergence control reinforcement learning is being exposed to " challenging " situations where there is potential for large changes in the reward .
figure 12a shows how the average decrease in eavg during fixation evolves over training under the different saccade control policies .
we define the normalized decrease across one fixation ( 10 frames ) as the difference between the values of eavg at the start and end of a fixation normalized by the value of eavg at the start of fixation , and compute the running average across 3,000 fixations .
the normalized decreases in eavg under the baim - driven saccade policies exhibit much larger and faster increases across training than the monocular saliency and random policies .
figure 12 ( a ) the running average of the normalized decrease in the average reconstruction error during fixation increases during training .
( b ) to isolate the effect of the saccade policy from differences in the perceptual representation and the vergence policy , we plot the normalized decrease in average reconstruction error when the same perceptual representation and vergence policy were used .
we isolated the effect of the choice of saccade target on the average normalized decrease in eavg by using the same perceptual representation and vergence policies during fixation , but choosing the initial fixation points according to the different saccade control policies .
in the results reported here , we used the perceptual representation and vergence policies learned by lbaim , but other choices gave similar results .
figure 12b shows that the ordering of the policies is preserved , but the relative differences between the curves for different saccade policies are smaller .
discussion we have described an integrated active vision system that combines vergence control learning with saccade control based on two novel binocular saliency models : lbaim and gbaim .
these models are based on binocular feature extractors that simultaneously encode both texture and depth information and that are computed in a way similar to the binocular energy model , a common computational model for disparity and orientation selective cells in the primary visual cortex .
the algorithm assigns high saliency to regions with high information content considering either the lbaim or gbaim context .
similar to the development of human infants , both the saccadic and vergence control policies in our model are immature at the start of simulation and emerge through interaction with the environment .
for the saccade policy , this is because the basis functions are randomly initialized .
for the vergence policy , this is because both the basis functions and the weights in the actor and critic networks are randomly initialized .
the order in which these policies emerge is the same as in humans .
in our simulation , the saccade policy develops before the vergence policy .
in humans , infants begin to look at edges or places with sharp and high - contrast features from 1 to 2 months of age ( bronson , 1990 , 1991 ; colombo , 2001 ) .
vergence develops at about 4 months of age ( aslin , 1977 ; hainline and riddell , 1995 ) .
however , the absolute time scale at which these behaviors emerge differs .
we measure the time it takes these policies to emerge in terms of fixations , since the number of iterations required by the model is somewhat arbitrary , as it depends upon the choice of the time step .
in our simulations , the vergence policies when following the lbaim saccade policy emerge after about 30,000 fixations ( 300,000 iterations ) ( figure 5 ) .
adult humans execute around 105 fixations / day,3 so this corresponds to 3 days for an adult , but we expect this number to be a bit larger as infants spend less time awake and their saccade policies are immature .
the saccade policy develops very quickly , after about 100 fixations ( see supplementary material ) , but this is largely due to the fact that it depends only on the basis functions , as much of the processing is hard coded in our model .
we expect that if we incorporated learning into more aspects of the saccade control policy as is likely the case in humans , we would obtain a much slower rate of emergence .
we could obtain simulations where vergence policies emerge on the same timescales as in humans by lowering the learning rate .
however , we did not do so to avoid excessively long computation time .
we are primarily interested in the relative rates , rather than absolute rates at which the policies emerge .
since we use the same learning rate in all simulations , the faster rate at which the vergence policy emerges when following the baim saccade policies indicates that the system is actively choosing inputs that allow for the most effective learning .
while it is clear that saccades are driven by a number of factors beyond obtaining effective inputs to train vergence control , our model does suggest a complementary , and hitherto largely unappreciated , potential role for saliency - driven saccadic eye movements .
our experimental results show that vergence control policies learned with saliency - driven saccades all exhibit higher accuracy and are learned faster than when saccades are driven randomly ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
the baim - driven saccade policies result in the highest accuracy and fastest learning .
the primary function of saccades ( and attention in general ) is commonly thought to direct the limited neural processing of an organism to more important stimuli .
our results suggest a new complementary role of saccades in aiding in the learning of behavior. through our experiments with this model , we have identified a number of different interacting factors that account for the improved performance and faster learning .
first , differences in the saccade policies expose the system to input patches with different statistics .
all of the attention - based saccade control models direct gaze toward image regions with higher entropy than encountered with randomly generated saccades ( figure 7 ) .
patches selected by the lbaim models have the highest entropy , followed by the gbaim , itti , and aim models .
second , since the perceptual representations adapt to the input statistics , these differences lead to differences in the perceptual representations .
higher entropy patches contain more texture , which provides more visual cues to disparity .
perceptual representations learned using higher entropy patches encode differences between zero and non - zero disparities better .
figure 8 shows the dependency between the reconstruction error and the input disparity for the different perceptual representations .
the differences between the reconstruction errors for zero and non - zero disparities follow the same trend as the entropy , being the smallest for the random policy , and the largest for the lbaim and gbaim policies .
the difference also depends upon the statistics of the disparities of the input patches , increasing the more the disparities are concentrated around zero disparity ( smaller values of d in eq. 23 ) .
the magnitude of the reconstruction error at zero disparity shows the opposite trend , achieving the largest value for the random policy and the smallest values for the baim - based policies .
third , the differences between the reconstruction error curves in figure 8 are amplified during joint learning by a positive feedback loop setup by the interaction between the learning of the perceptual representation and the learning of vergence control .
both learners seek to maximize the same reward : the average negative reconstruction error of the perceptual representation .
initially , the disparity statistics will be similar , since the vergence policies are initialized with random weights .
the different saccade policies will result in slightly different reconstruction error curves .
the lower reconstruction error at zero disparity and the larger difference between the reconstruction error at non - zero and zero disparities for the baim - driven saccade control will cause the reinforcement learner to favor more strongly the emergence of vergence policies that seek to 0 out the retinal disparity , resulting in a slightly better vergence control policy .
in turn , the better vergence policies cause the distribution of retinal disparities presented to the perceptual representation to be more tightly clustered around 0 .
the perceptual representation will respond by allocating more basis functions to represent zero disparity inputs .
this further reduces the reconstruction error for zero disparity inputs and increases the difference at non - zero and zero disparities .
this in turn improves vergence control and the cycle continues .
figure 9a shows the net effect of this positive feedback loop by plotting the reconstruction error curves of the perceptual representations learned after joint learning under different saccade control policies .
the differences between the perceptual representations are much more pronounced , with curves corresponding to the baim - driven saccades policies exhibiting much more pronounced " v " shapes .
figure 9b shows the dynamic evolution of the slope of the " v " shape at its minimum point , which is a measure of the difference in reconstruction error at zero and non - zero disparities .
small initial differences expand rapidly under the positive feedback .
finally , the baim - driven saccades direct the system to focus on more " challenging " situations , i.e. , those with larger initial retinal disparity or those where the potential change in the reward are larger .
in particular , we find that the lbaim algorithm , by emphasizing saccade targets that are different from the current fixation , exposes the system to a wider diversity of input patch textures and input disparities , which drives faster learning .
intuitively , saccades between targets at different depths will present more challenges for vergence control , since they require larger change in vergence angle between the two eyes .
in our system , vergence angle is preserved across saccades .
thus , saccades to locations with the same absolute disparity as the current fixation will require no change in vergence angle , presenting less of a challenge to the vergence control policy than saccades to targets with a different absolute disparity .
the primary difference between the lbaim and gbaim saliency models is that for the lbaim model , the saliency depends upon the current fixation point , whereas for the gbaim model , saliency is independent of the current fixation point .
this dependency is introduced due to the data used to compute the coefficients of the empirical response histogram ( eq. 17 ) .
for the lbaim model , points whose feature extractor responses are different from those around the current fixation point will be more salient .
since the feature extractors encode disparity , this implies that points with disparity different from the current fixation point will be more salient under lbaim .
thus , we observe greater differences in disparity between adjacent fixations ( figure 11 ) .
we also observe larger reductions in reconstruction error during fixations ( figure 12 ) .
these larger decreases are due to the combination of a number of factors identified earlier .
first , the same reduction in retinal disparity will result in a larger decrease in the reconstruction error for the baim policies , due to the more pronounced " v " shape of the reconstruction error curves for the baim policy .
second , the better quality of the vergence control policies learned under baim will result in larger changes in retinal disparity .
third , the choice of saccade targets will influence the change in two ways. by choosing saccade targets with larger entropy , the effect of changes in the retinal disparity on the visual input will be more pronounced , leading to larger changes in eavg .
in addition , choosing initial fixation points with larger retinal disparity will result in larger changes in eavg .
this final factor likely accounts for much of the difference between lbaim and gbaim .
future work will focus on learning all aspects of the saccade and vergence policies simultaneously and under a common parsimonious framework provided by active efficient encoding .
for example , although the baim saliency maps adapt to the statistics of the sensory input because of changes in the binocular feature detectors learned by the gassom algorithm , the way in which the feature detector outputs are integrated to construct the saliency maps is hard coded .
we are currently investigating how to learn how to combine feature map outputs to generate saccade policies .
in addition , our model of saccades and vergence can be made more realistic .
in humans , some of the required vergence change takes place during the saccade ( coubard , 2013 ) , with the remaining disparity canceled by vergence changes after the saccade .
our current model is a simplification of this , since there is no change in vergence during the saccade .
it will also be interesting to extend the framework here to include these initial vergence changes by incorporating an estimate of the disparity of the target .

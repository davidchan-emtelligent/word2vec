background amphiregulin , a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , is associated with the efficacy of cetuximab , an antibody against egfr , as treatment for colorectal cancer ( crc ) .
in contrast , the her3 ligand heregulin correlates with cetuximab resistance .
in this study , we evaluated how the combined levels of circulating amphiregulin and heregulin affect clinical outcomes in patients who receive cetuximab as therapy against advanced crc .
methods plasma levels of amphiregulin and heregulin were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay in 50 patients with crc in a training cohort , and in 10 patients in a validation cohort .
the combined expression was then assessed with clinical outcome after receiver operating characteristics analysis .
results overall response rate was 26 % , and median progression - free survival was 110 days in the training cohort .
patients with high amphiregulin and low heregulin had significantly higher objective response rate at 58 % and significantly longer progression - free survival of 216 days .
this result was confirmed in the validation cohort .
conclusion a subgroup of crc patients with high amphiregulin and low heregulin respond to cetuximab therapy better than other patients .

introduction colorectal cancers ( crc ) frequently overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis [ 1 ] .
thus , egfr is a therapeutic target , not just against crc , but also against other cancers in which it is abundantly expressed .
therapeutic agents that target egfr are either egfr - tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies [ 2 ] .
kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib are highly effective against non - small cell lung cancers with constitutively active egfr mutations [ 3 ] .
on the other hand , monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab improve the prognosis in patients with crc and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that express wild type egfr [ 4 - 7 ] .
preclinical studies show that some cancers sensitive to anti - egfr therapy also abundantly express egfr ligands , especially amphiregulin [ 8 ] .
as a result , egfr is constitutively activated in these cells by autocrine fashion .
notably , patients with crcs that abundantly express amphiregulin experience significantly better outcomes with cetuximab therapy than patients with low crc expression of amphiregulin [ 9 , 10 ] .
indeed , levels of amphiregulin in the plasma are associated with cetuximab efficacy [ 11 ] .
heregulin , also ligand of her3 , is also highly expressed in some crcs , and in some lung , head , and neck cancers [ 12 - 15 ] .
physiologically , heregulin binds to her3 and triggers heterodimerization between her2 and her3 , an event that activates both receptors [ 16 , 17 ] .
in turn , her3 activates akt , and thereby prevents apoptosis .
published data show that overexpression of heregulin causes cetuximab resistance in crc , although simultaneous inhibition of her2 and her3 overcomes this resistance [ 13 , 18 ] .
in addition , plasma heregulin is negatively correlated with progression free - survival and overall survival in crc patients undergoing cetuximab therapy .
clearly , amphiregulin and heregulin significantly impact the prognosis of crc patients treated with cetuximab .
however , clinical outcomes are not always explained by one factor or the other .
some crc patients abundantly expressing amphiregulin , as well as others with low levels of heregulin , do not respond to cetuximab [ 11 , 13 ] .
a possible reason might be that these molecules interact .
indeed , previous studies demonstrate that while the crc cell line difi abundantly expresses amphiregulin and is sensitive to cetuximab , stable transfection with heregulin causes resistance [ 18 ] .
therefore , we examined whether the combined level of circulating amphiregulin and heregulin could more reliably predict clinical outcomes of cetuximab therapy in crc patients .
materials and methods patients and treatment the study included patients treated for metastatic crc at kinki university school of medicine between september 2010 and august 2015 .
patients had received folfiri ( leucovorin , 5 - fluorouracil , and irinotecan ) or folfox ( leucovorin , 5 - fluorouracil , and oxaliplatin ) as first - or second - line chemotherapy .
most patients had additionally received bevacizumab , but not antibodies against egfr .
as third - line chemotherapy , patients were treated every two weeks with cetuximab , alone or in combination with irinotecan .
unless adjusted by the attending physician , cetuximab was administered at an initial dose of 400 mg / m2 and then at 250 mg / m2 weekly .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of kinki university school of medicine .
written informed consent was obtained from all patients .
patients were divided into a training cohort of 50 , and a validation cohort of 10 .
measurement of plasma amphiregulin and heregulin plasma samples were drawn from patients prior to treatment with anti - egfr .
amphiregulin and heregulin levels were measured using commercially available enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay kits ( human amphiregulin and heregulin quantikine elisa kits , r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) , following the manufacturer 's instructions .
briefly , a 96 - well microplate was coated with capture antibody , washed , and incubated with samples and standards .
the plate was washed a second time , probed with detection antibody , and labeled with a chromogen .
finally , absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometric plate reader .
amphiregulin and heregulin concentrations were determined based on standard curves .
assessment of cetuximab treatment objective response to cetuximab was evaluated according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors , ver .
1.1 [ 19 ] .
tumor response was evaluated by a physician every 2 to 3 months using computed tomography .
progression - free survival was defined as the interval from the initiation of anti - egfr therapy to tumor progression or death without evidence of progression .
overall survival was measured as the number of days between the start of cetuximab regimen and death .
statistical analyses the primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate amphiregulin and heregulin as biomarkers associated with objective response rate to anti - egfr therapy .
roc ( receiver operating characteristics ) curves were analyzed to determine cut - off points for amphiregulin and heregulin expression .
the optimum cut - off points were defined as the minimum distance from ( 1 - specificity , sensitivity ) = ( 0 , 1 ) .
differences in the distribution of variables were evaluated using t test for quantitative variables and fisher 's exact test for qualitative variables .
for groups classified according to cut - off points , objective response rate was compared by fisher 's exact test , while progression - free and overall survival were compared by kaplan - meier curves and log - rank test .
all statistical tests were two - sided , and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
statistical analyses and visualization were performed in graphpad prism v.5.0 for windows ( graphpad software , inc. , la jolla , ca , usa ) .
results patient characteristics patient characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
all patients had wild - type kras. of the 50 patients analyzed , 39 received cetuximab and irinotecan as third - line chemotherapy .
however , all other patients received cetuximab alone because of poor general health or fluid retention .
thirteen patients experienced partial response to cetuximab .
thus , the overall response rate was 26 % .
eighteen patients had stable tumors for more than 8 weeks , while 19 patients had short - term cancer progression .
the overall disease control rate was 62 % .
median progression - free and overall survival were 110 days and 201 days , respectively .
treatment was discontinued for all patients because of cancer progression , except for three patients who moved to a different hospital .
toxicity was not apparent .
there were no significant differences in response rate when patients were stratified by for each variable , including age , sex , primary tumor site , ecog ps , and regimen ( fisher 's exact test , p > 0.05 , s1 table ) .

circulating amphiregulin and heregulin amphiregulin and heregulin concentrations in the plasma are shown in fig 1a and 1b , with median 11.5 pg / ml ( range 0 - 327 pg / ml ) and 1,357.5 pg / ml ( range 0 - 18,045 pg / ml ) , respectively .
correlation between the concentrations of these molecules was not observed ( pearson correlation r = 0.067 ) , and levels were not significantly correlated with patient characteristics including sex , age , primary tumor site , performance status , and treatment regimen ( table 2 , t test , p > 0.05 ) .
amphiregulin level tends to be higher in cetuximab - responsive patients , while heregulin level is significant lower in resistant patients ( t test , p = 0.001 ) .
thus , we performed roc analyses to determine cutoff points at which amphiregulin and heregulin have optimum sensitivity and specificity to predict response or non - response to cetuximab , respectively ( fig 1c and 1d ) .
at 16.8 pg / ml , amphiregulin had sensitivity 76.9 % ( 95 % ci : 46.2 % - 95.0 %) and specificity 67.6 % ( 95 % ci : 50.2 % - 82.0 %) .
using this cutoff point , 22 patients ( 44 %) were considered amphiregulin positive for predicting response with response rate 45 % ( 10 / 22 ) .
on the other hand , heregulin expression at 1292 pg / ml had sensitivity 62.2 % ( 95 % ci : 44.8 % - 77.5 %) and specificity 69.2 % ( 95 % ci : 38.6 % - 90.9 %) .
based on this cutoff point , 27 patients ( 54 %) were considered heregulin positive for predicting non - response with response rate is 15 % ( 4 / 27 ) .

association of amphiregulin and heregulin with cetuximab response we investigated whether the combined level of plasma amphiregulin and heregulin was associated with response to anti - egfr therapy ( table 3 ) .
we categorized patients into four classes depending on whether expression of each molecule was high or low , with cutoff values set by roc analysis ( fig 2 ) .
thus , 15 patients were considered to have low amphiregulin and high heregulin , while 13 were considered to have low levels of both. of the remaining patients , 10 were categorized as having high levels of both , and 12 were described as having high amphiregulin and low heregulin .
objective response rate was evaluated in each class .
in patients that abundantly express amphiregulin but not heregulin , the objective response rate was 58 % .
notably , this response rate is significantly different ( p = 0.0069 , fisher 's exact test ) from the 16 % response rate in other patients ( n = 38 ) .
furthermore , the response rate was 7 % in patients with low amphiregulin and high heregulin , 15 % in patients with low amphiregulin and low heregulin , and 30 % in patients that express both ligands abundantly .

heregulin amphiregulin low high low 15 % 58 % high 7 % 30 % association of plasma amphiregulin and heregulin with survival we analyzed the impact of amphiregulin and heregulin levels on progression - free and overall survival .
consistent with better response rates , patients who abundantly express amphiregulin but not heregulin experienced significantly longer progression - free survival than other patients ( log - rank test , p < 0.05 ) , with median 216 days and 81 days , respectively ( fig 3 ) .
patients that express both molecules at high levels experienced a median of 65 progression - free days , while those that express both at low levels had median progression - free survival of 119 days .
finally , patients who have low amphiregulin and high heregulin had median 76 progression - free days ( fig a in s1 file ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0143132.g003 fig 3 kaplan - meier progression - free survival curves .
plasma levels of amphiregulin and heregulin were measured by elisa .
patients are divided into subgroups based on amphiregulin ( ar ) or heregulin ( hrg ) abundance , as shown in fig 2 .
the red curve represents survival in patients with high amphiregulin and low heregulin ( n = 12 ) , and the green line represents survival in all other patients ( n = 38 ) .
these trends are reflected in overall survival .
thus , patients with high levels of amphiregulin and low levels of heregulin tended to experience longer overall survival than other patients with median 356 days ( fig 4 ) .
those with low or high levels of both molecules survived for a median of 231 and 164 days , respectively .
finally , patients who express heregulin abundantly but not amphiregulin had median overall survival of 150 days ( fig b in s1 file ) .

survival in all other patients ( n = 38 ) is plotted in green .
plasma amphiregulin , heregulin , and cetuximab response in a validation cohort we validated the association of both ligands with cetuximab response using an independent set of 10 patients .
three of these patients had high amphiregulin and low heregulin , while three had low amphiregulin and high heregulin. of the remaining patients , three expressed both ligands at low levels , and one expressed both abundantly ( fig c in s1 file ) .
three patients were responsive to anti - egfr therapy , all of whom had high amphiregulin but not heregulin ( table 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0143132.t004 table 4 objective response rate in the validation cohort .
heregulin amphiregulin low high low 0 % ( 0 / 3 ) 100 % ( 3 / 3 ) high 0 % ( 0 / 3 ) 0 % ( 0 / 1 ) discussion we and others have previously reported that egfr ligands , especially amphiregulin , are associated with cetuximab efficacy [ 8 - 10 ] .
in contrast , the her3 ligand heregulin was significantly correlated with cetuximab resistance [ 13 , 18 ] .
this study is the first to examine whether the combined expression of amphiregulin and heregulin affects the outcome of anti - egfr therapy in crc patients .
we found that patients with high levels of amphiregulin and low levels of heregulin respond significantly better to cetuximab , with 58 % objective response rate and 216 days median progression - free survival .
the response is notably better than the published overall response in the general crc population [ 4 , 20 , 21 ] .
these results were validated in a smaller , but independent cohort , and suggest that assessment of both amphiregulin and heregulin in the plasma may more precisely predict cetuximab outcome , and may thus provide a basis for optimizing crc treatments .
in contrast , patients that abundantly express both amphiregulin and heregulin experience poor outcomes .
this clinical observation is consistent with laboratory experiments using the crc cell line difi [ 18 ] .
indeed , difi cells with high levels of amphiregulin have increased sensitivity to cetuximab , whereas cell overexpressing heregulin are resistant to cetuximab in vitro and in mouse xenografts .
therefore , patients with these characteristics may require additional , new , or alternative treatments to overcome resistance .
for example , it has been demonstrated that cells overexpressing heregulin are sensitive to a combination of cetuximab and patritumab , an antibody against her3 , even though each antibody on its own is ineffective [ 18 ] .
alternatively , combining cetuximab with a downstream inhibitor of her3 may prove also prove effective .
such compounds include inhibitors of pi3k and akt .
notably , three patients with low levels of amphiregulin also responded to cetixumab , suggesting that egfr is activated by other ligands in a small group of patients .
indeed , egfr is known to bind six different ligands , including egf , transforming growth factor - alpha , amphiregulin , betacelluline , heparin - binding egf , or epiregulin [ 8 ]. of these , epiregulin expression in tumors has been found to also correlate with cetuximab efficacy [ 9 , 10 ] .
in the end , all egfr ligands may have to be evaluated to predict cetuximab response .
however , this study is limited by small sample sizes , and the retrospective nature of the analysis .
to address these limitations , we are now conducting a prospective randomized clinical trial of anti - egfr therapy in advanced crc patients , in which we measure clinical outcome as a function of plasma amphiregulin and heregulin .
we anticipate that this trial will provide more evidence of the use of amphiregulin and heregulin as biomarkers .

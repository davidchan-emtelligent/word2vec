abstract objective to identify factors associated with not attempting resuscitation .
methods a cross - sectional study conducted at the emergency department of a teaching hospital .
the sample consisted of 285 patients ; in that , 216 were submitted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 69 were not .
the data were collected by means of the in - hospital utstein style .
to compare resuscitation attempts with variables of interest we used the chi2 test , likelihood ratio , fisher exact test , and analysis of variance ( p < 0.05 ) .
results no cardiopulmonary resuscitation was considered unjustifiable in 56.5 % of cases ; in that , 37.7 % did not want resuscitation and 5.8 % were found dead. of all patients , 22.4 % had suffered a previous cardiac arrest , 49.1 % were independent for activities of daily living , 89.8 % had positive past medical / surgical history ; 63.8 % were conscious , 69.8 % were breathing and 74.4 % had a pulse upon admission .
most events ( 76.4 %) happened at the hospital , the presumed cause was respiratory failure in 28.7 % and , in 48.4 % , electric activity without pulse was the initial rhythm .
the most frequent cause of death was infection .
the factors that influenced non - resuscitation were advanced age , history of neoplasm and the initial arrest rhythm was asystole .
conclusion advanced age , past history of neoplasia and asystole as initial rhythm were factors that significantly influenced the non - performance of resuscitation .
greater clarity when making the decision to resuscitate patients can positively affect the quality of life of survivors .

keywords heart arrest cardiopulmonary resuscitation / ethics resuscitation orders decision making / ethics emergency service , hospital descritores parada cardiaca reanimacao cardiopulmonar / etica ordens quanto a conduta ( etica medica ) tomada de decisoes / etica servico hospitalar de emergencia introduction it is estimated that 200,000 individuals are attended at the emergency departments in brazil every year due to cardiac arrest , and half of them occur in hospital settings .
mortality data are scarce though. ( 1 ) cardiac arrest is a severe and often fatal problem , and its reversion demands immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ).( 2 ) when cpr is applied to patients beyond the possibilities of cure , death can be postponed , and the state of persistent coma can be determined , with disastrous consequences for the patient , family and community. ( 3 ) in brazil , the do not attempt resuscitation orders have no legal support , obliging healthcare professionals to apply cpr in all situations , except if death is obvious .
this imposes the need for standardized conducts , taking into account moral and ethical aspects of each situation , aiming for the individual 's wellbeing. ( 2 ) emergency treatment is needed when an individual is confronted with the real possibility of death , severe body injury or deterioration of health status , resulting from a sudden , unexpected situation and not from a chronic and incurable disease. ( 4 ) nevertheless , the decision not to resuscitate can be difficult for the health team , due to a lack of research in this area , lack of formal training to recognize these situations , and differences in attitudes and personal values. ( 5 ) in some cases , cpr can result in unexpected consequences that are worse than death .
for patients , it can cause physical discomfort and an unacceptable quality of life ; for family members , it can entail false hope and extremely high costs ; for professionals involved , feelings of frustration and sadness and , for society , exaggerated resource consumption. ( 6 ) anticipated guidelines for end - of - life care and the documentation of the patient 's preferences in these circumstances can minimize this situation , reduce the number of unnecessary reanimations , keep the patient 's dignity and reduce suffering of family members and healthcare team. ( 6 ) objective to identify possible factors associated with no attempt to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
methods it is cross - sectional study , undertaken at the emergency department of a teaching hospital that provided high - complexity care .
this study was approved by the institutional review board at the universidade federal de sao paulo ( protocol number 0030 / 2011 ) .
the study population consisted of patients seen at the emergency department and diagnosed as cardiac arrest , confirmed based on unconsciousness , absence of breathing and central pulse .
a convenience sample was obtained between january 1st , 2011 and january 31st , 2012 .
the inclusion criteria were cardiac arrest patients at or outside the hospital , seen at the emergency department during the study period .
the exclusion criteria were cardiac arrest patients seen at other units of the hospital .
in this study , cpr was defined as the application of basic life - support maneuvers ( ventilation , external thoracic compression and defibrillation ) and / or advanced life - support maneuvers ( tracheal intubation and medication ) .
figure 1 presents the patient 's flowchart .
figure 1 flowchart of patients in the study cpr : cardiopulmonary resuscitation ; rosc : return of spontaneous circulation ; gp - cpc : glasgow - pittsburgh cerebral performance category trained nurses collected the data , using the in - hospital utstein style ,( 7 ) a standard report to collect significant data in cardiac arrest .
the following sociodemographic and clinical variables studied were sex , age , skin color , pre - cardiac arrest neurological condition , past medical / surgical history , level of consciousness , breathing and pulse upon admission to emergency department .
the variables related to the cardiac arrest were place of occurrence , presence of witnesses , presumed immediate cause , initial rhythm of cardiac arrest , cpr attempt and cause of death .
to analyze the data , the software statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) version 19 was used .
for patients with more than one cardiac arrest , the data for the first event were collected .
frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables .
number of valid observations ( n ) , mean and standard deviation ( sd ) were presented for continuous numerical variables .
to compare the cpr attempts with categorical variables ( sex , skin color , past history , conscious upon admission , breathing upon admission , pulse present upon admission , pre - cardiac arrest cerebral performance category ( cpc ) , place of event , witnesses , immediate cause , initial rhythm and cause of death ) , the chi2 test was used .
when the values of 20 % or more of the boxes were less than five , the odds ratio or fisher 's exact test were used .
to compare the cpr attempts with continuous variable ( age ) , analysis of variance ( anova ) was used , after verifying homogeneity of the variances .
the level of significance considered was 5 % ( p value < 0.05 ) .
results the sample consisted of 285 patients , of which 216 were submitted to cpr .
among the patients who were not submitted to cpr ( n = 69 ) , in 56.5 % , the cpr was considered unjustifiable , 37.7 % did not want resuscitation and , in 5.8 % of the cases , the patients were found dead .

cpc : glasgow - pittsburgh cerebral performance category ; sd : standard deviation .
the factors that were significantly associated with high rates of cpr attempts were as follows : breathing and pulse present upon admission ; low scores in the pre - cardiac arrest cpc ; absence of neoplasms , past history of diabetes mellitus ; cardiac arrest outside the hospital ; arrhythmia and ischemia / stroke as a presumed cause of cardiac arrest , and ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity as the initial cardiac arrest rhythm .
patients of more advanced age , with other factor as a presumed cause of cardiac arrest and with asystole as initial cardiac arrest rhythm were less submitted to cpr attempts .
discussion although some years have gone since the publication of studies on do not attempt resuscitation orders , inconsistency remains in the interpretation of these orders , which can cause confusion regarding the clinical situations they apply , and difficulties in terms of defining the best end - of - life care. ( 5 , 7 ) these difficulties are even greater in cases of cardiac arrest because the events can occur suddenly , without knowing the patients' history .
in addition , do not attempt resuscitation orders refer to the accomplishment or not of cpr efforts , without considering pre - existing diseases , the objectives of care and the patient 's desires. ( 7 ) in this study , the factors that significantly influenced the accomplishment or not of cpr were advanced age , past history , neurological status before cardiac arrest , place of cardiac arrest , breathing and pulse upon admission , immediate cause and initial rhythm of cardiac arrest , and cause of death .
also , patients of more advanced age were less frequently submitted to cpr attempts .
a multicenter study undertaken in the united states to verify the influence of post - cardiac arrest care in patients aged over 75 years demonstrated that these elderly were more prone to do not attempt resuscitation orders ( 65.9 % versus 48.2 % , p < 0.001 ) and the removal of advanced life - support measures ( 61.2 % versus 47.5 % , p = 0.005 ) .
however , after 6 - month follow - up , the survivors preserved a favorable neurological status ( cpc 1 and 2 ) , similar to younger patients. ( 8 ) the advanced age seems to influence the nonresuscitation orders ,( 9 ) which may be associated with the presence of more comorbidities and a bad quality of life after cpr in this population. ( 8 ) nevertheless , the results appoint that age as an isolated factors for non - resuscitation decisions may not be reliable , as the treatment targets should be considered , as well as the fact that the higher mortality may be related to the suspension of advanced care , and even to the do not attempt resuscitation orders attributed to these individuals. ( 8 , 10 ) as regards to past history , patients with a history of diabetes mellitus and no history of cancer showed a higher percentage of cpr attempts .
a prospective study of 1,446 patients at a university hospital in geneva , aiming to determine the prevalence of do not attempt resuscitation orders and related factors , among medical professionals , evidenced that the presence of cancer diagnosis was associated with more do not attempt resuscitation order prescribed by these professionals .
most decisions , however , were made instinctively , with no clear treatment objectives and goals ,( 9 ) which may suggest that the meaning , objectives and application of the non - resuscitation orders should be systematically discussed at the universities that offer healthcare programs , presented as protocols and documented at the organizations , entailing safer decision - making and care for these patients. ( 9 ) in this study , patients with lower pre - cardiac arrest cpc levels showed a higher percentage of cpr attempts .
some studies indicated poor quality of life before and after cpr as an independent factor associated with do not attempt resuscitation orders .
in addition , patients with cognitive deficits may not be capable of participating in the decisions on their health status .
the use of scales to assess the patient neurological status and quality of life can minimize this issue. ( 9 ) in the study population , patients who were victims of cardiac arrest out of hospital and who presented breathing or pulse upon admission showed a higher percentage of cpr attempts .
this finding can be attributed to the sudden nature of the cardiac arrest and to the professionals' lack of knowledge on these patients' medical history .
in addition , in cases of out - of - hospital cardiac arrest , care may be first provided by laymen , who are not skilled and authorized to decide about do not attempt resuscitation orders. ( 11 , 12 ) in the present study , patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless electrical activity as the initial cardiac arrest rhythm showed a higher percentage of cpr attempts , whereas those with asystole showed a higher percentage of no cpr attempt .
the do not attempt resuscitation orders may have been less common in patients with ventricular fibrillation , as this initial cardiac arrest rhythm was associated with a greater probability of return to spontaneous circulation and better long - term neurological outcomes - provided that cpr and early defibrillation are provided. ( 8 , 13 , 14 ) in the patients for whom arrhythmia , ischemia or stroke were the presumed immediate causes , the percentage of cpr attempts was higher .
this finding may be related to the fact that cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in the adult population around the world , and it is associated with sudden events , such as stroke , ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest , in which the patient 's medical history is unknown , with no consensus and security in application of do not attempt resuscitation orders. ( 15 ) death is one of the most controversial issues in modern society , for cultural , economic and social reasons .
healthcare professionals also demonstrate difficulties when dealing with this situation , often because they are not prepared for their own death. ( 10 ) in this context , the do not attempt resuscitation orders should be reconsidered in accordance with the ethical principles of beneficence and non - maleficence , engaging the patients and all people who effectively take care of them , with clear objectives and goals for patients receiving end - of - life care , and providing for a dignified death , with as much and timely comfort as possible. ( 10 ) in many cases , cpr has no physiological utility , that is , it may not offer benefits to cure the underlying disease .
however , it is useful in legal terms , for taking into account the patient 's perspective .
more informed decision - making on whether to reanimate or not can positively affect the survivors' quality of life .
the difference between do not attempt resuscitation orders and the objectives and goals of end - of - life care to patients with untreatable diseases is not clear yet. ( 9 , 16 ) the professionals often make this decision based on each person 's life experience and knowledge level , which can impede care delivery to certain patients. ( 5 ) the results of this study can help elaborate specific guidelines for do not attempt resuscitation orders , clarifying information to the population about the legitimacy of these orders , and allowing patients to use this right to care and good practices. ( 10 ) the main limitation of this study was the small number of patients , but its strengths were to be performed at a university reference and high - complexity hospital , and the prospective data collection , which involved consecutive patients .
conclusion of the patients who were not submitted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation , in the majority of the cases , this procedure was considered unjustifiable .
the factors that significantly influenced the non - accomplishment of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were patient 's advanced age , past history of cancer , and asystole as the initial cardiac arrest rhythm .

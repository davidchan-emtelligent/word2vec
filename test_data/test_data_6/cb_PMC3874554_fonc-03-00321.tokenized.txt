p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) , an atp - binding cassette , is able to transport structurally and chemically unrelated substrates .
over - expression of p - gp in cancer cells significantly decreases the intercellular amount of anticancer drugs , and results in multidrug resistance in cancer cells , a major obstacle in cancer chemotherapy .
p - gp is mainly localized on the plasma membrane and functions as a drug efflux pump ; however , p - gp is also localized in many intracellular compartments , such as endoplasmic reticulum , golgi , endosomes , and lysosomes .
p - gp moves between the intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane in a microtubule - actin dependent manner .
this review highlights our current understanding of ( 1 ) the intracellular localization of p - gp ; ( 2 ) the traffic and cycling pathways among the cellular compartments as well as between these compartments and the plasma membrane ; and ( 3 ) the cellular factors regulating p - gp traffic and cycling .
this review also presents a potential implication in overcoming p - gp - mediated multidrug resistance by targeting p - gp traffic and cycling pathways and impairing p - gp localization on the plasma membrane .
p - glycoprotein intracellular localization traffic recycling cell polarization multidrug resistance in cancer introduction p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) , a 170 kda membrane protein , is a member of sub - family b of the atp - binding cassette ( abc ) transporter superfamily , and is also called abcb1 .
p - gp has two structurally identical halves .
its n - terminal half contains six transmembrane domains , followed by a large cytoplasmic domain with an atp - binding site .
similarly , the c - terminal half also has six transmembrane domains and an atp - binding site ( 1 , 2 ) .
plasma membrane located p - gp is able to transport many chemically and structurally unrelated substrates out of the cells , and acts as an efflux pump ( 1 , 2 ) .
p - gp is primarily expressed in the liver , kidney , gastrointestinal tract , and blood brain barrier .
p - gp is located on the canalicular apical membrane of hepatocytes in the liver ; on the brush border of proximal tubule cells in the kidney ; and on the apical membrane of mucosal cells in the small intestine ( 3 ) .
given the transporting function of p - gp , these tissue distributions allow p - gp to excrete endogenous metabolites , exogenous substrates , and toxins into the urine , bile , and feces .
thus , p - gp can protect the organism as well as eliminate cellular wastes ( 3 , 4 ) .
furthermore , another essential localization of p - gp is on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier which prevents cytotoxins from penetrating the endothelium and protects brain ( 5 ) .
although animal well - being , normal physiological function , and life span were not affected after p - gp was knocked out in mice , higher drug sensitivity and increased drug side effect / toxicity occurred ( 6 ) .
while knocking out p - gp appears to be less problematic , over - expression of p - gp causes major concerns in clinical oncology .
the most notable consequence of over - expression of p - gp in clinic is to cause multiple drug resistance ( mdr ) in cancer chemotherapy ( 2 ) .
given p - gp has a structurally broad range of substrates , the occurrence of mdr during chemotherapy is one of the big challenges for successful cancer treatment in clinic .
mdr can be either intrinsic , occurring in cancers that have not been exposed to chemotherapy before but derived from tissue naturally expressing p - gp ( e.g. , liver , kidney , intestinal cancers ) , or required mdr , which develops after cancers are treated with chemotherapy ( 7 ) .
nearly half of human cancers express p - gp at levels sufficient to develop mdr .
the likelihood of failure in chemotherapy is increased when p - gp expression is upregulated during therapy ( 8 ) .
intracellular localization of p - gp p - glycoprotein is primarily localized on the plasma membrane for its efflux function , however , it is also localized intracellularly ( 9 , 10 ) .
using immunofluorescence and over - expression of p - gp - gfp fusion protein approaches , co - localization results revealed that p - gp is localized in many cellular organelles , including endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) ( 9 ) , golgi ( 9 ) , early endosome ( 11 - 13 ) , recycling endosome ( 12 ) , later endosome , lysosome ( 9 , 11 ) , and proteasome ( 14 ) ( figure 1 ) .
these intracellular localizations link to synthesis ( er ) , modification ( golgi ) , traffic / recycling ( golgi and endosomes ) , and degradation ( lysosome and proteasome ) sites for p - gp. although one study suggests p - gp is also located in mitochondria in doxorubicin - resistant k562 human leukemia cells ( 15 ) , others reveal that p - gp is not presented in mitochondria either in mcf - 7 ( adr ) human breast cancer and kb - v1 human cervix carcinoma drug resistant cell lines ( 16 ) or in primary rat hepatocytes ( 17 ) .
furthermore , transient transfection of p - gp - gfp in cancer cells reveals that the er and golgi localization of p - gp appears to be transient , suggesting that p - gp can rapidly traffic to the endosomal compartment and the plasma membrane localization after it is synthesized in er and modified in golgi .
this rapid transport to the membrane localization explains why less er or golgi localization can be observed in the stable cell line which is overexpressed with p - gp - gfp .
it is possible that activity of p - gp synthesis remains at a relatively low level due to the very long half - life of p - gp ( 14 - 17 h ) in the stable cell line ( 18 ) .
similarly , the degradation localization ( lysosome ) also appears to be less common within the cells compared to the endosomal localization which is involved in constantly trafficking / recycling p - gp between the cellular pool and the plasma membrane ( 11 ) .
figure 1 intracellular localization , traffic , and recycling of p - glycoprotein .
p - gp is shown as " green dot ." different rab gtpases that are involved in p - gp traffic and recycling are indicated as " black diamond ." arrows represent the traffic and recycling path among the intracellular organelles and between the cellular organelles and the plasma membrane .
intracellular traffic and recycling of p - gp after synthesis in er , p - gp first needs to be correctly folded before exit from er and entry to golgi for modification .
currently , very little information is available about the exact regulatory process for p - gp folding in er. glycoprotein glucosyl transferase ( uggt ) is able to sense the folding states of glycoproteins , resulting in mis - folded glycoprotein rebinding calnexin ( a chaperon for protein folding ) and going through re - folding cycles or being rapidly degraded via endoplasmic - reticulum - associated protein degradation ( erad ) ( 19 ) .
thus , uggt may play a potential role in recognizing the folding of p - gp. moreover , a study suggests that sptlc1 ( serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme 1 ) is able to interact with abca1 and cause er retention of abca1 , revealing the role of sptlc1 in er exit of abc transporters ( 20 ) .
furthermore , the formation of disulfide bonds is a critical step in the maturation of the majority of the proteins inside er ( 21 ) .
studies showed that two other abc transporters , abcb6 and abcc8 , form the disulfide bonds between highly conserved cysteine , which is important for these abc transporters to exit er and traffic to the plasma membrane ( 22 ) .
we still lack direct evidence of how p - gp export at the er - the first step of its trafficking along the biosynthetic secretory pathway .
in mammalian cells , the er export occurs via coat protein ii ( copii ) - coated vesicles .
copii vesicles bud from the er and are able to fuse to er - golgi intermediated compartment ( 23 ) .
studies reveal that copii plays an essential role in exporting abcb1 and abcc7 ( cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator , cftr ) from er to golgi ( 24 , 25 ) , suggesting copii may regulate er export of p - gp as well .
golgi is involved in the biosynthesis of glycan chains of glycoproteins , the 150 kda p - gp is transported to the golgi and glycosylated as the 170 kda mature protein ( 26 ) ( figure 1 ) .
after its modification in golgi , the 170 kda mature p - gp traffics to the plasma membrane .
membrane proteins can traffic to the plasma membrane via either the constitutive pathway which involves membrane protein - containing vesicles moving directly to the plasma membrane ( 27 , 28 ) or the endosomal pathway in which protein - containing vesicles are first transported to endosomal compartments to establish the intracellular pool , and then traffic to the plasma membrane ( 29 ) .
in both cases , the cytoskeleton is needed for the traffic of these membrane protein vesicles ( 30 ) .
the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) is a major sorting site for proteins trafficking to the plasma membrane and endosomal pathway .
a study suggests that membrane proteins use n - glycan chains as sorting determinants ( 31 ) ; whether this also applies to p - gp needs to be investigated .
however , some studies show that n - glycosylation at amino acid residue asparagine 596 at third extracellular loop is not necessary for abcg2 traffic ( 32 ) , and the immature core - glycosylated cftr ( abcc7 ) can be transported to the plasma membrane and is functional ( 33 ) .
in the non - polarized cancer cells , p - gp was reported localized in eea1 and rab5 positive early endosome which serves as an intracellular reservoir prior to p - gp moving to the plasma membrane ( 11 ) , suggesting that p - gp can traffic to the plasma membrane via the indirect endosomal pathway .
furthermore , immunofluorescence study showed that p - gp is also localized in lysosome after transient expression of human p - gp - gfp in hela cells or in the human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells , which are stably expressed with p - gp - gfp , suggesting p - gp can be moved to the lysosomal degradation compartment , presumably through the early and late endosome ( 12 ) .
however , an immunofluorescence study reveals that p - gp is not localized in rab11 positive recycling endosomes in human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells , which stably express p - gp - gfp ( 11 ) .
in the polarized wifb9 cells as well as hepatocytes , apical abc transporters ( e.g. , p - gp , abcb11 ) move to the apical membrane via rab11a recycling endosomes and recycle between the apical membrane and the rab11a positive intracellular endosomal pool ( 29 , 34 ) ( figure 1 ) .
these studies suggest that p - gp traffics and recycles via different endosomal pathways ( early endosome vs. recycling endosome ) in non - polarized cells ( e.g. , cancer cells ) and polarized cells .
regulation of p - gp traffic and recycling - role of rab gtpases rab gtpases , the largest branch of small gtpase , are known to regulate vesicular transport in exocytosis , endocytosis , and recycling by controlling many steps in membrane trafficking such as vesicle formation , movement , uncoating , docking , and fusion ( 35 ) .
so far more than 70 rab gtpases have been identified in humans ( 35 ) .
each rab protein is believed to be specifically associated with a particular organelle or pathway ( 35 ) .
currently , few studies revealed the role of rab proteins in p - gp trafficking , thus , the more general involvement of rab proteins in abc transporters trafficking and recycling will be discussed .
rab1 , 2 , and 6 are localized in er and golgi and regulate vesicle transport along the er - golgi biosynthetic pathway .
rab1 , 2 regulate vesicle movement from er to golgi ( 35 , 36 ) , while rab6 is involved in golgi to the cell surface for exocytosis of newly synthesized proteins and lipids ( 37 ) .
study showed that p - gp was predominantly intracellular , largely in rab6 - containing golgi vesicles and golgi cisternae ( 7 ) , suggesting rab6 may regulate p - gp traffic directly from golgi to the plasma membrane ( figure 1 ) .
along the endosomal trafficking pathway , rab11 and rab13 are involved in membrane protein traffic from golgi to the recycling endosome ( 38 - 40 ) .
rab11a was shown to regulate p - gp and abcb11 traffic to the apical membrane in polarized wifb9 cells ( 29 , 34 ) ( figure 1 ) .
furthermore , studies showed that rab11a was also needed for both wt - cftr and deltaf508 - cftr to undergo trafficking to the apical recycling compartment in polarized human airway epithelia cells ( 41 ) as well as polarized intestinal epithelial cells ( 42 ) .
these studies reveal that , in polarized cells , p - gp traffics to the apical membrane via the rab11a positive recycling endosome .
however , in non - polarized mcf - 7 cells , stable expressed p - gp - egfp did not co - localize with rab11 positive recycling endosome ( 11 ) , suggesting p - gp does not traffic to the cell surface via the rab11a positive recycling endosome .
evidence indicates that membrane trafficking of cftr is cell type - specific and it differs in polarized human airway epithelial cells such as cfbe41o - cells and in non - polarized fibroblasts such as bhk - 21 cells ( 41 ) .
thus , rab11a may have a differential role in p - gp trafficking in non - polarized and polarized cells .
other rab proteins , such as rab17 , rab25 , rab35 , and rab40 are also localized in recycling endosome ( 36 , 43 ) .
rab35 is shown to play important role in insulin - stimulated glut4 ( glucose transporter type 4 ) translocation in adipocytes ( 44 ) .
further studies are needed to investigate the role of rab11 as well as other rab proteins ( e.g. , rab17 , rab25 , rab35 , and rab40 ) in p - gp traffic in both polarized and non - polarized cells .
early endosomal pathway is shown to be involved in p - gp trafficking and recycling .
among many of the early endosomal rab proteins , rab4 and rab5 are known to regulate p - gp trafficking and recycling in many cancer cells ( 12 , 13 , 45 ) .
over - expression of dominant - negative rab5 mutant ( s34n - rab5 ) results in large intracellular accumulation of p - gp - egfp in non - polarized hela cells , and similar cellular accumulation of wild type p - gp in multidrug resistant mcf - 7 / adr cells , revealing that rab5 regulates p - gp exocytosis from the endosome compartment ( such as early endosome ) to the plasma membrane in non - polarized cells ( 12 ) .
in contrast , another study in colon cancer cells ls174t , demonstrated that over - expression of wild - type rab5 resulted in recycling p - gp from the plasma membrane into intracellular compartments , suggesting that rab5 regulates p - gp endocytosis instead of exocytosis ( 13 ) , however , this study did not investigate the polarization status of the cell culture of ls174t , which is shown to be polarized in normal culture condition ( 46 ) .
thus , the differential role of rab5 in p - gp trafficking and recycling in these cancer cells may be related to the difference in polarization ( figure 1 ) .
rab4 is also localized in early endosome and shown to regulate p - gp exocytosis in drug resistant leukemia cells , k562adr ( 45 ) .
cell surface expression of p - gp decreased after over - expression of gfp - rab4 or constitutively active rab4q72l mutant , but not dominant - negative rab4s27n mutant or rab14 in the k562adr cells , suggesting that rab4 regulates p - gp trafficking to the plasma membrane from endosomal compartments ( 45 ) .
however , in hela cells , the intracellular localization of p - gp - egfp was not affected when there was over - expression of either wild - type rab4 or dominant - negative mutant n121i - rab4 respectively ( 12 ) , indicating rab4 does not effect p - gp trafficking .
the different cell lines used in these studies may be the reason for obtaining different results .
given many other rab proteins , such as rab10 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 22 , and 23 are localized on early endosome ( 43 ) , it is likely these rab proteins can also regulate the trafficking and recycling of p - gp between the early endosomal compartment and the plasma membrane in a cell and tissue type - specific manner .
transmembrane proteins can be transported from late endosome to lysosome which is responsible for degradation of the membrane proteins ( 47 ) .
p - gp is localized in lamp - 2 positive lysosome , revealing its lysosomal dependent degradation pathway ( 11 ) .
rab7 is localized on late endosome and lysosome , and is essential for later endocytic membrane trafficking from late endosome to lysosome ( 48 , 49 ) , while rab9 is localized on later endosome and responsible for transit from later endosome to the tgn ( 50 ) .
although very little is known about the role of rab7 and 9 on later endocytic membrane trafficking of p - gp , rab7 and 9 are shown to regulate other abc transporter trafficking ( e.g. , cftr ) .
using over - expression of wild type and mutant rab gtpases , a study revealed that cftr could enter rab7 - dependent late endosomal traffic or rab9 - mediated translocation to the tgn ( 51 ) , suggesting the role of both rab7 and 9 in later endocytic trafficking of cftr .
however , the potential roles of rab7 and 9 on p - gp trafficking need to be investigated ( figure 1 ) .
clinical implications p - glycoprotein plays an important role in drug excretion and is one of the main causes for mdr in cancer chemotherapy .
different generations of p - gp inhibitors are developed and enter into preclinical and clinical studies .
the first generation of p - gp inhibitors , such as verapamil and cyclosporin a , are active substrates of p - gp. both verapamil and cyclosporin a cause side effects in patients due to high dose of the drugs are need for their inhibition of p - gp ( 52 , 53 ) .
the second generation of p - gp inhibitors include valspodar ( psc 833 ) , dexverapamil , and dofequidar fumarate .
however , these second generation inhibitors also inhibit drug metabolism enzymes and other abc transporters , which results in impaired drug metabolism and elimination ( 54 - 56 ) .
the third generation of p - gp inhibitors , which are currently undergoing clinical trials , include zosuquidar ( ly335979 ) , elacridar ( gf120918 ) , cbt - 1 , and xr9576 ( 57 - 60 ) .
however , some of the trials are unsuccessful in improving therapeutic efficacy ( 61 ) .
for example , trial was stopped in patient with non - small - cell lung cancer due to chemotherapy - related toxicity after administration of xr9576 ( 60 ) .
thus , there is an urgent need to develop innovative strategies to overcome p - gp - mediated mdr in cancer chemotherapy .
given p - gp needs to be transported to the plasma membrane so as to efflux the anticancer drugs out of cells , blocking the trafficking of p - gp to its final destination - the plasma membrane location - can be an innovative approach to overcome mdr and improve therapy .
there are multiple potential targets along the p - gp traffic pathway .
study revealed that inhibition of p - gp maturation resulted in accumulation of p - gp in golgi , and this immature p - gp in golgi was inactive and presumably led to degradation .
consequently there was an increased cellular accumulation of p - gp substrate ( 62 ) .
experiments also reveal that blocking p - gp traffic to the plasma membrane by interrupting the cytoskeleton highway or modulating rab activation can cause increased intracellular accumulation of p - gp , resulting in more intracellular retention of anticancer drug ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) .
although the intracellular p - gp that is trapped on the way to the plasma membrane remains active , it is likely that intracellular p - gp do not contribute to drug resistance ( 63 ) .
it is essential to identify the regulatory effectors , such as specific rab gtpases or rab binding proteins for p - gp traffic and recycling , and to screen potential candidates for targeting these effectors .
therefore , more studies are needed to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of p - gp intracellular traffic / cycling and its regulatory factors .

abstract periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by specific bacteria residing in the biofilm , particularly porphyromonas gingivalis ( pg ) .
sprouty2 ( spry2 ) functions as a negative regulator of the fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) signaling pathway .
we previously demonstrated that sequestration of spry2 induced proliferation and osteogenesis in osteoblastic cells by basic fgf ( bfgf ) and epidermal growth factor ( egf ) stimulation in vitro , but diminished cell proliferation in gingival epithelial cells .
in addition , spry2 knockdown in combination with bfgf and egf stimulation increases periodontal ligament cell proliferation and migration accompanied by prevention of osteoblastic differentiation .
in this study , we investigated the mechanisms through which spry2 depletion by interferon ( ifn ) gamma and pg lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) stimulation affected the physiology of macrophages in vitro .
transfection of macrophages with spry2 small - interfering rna ( sirna ) promoted the expression of genes characteristic of m2 alternative activated macrophages , induced interleukin ( il ) - 10 expression , and enhanced arginase activity , even in cells stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps .
in addition , we found that phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) and akt activation by spry2 downregulation enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by increasing rac1 activation and decreasing nuclear factor kappa b ( nfkappab ) p65 phosphorylation but not signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( stat1 ) phosphorylation .
collectively , our results suggested that topical administration of spry2 inhibitors may efficiently resolve inflammation in periodontal disease as macrophage - based anti - inflammatory immunotherapy and may create a suitable environment for periodontal wound healing .
these in vitro findings provide a molecular basis for new therapeutic approaches in periodontal tissue regeneration .

introduction periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs in response to specific bacteria in a biofilm and involves the destruction of tooth - supporting tissues 1 , 2 .
as lesions associated with chronic periodontitis progress , increasing numbers of macrophages infiltrate into the gingival tissues 3 .
macrophages are a first line of defense against invading pathogens , and lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) from foreign bacteria induces macrophage activation by the binding with toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) on the surface of macrophages 4 .
porphyromonas gingivalis ( pg ) is a key periodontal pathogen associated with both periodontal disease onset and progression 5 , 6 .
lps from pg activates macrophages through both tlr2 and trl4,7 and specifically , tlr2 activation by pg lps triggers the downstream stimulation of nuclear factor kappa b ( nfkappab ) , leading to the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 .
macrophages can be categorized into two main distinctly different functional phenotypes .
classical activation of macrophages ( m1 macrophages ) by stimulation with interferon ( ifn ) gamma or lps promotes the th1 response , produces pro - inflammatory cytokines , kills intercellular pathogens , and initiates adaptive immune responses 11 , 12 .
however , the combination of these responses may cause extensive tissue damage .
in contrast , macrophages stimulated by interleukin ( il ) - 4 or il - 13 display a distinct alternative pattern of activation .
these so - called m2 macrophages play roles in th2 responses , production of anti - inflammatory cytokines , angiogenesis , scavenging , tissue remodeling , and tissue repair 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 .
these functional differences are reflected in the expression of the two opposing effector molecules , inducible nitric oxide ( inos ) and arginase .
thus , macrophages are involved in both destruction and regeneration of tissue and play important roles in the interface between inflammation and tissue repair .
sprouty ( spry ) proteins were originally identified in drosophila and interfere with fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) signaling by inhibiting the ras - raf1 - mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway 17 , 18 .
four human spry homologs ( spry1 - 4 ) have been identified , and spry2 specifically suppresses the activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) pathway in response to various growth factors19 , 20 , 21 , 22 .
analyses in spry2 - deficient mice have demonstrated that spry2 inhibition induces supernumerary teeth in the toothless region of mandible , called the diastema , indicating that spry2 functions to suppress tooth development in the diastema by blocking fgf signaling 23 .
in contrast , overexpression of spry2 in chick embryos results in severely foreshortened frontonasal , maxillary , and mandibular prominences , which causes bilateral facial clefts at the initiation of craniofacial development 24 .
intriguingly , suppression of spry2 and spry4 enhances murine corneal neovascularization in vivo and improves the recovery of limb perfusion after induction of hind limb ischemia in a mouse model 25 .
in addition , previous studies in our laboratory have shown that sequestration of spry2 induces erk activation , proliferation , and osteogenesis in osteoblastic cells by basic fgf ( bfgf ) and epidermal growth factor ( egf ) stimulation in vitro while suppressing erk activation and cell proliferation in gingival epithelial cells 26 .
in addition , we found that spry2 knockdown combined with bfgf and egf stimulation increased periodontal ligament cell proliferation and migration , while it prevented osteoblastic differentiation27 .
therefore , combined application of a spry2 inhibitor , bfgf , and egf may effectively facilitate the growth of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone while preventing tooth ankylosis and blocking gingival epithelial down - growth toward bony defects .
these previous works suggest that spry2 may have potential applications in periodontal regeneration .
during the onset of periodontal tissue regeneration , the inflammation caused by pg lps must be resolved , and m2 macrophages play a crucial role in tissue repair .
accordingly , in this study , we investigated the mechanisms through which spry2 depletion by ifngamma and pg lps stimulation affected the physiology of macrophages in vitro .

inhibition of spry2 reduced pro - inflammatory cytokine production and promoted anti - inflammatory cytokine production in j774.1 cells stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps spry2 sirna - transfected j774.1 macrophages were stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps , and culture supernatants were analyzed for pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines .
the concentrations of the pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 12 and il - 6 were significantly reduced in spry2 sirna - transfected cells in the presence of ifngamma and pg lps ( fig. 2a and b ) .
in contrast , the concentration of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 was enhanced by induction with spry2 sirna ( fig. 2c ) .
production of the pro - inflammatory molecule tnf - alpha was slightly lower , but the difference was not significant ( fig. 2c ) .
these results were consistent with the altered macrophage phenotype and showed that spry2 sirna could alter cytokine production in macrophages stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps to reduce the inflammatory status .

spry2 depletion decreased inos activity and increased arginase activity in j774.1 cells stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps inos is activated in response to inflammatory stimuli as macrophages shift toward the m1 phenotype , whereas the expression of arginase is induced by th2 - type cytokines , and the balance between inos and arginase is correlated with th1 and th2 responses 28 .
therefore , inos and arginase protein expression levels in spry2 sirna - transfected macrophages treated with ifngamma and pg lps were measured by western blotting .
inos protein expression was detectable in control cells , but was significantly reduced in spry2 sirna - transfected j774.1 cells exposed to ifngamma and pg lps ( fig. 3a ) .
in contrast , arg1 protein expression was substantially enhanced when spry2 sirna - transfected macrophages were stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps ( fig. 3a ) .
consistent with this result , the addition of ifngamma and pg lps to spry2 - knockdown cells resulted in increased arginase activity ( fig. 3b ) .

inhibition of spry2 enhanced the expression of genes encoding growth factors in j774.1 cells stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps m2 macrophages are thought to play a central role in the proliferative response of various cell types associated with wound healing , and prior studies have indicated that these cells produce growth factors , such as bfgf and egf 29 .
the expression levels of genes encoding growth factor were measured using quantitative real - time rcr at 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 h after stimulation of j774.1 macrophages with ifngamma and pg lps .
as expected , we observed higher expression of bfgf , egf , pdgf , and vegf mrnas in spry2 sirna - transfected cells ( fig. 4a - d ) .

spry2 suppression enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by inducing rac1 activation when j774.1 cells were stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps efferocytosis is an essential process involved in removal or clearance of apoptotic cells , and this process is crucial for maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis , embryoligic development , and resolution of inflammation 30 , 31 .
macrophages produce anti - inflammatory cytokines after recognizing , engulfing , and internalizing apoptotic cells .
to evaluate efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages , spry2 sirna - transfected j774.1 macrophages stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps were co - cultured with murine apoptotic thymocytes .
control sirna - transfected macrophages were transformed into huge and dendri - form cells by following stimulation with ifngamma and pg lps .
however , efferocytosis was not observed in these control cells .
on the other hand , efferocytosis of apoptotic cells was markedly enhanced in spry2 sirna - transfected macrophages stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps ( fig. 5a - c ) .
figure 5 spry2 suppression enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by inducing rac1 activation when j774.1 cells were stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps .

the engulfment of apoptotic cells relies on the signaling of rho family gtpases , specifically rac1 , and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization 31 , 32 , 33 .
consistent with the increase in the number of apoptotic cells engulfed by macrophages ( fig. 5c ) , the activation of rac1 was markedly increased in spry2 sirna - transfected j774.1 cells , resulting in induction of efferocytosis in apoptotic cells ( fig. 5d ) .
these findings indicated that spry2 inhibition promoted efferocytosis in apoptotic cells via rac1 activation in macrophages after stimulation with ifngamma and pg lps .
spry2 inhibition down - regulated pg lps - induced nfkappab activation but not ifngamma - induced stat1 activation in j774.1 macrophages by increasing akt and pi3k activation the tlr signaling pathway regulates the transcription factor nfkappab in lps - stimulated macrophages .
ubiquitination of ikappab leads to its proteasomal degradation and phosphorylation of nfkappab p65 34 .
to investigate the mechanisms through which spry2 inhibition affects tlr and ifngamma receptor signaling pathways in macrophages , we next examined ikappab degradation and nfkappab p65 phosphorylation in spry2 sirna cells .
as shown in figure 6a , ikappab was degraded after 10 min of pg lps and ifngamma stimulation in control cells .
however , ikappab degradation was not observed in spry2 sirna - transfected j774.1 macrophages .
consistent with this result , lower levels of phosphorylated nfkappab p65 were observed in pg lps - and ifngamma - stimulated spry2 sirna macrophages compared with that in control cells ( fig. 6b ) .
figure 6 spry2 inhibition downregulated pg lps - induced nfkappab activation but not ifngamma - induced stat1 activation in j774.1 macrophages by increasing akt and pi3k activation .

ifngamma mediates inos upregulation via the janus kinase ( jak )/ stat pathway .
stat1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 following stimulation with ifngamma .
therefore , we explored the effects of spry2 inhibition on stat1 phosphorylation in response to ifngamma and pg lps .
western blot analysis showed that phosphorylation of stat1 in spry2 sirna - transfected cells was not different from that in the control cells ( fig. 6c ) .
the activation of pi3k and its downstream targets , including akt , by stimulation with growth factors suppresses lps - induced nfkappab signaling cascades in macrophages , resulting in decreased production of pro - inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide 35 .
therefore , to identify the possible causative mechanism , we examined pi3k and akt activation after ifngamma and pg lps stimulation in spry2 - transfected j774.1 cells by western blotting .
spry2 sirna increased the levels of both pi3k and akt phosphorylation in j774.1 cells stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps ( fig. 6d and e ) .
these data suggested that spry2 inhibition promoted phosphorylation of pi3k and akt , thereby reducing nfkappab activation but not stat1 following stimulation with ifngamma and pg lps .
discussion in this study , we identified a novel role for spry2 protein in the regulation of macrophage polarization in vitro .
suppression of spry2 in macrophages promoted the expression of genes and cytokines that characterize m2 macrophages , when the cells were stimulated with ifngamma and pg lps .
our analysis showed that pi3k and akt activation by spry2 downregulation enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by promoting rac1 activation and inhibited pg lps - induced nfkappab activation .
spry2 is a regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase ( rtk ) signaling and inhibits erk activity through regulation of ras by interfering with growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 ( grb2 ) and sons of sevenless ( sos ) binding 36 , 37 .
the interaction between grb2 and rtk is prevented and rtk signaling is inhibited as a result of the interaction between spry2 and grb2 21 , 38 .
in addition to the ras / erk pathway , spry2 can also suppress the pi3k / akt signaling pathway by promoting the activation and stability of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( pten ) 39 , 40 , 41 .
in contrast , loss of spry2 protein results in hyper - activation of pi3k / akt signaling to drive cell proliferation and invasion 42 .
pi3k and akt phosphorylate p21 - activated kinase ( pak ) , providing a target for the small gtp - binding protein rac1 43 , 44 .
spry2 has been reported to induce anti - migratory effects by inhibiting rac1 activation 45 .
the importance of rho gtpases in efferocytosis has been demonstrated in many studies 46 , 47 , and rac1 activation is important in efferocytosis through modification of the cytoskeleton , lamellipodia formation , and membrane ruffle formation .
in contrast , rhoa activation inhibits this process 48 .
several studies have shown that the engulfment of apoptotic cells by efferocytosis can result in production of anti - inflammatory mediators , including transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) and il - 10 49 , 50 .
in addition , recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages during efferocytosis activates the phosphorylation of stat3 , an enhancer of anti - inflammatory signaling , leading to a polarization of macrophages into the m2 phenotype with increased expression of m2 markers as well as m2 - related cytokines and growth factors 51 , 52 .
therefore , our results suggested that the sequestration of spry2 increased pi3k / akt phosphorylation and rac1 activation , thereby promoting efferocytosis of apoptotic cells and shifting macrophages toward the m2 phenotype ( fig. 7 ) .
figure 7 proposed model of the involvement of spry2 and spry2 sirna in tlr , ifngamma receptor , and growth factor signaling pathways for suppression of m1 polarization and enhancement of m2 polarization in macrophages .
upon pg lps and ifngamma binding to their respective receptors and activating the respective signal pathways , spry2 becomes activated and interacts with various components of the pi3k / akt signaling pathway .
spry2 sirna inhibits endogenous spry2 , thereby promoting growth factor - induced rac1 activation .
spry2 sirna enhances the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells , leading to polarization into m2 macrophage activation .
pg lps stimulation increases ikappab degradation and nfkappab p65 phosphorylation , and ifngamma stimulation promotes stat1 phosphorylation .
stimulation with both ifngamma and lps shifts macrophages toward the m1 phenotype by activating inos expression .
pi3k and akt activation by spry2 sirna interferes with ikappab degradation and nfkappab p65 phosphorylation , resulting in suppression of m1 polarization .
polarized m2 macrophages release various growth factors .

pi3k / akt signaling can also stimulate lps - induced tlr signaling and subsequently increase the anti - inflammatory response 35 .
the pi3k / akt pathway is activated by tlr signaling in a feedback loop that inhibits the response to tlr activators. that is , growth factors can enhance pi3k and akt activation and contribute to m2 polarization through a mechanism independent of the il - 4 / il - 13 signaling pathway 35 .
furthermore , pi3k negatively regulates tlr signaling during exposure to pathogens , and the promotion of pi3k activation leads to decreased il - 12 and enhancement of il - 4 and il - 10 production in antigen - presenting cells 53 .
in this study , we showed that pi3k / akt activated by spry2 sirna suppressed ikappab degradation and nfkappab p65 phosphorylation but not stat1 phosphorylation .
this crosstalk between tlr and growth factor signaling resulted in decreased inos expression and interference with the shift toward m1 macrophages ( fig. 7 ) .
however , as shown in figure 2c , the differences in tnf - alpha production between control sirna - and spry2 sirna - transfected macrophages in the presence of ifngamma and pg lps were not significant .
the expression of tnf - alpha is mediated by the transcription factor lps - induced tnf - alpha factor ( litaf ) in an lps - induced process 54 .
litaf is an important mediator of the lps - induced inflammatory response that can be distinguished from the nfkappab pathway 55 .
therefore , normal production of tnf - alpha by spry2 suppression with ifngamma and pg lps co - stimulation may be caused by litaf signaling but not nfkappab signaling .
interestingly , spry2 and spry4 are physiologically critical negative regulators of angiogenesis in vivo , and inhibition of their activities may be a new therapeutic target for treating peripheral ischemic diseases 25 .
in addition , the downregulation of spry2 promotes cell proliferation , differentiation , and migration of endothelial cells , thereby promoting angiogenesis and inducing skin wound healing in mice 56 .
moreover , the suppression of spry2 aggressively increases elongation of axon growth of sensory neurons 57 .
in our previous studies , we observed that spry2 downregulation promoted the phosphorylation of erk and the proliferation of osteoblastic cells after bfgf and egf stimulation .
moreover , spry2 downregulation increased osteogenesis by upregulating ras - responsive runx2 expression through the induction of twist , a negative regulator of runx2 .
in contrast , suppression of spry2 expression enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of egf receptors , resulting in decreased proliferation of gingival epithelial cells 26 .
in addition , we also found that spry2 sirna promoted lamellipodia formation induced by the stimulation of bfgf and egf via akt / pi3k and rac1 activation in pdl cells , thereby activating cell migration while suppressing osteoblastic differentiation 27 .
thus , spry2 downregulation could benefit periodontal tissue regeneration by increasing the stimulation of growth factors .
the results presented in this study demonstrated that m2 macrophages induced by spry2 inhibition may enhance the production of growth factors such as bfgf and egf and involve in the functions of osteoblasts , gingival epithelial cells , and periodontal ligament cells , which take up these cytokines .
therefore , our data suggested that spry2 suppression may yield a favorable environment for periodontal regeneration even without bfgf and egf application .
in summary , our results suggested that topical administration of spry2 inhibitors may efficiently resolve inflammation in periodontal lesion as macrophage - based anti - inflammatory immunotherapy and may create a suitable environment for periodontal wound healing .
these in vitro findings provide a molecular basis for new therapeutic approaches in periodontal tissue regeneration .

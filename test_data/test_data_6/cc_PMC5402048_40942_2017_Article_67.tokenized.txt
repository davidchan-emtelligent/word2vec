background to determine the occurrence of macular edema ( me ) in vitreoretinal lymphoma ( vrl ) .
methods retrospective analysis of 17 patients ( 31 eyes ) with vrl .
a review of the literature was done as well .
results nine patients ( 15 eyes ) had fluorescein angiography and / or optical coherence tomography at presentation .
in the me group ( six eyes of four patients ) , three patients ( five eyes ) had prior chemotherapy and radiation .
excluding eyes with radiation retinopathy ( three eyes ) , rate of me was 25 % ( 3 / 12 ) .
when two unirradiated fellow eyes of eyes with radiation retinopathy were also excluded , me rate was 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) .
excluding the eyes with intraocular surgery , the rate of me was 0 % .
in the group without me ( nine eyes of six patients ) , one patient ( one eye ) was treated with chemotherapy and radiation and three patients ( five eyes ) with chemotherapy .
review of the literature showed that the me was found between 2 and 60 % of cases , but most of the cases with me had prior interventions .
conclusions macular edema in vrl is not uncommon but usually related to prior interventions .
macular edema as an initial presentation of vrl is rare .
http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100001818research to prevent blindnessdeshong familypaul familyissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction vitreoretinal lymphoma ( vrl ) is a rare form of non - hodgkin central nervous system lymphoma ( cns - l ) .
malignant diffuse large b cell is the most common form , although rarely , a t - cell form occurs as well [ 1 , 2 ] .
these cells invade the vitreous and retina , including the subretinal and sub - rpe ( retinal pigment epithelium ) space .
ocular involvement can precede ( primary vrl ) , occur in tandem with , or follow cns disease ( secondary vrl ) [ 3 ] .
therefore , patients with cns - l will go on to develop ocular involvement 15 - 25 % of the time ; while in those patients with primary vrl , upwards of 65 - 90 % of patients will develop cerebral disease [ 4 , 5 ] .
occasionally , vrl is associated with systemic non - hodgkin lymphoma [ 6 , 7 ] .
vrl usually affects elderly patients between the sixth and seventh decades of life but can occasionally occur in younger patients , though these patients tend to be immunocompromised .
it is bilateral in 60 - 90 % of cases but is sometimes asymmetric at the time of presentation [ 6 ] .
floaters and blurred vision are the most typical symptoms .
clinical findings can vary widely , and the condition may masquerade as a bilateral posterior uveitis .
the most common presentation is vitreous invasion by clumps of cells .
solitary or multifocal sub - rpe lesions can occur with or without vitreous involvement .
less frequent manifestations include : macular edema ( me ) , iridocyclitis , optic neuropathy , vasculitis , retinal detachment , and retinal hemorrhage [ 5 , 8 ] .
macular edema is a nonspecific finding of uveitis secondary to blood - retinal barrier disruption as a result of inflammatory mediators .
it is frequently present in vitreous inflammatory diseases such as intermediate uveitis [ 9 ] , but it is also seen in anterior , posterior , and panuveitis ; it is the main cause of visual impairment in many cases of uveitis [ 10 , 11 ] .
interestingly , me does not appear to be a characteristic finding in vrl , though there are few studies and some use only funduscopic determination [ 12 - 15 ] .
fluorescein angiography and ocular coherence tomography ( oct ) are very good at detecting me in vrl .
the purpose of the present review is to determine the occurrence and behavior of me at the time of the initial presentation of vrl .
this is a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with vrl within a 5 - year period ( january 2005 - january 2010 ) at mayo clinic , rochester , minnesota , usa .
all patients who were included in this study had tissue diagnosis at mayo clinic within an average of three weeks of initial presentation .
after mayo clinic irb approval , we reviewed all cases diagnosed with vrl that had tissue confirmation .
we then selected those that had fluorescein angiography ( fa ) and / or oct at their initial visit at mayo .
these were classified in two groups depending on the presence or absence of me. in both groups , we analyzed the best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) as well as the relevant past medical , pharmacological , radiotherapy , and ocular history , including prior intraocular procedures .
intraocular findings , including the severity of vitreous cells and retinal involvement ( intraretinal or subretinal ) at the time of initial examination , were also recorded .
those eyes with fa and / or oct had their charts re - evaluated at 6 and 12 months' time .
the oct was analyzed with careful attention to the appearance of intraretinal cysts or fluid , retinal thickness , flattening of the foveal depression , decrease of intraretinal reflectivity , and serous retinal detachment as a result of fluid accumulation in the oct in six radial line scan images .
any detectable me on oct was classified in three groups ( i.e. , cystoid , diffuse , or serous detachment ) as described in the literature [ 16 - 18 ] .
briefly , cystoid me is characterized by the presence of low - reflective intraretinal spaces separated by thin retinal tissue .
diffuse me has an increased macular thickness with a spongy appearance of the retinal layer .
finally , serous detachment is defined as the presence of serous retinal detachment , epiretinal membrane , or vitreoretinal traction .
to classify the angiographic me , we used the grading system of yannuzzi et al .
[ 19 , 20 ] .
me was classified in two patterns : cystoid or diffuse .
the cystoid macular pattern demonstrated a demarcated petaloid pattern of hyperfluorescence , whereas the diffuse pattern showed a late spread of leakage in a poorly demarcated area in the foveal or perifoveal region .
grade 0 corresponded to the absence of perifoveal hyperfluorescence ; grade 1 referred to incomplete perifoveal hyperfluorescence ; grade 2 referred to mild 360degrees hyperfluorescence ; grade 3 was characterized by moderate 360degrees hyperfluorescence with the area of hyperfluorescence being 1 disc diameter across ; and grade 4 referred to severe 360degrees hyperfluorescence with the hyperfluorescent area having a minimal cross - sectional diameter of 1.5 disc diameter .
subsequently , a review of the english literature was performed as well .
keywords used included vitreoretinal lymphoma and intraocular lymphoma .
cases at mayo clinic during the 5 - year study period , 17 patients ( 31 eyes ) were histopathologically diagnosed with vrl , but only 15 patients required imaging at the first visit .
in eight patients ( 47 %) , vrl preceded the cns - l ; whereas in nine patients ( 53 %) , vrl occurred in patients with the diagnosis of cns - l. sixteen ( 52 %) were right eyes and 15 ( 48 %) were left eyes .
the median age for all 17 patients diagnosed with vrl was 66 years ( range 54 - 80 years ) at presentation .
nine patients ( 53 %) were female and eight ( 47 %) were male ( table 1 ) .
fourteen patients ( 82 %) had bilateral presentation and three ( 18 %) had unilateral presentation .
nine patients ( 15 eyes ) were imaged with fa and / or oct at the first examination ( fig. 1 ) .

two patients were female ( 50 %) and two were male ( 50 %) .
two were right eyes ( 33.3 %) and four were left eyes ( 66.7 %) .
only one patient had high blood pressure and was on medical therapy and none had diabetes mellitus .
four eyes had previous intraocular surgery ( two had cataract surgery , and two had pars plana vitrectomy ) .
three patients ( 75 %) had secondary vrl at the time of diagnosis of cns - l ; two had prior cns - l and one had diffuse large b - cell lymphoma with cns involvement diagnosed 3 - 7 and 11 years prior to their evaluation , respectively .
one patient ( 25 %) developed cns - l 5 months after our examination ( primary vrl ) .
all three patients with previous cns - l had been previously treated with whole - brain radiotherapy ( wbrt ) .
the radiation details of only one patient ( patient 1 ) were known to us because the other patients were treated elsewhere .
additionally , all three patients had been treated with chemotherapy ( ct ) before the wbrt .
one patient ( patient 4 ) had post - radiation ct and was still on a maintenance dosage of intravenous methotrexate at the time of evaluation .
patient 2 had primary vrl and had no prior treatment with ct or wbrt .
however , he had undergone pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv ) with intravitreal corticosteroid injection and cataract surgery in the left eye , 11 and 5 months before our examination , respectively .
the clinical presentation was blurred vision ( 5 of 6 ) and blurred vision plus floaters ( 1 of 6 ) for a median of 3 months ( range 1 - 9 ) .
the median bcva was 20 / 45 ( range 20 / 25 - 20 / 150 ) .
ophthalmologic signs included : a median anterior chamber cell grade of 1 + ( range 0 - 3 +) , a median vitreous cell grade of 3 + ( range rare - 3 +) , subretinal infiltrates ( 2 of 6 ) , intraretinal infiltrates ( 1 of 6 ) , cotton wool spots ( 2 of 6 ) , intraretinal hemorrhages ( 1 of 6 ) , and perimacular hard exudates ( 1 of 6 ) ( table 2 ) .
however , mixed lesions in the fundus ( i.e. cotton wool spots , intraretinal hemorrhages , and hard exudates ) were found in three patients ( 3 of 6 eyes ) with me who had received wbrt at 8 , 36 , and 132 months before presentation ( figs. 2 , 3 ) .
for this reason , we could not rule out radiation retinopathy ( rr ) as an etiology of me in these three eyes .
thus , excluding eyes with rr , the rate of me was 25 % ( 3 of 12 ) .
however , two additional eyes were the fellow eyes of those with definite rr ( in which no signs of rr were found ) .
excluding these as well , the rate of me in eyes with vrl was 10 % ( 1 of 10 ) ( fig. 3 ) .
looking at it differently , of five patients without wbrt , 1 of 9 ( 11.1 %) eyes had me. fig. 2 fundus photograph , fa , and oct showing diffuse macular edema in a patient with radiation retinopathy and a history of wbrt , ct , and ppv ( patient 1 ) .
diffuse macular edema in right eye due to radiation retinopathy in patient with primary vrl with a history of wbrt and chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy ( patient 1 ) .
the fundus examination showed 3 + cells in the vitreous , macular edema and hard exudates nasal to the fovea ( line with dashes ) , and peripheral subretinal mottling and vessels sheathing 360degrees ( a ) .
the fa presented extrafoveal diffuse macular edema grade 1 ( b ) and diffuse extrafoveal edema by oct ( c1 , 2 ) fig. 3 fundus photographs , fa , and oct of eye with radiation retinopathy and fellow eye in a patient with history of wbrt and chemotherapy ( patient 3 ) .
diffuse macular edema in both eyes , right eye due to radiation retinopathy , in patient with a secondary vrl with a history of wbrt and chemotherapy and no intraocular procedures ( patient 3 ) .
the fundus examination showed cotton wool spots ( long arrow ) and intraretinal hemorrhage ( short arrow ) in the right eye ( a1 ) as well as an intraretinal infiltrate superotemporal to the macula ( b1a , b ) , which could be the cause of the me of this eye ( eye without signs of rr ) .
the oct was negative for me in the right eye ( a2 ) and showed an extrafoveal diffuse me in the left eye ( b2 ) .
however , the fa presented a diffuse me in both eyes , grade 1 in right eye and grade 3 in left eye ( a3 , b3 ) of these three eyes with me but without signs of rr ( or which were not fellow eyes of those with rr ) , one eye did not have wbrt but did have a history of ppv and cataract surgery history , one had cataract surgery only , and one did not have any intraocular procedures before our examination .
the clinical presentation in these eyes was blurred vision ( 2 of 3 ) or blurred vision plus floaters ( 1 of 3 ) for a median of 2 months ( range 2 - 6 ) .
the median bcva was 20 / 50 ( 20 / 25 - 20 / 150 ) , and ophthalmologic signs included a median anterior chamber cell grade of 0 ( range 0 - trace ) , a median vitreous cell grade of 1 + ( range rare - 3 +) , and intraretinal infiltrates ( 1 of 3 ) .
two eyes without rr ( or fellow eyes of those with rr ) were imaged with fa , showing extrafoveal , grade 1 macular leakage in one of the eyes ( 1 of 2 ) and grade 3 macular leakage in the other eye ( 1 of 2 ) .
two eyes also had oct done with extrafoveal cystoid me in one eye ( 1 of 2 ) and extrafoveal diffuse me in the other eye ( 1 of 2 ) .
in the one eye which was imaged both with fa and oct , there was no discrepancy between the tests to detect diffuse me. all three eyes with rr underwent imaging with fa and were found to have focal diffuse grade 1 macular leakage .
two eyes with rr were imaged with oct , and one eye showed extrafoveal diffuse me ( 1 of 2 ) , while the other eye ( 1 of 2 ) was negative for me changes .
notably , the fa of this eye was positive for extrafoveal diffuse grade 1 me. therefore , there was a discrepancy between fa and oct to detect me in half eyes with rr. two patients ( three eyes ) had oct after 1 - year follow - up. in one patient , after ppv in the left eye and intravitreal methotrexate and rituximab injections in both eyes and ct , the me persisted in the right eye ( eye without rr ) and was chronic in the left eye ( eye with rr ) ( patient 4 ) .
in the left eye of the other patient , without history of wbrt , after ct treatment as a result of cns - l presentation 5 months after our first examination and no intraocular procedures , me was worse ( patient 2 ) .
review of the literature macular edema is the result of breakdown of the inner endothelial blood - retinal barrier , developing an increase of retinal vascular permeability , which promotes the accumulation of fluid inside the retinal tissue [ 21 ] .
this vasogenic effect can be modified in a wide variety of pathologic or pharmacologic conditions , systemic or intraocular [ 21 , 22 ] .
reviewing the english literature , there are a few authors that describe the incidence of me in vrl [ 12 - 15 ] ( table 3 ) .
the rate varies widely from 2.46 % to 66.6 % of cases .
patients with vrl who present me also can have other possible sources of me , such as antecedents of whole - brain radiotherapy ( wbrt ) , chemotherapy ( ct ) , epiretinal membranes , and / or intraocular procedures [ 12 - 15 , 23 , 24 ] .

[ 15 ] describes the highest percentage of me being 60 % ( 6 of 10 eyes ) by fa and 66.6 % ( 2 of 3 eyes ) by oct , whereas systemic lymphoma was treated with ct in 50 % of patients , external beam radiotherapy in 25 % , and combined ct and radiation in 25 % .
however , there are no specifics described stating that patients with me had any history of these conditions .
in other studies , prior radiation or ct history is not described .
radiation retinopathy ( rr ) has been described after radiation treatments of ocular , orbital , and intracranial tumors several months or years after [ 25 - 27 ] .
retinal vascular endothelial cells are damaged by radiation and develop retinopathy [ 28 ] .
macular edema is the earliest clinical presentation , followed by hard exudates , microaneurysm , telangiectasia , hemorrhages , neovascularization , and tractional retinal detachment [ 29 ] .
a dose > 50 gy is associated with rr development .
however , there are rr cases reported with doses of < 35 gy [ 30 - 32 ] .
moreover , it has been reported that ct accompanying the radiation treatment can accelerate rr due to retinal vascular damage as happens in diabetic and hypertensive patients [ 31 - 33 ] .
saito et al .
[ 24 ] describes 11.53 % of me in pvrl ( 3 of 26 eyes ) , but history of previous intraocular procedures is not specified .
however , 2 of 3 eyes ( 1 patient ) presented epiretinal membranes in the initial presentation ; therefore , that could be considered a risk factor to develop macular oedema .
velez et al .
[ 13 ] shows 19 % ( 6 of 31 eyes ) with cystoid me. however , four eyes in this study had previous cataract surgery and one had pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv ) , suggesting that a disruption of the anterior - posterior chamber interface predisposes to the development of inflammatory signs such as me. cassoux et al .
[ 12 ] described the lowest percentage of me of all studies at a rate of 2.46 % ( 2 of 81 eyes ) by fa. in this population , three eyes had prior ppv , but exactly which eyes had me was not clear .
thus , we cannot tell if there is any association with prior surgery in this series .
considering all of the risk factors for me , the rate of me in the setting of vrl is not uncommon .
however , most of the cases are related with risk factors wbrt , ct , epiretinal membranes and / or intraocular surgery .
thus , it is difficult to determine the exact incidence of me due to vrl , per se , but reflects that it possibly is an uncommon sign in eyes without a history of systemic or intraocular interventions .
conclusions in conclusion , although me is observed predominantly in disorders of the vitreous body , it appears that me is not a main characteristic of vrl .
furthermore , in cases with marked vitreous inflammation with sheets and clusters of cells without me as well as good visual acuity , one of our principal differential diagnoses should be vrl .
however , a meticulous systemic and intraocular history must be evaluated in all patients since , in patients with prior intervention , me may be present .

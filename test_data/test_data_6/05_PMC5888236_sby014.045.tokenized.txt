abstract background several imaging and postmortem studies provide evidence that , in the brains of people with schizophrenia , there are alterations in glucose metabolism and energy utilization .
however , it is difficult to determine whether altered excitatory transmission alters bioenergetics that then contributes to symptoms of the disorder .
we have used a mouse model to begin to address these questions .
glun1 knockdown mice have a mutation that reduces nmda receptor levels throughout development and maturity .
methods we affinity purified psd95 protein complexes from glun1kd and wt brains ( n = 3 per group ) and ran each sample through our liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) protocol in singlicate .
we performed pathway analysis with the enrichr suite of bioinformatic tools and compared wt to glun1kd psd95 interactomes using the top 20 differentially expressed proteins .
we also studied how nmda receptor hypofunction changes the expression of genes related to glucose metabolism and bioenergetics by quantitative pcr of brain cdna from wt and glun1 knockdown mice .
results pathway analysis revealed that wt mice showed pathways relevant for synaptic plasticity ( as expected ) , while glun1kd analyses yielded proteins related to glucose metabolism and utilization .
gene expression analysis revealed that glun1 knockdown mice have significant decreases in the expression of slc16a3 , slc2a1 , and slc2a3 , which are the genes for the monocarboxylate transporter ( mct4 ) , and glucose transporters 1 and 3 ( glut1 and glut3 ) .
discussion our results show that nmda receptor dysfunction leads to expression changes that would reduce glucose and lactate transport into neurons .
the synaptic proteome of nmdar deficient mice shows an increase in glycolytic enzymes located at the synapse .
these data suggest a profound shift in the composition of the cortical excitatory synaptic proteome in glun1kd mice , with apparent increases in neuroenergetic substrates in neurons .
at the same time , there were significant decreases in the levels of transporters that bring glucose and the primary energy substrate , lactate , into neurons .
the mct4 shuttles lactate from astrocytes to neurons , which can then be used for oxidative respiration in neurons .
glut1 is responsible for transport of glucose across the blood - brain - barrier , and glut3 is expressed on neurons and is responsible for glucose uptake in those cells .
notably , we have identified that these transporter gene transcripts are reduced in postmortem brains of people with schizophrenia .
thus , this mouse may be a useful tool to model bioenergetic changes that are observed in schizophrenia , and study functional outcomes when glucose metabolism is improved .

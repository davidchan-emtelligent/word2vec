background staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) is mandatory .
the maximum standard uptake value ( suvmax ) obtained using f - 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) is the best non - invasive technique available for this evaluation , but its performance varies from center to center .
the aim of the present study was to identify fdg - pet predictors of mediastinal malignancy that are able to minimize intercenter variability and improve the selection of subsequent staging procedures .
method a multicenter study of nsclc patients staged through fdg - pet and endobronchial ultrasonography with needle aspiration ( ebus - na ) was performed using therapeutic surgery with systematic nodal dissection as gold standard .
intercenter variability and predictive power for mediastinal malignancy of different fdg - pet measures were assessed , as well as the role of these measures for selecting additional staging procedures .
results one hundred and twenty - one nsclc patients , of whom 94 ( 72 %) had >= 1 hypermetabolic spots in the mediastinum , were included in the study .
mean suvmax of the primary tumor was 12.3 ( sd 6.3 ) , and median suvmax of the highest hypermetabolic spots in the mediastinum was 3.9 ( iqr 2.4 - 7 ) .
variability of fdg - pet measures between hospitals was statistically significant ( p = 0.016 and p < 0.001 respectively ) , but lost significance when suvmax in the mediastinum was expressed as a ratio or a subtraction from the primary tumor ( suvmax mediastinum / tumor , p = 0.083 ; and suvmax mediastinum - tumor , p = 0.428 respectively ) .
suvmax mediastinum / tumor showed higher accuracy in the roc analysis ( auc 0.77 ci 0.68 - 0.85 , p < 0.001 ) , and showed predictive power for mediastinal malignancy when using a 0.4 cutoff ( or 6.62 , 95 % ci 2.98 - 14.69 ) .
sensitivities and negative predictive values of clinical staging through ebus - na attained values ranging between 57 % and 92 % after fdg - pet , which improved with additional techniques when the tumor had a diameter > 3 cm and / or a suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio > 0.4 .
conclusion the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio is a good predictor of regional tumor extension in nsclc .
this measure is not influenced by intercenter variability and has an accuracy of over 70 % for the identification of malignancy when using a 0.4 cutoff .

the implementation of f - 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) has improved non - invasive lc staging , because this technique adds metabolic information to thoracic imaging and optimizes mediastinal sampling by improving targeting accuracy in comparison with computed tomography ( ct ) [ 1 - 7 ] .
the maximum standard uptake value ( suvmax ) provides information on the metabolic activity of the primary tumor and its regional lymph nodes .
it is usually increased in the mediastinum when lymph nodes show malignant infiltration , although high fdg uptake may also be observed in inflammatory diseases .
several studies have assessed the predictive power of suvmax for identifying malignant extension of lc to lymph nodes in the mediastinum , and various cutoffs for mediastinal malignancy have been proposed , ranging from 2.5 to 5.3 [ 8 - 10 ] .
the extensive use of these cutoffs , however , is limited by the variability in the suvmax values recorded at different fdg - pet centers , which is reported to range between 10 % and 15 % [ 11 , 12 ] .
the use of ratios between suvmax values in the mediastinum and the tumor has been proposed as a way of homogenizing the results obtained at different centers and allows the definition of cutoffs that may not be influenced by intercenter variability [ 13 - 15 ] .
although the sensitivity and specificity of imaging techniques for lc staging have improved with the introduction of fdg - pet , the technique lacks sufficient accuracy to guide treatment after the procedure , mainly because its sensitivity and negative predictive value ( npv ) for malignancy have shown figures below 80 % in most studies [ 6 , 16 - 18 ] .
therefore , in accordance with current guidelines a biopsy is still needed to confirm lymph node involvement , except in peripheral lung cancers below 3 cm in diameter and negative results of imaging studies of the mediastinum in which case the probability of malignancy is very low [ 19 - 21 ] .
endoscopic techniques like endobronchial ultrasonography with needle aspiration ( ebus - na ) are used to confirm fdg - pet results .
however , the npv of this technique after fdg - pet has not been determined , and current guidelines recommend the performance of invasive techniques such as cervical mediastinoscopy after a negative ebus - na before therapeutic surgery , regardless of the fdg - pet imaging results .
the aim of the present study was to identify optimal predictors of mediastinal malignancy from a pet exam which are able to minimize the variability between hospitals and improve the selection of subsequent sampling procedures such as ebus - na. first , the variability and predictive power of absolute and relative suvmax values obtained from the primary tumor and the mediastinum by fdg - pet were assessed in a multicenter lc study ; then , the sensitivity and npv of ebus - na were calculated according with fdg - pet results .
methods design and patients a prospective , multicenter study including patients with a diagnosis of non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) was conducted at five university hospitals between 2010 and 2012 .
patients with suspected nsclc were referred by their general practitioner to one of the participating hospitals for diagnosis and staging .
non - invasive staging examinations included a ct scan of the lung , mediastinum and upper abdomen using a multidetector - row spiral ct scanner , considering nodes in the mediastinum as abnormal when their short - axis diameter was greater than 10 mm , and a fdg - pet in patients with no suspected distant metastasis at first examination .
non - surgical pathological staging was performed by ebus - na , and patients with an ebus - na procedure negative for malignancy in the mediastinum were staged by esophageal ultrasound with needle aspiration ( eus - na ) and / or cervical mediastinoscopy when their thoracic imaging suggested mediastinal malignancy and / or their primary tumor was central or over 3 cm in diameter [ 19 , 20 ] .
all staging procedures were performed 1 - 3 weeks after the first hospital visit , to proceed to treatment not later that one month after that visit , according with fast - track protocols for lung cancer .
patients with hemorrhagic diseases or coagulation disorders were excluded from staging by ebus - na. operability was assessed by physical examination , blood tests and lung function .
only patients with a diagnosis of nsclc who were staged by ct , fdg - pet and ebus - na and treated surgically when staging results were negative were included in the study .
therapeutic surgery with systematic nodal dissection was performed after ebus and mediastinoscopy negative for malignancy , and was considered the gold standard for the present study .
the research protocol was approved by the reference regional ethics committee for the project ( institut de recerca en ciencies de la salut germans trias i pujol , reference : fis ps09 / 01612 ) and by the local ethics committees of all participating centers .
written informed consents were obtained from all participating patients .
f - 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fdg - pet with a integrated ct equipment ( fdg - pet / ct ) ( 4 hospitals ) or performed just after ct ( 1 hospital ) ( phillips , amsterdam , the netherlands ; or general electric , fairfield , connecticut , united states of america ) , was used to stage the mediastinum at each hospital in patients with no suspected distant metastasis at first examination .
prior to 18 f - fdg administration , patients fasted for at least six hours and plasma glucose level was confirmed to be inferior to 175 mg / dl. the patient received intravenously standard activity 3,7 mbq of 18 f - fdg per kg of weight and rested 60 minute for the scheduled uptake period .
fdg - pet images were acquired from mid - skull to the mid - thigh with the patient supine , reconstructed with a standard iterative algorithm , and reformatted into axial , coronal , and sagital views .
administered activity , time of administration , and patient 's body weight were recorded for calculation of maximum standardized uptake values ( suv max ) .
recovered images were interpreted by a nuclear medicine physician who evaluated both the appearance of the primary lung tumor and the hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the mediastinum .
standard uptake values of examined regions were assigned by the software of the equipment used in each hospital .
to quantify the maximal metabolic activity of lymph nodes in the mediastinum their highest suvmax was measured , as an absolute value , as a ratio between this value and the suvmax of the primary tumor , and after the subtraction of this second value from this highest suvmax in the mediastinum [ 13 - 15 ] .
homogeneity of fdg - pet between hospitals was assessed through comparisons of the suvmax values of primary lung tumors and of lymph node regions with the highest suvmax in the mediastinum , both as absolute and as relative values .
cytopathologic staging ebus - na was performed in an outpatient setting using a flexible bronchoscope with a linear scanning transducer ( bfuc180f , olympus optical co ltd. , tokyo , japan ) .
the bronchoscope has a convex distal probe capable of producing linear parallel scans of the mediastinal and peribronchial tissues and a working channel suitable for the performance of na under direct ultrasound guidance .
local anesthesia and sedation were achieved using topical lidocaine spray and intravenous midazolam , propofol and / or fentanyl in accordance with standard recommendations [ 22 ] .
regional lymph node stations of the mediastinum and hilar regions ( stations 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 and 11 ) were systematically imaged and measured , and all nodes with a short - axis diameter of 5 mm or more were sampled with a 22 - gauge needle ( na - 201sx - 4022 , olympus optical co ltd. ) .
samples were categorized according to whether they had been extracted from a normal node , showing lymphocytes and no neoplastic cells , or from a metastatic node , with groups of neoplastic cells .
aspirates containing only bronchial or blood cells , non - diagnostic atypical cells or insufficient material were considered inadequate .
every identified node was sampled at least three times , unless rapid on - site evaluation performed by a pathologist during the procedure confirmed the adequacy of the sample after the first or the second aspiration [ 23 , 24 ] .
patients with negative ebus - na results were staged through eus - na , in left - sided tumors with abnormal lymph nodes by ct and / or fdg - pet in mediastinal regions 7 , 8 or 9 [ 25 - 28 ] .
samples obtained through this procedure were categorized with the same criteria used for ebus - na. patients with negative results in all the endoscopic procedures underwent cervical mediastinoscopy in accordance with guidelines [ 19 , 20 ] .
systematic nodal dissection was performed during therapeutic surgery as the gold standard procedure for mediastinal staging .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical software package version 18 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
results obtained from categorical variables are expressed as absolute and relative frequencies , and results for continuous variables as means and standard deviations ( sd ) when the distribution was normal , or as medians and interquartile ranges ( iqrs ) when the distribution was not normal .
first , absolute suvmax values for the primary tumor and the mediastinal node with highest fdg - pet uptake were measured , and the variability between hospitals assessed using one way anova .
relative values of suvmax in mediastinum ( using suvmax of the primary tumor as the reference ) were calculated , both as a ratio ( suvmax mediastinum / suvmax tumor ) and as a subtraction ( suvmax mediastinum - suvmax tumor ) , and the intercenter variability of these values was measured ( one way anova ) .
second , the predictive power of absolute and relative suvmax values for mediastinal malignancy was assessed , using pathology results as gold standard and applying logistic regression .
the accuracies of different measures of suvmax in the mediastinum were examined using roc analyses and area under the curve ( auc ) .
suvmax cutoffs with maximal accuracy for the identification of mediastinal malignancy were defined , and their predictive powers for the identification of malignancy were calculated through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses .
the results obtained in these analyses were expressed as crude and adjusted odds ratios ( or ) , with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
all variables showing an association with the outcome variable ( p < 0.10 ) in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate models .
finally , to determine the need for additional staging techniques after negative results in ebus - na , the sensitivity and npv of this endoscopic technique for the diagnosis of mediastinal malignancy were assessed in patients at high and low risk according to their suvmax values .
results were compared using the chi - square test .
all tests used in the analyses were two - sided , and a p value of 0.05 or less was reported as statistically significant .
results one hundred and twenty - one patients from five hospitals with a diagnosis of nsclc were enrolled in the study over two years .
their median age was 65.7 years ; adenocarcinoma was the most frequent tumor ( 52.9 %) , and a fdg - pet showed one or more hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the mediastinum in 77.7 % of patients .
the mean suvmax of the primary tumor was 12.3 ( sd 6.3 ) and the median suvmax of the mediastinal node with the highest fdg - pet uptake was 3.9 ( iqr 2.4 - 7.0 ) .
mediastinal malignancy was diagnosed in 65 patients ( 53.7 %) , with ebus - na being the procedure which attained this diagnosis most frequently .
mediastinal lymph node involvement was confirmed through systematic nodal dissection performed during therapeutic surgery in six patients with negative endoscopic procedures and cervical mediastinoscopies ( table 1 ) .

this variability in the mediastinum values disappeared when the suvmax of the image with highest fdg uptake was adjusted for the suvmax of the tumor , either as a ratio ( suvmax mediastinum / tumor ) or as a subtraction ( suvmax mediastinum - tumor ) ( p = 0.083 and p = 0.428 respectively ; one way anova ) ( figs. 2a and 2b ). fig. 1 a variability of fdg - pet between hospitals ( absolute values ) : maximum standard uptake value ( suvmax ) of the tumor ( p = 0.016 , one way anova ) .

equivalent results were found for the median values of the ratio between suvmax in the mediastinum and suvmax of the tumor ( 0.4 ) and the subtraction of this latter value from the suvmax in the mediastinum ( - 6.1 ) ( table 2 ) .
areas under the curve at roc analysis for suvmax in the mediastinum ( auc 0.77 ci 0.69 - 0.86 , p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 3a ) and for the ratio between this value and the suvmax of the tumor ( auc 0.77 ci 0.68 - 0.85 , p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 3b ) were equivalent , confirming that the two measures were equally useful .
the result of subtracting the suvmax of the tumor from the highest suvmax in the mediastinum showed a lower figure , still statistically significant ( auc 0.74 ci 0.6 - 0.83 , p < 0.001 ) .
cutoffs of 4 for suvmax in the mediastinum and of 0.4 for the ratio between the suvmax in the mediastinum and the tumor showed similar sensitivities , specificities and accuracies over 70 % for the identification of mediastinal malignancy ( table 3 ) .
accordingly , these two measures of suvmax in the mediastinum may be considered equivalent , with the advantage of a greater homogeneity between centers when using the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio .

sensitivities and negative predictive values of ebus - na for the diagnosis of mediastinal malignancy , however , did not attain values above 90 % for most of the subgroups categorized according to suvmax in the mediastinum , with equivalent figures for suvmax in the mediastinum and suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratios ( p > 0.05 , chi square test ) ( table 5 ) .
this finding supports the use of additional staging techniques such as eus - na and / or cervical mediastinoscopy to achieve accurate mediastinal staging previous to therapeutic surgery .
in tumors with a suvmax below the cutoff and diameters of 3 cm or less , however , the use of additional techniques in clinical staging in our study did not increase the presurgical sensitivity and negative predictive value , with equivalent results when there is none or one single hypermetabolic lymph node in the mediastinum , or multiple fdg - pet hot spots ( p > 0.05 , chi square test ) .
these results suggest that in this clinical situation it may be possible to proceed to therapeutic surgery and systematic nodal dissection after a negative ebus - na exam .

however , this fdg - pet measure showed variability between centers , a finding that limits its use a marker in staging for a specific hospital .
this variability was corrected when the highest suvmax value in the mediastinum was adjusted by the suvmax of the primary tumor , either as a ratio ( suvmax mediastinum / tumor ) or as a subtraction ( suvmax tumor - mediastinum ) .
the ratio between the suvmax in the mediastinum and the primary tumor emerged as the best relative predictor of nodal involvement by lc when attaining values over 0.4 , showing a similar accuracy to suvmax in the mediastinum expressed as an absolute value , without its intercenter variability .
the presence of significant intercenter differences in suvmax values obtained from fdg - pet in lc patients is confirmed in our study , that shows that these differences can be corrected if the suvmax of the primary tumor is used to adjust mediastinal values .
intercenter variability in suvmax in the tumor and mediastinum has been reported in previous studies , depending on the scanner , reconstruction protocols [ 11 , 12 ] , and time between dose injection and imaging [ 14 ] .
the use of the ratio between the suvmax in the mediastinum and tumor ( suvmax mediastinum / tumor ) was first proposed by cerfolio and cols .
as a way of correcting intercenter variability [ 13 ] , and this relative value has been used successfully by other authors to identify mediastinal malignancy [ 14 , 15 ] .
our study confirms the utility of the adjustment of suvmax in the mediastinum using the suvmax of the tumor , either as a ratio or as a subtraction , in order to avoid intercenter variability , allowing the comparison of results between centers .
the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio emerged as the best predictor of mediastinal involvement in lc. this measure was not affected by intercenter variability , and attained a high auc value , equivalent to the figure obtained by suvmax when expressed as an absolute value and higher than the subtraction suvmax mediastinum - tumor .
the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio showed an or 6.62 ( 2.98 - 14.69 ) for mediastinal malignancy when above 0.4 , similar to the or of 10.68 ( 4.55 - 25.10 ) found for absolute values of suvmax in the mediastinum when above 4 .
this suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio cutoff attained a sensitivity of 70.8 and an accuracy of 71.9 % for the identification of malignancy , similar to the results achieved using absolute values .
the cutoffs proposed in previous studies for suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratios for attaining a sensitivity above 70 % have ranged between 0.28 and 0.56 [ 13 - 15 ] , and our results confirm that the use of a 0.4 cutoff , inside this range , attains a sensitivity above this figure .
to attain an equivalent sensitivity for the identification of malignancy , absolute suvmax values in the mediastinum ranging between 2.5 and 5.3 have been proposed [ 8 - 10 , 17 ] , but they remain unsuitable for intercenter comparisons .
adenocarcinoma type , younger age and multiple fdg - pet hypermetabolic lymph nodes , were significantly associated with extension to the mediastinum of nsclc in the present study , but the predictive power of the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio for malignant extension did not change after adjustment for these variables .
however , in spite of its usefulness for the identification of mediastinal extension in lc , fdg - pet did not obtain an accuracy above 80 % , and sampling of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum is required for the confirmation of positive imaging results and the identification of malignancy in patients who have negative fdg - pet exams but are at a high risk of regional extension [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 17 ] .
ebus - na is the first approach for mediastinal sampling after fdg - pet , and in the present study it increased the accuracy of clinical staging independently of the fdg - pet results .
ebus - na only attained a sensitivity over 80 % when fdg - pet value was above the cutoff , however , and showed a npv below 70 % in this subgroup of patients .
these results are not high enough to obviate the need for additional staging procedures before surgery such as eus - na and mediastinoscopy in order to minimize understaging , except in patients with tumors with a diameter of 3 cm or below , where the npv of clinical staging with ebus - na did not increase with additional sampling through eus and / or mediastinoscopy .
these findings support the recommendation in current guidelines of mediastinal sampling using ebus - na after fdg - pet in nsclc [ 19 , 20 ] , and suggest that this endoscopic technique may be enough for presurgical staging in patients with lung tumors up to 3 cm in diameter , when the highest suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio was below 0.4 .
conclusion suvmax mediastinum and the suvmax mediastinum / tumor ratio are both good predictors of mediastinal malignancy in nsclc , and both show accuracies over 70 % at values above 4 and 0.4 respectively .
when suvmax is measured as a ratio it is not influenced by intercenter variability , and allows comparisons between hospitals without additional adjustments .
the presence of multiple fdg - pet hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the mediastinum predicts the regional extension of the tumor , but presents a much lower or than suvmax , and thus has a lower diagnostic power than the measurement of suv .
however , most fdg - pet results obtained in the mediastinum during lc staging would need to be confirmed through semi - invasive techniques , given that the predictive values of the technique remain below 90 % .
ebus - na increases the accuracy of fdg - pet , and may be enough for presurgical staging in small tumors with low suvmax mediastinum / tumor values .

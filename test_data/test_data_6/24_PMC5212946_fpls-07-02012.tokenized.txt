cf - 12 is an effective gene for resisting tomato leaf mold disease caused by cladosporium fulvum ( c. fulvum ) .
unlike many other cf genes such as cf - 2 , cf - 4 , cf - 5 , and cf - 9 , no physiological races of c. fulvum that are virulent to cf - 12 carrying plant lines have been identified .
in order to better understand the molecular mechanism of cf - 12 gene resistance response , rna - seq was used to analyze the transcriptome changes at three different stages of c. fulvum infection ( 0 , 4 , and 8 days post infection [ dpi ]) .
a total of 9100 differentially expressed genes ( degs ) between 4 and 0 dpi , 8643 degs between 8 and 0 dpi and 2547 degs between 8 and 4 dpi were identified .
in addition , we found that 736 degs shared among the above three groups , suggesting the presence of a common core of degs in response to c. fulvum infection .
these degs were significantly enriched in defense - signaling pathways such as the calcium dependent protein kinases pathway and the jasmonic acid signaling pathway .
additionally , we found that many transcription factor genes were among the degs , indicating that transcription factors play an important role in c. fulvum defense response .
our study provides new insight on the molecular mechanism of cf resistance to c. fulvum , especially the unique features of cf - 12 in responding to c. fulvum infection .
cladosporium fulvum resistance response rna - seq differentially expressed genes cf - 12 tomato national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180931572137 introduction cladosporium fulvum ( c. fulvum , syn .
passalora fulva ) is a biotrophic pathogen of tomato ( solanum lycopersicum ) , which causes leaf mold disease ( cooke , 1883 ) .
this fungus infects primarily the foliage , and occasionally the petioles and stems ( butler and jones , 1949 ; jones et al. , 1997 ) .
the infection often results in wilting leaves and defoliation , which reduce fruit yield and quality , and sometimes death of the entire plant ( thomma et al. , 2005 ). c. fulvum has many physiological races , and new physiological races continue to be evolved ( westerink et al. , 2004 ) .
these physiological races differ in race - specific elicitor proteins encoded by effector genes , and one of which is recognized as the avr gene .
the effector proteins are secreted into the apoplastic space during infection ( nekrasov et al. , 2006 ) , and induce either a compatible or incompatible interaction between the fungus and infected plant .
an incompatible interaction ( chlorosis ) occurs when the plant is able to resist the pathogen and prevent infection , while a compatible interaction ( necrosis ) occurs when the pathogen is able to grow and ramify , causing necrosis to the infected cells ( hammond - kosack and jones , 1996 ) .
one of the most efficient containments is breeding c. fulvum - resistant tomato cultivars by introducing cf resistance genes identified from wild solanum species into cultivated tomato .
more than 20 cf genes have been identified since the discovery of the cf - 1 gene in the 1930s ( lanford , 1937 ; kanwar et al. , 1980a ) , and these have been introduced into cultivated tomato ( kerr and bailey , 1964 ; kanwar et al. , 1980a,b ; stevens and rick , 1986 ; dickinson et al. , 1993 ; jones et al. , 1993 ; joosten and de wit , 1999 ; haanstra et al. , 2000 ; zhao et al. , 2016 ) .
the recognition of plant to pathogen and its subsequent response is a complex and dynamic process ( joosten and de wit , 1999 ; rivas and thomas , 2005 ) .
at least three layers of pathogen recognition / response mechanisms are present in plants .
the first one is basal resistance , also known as innate immunity , which can be triggered by microbe - associated molecular patterns such as cell wall components found in microbes .
when a pathogen suppresses the basal defense , plants may respond with a hypersensitive response ( hr ) characterized by deliberate cell death at the site of infection .
the third layer of defense is called rna silencing , where plants recognize and digest the dna or rna produced by viruses , making these unusable. c. fulvum penetrates the abaxial side of the leaf and secretes toxic avirulence proteins ( avrs ) and extracellular proteins .
these specific elicitors are recognized by cf genes ( lauge et al. , 1998 ) and trigger a hypersensitive response .
as a result , these infected parenchyma and epidermal cells collapse and eventually form typical necrotic spots ( steinkamp et al. , 1979 ; feindt et al. , 1981 ) .
studies have unraveled the distinct recognition mechanism between cf genes and avrs such as the interaction between cf - 2 and avr2 ( kruger et al. , 2002 ; luderer et al. , 2002 ) and between cf - 9 and avr9 ( koomangersmann et al. , 1996 ) .
studies have also revealed that gene expression patterns between cf - 4 / avr4 - and cf - 9 / avr9 - dependent defense responses have similar gene expression patterns ( romeis et al. , 2001 ; gabriels et al. , 2006 ; nekrasov et al. , 2006 ; hong et al. , 2007 ; van den burg et al. , 2008 ) .
the cf - 12 gene was identified through the large screening of c. fulvum resistant genes ( kanwar et al. , 1980b ) .
it is located at position 31 cm on chromosome 8 of the lycopersicon esculentum .
cf - 12 is efficiently resistant to c. fulvum , but little is known about the molecular mechanism of its defense response .
in addition , none of the physiological races of c. fulvum are virulent to cf - 12 carrying plant lines , while many physiological races have been found to be virulent to other cf genes , including cf - 2 , cf - 4 , cf - 5 , and cf - 9 .
rna - seq has been widely and successfully applied in biological analysis , particularly in plants ( hong et al. , 2007 ; varshney et al. , 2009 ; haas and zody , 2010 ) such as wheat ( yang et al. , 2015 ) , rice ( bai et al. , 2015 ) , maize ( li et al. , 2010 ) , cabbage ( wang et al. , 2016a ) , and cucumber ( zhang et al. , 2014 ) .
in this study , the comprehensive transcriptome analysis of cf - 12 - tomato at different infection stages was performed to identify differentially expressed genes ( degs ) .
the identified degs were further verified by qrt - pcr and analyzed using gene ontology ( go ) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) .
our results can help identify the key genes and pathways associated with cf - 12 - mediated resistance response , and better understand the molecular mechanism of cf resistance to fungal infection .
materials and methods plants , c. fulvum strains , and pathogen infection the resistant tomato line of cf - 12 - tomato ( cgn7495 ) and the susceptible line moneymaker were obtained from the chinese academy of agricultural sciences ( beijing , china ) .
they were grown in a greenhouse at the horticultural station of northeast agricultural university ( harbin , china ) .
the growing condition was 16 - h light and 8 - h darkness at 25degreesc with an ambient humidity of 95 %. c. fulvum physiological race 1.2.3 was acquired from tomato - growing regions in harbin using the single sporangiophore transfer method , as previously described ( hubbeling , 1971 ; wong and wilcox , 2000 ) ; and was further axenically propagated on moneymaker .
at the four - five leaf stage , the abaxial surface of the cf - 12 - tomato seedlings was inoculated with a suspension of 1 x 107 sporangia per ml ( wang et al. , 2007 ) .
leaf samples were harvested at 0 - 15 days of post - infection ( dpi ) for microscopic analysis .
microscopic observation of c. fulvum in cf - 12 tomato in order to observe the interaction process of c. fulvum on cf - 12 tomato , the lactophenol trypan blue staining method was carried out according franco 's approach ( franco et al. , 2008 ) .
the fungal tissue and dead host cells would be densely stained , while living host cells would impart a translucent and slightly brown color .
the leaf samples were harvested at 0 - 15 dpi , immediately stained , clarified overnight in chloral hydrate solution ( 2.5 mg / ml ) ( keogh et al. , 1980 ) , and examined using an evos ( r ) microscope ( thermofisher , usa ) and an olympus szx10 dissecting microscope ( olympus , japan ) .
rna extraction , library preparation , and sequencing total rna from cf - 12 - tomato leaves was extracted and analyzed , as previously described ( fang et al. , 2015 ) .
the integrity of the isolated rna was calculated , as previously described ( schroeder et al. , 2006 ) ; and samples with an rna integrity number > 9.0 were used for libraries construction .
the libraries were generated using the nebnext ( r ) ultra ( tm ) rna library prep kit for illumina ( r ) ( neb , usa ) .
the clustering of the index - coded samples was performed on a cbot cluster generation system using the truseq pe cluster kit v3 - cbot - hs ( illumia ) .
after cluster generation , the libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform conducted by the novogene bioinformatics institute ( beijing , china ) ; and 150 - bp paired - end reads were generated .
quality control , mapping , and de novo assembly raw sequence data were processed using perl scripts ( http :// www.perl.org ) , developed by novogene bioinformatics institute ( beijing , china ) , in order to remove reads that contained adapter fragments and ploy - n stretches ( the number of ploy - ns is > 10 %) .
phred quality scores ( q20 : ratio of an error rate 1 % , q30 : ratio of an error rate 0.1 %) and gc - content were calculated , and only the data with a quality score ( qphred ) >= 30 ( q30 ) were used for further analyses .
the reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from the ensembl genomes databases ( ftp :// ftp.ensemblgenomes.org / pub / release - 23 / plants / fasta / solanum _ lycopersicum / dna /) .
an index of the reference genome was built using bowtie v2.2.3 ( langmead and salzberg , 2012 ) , and paired - end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using tophat2 v2.0.12 ( kim et al. , 2013 ) .
cufflinks v2.1.1 ( trapnell et al. , 2010 , 2012 ) was used to construct and identify both known and novel transcripts from tophat2 alignment results .
quantification and differential expression analysis of transcripts htseq v0.6.1 ( embl , heidelberg , germany ) was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene .
gene expression levels were calculated based on the length of the gene , sequencing depth and read count mapped to this gene using the fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs sequenced ( fpkm ; trapnell et al. , 2010 ) method .
genes with fpkms in intervals of 1 - 3 , 3 - 15 , 15 - 60 , and beyond 60 were considered to be expressed at low level , medium level , high level and very high level , respectively .
after calculating the gene expression levels , a differential expression analysis of two conditions or groups was performed using the deseq r package ( 1.18.0 ) ( anders and huber , 2010 ) .
deseq provides statistical strategies to determine differential gene expression using the negative binomial distribution model ( kij ~ nb [ muij , sigmaij2 ]) .
the resulting p - values and fold - changes were adjusted using the benjamini - hochberg 's approach to control the false discovery rate ( fdr <= dre5 ; benjamini and hochberg , 1995 ) .
genes with an adjusted p - value ( padj ) < 0.05 were considered to be significant degs .
validation of degs by quantitative real - time pcr eighteen degs involved in plant disease resistance pathways were validated using quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) .
the primer pairs of the selected genes were designed using primer premier 6.0 ( premier biosoft , canada ; table s1 ) .
the tomato actin gene ( u60478.1 ) was used as a reference control .
the qrt - pcr was performed using aceq ( r ) qpcr sybr ( r ) green master mix ( vazyme , usa ) on an iq ( tm ) 5 multicolor real - time pcr detection system ( bio - rad , usa ) .
the reaction parameters were as follows : 95degreesc for 7 min , and 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 s , 58degreesc for 30 s , and 72degreesc for 20 s. each sample was repeated three times , and relative expression levels were evaluated using the 2 - deltadeltact method ( livak and schmittgen , 2001 ) .
go and kegg enrichment analysis of degs the go enrichment analysis of degs was performed using the go - seq based on wallenius non - central hyper - geometric distribution ( young et al. , 2010 ) , in which gene length bias in degs were adjusted by bonferroni correction .
go terms with a corrected p < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by degs .
kegg pathway enrichment ( http :// www.genome.jp / kegg /) was used to identify significantly enriched signal transduction pathways or metabolic pathways in degs .
significantly enriched deg pathways were identified using the kobas 2.0 software ( kobas , surrey , uk ; xie et al. , 2011 ) , and adjusted by hyper - geometric test and benjamini - hochberg fdr correction ( fdr <= f.05 ) .
results microscopy observation of c. fulvum invasion into cf - 12 tomato leaves light microscopy was used to observe the interaction process between c. fulvum and cf - 12 tomato , or the moneymaker leaves .
a representative image of the c. fulvum mycelium and spores are shown in figure 1a .
our results revealed that conidiospores germinated at 2 or 3 dpi ( figure 1b ) , the hypha started penetrating into the stomata at 4 dpi in both the moneymaker and cf - 2 tomato ( figures 1c,d ) .
no difference was observed between the two cultivars at this stage .
then , the hypha penetrated into the intercellular space and continued from the substomatal cavity into the intercellular space between the spongy mesophyll cells ( thomma et al. , 2005 ) , emerging through the stomata at 8 dpi and gradually plugging the stomata at 10 dpi on the moneymaker cultivar ( figures 1e,f ) .
however , cells surrounding the stomata appeared to die ( necrosis ) at 8 dpi on cf - 12 tomato ( figure 1g ) ; and a large number of necrotic spots began to appear at 10 dpi ( figure 1h ) .
the area of necrosis was gradually enlarged at 12 - 15 dpi ( figures 1i,j ) .
in the advanced stages of disease development , the hyphae formed a thick , gray - white mold layer on the abaxial surface of the leaves at 15 dpi on the moneymaker cultivar ( figure 1k ) and formed yellow necrotic spots on the front side of the leaf on cf - 12 tomato ( figure 1l ) .
this observation is in agreement with the results of a previous study ( thomma et al. , 2005 ) .
based on this observation , we selected cf - 12 tomato samples at 0 , 4 , and 8 dpi for mrna - seq and qrt - pcr analysis .

rna sequencing and transcripts identification in order to investigate differences in transcriptome between c. fulvum - infected cf - 12 tomatoes ( cf12 _ b , 4 dpi ; cf12 _ c , 8 dpi ) and non - infected controls ( cf12 _ a , 0 dpi ) , rna from these three samples were sequenced .
an average of 59,291,565 , 56,131,442 and 70,822,873 raw reads from cf12 _ a ( 0 dpi ) , cf12 _ b ( 4 dpi ) , and cf12 _ c ( 8 dpi ) were generated , respectively ( table 1 , figure s1 ) .
after removing adaptors , low quality reads , duplications and ambiguous reads , an average of 60 million clean reads were obtained for each sample ; and 94 % of these clean reads were at the q30 ( ratio of error rate <= 0.1 %) level ( table 1 ) .
furthermore , at least 89 % of these clean reads were mapped ; of which , ~ 88 % were uniquely mapped and 0.7 % were multiple mapped to tomato chromosomes , respectively ( table s2 ) .
pearson correlation coefficient ( r2 ) analysis of the fpkm distribution between different biological replicates revealed a high level of reproducibility of rna expression patterns ( r2 = 0.98 - 0.99 , p < 0.001 ; table 2 , figure s2 ) .
a large majority of reads were mapped to the genome exon regions ( figure s3 ) , and reads density was positively correlated to chromosome length ( figure s4 ) .
cufflinks analysis revealed a total of 15,395 transcripts from the three samples ( cf12 _ a , cf12 _ b , and cf12 _ c ) , including 14,494 known transcripts ( table s3 ) and 901 new transcripts ( table s4 ) .

the identification of differentially expressed genes between the infected and non - infected cf - 12 tomato degs were identified using the deseq software with a padj < 0.05 .
for cf12 _ b vs. cf12 _ a , 9100 degs were detected , including 4080 upregulated and 5020 downregulated degs ( table s5a , figure 2 ) ; for cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ a , 8643 degs were detected ( 3999 upregulated and 4644 downregulated degs ; table s5b , figure 2 ) ; and for cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ b , 2547 degs were identified ( 1729 upregulated and 818 downregulated degs ; table s5c , figure 2 ) .
in addition , 736 degs were shared among the three groups ( cf12 _ b vs. cf12 _ a , cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ a , and cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ b ) .
approximately 1500 degs were shared between cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ a and cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ b , or cf12 _ b vs. cf12 _ a and cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ b .
however , 6426 degs were shared between cf12 _ b vs. cf12 _ a and cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ a .
this further suggests that a common group of genes were activated or deactivated upon c. fulvum infection ( figure 3 ) .
in order to observe the overall changes of the quantity of gene expression , a hierarchical clustering of degs using fpkm analysis was performed .
results revealed that after the inoculation of c. fulvum on cf - 12 tomato , genes with low expression quantity in cf12 _ a increased in expression ( in both cf12 _ b and cf12 _ c ) .
on the contrary , many genes with high expression quantity in cf12 _ a decreased in expression in cf12 _ b or cf12 _ c ( figure 4 ) .
changes in gene expression quantity were also observed between cf12 _ b and cf12 _ c ( figure 4 ) , suggesting that the response of cf - 12 tomato to c. fulvum infection changes as time progresses .

the blue bands indicate low gene expression quantity , and the red bands represent high gene expression quantity .
the identification of gene expression patterns of degs in order to identify these similar expression patterns , the relative expression level of degs were analyzed by k - means clustering algorithm ( hartigan and wong , 2013 ) .
clustering analysis revealed that six expression patterns ( subclusters ) of degs were identified ( figure 5 ) .
the most prominent group was subcluster _ 5 , in which 5343 genes were upregulated after c. fulvum infection .
a similar pattern was observed in subcluster _ 4 , where genes revealed a higher expression level in cf12 _ b and cf12 _ c ; however , the number of genes was much lesser than that in subcluster _ 5 .
subcluster _ 1 , subcluster _ 2 and subcluster _ 6 revealed a similar expression pattern , in which most of the genes were downregulated in cf12 _ b and cf12 _ c ; but the downregulated level was relatively small .
subcluster _ 3 contained 41 genes that were downregulated in cf12 _ b , but were upregulated in cf12 _ c .
these dynamic gene expression patterns further suggest that cf - 12 tomato was resistant to c. fulvum via a highly complex process .
figure 5 the clustering of degs expression patterns .
the six expression patterns of degs obtained by k - means clustering algorithm is shown , which are represented as upregulated ( subcluster _ 4 and subcluster _ 5 ) , transient ( subcluster _ 3 ) , and downregulated ( subcluster _ 1 , subcluster _ 2 , and subcluster _ 6 ) .
expression ratios are expressed as log2 .
validation of rna - seq data by qrt - pcr in order to validate the rna - seq data , qrt - pcr was performed through 18 degs using three biological replicates .
these 18 genes were selected to reflect some of the functional categories and pathways described below ( section go and kegg enrichment analysis of degs ) , such as the plant - pathogen interaction pathway and plant hormone signal transduction pathway ( table s1 ) .
these qrt - pcr results were compared with the rna - seq data .
as shown in figure 6 , the trends of these gene expression patterns were consistent and had a strong positive correlation coefficient ( r2 = 0.9619 ) , indicating that the rna - seq data was reliable .
figure 6 correlation of expression levels between rna - seq and qrt - pcr .
go and kegg enrichment analysis of degs in order to further characterize the functions of degs , go enrichment analysis was performed using goseq .
the top 10 enrichment terms of the biological process , cellular component and molecular function were selected , respectively , as the main nodes of the directed acyclic graph .
in the biological process category , significant terms were enriched in the phosphorus metabolic process , protein phosphorylation biological process , cellular protein modification process , salicylic acid metabolic process , response to jasmonic acid , and salicylic acid biosynthetic process .
these processes were generally associated with disease resistance ( figure s5a ) .
components associated with membranes such as thylakoid , plastid thylakoid membranes , and photosynthetic membranes ( figure s5b ) were significantly enriched in the cellular component category .
in the molecular function category , transferase activity , phosphotransferase activity and protein serine / threonine kinase activity were enriched in catalytic activity ; and purine nucleoside binding , anion binding , nucleoside binding , adenyl nucleotide binding and atp binding were enriched in binding ( figure s5c ) .
these binding terms and catalytic activity terms played an important role in signal recognition and signal transduction .
one interesting finding is that many transcription factor genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated in response to c. fulvum .
a total of 406 transcription factor - related degs were identified and annotated into 60 families ( perez - rodriguez et al. , 2010 ; jin et al. , 2014 ; wang et al. , 2016b ; table s6 ) .
these 60 transcription factor families were grouped into two clusters ( figure s6 ) .
the majority of degs in cluster i revealed an upregulation trend at the early stage ( cf12 _ b ) and a downregulated trend at the later stages ( cf12 _ c ) .
in cluster ii , degs exhibited a higher expression at both stages or only at the later stage .
for example , one of the myb family transcription factors ( solyc05g053150.1 ) was upregulated to more than 5 - fold in both cf12 _ b vs. cf12 _ a and cf12 _ c vs. cf12 _ a ( table s6 ) .
this protein , like most of the 406 transcription factors , remains uncharacterized ; and is predicted to be a myb23 - like transcription factor .
the downregulation of transcription factors was also identified .
for example , the ofp family solyc09g065350.1 ( wang et al. , 2005 ) , another uncharacterized transcription factor , was downregulated to ~ 5 - fold in both infection stages .
this result suggests that transcription factors play a critical role in response , especially in the early response , to c. fulvum infection .
the kegg pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify the biological pathways of incompatible interaction .
it was found that the plant - pathogen interaction pathway was significantly enriched ( fdr <= 0.05 ) .
as shown in figure 7 , the number of genes and the rich factor are significantly higher than the other pathways .
many other disease - resistance pathways , including stilbenoid and gingerol biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , ubiquinone and quinone biosynthesis , flavonoid biosynthesis , pentose phosphate pathway , and nitrogen metabolism were also enriched .
in addition , it was found that the transduction plant hormone signals , the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids , fatty acid metabolism , and carbon metabolism participate in cf - 12 tomato response to c. fulvum infection .

rich factor is the ratio of the deg number to the background number in a certain pathway .
the size of the dots represents the number of genes , and the color of the dots represents the range of the q - value .
discussion in this study , we investigated the transcriptome profiles of cf - 12 tomato in response to c. fulvum infection using rna - seq .
more than 20,000 transcripts were identified from these three samples ( cf12 _ a , 0 dpi ; cf12 _ b , 4 dpi ; cf12 _ c , 8 dpi ) , in which 9100 degs between cf12 _ b and cf12 _ a , and 8643 degs between cf12 _ c and cf12 _ a were identified .
go and kegg analyses revealed that many degs and their associated pathways are involved in disease resistance against fungal pathogens such as calcium dependent protein kinases ( cdpk ) , wound salicylic acid inducible protein kinase ( sipk ) , respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein d / b ( rboh ) , heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) and suppressor of g2 allele of skp1 ( sgt1 ; piedras et al. , 1998 ; rivas and thomas , 2005 ; nekrasov et al. , 2006 ; hong et al. , 2007 ) .
in order to cope with the infection of c. fulvum , tomato plants have established a series of defense mechanisms through a complex signal transduction network .
the first layer of defense is to recognize c. fulvum by pattern recognition receptors , and initiate the resistance response ( miya et al. , 2007 ) .
in our study , chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 ( cerk1 , solyc07g049190.2 , and solyc07g049180.2 ) , a pattern recognition protein , was abundantly expressed after infection .
it would be interesting to conduct further studies to see whether a higher expression of cerk1 is involved in the activation of chitin signaling .
after the recognition of infection , cf - 12 tomato quickly established complex signal defense pathways such as cdpk .
in our study , cdpk ( solyc03g113390.2 , solyc10g074570.1 , solyc02g083850.2 , and solyc10g076900.1 ) and mekk1 ( solyc01g104530.2 , and solyc07g053170.2 ) were expressed higher at the early stage of infection , and subsequently stimulated the respiratory burst oxidase homolog ( rboh , solyc01g099620.2 , and solyc03g117980.2 ) at a later stage .
this is consistent with previous studies suggesting that these genes play critical roles in cf - 12 tomato response to c. fulvum infection .
the jasmonic acid , brassinosteroid , and ethylene pathways play important roles in the resistance to biotrophic pathogens such as downy mildew and powdery ( ellis and turner , 2001 ; walters et al. , 2002 ) .
in the present study , we found that the jasmonate - zim - domain gene ( jaz , solyc12g009220.1 ) , which encodes a major protein in the jasmonic acid signaling pathway , was upregulated after c. fulvum infection .
brassinosteroid insensitive 1 - associated receptor kinase 1 ( bak1 , solyc01g104970.2 ) , brassinosteroid - signaling kinase ( bsk , solyc10g085000.1 ) , ethylene receptor ( etr , solyc06g053710.2 ) and ethylene response factor 1 / 2 ( erf1 / 2 , solyc09g066360.1 ) were also upregulated ; suggesting that similar to previous studies , jasmonic acid , brassinosteroid , and ethylene may play a role in the resistance of cf - 12 tomato to c. fulvum .
physiological races of c. fulvum that are virulent to cf - 2 , cf - 4 , cf - 5 , and cf - 9 have been reported ( piedras et al. , 1998 ; romeis et al. , 2001 ; nekrasov et al. , 2006 ; hong et al. , 2007 ; varshney et al. , 2009 ) .
however , no physiological race virulent to cf - 12 has been identified .
in the present study , we revealed that genes encoding the npr1 - like protein ( solyc07g040690.2 and solyc02g069310.2 ) and the transcription factor tga ( solyc11g068370.1 and solyc06g074320.2 ) were upregulated , and both of which are involved in the salicylic acid signaling pathway .
this could lead to a higher expression of pathogenesis - related protein 1 ( pr1 ) during the disease resistance process .
a previous report suggested that the salicylic acid pathway is not required for cf - 2 - or cf - 9 - dependent resistance to c. fulvum ( brading et al. , 2000 ) , suggesting that the salicylic acid pathway might be a unique pathway for cf - 12 - dependent resistance .
responses to infection depend on different gene expression levels , which require various transcription factors .
it has been reported that many transcription factors such as wrky , nac , myb , and bzip families ( singh et al. , 2002 ; olsen et al. , 2005 ) actively respond to c. fulvum infections .
consistent with previous reports , we found that 35 transcription factors in the myb family were differentially expressed ; and one of which ( solyc05g053150.1 ) had the highest level of upregulation among all transcription factor degs .
many tf families such as tub , tcp , set , sbp , phd , and orphans have not been reported in the regulation of tomato leaf mold disease resistance , but some of these tfs have been reported in grapevine ( vitis amurensis ) against downy mildew ( li et al. , 2015 ) and in ramie against root - lesion nematode infection ( zhu et al. , 2014 ) .
in addition , majority of the degs reported in this study remain uncharacterized .
further studies of these transcription factors related degs could greatly help understand the molecular mechanism of the defense response to c. fulvum infection .
in summary , based on our microscopic data and go / kegg analysis of rna - seq data , we believe that the cf - 12 tomato response to c. fulvum infection follows several steps .
when the mycelium of c. fulvum grows into the interspace of the stomata and mesophyll cells , the effector proteins secreted by c. fulvum are rapidly recognized by cf - 12 tomato .
this triggers downstream defense signaling transductions associated with the ca2 + channel , as well as several pathways , including pathways involving jasmonic acid , brassinosteroid and ethylene .
then , these defense - related transcription factors ( tfs ) such as myb proteins ( moore et al. , 2011 ; van verk et al. , 2011 ; puranik et al. , 2012 ) are triggered ; which actively regulate downstream resistance pathways .
finally , hypersensitive necrosis occurs locally ( hammond - kosack and jones , 1996 ) , and the c. fulvum hyphae is restricted only in infected areas .
this study facilitates our understanding of the molecular mechanism of cf - 12 tomato against c. fulvum infection .

here we show that the spi - 2 t3ss effector spvd suppresses proinflammatory immune responses .
spvd prevented activation of an nf - kb - dependent promoter and caused nuclear accumulation of importin - alpha , which is required for nuclear import of p65 .

introduction the nf - kb signalling pathway has a central role in the host response to infection by microbial pathogens , by stimulating innate and acquired host immune responses .
under normal physiological conditions , transcription factors of the nf - kb family such as p65 remain inactive in the cytoplasm through their interaction with inhibitors , the ikbalpha proteins , which mask the nuclear localisation signal ( nls ) of transcription factors .
following engagement of extracellular bacterial lps by toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) or tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) by the tnf receptor ( tfnr ) , different pathways lead to phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of ikbalpha , allowing the nf - kb subunits to bind the adaptor protein importin - alpha ( kpna ) .
this complex then interacts with one of up to 20 importin - beta family members to enable nuclear transport through the nuclear pore complex .
within the nucleus , rangtp binds to importin - beta , dissociating the import complex and releasing the nf - kb subunits to initiate transcription of their target genes .
importin - beta complexed with rangtp is recycled to the cytoplasm while export of kpna follows its interaction with the beta - karyopherin exportin - 2 ( xpo2 , also called cas ) and rangtp .
finally , cytoplasmic ran gtpase activating protein ( rangap ) stimulates the ran gtpase , generating rangdp , which dissociates from the importins and thereby releases them for another import cycle [ 1,2 ] .
many pathogens , including salmonella enterica , have acquired mechanisms that interfere with nf - kb signalling .
numerous components of the nf - kb signalling pathway are targeted by pathogen - mediated post - translational modifications ( ptms ) that result in attenuation of the nf - kb dependent responses [ 3 - 9 ] .
salmonella has two type iii secretion systems ( t3ss ) encoded within the salmonella pathogenicity islands ( spis ) 1 and 2 that deliver virulence effector proteins into the host cell .
the spi - 1 t3ss effectors are translocated across epithelial cell plasma membranes and mediate bacterial invasion and intestinal inflammation [ 10 ] , while the spi - 2 t3ss translocates approximately 30 different effectors across the vacuolar membrane .
some of these maintain vacuolar membrane integrity and enable bacterial growth [ 11,12 ] .
a few have been shown to interfere with host cell inflammatory responses .
for example , spvc has phosphothreonine lyase activity on mapks [ 13,14 ] , ssph1 ( translocated both by spi - 1 and spi - 2 t3sss [ 15 ]) binds to the kinase pkn1 [ 16 ] , which in turn regulates nf - kb and jnk signalling and avra ( also translocated both by spi - 1 and spi - 2 t3sss [ 17 ] inhibits nf - kb pathway in epithelial cells [ 18 ] via the jnk pathway [ 19 ] and tight junction stabilization [ 20 ] .
pipa , goga and gtga redundantly target components of the nf - kb signaling pathway to inhibit transcriptional responses leading to inflammation [ 21 ] .
here , we used macrophages lacking tlr4 to reveal that the spi - 2 t3ss effector spvd suppressed production of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
we found that spvd interfered with the nf - kb signalling pathway by preventing nuclear accumulation of p65 .
this was associated with nuclear accumulation of importin - alpha family members that are required for nuclear import of p65 .
interestingly , spvd interacted specifically with exportin xpo2 , which mediates nuclear - cytoplasmic recycling of importins .
together , this work reveals that a bacterial pathogen prevents host cell immune responses by interfering with nuclear transport machinery .
results suppression of proinflammatory immune responses by spi - 2 t3ss effectors we previously reported increases of more than 10 - fold in mrna for 26 genes in wild - type mouse bone marrow - derived macrophages ( bmm ) infected for 10 h by s. typhimurium [ 22 ] .
many of these are likely to be due to the predominant effect of lps on pro - inflammatory signalling pathways , since lps and salmonella cells induced similar changes in raw 264.7 macrophages gene expression at 4 h post - challenge [ 23 ] .
to analyse the effect of the spi - 2 t3ss in the context of tlr4 - induced responses , we selected three genes ( tnf - alpha , il1 - beta and serpinb2 ) that are induced by lps [ 23,24 ] .
their mrna levels were measured in bmm from wild - type and tlr4 knock - out ( tlr4 - / - ) mice , infected with wild - type or deltassav ( spi - 2 t3ss null mutant ) s. typhimurium for 10 h to allow sufficient time for spi - 2 t3ss effector translocation and activity , while minimising the difference in overall intracellular growth rate between wild - type and deltassav mutant bacteria .
the fold - increase in intracellular bacterial numbers ( calculated from the ratio of the cfu at 10 h compared to 2 h post - uptake ) was 2.20 +/ - 0.34 for the wild - type and 0.89 +/ - 0.09 for deltassav mutant bacteria .
following infection of wild - type bmm for 10 h , the rna levels of tnf - alpha , il1 - beta and serpinb2 ( quantified by real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr )) increased by between 40 and 400 fold , and no significant differences were observed between bmm infected with wild - type or deltassav mutant bacteria ( fig 1a and 1b , s1 fig ) .
similar increases were detected following exposure of wild - type bmm to lps , suggesting that tlr4 signalling accounted for the majority of these changes ( fig 1a and 1b , s1 fig ) .
however , tlr4 - / - bmm infected with the deltassav mutant had statistically significant higher levels of tnf - alpha and il1 - beta mrna transcripts than bmm infected with wild - type bacteria ( fig 1a and 1b ) .
no difference was observed for serpinb2 mrna transcripts levels ( s1 fig ) , indicating that transcription of not all the lps - responsive genes was affected by the spi2 - t3ss .
levels of secreted tnf - alpha from tlr4 - / - bmm infected with spi - 2 null mutants ( deltassav or deltasseb ) were also significantly greater than from tlr4 - / - bmm infected with wild - type bacteria or a complemented spi - 2 null mutant ( deltasseb , psseb ) ( fig 1c ) .
the level of secreted il1 - beta was below the threshold of detection at 10 h post - bacterial uptake but was also reduced in a spi - 2 t3ss - dependent manner at 24 h post - bacterial uptake ( fig 1d ) .
together these results provide evidence that the spi - 2 t3ss suppresses pro - inflammatory cytokine mrna levels and protein secretion in tlr4 - / - macrophages .
the failure to detect such differences using wild - type bmm presumably reflects the potent effect of lps on pro - inflammatory signalling pathways in this experimental system .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1005653.g001 fig 1 the spi - 2 t3ss reduces pro - inflammatory cytokine mrna levels and protein secretion in tlr4 - / - bmm .
wild - type and tlr4 - / - bmms were non - infected ( ni ) , exposed to lps ( 100 ng / ml ) or infected with wild - type or deltassav strains for 10 h and mrna levels of tnf - alpha ( a ) and il - 1beta ( b ) were analysed .
the transcript levels were normalized to the levels of rsp9 , which were constant under all conditions used , and then expressed relative to those of ni wild - type bmms .
results are expressed as mean +/ - sem of at least 3 independent experiments .
levels of secreted tnf - alpha ( c ) and il - 1beta ( d ) were quantified by elisa in supernatants of non - infected ( ni ) tlr4 - / - bmms , tlr4 - / - bmms stimulated with lps or tlr4 - / - bmms infected with indicated strains of s. typhimurium at 10 h or 24 h post - uptake respectively .
results presented are the means +/ - sem of triplicates of one experiment .
these results are representative of three independent experiments and significant differences were observed in each experiment .
p - values were obtained using two - tailed unpaired student 's t - test (* p < 0.05 ) .
levels of secreted tnf - alpha at 10 h post - uptake ( e ) and il - 1beta at 24 h post - uptake ( f ) were quantified by elisa in supernatants of tlr4 - / - bmms infected with indicated strains of s. typhimurium .
the cytokine levels were expressed relative to those of bmms infected with wild - type bacteria .
results are expressed as mean +/ - sem of at least 3 independent experiments .
statistical significances were calculated using anova followed by bonferonni 's multiple comparison test against wild - type strain .
spvd is a spi - 2 t3ss effector suppressing cytokine secretion to identify spi - 2 t3ss effector ( s ) involved in down - regulation of pro - inflammatory immune responses , several spi - 2 t3ss mutant strains ( representing single mutants lacking individual effectors ) [ 25 ] were screened for levels of secreted tnf - alpha from tlr4 - / - bmm at 10 h post - uptake ( s1 table ). of these , 2 strains ( deltaspvc and deltaspvd ) induced significantly more cytokine secretion from infected bmm compared to bmm infected by the wild - type strain ( fig 1e and 1f ) .
spvc and spvd are encoded by the spvrd operon ( composed of spva , b , c and d , and regulated by spvr [ 26 ] on the salmonella virulence plasmid ( pslt )) and spvc is a phosphothreonine lyase that interferes with mapk signalling [ 14 ] .
bmm infected with deletion mutants carrying the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 containing the corresponding wild - type allele of the gene ( deltaspvc , pspvc or deltaspvd , pspvd ) produced significantly less tnf - alpha and il1 - beta than bmm infected with the single mutant strains ( fig 1e and 1f ) .
to analyse if the effects of spvd are confined to macrophages , hela cells were infected with salmonella strains for 8 , 12 or 24 h and levels of il - 8 in supernatants were quantified by elisa .
infection with wild - type bacteria induced il - 8 production but no increased production was detected in cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant or the deltaspvc mutant ( as shown in [ 14 ]) ( s2 fig ) .
however , cells infected with the deltaspvd , pspvd or deltaspvc , pspvc strains showed significantly less il - 8 production compared with the wild - type strain at all time - points tested ( p <= 0.05 for all time points ) .
therefore , the effects of spvd occur both in macrophages and another cell type that does not normally respond to lps .
spi - 2 t3ss - dependent secretion of spvd into minimal medium and its translocation into host cells ( using a cyaa fusion protein ) were shown previously [ 29 ] ; however its function is unknown and its contribution to virulence of s. typhimurium in mice is not clear [ 27 - 30 ] .
to confirm spi - 2 t3ss - dependent secretion and translocation of spvd , strains producing double - ha tagged spvd from pslt were used for an in vitro secretion assay and for macrophage infection .
secretion of spvd - 2ha from bacteria grown in minimal medium was investigated following shift of ambient ph from 5.0 to 7.2 , which stimulates effector secretion from the spi - 2 t3ss [ 31 ] .
a similar amount of spvd - 2ha was present in lysates from wild - type and deltassav mutant bacteria ( s3a fig ) .
spvd - 2ha was also detected in the secreted fraction from wild - type bacteria but not from the deltassav mutant .
to investigate spvd translocation into host cells , raw macrophages were infected for 22 h with salmonella strains producing spvd - 2ha .
cells were then fixed and labelled to detect salmonella and the ha tag .
translocated spvd - 2ha was not detected within infected macrophages by immunofluorescence microscopy under these conditions .
however when cells were incubated for 2 h prior to fixation with the proteasome inhibitor mg132 , weak but distinct and reproducible cytoplasmic labelling of spvd - 2ha was detected in the cytoplasm of the majority of cells infected with wild - type but not deltassav mutant salmonella ( s3b fig ) .
these results suggest that relatively small amounts of spvd are translocated into the host cell cytoplasm .
since spvc inhibits map kinase signalling [ 14 ] we tested if spvd affects this pathway in cells expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of mapk - dependent ap - 1 binding sequences .
hek 293 cells were co - transfected with vectors expressing myc - spvd or myc - spvc ( as positive control ) or myc vector alone ( empty prk5 vector ) , along with vector expressing the luciferase reporter under the control of ap - 1 promoter and vector constitutively expressing the renilla luciferase , as an internal control for normalisation of data .
cells were exposed to pma for 6 h to stimulate map kinase pathways .
then cells were lysed and bioluminescence was measured to determine the fold - difference of map kinase activation in relation to non - transfected cells .
immunoblots of cell lysates following sds - page , using anti - myc and anti - tubulin antibodies , confirmed that similar numbers of cells expressing similar levels of effectors were analysed .
ectopic expression of spvc resulted in a strong inhibition of luciferase activity , while transfection of empty vector or of vector producing spvd did not inhibit luciferase activity ( fig 2a ) , suggesting that unlike spvc , spvd does not inhibit the map kinase signalling pathway .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1005653.g002 fig 2 spvd prevents nuclear accumulation of p65 but not degradation of ikbalpha .
( a ) spvd does not inhibit activation of an ap - 1 - regulated promoter .
hek - 293 cells were cotransfected with an ap - 1 - dependent luciferase reporter plasmid , ptk - renilla luciferase and prk5myc , prk5myc - spvc or prk5myc - spvd .

hek - 293 cells were co - transfected with an nf - kb - dependent luciferase reporter plasmid , ptk - renilla luciferase and prk5myc , prk5myc - spvc , prk5myc - spvd or prk5myc - spvdk185a at the indicated amounts ( in ng ) .
the nf - kb pathway was activated with tnf - alpha and luciferase activity was measured after 8 h. results are expressed as fold activation in relation to unstimulated and non - transfected ( nt ) cells .
values are expressed as mean +/ - sem of at least 3 independent experiments and statistical significances were calculated using anova followed by bonferonni 's multiple comparison test against nt cells (* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ; *** p < 0.005 ) .
( e ) degradation of ikbalpha is not affected by spvd .
hek - 293 cells transfected by prk5myc - spvd or prk5myc - yopp were prepared at the indicated times after tnf - alpha stimulation and analysed by sds - page and immunoblotting with anti - ikbalpha and anti - tubulin antibodies .
ratio of ikbalpha normalised to unstimulated cells is indicated below immunoblots .
spvd prevents nuclear accumulation of p65 some t3ss effectors inhibit pro - inflammatory cytokine production and secretion by interfering with proteins of the nf - kb pathway [ 6 ] .
to determine the potential effect of spvd on nuclear translocation of the nf - kb transcription factor p65 , confocal microscopy was used to quantify the amounts of nuclear p65 in tlr4 - / - bmm infected with different salmonella strains at 10 h post - bacterial uptake .
cells were immunolabelled with anti - salmonella and anti - p65 antibodies and nuclei were stained with the dna dye , draq5 ( fig 2b ) .
three - dimensional image projections were acquired randomly and nuclear p65 intensity was quantified using volocity software .
the intensity of p65 in the nuclei of infected tlr4 - / - bmm was significantly increased when spvd was absent ( deltaspvd , deltaspvrd ( corresponding to deltaspvr - spva - spvb - spvc - spvd mutant strain ) or deltaspvrd,pspvc strains ) and was restored to wild - type levels by mutants carrying pspvd ( deltaspvd,pspvd or deltaspvrd,pspvd strains ) ( fig 2c ) , indicating that of spv - encoded proteins , only spvd prevents nuclear accumulation of p65 .
nlec , a t3ss effector of enteropathogenic e. coli is a protease that cleaves p65 directly [ 32 - 35 ] .
therefore , we analysed total cell levels of p65 in tlr4 - / - bmm infected with different salmonella strains at 10 h post - uptake .
no significant differences were detected ( s4a fig ) .
to determine if the influence of spvd on p65 localisation was cell - type specific , its effects on p65 and its localisation were analysed during infection of hela epithelial cells .
the amount of p65 in total cell lysates and in nuclei of hela cells infected with salmonella strains was quantified by immunoblot after cell fractionation .
no differences were detected in total cell extracts , but the amount of p65 in the nuclei of cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant was consistently increased compared to wild - type infected cells ( s4b fig ) .
the amount of nuclear p65 was restored to wild - type levels in cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant carrying a plasmid containing spvd ( s4b fig ) .
in addition , total levels of p65 in hela cells transfected with prk5myc - spvd , prk5myc - spvc ( used as a negative control ) or prk5myc - nlec ( used as a positive control ) were analysed by facs after labelling of the cells with anti - p65 and anti - myc antibodies .
levels of p65 were determined in myc - positive cells and normalised to non - transfected cells .
degradation of p65 occurred only in cells expressing nlec ( s4c and s4d fig ) .
these results indicate that spvd reduces nuclear translocation of p65 in both mouse macrophages and human epithelial cells , but does not affect the overall cellular pool of p65 .
the amounts of two other immune related transcription factors ( p50 and stat2 ) in total cell lysates and in nuclei of hela cells infected with salmonella strains were quantified by immunoblot after cell fractionation .
no differences were detected in total cell extracts , but the amount of p50 in the nuclei of cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant was consistently increased compared to wild - type - infected cells ( s4b fig ) .
the amount of nuclear p50 was restored to wild - type levels in cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant carrying a plasmid containing spvd .
no differences in stat2 levels in nuclei or total cell lysates were detected .
these results indicate that spvd specifically targets the import of nf - kb - associated proteins .
the predicted product of spvd is a hydrophilic protein of 216 amino acids [ 36 ] and visual alignment of a region of spvd with several prokaryotic phosphothreonine lyases [ 37 ] revealed a region in spvd ( between amino acids 181 to 213 ) that is conserved among these enzymes ( s4e fig ) .
this area contains an invariant lys residue ( k185 ) and mutation of this residue in spvc results in a loss of phosphothreonine lyase activity [ 38 ] .
as a further test of the effect of spvd on the nf - kb signalling pathway , and to investigate the importance of k185 , hek 293 cells were co - transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding luciferase under the control of nf - kb promoter and a plasmid encoding either myc alone ( empty prk5 vector ) , myc - spvc ( as a negative control ) , myc - spvd or myc - spvdk185a ( spvd carrying a lysine - to - alanine substitution at residue 185 ) .
luciferase activity was assayed 8 h after tnf - alpha stimulation and normalised to non - transfected and unstimulated cells .
non - transfected cells underwent an approximately 20 - fold increase in activation following stimulation with tnf - alpha when compared to resting cells .
transfection of 500 ng of empty vector or vector expressing spvc did not prevent nf - kb activation , whereas expression of spvd or spvdk185a reduced activation by approximately 65 % ( fig 2d ) .
inhibition of nf - kb activation by spvd was observed after transfection of 50 ng of dna and increased with increasing amounts of dna .
together , these results indicate that spvd is sufficient to block the activation of an nf - kb - regulated promoter and that k185 is not required for spvd activity .
to investigate if spvd interferes with ikbalpha degradation induced upon stimulation with tnf - alpha , hek 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either myc alone ( empty vector ) , myc - spvd or myc - yopp ( a t3ss effector of yersinia enterolitica that inhibits ikbalpha degradation [ 39 - 41 ] , used here as a positive control ) , then stimulated with tnf - alpha for 5 , 10 or 20 min to induce ikbalpha degradation .
proteins in cell extracts were then analyzed by sds - page and immunoblotting .
as expected , degradation of ikbalpha was inhibited in cells expressing myc - yopp ( fig 2e ) .
however , ikbalpha was degraded in cells transfected with the empty vector or with the plasmid encoding myc - spvd ( fig 2e ) .
because only approximately 60 % of the cell population was efficiently transfected ( as measured by microscopic examination ) , a potential effect of spvd on ikbalpha degradation might be difficult to detect when analysing the whole cell population by immunoblotting .
therefore , ikbalpha degradation following tnf - alpha stimulation was also analysed by flow cytometry after labelling of the cells with anti - ikbalpha and anti - myc antibodies .
levels of ikbalpha were quantified in myc - positive cells and normalised to non - stimulated cells .
tnf - alpha - induced ikbalpha degradation was only prevented in cells expressing yopp ( s4f fig ) , indicating that spvd does not inhibit ikbalpha degradation and that it must prevent nuclear accumulation of p65 by interfering with the nf - kb pathway after ikbalpha degradation .
effect of spvd on importin - alpha translocation of p65 into the nucleus requires proteins of the karyopherin ( kpna ) family [ 42,43 ] , also called importin - alpha .
to determine the potential effect of spvd on kpna1 and kpna3 , two importin - alpha proteins known to interact with p65 [ 43 - 45 ] , confocal microscopy was used to analyse their localisation in hela cells .
since attempts to detect endogenous kpna1 or kpna3 using commercial antibodies failed , hela cells were co - transfected with plasmids encoding either kpna1 - flag or kpna3 - flag and plasmids encoding myc - spvd or myc - spvc ( as a control ) .
cells were immunolabelled with anti - flag , anti - myc and anti - lamin antibodies .
consistent with the localisation of spvd following its translocation from bacteria ( s3b fig ) , spvd was found in the host cell cytoplasm after transfection ( fig 3a ) .
in addition to nuclei containing diffuse labelling of kpna1 - flag or kpna3 - flag , in some nuclei , the labelling was predominantly in the region of the nuclear envelope , where it colocalised partially with lamin ( fig 3a ) .
this lamina - associated labelling was observed in all transfected cell populations , but its frequency was enhanced 2.7 - fold by kpna1 ( p < 0.001 ) and 1.6 - fold by kpna3 ( p < 0.05 ) when spvd was co - expressed ( fig 3b ) .
in addition , the enhanced frequency of lamina - associated labelling was not observed when spvc was co - expressed ( fig 3b ) , indicating that it is specific to spvd .
to determine if the reorganisation of kpna1 induced by myc - spvd was localised inside or outside the nucleus , differential membrane permeabilisation was done using either triton x - 100 ( under conditions in which it permeabilises both the plasma and nuclear membranes ) or saponin ( at a concentration where it permeabilises only the plasma membrane ) .
spvd - induced accumulation of kpna1 at the nuclear envelope was only observed when cells were permeabilised with triton x - 100 , indicating that this importin accumulates within the nucleus ( fig 3c ) .

cells were immunolabelled with anti - salmonella and anti - flag antibodies and nuclei stained with draq5 .
deletion of spvd led to a significant decrease of the percentage of cells with nuclear lamina - associated kpna1 ( fig 3d and 3e ) or kpna3 ( s5 fig ) .
cells infected with the deletion mutant carrying a plasmid - borne wild - type allele of spvd induced a greater proportion of these structures than the deletion mutant ( fig 3e ; p < 0.01 ) .
these structures might be an artefact of overexpression of kpna1 and kpna3 but do suggest an spvd - dependent accumulation of kpna1 and kpna3 in the nucleus .
to analyse the effect of spvd on the localisation of endogenous kpna1 , the amount of endogenous kpna1 in nuclei of hela cells infected with salmonella strains was quantified by immunoblotting after cell fractionation .
a significant decrease in the amount of endogenous kpna1 in the nuclei of cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant was detected , compared to wild - type salmonella - infected cells ( fig 3f and 3g ) .
the amount of nuclear kpna1 was restored to that of the wild - type level in cells infected with the deltaspvd mutant carrying a plasmid containing spvd ( fig 3f and 3g ) .
therefore , in addition to inhibiting nuclear accumulation of p65 , spvd also causes nuclear accumulation of kpna1 .
spvd interacts with xpo2 recycling of kpnas from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by xpo2 ( also named cas or cse1 ) [ 46 ] .
to confirm that depletion of xpo2 inhibits recycling of kpnas , confocal microscopy was used to analyse the localisation of kpna1 - flag in hela cells depleted of xpo2 ( by sirna of xpo2 , s6a fig ) and then transfected with a plasmid encoding kpna1 - flag .
cells were immunolabelled with anti - xpo2 and anti - flag antibodies and the percentage of cells having detectable cytoplasmic kpna1 were scored .
sirna of xpo2 in hela cells caused accumulation of kpna1 in the nucleus ( s6b fig ) and a decrease in the percentage of cells having detectable kpna1 in the cytoplasm ( s6c fig ) , compared to non - treated cells or cells exposed to a scrambled sirna .
however , the nuclear kpna1 that was observed in the absence of xpo2 was not localised at the lamina , as was observed in the presence of spvd .
knock - down of xpo2 in hela cells was reported to cause a decrease of p65 translocation after stimulation with tnf - alpha [ 47 ] .
to determine the effect of inhibition of xpo2 expression on p65 localisation in our experiments , confocal microscopy was used to analyse localisation of p65 in hela cells depleted of xpo - 2 and stimulated with tnf - alpha for 45 min .
cells were immunolabelled with anti - xpo - 2 and anti - p65 antibodies and the intensity of p65 within the nucleus was quantified using volocity software .
sirna of xpo2 in hela cells led to a decrease in levels of nuclear p65 after stimulation with tnf - alpha compared to control cells ( non - treated or scrambled sirna ) ( s6d and s6e fig ) .
since cytoplasmic spvd and inhibition of xpo2 expression both led to nuclear accumulation of kpna1 and reduced levels of nuclear p65 , we hypothesized that spvd might interact with xpo2 .
to investigate this , hek cells were co - transfected with a plasmid encoding xpo2 - flag and a plasmid encoding either myc - spvd or myc - spvc .
cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated with anti - myc antibody - conjugated beads .
immunoblot analysis revealed that spvc failed to interact with xpo2 but that spvd and xpo2 formed a complex ( fig 4a ) .
to determine if spvd interacts with endogenous xpo2 in infected cells , raw macrophages and hela cells were infected with salmonella expressing either spvd - ha or two other effectors translocated by the spi - 2 t3ss ( spvc - ha or ssel - ha ) , followed by immunoprecipitation using anti - ha conjugated beads .
input and output samples were analysed by sds - page and immunoblotting with anti - xpo2 and anti - ha antibodies .
spvd bound to endogenous xpo2 following its translocation from intracellular bacteria ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
no binding was observed when cells were infected with salmonella expressing spvc - 2ha or ssel - 2ha despite the fact that these two effectors were evidently more abundant than spvd - 2ha ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
xpo1 and xpo5 are additional members of the exportin family , have some structural similarities to xpo2 and mediate the export of proteins with a nuclear export signal and of rna respectively [ 48 ] .
however , when membranes were probed with anti - xpo1 and anti - xpo5 antibodies , no interaction between spvd - 2ha and these proteins was detected ( fig 4c ) .
to analyse if the interaction of xpo2 with spvd affects the cellular localisation of xpo2 , the amount of xpo2 in total cell lysates and in cytoplasm of hela cells infected with salmonella strains was quantified by immunoblotting after cell fractionation .
no cytoplasmic increase of xpo2 in wild - type - infected cells was detected ( s7a fig ) .
in addition , hela cells were transfected with plasmids encoding myc - spvd or myc - spvc ( as control ) and the amount of xpo2 in total cells lysates and in cytoplasm was quantified by immunoblotting after cell fractionation ( s7b fig ) .
no cytoplasmic increase of xpo2 in cells transfected with plasmid encoding myc - spvd was detected , suggesting that spvd does not sequester xpo2 in the cytoplasm .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1005653.g004 fig 4 spvd interacts with xpo2 ( a ) hek cells transfected with vectors expressing xpo2 - flag and myc - spvd or myc - spvc were lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - myc antibody - conjugated beads , or beads as a control .
xpo2 - flag , myc - spvd and myc - spvc were detected in input samples ( input ) and after immunoprecipitation ( ip ) by means of sds - page and immunoblotting .
( b ) raw macrophages or ( c ) hela cells were infected for 20 h with wild - type salmonella expressing either spvd - 2ha , spvc - 2ha or ssel - 2ha .
proteasome inhibitor mg132 was added to the culture medium for the last 2 h of infection .
cells were then lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated with ha antibody .
sds - page blots were probed for ha and endogenous xpo2 , xpo1 or xpo5 .
( d ) hela cells depleted of xpo2 ( xpo2 sirna ) or treated with scramble sirna ( scr .
sirna ) and then transfected with flag - kpna1 and myc - spvd were fixed and labelled with anti - myc and anti - flag antibodies .
intra - nuclear rings of kpna1 were quantified blindly by microscopy .
values are expressed as mean +/ - sem of 3 independent experiments and p - values were obtained using two - tailed unpaired student 's t - test (* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ) .
these results show that spvd localises to the host cell cytoplasm , inhibits nuclear accumulation of p65 , causes nuclear accumulation of kpna1 and kpna3 , and binds specifically to xpo2 .
to determine if nuclear lamina - associated kpna1 induced by spvd is dependent on xpo2 , confocal microscopy was used to analyse the localisation of kpna1 - flag in hela cells depleted of xpo2 and then transfected with a plasmid encoding kpna1 - flag with or without a second plasmid encoding myc - spvd .
cells were immunolabelled with anti - flag and anti - myc antibodies and the number of cells with nuclear lamina - associated kpna1 - flag were counted ( fig 4d ) .
when spvd was present , the frequency of lamina - associated kpna1 was significantly enhanced by 2.1 - fold in non - treated hela cells and by 2.0 - fold in cells exposed to a scrambled sirna .
however , no statistical difference was observed in hela cells depleted of xpo2 .
together , these results indicate that the ability of spvd to induce lamina - associated kpna1 is dependent on the presence of xpo2 .
effect of spvd on virulence and cytokine expression in mice previous work failed to reveal a clear and consistent role of spvd in virulence in vivo [ 27 - 30 ] .
to reassess the possibility of an effect of spvd on systemic growth of bacteria , mice were inoculated by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of equivalent cfu of kanamycin resistant wild - type bacteria and the deltaspvd mutant strain .
after 72 h of infection , bacteria were quantified after plating spleen homogenates on lb medium and lb medium containing kanamycin to distinguish the strains .
the competitive index ( ci ) for the deltaspvd mutant was 0.48 +/ - 0.11 ( p <= 0.05 ) when compared to wild - type ( fig 5a ) .
to verify that this attenuation was due to loss of spvd , a second experiment was conducted in which mice were infected as above but with a mixture of deltaspvd mutant and the same strain carrying spvd allele on the pacyc plasmid .
the ci for this combination was 0.47 +/ - 0.11 ( p <= 0.005 ) ( fig 5a ) , showing that the spvd allele rescues the growth defect of the mutant , thereby confirming that spvd contributes to systemic virulence in the mice .

( e ) model depicting pathways targeted by spvc and spvd to overcome pamp - induced defences in host cells .
immunoblots are representative of three independent experiments .
to assess the effect of spvd on lps - induced genes in mice , rna levels of serpinb2 , tnf - alpha and il1 - beta in infected splenic macrophages of c57bl / 6 mice inoculated with salmonella strains were compared by qrt - pcr ( fig 5b - 5d ) .
for serpinb2 mrna transcripts , no significant differences were detected between mice infected with different salmonella strains ( fig 5b ) .
no significant differences in tnf - alpha and il1 - beta were detected between mice infected with the wild - type or deltaspvd mutant bacteria , but macrophages infected with deltaspvd , pspvd bacteria contained fewer tnf - alpha and il1 - beta transcripts ( fig 5c and 5d ) , indicating that spvd can depress cytokine expression in vivo .
discussion as a basis for identifying spi - 2 t3ss effectors that interfere with host proinflammatory immune signalling , we analysed the effect of the spi - 2 t3ss on mrna levels of tnf - alpha and il1 - beta in wild - type bmm at 10 h post - bacterial uptake .
no obvious differences were detected , suggesting that either spi - 2 effectors do not have a significant effect on macrophage mrna levels or that their activities are masked by the massive changes induced by lps [ 23 ] and possibly other pamps .
use of tlr4 - / - bmms provided evidence that the spi - 2 t3ss does suppress pro - inflammatory cytokine production .
among several spi - 2 t3ss effector mutants that were tested subsequently , infection with either deltaspvc or deltaspvd strains led to increased tnf - alpha and il1 - beta secretion .
spvd and spvc - dependent effects also occurred in hela cells , showing that their functions are not confined to macrophages .
the effect of the deltaspvc mutant was unsurprising , since two previous studies have indicated an anti - inflammatory effect of spvc , caused by its phosphothreonine lyase activity on erk1 / 2 , p38 and jnk [ 14,49 ] .
spvd was identified in a proteomic study as being secreted by both the spi - 1 and spi - 2 t3sss and its translocation into j774 macrophage - like cells was confirmed using a cyaa fusion protein assay [ 29 ] .
using an epitope - tagged version under the control of its own promoter in the virulence plasmid , we showed that spvd is secreted into the culture medium in a spi - 2 t3ss - dependent manner .
spi - 2 t3ss - dependent translocation of spvd into the cytoplasm of infected cells was also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy , but only when cells had been treated with a proteasome inhibitor .
in addition , bacterially translocated spvd - 2ha was barely detectable in the input sample from infected hela cells and raw macrophages , whereas spvc - 2ha and ssel - 2ha were clearly more abundant ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
this indicates that spvd is translocated in relatively small amounts and / or is more prone to degradation compared to other effectors .
despite some amino acid similarity in a region containing the catalytic lysine of spvc , spvd did not require the corresponding lysine to suppress tnf - dependent activation of an nf - kb reporter .
furthermore , following transfection , spvc but not spvd inhibited activation of an ap - 1 - dependent promoter , showing that these effectors are likely to have distinct biochemical activities and physiological effects .
several other bacterial effectors have been shown to interfere with nf - kb signalling .
in most cases they affect the degradation of ikbalpha and / or the release of p65 [ 4 - 6 ] .
for example , the shigella flexneri kinase ospg interacts with host ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes to abrogate ikbalpha degradation and thus blocks nuclear translocation of p65 [ 50 ] .
nlec of enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrahgic e. coli is a metalloprotease that degrades both free cytosolic p65 and p65 when complexed with ikbalpha [ 33 - 35 ] .
abrogation of p65 translocation has also been described for the effectors nleb and nlee from enteropathogenic e. coli and ospz from shigella flexneri [ 51,52 ] nlee is an unusual methyltransferase that modifies crucial cysteines in the zinc finger domains in ubiquitin - chain sensory proteins tab2 and tab3 and thereby disrupts nf - kb signalling [ 53 ] .
nleb is a n - acetylglucosamine transferase whose action blocks signalling from the tnfr and its associated adapters [ 54 - 56 ] .
we found that spvd prevents nuclear accumulation of p65 by interfering with the nf - kb pathway after ikbalpha degradation but it did not affect overall cellular levels of p65 .
spvd might not be the only effector that inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65 following ikbalpha degradation .
indeed , the bordetella effector bopn [ 57 ] localises to the nucleus and appears blocks nuclear translocation of p65 without affecting ikbalpha degradation ; however , its host target ( s ) remain to be identified .
spvd might specifically target the import of nf - kb - associated proteins as it also prevents nuclear accumulation of nf - kb subunit p50 but not of stat2 .
there are 7 different importin - alpha ( kpna ) isoforms and several have the capacity to interact with p65 .
fagerlund et al. reported an interaction between p65 and both kpna4 ( alpha3 ) and kpna3 ( alpha4 ) but not kpna2 ( alpha1 ) [ 43,44 ] , while cunningham et al. showed that p65 binds to kpna2 [ 42 ] , liang et al. reported that nuclear translocation of p65 relies mainly on kpna2 [ 47 ] and sun et al. showed that p65 translocation in leucocytes does not involve kpna4 , but rather kpna1 ( alpha5 ) [ 45 ] .
p65 might use different isoforms depending on host cell type , time and strength of pathway activation and other conditions .
furthermore , in vitro binding assays with purified proteins or lysates might not reflect normal physiological interactions .
however , our results showing that spvd affects nuclear accumulation of both p65 and p50 are consistent with its effect on kpna4 ( alpha3 ) , which mediates nuclear import of both transcription factors [ 43 ] .
we were unable to distinguish endogenous kpnas by confocal microscopy using commercial antibodies and therefore cells were transfected with plasmids encoding flag - tagged kpnas and anti - flag antibodies were used to detect them by confocal microscopy .
following transfection or bacterial translocation , spvd stimulated a nuclear lamina - associated accumulation of overexpressed kpna1 and kpna3 .
no effect was observed on kpna2 or kpna4 localisation .
we are unaware of other bacterial proteins that cause a similar effect , but hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein n inhibits p65 nuclear translocation by binding directly to kpnas [ 58 ] .
we were unable to obtain evidence for an interaction between spvd and kpna1 , 2 , 3 or 4 by co - immunoprecipitation assays .
instead , following transfection or bacterial translocation , spvd interacted specifically with endogenous xpo2 , which is required for recycling of kpnas from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [ 46 ] .
inhibition of xpo2 expression led to nuclear accumulation of kpna1 and also reduced nuclear translocation of p65 ([ 47 ] and this work ) .
despite apparently stable binding between spvd and xpo2 , xpo2 localisation was not noticeably affected by spvd .
it is possible that spvd is an enzyme that modifies xpo2 .
however , following immunoprecipitation by spvd - 2ha after infection of macrophages , mass spectrometric analysis of xpo2 did not reveal any post - translational modifications such as phosphorylation , acetylation or conjugation by ubiquitin and ubiquitin - like proteins .
it is possible that such modifications did occur but are relatively transient , labile or did not survive the extraction or ionization processes .
alternatively spvd might affect xpo2 function non - enzymatically , or use xpo2 as a docking site or cofactor to mediate an effect on another component of the importin / exportin machinery .
a link between binding of spvd to xpo2 and the effect of spvd on kpna1 was established by showing that the spvd - induced accumulation of kpna1 at the nuclear lamina was dependent on xpo2 .
sequestration of kpna in the nuclear envelope has been observed in cells treated with histone deacetyltransferase inhibitors [ 59 ] .
however , this treatment also resulted in accumulation of xpo2 in nuclear aggregates [ 59 ] , which are clearly distinct from the effects of spvd .
due to the lack of clear and consistent data on the contribution of spvd to salmonella virulence [ 27 - 30 ] , we reassessed its effect on systemic growth of bacteria in mice .
our evidence indicates that spvd does contribute to systemic virulence in the mouse .
the disparity might be attributable to the different mouse strains used in each study .
we did not detect a significant difference in the levels of tnf - alpha and il1 - beta mrna in splenic macrophages of wild - type mice infected with the wild - type or spvd mutant strains .
however , the complemented mutant in which spvd was produced from a plasmid caused a significant reduction of tnf - alpha and il1 - beta mrna levels in splenic macrophages of wild - type mice .
it seems likely that the effects of spvd produced by wild - type bacteria are subtle and can be masked by other immune - modulating bacterial molecules present in these relatively short - term infection assays , as evidenced by the initial experiments using wild - type macrophages .
together , our evidence suggests that an interaction between spvd and xpo2 disrupts the nuclear / cytoplasm cycling of kpna1 and kpna3 , which interferes with nuclear translocation of p65 and activation of nf - kb regulated promoters ( fig 5e ) .
whatever the precise mechanism , it is remarkable that salmonella has evolved the means to inhibit the two main pro - inflammatory signalling pathways that are activated following detection of bacterial pathogens through two proteins ( spvc and spvd ) that are encoded by adjacent genes on the same operon ( fig 5e ) .

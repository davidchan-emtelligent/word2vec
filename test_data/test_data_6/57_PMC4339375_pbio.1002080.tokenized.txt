it takes two to tango : a new partner in amylose synthesis the domestication of starch crops underpinned the development of human civilisation , yet we still do not fully understand how plants make starch .
starch is composed of glucose polymers that are branched ( amylopectin ) or linear ( amylose ) .
the amount of amylose strongly influences the physico - chemical behaviour of starchy foods during cooking and of starch mixtures in non - food manufacturing processes .
the granule - bound starch synthase ( gbss ) is the glucosyltransferase specifically responsible for elongating amylose polymers and was the only protein known to be required for its biosynthesis .
here , we demonstrate that protein targeting to starch ( ptst ) is also specifically required for amylose synthesis in arabidopsis .
ptst is a plastidial protein possessing an n - terminal coiled coil domain and a c - terminal carbohydrate binding module ( cbm ) .
we discovered that arabidopsis ptst mutants synthesise amylose - free starch and are phenotypically similar to mutants lacking gbss .
analysis of granule - bound proteins showed a dramatic reduction of gbss protein in ptst mutant starch granules .
pull - down assays with recombinant proteins in vitro , as well as immunoprecipitation assays in planta , revealed that gbss physically interacts with ptst via a coiled coil .
furthermore , we show that the cbm domain of ptst , which mediates its interaction with starch granules , is also required for correct gbss localisation .
fluorescently tagged arabidopsis gbss , expressed either in tobacco or arabidopsis leaves , required the presence of arabidopsis ptst to localise to starch granules .
mutation of the cbm of ptst caused gbss to remain in the plastid stroma .
ptst fulfils a previously unknown function in targeting gbss to starch .
this sheds new light on the importance of targeting biosynthetic enzymes to sub - cellular sites where their action is required .
importantly , ptst represents a promising new gene target for the biotechnological modification of starch composition , as it is exclusively involved in amylose synthesis .
the biosynthesis of starch in plant chloroplasts depends on a novel protein that targets starch synthase to the growing starch granules ; this represents a potential target for the biotechnological modification of starch .

author summary starch plays a vital role in our everyday lives .
it is not only a major dietary carbohydrate , but is also used to manufacture household products such as pharmaceuticals , paper , and textiles .
plants produce starch as a means of storing energy ; it is composed of two glucose polymers - - amylopectin and amylose .
while amylose is present in a smaller quantity than amylopectin , it has a major impact on starch processing .
being able to control the amount of amylose is therefore a goal for biotechnology .
amylose is made by the enzyme granule bound starch synthase ( gbss ) , which was for decades believed to be the only protein required for amylose production .
we now report here that a second protein , protein targeting to starch ( ptst ) , is involved in the process .
mutants lacking the ptst protein in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana fail to make any amylose in starch .
this is because the gbss protein , which normally binds to starch , cannot bind in the absence of ptst .
this discovery sheds new light on a previously unknown protein targeting process by which enzymes are delivered to the starch .
furthermore , our discovery highlights ptst an ideal target gene for biotechnology .

introduction starch is a vitally important plant - derived material that is widely used as food and in manufacturing of non - food products .
many plants accumulate starch during photosynthesis within leaf chloroplasts , where it acts as a major storage carbohydrate .
the degradation of starch at night provides carbohydrates to fuel respiration and growth when photosynthesis is not possible [ 1 ] .
starch is also present in many seeds and storage organs ( such as tubers and storage roots ) where it serves as an energy reserve to fuel seedling establishment , plant regeneration , or survival under stress conditions .
in its native form , starch exists as semi - crystalline , insoluble granules that are typically between 1 to 100 mum in diameter , depending on botanical source [ 2 ] .
it is composed of polymers of glucose , in which alpha - 1,4 bonds connect the glucosyl residues into linear chains and alpha - 1,6 bonds form branch points .
two distinct polymers exist within the starch granule - - amylose and amylopectin .
amylose is composed of long linear chains with few branch points , while amylopectin has shorter chains and many more branch points .
the branches in amylopectin are arranged in a clustered structure that allows adjacent chains to form double helices [ 3 ] .
the packing of these helices result in the crystalline regions of starch .
amylose is believed to reside in less - crystalline ( amorphous ) zones inside the starch granule , such as the space between clusters of amylopectin helices .
there is significant variation in the amylose content of starch between species , as well as between varieties or cultivars within species .
typically , starch from arabidopsis leaves contains about 6 % amylose [ 4 ] , while starch in most cereals and storage organs contain about 20 % - 30 % [ 5 ] .
detailed information on the biochemistry of starch synthesis can be found in recent reviews [ 3,6 ] .
briefly , the synthesis of amylopectin requires the co - ordinated activities of four soluble starch synthase classes ( ss1 , ss2 , ss3 , ss4 ) that initiate glucan chains and elongate them using the glucose donor molecule , adp - glucose ( adp - glc ) .
branching enzyme activity is required to introduce alpha - 1,6 branch points , while specialised debranching enzymes are thought to subsequently remove misplaced branch points to promote crystallisation .
amylopectin clusters are radially oriented within the starch granule , and its synthesis occurs at the granule surface .
in contrast , amylose is synthesised from within the amylopectin matrix [ 7,8 ] .
this is achieved by the activity of the granule - bound starch synthase ( gbss ) , the only starch synthase isoform required for amylose synthesis .
mutants carrying defects in the gbss ( or " waxy ") gene have been isolated in many species , including arabidopsis [ 9,10 ] , maize [ 11 ] , rice [ 12 ] , cassava [ 13 ] , and potato [ 14 ] , all of which produce amylose - free starch granules .
several properties distinguish gbss from other starch synthase isoforms .
firstly , it is tightly bound to starch granules and is the most abundant protein encapsulated within starch [ 15 ] .
secondly , unbound gbss protein appears to be unstable , since it is not detectable in soluble protein fractions of leaves , even in the absence of starch granules ( e.g. , at the end of the night , when the starch has been fully degraded ) [ 16 ] .
finally , unlike soluble starch synthase isoforms such as ss2 , gbss elongates glucans processively - - adding more than one glucosyl monomer per substrate encounter [ 17 ] .
these properties in combination allow gbss within starch granules to elongate long amylose chains that are presumably not accessible to soluble branching enzymes in the stroma .
amylose content has a major influence on the physico - chemical behaviour of starch and is one of the most important parameters determining starch suitability for different applications [ 18,19 ] .
during cooking or industrial processing , amylose content influences both gel firmness and stickiness .
starches with no amylose , such as waxy corn starch , are extensively used by the food industry to achieve desirable food textures [ 20 ] .
furthermore , waxy starches are used in paper manufacturing , where clear , consistent gels are required .
conversely , high amylose starches have also received market interest as its consumption may provide health benefits .
high amylose starch is less - readily digested in the gut , and may lower the glycemic index of foods , while possibly contributing to dietary fiber intake [ 21 ] .
the commercial interest in starches with modified amylose content has driven the application of biotechnological tools to alter amylose content in planta [ 21 - 25 ] .
however , the gbss gene has so far been the only target for direct control of amylose content without affecting amylopectin .
here , we reveal a previously unknown process for targeting proteins to starch , and show that it is essential for normal rates of amylose synthesis in arabidopsis .
we investigated the function of a previously identified chloroplastic " scaffold protein " encoded by locus at5g39790 and proposed to be involved in starch metabolism [ 26 ] .
this protein has starch - binding activity and possesses a family 48 carbohydrate binding module ( cbm48 ) towards its c - terminus [ 26 ] .
other enzymes involved in starch metabolism , such as branching and debranching enzymes [ 27 ] , and the glucan phosphatase sex4 [ 28 ] , also posess family 48 cbms .
while the previous study did not identify the function of the at5g39790 protein , they speculated that it could play a scaffolding role , anchoring other proteins to starch , since in addition to its cbm48 , it has a predicted coiled coil motif ; a common structural feature associated with protein - protein interactions [ 29 ] .
using co - expression and protein abundance analysis , the study identified a number of starch metabolic enzymes as potential interaction partners for the at5g39790 protein [ 26 ] .
these included gbss , which the authors speculated may be anchored to the starch granule via the scaffold protein .
in this study , we used molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that the protein encoded by at5g39790 is involved in targeting gbss to the starch granule , and thus plays a crucial role in amylose synthesis .
we hence designate it protein targeting to starch ( ptst ) .
gbss fails to localise to the starch granule in arabidopsis mutants lacking ptst , and the mutants synthesise amylose - free starch .
we show that ptst interacts directly with both gbss and the starch granule .
however , the majority of ptst protein is present in the stroma as a soluble protein , and does not stably anchor gbss to starch .
we propose that ptst mediates a dynamic protein transport / delivery mechanism , and interacts with starch transiently rather than acting as a scaffold .
we discuss the significance of these findings in terms of the new insight into intracellular protein targeting , and in terms of the potential biotechnological modification of starch .
results ptst is a highly conserved plant protein the ptst protein was previously identified as a potential candidate for involvement in starch metabolism [ 26 ] .
first , we performed a phylogenetic analysis on ptst protein sequences to assess its conservation among plant species ( fig. 1 ) .
ptst was found as a single copy gene in arabidopsis encoded by locus at5g39790 .
ptst sequences were highly conserved , and orthologs were found in both embryophytes ( land plants ) and the chlorophyte branch of the green algae .
this suggests that the protein originated with the green lineage .
furthermore , there was a high degree of conservation among angiosperm sequences , suggesting that ptst may play an important role in this group .

angiosperm sequences are shown in red , mosses in blue , while chlorophyte sequences are shown in green .
bootstrap values that are > 50 are shown over the branches .
the alignment used to generate this tree is available as s1 data .
knockout mutations of ptst in arabidopsis result in the production of amylose - free starch to investigate the role of ptst in starch metabolism , we obtained arabidopsis mutant lines carrying t - dna insertions in the ptst gene .
we isolated two independent homozygous knockout lines , designated ptst - 1 and ptst - 2 , carrying t - dna insertions in exons 3 and 9 , respectively ( fig. 2a ) .
the exact insertion sites are presented in s1 table .
the ptst - 1 mutant is in the columbia (" col ") ecotype background while ptst - 2 is in the wassilewskija (" ws ") background .
we analysed soluble protein extracts from leaves by immunoblotting , using antibodies raised against the recombinant arabidopsis ptst protein .
bands corresponding to ptst at the expected molecular weight of 26 kda were detected in wild - type col and ws extracts , but not in the ptst mutants ( fig. 2b ) , confirming that both alleles are knockouts .

the corresponding wild types to ptst - 1 and ptst - 2 are columbia ( col ) and wassilewskija ( ws ) , respectively .
( c ) representative images of 4 - week - old rosettes .
plants harvested at the end of the photoperiod were cleared of chlorophyll and iodine - stained to visualise starch .
amylose - free mutants ( gbss , ptst - 1 , and ptst - 2 ) produce a brown staining that is distinct from the wild types .
to investigate whether the ptst mutations have an impact on starch biosynthesis , plants were grown under a 12 - h / 12 - h day / night cycle .
entire rosettes were harvested at the end of the day and stained for starch using an iodine / potassium iodide solution .
both col and ws wild - type plants stained a distinctive blue - brown colour , indicating the presence of amylose - containing starch .
however , plants from both ptst knockout lines stained only brown , suggesting the absence of amylose .
indeed the staining was very similar to the amylose - free gbss mutant ( fig. 2c ) .
the total starch content in leaves at this time was unaltered in the ptst and gbss mutants compared to the respective wild types ( table 1 ) .
furthermore , starch content analysis over a 24 h period showed that the total amount of starch was not altered in either the ptst - 1 or the gbss mutant at any time point ( s1 fig. ) .
these data show that the altered staining of ptst does not simply reflect a change in the amount of starch .
we further quantified the amylose content of purified starch granules using an iodine colourimetry - based method [ 30 ] .
the percentage of amylose in starch was approximately 8 % and 11 % for wild - type col and ws starch , respectively ( table 1 ) .
however , both ptst mutant alleles had an amylose content that was below the detection limit of our assay .
additionally , gel permeation chromatography of dispersed starch granules over a sepharose cl - 2b column confirmed that the amylose fraction was missing from ptst starch granules ( s2a fig. ) .
these results demonstrate that the loss of ptst results in the production of amylose - free starch .

amylose was measured in isolated starch granules using iodine colourimetric spectra , and represent mean +/ - sem from three determinations .
loss of ptst results in a dramatic reduction of starch - bound gbss protein gbss is the key enzyme responsible for amylose synthesis .
we investigated whether the abundance of gbss in starch granules was altered in the ptst mutant .
granule - bound proteins were extracted by gelatinising purified starch granules in an sds - containing medium , and subsequently visualised on silver - stained sds - page gels .
gbss was the major granule - bound protein , appearing as the dominant band at its expected molecular weight of 59 kda ( fig. 3a ) .
as expected , this band was absent from the starch of the gbss mutant .
surprisingly , the band was also undetectable in the ptst mutant .
we conducted more sensitive analyses by immunoblotting these granule - bound protein extracts with an antiserum raised against the pea gbss .
a band corresponding to gbss was detected on ptst starch granules , but only under high protein loading and extended exposure times for the blot ( fig. 3b and 3c ) .
this suggests that gbss is dramatically reduced in abundance .
we repeated the immunoblotting experiment with a dilution series of the wild - type granule - bound proteins , comparing it with those from ptst , which established that the degree of reduction of gbss on ptst starch granules is about 100 - fold ( s3 fig. ) 10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.g003 fig 3 the abundance of granule - bound gbss protein is greatly reduced in ptst .

loading was according to equivalent mass of starch ( 0.7 mg ) .
( c ) same as ( b ) , but more extract was loaded ( equivalent to1.3 mg starch ) and exposure time was greatly extended .
( d ) immunoblot detection of ptst in granule - bound protein extracts .
( e ) soluble ( s ) and insoluble ( i ) protein fractions of leaves were subject to immunoblot analysis with gbss and ptst antibodies .
starch - bound proteins are contained in the insoluble fraction .
immunoblotting with a ptst - specific antiserum revealed that some ptst protein was bound to starch granules from wild type , even though there was no obvious band at that location on the silver - stained gel .
as expected , this band was absent from the immunoblot of ptst starch - bound proteins , but also from those of the gbss mutants ( fig. 3d ) .
hence , the loss of either protein results in the loss of the other protein from starch .
this suggests a functional interaction between gbss and ptst on the granule .
to further investigate the granule - bound localisation of both gbss and ptst , we sequentially extracted soluble and insoluble proteins from leaves .
granule - bound proteins are present in the insoluble fraction ( since starch is insoluble ) , while free stromal proteins are present in the soluble fraction .
the vast majority of ptst protein was in the soluble protein fraction and not granule - bound ( fig. 3e ) .
additionally , while the abundance of starch - bound ptst was reduced in gbss mutants ( fig. 3d ) , its abundance in the soluble fraction was unaltered ( fig. 3e ) .
in contrast , gbss was exclusively bound to starch granules in the wild type .
despite the near absence of gbss from the starch granules of ptst mutants , we could not detect it in the soluble fraction , supporting existing speculation that unbound gbss is degraded [ 16 ] .
additionally , we performed qpcr analyses to quantify gbss transcript levels in ptst plants .
no differences were observed in the quantity of gbss transcripts between ptst and wild - type plants 2 h into the light period ( s2 data ) .
this is the time point at which circadian clock - regulated gbss expression is at its maximum level [ 16 ] .
this strongly suggests that the reduction in gbss in ptst occurs at the post - transcriptional level .
ptst affects the efficiency of gbss targeting to the starch granule to further characterise the amylose - free phenotype of ptst , we crossed ptst - 1 with two different arabidopsis mutants that have higher amylose content - - sex4 and dpe1 [ 4,31 ] .
sex4 is a glucan phosphatase required for efficient starch degradation .
the sex4 mutants do not degrade as much starch at night as they make during the day , resulting in the accumulation of starch over multiple diurnal cycles [ 32 ] .
amylose can therefore be synthesised over multiple photoperiods in sex4 starch granules and reach levels exceeding 30 % of total granule mass ( table 2 ) , as opposed to wild - type granules where amylose is only synthesised over a single photoperiod and is less than 10 % ( tables 1 and 2 ) [ 4 ] .
dpe1 is a glucanotransferase involved in plastidial malto - oligosaccaharide metabolism during starch degradation .
while dpe1 mutants also have a mild impairment in the rate of starch degradation , the primary reason for its high amylose content ( over 20 % of granule mass ; see table 2 ) is the accumulation of short malto - oligosaccharides , which can act as primers for gbss activity [ 31,33 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.t002 table 2 amylose content of ptst double mutants .

no amylose was detected in the dpe1 ptst double mutant , even though dpe1 single mutants had more than twice the amylose content of the wild type ( table 2 ) .
however , the ptst sex4 double mutant had intermediate levels : the amylose content was only one - third of that found in the sex4 single mutant but was comparable to the wild type ( table 2 ) .
these results were confirmed using sepharose cl - 2b chromatography ( s2b fig. ) .
silver - stained sds - page gels of granule - bound proteins revealed that the dpe1 and sex4 mutants had gbss levels similar to the wild type ( fig. 4a ) .
however , no gbss could be detected on dpe1 ptst granules , as for the ptst single mutant .
in ptst sex4 granules , gbss was detectable but still greatly reduced compared with the wild type .
these data are consistent with the idea that loss of ptst causes a dramatic reduction in gbss targeting to starch , and thereby affects the rate of amylose synthesis .
the fact that ptst sex4 had wild - type amylose levels despite having much less gbss is consistent with the idea that amylose synthesis can proceed over many days , since the loss of sex4 means that the starch is never fully degraded .
further evidence for this was seen when ptst sex4 rosettes were stained with iodine ( fig. 4b ) .
older leaves , where starch has been accumulating for the longest period of time , stained blue due to the presence of amylose , while younger leaves stained brown , suggesting they are amylose - free .

note that the younger leaves stain like the amylose - free gbss sex4 mutant , while older leaves stain darker .
gbss and ptst interact via coiled coils the ptst protein has two recognisable domains - - the coiled coil - containing domain and the cbm48 domain [ 26 ] .
gbss is also predicted to possess a coiled coil [ 26 ] .
based on the amylose - free phenotype of ptst mutants , we hypothesised that gbss may interact directly with ptst via the coiled coils .
the coils / pcoils server [ 34 ] predicted one coiled coil region on the arabidopsis gbss protein - - a 14 - amino - acid stretch in the c - terminal domain - - with a very high probability score ( fig. 5a ) .
this prediction for a coiled coil was conserved in all vascular plant gbss protein sequences examined ( s4a fig. ) .
meanwhile , the n - terminal part of ptst was predicted to form three sequential coiled coils .

the location of predicted coiled coils are shown with an indication of the probability score ( ranging from 0 to 1 , where 1 is the highest probability ) .
( b ) homology model of the arabidopsis gbss based on the rice gbss1 crystal structure .
the location of the predicted coiled coil from ( a ) is depicted on the structure in orange .
( c ) presence of surface - exposed charged side chains on the coiled coil containing helix .
using the solved protein structure of rice gbss as a template [ 35 ] , we modelled the structure of arabidopsis gbss using the swiss - model automated homology modelling server [ 36 ] .
we located the predicted coiled coil on the model , and found that it occupied a 13 - amino - acid helix exposed on the surface of the c - terminal domain ( fig. 5b ) .
coiled coil - mediated protein - protein binding typically involve electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids on the coiled coil [ 29 ] .
while there were numerous charged amino acids present on this helix , some had buried or partially buried side chains ( glu444 , glu451 , lys453 ) and were unlikely to be available for protein - protein interaction .
the side chains of lys440 and lys442 were surface exposed , but were most likely occupied in ionic interactions with glu412 on the adjacent helix .
however , three of the amino acids had surface - exposed charges that were not in the proximity of any other charged amino acids for intramolecular ionic interactions .
these were lys441 , glu449 , and glu452 ( fig. 5c ) .
the presence of surface - exposed charges on this helix gives it strong potential for mediating protein - protein interaction .
we investigated whether ptst and gbss proteins could interact with each other in vitro .
furthermore , we sought to determine whether the predicted coiled coil on gbss participated in such a protein - protein interaction .
to address this , we used an in vitro pull - down assay using recombinant proteins expressed in escherichia coli .
briefly , gbss protein with a c - terminal polyhistidine ( his6 ) tag was incubated with an n - terminal glutathione - s - transferase ( gst ) - tagged ptst protein .
gbss was recovered using a ni2 + - nta resin , which specifically binds the his6 tag .
the gbss variants tested in this assay included charge - shift mutations of the three surface - exposed charges in the coiled coil - containing helix ( lys441 - - > glu , glu449 - - > lys , and glu452 - - > lys ) .
additionally , to abolish the coiled coil completely , we substituted the coiled coil - containing helix with the homologous helix from arabidopsis ssi ( with no predicted coiled coil ) , creating a chimeric gbss protein ( see s4b fig. for more details ) .
a substantial amount of ptst protein co - eluted with wild - type gbss , suggesting that the two recombinant proteins interact directly ( fig. 6a ) .
no interaction occurred between free gst and gbss , indicating that gbss interacts specifically with ptst ( s5 fig. ) .
additionally , all of the charge - shift mutations in the gbss coiled coil helix reduced the interaction in vitro .
the most substantial reductions occurred when lys441 and glu452 were mutated to carry the opposite charge .
no interaction was detected in the e452k variant or when charge - shifts were introduced in both lys441 and glu452 ( the k441e / e452k variant ) .
the chimeric protein that lacked the coiled coil helix altogether also did not interact with ptst .
these results not only demonstrate that ptst and gbss interact directly , but also implicate electrostatic potentials at the coiled coil region as integral to the interaction .

( b ) visualisation of gbss activity in - gel .
recombinant proteins were separated on sds - page gel containing 0.05 % ( w / v ) amylopectin and renatured in - gel .
following incubation with adp - glucose , activity was visualised by staining with iodine .
( c ) in vivo pulldown experiment by immunoprecipitation of tandem affinity purification ( tap ) ( c - myc ) - tagged ptst protein transiently co - expressed with variant forms of ha - tagged gbss in tobacco leaves .
anti - myc and anti - ha antibodies were used to detect the precipitated ptst and gbss proteins respectively .
we assessed whether these charge - shift mutations detrimentally affected gbss protein structure , by in - gel renaturation assays of gbss activity .
a variant carrying the glu486 - - > ala mutation was included as an inactive control : the corresponding residue to glu486 in e. coli glycogen synthase ( glu377 ) was previously shown to be essential for catalytic activity [ 37 ] .
the wild type gbss protein elongated amylopectin chains in the gel , indicated by dark blue - staining bands with iodine ( fig. 6b ) .
such a band was not seen in the e486a variant .
all charge - shift mutants retained activity , but none could be detected for the chimeric protein .
to investigate the interaction of the arabidopsis gbss and ptst proteins in planta , we conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment using transiently expressed proteins in tobacco leaves .
prey constructs were made encoding the wild - type gbss ( or its mutated variants ) tagged at the c - terminus with cyan fluorescent protein ( cfp ) and ha tags in tandem .
the bait construct encoded ptst with a c - terminal tap tag , containing c - myc epitopes .
agrobacteria strains containing bait or prey constructs were co - infiltrated into tobacco leaves and we confirmed that proteins were evenly expressed among different leaves .
the ptst - tap bait protein was successfully immunoprecipitated from extracted soluble proteins using anti - c - myc beads ( fig. 6c ) .
the wild - type gbss was only detected in the immunoprecipitate when ptst - tap was co - expressed , confirming the protein - protein interaction .
consistent with the findings of the in vitro pulldown assay , the charge - shift mutations of gbss at glu452 , or both lys441 and glu452 , markedly reduced the interaction .
the cbm48 domain is required for glucan binding in ptst a previous study demonstrated that ptst could bind to starch in vitro [ 26 ] .
we compared ptst binding affinity against wild - type and amylose - free waxy ( wx ) maize starch granules to test whether it interacted specifically with amylose or amylopectin .
briefly , the gst - ptst recombinant protein was incubated with either wild - type or wx starch .
the starch was pelleted by centrifugation , and bound proteins were eluted with sds .
we found that ptst could interact equally well with both wild - type and wx maize starch ( fig. 7 ) , suggesting that it primarily interacts with amylopectin .
under our assay conditions , free gst did not bind to starch , suggesting that the interaction with starch is via ptst ( s6a fig. ) .
furthermore , the gst - ptst protein was not found in the pellet fraction when starch was substituted with sephadex g - 10 resin , suggesting that no detectable protein precipitated under these assay conditions .
however , the majority of the gst - ptst protein used in the assay remained in the soluble fraction , despite the fact that starch was not limiting in our assay ( s6b fig. ) .
this suggests that binding affinity is low , or that the interaction with starch is transient .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.g007 fig 7 the cbm48 domain is required for glucan - binding in ptst .
binding of gst - ptst recombinant protein to intact wild - type ( wt ) and waxy ( wx ) maize starch granules was assessed in vitro .
unbound proteins are in the soluble fraction ( s ) , while bound proteins are in the pellet ( p ) .
no protein was detected in the final wash ( wf ) .
mutating both trp217 and trp255 in the cbm48 domain abolished the interaction with starch .
we tested whether the conserved cbm48 domain at the c - terminus of ptst was required for glucan interaction by mutating two conserved tryptophan residues ( trp217 and trp255 ) to alanine residues .
these residues align with key glucan - binding tryptophans ( trp100 and trp133 ) in the cbm48 of the mammalian amp - kinase beta subunit [ 38 ] .
the w217a / w255a variant of gst - ptst could not interact with either type of starch ( fig. 7 ) , showing that the cbm48 domain is critical for starch binding .
ptst is required for gbss localisation on starch granules in vivo the phenotype of arabidopsis ptst mutants strongly suggests that the localisation of gbss to starch granules requires ptst ( figs. 2 - 4 ) .
to further investigate this , we studied the localisation of fluorescently tagged arabidopsis ptst and gbss transiently expressed in tobacco leaves .
ptst - yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) and gbss - cfp proteins were visualised using confocal laser scanning microscopy .
when ptst - yfp was expressed alone , the yfp signal was found to co - localise with chlorophyll autofluorescence ( fig. 8a ) , suggesting that ptst is primarily a free soluble protein in the chloroplast stroma rather than bound to starch granules .
this finding is consistent with the abundance of ptst in the soluble fraction of leaf protein extracts ( fig. 3e ) and its weak interaction with starch in vitro ( fig. 7 ) .
interestingly , a similar stromal localisation was observed for gbss - cfp when expressed in the absence of the arabidopsis ptst protein ( fig. 8a ) .
however , when both proteins were co - expressed , ptst - yfp remained stromal while gbss - cfp localised exclusively to particles within the plastid that are similar in size , shape , and number to starch granules .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.g008 fig 8 localisation of fluorescently tagged ptst and gbss in tobacco leaves .
( a ) ptst - yfp and gbss - cfp were individually or co - expressed in tobacco epidermal cells and imaged using confocal microscopy .
note that the localisation of gbss - cfp on starch granules depends on ptst - yfp co - expression .
bar = 10 mum .
( b ) same as ( a ) , but additionally using the w217a / w255a non - starch - binding variant of ptst .
bar = 4 mum .
the above results provide direct evidence that ptst is required for gbss localisation onto starch granules in tobacco leaves .
however , the fact that ptst remained in the stroma implies that it interacted only transiently with starch during the gbss localisation .
to investigate the functional significance of this transient interaction , we conducted the experiment again with the w217a / w255a variant of the ptst protein , which cannot bind to starch ( fig. 7 ) .
we found that gbss could only localise to the starch granule in the presence of the wild - type ptst - yfp protein , and not in the presence of the w217a / w255a variant ( fig. 8b ) .
these data suggest that the direct interaction between ptst and starch is critical at some point in the gbss localisation process .
gbss overexpressed in arabidopsis requires ptst to efficiently localise to starch if ptst is required for gbss to localise to starch granules , it would be expected that the loss of ptst might cause an accumulation of unbound gbss in the stroma .
however , gbss was not detected in the soluble fraction of ptst mutants ( fig. 3e ) , most likely because free gbss is unstable .
therefore , we constitutively overexpressed gfp - tagged arabidopsis gbss under the 35s promoter in both wild - type and ptst - 1 plants , isolating multiple independent lines of each .
expression levels of gbss - gfp varied among transformants .
when expressed in wild - type plants ( 35s : : gbss - gfp lines ) , we found that gbss - gfp was almost exclusively in the insoluble fraction ( i.e. , localised onto starch granules ) , even in lines where expression was very strong ( fig. 9 , lines # 1 - 1 , # 2 - 2 ) .
in contrast , when gbss - gfp was overexpressed in ptst mutants ( ptst - 35s : : gbss - gfp lines ) , gbss - gfp was found primarily in the soluble fraction .
this further substantiates the finding that gbss localisation onto starch granules is inefficient in the absence of ptst .
also , gbss - gfp protein levels were generally low in ptst mutants , and we were not able to isolate lines with levels of expression comparable to the most highly expressing wild - type transformants ( e.g. , fig. 9 , line # 1 - 1 ) .
the lower abundance of gbss - gfp in the ptst background is consistent with the hypothesis that free gbss is unstable and prone to degradation in the chloroplast stroma .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.g009 fig 9 expression of gbss - gfp in arabidopsis ptst mutants .
soluble ( s ) and insoluble ( i ) protein fractions of leaf extracts were subject to immunoblot analysis with gfp antibodies .
three independent lines generated in both wild - type and ptst - 1 backgrounds are shown , each with varying expression levels .
starch - bound proteins are contained in the insoluble fraction .
the small difference in migration between soluble and insoluble fractions was reproducibly observed and may be due to differences in sample preparation and composition .
discussion a novel role for protein targeting in starch metabolism amylose synthesis occurs within a pre - existing matrix of amylopectin in developing starch granules [ 7,8,39 ] .
although amylopectin is semi - crystalline , the matrix it forms is hydrated and permeable to small molecules , such as the starch synthase substrate adp - glc .
the gbss protein buried within the granule uses adp - glc to processively elongate linear chains , which are protected from the activity of branching enzymes in the stroma .
hence , the granule - bound localisation of gbss is essential for its function .
in this study , we have demonstrated that ptst has a previously unknown role in localising gbss to starch granules .
this role is critical for amylose synthesis in arabidopsis leaves , since mutants lacking ptst accumulate starch containing only amylopectin ( fig. 2c ; table 1 ) .
on the basis of our findings , we propose that ptst targets gbss to the starch granule via a direct transport / delivery mechanism ( fig. 10 ) .
in this model , gbss first interacts with ptst in the chloroplast stroma via the coiled coil helix on the c - terminal domain of gbss that acts as docking site for ptst ( figs. 5 - 6 ) .
the complex then binds to amylopectin at the surface of the developing starch granules using the cbm48 domain of ptst ( fig. 7 ) .
finally , ptst dissociates both from the granule and from gbss , leaving gbss on starch where it can synthesise amylose .
presumably , it becomes buried as amylopectin crystallises above it while ptst returns to the stroma to recruit another gbss molecule .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1002080.g010 fig 10 proposed model of ptst - mediated gbss localisation to starch .
( a ) gbss docks onto ptst in the stroma , and the complex binds to starch .
( b ) ptst dissociates from both gbss and the starch granule , leaving gbss on starch to mediate amylose synthesis .
( c ) ptst returns to the stroma to recruit another gbss molecule .
we do not fully understand the mechanism behind the final dissociation step .
however , there is evidence that this step occurs , as opposed to ptst acting as a permanent " anchor " for gbss onto the granule .
firstly , gbss is by far the most abundant protein on arabidopsis starch , while ptst is far less abundant and only detectable by immunoblotting ( fig. 3a and 3d ) .
such a difference in amount strongly argues against an anchoring role , where a more even stoichiometry would be expected .
secondly , the localisation of arabidopsis gbss onto starch granules in tobacco leaves required the co - expression of arabidopsis ptst ( fig. 8 ) .
if ptst was acting as an anchor for gbss onto starch , both proteins would localise to the granule .
on the contrary , ptst remained in the stroma as gbss localised to starch granules .
consistent with these localisations , the amount of granule - bound ptst detected in wild - type arabidopsis in fig. 3d is small compared to stromal ptst ( fig. 3e ) .
the small amount in the granule probably gets trapped when amylopectin crystallises around it before it dissociates from its gbss cargo [ 40,41 ] .
the fact that ptst was not present on starch granules from the gbss mutant ( fig. 3d ) supports this model , suggesting that ptst does not interact with the starch granule in the absence of gbss .
indeed , interaction with gbss may be a pre - requisite for subsequent granule binding .
why is such a targeting mechanism necessary ?
to our knowledge , ptst is the first example of a protein with a dedicated role in targeting other proteins to the starch granule .
however , the idea of proteins localising to starch granules via interactions with other proteins has been previously discussed in the literature .
it was suggested that ss1 and a branching enzyme ( be2b ) in cereal endosperms are brought to the starch granule by forming a complex with ss2 , which plays the primary starch - binding role [ 42 ] .
it is unclear why these proteins , along with gbss , require such mechanisms to bind to starch efficiently .
while gbss does not have a specialised carbohydrate - binding module , it has carbohydrate binding residues in the c - terminal domain , which are important for coordinating the substrate in the active site - - a shared feature in all starch / glycogen synthases [ 35 ] .
the presence of these residues may explain the small amount of gbss detected on the ptst starch granules ( fig. 3c ) , which increased when starch was always present ( as seen in the ptst sex4 double mutant ; fig. 4a ) .
also , when constitutively over - expressed , some gbss - gfp protein localised to starch granules in arabidopsis in the absence of ptst ( fig. 9 ) .
gbss is therefore capable of interacting with starch by itself , but ptst greatly improves the efficiency with which it does so. a further possibility is that ptst delivers gbss to specific sites at the surface of the developing starch granule , where amylose initiation is most suitable .
any such specificity would likely be defined by the cbm48 domain , which we have shown to play an essential role during the targeting process ( fig. 8b ) .
we are currently characterising the binding specificity of this cbm48 domain compared with other cbms .
specialised interaction sites on gbss mediate ptst - docking our work suggests that the coiled coil helix on the gbss c - terminal domain is a ptst interaction site , and that lys441 and glu452 are key ptst - binding residues .
mutagenesis of these charged amino acids substantially reduced ptst interaction ( fig. 6 ) .
this finding is not surprising since electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids typically play a major role in coiled coil - mediated interactions [ 29 ] .
however , protein - protein interactions often involve many amino acids forming an interaction surface [ 43 ] .
while our study implies that the gbss coiled coil has a central role in forming the interface , other amino acids on adjacent helices may strengthen the interaction .
this could explain the residual binding of ptst in some of the charge - shift mutants of gbss , which was apparent in the immunoprecipitation assay from tobacco leaves , even when no interaction was detected in our in vitro assay ( fig. 6a and 6c ) .
interestingly , lys441 and glu452 are not fully conserved amongst gbss orthologs ( s4a fig. ) .
on the one hand , their conservation may not have been critical for selection due to the presence of other ptst - binding residues .
on the other hand , there may have been co - evolutionary pressures on ptst and gbss , where mutations on one protein were adjusted for by complementary mutations on the partner protein .
a consequence of such co - evolution would be limited cross - species compatibility between ptst and gbss .
such limited compatibility was recently documented for another complex involved in starch metabolism , the isa1 / isa2 complex , where partnering the arabidopsis isa1 with the rice isa2 protein could not restore normal levels of activity [ 44 ] .
in our experiments , arabidopsis gbss did not localise onto starch granules in tobacco leaves without the co - expression of arabidopsis ptst , even though the endogenous tobacco ptst was presumably present ( fig. 8 ) .
this could be due to cross - species incompatibility but could also be explained by our use of the 35s promoter for transient overexpression of gbss .
the large amounts of gbss may have exceeded the capacity of the tobacco ptst , and hence additionally requiring the ptst overexpression efficiently localise all the gbss to starch granules .
the presence of a coiled coil helix is not specific to gbss .
coils prediction analysis also suggests that ss2 has a predicted coiled coil in the same region of the protein as gbss ( s3 data ) , while ss4 has two predicted coiled coils in its n - terminal domain [ 45,46 ] .
however , there is no evidence that either ss2 or ss4 functions are compromised by the loss of ptst .
loss of ss2 causes significant changes in the chain length distribution of amylopectin , as well as changes in granule morphology [ 47,48 ] .
the ptst mutants produce amylopectin with a chain length distribution indistinguishable from the wild type ( s7a fig. ) , and starch granule morphology is unchanged ( s7b fig. ) .
loss of ss4 also affects granule morphology , but also drastically reduces the granule numbers per chloroplast [ 49,50 ] .
the arabidopsis ss4 mutant phenotype is characterised by the loss of starch in younger leaves , and chloroplasts of older leaves contain one large starch granule .
neither of these phenotypes were observed in the ptst mutant ( figs. 2c and s7c ) .
additionally , zymogram activity patterns of hydrolases , debranching enzymes , and starch synthases in soluble protein extracts from ptst mutants were identical to wild type ( s7d fig. ) .
these data suggest that gbss may be the exclusive interaction partner for ptst , although further work would be necessary to determine this conclusively .
in particular , it should be investigated whether the predicted coiled coil on ss2 mediates an interaction with ptst or other proteins .
interestingly , our coils analysis predicted that the recently identified rice protein floury endosperm 6 also contains coiled coils ( s4 data ) .
this protein also contains a cbm48 domain and has been shown to influence starch synthesis in rice endosperms , potentially via interaction with isoamylase - type debranching enzymes [ 51 ] .
ptst is a novel gene target for use in biotechnology to control amylose content the synthesis of amylose - free starch is a desirable trait in many species and such starches are extensively used by both food and non - food industries [ 19 ] .
our study has demonstrated that the ptst gene is essential for amylose synthesis in arabidopsis leaves .
this finding was unexpected because , to our knowledge , all amylose - free mutants described in other species are defective in the gbss gene .
extensive screens for amylose - free mutants have been conducted in many cereal crop species , as well as pea , potato , and cassava [ 13,14,52 ] .
it is therefore surprising that ptst mutant alleles have not been isolated in these screens , despite the sequence conservation ( and presumably functional conservation ) of ptst among higher plants ( fig. 1 ) .
one explanation would be the existence of two or more functionally redundant ptst paralogues in other species .
alternatively , ptst mutants in crop species may synthesise starch with substantial reductions in amylose content , rather than amylose - free starch .
our result with the ptst sex4 double mutant suggests that gbss ( and amylose ) can accumulate slowly in starch granules over extended periods of starch synthesis , even in the absence of ptst ( fig. 4 ; table 2 ) .
in storage organs , starch is also synthesised over relatively long periods of time ( i.e. , during seed filling or tuber / storage root development ) .
furthermore , iodine - based screening methods are excellent for detecting amylose - free phenotypes , since the absence of dark blue amylose - staining can be easily detected by eye [ 13,14 ] , but poor for detecting low - amylose mutants as the screening method is not quantitative .
it is also worth noting that distinct isoforms of gbss can mediate amylose synthesis in different tissues [ 53,54 ] .
in cereal species , there is an endosperm - specific gbss1 isoform and a leaf - specific gbss2 isoform [ 55 ] .
since arabidopsis only has the gbss2 - type isoform [ 55 ] , we cannot conclude from our study whether ptst is required for gbss1 - mediated amylose synthesis in cereal endosperm starches .
however , we predict that it is required since the rice ptst gene is strongly expressed in the developing endosperm ( s8 fig. ) and gbss1 isoforms are also predicted to contain a coiled coil helix ( s4a fig. ) .
despite the commercial value of manipulating amylose content , gbss previously represented the only gene target that controls amylose content directly .
our study shows that gbss is necessary but not sufficient for amylose synthesis in arabidopsis leaf starch .
therefore ptst represents a new potential target gene , the expression of which may be modified to manipulate amylose content .
in arabidopsis , the loss of ptst altered amylose content with no effect on starch content ( table 1 ) .
thus , reducing ptst expression in other species could reduce the amylose content of starches with no yield penalty .
according to previous work , gbss appears not to catalyse the rate - limiting step in amylose synthesis .
attempts to overexpress the gene in potato and wheat have not resulted in more amylose [ 56,57 ] .
our study raises the possibility that ptst may limit gbss delivery and thereby amylose synthesis .
ptst overexpression , particularly in conjunction with gbss may be an effective strategy to increase amylose content .
this may be of interest because currently the production of high - amylose starch is achieved by reducing the expression of branching enzyme [ 23 ] .
however , this approach incurs yield penalties and also changes amylopectin structure [ 21,23 ] .
we are currently studying the effect of ptst overexpression in arabidopsis to further investigate its potential to increase amylose content .

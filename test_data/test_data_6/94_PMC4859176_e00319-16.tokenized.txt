south dakota beef industry counciljoy scariafda cfsanjoy scariaelanco animal health , greenfield , int. g. nagarajacover - datemay / june 2016 genome announcement liver abscesses occur in feedlot cattle as a consequence of feeding them a high - grain diet ( 1 ) .
cattle with severely abscessed livers have lower feed intake , reduced weight gain , and a decreased gain - to - feed ratio ( 2 ) .
the primary causative agent of liver abscess is fusobacterium necrophorum ( 3 ) .
the ruminal acidosis resulting from the highly fermentable starch contained in the grains , and subsequent rumenitis , facilitate the migration of f. necrophorum from the rumen to the liver via portal circulation ( 1 ) .
recently , for the first time , we reported the occurrence , along with f. necrophorum , of a novel salmonella serotype , designated 6,7 : g,m,s : e,n,z15 , now named salmonella enterica subsp .
enterica serovar lubbock ( 4 ) , in liver abscesses of cattle ( 5 ) .
the newly reported serotype s. lubbock is closely related to s. enterica subsp .
enterica serovar mbandaka and has been isolated from subiliac lymph nodes of healthy cattle ( 4 ) .
it is not known whether s. lubbock is a causative agent of liver abscesses or is a secondary invader , via or lymph or blood , of an abscess initiated by f. necrophorum .
in a recent study , we observed that salmonella was prevalent in 20 to 25 % of the abscesses cultured , and s. lubbock was the predominant serotype .
here , we report the availability of draft genomes of 13 s. lubbock strains isolated from liver abscesses. s. lubbock strains were isolated from liver abscesses of feedlot cattle , as per a previously described protocol ( 5 ) .
the serotypes of the isolates were determined at the national veterinary service laboratory ( nvsl ) , ames , iowa .
strains were grown in brain heart infusion broth for 12 h at 37degreesc .
dna from each strain was isolated from 1.0 - ml cultures using the e.z.n.a. bacterial dna kit ( omega bio - tek , norcross , ga ) .
according to the manufacturer 's protocol , sequencing libraries were prepared using 1.0 ng of genomic dna using the nextera xt kit ( illumina , san diego , ca ) .
we used v2 paired - end chemistry ( 2 x 250 bp ) to sequence the genomes on an illumina miseq platform .
de novo genome assembly was performed using spades version 3.5.0 ( 6 ) , available at http :// bioinf.spbau.ru / spades .
genome annotation was performed using the ncbi prokaryotic genome automatic annotation pipeline ( pgaap ) ( 7 ) .
the genome characteristics of the 13 s. lubbock strains are summarized in table 1 .
the serotypes of the 13 strains were confirmed using seqsero ( 8 ) .
genome size and g + c content were estimated for all contigs of each strain .
among the 13 strains , the median values for genome size and g + c content were 4.97 mb and 52.1 % , respectively ( table 1 ) , and were similar to those of previously published s. enterica genomes .

the availability of these genomes will help to further understand the etiologic role of salmonella strains in liver abscesses in cattle and will serve as references in microbial trace - back studies to improve food safety .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
the sequences have been deposited as whole - genome shotgun projects at genbank under the accession numbers listed in table 1 .

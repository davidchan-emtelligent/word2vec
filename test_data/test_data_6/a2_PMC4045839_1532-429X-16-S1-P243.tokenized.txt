measurements of dyssynchrony have previously been performed using myocardial tagging to measure relative delays in peak shortening of opposing walls .
we aim to utilize non - tagged images to quantify dyssynchrony in clinical patients .
this is performed by combining aortic valve timing information from a left ventricular outflow tract ( lvot ) image series with segmentations of short axis datasets .
methods short - axis stacks and lvot images were acquired using standard retrospective ekg - gated bssfp cine imaging in 63 clinical patients with a range of clinical conditions ( mean ef = 44.5 +/ - 19.0 %) as well as 29 patients with prolonged qrs duration .
scan parameters were as follows : in - plane resolution : 1.25 - 2.08 mm , slice spacing : 8 mm with 2 mm gap , reconstructed temporal resolution : 18.2 - 58.8 ms. aortic valve opening and closing as a percentage of cardiac cycle was identified on lvot images .
volumetric evaluation of short axis images was performed via semi - automated segmentation for all phases and all left ventricular slices ( itk - snap , philadelphia pa ) .
dyssynchrony was measured by the standard deviation of the timing difference between each slice minimum area to aortic valve closure as expressed by the equation in figure 1 where tauslice min corresponds to the phase at which a slice achieves its minimum area .
figure 1 end - systolic dyssnchrony was quantified in 67 patients with a range of ef and qrs durations .
observed values were classified based on high , mid and low ed as well as normal prolonged qrs duration .
the observed dyssncrony for patients with low ef and prolonged qrs is higher than all other groups .
however , more patients are necessary to achieve signifance .
results the use of patients with prolonged qrs complexes allows for separation of measured dyssynchrony based on both ef and qrs .
patients were categorized into low ef (<= 35 %) , mid ef ( 35 % < ef < 50 %) and normal ef (>= 50 %) .
the results are shown in figure 1 .
as has been observed using tagged - mri , patients with low ef demonstrate higher dyssynchrony than both ef - matched controls as well as patients with long qrs but normal ef. conclusions this technique allows for a slice - by - slice timing based regional evaluation of dyssynchrony .
in addition , subsequent analysis of particular dyssynchronous slices could be performed to provide additional regional information .

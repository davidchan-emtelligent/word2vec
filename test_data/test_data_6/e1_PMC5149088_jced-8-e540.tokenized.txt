background orthognathic surgery is a branch of maxillofacial surgery .
it carries out the treatment of the facial skeleton asymmetries and deformities .
the patients who ask for this surgery are often young people who usually refer symptoms related to dental malocclusion , difficulty eating and temporo - mandibular pain .
these physical symptoms are often accompanied by psychological symptoms triggered by their physical appearance such as low self - esteem , self - confidence and negativism about their social and emotional future .
material and methods patients with skeletal malformation of facial bones , consisting in class ii , iii , open bite and asymmetries , underwent to orthognathic surgery in our center agreed to participate voluntarily in this study .
they answered a questionnaire regarding several psychosocial variables .
results orthognathic surgery helps to improve patient 's psychosocial well - being .
conclusions patients with dentofacial deformitiesexperience physical and psychological , oftentimes underestimated by society .
a combination of orthodontic treatment and reconstructive surgery is often a necessity to restore function and psychosocial well - being .
key words : orthogathic surgery , psychosocial consequences , mood , emotions , sense of power , motivation , satisfaction , social changes , satisfaction .
introduction orthognathic surgery is used to correct facial deformities affecting the jaw , maxillary and teeth .
the aim of ortognathic surgery is to harmonize the facial skeletal structure and it could improve the physical and psychological symptoms of the patients ( 1 ) .
in our opinion , people with facial deformities may be victims of prejudice and discrimination due to his physical appearance .
they could appear less employable and efficient than people with normal physical appearance ( 1 ) .
according to miguel ja et al. patients who demand orthognathic surgery frequently present negative psychological symptoms related to their physical appearance ( 2 ) .
furthermore , it seems clear that depending on the type of jaw deformities we could observe different psychological consequences ( 3 ) .
in fact , a comparative study of skeletal class ii and skeletal class iii patients showed that skeletal class iii patients had stronger feelings of insecurity regarding their facial appearance ( 4 ) .
in addition , as hunt et al. pointed out most of patients who request surgical - orthodontic treatment wish to improve their facial and dental appearance ( 5 ) .
according to these authors , patients expect to improve their self - steem and self - confidence .
moreover , they also look forward to feel less social embarrassment .
in line with the previous ideas , numerous studies showed that the satisfaction level with this surgery is usually high .
indeed , it has been observed an improvement of the physical and psychological symptoms ( 6 ) .
some of these studies even claim that the progress in terms of personality and physical appearance acceptance could be higher than the improvement of symptoms such as pain , clicking , locking and hipomobility ( 7 ) .
even though literature shows how patients underwent to orthognathic surgery experienced a quality of life improvement ( 8 ) , several and relevant psychological and psychosocial variables have been slightly considered .
in this regard , the main aim of our paper is to analyze the impact of orthognathic surgery in certain scarcely studied psychological variables such as mood and emotions ( anger , sadness , anxiety , hostility ) , sense of power and control or satisfaction with life .
in addition , other variables , as self - esteem , satisfaction with their appearance , satisfaction with surgery , social and family relations changes after surgery were analyzed .
interestedly the impact of the previous physical appearance on the patient 's feelings ( social embarrassment , depression , etc. ) was examined .
finally , we also evaluated the patient 's motivation to demand orthognathic surgery and the more negative aspects associated with surgery .
material and methods - method * participants 26 patients ( 10 males , 16 females ) with skeletal malformation of facial bones , consisting in class ii , iii , open bite and asymmetries , underwent to orthognathic surgery in our center agreed to participate voluntarily in this study ( 61.5 % women , 38.5 % men ) .
their mean age was 29.65 years old ( sd = 7.07 ) .
* orthodontic treatment and surgery all patients completed a specific orthodontic treatment previous to surgery .
the surgery planning was performed in close collaboration with patient 's orthodontist .
all patients in the study were underwent to bimaxillary osteotomies .
planning surgery was performed employing the traditional technique with classical model surgery and splint or with virtual planning using simplant o & o program .
the average length of postoperative hospital stay was 2 days .
an elastic occlusal locking was maintained for 2 week after surgery .
we ensured that patients filled the questionnaire at least six month later of the surgery intervention .
- materials * the questionnaire contained the following measures : * scale for mood assessment ( evea ) .
participants were asked to indicate the degree to which they felt 16 different emotional responses when thinking about the achieved through the surgery .
specifically the evea is composed by the following subscales ( 9 ) ( sanz , 2001 ) : anxiety (" nervous " , " tense " , " anxious " , and " restless ") , anger - hostility (" irritated " , " angry " , " annoyed " , and " displeased ") , sadness - depression (" melancholy " , " depressed " , " downcast " and " sad ") , and happiness (" happy " , " optimistic " , " joyful " , and " cheerful ") .
participants indicated the extent to which each emotion described their feelings on a scale ranging from 1 (" not at all ") to 10 (" completely ") .
the internal consistency reliability was appropriate for the subscales of anxiety ( alpha =. 72 ) anger - hostility ( alpha =. 51 ) , sadness - depression ( alpha =. 68 ) and happiness ( alpha =. 67 ) .
it is important to note that the item " melanchology " was removed from the sadness - depression subscale due to low reliability .
the mean score for each subscale emotions was calculated .
* sense of power and control was measured using two items to capture the extent to which the participant felt powerful / power - less and with control over the situation when thinking about the physical appearance achieved through the surgery .
the sense of power is an important " psychological state related with the perception of one 's capacity to influence others " ( galinsky , gruenfeld , & magee , 2003 ; p.314 ) ( 10 ) .
in order to measure it participants expressed their opinion on a scale ranging from 1 (" not at all ") to 10 (" completely ") .
* self - esteem and personal satisfaction .
two items were used to capture the extent to which the participant assess the self - esteem and the satisfaction when comparing with the previous self - steem ( 1 = " very bad " to 5 = " very good ") and satisfaction before the surgery ( 1 = " very unsatisfied " to 5 = " very satisfied ") .
we also added two additional items ( alpha = . 79 ) to examine patient 's perception of their actual facial 's appearance comparing with previous facial 's appearance ( 1 = much worse than before to 7 = much better than before ) .
finally , a single item was included to evaluate how their familiars , friends and workmates appraised the physical appearance achieved through the surgery intervention ( 1 = much worse than before to 7 = much better than before ) .
* satisfaction with life ( diener , emmons , larsen y griffin , 1985 ) ( 11 ) .
we used the spanish version of the satisfaction with life scale described by atienza , pons , balaguer and garcia - merita ( 2000 ) ( 12 ) .
this 5 - item scale allows researchers to measure global cognitive judgments of one 's life satisfaction .
participants were asked to rate the extent they agree or disagree with each of the 5 items on a likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree ; 5 = strongly agree ) .
we computed an index averaging all the items and emotional reactions ( alpha = . 87 ) , which indicates the extent to which participants held satisfaction with their life after the surgery .
* motivation and reasons for surgery .
firstly , we asked participants to write down the main reasons ( maximum 3 ) behind the decision of undergoing a surgery .
afterwards , participants were presented with three items that assessed the extent that the decision of undergoing a surgery was motivated by health concerns ( e.g. difficulties in speaking and swallowing ) and to what extent was driven by social and personal motives ( e.g. to make oneself feel better or to be accepted and integrated into the society ) .
scores of the social and personal two items were averaged ( alpha =. 66 ) .
* social , family and professional relationships .
three items measured changes in social , family and professional relationships after the surgery .
we modified the scale of response used by almeida silveira carvalho , de santana santos , studart rocha , amorim gomes , dias de oliveira e silva ( 2013 ) in order to obtain a more accurate measure .
so that , instead of using a 3 point scale ( good , fair or bad ) we inserted a likert scale of 5 points ( 1 = much worse than before , 2 = a bit worse than before , 3 = same than before , 4 = a bit better than before , 5 = much better than before ) .
* impact of the previous physical appearance on the patient 's feelings .
importantly , we measured how physical appearance made patients feeling in their lives .
specifically , we added two items to evaluate the extent participants felt " embarrassment " and " shame " ( alpha =. 78 ) .
in addition , we also included six items ( alpha =. 91 ) to study the extent that patients had " difficulties in concentrating , sleeping or relaxing " or the extent they felt " upset or irritable " when they thought about their physical appearance.lastly , a single item was included to evaluate the extent that participants felt depressed due to their appearance .
* aspects related with the surgery .
the questionnaire also included some items to examine if : a ) patients got the expected results , b ) patients recommend surgery to their family members and c ) what were the most bothersome aspect of surgery ( alves e silva , 2013 ) .
in addition , we added two items to analyze f ) to what extent the surgery has solved the problem that patient had and g ) to what extent patients feel positive and self - confidence after the surgery ( 1 = not at all to 5 = a lot ) .
finally , participants reporting socio - demographic information : age , sex and nationality .
after completing the questionnaire , participants were thanked for their participation .
results - statistical analyses we conducted several t - test comparisons with the midpoint of each scale in order to determine the level of the different variables included in our study .
we also carried several t - test paired comparisons in order to compare the differences between some varia - bles in our study ( spss for windows , version 17.0 ) .
- scale for mood assessment ( evea ) .
in order to examine the mood of patients when thinking about the physical appearance achieved through the surgery , a comparison with the midpoint of the scale was conducted .
results showed that patients presented a low level of negative emotions : anxiety ( m =. 66 , sd = 1.29 ; t ( 25 ) = 17.13 , p < . 01 ) , anger - hostility ( m =. 18 , sd = . 55 ; t ( 25 ) = 44.43 , p < . 01 ) and sadness - depression ( m =. 32 , sd = 1.09 ; t ( 25 ) = 21.66 , p < . 01 ) .
however , they informed to feel a greater level of happiness ( m = 8.48 , sd = 1.43 ; t ( 25 ) = 12.40 , p < . 01 ) .
- sense of power and control .
a comparison with the midpoint of the scale showed that patients presented a high level of sense of power ( m = 7.16 , sd = 2.68 ; t ( 24 ) = 4.01 , p < . 01 ) and a high level of sense of control after the surgery ( m = 8.31 sd = 2.25 ; t ( 25 ) = 7.46 , p < . 01 ) .
- self - esteem and personal satisfaction .
results showed that self - steem ( m = 4.54 , sd = . 50 ; t ( 25 ) = 20.44 , p < . 01 ) and personal satisfaction ( m = 4.92 , sd =. 27 ; t ( 25 ) = 45.46 , p < . 01 ) after de surgery was notably high .
similarly , we found that patients ( m = 6.63 , sd = . 48 ; t ( 25 ) = 33.24 , p < . 01 ) and their familiars and friends ( m = 6.42 , sd = . 64 ; t ( 25 ) = 23.16 , p < . 01 ) perceived them much better than before the surgery .
- satisfaction with life .
the analyses conducted showed that the satisfaction with life of the patients evaluated was significantly high ( m = 4.1 , sd = . 68 ; t ( 25 ) = 11.92 , p < . 01 ) .
- motivation and reasons for surgery .
results showed that both healthy ( m = 5.73 , sd = 1.77 ; t ( 25 ) = 6.39 , p < . 01 ) and social and personal ( m = 4.63 , sd = 1.72 ; t ( 25 ) = 3.35 , p < . 01 ) motives influenced importantly the decision of undergoing a surgery .
in addition , when we examined the reasons described by patients in the questionnaire , we observed that 50 % of the motives were classified as personal and social ( e.g. " to be complexes " , " social exclusion " or " to improve the psychical appearance ) whereas a 45.71 % were motives related with their health ( e.g. " jaw pain " or " difficulty chewing ") .
the 4.28 % of reasons described by the patients were motives not included in the previous categories ( e.g. " trust on the surgeon " or " recommendation of the dentist ") .
- social , family and professional relationships .
significant differences were found when comparing with the midpoint of the scale showing that social ( m = 3.76 , sd = . 92 ; t ( 24 ) = 6.80 , p < . 01 ) , family ( m = 3.28 , sd = . 67 ; t ( 24 ) = 5.75 , p < . 01 ) and professional relationships ( m = 3.72 , sd = . 89 ; t ( 24 ) = 6.84 , p < . 01 ) improved after the surgery .
- impact of the previous physical appearance on the patient 's feelings .
interestingly , results showed that patients felt quite embarrassed and ashamed ( m = 4.21 , sd = 1.86 ; t ( 25 ) = 1.94 , p < . 01 ) and also they informed to feel depressed ( m = 4.50 , sd = 2.23 ; t ( 25 ) = 2.28 , p < . 01 ) throughout their lives before being operated .
although , in this case , a comparison with the midpoint of the scale did not show significant differences , we also found that they felt moderately irritable and uncomfortable ( m = 3.29 , sd = 1.72 ; t ( 25 ) =. 60 , p > . 05 ) due to their physical appearance .
- aspects related with the surgery .
96 % of patients informed to get the results and to recommend surgery to their family members .
results also showed that the most bothersome aspects of the surgery were related with : eating issues ( 28.6 %) , the first week post - surgical ( 23.8 %) , paresthesia ( 21.4 %) , 24 hour postsurgical ( 9.5 %) , the immediate postoperative phase ( 7.1 %) , hospitalization ( 4.8 %) , immobilization ( 2.4 %) and other motives non specified ( 2.4 %) .
finally , the analyses allowed us to find out that patients highly considered that the surgery solved the problem they had ( m = 4.50 , sd = . 70 ; t ( 25 ) = 14.42 , p < . 01 ) .
moreover , we also observed that they feel positive and self - confidence after the surgery ( m = 4.42 , sd = . 64 ; t ( 24 ) = 15.24 , p < . 01 ) , ( figs. 1 - 3 ) .

discussion orthognathic patients present an objectified dentofacial deformities and , consequently , physical and psychological symptoms due to their pathology .
so that , according to rustemeyer et al. function , aesthetics , and even psychological aspects should be considered equally when planning surgery ( 13 ) .
regarding the psychological aspects , the present research focused on important variables related to orthognathic surgery .
specifically , we analyzed the impact of the surgery on : a ) mood and emotions ( anger , sadness , anxiety , hostility ) b ) sense of power and control , c ) self - esteem and personal satisfaction , d ) satisfaction of life , e ) motivation and reasons for surgery , social , family and professional relationships changes , f ) impact of the previous physical appearance on the patient 's feelings and finally we also explored g ) other issues related with the surgery ( e.g. what were the most bothersome aspect of surgery ) .
results of this research demonstrated that orthognatic sugery impact in a very positive way on the patient 's mood .
specifically we found that when patients thought about their physical appearance achieved through the surgery , patients presented a low level of negative emotions : anxiety , anger - hostility and sadness - depression ) .
in contrast , they reported to feel a greater level of happiness .
furthermore , our findings also showed that patients also felt with a high sense of control and power over their lives .
according to galinsky et al .
( 10 ) ( 2003 ) power is a psychological state observed when people perceive themselves as able to influence others .
so that , we might conclude that the psychical appearance achieved through the orthognathic surgery makes patients feel as more influential and powerful .
in this line of reasoning , our research also confirmed that orthognathic influenced on the self - steem and the personal satisfaction that patients had after the surgery .
they informed not only that they perceived themselves much better than before the surgery but also that their relatives and friends thought the same .
in our opinion , these results underline the importance of orthognathic surgery concerning the functional aspects but importantly regarding the psychological aspects .
the present research was able to make progress in the study on the consequences of orthognathic sugery .
interestedly , patients 's satisfaction with life was also notably high .
we are convinced that this is a very interesting result due to the importance of this psychological variable .
life satisfaction is " a global assessment of a person 's quality of life according to his chosen criteria " ( 14 ) ( shin and johnson , 1978 ; p. 478 ) .
we would like to stress how their psysical appeareance after the surgery impacted on the evaluation that patients make about the quality of their lives .
our findings showed that the cognitive judgments that patients made about their lives after the surgery were highly positive .
it is therefore not surprising that patients also informed that social , family and professional relationships improved after the surgery .
in other words said , surgery impacted not only on the psychological and healthy aspects of the patients but also on their social context .
in addition , our study was also aimed to examine the patient 's motivation for surgery .
the findings showed that both healthy and social and personal motives influenced importantly the decision of undergoing a surgery .
it seems clear that patients were motivated not only because of they experiment problems related to dental malocclusion , difficulty eating and temporo - mandibular pain , but also because these physical symptoms were often accompanied by psychological symptoms triggered by their physical appearance .
in this regard , our research also highlight how patients informed to feel quite embarrassed , ashamed and depressed throughout their lives before being operated .
we also found they felt moderately irritable and uncomfortable due to their physical appearance .
so that , we claim the importance of this type of surgery since their appearance causes double suffering because it affects the psychological and the psychical sides of their lives .
importantly , most of them informed to get the results that they expected and that the surgery solved the problem they had .
concluding , we would to stress that this report contains two points that are central to us : firstly , our analysis indicated that orthognathic surgery could improve physical and psychological symptom of patients with dentofacial deformities .
thus , the common knowledge that patients demand surgery only for aesthetic reasons should be reconsidered .
patients affected by dentofacial deformities should not be compared with patients with psychiatric disorders such as dysmorphophobia .
in fact , several reports showed that patient with dentofacial deformity present greater rates of satisfaction than cosmetic surgery patient ( 15 ) .
in our point of view , the reason of these results could be that most of the people demanding cosmetic surgery presenting normal physiognomy , although they are dissatisfied with their appearance .
however , patient requiring orthognathic surgery presenting an objectified dentofacial deformities and , consequently , physical and psychological symptoms due to their pathology .
in fact , several reports highlight that patients underwent to orthognathic surgery experimented a great improvement in physical and psychological problems .
so that , in our point of view , orthognathic surgery should be considered as important as other kinds of reconstructive and functional surgeries and not only an aesthetic procedure .
secondly , professionals engaged in orthognathic surgery know the calvary that orthognathic patients live due to the length of orthodontic treatment and immediate postoperative period morbidity .
to all this must be added thephysical and psychological suffering caused by dentofacial deformities , oftentimes underestimated by society .
fortunately , patient efforts are rewarded with brilliant results in terms of physical and psychological improvement .
in fact , as bellucci et al. underline in their work , a combination of orthodontic treatment and reconstructive surgery is often a necessity to restore function ( in terms of oral - motor development , airway , and speech ) and psychological well - being ( in terms of social interaction and quality of life ) ( 16 ). with these ideas in mind , we would to emphasize that orthognathic surgery should not be considered a luxury surgey .
indeed we strongly believe that patient affected by dentofacial deformities need this procedure to achieve their physical , psychological and functional well - being , and we are firmly convinced that public health institutions should respond to this need .
we want to sincerely thank to the participants of this study without whom this research could not have been conducted .

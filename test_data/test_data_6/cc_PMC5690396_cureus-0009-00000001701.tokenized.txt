introduction and background caroli 's disease is a rare congenital malformation of the intrahepatic bile ducts characterized by duct ectasia and dilation , which may involve the biliary tract in a focal or multifocal manner [ 1 ] .
it is currently included in group v of the todani classification of biliary tract cystic diseases and was first described by the french gastroenterologists , jacques caroli et al. , in 1958 [ 2 - 3 ] .
caroli 's disease is less common than caroli 's syndrome , and both are extremely rare with an approximate prevalence of less than one in 1,000,000 inhabitants [ 4 ] .
in caroli 's disease , congenital hepatic impairment is limited to the development of cysts and usually presents with abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium , obstructive jaundice , and cholangitis .
in caroli 's syndrome , cystic disease coexists with congenital or primary hepatic fibrosis .
in this case , the clinical presentation is usually due to hepatic insufficiency and portal hypertension , presenting with findings such as splenomegaly , ascites , peripheral edema , coagulation disorders , and esophageal varices [ 5 - 6 ] .
in both caroli 's disease and syndrome , several conditions may occur together , such as choledochal cysts , autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( arpkd ) , or even autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd ) , renal medullary spongiosis , and medullary cystic disease [ 6 - 7 ] .
both conditions less commonly affect men , with a male to female ratio of 1:1.8 .
although these conditions are generally diagnosed within the first two decades of life , they may remain asymptomatic for the entire life of the affected individual [ 7 - 8 ] .
we describe two cases of caroli 's disease presenting with chronic , low - grade , abdominal pain .
we believe the present reports are of medical significance since they relate to patients with atypical presentations and diagnosed at an unusually late age .
it serves also as a reminder that although rarely , caroli 's disease may present later in life , have atypical presentations and be masked by non - specific clinical findings .
these reports hope to add to the existing knowledge base of this very rare congenital disease .
review case one a 76 - year - old man consulted his primary care physician due to low - grade , chronic , epigastric pain with additional non - specific complaints .
the pain was pressing in character , non - remitting and had been present for approximately eight months .
the patient denied nausea , vomiting , weight loss , changes in bowel habits or fecal characteristics , fever , or urinary symptoms .
he also denied alcohol or tobacco consumption .
his history was positive for dyslipidemia , hypertension , obesity , orthopedic surgery in the right knee at age 39 due to trauma , and radical prostatectomy at age 69 following the diagnosis of a prostatic carcinoma .
abdominal ultrasonography revealed vesicular lithiasis , as well as a heterogeneous nodular lesion and atrophy of the left lobe of the liver .
the patient was therefore referred for surgical consultation to assess the need for cholecystectomy and to further investigate the liver findings .
a physical examination was remarkable for an overweight patient ( weight 70 kg , 1.65 m high ) , blood pressure of 146 / 92 mmhg , and pulse of 68 / min .
an abdominal examination revealed a non - painful abdomen with positive bowel sounds , with no discernible organomegaly .
the rest of the examination was unremarkable , as the patient presented systemically well with all observations within normal range .
a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( mrcp ) was performed , which revealed dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile ducts associated with parenchymal atrophy ( figures 1a , 1b ) .
figure 1 magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing ( a ) saccular dilatation of the left biliary tree ( arrow ) and ( b ) biliary dilatation in the left hepatic lobe ( arrow ) .
three nodular images without phase enhancement in the dynamic study were also identified , the first with 20 mm in the left branch of the main bile duct at the level of the bifurcation , the second with 12 mm in the duct of segment ii , and a third downstream of the previous one with 5 mm. these lesions were described as being compatible with a possible cholangiocarcinoma .
the right bile duct presented a small ectasia with 4.3 mm without parenchymal or upstream bile duct changes .
the extrahepatic bile ducts were unremarkable for changes in morphology or duct caliber .
a cystic lesion of the head of the pancreas and several parapyelic and cortical renal cysts were also observed .
laboratory data of peripheral blood on admission are provided in table 1 .

histological examination of the excised portion ( figure 2 ) revealed segments of the liver with parenchymal atrophy , multifocal cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts , periductal fibrosis , and an inflammatory infiltrate .
figure 2 surgical specimen showing cysts and gallstones .
discrete cholestasis , foci of micro - and macro - vesicular steatosis , scattered lymphocytes , and intrahepatic lithiasis were also observed .
the lymph nodes showed no histological changes nor did the surgical specimen present with histopathological findings of malignancy .
the morphological findings described were compatible with caroli 's disease with unilobar involvement and secondary periductal liver fibrosis .
the postoperative period was favorable and without complications , and the patient was discharged seven days later .
post - operatively , due to age , the exclusion of neoplastic suspicion and a favorable clinical outcome , follow - up benefits , and a proposal of discharge from the outpatient clinic was discussed , which the patient agreed to , remaining asymptomatic , under surveillance in the primary care setting .
case two a 47 - year - old man presented to his primary care physician with low - grade , chronic epigastric abdominal pain , which had lasted for six months , and was referenced to our department for further evaluation .
the pain was described as pressing in character , with no irradiation or associated factors .
his history was positive for oligophrenia , congenital malformation of the upper limbs , bilateral cataracts , chronic hepatitis b , type i diabetes mellitus , and cholecystectomy at age 38 .
the patient was mildly tender , locally , over the epigastric region of the abdomen but rebound tenderness was absent .
abdominal ultrasonography exposed an apparent atrophy of the left lobe of the liver .
mrcp revealed atrophy of the left lobe , dilation of the intrahepatic biliary tract and intrahepatic lithiasis , as well as a renal cyst on the left ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing intrahepatic biliary ectasia ( arrow ) .
based on these findings , a diagnosis of caroli 's disease was made .
the patient was prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid and discharged with follow - up appointments at the outpatient clinic with analytical reassessment and an annual mrcp .
seven months later , he presented to the emergency department with fever and severe abdominal pain .
an mrcp was performed , which in addition to the previous findings , revealed lithiasis of the main biliary tract ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing lithiasis of the main bile duct ( arrow ) .
a presumptive diagnosis of cholangitis was made , and he was admitted for seven days for medical management with antibiotic therapy .
an upper endoscopy was performed , which revealed no abnormal findings , and an abdominal ct revealed pneumobilia in the left intrahepatic biliary tracts and a small cortical cyst in the left kidney .
five years later , he had a second episode of cholangitis , was admitted to our department , and , once again , was medically treated for seven days and discharged for follow - up. in the time between the acute episodes , the patient complained only of low - grade , chronic epigastric abdominal pain , which was refractory to analgesic or ursodeoxycholic acid treatment .
laboratory data of peripheral blood during follow - up after the last cholagitis episode are provided in table 2 .

the patient was hospitalized and operated , having undergone bisegmentectomies ii and iii .
during the postoperative period , a bile collection was found adjacent to the sectioned area that required percutaneous drainage with a pigtail catheter and two instances of endoscopic retrograde cholangio - pancreatography were used to extract gallstones and remove biliary sludge that obstructed the common bile duct .
an examination of the surgical specimen demonstrated a rough capsular surface with an ill - defined area of 5x5x4 cm , with dilated ducts , wall fibrosis , multifocal hyperplasia of the peribiliary glands , and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate .
the lumen was occupied by friable brownish calculi , therefore , confirming intrahepatic lithiasis in caroli 's disease , and there was no evidence of malignancy .
while maintaining biliary drainage , he was discharged on the 35th day to the outpatient clinic , where the pigtail catheter was eventually removed .
the patient remains asymptomatic but continues to frequent the outpatient clinic for imaging follow - up of a residual biloma .
an mrcp performed four years later demonstrates that although there are no parenchymal focal lesions , there is a slight dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tract and some endoluminal focal filling defects , as well as a simple cortical cyst in the left kidney of 18 mm. discussion the cause of caroli 's disease is still unknown , but a genetic profile appears to exist and seems autosomal recessive in caroli syndrome and sporadic in caroli 's disease [ 9 ] .
studied mutations include genes that participate in the development of the kidneys and biliary tree , the most important of which is the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 .
this gene is thought to participate in the regulation of cell proliferation and adhesion , highly expressed in the kidneys and expressed in lower levels in the pancreas , liver , and lungs [ 9 - 12 ] .
mutations in the pkd1 and pkd2 genes are less frequent and appear to be the basis of several renal and hepatic abnormalities [ 10 ] .
caroli 's disease , when symptomatic , usually manifests with recurrent episodes of upper right quadrant abdominal pain , which may be accompanied by pruritus and jaundice .
recurrent bacterial cholangitis is the most common form of presentation , which may present as abdominal pain , fever , rigors , and malaise [ 5,13 - 14 ] .
the clinical presentation in our cases was atypical , presenting mainly with chronic pain and nonspecific complaints .
in case one , the patient reported low - grade , chronic , epigastric abdominal pain and nonspecific symptoms , which prompted image studies that incidentally detected cystic lesions compatible with caroli 's disease .
in case two , the patient presented similarly but more typical recurrent episodes of cholangitis followed , which led to hospitalization and additional investigations .
both patients in our cases became symptomatic at an unusual age .
typically , inaugural symptomatic episodes usually start between adolescence and early adulthood but can appear at any time .
a small number of patients may remain asymptomatic through life and may be diagnosed accidentally by imaging tests , even at older ages [ 9,13,15 ] .
among the most common ancillary tests used , ultrasound is the best initial examination since it is non - invasive , fast , and cheap , despite being operator - sensitive and having low specificity .
ultrasound findings are characterized by the irregular dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts , sometimes accompanied by extrahepatic ductal dilation due to cholelithiasis .
ultrasound also allows for renal evaluation in search of evidence of polycystic kidney disease [ 7,11,16 - 17 ] .
an mrcp with high sensitivity , specificity , and low associated invasiveness is currently the examination of choice .
though more expensive , it is universally considered the most consistent method for assessing disease extent and severity [ 5,8,18 ] .
no guidelines exist for caroli 's disease and given the scarcity of case reports , there are no randomized trials on different treatment modalities .
proposed therapy should , however , be tailored to individual patients and be contingent on clinical presentation , site , and extent of biliary abnormalities [ 19 ] .
medical therapy should be implemented with ursodeoxycholic acid , which acts to decrease hepatic synthesis , secretion , and intestinal absorption of cholesterol , consequently increasing bile fluidity [ 5,20 - 21 ] .
aggressive surgical strategies seem to provide the best results when complications , cancer risk , or disease extent are enough to justify a surgical procedure [ 22 - 24 ] .
surgical indication in these two cases of caroli 's disease was the suspicion of malignant neoplasia , expressed in the mrcp findings in case one and in the gradual increase of tumor markers ( alpha - fetoprotein and ca19 - 9 ) associated with a history of hepatitis in case two .
in case one , a left hepatectomy was performed and the evolution was frankly favorable with an apparent resolution of the underlying symptomatology and disease .
in case two , a left lateral bisegmentectomy was performed and although the patient is asymptomatic , imaging findings suggestive of vestigial biloma remain in the hepatic remnant .
because the risks of recurrence and neoplastic conversion are not permanently removed , annual follow - up is maintained at the hepato - pancreato - biliary outpatient clinic .
both patients maintain complete symptomatic resolution with surgical treatment until the present day .
patients with caroli 's disease usually require close follow - up and regular abdominal ultrasound , blood count measurement , and markers of inflammation , liver function , and injury are usually advised [ 5,13,21 - 22,25 ] .
in the event of exacerbations or in the emergence of complications , hospitalization should be weighed .
cholangitis , sepsis , cholelithiasis requiring interventional therapy , and complications from portal hypertension are indications for inpatient treatment .
a liver biopsy should also be performed in the inpatient setting when disease suspicion outweighs the morbidity associated with this technique [ 4,8,13,19 ] .
there are no unanimously accepted protocols for cholangiocarcinoma screening .
it is , however , consensual that ancillary tests , such as abdominal ultrasound , tumor markers ( ca19 - 9 and cea ) , or mrcp should be regularly performed given the high risk in this patient population [ 24 ] .
genetic counseling and familial investigation are also advised during follow - up in patients with caroli 's disease [ 6 ] .
conclusions in summary , caroli 's disease is a rare congenital malformation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and may be associated with conditions affecting other organ systems , such as polycystic kidney disease .
despite the very low prevalence , caroli 's disease should be present in the differential diagnosis of epigastric abdominal pain and recurrent cholangitis without risk factors or relevant history .
after clinical suspicion , the diagnosis is always imagiologic , with ultrasound and mrcp being the tests of choice .
caroli 's disease may present with indolent abdominal pain instead of the more typical presentation of recurrent cholangitis .
medical therapy should be performed with ursodeoxycholic acid , but surgical intervention can be curative .
nevertheless , the management strategy should be adapted to individual cases and strongly depends on the location and extent of cystic dilations , history of the disease , complications , and comorbidities .
complications can be frequent and severe , and mortality from cholangiocarcinoma deserves early intervention and close follow - up. the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

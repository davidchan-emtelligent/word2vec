summary keratin 8 and 18 ( k8 / k18 ) are major intermediate filament proteins of liver hepatocytes .
they provide mechanical and nonmechanical stability , thereby protecting cells from stress .
hence , k8 - null mice are highly sensitive to fas - mediated liver cell apoptosis .
however , the role of c - flip protein in k8 - null related susceptibility to liver injury is controversial .
here we analyzed c - flip protein expression in various k8 or k18 null / mutant transgenic livers and show that they are similar in all analyzed transgenic livers and that previously reported c - flip protein changes are due to antibody cross - reaction with mouse k18 .
furthermore , analysis of various apoptosis - or cell survival - related proteins demonstrated that inhibition of phosphorylation of nf - kappab and various stress activated protein kinases ( sapks ) , such as p38 mapk , p44 / 42 mapk and jnk1 / 2 , is related to the higher sensitivity of k8 - null hepatocytes whose nuclear nf - kappab is rapidly depleted through fas - mediated apoptosis .
notably , we found that nf - kappab and the studied protein kinases are associated with the k8 / k18 complex and are released upon phosphorylation .
therefore , interaction of keratins with cell survival - related protein kinases and transcription factors is another important factor for hepatocyte survival .
keratin intermediate filaments liver c - flip apoptosis nf - kappab sapk introduction keratins are important cytoskeletal proteins and their expression is restricted to epithelial cells .
keratin monomers - one from type i ( k9 - k28 , k31 - k40 ) and the other from type ii ( k1 - k8 , k71 - k86 ) - assemble into heteropolymers forming intermediate filaments ( if ) ( eriksson et al. , 2009 ; herrmann et al. , 2009 ; kim and coulombe , 2007 ; moll et al. , 2008 ; schweizer et al. , 2006 ) .
keratins are tissue - specific cytoskeletal proteins and their mutations cause organ - specific human diseases ( coulombe et al. , 2009 ; omary et al. , 2004 ; omary et al. , 2009 ) .
for example , k8 and k18 proteins are the major cytoskeletal proteins of epithelial cells in digestive organs such as liver .
the k8 / k18 expression in hepatocytes relates to liver - specific diseases observed in mutant k8 or k18 transgenic mouse models ( ku et al. , 2007 ; omary et al. , 2009 ) .
these experimental findings led to human liver - disease related studies that identified k8 / k18 variants in patients with liver diseases of multiple etiologies ( ku et al. , 2007 ; omary et al. , 2009 ; strnad et al. , 2012 ) .
in addition , transgenic mice models showed the significance of k8 / k18 proteins for liver protection against both mechanical and nonmechanical stress caused by toxic chemicals and apoptosis - inducing agents ( ku et al. , 2007 ; magin et al. , 2007 ; marceau et al. , 2007 ) .
the death receptor cd95 ( fas ) - mediated apoptosis can be induced by fas ligand ( fasl ) binding ( taylor et al. , 2008 ; wilson et al. , 2009 ) .
in mouse liver , it can be induced by the administration of fas antibodies ( ogasawara et al. , 1993 ) .
this extrinsic pathway requires the recruitment of the fas - associated protein with death domain ( fadd ) that binds to the intracellular region of the death receptor and forms the death - inducing signaling complex ( disc ) along with procaspase - 8 .
autoproteolytic conversion of procaspase - 8 into activated caspase - 8 initiates a caspase cascade leading to apoptosis .
flice - like inhibitory protein ( c - flip ) is a protein that takes part in the regulation of apoptosis by preventing caspase - 8 activation at the disc , thereby blocking the caspase cascade ( taylor et al. , 2008 ; wilson et al. , 2009 ) .
mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) are critical signaling molecules to transmit extrinsic stimuli into diverse cellular processes including apoptosis , mitosis , cell motility , differentiation and development ( cuevas et al. , 2007 ; gallo and johnson , 2002 ; wagner and nebreda , 2009 ) .
mapks are divided into three subfamilies , namely jnk1 / 2 , p38 mapk and p44 / 42 mapks ( erk1 / 2 ) .
their substrates are transcription factors , membrane receptors and other downstream protein kinases that become activated and are linked to the regulation of gene expression under various stimuli .
for example , activation of transcription factors ( e.g. , p53 , nf - kappab , c - jun , atf2 ) , and protein kinases ( e.g. , rsks , mks , msks ) is directly or indirectly associated with mapk signaling pathways ( avruch , 2007 ; wagner and nebreda , 2009 ) .
the variety of their substrates confers broad impact on gene regulation , which is ultimately under the control of mapks .
notably , all three subfamilies of mapks bind k8 / k18 and phosphorylate k8 ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ; he et al. , 2002 ; ku et al. , 2002 ) .
the abundance of cytoplasmic keratins provides plentiful binding capacity for mapks , whereas keratin ablation or mutations that are no more mapk substrates may lead to increased mapk availability to other molecules that modulate cell function .
indeed , k8 - null mice are highly susceptible to fas - mediated liver injury ( gilbert et al. , 2001 ) .
the increased susceptibility in k8 - null liver was reported to be due to a drastic reduction of c - flip protein and associated with inhibition of phosphorylation / activation of p44 / 42 mapks ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ) .
on the contrary , our previous studies showed no change of mouse c - flip protein in k8 or k18 ablation / mutation transgenic livers ( ku and omary , 2006 ) .
this discrepancy may have resulted from the use of two different c - flip antibodies , namely antibody ( ab ) # 06 - 864 ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ) and ab # 06 - 697 ( ku and omary , 2006 ) .
here , we compare levels of mouse c - flip protein expression in various mutant k8 or k18 transgenic mice liver .
our data show that the c - flip protein levels remain unchanged in the keratin mutant transgenic livers including k8 - null liver .
the band detected by ab # 06 - 864 and proposed to be mouse c - flip protein ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ) , was found to be due to cross - reactivity of this antibody with mouse k18 protein , which is drastically reduced in k8 - null liver and therefore excludes c - flip as a pathogenic factor .
indeed , our results show that the higher sensitivity of k8 - null hepatocytes to fas - mediated apoptosis is due to inhibition of phosphorylation / activation of nf - kappab and sapks , which results in depletion of nuclear nf - kappab and leads to a rapid initiation of massive apoptosis .
results ab # 06 - 864 against c - flip cross - reacts with mouse k18 a previous study showed dramatic decrease of mouse c - flip in k8 - null hepatocytes ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ) using ab # 06 - 864 .
in contrast , we reported that the level of c - flip protein was similar in mouse liver irrespective of the genotype , including k8 - null liver , by using a different c - flip antibody , namely ab # 06 - 697 ( ku and omary , 2006 ). of note , different immunogens were used to raise these antibodies ( fig. 1a ) .
the immunogen for ab # 06 - 864 was a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 447 - 464 of human c - flip .
when we compared the 18 amino acids of the human c - flip sequence with the corresponding mouse c - flip , 10 matches were found which corresponded to 56 % identity ( fig. 1a ) .
the immunogen for ab # 06 - 697 was a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 2 - 17 of human c - flip .
comparison between the amino acid sequence of this immunogen and mouse c - flip showed 14 conserved residues out of the 16 , which corresponded to 88 % identity ( fig. 1a ) .
in fig. 1b , immunoblots using the two different antibodies show striking differences in the protein band pattern in transgenic as compared to nontransgenic mouse liver .
immunoblot with ab # 06 - 697 showed a ~ 55 kd band regardless of the keratin mutation in the different transgenic mice ( fig. 1b ) .
in agreement with this , we observed similar amounts of c - flip mrna in the analyzed mice livers by rt - pcr ( fig. 1c ) .
however , in immunoblot using ab # 06 - 864 , the ~ 55 kd band was undetectable not only in k8 - null , which confirms the results of the previous study of gilbert et al .
( gilbert et al. , 2004 ) , but was also undetectable in k18 - null mice , hk18 wt and hk18 r90c overexpressing mice ( fig. 1b ) .
the obvious discrepancy between the expression of mouse c - flip mrna and c - flip protein points to differences in the specificity of two used antibodies .
we reasoned that the ab # 06 - 864 might cross - react with mouse k18 for the following reasons .
first , both mouse k18 and mouse c - flip have a molecular mass of ~ 55 kd. second , a common feature of the four different transgenic livers ( k8 or k18 - null and hk18 wt / mutant transgenic livers ) in which no ~ 55 kd band was detected by ab # 06 - 864 ( fig. 1b ) , was the absence or dramatic reduction of mouse k18 ( ku and omary , 2006 ). fig. 1. ab # 06 - 864 cross - reacts with mouse k18 .
( a ) alignment of two human c - flip immunogen sequences with the corresponding mouse c - flip .
the immunogen identity to mouse c - flip is 88 % for ab # 06 - 697 and 56 % for ab # 06 - 864 .
( b ) total liver homogenates from the indicated transgenic mouse strains were resolved in sds - page followed by coomassie blue staining to verify an equal amount of protein per lane or immunoblotting with indicated antibodies .
immunoblots with ab # 06 - 697 showed a ~ 55 kd band in all analyzed livers regardless of k8 / k18 absence or mutation ( this is a full size immunoblot instead of a single panel cut as published previously by ku and omary in their figure 3d ( ku and omary , 2006 )) .
in contrast , immunoblots with ab # 06 - 864 showed no ~ 55 kd band ( arrow ) in livers of k8 - null , k18 - null , hk18 wt , and hk18 r90c mice .
( c ) total rna was prepared from livers and amounts of mouse c - flip mrna were determined by rt - pcr with primer sets as described in materials and methods .
( d ) a keratin enriched fraction , by high salt extraction ( ku et al. , 2004 ) , was prepared from livers of nontransgenic fvb / n mice , k8 - or k18 - null mice , or transgenic mice that overexpress human wild - type or mutant k8 / k18 .
coomassie blue staining shows k8 / k18 bands in different transgenic livers , except for k8 - null or k18 - null livers due to rapid degradation in the absence of its heterodimeric partner .
mouse k8 / k18 and human k8 / k18 can be distinguished by their different molecular mass .
immunoblot of high salt extracts with ab # 06 - 697 showed no band , whereas ab # 06 - 864 produced ~ 55 kd bands ( arrow ) at the position of mouse k18 .
this was verified by immunoblot using a mouse k18 specific antibody , termed troma ii ( lower panel ) .
asterisk indicates unidentified band .
to verify the cross - reactivity of ab # 06 - 864 with mouse k18 , high salt extracts ( hse ) from livers of various transgenic mice were prepared to obtain the total liver keratin pool .
coomassie blue staining of the hse showed no mouse k18 in k8 - null / k18 - null livers and dramatically reduced mouse k18 in hk18 wt / r90c overexpressing livers ( fig. 1d , upper panel ) .
overexpression of hk8 wt and hk8 g62c in transgenic liver did not affect the level of mouse k18 although it caused reduction in the amount of mouse k8 protein .
immunoblots with ab # 06 - 697 showed no bands in the hse samples ( fig. 1d , 2nd panel ) , whereas ab # 06 - 864 produced ~ 55 kd bands in samples from nontransgenic mice , hk8 wt and hk18 g62c overexpressing mice ( fig. 1d , 3rd panel ) .
the bands overlapped with the position of mouse k18 protein in those mice ( fig. 1d , 4th panel ) .
these results demonstrate that ab # 06 - 864 is cross - reactive with mouse k18 .
effect of k8 absence on apotosis - associated cell signaling since we have shown that the ab # 06 - 864 cross - reacts with mouse k18 and thus is not specific for mouse c - flip , the proposed role of c - flip in the pathogenesis of fas - induced liver damage seems not to be justified .
this is also supported by our lethality studies on hk18 wt mice .
like in k8 - null liver , no band was detected by ab # 06 - 864 in hk18 wt liver , in contrast to nontransgenic fvb / n liver ( fig. 1b ) .
however , the lethality percentage of nontransgenic fvb / n mice and of hk18 wt mice caused by different forms of stress , i.e. administration of fas antibody alone , streptozotosin or fas antibody combined with pugnac ( an inhibitor of n - acetyl - d - glucosaminidase ) ( ku et al. , 2010 ) , was similar ( table 1 ) .
table 1 .
mouse lethality after injection of different agents1 .
two groups of mice [ one nontransgenic fvb / n (~ 55 kd band positive for ab # 06 - 864 ) and the other hk18 wt overexpressed transgenic mice ( negative for ab # 06 - 864 )] were examined for their lethality under three different stressed conditions .
p - value in each case is > 0.05 , thereby confirming no significant difference in mouse lethality between the two groups due to what was proposed to be a ' c - flip ' .
in terms of increased susceptibility of k8 - null mice after fas administration shown in previous study ( gilbert et al. , 2001 ) , we observed the same pattern of results that showed the increased mortality and liver damage in k8 - null mice after fas treatment ( supplementary material fig. s1 ) .
to gain further insight in the molecular mechanism of fas - induced liver damage in k8 - null mice , we analyzed the expression of several apoptosis - related proteins and the phosphorylation / activation of protein kinases and transcription factors , all of which are known to be associated with cell survival or apoptosis .
nontransgenic fvb / n mice and k8 - null mice received fas antibody intraperitoneally to induce liver apoptosis and liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting .
increased apoptosis in k8 - null livers as compared to nontransgenic fvb / n mice was observed by increased formation of cleaved caspase 7 fragment ( fig. 2a ) .
furthermore , phosphorylation / activation of p38 mapk , p44 / 42 mapk , jnk1 / 2 and p90rsk , all regulators of cell - cycle progression and survival ( anjum and blenis , 2008 ; wagner and nebreda , 2009 ) , was dramatically inhibited in k8 - null livers as compared to nontransgenic fvb / n mice under fas - mediated apoptosis ( fig. 2a ) .
inhibition of phosphorylation of p44 / 42 mapk in fas - treated k8 - null liver prevents subsequent phosphorylation of ribosomal s6 kinase ( p90rsk ) ( fig. 2a ) , known as a substrate of p44 / 42 mapk ( anjum and blenis , 2008 ) .
notably , the protein amount of all studied kinases was similar in immunoblots of both nontransgenic fvb / n and k8 - null livers ( fig. 2b ) .
consistent with these in vivo findings , a dramatic inhibition of p44 / 42 mapk phosphorylation in ex vivo cultured k8 - null hepatocytes was observed in a previous study ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ). fig. 2. k8 ablation inhibits activation of sapks and nf - kappab .
nontransgenic fvb / n or k8 - null mice were injected intraperitoneally with fas ab ( 0.15 mg / kg body weight ) to induce liver apopotosis .
after 2 and 4 hrs , liver homogenates were prepared and immunoblotted with antibodies against cleaved caspase 7 for apoptotic level and phospho - sapks for sapk activation ( a ) , nonphospho - sapks for sapk protein level ( b ) , and additional cell survival / apoptosis - associated proteins including nf - kappab and p53 transcription factors ( c ) .
note that phosphorylation / activation of sapks and nf - kappab was dramatically inhibited in fas - treated k8 - null liver as compared with nontransgenic fvb / n mice .
in addition , inhibited phosphorylation of p90rsk ( in panel a ) , a substrate of p44 / 42 mapk , is likely caused by inactive p44 / 42 mapk in fas - treated k8 - null liver .
numbers below immunoblots represent the relative pixel intensity of each band .
next , we tested the effect of k8 ablation on phosphorylation / activation of transcription factors and the expression of several apoptosis - related proteins .
remarkably , phosphorylation of nf - kb p65 was blocked in fas treated k8 - null livers and the expression of nf - kb target genes , such as bax ( grimm et al. , 2005 ) and c - flip ( kreuz et al. , 2001 ) , was downregulated in the k8 - null livers ( fig. 2c ) .
although the c - flip band of k8 - null ( lane 4 in fig. 2c ) was weaker than that of fvb / n under basal conditions ( lane 1 in fig. 2c ) , it is likely due to the variation of c - flip expression in individual mouse , which is independent of k8 expression .
the densitometric quantification of c - flip expression from 3 mice / strain showed the c - flip expression in both mice strains was similar under basal conditions ( supplementary material fig. s2 ) .
on the other hand , p53 expression was similar in livers of both mice strains independent of fas treatment ( fig. 2c ) .
the phosphorylation of p53 could not be analyzed for technical reason .
we observed no differences in other apoptosis - associated proteins and in stress - associated proteins such as hsp70 / hsp60 in livers of both nontransgenic fvb / n and k8 - null livers independent of fas treatment ( fig. 2c ) .
taken together , predisposition to apoptosis in k8 - null liver is related to the lower level of phosphorylated kinases / nf - kappab p65 .
the lower level is not likely due to rapid degradation of the proteins resulted from a consequence of faster apoptosis in k8 - null livers since the amounts of each kinase ( fig. 2b ) and nf - kappab p65 ( fig. 2c ) are similar in nontransgenic fvb / n liver and k8 - null liver .
in addition , the levels of cleaved caspase 7 in fvb / n and k8 - null livers after 4 hr treatment of fas antibody are similar , but the phosphorylation of the kinases / nf - kappab p65 is dramatically inhibited in the k8 - null liver ( fig. 2a ) whereas the amount of the proteins are similar in both livers ( fig. 2b ) .
hence , it is likely that k8 is involved in phosphorylation / activation of the proteins by an unknown mechanism .
interaction between k8 / k18 and protein kinases / transcription factors given that the enhanced susceptibility to liver injury in k8 - null liver is associated with a dramatic reduction in the level of phosphorylation / activation of protein kinases and nf - kappab p65 , we examined whether they interact with k8 / k18 .
we used the ht29 colon carcinoma cell line , which expresses high level of endogenous k8 / k18 .
the following conditions are tested : treatment with okadaic acid ( oa , a phosphatase inhibitor ) , colcemid ( col , an antimitotic agent ) , and anisomycin ( an , an apoptosis inducer ) .
strikingly , we observed an interaction between nf - kappab p65 and k8 / k18 under basal conditions , and the dissociation of the complexes under the various stress conditions including oa treatment ( fig. 3a ) .
we also detected the dissociation of the complexes in the hepg2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line after oa treatment , as found in ht29 cells ( fig. 3b ) .
these results demonstrated that in both cell lines nf - kappab p65 was released from the k8 / k18 complex in a phosphorylation - dependent manner .
in addition , nf - kappab p65 associated with k8 / k18 was observed in bhk21 cells overexpressing nf - kappab p65 and k8 / k18 ( fig. 3c ) .
in the other hand , under anisomycin - induced apoptosis , nf - kappab p65 - keratin interaction was disrupted whereas p53 - keratin interaction remained almost unaffected ( fig. 3a ) .
hence , it is likely that nf - kappab p65 , rather than p53 , may be a critical factor to be regulated by keratin complexes under apoptosis .
furthermore , interaction of p38 , p44 / 42 and jnk1 / 2 to k8 / k18 was also observed under basal conditions and remained almost unaffected by col or an treatment ( fig. 3a ) .
however , similar to the case of the transcription factors , oa treatment resulted in the dissociation of the complexes , implying the inhibition of their interactions by protein phosphorylation ( fig. 3a ) .
taken together , our findings indicate that the binding of keratins with cell survival - related protein kinases and transcription factors is important for cell survival and is pathogenic factor in liver injury. fig. 3. k8 / k18 associates with sapks and transcription factors nf - kappab and p53 .
( a ) ht29 ( human colon carcinoma ) cells were incubated in the presence or absence of okadaic acid ( oa ) for 2 hrs , colcemid ( col ) for 36 hrs , or anisomycin ( an ) for 8 hrs .
k8 / k18 immunoprecipitates were obtained and resolved by 10 % sds - page .
duplicate gels were stained with coomassie blue or transferred to pvdf membrane and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies .
arrowheads indicate degraded k8 or k18 .
note that nf - kappab / p53 and sapks are associated with k8 / k18 under basal conditions and released from the keratin complexes upon phosphorylation .
( b ) hepg2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were incubated in the presence or absence of oa and analyzed as described in panel a. as shown in ht29 cells , nf - kappab p65 in hepg2 cells interacts with k8 / k18 under basal conditions and dissociates from them upon phosphorylation .
( c ) bhk21 cells were transfected only k8 / k18 or k8 / k18 with nf - kappab p65 .
k8 / k18 immunoprecipitates and total lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies .
effect of k8 absence on localization of nf - kappab p65 cytoskeletal proteins , such as f - actin , tubulin and vimentin , are involved in the transport and / or localization of p53 ( o'brate and giannakakou , 2003 ) .
since it is established that the function of nf - kappab p65 is modulated by its subcellular localization ( meylan et al. , 2009 ) , we compared its distribution in nontransgenic fvb / n and k8 - null liver .
first , nuclear and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by immunobloting .
localization of nf - kappab p65 was similar in livers of both nontransgenic fvb / n and k8 - null animals under basal conditions ( fig. 4a ) .
however , nf - kappab p65 nuclear retention was markedly diminished in k8 - null liver under fas treatment as compared with control liver ( fig. 4b ) .
next , we examined the cellular distribution of nf - kappab p65 by immunofluorescence .
consistent with the immunoblot results , nf - kappab p65 nuclear depletion rapidly occurred in fas treated k8 - null liver .
most nuclei of k8 - null hepatocytes lacked nuclear nf - kappab p65 immunofluorescence at 2 hr after fas treatment , whereas ~ 15 % nuclei of nontransgenic fvb / n hepatocytes lacked nf - kappab p65 ( fig. 4c ) .
hence , in the case of increased susceptibility of k8 - null mice to liver injury , a rapid depletion of nuclear nf - kb p65 ( fig. 4 ) together with dephosphorylation / inactivation of nf - kb p65 ( fig. 2c ) occurred , and thereby blocked nf - kappab p65 mediated pro - survival pathway , which leading to facilitate apoptosis under liver injury. fig. 4. nuclear nf - kappab p65 in k8 - null hepatocytes is rapidly depleted following liver injury .

discussion the present study was prompted by discrepant findings of the importance of c - flip for the enhanced susceptibility of k8 - null mice towards liver - injury causing drugs ( gilbert et al. , 2004 ; ku and omary , 2006 ) .
the main findings of our study are as follows .
an antibody specific for c - flip detects no decrease in c - flip levels in liver of k8 - null and other keratin transgenic mice .
thus , c - flip seems not to be a pathogenic factor for the enhanced susceptibility of k8 - null mice for fas - mediated apoptosis .
rather , we find that inactivation of nf - kappab and various sapks , together with a rapid depletion of nuclear nf - kappab , is an important pathogenic factor ( fig. 5 ). fig. 5. model depicting different patterns of sapks activation and nf - kappab localization depending on the presence or absence of keratin filament under stress .
following fas - mediated liver injury , sapks such as p44 / 42 mapk and jnk1 / 2 are phosphorylated / activated in control fvb / n liver but not in k8 - null liver , which indicates k8 involvement in the activation of sapks by an unknown mechanism .
in the control liver , the activated sapks phosphorylate downstream kinases such as rsk1 that can finally phosphorylate nf - kappab .
this promotes nf - kappab movement into the nucleus where it may initiate pro - survival signaling pathways , thereby delaying liver damage .
on the other hand , the unphosphorylated sapks in k8 - null livers cannot activate downstream kinases such as rsk1 and as a consequence nf - kappab cannot be phosphorylated either .
this hinders its nuclear localization , interrupts the initiation of the nf - kappab - mediated pro - survival pathways and eventually leads to a rapid progression of apoptosis .
grey waved line and red dot denote keratin filaments and phosphorylation , respectively .
stress activated protein kinases , such as p44 / 42 mapks , p38 mapk and jnk1 / 2 , convert a variety of environmental stress signals into diverse cellular responses ( avruch , 2007 ) .
p44 / 42 mapks are phosphorylated / activated by mitogens and are upregulated in human cancers , whereas p38 mapk and jnk1 / 2 activation results either in apoptosis or in pro - survival depending on cell type and intensity of stress ( wagner and nebreda , 2009 ) .
our data demonstrate inhibition of phosphorylation of all these protein kinases in k8 - null liver under conditions of fas - induced apoptosis .
this implies that p38 / jnk - mediated apoptosis may not be involved in increased lethality of challenged k8 - null mice .
rather , sapk - mediated pro - survival pathways may be blocked in k8 - null liver under fas - induced apoptosis .
in agreement , inhibited phosphorylation / activation of nf - kappab and deficiency in nuclear localization were observed in fas - treated k8 - null liver , despite constant p53 protein level .
interestingly , all these kinases were found to be associated with k8 / k18 complexes under basal conditions , but were released in a phosphorylation - dependent manner .
the biological significance of this interactions remains to be further investigated .
another major finding in this work is the interaction of k8 / k18 with the transcription factors p53 and nf - kappab , which are apoptotic and pro - survival factors , respectively .
although the functional implications of this complex formation remain to be further determined , a biological significance of p53 binding to other cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin , f - actin and tubulin was demonstrated in previous studies ( o'brate and giannakakou , 2003 ) .
it has been shown that p53 is transported along microtubules to the nucleus and that this is important for p53 accumulation in the nucleus after dna damage ( giannakakou et al. , 2000 ) .
on the other hand , p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm of glioma cells depends on presence of vimentin , while nuclear accumulation is observed in vimentin - negative glioma cells ( klotzsche et al. , 1998 ) .
an aberrant cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 , therefore unable to act as a transcription factor , was found in various cancers including undifferentiated neuroblastoma ( moll et al. , 1995 ) and hepatocellular carcinoma ( ueda et al. , 1995 ) .
nf - kappab activation is involved in pro - survival pathways , leading to cancer development ( hayden and ghosh , 2012 ; perkins , 2012 ) .
however , little is known regarding the functional significance of cytoskeletal proteins in these signaling pathways .
although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood , the involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in the nf - kappab signaling was previously reported .
tnf - alpha mediated nf - kappab activation is reduced by colchicine - mediated inhibition of microtubule formation , while taxol - mediated microtubule stabilization ( even in the absence of tnf - alpha ) enhances nf - kappab activation ( jackman et al. , 2009 ) .
similarly , nf - kappab phosphorylation / activation is interrupted in k8 - null liver under stress as compared with control liver containing intact keratins ( fig. 2c ) .
together , this suggests that intact microtubules and keratins are important for the nf - kappab signaling pathway .
nf - kappab function is modulated by its subcellular localization .
under basal conditions , nf - kappab p65 / p50 , which has a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) is bound to ikappab which has a nuclear export signal ( nes ) .
thus , the complexes continuously shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm although most of them are in the cytoplasm under steady state ( hayden and ghosh , 2008 ) .
previous studies on cell cultures showed that upon stimuli , ikappab degradation and p65 phosphorylation occur , which results in nuclear translocation of nf - kappab ( chen and greene , 2004 ) .
however , our in vivo studies in livers demonstrate that : ( i ) nf - kappab p65 phosphorylation , at s534 in the mouse protein , can be detected under basal conditions in both nontransgenic fvb / n and k8 - null livers ( fig. 2c ) , ( ii ) nf - kappab p65 phosphorylation is diminished with the occurrence of fas - mediated apoptosis ( fig. 2c ) , and ( iii ) a rapid depletion of nuclear nf - kappab occurs in highly susceptible k8 - null hepatocytes following liver injury ( fig. 4 ) .
the loss of nuclear nf - kappab is probably due to failure of nf - kappab translocation in the nucleus and may be related to the inactivation of stress - activated protein kinases ( sapks ) , such as mapks .
various studies of the noncanonical pathway have shown that nf - kappab p65 is phosphorylated at s276 by rsk1 ( bohuslav et al. , 2004 ) and at s536 by msk1 ( chen and greene , 2004 ; vermeulen et al. , 2003 ) .
both kinases are downstream kinases regulated by mapks , such as p44 / 42mapk and p38mapk ( cargnello and roux , 2011 ) .
hence , it is likely that inactivation of sapks in k8 - null hepatocytes under conditions of liver injury results in a deficient phosphorylation state of nf - kappab .
as a consequence , this hinders its nuclear localization , interrupts the initiation of the nf - kappab - mediated pro - survival pathway and eventually leads to a rapid progression of apoptosis .
a major challenge ahead is to address how keratins modulate nf - kappab or p53 signaling .
future studies should aim to identify the interaction sites between keratins and the protein kinases / transcription factors and to reveal the relation between the intracellular distribution of the transcription factors and specific keratins by analyzing transgenic tissues .
this may result in information about a possible survival advantage for hepatocytes provided by intact keratins .
materials and methods reagents and keratin - mutant mice the following antibodies were used : c - flip antibodies ( ab # 06 - 697 and ab # 06 - 864 , upstate biotechnology / millipore ) ; fas antibody ( for mouse injection ; bd biosciences ) ; phospho - or nonphospho - p38 , p90rsk , phospho - p90rsk ( human t359 / s363 , mouse t348 / s352 ) , phospho - nf - kappab p65 ( human s536 , mouse s534 ) , phospho - p42 , c - jun n - terminal protein kinase ( jnk ) and c - jun ( cell signaling ) ; fas antibody ( for immunoblotting ) , fadd and bax ( upstate biotechnology / millipore ) ; fas - ligand ( santa cruz biotechnology ) .
k8 - null and hk18 wt mice were provided by robert oshima ( the burnham institute , la jolla , ca ) , k18 - null mice by thomas magin ( university of leipzig , leipzig , germany ) and hk8 wt / g62c and hk18 r90c mice were generated as described previously ( ku et al. , 1995 ; ku and omary , 2006 ) .
animal studies all animal experiments were performed in accordance with the korean food and drug administration guidelines .
protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the yonsei laboratory animal research center .
all mice were maintained in a specific pathogen - free facility .
for the lethality experiments , mice were injected intraperitoneally as previously described ( ku et al. , 2010 ) : fas ab ( 0.15 mg / kg body weight ) , stz ( 200 mg / kg ) , or pugnac ( 7 mg / kg ) and received a second fas ab injection after 48 hrs .
for the biochemical analyses , mice were treated with fas ab and livers were isolated after 2 hrs and 4 hrs .
the livers were homogenized in phosphate - buffered saline containing 5 mm edta and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 25 microg / ml aprotinin , 10 microm leupeptin , 10 microm pepstatin and 0.1 mm phenylmethyl - sulfonyl fluoride ) .
homogenized samples were used for preparation of total lysates or high salt extracts as described previously ( ku et al. , 2004 ) .
cell subfractionation homogenized liver samples were solubilized with lysis buffer a ( 0.1 % ca , 0.01 m nacl , 20 % glycerol in psb with 5 mm edta ) and incubated on ice for 10 min .
the cytoplasmic fraction was recovered after centrifugation ( 400 g , 5 min , at 4degreesc ) .
the remaining pellet was washed three times with the lysis buffer a and was solubilized in lysis buffer b ( 0.1 % ca , 0.5 m nacl , 20 % glycerol in pbs with 5 mm edta ) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation ( 15,000 g , 5 min , at 4degreesc ) to obtain the nuclear fraction .
to verify the purity of the fractions , lamin a / c or tubulin were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic marker , respectively .
cell culture and keratin immunoprecipitation ht29 ( human colon carcinoma ) cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and treated with okadaic acid ( 1 microg / ml for 2 hrs ) , colcemid ( 0.5 microg / ml for 36 hrs ) , or anisomycin ( 10 microg / ml for 8 hrs ) .
hepg2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were incubated in emem ( gibco ) with 10 % fetal calf serum and analyzed after treatment with okadaic acid ( 1 microg / ml for 2 hrs ) .
k8 / k18 immunoprecipitation was carried out using the mouse monoclonal antibody l2a1 ( ku et al. , 2004 ) .
biochemical analysis liver total lysates , high salt extracts or k8 / k18 immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10 % sds - page and then followed by either coomassie blue staining or transfer to pvdf membranes for immunoblotting .
immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence .
immunohistochemistry cryostate sections of mouse livers ( control and fas treated were fixed with acetone for 10 min at - 20degreesc and air - dried for 1 hour .
after three rinses with pbs , sections were blocked with 2.5 % bsa in pbs ( w / v ) for 10 min .
afterwards , sections were incubated with nf - kappab p65 antibody ( cell signaling ) diluted in pbs containing 15 % goat serum and 2.5 % bsa for 30 min .
after rinses with buffer , sections were incubated with texas - red labeled goat anti - rabbit igg ( molecular probes ) for 30 min .

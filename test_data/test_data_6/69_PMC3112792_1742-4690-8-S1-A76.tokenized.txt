it is known that several antibodies from the sera of htlv - 1 - infected individuals can neutralize htlv - 1 transmission .
the recently identified hbz factor acts as a negative regulator of viral transactivation .
to better investigate possible differences of gp46 , among health care ( hc ) and tsp / ham individuals , we have performed a point mutation characterization of this component in 146 clones from 10 htlv - 1 infected subjects .
the generated sequences were aligned using clustal x , and edited manually using genedoc software to identify possible protein signatures. from the same patient samples , the analyses were performed in the pcr amplified products from hbz and ltr sequences ( n = 10 ) to check the nucleotide sites changes and to perform a phylogenetic analysis , respectively .
we had performed the neighbor - joining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis with paup * software .
it was possible to identify , at least , 4 exclusive gp46 mutations among hc clones and 6 among tsp / ham clones .
the five common mutations were detected , with statistically significant difference , between hc and tsp / ham .
the overall genetic diversity was of 0.4 % and 0.6 % for hc and tsp / ham clones , respectively .
the potential protein domain analysis of gp46 showed , mostly , the presence of ck - 2 and pkc phosphorylation , n - myristilation and n - glycosilation sites .
in the hbz sequences analysis it was possible to identify 12 mutations , and 11 of them was found in 100 % of the generated sequences .
the phylogenetic analysis of ltr region demonstrated that all isolates belong to the transcontinental subgroup of the cosmopolitan subtype .

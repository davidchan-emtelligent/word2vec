cholestasis , affecting approximately 1 of 2 500 infants , is more commonly reported in preterm infants with an incidence varying between 10 and 20 % , and it is mainly due to a combination of factors including delayed enteral nutrition , low birth weight , prolonged parenteral nutrition , hypoxia , infection , liver ischemia , immaturity of bile acid metabolism , surgical procedures and multiple drug treatments [ 1 ] .
this reality of the setting is defined as transient or multifactorial cholestasis [ 2 ] , which is the most frequent form of cholestasis in neonatal intensive care unit , usually transient and followed by a gradual full recovery [ 3 ] .
cholestasis in preterm infants may however also be indicative of a severe liver disease such as biliary atresia ( ba ) or other biliary tract disorders .
the development of a persistent cholestatic jaundice , even in presence of colored stools , incentives to conduct a thorough investigation [ 4 ] .
abdominal ultrasonography may support the diagnosis of ba showing : absence of gallbladder , the " triangular cord " sign or a cyst located at porta hepatis .
transient multifactorial cholestasis is a diagnosis of exclusion and a definitive diagnosis can be made only after the complete resolution of the clinical picture .
moreover , diagnosis of biliary atresia in preterm jaundiced neonates is difficult since discoloration of stools can occur several weeks after birth [ 4 ] .
besides specific cholestatic disorders for which specific medical and surgical treatment are available , there is no unequivocal evidence that any medical treatment alters the natural history of multifactorial cholestasis .
treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid may indeed be useful , although there is no evidence of effectiveness .
every effort must be made to remove all risk factors for liver injury .
consequences of cholestasis also need to be managed by administering fat - soluble vitamins , especially vitamin k and nutritional formulas containing medium - chain fatty acids .
although multifactorial transient cholestasis is the most common cause of prolonged jaundice in preterm infants , neonatologists need to be aware that premature infants can also present with signs of severe liver disease .
to avoid any diagnostic delay it is mandatory to promptly identify all the conditions suitable for an early and specific treatment with a structured approach to the investigation of cholestasis tailored to the preterm infant [ 5 ] .

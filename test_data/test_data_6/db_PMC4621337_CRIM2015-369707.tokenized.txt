carbamazepine is a widely used anticonvulsant .
its metabolite , carbamazepine - 10,11 - epoxide , has been found to display similar anticonvulsant and neurotoxic properties .
while the ratio of parent to metabolite concentration varies significantly , at therapeutic doses the epoxide concentration is generally about 20 % of the parent .
we report a case of fatal carbamazepine overdose in which the epoxide metabolite concentration was found to be 450 % higher than the parent compound , suggesting a potential role for metabolite quantification in severe toxicity .
1. introduction the toxicity from carbamazepine ( cbz ) overdose has been well described and includes cardiac dysrhythmias , hypotension , coma , respiratory depression , and seizures [ 1 ] .
generally serum levels of cbz are used to assess or predict toxicity : with serum levels < 30 mcg associated with mild to moderate toxicity and serum levels > 40 mcg / ml associated with major toxicity symptoms ( apnea , seizures , and coma ) [ 2 - 4 ] .
however these serum cbz levels do not take into account the major active metabolite carbamazepine - 10,11 - epoide ( cbze ) which shares roughly equal anticonvulsant and neurotoxic effects with the parent drug cbz [ 5 , 6 ] .
serum concentrations of the metabolite cbze generally range from 15 to 40 percent of the parent drug in therapeutic concentrations and can rise to 50 to 80 % of cbz concentration after overdose [ 7 - 9 ] .
a number of drugs such as quetiapine , phenytoin , and valproic acid have been reported to alter cbz metabolism , significantly increasing serum levels of cbze to as high as 90 % to 150 % of the parent drug [ 7 , 10 ] .
an additional important feature of cbze is that , unlike the parent drug cbz , as serum cbze levels rise protein binding is saturated and the amount of free cbze increases , with subsequent increased availability for cns toxicity [ 11 ] .
we report a case of profoundly elevated cbze concentrations in the presence of moderately elevated cbz concentration after a cbz overdose and suggest a role for cbze measurement in the management of severe cbz toxicity .
2. case report a 21 - year - old female weighing approximately 59 kilograms presented to a community - based emergency department for assessment of a recent intentional ingestion of multiple medications .
according to her family , the patient had ingested as much as 17.8 grams of carbamazepine , 4.5 grams of hydroxyzine , 14.4 grams of ibuprofen , 1.2 grams of fluoxetine , and an unknown amount of lamotrigine .
the ingestion occurred approximately 1 hour prior to presentation .
upon presentation the patient was described as having an unsteady gait , slurred speech , confusion , tachycardia , hypertension , and suicidal ideation and was uncooperative with hospital personnel .
in the ed her immediate management consisted of benzodiazepines for agitation and iv fluid administration .
vital signs upon arrival included a blood pressure of 155 / 117 and heart rate of 124 .
no initial temperature was recorded .
laboratory analysis was recommended and the following pertinent positive and negative results were recorded : salicylate < 1 mg / dl , acetaminophen < 15.0 mcg / ml , etoh undetectable , cpk 462 u / l , lactic acid 3.0 mmol / l , and bicarbonate 17 mmol / l. the patient 's initial carbamazepine level , drawn between 1 and 2 hours after ingestion , was 24 mcg / ml [ 4.0 - 12.0 mcg / ml ] .
an ekg performed shortly after arrival demonstrated the following intervals : heart rate 124 , qtc 445 msec , and qrs 78 msec .
subsequent repeat ekg studies revealed a gradually increasing qtc measurement .
while in the ed the longest qtc measured was 479 msec .
while in the emergency department the patient experienced multiple episodes of tonic - clonic seizure - like activity lasting 15 - 20 seconds .
transfer to a tertiary care facility was arranged .
prior to transport the patient was intubated due to altered mental status and for airway protection .
following intubation the patient experienced worsening seizure frequency and duration .
over the course of the following 6 days the patient 's clinical course continued to worsen .
concern was raised for potential serotonin syndrome due the presence of uncontrollable seizures .
cyproheptadine therapy was initiated by the tertiary care facility via ng tube and was continued throughout her treatment .
she continued to receive benzodiazepines as well as propofol for control of recurrent seizure activity .
due to persistent seizure activity cpk remained elevated with a peak of 1262 iu / l. during this period renal function remained normal with a bun ranging from 7 to 10 mg / dl and creatinine ranging from 0.74 to 0.86 mg / dl. the patient was monitored closely for electrocardiographic abnormalities ; though her qrs remained less than 100 msec throughout , her qtc prolonged to as much as 663 msec .
this figure was significantly complicated by numerous coadministered medications and electrolyte abnormalities .
the patient developed ards on hospital day # 3 .
despite aggressive resuscitation the patient expired after a series of cardiac arrests on hospital day # 7 .
serial carbamazepine levels were drawn during the hospital stay .
please see table 1 for details .
the patient 's cbz level declined during the first 48 hours of her stay , only to increase significantly on hospital days three through six .
following the patient 's death on hospital day # 7 her body was transferred to the county coroner 's office for postmortem examination .
the cause of death was determined to be complications of acute intoxication by the combined effects of carbamazepine , carbamazepine - 10,11 - epoxide , and topiramate .
topiramate was a previously unknown intoxicant in this case .
3. methodology and results of postmortem analysis gross examination did not reveal any significant or unexpected abnormalities given the clinical course .
forensic laboratory reported serum results are summarized in table 2 .
drugs were extracted from 1.0 ml serum using clean screen csdau206 hydrophobic / cation exchange solid phase extraction columns ( uct , inc. , bristol , pa ) .
drugs were eluted from the columns in a two - step sequential elution , first liberating acidic / neutral drugs then basic drugs .
the separate extracts were concentrated and reconstituted in 500 - microliter acetonitrile and 100 - microliter acetonitrile , respectively .
the extracts were analyzed using full scan gas chromatography / mass spectroscopy with electron ionization .
carbamazepine / metabolites , topiramate , and phenytoin were identified in the acidic / neutral extract analysis , whereas lamotrigine , fluoxetine , and hydroxyzine / metabolites were identified in the basic extract analysis .
carbamazepine , carbamazepine - 10,11 - epoxide , and lamotrigine serum quantitation was performed by nms labs , willow grove , pa , using liquid chromatography with uv / vis detection measured at 215 nm. topiramate serum level was additionally determined by nms labs , using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy .
reference ranges were determined via nms laboratory standards .
in addition to these studies vitreous electrolytes were performed and resulted as follows : sodium 152 mmol / l , potassium 16 mmol / l , chloride 150 mmol / l , calcium 1.5 mmol / l , magnesium 0.76 mmol / l , glucose 28 mmol / l , lactate 17 mmol / l , urea nitrogen 22 mg / dl , and creatinine 3.2 mg / dl .
4. discussion the antemortem serum sample drawn on hospital day # 3 reveals a 4.5 / 1 cbze / cbz ratio .
this is dramatically higher than what has previously been reported .
at steady state the previously reported value for cbze levels in healthy patients was 10 % - 50 % of the serum cbz concentration [ 12 ] .
de groot et al. reported a ratio of 1.58 +/ - 0.16 in a patient with concomitant valproic acid and phenytoin use [ 10 ] .
so et al. reported on a group of 5 adults in whom seizure control had deteriorated despite multidrug therapy [ 8 ] .
in those individuals the addition or increase of another drug , most commonly valproic acid , elevated cbze / cbz ratios [ 8 ] .
adjustment of the patient 's medication by decreasing the amount of administered cbz resulted in a decrease in the cbze / cbz ratio and increased seizure control [ 8 ] .
this suggests that an increased cbze / cbz ratio , as well as increased serum cbze , contributes to seizure frequency and intensity. by hospital day # 6 the patient 's cbz level had elevated to nearly the same peak level as recorded in the first 48 hours of toxicity .
this may have been due to retained drug in the gut , impaired hepatic metabolism , drug - drug interaction , or other factors .
as this finding may represent prolonged absorption this patient may have benefited from early gi decontamination .
several features may have played a role in the elevated cbze concentration and cbz / cbze ratio .
carbamazepine is metabolized primarily by cyp3a4 in humans .
induction of cyp3a isoforms by other antiepileptic drugs has been shown to increase the metabolism of cbz to cbze in animal models [ 13 ] .
topiramate , found in toxic concentrations in this patient , has been shown to induce cyp3a4 in vitro [ 14 ] .
in that study the degree of cyp3a4 induction was increased with higher concentrations of topiramate .
the coingestion of both drugs in toxic amounts may be at least partially responsible for the markedly high cbze / cbz ratio , though individual genetic factors may be involved as well .
lamotrigine was found in our patient .
however , previous studies have shown that lamotrigine exhibited no effect on cbz or cbze concentrations [ 15 , 16 ] .
renal clearance may affect cbe / cbze ratios ; however in our patient renal function appeared normal when the 4.5 / 1 cbz / cbze ratio was recorded on hospital day 3 [ 17 ] .
propofol is known to produce mild inhibition of cyp3a4 but in therapeutic concentrations is believed to unlikely have a clinically significant effect [ 18 ] .
the cbze / cbz ratio observed in this patient highlights a potentially significant contribution cbze quantification may play in the large overdose .
routine measurement of cbze serum concentration may not be necessary in routine settings [ 19 ] .
however if observed clinical effects are in excess of what would normally be expected at a given cbz serum concentration , cbze quantification may be valuable .
as demonstrated previously , both cbz and cbze are effectively cleared via hemodialysis [ 20 ] .
in this case the falling cbz level may have been falsely reassuring despite ongoing severe symptoms .
a cbze level may have encouraged more aggressive management .
disclosure this study was deemed exempt by the irb of nationwide children 's hospital .

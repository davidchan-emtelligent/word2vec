pre - eclampsia is a pregnancy - related disease that may cause maternal , neonatal and fetal morbidity and mortality and exists in 3 - 5 % of pregnancies worldwide .
the discovery of dysregulated micrornas and their roles in placental development has provided a new avenue for elucidating the mechanism involved in this pregnancy - specific disorder .
here , the roles of human mir - 181a - 5p , a microrna that is increased in both the plasma and placenta of severe pre - eclamptic patients , in invasion and migration of trophoblasts were investigated .
ectopic - expression of mir - 181a - 5p impaired the invasion and migration of htr - 8 / svneo cells , whereas mir - 181a - 5p inhibition had the opposite effects .
igf2bp2 , which harbors a highly conserved mir - 181a - 5p - binding site within its 3 ' - utr , was identified to be directly inhibited by mir - 181a - 5p .
moreover , sirnas targeting igf2bp2 imitated the effects of overexpressed mir - 181a - 5p on htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration , whereas restoring igf2bp2 expression by overexpressing a plasmid encoding igf2bp2 partially reversed the studied inhibitory functions of mir - 181a - 5p .
thus , we demonstrated here that mir - 181a - 5p suppresses the invasion and migration of cytotrophoblasts , and its inhibitory effects were at least partially mediated by the suppression of igf2bp2 expression , thus shedding new light on the roles of mir - 181a - 5p in the pathogenesis of severe pre - eclampsia .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction normal proliferation / differentiation of human placental trophoblasts contributes to the proper function of the placenta .
dysregulated differentiation of trophoblast cells causes abnormal trophoblasts invasion and syncytialization and leads to pregnancy - related diseases including pre - eclampsia ( pe ) 1 .
pe is a pregnancy - specific disease that may cause maternal and neonatal / fetal morbidities and mortalities , existing in 3 - 5 % of pregnancies worldwide2 .
although an imbalance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors in circulation , including decreased placental growth factor ( plgf ) , as well as increased endoglin and fms - related tyrosine kinase 1 ( flt1 ) in soluble form , were implied to have a critical pathogenic role in pe3 , the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown .
microrna ( mirna ) , a set of non - coding small rnas , plays regulatory roles by mainly inhibiting target function via directly interacting with its mrna 3 ' - untranslated region ( 3 ' - utr ) , with subsequently transcriptional degradation / translational repression4 .
human mirnas are highly expressed in the placenta5 and are substantially altered in the placenta from patients complicated with pregnancy - related diseases , such as pe6 - 8 .
mirnas in circulation have been suggested as promising biomarkers of pregnancy - related diseases , thus providing new diagnostic and therapeutic options during pregnancy9 .
in our previous work , significant increase of some plasma mirnas including mir - 181a - 5p was found in circulation of patients with severe pe ( spe ) 10 .
subsequently , the increase of plasma mir - 181a - 5p was confirmed in women with spe11 , as well as the elevation of placental mir - 181a - 5p in patients with spe7,8,12 .
all these studies suggest the importance of mir - 181a - 5p in the pathogenesis of spe .
however , the molecular function of mir - 181a - 5p in placental development and its contributions to the development of spe when deregulated have not been investigated .
the dominant theory suggests two main types of pe : placental pe and maternal pe , which are characterized by abnormalities originating from either a malfunctioning placenta or from environmental / maternal nutritional factors , respectively13 .
in the present study , we intended to discover the possible roles of mir - 181a - 5p in trophoblast invasion and migration .
the elevation of placental mir - 181a - 5p was confirmed in severe pre - eclamptic placentas .
transwell assays were performed using trophoblast cells treated with mimic or inhibitor of mir - 181a - 5p .
we further tested if insulin - like growth factor 2 mrna - binding protein 2 ( igf2bp2 ) is a target directly inhibited by mir - 181a - 5p by using luciferase report assays .
combined with sirna imitation assays and rescue experiments , we demonstrated that mir - 181a - 5p suppresses invasion and migration of trophoblasts at least partly by directly targeting igf2bp2 .
results mir - 181a - 5p is up - regulated in severe pre - eclamptic placentas , compared to normal placentas our previous report demonstrated the up - regulation of seven plasma mirnas , including mir - 181a - 5p , in circulation of pre - eclamptic patients compared to that of normal pregnant females .
in the beginning of this study , the up - regulation of mir - 181a - 5p was confirmed in severe pre - eclamptic placentas ( fig. 1a ) .
we then examined mir - 181a - 5p expression of three trophoblasts lines : htr - 8 / svneo , jar , and jeg - 3 cells .
mir - 181a - 5p expression was top in jeg - 3 cells and lowest in htr - 8 / svneo cells ( fig. 1b ) .
abnormal trophoblasts invasion / migration caused by dysregulated differentiation of trophoblast cells contributes to pe development .
we subsequently tested the invasion / migration capacities of the above three trophoblasts lines and found that the jeg - 3 cells , which had the highest mir - 181a - 5p expression , had the weakest invasion and migration abilities , about 10 - fold lower than those of htr - 8 / svneo cells , which had the lowest mir - 181a - 5p expression ; jar cells had a slightly , but not significantly , lower capacities of invasion and migration compared to htr - 8 / svneo cells ( fig. 1c ) .
these results suggested that the mir - 181a - 5p expression might be associated with trophoblast invasion and migration. fig. 1 mir - 181a - 5p expression in human placentas and human trophoblast cells a differential mir - 181a - 5p expression in severe pre - eclamptic placentas ( n = 10 ) and normal placentas ( n = 10 ) was assessed by qrt - pcr .
b mir - 181a - 5p expression in three trophoblast cell lines , with the highest expression observed in jeg - 3 cells and the lowest expression observed in htr - 8 / svneo cells .
c invasion and migration capacities of the three tested trophoblast cell lines .
jeg - 3 cells had significantly lower invasion / migration capacities than htr - 8 / svneo and jar cells .
representative fields of invaded / migrated cells ( at 200x original magnification , bar = 10 mum ) are shown .
# the jeg - 3 cells applied in invasion / migration assays were two - fold more than htr - 8 / svneo and jar cells , as its weak invasion / migration capacities .
the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd based on at least three independent experiments .
** p < 0.01 ; the values with diverse letters are also significantly different ( p < 0.01 ) since the invasion and migration capabilities of jeg - 3 cells were too weak and the htr - 8 / svneo and jar cells exhibited similar low mir - 181a - 5p expression and high invasion / migration capacities compared to jeg - 3 cells , we chose htr - 8 / svneo , a cell line established by stable transfection of the gene encoding simian virus - 40 ( sv40 ) large t - antigen into normal first trimester human trophoblasts14 , as the primary cell model to study the biological roles of mir - 181a - 5p in trophoblast invasion and migration .
mir - 181a - 5p suppresses htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration to find the possible roles of mir - 181a - 5p in invasion and migration of trophoblasts , we treated htr - 8 / svneo cells with either mimic or the corresponding negative control of mir - 181a - 5p , before using transwell assays with / without matrigel to measure cell invasion / migration , respectively .
the number of cells invading / migrating through transwell pores was significantly reduced after mir - 181a - 5p transfection ( fig. 2a ) .
we subsequently assessed the effects of mir - 181a - 5p inhibition on htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration by transfecting cells with the mir - 181a - 5p inhibitor .
as expected , inhibiting mir - 181a - 5p significantly promoted htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration compared to the corresponding negative control cells ( fig. 2b ) .
transfected cells were assigned to cell counting assays in 96 - well plates to examine the change in cell number at 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h , in parallel with transwell assays in the presence and absence of matrigel ( fig. 2c , d ) .
during the first 24 h , the time period in which the transwell assays were performed , neither the mir - 181a - 5p mimic nor the inhibitor had any obvious effect on cell number , compared to their respective negative controls , indicating that the difference in the number of invaded / migrated cells after mir - 181a - 5p mimic or inhibitor transfection was a primary effect of changes in the cell invasion and migration capacities , not due to secondary effects of cell proliferation .
in addition , the ectopic - expression and inhibition of mir - 181a - 5p were confirmed by qrt - pcr after transfection ( fig. 2e , f ) .
collectively , these results indicated that mir - 181a - 5p suppresses htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration. fig. 2 mir - 181a - 5p suppresses htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration a , b htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration were inhibited upon transfection of mir - 181a - 5p mimic a , and enhanced upon transfection of mir - 181a - 5p inhibitor b. representative fields of invaded / migrated cells ( at 200x original magnification , bar = 10 mum ) are shown .
c , d transfected cells were subjected to cck - 8 assays in parallel with transwell assays in the presence / absence of matrigel , and the changes in cell number at 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h were measured .
e , f ectopic - expression and inhibition of mir - 181a - 5p were confirmed by qrt - pcr .
the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd based on at least three independent experiments .
** p < 0.01 mir - 181a - 5p directly inhibits igf2bp2 to investigate the mechanism involved in mir - 181a - 5p suppressing the invasion and migration of trophoblasts , four computational algorithms , namely , targetscan 7.0 , pita , pictar , and miranda were utilized to predict mir - 181a - 5p direct target genes .
igf2bp2 was selected as a candidate of mir - 181a - 5p targets for further evaluation .
to examine whether igf2bp2 is directly inhibited by mir - 181a - 5p , its full - length 3 ' - utr was introduced into the pgl3 - control luciferase vector ( fig. 3a ) .
after co - transfection with mir - 181a - 5p mimic , the luciferase reporter activity was significantly decreased , indicating that mir - 181a - 5p directly inhibited igf2bp2 .
moreover , inhibition of endogenous mir - 181a - 5p by co - transfection with inhibitor of mir - 181a - 5p significantly increased luciferase reporter activity ( fig. 3b ). fig. 3 igf2bp2 is directly inhibited by mir - 181a - 5p a construction of a pgl3 - control luciferase vector containing the full - length igf2bp2 3 ' - utr .
b the effects of mir - 181a - 5p mimic and inhibitor on the luciferase activity of the igf2bp2 wt 3 ' - utr reporter were measured .

e igf2bp2 protein level was assessed by western blotting in the 10 paired severe pre - eclamptic placentas and normal placentas mentioned in fig. 1a .
a representative western blotting image of four paired placentas is shown , and the molecular weight markers are depicted on the left in kda .
igf2bp2 protein level was statistically analyzed by quantitating the intensity of the igf2bp2 bands relative to that of the corresponding gapdh ones .

the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd based on at least three independent experiments .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 mirnas bind to target gene mrnas for either mrna degradation or translation repression4 .
to investigate how mir - 181a - 5p modulates igf2bp2 expression , we tested effects of mir - 181a - 5p on igf2bp2 mrna / protein levels in htr - 8 / svneo cells .
igf2bp2 mrna levels declined by approximately one half after ectopically expressing mir - 181a - 5p ( fig. 3c ) .
consistent with this , a significant decrease of the endogenous igf2bp2 protein levels was caused by mir - 181a - 5p ( fig. 3c ) .
conversely , treatment with the mir - 181a - 5p inhibitor raised both mrna / protein levels of igf2bp2 ( fig. 3d ) .
to evaluate whether placental expression of igf2bp2 is correlated to mir - 181a - 5p expression in diseased states , we examined igf2bp2 expression in 10 severe pre - eclamptic placentas and 10 normal placentas by western blotting. of interest , severe pre - eclamptic placentas showed significantly higher mir - 181a - 5p level ( fig. 1a ) and significantly lower igf2bp2 expression ( fig. 3e ) .
the same inverse correlation between the expression levels of igf2bp2 and mir - 181a - 5p was also evident in the three trophoblast cell lines : high igf2bp2 - expressing htr - 8 / svneo and jar cells had relatively lower mir - 181a - 5p expression , while low igf2bp2 - expressing jeg - 3 cells exhibited higher mir - 181a - 5p levels ( fig. 1b and supplementary fig. 1 ) .
mir - 181a - 5p - mediated repression of igf2bp2 occurs via a conserved binding site in 3 ' - utr of igf2bp2 mrna mirnas work by first binding to mrna via specific target sites that are typically evolutionarily conserved and perfectly matched to the 5 ' end of the mirnas15 .
two predicted positions for mir - 181a - 5p binding to igf2bp2 mrna were shown in the 3 ' - utr : one locates at 15 - 38 bp and is highly conserved across species , while the other locates at 1118 - 1141 bp and is poorly conserved ( fig. 4a ) .
to determine whether the inhibition of igf2bp2 by mir - 181a - 5p occurred via these predicted mir - 181a - 5p - binding sites , the above two sites were mutated , respectively , and referred as the m1 and m2 mutants .
luciferase reporter assays indicated that the m1 mutant 3 ' - utr interrupted mir - 181a - 5p - mediated repression , whereas the m2 mutant 3 ' - utr showed similar inhibition as wild - type ( wt ) 3 ' - utr when treated with the mir - 181a - 5p mimic ( fig. 4b ) .
consistent with this , inhibiting endogenous mir - 181a - 5p by its inhibitor raised the activities of the wt and m2 mutant 3 ' - utr reporter but not that of the reporter containing m1 mutant 3 ' - utr ( fig. 4c ) .
these results suggested that the highly conserved sequence locating at 15 - 38 bp of the igf2bp2 3 ' - utr is the major mir - 181a - 5p binding site , and further confirmed that mir - 181a - 5p directly inhibits igf2bp2. fig. 4 a mir - 181a - 5p binding site exists in the 3 ' - utr of igf2bp2 mrna a two putative mir - 181a - 5p binding sites are shown in the 3 ' - utr of igf2bp2 mrna .
b , c the luciferase activities of reporter vectors containing either the wt or the m1 / m2 mutant 3 ' - utr were measured in the presence of mir - 181a - 5p mimic or inhibitor .
the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd based on at least three independent experiments .
** p < 0.01 sirnas targeting igf2bp2 imitate the effects of overexpressed mir - 181a - 5p on trophoblast cell invasion and migration igf2bp2 sirna was introduced into htr - 8 / svneo cells to study whether the effects on trophoblast invasion and migration by mir - 181a - 5p were mediated via its direct target , igf2bp2 .
as expected , cell invasion and migration were significantly reduced upon transfection of igf2bp2 sirna , with effects similar to those after mir - 181a - 5p overexpression ( fig. 5a ) .
igf2bp2 expression levels were examined in parallel after sirna transfection ( fig. 5b ) .
the suppressive effects of igf2bp2 sirna on trophoblast invasion and migration was further investigated in jeg - 3 cells with mir - 181a - 5p inhibition .
excitingly , transfection of igf2bp2 sirna not only resulted in an inhibition of jeg - 3 cell invasion and migration ( supplementary fig. 2a ) , but also abolished the invasion / migration - stimulative effects of mir - 181a - 5p inhibitor on jeg - 3 cells ( supplementary fig. 2c ) .
igf2bp2 expression levels were examined in parallel ( supplementary fig. 2b and d ) .

the values with diverse letters are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) discussion in eutherian organisms , the placenta interfaces the fetal and maternal environments and is obligatory for supporting fetal development and growth ; dysregulated placental development leads to diseases of pregnancy , such as pe , as maternally accompanied with hypertension , proteinuria , and systemic vasculopathy that impacts many maternal organs , and with a secondary effect on fetal growth and health9 .
mirnas are intimately involved in human development and disease16 .
the discovery of dysregulated mirnas , e.g. , mir - 210 , mir - 376c , and mir - 455 , and their gene - regulatory roles in placental development has provided a new avenue for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of pregnancy - specific diseases , such as pe17 - 19 .
in the present work , we demonstrated that mir - 181a - 5p , a mirna that is increased in both the plasma and placenta of severe pre - eclamptic patients compared to those experiencing normal pregnancies , inhibits trophoblast invasion and migration by directly targeting igf2bp2 .
up - regulation of mir - 181a - 5p in circulation was first found in patients with spe in our previous study10 .
several other studies indicated that this increase of mir - 181a - 5p also exists in placenta from severe pre - eclamptic patients7,8,12 , which was confirmed in the present study .
mir - 181a - 5p has been extensively studied and reported to have essential roles in t cell sensitivity and selection20 - 22 , multiple myeloma pathogenesis23 - 26 , radio / chemo - therapeutic resistance of cancer27 - 29 , stroke30,31 , and autophagy32,33 .
in reproductive systems , mir - 181a - 5p was reported to mediate the effects of anti - mullerian hormone ( amh ) on follicular development34 .
in addition , mir - 181a - 5p was significantly decreased in seminal plasma from azoospermia but increased in that from asthenozoospermia compared to age - matched fertile controls35 .
however , whether mir - 181a - 5p has roles in trophoblast differentiation and placental development and whether its dysregulation contributes to pe development remain unknown .
it is widely accepted that trophoblast differentiation in the pre - eclamptic placenta may be abnormal as early as the first trimester , which is long before the clinical manifestations of pe can be detected , leading to incomplete vascular remodeling caused by impaired deep trophoblast invasion13,36 .
in this work , we first determined mir - 181a - 5p expression in term - matched normal placentas and severe pre - eclamptic placentas and in three trophoblasts lines .
htr - 8 / svneo cells , a extravillous trophoblasts line established by stably transfecting normal human first trimester trophoblasts with the gene encoding sv40 large t - antigen14 , were primarily utilized to study the roles of mir - 181a - 5p in trophoblast invasion / migration .
transfection with either mimic or inhibitor of mir - 181a - 5p significantly suppressed or enhanced , respectively , htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration .
one bioinformatic prediction of igf2bp2 directly inhibited by mir - 181a - 5p was validated by using luciferase reporter assays and qrt - pcr / western blotting .
furthermore , a conserved mir - 181a - 5p binding site in the 3 ' - utr of igf2bp2 mrna was identified by sites - mutagenesis .
in addition , sirnas targeting igf2bp2 imitated the mir - 181a - 5p ectopic - expression in suppressing htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration , whereas restoring igf2bp2 expression with an igf2bp2 - coding plasmid partially rescued the inhibitory abilities of mir - 181a - 5p in htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration .
these results suggested that mir - 181a - 5p suppresses cytotrophoblast invasion and migration at least partially by directly targeting igf2bp2 .
mir - 181a - 5p plays critical roles in invasion / migration of various cancer types : it promotes invasion and migration in ovarian cancer37 and prostate cancer38 but inhibits invasion and migration in breast cancer39 ; this may be due to the existence of tissue - specific targets .
igf2bp2 is one member of the igf2bp family that has previously been regarded as oncofetal , as its members were originally discovered in developing embryos40 .
igf2bp2 is an important gene associated with type 2 diabetes , and a recent study found that igf2bp2 - / - mice were lean and resistant to diet - induced obesity41 .
in addition , igf2bp2 plays critical roles in myogenesis42,43 , autophagy transition44 , and the promotion of cell migration and invasion in cancer45,46 .
however , igf2bp2 has never been studied in trophoblast invasion and migration , although another igf2bp family member , igf2bp3 , was found to stimulate invasion and migration of trophoblasts47 .
in our present work , igf2bp2 sirna impaired invasion and migration of htr - 8 / svneo cells , and igf2bp2 overexpression rescued the suppressive effects of mir - 181a - 5p on htr - 8 / svneo cell invasion and migration , suggesting an important role for igf2bp2 in trophoblast invasion and migration that has never been reported before .
interestingly , we also demonstrated the decreased igf2bp2 expression in severe pre - eclamptic placentas that expressed increased mir - 181a - 5p .
in summary , we demonstrated that mir - 181a - 5p , a mirna elevated in both the plasma and placenta of severe pre - eclamptic patients , suppresses trophoblast invasion and migration by directly targeting igf2bp2 .
however , one limitation is that the data presented in this study were mainly obtained from human trophoblast cell lines in vitro .
the " in vivo " function of mir - 181a - 5p in placental development and in the pathogenesis of spe need to be further explored , for example , in mouse with mir - 181a - 5p conditionally deleted in its placenta .
another limitation of this study is that we were unable to test whether differential mir - 181a - 5p expression exists between primary human trophoblast cells from pregnant females who would or would not develop clinical manifestations of spe at the first trimester ( when trophoblast differentiation occurs ) .
further work is needed to identify circulating mirnas , such as mir - 181a - 5p , that could serve as biomarkers for the non - invasive predictive diagnosis of spe as early as the first trimester .
materials and methods sample collection for the confirmation of reported placental mir - 181a - 5p elevation in spe7,8,12 , term - matched placenta samples between 36 and 40 weeks were obtained with informed consent from women experiencing severe pre - eclamptic pregnancies ( spe group ; n = 10 ) and normal pregnancies ( normal group ; n = 10 ) at the department of gynecology and obstetrics in the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university .
severe pre - eclamptic pregnancies were recruited according to the definition in williams obstetrics ( 23rd edition ) .
briefly , these pregnant patients , with no history of pre - existing / chronic hypertension , exhibited either pressure of systolic blood <= 160 mm hg or pressure of diastolic blood <= 110 mm hg by <= 2 points (<= 6 h apart ) when patients rested on bed , accompanied by severe proteinuria ( urinary protein excretion , <= 2 g / 24 h ) after the first 20 weeks of gestation .
no other maternal complications presented in the spe pregnancies .
the patient characteristics of these two groups are summed up ( table 1 ) , and the research protocols were approved via the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university .
all pregnancies were treated by elective cesarean delivery in the absence of labor .
within 1 h of cesarean birth , four tissue blocks (~ 0.3 cm3 each ) were sampled randomly around the position of umbilical cord insertion site at the decidual side of each placenta to achieve adequate and uniform sampling and instantly snap - frozen / stored with liquid nitrogen .

transient transfections were performed using lipofectamine rnaimax ( for oligonucleotide transfections ) or lipofectamine 2000 ( for plasmid transfections ) from life technologies when cells were 50 - 60 % confluent and oligonucleotide - lipid or plasmid - lipid mixture was prepared by following the instruction from manufacturer .
cells were obtained 2 - 3 days after transfection for further investigation .
in vitro invasion / migration assays invasion assays were conducted in transwell inserts ( costar , cambridge , ma , usa ) pre - coated by matrigel ( bd biosciences , beit - ha ' emek , israel ) as previously reported48 .
in brief , htr - 8 / svneo and jar cells ( 0.7 x 105 cells for the assays with single ectopic - expression of igf2bp2 , and 1.5 x 105 cells for the other assays ) suspended in 200 mul rpmi 1640 medium without fbs or jeg - 3 cells ( 3 x 105 cells ) suspended in 200 mul high - glucose dmem medium in the absence of fbs were laid in the matrigel ( 50 mul of 1 mg / ml ) - coated upper compartment of transwell inserts , whereas the lower well contained corresponding mediums ( 600 mul with 10 % fbs ) .
after 22 h 37 degreesc incubation with 5 % co2 , non - invaded cells attaching to the top side of the insert membrane were cleared by cotton swabs .
the cells invading to the bottom side of the insert membrane were gently cleaned by pbs and immediately immersed in pre - chilled methanol ( - 20 degreesc ) for 12 - min fixation .
fixed cells were subsequently incubated with hematoxylin for 12 - min staining .
stained cells were photographed of five randomly selected non - overlapped fields visualized at 200 x magnification by using a dmi6000 b microscope ( leica , heidelberg , germany ) equipped with a dfc420 camera ( leica ) , and counted for the estimation of cell invasion .
all the images were processed with photoshop cs6 ( adobe systems , san jose , ca , usa ) .
the number of invaded cells with different treatments was normalized to the corresponding controls .
the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd , and representative fields of invaded cells ( at 200 x original magnification ) are shown .
the migration assays were performed similarly to the invasion assays , except the inserts were not conducted with pre - coating of matrigel .
the number of migrated cells with different treatments was also normalized to the corresponding controls .
the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sd , and representative fields of migrated cells ( at 200x original magnification ) are shown .
cell counting kit - 8 ( cck - 8 ) assay two days after transfection , 5000 cells were laid per well of 96 - well plates ( five replicate wells for each condition ) .
cck - 8 assays were performed at 0 ( plated with medium containing cck - 8 ) , 24 , 48 , and 72 h after cell - plating .
culture medium was changed every 2 days , if necessary .
for each assay , culture medium was changed to 100 microl of cck - 8 medium ( dojindo , japan ) and kept for further 2 h. the plates were read on a varioskan ( tm ) flash microplate reader ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) at wavelength of 450 nm after 2 - h incubation and the mean absorbance of five replicate wells per condition was recorded .

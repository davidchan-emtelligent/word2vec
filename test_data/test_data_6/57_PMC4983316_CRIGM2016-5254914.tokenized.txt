an unusual case of campylobacter pouchitis resembling the endoscopic appearance of crohn 's disease is reported .
1. introduction proctocolectomy with ileal pouch - anal anastomosis ( ipaa ) is the preferred treatment for medically refractory ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , uc - associated dysplasia or malignancy , and familial adenomatous polyposis .
postoperative complications of ipaa include pouchitis , crohn 's disease of the pouch , cuffitis , and irritable pouch syndrome [ 1 , 2 ] .
pouchitis almost exclusively affects those with uc rather than fap , and it usually responds well to treatment with antibiotics .
however , pouchitis remains the most frequent complication of ipaa with a prevalence up to 50 % and a significant impact on quality of life [ 1 - 3 ] .
the majority of pouchitis cases are idiopathic but up to 20 - 30 % of cases are found to have an identifiable cause including acute infections [ 4 ] .
2. case presentation a 41 - year - old man with ulcerative colitis and a history of total proctocolectomy with subsequent ipaa for toxic megacolon in 1999 presented with fever , right lower quadrant abdominal pain , and diarrhea .
since the ipaa , he had mild recurrent acute pouchitis a few times per year , with symptoms of increased stool frequency and urgency , which would promptly resolve with 2 - 3 days of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole .
his most recent episode of pouchitis was 4 months prior to presentation .
five days prior to presentation , he developed a fever up to 103degreesf and watery diarrhea every 20 - 30 minutes .
four days prior to presentation , he developed severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain that became progressively worse .
complete blood count , serum electrolytes , renal function , and liver function tests were normal except for mild acute kidney injury with creatinine 1.37 mg / dl. c - reactive protein was markedly elevated at 27 mg / dl. ct of the abdomen and pelvis with iv and po contrast showed wall thickening of the distal ileum and pouch with no abscess .
due to his high fever , he was started on piperacillin - tazobactam empirically .
clostridium difficile pcr , ova and parasites , giardia stool antigen , and cryptosporidium stool antigen were all negative .
he subsequently underwent pouchoscopy , which demonstrated an endoscopic pattern resembling crohn 's disease in the pouch and distal ileum with severe inflammation , marked friability , and deep ulcerations within the pouch and prepouch ileum ( figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )) .
however , histologically the small bowel mucosa was acutely inflamed with no evidence of chronic inflammation , architectural distortion , or granulomas .
stains for cmv and hsv were negative .
on hospital day 4 , a stool culture was positive for campylobacter and subsequently further characterized as campylobacter coli by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight ( maldi - tof ) mass spectrometry .
at this point , the patient 's stool frequency had improved to 7 bowel movements per day and he had defervesced on piperacillin - tazobactam .
he was discharged on azithromycin 500 mg by mouth daily for a total of 10 days to treat severe campylobacter coli pouchitis .
on follow - up 4 months later a pouchoscopy showed normal mucosa in the pouch and prepouch ileum ( figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b )) and he continues to do well today .
3. discussion campylobacter is an uncommon cause of pouchitis [ 5 ] , but this case serves as a reminder to check for its presence in severe acute pouchitis .
patients with enteric infections from campylobacter species typically present with symptoms of fever followed by abdominal pain , dehydration , and diarrhea and occasionally display endoscopic features that mimic crohn 's disease .
cases of campylobacter enterocolitis causing transmural inflammation resulting in small intestinal obstruction and toxic megacolon in patients without inflammatory bowel disease have been described [ 6 , 7 ] .
two cases have been reported to date describing ulcerative colitis patients with ileal pouches affected by campylobacter - associated infection , both presenting with high fever , dehydration , abdominal pain , and increased bowel frequency [ 5 ] .
in this case , the lack of histological evidence of chronic inflammation to suggest crohn 's disease would have raised suspicion for acute infectious ileitis even in the absence of a stool culture positive for campylobacter .

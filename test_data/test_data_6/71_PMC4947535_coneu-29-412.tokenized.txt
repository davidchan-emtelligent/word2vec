http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 purpose of review recent developments in functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) have catalyzed a new field of translational neuroscience .
using fmri to monitor the aspects of task - related changes in neural activation or brain connectivity , investigators can offer feedback of simple or complex neural signals / patterns back to the participant on a quasireal - time basis [ real - time - fmri - based neurofeedback ( rt - fmri - nf )] .
here , we introduce some background methodology of the new developments in this field and give a perspective on how they may be used in neurorehabilitation in the future .
recent findings the development of rt - fmri - nf has been used to promote self - regulation of activity in several brain regions and networks .
in addition , and unlike other noninvasive techniques , rt - fmri - nf can access specific subcortical regions and in principle any region that can be monitored using fmri including the cerebellum , brainstem and spinal cord .
in parkinson 's disease and stroke , rt - fmri - nf has been demonstrated to alter neural activity after the self - regulation training was completed and to modify specific behaviours .
summary future exploitation of rt - fmri - nf could be used to induce neuroplasticity in brain networks that are involved in certain neurological conditions .
however , currently , the use of rt - fmri - nf in randomized , controlled clinical trials is in its infancy .
keywords neurological recovery neuroplasticity parkinson 's disease real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging stroke open - accesstrue introduction over the last quarter of a century , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) has become an important tool for the noninvasive monitoring of neural activity in human participants undertaking a wide range of behaviours and altered neural activity in neurological diseases such as parkinson 's disease ( pd ) and stroke .
fmri measures changes in the blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) signal and thus provides a surrogate measure of neural activity. with the advent of increasingly fast processing tools , it has become possible to measure changes in task - related bold signal , for example during a hand grasp , and thus neural activity of a ' motor task network ' , on a quasireal - time subsecond basis ( more advanced processing of raw data for large network connectivity measures still takes 1 - 5 s in practice ) [ 1 ] .
the real - time representation of brain network activity or connectivity can be relayed to an observer via visual display .
the observer is almost always the investigator and enables better control over experiments , body motion during scanning and updating of fmri data , for example [ 1,2 ] .
a key conceptual switch was to offer the visual representation of the neural activity back to the participant thereby affording him / her feedback of his / her own brain activity .
now the participant is , in principle , able to learn how to regulate complex neural activity in his / her own central nervous system ; in practice , this is often achieved by the participant varying a simplified representation of the complex brain activity pattern such as a virtual thermometer .
the crucial instructional behavioural component of the real - time fmri - based neurofeedback ( rt - fmri - nf ) technique is that the participant is asked to undertake a task such as motor imagery of hand movements in order to vary the thermometer height .
the task he / she undertakes to vary the thermometer height is explicitly contingent on varying the bold signal in a brain target region of interest , localized beforehand by asking the participant to perform real hand grasps in our example here .
this localizer target region , that is a region in the motor network for hand grasps , is often part of the neural network activated in the self - regulation task , in this case motor imagery .
thus , the participant is now able to learn how to self - regulate the bold signal and presumably neural activity in a specific region or network .
since the first demonstrations of rt - fmri - nf at the beginning of the century , there has been an expanding literature describing increasingly elaborate use of rt - fmri - nf , although the fundamental methodology has remained relatively unaltered [ 3 * , 4 - 8 ] .
the range of uses of rt - fmri - nf includes self - regulation of brain regions or networks involved in a number of behavioural repertoires such as emotional control [ 9 - 14 ] , pain control [ 15 ] , auditory and visual performance [ 16 - 19 ] , attention [ 20 ] , memory performance [ 21 - 24 ] , reward [ 25,26 ] and motor control [ 27 - 35 ] in healthy individuals. of particular note , however , is that rt - fmri - nf appears to be differentially effective across different target regions of the brain , for example the extrinsic ( visual ) and intrinsic ( default mode network ) nodes of the cortex [ 36 ] - we will return to this important point .
one important distinction in the implementation of neurofeedback protocols is whether purely to rely on instrumental learning , as in most electroencephalography - neurofeedback studies , or whether to use specific instructions or suggest strategies that participants might employ to achieve self - regulation .
an example of the latter approach would be providing information about the functional role of the target area and suggesting kinaesthetic imagery as a potential strategy in the example of motor cortex upregulation introduced above .
this approach has the advantage of potentially accelerating training , which can be helpful for adherence in patient studies and reducing costs , particularly when using expensive imaging equipment .
its disadvantages are that it may overly constrain participants' strategies - and then actually counteract training success - and restrict target areas to those with a well - documented and circumscribed functional role .
the next deployment of rt - fmri - nf could clearly be directed toward neurological conditions and to developing novel neurorehabilitation strategies , whereby the patient learns to self - regulate brain activity in an injured / disordered region or network .
here , we focus on control of motor execution and motor skill learning to illustrate a translational framework for exploiting rt - fmri - nf in motor neurorehabilitation .
a key initial step is to demonstrate that rt - fmri - nf can lead to regulation of brain regions which are thought to be involved in motor execution and skill learning .
the next step is to demonstrate that learned self - regulation of neural activity leads to a sustained change in brain activity , for example that patients with a brain injury can reactivate injured regions or upregulate other regions to compensate for neuronal damage .
a further important step is to demonstrate that rt - fmri - nf leads to a clinically important change in impaired behaviour such as clinical motor impairment of hand grasping and gait in our illustrated neurological conditions .
there are many design - based , mechanism - based and clinical - based factors that are yet to be addressed in translating the fundamental model of rt - fmri - nf to appropriately designed clinical trials , and we will highlight some important caveats .
box 1 no caption available real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in healthy individuals : modulating blood oxygen level dependent signal in motor - related regions or networks execution of complex movements such as reaching , grasping or locomotion involves a distributed network of brain regions including primary motor cortex ( m1 ) , supplementary motor area ( sma ) , premotor cortex ( pmc ) , parietal cortex , basal ganglia , cerebellum , brainstem and spinal cord [ 37 - 39 ] .
motor performance is optimized by integrating and transforming sensory feedback signals , mainly visual and kinesthetic inputs related to movement preparation and execution , through visual and extrastriate pathways , spinal cord , thalamus and somatosensory cortex ( ssc ) [ 40 - 42 ] .
within these networks , meta - analysis using activation likelihood estimates ( ales ) of learning novel motor skills has highlighted significant roles for dorsal pmc , sma , m1 , ssc , superior parietal lobule ( spl ) , thalamus , and putamen of the basal ganglia and cerebellum [ 43 ] .
thus , on the face of it , applying rt - fmri - nf to regulate neural activity in one or combinations of these regions or the connectivity between regions could enhance motor control , performance and skill learning .
this would be an important first step to facilitate the processes of neuroplasticity , which are thought to operate in highly skilled motor performers and during recovery from brain injury [ 44 - 47 ] .
one approach to choosing the ' correct ' target region ( s ) for rt - fmri - nf might be to contrast the sensorimotor network required for execution and skill learning against a similar network for motor imagery , because this is the preferred method used to date to learn self - regulation of motor execution - related regions [ 27 - 35 ] .
a meta - analysis using ale suggested that motor imagery activates several large clusters spanning over both hemispheres , with considerable overlap with the motor control network described above [ 48 ] .
consistently activated regions during motor imagery include bilateral inferior frontal gyri , precentral gyrus anterior to motor cortex ( i.e. pmc ) , middle frontal gyrus , sma and regions of the anterior insula .
in the parietal lobes , the bilateral spl and supramarginal gyrus were also consistently activated .
subcortical regions included the left putamen ( basal ganglia ) , right thalamus and area vi ( bilateral ) and the vermis of the cerebellum .
however , contrasting ale - based meta - analyses for motor execution and learning with motor imagery highlights a notable absence of consistent m1 activity during motor imagery compared with execution .
this may explain why it has proven difficult to use the m1 as a single target region for learned self - regulation in some rt - fmri - nf paradigms to date [ 27 - 35,49 ] .
improved learned self - regulation has been demonstrated , however , when both ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices are combined targets [ 50 ] .
self - regulation of the bold signal can also be achieved in the ventral pmc with rt - fmri - nf [ 34 ] and , interestingly , the individual rate of learned self - regulation in pmc was linearly related to baseline intracortical facilitation within circuits in m1 ( i.e. in the motor execution network ) measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation [ 51 ] .
this may be a result of the extensive connections between pmc and m1 as self - regulation of pmc as a single target can also lead to increased connectivity in the wider motor imagery network and in particular is related to the initial strength of pmc - parietal cortex connectivity before the rt - fmri - nf training programme [ 31 ] .
the current evidence suggests that using a known single target region involved in motor imagery for rt - fmri - nf can lead to changes in cortical network connectivity , which may also include m1 , even though m1 is not activated robustly by motor imagery per se. in other words , there may be indirect paths to target m1 function and thus motor execution via , for example rt - fmri - nf of pmc [ 52,53,54 *] .
this may have profound impact for the development of rt - fmri - nf protocols for neurological conditions wherein motor cortex or inputs to motor cortex are damaged .
real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in healthy individuals : sustaining brain activity after self - regulation training has stopped in some rt - fmri - nf studies , a single follow - up ' transfer ' session has been conducted at a time point after the neurofeedback sessions to test for sustainable modulation of brain activity .
the transfer session consists of testing the ability to self - regulate a target region but without the feedback component .
four weeks ( 12 sessions ) of rt - fmri - nf resulted in a significant transfer effect after targeting the contralateral and ipsilateral m1 bold signal difference [ 50 ] .
the measure taken to represent sustainable impact of rt - fmri - nf can also be modulation of brain networks using resting - state fmri , wherein sustainable changes were demonstrated one day after the end of self - regulation training [ 55 ] .
finally , when the rt - fmri - nf sessions are followed up with similar behavioural practice ( with no explicit feedback ) for 2 weeks , then sustained changes in motor execution networks can occur compared with no behavioural practice suggesting a possible role of rt - fmri - nf in facilitating motor skill learning - although the performance was only rated subjectively and not by objective means in this case [ 49 ] .
although these initial findings are promising , sustainability of the effects of rt - fmri - nf requires more substantiation in future .
real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in healthy individuals : modulating behaviour in an appropriate manner the current evidence would suggest that rt - fmri - nf based on motor imagery is most effective when it is used to modulate activity ( bold signal ) in target regions outside m1 .
the next challenge is to show that this neurofeedback training ( or neurofeedback - enhanced imagery training ) can result in appropriate changes in behaviour such as motor performance and skill learning in healthy individuals .
upregulation of m1 with rt - fmri - nf did not change simple finger reaction time [ 29 ] .
however , in another study , the degree of upregulation of bold in m1 during motor imagery correlated with motor performance ( pinch force ) [ 28 ] suggesting that subject - by - subject variability in motor imagery abilities ( and ability to change bold per se ) may have an important role in successful changes in motor performance .
upregulation of left ventral pmc bold signal may reduce ipsilateral , intracortical inhibitory drive in m1 , but this neural response to rt - fmri - nf did not transfer to a better response in a visuomotor tracking task [ 51 ] .
upregulation of right pmc bold signal was correlated with the degree of functional interhemispheric pmc - parietal cortex connectivity during motor imagery and right cerebellum to left m1 connectivity during right hand motor execution .
these changes were associated with an increase in maximal finger tapping speed using the right hand [ 31 ] .
when the sma is used as a target region for rt - fmri - nf with motor imagery , the individual ability to upregulate the bold signal in sma was correlated with only a small reduction in motor reaction time [ 35 ] .
therefore , there appear to be rather more complex relationships between rt - fmri - nf and motor performance than merely a simple cause - effect between regulation of the neural target and behaviour .
the neural correlates of rt - fmri - nf - induced changes in appropriate behavioural motor performance require more investigation .
moreover , the role of rt - fmri - nf in enhancing motor skill learning has not been studied to date , beyond subjective self - reporting of improved performance [ 49 ] .
this would seem to be an essential challenge to overcome if rt - fmri - nf is to be used to activate neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery in neurological conditions affecting the motor system .
real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in patients with motor disorders : parkinson 's disease and stroke the evidence for clinical effects of rt - fmri - nf in neurological motor conditions is currently limited to data from small proof - of - principle studies and small randomized trials [ 56 ] .
two small studies have explored the feasibility of rt - fmri - nf in pd. five patients in the early stages of pd ( hoehn and yahr stages i - iii ) were trained in the upregulation of activity in the sma over two sessions , separated by 2 - 6 months [ 57 ] .
as compared with a control group engaged in motor imagery without feedback , the patients in the rt - fmri - nf group achieved higher activation levels , showed improved motor fluidity ( as assessed by finger - tapping speed ) and improved on the motor scale of the unified pd rating scale , a standard scale for the assessment of changes in motor symptoms over time .
because of the long interval between the rt - fmri - nf sessions , patients were instructed to practice their imagery strategies regularly at home .
this requirement for the home - based practice highlights one of the challenges - as well as opportunities - of rt - fmri - nf ; because of the cost and availability of the equipment , only a relatively small number of sessions will be available , which entails the need for appropriate ' homework ' and therefore real - life transfer protocols .
a study using a similar protocol in a single patient ( and three healthy volunteers ) confirmed feasibility of upregulation of sma although responses on a sequenced motor task were slower after the training [ 58 ] .
larger studies with combinations of quantitative motor assessments and standardized clinical scales are clearly needed .
one open question is whether upregulation of the sma is the most appropriate protocol for pd. although some studies have reported hypoactivation of sma in pd , others have reported hyperactivation , and regional differences in activation have been observed within the sma itself [ 56 ] .
further work , looking at the stage - dependence ( and state - dependence ) of sma activation patterns and intraarea differences , may therefore be needed in order to inform the selection of targets for self - regulation training in pd. it may be the case that the optimal protocol selection will vary across stages of the disease .
beyond the choice of the ' correct ' target area ( or subregion ) , other parameters that can be varied include the level of desired upregulation and the multivariate activation pattern .
furthermore , the choice of target area can be influenced by the mechanistic model of the intervention .
in the case of pd , one might aim to influence the regions most directly affected by the pathophysiological process , such as the substantia nigra [ 26 ] , or circuits that potentially support compensatory mechanisms [ 59 ] .
in stroke , unlike pd , the lesion ( s ) that leads to motor impairment may occur in a variety of cortical and / or subcortical regions and brainstem and may vary in size .
thus , the choice of neural targets for rt - fmri - nf in order to improve motor impairment becomes more difficult .
nevertheless , there are proof - of - principle studies using rt - fmri - nf in stroke recovery .
two chronic subcortical stroke patients with only mild upper limb motor impairment ( fugl - meyer scores of 55 / 66 and 60 / 66 , where a score of 66 is full use of the upper limb ) were trained over three sessions per day for 3 days with rt - fmri - nf using self - chosen strategies to upregulate bold signal in the ventral pmc .
the stroke patients were able to upregulate ventral pmc to a similar degree as healthy individuals and upregulation persisted during an fmri task of motor imagery without feedback immediately after training although visuomotor tracking behaviour was not consistently improved [ 51 ] .
in another small feasibility study , four moderate - to - severe upper limb motor - impaired patients with cortical or cortical and subcortical first - ever stroke lesions ( fugl - meyer scores of 13 - 28 / 66 ) undertook motor imagery - based rt - fmri - nf focussing on imagining movement in the affected hand [ 60 ] .
the target in this case was ipsilesional primary motor cortico - thalamic connectivity measures rather than the single neural target approach of , for example , the pmc .
three from four patients were able to upregulate ipsilesional cortical - subcortical connectivity successfully and maintain the effect , while imagining without feedback immediately after the last rt - fmri - nf training session .
there were no behavioural performance measures undertaken , and there were no clinical outcome measures employed post rt - fmri - nf training to test for clinically significant improvements .
the largest study using real - time neurofeedback in stroke recovery used an alternative but conceptually similar method to fmri , namely , near - infra red spectroscopy ( fnirs ) for relaying feedback of task - related regional hemodynamic changes in oxygenated hemoglobin [ 61,62 *] .
patients were at least 12 weeks post their first - ever stroke with moderate - to - severe motor impairment ( an average fugl - meyer score of 21 ) .
the pmc was used as a single neural target region for rt - fnirs - nf over six sessions of 20 min of imagery of distal hand / finger motor tasks over 2 weeks .
the 10 stroke patients who received ' real ' neurofeedback of ipsilesional pmc activation during imagery could significantly upregulate the oxygenated hemoglobin signal , whereas the 10 patients receiving ' sham ' neurofeedback ( irrelevant randomized visual signals ) did not .
importantly , the level of rt - fnirs - nf induced activation in pmc was correlated with an improvement in the finger ( distal ) subscale of the fugl - meyer score , but not the more proximal subscale suggesting an imagery task - related relationship between rt - fnirs - nf and clinical improvements .
taken together , the preliminary evidence suggests that rt - fmri - nf may be useful in improving clinical measures of motor impairment in stroke recovery .
the neural mechanisms of action and long - term retention of self - regulated regions or networks involved in stroke recovery remain to be explored .
remaining challenges and future questions choosing the ' correct ' target region or connection for rt - fmri - nf will likely differ between different neurological motor conditions .
a framework for considering possible targets might be enhanced by considering each condition as a ' network ' problem .
recent studies have analyzed network connectivity on a brain - wide level in pd patients and correlated motor symptoms to path - specific hypoactivity and hyper involving basal ganglia , sma and wider fronto - parietal networks [ 63 - 65 ] .
similarly , in stroke , there is now ample evidence to demonstrate that a focal lesion can lead to disruption of connectivity across the motor execution network and indeed beyond [ 45,66 - 68 ] .
this has led to rethinking how to improve motor function by ( re ) activating higher motor targets that can then either impact on the damaged connections and / or enhance healthy regions in order to compensate behaviour in the light of established damage [ 52,53,54 * , 57,62 *] .
thus far , we have assumed that the ' core ' network for self - regulation of brain activity is operative both in pd and stroke .
a recent meta - analysis of rt - fmri - nf to date suggested that this core network involved in rt - fmri - nf independent of target region included mainly the anterior insula and basal ganglia [ 69 ] .
if either or both of these regions are impacted by pd or stroke , then success in using rt - fmri - nf might be compromised .
likewise , motor imagery is a common behavioural tool with which to self - regulate brain regions especially in the motor network .
it is known that motor imagery can be disrupted or become chaotic after a stroke and pd [ 70 - 72 ] and that poor motor imagery vividness is associated with lesions in the left putamen ( i.e. basal ganglia ) , left ventral pmc and long association fibers linking parieto - occipital regions with the dorsolateral premotor and prefrontal areas [ 73 ] .
furthermore , while motor execution network connectivity can recover in well - recovered stroke patients , the motor imagery network connectivity may not always recover in synchrony [ 74 ] .
thus , motor imagery brain networks may be disrupted in motor conditions and this might impact on the effectiveness of using motor imagery as a tool in rt - fmri - nf. on the contrary , there is some promising evidence suggesting that rt - fmri - nf can lead to self - regulation of brain activity in both pd [ 57 ] and stroke [ 60,62 *] .
conclusion neurofeedback using fmri or other neurovascular techniques has good conceptual validity for neurorehabilitation , because it can support the internal activation of compensatory processes and may aid the restitution of damaged brain tissue but its evaluation is still in its infancy .
both mechanistic and clinical studies are needed to evaluate the potential of neurofeedback to promote neuroplasticity and aid functional recovery .
studies should also evaluate whether neurofeedback in one domain , for example targeting motor networks , may have associated benefits in other domains , for example on cognitive functions or vice versa [ 75 ] .
ultimately , any clinical application will have to integrate neurofeedback into a wider framework of neurorehabilitation interventions .
if evidence for clinical efficacy can be provided , then the next challenge will be to justify the costs of neurofeedback , especially for protocols based on the relatively costly fmri technique , but in view of the considerable socioeconomic and healthcare costs of pd [ 76 ] , stroke [ 77 ] and other motor disorders , this may be feasible .

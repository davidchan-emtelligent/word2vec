currently , no prognostic factors exist for determining the host immune status of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) patients .
therefore , the present report analyzed cluster of differentiation 14 ( cd14 )+ human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) - drlow / - myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdsc ) from 49 cll patients and demonstrated that these cells were significantly expanded in all cll patients when compared with monoclonal b cell lymphocytosis patients and healthy volunteers .
furthermore , upregulation of cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs was correlated with cll tumor progression and a poor prognosis for cll patients , and cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs were significantly correlated with the presence of cd4 + t and cd5 + cd19 + cells in cll patients , which could significantly inhibit the cd4 + t - cell immune response , contributing to cll cell progression in cll patients .
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cd14 + hla - drlow / - prognostic factor introduction significant progress has been made in the development of prognostic factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) , which is difficult to predict using clinical parameters , as some patients exhibit indolent disease for decades while others suffer from rapid progression of the disease and require early treatment ( 1 ) .
furthermore , the development of cll is associated with immune suppression in the host , which contributes to the failure to mount an effective immune response against the cancer cells ( 2 ) ; however , no prognostic factors for indicating the host immune status of cll patients exist at present .
myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) , a subset of t cells , are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells with immunosuppressive function .
therefore , the presence of mdscs in the tumor microenvironment has been widely investigated ( 3 ) .
previously , a novel population of mdscs , termed cluster of differentiation 14 ( cd14 )+ human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) - drlow / - mdscs , were identified in melanoma , hepatocarcinoma and b - cell non - hodgkin lymphoma patients ( 4 - 6 ) , indicating that low or lacking hla - dr expression is associated with a cd14 + cell subset , which is highly suppressive of lymphocyte function .
therefore , the present study analyzed cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs from 49 cll patients , monoclonal b - cell lymphocytosis ( mbl ) patients and healthy volunteers .
furthermore , the correlation between cll patient survival and cd14 + hla - drlow / - expression was also investigated .
patients and methods patients peripheral blood samples were collected from 49 untreated cll patients ( males , 34 ; females , 15 ; mean age , 63 years ; age range , 50 - 85 years ) and 23 mbl patients ( males , 18 ; females , 5 ; mean age , 67 years ; age range , 54 - 86 years ) who met the world health organization diagnostic criteria for cll and mbl ( 7 ) , as well as 21 age - matched healthy controls ( males , 15 ; females , 6 ; mean age , 57 years ; age range , 48 - 65 years ) .
the mbl patients were screened from a cohort of healthy adults from the general population with normal peripheral blood lymphocyte counts using the sensitive technique of multicolor flow cytometry .
individuals with abnormal peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were denoted as mbl cases and the remainder were classified as controls .
any individuals with immune or chronic infectious diseases were excluded from the present study. of the 49 cll patients , 12 , 18 , 13 and six were classified as stages i , ii , iii and iv , respectively , based on the rai staging criteria ( 8 ) .
all patients provided informed consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and the study was approved by the zhejiang province people 's hospital review board ( hanzhou , china ) .
flow cytometry for flow cytometry diagnosis and prognosis of the cll patients , the following mouse anti - human monoclonal antibodies ( moabs ) , labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) , phycoerythrin ( pe ) , allophycocyanin ( apc ) and peridinin chlorophyll - a protein ( percp ) were used : cd5 ( cat. no. a07710 ) , cd10 ( cat. no. a07708 ) , cd19 ( cat. no. a07708 ) , cd20 ( cat. no. a07708 ) , cd22 ( cat. no. im0779u ) , cd23 ( cat. no. a07710 ) , cd38 ( cat. no. a07778 ) , cd79a ( cat. no. a07705 ) , flinders medical centre ( fmc - 7 ; cat. no. a07791 ) , kappa ( cat. no. a07706 ) , lambda ( cat. no .
a07706 ) and zeta - chain - associated protein kinase - 70 ( zap - 70 ; cat. no. 731902 ) .
for the lymphocyte subset analyzed , the following mouse anti - human moabs labeled with fitc , pe , apc and percp were used : cd3 ( cat. no. 6607013 ) , cd4 ( cat. no. a07751 ) , cd8 ( cat. no. 6607013 ) , cd14 ( cat. no. 6603262 ) , cd16 ( cat. no. 6607073 ) , cd19 ( cat. no. 6607073 ) , cd25 ( cat. no. im0478u ) , cd56 ( cat. no. 6607073 ) , cd127 ( cat. no. im1980u ) and hla - dr ( cat. no. im0463u ) .
all of the abovementioned products were purchased from immunotech ( marseille , france ) .
cells stained with separate antibodies were defined as cd3 + t cells ( cd3 +) , cd4 + t cells ( cd3 + cd4 +) , cd8 + t cells ( cd3 + cd8 +) , regulatory t cells ( treg cells ; cd4 + cd25highcd127low t helper ) , b cells ( cd3 - cd19 +) , natural killer ( nk ; cd3 - cd16 + cd56 +) , mdscs ( cd14 + hla - drlow / - ) and cd5 + cd19 + cells .
cd38 and cytoplasmic zap - 70 expression were analyzed within the cd19 + cd5 + lymphocytes .
additionally , the expression the signal transduction molecule zap - 70 was provided as the percentage of mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) of the gated events , and regarded as high when > 20 % .
the expression of cd38 was also provided as a percentage of the mfi of the gated events , and was regarded as high when > 30 % .
immunoglobulin heavy chain ( ighv ) gene mutation the ighv gene mutation status of the cd19 + cd5 + cells of all patients was assessed as previously described ( 9 ) .
briefly , igvh gene mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction and specific primers ( cat. no .
5 - 101 - 0010 ) , using the igh somatic hypermutation assay for gel detection kit ( invivoscribe technologies , inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
sequences exhibiting < 98 % homology with the corresponding germline ighv genes were considered to be mutated .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism software ( version 5.01 ; graphpad software , inc. , la jolla , ca , usa ) and the following statistical tests were performed : the log - rank test , the mann whitney u test and spearman 's rank correlation .
in addition , quantitative data are presented as the mean +/ - standard deviation .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 were considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
results correlation between cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc upregulation and cll tumor progression analysis of the frequency of cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc cells in 49 cll , 23 mbl and 21 control cases revealed that the frequency of cd14 + hla - drlow / - cells was significantly elevated in cll patients compared with mbl and control cases ( fig. 1a and b ) , where mbl is a condition that resembles cll but does not meet all of the criteria for cll ( 10 ) .
the clinicopathological data of the studied patients and control cases , including the number of subjects , median age , gender , rai stage , ighv mutation status , cd38 status and zap - 70 status , were recorded ( table i ) .
furthermore , statistical analyses revealed that cd14 + hla - drlow / - cells were significantly associated with the clinical stage of disease in cll patients ( fig. 1c ) , indicating that these cells may participate in the progression of cll .
cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc and poor prognosis for cll patients most notably , the present study identified that the overall survival time in cll patients whose samples were obtained prior to the administration of any therapy ( n = 49 ) was significantly different between those exhibiting low and high cd14 + hla - drlow / - expression levels , and that cd14 + hla - drlow / - expression was inversely correlated with survival time ( p < 0.0001 ; fig. 2a ) .
furthermore , 15 patients in the high cd14 + hla - drlow / - expression group ( n = 24 ; > 40 % cd14 + monocytes ) and three patients in the low expression group ( n = 25 ; < 40 % cd14 + monocytes ) succumbed to cll within four years , indicating that cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs may be a prognostic factor in cll patients .
cd38 , zap - 70 and the ighv gene are typical immunophenotypic and genetic prognostic markers ( 11,12 ) , which have previously been used to predict the survival of cll patients in the clinic .
firstly , when comparing cll patients grouped according to cd38 expression , cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc levels in cd38low and cd38high cll patients were significantly higher compared with the control group ( both p < 0.0001 ) .
in addition , the cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc count was significantly higher in the cd38high subgroup compared with the cd38low subgroup ( p = 0.0335 ; fig. 2b ) , the cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc frequency was significantly elevated in the zap - 70low and zap - 70high cll patients when compared with the control group ( both p < 0.0001 ) , and was significantly higher in the zap - 70high subgroup compared with zap - 70low subgroup ( p = 0.0003 ) ( fig. 2c ) .
following data analysis based on the mutational status of ighv , a similar frequency pattern was observed : the frequency of cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs was significantly higher in the ighv - unmutated ( u - cll ) and ighv - mutated ( m - cll ) cll patients when compared with the control ( both p < 0.0001 ) , and these mdscs were significantly more elevated in the u - cll patients compared with the m - cll patients ( p = 0.0019 ) ( fig. 2d ) .
furthermore , when patients were divided based on combinations of good ( m - cll / cd38low ) or poor ( u - cll / cd38high ) prognosis markers , the m - cll / cd38low and u - cll / cd38high subgroups of patients exhibited significantly higher cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc frequency compared with the controls ( both p < 0.0001 ) , and the cd14 + hla - drlow / - frequency in the u - cll / cd38high subgroup was higher than in the m - cll / cd38low subgroup ( p = 0.0052 ) ( fig. 2e ) .
in the present study , it was identified that cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs are associated with cd38 and zap - 70 expression , as well as ighv mutations .
thus , cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs may be prognostic factors in cll patients .
cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs predominantly inhibit the cd4 + t - cell response during cll disease progression as previously established , mdscs suppress immunity by disrupting the innate and adaptive immune responses ( 3 ) .
in the present study , the frequency of various lymphocyte subsets were assessed , and it was identified that the frequency of cd3 + t , cd4 + t , cd8 + t and nk cells in cll patients were significantly reduced compared with in the mbl patients and the control group ( table ii ). by contrast , b , treg and cd19 + cd5 + cells were significantly elevated in cll patients compared with mbl patients and the control group ( table ii ) .
furthermore , spearman 's correlation analysis revealed that cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs were significantly positively correlated with cd19 + cd5 + cells ( fig. 3a ) and negatively correlated with the cd4 + t cells ( fig. 3b ) ; however , no significant correlation was identified with cd3 + t , b , treg or nk cells ( data not shown ) .
data obtained in the present study was inconsistent with previous reports , which described mdscs as potent inducers of treg cells in liver cancer patients ( 4 ) .
however , in general , cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs appear to disturb systemic immunity during cll disease progression , predominantly by inhibiting the cd4 + t - cell response .
additionally , no correlation was identified between cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs , and age , serum hemoglobin concentration , platelet and white blood cell count , rai stage and lymphocytosis ( data not shown ) .
discussion currently , the use of clinical , biological and genetic parameters allows cll patients to be diagnosed and characterized with a mild , intermediate or aggressive onset and prognosis of this heterogeneous disease ( 13 ) .
however , excepting allogeneic stem cell transplantation , there is no curative treatment available for cll patients , possibly due to cll patients exhibiting a defective immune antitumor response .
furthermore , in individuals with established cll , mdscs are likely to be a major factor in reducing the efficacy of therapeutic treatment strategies , which require an immunocompetent host ( 14 ) .
therefore , improved understanding of the immune status of individual cll patients may be useful for determining which patients may exhibit indolent disease for a number of decades , and which patients may progress rapidly and require early treatment .
in addition , the elimination of mdscs is a priority for cll patients who are candidates for active immunotherapy .
presently , there is a requirement to monitor the number of immunosuppressive cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs (> 40 % cd14 + monocytes ) in cll patients , as the survival time from diagnosis is currently < 3 years .
however , additional multivariate statistical analysis with other prognostic factors in long - term multicenter studies should initially be performed to clarify the observations of the current study , as the follow - up period of cll patients in the present study was only conducted for ~ 4 years .
furthermore , the specific immunosuppressive function of cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs in cll patients requires further investigation .
in conclusion , to the best of our knowledge , the present study reports for the first time a population of immunosuppressive monocytes , characterized by the cd14 + hla - drlow / - phenotype , which were significantly elevated in cll patients and were poor predictors of survival in cll patients ( n = 49 ) .
in addition , these cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs were associated with the prognostic factors cd38 , zap - 70 and ighv .
finally , spearman 's correlation analysis revealed that the poor survival of upregulated cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdsc cll patients predominantly occurred via the inhibition of the cd4 + t - cell response , resulting in a dysregulation of the balance of t - cell subsets in vivo , including significant proliferation of cd5 + cd19 + cells in cll patients .
thus , cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs may be used as a novel prognostic marker for the survival of cll patients and eliminating cd14 + hla - drlow / - mdscs may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of cll patients .

[ 1 ] proposed a unified genetic theory of sporadic and inherited autism spectrum disorders to explain the complex familial patterns observed .
the model explains why most families have a low risk of autistic children with an overall incidence rate of approximately 1 in 150 births , but a small minority of families have a 50 % risk for male offspring .
their model links these two risk classes by their genetic origins : sporadic autism in low - risk families is mainly caused by highly penetrant spontaneous mutations in autism - related genes , whereas inherited autism in high risk families is mainly caused by unaffected parents carrying a causative mutation that is transmitted in a dominant fashion to their offspring .
the evidence for the model was based on the available genotyping assays that showed an elevated rate of de novo copy number variants ( cnvs ) in children with autism spectrum disorders .
since then , we and other collaborators have been following up with a high - resolution exome sequencing study of 2,800 families from the simons simplex collection to pinpoint the genetic components of the disorder .
unlike the early studies that could only detect large copy number events spanning tens or hundreds of thousands of basepairs across multiple genes , our new study has power to examine single nucleotide and indel mutations within individual genes. from our preliminary analysis of approximately 350 of these families [ 2 ] , as well as the reports of three other groups , we have collected strong evidence for the role of'likely gene - disrupting '( lgd ) mutations ( nonsense , splice site and frame shifts ) , with affected individuals having twice as many lgds compared to unaffected siblings , and five ' double hit ' genes ( chd8 , dyrk1a , katnal2 , pogz , scn2a ) having two de novo mutations in unrelated individuals. from this analysis , we estimate approximately 400 genes are targets of autism spectrum disorders .
interestingly , from the gene set we have already identified , we have discovered a strong association between the targets lgd mutations in autism and in vivo targets of the rna - binding translational regulator fmrp ( encoded by fmr1 ) , which results in fragile x syndrome when silenced or mutated .
the large number of samples in the study necessitated that we develop a high performance parallel sequence analysis pipeline that could scale to the large volume of data and make use of local disk storage .
we were able to make use of several existing tools for the preliminary analysis ( bwa , samtools , gatk , etc ) , and we also developed additional components for genotyping within a family and across the population using a multinomial statistical approach .
this includes a novel sequence analysis algorithm for discovering insertion & deletion variants using a localized sequence assembly approach that is superior to standard mapping algorithms .
we continue to refine the algorithms to improve scalability , sensitivity , and specificity , and are beginning to apply it towards analyzing the genomes of families with other complex cognitive disorders .

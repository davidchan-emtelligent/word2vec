background the 15q11 - q13 region contains many low copy repeats and is well known for its genomic instability .
several syndromes are associated with genomic imbalance or copy - number - neutral uniparental disomy .
we report on two patients : patient 1 is a boy with developmental delay and autism ; and patient 2 is a girl with developmental delay , hypotonia and dysmorphism .
we performed analyses to delineate their dosage in the 15q region , determine whether the patients' dosage correlates with phenotypic severity , and whether genes in the amplified regions are significantly associated with identified functional networks .
results for the proximal region of 15q , molecular cytogenetic analysis with agilent oligonucleotide array showed a copy number of 3 for patient 1 and a copy number of 4 for patient 2 .
fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of patient 2 showed two different populations of cells with different marker chromosomes .
methylation analysis of the amplified region showed that the extra copies of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide n gene were of maternal origin .
phenotypic severity did not correlate with the size and dosage of 15q , or whether the amplification is interstitial or in the form of a supernumerary marker .
pathway analysis showed that in patient 2 , the main functional networks that are affected by the genes from the duplicated / triplicated regions are developmental disorder , neurological disease and hereditary disease .
conclusions the 15q11 - q13 gains that were found in both patients could explain their phenotypic presentations .
this report expands the cohort of patients for which 15q11 - q13 duplications are molecularly characterized .
15q duplication syndrome array comparative genomic hybridization ( acgh ) copy number gain autism developmental delay fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) marker chromosome background the 15q11 - q13 region is a hotspot for recombination .
several breakpoint ( bp ) regions have clusters that contain low copy repeats and segmental duplications [ 1 ] .
chiasmata frequency in the region is known to be higher than in other chromosomal regions [ 2 ] .
as a consequence , the region is prone to having deletions , duplications and rearrangements .
in addition to frequent genomic rearrangements , this chromosomal region is also highly regulated by methylation , and the allele that is expressed for specific genes is based on the parental origin of the chromosome .
the presence of imprinted genes in this region means that there may be phenotypic consequences even if the rearrangements are copy number neutral and results in no genomic imbalance .
genomic disorders mapped to this region include angelman syndrome ( online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) # 105830 ) and prader - willi syndrome ( omim # 176270 ) .
in the majority of cases , both of the syndromes are due to either deletion or uniparental disomy. of the remaining cases of angelman syndrome , approximately 10 - 15 % are due to ube3a mutations and 2 - 4 % are due to imprinting centre defect .
less than 1 % of the remaining prader - willi syndrome cases are due to imprinting centre defect [ 3 ] .
cytogenetically visible duplications ( omim # 608636 ) and marker chromosomes from derivatives of this region are also common .
the high frequency of such cases gave rise to a clinically recognizable disorder called 15q duplication syndrome , with some common neurobehavioural phenotypes [ 4 ] .
copy numbers of three , four , five and six have all been reported for this region [ 5 - 7 ] .
most copy number gains in this region are due to translocations , inversions and supernumerary marker chromosomes ( ssmc ) .
interstitial duplications / triplications and balanced translocations ( which do not result in copy number changes ) are more infrequent [ 8 ] .
to add to the clinical phenotype of 15q duplication cases , we present two patients - a malay boy with partial trisomy 15q and a chinese girl with mosaic partial tetrasomy 15q .
we conducted analyses to delineate their amplification in the 15q region , analyze the region at the gene level , and determine whether genes within the amplified regions are significantly associated with identified functional networks .
presentation of cases the two patients described in this study were participants in a study to identify genomic imbalance in patients with developmental delay / multiple congenital anomalies .
they were recruited from the genetics outpatient clinics of the kk women 's and children 's hospital , singapore .
the study was approved by the singhealth institutional review board , which oversees all research studies in the hospital .
the patients were recruited with the written informed consent of their parents .
patient 1 is the 6th child of healthy , unrelated parents of malay ancestry .
his mother was 33 years old at the time of his birth .
he has an older brother with autism spectrum disorder , but four other siblings are phenotypically normal .
he was delivered at full term with a birth weight of 2950 g and there were no perinatal issues .
he first presented at 5 years and 8 months of age with severe language delay , hyperactivity and a preoccupation with water .
his verbal language was limited to the repetition of a few words and pointing for needs .
his teachers reported that it was difficult to engage him in his pre - school activities .
he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual impairment .
clinical examination revealed a well thrived child with no dysmorphic features .
fragile x testing result was normal .
the second patient was a girl of chinese descent born at 39 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3234 g , length of 45.5 cm and head circumference of 32 cm. her apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were both 9 .
she is the third child of a non - consanguineous marriage with no family history of autism or learning impairment .
her mother was 28 years old and her father 29 years old at the time of her birth .
she was first noted to have gross motor delay at 9 months of age .
the initial investigations , including a thyroid function test and metabolic screen , were normal .
on further review , she continued to have significant developmental delay .
at two years of age , she was able to walk with support and she spoke no clear words .
assessment using the age and states questionnaire , third edition , showed normal scores for fine motor and personal - social skills , and a borderline score in communication skills .
the patient had significant delays in gross motor and problem - solving skills .
on physical examination , her height and weight were at the 90th percentile and her head circumference was at the 97th percentile .
she had truncal hypotonia and pigmentation , irregular pigmentation on her lower limbs , protruding tongue and hypertelorism , but no other dysmorphic features .
chromosome culture revealed an abnormal female karyotype , with two cell lines that showed a different additional marker chromosome in each cell line .
results karyotype analysis karyotype information on patient 1 was unavailable .
for patient 2 , karyotype is reported as 47,xx ,+ mar.ish del ( 15 )( q12 )( snrpn + , d15z1 +)[ 14 ]/ 47,xx ,+ mar.ish psu dic ( 15 ; 15 )( snrpn ++ , d15z1 ++) [ 4 ] .
two different markers were identified .
the larger marker chromosome was found in 14 out of 18 metaphases analyzed .
fluorescent in situ hybridization ( fish ) analysis showed two centromeric 15 signals ( d15z1 ) and two signals localized to snrpn on this marker chromosome ( figure 1a ) .
a smaller marker chromosome was found in the other 4 metaphases .
fish analysis on this smaller marker chromosome showed one centromeric 15 signal and one signal localized to snrpn ( figure 1b ) .
hence , cytogenetic and fish analysis showed that this patient is mosaic for the two marker chromosomes , with 14 out of 18 cells harboring the marker chromosome with two copies of proximal 15q and the remaining 4 cells harboring the marker chromosome with one copy of proximal 15q , corresponding to partial tetrasomy and partial trisomy 15q .

( a ) 2 green and 2 red hybridization signals were seen on the larger marker corresponding to centromeric 15 ( d15z1 ) and snrpn respectively ( b ) 1 green and 1 red hybridization signals were seen on the smaller marker corresponding to centromeric 15 ( d15z1 ) and snrpn respectively ( abbreviations : fish : fluorescent in situ hybridization , snrpn : small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide n ) .
array - based copy number analysis for patient 1 , analysis showed a gain in copy number from 21,213,950 to 26,208,646 , involving 710 probes with a mean log2 ratio of 0.5585 for the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 15 ( figure 2a ) .
for patient 2 , the gain was from 18,362,555 to 26,208,646 , involving 865 probes with mean log2 ratio of 1.0239 ( figure 2b ). from the position of the probes , the estimated minimum size of the gain for patient 1 was 4,994,696 basepairs ( bp ) while the maximum size was 6,045,492 bp. for patient 2 , the minimum size for the gain was 7,846,091 bp. the maximum size could not be determined as the gain started from the first probe for the chromosome .
the list of known genes in the amplified region is shown in table 1 .

discussion although duplications that involve the proximal region of 15q are one of the most common rearrangements in pediatric patients with congenital disorders , only a few megabase cases have been mapped by molecular karyotyping or analyzed at the gene level. of the duplications identified by molecular methods , the sizes ranged from about 1 million base - pairs ( mb ) in a multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification study [ 9 ] to 17.7 mb using cgh arrays with 244 k oligonucleotide probes [ 10 ] .
a few large studies have found recurrent microdeletions or duplications in the 15q11 - q13 region for idiopathic epilepsies , autism , and combined schizophrenia and epilepsy [ 11 - 16 ] .
there is another relevant region for psychiatric disorders that is more distal , with chrna7 ( cholinergic receptor , nicotinic subunit alpha 7 ) within the bp4 - bp5 region as the top candidate gene [ 17 - 19 ] .
in a large study using published data sets , the frequency of 15q duplications is reported to be 1:494 for autism cohorts and 1:508 for clinical cohorts with intellectual disability , asd , or multiple congenital anomalies [ 20 ] .
the two patients with 15q duplication / triplication in this report were from 350 cases with developmental delay and / or multiple congenital anomalies who were prospectively recruited into our array - cgh study .
the gains in the two patients had different proximal breakpoints .
they appeared to share the same distal breakpoint , which is within a segmental duplication that corresponds to the bp3 region , ending after the last three exons of the herc2 ( hect domain and rcc1 - like domain 2 ) which are duplicated .
no karyotype data was available for patient 1 , who has class ii duplication [ 21 ] .
the duplication is likely to be an interstitial microduplication with the proximal breakpoint located within bp2 .
the first duplicated sequence with potential function is microrna 4508 ( gain of one copy ) .
at least 14 genes are in the duplicated region ( 13 omim genes and 8 omim morbid genes ) .
the first gene duplicated is mkrn3 ( makorin ring finger protein 3 ) .
the triplication in patient 2 is in the form of an ssmc .
we could not ascertain the start of the copy number gain as there was no array - cgh probe for 15p and the gain started before the recognized bp1 region and the first known gene ( chek2p2 ) , which is a pseudogene on 15q .
if it was interstitial and the start was near the first array cgh probe , it would be a class i duplication [ 21 ] with the proximal and distal breakpoints within bp1 and bp3 , respectively .
alternatively , it could involve the whole p arm .
array - cgh did not detect any other genomic imbalance for this patient .
the gain involves at least 22 genes out of which 18 are omim genes and 9 are omim morbid genes ( table 1 ) .
at least three genes within this region ( nipa1 , nipa2 , cyfip1 ) are implicated in the development of the central nervous system while a fourth gene , tubgcp5 , is a member of the cytoskeleton tubulin complex in cells and is evolutionarily conserved [ 22 ] .
although parental samples were not available for both patients , qrt - pcr analysis using primers which are specific for methylation states showed that the extra chromosomal material for both patients had methylation pattern that implied gains of maternal origin .
this is consistent with the maternal origin of such duplications being more common , and with such duplications being more likely to have pathogenic consequences .
gain in copy number of maternally - derived snrpn has been associated with autism [ 22 ] , but patient 2 had not presented with such features .
one notable feature is that her physical dimensions were above the 90th percentile .
overgrowth has been reported in patients with an increased dosage of distal 15q [ 23 ] , but this patient 's copy number gain does not involve the distal 15q region .
for the two patients in this report , phenotypic severity did not correlate with the size and dosage of the distal breakpoint on 15q , and whether the duplication is interstitial or in the form of an ssmc .
this lack of correlation could be due to additional factors such as presence of mosaicism in patient 2 , genetic background , epigenetic modifications , and gender .
aside from the increase in gene dosage and the parental origin of the duplicated genes , additional alterations at the epigenetic level could influence gene expression , which could lead to phenotypic variability for patients who carry duplications of the same size and dosage [ 21,24 ] .
hogart et al. provided some supporting evidence when they measured the level of 10 transcripts within the 15q11 - 13 region in two postmortem brains and found that the expression pattern correlated with parental gene dosage in the male patient .
in the female brain , there was decreased expression of snrpn , ndn , small nuclear rnas ( snornas ) and gamma - aminobutyric acide ( gaba ) a despite an increased dosage of genes of maternal origin [ 25 ] .
in the case of snrpn , the decreased expression was consistent with the finding of increased methylation found at the imprinting control region .
mosaicism is common in 15q duplications that involve supernumerary derivative chromosome 15 .
such duplications tend to take the form of pseudodicentric derivative chromosomes rather than intrachromosomal .
the pseudodicentric marker chromosome , psu dic ( 15 ; 15 ) , is usually formed by a homologous recombination between two chromosomes 15 [ 26 ] .
the smaller marker chromosome in patient 2 is likely to be the result of a break in the psu dic ( 15 ; 15 ) , before the inactivation of one centromere which occurred during the anaphase stage of mitosis .
the break would also have resulted in the loss of one of the two duplicated regions in some cells , giving rise to the mosaicism observed .
as karyotype analysis was only done for cells from peripheral blood culture , the ratio of the two marker chromosomes in other tissues is not known .
at the time of the blood sampling for genetic investigation , the patient was only 9 months old .
due to the young age when the chromosomal studies were done and the lack of data on the mosaicism level in other tissues , it is difficult to predict the course of disease manifestation and make genotype - phenotype correlation [ 27 ] .
genetic analysis determined that the genes within the regions that were duplicated in one or both of the patients are significantly associated with identified functional networks .
the top three functional networks based on levels of statistical significance are developmental disorder , hereditary disorder , and neurological disease .
the important genes that are involved in developmental and neurological disorders are gabra5 , gabra3 , gabrg3 , magel2 , mkrn3 , ndn , snrpn and ube3a .
three of the genes encode subunits of the gaba receptors , a family of ligand - gated chloride channels which mediate the major inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba in the brain .
they have been found to be highly expressed in the cerebral cortex of postmortem brain samples [ 28 ] .
one study found that duplications that involve this gaba gene cluster are highly enriched in an autism cohort , while another study found no difference from controls [ 16,29 ] .
the imprinted gene ube3a functions as a transcriptional co - activator and also as a ligase in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway .
snrpn also has dual functions .
it is involved in rna processing and is also spliced into several regulatory rnas .
the remaining three genes are causative of prader - willi syndrome if a deletion or mutation is of paternal origin .
all are intronless , transcribed only from paternal alleles and are involved in growth regulation or transcription .
in addition , there are a number of c / d box snornas which occur in multiple tandem copies [ 30 ] .
these include the snord 115 ( hbii - 52 ) , snord 116 ( hbii - 85 ) and snord 109a ( hbii - 438a ) clusters .
they are involved in directing alternative splicing or site - specific methylation of substrate rnas [ 31,32 ] .
however , it is unclear whether they are important in cases of maternal duplications ( such as the two cases in this report ) as they were reported to be expressed from the paternal chromosome only [ 33 ] .
conclusions we report two new cases of trisomy and mosaic tetrasomy 15q11 - q13 of probable maternal origin from the methylation pattern .
the copy number gain of genes in the region could explain the patients' phenotypic presentations .
pathway analysis identified multiple networks of candidate gene interactions .
reports of additional cases that have overlapping amplifications with different breakpoints would be helpful toward delineating the spectrum of phenotypic features and long - term follow - up for carriers of such amplifications , such as the development of late - onset lennox - gastaut syndrome [ 34 ] and sudden unexplained deaths [ 5 ] .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the parents for the laboratory investigations and publication of the case report .

image analysis was carried out with cytovision software ( version 3.93.2 ) ( applied imaging corp , usa ) .
array - based copy number analysis genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood using the puregene dna isolation kit ( qiagen gmbh , hilden , germany ) .
human cgh array consisting of 400 k 60 - mer oligonucletode probes from agilent ( agilent technologies inc. , santa clara , ca , usa ) - - and the reference used was human genomic dna from promega matched to the gender of the patient ( promega corp. , madison , wi , usa ) .
test dna was labeled with cy5 - dutp and reference dna was labeled with cy3 - dutp ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) according to agilent 's protocol for enzymatic labeling ( version 6.3 ) .
the efficiency of the labeling was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer .
the labeled reference and test dna samples were hybridized to the array at 65degreesc in an agilent hybridization oven for 40 hours , with the rotator set at 20 rotations per minute .
the array was then processed according to the manufacturer 's instructions and scanned with an agilent g2505c microarray scanner at 5 micron resolution .
data were extracted from the scanned image using agilent feature extraction ( version 10.7.31 ) and were analyzed for copy number change using agilent genomic workbench lite ( edition 6.0.130.24 ) .
genomic coordinates are based on genome build 36 / hg18 .
qrt - pcr analysis gene copy number was also investigated by relative qrt - pcr with sybr green dye and snrpn as the target for quantifying copy number .
primers were designed using primer express ( version 3.0 ) , and the experiment was carried out in triplicate .
genomic dna from the two patients and a control participant was amplified in the same experiment using znf80 as the internal reference [ 36 ] .
amplification was done using the applied biosystems steponeplus real time pcr system ( applied biosystems incorporated , foster city , ca , usa ) .
results were analyzed using applied biosystems stepone software ( version 2.1 ) .
methylation analysis methylation status was investigated by treating the dna with sodium bisulfite using the epitect bisulfite kit ( qiagen gmbh , hilden , germany ) , followed by qrt - pcr with separate primers targeting methylated and unmethylated snrpn according to kubota et al .
[ 37 ] .
pathway analysis the coordinates of the minimum deleted region for patient 2 was searched against the human reference genome ( hg18 ) for known genes in the region .
the resulting list of genes was imported into ipa software ( ingenuity systems , inc .
redwood city , ca , usa ) using the entrez id mapped to the ingenuity pathway knowledge base identifier .
the reference set used was ingenuity knowledge base ( genes only ) ; relationship to include was both direct and indirect .
the analysis included endogenous chemicals , and the filter summary was set to consider only relationships in which confidence = experimentally observed .
the statistical significance for the enrichment of genes of interest in each pathway was evaluated using a fisher exact test under the core analysis function of ipa .

background early in the 1990s , it was recognized that lysinibacillus sphaericus , one of the most popular and effective entomopathogenic bacteria , was a highly heterogeneous group .
many authors have even proposed it comprises more than one species , but the lack of phenotypic traits that guarantee an accurate differentiation has not allowed this issue to be clarified .
now that genomic technologies are rapidly advancing , it is possible to address the problem from a whole genome perspective , getting insights into the phylogeny , evolutive history and biology itself .
results the genome of the colombian strain l. sphaericus ot4b.49 was sequenced , assembled and annotated , obtaining 3 chromosomal contigs and no evidence of plasmids .
using these sequences and the 13 other l. sphaericus genomes available on the ncbi database , we carried out comparative genomic analyses that included whole genome alignments , searching for mobile elements , phylogenomic metrics ( tetra , ani and in - silico ddh ) and pan - genome assessments .
the results support the hypothesis about this species as a very heterogeneous group .
the entomopathogenic lineage is actually a single and independent species with 3728 core genes and 2153 accessory genes , whereas each non - toxic strain seems to be a separate species , though without a clear circumscription .
toxin - encoding genes , bina , b and mtx1 , 2 , 3 could be acquired via horizontal gene transfer in a single evolutionary event .
the non - toxic strain ot4b.31 is the most related with the type strain kctc 3346 .
conclusions the current l. sphaericus is actually a sensu lato due to a sub - estimation of diversity accrued using traditional non - genomics based classification strategies .
the toxic lineage is the most studied with regards to its larvicidal activity , which is a greatly conserved trait among these strains and thus , their differentiating feature .
further studies are needed in order to establish a univocal classification of the non - toxic strains that , according to our results , seem to be a paraphyletic group .

isolates of b. thuringiensis and lysinibacillus sphaericus are frequently reported [ 1 ] .
the latter is more active against culex and anopheles spp. and more persistent in polluted aquatic environments than b. thuringiensis var .
israelensis [ 2 , 3 ] .
lysinibacillus sphaericus is a gram - positive and spore - forming bacteria isolated for the first time from fourth - instar larvae of culiseta incidens near fresno , california [ 4 ] .
however , this strain displayed a low level of toxicity [ 5 ] and it was not until the 1970s that the first strains with potential use as mosquito - control agents were discovered [ 6 ] .
in spite of being widely used in biological control programs , not all strains of l. sphaericus are toxic against mosquitoes .
nowadays , it is well known that a plethora of insecticidal toxins are responsible for the entomopathogenic activity of the toxic strains .
binary prototoxin ( bin ) is the major insecticidal protein produced by l. sphaericus ; it is contained inside the parasporal crystal and comprises two proteins : bina ( 42 kda ) and binb ( 51 kda ) .
after being ingested by larva , these proteins are solubilized in the gut and undergo proteolysis to active lower molecular weight derivatives [ 2 , 7 , 8 ] .
other crystal proteins , cry48 and cry49 , might be produced on sporulation by some toxic strains .
these toxins are related to cry toxins of b. thuringiensis and bin family toxins , respectively [ 1 ]. l. sphaericus may also produce insecticidal toxins during vegetative stage ; this is the case of mtx proteins [ 9 , 10 ] whose mode of action remains to be elucidated .
formerly known as bacillus sphaericus , l. sphaericus is characterized by having a spherical terminal spore and by its inability to utilize carbohydrates , except n - acetylglucosamine [ 11 ] .
instead , it uses organic and amino acids as carbon sources [ 5 ] .
this species may be found in soil and aquatic environments and , recently , has gained attention because it has shown outstanding potential for environmental and industrial applications beyond biological control , especially in bioremediation of toxic metals [ 12 - 14 ] , phosphorous solubilization [ 15 ] , among others [ 16 ] .
in 2007 , this species was reclassified to a new genus according to phenotypic traits , mainly based on differences in peptidoglycan composition which includes lysine and aspartic acid instead of meso - diaminopimelic acid , the major component of bacillus cell wall [ 17 ] .
no genomic support to assess this classification was reported until a few years ago , when hu and coworkers investigated the phylogenetic relationship between four toxic and three non - toxic strains .
their findings suggested a new species for insecticidal strains and provided evidence for toxicity evolution by means of horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) [ 18 ] .
however , a more comprehensive analysis is required as the number of available genome sequences has doubled .
therefore , we aimed to perform a broader evaluation of the intraspecific genetic diversity of l. sphaericus as species and as mosquito - control agent .
results a new l. sphaericus genome is now available the genome of l. sphaericus ot4b.49 , a previously isolated colombian strain [ 14 ] , was sequenced using pacific biosciences technology and assembled , obtaining 3 contigs ( 4.6 mbp , 29.6 kbp and 14.9 kbp ) and no evidence of plasmids .
the estimated coverage was 242 x with 981,395,594 bp produced , of which 11,921,224 bp were from circular consensus sequencing ( ccs ) .
moreover , the gc content ( 37.30 %) , predicted genes ( 4486 ) and genome size ( 4.7 mbp ) were expected according to the currently reported genomes .
this newly available genome together with the other 13 l. sphaericus genomes previously uploaded to the ncbi database , were used in the current study ( table 1 ) .

this classification was previously established by ge et al. by associating the presence of toxin genes with mosquitocidal activities of 35 l. sphaericus isolates [ 54 ] bat least one plasmid - associated contig 16s rdna homology cannot differentiate toxic from non - toxic isolates l. sphaericus is generally classified into five dna - homology groups based on the similarity of 16s rdna sequences .
these groups are also related by some phenotypic traits and molecular markers [ 19 ] .
we reconstructed the 16s rdna phylogeny including the 14 l. sphaericus strains herein analyzed and found the same clustering pattern reported in previous studies [ 19 , 20 ] with high bootstrap support .
all the toxic strains are grouped together in the same lineage with some non - toxic strains and , separately , the other non - toxic strains are distributed among the other groups ( fig. 1 ) .
therefore , as it was suggested , only in the view of 16s rdna homology , toxicity does not seem to be appropriate as the sole differentiator [ 21 ] .
however , further analyses revealed high diversity within l. sphaericus and suggested that toxicity is a differentiating feature that could be acquired in a single evolutionary event. fig. 1 phylogenetic tree of round - spored bacilli showing the current 16s rdna - based taxonomy. l. sphaericus strains can be found in three out of the six highlighted homology groups .
all the toxic strains are clustered in the group in purple , however , not all the strains in that group are toxic .
bootstrap values for 500 replicates are shown in the branches toxic strains comprise a nearly clonal and independent lineage with a high degree of synteny we performed comparative genomic analyses which supported the hypothesis of the toxic strains as an independent group within l. sphaericus .
the first evidence came from multiple genome alignments and the evaluation of genomic architectures carried out by gepard [ 22 ] and mauve [ 23 ] softwares .
the toxic strains exhibited strong syntenic relationships , though some rearrangements , mainly duplications , were detected ( fig. 2a ) .
on the other hand , genomes from non - toxic strains showed several differences among them and in comparison to the toxic strains genomes , especially the strain b1 - cda , in which several inversions were identified ( fig. 2b ). fig. 2 whole genome alignments between toxic and non - toxic strains .

b nucleotide - based alignment of the genomes from two toxic ( ot4b.49 and 2362 ) and two non - toxic ( ot4b.31 and b1 - cda ) strains .
homologous blocks are shown as identically colored regions and linked across the genomes .
regions that are inverted relative to l. sphaericus 2362 are shown below the central axis of each sequence an additional whole genome alignment , based on blast , was conducted and visualized using brig [ 24 ] .
the ring image obtained clearly showed the high similarity between the toxic strains and a great heterogeneity when they are compared to the non - toxic ones ( fig. 3 ) .
intriguingly , when this assay was performed with a toxic strain as a reference ( as shown in fig. 3 ) , the divergence pattern among the non - toxic strains was very similar .
this suggests the existence of gene clusters unique for the toxic strains beyond the toxin - encoding genes. fig. 3 circular map that compares genomes of l. sphaericus ot4b.49 , cbam5 , ot4b.31 , and b1 - cda against 2362 .
each circle represents the genome from one strain , and the colored blocks in it represent sequences with > 90 % identity relative to l. sphaericus 2362 .
the gis in the immediacy of encoding toxin genes as well as the origin of replication are spotted .
gc skew is shown in the inner circle hgt might have played a role in toxicity acquisition eleven genomic islands ( gis ) were detected for the strain ot4b.49 .
as reported by hu and coworkers , the identified gis comprise sequences of mobile genetic elements as prophages and transposons , and several recombination - involved proteins as integrase , recombinase , and transposase [ 18 ] .
interestingly , mosquitocidal toxin coding genes are within or in the immediacy of those gis ( fig. 3 ) .
all of the completed genomes from toxic strains were evaluated for gis and , as it was previously hypothesized , all of them have between 7 and 11 gis associated with the toxin genes .
this suggests a role for these mobile large segments of dna in the acquisition of entomopathogenic activity .
the toxic lineage appears to represent a novel species since some researchers have proposed that l. sphaericus could compromise of more than one species in a single sensu lato [ 18 - 20 ] , we calculated the correlation indexes of tetranucleotide signatures ( tetra ) and the average nucleotide identity based on blast and mummer ( anib and anim ) as metrics to assess the species circumscription [ 25 ] .
in the same way , we performed in - silico genome - to - genome comparison to calculate digital dna : dna hybridization estimates ( ddh ) [ 26 ] .
all the evaluated metrics allowed a clearer circumscription for the toxic lineage , providing support to the hypothesis of this group as a novel species .
on the contrary , it is not clear if all the non - toxic strains belong to the same species or not because , although some identity values were below the threshold of species level , the results were not consistent across the metrics ( fig. 4 ) .
for instance , tetra values indicated that the strains 1987 , b1 - cda and nrs 1693 are right on the species boundary with the toxic group , in contrast to results from anib which suggested they are different species from each other .
besides the consensus for the toxic group , the three metrics designated the strains ot4b.31 and kctc 3346 ( l. sphaericus type strain ) as the most divergent ones. fig. 4 heatmaps representing metrics for the evaluation of species circumscription among l. sphaericus strains .
the extent of nucleotide identity was calculated according to different indices for species circumscription : tetra , anib and ddh as illustrated .
the key color is shown for each figure furthermore , to gain a deeper insight on this matter , we aimed to reveal distinctive traits of toxic and non - toxic strain by identifying , evaluating , and comparing clusters of orthologous genes ( cogs ) from protein sequences comparisons .
in concordance with results mentioned above , little functional diversity was found in 4 representatives of toxic lineage since no unique genes were detected for any strain ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
however , when the same evaluation was carried out with two toxic and two non - toxic strains , a greater heterogeneity was observed , with the toxic strains being the ones which shared the highest amount of cogs ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
the core and accessory genes of l. sphaericus as well as core and accessory genes of toxic lineage were identified by following roary pipeline [ 27 ] .
three thousand seven hundred and twenty eight core genes ( defined as genes in more than 95 % of evaluated strains ) were found in toxic lineage as well as a pan - genome pool containing 5881 genes .
in sharp contrast , only 391 genes constituted the core - genome and 20,217 genes constituted the pan - genome when both toxic and non - toxic strains were evaluated .
the phylogenetic tree constructed based on core genes supports the hypothesis about toxic strains as separate species from non - toxic strains , the latter without a clear circumscription ( fig. 5 ) .
interestingly , the strain ot4b.31 was the most related with the strain kctc 3346 , which is the type strain for l. sphaericus [ 28 ] .
thus , this group would be l. sphaericus sensu stricto whereas toxic lineage should be considered as a new species. fig. 5 core and accessory genes of l. sphaericus genomes .
the upper panel shows both contigs and annotated genes which are inferred from pan - genome content and might not represent the genome order .
genes are represented and mapped as blue blocks .
genes shared by two or more sequences are mapped in the same position .
the phylogenetic tree on the left panel was constructed by fasttree 2.0 based on the core genes alignment obtained from roary finally , we assessed the pan - genome of both the toxic lineage and l. sphaericus as it is described nowadays ( comprising toxic and non - toxic strains ) .
the pan - genome of the toxic lineage of l. sphaericus was composed of 3728 core genes and 2153 accessory genes , whereas the pan - genome of the whole l. sphaericus species was larger , with 391 core genes and 19,826 accessory genes , which provides evidence for high intra - species diversity ( fig. 6 and additional file 2 : figure s2 ). fig. 6 pan - and core - genome of l. sphaericus .
the curves depict the pan and core - genome , for toxic strains and for the complete set of analyzed strains , both as function of the number of genomes discussion it is commonly recognized that a few sequenced genomes may misrepresent the entire genetic repertoire of a species [ 29 , 30 ]. that is why the current availability of 14 l. sphaericus genomes has made this traditionally controversial group an excellent candidate for phylogenomics and pan - genomic studies that clarify the species boundaries for this taxon .
in this work , we carried out a comprehensive analysis of l. sphaericus as a species and mosquito - control agent , obtaining results that suggest the need of a new species designation .
the results showed a high diversity within l. sphaericus , with entomopathogenicity being the main feature that allows a clear distinction among the strains .
this supports previous studies whereby a reevaluation of l. sphaericus as a species was suggested. by convention , round - spored mesophilic bacilli that grow at neutral ph and are unable to ferment carbohydrates have been classified as l. sphaericus sensu lato [ 20 ] .
as unique phenotypic traits are discovered , novel species have been designated from this group , this is the case for l. fusiformis , l. boronitolerans , and sporosarcina globispora , among others [ 19 ] .
as nakamura states , the dependence of early studies on insensitive methods hindered estimation of diversity and fostered the creation of heterogeneous species that includes toxic and non - toxic strains [ 19 ] .
hence , variability in toxicity might arise from genetic variability and incorrect classification .
we found evidence that suggests the toxicity could have been acquired by a hgt event because toxin genes were found flanked by genomic islands containing several integrase , recombinase , and transposase sequences .
however , we are still not able to clarify from what kind of gene transfer event the mosquitocidal activity arose .
it is very intriguing that all toxic strains shape a nearly clonal group in spite of their very different provenance : strains 2362 , c3 - 41 and ot4b.49 were respectively isolated from africa , asia and south america .
therefore , we hypothesize that toxins acquisition lead to the emergence of the toxic lineage by providing a fitness increase and thus , a great genomic stabilization .
since the toxic lineage are made up by nearly clonal strains , the sole presence of bina or binb ( which are always together ) and mtx2 ( or cry ) toxin - encoding genes is a good indicator of the feasibility for using a round - spored bacilli as mosquito - control agent .
this could be easily assessed , for instance , by a pcr assay .
in addition , these genes also would indicate the presence of other interesting core genes from this lineage , such as those that encode for s - layer protein and metal efflux pumps [ 14 , 31 ] .
herein , we compared 14 l. sphaericus genomes with one another by using anib , tetra , and digital ddh , in order to achieve a clearer species circumscription [ 25 , 26 , 32 ] .
the results certainly showed the toxic lineage of l. sphaericus as a single and independent species ( fig. 4 and additional file 3 : table s1 ) .
a further evaluation of remaining members of the l. sphaericus species is required due to values outside the intra - species range (< 96 % and < 0.999 for ani and tetra , respectively , and < 70 % for ddh ) in some non - toxic strains .
an alternative and novel way to describe a bacterial species is by its pan - genome , which is the sum of the core ( genes present in all strains ) , dispensable ( genes present in two or more strains ) , and unique ( genes present in single strains ) genomes [ 30 ] .
as tettelin and coworkers proposed , by defining the pan - genome of a bacterium , insights both on its biology and life style can be gained as well as implications for the definitions of the species itself [ 33 ] .
our comparative analysis of 14 l. sphaericus genomes indicated a pan - genome with frequent rearrangements , revealing the striking genomic heterogeneity inside this group .
when performing the same comparative analysis on the 8 entomopathogenic strains , an open but smaller pan - genome as well as highly syntenic regions and less frequent genomic rearrangements were found ( fig. 6 ) .
finally , it is important to take into account that frequent gaps and sequencing errors might cause underestimation in genome annotation and therefore , errors in the estimation of the core - and pan - genome [ 34 ] .
only 4 of the 14 genomes analyzed are completed as a single chromosomal contig , which constitutes an inherent limitation of this study and highlights the importance of technologies that make closed genomes possible .
conclusions we generated a draft genome for the colombian mosquitocidal l. sphaericus ot4b.49 and carried out an analysis of the full repertoire of l. sphaericus available genomes in order to assess intraspecific diversity .
the current study provides strong evidence for considering the toxic - lineage of l. sphaericus as a new species .
historically , many round - spored mesophilic bacilli have been grouped under l. sphaericus classification , leading to the formation of a heterogeneous sensu lato .
we assessed taxonomic composition by means of overall genome relatedness indices and phylogenomic analysis based on core genes .
we found that toxic strains form a well - defined lineage that should be considered as a novel species .
the differentiating feature of this species is the presence of toxin - encoding genes such as bina , b and mtx1 , 2 , 3 , which might be acquired by hgt .
on the other hand , the remaining l. sphaericus strains did not show a clear circumscription and are , indeed , a paraphyletic group .
further studies are needed in order to establish a univocal classification , though this is still challenging in the light of the absence of an unambiguous species definition for bacteria .
methods genome sequencing and assembly the genome sequencing of l. sphaericus ot4b.49 was carried out using pacific biosciences technology with 1 smrt cell , p4 - c2 chemistry , and a mixed library ( ccs and subreads ) .
this service was provided by mcgill university and genome quebec innovation centre .
contig assembly was done using the hgap 2.0 workflow [ 35 ] .
sequencing errors were corrected by aligning multiple short reads on longer reads .
subsequently , the corrected reads were used as seeds into celera assembler [ 36 ] to obtain contigs .
these contigs were polished through an alignment of raw reads on contigs by blasr [ 37 ] and then , high quality consensus sequences were generated from these contigs by a variant calling algorithm ( quiver ) .
genome annotation the genome of l. sphaericus ot4b.49 was annotated using the ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline [ 38 ] and rast [ 39 ] .
in addition , the 14 genomes used in this study ( table 1 ) were re - annotated by prokka [ 40 ] , which locates orfs by prodigal and rna regions using rnammer , aragorn , signalp and infernal .
then , it annotates the translated sequences by a homology searching with blast and hmmer , followed by a searching against public databases ( cdd , pfam , and tigrfam ) and the prokka " kingdom bacteria " database .
16s rdna phylogeny the 16s rdna sequences obtained with prokka , together with the 16s rdna sequences from other bacilli listed below , were aligned using mega 6.0 [ 41 ] with the muscle algorithm .
the phylogenetic tree was then constructed by the neighbor - joining method and the distances , computed with the kimura 's two - parameter model [ 42 ] using only positions with > 95 % coverage .
bootstrap tests were carried out with 500 replicates .
the additional 16s rdna sequences were : bacillus subtilis 168t ( x60646 ) , bacillus licheniformis dsm 13t ( x68416 ) , bacillus megaterium iam 13418t ( d16273 ) , bacillus sp. bd - 87 ( af169520 ) , bacillus sp. bd - 99 ( af169525 ) , bacillus sp. nrs - 1691 ( af169531 ) , bacillus sp. nrs - 1693 ( af169533 ) , solibacillus silvestris stlb046 ( nr _ 074954 ) , bacillus sp. nrs - 250 ( af169536 ) , bacillus sp. b - 1876 ( af169494 ) , bacillus sp. nrs - 1198 ( af169528 ) , bacillus sp. b - 4297 ( af169507 ) , bacillus sp. nrs - 111 ( af169526 ) , bacillus sp. b - 183 ( af169493 ) , lysinibacillus sphaericus b - 23268t ( af169495 ) , lysinibacillus sphaericus jg - a12 ( am292655 ) , bacillus sp. b - 14905 ( af169491 ) , lysinibacillus sphaericus zc1 ( nz _ adjr01000054.1:1 - 1487 ) , bacillus sp. b - 14865 ( af169490 ) , lysinibacillus fusiformis atcc - 7055 ( aj310083 ) , bacillus sp. b - 14957 ( af169492 ) and bacillus sp. b - 23269 ( af169496 ) .
genome comparison mauve software [ 23 ] was used in order to perform whole genome alignments and synteny comparisons .
genomes were also compared with brig [ 24 ] and the genomic islands and toxin - encoding genes , previously predicted , were mapped in this comparison .
dot plots were generated by gepard [ 22 ] using the ordered contigs produced by mauve for each genome .
identification of genomic islands genomic islands were predicted in the complete genomes of toxic l. sphaericus strains using island viewer 3 [ 43 ] .
this tool integrates the islandpick , islandpath.dimob and sigi - hmm algorithms .
average nucleotide identity , correlation indexes , and ddh estimates the values for anib , anim and tetra were calculated by jspecies [ 32 ] for all the possible strain pairs among l. sphaericus genomes .
ddh estimates were obtained from genome to genome distance calculator 2.1 , which transforms the distances from the high - scoring segment pairs to values analogous to ddh using a generalized linear model .
this model is inferred from an empirical reference dataset comprising real ddh values and genome sequences [ 26 ] .
all of the results above were represented as heatmaps using r statistical software [ 44 ] .
pan - and core - genome analysis the pan - and core - genomes for all strains of l. sphaericus as well as for the toxic and non - toxic strains were obtained using orthomcl [ 45 ] and roary ( with codon aware alignment ) [ 27 ] .
roary uses fasttree 2.0 algorithm to infer an approximately - maximum - likelihood tree from large alignments by the jukes - cantor model for nucleotide evolution [ 27 ] .
the results from roary were visualized by phandango [ 46 ] as a phylogenetic tree of core genes and by r statistical package as graphs of number of genes vs number of genomes .
orthologous gene clusters were identified and visualized by orthovenn which follows a similar pipeline to orthomcl [ 47 ] .

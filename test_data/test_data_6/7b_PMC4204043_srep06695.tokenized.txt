thp also has various neurobiological properties but is difficult to synthesize .
therefore , a simple method for thp production is desired .
recent studies have shown that microbes , especially bacteria , can serve as platforms for synthesizing these complex compounds ; however , because bacteria lack organelles , the designed synthetic pathway cannot be compartmentalized .
thus , the metabolic flow is frequently inhibited or disrupted by undesirable reactions .
indeed , in the first attempt to synthesize thp using a single strain of engineered escherichia coli , the yield was quite low (< 5 mum ) , mainly because of the oxidation of thp by tyrosinase , an essential enzyme in our production system .
to circumvent these problems , we constructed a stepwise ( r,s ) - thp production system , in which the dopamine - producing step and the subsequent thp - producing step were separated .
the yield of ( r,s ) - thp reached 1.0 mm ( 287 mg / l ) , the highest yielding bia production method using a microbe reported to date .
furthermore , we demonstrated that ( r,s ) - thp produced by stepwise fermentation is useful for the production of reticuline , an important bias intermediate .
based on these observations , applying the stepwise fermentation method is discussed .
benzylisoquinoline alkaloids ( bias ) include many pharmaceutical compounds , such as berberine ( antidiarrheal ) , sanguinarine ( antibacterial ) , morphine ( analgesic ) and codeine ( antitussive ) ( fig. s1 ) .
because of requirement for complex reactions , it has been difficult to construct practical methods for bia production using traditional synthetic methods , and pharmaceutical bias are primarily obtained by extraction from plants , despite their low content .
recently , microbial production of bia has been reported as an alternative method to plant extraction1234 .
using microbes enables the production of high yields of bia in a short time with low costs3 .
thp possesses the basic skeleton of bia , from which various bias can be obtained by through modifications such as methylation and c - c bond formation .
indeed , thp was used as a starting material for the microbial production of bia24 .
thp is naturally produced by the condensation reaction of dopamine and 3,4 - dyhydroxyphenylacetaldehyde ( 3,4 - dhpaa ) , which is synthesized from dopamine by an endogenous monoamine oxidase ( mao ) in humans .
thp , extensively studied since the 1960's5 , has various neurobiological properties , including reduction of dopamine67 and serotonin synthesis8 , decreasing dopamine uptake9 , and induction of necrotic and apoptotic cell death via oxidative stress101112 .
thp is found in the urine of parkinsonian patients medicated with l - dopa1314 , and the brain of rats administered l - dopa15 ; furthermore , the presence of thp is related to the suppression of cocaine seeking behavior in rats7 .
thus , thp is also important for neurobiology studies .
although thp is in high demand for bia production and neuronal research , it is difficult and expensive to obtain .
therefore , a simple method for thp production is desired .
the biotransformation of dopamine to thp was performed by using aspergillus niger ( a. niger ) , which expresses native mao .
however , this system required dopamine as a substrate , and the yield was low ( 0.03 mm ) 16 .
we report the construction of a ( r,s ) - thp production system by altering the reticuline synthetic pathway3 , previously constructed using escherichia coli .
first , glycerol is converted to tyrosine via a tyrosine over - producing pathway , and then is oxidized to l - dopa by tyrosinase ( tyr ) ( fig. 1 ) .
l - dopa is catalyzed to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase ( dodc ) and mao oxidizes dopamine to 3,4 - dhpaa .
dopamine and 3,4 - dhpaa are finally condensed to ( r,s ) - thp via the non - enzymatic pictet - spengler reaction .
because thp is a relatively unstable and reactive bia because of its two catechol moieties , stabilization of thp is important for ( r,s ) - thp production .
the tyrosinase used in the bia production pathway is a copper containing enzyme with both tyrosine hydroxylase and o - diphenolase activities .
whereas tyrosine hydroxylase activity is essential for l - dopa synthesis in the microbial production system of bia ( fig. 1 ) , o - diphenolase activity is undesirable because it results in the oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of the intermediate compounds , l - dopa and dopamine , to their quinone derivatives17 .
in addition to these two compounds , we speculated that thp was also oxidized by the o - diphenolase activity of tyrosinase .
to establish an easy method for supplying thp , which is an important molecule in bia production and neurobiological research , we attempted to construct a microbial production system .
herein , we report that thp is oxidized by tyrosinase and to avoid oxidation , we employed stepwise fermentative production of ( r,s ) - thp by using dopamine production and mao expression strains .
results ( r,s ) - thp production using a single culture we first attempted to produce ( r,s ) - thp using a single strain ( an1428 ) which contains the complete machinery to synthesize ( r,s ) - thp .
however , only trace levels ( less than 5 mum ) of ( r,s ) - thp was produced by an1428 .
in a previous study , we found that thp was quite unstable in the bia production culture3 .
taken together with the fact that thp has two catechol moieties , we speculated that the low thp productivity of an1428 was as a result of the o - diphenolase activity of tyrosinase .
thus , we measured the o - diphenolase activity toward thp by using purified recombinant tyrosinase .
as expected , thp was oxidized by tyrosinase , and the oxidation ratio of thp was about 69 % compared with that of l - dopa , a value that was approximately four times higher than that of dopamine ( table 1 ) .
these data indicated that thp was quite unstable in the culture of the tyrosinase expressing strain .
stepwise culture strategy for ( r,s ) - thp production the produced thp would be oxidized by tyrosinase , which is an essential enzyme for thp synthesis .
thus , it would be difficult to develop the ( r,s ) - thp production system using a single strain .
for efficient ( r,s ) - thp production , the final step of thp synthesis ( condensation of dopamine and 3,4 - dhpaa , fig. 1 ) should be separated from l - dopa production which is catalyzed by tyrosinase .
there are two ways of separating this pathway , between l - dopa production and ( r,s ) - thp production from l - dopa , and between dopamine production and ( r,s ) - thp from dopamine .
if the pathway was separated at the step of l - dopa production , l - dopa would be degraded by the o - diphenolase activity of tyrosinase .
however , because the o - diphenolase activity toward dopamine was much lower than that toward l - dopa ( table 1 ) , dopamine should be relatively stable in the culture of the tyrosinase expression strain .
hence , we chose to produce thp via dopamine production from a simple carbon source and ( r,s ) - thp conversion from dopamine by using two strains and a two - step culture .
first , dopamine was produced from a simple carbon source using the dopamine producing strain ( an1126 ) , and then this strain was eliminated by centrifugation to prevent contamination of the second step culture .
for the second step , the harvested supernatant containing dopamine was mixed with the mao expression strain ( an1055 ) for ( r,s ) - thp production .
fermentative production of dopamine in general , glycerol is suitable as a carbon source for material production via the shikimate pathway of e .
coli31819 , and we thus attempted dopamine production from glycerol using a dopamine producing strain ( an1126 ) in a jar - fermenter .
tyrosine was produced even before induction and accumulated up to 14 mm ( 2.53 g / l ) at 40 hours after inoculation ( fig. 2a ) , indicating that the tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase was lower than the tyrosine productivity at an early stage of fermentation .
after 40 hours of production , the amount of tyrosine began to decrease , presumably , because it was converted to dopamine via l - dopa .
dopamine production started from 20 hours and continued to 90 hours after inoculation .
significant accumulation of l - dopa was not detected during dopamine production .
approximately 14 mm ( 2.15 g / l , fig. 2a ) of dopamine was produced from 978 mm glycerol ( 90 g / l , fig. 2b ) with a production efficiency of 3.8 % ( note that three molecules of dopamine are synthesized from eight glycerol molecules ) .
conversion of fermentative produced dopamine to ( r,s ) - thp dopamine containing supernatant was harvested by centrifugation so that cells containing tyrosinase did not contaminate the synthetic reaction of ( r,s ) - thp .
( r,s ) - thp production was conducted by mixing the produced dopamine with the culture of the mao expression strain ( an1055 ) .
( r,s ) - thp was continuously accumulated until 6 hours , and then sequentially degraded .
the maximum yield was about 383 mum ( 110 mg / l ) ( fig. 3a ) , and chirality analysis confirmed that both the r - and s - form of thp were produced ( fig. 3c ) .
because its four hydroxyl groups make thp easily oxidized even in the absence of tyrosinase , we speculated that larger yields could be obtained by inhibiting the autoxidation of ( r,s ) - thp .
ascorbic acid is a cheap antioxidant , and is used in cosmetics and foods as an additive .
we therefore evaluated the antioxidant effect of ascorbic acid on ( r,s ) - thp production .
as expected , the productivity of ( r,s ) - thp was improved as the ascorbic acid concentration increased ( fig. 3a ) .
when 30 mm of ascorbic acid was added , the yield was approximately 1.0 mm ( 287 mg / l ) which was a 2.6 - fold improvement ( fig. 3a ) .
this amount was 33 - fold better compared with a previous thp production system using a. niger16 .
( r,s ) - thp production had almost stopped at 9 hours even in the presence of 30 mm ascorbate , nevertheless , more than 3 mm dopamine remained ( fig. 3b ) , indicating that mao activity was reduced after 9 hours .
dopamine continued to decrease , even after ( r,s ) - thp production was arrested .
these data suggested that dopamine was intrinsically unstable in the production culture .
at least two kinds of by - products were detected in the ( r,s ) - thp production culture ( fig. s2a ). from the ms / ms analysis , we could presume that one was 1 - benzyl - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline - 6,7 - diol ( m / z = 256 ) and the other was norcoclaurine ( m / z = 272 ) .
the maximum amounts of 1 - benzyl - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline - 6,7 - diol and norcoclaurine were equivalent to 0.41 +/ - 0.01 and 0.57 +/ - 0.04 mm thp , respectively ( as calculated from the lc - ms peak areas ) .
the conversion efficiency of ( r,s ) - thp from dopamine was only 15.9 % ( note that one molecule of thp is synthesized from two dopamine molecules ) .
this low efficiency was probably as a result of the instability of substrates and the production of by - products .
reticuline production from ( r,s ) - thp produced in this system reticuline is synthesized from thp through a three - step methylation process ( fig. 4a ) , and is an important intermediate of bia .
in fact , it is frequently the target compound of bia production using microbes1232021 .
to evaluate the usability of ( r,s ) - thp produced by the stepwise fermentation system , we attempted to produce reticuline from ( r,s ) - thp by using a three - methyltransferase expression strain ( hm66 ) .
reticuline production was conducted by mixing the culture of hm66 with the same volume of ( r,s ) - thp containing supernatant .
a total of 146 mum ( 48.0 mg / l ) of reticuline was produced from 445 mum of ( r,s ) - thp , with a conversion efficiency of 32.8 % , which was superior to previously reported yeast systems24 ( fig. 4b ) .
thus , these data confirmed that ( r,s ) - thp produced by using the stepwise fermentation system was suitable for bia production using a microbial system .
discussion the bottleneck of ( r,s ) - thp production is that it is easily oxidized .
we found that tyrosinase has strong oxidation activity for thp , which coincides with the observation that the cytotoxicity of thp was reduced by tyrosinase in human melanocytes22 .
in order to avoid thp oxidation by tyrosinase , the synthesis of ( r,s ) - thp was divided into two steps .
consequently , ( r,s ) - thp was successfully produced using e. coli .
in addition to avoiding undesirable reactions , multi - step culture is effective in cases where a compound produced in the downstream portion of the pathway inhibits the activity of an enzyme used upstream .
hydrogen peroxide easily oxidizes 3 - deoxy - d - arabino - heptulosonate - 7 - phosphate synthase ( arog ) 23 , which is the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway and was over - expressed for the tyrosine over - production in the bia production pathway ( fig. 1 ) .
hydrogen peroxide was produced during the conversion of dopamine to 3,4 - dhpaa by mao .
therefore , using a two - step culture should help to avoid the deactivation of arog by hydrogen peroxide .
ascorbic acid was added to the second culture for stabilization of ( r,s ) - thp , and improved productivity ( fig. 3a ) .
because dopamine also has a catechol moiety , we speculated that addition of ascorbic acid would also improve dopamine production .
however , it had the opposite effect on dopamine production ( fig. s3 ) .
tyrosine was increased in the culture containing ascorbic acid .
therefore , the decreased productivity of dopamine was likely a result of inhibition of the tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase .
in fact , it has been reported that tyrosinase is inhibited by ascorbic acid24 .
because the ascorbic acid prevented the production of dopamine , ascorbic acid could not be used in the thp production system employing a single strain .
in addition to the advantages described above , the multi - step culture allows optimization of the production conditions at each step .
in stepwise culture , the substrate produced by the prior step has to permeate through the cell membrane of the strain used in the next step .
however , generally the substrate becomes diluted in the culture medium of the prior step lowering the efficiency of the next step .
dopamine was unstable in the ( r,s ) - thp production method presented herein , thus , it needs to be quickly processed by the second strain expressing mao .
although we do not know how e. coli incorporates dopamine , the permeability of dopamine should be improved .
a previously reported thp production system using a. niger produced approximately 0.03 mm thp from dopamine16 .
in the present system , approximately 1.0 mm ( r,s ) - thp was produced ( fig. 3a ) , a concentration 33 times higher than that produced in the a. niger system .
this great improvement was achieved by avoiding the oxidation of thp using the stepwise culture technique .
although some bias such as salutaridine2 , sanguinarine4 , and morphine25 can be produced by a yeast system , they require the specific substrates thp or thebaine. e. coli systems for bia production , including the present system , do not require any specific substrate other than glycerol , which is inexpensive. from a practical viewpoint , the low cost of the substrate is an important factor for the microbial production of secondary metabolites .
various p450 enzymes can be used in the production of different kinds of bia , for example , cyp719b to produce morphinan alkaloids26 and cyp80g2 to produce magnoflorine27 .
while e. coli is a superior system for the practical production of the bia building block , a yeast system is better than an e. coli system for p450 expression .
a combination of yeast and e. coli systems would be a much more powerful tool for bia production , similar to our previously reported work1 .
however , 1 - benzyl - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline - 6,7 - diol and norcoclaurine were detected as by - products .
one or two hydroxy groups were absent from the benzyl moiety of these products .
while the benzyl moiety of thp is derived from 3,4 - dhpaa , those of 1 - benzyl - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline - 6,7 - diol and norcoclaurine are presumably derived from phenylacetaldehyde ( paa ) and 4 - hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde ( 4 - hpaa ) , respectively .
when ( r,s ) - thp was produced from the commercial pure dopamine , these by - products were not detectable ( fig. s2b ) , indicating that aldehydes are synthesized from the compounds contained in the first - step culture .
because mao can oxidize not only dopamine but also phenethylamine and tyramine , these aldehydes could have been synthesized from their cognate amine via the action of mao .
approximately 7.6 mm phenethylamine and 2.0 mm tyramine were detected in the dopamine containing supernatant .
dodc from pseudomonas putida is highly specific for l - dopa compared with l - phenylalanine and l - tyrosine28 ; accordingly , the by - products might be produced from l - phenylalanine and l - tyrosine via undesirable reactions catalyzed by mao and dodc .
presumable by - products synthetic pathways are summarized in supplementary fig. s2c .
the purification method should be established after the by - product analysis as the presence of by - products with similar properties to thp would make purification difficult .
bias are classified into two types , ( s ) - reticuline derived bias such as protoberberine alkaloids and ( r ) - reticuline derived bias such as morphinan alkaloids ( fig. s1 ) .
in plants , ( s ) - reticuline is synthesized prior to ( r ) - reticuline , and ( r ) - reticuline is produced from ( s ) - reticuline via a two - step enzymatic reaction29 ( fig. s1 ) .
however , because these enzymes have not been identified yet , the production of both ( r ) - and ( s ) - thp as precursors of ( r,s ) - reticuline is important for the synthesis of r - form derived bias by microbial systems , even if the s - form is still present .
in the bia production system previously constructed , the s - form specific enzyme , norcoclaurine synthetase ( ncs ) , was used to catalyze the condensation reaction of thp synthesis1321 .
herein , the pictet - spengler reaction was used in the stepwise fermentation system , thus both ( r ) - and ( s ) - thp were successfully produced ( fig. 3c ) .
( r,s ) - reticuline has been successfully produced from ( r,s ) - thp by microbial production23 , and all enzymes involved in the synthesis of morphine from ( r ) - reticuline have already been identified , implying that ( r,s ) - thp production by this system would enable the microbial production of morphinan alkaloids such as thebaine , codeine and morphine without addition of any specific substrates .
the stepwise culture method avoids undesirable reactions and inhibition ; furthermore , it allows each culture step to be optimized .
at present , some plant secondary metabolites are produced by microbial systems , and various secondary metabolites may be synthesized by engineered bacteria in the future .
to produce plant secondary metabolites using microbes , many enzymes need to be expressed in the microbial system .
undesirable reactions and enzyme inhibition limit efficient production .
a stepwise culture method is one strategy to solve these problems , similar to multi - step synthesis in traditional chemical reactions .
indeed , although ( r,s ) - thp could not be produced by a single strain , it can now be produced via a stepwise culture .
producing ( r,s ) - thp via stepwise fermentation described herein is a simple method that does not require expensive substrates .
thus , it has potential applications in bia production and thp - related research .
methods plasmids and bacterial strains used in this study plasmids and bacterial strains are listed in table 2 .
( r,s ) - thp production using a single strain overnight culture of an1428 was inoculated into 50 ml terrific broth ( per liter : 12 g tripton ( diffco ) , 24 g yeast extract ( diffco ) , 9.4 g k2hpo4 and 2.2 g kh2po4 ) containing 50 mg / l ampicillin , 25 mg / l kanamycin , 2 % glycerol , and 0.1 mm cuso4 in a 300 - ml baffled shake flask , and the culture was grown at 25 degreesc .
iptg ( final , 0.1 mm ) was added for induction 12 hours after inoculation .
samples were harvested at 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 hours after induction .
purification of his - tagged tyrosinase the tyrosinase gene from ralstonia solanacealum ( rstyr ) with a t7 promoter was amplified by pcr using pet23a - rstyr3 with the primer set 5 ' - cccgagctcgatcccgcgaaattaatacga - 3 ' and 5 ' - ttactcgaggataaccgcaacttcaatgg - 3 ' .
this fragment was cloned into the bglii - xhoi site of pet23a and fused to a hexahistidine tag at the c - terminus generating pet23a - rstyr - his ( pan443 ) .
rstyr - his was expressed in bl21 ( de3 ) ( novagen , an447 ) .
overnight culture was inoculated into 50 ml terrific broth with 50 mg / l ampicillin in a baffled shake flask at 25degreesc .
isopropyl - beta - d - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) ( final , 1 mm ) was added for induction at 12 hours after inoculation .
following further incubation for 12 hours , cells were harvested and suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.0 ) with 10 % glycerol .
the cell - free extract obtained by sonication was applied on a ni - nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column ( qiagen ) , and eluted fractions were collected .
the purity of tyrosinase was confirmed by sds - page .
the most pure fraction was further purified by amicon ultra - 15 ( 30 k , millipore ) treatment to eliminate the smaller proteins .
the protein concentration was measured using the bca protein assay kit ( pierce ) .
the km value of rstyr - his versus l - tyrosine was 1.63 +/ - 0.29 mm ( four independent experiments ) , which was almost identical with that for the native rstyr in a previous report ( 1.32 mm ) 17 .
measurement of the o - diphenolase activity of tyrosinase the o - diphenolase activity for l - dopa , dopamine and ( r,s ) - thp were determined by decreasing the ratio of substrates .
the reaction mixture ( 0.1 ml ) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 5.5 ) , 0.01 mm cuso4 , 1 mm substrate and 3.48 mug protein .
the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 % tca at 5 , 15 , and 30 minutes .
fermentative production of dopamine the dopamine production strain ( an1126 , table 1 ) was cultured overnight in lb medium at 37degreesc , and 10 ml cell culture was inoculated into 1 l terrific broth with 5 g / l glycerol , 50 mg / l ampicillin , and 25 mg / l kanamycin .
the ph , temperature ( 25degreesc constant ) , dissolved oxygen level , and feeding rate of glycerol were controlled as described previously3 .
induction was carried out by adding 0.1 mm ( final concentration ) iptg and 0.1 mm ( final concentration ) cuso4 at 14 hours after inoculation ( od600 was approximately 20 , and an od600 of 1.0 was equivalent to a dry cell weight of 0.40 +/ - 0.01 g / l ) .
the glycerol concentration was measured with a glycerol assay kit ( cayman chemical ) as previously described3 .
because glycerol inhibited thp production in the second step of the culture ( fig. s4 ) , the culture was harvested at 105 hours after inoculation , when glycerol had been completely consumed .
the supernatant collected after centrifugation contained 12.6 mm dopamine .
the supernatant was stored at - 80degreesc until further use .
conversion of fermentative produced dopamine to ( r,s ) - thp an overnight culture of the mao expression strain ( an1055 ) was diluted 100 - fold into 50 ml terrific broth containing 50 mg / l ampicillin in a 300 - ml baffled shake flask , and the culture was grown at 25degreesc .
iptg ( final , 1 mm ) was added for induction at 12 hours after inoculation .
to avoid dilution of dopamine , the cells were precipitated at 12 hours after induction when the od600 was between 23 and 25 , and mixed with the same volume of dopamine - containing supernatant harvested from the dopamine production culture .
because we had previously determined that bia production required acidic conditions21 , 100 mm 2 - ( n - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid was added to the culture , resulting in a ph of approximately 6.0 .
ascorbic acid was also added if necessary .
when ( r,s ) - thp was produced from commercial dopamine ( fig. s2b ) , culture and induction were carried out using the same conditions described above .
instead of mixing the dopamine containing supernatant , 10 mm dopamine was added to the culture of an1055 .
both ( r,s ) - thp production methods were performed at 29degreesc .
chirality analysis the stereoselectivity of thp was analyzed by lc - ms after separation on an agilent hplc system .
hplc conditions were as follows : column , chiralpak ia ( daicel chemical industries ) ; solvent system , formate solution ( ph 2.0 ) : methanol ( 83:17 ) ; flow rate , 0.3 ml / min at 40degreesc .
identification of the r - and s - forms was conducted by comparing with the thp produced in vitro using ncs ( s - form specific enzyme ) , which contained a larger amount of ( s ) - thp than ( r ) - thp .
thp was confirmed by its select ion ( m / z = 288 ) and ms / ms fragment pattern ( daughter ions : m / z = 123 and 164 ) .
reticuline production the supernatant of the ( r,s ) - thp production culture was harvested by centrifugation , and found to contain 990 mum ( r,s ) - thp .
the three - methyltransferase expression strain ( hm66 ) was cultured in terrific broth containing 50 mg / l chloramphenicol for 12 hours .
after induction was carried out by the addition of 1 mm ( final concentration ) iptg , the culture was continued for more 12 hours .
the ( r,s ) - thp containing supernatant was added to the same volume of hm66 culture and 1 % glucose .
the production mixture was incubated at 25degreesc .
detection and quantification of chemical compounds for the in vitro assay , the samples were analyzed by hplc using a discovery hs f5 column ( supelco ) after centrifugation .
compounds were separated on the column by using 30 % acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium formate ( ph 3.0 ) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml / min .
l - dopa , dopamine , and thp were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. the samples collected from the production culture were treated with 2 % trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged .
l - tyrosine , l - dopa , and dopamine were analyzed by hplc using the same conditions as the in vitro assay , except for the mobile phase where the concentration of acetonitrile was increased from 3 to 20 % in 10 mm ammonium formate ( ph 3.0 ) .
thp ( m / z = 288 ) , reticuline ( m / z = 330 ) , 1 - benzyl - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline - 6,7 - diol ( m / z = 256 ) , norcoclaurine ( m / z = 272 ) and phenethylamine ( m / z = 122 ) were analyzed by lc - ms using the same method as described previously3 .
because by - products were not available commercially , their concentrations were estimated as equivalents of thp .

the recent interest and elucidation of the jak / stat signaling pathway created new targets for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases ( isds ) .
jak inhibitors in oral and topical formulations have shown beneficial results in psoriasis and alopecia areata .
patients suffering from other isds might also benefit from jak inhibition .
given the development of specific jak inhibitors , the expression patterns of jaks in different isds needs to be clarified .
we aimed to analyze the expression of jak / stat family members in a set of prevalent isds : psoriasis , lichen planus ( lp ) , cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( cle ) , atopic dermatitis ( ad ) , pyoderma gangrenosum ( pg ) and alopecia areata ( aa ) versus healthy controls for ( p ) jak1 , ( p ) jak2 , ( p ) jak3 , ( p ) tyk2 , pstat1 , pstat2 and pstat3 .
the epidermis carried in all isds , except for cle , a strong jak3 signature .
the dermal infiltrate showed a more diverse expression pattern .
jak1 , jak2 and jak3 were significantly overexpressed in pg and ad suggesting the need for pan - jak inhibitors .
in contrast , psoriasis and lp showed only jak1 and jak3 upregulation , while aa and cle were characterized by a single dermal jak signal ( pjak3 and pjak1 , respectively ) .
this indicates that the latter diseases may benefit from more targeted jak inhibitors .
our in vitro keratinocyte psoriasis model displayed reversal of the psoriatic jak profile following tofacitinib treatment .
this direct interaction with keratinocytes may decrease the need for deep skin penetration of topical jak inhibitors in order to exert its effects on dermal immune cells .
in conclusion , these results point to the important contribution of the jak / stat pathway in several isds .
considering the epidermal jak3 expression levels , great interest should go to the investigation of topical jak3 inhibitors as therapeutic option of isds .

introduction inflammatory skin diseases ( isds ) are very prevalent worldwide and have a serious impact on the patients' quality of life .
however , treatment options remain scarce with corticosteroids being the main topical option .
recent advances on the role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of immune mediated inflammatory diseases lead to the understanding that many pro - inflammatory interleukins use jak / stat components for signal transduction [ 1 , 2 ] .
briefly , the jak / stat signaling pathway transmits information from extracellular chemical signals to the nucleus resulting in dna transcription .
binding of ligands , such as interferon and interleukins , to their specific transmembrane receptors activate associated jaks .
subsequently , activated jaks ( janus kinases ) phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor , creating docking sites for latent stats ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
after recruitment of stat to the receptor , they are also phosphorylated by jaks .
activated stats migrate to the nucleus of the cell and promote gene transcription or induction [ 3 , 4 ] .
in mammals , the jak / stat family consists of 4 jak members ( jak1 , jak2 , jak3 and tyk2 ) and 7 stat members ( stat1 , stat2 , stat3 , stat4 , stat5a , stat5b , stat6 ) [ 3 ] .
the jaks are selectively activated by different receptors and have , therefore , distinct in vivo roles [ 4 ] .
jak1 is mainly activated by type ii cytokine receptors .
jak2 is crucial in transducing signals for cytokine receptors involved in hematopoiesis ( erythropoietin , thrombopoietin and haematopoietic cell development cytokines ) .
jak3 is mainly expressed in b and t lymphocytes , and tyk2 associates commonly with other jaks [ 5 ] .
the recent discovery of the jak / stat signaling pathway opened a new window of opportunity for the treatment of isds and promoted the development of drugs that block jak activation [ 1 , 2 ] .
the kinase domain of jaks makes them an easier pharmacological target compared to stats , which do not have catalytic activity [ 3 ] .
one of the advantages of jak inhibitors is their structure .
they are small molecules , which can easily penetrate the epidermal barrier and therefore be used in topical formulations [ 6 ] .
in psoriasis , the involvement of jaks has been shown and enabled the assessment of oral and topical jak inhibitors as therapeutics .
tofacitinib , a pan - jak inhibitor with predominant anti - jak3 effect , has shown promising results in the treatment of psoriasis both orally [ 7 ] and topically [ 8 ] .
ruxolitinib , a jak1 / 2 inhibitor used in the treatment of hematological diseases , has been tested in topical formulations to treat mild to moderate psoriasis , with favorable results [ 9 ] .
however , the knowledge of the cutaneous jak involvement in the isds is scarce and mostly based on in vitro or animal model analysis .
in some of the most prevalent isds , such as mucosal lichen planus , cutaneous lupus erythematosus , atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata , th1 and / or th17 responses have been shown [ 10 - 16 ] .
the main cytokines involved in th1 and th17 responses use jaks for signaling [ 1 , 17 , 18 ] .
additionally , not only t cells , but also keratinocytes , dendritic cells , mast cells , eosinophils and macrophages could be activated [ 19 , 20 ] .
due to the need of further elucidation of the jak signaling in the isds , we aimed to analyze the cutaneous jak / stat expression in 6 prevalent isds .
the set of isds comprises psoriasis , lichen planus ( lp ) , cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( cle ) , atopic dermatitis ( ad ) , alopecia areata ( aa ) and pyoderma gangrenosum ( pg ) .
methods human skin biopsies skin biopsies from patients with unequivocal clinical and histopathological diagnosis of psoriasis ( n = 23 ) , lp ( n = 23 ; 8 cutaneous lichen planus , 9 lichen planopilaris , 6 mucous lichen planus ) , cle ( n = 22 ; 12 chronic discoid lupus , 6 subacute lupus , 1 acute lupus , 3 lupus tumidus ) , ad ( n = 20 ) , aa ( n = 7 ) , and pg ( n = 10 ) were retrospectively collected from the dermatology department tissue biobank at the ghent university hospital , belgium .
skin biopsies from healthy volunteers ( n = 18 ) were used as controls .
additionally , lesional zskin biopsies from psoriasis patients ( n = 10 ) and healthy controls ( n = 10 ) were preserved in rnalater solution ( life technologies , belgium ) at - 20degreesc .
all skin biopsies included in this study were derived from patients who have n't been receiving any systemic / topical immunosuppressant or immunomodulator during a minimum of 15 days before the excision .
this study was carried out in accordance with the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki .
the protocol was approved by the committee of ethics of the ghent university hospital - belgium ( number : b670201318616 / b670201318860 ) .
written informed consent was obtained from the involved subjects before the skin biopsy was done for the qpcr analysis .
regarding the retrospective material , the patients were informed about the research and should contact the service only if they disagreed with the research .
immunohistochemistry biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry and deparaffinized sections ( 4 mum ) were stained using dako immunohistochemistry products ( heverlee , belgium ) .
antigens were retrieved using target retrieval solution ( ph 6.1 or 9 , 97degreesc ) for 10 - 30 minutes .
slides were blocked using envision flex peroxidase - blocking reagent and incubated with the primary antibody during 1 h at room temperature .
detection was performed using the envision flex / hrp detection reagent and aec + .
after counterstaining using envision flex haematoxylin , slides were mounted and images were taken using zeiss microscope ( axiophot ) , camera ( axiocam ) and software ( axiovision ) ( zeiss , belgium ) .
the antibodies and their dilutions , ph and duration of antigen retrieval used , were consecutively : jak2 (# 3230 , 1 / 50 , ph9 , 10 ') , pstat1 (# 9167 , 1 / 50 , ph9 , 10 ') and pstat3 (# 9145 , 1 / 50 , ph9 , 10 ') , all rabbit monoclonal antibodies from cell signaling ( bioke , the netherlands ) ; jak1 ( ab47435 , rabbit polyclonal , 1 / 200 , ph9 , 20 ') , jak3 ( ab61198 , rabbit polyclonal , 1 / 50 , ph9 , 30 ') , tyk2 ( ab115691 , rabbit polyclonal , 1 / 50 , ph6.1 , 30 ') and pjak2 ( ab32101 , rabbit monoclonal , 1 / 200 , ph9 , 20 ') ( abcam , united kingdom ) ; pjak1 ( sc - 101716 , 1 / 50 , ph9 , 30 ') and ptyk2 ( sc - 11763 , 1 / 50 , ph6.1 , 30 ') rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( santa cruz , germany ) ; pjak3 ( abin742868 , 1 / 200 , ph9 , 30 ') and pstat2 ( bs - 3428r , 1 / 100 , ph9 , 10 ') rabbit polyclonal antibodies from bioss antibodies ( bio - connect , the netherlands ) .
antibody validation in order to validate the antibodies' performance , positive control samples were included : breast carcinoma tissue for jak1 , jak2 , pjak1 , pstat2 ; cutaneous t cell lymphoma for jak3 , pjak2 and pjak3 , crohn 's disease and duodenum for respectively tyk2 and ptyk2 , and psoriasis skin for pstat1 and pstat3 staining .
isotype controls were used to exclude antibodies which represented nonspecific binding .
in vitro psoriasis model to validate the epidermal staining profile , we used the monolayer in vitro psoriasis model described by bracke et al using keratinocytes from a healthy donor. [ 21 ] .
after isolated , the keratinocytes were cultured in 6 well culture plates containing keratinocyte growth medium ( kgm , 2ml per wells ) during 48h , when they reached at least 70 % of confluence .
subsequently , the keratinocytes were divided in three groups and cultured during more 48h ( medium was changed ) .
group 1 was induced to normal keratinocyte differentiation by culture in kgm and used as control ; in group 2 , psoriasis - associated features were induced by culture in kgm supplemented with 5 % fbs ( fetal bovine serum ) and a pro - inflammatory cytokines mixture ( 10ng / ml il - 1alpha ( life technologies , belgium ) , 5 ng / ml il - 6 , 5 ng / ml tnf - alpha , 10 ng / ml il - 17a [ 21 ] and 20 ng / ml il - 22 ( all from peprotech , united kingdom )) , and group 3 was induced to psoriasis - associated features as group 2 and treated with tofacitinib 1mum tofacitinib ( sigma - aldrich , belgium ) , which was added to the medium ( simultaneously induction of psoriasis features and treatment with a jak inhibitor ) .
after 48 hours of induction , the cells were colleted , after removal of the medium and addition of trypsin edta , and fixed and embedded in paraffin .
briefly , the cells were pelleted by centrifugation ( 400 rpm , 10 ' at room temperature ) , fixed in 10 % buffered formalin ( sigma - aldrich , belgium ) during 2 h at room temperature and pelleted once more .
cell pellets were resuspended in 300 mul pbs and heated to 65degreesc in a warm water bath for less than 10 minutes .
next , 600 mul of melted agarose ( 3 % low melting point agarose in pbs , at 65degreesc - - difco , united states ) was added to the cells followed by immediate centrifugation .
after gelation on ice , the gelled pellets were processed to paraffin blocks .
immunohistochemistry staining for pjak1 , pjak2 , pjak3 and ptyk2 was done as described above .
staining analysis and classification the 18 healthy controls and 20 psoriatic skin biopsies were stained with the complete jak / stat antibody panel .
regarding the other isds , samples of 10 patients ( 7 in the case of alopecia areata ) were stained for jak2 , jak3 , tyk2 , pjak2 , pjak3 , ptyk2 .
for jak1 , pjak1 and the pstats , all the biopsies were stained ( 23 from lp , 22 from cle , 20 from ad , 7 from aa and 10 from pg ) .
slides were blindly analyzed using image j software .
in dermal inflammatory cells , the staining was classified as either ' positive ' or ' negative ' .
in the epidermal part , a distinction was made between cytoplasmatic and nuclear staining .
when the staining was localized in the cytoplasm , the intensity and extent of staining were scored ( extent 0 : negative , 1 : only basal layer , 2 : <= ( 1 / 2 ) of the epidermal thickness and 3 : > ( 1 / 2 ) of the epidermal thickness ) .
for nuclear staining , the amount of stained cells per epidermal area ( mm2 ) was counted .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed comparing each dermatosis with the healthy controls using spss statistics 22 .
differences between the groups were assessed by kruskal - wallis anova for continuous variables .
a chi - square test was used for the analysis of the not continuous variables .
the results were considered statistically significant for p <= 0.05 .
rna isolation and real - time qpcr analysis of skin biopsies untreated lesional psoriatic skin biopsies and healthy human skin obtained from patients undergoing plastic surgery were collected for jak / stat gene expression analysis .
rna isolation of the biopsies followed by rna quality control and cdna synthesis was done at biogazelle ( biogazelle nv , belgium ) .
briefly , the tissuelyser lt was used for the disruption and homogenization of the biopsies , prior to rna extraction with the mirneasy micro kit according to manufacturer 's recommendation ( qiagen , belgium ) .
rna integrity was assessed by means of experion automated electrophoresis system ( bio - rad , belgium ) .
the software algorithm was used to calculate the rna quality index ( rqi ) based on 28s / 18s ribosomal rna ratio .
rna concentrations were high ( between 300 and 5500 ng / mul for a 15 mul eluate ) and rna integrity was acceptable ( rqi : 6 to 9.3 ) .
the absence of gdna was confirmed in all samples .
cdna synthesis was performed using the iscript advanced cdna synthesis kit ( bio - rad , belgium ) with 800 ng as total rna input .
the cdna quality of each sample was assessed by means of two human universally expressed genes .
cdna synthesis failed for one control sample which was excluded for further analysis .
a genorm pilot study was performed at biogazelle to select proper , stably expressed reference genes for data normalization using a set of 8 candidate reference genes on all 19 samples .
b2m and pp1a were identified as most stable reference genes .
therefore , the geometric mean of these two genes was used in order to calculate the optimal normalization factor needed for data normalization .
qpcr - based gene expression analysis of jak1 , jak2 , jak3 , tyk2 , stat1 , stat2 , stat3 , and the reference genes was done by use of validated primepcr assays ( bio - rad , belgium ) .
all measurements were performed in 384 - well plates in a reaction volume of 5 mul ( with 5 ng cdna input ) using sybr green i. each pcr was done in duplicate .
data - analysis was done in biogazelle 's qbase + software [ 22 ] .
due to the presence of high cq values (> 30 ) or missing values for genes of interest , one psoriasis and two control samples were excluded for statistical analysis .
therefore , 9 psoriasis samples and 8 control samples were analyzed by the mann - whitney u test ( 2 - tailed ) in qbase + .
the results were considered statistically significant for p <= 0.05 .
results in total 143 biopsies were analyzed ( n = 123 immunohistochemistry ; n = 20 qpcr analysis ) .

jak / stat expression in isd skin biopsies all 4 jaks and their corresponding phosphorylated forms were positive in the epidermis and dermis of investigated diseases ( figs 1 and 2 ) .
they showed expression in the cytoplasm and along the cell membrane of keratinocytes , with the exception of pjak2 which was only present in the nucleus of the cells ( fig 2 insert ) .
in addition to the cytoplasmatic localization , tyk2 and ptyk2 were also expressed in the nucleus , with ptyk2 nuclear expression being more pronounced than the cytoplasmatic staining ( figs 1 and 2 insert ) .
these data confirm previous reports on the intranuclear localization of pjak2 and ptyk2 , though their nuclear function remains to be clarified [ 23 , 24 ] .
additional studies are necessary to clarify the intranuclear function of jaks .
furthermore , in all the diseases , a perinuclear localization of jak2 , jak3 and pjak3 was observed in some of the slides .
the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the pjaks in the epidermis was confirmed in in vitro cultured keratinocytes .

similar expression was seen in all studied diseases : jak1 , 2 and 3 were expressed in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes and tyk2 , besides cytoplasmic expression , had nuclear expression of tyk2 ( arrow ) .

as expected , pstat1 , 2 and 3 are located into the nucleus of keratinocytes and / or dermal inflammatory cells , where they bind a dna - recognition motif called gamma - activated sites ( gas ) in the promoter region of cytokine - inducible genes and activate transcription [ 3 ] .
various patterns of epidermal jak / stat expression in diseased versus healthy skin in the epidermis , jak3 but mainly it phosphorylated form showed a higher expression in all isds except in cle ( p value for the pjak3 intensity analysis for ad , aa and pg was , respectively : 0.018 ; < 0.001 and 0.018 ) .
jak1 and pjak1 were only significantly overexpressed in pg ( p = 0.013 for jak1 , p = 0.024 for pjak1 ) .
no significantly different expression was seen for jak2 and pjak2 ( figs 3 and 4 ) in any of the investigated isds .
conversely , tyk2 and ptyk2 was underexpressed in the epidermis of psoriasis , lp , cle and pg ( figs 3 and 4 ) .
in aa and pg , tyk2 epidermal intensity was higher compared to control skin , although ptyk2 was underexpressed ( figs 3 and 4 ) .

strong pstat2 overexpression was present in ad , aa and pg ( p = 0.03 , < 0.001 and 0.009 respectively ) and pstat3 in psoriasis , ad and pg ( p = 0.034 , 0.002 and 0.001 respectively ) while there was no obvious pstat1 signal in de epidermal layer ( fig 4 ) .
thus , lp shows no differences in epidermal pstat expression compared to healthy skin .
moreover , there was no increased epidermal expression of any jak / stat member in lupus , except for a slight increase in pstat3 .
even after excluding lupus tumidus , a dermal form of lupus , the results remained unchanged .
different expression of jak / stat members in dermal inflammatory cells compared to healthy skin , the expression of both pjak1 ( p - value pso : 0.002 , lp : 0.01 , cle : < 0.001 , ad : 0.002 , pg : 0.004 ) and pjak3 ( p - value pso : 0.003 , lp : 0.001 , ad : < 0.001 , aa : 0.002 , pg : < 0.001 ) was significantly enhanced in the dermal inflammatory cells of most studied diseases ( fig 3 , table 2 ) .
this overexpression was more pronounced than in the epidermal keratinocytes .
the expression of ( p ) tyk2 in the inflammatory cells of isds was comparable to that of healthy skin , with a significant underexpression of tyk2 in lp ( p < 0.001 ) .
none of the isds is characterized by an increased expression of jak2 , however pjak2 was overexpressed in ad ( p = 0.042 ) and pg ( p = 0.009 ) .

qpcr analysis of jak / stat expression in psoriasis confirms jak3 overexpression the expression of jak / stats in psoriatic skin was further elucidated by qpcr ( fig 5 ) .
compared to healthy skin , jak3 ( p = 0.024 ) was significantly overexpressed , while jak2 ( p = 0.001 ) and tyk2 ( p = 0.604 ) exhibited a decreased expression .
these results are in agreement with the jak immunohistochemistry expression profile ( fig 3 ) .
overall , the jak1 expression in psoriatic skin was lower than healthy controls ( p = 0.02 ) .
regarding stats , qpcr results indicated overexpression of stat3 ( p = 0.052 ) and stat1 ( p = 0.005 ) in psoriasis ( fig 5 ) .

* p <= 0.05 .
stimulation and inhibition experiments we used our previously developed in vitro psoriasis model [ 21 ] to confirm the expression patterns observed in the psoriatic biopsies .
a psoriatic phenotype was induced in keratinocytes as previously described by our group ( fig 6 ) .
a marked pjak3 overexpression was found with a less intense pjak1 induction corresponding to the psoriasis biopsy analysis .
a subsequent treatment with tofacitinib showed reversal of pjak3 and pjak1 expression demonstrating a direct interaction of jak inhibitors with psoriatic keratinocytes .

the pjaks expression in pso kcs was similar and summarizes the one observed in the epidermis of the psoriasis skin biopsies .
strong pjak3 expression and weak positive pjak1 expression was induced by psoriasis stimulation and inhibited after treatment with tofacitinib .
phospho - jak2 and ptyk2 expression did not change neither with psoriasis stimulation nor with the treatment .
note the cytoplasm localization of pjak1 and pjak3 and the nuclear localization of ptyk2 in the keratinocytes .
as pjak2 was negative in all conditions , the localization of the staining could not be analysed .
original magnification x200 .
discussion to our knowledge , this is the first study investigating the expression of the jak / stat components in a panel of inflammatory skin diseases using human skin disease material .
overall , the jak3 pathway was most upregulated followed by jak1 and to a lesser extent jak2 .
in the epidermal layer , jak3 was overexpressed in all isds except cle indicating its crucial role in inflammatory keratinocytes .
this suggests that jak3 inhibition is the most promising approach for topical application as it can directly reverse the jak profile of keratinocytes .
in our in vitro psoriasis model we showed that tofacitinib directly inhibits pjak3 and pjak1 expression in psoriatic keratinocytes .
this implies that topical treatment with tofacitinib may exert a direct impact on the psoriatic phenotype independent of its activities on infiltrating immune cells .
this indicates that deep dermal infiltration of topical jak inhibitors , increasing the likelihood of systemic absorption , might not be necessary .
downstream , pstat2 and pstat3 are strongly expressed while no signs of stat1 activation were found .
the importance of stat3 in inflammation has already been demonstrated .
it has been proven that stat3 plays a role in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation , is activated in psoriatic lesions [ 25 - 27 ] and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of psoriasis [ 27 ] .
this suggests that topical application of jak inhibitors would mainly act on the stat3 cascade .
the role of stat2 is still unknown , but it has been suggested that stat2 plays a role in the activation of stat1 and stat3 [ 28 ] .
in the dermal layer , the inflammatory immune cells in most isds showed expression of all jaks , with the exception of tyk2 , although the subsequent stat signaling was dependent on the type of skin disease .
our results indicate that psoriasis is mainly a jak3 and jak1 driven disease with a predominance of stat3 signaling .
stat3 upregulation was seen in our qpcr analysis of psoriatic samples .
these findings corroborate with previous reports [ 26 ] .
it has been shown that stat3 is involved in the upregulation of keratin 17 , a hallmark of psoriasis , in keratinocytes following il - 17a stimulation [ 29 ] .
in vitro , jak3 / stat3 signaling acts as a target in the treatment of psoriasis models [ 30 , 31 ] .
tofacitinib , one of the most investigated jak inhibitors in the treatment of psoriasis , shows impressive beneficial responses with jak3 as their predominant target [ 7 , 8 ] .
nonetheless , ruxolitinib , a jak1 / 2 inhibitor , has also proven its efficacy [ 9 ] .
aa and lp also displayed a strong jak3 expression .
in aa , jak1 and jak2 were to a lesser extent also elevated .
the resulting downstream cascade seems based on the expression levels mainly conducted by pstat2 .
this is remarkable as aa is considered to be a ifn - gamma driven disease which would result in jak1 , jak2 and stat1 activation .
in this regard , it is important to notice that the landmark paper of xing et al [ 32 ] did also found jak3 as the only jak overexpressed in human aa compared to controls .
moreover , in their mice experiments jak3 inhibition also slightly outperformed jak1 / jak2 antagonism .
in a case report , a patient receiving tofacitinib for psoriasis experienced remission of his longstanding alopecia universalis [ 33 ] .
currently , there are phase ii trials ongoing to assess tofacitinib in alopecia areata ( nct02197455 , nct02553330 ) .
little is known about jak expression in lp. nonetheless , the jak3 and jak1 overexpression which was especially present in the inflammatory infiltrate indicate that jak1 / 3 inhibition might be a successful approach in lp. in cle , only a jak1 overexpression was found in the dermis .
this is in accordance with the results of li et al involving patients with systemic lupus erythematosus displaying pstat1 protein activation in their inflammatory malar rash [ 34 ] .
in ad an pg , all three jaks and stats were overexpressed .
as pg is a highly inflammatory disorder this might not be surprising .
in ad , jak research is still in its early phase .
nonetheless , murine experiments and a small human trial demonstrated the potential of tofacitinib in recalcitrant atopic dermatitis [ 35 , 36 ] .
in atopic dermatitis , il - 4 is the main involved interleukin [ 20 ] and may phosphorylate different jaks in several cell types [ 37 ] .
in human b lymphocytes , il - 4 induces phosphorylation of jak1 and jak3 [ 38 ] .
in the studied diseases , jak2 did not emerge as pivotal therapy target as pjak2 was only overexpressed in the inflammatory dermal cells of ad and pg. regarding the systemic jak inhibitors , analysis of clinical trials using jak inhibition in the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory diseases attributed hematological side effects to jak2 blockade and suggested selective jak1 / 3 inhibition to increase efficacy and safety [ 39 ] .
our results indicate that the role of jak2 in isd pathophysiology is probably limited , considering the low expression of jak2 in isds .
a striking reduced expression of tyk2 and ptyk2 was found at the epidermal level .
the importance of tyk2 in inflammatory diseases is based on genetic polymorphisms and murine experiments with knockout mice demonstrating its role in il22 and il23 - mediated signaling in psoriasis [ 40 ] .
however , increased tyk2 expression has been scarcely reported and tyk2 downregulated mrna has been previously observed in psoriasis [ 26 ] .
this suggests a complex regulation of tyk2 in vivo .
this study of jak / stat expression in some prevalent isds was retrospective , what prevented the collection of all clinical characteristics of the patients , and had a small sample size .
nevertheless , there was a comparable population among the groups ( except for ad , which affects younger patients ) and the immunohistochemical findings were validated by qpcr for psoriasis .
moreover , we conducted an extensive validation of the used antibodies by cell stimulation and inhibition experiments .
conclusion the development of alternative strategies in the treatment of isds is desirable , as there is an unmet therapeutic need .
in this context jak blockers have emerged as a promising option for topical or systemic therapy .
the topical formulation makes these drugs more attractive for dermatological purposes as they offer an improved safety profile .
our study evidenced that pan - jak inhibitors seem the most appropriate approach in pg and ad , based on the jak expression levels .
in contrast , aa , psoriasis and lp carry mainly a jak3 signature which suggests that specific jak3 inhibition could be sufficient .
in cle , further research on the efficacy of jak1 inhibitors is warranted .
considering the epidermal expression levels , our results show most evidence for topical jak3 inhibitors in isds .

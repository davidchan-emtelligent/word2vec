summary transcription factor fusion proteins can transform cells by inducing global changes of the transcriptome , often creating a state of oncogene addiction .
here , we investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in this process , focusing on ewing sarcoma cells that are dependent on the ews - fli1 fusion protein .
we established reference epigenome maps comprising dna methylation , seven histone marks , open chromatin states , and rna levels , and we analyzed the epigenome dynamics upon downregulation of the driving oncogene .
reduced ews - fli1 expression led to widespread epigenetic changes in promoters , enhancers , and super - enhancers , and we identified histone h3k27 acetylation as the most strongly affected mark .
clustering of epigenetic promoter signatures defined classes of ews - fli1 - regulated genes that responded differently to low - dose treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors .
furthermore , we observed strong and opposing enrichment patterns for e2f and ap - 1 among ews - fli1 - correlated and anticorrelated genes .
our data describe extensive genome - wide rewiring of epigenetic cell states driven by an oncogenic fusion protein .

published : february 27 , 2015 introduction fusion proteins are a common cause of cancer .
they often establish a state of oncogene addiction that makes cancer cells vulnerable to losing the fusion protein 's biological function ( macconaill and garraway , 2010 ) .
direct pharmacological inhibition has been highly effective for certain kinase fusion proteins but is difficult for transcription factor fusions ( mitelman et al. , 2004 ) .
it is therefore important to understand the regulatory mechanisms in fusion - protein - driven cancers in order to identify indirect ways of interfering with these oncogenes .
here , we focus on epigenetic deregulation as a mechanism by which an oncogenic fusion protein may rewire cells for malignancy ( chen et al. , 2010 ) .
we mapped the genome - wide dynamics of chromatin marks in a cellular model that is dependent on the ews - fli1 fusion protein .
ews - fli1 is the most common initiating event in ewing sarcoma , a pediatric cancer for which few therapeutic options exist ( bernstein et al. , 2006 ) .
this oncogenic fusion protein originates from a chromosomal translocation that fuses the activator domain of the rna binding protein ews to the dna binding domain of the fli1 transcription factor ( delattre et al. , 1994 ) , and its expression results in upregulation and downregulation of several hundred target genes ( kovar , 2010 ) .
ewing sarcoma has a lower rate of somatic mutations than most cancers ( brohl et al. , 2014 ; crompton et al. , 2014 ; huether et al. , 2014 ; lawrence et al. , 2013 ; tirode et al. , 2014 ) , suggesting that ews - fli1 - driven tumors may be particularly dependent on deregulation of the epigenome .
to study ews - fli1 - associated epigenetic changes , we performed comprehensive epigenome mapping in ewing - sarcoma - derived cells , following the standards of the international human epigenome consortium ( http :// ihec - epigenomes.net ) .
integrative bioinformatic analysis identified significant associations between ews - fli1 binding and the chromatin states of promoters , enhancers , and super - enhancers .
we also compared the epigenomes before and after knockdown of the ews - fli1 fusion protein , allowing us to define clusters of ews - fli1 - regulated genes .
we validated the relevance of our gene clustering by measuring the transcriptome response to epigenome - modulating drugs , and we identified ews - fli1 - specific enhancer and super - enhancer signatures that are dependent on ews - fli1 expression .
our results highlight the prevalence , complexity , and dynamics of epigenome and transcriptome rewiring orchestrated by ews - fli1 , and they provide initial insights into the role of the epigenome in solid cancer cells that depend on an oncogenic fusion protein .
results reference epigenome mapping in a cellular model of ews - fli1 dependence epigenome mapping is a powerful method for cataloging functional elements throughout the genome ( bernstein et al. , 2012 ) , and it can provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie changes of cell state ( rivera and ren , 2013 ) .
to investigate the effect of ews - fli1 expression on epigenetic cell states , we mapped the epigenome of an ewing sarcoma cell line ( a673 ) that has emerged as a standard model for systems biology in ewing sarcoma ( http :// www.ucd.ie / sbi / asset ) .
this cell line is ews - fli1 dependent and was previously engineered to harbor a doxycycline - inducible small hairpin rna against ews - fli1 ( carrillo et al. , 2007 ) .
these cells retain a low level of ews - fli1 expression after knockdown , thus allowing us to compare , in an isogenic setting , the epigenomes of ews - fli1 - high and ews - fli1 - low cell states without causing extensive cell death ( figure 1a ) .
we established reference epigenome maps comprising dna methylation , seven histone marks ( h3k4me3 , h3k4me1 , h3k27ac , h3k56ac , h3k36me , h3k27me3 , and h3k9me3 ) , open chromatin states , and rna levels .
dna methylation was mapped both by whole - genome bisulfite sequencing ( wgbs ) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ( rrbs ) , histone marks by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( chip - seq ) , open chromatin states by assay for transposase - accessible chromatin with high - throughput sequencing ( atac - seq ) , and rna levels by strand - specific rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) .
each experiment was performed in two biological replicates each for both the ews - fli1 - high state ( cells in normal growth conditions ) and the ews - fli1 - low state ( 53 hr after adding doxycycline to induce knockdown of ews - fli1 ) .
we also performed rna - seq in cells that were treated with each of three histone deacetylase inhibitors to further dissect the relevance of histone acetylation in our model .
in total , we generated 61 datasets and sequenced 2.9 billion reads comprising 221 billion base pairs ( table s1 ) .
to facilitate data access and reuse by other researchers , we developed a website for online exploration and data download ( http :// tomazou2015.computational - epigenetics.org ) .
our dataset can be used to view and investigate the epigenetic changes in ews - fli1 - dependent cells one gene at a time ( figure 1b ) or to study patterns of epigenetic and transcriptional deregulation on a more global level , for example by annotating known and novel non - coding transcripts and alternative promoters that are ews - fli1 dependent ( figure s1 ) .
hierarchical clustering of the chip - seq and atac - seq data showed high consistency between experiments of the same type ( figure 1c ) .
we also observed the expected separation into repressive histone marks ( h3k9me3 and h3k27me3 ) , transcription - associated histone marks ( h3k36me3 ) , and open - chromatin - associated marks ( h3k4me3 , h3k4me1 , h3k27ac , h3k56ac , and atac - seq signal ) .
for the dna methylation data , which were combined from wgbs and rrbs experiments , we observed high correlation between replicates ( figure 1d ) and broad coverage throughout the genome ( figure 1e ) .
the correlation among biological replicates was equally high for the rna - seq data ( figure 1f ) , and we were able to identify a small number of transcripts and splicing isoforms that appear to be specific to this cell type ( figures 1g and s1 ) .
in aggregate , these observations confirm the high technical data quality of the reference epigenome maps that we generated .
significant association of gene expression , ews - fli1 binding , and open chromatin ews - fli1 is known to act as a transcriptional activator ( bailly et al. , 1994 ; ohno et al. , 1993 ) , but it also represses genes - - indirectly by activating transcriptional repressor genes and potentially also directly by recruiting repressive protein complexes ( hahm et al. , 1999 ; prieur et al. , 2004 ; sankar et al. , 2013 ) .
to investigate the genome - wide association among gene expression , ews - fli1 binding , and chromatin states , we stratified all genes by their rna levels ( figure 2a , top ) and by the distance from the transcription start site ( tss ) to the nearest ews - fli1 binding peaks ( figure 2a , bottom ) , which were mapped previously ( bilke et al. , 2013 ) , and we plotted average chip - seq intensities for each histone mark around the tss ( figures 2a and s2 ) .
promoters of highly expressed genes and those bound by ews - fli1 had high levels of the open - chromatin - associated marks h3k4me3 , h3k27ac , and h3k56ac .
these marks also showed the characteristic dip at the tss that is indicative of nucleosome - free regions ( encode project consortium , 2012 ) , and they overlapped with a peak of open chromatin in the atac - seq data .
h3k4me1 was similarly enriched in the wider promoter region but depleted in immediate vicinity of the tss , reflecting its mutual exclusivity with h3k4me3 .
furthermore , h3k36me3 levels were high in genic regions directly downstream of the tss of genes that were highly expressed and bound by ews - fli1 , whereas the repressive histone marks h3k9me3 and h3k27me3 were depleted in the promoters of these genes ( figures 2a and s2 ) .
promoters with distal ews - fli binding ( 5 - 40 kb from the tss ) were no more enriched for the open - chromatin marks h3k4me3 , h3k27ac , and h3k56ac than those showing no ews - fli1 binding within 40 kb from the tss , but they were more strongly depleted for the repressive - histone marks h3k27me3 and h3k9me3 .
combining gene expression data with ews - fli1 binding , we observed that proximal and distal binding of ews - fli1 were both associated with higher rna levels ( figure 2b ) , suggesting that ews - fli1 acts as a transcriptional activator not only when it binds in direct vicinity to the tss but also at enhancers outside of the promoter region .
proximal binding sites of ews - fli1 carried the characteristic histone patterns of promoter regions ( figure 2c ) , whereas distal ews - fli1 binding sites showed the chromatin signature of active enhancers with high levels of h3k27ac and h3k4me1 , low levels of h3k4me3 , and a dip in h3k27ac levels at the binding site ( figure 2d ) .
h3k27ac was consistently associated with ews - fli1 binding , both for promoter regions and for distal enhancer elements .
to identify dna methylation patterns associated with ews - fli1 binding , we thus compared dna methylation levels of h3k27ac peaks with and without ews - fli1 binding , and we observed significantly lower dna methylation levels among the ews - fli1 - bound regions ( figure 2e ) .
this result is consistent with recent evidence that active transcription factors can reduce dna methylation at their binding sites ( stadler et al. , 2011 ) .
collectively , our results support a strong association of ews - fli1 binding with high gene expression , open chromatin , nucleosome depletion , and reduced dna methylation .
these patterns hold true for both promoters and enhancers and for both proximal and distal binding .
we did not observe widespread co - localization of ews - fli1 with repressive chromatin , suggesting that the repressive effect of ews - fli1 observed for a sizable fraction of its target genes ( figures 3a and 3b ) is either indirect or caused by the depletion of active histone marks .
chromatin - based clusters of ews - fli1 - dependent transcripts several studies mapped ews - fli1 target genes using expression microarrays and / or chip - seq analysis of ews - fli1 binding ( bilke et al. , 2013 ; kauer et al. , 2009 ; prieur et al. , 2004 ; riggi et al. , 2008 ; smith et al. , 2006 ; tirode et al. , 2007 ) .
both approaches are useful but limited in their insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms .
we hypothesized that epigenome maps could help identify distinct modes of transcriptional regulation , and we devised a bioinformatic approach to classify genes in a way that takes biological knowledge about chromatin regulation into account ( figure s3 ; supplemental experimental procedures ) .
first , we identified all genes that were significantly downregulated or upregulated upon ews - fli1 knockdown , according to our rna - seq data ( figure 3a ) .
to emphasize that the regulatory relationship with ews - fli1 may be direct or indirect , we refer to these genes as " ews - fli correlated " and " ews - fli1 anticorrelated " rather than " ews - fli1 activated " and " ews - fli1 repressed. " in total , 1,287 transcripts were significantly correlated with ews - fli1 ( i.e. , more highly expressed in the ews - fl1 - high state than in the ews - fli1 - low state , which is equivalent to downregulation upon ews - fli1 knockdown ) , and 1,446 transcripts were significantly anticorrelated ( i.e. , more highly expressed in the ews - fli1 - low state , which is equivalent to upregulation upon ews - fli1 knockdown ) ( figure 3b ) .
in a second step , we annotated all correlated and anticorrelated transcripts with chip - seq intensity levels in their promoter regions , focusing on the five histone marks that are generally associated with gene promoters ( figure 3c ) .
we then clustered the transcripts based on their histone marks in the state where they are more lowly expressed ( correlated transcripts : ews - fli1 - low state after ews - fli1 knockdown ; anticorrelated transcripts : ews - fli1 - high state before ews - fli1 knockdown ) .
to that end , an initial step of unsupervised clustering was followed by expert classification of selected transcripts and supervised prediction of cluster membership for all transcripts ( figure s3 ) .
cluster 1 comprises transcripts carrying all four active - promoter marks ( h3k4me3 , h3k4me1 , h3k27ac , and h3k56ac ) , but not the repressive h3k27me3 mark ; cluster 2 transcripts carry both h3k4me3 and h3k4me1 but lack the histone - acetylation marks ; cluster 3 transcripts are marked by h3k4me1 only ; and cluster 4 is characterized by the repressive mark h3k27me3 in the presence or absence of h3k4 methylation .
using a logistic regression model for predicting cluster membership , most correlated and anticorrelated transcripts ( 82 % and 80 %) were placed unambiguously in one of the four clusters ( figures 3d and 3e ) .
examples of ews - fli1 - anticorrelated transcripts for each of the four clusters are shown in figures 3f - 3i .
functional characteristics and chromatin dynamics of ews - fli1 - regulated transcripts to validate the biological relevance of our chromatin - based gene clusters , we analyzed gene set enrichment and overlap of their promoters with catalogs of regulatory elements .
each cluster showed specific enrichment patterns , which were similar among ews - fli1 - correlated and anticorrelated transcripts .
cluster 1 promoters were highly enriched for polymerase binding and transcription initiation activity in a broad range of cell types ( figure 4a ) , and they were also enriched for cpg islands ( figures 3d and 3e ) , which tend to associate with strong and widely active promoters .
cluster 2 promoters had lower overlap with cpg islands and a strong association with tissue - specific patterns of open versus repressed chromatin and with binding of tissue - specific transcription factors .
cluster 3 comprised tissue - specific genes that lack cpg islands .
finally , cluster 4 transcripts were strongly enriched for polycomb repressive complex 2 binding across many cell types .
in addition to the enrichment patterns that were shared between ews - fli1 - correlated and anticorrelated clusters , we also observed interesting differences .
for example , ews - fli1 promoter binding was more common for ews - fli1 - correlated transcripts ( i.e. , those that are downregulated after knockdown of ews - fli1 ) than for anticorrelated transcripts ( figures 3d , 3e , and 4a ) .
furthermore , when comparing each ews - fli1 - correlated cluster to the corresponding ews - fli1 - anticorrelated cluster ( figure 4b ) , we observed a striking enrichment for binding of e2f transcription factors among the ews - fli1 - correlated transcripts , reinforcing a previously reported link between ews - fli1 and e2f ( bilke et al. , 2013 ) .
the ews - fli1 - correlated transcripts were also enriched for proliferation gene sets , consistent with the ability of ews - fli1 to accelerate cell growth .
in contrast , anticorrelated transcripts were enriched for gene sets that are characteristic of adult stem cells and for binding of both components of the ap - 1 transcription factor , fos and jun .
the chromatin - based gene clusters not only showed distinct patters of functional enrichment but also responded differently to ews - fli1 knockdown ( figure 4c ) .
among the ews - fli1 - correlated transcripts , h3k27ac was most strongly reduced at cluster 1 promoters after ews - fli1 knockdown , whereas h3k4me3 and h3k4me1 signals were largely retained even in the ews - fli1 - low state .
in contrast , clusters 2 and 3 showed reduced levels for all three marks ( h3k4me3 , h3k4me1 , and h3k27ac ) , and cluster 4 promoters underwent relatively minor changes upon ews - fli1 knockdown .
the ews - fli1 - anticorrelated clusters showed a more uniform response across clusters with increases in h3k4me3 and h3k27ac ( figure 4d ) .
together , these observations indicate that ews - fli1 expression promotes transcription of its target genes in at least two distinct ways : first , by further increasing h3k27ac levels and transcription of genes that are already widely expressed in proliferating cells ( correlated cluster 1 ) ; and second , by establishing or maintaining the chromatin signature of active promoters ( h3k4me3 , h3k4me1 , and h3k27ac ) at cell type specific genes that would otherwise be silent in these cells ( correlated clusters 2 and 3 ) .
furthermore , the relatively uniform response among the anticorrelated clusters indicates that ews - fli1 mediated repression involves mechanisms that decrease h3k27ac in similar ways across all four ews - fli1 anticorrelated clusters .
based on these promoter - centric analyses , h3k27ac and , to a lesser degree , h3k4me3 and h3k4me1 emerged as the histone marks that were most strongly affected by ews - fli1 knockdown .
this result was corroborated by western blots for all seven histone marks in additional ewing sarcoma cell lines ( tc252 , sk - n - mc , and st - et - 7.2 ) , where we observed a global reduction in h3k4me3 and h3k27ac levels upon knockdown of ews - fli1 ( figure 4e ) .
these data indicate that the global and ews - fli1 - dependent increase of active chromatin may represent a key mechanism of transcriptional rewiring in ewing sarcoma cells .
cluster - specific transcriptional response to treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors given that h3k27ac was most variable between the chromatin - based gene clusters and also most dynamic upon ews - fli1 knockdown ( figures 3 and 4 ) , we hypothesized that the clustered genes should respond differently to induced global changes of acetylation , which would support the clusters' usefulness for identifying distinct modes of gene regulation among ews - fli1 target genes .
to test this hypothesis , we treated the cells with histone acetyltransferase ( hat ) inhibitors and histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors .
these experiments were done for both the ews - fli1 - high and the ews - fli1 - low cell state , and they used drug concentrations that were low enough to avoid broad toxicity .
none of the three hat inhibitors that we tested ( c646 , cpth2 , and anacardic acid ) had an effect on cell survival or gene expression at the chosen concentrations ( data not shown ) ; hence , we focused our analysis primarily on the hdac inhibitors ( figures 5 and s4 ) .
hdac inhibitors are being evaluated as drug candidates for ewing sarcoma ( arnaldez and helman , 2014 ) , but here we used them solely as a chemical biology tool for validating our gene clustering , and at much lower concentrations than if our goal were to selectively kill ews - fli1 - expressing cells .
for two out of three hdac inhibitors tested - - namely , romidepsin ( fk - 228 ) and entinostat ( ms - 275 ) , but not vorinostat ( saha ) - - we were able to identify concentrations that fulfilled all three criteria that were crucial for our experiment : ( 1 ) no effect on cell viability ( figures 5a and s4a ) , ( 2 ) global increase in histone acetylation levels ( figure 5b ) , and ( 3 ) no effect on ews - fli1 expression levels as a potential confounder ( figure 5b ) .
we performed rna - seq to measure the transcriptome response to each hdac inhibitor at the chosen concentrations ( figures 5c - 5e , s4b , and s4c ) .
both romidepsin and entinostat specifically upregulated the expression of ews - fli1 - anticorrelated transcripts in cells with high ews - fli1 levels , suggesting that the ( direct or indirect ) repressive effect of ews - fli1 is partially reversed by treating ews - fli1 - high cells with hdac inhibitors .
among the anticorrelated transcripts , cluster 1 was least affected by treatment with hdac inhibitors , most likely because cluster 1 promoters already carried high levels of h3k27ac and may therefore be less sensitive to hdac inhibition ( figures 5d and s4c ) .
in contrast , clusters 2 , 3 , and 4 carried low levels of h3k27ac in the ews - fli1 - high state and responded more strongly to treatment with hdac inhibitors .
examples for each of the four clusters are shown in figure 5f .
among the ews - fli1 - correlated genes , there was no global trend in either direction ( figure 5c ) , but we observed strong cluster - specific differences in the ews - fli1 - low state ( figures 5e and s4b ) .
clusters 2 and 4 were consistently upregulated in response to hdac inhibition , whereas no such trend was observed for cluster 3 , and cluster 1 genes were even slightly downregulated .
specific examples are shown in figure 5g .
these results indicate that ews - fli1 activates certain genes in cluster 2 and 4 by interfering with hdac function , and treatment with hdac inhibitors appears to recapitulate this effect in ews - fli1 - low cells .
widespread reprogramming of enhancers and super - enhancers by ews - fli1 our promoter - centric analysis ( figures 3 and 4 ) established h3k4me3 and h3k27ac as the two histone marks that were most strongly associated with ews - fli1 expression .
h3k4me3 is a prototypic promoter mark , and the observed changes in h3k4me3 were indeed located almost exclusively in promoter regions. by contrast , not only does h3k27ac occur in promoter regions ( where it tends to overlap with h3k4me3 ) , but it is also a defining mark of active enhancers when occurring in the absence of h3k4me3 ( creyghton et al. , 2010 ; rada - iglesias et al. , 2011 ) .
we therefore investigated the effect of ews - fli1 expression on h3k27ac beyond gene promoters , comparing h3k27ac patterns before and after knockdown of ews - fli1 across the genome .
in total , 15,300 h3k27ac peaks showed significantly lower intensity in ews - fli1 - low cells (" ews - fli1 correlated peaks ") , and 18,727 h3k27ac peaks showed significantly higher intensity (" ews - fli1 anticorrelated peaks ") .
27 % of correlated peaks and only 6 % of anticorrelated peaks overlapped with promoter regions ( figures 6a and s5a ) , indicating that the majority of ews - fli1 - associated h3k27ac peaks are located at enhancer elements outside of promoter regions .
we observed striking differences between ews - fli1 - correlated and anticorrelated h3k27ac peaks , which became apparent when we stratified all peaks by the strength of h3k27ac signal difference upon ews - fli1 knockdown .
among ews - fli1 - correlated enhancers , only 10 % of the top 20 % most differential h3k27ac peaks were located in promoters , whereas 62 % of the bottom 20 % peaks ( which are still significantly different for h3k27ac between the ews - fli1 - high and low states ) were located in promoters ( figure 6b ) .
no such differences were observed for ews - fli1 - anticorrelated peaks , of which 5 % and 7 % were located in promoters .
we also identified strong differences in ews - fli1 binding , with 77 % of the top hundred ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peaks being ews - fli bound , while the percentage for ews - fli1 binding fell to 20 % when calculated across all ews - fli1 - correlated peaks and to only 1 % for ews - fli1 - anticorrelated peaks ( figure 6c ) .
finally , for the other histone marks tested we observed much lower overlap of ews - fli1 ( figure s5b ) , indicating that ews - fli1 primarily drives h3k27ac at selected promoters and enhancers throughout the genome .
our observation that the strongest ews - fli1 - correlated enhancers were qualitatively different from other h3k27ac peaks is reminiscent of super - enhancers ( hnisz et al. , 2013 ; loven et al. , 2013 ; whyte et al. , 2013 ) .
we therefore investigated whether super - enhancers occur in ews - fli1 expressing cells and how they might respond to ews - fli1 knockdown .
using a published method for h3k27ac - based annotation of super - enhancers ( loven et al. , 2013 ; whyte et al. , 2013 ) , we identified 697 super - enhancers in the ews - fli1 - high state and annotated them with their neighboring genes ( http :// tomazou2015.computational - epigenetics.org ) .
overall , more than 10 % of h3k27ac peaks in ews - fli1 - high cells were located in super - enhancers ( figure s5c ) , and super - enhancers had much higher cumulative h3k27ac enrichment than typical enhancers ( figure 6d ) .
this strong enrichment of h3k27ac was largely due to the exceeding length of super - enhancers ( median length of 27,818 base pairs as compared to 1,196 base pairs for typical enhancers ; figure s5d ) and not due to higher h3k27ac signal intensity per base pair ( figure s5e ) .
as illustrated in figure 6e , super - enhancers were essentially agglomerates of co - located h3k27ac peaks over a range of several dozen kilobases , while typical enhancers rarely comprised more than two h3k27ac peaks and were typically shorter than 2 kb. several of the top super - enhancers were located near genes with known roles in cell proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis .
we also observed widespread loss of h3k27ac upon knockdown of ews - fli1 for some super - enhancers ( figure 6e ) , while others displayed more localized changes affecting only those h3k27ac peaks that overlapped with ews - fli1 binding sites ( figure s5f ) .
interestingly , ews - fli1 binding sites and ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peaks were both more likely than other h3k27ac peaks to be located in super - enhancers ( figure s5g ) ; in addition , more than half of the super - enhancers in ews - fli1 - expressing cells contained at least one ews - fli1 binding event , and a similar fraction contained at least one ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peak ( figure s5h ) .
to assess the cell - type specificity of ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peaks , we studied their association with active regulatory elements in 72 human cell types , based on dnase hypersensitivity data ( sheffield et al. , 2013 ) .
our analysis uncovered a striking trend toward high cell - type specificity among the strongest ews - fli1 - correlated , ews - fli1 - bound , and super - enhancer - associated h3k27ac peaks ( figure 6f ) .
this trend was already visible for h3k27ac peaks in promoters and in typical enhancers , but the association with super - enhancers and overlap with ews - fli1 binding sites further increased the cell - type specificity ( figure 6g ) .
most notably , 37 % of the 2,322 strongest ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac enhancer peaks overlapped with dnase - hypersensitive sites present only in the one ews - fli1 expressing cell line that was part of the dnase dataset ( sk - n - mc ) and were thus unique to ewing sarcoma .
in summary , these results provide strong evidence that ews - fli1 not only regulates genes and promoters but also establishes highly cell - type - specific enhancers and super - enhancers in ews - fli1 - expressing cells .
discussion global epigenome dynamics in ews - fli1 - dependent cells in this study , we used a ewing sarcoma cell line with tunable ews - fli1 expression to uncover connections between this oncogenic fusion protein and the epigenome .
based on both chip - seq and western blots , h3k27ac emerged as the mark that was most strongly affected by ews - fli1 knockdown .
33,170 h3k27ac peaks were significantly altered throughout the genome ( figure 7a ) , and 80 % of the most strongly ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peaks were bound by ews - fli1 ( figure 6c ) .
in contrast , h3k27ac levels in regions that were not bound by ews - fli1 were either correlated or anticorrelated with ews - fli1 expression and likely driven by indirect mechanisms of transcription regulation .
similar but weaker patterns of ews - fli1 association were also observed for h3k4me3 and h3k4me1 ( figure 7a ) , while the other studied histone marks did not show widespread changes upon ews - fli1 knockdown .
differences in response to ews - fli1 knockdown were also notably absent for dna methylation ( figure 7b ) .
although this mark was anticorrelated with ews - fli1 binding ( figure 2e ) , no changes in dna methylation patterns were observed 53 hr after knockdown - - at a time point that should be sufficient for de novo methylation to have at least started .
hence , it seems possible that ewing sarcoma cells retain an epigenetic memory of prior ews - fli1 binding as part of their dna methylation patterns .
promoter regulation by ews - fli1 chromatin - based promoter analysis identified four clusters of ews - fli1 - correlated transcripts and four clusters of ews - fli1 - anticorrelated transcripts .
these clusters define three different regulatory modes ( figure 4 ) .
first , ews - fli1 - correlated cluster 1 genes , such as the cell - cycle regulator and proto - oncogene ccnd1 ( sanchez et al. , 2008 ) , were expressed even in the ews - fli1 - low state and carried all histone marks of active promoters , but their h3k27ac and transcription levels were higher in the ews - fli1 - high state ( figure 7c ) .
many of the correlated cluster 1 genes were associated with cell proliferation , suggesting that increased h3k27ac at widely expressed genes may drive the rapid proliferation of ews - fli1 - expressing cells .
second , the genes in ews - fli1 - correlated clusters 2 and 3 ( figure 4a ) were more tissue specific than genes in correlated cluster 1 , and they lacked active promoter marks such as h3k27ac and / or h3k4me3 in the ews - fli1 - low state .
ews - fli1 - dependent establishment of the missing histone marks may aberrantly activate these genes , as illustrated by the hematopoietic proto - oncogene myb that was specifically expressed in the ews - fli1 - high state ( figure 7d ) .
third , ews - fli1 - anticorrelated genes had higher h3k27ac levels in the ews - fli1 - low state independent of their cluster association and h3k27ac level in the ews - fli - high state ( figure 4d ) , which is illustrated by the ap - 1 component fosl1 ( figure 7e ) .
intriguingly , we observed broad enrichment for ap - 1 binding in other cell types among ews - fli1 - anticorrelated gene promoters ( figure 4b ) , suggesting that ews - fli1 may repress a sizable fraction of its target genes by interfering with the activating role of ap - 1 .
hdacs seem to play a role in the process , given the upregulation of ews - fli1 - anticorrelated genes ( clusters 2 , 3 , and 4 ) upon treatment with hdac inhibitors specifically in the ews - fli1 - high state ( figure 5d ) .
enhancer and super - enhancer regulation by ews - fli1 our analysis of h3k27ac resulted in a genome - wide catalog of ews - fli1 - associated enhancers and super - enhancers .
strikingly , the most dynamic enhancers upon ews - fli1 knockdown were also the most cell - type specific ( figure 6 ) , which is illustrated by the absence of any encode signal for h3k27ac at the ews - fli1 - bound enhancers upstream of the ccnd1 promoter ( figure 7c ) .
a large percentage of the observed ews - fli1 - correlated h3k27ac peaks overlapped exclusively with regulatory elements in sk - n - mc cells , which is the one ews - fli1 - expressing cell line in a published catalog with dnase hypersensitivity data for 72 human cell types ( p < 10 - 100 , fisher 's exact test ) .
ews - fli1 also appears to contribute to cell - type - specific enhancer signatures by converting broadly active enhancers to a poised state , as illustrated by the enhancer element upstream of the fosl1 locus ( figure 7e ) .
while our study was in revision , riggi et al. published conclusive evidence that ews - fli1 binds cis - regulating elements shared by ewing sarcoma cell lines and primary tumors ( riggi et al. , 2014 ) , suggesting that our observations are not only limited to cell lines but also relevant for ewing sarcoma biology in patients .
in summary , the establishment and analysis of reference epigenomes for ews - fli1 - high and ews - fli1 - low cells not only constitutes a first comprehensive epigenome dataset for a solid cancer that is driven by an oncogenic fusion protein , but it also provides relevant insights into the mechanisms by which a single oncogenic event has shaped a conductive epigenome .
the dataset is available for interactive exploration and data download ( http :// tomazou2015.computational - epigenetics.org ) , thus providing a genome - wide reference that can guide future work on regulatory mechanisms and epigenetic drug effects in ewing sarcoma .
experimental procedures for full details , see the supplemental experimental procedures .
epigenome mapping a673 cells were cultured as previously described ( carrillo et al. , 2007 ) .
dna , chromatin , rna , and protein were collected following standard procedures from untreated cells ( ews - fli1 - high state ) and 53 hr after adding doxycycline to the media ( ews - fli1 - low state ) .
to assess dna methylation , wgbs and rrbs experiments were performed using custom protocols ( see the supplemental experimental procedures for details ) , and the data of both assays were merged .
chip - seq experiments were performed using the ideal chip - seq kit ( diagenode ) according to manufacturer instructions .
atac - seq was performed as previously described ( buenrostro et al. , 2013 ) with minor adaptations for a673 cells .
rna - seq used illumina kits for strand - specific library preparation .
all sequencing was performed by the biomedical sequencing facility at cemm using illumina hiseq 2000 sequencers .
the epigenome maps as well as the raw and processed data underlying the presented analyses are available online at http :// tomazou2015.computational - epigenetics.org .
epigenetic gene clustering we clustered all ews - fli1 - associated genes based on the chip - seq signal intensity of five promoter - associated histone marks in the vicinity of the tss ( excluding h3k36me3 and h3k9me3 , which were rarely present in promoter regions ) , using a two - step semi - supervised clustering method .
multinomial logistic regression models were trained based on expert - curated examples and used to classify ews - fli1 - regulated genes derived from the rna - seq data .
we trained separate classifiers for identifying clusters among the ews - fli1 - correlated genes and among the ews - fli1 - anticorrelated genes .
enrichment analysis to functionally annotate the gene clusters , we identified significant overlap between gene sets derived from our dataset and gene sets obtained from several public databases ( see the supplemental experimental procedures for details ) .
in addition to gene - based enrichments , we also developed a method for region - based enrichment analysis called location overlap analysis ( lola ; http :// lola.computational - epigenetics.org ) , and we identified sets of functional elements that significantly co - localized with the promoters of a given gene cluster .
we used fisher 's exact test to establish significance , and odds ratios as well as p values were used to rank the results .
comparisons were done ( 1 ) against the background of all genes identified by our rna - seq analysis to identify enrichment patterns among ews - fli1 - regulated genes , ( 2 ) against the background of genes in other clusters to identify cluster - specific enrichment patterns separately for ews - fli1 - correlated and ews - fli1 - anticorrelated genes , and ( 3 ) against the background of genes in the same cluster but with opposite direction of ews - fli1 regulation ( correlated or anticorrelated ) to identify upregulation - versus downregulation - specific enrichment patterns separately for each cluster .

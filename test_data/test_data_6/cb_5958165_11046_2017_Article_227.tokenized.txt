this report describes the isolation of two environmental fungi : rhodotorula mucilaginosa and trichosporon jirovecii accompanied by pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli from a dog with bronchotracheitis .
all microorganisms were isolated routinely from a mucopurulent discharge , obtained during bronchoscopy from laryngotracheal area .
the initial identification of yeasts was confirmed by api candida and by molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer region .
administered antimicrobial treatment with marbofloxacin and canizol has brought the improvement in the dogs' health status .
the final results of control mycological culture were negative .
most probably underlying hypothyroidism and the use of steroids were the factors predisposing this patient to opportunistic infection of mixed aetiology .
as far as we are concerned , this is the first case of dogs' respiratory tract infection caused by r. mucilaginosa and t. jirovecii .
keywords rhodotorula mucilaginosa trichosporon jirovecii bronchotracheitis dog opportunistic mycosis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media b.v. , part of springer nature 2018 introduction rhodotorula and trichosporon yeasts belong to phylum basidiomycota .
both fungi are widely distributed in the environment [ 1 - 3 ] .
trichosporon species were isolated from fresh water samples obtained from rivers and lakes , seawater , soil and decomposed wood .
these fungi are also present in birds' and mammals' faeces [ 1 , 3 - 6 ] .
the members of trichosporon genus can colonize gastrointestinal tract , oral and nasal cavity or upper part of respiratory tract [ 3 ] .
quite frequently trichosporon species have been isolated from healthy skin , especially in the perigenital and perianal area [ 3 ] .
rhodotorula yeasts have been found in healthy cats [ 7 ] , rhesus macaques [ 8 ] , camels [ 9 ] and ostriches [ 10 ] .
the genus trichosporon was designated in 1865 by beigel , as the organism causing hair infection of mild intensity , what became the basis for the creation of the genus name .
nowadays , when phenotypic identification of yeasts is supported by genetic analysis , the genus consists of multiple species arranged in four clades : gracile / brassicae , porosum , cutaneum and ovoides [ 3 , 11 ] .
according to colombo et al .
[ 3 ] , the genus includes a total of 50 species .
sixteen of them , belonging to first three mentioned clades , have clinical relevance [ 3 ] .
among them are t. ashaii , t. inkin , t. jirovecii , t. ovoides , t. cutaneum and others .
the virulence factors shared by trichosporon species are the ability to form biofilm and production of multiple enzymes ( proteases , dnases , lipases ) , capable of destroying various components of host tissues .
moreover , one of the cell wall components - - glucuronoxylomannan ( gxm ) - - resembles gxm of cryptococcus neoformans and may facilitate the dissemination within the host organism and inhibit phagocytic activity of monocytes or neutrophils , thus increasing the yeasts pathogenicity [ 1 , 3 , 12 , 34 ] .
rhodotorula yeasts are also ubiquitous organisms , found in various ecosystems , e.g. seas , lakes and soil [ 13 - 15 ] .
they are also isolated from birds and animals [ 4 , 5 , 7 - 9 , 15 ] .
all of rhodotorula yeasts produce carotenoids , and their colonies develop a characteristic salmon pink colour [ 15 , 16 ] .
rhodotorula genus encompasses eight species .
three of them including r. mucilaginosa , r. glutinis and r. minuta are supposed to be opportunistic , as they have been isolated from clinical infections in humans and other animal species [ 2 , 11 , 15 , 17 - 21 ] .
krzysciak [ 22 ] have proved the presence of some of fungal virulence factors alike the production of extracellular enzymes in tested rhodotorula strains .
some r. mucilaginosa strains had significant activities of phospholipase and aspartyl protease , while others have been producing proteolytic enzymes .
also some of them have revealed resistance to common antimycotic agents [ 17 , 22 ] .
most of the tested strains were able to grow and to form the biofilm in serum in 37 degreesc , what is crucial in pathogenesis of fungal infections [ 22 ] .
additionally , rhodotorula and trichosporon fungi have been isolated from many unfavourable conditions , like hyperosmotic environments or located on high altitudes [ 13 - 15 , 23 , 24 ] .
they were also found in water samples , obtained from the baltic sea at depths between 201 and 444 m [ 15 , 25 ] .
some reports have noted their ability to decontaminate water and soil polluted by heavy metals or petroleum derivatives [ 26 - 28 ] .
all metabolic properties of both genera allow them for easier adaptation to various conditions .
at the same time , these adaptations make them capable of colonizing humans and other animal species [ 1 , 3 , 5 - 9 ] .
the increasing number of clinical reports strongly suggests that some species of rhodotorula and trichosporon have the potential to infect humans [ 1 - 3 , 29 ] .
additionally , there are references showing the pathogenicity of these yeasts for domestic and wild animals [ 18 - 21 ] , which authorizes their classification as the opportunistic and emerging pathogens .
in this work , we would like to present the case report , in which rhodotorula mucilaginosa and trichosporon jirovecii were isolated from the respiratory tract of a dog .
a case report a female dog , crossbreed , aged 10 years and 3 months , was submitted to the department of small animal diseases with clinic , in warsaw university of life sciences in november 2016 .
according to the medical history , the first clinical signs like cough followed by several incidences of dyspnoea , increased appetite and unwillingness to move were observed by the owner from march 2016 .
the previous treatment with steroids did not bring the clinical improvement .
due to the observed symptoms , hypothyroidism or heart problems were suspected .
during the medical examination , there were no auscultatory changes observed in the lungs .
commissioned x - ray examination of the chest showed no perceptible changes in the lungs or heart .
in contrast , blood biochemistry testing has confirmed the suspicion of hypothyroidism and showed elevated concentrations of liver enzymes .
other parameters were within normal limits .
oral administration of thyroid hormones together with withdrawal of steroids and proper diet was recommended .
applied treatment has resulted in a slight improvement in the health status , but in the next weeks incidences of cough intensified by the movement of animal have been observed several times per day .
subsequent laboratory tests carried out in january 2017 , showed no significant abnormalities in the image and blood counts and most of the biochemical parameters were at normal level , including the concentrations of thyroid hormones .
at the end of january 2017 , due to persistent cough , occurring several times per day and aggravated by animal movements , the bronchoscopy was recommended and performed under general infusion anaesthesia .
in this study , laryngeal oedema and mucopurulent discharge in laryngo - tracheal area , together with the first degree collapse of trachea and major bronchi , have been found .
during the endoscopy , the specimens for cytopathologic and microbiologic examinations have been taken .
materials and methods sample of laryngo - tracheal discharge obtained aseptically from dog 's trachea during the bronchoscopy was examined routinely for microorganisms .
clinical material was used to inoculate schaedler broth medium , columbia agar with 5 % of sheep blood ( ca ) and mcconkey agar ( mcc ) ( graso , poland ) .
all inoculated solid media were incubated in aerobic condition for 24 h in 37 degreesc .
the schaedler broth was incubated in anaerobic conditions in 37 degreesc for 48 h. also direct microscopic slide stained with gram method was prepared .
after the incubation , bacterial growth was evaluated and the identification was done based on the phenotypic properties .
clinical samples were also used for routine mycological examination with the use of sabouraud chloramphenicol agar ( biomerieux , france ) and sabouraud chloramphenicol agar supplemented with 0,7 % of cycloheximide .
inoculated media were incubated in 30 degreesc in aerobic conditions for 72 h , and the fungal growth was evaluated every 24 h. the primary identification was based on the morphology of the cells and the colonies .
it was confirmed by the api candida biochemical test ( biomerieux , france ) .
the antimicrobial susceptibility testing for isolated bacteria was performed on mueller - hinton agar ( graso , poland ) according to kirby - bauer disc diffusion method .
both isolated yeasts were also tested for antimycotic drug susceptibility , using the diffusion method performed according to the procedure recommended by the producer of mastring - s lab 504 / 1 rings ( mast diagnostics ) molecular identification to confirm the phenotypic identification of both isolated fungi , the sequencing of its1 - 5.8s - its2 regions was performed .
the pcr amplification of the internal transcribed spacer its 1 - 5.8s - its2 ribosomal dna region is widely used for identification of medically important yeasts and detection of dermatophytes in clinical specimens [ 30 , 31 ] .
the its region analysis is also suitable for interspecies differentiation and taxonomy studies of clinical , fungal isolates or environmental fungi , both yeast and mycelial species [ 6 , 26 , 30 , 32 ] .
genomic dna was extracted and purified using genomic mini ax yeast ( a & a biotechnology , poland ) according to the manufacturer procedure .
to amplify the its1 - 5.8s - its2 region , the conserved primers described previously by white et al .
[ 33 ] were used .
briefly , each reaction was performed by the addition of 4.5 mul of the dna and 0.75 mul of each primer ( 20 mum ) to 15 mul of 2xpcr master mix plus ( a & a biotechnology , poland ) and h2o in a total volume of 30 mul .
the amplification was performed in eppendorf mastercycler thermocycler with the following profile : one initial cycle of denaturation for 3 min at 94 degreesc , followed by 34 cycles of 30 s at 93 degreesc , 30 s at 50 degreesc and 45 s of extension at 72 degreesc .
the presence of specific pcr products of approximately 600 bp for rhodotorula spp. and 500 bp for trichosporon spp. was determined by electrophoresis in a 2 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide .
to purify the rest of pcr products , a clean - up concentrator kit ( a & a biotechnology , poland ) was used .
the purified products were sequenced in outside company - - genomed , poland .
all sequences were compared with sequences available in genbank using the blastn algorithm at national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) and centraalbureau voor schimmelcultures ( cbs ) database using pairwise sequence alignment .
results multiple , gram negative rods and yeast - like cells were observed in direct microscopic slide .
after 24 h of incubation in aerobic conditions , the two types of colonies were isolated on columbia blood agar and macconkey media .
the isolates were identified based on their phenotypic properties as e. coli ( non - haemolytic strain ) and pseudomonas aeruginosa .
there was no growth of anaerobic bacteria .
after 48 h of aerobic incubation of sabouraud chloramphenicol agar in 30 degreesc , multiple smooth , orange - pink , shiny colonies together with very small , white , dull colonies were observed ( fig. 1 ) .
additional 24 h of incubation allowed for better growth of white colonies ( fig. 2a ) .
microscopic slides prepared from both types of colonies , stained with methylene blue , have showed the presence of oval - shaped , yeast - like cells in pink colony and elongated blastospores in white , folded colony ( fig. 2b ) .
based on the morphology , the isolates were identified as rhodotorula sp. and trichosporon sp. the identification of both isolates was confirmed by api candida biochemical tests ( biomerieux ). fig. 1 abundant growth of yeasts' colonies from the sample of bronchial mucopurulent discharge obtained from dog ( sda ) .

x1000 additional identification of both strains to the species level was done by molecular methods .
extracted and purified dna was used to amplify the its1 - 5.8s - its2 rrna regions by the pcr protocol described above .
these fragments are recommended for the phylogenetical analysis of fungi [ 33 ] .
the obtained sequences were compared to the fungal sequences available in genbank ( ncbi ) and to cbs databases .
the comparison of first sequence has revealed a 99 % similarity ( 95 % of cover ) with the sequence of r. mucilaginosa strain iifcsw - b2 ( accession number : ky218730.1 ) .
the second sequence has showed 99 % identity ( 95 % of cover ) with the sequence of t. jirovecii strain atcc 34499 ( accession number : hm802131.1 ) .
antimicrobial testing results showed that both bacterial isolates were multiresistant .
they were resistant to most antimicrobials , which could be applied in the treatment of respiratory infections in dogs .
because of previously observed liver damage , the only possibility to treat bacterial infection was the use of marbofloxacin .
in antifungal susceptibility testing ( fig. 3 ) , after 24 and 48 h of incubation , the resistance of both isolates to flucytosine , amphotericin b and miconazole was observed , while both fungi were susceptible to econazole , clotrimazole and ketoconazole , as well as to natamycin .
all macrolide polyene antifungals were excluded from treatment : amphotericin b due to the resistance noted during the tests and both natamycin and nystatin because of their limited absorption from the gastrointestinal tract .
formulations of these two compounds available in poland are used mostly topically as the creams , lozenges or vaginal tablets .
finally , based on the noted high activity against both fungal isolates , oral administration of canizol ( ketoconazole ) in the dose of 100 mg two times per day was prescribed. fig. 3 drug susceptibility testing for both yeasts' strains ( mastring - s lab 504 / 1 ; mast diagnostics ) administered antimicrobial treatment has brought the improvement in the patients' health status , and the result of control mycological culture was negative .
discussion before the 1980s , the medical or veterinary reports mentioning rhodotorula and trichosporon as the aetiological agents of human or animals mycoses were sparse [ 1 , 2 , 15 , 34 , 35 ] .
during the last decade , the increasing number of articles reporting clinical cases of infections caused by these yeasts has been published [ 1 , 2 , 11 , 15 , 34 , 35 ] .
one of the most prevalent circumstances that increases the risk of invasive fungal infection is the use of central venous catheters ( cvcs ) and other indwelling medical devices .
the species of both genera are able to form biofilm on various materials used for their construction , e.g. polystyrene [ 1 , 12 ] .
similarly , rhodotorula is able to colonize shower curtains , tooth brushes , dialysis equipment , endoscopes [ 15 ] and hydratation sport tanks or drinking bottles [ 36 ] .
the formation of biofilm contributes on persistency of infection , being in fact the permanent source of fungal cells .
it also significantly raises the resistance to antifungal agents and restrains the treatment possibilities .
predominant type of human infections caused by two described yeast genera is fungemia connected with the necessary use of central venous catheters .
the most prevalent species of rhodotorula are : r. mucilaginosa , r. glutinis and r. minuta .
in the vast majority of these cases , there were underlying diseases predisposing to development of mycoses , e.g. haematological malignancies , cancer , chronic renal failure requiring continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( capd ) , gastrointestinal diseases or aids .
in the group with high risk of yeasts infections were the individuals undergoing long - term therapy with antibiotics or steroids , transplant receivers and neonates [ 2 , 11 , 15 , 34 ] .
besides the infections via cvc , other mycoses caused by rhodotorula yeasts have been noted .
some of them have developed superficially e.g. dermatitis , onychomycosis , oral infections and ulcers .
the others were localized in the internal organs - - the cases of meningitis , endophthalmitis , peritonitis , endocarditis , corneal or bone infections have been described [ 2 , 11 , 15 , 29 ] .
the trichosporon species may be involved in the aetiology of superficial infections and white piedra , as well as in mycoses located deeply in host organism , such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or invasive trichosporonosis [ 1 , 3 , 34 ] .
most frequently causative agent of superficial and invasive infections in humans are : t. inkin , t. cutaneum t. ovoides and t. loubierii , followed by t. ashaii , t. mucoides and t. asteroides [ 1 , 3 , 34 , 35 ] .
the most important reservoirs of microorganisms are gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts colonized by trichosporon species [ 35 ] .
moreover , in invasive trichosporonosis , the vast majority of patients shared some predisposing factors with individuals suffering from invasive rhodotorulosis .
in the group at high risk of severe deep - seated trichosporon infections are patients with haematological neoplasms and other cancers , especially those requiring the use of intravascular catheters or peritoneal dialysis , in which the colonized skin might be the additional source of fungi .
on the contrary , superficial infections and hypersensitivity pneumonia are found more frequently in immunocompetent hosts , but the sources of infections in these cases are still discussed .
the routes of infections are also unclear , but it is suggested that poor hygiene , close contact with contaminated water or infected individuals may increase the risk of trichosporonosis [ 3 , 34 , 35 ] .
despite many papers describing humans' infections caused by trichosporon and rhodotorula , there are only few reports about mycoses caused by these fungi in other animal species .
one of the first reports describing animal infections caused by rhodotorula was published in 1970 by beemer et al .
[ 37 ] and in 1980 by aruo [ 38 ] .
the authors presented data about skin rhodotorulosis in chickens [ 37 , 38 ] .
in 1992 , bourdeau et al .
[ 39 ] described the suspicion of rhodotorula dermatomycosis in cat with felv and fiv infection .
kadota with co - workers [ 21 ] reported the case of granulomatous epididymitis in a dog , in which rhodotorula glutinis was the aetiological agent .
agnetti with team [ 40 ] presented the case of a dog with generalized pyoderma and alopecia - crusted lesions , observed on the head , the ears , back and chest .
during the laboratory tests , the authors have isolated r. glutinis and confirmed the identification by api id32c test ( biomeriux ) and pcr .
the treatment with ketoconazole was successful and led to negative results of control cultures [ 40 ] .
also there is the clinical report announcing the mycosis caused by r. mucilaginosa in female sea lion [ 20 ] .
the probable source of infection could have been the water contaminated by rhodotorula yeasts , which have been found in seawater [ 15 ] additionally , in captive or zoo animals , the important factors predisposing to mycosis are various stresses connected with captivity .
trichosporon infections in animals seems to be rare .
dorlemann et al .
[ 41 ] described multiple invasive infections caused by trichosporon beigelii in the group of 56 laboratory rats .
the animals were specially prepared to drug trials for the treatment of pneumonia caused by pneumocystis carinii .
they received abnormal , low - protein diet and corticosteroid treatment ; thus , they were immunosuppressed .
the source of invasive t. beigelii infection was contaminated inoculum of pneumocystis , prepared from the lung tissue of rats with pneumocystosis .
in farm animals , the most frequent infections caused by the members of both described genera and other fungi are mastitis cases [ 18 , 19 , 42 ] .
in milk samples obtained in poland from cows with mastitis , we have isolated rhodotorula yeasts together with different species of candida [ 18 ] .
comparable findings have noted wawron and his team [ 19 ] .
fungi were isolated from milk samples obtained from mastitis cases in 7.07 % of all aetiological agents .
among them were : candida , trichosporon , rhodotorula and cryptococcus yeasts .
nearly the same genera were isolated in brasil , in sao paulo state during the survey done by costa et al .
[ 42 ] .
other bovine infections described in literature were cases of mixed fungal infections accompanying mixed parasitic infestations of ear canals .
in 11 % of positive mycological cultures , duarte et al .
[ 43 ] have isolated rhodotorula yeasts .
all mentioned medical reports show that yeasts from both genera have the wide range of adaptation abilities , what may predispose them to colonize the new ecological niches or hosts , both animals and humans .
despite the small number of published clinical veterinary reports , all presented literature data show that medical conditions occurring in animals are comparable to those in humans and can be the factors favouring opportunistic mycoses .
our work seems to be the first case report describing bronchotracheitis of mixed yeasts and bacterial aetiology in dog .
in this case , the factors predisposing the animal for the development of opportunistic mycosis were hypothyroidism , age of the animal and the steroid treatment .
the fact that clinical specimen was obtained from the trachea during aseptical bronchoscopy procedure may exclude the suspicion of contamination .
thus , our belief that the aetiological agents of bronchotracheitis were r. mucilaginosa and t. jirovecii followed by p. aeruginosa can be confirmed .
moreover , in our study , r. mucilaginosa and t. jirovecii are described for the first time as the aetiological agents of bronchotracheitis in dog .

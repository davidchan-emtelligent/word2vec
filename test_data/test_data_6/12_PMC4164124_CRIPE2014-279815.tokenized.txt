diprosopus is a rare congenital malformation associated with high mortality .
here , we describe a patient with diprosopus , multiple life - threatening anomalies , and genetic mutations .
prenatal diagnosis and counseling made a beneficial impact on the family and medical providers in the care of this case .
1. introduction advances in perinatal imaging and diagnostic tools often allow for recognition of complex , rare , and even life - threatening congenital malformations prior to birth .
prenatal diagnosis of these conditions provides time for earlier counseling and planning for perinatal management options .
guiding a family through this process can be difficult for the medical team , but is an attempt to improve the overall outcome and experience for everyone involved .
we present a case of diprosopus associated with multiple congenital malformations which were prenatally diagnosed .
the parents received extensive multidisciplinary , prenatal counseling allowing both the family and the medical providers to be well prepared for the birth and postnatal management .
2. case a 29 - year - old gravida 2 para 1 caucasian female was referred for maternal - fetal - medicine consultation at 26 - week gestation due to suspected fetal anomalies .
obstetrical ultrasound examination , confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , demonstrated craniofacial duplication , several abnormalities of the brain and skull , thoracolumbosacral dysraphism with neural tube defect and likely chiari ii malformation , large congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( cdh ) with liver and bowel noted in the left chest , hypoplastic left lung , and possible horseshoe kidney ( figure 1 ) .
fetal echocardiogram findings were consistent with tetralogy of fallot ( tof ) .
the parents had a multidisciplinary consultation with maternal - fetal medicine , neonatology , genetics , cardiology , radiology , and palliative care .
given the multiple , severe congenital anomalies , the medical team and family planned for limited resuscitative efforts and anticipated comfort care after birth .
a 2440 g male infant was delivered via repeat cesarean section at 36 - week gestation secondary to preterm labor .
at birth , the infant was pale and cyanotic with no spontaneous cry and poor tone .
he had shallow spontaneous respirations with poor aeration on auscultation .
the left mouth was small and fixed .
no glottis was visualized when the laryngoscope was inserted into the right mouth .
the infant was then wrapped in a warm blanket and given to the family to hold .
he died in his parents' arms a few minutes after birth .
the parents consented to a complete postmortem evaluation .
physical exam demonstrated complete facial duplication with tetrophthalmos ( four eyes ) , two noses , two mouths , two chins , and one fully formed ear on each side of the head with a hypoplastic pinna in the midline .
two anterior and two posterior fontanels were palpable .
there was also a ruptured myelomeningocele measuring 6.3 cm x 3.9 cm in the thoracolumbar region and a scaphoid abdomen .
the first and second toes of each foot overlapped and the nails were hypoplastic .
dissection of the cranial cavity revealed brain duplication with fusion of the parietal and occipital lobes of each brain .
the right and left brains fused at the mesencephalon and brainstem .
each brain had an optic chiasm , a pituitary gland , and a single large ventricle with loss of the ependymal lining and no third ventricle identified .
there was a single midbrain , rudimentary cerebellar tissue and fourth ventricle , atresia of the cerebral aqueduct with rudimentary and hypoplastic cerebral peduncles , bilateral absence of the corpus callosum , bilateral polymicrogyria , and dysplasia of the right and left cortices .
dissection of the thorax and abdomen revealed left cdh with intestine , stomach , spleen , and the left lobe of the liver herniated into the left pleural cavity with concomitant pulmonary hypoplasia .
cardiac findings included tof ( pulmonary atresia , ventricular septal defect , overriding aorta , and pulmonary arteries ) , atrial septal defect , patent ductus arteriosus , superior pulmonary veins draining to the left atrium ( no inferior pulmonary veins ) , dilated right atrium , and hypoplastic left atrium .
a common oropharynx connected two separate nasopharynxes and two separate oral cavities .
there was a single larynx and esophagus .
the intestines were malrotated with the appendix located in the left upper abdominal quadrant .
ectopic right and left kidneys were located in the lower abdomen and an accessory spleen was present .
testes were undescended bilaterally and the right testis was atrophic .
the placental pathology revealed normal fetal membranes and chorionic villi consistent with third trimester gestation with a two - vessel umbilical cord ( figure 2 ) .
whole - genome microarray - based comparative genomic hybridization ( acgh ) using oxford gene technology revealed a male karyotype ( 46 x,y ) , a 983 kb deletion on chromosome 4q34.3 , a 562 kb gain on chromosome xp22.31p22.2 , and a 32 kb gain on chromosome 13q12.11 .
quantitative polymerase chain reaction of maternal blood indicated the duplications on chromosomes xp22.31p22.2 and 13q12.11 were maternally inherited .
the 4q34.3 deletion was not maternally inherited , however .
unfortunately , due to the family 's financial burden , genetic testing was not completed on the father .
3. discussion diprosopus or craniofacial duplication is the rarest form of conjoined twinning , with an incidence of approximately 0.4 % of all types of conjoined twins [ 1 ] .
historically , two main theoretical embryologic explanations have been considered : either a " fusion " of two parallel notochords in close proximity occurs or a " fission " of a single notochord occurs during the first few weeks after conception [ 2 ] .
more recent theories include duplication of neural crest cell derivatives and mutations of the dix homeobox gene [ 3 , 4 ] .
a spectrum of diprosopus exists from a duplication of only the nose to complete facial duplication similar to that of our patient [ 5 ] .
many other congenital anomalies have been reported to occur in conjunction with diprosopus , including various neurologic , cardiac , pulmonary , skeletal , and gastrointestinal system defects [ 5 - 8 ] .
conjoined twins have a high mortality , especially if they have other major congenital anomalies [ 8 , 9 ] .
there have been no previous reports of genetic mutations associated with diprosopus .
the clinical significance of the maternally inherited duplications at xp22.31p22.2 and 13q12.11 is unknown .
there is a theoretical possibility of an x - linked recessive inheritance pattern since the x chromosome duplication has caused no disease or malformation in the mother , but this is unlikely as no reports of familial recurrence have previously been reported in the literature .
the 4q34.3 deletion has been associated with cardiovascular abnormalities such as tof [ 10 , 11 ] , but none of these genes are located in the deletion region in our case .
given the rare incidence of this disease and our inability to complete genetic testing of both parents , we are unable to conclude that any of the genetic findings are associated with our patient 's congenital malformations and the family was counseled accordingly .
however , a lack of genetic association for diprosopus continues to support an embryologic theory of abnormal twinning .
it should be noted that the prenatal diagnosis at 26 weeks somewhat limited perinatal management options .
however , the combination of detailed ultrasound and mri imaging provided accurate prenatal diagnoses so that the family and medical providers were able to develop a comprehensive plan of care in advance of the delivery .
almost three months before the birth , medical providers compassionately informed the family that a successful resuscitation was unlikely .
the parents asked that providers to make an attempt to resuscitate , but if unsuccessful , they wanted to hold and baptize their son .
during follow - up counseling , the family stated that the birth and death experiences were more peaceful than anticipated .
they felt that the medical , emotional , and spiritual support provided by the multidisciplinary team significantly reduced their anxiety , facilitated their decision - making , and , ultimately , aided them in coping with their loss .
conflict of interests the authors declare no conflict of interest .

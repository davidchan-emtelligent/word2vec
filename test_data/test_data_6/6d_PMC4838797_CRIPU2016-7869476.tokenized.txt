teratomas are germ cell tumors , manifested with a great variety of clinical features ; the most common extragonadal site is the anterior mediastinum .
in this case , we report the patient with a large mature mediastinal teratoma with several components of ectodermal and endothermal epithelium .
a 24 - year - old female patient presented with history of persistent chest pain and progressively aggravating dyspnea for the previous 3 months .
a chest x - ray showed a large opacity of the entire left hemithorax .
transcutaneous needle aspiration revealed a purulent fluid .
the tube thoracostomy was introduced and the effusion was evacuated .
some weeks later , patient was seen in emergency for persistent cough and lateral chest pain .
ct scan revealed a mass of the left hemithorax .
the mass showed heterogeneous density , without compressing mediastinum great vessels and left hilar structures .
lipase value was elevated in needle aspiration .
the patient underwent a total resection of the mediastinum mass via a left posterolateral thoracotomy .
microscopy revealed a mature teratoma with cystic structures .
the patient subsequently made a full recovery .
this case provide benign mediastinal teratoma with total atelectasis of left lung and elevated lipase value in needle transcutaneous aspiration ; this event is explained by pancreatic component in the cystic tumor .
total removal of the tumor is adequate treatment for this type of teratoma and the prognosis is excellent .
1. introduction germ cell tumors are pronominally found in gonads .
teratomas are classified to be composed of ectopic tissues from 2 or 3 germs layers , including mature , immature , or malignant components [ 1 ] .
most mediastinal teratomas produce no symptoms ; they are more commonly associated with compression of mediastinal structures ( great vessels , respiratory system ) .
teratomas mostly occur in young adults , with an approximately equal incidence in males and females [ 2 ] .
we present the case of a patient with mediastinal mature teratoma taken originally for empyema .
2. patient and observation a 24 - year - old female student patient was seen in the university hospital because of chest pain and dyspnea .
the patient had been in her usual health until several months before presentation when dyspnea , dry cough , fatigue , and lateral chest pain developed .
the patient had no history of medical or surgical problems ; she could independently perform activities of daily living , and she had no history of smoking or drinking alcohol .
on examination , the patient was normal , in no distress ; she spoke with a normal voice .
the blood pressure was 120 / 70 mm hg , the pulse was 64 beats per minute , oxygen saturation was 95 % while she was breathing ambient air , the weight was 57 kg , and the body mass index was 20.2 .
on chest auscultation , breath sounds on the left side were absent , with no clinically detectable lymphadenopathy ; the remainder of the examination was normal .
the chest x - ray showed a large opacity of the entire left hemithorax ( figure 1 ) .
thoracic ultrasound showed a large fluid collection of the left hemithorax .
in transcutaneous needle aspiration , the fluid removed was purulent .
therefore , tube thoracostomy was introduced , and the effusion was evacuated .
the control of chest radiograph was good ( figure 2 ) .
cytological analysis shows the presence of many polymorphonuclear structures , some altered without suspect cell .
the xpert mtb / rif detects no dna sequences specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis in fluid aspiration .
blood levels of glucose , total protein , creatinine , aspartate aminotransferase , and alanine aminotransferase were normal .
mantoux test , serology of hiv , and amebiasis were negative .
combination therapy with amoxicillin - clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin was begun .
bronchoscopy showed thickening of the interlobular spur and stenosis with extrinsic compression of the lingula 's apertures .
bronchial biopsies revealed no specific inflammatory reshuffle .
transthoracic echocardiography showed no pericardial effusion but heart was repressed by fluid chest training .
ent examination was normal .
the patient had good recovery and was discharged home .
few weeks later , the symptoms worsened , and new dyspnea on exertion and cough developed .
chest x - ray revealed opacity at the lower part of the left hemithorax ( figure 3 ) .
biochemical analysis of fluid aspiration showed protein 51 g / l , glucose 2.5 mmol / l , amylase 14 u / l , lipase 4920 iu / l , hyaluronic acid 12.9 mg / l , and ldh 1820 u / l. ct scan was obtained and showed a mass of the left hemithorax , which probably originated in the mediastinum and extended to the whole left pleural space ( figure 4 ) .
the mediastinum tumor markers ( alpha fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin ) were both normal .
the patient underwent a total resection of the mediastinum mass via left posterolateral thoracostomy and entry into the pleural space was performed ; the two pleural layers were intact .
many adhesions existed within the left pulmonary artery , the pericardium , and the diaphragm .
combination of blunt and sharp dissection for the division was applied uneventfully .
the tumor excised en bloc was pink - colored and well circumscribed ( figure 5 ) .
a tube thoracostomy was introduced .
the collapsed left lung was easily reexpanded , the patient was extubated and recovered well from the operation , and she was discharged on the 6th postoperative day .
pathological examination of the mass revealed mature teratoma with cystic structures lined by stratified squamous epithelium and at places cartilage , respiratory epithelium , pancreatic epithelium , urothelial epithelium , mucous secreting glands , muscle fibers , and epidermal cyst ( figures 6 and 7 ) .
3. discussion teratomas are germ cell tumors and they are uncommon neoplasms that arise in the gonads ; the mediastinum is the second most common extragonadal site of these tumors [ 3 , 4 ] .
they usually occur in the middle of the body , which is the route of germ cell migration during embryogenesis ; their migration can be misplaced en route to their appropriate organs , leading to the development of tumors later in life [ 5 ] .
in fact , several theories exist ; one of them suggests that benign teratoma is derived from the region of the third bronchial cleft or pouch .
a second theory states that these tumors arise from germinal nests of cells located along the urogenital ridge that failed to migrate to the gonads in embryological development [ 6 ] .
primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors ( nsgct ) are uncommon neoplasms and are clinically and biologically distinct from other germ cell tumors , and they are classified as a poor prognosis group in the igccc [ 7 ] .
rivera et al. demonstrate two prognosis factors of those tumors : the presence of residual viable cancer in tumor residue and the positivity of serum tumor markers ( alphafp or betahcg ) after surgical resection [ 8 ] .
the multimodality approach to primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor with intensive cisplatin - based chemotherapy , emphasis on normalizing serum tumor markers , and aggressive resection of residual disease offers survival to a significant number of patients [ 9 ] .
benign teratomas are often asymptomatic and are discovered on chest radiograph for unrelated reasons , but sometimes they give symptoms leading the patient to consult .
in the case reported , the patient had chest pain , dyspnea , and dry cough .
if symptoms are present , this will be because of the mass effect caused by mediastinal teratoma .
rarely , a patient may have expectoration of hair , and this is a pathognomonic symptom .
however , this distinctive symptom is extremely rare and occurs late in the natural history of this condition following tumor rupture into the tracheobronchial tree .
laboratory exams are often normal , and serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha - fetoprotein are always normal in patients with benign teratoma .
radiology exams reveal usually a well - circumscribed mediastinal mass that often protrudes into one of the lung fields .
pleural effusion also can be the most common ancillary ct finding in ruptured mediastinal teratomas .
pericardial effusion , especially in patients with a teratoma adhering to the pericardium , also appeared to suggest rupture of the tumor into the pericardium .
in the case under discussion , ct scan showed a mass of the left hemithorax extended to the whole left pleural space .
high level of amylase or lipase can be noted in pleural fluid that originated from a mediastinal teratoma and suggest pancreatic component in mediastinal mass .
surgical excision is the treatment of choice for mediastinal teratomas .
the aim of surgery is to achieve complete clearance of the tumor without damage to associated or adjacent structures .
this requires a careful and meticulous surgical dissection .
the prognosis of mature teratomas of the mediastinum is excellent after complete resection .
recurrences are rare , especially related to incomplete resection [ 10 - 12 ] .

micrornas ( mirnas ) play a critical role in many biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in human cancers .
particular mirnas function either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and appear to have diagnostic and prognostic significance .
although numerous mirnas are dys - regulated in colorectal cancer ( crc ) only a small fraction has been characterized functionally .
using high - throughput functional screening and mirna profiling of clinical samples the present study aims at identifying mirnas important for the control of cellular growth and / or apoptosis in crc .
the high - throughput functional screening was carried out in six crc cell lines transfected with a pre - mir library including 319 synthetic human pre - mirs .
phenotypic alterations were evaluated by immunostaining of cleaved cparp ( apoptosis ) or mki67 ( proliferation ) .
additionally , taqman human microrna array set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 mirnas in 14 normal colon mucosa and 46 microsatellite stable stage ii crc patients .
among the mirnas that induced growth arrest and apoptosis in the crc cell lines , and at same time were dys - regulated in the clinical samples , mir - 375 was selected for further analysis .
independent in vitro analysis of transient and stable transfected crc cell lines confirmed that mir - 375 reduces cell viability through the induction of apoptotic death .
we identified yap1 as a direct mir - 375 target in crc and show that hells and nolc1 are down - stream targets .
knock - down of yap1 mimicked the phenotype induced by mir - 375 over - expression indicating that mir - 375 most likely exerts its pro - apoptotic role through yap1 and its anti - apoptotic down - stream targets birc5 and bcl2l1 .
finally , in vivo analysis of mouse xenograft tumors showed that mir - 375 expression significantly reduced tumor growth .
we conclude that the high - throughput screening successfully identified mirnas that induce apoptosis and / or inhibit proliferation in crc cells .
finally , combining the functional screening with profiling of crc tissue samples we identified clinically relevant mirnas and mirna targets in crc .

introduction colorectal cancer ( crc ) is a common malignant disease and a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide .
the lifetime risk is about 5 % and rising [ 1 ] .
crc is caused by the accumulation of numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations .
chromosomal instability leading to allelic imbalance accounts for 70 - 85 % of the tumors whereas 20 - 15 % have dna mismatch repair defects leading to microsatellite instability .
the molecular alterations in crc have been intensively studied in order to discover diagnostic and prognostic markers .
among others , mrna expression profiling has been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes with prognostic and diagnostic implications .
however , at present none of these have been translated into clinical practice and consequently , there is still a need for further molecular characterization and classification of crc .
micrornas ( mirnas ) comprise an abundant class of small ( 19 - 24 nt ) , non - coding regulatory rna molecules [ 2 ] .
they play a critical role in the control of gene expression at the post - transcriptional level by complementary binding of the mirna strand to the mrna target sequence , leading to either mrna degradation or translational inhibition [ 3 ] .
more than 60 % of all protein coding genes contain conserved mirna binding sites and are thus potential targets of mirnas [ 4 ] .
mirnas have been shown to be involved in many biological processes such as cell proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation and angiogenesis [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] .
at present , mirnas have been shown to play important roles in many types of cancers ( reviewed by garzon et al. [ 8 ]) .
the role of mirnas in the development of crc has been intensively studied .
in 2006 , cummins and co - workers published the first detailed and systematic analysis of mirna expression in crc , showing up and down regulation of specific mirnas [ 9 ] .
since then several studies have confirmed the dys - regulation of mirnas in crc [ 10 ] - [ 15 ] .
nevertheless , our knowledge about the function of the individual mirnas is limited to a fairly small number of mirnas .
functional screening has been used to identify mirnas that are causally linked to specific phenotypes ( reviewed by izumiya et al. [ 16 ]) .
in crc , functional screening has been used in a few cases to identify mirnas affecting cell proliferation and death [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
however , the study performed by nakano et al. was carried out in one cell line only and their findings were not correlated to the expression of the mirnas in clinical crc samples .
finally , functional screening has identified clinically relevant mirnas in pancreatic and testicular germ cell tumors [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
the acknowledged diagnostic and prognostic potential of mirnas and a need for further systematic functional analyses of mirnas in crc encouraged us to combine high - throughput functional screening with mirna expression profiling in clinical samples .
ectopic expression of 319 mirnas in 6 different crc cell lines was combined with mirna expression profiling of 14 normal colon mucosa and 46 colorectal tumors .
these analyses identified a number of mirnas that were shown to be differentially expressed in crc and to have an impact on cellular proliferation and / or apoptosis in vitro .
among them mir - 375 was selected for further in vitro and in vivo analyses , which confirmed that mir - 375 reduces tumor growth through the induction of apoptotic death .
to identify potential mir - 375 mrna targets the expression of mir - 375 was correlated to genome - wide mrna expression profiles .
correlation analysis of both in vitro model systems and clinical crc samples revealed that expression of yes - associated protein 1 ( yap1 ) was negatively correlated to mir - 375 .
ago2 immunoprecipitation indicated that yap1 is a direct mir - 375 target in crc .
further functional studies indicated that the pro - apoptotic role of mir - 375 most likely is mediated by yap1 and its anti - apoptotic down - stream targets birc5 and bcl2l .
finally , lymphoid - specific helicase ( hells ) and nucleolar and coiled - body phosphor protein 1 ( nolc1 ) were identified as down - stream targets of mir - 375 potentially playing a role in cell cycle regulating pathways .

luciferase reporter assay transfected hek - 293t cells were analyzed using dual glo luciferase assay system ( promega ) as described previously [ 28 ] ( details are described in the supplementary material ( methods s1 )) .
luminescence was detected with a multiplate reader ; multiscan mcc / 340 ( thermofisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) .
the renilla luciferase activity was normalized to the firefly luciferase activity for each transfected well , to correct for differences in transfection and harvest efficiencies .
generation and characterization of stable hct116 cells with inducible mir - 375 expression the generation of stable hct116 cells with inducible expression of mir - 375 is described in detail in the supplementary material ( methods s1 ) .
initially , mir - 375 was cloned into the 3 ' utr region of the turbo red fluorescence protein gene ( trfp ) of the psbinducer10 vector ( mir375 _ psbinducer10 ) .
the psbinducer10 vector was constructed by replacing lentiviral elements in the pinducer vector [ 29 ] with sleepingbeauty inverted terminal repeats .
stable hct116 _ mir - 375 and hct116 _ scr cell pools were generated as follows .
firstly , 1.5x106 hct116 cells were transfected with pcmv - sb100xco ( vector with transposase ) and either mir375 _ psbinducer10 ( hct116 _ mir - 375 ) or scr _ psbinducer10 ( hct116 _ scr ) .
forty - eight hours post - transfection puromycin ( final concentration 1 microg / ml ) ( sigma ) was added to select for stably transfected cells .
the puromycin selection was carried out for 5 days .
subsequently , the cells were treated with 50 ug / ml doxycycline ( dox ) ( sigma ) for 48 hours leading to transcriptional activation of the trfp - mir375 cassette .
the trfp fluorescence marker was used as a surrogate to sort for cell populations expressing the highest level mir - 375 after induction of dox .
briefly , the cells with the highest trfp level ( 100 - 1000 times above the background level in untreated cells ) ( hct116 _ mir - 375h and hct116 _ scrh ) were isolated by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) using a 4 - laser facsariaiii ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) and used for all subsequent analyses .
dox dependent expression of mature mir - 375 in the hct116 _ mir - 375h cells was analyzed using rt - qpcr as describe earlier .
the hct116 _ mir - 375h cells were phenotypically characterized using xcelligence ( roche applied science ) , caspase 3 / 7 assays and yap1 western blotting ( details in supplementary material ( methods s1 )) .
in vivo tumor growth analysis hct116 _ mir - 375h cells ( 3.5x106 cells per injection ) were suspended in 200 microl pbs and injected subcutaneously into the left flank of anesthetized mice ( n = 12 ) .
the mice were divided into two groups with 6 animals in each : group a ; mir - 375 (+ dox ) and group b ; control ( - dox ) .
the tumors were measured regularly ( length and width ) by the same observer .
to induce expression of mir - 375 , dox ( vibradox sandoz )( 0,2 mg / ml ) was added to the drinking water of the mice in group a , when the tumors reached a size of approximately 50 mm3 .
the mice in group b were given ordinary drinking water .
the dox treatment was carried out for 14 days .
four mice were taken out of the study prior to the dox treatment ( two had very fast growing tumors and two had tumors that stopped growing ) i.e. n = 4 in group a and b. the estimated tumor volume ( ev ) was calculated as ev = lengthx ( width ) 2x1 / 2 .
ev was plotted against the number of days after initiation of dox treatment and xenograft growth curves were generated .
statistical analysis the significance of mirna expression changes were analyzed using the mann whitney u test in the multi experiment viewer ( mev ) array analyzer software [ 30 ] .
the hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed mirnas was performed using gene cluster 3.0 [ 31 ] .
only , mirnas that were expressed in more than 80 % of the samples were included .
heat maps were generated with java treeview [ 32 ] .
student 's unpaired t - test was applied to compare mirna induced changes with respective controls in the mtt assay , ldh assay , apoptosis assay , rt - qpcr analysis and in vivo tumor growth analysis .
the student 's paired t - test was used for the rt - qpcr analysis of microdissected tissue samples .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results high - throughput screening identifies a series of mirnas that induces apoptosis and / or inhibits proliferation in crc cell lines to identify mirnas with the most consistent impact on growth and / or survival of crc cancer cells we performed a high - throughput screening in six crc cell lines , using a library holding 319 synthetic human pre - mirnas .
pre - mir induced changes in cparp and ki - 67 were used to identify mirnas that induced apoptosis and / or inhibit proliferation respectively .
distributions of the z - scores for each pre - mir are shown in figure s1 .
the z - score rank products were used to identify consistency of the pre - mirna effects across all tested crc cell lines [ 33 ] .
the rank product top - 40 pre - mirs are listed in table s4 in file s2 ( increased cparp ) and table s5 in file s2 ( reduced ki - 67 ) .
several of the top - 40 ranked mirnas have previously been shown to affect either apoptosis and / or proliferation in vitro ( a subset of these are shown in table s6 in file s1 ) .
mirna expression profiling of clinical samples to address the in vivo significance of the mirnas identified in the high - throughput functional screening we profiled the expression of 667 unique mirnas in 14 normal colon mucosa and tissue samples from 46 clinical stage ii crc samples .
in total , 53 mirnas were differentially expressed between normal mucosa and crc ( mann whitney u test p <= 0.01 and 1.5 <= fc ( log2 )<= - 1.5 ) ( figure 1 and table 2 ) .
a subset of 25 mirnas showed increased expression in crc tumors relative to normal mucosa whereas 28 mirna were down - regulated in the crc tumors .
combining the results of the mirna profiling of clinical samples with the results of the high - throughput functional screening we identified 10 mirnas that were differentially expressed in clinical crc samples and at the same time induced phenotypic changes in the functional screening ( top - 40 ranked ) ( table 2 and table s6 in file s1 ) .
additionally , eight dys - regulated mirnas induced phenotypic changes in at least one cell line , but were not top - 40 ranked ( table 2 ) .
eleven of the above mirnas were down - regulated and hence these mirnas are tumor suppressor candidates .
finally , 20 of the dys - regulated mirnas were not included in the pre - mirna library from ambion and hence their ability to induce phenotypic changes cannot be analyzed in the present study ( table 2 ) .
in conclusion , we identified 11 mirnas that were down - regulated in crc samples and at the same time induced proliferation and / or inhibited apoptosis in crc cell lines and hence these mirnas are potentially involved in colorectal tumorigenesis .

validation of the phenotypes identified in the high - throughput screen to validate the identified phenotypes , the mirnas that were down - regulated in clinical samples and top - 40 ranked in the phenotype screen ( mir - 150 , mir - 375 , mir23b , mir - 138 , mir - 139 - 5p and mir - 9 ) were subjected to detailed functional analysis using hct116 , ht29 , ls174t tr4 , dld1 tr7 and sw480 colon cancer cell lines .
we have recently published a detailed functional analysis of mir - 139 - 5p and hence mir - 139 - 5p was not included in these analyses [ 25 ] .
the ectopic expression of mir - 375 , mir - 9 and mir - 138 significantly reduced the viability of more than one cell line ( mtt reduction > 20 % and p <= 0.05 ) ( figure 2a ( hct116 ) and figure s2 ) , possible due to a general anti - proliferative or pro - apoptotic role of these mirnas .
mir - 150 and mir - 23b only reduced the viability of one cell line ( dld1 tr7 ) .
among the remaining mirnas , mir - 375 was identified as an apoptosis inducing mirnas in the high - throughput screen .
to validate this finding , we carried out ldh and caspase 3 / 7 assays in transfected crc cell lines .
mir - 375 increased caspase 3 / 7 activity and demonstrated coincident increase in cellular death ( ldh release ) in both hct116 and dld1 tr7 ( figures 2b and c , and figure s3 ) .
furthermore , the apoptotic death induced by mir - 375 could be inhibited with z - devd - fmk ( caspase 3 / 7 inhibitor ) ( figure 2d ) demonstrating that the induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase 3 / 7 activity .
in conclusion , the validation analysis confirmed the anti - proliferative role of mir - 9 and mir - 138 , and the apoptosis inducing capacity of mir - 375 as identified in the high - throughput analysis .
the above mirnas have previously been shown to be dys - regulated in human cancers and to reduce proliferation and / or induce apoptosis in vitro ( table s6 in file s1 ) .
mir - 375 and mir - 138 have not been functionally characterized in detail in crc .
finally , mir - 375 , mir - 138 and mir - 9 were selected for further analysis due to their down - regulation in clinical samples and their ability to induced phenotypic changes in vitro .

the columns represent the mean expression in three samples +/ - sd. detection of mir - 375 , mir - 138 and mir - 9 in laser microdissected colorectal tissue to elucidate the cellular origin of mir - 375 , mir - 138 and mir - 9 , we measured their expression in laser captured microdissected colorectal adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal colon mucosa ( figure 2e and figure s4 ) .
these analyses showed that in normal colon mucosa mir - 375 was expressed at a higher level in the epithelial cells than in stromal cells ( p = 0.02 ) ( figure 2e ) .
whereas in the adenocarcinoma mir - 375 was expressed at comparable levels in epithelial and stromal cells ( p = 0.27 ) .
additionally , mir - 375 expression in normal epithelial cells was significantly higher than the expression in epithelial cells from adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.03 ) .
overall , these results indicate that the down - regulation of mir - 375 in crc is a result of a reduction in the mir - 375 expression in epithelial cells of the tumor .
mir - 9 and mir - 138 were expressed primarily by stromal cells from both normal colon mucosa and adenocarcinomas ( figure s4 ) .
these results are consistent with previously published mirna expression profiles of laser - microdissected normal mucosa , adenomas and adenocarcinomas [ 34 ] .
the clearly epithelial origin of the high mir - 375 expression in normal colon mucosa and the down - regulation of mir - 375 in epithelial cells from adenocarcinomas led to the selection of mir - 375 for further analysis .
validation of mir - 375 down - regulation in clinical samples the down - regulation of mir - 375 in stage ii crc observed in the present study was confirmed in an independent cohort ( cohort 2 ) of 25 normal colon mucosa samples and 63 primary crcs of different stages ( stage i - iv , t2 - 4 , n0 - 3 , m0 / 1 ) ( figures s5a and b ) .
mir - 375 was significantly down - regulated not only in stage ii tumors ( p = 0.0002 and absolute fc = 4.9 ) but also in the cohort as a whole combining tumors of different stages ( p = 0.0002 and absolute fc = 4.5 ) .
on the contrary , mir - 375 was not differentially expressed between the tumors of different stages .
additionally , mir - 375 has previously been shown to be down - regulated in different cohorts of crc samples [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] and in several other human cancers ( see table s6 in file s1 for references ) indicating that the down - regulation of mir - 375 is a general event in tumor development .
mir - 375 methylation analysis in crc cell lines and clinical crc samples mir - 375 is an intergenic mirna and is associated with a cpg island indicating that this mirna may be down - regulated by epigenetic silencing .
previous studies have shown that mir - 375 is indeed down - regulated due to hypermethylation in esophageal and breast cancer [ 37 ] - [ 40 ] .
hypermethylation of mir - 375 has also been demonstrated in melanoma and in the crc cell line hct116 cell [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
these data encouraged us to study the methylation of mir - 375 in crc cell lines and clinical crc tissue samples using infinium humanmethylation450 beadchips .
we specifically look at the methylation level of 11 cpg sites situated in close vicinity to the pri - mir - 375 transcription start site [ 41 ] .
these cpg sites are situated mainly in the genomic regions that have previously been analyzed using bisulfite sequencing [ 38 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 42 ] .
methylation analysis of eight crc cell lines confirmed a high methylation level of 5 / 11 cpg sites in hct116 .
additionally , sw480 and colo205 were highly methylated at 1 / 11 cpg sites whereas the other cells lines demonstrated no methylation of the 11 cpg sites ( figure 3a ) .
mir - 375 expression analysis demonstrated that hct116 , sw480 and colo205 all exhibited lower expression of mir - 375 than the cell lines with no methylation ( figure 3b ) .
on the contrary , infinium humanmethylation450 beadchip methylation analysis of normal colon mucosa with paired adenomas or adenocarcinomas did not identify any hypermethylation of mir - 375 in the adenomas and adenocarcinomas ( figure 3c ) , although mir - 375 was down - regulated ( fc ( log2 )> 1.5 ) in 7 / 12 pairs ( figure 3d ) .
these results indicate that epigenetic silencing of mir - 375 is not the general mechanism of mir - 375 down - regulation in crc .

regulation of mir - 375 by beta - catenin / tcf4 activity a previous study , has suggested a direct link between beta - catenin activation and mir - 375 repression in hepatocellular tumors [ 43 ] .
furthermore , results from our laboratory have shown that mir - 375 is up - regulated upon inhibition of beta - catenin / tcf4 activity in the dox inducible dominant negative ( dn ) tcf4 dld1 cell line ( dld tr7 ) , which has been used as a model to study wnt regulation of mirnas in crc [ 25 ] .
we therefore asked whether we could detect chromatin occupancy of beta - catenin / tcf4 complexes at tcf4 sites in proximity to the mir - 375 hairpin .
we identified two tcf4 sites within 80 - 90 kb of the mir - 375 hairpin and analyzed the binding of tcf4 to both sites using a chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) approach with polyclonal tcf4 antibody in dld1 tr7 cells ( figure s6 ) .
myc 3 ' enhancer region located at 3 ' of the myc gene has previously been reported to be bound by tcf4 ( positive control ) whereas the exon 2 of the myoglobin gene is not bound by tcf4 ( negative control ) [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
although , we did find that tcf4 bound to the myc enhancer region , we did not detect any tcf4 binding at the mir - 375 locus .
hence our data do not support the hypothesis that mir - 375 expression is directly modulated by chromatin - bound beta - catenin / tcf4 complexes .
identification of mir - 375 targets using transcription profiling in order to elucidate the mechanism behind the induction of apoptotic death by mir - 375 we set out to identify mir - 375 targets .
initially , we analyzed the expression of mature mir - 375 in hct116 transfected with a mir - 375 mimic at different time points post transfection ( figure 4a ) .
a significant up - regulation of mature mir - 375 was observed 24 hours post - transfection .
subsequently , genome wide microarray transcription profiling of hct116 cells over - expressing mir - 375 was carried out to screen for target candidates regulated at the transcriptional level .
as expected , more mrnas were down - regulated than up - regulated as a result of mir - 375 ectopic expression ( figure 4b ) .
integration of the transcription data with in silico target prediction revealed , that mirnas harboring mir - 375 seed matches in the 3'utr were more frequently down - regulated than mrnas with no seed match ( figure 4b ) .
furthermore , the average number of 7mer - m8 motifs per 3'utr was enriched among down - regulated mrnas ( figure 4c ) .
the same tendency was also evident when the target region was expanded to the full length mrna ( data not shown ) , which is in agreement with functional target sites also being located within open reading frames [ 46 ] .
to gain insight into the over - all biological changes introduced by the ectopic expression of mir - 375 , the most effected transcripts ( p - value < 0.05 , fc ( log2 )< - 1.0 or > 1.0 ( 206 genes ) or fc ( log2 )< - 0.5 or > 0.5 ( 1236 genes )) were analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) software .
this analysis demonstrated significant associations to specific biological functions such as cell death , cell cycle , cellular growth and , proliferation , which are all highly relevant for the observed growth inhibitory phenotype ( figure s7 ) .
subsequently , we analyzed whether mrnas that had previously been identified as direct mir - 375 targets in other tissue were affected in hct116 cells upon up - regulation of mir - 375 .
using tarbase6.0 , we identified nine mrnas , which had all been identified as direct mir - 375 targets using luciferase reporter assay ( table 3 ) [ 47 ] .
interestingly , six of these known mir - 375 targets were also significantly down - regulated in hct116 upon mir - 375 ectopic expression .
the remaining three targets were either not expressed in hct116 ( median log intensity < 7 ) ( 1 / 8 ) or not present on the array ( 2 / 8 ) ( table 3 ) .
the above results support the notion that identical mirna targets respond in similar ways to mirna overexpression in cell lines originating from various tissues .

identification of biological relevant mir - 375 targets using clinical crc samples to identify biologically relevant mir - 375 targets , we set out to analyze the correlation between the expression of the above identified putative mir - 375 targets and mir - 375 in clinical crc samples ( normal colon mucosa n = 10 and adenocarcinoma n = 11 ) .
in all , 224 genes had at least one 7mer - m8 , 7mer - m1 or 8mer mir - 375 seed match in their 3'utr and were down - regulated ( fc ( log2 )<= - 0.5 and p < 0.05 ) upon mir - 375 ectopic expression. of these , 18 genes were significantly up - regulated in crc compared to normal mucosa and showed a negative correlation to mir - 375 ( pearson <= - 0.6 ) ( table s7 in file s1 ) .
most strikingly , yap1 was found to be negatively correlated to mir - 375 in crc tissue samples indicating that targeting of yap1 by mir - 375 is also relevant for the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer ( table 3 and table s7 in file s1 ) .
recently , a yap1 containing transcription factor complex has been shown to positively regulate the anti - apoptotic genes birc5 ( survivin ) and bcl2l1 [ 48 ] .
interestingly , like yap1 we found that birc5 and bcl2l1 were down - regulated as a result of mir - 375 up - regulation in hct116 ( fc ( log2 ) : - 0.9 ( birc5 ) and - 0.7 ( bcl2l1 ) and p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore both birc5 and bcl2l1 were negatively correlated to mir - 375 in clinical samples ( pearson = - 0.6 ) .
these results indicate that mir - 375 may act as an upstream regulator of birc5 and bcl2l1 through the targeting of yap1 .
stimulated by the observation that our in silico / in vitro approach accurately identified many known direct mir - 375 targets , we decided to investigate if yap1 and two other mir - 375 target candidates hells and nolc1 were directly regulated by mir - 375 in crc cells .
initial analysis confirmed the down - regulation of hells , nolc1 and yap1 at the mrna and protein level in response to ectopic mir - 375 expression in hct116 cells ( figures 4d - f ) .
the reduction was 40 - 50 % both at the mrna and protein level .
in addition , down - regulation of the yap1 downstream targets birc5 ( 54 %) and bcl2l1 ( 72 %) as a result of mir - 375 ectopic expression was also confirmed at the rna level ( figure 4e ) .
yap1 has previously been shown to be a direct mir - 375 target in liver cells using a luciferase reporter assay [ 49 ] .
to add evidence for the direct interaction of mir - 375 and yap1 in crc cells , we performed ago2 immunoprecipitation ( ago2 - ip ) using lysates from mir - 375 and scr transfected hct116 cells followed by yap1 expression analysis of immunoprecipitated rna .
these analyses clearly demonstrate an ago2 dependent immunoprecipitation of yap1 and showed that the amount of immunoprecipitated yap1 is enriched in the mir - 375 transfected cells compared to scr transfected cells ( figures 4g ( input ) and h ( ip )) .
the expression of mir - 375 in the input and ip fractions is shown in figures s8a ( input ) and b ( ip ) .
the ago2 - ip analysis provided strong evidence that yap1 is indeed a direct mir - 375 target in crc cells .
we next sought to elucidate whether hells and nolc1 were directly or indirectly targeted by mir - 375 .
luciferase reporter assay using hells and nolc1 3'utrs and a mir - 375 mimic demonstrated no binding of mir - 375 to the wt 3'utr of hells and nolc1 ( data not shown ) .
these results indicate that hells and nolc1are probably downstream targets in the cellular pathways affected by mir - 375 .
yap1 knock - down affects the expression birc5 and bcl2l1 and mimics the phenotypes induced by mir - 375 to further analyze the role of yap1 down - regulation in the phenotypes induced by mir - 375 ectopic expression , yap1 was silenced in hct116 cells using two different sirnas .
the knock - down efficiency of the sirnas was more than 70 % both at the mrna and protein level ( figures 5a and b ) .
furthermore , like mir - 375 ectopic expression , silencing of yap1 resulted in down - regulation of birc5 (~ 30 %) and bcl2l1 (~ 40 - 50 %) further emphasizing the role of mir - 375 and yap1 in the regulation of these molecules in hct116 cells ( figure 5a ) .
next we analyzed whether the silencing of yap1could reduce the viability of hct116 cells through induction of apoptosis thus mimicking the phenotype induced by mir - 375 .
indeed , elimination of yap1 significantly reduced the viability and induced caspase 3 / 7 dependent apoptotic death in hct116 cells ( figures 5c - e ) .
the phenotype induced by the mir - 375 mimic was more pronounced than that induced by the yap1 sirnas , probably reflecting that yap1 only represents one out of a number of critical nodes in the pleiotropic mir - 375 network .
we conclude that down - regulation of yap1 mimics the apoptotic phenotype induced by mir - 375 ectopic expression .

knock - down of hells and nolc1 partly mimic the phenotype induce by mir - 375 to investigate whether the mir - 375 induced repression of hells and nolc1 play a role in the phenotype induced by mir - 375 , we specifically silenced these mrnas in hct116 cells using two independent sirnas to each target .
the knock - down efficiency of the sirnas was 70 - 80 % at the protein level and at the mrna level ( figures 6a and b ) .
next we analyzed whether knock - down of hells and nolc1 could reduce the viability of hct116 and induce a pro - apoptotic phenotype , thus mimicking the phenotype induced by mir - 375 .
indeed , individual elimination of hells and nolcl1 reduced the viability and induced cellular death in a manner similar to mir - 375 ectopic expression ( figures 6c and d ) but did not induce apoptotic death ( figure 6e ) and hence other mir - 375 targets such as yap1 are responsible for the apoptotic phenotype .
in conclusion , reduced expression of hells and nolc1 only partly mimic the phenotypes induced by mir - 375 10.1371 / journal.pone.0096767.g006 figure 6 individual knock - down of hells and nolc1 reduces both mrna and protein expression in hct116 cells .

characterization of stable hct116 with inducible mir - 375 expression and in vivo tumor growth to analyze the effect of mir - 375 on tumor growth in vivo hct116 cells stably transfected with a polycistronic dox - inducible expression cassette , producing both trfp and mir - 375 , was generated .
the initial pool of stably transfected cells exhibited varying levels of trfp upon dox induction ( data not shown ) .
in order to obtain a pool of cells with a more uniform expression of trfp , and thus mir - 375 , upon dox induction , we applied facs sorting .
cells with trfp expression levels 100 - 1000 times above the background level in untreated cells ( hct116 _ mir - 375h and hct116 _ scrh ) were isolated and used in all subsequent analyses .
compared to untreated hct116 _ mir375h cells dox treated cells induced an eighteen - fold increase in mir - 375 expression level .
while no mir - 375 expression was observed in the hct116 _ scrh cells +/ - dox , a minor level of mir - 375 expression was observed in the untreated hct116 _ mir - 375h cells ( figure 7a ) , which could indicate a minor leakage from the mir - 375 - trfp expression cassette in the absence of dox .
however , the phenotypic characterization of hct116 _ mir - 375h cells clearly showed that dox treatment significantly reduced the cell proliferation and induced caspase 3 / 7 dependent apoptosis in the hct116 _ mir - 375h cells when compared to hct116 - scrh cells or untreated hct116 - mir - 375h cells ( figures 7b - d ) .
in addition , the yap1 protein was specifically down - regulated in dox treated hct116 _ mir - 375h cells ( figure 7e ) .
in vivo tumor growth was analyzed in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of hct116 _ mir - 375h cells .
the growth of tumors in dox treated mice was compared to the growth in untreated animals .
in accordance with the in vitro results , the results of the in vivo analysis clearly indicate that mir - 375 expression reduces tumor growth ( figure 7f ) .
all together , the above results strongly indicate that mir - 375 has the ability to suppress tumor growth through the induction of apoptosis .

discussion traditional expression profiling of mirna in cancer tissues identifies differentially expressed mirnas which may act either as " passenger " or " drivers " in tumorigenesis .
functional screening on the contrary identifies mirnas that result in cancer associated phenotypes likely to act as " driver " mirnas .
however the functional assays are performed in cell lines with the risk of identifying candidate mirnas that are not important for tumor development in vivo .
in the present study we have combined the mirna expression profiling in crc tissue samples with functional screening thereby making it possible to identify clinically relevant mirnas and mirna targets in crc , which may eventually be used as biomarkers or therapeutic targets .
high - throughput functional screening of mirnas has previously been carried out in cell lines originating from testicular germ cell tumors , pancreatic cancer and crc [ 17 ] - [ 20 ] .
most of these studies were performed using only one cell line and only cekaite et al. related their findings to the expression of the mirnas in clinical samples [ 18 ] .
in the present study the functional screening was performed in six different crc cell lines allowing us to identify both general mechanisms in colorectal cancer and cell lines specific effects .
our results clearly demonstrate the importance of combing the functional screening with profiling of tissue samples since many of the top - 40 ranked mirnas were either not differentially expressed or not expressed in crc tissue samples .
in accordance with this only one out of 23 mirnas ( mir - 483 - 5p ) identified in a previous functional screen using the crc cell line dld1 [ 17 ] was significantly dys - regulated in the crc samples in the present study .
furthermore , some of the mirnas differentially expressed in clinical samples only exhibited a phenotype in one of the cell lines analyzed and would have been missed if we had not run a panel of cell lines .
we selected mir - 375 for detailed functional characterization and target identification .
in addition to the results of the present study , down - regulation of mir - 375 has been demonstrated in several types of cancer including crc [ 35 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 49 ] - [ 51 ] .
the mechanism behind mir - 375 down - regulation has been studied in several cancers .
originally , mir - 375 hypermethylation was reported in cell lines originating from breast and gastric cancer [ 38 ] , [ 52 ] .
methylation analysis in melanoma and esophageal cancer later confirmed that methylation played a role in mir - 375 down - regulation not only in cell lines but also in tissue samples [ 37 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 42 ] .
in crc mir - 375 promoter methylation has only been demonstrated in the cell line hct116 [ 39 ] .
additionally , mir - 375 has also been shown to be up - regulated upon 5 - aza - 2 ' - deoxycytidine treatment in hct116 and to a less extent in dld1 [ 53 ] .
thorough analysis of mir - 375 methylation and expression in crc cell lines and tissue samples only identified mir - 375 promoter methylation and concurrent mir - 375 down - regulation in three crc cell lines including hct116 .
none of the tissue samples demonstrated mir - 375 promoter methylation although mir - 375 was clearly down - regulated in a subset of the samples indicating that in vivo mir - 375 is mainly regulated by other mechanisms than hypermethylation in crcs .
we cannot rule out that methylation of other cpg sites than the ones addressed in the present study are important for mir - 375 down - regulation in crc , however , previous methylation analysis of mir - 375 has demonstrated homogenous methylation throughout the analyzed genomic regions , making this unlikely .
alternatively , it has been suggested that mir - 375 might be regulated negatively by the wnt pathway [ 25 ] , [ 43 ] .
the chip analysis carried out in the present study , however , demonstrated that mir - 375 is most likely not under direct beta - catenin / tcf4 control and rather suggest that yet unidentified downstream targets of the wnt pathway affect mir - 375 expression in crc .
to address the functional role of mir - 375 , we and others have carried out in vitro phenotype analyses .
in the present study , mir - 375 was shown to reduce viability and to induce caspase 3 / 7 dependent apoptotic death in crc cell lines .
the reduction of cellular viability by mir - 375 has previously been shown in cell lines from several cancers , [ 40 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 54 ] whereas the apoptotic phenotype has been demonstrated in cells from gastric and esophageal cancer [ 37 ] , [ 52 ] .
in addition , suppression of colony formation and reduced migration and invasion has also been linked to mir - 375 expression [ 37 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 49 ] .
recently , mir - 375 was also shown to play a role in cell cycle regulation through the inhibition of g1 / s transition in hct116 cells [ 54 ] .
to study the effect of mir - 375 on tumor growth in vivo hct116 cells stably transfected with an inducible mir - 375 expression - cassette were used to generate mouse xenograft tumors .
induction of mir - 375 expression significantly reduced the growth of the tumors confirming the results from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in which mir - 375 was shown to effectively suppress tumor formation and metastasis [ 42 ] .
overall , the frequent down regulation of mir - 375 in cancer and the phenotypic characterization of mir - 375 in vivo and in vitro clearly emphasize its tumor suppressive role and have encouraged the search for mir - 375 targets mediating the tumor suppressive effects .
at present , ywhaz , jak2 , pdk1 and yap1 have been identified as cancer relevant direct mir - 375 targets in human gastric , esophageal and liver cancer using luciferase reporter assays [ 37 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 55 ] . among others , yap1 is up - regulated in many epithelial cancers , and is mainly known as an effector of the hippo signaling pathway involved in cell growth , division and apoptosis [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] , whereas up - regulation of ywhaz has been shown to be associated with low mir - 375 expression and reduced overall survival in gastric cancer [ 58 ] .
in the present study , only yap1 demonstrated an inverse correlation with the expression of mir - 375 both in vitro and in clinical crc samples .
additionally , knockdown of yap1 using sirnas mimicked the apoptotic phenotype induced by mir - 375 .
to study the binding of mir - 375 to yap1 in a physiologically relevant manner we carried out ago2 - ip. these analyses showed that yap1 is enriched in immunoprecipitates from mir - 375 transfected cells compared to scr transfected cells in an ago2 dependent manner , thus providing strong evidence that yap1 is indeed a direct mir - 375 target in crc cells .
recently , yap1 has been suggested to be part of a complex required for survival of beta - catenin driven cancers including crc [ 48 ] .
a complex consisting of the transcription factor tbx5 , yap1 , beta - catenin and yes1 was found to regulate the expression of the anti - apoptotic genes birc5 and bcl2l1 .
interestingly , both birc5 and bcl2l1 were up - regulated in crc tissue samples and down - regulated as a result of mir - 375 up - regulation or sirna silencing of yap1 in hct116 in the present study .
thus down - regulation of birc5 and bcl2l1 may among others explain the apoptotic phenotype induced as a result of mir - 375 ectopic expression .
we hypothesize that mir - 375 exerts its tumor suppressive role partly by acting as an upstream regulator of birc5 and bcl2l1 through the targeting of yap1 ( figure 8 ) .
mir - 375 has also been shown to inhibit g1 / s transition in hct116 [ 54 ] .
in the present study , we identified several genes related to cell cycle progression among the clinically relevant putative mir - 375 targets , including hells and nolc1 .
hells is overexpressed in many human tumors and has been shown to hinder cell cycle re - entry and cellular growth whereas nolc1 expression is crucial for the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinomas [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
we showed that hells and nolc1 were down - regulated both at the mrna and protein level as a result of mir - 375 ectopic expression .
additionally , their knock - down reduced cell viability and induced cellular death mimicking the phenotype induced by mir - 375 , although they were not identified as direct mir - 375 targets using a luciferase reporter assay .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0096767.g008 figure 8 model of the role of mir - 375 in the regulation of apoptotic death .
in conclusion , combing high - throughput functional screening with mirna profiling of crc tissue samples , we have identified clinically relevant mirnas in colorectal cancer including mir - 375 .
we showed that methylation of mir - 375 is not a common mechanism behind mir - 375 down - regulation in crc .
finally , mir - 375 target analysis demonstrated that the pro - apoptotic role of mir - 375 by may be exerted through direct targeting of yap1 resulting in down - regulation of the anti - apoptotic genes birc5 and bcl2l1 .

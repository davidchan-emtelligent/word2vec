mir - 543 has been implicated as having a critical role in the development of breast cancer , endometrial cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma .
however , the exact clinical significance and biological functions of mir - 543 in colorectal cancer ( crc ) remain unclear .
here , we found that mir - 543 expression significantly downregulated in tumors from patients with crc , apcmin mice and a mouse model of colitis - associated colon cancer .
mir - 543 level was inversely correlated with the metastatic status of patients with crc and the metastatic potential of crc cell lines .
moreover , ectopic expression of mir - 543 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of crc cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting kras , mta1 and hmga2 .
conversely , mir - 543 knockdown promoted the proliferation , migration and invasion of crc cells in vitro and augmented tumor growth and metastasis in vivo .
furthermore , we found that mir - 543 expression was negatively correlated with the levels of kras , mta1 and hmga2 in clinical samples .
collectively , these data show that mir - 543 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of crc cells by targeting kras , mta1 and hmga2 .
our study highlights a pivotal role for mir - 543 as a suppressor in the regulation of crc growth and metastasis and suggests that mir - 543 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for crc metastasis .
mir - 543 colorectal cancer metastasis proliferation microrna introduction as one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide , colorectal cancer ( crc ) has become the fifth leading cause of cancer death for men and women in china [ 1 ] .
distant metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer - related mortality in patients with crc , and the 5 - year survival rate for metastatic crc is only 10 - 15 % [ 2 - 5 ] .
therefore , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in crc metastasis will provide diagnostic and prognostic markers and potential targets for the therapeutic intervention of crc metastasis .
it has been demonstrated that several key molecular events , including mutations in kras , aberrant activation of the wnt and pi3k pathways and tp53 inactivation , are involved in the initiation and progression of crc [ 6 - 9 ] .
in addition to genetic aberrances , epigenetic alterations such as changes in microrna ( mirna ) deregulation and chromatin structure contribute to the development of crc [ 10 ] .
mirnas are endogenous noncoding regulatory rnas that inhibit gene expression at the post - transcriptional level by binding to the 3 ' - untranslated - region ( 3'utr ) of target mrnas [ 11 , 12 ] .
although great advances have been achieved in elucidating the specific roles of mirnas in the initiation , progression and metastasis of crc , the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive [ 5 , 10 , 13 ] .
as a member of a mirna cluster located in the imprinted dlk1 - dio3 region on human chromosome 14 , mir - 543 has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and endometrial cancer [ 14 , 15 ] , whereas it was found to promote the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 16 ] .
however , none of the previous studies has systematically investigated the functions of the mir - 543 in the progression of crc .
in this study , we evaluated the clinical significance and biological functions of mir - 543 using clinical crc samples , tissues from two mouse crc models , and a panel of crc cell lines with different metastatic potentials .
we demonstrate that mir - 543 inhibits the growth and metastasis of crc cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting kras , mta1 and hmga2 .
our study suggests that mir - 543 may be a critical determinant of crc progression .
results mir - 543 expression is downregulated in crc tissues and inversely correlated with crc metastasis mir - 543 has been described as a tumor suppressor gene for breast cancer and endometrial cancer [ 14 , 15 ] but as an oncogene for hepatocellular carcinoma [ 16 ] .
to investigate the clinicopathological significance of mir - 543 in crc , we first detected the expression of mir - 543 in 45 paired human crc tissues and matched normal colorectal tissues .
as shown in figure 1a , the level of mir - 543 was decreased in 34 of the 45 ( 75.6 %) crc tissues compared with the normal counterparts .
we found that mir - 543 expression was reduced by nearly 3 - fold in the crc tissues compared with their corresponding nontumorous colorectal tissues ( median 5.8 and 15.7 , respectively ; p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1b ) .
clinicopathologic analysis revealed that the expression of mir - 543 was also negatively correlated with distant metastasis status ( figure 1c ) and n classification ( table 1 ) ; however , no significant difference was observed between the level of mir - 543 and sex , age or t classification of patients with crc ( table 1 ) .
we further determined the level of mir - 543 in highly metastatic human crc cell lines ( sw620 and lovo ) and crc cell lines with low metastatic potential ( hct116 , ls174t , ht29 and caco - 2 ) .
the level of mir - 543 was relatively lower in highly metastatic crc cell lines than those in the four tumorigenic but low - metastatic cell lines ( figure 1d ) , indicating that mir - 543 level is inversely correlated with the metastatic potential of crc cell lines .

data were expressed as log2 fold change ( relative mir - 543 expression in tumor sample / relative mir - 543 expression in matched normal colon tissue ) to show the relative expression in every paired samples ( a ) and the relative expression difference between all normal colon samples and tumor samples ( b ) .

to further evaluate the role of mir - 543 in crc progression , we used two mouse crc models , apcmin mice and azoxymethane / dextran sodium sulfate ( aom / dss ) mice .
the apcmin mouse model is a spontaneous crc model whereas aom / dss model is a colitis - associated crc model [ 17 - 19 ] .
mice in both models formed numerous visible tumors in colorectal epithelium .
using qrt - pcr analysis , we found that the level of mir - 543 in crc tumors isolated from apcmin mice was significantly lower than that in colorectal epithelium tissues from wild - type mice ( figure 1e ) .
similarly , mice treated with aom / dss showed a significantly decreased level of mir - 543 in crc tissues compared with that in colorectal epithelium tissues in the control group ( figure 1f ) .
taken together , these data demonstrate that mir - 543 expression is reduced in clinical crc specimens and mouse crc tissues , and its level is inversely correlated with the metastatic potential of crc cell lines and the metastatic status of patients with crc .
kras , mta1 and hmga2 are direct targets of mir - 543 to explore the tumor - suppressive roles of mir - 543 in crc , we further examined the putative downstream targets of mir - 543 by three in silico prediction algorithms ( miranda , targetscan and mirwalk ) .
several in silico prediction algorithm - identified oncogenes including kras , mta1 , hmga2 , adam9 , fmnl2 and sirt1 , which contain putative binding sites for mir - 543 in their 3'utrs , were chosen for further investigation .
first , we cloned 3'utrs that contain putative mir - 543 binding sites into the pmir report luciferase construct , and each was co - transfected with a mir - 543 expression plasmid into hek293t and sw620 cells .
dual - luciferase reporter assays revealed that the luciferase activities of kras , mta1 and hmga2 but not fmnl2 , sirt1 or adam9 significantly decreased in both hek293t ( figure 2a ) and sw620 cells ( figure 2b ) upon mir - 543 overexpression .
however , the inhibitory effects were abolished when the putative mir - 543 seed - binding regions in the 3'utrs of kras , mta1 and hmga2 were mutated ( figure 2c and 2d ) .
these data demonstrate that kras , mta1 and hmga2 are direct targets of mir - 543 .

mir - 543 inhibits crc cell proliferation in vitro to evaluate the role of mir - 543 in crc progression , we first determined the effects of mir - 543 overexpression on the biological functions of human crc cell lines .
two highly metastatic crc cell lines , sw620 and lovo , which have very low endogenous mir - 543 expression , were stably infected with a lentivirus expressing mir - 543 ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
mtt assays revealed that ectopic overexpression of mir - 543 in sw620 and lovo cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation compared with control cells ( figure 3a and 3b ) .
moreover , the overexpression of mir - 543 significantly decreased the colony numbers of sw620 and lovo cells ( figure 3c and 3d ) .
the kras - raf - mek - erk - cyclin d1 signaling pathway is a key promoter of the crc malignant process through its effects on cell proliferation [ 20 , 21 ] ; thus , we next determined whether mir - 543 inhibits crc cell proliferation by targeting kras .
as shown in figure 3e , overexpression of mir - 543 in sw620 and lovo cells decreased the expression of kras and cyclin d1 at the mrna level .
western blot analysis further revealed that mir - 543 overexpression decreased the expression of kras and cyclin d1 and the phosphorylation level of mek ( p - mek ) and erk ( p - erk ) compared with controls ( figure 3f ) .
together , these results indicate that mir - 543 may inhibit the proliferation of crc cells by downregulating the kras - related oncogenic pathway .

these results are representative of at least three independent experiments .

mir - 543 suppresses crc cell migration and invasion in vitro we next examined whether mir - 543 could suppress the motility and invasiveness of crc cells by targeting mta1 and hmga2 .
transwell assays showed that overexpressing of mir - 543 in sw620 and lovo cells significantly inhibited cell migration ( figure 4a ) and invasion ( figure 4b ) in vitro .
mta1 and hmga2 have been reported to promote emt and the acquisition of metastatic potential for crc epithelial cells [ 22 , 23 ] ; thus , we next determined whether the suppression of the migration and invasion of crc cells by mir - 543 was an emt - related behavior .
upon ectopic overexpression of mir - 543 , we did not observe significant alterations of the epithelial cell markers e - cadherin and beta - catenin or the mesenchymal cell markers n - cadherin and vimentin in sw620 and lovo cells ( supplementary figure s2 ) , indicating that the mir - 543 - related inhibition of cell migration and invasion is dependent on mechanisms other than emt .
mta1 has been reported to promote lung metastasis of breast cancer by stimulating stat3 transcription and the expression of stat3 target genes [ 24 ] .
the secretion of mmps contributes to the abnormalities of the tumor microenvironment during tumor metastasis [ 25 ] .
we found that mir - 543 overexpression in crc cells decreased the mrna and protein levels of mta1 and stat3 and the mrna level of their downstream genes mmp2 and mmp9 ( figure 4c and 4d ) .
in addition , we also observed that ectopic expression of mir - 543 reduced the levels of pro - and cleaved - mmp2 and mmp9 in sw620 and lovo cells by using gelatin zymography assay ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
hmga2 can promote breast cancer cell invasion by remodeling the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) [ 26 ] .
here , we found that mir - 543 overexpression in sw620 and lovo cells increased the level of mir - 200b but decreased the expression of hmga2 and lox at the mrna ( figure 4c ) and protein levels ( figure 4d ) .
moreover , the phosphorylation level of p - fak , a downstream effector of lox [ 27 ] , was also decreased upon mir - 543 overexpression ( figure 4d ) .
these data indicate that mir - 543 suppresses crc invasion in vitro by targeting mta1 and hmga2 .
figure 4 mir - 543 overexpression suppresses the migration and invasion of crc cells in vitro and re - expression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 reverses the mir - 543 - induced effects on crc cells ( a ) transwell migration assays revealed that ectopic overexpression of mir - 543 inhibits the migration ability of sw620 and lovo cells .
( b ) transwell invasion assay with matrigel - coated membranes revealed that mir - 543 overexpression inhibits the invasion ability of sw620 and lovo cells .
( c ) qrt - pcr analysis revealed that mir - 543 downregulates the mrna expression of mta1 and hmga2 and their downstream genes stat3 , mmp2 , mmp9 and lox but upregulates mir - 200b in sw620 ( top ) and lovo ( bottom ) cells .

next , we performed rescue experiments to further confirm that mir - 543 inhibits the malignant phenotypic alterations of crc cells by directly repressing the three target genes .
to abrogate the suppression of mir - 543 on kras , mta1 and hmga2 , plasmids expressing each target gene lacking a 3'utr were constructed and transduced into lovo - mir - 543 cells ( figure 4e ) .
strikingly , exogenous expression of these three target genes almost completely rescued the mir - 543 - induced inhibitory effects on cell proliferation ( figure 4f ) and colony formation ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
moreover , restoration of kras , mta1 or hmga2 in crc cells at least partially reversed the inhibitory effects on cell migration imposed by mir - 543 expression ( figure 4g ; supplementary figure s5 ) .
therefore , re - expression of kras , mta1 or hmga2 reverses the mir - 543 - induced inhibition of the proliferation , migration and invasion of crc cells in vitro , indicating that kras , mta1 and hmga2 are functional targets of mir - 543 in crc cells .
mir - 543 overexpression inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of crc cells in vivo after determining that mir - 543 overexpression significantly suppresses the proliferation , migration and invasion of crc cells in vitro , we further investigated whether mir - 543 could inhibit the growth and metastasis of crc cells in vivo .
sw620 and lovo cells that stably overexpress mir - 543 or their control cells were infected with a virus encoding the luciferase gene and then subcutaneously injected into nude mice and analyzed after 4 weeks .
bioluminescence imaging results showed that mice injected with sw620 - ctrl cells formed larger tumors than those bearing mir - 543 - overexpressing crc cells ( figure 5a ) .
we next isolated xenograft tumors and confirmed that the overexpression of mir - 543 in sw620 cells significantly decreased subcutaneous tumor growth compared with the control groups , and the volumes and weights of the tumors of the nude mice injected with mir - 543 - overexpressing cells decreased compared with those of the control group ( figure 5a ) .
similarly , stable expression of mir - 543 inhibited the tumor growth of lovo cells in vivo ( figure 5b ) .
moreover , tumors from mir - 543 - overexpressing cells had lower ki67 expression compared with tumors from controls ( figure 5c ) .
these data indicate that mir - 543 inhibits the tumor growth of crc cells in vivo .

distant spread of crc cells to the intestines and liver and the formation of macroscopic metastases are the major cause of crc mortality [ 28 , 29 ] .
we next evaluated whether mir - 543 could inhibit the ability of crc cells to metastasize to the intestines and liver .
sw620 , lovo and their mir - 543 - overexpressing cells , which also expressed the luciferase gene , were intrasplenically injected into nude mice to develop experimental intestinal and hepatic metastasis .
as shown in figure 5d , bioluminescence imaging revealed that mir - 543 overexpression significantly reduced the metastasis of sw620 cells in nude mice .
we isolated several organs that were reported to have higher crc metastatic tropism [ 30 ] and found that mice bearing mir - 543 - overexpressing sw620 cells had less intestinal and liver metastases than control mice ( figure 5d ; supplementary figure s6a ) .
similar inhibitory effects of mir - 543 on tumor metastasis were observed in the mice bearing lovo - ctrl or lovo - mir - 543 cells ( figure 5e ; supplementary figure s6b ) .
collectively , these observations demonstrate that mir - 543 inhibits the tumor growth and metastasis of crc cells in vivo .
knockdown of mir - 543 promotes the proliferation , invasion and metastasis of crc cells in vitro and in vivo we further performed loss - of - function experiments to verify the function of mir - 543 in crc cells .
to this end , we stably knocked down the expression of mir - 543 in hct116 cells , which has relatively high endogenous mir - 543 expression , using a lentivirus - based antagomir expression system ( supplementary figure s7 ) [ 31 ] .
as shown in figure 6a and 6b , mir - 543 knockdown led to a significant increase in cell proliferation and colony number .
consistent with these phenotypes , the mrna levels of kras and cyclin d1 and the protein levels of kras , p - mek , p - erk and cyclin d1 upregulated when endogenous mir - 543 was suppressed ( figure 6c and 6d ) .
moreover , in agreement with this result , knockdown of endogenous mir - 543 increased the mrna expression of mta1 , hmga2 , stat3 , mmp2 , mmp9 and lox but decreased the level of mir - 200b .
the protein levels of mta1 and hmga2 and their downstream effectors stat3 , lox and p - fak were dramatically upregulated ( figure 6c and 6d ) .
furthermore , the suppression of endogenous mir - 543 dramatically promoted the migration ( figure 6e ) and invasion ( figure 6f ) of hct116 cells .
however , this pro - invasive phenotype was irrelevant to the emt program ( supplementary figure s8 ) .
thus , the loss - of - function data demonstrate that mir - 543 knockdown promotes the proliferation , migration and invasion of crc cells in vitro .

we further investigated whether mir - 543 knockdown could promote the growth and metastasis of crc cells in vivo .
hct116 cells that stably knockdown mir - 543 or their control cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice for 4 weeks and analyzed by bioluminescence imaging .
as shown in figure 6g , mice injected with hct116 - ctrl cells formed smaller tumors than those mice bearing mir - 543 - knockdown crc cells .
moreover , the metastatic ability of hct116 cells significantly increased when endogenous mir - 543 was knocked down ( figure 6h ) .
these in vivo data indicate that knockdown of mir - 543 markedly promoted the tumor growth and metastasis of crc cells .
inverse correlation between mir - 543 and its targets in clinical crc samples to extend our findings to human crc , we examined whether the mir - 543 - related suppression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 in crc cells is clinically relevant .
we used two paired crc samples and their matched nontumorous tissues to detect the protein expression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 by immunohistochemical staining .
relative mir - 543 expression ( t / n ) was 0.86 in one paired samples and this paired samples was considered to be a case with high mir - 543 expression , whereas another paired samples whose relative mir - 543 expression was 0.30 was regarded as a case with low mir - 543 expression .
quantitative immunohistochemical staining results revealed that crc tissues with a high level of mir - 543 had low expression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 , whereas crc tissues with a low level of mir - 543 exhibited high expression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 , indicating that mir - 543 expression is inversely correlated with the levels of kras , mta1 and hmga2 in clinical crc tissues ( figure 7 ) .

discussion it has been reported that mir - 543 is downregulated in breast cancer [ 14 ] and endometrial cancer [ 15 ] but functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 16 ] .
in this study , we report that the expression of mir - 543 is significantly downregulated in human and mouse crc tissues and is inversely correlated with the n classification and metastatic status of patients with crc .
both our in vitro and in vivo results support that mir - 543 significantly inhibits the growth and metastasis of crc .
these findings demonstrate that mir - 543 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in a context - dependent manner ; therefore , the discrepancy that mir - 543 exhibits opposing effects in different tumors deserves further investigation .
using in silico analysis and dual - luciferase reporter assays , we identified kras , mta1 and hmga2 as three new direct mir - 543 downstream targets .
kras is an oncogene that was found to be mutationally activated in approximately half of early - stage crcs [ 32 ] .
mta1 is a critical regulator of the metastatic process in various types of cancers including crc [ 22 , 33 ] .
mta1 enhances lung metastasis of breast cancer by upregulating stat3 transcription [ 24 ] , which promotes cell survival , angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis [ 34 , 35 ] .
hmga2 dysregulation is correlated with poor survival for patients with crc [ 36 ] and promotes breast cancer metastasis by increasing lox expression [ 26 ] .
here , our data reveal that there is an inverse correlation between the mir - 543 level and the expression of its targets , kras , mta1 and hmga2 , in clinical crc samples .
moreover , mir - 543 overexpression inhibits the growth and metastasis of crc cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting kras , mta1 and hmga2 .
conversely , knockdown of mir - 543 promotes the proliferation , invasion and metastasis of crc cells in vitro and in vivo .
therefore , these results support the notion that the downregulation of mir - 543 in crc cells " contributes to the activation of multiple oncogenic signaling " pathways by upregulating the expression of kras , mta1 and hmga2 , and ultimately results in crc progression and metastasis .
amplifications , deletions or mutations of mirna loci , epigenetic silencing and transcriptional dysregulation are common mechanisms that lead to the aberrant expression of specific mirnas [ 37 ] .
we demonstrated that mir - 543 is downregulated in human crc samples , mouse crc tissues and crc cell lines with highly metastatic potential .
however , the underlying mechanisms that regulate mir - 543 expression remain elusive .
in ductal carcinoma samples , cpg islands on the upstream of primary - mir - 543 have been shown to be hypermethylated , which directly results in the down - regulation of mature mir - 543 [ 14 ] .
thus , further investigations are needed to determine whether this epigenetic mechanism or other events are causal factors for the downregulation of mir - 543 in crc progression .
in conclusion , our study highlights a pivotal role for mir - 543 as a tumor suppressor in the regulation of crc cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting kras , mta1 and hmga2 and suggests that mir - 543 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for crc metastasis .

for mrna reverse transcription , cdna was synthesized using revertra aceh qpcr rt kit ( toyobo ) with 1 mg total rna .
real - time pcrs were performed using sybrh select master mix for cfx ( invitrogen ) .
relative quantification was achieved by normalization to the amount of gapdh ( for mrnas ) or snrna u6 ( for mirnas ) .
the 2 - deltadeltact ( deltact = ctmir - 543 - ctu6 ) method for quantitation of gene expression was used to determine mir - 543 relative expression levels .
the deltadeltact was calculated by subtracting the deltact of the reference sample ( a normal clinical or mouse tissue sample was chosen for the normalization of clinical samples or samples in two mouse models , lovo cell was chosen for the normalization of five crc cell lines ) from the deltact of each sample .
the mean relative mir - 543 expression ( 5.8 ) of all clinical tumor samples was chosen as the cut - off to classify a tumor sample was high or low according to their mir - 543 expression level .

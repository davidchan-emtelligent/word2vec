background many studies have been published outlining the global effects of 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) on gene expression in human epithelial breast cancer derived mcf - 7 cells .
these studies show large variation in results , reporting between ~ 100 and ~ 1500 genes regulated by e2 , with poor overlap .
results we performed a meta - analysis of these expression studies , using the rank product method to obtain a more accurate and stable list of the differentially expressed genes , and of pathways regulated by e2 .
we analyzed 9 time - series data sets , concentrating on response at 3 - 4 hrs ( early ) and at 24 hrs ( late ) .
we found > 1000 statistically significant probe sets after correction for multiple testing at 3 - 4 hrs , and > 2000 significant probe sets at 24 hrs .
differentially expressed genes were examined by pathway analysis .
this revealed 15 early response pathways , mostly related to cell signaling and proliferation , and 20 late response pathways , mostly related to breast cancer , cell division , dna repair and recombination .
conclusions our results confirm that meta - analysis identified more differentially expressed genes than the individual studies , and that these genes act together in networks .
these results provide new insight into e2 regulated mechanisms , especially in the context of breast cancer .
microarray meta - analysis estrogen breast cancer pathways background estrogens are fundamental to the function of the female reproductive system , and have also been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes in the central nervous system , the cardiovascular system , and bone metabolism [ 1 ] .
estrogens play a key role in proliferation and differentiation of healthy breast epithelium , but also contribute to the progression of breast cancer by promoting the growth of transformed cells [ 2 ] .
the predominant effect of estrogen is mediated through its interaction with two intracellular estrogen receptors , eralpha and erbeta .
eralpha notably is strongly expressed in 80 % of breast cancers [ 3 ] .
once estrogen is bound to eralpha , the receptor dimerizes and associates with chromatin .
eralpha homodimers bind either directly to a dna sequence motif , the estrogen response element [ 4 - 6 ] , or indirectly via tethering to other transcription factors such as specificity protein 1 ( sp1 ) [ 7,8 ] , activating protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) [ 9,10 ] , or nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) [ 11 ] .
17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) is the most prevalent intracellular estrogen .
tiled or cdna microarrays have been abundantly used for the global analysis of 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) responsive genes .
several studies have profiled the transcriptional response to e2 in cultured cells , particularly mcf - 7 cells , and have uncovered comprehensive features of e2 regulated gene expression .
at early time points following e2 induction a greater proportion of genes are up regulated , while at later time points more genes are down regulated [ 12 ] .
it has been hypothesized that early eralpha - mediated down regulation might be due to squelching , while the increase in the number of down regulated genes at later time points might depend on the up regulation of the corepressor nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 ( nrip1 ) , which mediates the repression of eralpha target genes [ 5 ] .
interestingly , only about 20 % to 30 % of the e2 - regulated genes represent direct targets [ 13 ] , as defined by treatment with the protein translation inhibitor cyclohexamide .
there is considerable variation in the results generated by different laboratories , even for the same cell type and hormone treatment [ 14 ] .
estimations of the number of e2 - regulated genes range from =~ 100 to =~ 1500 [ 14 ] .
as noted by cheung et al. , [ 15 ] the differences between studies can be due to the origin and growth conditions of the cell lines , the length of hormone treatment , the array platforms used , or the bioinformatics methods used for data analysis .
meta - analysis allows combining the results of several studies , to provide a global picture , with statistical support , and hopefully better power and specificity than each of the original studies .
several meta - analysis applications for microarrays have been proposed [ 16 - 18 ] .
two methods have been most frequently applied : one is to combine p - values , and the other is to combine effect sizes .
combining p - values has been very useful in obtaining more accurate estimates of significance .
choi et al [ 16 ] have shown that combining effect sizes can take into account inter - study variation .
here we have used the rank product [ 19 ] method to detect differentially expressed genes in response to e2 treatment in mcf - 7 cell lines , by integrating multiple array datasets from two different platforms across laboratories .
this method detects genes that are consistently highly ranked in several replicated experiments , independently of their numerical intensities .
it generates a single significance measurement for each gene in the combined study .
results data set selection and processing microarray data was downloaded from geo ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo /) [ 20 ] .
nine time course studies were used for the meta - analysis .
two common time points among the different datasets were selected for further analysis : 3 to 4 hours of treatment ( early ) and 24 hours of treatment ( late ) .
in total we had 4 datasets that were used for the early time point , and 7 datasets that were used for the late time point ( tables 1 and 2 ) .

for one study raw scaled signal count values were provided .
rank product method does not require the recalculation of the normalized expression values .
thus we use the data processed according to what was considered best practice in each lab .
for the meta - analysis , the probesets found in common across the affymetrix u133 genechip family was used .
there are 22,277 common probesets between the two u133a and u133 plus 2.0 , which map to 13,186 genes .
meta - analysis of gene expression data the rank product method was chosen , as non - parametric analyses are more robust in general , which is an important concern in comparing experiments done in different laboratories .
the rank product method has been shown to give good results on microarray data [ 18 ] .
out of 22,277 probe sets , we identified 1206 at the early time point and 4193 at the late time point , with a false discovery rate ( called percentage of false positive predictions or pfp , see methods ) <= 0.05 .
the high proportion of genes with low p - values indicates that many more genes are found to be differentially expressed than expected by chance. by mapping the probe sets to genes , we have identified 991 unique genes differentially expressed at the early time point and 3234 unique genes that are differentially expressed at the late time point .
all results are available in additional file 1 .
we compared the proportion of top genes identified in individual datasets with the top genes from the meta - analysis , using correspondence at the top ( cat ) plots [ 17 ] .
cat plots quantify the consensus of two lists , based on ranks .
for example if two lists have 40 genes out of the first 100 in common , the their consensus at rank 100 will be 40 % .
in figure 1 the cat plots are shown for the top 800 probes ( 400 up - regulated and 400 - down regulated ) at each time point .
these plots show that no single study determines or influences the final meta - analysis gene list .
table 3 also shows that the meta - analysis is able to identify more genes at the same pfp level , demonstrating an increased statistical power .

the ranks of these genes are indicated in the individual study and in the meta analysis studies .
the asterisk * indicates that the gene was not included in the significant list ( pfp <= 0.05 ) .
the top early genes from the meta - analysis include many well known direct targets of eralpha and erbeta [ 3 ] .
the most significant ones include tff1 , ccnd1 , igfbp4 , c3 , adora1 , greb1 , and myc , which have been shown by candidate gene analysis to be estrogen regulated genes in breast cancer cell lines .
moreover , the top genes from both the early and late time points form highly connected networks ( figure 2 ) .
these interactions show the functional relevance of our results , and point to the importance of networks in interpreting e2 signaling in mcf - 7 .
we can already see in these data important differences between the early and late regulated genes , with the top early genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation .
the early network notably shows up - regulation of the nuclear repressor protein nrip1 / rip140 [ 5 ] , which is then involved in the down - regulation of cyclin g2 ( ccng2 ) and of monocyte - to - macrophage differentiation - associated protein ( mmd ) ( figure 2a ) .
the late gene network is centered on erbb2 , a member of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases , and one of the major molecular prognostic and predictive markers in breast cancer ( figure 2b ) .
erbb2 is known for its role in cell proliferation , growth , and apoptosis .
this network also includes nf - kappab , which plays a key role in the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells [ 23,24 ] .

pathway analysis : early time point we have found 20 biological networks with a significant involvement of the genes differentially expressed at the early time point .
figure 3 shows the top network , which is consistent with the network found using the top 30 genes only : again , errb2 plays a central role .
this network is annotated " infection mechanism , cellular growth and proliferation , genetic disorder " .
the interferon signaling pathway , which is involved in negative regulation of cellular proliferation and induction of cellular apoptosis , is down regulated. of note , irf6 is suggested to regulate epithelial cell differentiation , and several irf family members are known to harbor tumor suppressive functions .
we find irf members ir6 and irf9 to be down regulated in mcf - 7 , which adds more evidence to the hypothesis that down - regulation of the interferon signaling pathway might be important for uncontrolled cellular proliferation [ 25 ] .

the other top scoring networks at the early time point contain genes involved in cell growth , proliferation , dna replication , protein amino acid metabolism , rna and protein trafficking , cellular movement , and lipid metabolism .
the merged image of the top three networks indicates three nodes centered on erbb , cmyc and fos , all key regulators of proliferative responses ( see additional file 2 ) .
in addition , several proteins involved in protein translation and metabolism are up regulated , including seven mitochondrial ribosomal proteins .
in addition to searching for relations amongst the differentially regulated genes , we can map them to very well established (" canonical ") pathways .
in this view , the early genes appear involved in signaling pathways such as wnt / b - catenin signaling , rar activation and vdr activation ( figure 4a ) .

green color denotes the percentage of genes in the pathway that are down regulated and red color denotes the percentage of genes that are up regulated .
pathway analysis : late time point at the late time point the top network is annotated " cellular assembly and organization , cell cycle , dna replication , recombination and repair " .
figure 4 shows that the erbb2 network is now involved in interaction with genes involved in cell division and cell cycle .
the 5 top scoring gene networks share several common genes regulated at both time points , although they sometimes change in opposite directions .
this similarity between time points indicates that most of the major gene expression changes start to take place as early as 3 hrs .
this is clear comparing the early and late response of the genes that are involved in molecular mechanisms of cancer ( figure 5 ) .

horizontal oval = transcription regulator , vertical diamond = enzyme and circle = other .
genes that are down regulated at the late time point also include a large proportion of structural and cell adhesion genes , such as collagens , keratins , and other intermediate filament proteins .
other down regulated genes that are potentially involved in the development of cancer include superoxide dismutase 3 ( sod3 ) , cyclin d2 ( ccnd2 ) , transthyretin ( ttr ) , bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( bmp2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( mmp2 ) .
finally , the late genes can be mapped to canonical pathways involved in breast cancer , and cell cycle and division ( figure 4b ) .
comparison with the gems dataset a previous meta - analysis of e2 treated mcf cell lines was done by ochsner et al .
[ 26 ] .
they used a parametric ( weighted t - stats ) method to obtain a gene expression meta - signature ( gems ) for e2 - regulated gene expression in mcf - 7 cells .
we compared the pathway analysis for the top 50 down regulated and top 50 up regulated genes of the early time point of each study ( figure 6 ) .
table 6 shows the list of central genes in each resulting network .
curiously , the gems derived network for early genes resembles more the networks derived from late genes by the rank product method .
notably , it is centered on erbb2 and erk .
another difference is that the rank product produces more highly connected genes which have been shown in the literature to be regulated by eralpha , than gems .
this includes eralpha itself , which is not a top gene in the gems analysis .
also notable is the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , which is central in the network derived from rank product , but is not detected significantly in any individual study , nor by the gems analysis .
vegf expression is strongly induced as an immediate early response to e2 induction in vivo ( uterine epithelial cells ) , mediated by eralpha and hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif1alpha ) [ 27 ] .
figure 6 merged network created from the top 100 ( 50 down regulated and 50 upregulated ) differentially expressed genes using ( a ) rank product algorithm , ( b ) the gems list .

discussion we have identified 1206 probe sets and more than 10 pathways whose expression is significantly different between control and e2 treated mcf - 7 cells 3 - 4 hrs after treatment , and 4193 probe sets and more than 20 pathways 24 hrs after treatment .
although very little overlap exists on the gene level between the nine expression profiling studies , the meta analysis finds common functional processes and pathways .
table 3 shows that most of the genes identified in individual studies were also identified in the meta - analysis .
the rank product algorithm returns a robust ranking for all the top genes , leading to higher reproducibility and increased specificity .
it should be noted that all the datasets we used were based on the affymetrix platform .
a recently available dataset [ 28 ] , using illumina beadchip , provides very similar results to our analysis .
another very recent dataset [ 29 ] , using gro - seq , although produced with a different focus on transient early response to e2 , also provides consistent results .
thus it does not seem that our results are platform - dependent .
we have used pathway analysis tools to understand the relationship between the regulated genes .
known targets of eralpha , such as myc , erbb2 , and esralpha , are central genes at early and late time points .
this shows that the statistically significant genes are biologically relevant , and that our analysis captures key aspects of the underlying physiology .
aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) is a ligand activated transcription factor involved in xenobiotic metabolism and in mediating the toxic effects of dioxin - like compounds .
crosstalk has been observed between ahr and er , specifically with respect to er signaling [ 30 ] .
eralpha has been reported to have a positive role in ahr signaling .
we find this pathway highly regulated at both time points .
the top canonical pathways regulated early are involved in cellular growth , development and proliferation , whereas those regulated late are involved in dna replication , recombination and repair , cell cycle and cell death .
these canonical pathways were not evident from any of the individual studies .
another difference between early and late response to e2 is early regulation of transcription regulators , vs. late regulation of kinases and transporters .
at the late time point we also see several genes common with the sv40t / t - antigen cancer signature identified by deeb et al. [ 31 ] for human breast , prostate and lung carcinomas .
these include genes encoding 10 centromere proteins , 8 cyclins , 15 cell division cyle proteins , 7 kinesin - like family proteins , 7 multiple minichromosome maintenance - deficient proteins , and other proliferation - related proteins and signal transduction proteins .
conclusions it is important to aggregate as much high - quality data as possible to minimize sources of bias influencing gene expression studies .
the rank product methodology favors genes that are consistently top ranked among replicates .
therefore in the future other high quality datasets can be integrated into this work , with minimum effort .
an interesting perspective will be to explore the predictive power for clinical outcome [ 32 ] of breast cancer , of the gene set from meta - analysis , to the gene sets from individual studies .
methods meta - analysis the human genome u133a platform contain > 22,000 probe sets and the human genome platform u133 plus 2.0 array contains an additional > 31,000 new probe sets , giving a total of > 54,000 probe sets .
for the meta - analysis , the probesets found in common across the affymetrix u133 genechip family was used .
there are 22,277 common probesets between the two u133a and u133 plus 2.0 , that map to 13,186 genes .
the statistical significance of the results was evaluated by the non - parametric algorithm ' rank products' [ 33 ] , available as the ' rankprod ' package at bioconductor ( http :// www.bioconductor.org ) [ 19 ] .
this method detects genes that are consistently highly ranked in several replicated experiments , independently of their numerical intensities .
this method ranks each feature within an experiment based on that features' score ( e.g. , log expression values ) , and then combines these ranks , instead of combining the data or p - values .
the results are provided in the form of p values defined as the probability that a given gene is ranked in the observed position by chance .
a list of differentially regulated probe sets were selected based on the estimated percentage of false positive predictions ( pfp )[ 33 ] , which is equivalent to a false discovery rate .
the pfp is calculated using a permutation based procedure ( 100,000 permutations were conducted ) .
genes with a pfp of less than 0.05 were selected for further investigation .
as the rank - based procedure is non - parametric , it does not make assumptions about the model and the parameters from which the data came .
evaluation of meta - analysis we evaluated the performance of the rank product algorithm using correspondence at the top ( cat ) plots [ 17 ] , which determine the proportion of genes in common between experiments as a function of list size .
to generate cat plots we use the lists of top genes for each of the study including the meta studies and plot proportion in common against the list size .
we also used integration - drive discovery ( idd ) to measure the number of extra genes identified by meta - analysis , compared with the union set of all individual studies at the same pfp threshold value .
functional analysis functional classification analysis was done using the ingenuity pathway analysis software ( version 8.5 ) .
the " core analysis " was used , with a focus on canonical signaling pathways .
core analysis allows for a rapid assessment and interpretation of large and small datasets in the context of biological processes , pathways , and molecular networks .
in short , for a given function or pathway , the statistical significance of pathway enrichment is calculated using a right tailed fisher 's exact test based on the number of genes annotated , the number of genes represented in the input dataset , and the total number of genes being assessed in the experiment .
a pathway was deemed significant if the p - value of enrichment was <= 0.01 .
the p - value is adjusted for multiple comparisons using fdr correction .

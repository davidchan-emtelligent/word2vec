background anti - viral prophylaxis is used to prevent the transmission of influenza .
we studied serological confirmation of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) infections during oseltamivir prophylaxis and after cessation of prophylaxis .
methods between 22 jun and 16 jul 09 , we performed a cohort study in 3 outbreaks in the singapore military where post - exposure oseltamivir ring chemoprophylaxis ( 75 mg daily for 10 days ) was administered .
the entire cohort was screened by rt - pcr ( with ha gene primers ) using nasopharyngeal swabs three times a week .
three blood samples were taken for haemagglutination inhibition testing - at the start of outbreak , 2 weeks after completion of 10 day oseltamivir prophylaxis , and 3 weeks after the pandemic 's peak in singapore .
questionnaires were also administered to collect clinical symptoms .
results 237 personnel were included for analysis .
the overall infection rate of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) during the three outbreaks was 11.4 % ( 27 / 237 ) .
this included 11 index cases and 16 personnel ( 7.1 %) who developed four - fold or higher rise in antibody titres during oseltamivir prophylaxis. of these 16 personnel , 8 ( 3.5 %) were symptomatic while the remaining 8 personnel ( 3.5 %) were asymptomatic and tested negative on pcr .
post - cessation of prophylaxis , an additional 23 ( 12.1 %) seroconverted .
there was no significant difference in mean fold - rise in gmt between those who seroconverted during and post - prophylaxis ( 11.3 vs 11.7 , p = 0.888 ) .
no allergic , neuropsychiatric or other severe side - effects were noted .
conclusions post - exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis reduced the rate of infection during outbreaks , and did not substantially increase subsequent infection rates upon cessation .
asymptomatic infections occur during prophylaxis , which may confer protection against future infection .
post - exposure prophylaxis is effective as a measure in mitigating pandemic influenza outbreaks .
background anti - viral prophylaxis has been used as a strategy to prevent the transmission and spread of influenza .
post - exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir , a commonly used neuraminidase - inhibitor , has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of clinical disease against seasonal influenza when used against household contacts [ 1,2 ] .
pre - exposure prophylaxis has also been successfully used in the community [ 3 ] , and in households [ 4 ] to prevent transmission of influenza .
for the 2009 pandemic , post - exposure prophylaxis has been used in household and community contacts of pandemic influenza cases [ 5 ] , as well as in pandemic influenza outbreaks in closed environments [ 6 ] .
one of the uncertainties with prophylaxis is the risk of maintaining an immunologically naive population which may increase the possibility of outbreaks after the cessation of prophylaxis .
one mathematical model showed that premature cessation of prophylaxis before the pandemic 's peak resulted in higher peak infection rates compared to no prophylaxis use [ 7 ] .
however , prophylaxis may delay the spread of the virus such that the overall infection rate in the affected group is reduced , and may spread out the burden of disease , thus reducing the strain on resources and disruption of services .
currently , there is little evidence on the actual outcome of prophylaxis in such situations .
chemoprophylaxis failures have been previously documented but mostly by the development of clinical influenza illness among individuals receiving prophylaxis [ 1,4 ] .
however , influenza may also result in asymptomatic infections [ 8 ] , and one previous study showed that asymptomatic infections while receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis do occur [ 3 ] .
asymptomatic sero - conversion may confer protection and increase the overall effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in protecting individuals and cohorts even after cessation by increasing herd immunity .
we performed a study in the tropical city - state of singapore to determine symptomatic and asymptomatic serological confirmation of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) infections during oseltamivir prophylaxis and after cessation of prophylaxis , in 3 separate outbreaks .
the findings will be important in the application of future chemoprophylaxis strategies .
methods we performed an observational cohort study in the singapore military from 22 jun 09 to 16 jul 09 .
the singapore military has a mix of regular employees and conscript personnel where all males are required to serve after high school .
these personnel live in camps during the week and return home on weekends , resulting in a semi - closed community with exposures to the national community .
the singapore military identified its first imported case of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) on 15 jun 2009 , and on 22 jun 2009 identified its first outbreak cluster with local transmission .
in line with national protocols , cases of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) were determined via laboratory confirmed infection by real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) or viral culture [ 9 ] .
in addition to the national protocol of hospital or home isolation of cases during the early containment phase of the local epidemic [ 10 ] , the singapore military used the strategy of geographical oseltamivir ring chemoprophylaxis of affected military units with 10 days of oseltamivir 75 mg once a day , and cohorting of the entire units ( as a form of social distancing ) to prevent spread .
epidemiological investigations the study was performed among 252 personnel involved in 3 separate 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) outbreaks , whereby post - exposure oseltamivir ring chemoprophylaxis was administered .
at the onset of each outbreak , a 10 day course of post - exposure oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis was given to each cohort and they continued to function in their normal capacity .
the entire cohort was screened by rt - pcr using nasopharyngeal swabs three times a week , until no further positive cases were discovered for three days .
all confirmed cases were given a minimum of 7 days home medical leave .
the rest of the cohort continued their regular schedule , including staying in camp during weekdays and returning home during weekends .
in addition , three samples of 5 to 10 ml of venous blood were taken from each participant in for serological testing .
the first baseline sample was taken at the start of outbreak .
the second sample was taken between 2 to 3 weeks after the completion of oseltamivir prophylaxis .
this timeframe allowed sufficient time for seroconversion from infections during prophylaxis , while reducing the likelihood of seroconversion from infections after prophylaxis [ 11 ] .
the third sample was taken 3 weeks after the peak of the pandemic in singapore [ 12 ] , between 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of prophylaxis , to assess for any additional seroconversion after prophyalxis .
questionnaires were administered to collect data on demographics , medical history , and clinical symptoms .
written informed consent was obtained from participants , and the study was approved by the singapore military 's joint medical committee ( research ) and the australian national university 's ethics review board .
laboratory analysis the nasopharyngeal swabs collected were resuspended in 3.0 ml of universal transport medium ( copan diagnostics inc. , usa ) and sent for laboratory testing .
total nucleic acid material was extracted using the dna minikit ( qiagen , inc , valencia , ca , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions and subjected to real - time pcr testing for the presence of h1n1 - 2009 [ 13 ] .
briefly , 5ul of nucleic extract was pcr - amplified with 0.8 um of each of the forward ( 5 ' - gac aaa ata aca aac gaa gca act gg - 3 ') and reverse primers ( 5 ' - ggg agg ctg ttt ata gca cc - 3 ') in the presence of 0.2 um probe ( 5 ' - 6 - carboxyfluorescein - gca ttc gca at ( bhq ) g gaa aga aat gct gg - 3 ') using the superscript iii rt / platinum taq mix ( invitrogen corporation , ca , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
the reverse transcription ( rt ) was carried out at 50degreesc for 30 mins , the reaction denatured at 95degreesc for 2 mins , and pcr - amplified with 50 cycles consisting of 95degreesc for 15 sec and 55degreesc for 30 sec .
the rt - pcr testing was carried out on a real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems 7500 , usa ) , a positive result is defined by a fluorescence growth curve that crosses the threshold line within 40 cycles .
sensitivity of this assay is about 100 copies of rna genome equivalents per reaction ( 95 % confidence level ) [ 14 ] .
for the blood samples , serum was extracted and tested by haemagglutination inhibition ( hi ) according to standard protocols ( who cc , 1982 ) at the who collaborating center for reference and research for influenza in melbourne , australia .
the serum was pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme ( rde ) ( deka seiken co. ltd. , tokyo , japan ) at 1:4 ( volume / volume ) , and the enzyme inactivated by addition of an equal volume of 1.6 % tri - sodium citrate ( ajax chemicals , australia ) .
egg - grown a / california / 7 / 2009 a ( h1n1 - 2009 ) virus was purified by sucrose gradient , concentrated and inactivated with beta - propiolactone , to create an influenza zonal pool preparation ( a gift from csl , australia ) .
25 mul of influenza zonal pool - a / california / 7 / 2009 virus was incubated with an equal volume of rde - treated serum , titrated in two - fold dilutions in phosphate buffer solution from 1:10 to 1:1280 , and incubated for 1 hour .
25 mul 1 % ( v / v ) turkey red blood cells was added to each well and read after 30 minutes .
controls for the hi assay were performed with positive ferret sera ( sera collected from naive ferrets infected with a / california / 7 / 2009 h1n1 pandemic virus and bled 14 days later ) , positive human sera from rt - pcr positive individuals collected in the convalescent phase , and negative human sera collected from non - infected individuals .
positive sera had high titres by both hi and mn assays against pandemic h1n1 viruses .
titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum where haemagglutination was prevented .
individual seroconversion was indicated by a four - fold or greater rise in titres between successive samples .
statistical analysis the data was analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss , version 16.0 , chicago , il ) with the level of significance set at 0.05 .
categorical variables were summarized as percentages and continuous variables as means with standard error ( se ) ; the student 's t - test was used to investigate the relationship between continuous variables .
results outbreaks a , b and c occurred in 3 separate units on 22 jun 09 , 9 jul 09 and 16 jul 09 respectively .
prior to these outbreaks , there were no increases of influenza - like illness or respiratory illness cases in these units , nor were there any confirmed cases of 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ). of the 252 personnel initially identified and sampled ; 15 personnel were subsequently excluded as they had completed their conscript service and left the military before completion of the study ( figure 1 ) .
the final study population consisted of 237 personnel of which 11 personnel were index cases of the outbreaks .
these index cases were started on treatment dose of oseltamivir ( 75 mg twice daily for 5 days ) and given medical leave at the onset of the outbreak and thus did not have any baseline serology taken .
figure 1 enrollment and follow - up of study population .
the mean age of the study population was 21.2 years old ( range 18.7 - 30.8 ) ( table 1 ) and all were male , reflecting the composition of the military .
the ethnic make - up was similar to the general singapore population .
twenty - three personnel ( 9.7 %) had a history of asthma and 1 ( 0.4 %) each had hypertension and iga nephropathy ; no other relevant medical conditions were present .

no allergic , neuropsychiatric or other severe side - effects were noted .
discussion prophylaxis with oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in reducing the immediate spread of influenza in community and household settings during the period of administration [ 3,4 ] .
however , the effectiveness of oseltamivir in reducing subsequent infection rates has not been widely studied .
our study showed that prophylaxis may be effective not only in reducing the spread of influenza during a localized outbreak , but also after cessation of prophylaxis during the overall epidemic .
in our study , the overall infection rate during the outbreak was 11.4 % .
this was lower than clinical attack rates in other seasonal influenza outbreaks documented in the military - 57.7 % among taiwanese military recruits [ 15 ] and 42 % on a navy ship [ 16 ] .
our infection rates were also lower when compared to similar 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) outbreaks in other closed communities - > 30 % attack rate in a school outbreak [ 17 ] and 13 - 17 % among household contacts ( which consisted of older age groups ) [ 18 ] .
the seroconversion rate after the cessation of prophylaxis until after the community epidemic 's peak was 12.1 % , which was similar to that of the initial outbreak ( 11.4 %) .
in addition , the overall combined infection rate throughout the entire epidemic of 21.1 % ( 50 / 237 ) was lower than that of other similar military cohorts surveyed in the singapore military during the same period with a seroconversion rate of 28 % [ 19 ] .
the latter cohorts did not receive early oseltamivir prophylaxis .
this shows that anti - viral prophylaxis did not render the population more susceptible to further outbreaks even though prophylaxis was stopped 1 - 4 weeks before the peak of the epidemic .
on the contrary , anti - viral prophylaxis allowed cases to be spread out across time , reducing peak absenteeism and disruptions to the military or business continuity .
a previous study in another closed environment , a boarding school , using amantadine post - exposure prophylaxis for seasonal influenza a / h3n2 modeled that prophylaxis reduced the number of clinical influenza - like illness cases during its use by approximately 83.7 % , and although the number of cases increased upon cessation of prophylaxis , the overall clinical attack rates were 21.7 % , which was lower than predicted using previous outbreaks for comparison [ 20 ] .
asymptomatic , rt - pcr negative seroconversion occurred in 3.5 % of the participants during oseltamivir prophylaxis .
this shows likely exposure to and infection with 2009 influenza a ( h1n1 ) , and the subsequent development of antibodies which may be protective , without increasing transmission .
furthermore , we found that the antibody titres in those who seroconverted during prophylaxis were not significantly different from those who seroconverted after cessation of prophylaxis .
as such , in addition to preventing clinical infection , prophylaxis may also result in asymptomatic infection and subsequent immunity which provides individual protection against further infection after cessation of prophylaxis , as well as increasing herd immunity .
the identical rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic seroconversions during prophylaxis show that the proportion of asymptomatic infection is substantial and must be considered during any influenza outbreak [ 21 ] .
our findings are similar to the another study by hayden and colleagues , which showed that in the general community during seasonal epidemic influenza , 2.3 % to 2.5 % of those who received oseltamivir prophylaxis had asymptomatic infection , although this was not significant compared to those on placebo [ 3 ] .
our study provides evidence on serological infections and asymptomatic seroconversion while on oseltamivir prophylaxis , incorporating serological , pcr and clinical data .
however , there are some limitations of this study .
the lack of planned control groups which makes it difficult to assess the likely exposures and infection rates within similar settings , but previous experiences have suggested that exposures and infection rates during the initial outbreak phase are high in closed environments [ 15 - 17 ] .
in addition , the age group in these outbreaks is limited to young adults .
additional studies should be performed in different populations and age groups , with comparison groups to determine the overall effectiveness of prophylaxis in reducing clinical infections and promoting immunity .
conclusion our study showed that post - exposure oseltmaivir prophylaxis reduced the rate of infection in a vulnerable population and did not adversely increase subsequent infection rates upon cessation of prophylaxis before the epidemic 's peak .
in addition , we have shown that asymptomatic seroconversions occur during prophylaxis , which may confer protection against future infection .
post - exposure prophylaxis remains a strategy to consider in preventing the spread of influenza in closed environments and essential personnel populations .

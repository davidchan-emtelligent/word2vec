background autocrine motility factor / phosphoglucose isomerase ( amf / pgi ) is the extracellular ligand for the gp78 / amfr receptor overexpressed in a variety of human cancers .
we showed previously that raft - dependent internalization of amf / pgi is elevated in metastatic mda - 435 cells , but not metastatic , caveolin - 1 - expressing mda - 231 cells , relative to non - metastatic mcf7 and dysplastic mcf10a cells suggesting that it might represent a tumor cell - specific endocytic pathway .
methodology / principal findings similarly , using flow cytometry , we demonstrate that raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi is increased in metastatic ht29 cancer cells expressing low levels of caveolin - 1 relative to metastatic , caveolin - 1 - expressing , hct116 colon cells and non - metastatic caco - 2 cells .
therefore , we exploited the raft - dependent internalization of amf / pgi as a potential tumor - cell specific targeting mechanism .
we synthesized an amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate and found it to be as efficient as free paclitaxel in inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis in tumor cells that readily internalize amf / pgi compared to tumor cells that poorly internalize amf / pgi .
murine k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 melanoma cells internalize fitc - conjugated amf / pgi and are acutely sensitive to amf / pgi - paclitaxel mediated cytotoxicity in vitro .
moreover , following in vivo intratumoral injection , fitc - conjugated amf / pgi is internalized in k1735 - m1 tumors .
intratumoral injection of amf / pgi - paclitaxel induced significantly higher tumor regression compared to free paclitaxel , even in b16 - f1 cells , known to be resistant to taxol treatment .
treatment with amf / pgi - paclitaxel significantly prolonged the median survival time of tumor bearing mice .
free amf / pgi exhibited a pro - survival role , reducing the cytotoxic effect of both amf / pgi - paclitaxel and free paclitaxel suggesting that amf / pgi - paclitaxel targets a pathway associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents .
amf / pgi - fitc uptake by normal murine spleen and thymus cells was negligible both in vitro and following intravenous injection in vivo where amf / pgi - fitc was selectively internalized by subcutaneous b16 - f1 tumor cells .
conclusions / significance the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi may therefore represent a tumor cell specific endocytic pathway of potential value for drug delivery to tumor cells .
introduction endocytosis is the general mechanism by which cells regulate entry of external substances into the cell and represents an important route for delivery of targeted therapeutics for a variety of pathologies including cancer [ 1 ] .
clathrin - mediated endocytosis represents the best characterized endocytic pathway , however a number of clathrin - independent endocytic routes , in particular raft - dependent pathways , have recently come under intense scrutiny .
various raft pathways showing differential caveolin , dynamin and small g protein dependence have been characterized and shown to be coopted by various viruses , toxins and extracellular pathogens [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
caveolae - mediated uptake is a well - characterized endocytic mechanism in endothelial cells [ 5 ] , but whether other raft - dependent pathways represent selective portals into specific cell types , such as tumor cells , remains to be demonstrated .
a novel promising target for anti - cancer agents is the receptor for autocrine motility factor / phosphoglucose isomerase ( amf / pgi ) , known as gp78 / amfr , that was recently identified as one of 189 genes mutated at significant frequency in breast and colorectal cancer [ 6 ] .
increased expression of gp78 / amfr in human cancers is significantly correlated with more advanced tumor stage and decreased patient survival [ 7 ] .
gp78 / amfr is the cell surface receptor for amf / pgi and also an e3 ubiquitin ligase localized to a distinct mitochondria - associated smooth subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum [ 8 ] - [ 11 ] .
the recent identification of the kai1 metastasis suppressor as a gp78 / amfr endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation ( erad ) substrate strongly supports a role for gp78 / amfr up - regulation in metastasis promotion [ 12 ] .
amf / pgi is a glycolytic enzyme that has been shown to exhibit extracellular cytokine function , under the aliases neuroleukin , maturation factor and amf , targeting neurons , lymphocytes and cancer cells , respectively [ 13 ] - [ 18 ] .
amf / pgi is selectively secreted by transformed cell lines and has been extensively implicated in the autocrine stimulation of tumor cell motility and proliferation through activation of pkc , rho , rho - gdi and p27kip1 inducing reorganization of focal contacts and loss of e - cadherin via upregulation of the e - cadherin transcription repressor snail [ 19 ] - [ 25 ] .
amf / pgi exhibits anti - apoptotic activity by downregulating apaf - 1 and caspase - 9 expression [ 26 ] .
amf / pgi is also an angiogenic factor , whose expression is induced under hypoxic conditions in response to expression of hif - 1 , and crosstalk between amf / pgi and vegf regulates both induction of amf / pgi and amf / pgi promotion of angiogenesis [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] .
amf / pgi overexpression induces cellular transformation and promotes tumorigenicity as well as the formation of larger tumors and metastases upon orthotopic implantation of paca - 2 pancreatic tumor cells , while partial amf / pgi knockdown induces cellular senescence [ 22 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
increased amf / pgi levels in the urine and serum of cancer patients is associated with the presence of colorectal , breast , lung , kidney and gastrointestinal carcinomas [ 32 ] - [ 37 ] .
expression of both amf / pgi and gp78 / amfr are therefore strongly associated with tumor progression and metastasis .
upon binding of amf / pgi to cell surface gp78 / amfr , it is endocytosed via a dynamin - dependent raft pathway to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum that is negatively regulated by expression of cav1 [ 38 ] , 39 .
this pathway is distinct from that followed by gm1 ganglioside bound cholera toxin b - subunit ( ct - b ) and appears to represent a unique pathway in that it targets directly the smooth endoplasmic reticulum [ 4 ] , [ 40 ] the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi is upregulated in ras - and abl - transformed nih - 3t3 cells that express reduced levels of the raft - associated protein caveolin - 1 ( cav1 ) [ 39 ] .
metastatic breast tumor cell lines show increased cell surface gp78 / amfr expression , however amf / pgi uptake was increased only in metastatic mda - 435 cells that express gp78 / amfr and reduced cav1 levels and not in mda - 231 cells expressing both gp78 / amfr and high levels of cav1 [ 41 ] .
the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum may therefore represent a specific endocytic pathway for the selective targeting of gp78 / amfr - positive , cav1 - deficient tumors .
in this study , we show that raft - dependent uptake of amf / pgi is specific for gp78 / amfr - positive / cav1 - negative metastatic colon cancer cells , does not target normal immune cells and occurs in vivo in subcutaneous k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 melanoma tumor models .
in addition , we have synthesized and characterized a novel amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate that shows increased tumor selectivity and cytotoxicity compared to free paclitaxel and targets and kills amf / pgi - internalizing cells , both in vitro and in vivo .
intratumoral injection of amf / pgi - paclitaxel induced tumor regression and increased survival of tumor bearing mice , identifying amf / pgi - paclitaxel as a potential targeted therapeutic agent for gp78 / amfr - positive cancers .
results gp78 / amfr expression and amf / pgi internalization in human colon carcinoma cell lines we previously showed that gp78 / amfr expression was elevated in metastatic mda - 435 and mda - 231 cells relative to non - metastatic mcf - 7 and dysplastic mcf10a mammary tumor cells and that amf / pgi - fitc uptake was selectively increased in mda - 435 cells that express reduced levels of cav1 [ 41 ] .
we have now expanded these studies to three human epithelial colon cancer cell lines , non - metastatic caco - 2 and metastatic hct116 and ht29 cells. by western blot , significant gp78 / amfr protein expression was detected in invasive hct116 and ht29 colon cancer cell lines and was very low in caco - 2 cells .
expression of caveolin ( cav1 / 2 ) was elevated in hct116 cells and was minimal in ht29 and caco - 2 cells ( figure 1a ) .
flow cytometry analysis confirmed abundant cell surface gp78 / amfr expression in metastatic hct116 and ht29 cells with reduced expression in caco - 2 cells ( figure 1b ) .
following incubation of the cells with 25 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc for 30 minutes at 37degreesc , amf / pgi - fitc was abundantly internalized in gp78 / amfr - positive / cav1 - negative ht29 cells relative to the other colon cell lines ( figure 1b ) , as determined by flow cytometry .
ht29 cells showed significant uptake of amf / pgi - fitc both in terms of percentage of amf / pgi - fitc positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity .
amf / pgi - fitc uptake was slightly increased in hct116 relative to caco - 2 cells but was significantly lower compared with ht29 cells .
immunofluorescence analysis shows that amf / pgi - fitc was internalized selectively by ht29 cells to the anti - gp78 / amfr labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( figure 1c ) .
increased uptake of amf / pgi - fitc in metastatic colon carcinoma cells is therefore inversely correlated with caveolin expression .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g001 figure 1 gp78 / amfr surface expression and amf / pgi - fitc endocytosis in human colon tumor cells. a. tx - 100 soluble fractions from caco - 2 , hct116 and ht29 colon cell lines were analyzed by western blot for gp78 / amfr , amf / pgi , cav1 / 2 and beta - actin , as indicated. b. caco - 2 , hct116 and ht29 human colon tumor cells were profiled for surface expression of gp78 / amfr and for amf / pgi - fitc uptake and analyzed by flow cytometry .
cells were labeled with 3f3a primary antibody followed by alexa - 647 conjugated secondary antibody .
alternatively , the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37degreesc in the presence of amf / pgi - fitc and flow cytometry of amf / pgi - fitc uptake performed after 10 min incubation in dmem containing pronase ( 400 microg / ml ) .
relative quantitative analysis of the percentage of positive cells ( top graph ) and changes in the mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) ( bottom graph ) are shown .
the data represent the average of at least three separate experiments ( mean +/ - sem ; ** , p <= 0.001 , relative to caco - 2 cells ). c. caco - 2 , hct116 and ht29 human colon tumor cells were incubated with 25 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc for 30 min prior to fixation and labeling with the 3f3a anti - gp78 / amfr monoclonal antibody followed by appropriate secondary antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy .
amf / pgi - fitc labeling is presented in green and the anti - gp78 / amfr labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum in red .
cholesterol extraction with mbetacd and inhibition of tyrosine kinases with genistein [ 40 ] inhibited the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi - fitc in ht29 cells ( figure 2a ) .
furthermore , unlabeled amf / pgi competed for amf / pgi - fitc uptake confirming that uptake in these cell lines is receptor - mediated ( figure 2a ) .
neither mbetacd nor genistein had any impact on the clathrin - dependent uptake of transferrin or cell surface gp78 / amfr expression ( figure 2a ) .
pretreatment of ht29 cells with these agents also disrupted delivery of amf / pgi - fitc to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( figure 2b ) .
adenoviral overexpression of cav1 and the dynamin - k44a mutant but not the clathrin hub , or wild - type dynamin , inhibited amf / pgi - fitc uptake in ht29 cells ( figure 2c ) .
the receptor - mediated , dynamin - dependent uptake of amf / pgi - fitc via a raft - dependent endocytic pathway to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is therefore elevated in metastatic colon carcinoma cells expressing low levels of caveolin .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g002 figure 2 amf / pgi - fitc uptake in colon carcinoma cells is raft - dependent , dynamin - dependent and negatively regulated by cav1. a. caco - 2 , hct116 and ht29 colon cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd , 100 microg / ml genistein , or an excess of unconjugated amf / pgi ( 1 mg / ml ) and then incubated with amf / pgi - fitc ( left graph ) or tf - fitc ( center graph ) , followed by incubation with pronase and flow cytometry .
surface gp78 / amfr expression of ht29 cells treated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd , or 100 microg / ml genistein , was determined by staining cells at 4degreesc with 3f3a anti - gp78 / amfr mab followed by alexa647 - conjugated secondary antibody and analysis by flow cytometry ( n = 4 ; mean +/ - s.e. ; ** , p <= 0.001 relative to control ). b. ht29 colon cells were left untreated or pretreated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd or 100 microg / ml genistein , incubated with 25 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc for 30 min prior to fixation and labeling with the 3f3a anti - gp78 / amfr monoclonal antibody followed by appropriate secondary antibodies .
amf / pgi - fitc labeling is presented in green and the anti - gp78 / amfr labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum in red. c. ht29 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing the tta alone ( control ) or coinfected with the tta adenovirus and adenoviruses coding for cav1 , clathrin hub , wild - type dynamin - 1 ( dynwt ) or mutant dynamin - 1 k44a ( dynk44a ) .
after 48 hours , amf / pgi - fitc uptake was assessed by flow cytometry ( percent positive cells ; n = 3 ; ** p <= 0.001 relative to control ) .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel is pro - apoptotic and growth inhibitory amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate at a 4.3:1 molar ratio of paclitaxel to amf / pgi dimers was prepared as previously described [ 42 ] and its specificity assessed by its ability to inhibit uptake of amf / pgi - fitc in mda - 435 cells .
mda - 435 cells were incubated with 25 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc in the presence of excess concentrations of either free amf / pgi or amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate and the uptake of amf / pgi - fitc was measured by flow cytometry ( figure 3a , left panel ) .
the ability of both amf / pgi and amf / pgi - paclitaxel to compete with amf / pgi - fitc uptake confirms that paclitaxel conjugation to amf / pgi preserves the receptor binding properties of paclitaxel conjugated amf / pgi .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g003 figure 3 the growth inhibition and pro - apoptotic effects of amf / pgi - paclitaxel. a. the specificity of amf / pgi - paclitaxel was determined by competitive binding assay .
mda - 435 cells were incubated for 60 min at 4degreesc in the presence of various concentrations ( 100 - 500 microg / ml ) of either free amf / pgi or amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate .
afterwards , cells were stained with anti - gp78 / amfr mab ( 3f3a ) and alexa647 - conjugated secondary antibody and surface expression of gp78 / amfr determined by flow cytometry ( left panel ) .
results were normalized and expressed as means +/ - se ( n = 4 ) compared to the control ( untreated cells ) .
induction of apoptosis by 10 microm staurosporine , 1 microm paclitaxel ( tx ) or 1 microm amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate was determined as described in the material and methods by flow cytometry using the annexin v - fitc assay ( right panel ) .
the growth inhibitory ability ( b , c ) and selectivity ( d ) of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate were assessed on hct116 and mcf7 cells that poorly internalize amf / pgi ( b ) and ht29 and mda - 435 cells that efficiently internalize amf / pgi ( c , d ) .
cells were treated with increasing log concentrations of paclitaxel equivalent concentrations ( 0 - 1 microm ) of free paclitaxel , amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate , or controls , as indicated , for 48 hours ( b , c ) .
alternatively , ht29 and mda - 435 cells were treated with 1 microm free paclitaxel or amf / pgi - paclitaxel in the presence or absence of a 20x fold excess of unconjugated amf / pgi for 48 hours ( d ) .
cell viability was then measured using crystal violet staining .
each measurement was done in quadruplicate and the results are presented relative to untreated control cells .
results were normalized and expressed as mean +/ - se ( n = 4 ) compared to the control ( untreated cells ) , ** , p <= 0.001 versus control .
paclitaxel is well known for its ability to arrest tumor cells in mitosis and promote apoptosis [ 43 ] .
the pro - apoptotic activity of the amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate was evaluated using an annexin v - fitc flow cytometry assay ( figure 3a , right panel ) .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel induced a significant increase in cell surface annexin v expression , when used at the same molar concentration as free paclitaxel .
the ability of amf / pgi - paclitaxel to prevent tumor cell proliferation was evaluated in vitro on ht29 colon and mda - 435 breast cells that efficiently internalize amf / pgi - fitc , as well as hct116 colon and mcf - 7 breast tumor cells , that show significantly lower uptake of amf / pgi - fitc ( figure 1 ) [ 41 ] .
cells were incubated in the presence of increasing log concentrations ( 0.001 - 1 microm ) of paclitaxel , or equimolar paclitaxel equivalents of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate , and cell number determined after 48 hours relative to control cells .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel was less efficient at inhibiting hct116 and mcf - 7 cell proliferation than free paclitaxel ( figure 3b ) , consistent with the reduced uptake of amf / pgi - fitc by these cells .
however , treatment of ht29 and mda - 435 cells with amf / pgi - paclitaxel resulted in a significant dose - dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , at least equivalent to that of free paclitaxel ( figure 3c ) .
these results , firstly , confirm that the conjugation of amf / pgi to paclitaxel did not alter the biochemical properties of free paclitaxel and , secondly , demonstrate the selectivity of the amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate towards tumor cells that efficiently internalize amf / pgi .
we then tested whether excess free amf / pgi could prevent the inhibition of cell proliferation by the amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate .
concomitant treatment of ht29 and mda - 435 cells with free amf / pgi significantly abrogated growth inhibition by amf / pgi - paclitaxel ( figure 3d ) .
these results suggest that free amf / pgi may compete with amf / pgi - paclitaxel for cell surface receptor binding .
however , excess free amf / pgi also reduced the cytotoxic effect of free paclitaxel suggesting that it may generally exhibit a pro - survival role [ 30 ] .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel may therefore inhibit cell proliferation by abrogating a prosurvival pathway associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents .
amf / pgi internalization in murine melanoma cells and tumors b16 - f1 , the original cell line in which gp78 / amfr was identified , and k1735 - m1 are highly metastatic melanoma cells , that express gp78 / amfr and respond to amf / pgi treatment [ 44 ] - [ 47 ]. by flow cytometry , both k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 cells show high levels of gp78 / amfr expression and robust uptake of amf / pgi - fitc that could be inhibited by mbetacd , genistein or 10 - fold excess free amf / pgi ( figure 4a ) .
confocal analysis confirmed that internalization of amf / pgi - fitc to the anti - gp78 / amfr labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum in both cell lines was effectively disrupted by mbetacd and genistein ( figure 4b ) .
taken together , these results confirm that in metastatic k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 murine melanoma cells , amf / pgi is internalized to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum via a raft - dependent pathway .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g004 figure 4 internalization of amf / pgi to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of murine melanoma cells is raft - dependent. a. k1735 - m1 ( grey ) and b16 - f1 ( black ) melanoma cells were left untreated ( control ) or pretreated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd , 100 microg / ml genistein , or an excess of unconjugated amf / pgi ( 1 mg / ml ) , then incubated with amf / pgi - fitc or tf - fitc , followed by incubation with pronase .
flow cytometry analysis of amf / pgi - fitc ( left panel , mean +/ - sem ; ** , p <= 0.001 ; n = 4 ) and tf - fitc ( middle ) containing cells was performed as described in material and methods .
surface gp78 / amfr expression on untreated cells ( control ) or cells treated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd or 100 microg / ml genistein , was determined by labeling with 3f3a anti - gp78 / amfr mab followed by alexa647 - conjugated secondary antibody at 4degreesc and analyzed by flow cytometry ( right panel ). b. k1735 - m1 ( left ) and b16 - f1 ( right ) melanoma cells were incubated with 25 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc for 30 min prior to fixation .
amf / pgi - fitc was revealed with rabbit anti - fitc and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum labeled with 3f3a anti - gp78 / amfr antibody followed by appropriate secondary antibodies and confocal imaging .
amf / pgi - fitc labeling is presented in green and the anti - gp78 / amfr labeled smooth endoplasmic reticulum in red .
where indicated , cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5 mm mbetacd (+ mbetacd ; middle row ) or 100 microg / ml genistein (+ gen ; bottom row ) .
furthermore , to determine whether tumor cells in situ internalize amf / pgi , we established subcutaneous ( s.c . )
k1735 - m1 tumors in the flanks of syngeneic c3h mice .
immunohistological examination of 6 micro tumor sections confirmed the high degree and uniform expression of gp78 / amfr by cells within the k1735 - m1 tumor ( figure 5a ) .
amf / pgi - fitc was then administered directly into well - established k1735 - m1 tumors .
after 6 hours mice were sacrified and the tumors resected .
one half of each tumor was used for histological analysis .
the second half was processed for flow cytometry of amf / pgi - fitc uptake in single cell suspensions generated from tumor tissue by mechanical / enzymatic digestion followed by protease treatment .
as seen in figure 5b , amf / pgi - fitc labeling in tumor sections is localized to both the cell surface and cytoplasmic region of the tumor cells , as defined by phalloidin labeling of f - actin .
furthermore , by flow cytometry , dose - dependent uptake of amf / pgi - fitc in tumor cells was observed ( figure 5c ) , demonstrating that k1735 - m1 tumor cells in situ are able to efficiently internalize fluorescently labelled amf / pgi .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g005 figure 5 gp78 / amfr expression and amf / pgi - fitc uptake in primary tumors. a. k1735 - m1 tumor sections were immunohistochemically labeled with anti - gp78 / amfr antibody followed by biotinylated secondary antibody , hrp - conjugated avidin - biotin complex and staining with dab .
control sections were labeled in parallel in the absence of primary antibody. b. k1735 - m1 tumor sections from tumors injected with pbs ( control ) or 250 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc were labeled with hoechst nuclear stain ( blue ) and alexa568 - phalloidin ( red ) and images acquired by confocal microscopy using equivalent acquisition settings .
fitc labeling ( green ) in amf / pgi - fitc injected tumors overlapped extensively with phalloidin - labeled actin ( red ). c. pbs and amf / pgi - fitc injected k1735 - m1 tumors were mechanically dissociated , treated with pronase and analyzed for amf / pgi - fitc positivity by flow cytometry .
the data represent the average of seven different tumors ( mean +/ - sem ; ** , p <= 0.001 , relative to pbs injected tumors ) .
in vivo efficacy of amf / pgi - paclitaxel to test our approach in mice , we used two melanoma tumor models , k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 .
in vitro treatment of k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 cells with increasing log concentrations ( 0.001 - 1 microm ) of free paclitaxel , or with equimolar concentrations of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate , resulted in a dose - dependent inhibition of cell proliferation ( figure 6a,b ) .
however , far lower concentrations of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate , compared to free paclitaxel , were needed to evoke an antiproliferative effect in both cell lines .
the concentration at which proliferation of k1735 - m1 cells was inhibited by 50 % ( ic50 ) was 0.1 microm with amf / pgi - paclitaxel compared to 1 microm for free paclitaxel ( p < 0.001 ; figure 6a , left panel ) .
b16 - f1 melanoma cells were not sensitive to paclitaxel alone however their proliferation was efficiently inhibited by equimolar concentrations of amf / pgi - paclitaxel ( fig. 6b , left panel ) .
as observed for ht29 and mda - 435 cells ( figure 3 ) , the ability of amf / pgi - paclitaxel to inhibit cell proliferation of both k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 cells was inhibited by the concomitant addition of excess amf / pgi .
amf / pgi alone did not affect proliferation of either k1735 - m1 or b16 - f1 cells but did inhibit paclitaxel - mediated inhibition of cell proliferation of k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 cells ( figure 6a , b ; right panels ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g006 figure 6 anti - tumor efficacy of amf / pgi - paclitaxel in k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 melanoma tumor models .
the effect of amf / pgi - paclitaxel on inhibition of k1735 - m1 ( a ) and b16 - f1 ( b ) melanoma cell proliferation in vitro was determined by crystal violet staining .
cells were seeded at initial density of 5x103 cells / well in 96 - well plates , allowed to attach overnight and treated with increasing log concentrations ( 0 - 1 microm ) of either free paclitaxel or amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate ( left panel ) .
alternatively cells were treated with 1 microm free paclitaxel or amf / pgi - paclitaxel in the presence or absence of a 20x fold excess of unconjugated amf / pgi for 48 hours ( right panel ) .
cell viability was then measured using crystal violet staining .
each measurement was performed in quadruplicate and the results are presented relative to untreated control cells .
in vivo tumor regression ( left ) and survival ( right ) in mice bearing k1735 - m1 ( c ) or b16 - f1 ( d ) melanoma s.c. tumors were measured after i.t. treatment with amf / pgi - paclitaxel .
k1735 - m1 ( c ) or b16 - f1 ( d ) melanoma cells were injected s.c. into the flank of c3h or c57 / bl6 mice , respectively , and tumor volumes measured every other day .
as indicated , mice were injected i.t. for five consecutive days with paclitaxel ( tx , *) , amf / pgi and paclitaxel ( amf / pgi + tx , o ) , amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate ( amf / pgi - tx , *) and , for b16 - f1 tumors , amf / pgi and amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate ( amf / pgi + amf / pgi - tx , *) .
control mice (^) received injections of diluent ( sterile pbs ) .
results show means +/ - s.e. for amf / pgi - paclitaxel group versus free paclitaxel and control groups : k1735 - m1 ( tumor regression : p <= 0.001 ; survival : p <= 0.05 ) ; b16 - f1 ( tumor regression : p <= 0.05 ; p <= 0.05 ) .
in k1735 - m1 tumors , complete regression of tumor growth was observed in three out of sixteen tumors after treatment with five consecutive daily i.t. injections of amf / pgi - paclitaxel .
we next examined the effect of the amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate on tumor growth and survival in the k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 syngeneic mouse melanoma tumor models .
well - defined tumors 50 - 60 mm3 in volume were formed approximately 11 - 13 days after s.c. injection of c3h mice with k1735 - m1 and of c57 / bl6 mice with b16 - f1 melanoma cells , at which time the treatment was initiated .
intratumoral injections of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate ( 300 ng paclitaxel ) on five consecutive days resulted in a consistent measurable difference in tumor size between the control and amf / pgi - paclitaxel treated animals in both k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 models ( figure 6c , d ) .
in the k1735 - m1 model , there was significant tumor regression on day 25 , with most of the animals treated with amf / pgi - paclitaxel exhibiting tumors that were much smaller compared to untreated mice ( figure 6c , left panel ) .
twenty - five days after subcutaneous implantation of k1735 - m1 cells , the mean tumor volume was 637 +/ - 112 mm3 for the mice that received i.t. injections of diluent compared to 58 +/ - 27 mm3 for the mice that received i.t. injections of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate .
statistical analysis with the student - t two - sample test confirmed that mean tumor volume was significantly smaller in the group treated with amf / pgi - paclitaxel , compared with the group treated with diluent alone ( p < 0.001 ) .
intratumoral injections of free paclitaxel also resulted in tumor regression .
the mean tumor volume for the 8 animals that received intratumoral free paclitaxel injections was 229 +/ - 65 mm3 , however free paclitaxel was significantly less effective compared to amf / pgi - paclitaxel treatment ( p < 0.05 ) .
the median survival time ( mst ) of untreated mice was 21 ( 17 - 25 ) days , and because of tumor burden all mice from this group were terminated by day 25 ( figure 6c , right panel ) .
mice treated with 5 consecutive i.t. injections of free paclitaxel ( 300 ng ) showed improved , although not statistically significant , survival compared to untreated mice .
mst for this treatment group was 25 ( 19 - 39 ) days and 1 of 8 mice was still alive after 39 days .
the treatment of tumor bearing mice with intratumoral injections of amf / pgi - paclitaxel conjugate significantly prolonged their survival compared with untreated controls ( p < 0.05 ) .
the median survival time of this group was 27 days ( 17 - 39 days ) , and 3 of 8 mice were still alive after 39 days , not having tumor relapse and exhibiting tumor regression of 90 % .
this efficacy was not associated with measurable physical and behavioural changes ( weight loss , sickness , aggressiveness , or decreased physical activity ) , suggesting that the short term treatment with amf / pgi - paclitaxel was efficacious and without detrimental side effects .
results obtained from the b16 - f1 melanoma model show that neither paclitaxel alone nor paclitaxel plus amf / pgi affected b16 - f1 tumor growth .
while paclitaxel alone did not impact on tumor size , amf / pgi - paclitaxel significantly ( p < 0.05 ) suppressed tumor growth of b16 - f1 tumors ( figure 6d , left panel ) .
median survival time of amf / pgi - paclitaxel treated mice was 29 ( 19 - 32 ) days compared to 20 ( 19 - 22 ) days for untreated and 21 ( 19 - 24 ) days for taxol treated mice , and significantly prolonged survival ( p < 0.05 ) .
( figure 6d , right panel ) .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel therefore suppresses tumor growth and extends the survival time of mice bearing primary b16 - f1 tumors more effectively than an equimolar dose of free paclitaxel .
mice receiving combinatorial treatment with amf / pgi - paclitaxel and free amf / pgi had no effect on tumor growth regression or median survival time compared to control treatments in both the k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 primary melanoma tumor models ( figure 6c,d ) .
free amf / pgi also effectively abrogated the anti - tumor effect of free paclitaxel in the k1735 - m1 model suggesting that amf / pgi may exhibit a pro - survival , anti - chemotherapeutic activity in vivo .
selective targeting of tumor and not normal immune cells upon systemic delivery of amf / pgi amf / pgi exhibits lymphokine activity and is a maturation factor for cells of immune lineage [ 14 ] , [ 17 ] .
we therefore assessed gp78 / amfr expression in lymphoid tissues from adult immunocompetent mice .
immunohistochemical labeling of spleen and thymus tissue sections was performed using the anti - gp78 / amfr mab .
tissue sections of early neonatal mouse brain and hct116 colon tumor were included as positive controls .
strong positive gp78 / amfr staining was detected in 20 day old hct116 colon tumor sections as well as in 5 - day old mouse brain , as previously reported in developing rat brain [ 48 ] .
immunoreactivity in the brain and tumor sections was localized to both the cytoplasm and the cell surface .
however anti - gp78 / amfr labeling was not detected in adult spleen and thymus sections ( figure 7a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003597.g007 figure 7 gp78 / amfr expression and amf / pgi uptake in normal mouse immune tissue and cells. a. immunohistochemical labeling of tissue sections showed no gp78 / amfr reactivity in normal mouse spleen and thymus .
however , strong positive gp78 / amfr staining was detected in 5 day old mouse brain tissue and in 20 day old hct116 s.c. tumor sections .
a representative experiment of eight is shown ( original magnification , x50 and x200 ). b. cell surface gp78 / amfr expression ( top panel ) and amf / pgi - fitc uptake ( bottom panel ) of single cell suspensions prepared from mouse spleen and thymus , an enriched population of spleen macrophages as well as mda - 435 cells were assessed by flow cytometry and the percentage of positive cells is presented .
the data represent the average of three separate experiments ( mean +/ - sem ; ** , p <= 0.001 ).). c. b16 - f1 melanoma tumors were established s.c. in c57 / bl6 mice and after 12 days , mice were injected i.v. with pbs , 250 microg / ml amf / pgi - fitc or an equivalent concentration of free fitc .
after two hours , spleen , thymus and b16 - f1 s.c. tumors were mechanically dissociated , treated with pronase and analyzed for fitc positivity by flow cytometry .
the data represent the average of six different tumors ( mean +/ - sem ; ** , p <= 0.001 , relative to pbs injected mice ) .
we then used flow cytometry to evaluate gp78 / amfr surface expression and amf / pgi uptake in single cell suspensions prepared from spleens and thymuses , as well as in an enriched population of spleen macrophages .
relative to mda - 435 cells , included as a positive control [ 41 ] , both gp78 / amfr cell surface staining and amf / pgi - fitc uptake were dramatically lower ( 40 - fold ) in the primary immune cells ( figure 7b ) .
only 2 % of splenic cells and thymocytes were gp78 / amfr positive .
surface gp78 / amfr expression was slightly higher in the enriched population of splenic macrophages but amf / pgi - fitc uptake was not increased ( figure 7b ) .
both gp78 / amfr surface expression and amf / pgi uptake are therefore significantly lower in normal immune cells relative to tumor cells .
to assess whether systemic delivery of amf / pgi could selectively target tumor cells , mice bearing s.c .
b16 - f1 melanoma tumors were injected i.v. with amf / pgi - fitc , free fitc or pbs alone .
two hours following i.v. injection , we performed flow cytometry on single cell suspensions prepared from spleen , thymus and tumor tissues ( figure 7c ) .
we detected no significant fluorescence in cells from all three sources following injection of pbs or free fitc .
however , we were able to detect selective uptake of amf / pgi - fitc in approximately 25 % of the tumor cells and essentially no uptake in spleen or thymus cells .
this suggests that systemic i.v. administration is potentially a valid and selective delivery route for amf / pgi - conjugated molecules to tumor cells .
discussion tumor heterogeneity is a hallmark of neoplastic disease .
tumor - specific therapies , targeting specific molecular characteristics of human malignancies through a prescreening process , have increasingly become adopted into clinical practice .
amf / pgi represents an ideal carrier for drug delivery in that it is a native protein circulating at high levels in serum [ 32 ] - [ 37 ] , is the ligand for a receptor , gp78 / amfr , significantly associated with malignancy in a broad range of human cancer types [ 7 ] and is internalized via a distinct , tumor - associated raft - dependent endocytic pathway [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
the demonstration here of upregulated gp78 / amfr expression and increased amf / pgi uptake by tumor cells relative to normal immune cells further supports the tumor specificity of the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi .
the lack of gp78 / amfr expression in adult thymus and spleen is consistent with previous reports of the reduced expression of gp78 / amfr in adult brain relative to developing brain [ 48 ] .
this suggests that gp78 / amfr expression may be enhanced during development and that the role of amf / pgi in lymphocyte maturation [ 13 ] may be absent or limited in normal adult immune tissue .
therefore , while amf / pgi is a ubiquitous cytokine with multiple cellular targets , increased gp78 / amfr expression in cancer and low expression in normal adult tissue , suggests that circulating amf / pgi may preferentially interact with gp78 / amfr expressing tumor cells relative to normal cells .
selectivity of the amf / pgi raft - dependent pathway for tumor cells is certainly related to expression of its receptor by target cells .
however , the sorting mechanism that segregates amf / pgi - internalizing rafts from other endocytic raft domains and delivers internalized amf / pgi to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum remains unclear .
the selective uptake of amf / pgi , amongst other studied raft endocytic ligands , via this pathway to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is consistent with a role for amf / pgi binding in raft domain segregation and endocytosis .
the role of cav1 as a negative regulator of raft - dependent uptake of amf / pgi in tumor cells [ 39 ] , [ 41 ] is supported here by the demonstration that metastatic cav1 - expressing hct116 colon tumor cells show reduced uptake of amf / pgi relative to ht29 cells .
compilation of data obtained on the same breast cancer tissue microarray probed with antibodies to gp78 / amfr and cav1 [ 41 ] , [ 49 ] shows that gp78 / amfr and cav1 tumor cohorts do not correlate with one another ( p = 0.421 ) .
together with the lack of gp78 / amfr correlation with her2 [ 41 ] , this suggests that gp78 / amfr labeling defines a substantial cohort of tumors that cannot be treated with her2 - targeted therapy and that should , in the absence of cav1 , internalize amf / pgi .
cav1 may function to sequester critical effectors that regulate the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi [ 50 ] .
the positive correlation of gp78 / amfr and pakt expression in an invasive breast cancer tumor cohort , the pi3k sensitivity of amf / pgi uptake and the ability of amf / pgi to stimulate pi3k - dependent cell survival suggests that pi3k is such an effector [ 30 ] , [ 41 ] .
however , the relationship between raft - dependent amf / pgi uptake and its role as a prosurvival factor remains to be determined .
the ability of free amf / pgi to protect cells from cell death induced not only by amf / pgi - paclitaxel but also by free paclitaxel suggests that amf / pgi may be generally exerting a prosurvival effect on tumor cells .
paclitaxel is a common clinically utilized chemotherapeutic drug and elevated levels of circulating amf / pgi in cancer patients may therefore function to suppress its pro - apoptotic effects , and potentially have similar effects on other chemotherapeutic drugs .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel may therefore be targeting a pi3k / akt - dependent pathway that is critical for tumor cell survival and promotes resistance to commonly employed chemotherapeutic drugs .
indeed , the ability of amf / pgi - paclitaxel to suppress the proliferation of paclitaxel - resistant b16 - f1 melanoma cells in vitro and to significantly delay b16 - f1 tumor growth in vivo , suggests that it may bypass or override the drug resistance of these cells .
paclitaxel is an established chemotherapeutic drug and has been shown to be efficacious when conjugated to various anti - cancer agents [ 51 ] .
the data presented here demonstrate that amf / pgi can mediate drug delivery to gp78 / amfr expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo .
use of amf / pgi as a carrier of a chemotherapeutic drug represents a novel therapeutic approach unique in that , firstly , it utilizes a native circulating protein that should not elicit an immune response and , secondly , it targets a receptor that is over - expressed and actively internalized via a distinct endocytic pathway by specific cancers .
use of amf / pgi thereby addresses a major challenge for targeted therapeutics , designing a carrier system for effective intracellular drug delivery .
the ability of amf / pgi - paclitaxel to induce tumor regression and promote survival upon intratumoral injection of k1735 - m1 and b16 - f1 tumors identifies the raft - dependent endocytosis of amf / pgi as a novel drug delivery route for tumor cells .
amf / pgi - paclitaxel is therefore a potential therapeutic agent for targeted treatment of select cohorts of tumors resistant to currently utilized chemotherapeutic drugs .

this reaction forms an ester bond at the c2 ' position of paclitaxel .
the solvent was then removed in vacuo , and the residue was dissolved in chcl3 and washed with double - distilled h2o .

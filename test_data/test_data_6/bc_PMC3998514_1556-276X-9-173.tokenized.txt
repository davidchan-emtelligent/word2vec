large - area periodically aligned silicon nanopillar ( pasinp ) arrays were fabricated by magnetic sputtering with glancing angle deposition ( glad ) on substrates coated by a monolayer of close - packed polystyrene ( ps ) nanospheres .
the structure of pasinp arrays could be manipulated by changing the diameter of ps nanospheres .
enhanced light absorptance within a wavelength range from 300 to 1,000 nm was observed as the diameter of nanopillars and porosity of pasinp arrays increased .
meanwhile , xe ion irradiation with dose from 1 x 1014 to 50 x 1014 ions / cm2 was employed to modify the surface morphology and top structure of thin films , and the effect of the irradiation on the optical bandgap was discussed .
pacs code 81.15.cd ; 78.66.jg ; 61.80.jh enhanced light absorption silicon irridiation background with the development of society , problems of energy crisis and environment pollution have been of further concern .
in order to maintain sustainable growth , a clean and renewable energy source is urgently required .
among all new types of energy sources , solar energy is the most promising one for it is safe , cheap , inexhaustible , and environment - friendly .
in 1976 , carlson and wronski [ 1 ] invented a new type of thin film solar cell that utilized amorphous silicon ( a - si ) deposited from a glow discharge in silane ( sih4 ) and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 2.4 % in am - 1 sunlight .
after that , silicon thin film solar cells have been widely investigated in different ways and methods [ 2 ] .
compared with conventional solar cell , amorphous silicon thin film solar cell is low cost and could be deposited on various substrates such as glass , stainless steel , ceramic plate , and plastic [ 3 ] .
studies focused on textured surface showed that it can improve absorption by reducing reflection .
textured surface can be conventionally obtained by either dry or wet ion etching [ 4 - 7 ] .
in 2011 , wong and yu [ 8 ] simulated a nanopillar - array - textured surface and came to a conclusion that it may enhance light absorption and increase the efficiency of the silicon - based solar cell .
the effects of low - energy heavy ion irradiation on silicon thin film have been systematically studied during the past 50 years .
during the irradiation , some traditional defects were generated ; however , latent tracks , amorphous transition , or other special effects were not observed [ 9,10 ] .
enhanced light absorption was obtained in works on n - type crystal silicon irradiated by high - energy xe ion [ 11 ] , which provided a promising method for the modification of amorphous silicon thin film .
in this research , we coated a polystyrene ( ps ) sphere monolayer on glass substrate and fabricated silicon thin film via magnetic sputtering with glancing angle deposition ( glad ) in order to achieve periodically aligned silicon nanopillar ( pasinp ) arrays .
the influences of silicon nanopillar diameter and xe ion irradiation on the light absorption of thin film were studied .
the mechanism of ion irradiation was also discussed .
we replicate this nanostructure by magnetic sputtering deposition with its advantage of controllable fabrication , and an expected enhancement in light absorption was observed .
methods glasses were first cut into squares of about 3 x 3 cm2 in size and then thoroughly cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min .
after washing off the residual acetone by deionized water , they were cleaned with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for another 20 min .
the glasses were immersed in h2so4 - h2o2 solution ( 3:1 , v / v ) for 8 h and then cleaned with deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and with nh3 - h2o2 - h2o solution ( 1:1:3 , v / v ) for another 30 min .
after that , glasses with hydrophilic surfaces were obtained [ 12 ] .
ps nanospheres with different diameters of 200 , 500 , and 1,000 nm were selected here .
ten microliters of ps solution ( 10 wt. %) was distributed onto a piece of glass which was placed on a spin coater .
the solution was spread and dried to form a monolayer .
details are shown in table 1 .

the sputtering power was 90 w and the voltage was 0.5 kv. afterwards , films deposited on the 200 - nm ps nanosphere monolayer were irradiated by 200 - kev xe ion with doses of 1 x 1014 , 5 x 1014 , 10 x 1014 , and 50 x 1014 ion / cm2 , in order to investigate its influence on the light absorption of thin film .
the morphology of films was observed by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .
the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were tested by rigaku x - ray analytical instrument ( rigaku corporation , tokyo , japan ) .
the transmittance ( t ) and reflectance ( r ) spectra within the wavelength range from 300 to 1,000 nm were recorded by a uv - vis - nir spectrometer .
results and discussion the morphology of the ps nanosphere monolayer was shown in the insets of figure 1 .
ps nanospheres were self - assembled into a monolayer , and a highly ordered area of about 50 mum2 was obtained .
for the 500 - and 1,000 - nm ps nanosphere monolayers , the arrays were nearly hexagonal and close - packed .
however , for the 200 - nm ps nanosphere monolayer , the distribution was less regular and there were many vacancies and dislocations due to the kinetic limitations during the drying process [ 13,14 ] .
figure 1 cross - sectional view of silicon nanopillar arrays deposited on substrates coated by ps nanospheres with different diameters .
( a ) 0 ( plain glass ) , ( b ) 200 nm , ( c ) 500 nm , and ( d ) 1,000 nm. the insets show the morphology of the corresponding ps nanosphere monolayer .
after 90 min of deposition , films with thickness of about 700 nm were obtained , as shown in figure 1 .
they were marked after their deposition time and the diameter of ps nanospheres as 90 - 0 , 90 - 200 , 90 - 500 , and 90 - 1000 ; 0 represented the plain glass , which was used for comparison .
for the films deposited on patterned substrates , owing to glad and shadowing effect , each nanosphere leads to the formation of one nanopillar .
the size of nanopillars is determined by the diameter of the ps nanospheres beneath , and the nanopillar arrays replicate the close - packed pattern of the monolayer .
nanopillars separate from each other , and porosity rises as the diameter increases .
silicon atoms were randomly deposited on the ps nanosphere monolayer during the glad process , and thin films were not annealed afterwards and thus cannot develop into crystals .
the xrd pattern of sample 90 - 200 is shown in figure 2 .
no typical peak for crystal silicon can be found in this pattern , as well as for the other three , which indicates that these films are composed of amorphous silicon .
figure 2 xrd patterns of films deposited on substrates coated by ps nanospheres with diameter of 200 nm. the absorptance ( a ) spectra shown in figure 3 was calculated by equation 1 .
( 1 ) a = 1 - t - r figure 3 absorptance spectra of films deposited on substrates coated by ps nanospheres with different diameters .
the film deposited on plain glass showed poor absorptance of lower than 10 % , especially within a wavelength above 800 nm. in comparison , the absorptance of films deposited on patterned substrates enhances appreciably to more than 80 % .
as the diameter of the nanopillar increases , the absorptance of the corresponding film rises within the whole wavelength range .
the positive correlation between absorptance and diameter can be attributed to the increasing porosity of the nanostructure , which extensively lengthens the path of incident light and enhances the absorptance [ 8 ] .
in order to evaluate the optical bandgap of the thin film , the tauc formula was utilized [ 15 ] .
( 2 ) alphahnun = ahnu - eg ( 3 ) alpha = lnt / d in equation 2 , alpha is the calculated absorption coefficient of the film which can be derived from equation 3 , d is the thickness of film and it was set as 700 nm here , hv is the energy of photon , a is a constant , n is 1 / 2 for indirect band material in this case , and e g is the optical bandgap .
we extrapolate the linear part of the ( alphahnu ) 1 / 2 - hnu plot to the x - axis , and the intercept is regarded as the calculated optical bandgap .
the schematic diagram and results are shown in figure 4 and table 2 , respectively .
figure 4 schematic diagram of tauc plot .
tauc plot was used to measure the optical bandgap of the film deposited for 90 min on a substrate coated by 1,000 - nm ps nanospheres .
table 2 the optical bandgap of thin films as deposited diameter ( nm ) 0 200 500 1,000 e g ( ev ) 2.10 1.83 1.77 1.50 the reduction of optical bandgap is in accordance with the increase of absorptance .
a material can only absorb photons with energy higher than its bandgap , so optical bandgap holds the essence of light absorption and the absorptance depends straightly on optical bandgap .
the manipulation of optical bandgap would have direct influence on absorptance .
to investigate the influence of ion irradiation on the optical bandgap of amorphous silicon thin film , films deposited on the 200 - nm ps nanosphere layer were irradiated by 200 - kev xe ion with doses of 1 x 1014 , 5 x 1014 , 10 x 1014 , and 50 x 1014 ions / cm2 .
the cross - sectional views of irradiated film are shown in figure 5 .
figure 5 the cross - sectional views of irradiated films with different doses .
( a ) 1 x 1014 ions / cm2 , ( b ) 5 x 1014 ions / cm2 , ( c ) 10 x 1014 ions / cm2 , and ( d ) 50 x 1014 ions / cm2 .
in the view of the original film shown in figure 1b , silicon nanopillars are separated from each other .
after ion irradiation , the top part of silicon nanopillars melted and recrystallized during the process. with the increasing of irradiation dose , the top part of the silicon nanopillars tends to connect with its neighbors , while the bottom part remains unaffected .
the optical bandgap of thin film after the irradiation was also calculated , as shown in table 3 .
the optical bandgap decreases rapidly as the irradiation dose rises from 0 to 10 x 1014 ions / cm2 .
after that , as the irradiation dose rises from 10 x 1014 ions / cm2 to 50 x 1014 ions / cm2 , it gradually levels off .
table 3 optical bandgap after irradiation irradiation dose ( 10 14 ions / cm 2 ) 1 5 10 50 e g ( ev ) 1.64 1.52 1.46 1.42 as shown in figure 6 , ion irradiation has distinct influence on the optical bandgap of the original film , but it may lead to a limitation as the irradiation dose increases .
the optical bandgap exponential decays with the irradiation dose , and the fitting formula of the curve is eg = 0.2662xe - dose5.1426 + 1.4205 .
previous research showed that the optical bandgap decreased as the grain size of silicon expanded [ 16 ] , which suggests that a possible recrystallization mechanism happened during the ion irradiation process .
figure 6 the negative exponential relation between the optical bandgap and the irradiation dose .
conclusions we prepared self - assembled monolayers of ps nanospheres and fabricated periodically aligned silicon nanopillar arrays by magnetic sputtering deposition .
we improve the absorptance of thin film by changing the diameter of the silicon nanopillar. with the increase of the diameter of the nanopillar , optical bandgap decreases and absorptance increases .
the influence of xe ion irradiation on the optical bandgap was also investigated .
the bandgap decreases with the increase of irradiation dose .
it may be induced by the recrystallization during the irradiation and lead to the change in grain size , which is closely related to the bandgap of the film .

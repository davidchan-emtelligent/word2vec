liver metastases are commonly encountered in patients presenting with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mcrc ) ; resection is the treatment of choice .
a number of systemic treatment options are currently available for such patients , including the use of 5 - fluorouracil - based chemotherapies and oxaliplatin ( e.g. , folfox ) in combination with biologic agents that target angiogenesis ( e.g. , bevacizumab ) .
for patients with progression following first - line treatment , current second - line options include a change in chemotherapy with bevacizumab ( for patients who did or did not receive prior bevacizumab ) or folfiri in combination with aflibercept , a more recently approved antiangiogenesis therapy .
neurotoxicity is a well - established adverse event of oxaliplatin - based therapy .
the current case details an mcrc patient with liver metastases who was treated with a capecitabine and oxaliplatin regimen ( xelox ) , and experienced two episodes of transient cortical blindness possibly related to oxaliplatin .
after disease progression , the patient was switched to a regimen of folfiri and aflibercept and did well on this second - line regimen .
1. introduction in patients presenting with liver metastases in the context of metastatic colorectal cancer ( mcrc ) , surgical resection is the treatment of choice where possible ; for patients undergoing hepatic resection , five - year actuarial survival in some series ranges from 30 % to over 50 % [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , these patients remain at a high risk for relapse , with hepatic recurrence rates of up to 75 % [ 2 ] .
the current first - line options for systemic antitumor treatment include the use of 5 - fluorouracil - ( 5 - fu - ) based therapies with oxaliplatin ( e.g. , folfox ) with or without the use of an antiangiogenesis agent ( bevacizumab ) [ 1 ] .
the use of perioperative folfox improves three - year survival rates by up to 8 % , and postoperative folfox can also be considered in patients with no perioperative treatment [ 2 ] .
although most patients typically present with unresectable disease , the use of regressive chemotherapies is indicated to convert patients to resectable status [ 1 ] .
indeed , the evolution of 5 - fu - based chemotherapies in recent years has helped to improve resectability rates with the addition of agents such as oxaliplatin or irinotecan to these regimens [ 3 ] .
choice of pre - and / or postoperative chemotherapy depends on factors such as treatment history , patient response , and safety / toxicity issues [ 1 ] .
the optimal sequence of chemotherapy relative to resection is unclear ; for patients with resectable disease , perioperative treatment ( neoadjuvant and postoperative ) can be followed by resection , or resection can be followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment [ 1 ] .
2. case presentation the patient is a 61 - year - old woman who initially presented to her primary care provider in january 2012 with some hematochezia and diarrhea accompanied by lower abdominal pain .
after a change in diet failed to resolve her symptoms , she subsequently underwent a computed tomography ( ct ) scan , which showed severe proctocolitis .
the patient was administered steroids in addition to metronidazole , but her symptoms did not resolve .
she underwent a colonoscopy in june 2012 , which showed the presence of a mass nearly obstructing the rectum .
on june 21 , 2012 , she underwent a low anterior resection of a stage iv rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma ( approximately 5 x 4 x 1.5 cm ) .
the tumor was moderately differentiated .
a wedge resection of a left hepatic lobe was performed at the same time and yielded a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma consistent with the primary rectal tumor .
colostomy formation was also performed at that time .
her pathology review showed clear margins of the rectal primary , positive margin of the liver resection , and five of 15 lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma .
the patient tolerated the procedure well , except for bilateral extremity lymphedema starting two to three weeks after surgery , which improved with compression stockings .
a subsequent ct scan showed the presence of a secondary liver lesion as well as a 1.2 cm portacaval lymph node , positive for metastatic carcinoma with positron emission tomography ( pet ) ct. otherwise , no lymphadenopathy in the chest , abdomen , or pelvis was found .
pelvic radiotherapy was started with a total dose between 45 and 54 gy on september 24 , 2012 .
at about that time ( september 2012 ) , the patient was started on xelox chemotherapy ( oxaliplatin 100 mg / m2 over two hours , day 1 , every three weeks ; capecitabine 850 mg / m2 orally twice daily , days 1 to 14 , every three weeks ) and received approximately three cycles .
although the patient tolerated the first cycle well , the day after chemotherapy she had one isolated episode of complete blindness in her right eye , which lasted 15 seconds .
a similar but shorter episode lasting between eight and 10 seconds occurred during the second cycle of xelox .
the last ( third ) cycle was not completed due to the occurrence of grade 2 thrombocytopenia during cycle 2 and grade 3 thrombocytopenia during cycle 3 ; capecitabine was continued without oxaliplatin during cycle 3 .
bevacizumab was also not given in combination with the chemotherapy due to the proximity of her prior liver and rectal surgery and subsequent issues with thrombocytopenia .
restaging scans showed that after three chemotherapy cycles she appeared to have complete resolution of the one pet - avid liver lesion but persistence of the second liver lesion and the portacaval lymph node .
given those findings , as well as worsening preexisting thrombocytopenia , it was the consensus of the tumor board to give the patient additional therapy with folfiri ( irinotecan 180 mg / m2 intravenously ( iv ) , over 90 minutes , with folinic acid 400 mg / m2 , over 120 minutes , followed by fluorouracil 400 mg / m2 iv bolus , then fluorouracil 2400 mg / m2 iv infusion , over 46 hours ) in combination with aflibercept ( 4 mg / kg iv infusion over one hour , every two weeks ) , a recently approved angiogenesis inhibitor for mcrc , which was initiated on december 17 , 2012 .
adverse events ( aes ) occurring on the folfiri / aflibercept regimen were grade 1 / 2 diarrhea , which was managed with loperamide and diphenoxylate / atropine , and grade 1 nausea , managed with palonosetron ; a wig was also used due to alopecia .
she had completed four cycles and was due for restaging scans at the end of the week but then presented for evaluation due to persistent pelvic pain following surgery .
she had had stable disease ; therefore , on march 26 , 2013 , she was sent for liver and nodal resection .
the patient did quite well postoperatively and had no new complaints .
after her reresection , she was started on maintenance capecitabine ( 1000 mg orally twice daily , days 1 to 14 , every 21 days ) due to a high recurrence risk .
as of may 1 , 2013 , she continues to do well with no evidence of disease and is being followed up for a low pelvic mass on radiography , which could reflect infection , postsurgical changes , or drop metastasis .
evolution of the patient 's carcinoembryonic antigen level is shown in figure 1 .
3. discussion metastatic liver involvement is commonly encountered in patients diagnosed with mcrc ; liver metastasis is a common cause of death in these patients [ 1 ] .
in patients with solitary or confined liver metastases , primary resection should be considered [ 2 ] .
improvements in perioperative morbidity and mortality over the last few decades have allowed hepatic resection to become an option for an increasing range of patients with mcrc and liver metastases [ 4 ] .
the combination of chemotherapy and surgical resection is another option for the vast majority of patients who present with initially unresectable disease , in whom five - year survival is uniformly grim [ 5 ]. with the use of advanced chemotherapy , resectability rates between 12 % and 22 % can be achieved in these patients , with five - year survival rates of up to 35 % observed after subsequent resection [ 3 ] .
oxaliplatin in combination with 5 - fu or capecitabine ( capeox or xelox ) is frequently used as first - line therapy for patients with mcrc [ 1 , 2 ] .
a large phase 3 study of over 2000 patients found xelox to be noninferior to folfox , with a median progression - free survival ( pfs ) of 8.0 and 8.5 months reported for patients in the pooled analysis for the xelox and folfox treatment arms , respectively ; the corresponding median overall survival ( os ) was 19.8 and 19.6 months , respectively [ 6 , 7 ] .
aes were similar between xelox and folfox regimens , with similar rates of grade 3 / 4 neurosensory toxicity ( 17 %) , whereas hand - foot syndrome and diarrhea were more frequently observed in the xelox arms [ 7 ] .
a similar benefit of xelox and folfox in terms of curative effect has also been reported in a meta - analysis of seven randomized , controlled trials [ 1 , 8 ] .
use of xelox or folfox in combination with the antiangiogenesis agent bevacizumab as first - line therapy in mcrc has been studied in the no16966 trial ; approximately 40 % of patients in each treatment arm had a single metastatic site in this study .
results of no16966 showed improvement in pfs for chemotherapy regimens ( xelox or folfox ) with bevacizumab compared with placebo ( 9.4 versus 8.0 months ; hazard ratio ( hr ) = 0.83 ; p = 0.0023 ) , although response rate was similar , and there was no significant benefit in os ( 21.3 versus 19.9 months , resp. ; p = 0.0769 ) [ 9 ] .
it is believed that differences in duration of therapy and discontinuation rates may have accounted for the lack of improvement in os in this study [ 1 , 9 ] .
aflibercept , which is known as ziv - aflibercept in the united states , is a recently approved antiangiogenic agent that is designed to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) pathway by binding not only vegf - a ( like bevacizumab ) but also vegf - b and placental growth factor ( plgf ) ligands .
inhibition of these endogenous ligands by aflibercept prevents binding to their cognate cellular receptors , vegf receptor ( vegfr ) 2 and vegfr1 ( in the case of vegf - a ) and vegfr1 ( in the case of vegf - b and plgf ) [ 10 ] .
this activity of aflibercept results in decreased neovascularization and decreased vascular permeability ; in mice , the in vivo growth of colon tumor xenografts is inhibited by aflibercept [ 10 ] .
aflibercept is indicated in combination with folfiri for patients with mcrc that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin - containing regimen [ 1 , 10 ] .
efficacy and safety of aflibercept were examined in the velour trial , a randomized , double - blind , multinational study , which randomized mcrc patients ( n = 1226 ) previously treated with an oxaliplatin - containing regimen to treatment with aflibercept or placebo in combination with folfiri .
patients were allowed to have received prior bevacizumab , and the primary end point was os [ 11 ] .
the percentage of patients with metastatic liver involvement at baseline ( exclusive of the primary site ) was 70.2 % and 75.0 % in the placebo and aflibercept arms , respectively , and 54.9 % and 57.8 % of patients had > 1 metastatic site [ 11 ] .
results from velour demonstrated a median os of 13.50 months for patients in the aflibercept plus folfiri arm compared with 12.06 months for patients in the placebo plus folfiri arm ( hr = 0.817 ; p = 0.0032 ) .
significant improvements in pfs ( hr = 0.758 ; p < 0.0001 ) and response rate ( p < 0.001 ) were also observed [ 11 ] .
vegf - related grade 3 and grade 4 aes included hypertension , hemorrhage , arterial thromboembolic events , and venous thromboembolic events [ 11 ] .
leukopenia , diarrhea , neutropenia , proteinuria , increased aspartate aminotransferase , stomatitis , fatigue , thrombocytopenia , increased alanine aminotransferase , hypertension , decreased weight , decreased appetite , epistaxis , abdominal pain , dysphonia , increased serum creatinine , and headache were the most commonly observed aes with aflibercept ( all grades >= 20 % incidence , >= 2 % between arm difference ) .
in the present case , the patient did quite well on the aflibercept plus folfiri regimen , with minimal ( grades 1 and 2 ) aes .
she achieved a possible cure from the therapy , although she will require additional follow - up. although not routinely administered , the use of fixed - dose maintenance capecitabine therapy in this patient is appropriate to reduce her recurrence risk while allowing for improved quality of life [ 12 ] .
in a retrospective study of 28 patients receiving maintenance capecitabine for gastrointestinal malignancies , the first 11 patients received capecitabine 1000 mg twice daily without interruption ; an abbreviated schedule of five days per week was used in eight patients who developed hand - foot syndrome and in the remaining patients [ 12 ] .
in this study , two patients with mcrc were receiving xelox , and two patients with gastric cancer were receiving oxaliplatin with capecitabine .
grade 1 or 2 fatigue ( n = 16 ; 57 %) , hand - foot syndrome ( n = 20 ; 71 % ; one grade 3 ) , and diarrhea ( n = 6 ; 21 %) were the most commonly observed events ; there were no grade 4 events [ 12 ] .
toxicities were not different according to age or gender .
dose reductions , most commonly for hand - foot syndrome , fatigue , and abdominal pain , were required in 11 patients ( 32 %) .
in the current case , the most likely cause of cortical blindness was the use of oxaliplatin .
neurotoxicity is the best - known event associated with the use of oxaliplatin - based chemotherapy , although occurrence of cortical blindness is rare .
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome has been reported in clinical trials ( incidence < 0.1 %) and in postmarketing experience with oxaliplatin and may be associated with visual disturbances ranging from blurriness to blindness [ 13 ] .
the occurrence of cortical blindness has also been reported as a rare neurotoxic ae associated with the use of contrast - enhanced ct [ 14 ] .

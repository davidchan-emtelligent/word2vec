loktanella hongkongensis ust950701 - 009pt is a gram - negative , non - motile and rod - shaped bacterium isolated from a marine biofilm in the subtropical seawater of hong kong .
when growing as a monospecies biofilm on polystyrene surfaces , this bacterium is able to induce larval settlement and metamorphosis of a ubiquitous polychaete tubeworm hydroides elegans .
the inductive cues are low - molecular weight compounds bound to the exopolymeric matrix of the bacterial cells .
in the present study we describe the features of l. hongkongensis strain dsm 17492t together with its genome sequence and annotation and novel aspects of its phenotype .
the 3,198,444 bp long genome sequence encodes 3104 protein - coding genes and 57 rna genes .
the two unambiguously identified extrachromosomal replicons contain replication modules of the repb and the rhodobacteraceae - specific dnaa - like type , respectively .
keywords biofilms marine roseobacter group rhodobacteraceae alphaproteobacteria plasmids issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction loktanella hongkongensis ust950701 - 00pt (= dsm 17492t = nrrl b - 41039t = jcm 12479t ) was isolated from a biofilm grown naturally on a glass coupon that had been submerged in the coastal seawater of hong kong for 7 days in july 1995 [ 1 ] .
in the marine environment , bacteria in biofilms mediate the settlement and metamorphosis of the planktonic larvae of many benthic invertebrates .
the cells of ust950701 - 00pt , when attached as a biofilm , were able to induce settlement and metamorphosis of the polychaete hydroides elegans [ 2 ] .
the chemical cues mediating the larval response were found to be low - molecular weight compounds associated with the exopolymeric matrix of the bacterial cells [ 3 - 5 ] .
in this study we analyzed the genome sequence of l. hongkongensis dsm 17492t .
we present a description of the genome sequencing , an annotation and a summary classification together with a set of features for strain , including novel aspects of its phenotype .
organism information classification and features figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of l. hongkongensis dsm 17492t in a 16s rrna gene based tree .
the sequence of the single 16s rrna gene copy in the genome does not differ from the previously published 16s rrna gene sequence ( ay600300 ). fig. 1 phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of l. hongkongensis relative to the type strains of the other species within the genus loktanella [ 6 , 13 ] .
the tree was inferred from 1353 aligned characters of the 16s rrna gene sequence under the maximum likelihood ( ml ) criterion as previously described [ 14 ] .
rooting was done initially using the midpoint method and then checked for its agreement with the current classification ( table 1 ) .
the branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site .
numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 350 ml bootstrap replicates ( left ) and from 1000 maximum - parsimony bootstrap replicates ( right ) if larger than 60 % [ 6 ] .
lineages with type strain genome sequencing projects registered in gold [ 7 ] are labeled with one asterisk , those also listed as ' complete and published ' with two asterisks the single genomic 16s rrna gene sequence of l. hong - kongensis dsm 17492t was compared with the greengenes database for determining the weighted relative frequencies of taxa and ( truncated ) keywords as previously described [ 6 ] .
the most frequently occurring genera were loktanella ( 46.2 %) , ketogulonicigenium ( 14.9 %) , methylarcula ( 10.3 %) , silicibacter ( 10.0 %) and ruegeria ( 8.5 %) ( 65 hits in total ) .
regarding the five hits to sequences from representatives of the species , the average identity within high - scoring segment pairs was 99.6 % , whereas the average coverage by hsps was 98.0 % .
regarding the 13 hits to sequences from other representatives of the genus , the average identity within hsps was 95.6 % , whereas the average coverage by hsps was 97.6 % .
among all other species , the one yielding the highest score was loktanella vestfoldensis ( nr _ 029021 ) , which corresponded to an identity of 95.8 % and a hsp coverage of 99.4 % .
( note that the greengenes database uses the insdc (= embl / ncbi / ddbj ) annotation , which is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification ) .
the highest - scoring environmental sequence was fj869048 ( greengenes short name ' roseobacter isolates chesapeake bay water 2 m depth isolate cb1079rhodobacterales str .
cb1079 ') , which showed an identity of 99.2 % and an hsp coverage of 99.9 % .
the most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of all environmental samples which yielded hits were ' lake ' ( 8.6 %) , ' tin ' ( 7.1 %) , ' qinghai ' ( 6.4 %) , ' microbi ' ( 3.2 %) and ' sea ' ( 3.1 %) ( 185 hits in total ) .
the most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of those environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the highest scoring species were ' sea ' ( 15.4 %) , ' water ' ( 7.7 %) , ' bloom , chl , concentr , contrast , diatom , dure , filter , non - bloom , spring , station , success , surfac , yel ' ( 5.1 %) and ' bai , chesapeak , depth , roseobact ' ( 2.6 %) ( 3 hits in total ) .
these keywords fit well to the isolation site of strain ust950107 - 009pt. fig. 2 phase - contrast micrograph of strain l. hongkongensis dsm 17492t l. hongkongensis ust950107 - 009pt is gram - negative and non - spore forming ( table 1 ) .
cells are short rods and non - motile ( fig. 2 ) .
when grown on marine agar 2216 ( difco ) at 30 ( o ) c in the absence of light , colonies are pink in color , convex with entire margin , and have smooth and shiny surface ; brown diffusible pigment is produced .
however , whitish colonies would emerge from every culture upon aging ( 3 days or beyond ) .
the colonies of the white morphovar , with otherwise identical morphological properties , can be maintained as separate cultures ( ust950701 - 009 w ) without turning pink. l. hongkongensis ust950107 - 009pt cannot grow on nutrient agar or trypticase - soy agar ( both from oxoid ) .
the growth of l. hongkongensis ust950701 - 009pt is strictly aerobic and requires at least 2 % nacl ( up to 14 %) .
the ranges of temperature and ph where its growth can occur are 8 - 44 ( o ) c and 5.0 - 10.0 , respectively. l. hongkongensis ust950107 - 009pt can utilize a wide range of mono - , di - , tri - and polysaccharides , and sugar alcohols .
citrate is not utilized .
catalase , oxidase and beta - galactosidase activities are positive whereas arginine dihydrolase , lysine decarboxylase , ornithine decarboxylase , urease , tryptophane deaminase and gelatinase are negative. l. hongkongensis ust950701 - 009pt does not produce bacteriochlorophyll a , indole , acetoin or h2s .
it cannot hydrolysis casein or tween 80 .
streptomycin , penicillin , chloramphenicol , amplicilin and tetracycline can inhibit the growth of l. hongkongensis ust950107 - 009pt but kanamycin cannot ( all data from [ 1 ]) .
the utilization of carbon compounds by l. hongkongensis dsm 17492t grown at 28 degreesc was also determined for this study using generation - iii microplates in an omnilog phenotyping device ( biolog inc. , hayward , ca , usa ) .
the microplates were inoculated at 28 degreesc with dye if - a and a cell suspension at a cell density of 95 - 96 % turbidity .
further additives were vitamin , micronutrient and sea - salt solutions [ 14 ] .
the plates were sealed with parafilm to avoid a loss of fluid .
the exported measurement data were further analyzed with the opm package for r [ 15 , 16 ] , using its functionality for statistically estimating parameters from the respiration curves such as the maximum height , and automatically translating these values into negative , ambiguous , and positive reactions .
the reactions were recorded in three individual biological replicates .
positive results were received for the following substrates : positive control , ph 6 , 1 % nacl , 4 % nacl , 8 % nacl , d - galactose , 3 - o - methyl - d - glucose , d - fucose , l - fucose , l - rhamnose , inosine , 1 % sodium lactate , myo - inositol , rifamycin sv , l - aspartic acid , l - glutamic acid , l - histidine , l - serine , d - glucuronic acid , glucuronamide , quinic acid , l - lactic acid , citric acid , alpha - keto - glutaric acid , d - malic acid , l - malic acid , nalidixic acid , acetic acid and sodium formate .
according to generation - iii plates the strain is negative for dextrin , d - maltose , d - trehalose , d - cellobiose , beta - gentiobiose , sucrose , d - turanose , stachyose , ph 5 , d - raffinose , alpha - d - lactose , d - melibiose , beta - methyl - d - galactoside , d - salicin , n - acetyl - d - glucosamine , n - acetyl - beta - d - mannosamine , n - acetyl - d - galactosamine , n - acetyl - neuraminic acid , d - glucose , d - mannose , d - fructose , fusidic acid , d - serine , d - sorbitol , d - mannitol , d - arabitol , glycerol , d - glucose - 6 - phosphate , d - fructose - 6 - phosphate , d - aspartic acid , d - serine , troleandomycin , minocycline , gelatin , glycyl - l - proline , l - alanine , l - arginine , l - pyroglutamic acid , lincomycin , guanidine hydrochloride , niaproof , pectin , d - galacturonic acid , l - galactonic acid - gamma - lactone , d - gluconic acid , mucic acid , d - saccharic acid , vancomycin , tetrazolium violet , tetrazolium blue , p - hydroxyphenylacetic acid , methyl pyruvate , d - lactic acid methyl ester , bromo - succinic acid , lithium chloride , potassium tellurite , tween 40 , gamma - amino - n - butyric acid , alpha - hydroxy - butyric acid , beta - hydroxybutyric acid , alpha - keto - butyric acid , acetoacetic acid , propionic acid , aztreonam , butyric acid and sodium bromate and the negative control .
the phenotype of the strain was described as well as the assimilation of a wide range of sugars was tested by lau et al .
[ 1 ] with the api50ch system , which is based on the detection of biochemical reactions .
using the api50ch system positive reactions were found for more than 20 carbon sources .
none of these results could be confirmed by the omnilog measurement. l. hongkongensis was positive for only five sugars , as well as for a number of carboxylic acids ( e.g. malate and citrate ) and amino acids .
this observation agrees with the finding of van trappen et al .
[ 6 ] , who determined the phenotype of three loktanella strains using api20ne , except for the difference that no positive reaction was found for the carbon sources given in [ 6 ] .
positive reactions found in the omnilog measurements but not in growth experiments might be due to the higher sensitivity of the former [ 17 ] .
chemotaxonomy the predominant fatty acids of l. hongkongensis ust950107 - 009pt are c18:1 omega7c ( 84.5 %) , c16:0 ( 5.8 %) , c18:0 ( 3.5 %) , c10:0 3 - oh ( 2.0 %) and c12:0 3 - oh ( 1.9 %) , making up to 97.7 % of the total [ 1 ] .
the remaining fatty acids are c12:1 3 - oh , c17 : o , c18:1 omega7c 11 - methyl , summed feature 3 ( comprising c16:1 omega7c and c15 iso 2 - oh ) , and an unknown peak with an expected chain length equivalent to 11.799 .
genome sequencing and annotation genome project history the genome was sequenced within the project " ecology , physiology and molecular biology of the roseobacter clade : towards a systems biology understanding of a globally important clade of marine bacteria " .
the strain was chosen for genome sequencing according to the genomic encyclopedia of bacteria andarchaea criteria [ 29 ] .
for the same reason it was previously also chosen as part of the " genomic encyclopedia of type strains , phase i : the one thousand microbial genomes project " [ 51 , 52 ] , a follow - up of the geba project [ 30 ] , which aims at increasing the sequencing coverage of key reference microbial genomes .
two draft sequences were produced independently from the same source of dna and finally joined .
according project information can found in the genomes online database [ 31 ] .
the whole genome shotgun sequence is deposited in genbank and the integrated microbial genomes database ( img ) [ 32 ] .
a summary of the project information is shown in table 2 .

genomic dna was isolated using jetflex genomic dna purification kit ( genomed 600100 ) following the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer but modified by an incubation time of 60 min , incubation on ice over night on a shaker , the use of additional 50 mul proteinase k , and the addition of 100 mul protein precipitation buffer .
dna is available from the dsmz through the dna network [ 34 ] .
genome sequencing and assembly the genome was sequenced using a combination of two libraries ( table 2 ) .
illumina sequencing was performed on a ga iix platform with 150 cycles .
the paired - end library contained inserts of an average of 500 bp in length .
the first run on illumina gaii platform delivered 1.0 million reads .
a second illumina run was performed on a miseq platform to gain a higher sequencing depth .
to achieve longer reads , the library was sequenced in one direction for 300 cycles , providing another 2.1 million reads .
after error correction and clipping by fastq - mcf [ 35 ] and quake [ 36 ] , the data was assembled using velvet [ 37 ] .
a total of 2,403,257 reads with a mean length of 126 bp passed the filter step and were assembled in 54 contigs .
to gain information on the contig arrangement an additional 454 run was performed .
the paired - end jumping library of 3 kb insert size was sequenced on a 1 / 8 lane .
pyrosequencing resulted in 158,608 reads with an average length of 337 bp. a total of 41 scaffolds was obtained from newbler assembler ( roche diagnostics ) .
both draft assemblies ( illumina and 454 sequences ) were fractionated into artificial sanger reads of 1000 nt in length plus 75 bp overlap on each site .
these artificial reads served as an input for the phred / phrap / consed package [ 38 ]. by manual editing the number of contigs was reduced to 13 .
using minimus2 [ 39 ] , the resulting sequence was mapped to an existing permanent draft version of the genome published on img - er by the doe joint genome institute , which was sequenced as described earlier [ 53 ] .
the source dna of both samples was obtained from the same origin dsm 17492t .
the combined sequences provided a 132 x coverage of the genome .
genome annotation genes were identified using prodigal [ 40 ] as part of the jgi genome annotation pipeline .
the predicted cdss were translated and used to search the national center for biotechnology information nonredundant database , uniprot , tigr - fam , pfam , priam , kegg , cog , and interpro databases .
identification of rna genes were carried out by using hmmer 3.0rc1 [ 41 ] ( rrnas ) and trnascan - se 1.23 [ 42 ] ( trnas ) .
other non - coding genes were predicted using infernal 1.0.2 [ 43 ] additional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the integrated microbial genomes - expert review platform [ 44 ] crispr elements were detected using crt [ 45 ] and piler - cr [ 46 ] .
genome properties the genome statistics are provided in table 3 and fig. 3. the genome of strain dsm 17492t has a total length of 3,198,444 bp and a g + c content of 68.3 %. of the 3161 genes predicted , 3104 were identified protein - coding genes , and 57 rnas .
the majority of the protein - coding genes were assigned a putative function ( 83.9 %) while the remaining ones were annotated as hypothetical proteins .

these plasmids contain characteristic replication modules of the repb and dnaa - like type comprising a replicase as well as the parab partitioning operon .
the respective replicases that mediate the initiation of replication are designated according to the established plasmid classification scheme [ 47 ] .
the different numbering of the replicases ( repb - i , dnaa - like i ) corresponds to specific plasmid compatibility groups that are required for a stable coexistence of the replicons within the same cell .
type - iv secretion systems for conjugative plasmid transfer [ 48 , 49 ] and postsegregational killing systems , consisting of a typical operon with two small genes encoding a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin [ 50 ] , are missing on both plasmids .
the presence of a repa - i plasmid replicase ( lokhon _ 02202 ) in close proximity to a complete rrna operon on the chromosomal 1,0 mb contig 684.8 is conspicuous .
the parab partitioning operon is located 15 genes downstream of repa - i indicating that the replication module has been subjected to several recombination events with the chromosome and is probably not functional any more .
however , genome finishing would be required to document the presence of a single chromosomal replicon in l. hongkongensis dsm 17492t .

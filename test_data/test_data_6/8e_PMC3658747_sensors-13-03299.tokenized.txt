we have developed a real - time terahertz time - domain polarization analyzer by using 80 - mhz repetition - rate femtosecond laser pulses .
our technique is based on the spinning electro - optic sensor method , which we recently proposed and demonstrated by using a regenerative amplifier laser system ; here we improve the detection scheme in order to be able to use it with a femtosecond laser oscillator with laser pulses of a much higher repetition rate .
this improvement brings great advantages for realizing broadband , compact and stable real - time terahertz time - domain polarization measurement systems for scientific and industrial applications .
terahertz spectroscopy polarization analysis electro - optic sensor 1 .
introduction optical polarization sensing and spectroscopy are fundamental experimental tools in materials science .
the development of highly sensitive and ultrafast polarization measurement technologies in the visible wavelength range have enabled the study of various basic properties of materials , a few of which are dielectric constants , measured by performing ellipsometry [ 1 ] ; ultrafast magnetization dynamics , characterized by faraday / kerr rotation spectroscopy using ultrafast laser pulses [ 2 - 5 ] and the conformation dynamics of proteins , obtained with a circular dichroism measurement [ 6 ] .
polarization spectroscopy and ellipsometry in the terahertz frequency range with a much lower photon energy of several mev have become a challenging research area in last two decades [ 7 - 10 ] .
these techniques have become important tools for investigating low - energy dynamical phenomena in various kinds of materials such as molecules [ 11,12 ] , superconductors [ 13 - 17 ] , multiferroics [ 18 ] , two - dimensional electron gases [ 19 ] , graphene [ 20 ] , magnetic materials [ 21 - 25 ] and topological insulators [ 26,27 ] .
they are also important in many fields of applied science for investigating carrier density and mobility in semiconductors [ 8,28 - 30 ] ; local stress and optical axis , probed by terahertz birefringence measurements [ 31 - 34 ] and physiological conditions , probed by reflection polarimetry of human skin [ 35,36 ] .
in addition , terahertz time - domain polarimetry , which allows us to extract the instantaneous direction of the electric - field ( e - field ) vectors within a single - cycle of the electromagnetic oscillation , opens new avenues for investigating the surface topography of materials [ 37 ] and for separate determination of the optical faraday and kerr rotation angles using echo signals [ 26 ] , a result that cannot be attained with the conventional polarization measurement technique for much higher frequencies .
development of the polarization sensing technology for the terahertz frequency range has long been pursued by the strategy of inventing new types of terahertz polarizers with wider frequency coverage and a better extinction ratio , where both requirements are quite important for basic characterization of materials , though it is quite difficult to satisfy both conditions .
recent remarkable progress in this area includes achieving an extinction ratio of 84.9 db [ 38 ] , developing a flexible polarizer using nanoimprint technology [ 39 ] , creation of a circular polarizer [ 40 ] .
there have been continuous efforts to understand the basic electromagnetic properties in metamaterial structures [ 41 - 50 ] and to realize their potential practical applications [ 51,52 ] , which is necessary to design such new terahertz polarization devices .
terahertz polarizers using an array of carbon nanotubes have also been proposed and demonstrated [ 53,54 ] .
several methods to characterize the state of polarization of the terahertz waves by performing terahertz time - domain spectroscopy using the polarizers are proposed and demonstrated [ 55 - 57 ] .
another approach to polarization - sensing technologies in the terahertz frequency range that avoids using the terahertz polarizers is to utilize a semiconductor photoconductive antenna device with two or three gaps that have different polarization sensitivities [ 7,58 - 61 ] .
helicity - sensitive terahertz sensors using field - effect transistors have also been reported [ 62 ] .
in a terahertz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) measurement using the electro - optic ( eo ) sampling method , one can use the eo crystal as a " natural " polarizer having a terahertz e - field sensitivity that depends on the relative direction between the crystal axes and the polarization direction of the terahertz waves [ 63 - 68 ] .
these experimental schemes have the advantage of realizing broadband polarization measurements that are not limited by the bandwidth of the terahertz polarizers .
in order to improve the precision and the speed of determining the polarization direction , modulation techniques are used .
the commonly used technique is to rapidly rotate the wire - grid polarizer or a waveplate in the terahertz frequency region to modulate the signal , and then determine the polarization direction by extracting the modulated components of the signal [ 69 - 71 ] .
we recently proposed and demonstrated a new experimental scheme for the terahertz polarization measurement involving rapidly rotating the eo crystal [ 72 ] to modulate the eo signal ; this is much easier to achieve than it would be with the wire - grid counterpart since the eo crystal is much smaller than the wire - grid polarizers and it is quite easy to achieve a stable rotation with a frequency up to 100 hz ( 6,000 rotations per minute ) .
we showed that a mechanical rotation of the < 110 > - oriented zinc - blend crystal with an angular frequency omega adds two frequency components , omega and 3 omega , to the eo signal , and the analysis of their phases makes it possible to quickly and precisely determine the polarization direction of the electric - field vector of the terahertz waves [ 72 ] .
our method is based on the conventional thz - tds measurement systems [ 73 ] so that we can easily perform the time - dependent waveform analysis of the terahertz e - field vectors that includes the polarization information .
quite importantly , our modulation technique does not require wire - grid polarizers which sometimes restrict the measureable frequency range of the polarization - sensitive terahertz spectroscopy .
instead , we use the < 110 > - oriented zinc - blende crystal as a natural polarizer , and thus we may easily extend our polarization - resolved terahertz waveform analysis of up to about 60 thz if we use ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses with a pulse width of less than 10 fs as a light source and choose proper zinc - blende crystals [ 74,75 ] .
in [ 72 ] , we demonstrated this method by using a regenerative amplifier laser system with a pulse width of about 150 fs as a light source for both the terahertz pulse generation and detection .
it is quite desirable to achieve the same measurement scheme by using a laser oscillator system with a higher repetition rate , because one can commercially obtain oscillator systems with an extremely short (< 10 fs ) pulse width , which opens a new horizon on the ultra - broadband polarization - resolved terahertz spectroscopy .
a stableness and compactness are the additional advantages to use the oscillator systems which are very useful in practical usage .
in principle , our method can also be applied to the thz - tds systems with the oscillator system with a higher repetition rate , however , the terahertz e - field magnitude and thus the eo signal are very weak in this case , and a careful design of the measurement system should be required .
in this paper , we demonstrate a terahertz polarization measurement system with the spinning eo sensor method by using 80 - mhz repetition - rate ti : sapphire femtosecond laser pulses with a pulse width of about 100 fs , and we describe the detailed methodology for achieving the real - time and precise polarization measurement .
we believe that one can further apply the present technique to the broadband terahertz spectroscopy by using a femtosecond laser pulse with much shorter pulse width in future and thus this paper brings great advantages for realizing broadband , compact and stable real - time terahertz time - domain polarization measurement systems , which should accelerate the scientific and industrial applications .
2. methodology in this section , we describe a detailed methodology for achieving a terahertz polarization measurement by the spinning eo sensor method by using 80 - mhz repetition - rate femtosecond laser pulses .
in particular , we describe the electronic part of the system in detail , which is crucial for achieving a stable measurement with a high signal - to - noise ratio .
a schematic of the system is shown in figure 1 .
we use a femtosecond near - infrared ( ir ) laser oscillator with a wavelength of 800 nm , a repetition rate of 80 mhz , a pulse width of about 100 fs , and a power of 1 w for both the terahertz pulse generation and detection .
the setup is almost the same as the conventional thz - tds systems with an eo sampling method [ 73 ] except for the spinning eo crystal attached to a stabilized hollow shaft motor that rotates with a frequency of 48 hz. the pulse energy of the near - ir laser pulse for thz pulse generation is typically 9 nj just before the znte crystal , while that of the probe laser pulse just before the spinning znte crystal is 0.07 nj. a mechanical chopper is required in the near - ir beam path of the terahertz pulse generation scheme in order to perform a signal subtraction algorithm as we describe below .
the blades of the chopper have a 1:1 mark : space ( duty cycle ) ratio .
we place the chopper between two optical lenses in order to make the spot size of the laser beam as small as possible when it passes through the chopper , which is important to improve the on / off modulation depth of the intensity of the terahertz pulse with a square pulse sequence .
the on / off modulation frequency is typically 3 khz , and we use this frequency as a master clock to govern the timing of all parts of the measurement system ( see also figures 2 and 3 ) .
the eo detection of the terahertz e - field magnitude is performed by measuring the ellipticity of the optical probe pulse induced by the pockels effect in the crystal .
when the terahertz e - field magnitude is not so large , the intensity difference signal deltai between the x - and y - polarized components of the probe pulse after passing through the < 110 > - oriented zinc - blend crystal and a quarter - wave plate is proportional to the terahertz e - field magnitude .
in our measurement setup , to measure deltai , we use a homemade detector including a current - to - voltage converter with a low - pass filter in its analog electronic circuit with a cut - off frequency of about 100 khz , so that the high - frequency ( 80 mhz ) component of the eo signal is attenuated .
in [ 72 ] , we found that if we rotate the < 110 > - oriented eo crystal with an angular frequency of omega , the time - dependent intensity difference signal deltai ( t ) becomes : ( 1 ) deltai ( t )~ ea { 12cos ( omegat + beta0 + gamma )+ 32cos ( 3omegat + 3beta0 - gamma )} where the x - direction is defined as the polarization direction of the optical probe pulse , ea is the magnitude of the terahertz electric field pulses , beta0 is the initial angle ( at t = 0 ) between the x - axis and the [ 110 ] direction of the rotating eo crystal and gamma is the angle between the x - axis and the polarization direction of the terahertz waves that we want to measure .
the magnitude and phase information of equation ( 1 ) can be used to determine the e - field magnitude ea and its polarization direction gamma at the same time .
when we apply this spinning eo sensor method to the laser system with a femtosecond laser oscillator with an 80 - mhz repetition rate , the most severe problem is that there is a large crystal - position - dependent background signal without the eo effect [ 76 ] which is so large that it may hide the eo signal with a much smaller e - field magnitude compared to the one with the regenerative amplifier .
a careful design of the electronic sampling timing of the eo signals as well as the background subtraction algorithm described in [ 72 ] and [ 76 ] are both required to obtain a stable measurement .
figure 2 shows a block diagram of the instrument electronics .
a master clock frequency ( f = 3 khz ) from the mechanical chopper is multiplied by using two phase - locked loop ( pll ) electronic circuits to generate 2f and 32f clock pulses .
the 32f clock pulses are used to determine the timings of the analog - to - digital ( a / d ) conversion of the deltai ( t ) signal , which is stored in a personal computer ( pc ) .
the 2f clock pulses are used to control the hollow - shaft brushless dc motor with an encoder with 125 pulses per revolution .
the rotation frequency of the motor becomes ( 2 / 125 ) f ( 48 hz ) which can be monitored through an electronic pulse sequence from the apparatus .
the ( 2 / 125 ) f clock pulse sequence is put into a frequency divider to generate a ( 1 / 125 ) f ( 24 hz ) pulse sequence , which is used as a start trigger for the measurement .
a timing chart of the measurement system is shown in figure 3 .
the four clock pulses are phase - matched with each other with a timing jitter of about 2 mu s , while their rising - edge timings are different .
after the pc detects the start trigger pulse , another control pulse synchronized with the timing of the optical chopper initiates the sequential data acquisition of the measurement .
to obtain the control pulse , we use another (~ 100 khz bandwidth ; much faster detector is preferable ) photo - detector and probe the time - dependent intensity profile of a part of the laser pulse after the mechanical chopper .
another technique to determine the timing of the control pulse is to maximize the modulated components of the deltai ( t ) signal by changing the timing to initiate the numerical sequential data acquisition using a pc program , which is much easier since we do not need the additional photo - detector .
as the frequency of the pulse used to determine the timings of the a / d conversions is exactly 32 times higher than the optical chopper frequency , the first 16 sequential data points represent the eo signal in the presence of a terahertz pulse , while the next 16 sequential data points represent those in the absence of the terahertz pulse .
we numerically average these two sets of 16 sequential data points using a pc program , and call the average values the first datum ( 1 ) and the second datum ( 2 ) , as shown in figure 3 .
the angle between the x - axis and the [ 110 ] direction of the rotating eo crystal is beta0 when we are measuring the first datum , while it is ( beta0 + 2pi125 ) when we are measuring the second datum .
after the recording of the 125th datum , where the crystal angle is ( beta0 + 124125x2pi ) , we continuously measure the 126th datum which is a complementary datum to the first datum , having the same angle of beta0 but without the terahertz pulse due to the fractional relationship between the frequency of the dc motor and that of the optical chopper , since their ratio is 2 / 125 ( see figure 3 ) .
we finally obtain 250 of these averaged data values including 125 data sets with different crystal angles , and each set consists of two data values at the same crystal angle , one with and one without the terahertz pulse .
for each set , we subtract one data value from the other and obtain 125 angle - dependent eo signals .
the mathematical framework of the background subtraction algorithm is described in reference [ 76 ] .
3. experimental results and discussion figure 4 ( a ) shows the sequential 250 data values of the intensity difference signal deltai ( t ) during the two rotations of the eo crystal .
the voltage data ranges over +/ - 3 v owning to the background signals that originate from the effects of the scattering of the probe laser pulse and the residual birefringence inside the eo crystal [ 77 ] , which depends on the crystal rotation angles .
since we obtain 125 data values per rotation , we observe almost similar waveforms between data values 1 through 125 and data values 126 through 250 .
next , we show that we can cancel this large background noise by using the background subtraction algorithm we described in the last part of the previous section .
figure 4 ( b,c ) shows the 125 data values after we have performed the background subtraction algorithm .
figure 4 ( b ) shows the experimental results for a single measurement that finishes within the two rotations of the eo crystal ( 1 /( 24 hz ) = 42 ms ) .
in figure 4 ( c ) , we perform n = 1,000 measurements and average the data .
the voltage of the subtracted signals ranges over +/ - 0.01 v , which is about 0.3 % of the measured data with the background signals .
despite the huge difference between the magnitudes of the eo signals and the background signals , the background subtraction algorithm works effectively , and we can obtain the modulated eo data , which can be fitted by equation ( 1 ) , as shown in figure 4 ( d ) .
we perform the fourier transform of the experimental data after the background subtraction as shown in figure 4 ( b,c ) , and analyze the amplitude of each frequency component of the signals ( enomega ) .
figure 5 shows the histogram of ( enomega ) for different averaging numbers n. obviously , the amplitudes of the omega and 3 omega frequency components have the largest values with the relation e3omega =~ 3eomega , while there are finite amplitudes in other frequency components , which we consider to be the residual background noise .
there are two kinds of residual background noise components in the data .
one of the two is random in every cycle of the measurements , and thus we can eliminate the noise by averaging the experimental data by increasing the number of experiments n. we believe that this noise originates from a power fluctuation of the laser pulse and / or some imperfection in the stable rotation of the motor within a single cycle of the measurement .
these errors are different from experiment to experiment , and therefore , they can be cancelled by averaging the data obtained by repeatedly performing the experiment .
the other kind of noise component is one that cannot be eliminated even though we average the data as we observe in the lower frequency components in figure 5 ( b - d ) .
we consider that the second noise component originates from the nonlinearity of the current - to - voltage converter in our homemade balance detector , which causes a distortion of the signal deltai ( t ) , and the error cannot be eliminated by averaging the data .
please note that these residual noises are , however , spectrally spread out ; thus , they have less influence on the analysis of the omega and 3 omega frequency components .
therefore , a single measurement is enough to analyze the magnitude and the polarization direction of the terahertz waves despite relatively large background noise of the signals in figure 4 ( b ) compared to figure 4 ( c ) .
we can obtain the value gamma representing the polarization direction of the terahertz e - field vectors from the analysis of the phases of the omega and 3 omega frequency components using equation ( 1 ) .
figure 6 represents the statistical distribution of the measured polarization directions of the terahertz waves gamma from their mean value gamma when we repeat the measurements n = 10,000 times .
each polarization direction gamma is determined by the single polarization measurement that finishes within the two rotations of the eo crystal ( 42 ms ) .
the standard deviation of the distributions of gamma is sigma = 0.95degrees ; therefore , we can determine the polarization direction of the terahertz e - field vector within about +/ - 0.95degrees in 42 ms. please note that repeating the measurements increases the precision of the estimation of the mean value gamma .
the standard error of the mean becomes sigma / n = 0.0095degrees = 0.17 mrad in figure 6 , which is sufficient for detecting , for example , a small kerr rotation angle to estimate the off - axis conductivity of materials [ 19 ] .
obviously , the precision to determine gamma depends on measurement times , and thus a long term stability of the polarization experiments is important to achieve the reliable measurements .
we proved in reference [ 72 ] that the long term intensity fluctuations of the laser pulse does not cause serious errors to determine gamma , because the information on gamma is retrieved from the phase information of the signal 's time evolution within two cycles of the crystal rotations (~ 42 ms in the present work ) so that the amplitude fluctuation in time scales longer than this period does not suffer the precision to determine gamma .
therefore , we can perform experiments as many times as possible to get a reliable mean value of gamma .
this advantage is important when we measure optically dense samples where the magnitude of the transmitted terahertz wave becomes very small and highly sensitive polarization measurements are required .
4. conclusions and outlook in this paper , we established a real - time and precise terahertz polarization analyzer with the spinning eo sensor method by using 80 - mhz repetition - rate femtosecond laser pulses .
it was necessary to pay special attention needed to be paid to the electronic part of the measurement system to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .
finally , we obtained the polarization angle of the terahertz e - field vectors with respect to the polarization direction of the probe laser pulse within a measurement time of 42 ms with a standard deviation of sigma = 0.95degrees , which is comparable to those made by using a regenerative amplifier laser system .
as the long term intensity fluctuations of the laser pulse does not cause serious errors to determine the polarization direction gamma , we can repeat the experiments to obtain a reliable mean value ( gamma ) of gamma .
this success promises to realize a broadband and compact real - time terahertz time - domain polarization measurement system that would be useful for scientific and industrial applications .

the times to begin the single - cycle measurements are indicated by the two dotted lines .
in practice , one of the two dotted lines cannot be used to start the measurement , because one needs additional time for the numerical computations .
four clock pulses are matched in phase with each other with a timing jitter of about 2 mus , while their rising - edge timings are different .
the frequency of each electronic pulse is also indicated .

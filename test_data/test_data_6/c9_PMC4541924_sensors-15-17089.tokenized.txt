finger vein recognition has been considered one of the most promising biometrics for personal authentication .
however , the capacities and percentages of finger tissues ( e.g. , bone , muscle , ligament , water , fat , etc. ) vary person by person .
this usually causes poor quality of finger vein images , therefore degrading the performance of finger vein recognition systems ( fvrss ) .
in this paper , the intrinsic factors of finger tissue causing poor quality of finger vein images are analyzed , and an intensity variation ( iv ) normalization method using guided filter based single scale retinex ( gfssr ) is proposed for finger vein image enhancement .
the experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the image quality and finger vein recognition accuracy .
intensity variation finger vein recognition image enhancement guided filter single scale retinex 1 .
introduction as a newly emerging biometric , finger vein recognition has attracted significant attention and achieved remarkable development during the last decade .
compared with other traditional biometrics , the fvrs has the advantages of low cost , easy collection of images with contactless operation , liveness , and , respectively , smaller size of the imaging device [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ] .
finger veins are subcutaneous structures that randomly develop inside a finger .
they are viewable with reflected light due to the peak absorption of near infrared illumination by oxygenated and de - oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood [ 9 ] .
this makes finger vein media resistant to theft and forgery .
in practice , however , fvrss suffer from external factors such as imaging models [ 10 ] and uneven illumination [ 11,12 ] , and internal factors including scattering [ 13 ] and finger tissue [ 14 ] .
these factors cause the finger vein images to become unstable and have low contrast .
thus , it is difficult for fvrss to achieve reliable and accurate recognition performance in real scenarios .
to address this problem , finger vein image enhancement has widely been researched over the past few years to enhance the quality of finger vein images .
pi et al .
[ 14 ] combined an edge - preserving filter , an elliptic high - pass filter , and histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of finger vein images .
an illumination component was generated by the convolution of the original image with its filtered images using the average filter in [ 12 ] to alleviate the effect of uneven illumination for finger vein authentication .
considering the variations of vein - coursing directions , yang et al. proposed the utilization of different oriented filters to allow enhancement of the finger vein image [ 15,16 ] .
park et al .
[ 17 ] proposed enhancing the image quality using direction and thickness of the vein lines for finger vein recognition .
yang et al .
[ 13 ] proposed a biological optical model for estimation and removal of the light scattering component .
lee et al .
[ 18 ] introduced a finger vein image restoration method to deal with skin scattering and optical blurring .
these methods can , respectively , enhance finger vein images to some extent ; however , little attention has been given to the factor from finger tissue , which also results in poor quality of the finger vein image .
the tissue components of a finger , including fat , bone , skin , muscle , water , etc. , are the same for each individual .
however , the capacities and percentages of these tissue components vary among a person , which is easily proven by the variation in thickness of fingers .
for some finger vein images , the shape of blood vessels is projected poorly due to the effect of interruption caused by the components inside the finger .
thus , the contrast between the venous and non - venous regions of the images is poor .
it was mentioned by pi et al .
[ 14 ] that tissue structure in different parts of the finger could result in low quality finger vein images .
however , they did not propose a special method to cope with the finger tissue to allow better finger vein recognition .
yang et al .
[ 19 ] proposed a finger - image restoration method considering skin layer structure , where a gaussian - point spread function ( psf ) model and two depth - psf models were adopted .
however , there are no reports about enhancement accuracy through use of the methods .
in the present paper , the factor that results in poor finger vein images due to the finger tissues is named intensity variation .
even though imaging devices are relatively less sensitive to the external factor , this factor is still not avoidable , since each finger can make a different intensity variation according to its tissue structure .
therefore , an additional operation is required to eliminate the intensity variation in finger vein images .
to this end , we propose an intensity variation normalization method using guided filter based single scale retinex ( gfssr ) .
inspired by the assumptions in the single scale retinex ( ssr ) algorithm , a finger vein image is assumed to be regarded as the multiplication of its intensity variation and the reflectance images .
the original multiplication relation between the intensity variation and reflectance images can be translated to a subtraction operation with the use of a logarithm operation .
to obtain an accurate intensity variation image , the guided filter [ 20 ] is adopted in ssr to smooth an input image due to its adjustable edge - preserving smoothing ability .
the experimental results obtained for the public datasets mmcbnu _ 6000 [ 21 ] and utfvp [ 22 ] demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the intensity variation in finger vein images and enhance the image quality , thereby improving the matching performance .
the reminder of this paper is organized as follows : section 2 introduces the intensity variation in detail .
the proposed method using guided filter for intensity variation normalization is reported in section 3 .
section 4 reports the experimental results .
finally , the conclusion and suggestions for future work are given in section 5 .
2. intensity variation as shown in figure 1 , a finger usually contains fat , bone , skin , and nail components .
veins are located in the subcutaneous layer deep in the skin with fat , connective tissue and other tissues .
all the tissues and organs inside a finger can absorb near infrared ( nir ) illumination with different absorptivity .
as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in blood vessels absorb more nir radiation than the other substances , vein vessels are shown in darker color while the other tissues are presented with a brighter background in the captured vein image .
figure 1 human finger structure : ( a ) cross - section [ 23 ] and ( b ) skin diagram [ 24 ] .
as mentioned above , while each individual has the same types of finger tissues , the capacities and percentages of each tissue vary from person to person .
thick fingers contain more fat , while thin fingers contain less fat .
the captured images from a thin finger usually have higher image brightness than those from a thick finger .
the acquired finger vein images from different individuals show different global and local contrast , especially between the venous and non - venous regions .
figure 2 shows four groups of finger vein images coming from mmcbnu _ 6000 .
each row depicts six images taken from six fingers of a volunteer .
the figure clearly illustrates that the images from different individuals displayed different finger structures and thicknesses .
in addition , there were various image contrasts for each individual due to intensity variation .
the first individual ( p1 ) had the thickest fingers .
images ( figure 2a ) collected from p1 showed good image contrast between the venous and non - venous areas .
the individuals of p2 and p3 have thinner fingers than p1 ; therefore , the volume of each tissue was larger in p1 than those in p2 and p3 .
thus , figure 2b,c displayed higher brightness on the whole , as compared with the image brightness shown in figure 2a .
furthermore , the images captured from p2 and p3 displayed different global and local image contrast due to the effect of intensity variation .
since the bone in the finger joint is articular cartilage and can easily be penetrated by infrared light [ 15 ] , the joint part in the image is always shown in brighter gray values .
this resulted in brighter local areas in each of the captured images shown in figure 2 .
however , due to intensity variation , the local image contrast in the finger joint parts was much more obvious in figure 2b than those in other images .
images displayed in figure 2c showed lower global image contrast than those in the other images .
figure 2d shows good global image contrast ; the regions between the venous and non - venous areas were not clear .
this may have resulted from the presence of thick fat or muscle near the finger veins .
although the thickness of fingers from individual p2 and p4 are almost same , the image contrasts are different due to the intensity variation .
figure 2 image samples from our available database mmcbnu _ 6000 [ 21 ] : ( a - d ) are finger vein image samples collected from four volunteers p1 - p4 , respectively .
each row shows six images from six different fingers of one individual .
intensity variation in finger vein recognition is an internal factor that results in poor quality of the finger vein images and is inevitably generated in the process of imaging .
no matter what kind of imaging model or device is used , intensity variation appears in the finger vein images , degrades the image contrast and thereby degrading the matching performance of an fvrs .
thus , a specialized method that focuses on alleviating the effect of intensity variation would be beneficial for enhancing the quality of finger vein images and the matching performance of the fvrs .
3. proposed intensity variation normalization method in this section , the guided filter and single scale retinex algorithm are first reviewed , after which the proposed guided filter based single scale retinex method is described in detail for normalization of intensity variation in finger vein recognition .
3.1 .
guided filter guided filter [ 20 ] is an effective smoothing filter and its edge - preserving smoothing ability can be controlled by parameters .
taking into account this property and vague edges in some finger vein images due to intensity variation , guided filter is adopted in the present paper for smoothing the input images .
the key assumption of the guided filter is a local linear model between the guidance s , and the filter output g. the guidance image is guided for smoothing an input image .
it is supposed that g is a linear transform of s in a window wk , centered at pixel k [ 20 ] : ( 1 ) gi = aksi + bk for - alliinwk where ( ak,bk ) are some linear coefficients assumed to be constant in wk. this local linear model ensures that g has an edge only if s has an edge since nablag = anablas .
to determine the linear coefficients , the cost function that minimizes the difference between the input image l and the output is as follows .
( 2 ) e ( ak,bk )= sumiinwk (( aksi + bk - li ) 2 - epsilonak2 ) the solution of equation ( 2 ) is given by the linear regression method : ( 3 ) ak = 1 | w | sumiinwksili - mukl ksigmak2 + epsilon ( 4 ) bk = l k - akmuk where epsilon is a regularization parameter preventing ak from being too large , mu and sigmak2 are the mean and variance of s in wk , and l k is the mean of l in wk .
| w | is the number of pixels in wk. hence , after computing ( ak,bk ) for all patches wk in the image , the filter output can be computed by : ( 5 ) gi = 1 | w | sumk : iinwk ( aksi + bk )= a isi + b i where a i and b i are the mean values in ak and bk , respectively .
due to the linear model between the guidance and the filter output , the guided filter has a better edge - preserving smoothing property than other filters .
the non - approximate manner in implementation results in good quality of the generated results .
furthermore , the linear running time of the algorithm depends only on the number of pixels in the image .
3.2 .
single scale retinex algorithm single scale retinex ( ssr ) [ 25 ] is based on the assumption that an observed image l can be regarded as the multiplication of the illumination i and the reflectance images r. r can be considered as the textures without any illumination variations .
moreover , it is assumed that the reflectance changes sharply and that illumination changes smoothly .
there are a lot of methods for decomposition of the intensity into these two components and the ssr algorithm is used as a technique to enhance images in various applications [ 26 ] .
the mathematic description for each pixel ( x,y ) in an image is defined as follow : ( 6 ) l ( x,y )= i ( x,y ) xr ( x,y ) to eliminate the illumination from the captured image , a subtraction operator is applied in the logarithm domain .
( 7 ) logr ( x,y )= logl ( x,y ) - logi ( x,y ) since ssr is based on the idea that the illumination component tends to change smoothly , contrary to the reflectance , the illumination image i can be estimated by the convolution operation of the gaussian filter on the captured image l. the operation for each pixel ( x,y ) is as shown below : ( 8 ) i ( x,y )= l ( x,y ) xf ( x,y ) ( 9 ) f ( x,y )= 12pisigma2e - x2 + y22sigma2 substituting equation ( 8 ) into equation ( 7 ) , we have ( 10 ) logr ( x,y )= logl ( x,y ) - log ( l ( x,y ) xf ( x,y )) consequently , log r ( x,y ) is the retinex output , called single scale retinex ( ssr ) , while it is also the illumination - normalized output .
the block diagram for ssr is shown in figure 3 .
figure 3 block diagram of the ssr algorithm .
3.3 .
proposed gfssr each tissue in a finger can absorb nir illumination to different extents , causing undesired intensity variations in a finger vein image .
the intensity variation normalization proposed in this paper is designed to eliminate this effect .
inspired by the assumption of ssr , it was assumed that a captured finger vein image l could be regarded as the multiplication of the intensity variation iv and the reflectance r. the mathematic description for each pixel ( x,y ) can be represented as follow : ( 11 ) l ( x,y )= iv ( x,y ) xr ( x,y ) as mentioned in section 3.2 , it is common that an intensity variation image iv can be estimated by the convolution operation of the smoothing filter on the captured image l. here , we use a guided filter as a smoothing filter to obtain an intensity variation image of a finger vein image .
a result of guided filter at a point ( x,y ) , is obtained by a weighted sum of an intensity value at ( x,y ) in a given guidance image , s , and an average of a patch centered at ( x,y ) in a given input image , mu ( x,y ) .
a and b are used as its weights , which are determined by whether a patch centered at a point in the guidance image has relatively high variance , as defined in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .
if a patch has relatively high variance , a becomes relatively large and contributes to g ( x,y ) more than mu ( x,y ) .
otherwise , mu ( x,y ) contributes to g ( x,y ) more than s ( x,y ) .
as shown in figure 4 , r is a radius of a patch and becomes larger .
a region with relatively high variance also becomes larger and their variance values become smaller , so the contribution of s ( x,y ) to g ( x,y ) at a position ( x,y ) becomes smaller than in a case of using a smaller r. while its smoothing effect becomes stronger , its edge - preserving effect becomes weaker , but its tendency still remains .
therefore , the guided filter can work pursuing for a given purpose , when its parameter values and a guidance image are chosen properly .
figure 4 examples of parameters ( a,b ) of the guided filter according to different parameters ( epsilon,r ) .
finger vein images include mostly background but sparsely curves , which may be blurred by any external factor. through a guided filter , most background regions can be smoothed in their local means , since their variances are relatively small .
meanwhile , since vein curves are covered in region with relatively high variances , their curves also remain as a filtering result , but their intensity become lower due to larger r. therefore , as shown in figure 5 , when we look at a result of a finger vein image filtered by a guided filter , we can see that it includes most of background smoothed by local means and weak vein curves .
when this result is subtracted from its original image by gfssr process , it contributes on not only removing some intensity variation with smoothing effects but also on reducing blurring effects of curves , as shown in figure 6 .
figure 5 outputs of guided filter with different parameters ( epsilon,r ) .
the guidance image is identical to the input image .
figure 6 outputs of iv normalization using gfssr with the same parameters ( epsilon,r ) as those in figure 5 .
the proposed guided filter based ssr ( gfssr ) algorithm can be described as : ( 12 ) logr ( x,y )= logl ( x,y ) - log ( l ( x,y ) xg ( x,y )) where iv ( x,y ) is estimated by the convolution operation of the guided filter , g ( x,y ) , on the captured image l , iv ( x,y )= l ( x,y ) xg ( x,y ) .
the block diagram of gfssr is depicted in figure 7 .
figure 7 block diagram of the proposed gfssr algorithm .
in this paper , the proposed gfssr is performed directly on regions of interest ( roi ) in the images .
to accurately localize roi from the captured images , the robust finger vein roi localization method proposed in our previous research [ 27 ] is adopted .
the guidance image is selected as the input image .
compared with the input images , the enhanced images after intensity variation normalization using the proposed method have higher image contrast and quality , as shown in figure 6 .
the use of guided filter in the proposed method could not only smooth the captured image well but also cause loss of some vein information after the subtraction operation .
to address this problem , histogram truncation is adopted to compensate for the loss of the vein information in this process , for further enhancement of the image quality .
4. experimental results in order to ascertain the performance improvement using the proposed method , different methods for illumination normalization and image enhancement were implemented for comparison .
all the experiments were performed on two public available finger vein database , mmcbnu _ 6000 [ 21 ] and utfvp [ 22 ] , using matlab ( r2013a ) on a computer with an intel core i3 - 2120 and 4 gb of ram .
4.1 .
dataset mmcbnu _ 6000 consists of finger vein images captured from 100 volunteers , coming from 20 different countries .
each subject was asked in the capturing process to provide images of his or her index finger , middle finger , and ring finger of both hands during the capturing process .
the collection of each of the 6 fingers was repeated 10 times to obtain 10 finger vein images .
our finger vein database is therefore composed of a total of 6000 images .
each image was stored in " bmp " format at the size of 480 x 640 pixels .
the localized roi image had the pixels size of 64 x 128 .
some of the captured image samples and roi image samples are shown in figure 2 and figure 6 , respectively .
utfvp [ 22 ] contains 1440 finger vascular pattern images in total which have been collected from 60 volunteer at the university of twente .
images were captured in two identical sessions with an average time lapse of 15 days .
the vascular pattern of the index , ring and middle finger of both hands has been collected twice at each session .
two images were collected for each finger in each session .
the captured images have a resolution of 672 x 380 .
each image is stored using the lossless 8 - bit grey scale png format .
rois of images in utfvp , extracted using the algorithm proposed in [ 27 ] , had the resolution of 60 x 120 .
some of the finger vascular pattern images from utfvp and their rois are displayed in figure 8 .
figure 8 two groups of images , ( a ) and ( b ) , and their rois from utfvp [ 22 ] .
4.2 .
investigation of optimal parameters the performance of fvrs using the proposed gfssf is dependent on two parameters : the regularization parameter epsilon and the radius r of the window wk. in this section , an experiment was designed to explore the optimal parameters using images from mmcbnu _ 6000 .
since the aim of the proposed gfssf was to enhance the image quality and to improve the matching performance of the fvrs , the equal error rate ( eer ) was adopted to evaluate the matching accuracies with different parameters .
eer is the value whereat the false accept rate ( far ) is equal to the false reject rate ( frr ) .
discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) [ 27,28 ] was adopted for feature extraction of the enhanced finger vein images with different combinations of parameters .
the nearest neighbor classifier based on cosine distance was employed for matching .
in all experiments , each finger was considered as an individual .
five finger vein images from one individual were selected as the training set , while the remaining five images were used as the test set .
the number of genuine and imposter matches are 3000 ( 600 x 5 ) and 1,797,000 ( 600 x 599 x 5 ) , respectively .
figure 9 depicts the eer values with varying parameters .
the eer values obtained using dwt for feature extraction directly from the roi images is 3.93 % .
it is clearly illustrated in figure 9 that the proposed gfssr can enhance the matching performance regardless of the groups of parameters adopted .
furthermore , the performance achieved using the proposed gfssr with ( epsilon,r )=( 0.22,13 ) is better than those using other groups of parameters .
thus , the optimal values are ( epsilon,r )=( 0.22,13 ) , which are adopted in the rest of the experiments on two datasets .

4.3 .
comparison of image enhancement the experiments carried out in this section aimed to show the effectiveness of the proposed gfssr for finger vein image enhancement .
to this end , several approaches for finger vein image enhancement , including illumination normalization ( in ) [ 12 ] , scattering removal ( sr ) [ 13 ] , and other common methods widely used for image enhancement such as histogram equalization ( he ) , and single scale retinex ( ssr ) [ 25 ] were implemented for comparison .
sigma2 is selected as 0.04 in ssr .
some rois of the samples from mmcbnu _ 6000 and their enhancements using different methods are displayed in figure 10 .
it can be seen that he can enhance the brightness level .
however , as shown in figure 10e , he caused level saturation effects in some small regions .
this leads to the presence of some dark regions , much darker than those in the input images .
the same circumstance appears in the enhanced images using ssr , as shown in figure 10d .
although the enhanced images using ssr have brighter distribution than the input images , the contrast between venous and non - venous does not show much of an increase .
it can be seen in figure 10b that the images enhanced using in [ 12 ] has good image contrast and clear edges between the venous and non - venous regions .
unfortunately , some of the vein patterns are lost in the local regions .
moreover , the thickness of the veins in figure 10b increases compared to those in the input images .
for images enhanced using sr [ 13 ] , low image contrast regions in roi images is still poor in the corresponding regions in figure 10c .
the proposed gfssr concentrates on investigating the effects of finger tissue on finger vein imaging .
borrowing the adjustable edge - preserving ability of guided filter , the images enhanced using the proposed gfssr has better image contrast not only in the global image , but also in local regions .
in addition , as shown in figure 10f , the enhanced images have much clearer edges , especially in the vague local regions .
furthermore , the thickness of the veins in figure 10f remains the same as with those in the input images .

4.4 .
comparison of matching accuracy since image enhancement methods for finger vein images aim to enhance the image quality , ultimately to provide improvement of the matching accuracy of the fvrss , the focus of experiments in this section was on evaluating the improvement of matching performance conferred by each method in figure 10 .
in this paper , dwt [ 12,16 ] , lbp [ 29 ] , and lpq [ 30 ] are adopted for feature extraction .
all the experiments are performed on mmcbnu _ 6000 and utfvp .
like the experiment designed in section 4.2 , the eer value was adopted to evaluate the matching accuracies and further to illustrate effectiveness of the image enhancement methods .
cosine distance is used for dwt while euclidean distance is employed for lbp and lpq to measure similarity between two images .
the nearest neighbor classifier was employed for matching .
for mmcbnu _ 6000 and utfvp , each finger was considered as an individual .
4.4.1 .
experiments results on mmcbnu _ 6000 five finger vein images from one individual in mmcbnu _ 6000 were selected as the training set , while the remaining five images were used as the test set .
the number of genuine and imposter matches are 3000 ( 600 x 5 ) and 1,797,000 ( 600 x 599 x 5 ) , respectively .
the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves of the different image enhancement methods with different algorithms for feature extraction are depicted in figure 10 .
the eer values and the improved ratios calculated based on the eer values obtained using original image are listed in table 1 .
the positive ratios represent the corresponding image enhancement algorithm can enhance the matching accuracy while the negative ratios denote the image enhancement method can degrade the matching accuracy .
it is clearly shown that ssr , which is effective for facial image illumination normalization , is not beneficial for enhancing the quality of finger vein when using dwt and lpq for feature extraction .
he exacerbates the poor image contrast in some local regions , as shown in figure 10e , and thus cannot enhance the matching accuracy .
in contrast , sr can enhance the performance a little by using dwt and lpq for feature extraction .
note that different feature extraction algorithms focus on extracting different kinds of features from an image and different image enhancement methods aims at enhancing images in various styles .
thus , as listed in table 1 , dwt , lbp , and lpq gave various matching accuracies on different enhanced images .
ssr is beneficial for image enhancement when using lbp for feature extraction , but it fails with usage of dwt and lpq .
a similar circumstance appears for images enhanced using in. these cases demonstrate that in , sr , ssr and he are not stable for enhancing image quality .
however , it is shown in figure 11 and table 1 that the proposed gfssr has the best performance , no matter which feature extraction was adopted .
it results in making lowest eer values , which reduces eer values by 34.6 % , 31.8 % , and 33.0 % compared to the eer values obtained on the original images , using dwt , lbp , and lpq , respectively .

furthermore , the proposed gfssr takes only 6.3 ms for analysis of an roi image , which illustrates that it is sufficiently fast in practice .
4.4.2 .
experiments results on utfvp for utfvp , two finger vein images from one individual were selected as the training set , while the remaining two images were used as the test set .
the number of genuine and imposter matches are 720 ( 360 x 2 ) and 258,480 ( 360 x 359 x 2 ) , respectively .
figure 12 shows the roc curves using dwt , lbp , and lpq for feature extraction and the corresponding eer values and improved ratios are listed in table 2 .
compared with the eer values achieved on mmcbnu _ 6000 , the eer values obtained on utfvp is large , no matter which kinds of feature extraction algorithms are adopted .
this may results from the fewer number of images for training than those in mmbnu _ 6000.however , the proposed gfssr is stable for image enhancement .
it is clearly shown in table 2 that proposed gfssr has the best performance , resulting in achieving lowest eer values .
it can reduce eer values by 26.6 % , 33.9 % , and 46.5 % using dwt , lbp , and lpq , respectively .
other image enhancement methods can also reduce eer values to some degrees ; however , they are not stable for reducing eer values using all adopted feature extraction methods .
in can enhance matching accuracy when using dwt and lpq for feature extraction , but it fails when extracting features using lbp .
similar cases appear in sr , ssr , and he. figure 12 roc curves of different image enhancement methods on utfvp using different feature extraction algorithms : ( a ) dwt method ; ( b ) lbp method ; and ( c ) lpq method .

conclusions in this paper , an intensity variation normalization method was proposed for finger vein recognition .
the method was based on a model that reasonably describes the effect of finger tissues on finger vein images .
in this model , a captured finger vein image was regarded as the multiplication of the intensity variation and the reflectance images .
to accurately obtain the intensity variation image , the guided filter was adopted since it has adaptive edge - preserving smoothing ability especially in local regions .
the intensity variation component could then be normalized in the logarithm domain .
the comparative experiments on image enhancement and matching accuracy demonstrated that the proposed method had better performance compared to the common methods for finger vein image enhancement and recognition .
taking into account that the capacities and percentages of the tissue components vary among a person , the adaptive current for each individual to capture high quality finger vein images will be investigated in our future research .

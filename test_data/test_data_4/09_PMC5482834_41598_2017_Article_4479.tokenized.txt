this study was a meta - analysis of the literature on the efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( tdf ) in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis b in pregnancies with high viral load .
four observational studies and one randomized controlled trial involving 585 pregnant women and 595 newborns were included in the meta - analysis .
tdf was more effective than the placebo in reducing vertical transmission in hbeag - positive chronic hepatitis b ( chb ) pregnancies with high serum hbv - dna levels ( or = 0.21 , 95 % ci = 0.07 - 0.61 ) at 4 - 12 months , infant hbv dna seropositivity at delivery ( or = 0.16 , 95 % ci = 0.07 - 0.37 ) , and a severe flair in maternal alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) levels ( or = 0.43 , 95 % ci = 0.19 - 0.95 ) during pregnancy .
in addition , tdf showed more improvement in hbv dna suppression at delivery ( or = 254.46 , 95 % ci = 28.39 - 2280.79 ) .
no significant differences were found in hbeag seroconversion or alt normalization ; or in rates of cesarean section , emergent cesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , prematurity , congenital malformations , or infant death .
however , tdf induced more drug - related adverse events ( or = 2.33 , 95 % ci = 1.39 - 3.89 ) and elevated creatine kinase ( ck ) ( or = 9.56 , 95 % ci = 1.17 - 78.09 ) than in controls .
the available evidence suggests that tdf is effective and safe in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis b in pregnancies exhibiting a high viral load .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction infection with chronic hepatitis b ( chb ) virus remains a major challenge to global health , with approximately 240 million carriers and an estimated > 600,000 deaths annually due to chb - related disease1 .
vertical transmission of hbv from hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) - positive and hepatitis b e antigen ( hbeag ) - positive pregnancies to infants remains the predominant mode of chb infection , with up to 90 % of infants from these pregnant women becoming chronically infected with hbv without immunoprophylaxis1 - 4 , which may be partially due to the active replication and hbeag positivity of women during their reproductive years5 , 6 .
programs combining postnatal active and passive immunoprophylaxis and universal vaccination have successfully reduced the transmission rates of hbv from > 90 % to about 10 % 3 , 7 , 8 ; however , there are still about 8 % - 30 % of newborns that fail active hbv immunoprophylaxis ( particularly those born to pregnant women with high serum hbv - dna levels of > 2 x 105 - 107 iu / ml8 - 13 ) , mainly due to a further increase in the global prevalence of chb .
thus , preventing vertical transmission of hbv is an effective way to reduce the global burden of chb .
an increasing number of studies have suggested that antiviral therapies for chb with perinatal oral nucleotide analogues ( nas ) significantly reduce the risk of vertical transmission of hbv in pregnancies with high serum hbv - dna levels ; however , these studies have also shown some conflicting results2 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 .
in contrast to lamivudine ( lam ) , telbivudine ( ldt ) and adefovir ( adv ) manifest potency limitations and low threshold to resistance , and tdf is the only approved na showing greatest potency but without any associated clinical resistance16 , 17 .
the favorable efficacy and safety profile of tdf have been well demonstrated for the treatment of hiv mono - infected and hiv / hbv co - infected mothers10 , 18 - 20 , but the data on the use of tdf in hbv mono - infected pregnancy are limited .
since pan et al. published their first case series in 201210 where they evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of tdf in hbv mono - infected pregnancy , there have been several observational studies published in this area2 , 3 , 10 , 11 , 21 - 24 .
recently , an excellent systematic review involving 26 studies was conducted by brown et al.25 , in which these authors comprehensively evaluated the efficacy and safety of lam , ldt and tdf used in pregnancy ; but only 3 observational studies on tdf ( all with small sample sizes ) were included in the study , and the results were limited2 , 3 , 23 .
since then , a multi - center , randomized controlled trial was published to powerfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety profile of tdf in highly viremic chb mothers8 ; however , according to the fda drug category for pregnancy , tdf is still classified as category b for use in pregnancy , and therefore , guidelines form the who14 , aasld17 and apasl ( 2015 update ) 16 made this issue a priority for the development of clinical practice guidelines and the synthesis of evidence .
to maximize sample size and add the latest evidence , we performed a systematic review and meta - analysis to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of oral tdf therapy in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis b in pregnancies carrying a high viral load .
results a flow diagram summarizing the process of study selection is illustrated in fig. 1. a total of 345 potential studies published through july 31 , 2016 were identified in a preliminary search of literature databases .
after removing duplicates and initially screening publications by browsing their titles and abstracts , 16 publications ( including 4 systemic reviews ) regarding the efficacy and safety of tdf used in chb mono - infected patients were identified ; then we conducted further screening by browsing the full texts of the remaining publications , and reference lists to these articles were also manually searched , such that there were no studies conducted on the same populations .
finally , 5 studies were included according to our inclusion criteria , and the excluded articles and reasons for exclusion of each article are shown in supplementary table s1 .
figure 1 flowchart of study selection35 .
characteristics of included studies five studies , including 4 observational studies2 , 3 , 22 , 23 and 1 rct8 , involving 585 pregnant women and 595 newborns , were included in the present meta - analysis .
these very recent studies were published from 2013 to 2016 ; 2 studies were conducted in china8 , 23 , and another 3 studies were conducted in north american22 , australia2 and turkey3 , respectively .
the participants in all studies in the tdf group received 300 mg of tdf once daily , with a baseline hbv dna level of > 7.7 ( range , 7.7 - 8.28 ) log10 iu / ml , and an average baseline alt level of 30.5 u / l. in 4 studies tdf treatment was initiated from gestational weeks 30 - 32 until 4 - 12 weeks following delivery2 , 8 , 22 , 23 , while in the remaining studies tdf treatment was initiated from gestational weeks 18 - 27 until 4 weeks following delivery3 .
the pregnant women in the control group in all studies did not receive antiviral therapy .
in 4 studies the investigators compared tdf versus control3 , 8 , 22 , 23 , while in 1 study researchers compared tdf versus lam or control2 .
all infants in the included studies received a 3 - dose hbv vaccination and hepatitis b immune globulin ( hbig ) administration after delivery , and all mothers in these studies were instructed not to breast - feed their infants during the period in which they were receiving tdf treatment .
more characteristics of the studies and baseline information on hbig + hbv vaccine administered to infants are summarized in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .
the overall quality of the included studies was adequate , and the bias risk for the included rct study was low ; while the mean score for 4 included observational studies was 8 ( table 3 ) .

maternal outcomes compared to controls , tdf treatment significantly improved hbv dna suppression at delivery ( 3 studies , or = 254.46 , 95 % ci = 28.39 - 2280.79 ; p = 0.000 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
two studies depicted the efficacy of tdf on maternal hbeag seroconversion ; however , no significant difference was found between the 2 groups in this index ( or = 1.05 , 95 % ci = 0.04 - 29.51 ; p = 0.979 ) ( fig. 2 ) , and the hbv dna levels in the treatment group gradually increased and became comparable to those of the control group at 1 to 6 months after the discontinuation of tdf8 , 23 .
however , in the study conducted by celen et al.3 , 61.9 % ( 13 / 21 ) of mothers still showed hbv dna < 50 iu / ml at 28 weeks postpartum .
regarding the influence of maternal serum alt levels , synthesis results from 3 studies suggested that tdf generated a less - severe flare in alt levels ( or = 0.43 , 95 % ci = 0.19 - 0.95 ; p = 0.038 ) during pregnancy ( fig. 3 ) .
however , no significant difference was found in maternal alt normalization at delivery ( 1 cohort , or = 2.55 , 95 % ci = 0.65 - 10.01 ; p = 0.180 ) ( fig. 3 ) .

figure 3 forest plot showing meta - analysis of maternal outcomes for studies comparing tdf versus control at delivery , based upon fixed - effects model .
when comparing tdf therapy with respect to controlling for maternal harm , there were no statistical differences found in the rates of cesarean section ( 4 studies , or = 0.80 , 95 % ci = 0.41 - 1.56 ; p = 0.521 ) ( fig. 2 ) , emergent cesarean section ( 3 studies , or = 1.57 , 95 % ci = 0.68 - 3.66 ; p = 0.291 ) ( fig. 3 ) , or postpartum hemorrhage ( 2 studies , or = 0.73 , 95 % ci = 0.26 - 2.07 ; p = 0.549 ) ( fig. 3 ) .
although tdf induced more drug - related adverse events ( 4 studies , or = 2.33 , 95 % ci = 1.39 - 3.89 ; p = 0.001 ) and elevated ck ( 2 studies , or = 9.56 , 95 % ci = 1.17 - 78.09 ; p = 0.035 ) compared with controls ( fig. 3 ) , almost all of the tdf - related adverse events and elevations in ck levels were grades 1 or 2 , including fatigue , headache , cough , diarrhea , fever , nausea , pruritus , palpitation , dyspepsia , rash , insomnia , dizziness , abdominal pain , jaundice , and upper respiratory infection ; however , all of these adverse events were mild or moderate , and symptomatic therapy or a temporary withdrawal of tdf alleviated adverse events and / or the patients could return to normal activities .
in the study comparing tdf to lam2 , there was no difference found in any of several maternal outcomes ( fig. 4 ) ; however , the data here were limited .
figure 4 forest plot showing meta - analysis of maternal outcomes for studies comparing tdf versus lam at delivery , based upon random - effects model .
the quality of the evidence regarding maternal outcomes was low to very low due to the observational nature of the studies , imprecision , and indirectness ; and moderate for adverse events due to imprecision .
the online supplementary table s3 summarizes the quality of evidence ( grade ) for infant and maternal outcomes .
infant outcomes as shown in fig. 5 , our analysis showed that infants born from pregnant women treated with tdf had a significantly lower vertical transmission rate compared to those born from the control group , as defined by infant hbsag seropositivity at 4 - 12 months ( 5 studies , or = 0.21 , 95 % ci = 0.07 - 0.61 ; p = 0.004 ) , and tdf showed better improvement in reducing infant hbv dna seropositivity at delivery ( 2 studies , or = 0.16 , 95 % ci = 0.07 - 0.37 ; p = 0.000 ) .
tdf also significantly reduced the risk of infant hbv dna seropositivity at delivery by 17.6 % , and 1.36 % - 18 % of newborns failed hbv immunoprophylaxis2 , 3 , 8 , 22 , 23 in the control group .
figure 5 forest plot showing meta - analysis of infant outcomes for studies comparing tdf versus control , based upon fixed - effects model .
compared to controls , tdf therapy did not show any statistically significant differences in rates of prematurity ( 4 cohorts , or = 2.35 , 95 % ci = 0.80 - 6.94 ; p = 0.121 ) , infant death ( 5 cohorts , or = 1.54 , 95 % ci = 0.25 - 9.56 ; p = 0.644 ) , or congenital malformations ( 5 cohorts , or = 1.85 , 95 % ci = 0.42 - 8.18 ; p = 0.420 ) .
the congenital malformations observed in these studies were congenital chromosomal disorder syndrome22 , polydactyly 2,23 , unilateral deafness and absent ear2 , torticollis , umbilical hernia and hypospadias8 .
in the study comparing tdf and lam2 , the authors observed no differences in any of several infant outcomes ( fig. 6 ) ; however , these data were again limited .

publication bias we were unable to evaluate publication bias due to the small number of studies available for each outcome .
discussion chb infection remains a major challenge to global health , and by blocking the routes of hbv transmission , global health rates should improve .
vertical transmission is currently the predominant mode of chb infection , and a linear association between vertical transmission and maternal viral load levels has been demonstrated in several studies9 , 13 , 17 .
additionally , 8 % - 30 % of newborns who were born to pregnant women with a high serum hbv - dna level of > 2 x 105 - 107 iu / ml8 - 13 showed failed immunoprophylaxis .
however , vertical transmission also did not occur in pregnant women with hbv - dna levels < 2 x 105 iu / ml , as reported in a few studies13 , 26 .
thus , aasld guidelines now recommend an hbv dna level of > 2 x 105 iu / ml , but not <= 2 x 105 iu / ml , as the threshold to initiate antiviral therapy in the prevention of vertical transmission , based on low - quality existing evidence17 .
women who are infected with chb in their childbearing years may require antiviral therapy , and those women being treated for chb may become pregnant .
unfortunately , the efficacy and safety of antivirals during pregnancy ( especially their impact on potential teratogenicity ) has not yet been proven ; and there have been no identifiable antiviral drugs recommended to reduce vertical transmission of hbv .
thus , characterizing the efficacy and safety of these medications for mother and infant during pregnancy would help inform optimization and potential treatment choices for women of childbearing age .
brown and colleagues25 recently carried out an excellent systematic review involving 26 studies that comprehensively evaluated the efficacy and safety of lam , ldt and tdf used in pregnancy ; and their results revealed that use of lam and ldt significantly reduced vertical transmission and they were safe in pregnant women , with no increase in adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
these same authors identified no safety issues with tdf use in maternal or fetal outcomes , possibly because their meta - analysis contained an insufficient amount of controlled outcome data .
in the present systematic review , we added the latest evidence to clearly delineate the benefits and risks associated with tdf use in pregnant women infected with chb at a high viral load : synthesis results revealed that tdf was effective and safe in improving maternal hbv dna suppression at delivery and in reducing fetal hbsag seropositivity at 4 - 12 months or hbv dna seropositivity at delivery .
most importantly , tdf significantly reduced vertical transmission at 4 - 12 months postpartum , without increasing rates of cesarean section , emergent cesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage of the mother ; and prematurity , infant death , and congenital malformations in infants .
in the current study , we also found that 1.36 % - 18 % of newborns failed hbv immunoprophylaxis when their mothers were untreated , which was consistent with previously existing evidence8 - 13 .
in addition , maternal virus rebounded and became comparable to levels of the control group at 1 to 6 months after the discontinuation of tdf .
the favorable safety profile of tdf has been well demonstrated in hiv mono - infected and hiv / hbv co - infected mothers10 , 18 - 20 ; and all of these results , then , support the use of antiviral therapy to reduce maternal viral load and rescue infants from failed immunoprophylaxis .
there were insufficient controlled outcome data to compare tdf with other nas in chb - infected pregnant women with high viral load , and results from one included study suggested that there was no statistically significant difference between tdf and lam on maternal and infant outcomes ; however , due to the limitations of potency and low threshold to resistance of lam and ldt , tdf remains a promising na used in preventing vertical transmission .
tdf is also approved as possessing the highest potency and is the only approved na without any associated clinical resistance after up to 6 years of monotherapy for chb16 , 27 .
in fact , in recent studies , tdf has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in pregnant women with chb who have lam or ldt resistance24 , 28 .
according to the fda drug category for pregnancy , tdf and ldt are classified as category b for use in pregnancy ; while lam , adv and etv are classified as category c drugs based primarily on animal data16 .
although breast - feeding by women who are on antiviral therapy is still controversial and not recommended , data from small studies in hiv - infected women have demonstrated that the median amount of tdf ingested from breast milk was only 0.03 % of the recommended pediatric dose29 , 30 , and thus oral tdf appears safe and is recommended before using other nas .
the conclusions of this systematic review should be treated with caution due to several limitations .
first , studies warranting high confidence are absent from the present meta - analysis , with only one rct ; and most of the data are derived from observational studies , which are subject to significant biases - especially selection bias .
second , the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low due to the observational nature of the studies , imprecision , and indirectness .
third , several questions addressed in the previous aasld hbv guidelines were not resolved in this systematic review : a ) what is the exact viral load threshold and the exact week within the third trimester at which therapy should be initiated ? and b ) is it safe for infants to be exposed to antivirals late in pregnancy from longitudinal follow - up and breast - feeding while the mothers are on antiviral therapy ?
it has been speculated that the risk of hbv vertical transmission ( despite active and passive immunoprophylaxis at birth ) , could be partially attributable to an unsatisfactory approach in terms of the timing of prophylaxis and quality of the vaccine adopted , and thus , c ) is there a relationship between the timing or quality of immunoprophylaxis and the risk of vertical transmission ?
none of these subjects has been well documented presently because data from controlled studies for these patient populations were sparse and require further corroboration in the future , especially in the form of high - quality , larger - scale rcts .
in conclusion , oral tdf lowers hbv dna levels in chb - infected pregnant women as it does in non - pregnant women , and it reduces the rates of vertical transmission .
these effects were demonstrated in chb - infected pregnant women with high viral loads (> 2 x 105 iu / ml ) .
the limited safety data suggest that there is no increased risk for adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ; and therefore , in order to prevent vertical transmission , we conservatively recommend the use of tdf in pregnant women with chb and who manifest high hbv dna levels of > 2 x 105 iu / ml in the third trimester .
materials and methods literature search strategy this systematic review was carried out according to the methodology developed by the cochrane collaborative review group , and we applied the prisma guidelines for the reporting of systematic reviews and meta - analyses31 .
studies published through july 2016 in which investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of tdf in preventing vertical transmission of hbv in pregnancy were identified through systematic searches of pubmed , the ovidsp search platform , acp journal club , cochrane central register of controlled trials , cochrane database of systematic reviews , cochrane methodology register , database of abstracts of reviews of effects , embase , epub ahead of print , in - process & other non - indexed citations , ovid medline ( r ) daily and ovid medline ( r ) 1946 to present , scopus , chinese national knowledge infrastructure ( cnki ) , chinese biomedical literature database ( cbm ) , and wanfang databases , with no language limitations .
the search strategy was designed and modified according to existing reviews25 , and we queried experienced librarians from our affiliated school when necessary ; then an optimized search strategy was conducted by the principal investigator .
reference lists in relevant original and review articles were also manually searched .
full details of the databases searched and that were used to identify the studies included in this meta - analysis are shown in supplementary table s3 .
inclusion criteria we included randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) and controlled observational studies in this meta - analysis if they ( a ) enrolled pregnant women monoinfected with chronic hbv ( characterized by the presence of hbsag for more than 6 months ) , with high serum hbv - dna levels > 6 log copies / ml before antiviral therapy ; ( b ) compared the efficacy and safety profile of tdf with placebo or other nas ; ( c ) reported the outcomes of interest , including prevention of vertical transmission of hbv , clinical efficacy , and adverse outcomes from antiviral therapy to both mothers and newborns ; and ( d ) provided sufficient information for estimating odds ratios ( or ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
however , studies that enrolled infants who did not receive immunization during the first week postpartum ; or that enrolled patients who received steroids , chemotherapy / immunotherapy , liver transplantation , or hemodialysis ; or unpublished reports and abstracts or published as abstracts only ; or uncontrolled studies , were excluded25 .
in the case of recent studies , we included those entailing the largest number of patients , especially when studies had overlapping ( or the same ) sample sizes .
incomplete data or missing data and additional studies were obtained by contacting authors by email , telephone , or other mode of communication data extraction two reviewers ( jzc and zwl ) independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts from the literature and identified eligible papers based upon the inclusion criteria .
next , the full texts of potentially eligible papers were further reviewed following the same procedure .
three reviewers ( lfh , rks and wbw ) independently extracted the following data using a standardized , pretested excel form : study characteristics , participant baseline characteristics , intervention details , and outcomes of interest .
discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third author ( zh ) .
outcomes outcomes of interest were as follows : maternal outcomes including hbv dna suppression , hbeag seroconversion , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) normalization , severe flares of alt levels ( defined as an elevated alt level > 5 times the upper limit of the normal range ) 8 ; rates of cesarean section , emergent cesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , and adverse events ; and elevated levels of creatine kinase ( ck ) .
infant outcomes included vertical transmission ( defined as hbsag seropositivity at 6 - 12 months or hbv dna positivity at 6 - 12 months ) , prematurity , congenital malformations , and infant death .
bias risk assessments two reviewers ( jzc and zwl ) independently assessed the bias risk of rcts with the cochrane risk of bias assessment tool , and the newcastle - ottawa scale for observational studies .
the quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment , development , and evaluation approach ( grade ) ; and criteria used to evaluate the quality of evidence were risk of bias , including indirectness ( surrogate outcomes ) , imprecision ( wide confidence intervals ) , inconsistency ( heterogeneity ) , and publication bias25 , 32 .
statistical analysis we calculated the odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) using the binomial distribution for dichotomized outcomes , and we planned to use the mean difference ( md ) or standardized mean difference ( smd ) between the baseline and the longest duration of follow - up for each study of continuous outcomes .
heterogeneity across studies was assessed by calculating i2 : a value < 25 % was considered low ; 25 - 50 % , moderate ; and > 50 % , high .
we planned to calculate the pooled effect size using the ( i - v heterogeneity ) random - effects model when i2 > 50 % , and a mantel - haenszel ( m - h ) fixed - effects model otherwise33 , 34 .
the significance of pooled effect size was determined using the z - test , with a 2 - tailed p < 0.05 defined as the significance threshold .
if appropriate , we planned to repeat the meta - analysis after excluding individual studies to assess the stability of the results .
if the included studies were unsuitable or insufficient , studies were identified for meta - analysis in terms of certain outcomes of interest , and we summarized the results qualitatively ; if the included rcts were insufficient , we planned to synthesize the results of rcts with controlled observational studies .
publication bias was assessed using the egger regression asymmetry test and begg 's funnel plots when a sufficient number of studies (> 20 ) per outcome were available and if heterogeneity was low25 .
all statistical tests for this meta - analysis were performed using stata , version 12 ( statacorp lp , college station , tx ) .

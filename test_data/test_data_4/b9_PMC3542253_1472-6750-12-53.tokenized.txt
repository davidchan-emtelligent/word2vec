background pseudomonas putida kt2440 is able to synthesize large amounts of medium - chain - length polyhydroxyalkanoates ( mcl - phas ) .
to reduce the substrate cost , which represents nearly 50 % of the total pha production cost , xylose , a hemicellulose derivate , was tested as the growth carbon source in an engineered p. putida kt2440 strain .
results the genes encoding xylose isomerase ( xyla ) and xylulokinase ( xylb ) from escherichia coli w3110 were introduced into p. putida kt2440 .
the recombinant kt2440 exhibited a xyla activity of 1.47 u and a xylb activity of 0.97 u when grown on a defined medium supplemented with xylose .
the cells reached a maximum specific growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 and a final cell dry weight ( cdw ) of 2.5 g l - 1 with a maximal yield of 0.5 g cdw g - 1 xylose .
since no mcl - pha was accumulated from xylose , mcl - pha production can be controlled by the addition of fatty acids leading to tailor - made pha compositions .
sequential feeding strategy was applied using xylose as the growth substrate and octanoic acid as the precursor for mcl - pha production .
in this way , up to 20 % w w - 1 of mcl - pha was obtained .
a yield of 0.37 g mcl - pha per g octanoic acid was achieved under the employed conditions .
conclusions sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more cost - effective mcl - pha production .
this study is the first reported attempt to produce mcl - pha by using xylose as the growth substrate .
further process optimizations to achieve higher cell density and higher productivity of mcl - pha should be investigated .
these scientific exercises will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl - pha production from renewable feedstock .
mcl - pha xylose octanoic acid pseudomonas putida kt2440 sequential - feeding tailor - made pha background polyhydroxyalkanoates ( phas ) are bacterial storage compounds produced widely by many microorganisms under nutrient limited growth conditions such as a nitrogen , phosphorous or oxygen starvation and when an excess of carbon source is present [ 1,2 ] .
phas gained particular interest because they were shown to be biodegradable and biocompatible ( see review [ 3 ]) .
based on the chain length of the fatty acid monomers , phas can be classified into three categories : short - chain - length ( scl ) phas with 3 to 5 carbon atoms , medium - chain - length ( mcl ) phas with 6 to 14 carbon atoms and long - chain - length ( lcl ) phas with more than 14 carbon atoms [ 4 ] .
the difference in length and / or chemical structure of the alkyl side chain of the phas influences the material properties of the polymers to a great extent .
the production of tailor - made mcl - phas enables to obtain the desired material properties using the appropriate fatty acid precursor .
phas have been considered as an attractive ecofriendly alternative to petrochemical polymers .
however , the much higher production cost compared with conventional petrochemical derived polymers has limited their widespread use .
much effort has been devoted to reduce the price of phas by developing better bacterial strains , more efficient fermentation and / or more economical recovery processes [ 6 - 11 ] .
it has been shown that the cost of raw materials ( mainly the carbon source ) contributes most significantly to the overall production cost of phas ( up to 50 % of the total production cost ) [ 12 ] .
the use of two kinds of carbon sources can be an attractive approach to reduce cost : the first carbon substrate is used for cell growth to obtain biomass , while the second one ( which may be more expensive ) allows the synthesis of pha .
the substrate for bacterial growth should be inexpensive and abundant .
xylose is second only to glucose in natural abundance [ 13 ] .
thus , it is a promising candidate substrate for bacterial growth .
d - xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses in plants of all species of the gramineae .
hemicellulose , the third most abundant polymer in nature , can be easily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars by either chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis [ 14 ] .
in some plants , xylan comprises up to 40 % of the total dry material .
annually , 60 billion tons of hemicelluloses are produced and remain almost completely unused [ 15 ] .
it has been reported that the hemicellulose hydrolysate including xylose can be used by candida blankii for efficient protein production [ 16 ] .
there are also reports that poly ( 3 - hydroxybutyrate ) ( phb ) could be synthesized from xylose in pseudomonas pseudoflava and p. cepacia up to 22 % ( w w - 1 ) and 50 % ( w w - 1 ) , respectively [ 17 - 19 ] .
furthermore , escherichia coli harboring pha synthesis genes of ralstonia eutropha was reported to be able to accumulate phb from xylose up to 74 % w w - 1 with a yield of 0.226 g phb per g xylose [ 20 ] .
up to now , no report has been published on the production of mcl - pha by using xylose .
since mcl - phas offer different material properties compared to scl - phas , it would be interesting to investigate whether mcl - phas can be obtained from xylose .
pseudomonas putida kt2440 , whose genome sequence is available ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) , is one of the best - characterized pseudomonads for mcl - pha production [ 21 ] .
it is able to synthesize and accumulate large amounts ( up to 75 % w w - 1 ) of mcl - phas [ 22 ] , but can only ferment a narrow range of sugars , in which xylose is not included .
it has been shown that an engineered strain of p. putida s12 can utilize d - xylose and l - arabinose [ 23 ] .
introducing xyla ( encoding xylose isomerase ) and xylb ( encoding xylulokinase ) from e. coli into p. putida s12 enabled the latter to utilize xylose as the sole carbon source .
in this study , the possibility of using xylose as a growth carbon source and octanoic acid as mcl - pha precusor in the controlled production of mcl - pha by recombinant p. putida kt2440 was examined .
the xylab genes from e. coli w3110 were cloned into p. putida kt2440 and the obtained recombinant was studied for its ability to grow on xylose .
for mcl - pha production a sequential feeding strategy of using xylose and fatty acids was applied .
results cloning and expression of the xyla and xylb genes encoding xylose isomerase and xylulokinase to clone the xylab genes , which are organized in an operon , of e. coli w3110 , dna primers pfxyla1 and prxylb were designed based on the genomic sequence of e. coli w3110 ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) .
these primers were used to amplify the xylab fragment by pcr with w3110 chromosomal dna as the template , leading to a 2.85 kb dna product ( xylab ) .
the pcr product was inserted into the shuttle vector pvlt33 as described in methods , resulting in pslm1 plasmid. p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) was grown on e2 minimal medium with either 10 g l - 1 xylose or glucose , leading to a c / n ratio of 17 g g - 1. p. putida kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) was used as a control .
when grown on glucose , kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) exhibited a higher maximal specific growth rate ( 0.32 h - 1 ) than kt2440 ( pslm1 ) ( 0.26 h - 1 ) ( figure 1a & 1b ) .
due to nitrogen limitation both kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) and kt2440 ( pslm1 ) exhibited reduced growth rate after 14 h , with the latter having a dramatic reduction ( figure 1b ) .
the difference in the degree of the reduction in growth rate could be partially caused by the different pha content in kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) ( about 20 % w w - 1 ) and kt2440 ( pslm1 ) ( about 1 % w w - 1 ) .
the different pha content was also reflexed by the different maximum od600 values reached by kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) ( 4.28 ) and kt2440 ( pslm1 ) ( 2.94 ) ( figure 1a & 1b ) .
when xylose was used as the sole carbon source , kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) was not able to grow during the entire test period ( figure 1c ) , whereas the recombinant kt2440 ( pslm1 ) exhibited a typical bacterial growth curve ( figure 1d & 1e ) .
the maximum specific growth rate of the iptg - induced recombinant kt2440 ( pslm1 ) culture was similar to the culture without induction , of mu = 0.23 h - 1 and mu = 0.21 h - 1 , respectively .
this demonstrates that the expression of xylab from pslm1 is not tightly regulated and xylab can be expressed even without the induction by iptg .
the recombinant kt2440 ( pslm1 ) reached a maximal od600 value of 3.66 on xylose .
in all experiments the carbon substrate ( either glucose or xylose ) was not totally consumed at the end of the cultivation , around 4 g l - 1 was left over in the culture broth .

the arrow represents the addition of iptg .
the experiments were performed in replicate flasks .
data points are the averages of the results of duplicate measurements .
these results suggest that the cloned xylab from e. coli are functionally expressed in p. putida kt2440 , and xylab alone are sufficient to allow the growth of kt2440 on xylose .
to have better controlled growth , further experiments were performed in bioreactors .
growth of p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) on xylose in the bioreactor p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) was grown on e2 medium with 10 g l - 1 xylose in a 3.7 l laboratory bioreactor .
figure 2 shows that the kt2440 ( pslm1 ) cells utilized xylose as the sole carbon source with a maximum specific growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 .
the growth stopped due to nitrogen limitation after 13 h of cultivation .
afterwards the biomass increased only slightly from 2.2 g l - 1 to maximum 2.7 g l - 1 at 28 h. even though nitrogen - limitation was reached , xylose was further consumed and finally only a tiny amount was left in the medium ( figure 2 ) .
the biomass yield from xylose was about 0.5 g g - 1 upon nitrogen limitation ( 13 h of cultivation ) , and about 0.27 g g - 1 upon the xylose depletion .
the consumed xylose after nitrogen completion may have been used for cell maintenance and / or by - products such as acetic acid .
indeed , large amounts of acetic acid were detected from the beginning of the growth , in the range of several hundred milligrams per liter .
the culture was also assayed for pha content at different time points .
only trace amounts ( up to 0.3 % w w - 1 ) of pha were detected using xylose as the sole carbon source , which enables to use xylose as growth substrate for the production of tailor - made mcl - phas .
figure 2 growth of p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) in e2 minimal medium with 10 g l - 1 xylose in a 3.7 l bioreactor .
data points are the averages of the results of duplicate measurements .
to confirm the enzymatic activities of xyla and xylb , cells were harvested at the early exponential growth phase ( od600 of about 0.5 ) .
samples without substrates and samples without cell - free extracts were used as negative controls , while e. coli w3110 cells grown on e2 with xylose were used as the positive control .
the specific activities of xylose isomerase and xylulokinase measured in p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) were 1.47 u and 0.97 u , respectively , whereas no significant activites were observed in the negative controls ( table 1 ) .
the activities obtained here were in the same range as those found in wild - type e. coli w3110 ( table 1 ) .
these results confirmed that both xyla and xylb were active in p. putida kt2440 .
the enzymatic activities of xyla and xylb were also found for the non - induced cultures , thus , induction by iptg is not needed for the expression of xyla and xylb genes and was therefore omitted in the following experiments .

pha production in kt2440 ( pslm1 ) by sequential - feeding of xylose and fatty acid nitrogen limitation is known to promote pha accumulation [ 1 ] .
it has been demonstrated that nitrogen limitation can lead to a strong induction of phag encoding a transacylase , resulting in mcl - pha accumulation from carbohydrate in p. putida kt2440 [ 24 ] .
thus , in the experiments performed in mini - reactors the amount of nitrogen present in e2 medium was decreased to 20 % ( namely 0.2ne2 medium ) to obtain the best conditions for mcl - pha accumulation .
as expected , kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) did not show any growth on xylose ( table 2 , culture a ) , similar as observed in figure 1 .
kt2440 ( pslm1 ) exhibited a maximal specific growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 on xylose with a maximum od600 of 0.99 ( table 2 , culture b ) .
no pha was detected for kt2440 ( pslm1 ) on xylose .

to test whether the recombinant is able to accumulate mcl - pha from related carbon source ( e. g. octanoic acid ) , kt2440 ( pslm1 ) was pre - cultured in e2 minimal medium with xylose as the sole carbon source and then transferred into a bioreactor containing 0.2ne2 medium with 10 mm octanoic acid as the sole carbon source ( table 2 , culture c ) .
samples were taken regularly and the cellular pha content was determined .
it was found that kt2440 ( pslm1 ) was able to accumulate mcl - pha to 21 % ( w w - 1 ) after 33 h of cultivation .
the above results demonstrate that the recombinant strain kt2440 ( pslm1 ) kept the ability to synthesize pha from fatty acids , but could not do so from xylose .
this allows sequential feeding of xylose and fatty acids to obtain tailor - made mcl - pha biosynthesis , namely , first using an inexpensive carbon source for cell growth and then adding the appropriate mcl - pha precursor to allow the polymer accumulation .
the sequential feeding strategy enables production of a tailor - made mcl - pha according to the supplied fatty acid .
octanoic acid was tested here as mcl - pha precursor in order to obtain poly ( 3 - hydroxyoctanoate ) accumulation .
we first investigated the influence of linear feeding of octanoic acid at different growth stages on pha synthesis .
four minireactors in parallel were inoculated using the same p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) preculture grown in e2 medium with 1.8 g l - 1 xylose .
in cultures d and e linear feeding of 0.072 g l - 1 h - 1 of octanoic acid was initiated at od600 of 0.5 ( 8 h of batch cultivation ) and 1.0 ( 10 h of batch cultivation ) , respectively .
both cultures showed a similar maximum specific growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 ( table 2 ) .
the nitrogen limitation was reached after 11 h and xylose was depleted after 12 h for both cultures .
the maximum accumulation of pha was found to be 12.1 % w w - 1 and 16.2 % w w - 1 for d and e , respectively , after about 20 h of cultivation ( table 2 ) .
the obtained results suggested that pha can be produced in p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) by sequential feeding of xylose and fatty acids .
the exponential phase ended at od600 of 1.0 due to nitrogen limitation .
linear feeding at the end of the exponential growth phase in the batch ( od600 of 1.0 ) gave a better yield of pha compared to that at the mid - exponential growth phase ( od600 of 0.5 ) .
this lower yield obtained in the latter can be explained by consumption of octanoic acid for growth rather than for pha accumulation during the mid - exponential phase .
to increase pha accumulation , the feeding rate was increased from 0.072 g l - 1 h - 1 to 0.288 g l - 1 h - 1 of octanoic acid .
culture f was grown on 0.2ne2 with 1.8 g l - 1 xylose and feeding started at the end of the exponential growth phase with a feeding rate of 0.288 g l - 1 h - 1 of octanoic acid .
for comparison , culture g was supplemented with 1.8 g l - 1 xylose and 1.44 g l - 1 octanoic acid from the beginning on ( batch culture on mixed carbon sources ) .
using culture f as an example , figure 3 represents a typical behavior of cells regarding growth and pha synthesis .
after 7 h and 14.5 h of cultivation , nitrogen and xylose were depleted , respectively .
when cells entered the nitrogen limitation phase a linear feeding of octanoic acid was started for 4 h and then stopped .
pha synthesis was detected after 2 h of feeding and increased linearly to 17.6 % w w - 1 during the following 14 h. only a slight increase of pha content to about 20 % w w - 1 was found after further incubation up to 43 h. the concentration of octanoic acid measured in the culture increased with feeding time , after 7.5 h from the beginning of the feeding about 0.369 g l - 1 octanoic acid was detected ; afterwards it continuously decreased .
at the end of the cultivation , after 48.5 h , the remaining octanoic acid was only 0.069 g l - 1 .
a maximal yield of mcl - pha from octanoic acid of 0.37 g mcl - pha g - 1 octanoic acid was obtained by considering the increase of pha from 6.6 % w w - 1 to 20 % w w - 1 in relation to the consumption of octanoic acid from 0.369 g l - 1 to 0.086 g l - 1 .
figure 3 fed - batch experiment of p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) grown on 0.2ne2 medium containing 1.8 g l - 1 xylose with linear feeding of 0.288 g l - 1h - 1 octanoic acid at od600 of 1 for 4 h. nitrogen ( increment ) , octanoic acid (*) and xylose ( o ) concentrations were measured .
the logarithmic growth is represented by filled squares (*) and the pha accumulation by filled triangles (^) .
data points are the averages of the results of duplicate measurements .
gc analysis revealed that the main monomer component of the synthesized pha was 3 - hydroxyoctanoate ( 87 % w w - 1 ) and no 3 - hydroxydecanoate was detected .
these results confirm that the detected pha is mainly from octanoic acid .
since the main monomer unit of pha produced from carbohydrates is 3 - hydroxydecanoate in kt2440 [ 25,26 ] , it is very unlikely that xylose was used for pha synthesis .
the sequential feeding strategy using xylose as growth substrate and octanoic acid as mcl - pha precursor enabled production of a controlled mcl - pha production .
discussion growth of kt2440 on xylose a recombinant p. putida kt2440 strain was constructed that could efficiently utilize xylose .
the introduction of xylose isomerase ( xyla ) and xylulokinase ( xylb ) was essential and sufficient for the utilization of xylose and a growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 was routinely obtained .
previously , it has been reported that a so called " laboratory evolution " was necessary to improve the growth rate of p. putida s12 ( xylab ) on xylose from 0.01 h - 1 to 0.35 h - 1 and to obtain a yield of 0.52 g cdw per g xylose [ 23 ] .
the laboratory evolution is an adoption process by growing the cells consecutively in a fresh medium containing the unfavorable carbon source .
the " laboratory evolution " was not needed for the kt2440 recombinant to grow on xylose .
this difference could be attributed to the different physiological background / metabolic fluxes of kt2440 and s12 .
it has been reported that in p. putida a complete pentose phosphate pathway is present [ 23,27 ] ( figure 4 ) as well as the key enzymes for mcl - pha accumulation [ 28 ] .
our study demonstrated that the enzymes responsible for converting xylose to the entry intermediate xylulose - 5 - phosphate of pp pathway are missing in p. putida. by introducing the relevant enzymes xyla and xylb , p. putida kt2440 was able to utilize xylose .

enhanced arrows : steps absent in wild - type p. putida strains ; xyla : xylose isomerase ; xylb : xylulokinase ; phag : 3 - hydroxyacyl - acp : coa transferase ; phac : pha polymerase .
in addition , the recombinant p. putida kt2440 appeared to have an efficient xylose uptake system .
similarly , p. putida s12 carrying d - xylonate dehydratase has been reported to grow on xylose without expressing any xylose transporter [ 29 ] .
since pentose and hexose transporters have been shown to be promiscuous [ 30 ] , it is possible that xylose uptake can be accomplished by glucose uptake systems in strain kt2440 ( xylab ) .
many bacteria also possess non - specific transporters .
indeed , many sugars are transported into e. coli by phosphoenolpyruvate - dependent phosphotransferase systems ( pts ) like glucose , mannose , fructose , and n - acetylglucosamine [ 31 ] .
in this study , no specific xylose transporters such as xyle or xylfgh were needed for growth of kt2440 ( xylab ) on xylose .
thus , it is also possible that xylose entered the cell through the pts system present in p. putida in a similar way as reported for fructose [ 32 ] .
xylose , after uptake into the cell , is isomerized by xylose isomerase to xylulose , which is then converted by xylulokinase to xylulose 5 - phosphate .
this phosphorylated derivate is then catabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway .
in comparison to growth on glucose , the growth of p. putida kt2440 ( xylab ) on xylose exhibited a similar specific growth rate of 0.24 h - 1 ( figure 1 ) .
this demonstrated that the uptake and the catabolic rate of xylose by the recombinant p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) is in the same range as that of glucose .
pha production by sequential feeding the biosynthesis of mcl - pha is mainly studied for fluorescent pseudomonads , e.g. p. putida kt2440 .
strain kt2440 is characterized by a wide metabolic and physiologic versatility and is able to accumulate mcl - pha from glucose [ 33 ] .
in this study , we demonstrated that mcl - pha biosynthesis on xylose does not occur when xyla and xylb are expressed even under nitrogen limitation , perhaps because the expression of xylab channels the metabolic flux to central metabolism such as tca cycle for cell maintenance or / and to production of side products like acetate , rather than to pha synthesis ( figure 4 ) .
up to now , there has been no report on mcl - pha production by using xylose as the growth substrate .
substrate cost make up a large proportion of the total production cost of pha .
fatty acids are generally much more expensive than lignocellulose hydrolysates ( such as xylose ) and often toxic to the cells at relatively low concentrations and , for some of them , do not support fast growth rates .
xylose is in a similar price range like cane molasses and half the price of glucose [ 34 ] , consequently , sequential - feeding strategies are a valid option to reduce the production cost [ 35,36 ] .
sequential - feeding consists of using on one hand cheap carbohydrates for achieving a large biomass and on the other hand fatty acids as mcl - pha precursors to produce tailor - made mcl - phas .
in this study , xylose was used for cell growth in the first step , and then octanoate was supplied to synthesize mcl - pha in the second step under nitrogen limitation .
this sequential feeding process allowed a tailor - made mcl - pha accumulation of up to 20 % ( w w - 1 ) under not - yet - optimized conditions .
when 1.44 g l - 1 octanoate was employed alone for growth and pha production ( table 2 , entry c ) , lower pha content ( about 21 % w w - 1 ) was obtained than that from using both xylose and 1.44 g l - 1 octanoate ( table 2 , entry g , about 28.7 % w w - 1 ) , even though the growth rate and the final cell density reached in entry c were higher than those in entry g. these results suggest that xylose is not a substrate as good as octanoate for growth of kt2440 , however , it can facilitate the pha production by being a substrate for growth and allowing only octanoate to be converted to pha .
in this study , p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) showed a biomass yield from xylose at 0.50 g g - 1 , which is similar to what has been previously reported 0.52 g g - 1 for p. putida s12 ( xylab ) [ 23 ] .
previously , kim and co - workers used a sequential feeding strategy to maximize the pha production in p. putida using glucose as growth substrate and then octanoic acid for pha accumulation [ 37 ] .
a yield of 0.4 g mcl - pha g - 1 octanoic acid was reached [ 37 ] , similar to the yield of 0.37 g mcl - pha g - 1 octanoic acid obtained in this study by sequential feeding of xylose and octanoic acid .
however , it has also been reported that the yield of mcl - phas from fatty acids such as nonanoic acid could achieve 0.66 to 0.69 g - 1 mcl - pha g nonanoic acid by co - feeding glucose [ 36 ] .
therefore , further optimization of the sequential - feeding process is needed to increase the yield of tailor - made mcl - phas .
conclusion introduction of xylab from e. coli into p. putida kt2440 was sufficient to allow the recombinant to efficiently utilize xylose as the sole carbon source .
experiments performed in bioreactors showed that xyla and xylb were active in p. putida kt2440 .
the recombinant did not produce mcl - pha from xylose , thus enabled production of a tailor - made mcl - pha of up to 20 % ( w w - 1 ) by sequential - feeding of xylose and octanoate .
a maximal yield of 0.37 g mcl - pha g - 1 octanoic acid was obtained with pha containing mainly 3 - hydroxyoctanoate monomers ( 87 % w w - 1 ) .
sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more cost - effective mcl - pha production .
optimization of initiation , rate and duration of feeding should be performed to achieve a higher yield and higher productivity of mcl - pha .
furthermore , an optimized growth conditions will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl - pha production from renewable feedstock .

if necessary , 25 mug ml - 1 kanamycin was added to the culture medium .
growth in shake flasks the recombinant p. putida kt2440 ( pslm1 ) was pre - cultured in 100 ml of e2 medium containing 10 g l - 1 xylose and 25 mug ml - 1 kanamycin .
the preculture in the exponential growth phase was then transferred to fresh e2 medium containing xylose and kanamycin with a dilution of 1:20 .
this transfer was repeated twice to allow cells to adapt to xylose. p. putida kt2440 ( pvlt33 ) was used as control .
the p. putida cells were grown at 30degreesc with an agitation of 150 rpm in 1 l baffled shake flasks. e. coli cells were grown at 37degreesc in either lb medium or e2 medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source .

batch culture in 3.7 l reactor the bioreactor study was carried out in a 3.7 l laboratory bioreactor ( klf 2000 , bioengineering , wald , switzerland ) with a working volume of 2 l. medium e2 supplemented with 10 g l - 1 xylose as the sole carbon source was used .
the batch bioreactor was inoculated with 300 ml of preculture having an od600 of 2.10 and containing exactly the same medium as the one present in the bioreactor .
the agitation was set at 750 rpm .
the temperature was controlled at 30degreesc and the ph was maintained at 7.0 by automated addition of 4 m koh or 2 m h2so4 .
the dissolved oxygen tension was monitored continuously with an oxygen probe and kept at above 20 % of air saturation ( with a flow of 1 v v - 1 min - 1 ) .
batch culture in 1 l mini - reactors in order to obtain a nitrogen limited growth more rapidly , 0.2ne2 medium was used in these experiments .
four mini - reactor cultures ( a , b , c and d ) were grown in parallel in multifors - multiple benchtop bioreactors ( infors ag , bottmingen , switzerland ) .
temperature was controlled at 30degreesc and ph was maintained at 7.0 by automated addition of 4 m koh or 2 m h2so4 .
the dissolved oxygen tension was monitored continuously with an oxygen probe and kept at 30 % of air saturation .
each reactor was inoculated using the pre - culture which was prepared as described above " growth in shake flasks " .
the initial od600 in bioreactors was about 0.08 .
kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 25 mug ml - 1 when the recombinant was cultivated .
octanoic acid with different concentrations was fed to the bioreactors at different growth stages of the batches , as described in the results section .
enzymatic assays the cell pellets from batch culture were washed twice with 250 mm tris - hcl buffer ph 7.5 , and then lysed by the addition of lytic solution according to the manufacture 's instruction ( celllytic ( tm ) b cell lysis reagent , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the samples were centrifuged at 20'000 g for 3 min in an eppendorf centrifuge .
the supernatant is referred as cell - free extract ( cfe ) .
xylose isomerase ( ec 5.3.1.5 ) was measured in a solution containing 0.2 mm nadh , 50 mm xylose , 10 mm mgso4 , 0.5 u sorbitol dehydrogenase , and 30 mul cfe as it has been described previously [ 41 ] .
the assay was performed in a 96 - well plate at 30degreesc .
the total volume of the assay was 200 mul .
the consumption of nadh was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a plate reader ( bioteck instruments gmbh , luzern , switzerland ) .
one unit is defined as 1 mumole of consumed nadh min - 1 .
xylulokinase ( ec 2.7.1.17 ) was assayed as described previously [ 42 ] .
the assay mixture contained 0.2 mm nadh , 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 2 mm mgcl2 , 2 mm atp , 0.2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate , 8.5 mm atp , 2.5 u pyruvate kinase , 2.5 u lactate dehydrogenase and 30 mul cfe .
the assay was performed at 30degreesc .
the total volume was 200 mul in each well of the 96 - well plate .
the consumption of nadh was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm ( bioteck instruments gmbh , luzern , switzerland ) .
one unit is defined as 1 mumole of consumed nadh min - 1 .
analytical methods cell growth growth of bacterial cells was followed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm ( od600 ) using a uv - visible spectrophotometer ( genesys 6 , thermospectronic , lausanne , switzerland ) .
cell dry weight ( cdw ) was determined using pre - weighed polycarbonate filters ( pore size : 0.2 mum , whatman , scheicher & schuell , dassel , germany ) .
an appropriate volume ( 0.5 to 5 ml ) of culture was filtered in order to obtain a biomass weight of about 2 mg per filter .
the filter was dried overnight at 105degreesc , cooled down to room temperature in a desiccator and then weighted .
the weight difference was used to determine the quantity of biomass per culture volume .
the optical density was correlated to cell dry weight with a ratio of cdw / od = 0.6 when the cells did not contain pha and with a ratio of cdw / od = 0.5 when the cells contained pha .
the maximum specific growth rate was calculated by the log of the biomass concentration ( expressed in od in this study ) at time t2 minus the log of the biomass concentration at time t1 divided by the time interval during the exponential growth phase .
( none ) mu = lnx2 - lnx1t2 - t1 x = biomass concentration expressed in od values measurement of carbon sources the consumption of carbon sources was measured by hplc - ms. samples were diluted to 0.01 to 0.1 mm with 50 % acetic acid and 50 % acetonitrile ( v v - 1 ) and loaded on a reversed phase c18 column ( gemini c18 5 micron , 250 mm x 4.60 mm , phenomenex , u.k. ) .
a gradient of 100 % diluted formic acid ( 0.1 v % in water ) to 100 % acetonitrile was applied as the mobile phase .
the flow rate was 0.8 ml min - 1 and the gradient was completed after 25 min .
the peaks were detected by electrospray ionization ( esi ) in negative mode [ 43 ] .
the standard curves for xylose and octanoic acid were recorded in the range of 0.01 to 1 g l - 1 , and 0.005 g l - 1 to 0.03 g l - 1 , respectively .
ammonium concentration nh4 + - nitrogen consumption was detected using an ammonium test kit following the manufacturer instruction ( merck kgaa , 64271 darmstadt , germany ) .
the detection limit was 0.01 nh4 + - n mg l - 1 .
the method was linear up to 3.0 mg n l - 1 , above which dilution with distilled water was needed .
acetic acid measurement a dx - 500 ion chromatography system ( dionex , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) was used to analyze the acetic acid production during the co - feeding experiments .
ionpac as 11 hc ( 250 mm x 4 mm ) and ag 11 hc guard ( 50 mm x 4 mm ) columns were used .
sodium hydroxide gradient of 0.5 to 30 mm allowed the identification and the quantification of this organic acid in 15 min .
pha content for analysis of intracellular pha the culture broth was centrifuged ( 10,000 x g ; 4degreesc ; 15 min ) and the cell pellet was lyophilized for 48 h. pyrex vials were weighed to determine the exact transferred biomass , then 2 ml of 15 % v v - 1 h2so4 in methanol were added .
furthermore , 2 ml of methylene chloride containing 2 - ethyl - 2 - hydroxybutyrate ( 10 g l - 1 ) were added as internal standard .

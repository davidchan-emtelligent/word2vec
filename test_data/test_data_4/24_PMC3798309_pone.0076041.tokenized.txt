background prediction of disease - specific survival ( dss ) for individual patient with gastric cancer after r0 resection remains a clinical concern .
since the clinicopathologic characteristics of gastric cancer vary widely between china and western countries , this study is to evaluate a nomogram from memorial sloan - kettering cancer center ( mskcc ) for predicting the probability of dss in patients with gastric cancer from a chinese cohort .
methods from 1998 to 2007 , clinical data of 979 patients with gastric cancer who underwent r0 resection were retrospectively collected from peking university cancer hospital & institute and used for external validation .
the performance of the mskcc nomogram in our population was assessed using concordance index ( c - index ) and calibration plot .
results the c - index for the mskcc predictive nomogram was 0.74 in the chinese cohort , compared with 0.69 for american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) staging system ( p < 0.0001 ) .
this suggests that the discriminating value of mskcc nomogram is superior to ajcc staging system for prognostic prediction in the chinese population .
calibration plots showed that the actual survival of chinese patients corresponded closely to the mskcc nonogram - predicted survival probabilities .
moreover , mskcc nomogram predictions demonstrated the heterogeneity of survival in stage iia / iib / iiia / iiib disease of the chinese patients .
conclusion in this study , we externally validated mskcc nomogram for predicting the probability of 5 - and 9 - year dss after r0 resection for gastric cancer in a chinese population .
the mskcc nomogram performed well with good discrimination and calibration .
the mskcc nomogram improved individualized predictions of survival , and may assist chinese clinicians and patients in individual follow - up scheduling , and decision making with regard to various treatment options .

introduction although gastric cancer rates have decreased substantially over the past few decades , the disease remains one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide .
over 70 % of new cases and deaths occur in eastern asia , eastern europe , and south america , including nearly 42 % in china [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
surgery remains the primary curative treatment for gastric cancer without metastasis [ 3 ] , [ 4 ]. with the addition of pre - and postoperative adjuvant therapy , 5 - year survival rate of gastric cancer has been improved up to 30 - 35 % [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
in most institutes , gastric cancer are treated based on the american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) staging groups , including the clinical parameters of pathologic depth of invasion ( t ) , the number of metastatic lymph nodes ( n ) , and distant metastasis ( m ) [ 7 ] .
however , because the patients within the same stage may have different prognosis , it is critical to identify the patients with high risk of relapse and poor outcome .
accordingly , the individualized therapies can be administrated for those patients .
a number of recent studies suggest that the use of the nomogram in predicting the prognosis of malignancies improved decision making in cancer therapy [ 8 ] - [ 12 ] .
the nomogram incorporates multiple clinical parameters into cancer prediction models , permitting a more individualized prediction of outcome , and providing a more accurate prediction than conventional staging or scoring systems [ 8 ] - [ 12 ] .
the nomograms for several types of cancer are available ( http :// www.mskcc.org / cancer - care / prediction - tools ) .
for gastric cancer , although there are several nomograms for predicting individual survival , the nomogram derived from memorial sloan - kettering cancer center ( mskcc ) is the only one available online [ 13 ] - [ 17 ] .
in 2003 , kattan et al. developed a nomogram for predicting the probability of disease - specific survival ( dss ) after r0 resection on the basis of 1039 patients who underwent treatment at mskcc [ 13 ] .
this nomogram has been validated as an accurate prediction tool for dss in the united states , the netherland , and germany [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] .
however , several clinicopathologic characteristics of gastric cancer in eastern countries differ from those in western countries , which include racial diversity , environmental exposures , tumor location , surgical treatment , and adjuvant therapy patients received [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
these differences may cause inaccurate prediction of clinical outcome of eastern patients using the same nomogram model .
for instance , patients from korea appear to have consistently better dss , compared with those from the united states when analyzed with the validated nomogram from mskcc [ 21 ] .
in addition , mskcc nomogram was not accurate in predicting the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients in the turkish population [ 23 ] .
meanwhile , whether the existing mskcc nomogram for dss prediction is suitable for analyzing chinese patients with gastric cancer is largely unknown .
therefore , we evaluated the performance of the nomogram by using a large and independent patient population from peking university cancer hospital & institute .
in this study , we externally validated the mskcc nomogram predicting the probability of 5 - and 9 - year dss after r0 resection for gastric cancer in a chinese patient population .
our results suggest that the mskcc nomogram performed well with good discrimination and calibration in predicting dss probability of chinese patients with gastric cancer .
the prediction of the individual patient prognosis by the mskcc nomogram serves as a reliable strategy to better counsel patients , tailor adjuvant treatment , and schedule follow - up for chinese patients with gastric cancer .
materials and methods ethics statement the retrospective study was approved and supervised by the research ethics committee of peking university cancer hospital & institute ( beijing , china ) .
written informed consents were obtained from all patients prior to being registered in this study .
patients between june 1 , 1998 and march 30 , 2007 , 1065 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent r0 resection at peking university cancer hospital & institute were retrospectively reviewed .
neither neoadjuvant chemotherapy nor radiation therapy was performed prior to surgery for the patients during that period of time .
the extent of resection for gastric cancer was total or subtotal gastrectomy with d2 lymphadenectomy according to the japanese research society for gastric cancer ( jrsgc ) .
a r0 resection was defined as complete resection without microscopic residual tumor .
patients were excluded from the study if final pathology revealed a positive surgical margin or metastatic disease .
clinicopathologic variables patients' data were collected including the following prognostic variables : sex , age of diagnosis , primary location ( antrum or pyloric , middle one third , gastroesophageal junction , and proximal one third ) , lauren histotype ( diffuse , intestinal , mixed ) , tumor size , number of positive lymph nodes resected , number of negative lymph nodes resected , and depth of tumor invasion ( mucosa , submucosa , propria muscularis , subserosa , suspected serosal invasion , definite serosal invasion , and adjacent organ involvement ). of the 1065 patients from our database , 979 patients with complete records were included in the present study , and the rest patients were excluded due to lack of information , death from cause unrelated to gastric cancer , or loss to follow - up. follow - up patients with stage ii or iii gastric cancer routinely received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with a relatively consistent protocol based on fluorouracil and platinum in our hospital & institute .
the regular follow - up program started after patients being discharged from the hospital .
patients were followed - up every 3 - 6 months during the first 2 years , every 6 months until the fifth postoperative year , then once every year thereafter .
follow - up evaluation consisted of physical examination , radiological studies , endoscopic examination , and laboratory examination .
statistical analysis dss was defined as the time from primary surgery to death from gastric cancer or last follow - up , and was estimated using the kaplan - meier method .
univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using the cox proportional hazards regression model .
the 5 - and 9 - year predicted probability of dss was calculated for each patient using the mskcc nomogram application ( http :// nomograms.mskcc.org / gastric / roresection.aspx ) .
the mskcc nomogram was validated with the concordance index ( c - index ) and a calibration plot using the dataset from peking university cancer hospital & institute .
c - index is a probability of concordance between predicted and observed survival , similar to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for censored data .
c - index can range from 0.5 to 1.0 , indicating a random predictions and perfect concordance , respectively .
a z test was used to evaluate the difference between nomogram and staging system concordance indices .
a calibration plot was applied to assess the prediction accuracy of the nomogram by plotting the actual survival against the nomogram - predicted survival probabilities .
all statistical analyses were performed by using the r software with rms package version 3.6 - 3 ( http :// cran.r - project.org / package = rms ) .
a two - sided p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results clinicopathologic characteristics the clinicopathologic characteristics of chinese patients were summarized in table 1 .
the median age at diagnosis was 61 years ( range , 20 to 87 ) .
the percentage of male ( 74.0 %) was higher than that of female ( 26.0 %) in the study cohort .
the last follow - up date is july 17 , 2012 .
the median follow - up period was 48 months ( range , 0 to 137 months ) .
six hundred and two patients died of gastric cancer during this period of time .
as shown in figure 1 , dss by the seventh ajcc tnm stage grouping suggested a sufficient number of patients at risk at both 5 and 9 years to evaluate the mskcc nomogram .

multivariate analysis demonstrated that age of 61 - 68 , tumor at ge junction , large tumor size , high number of positive nodes retrieved , low number of negative nodes retrieved , and deep tumor invasion were significantly associated with poor dss .
however , no significant correlation with dss was found in sex or lauren histotype ( table 2 ) .

evaluation of the mskcc nomogram the performance of the mskcc nomogram in our cohort was evaluated by two methods .
firstly , the c - index was assessed to quantify the discrimination among individual patients in the mskcc nomogram .
the c - index of this model was 0.74 .
secondly , the calibration plots compared the nomogram - predicted probabilities of dss with the observed rate of dss at 5 and 9 years ( figure 2 ) .
the performance of the ideal nomogram was plotted by the dotted line , in which the predicted outcome would perfectly overlap with the actual outcome .
the solid line represents the performance of the mskcc nomogram in predicting dss probability of chinese patients with gastric cancer after r0 resection .
the calibration plots showed that the actual survival corresponded closely to the mskcc nonogram - predicted survival probabilities .
although the mskcc nomogram slightly under - or overestimated the probability of dss in patients who had a low or high probability of the actual dss , respectively , it was within a 10 % margin of the nomogram prediction ( figure 2 ) .

( a ) five - year nomogram , ( b ) nine - year nomogram .
then , we compared the predictive ability of mskcc nomogram with that of the seventh ajcc stage risk grouping .
the mskcc nomogram was found to be quantitatively more discriminative than the seventh ajcc tnm classification ( c - index 0.74 versus 0.69 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
to illustrate the discrepancies between the two predicting methods , figure 3 showed a histogram of nomogram - predicted survival probabilities for each ajcc stage , suggesting the heterogeneity within several of the ajcc stages , particularly stages iia , iib , iiia , and iiib .
when the histograms of the nomogram predicted probabilities are compared , every ajcc stage overlaps with the neighboring ajcc stages .
this suggests that patients of stages iia , iib , iiia , and iiib have far more variable survival than expected according to ajcc stage alone .

to further evaluate the mskcc nomogram in our cohort , patients were grouped into quartiles according to the nomogram - predicted survival ( 1st quartile , < 25 % ; 2nd quartile , 25 - 50 % ; 3rd quartile , 50 - 75 % ; 4th quartile , > 75 %) .
figure 4 showed the observed survival curves for the four risk groups .
the quartiles of nomogram - predicted survival were significantly associated with different observed survival probabilities ( p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , for 5 years , and 9 years , respectively , figure 4 ) .

discussion gastric cancer is the second major cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide .
in china , an estimated 380,000 new cases each year account for more than 40 % of the global annual gastric cancer incidence [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 24 ] .
for patients who underwent r0 resection , ajcc stage is the commonly used system to predict prognosis [ 7 ] .
however , other factors like sex , age of diagnosis , primary tumor location , lauren histotype , and tumor size , which may have impacts on dss , were not taken into account in the ajcc stage grouping .
a nomogram , which combined all proven prognostic factors and quantified risks , was developed by kattan et al , and has been validated to be more accurate for predicting dss rate of gastric cancer in the united states , the netherland , and germany [ 13 ] , [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] , whereas this nomogram has not been evaluated in chinese patients .
thus , we determined the predictive value of the mskcc nomogram for chinese patients with gastric cancer .
our analysis showed that the predictive value of the mskcc nomogram remained accurate in a chinese population of patients with gastric cancer .
in the current study , the validation of the mskcc nomogram was performed by using c - index and calibration plots .
the results showed that the mskcc nomogram predicts the probability of dss in gastric cancer patients with a c - index of 0.74 , which is more accurate than the seventh ajcc staging system ( c - index , 0.69 ) .
the results suggested that the discrimination of patients by nomogram is superior to that of ajcc stage grouping ( p < 0.0001 ) .
in addition , the calibration plots of the mskcc nomogram for the chinese cohort appeared to be accurate for both 5 - and 9 - year prediction .
the chinese and mskcc patients were comparable in the distribution of all clinicopathologic variables .
there are several differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between chinese and mskcc cohort ( table s1 ) .
firstly , a significant majority of patients in the chinese cohort were male , compared with female in the mskcc cohort .
secondly , primary tumor location is commonly seen at antrum or pyloric in the chinese cohort , compared with gastroesophageal junction ( gej ) , which indicates poor survival , in the mskcc cohort .
thirdly , the lauren histotype is different , with high percentage of diffuse type in the chinese cohort , compared with intestine type in the mskcc cohort .
in addition , although the chinese cohort and the mskcc cohort used the 7th and 5th ajcc tnm classification , respectively , chinese patients have the tendency to be diagnosed with more advanced gastric cancer with higher t stage ( depth of tumor invasion ) , and more positive lymph nodes retrieval for r0 resection , compared with the mskcc cohort in kattan 's study [ 13 ] .
moreover , when comparing treatment , chinese patients with stage ii or iii tumor routinely received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy , the patients from mskcc cohort underwent no adjuvant treatment [ 13 ] , [ 19 ] .
despite these discrepancies between the two cohorts , the mskcc nomogram was validated as a more accurate survival predictor than ajcc staging system for chinese patients in our institute .
the improved accuracy of the nomogram prediction is due to the fact that it incorporates many dss - related variables that are not considered in the ajcc classification .
in the study by kattan et al , sex , age of diagnosis , primary tumor location , lauren histotype , and tumor size were included as prognostic factors for the development of mskcc nomogram [ 13 ] .
moreover , for some patients , the changes in prognostic predictions suggest good clinical utility .
regarding the ajcc tnm classification , patients within the same stage would be assigned for the same prognosis .
however , nomogram predictions separated patients within the same stage into different survival prognosis , and allowed better discrimination among patients .
accurate survival predictions by nomogram may assist in individual patient counseling and in follow - up scheduling .
it may also play roles in identifying patients with high risk of poor clinical outcome within known ajcc stages , as well as in selecting patients who may benefit from certain adjuvant treatments .
however , there are limitations of this study .
the mskcc nomogram was externally validated using a retrospective data set from a single chinese institute .
for the generalized use of the mskcc nomogram for chinese patients , validation by other chinese cohorts is required .
moreover , the application of the nomogram depends on several pathologic variables that only available after surgery , i.e. lauren histotype , depth of tumor invasion and number of positive or nodes retrieved .
thus , it is difficult to make a precise assessment of these factors preoperatively .
therefore , the nomogram has limited impact with regard to alternative treatments before surgery , including the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
in conclusion , on the basis of a single chinese cohort database , we externally validated the mskcc nomogram in predicting the probability of 5 - and 9 - year dss after r0 resection for gastric cancer .
the mskcc nomogram performed well with a good discrimination and calibration , which makes it a simple and easy tool to set up an individualized estimation of survival for chinese patients with gastric cancer .
the mskcc model could be useful for clinicians in terms of better counseling patients , tailoring adjuvant treatment , as well as scheduling follow - up. supporting information table s1 comparison of patient clinicopathologic characteristics in the chinese and mskcc cohort .

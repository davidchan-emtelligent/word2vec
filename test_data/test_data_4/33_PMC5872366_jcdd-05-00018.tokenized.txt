the popeye domain containing ( popdc ) genes encode transmembrane proteins , which are abundantly expressed in striated muscle cells .
hallmarks of the popdc proteins are the presence of three transmembrane domains and the popeye domain , which makes up a large part of the cytoplasmic portion of the protein and functions as a camp - binding domain .
interestingly , despite the prediction of structural similarity between the popeye domain and other camp binding domains , at the protein sequence level they strongly differ from each other suggesting an independent evolutionary origin of popdc proteins .
loss - of - function experiments in zebrafish and mouse established an important role of popdc proteins for cardiac conduction and heart rate adaptation after stress .
loss - of function mutations in patients have been associated with limb - girdle muscular dystrophy and av - block .
these data suggest an important role of these proteins in the maintenance of structure and function of striated muscle cells .
popeye domain camp binding effector protein cardiac arrhythmia limb - girdle muscular dystrophy atrioventricular block 1 .
introduction the second messenger cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate ( camp ) activates an evolutionary ancient and universally important intracellular signaling pathway .
several effector proteins have been identified , which bind camp with high affinity causing their activation and leading to the execution of a variety of biological activities ( figure 1 ) .
the most important and prominent camp effector protein is protein kinase a ( pka ) , which upon binding of up to four camp molecules to the regulatory subunit causes an activation of the catalytic subunits leading to the phosphorylation of many protein substrates .
it is estimated that around 350 proteins are phosphorylated in response to beta1 - adrenergic stimulation , many of which are targeted by pka [ 1 ] .
pka protein substrates are diverse but include proteins regulating energy metabolism , cardiac pacemaking and excitation / contraction coupling .
pka is bound by a number of scaffolding proteins called a kinase anchoring proteins ( akaps ) [ 2 ] .
in cardiac myocytes , several akaps are expressed including d - akap1 , d - akap2 , akap15 / 18 , akap79 / 150 , yotiao , makapbeta , akap - lbc , gravin and skip [ 3 ] .
akaps are responsible to target pka to specific subcellular domains such as the plasma membrane , transverse ( t ) - tubules , sarcoplasmatic reticulum , myofilaments and nuclear envelope [ 2 ] .
akap proteins not only bind pka but also protein substrates and other signaling molecules [ 2 ] .
recent data suggest that at physiological camp concentrations , dissociation of the pka holoenzyme does not occur [ 4 ] .
pka being bound by different akaps in the cell is therefore only able to phosphorylate substrates in its direct vicinity , which enhances specificity and compartmentation of the cellular response .
epac ( exchange factor directly activated by camp ) is a guanine - nucleotide exchange factors for the ras - like gtpases , rap1 and rap2 [ 5 ] .
two epac isoforms , epac1 and epac2 exist in mammals and are thought to modulate ca2 + - homeostasis and hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes [ 6 ] .
interestingly , epac1 and epac2 differ regarding their subcellular localization .
epac2 is mostly present at the t - tubules and epac1 is localized perinuclear [ 7,8 ] .
epac1 is also present in mitochondria and loss of epac1 reduces infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by myocardial ischemia / reperfusion injury [ 9 ] .
epac also has pro - arrhythmic effects probably due its ability to decrease potassium currents [ 10 ] .
chronic epac activation leads to cardiac hypertrophy [ 11 ] .
another important effector protein in cardiac myocytes is hcn4 , which is a member of the family of hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels ( hcn ) .
hcn genes encode nonselective voltage - gated cation channels , which are abundantly expressed in cardiac pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial ( san ) and atrioventricular nodes ( avn ) but are also present in parts of the ventricular conduction system [ 12 ] .
upon binding of camp , the hcn4 channel opens more rapidly and completely [ 13 ] .
this property has led to the assumption that the camp - mediated enhancement of hcn channel activity is largely responsible for the increase in heart rate in response to beta - adrenergic stimulation .
however , the importance of hcn4 in cardiac pacemaking remains controversial [ 14,15 ] .
heart rate adaptation in response to adrenergic stimulation remains intact after san - specific ablation of the hcn4 locus in mice [ 16 ] .
moreover , heart rate acceleration in response to adrenergic signaling is unaffected in patients carrying a camp - binding site mutation in hcn4 [ 17 ] .
to accommodate these facts , it has been proposed that hcn4 may act as a depolarization reserve and its main role may be to counteract parasympathetic slowing of the heart rate [ 18,19 ] .
in addition to its importance in cardiac pacemaking , hcn channels apparently also have a role in impulse propagation in the san and are also essential for ventricular repolarization [ 20,21 ] .
importantly , in cardiac hypertrophy , both hcn2 and hcn4 are induced in the ventricular working myocardium causing a prolongation of the cardiac action potential and probably being responsible for the development of cardiac arrhythmia in the hypertrophied ventricle [ 22 ] .
although the popeye domain containing genes were isolated around the same time as epac genes [ 23,24,25,26 ] , it took more than a decade to realize that popdc proteins constitute a novel class of camp - effector proteins [ 27 ] and an additional four years to demonstrate that camp binding is essential for its function [ 28 ] .
here we will review the multiple roles of the popdc gene family in striated muscle biology and disease .
2. the popeye gene family the popdc gene family consists of three genes namely popdc1 ( also known as bves ) , popdc2 and popdc3 .
in vertebrates , popdc1 and popdc3 are tandem - organized and in the human genome are present on chromosome 6q21 , while popdc2 is located on chromosome 3q13.33 .
[ 26 ] .
popdc1 is the most complex gene with 8 exons , while popdc2 and popdc3 have only 4 exons .
popdc1 probably represent the ancestral gene and the other two paralogs were generated through two gene duplication events .
the first duplication likely took place at the base of chordate evolution [ 29 ] .
in support of this view , basic chordates ( tunicates , cephalochordates ) have two tandem - organized popdc genes with homologies to popdc1 and popdc3 .
popdc2 , which is only found in vertebrates , was probably generated by a second gene duplication event , which probably took place at the base of vertebrate evolution .
this view is supported by the fact that popdc2 is only present in vertebrates .
moreover , popdc2 and popdc3 display a similar gene structure and higher similarity at the protein level [ 30 ] .
the popdc gene family also evolved independently in invertebrates , where gene duplication events also took place .
while molluscs , annelids and dipterans such as drosophila have only a single popdc gene ; many insects have two popdc genes and some invertebrates ( for example the water flea ) have multiple popdc genes .
interestingly , there are also invertebrate species , which lost their popdc gene during evolution and a prominent example for this is caenorhabditis elegans .
thus , for some species , a lack of popdc genes is fully compatible with life .
we can trace the presence of popdc genes down to hydra and the gene family is also found in some protozoan species .
we can therefore conclude that popdc genes have evolved at the base of the animal kingdom .
no popdc genes are found in plants or fungi .
interestingly , the camp - binding domain ( cnbd ) of the bacterial catabolite activator proteins ( cap ) , also known as catabolite receptor protein ( crp ) , which are involved in transcriptional regulation of metabolism display the highest similarity of a non - popdc protein to the popeye domain .
3. popdc proteins the popdc proteins are medium - sized transmembrane proteins .
they consist of a short extracellular domain ( ecd , figure 2 ) , which in case of popdc1 has been shown to be subject to n - glycosylation .
potentially , n - glycosylation is more extensive in skeletal muscle and brain than in the heart [ 31,32 ] .
a consensus sequence for n - glycosylation is also present in the ecd of popdc2 and popdc3 .
popdc proteins all have three transmembrane domains .
in the cytoplasmic part , the conserved popeye domain is present , which functions as a camp - binding domain [ 27 ] .
the popeye domain is slightly larger than a typical cyclic nucleotide monophosphate ( cnmp ) - binding domain ( cnbd ) , suggesting that additional functions other than camp - binding reside in the popeye domain .
indeed , the binding sites of kcnk2 ( trek - 1 ) or cav3 have been mapped to the popeye domain of popdc1 [ 28,33 ] ( figure 2 ) .
soon after its discovery , the dimerization of popdc1 was first described [ 31,32 ] .
dimerization is stabilized through disulfide bridge formation .
in order to map the sequences , which mediate dimerization , a series of experiments including carboxy - terminal deletions , peptide - mapping and site - directed mutagenesis was utilized [ 34 ] .
dimerization appeared to depend on two conserved lysine residues at the end of the popeye domain .
mutation of the dimerization motif interfered with cell adhesion , and epithelia formation .
there are probably other sequences in popdc1 also responsible for dimerization as popdc1 protein , which lacked these sequences , were still able to homodimerize [ 37 ] .
4. the popeye domain is a novel camp - binding domain it is thought that the main function of the 150 amino acids long popeye domain is to bind camp [ 27 ] .
the structural prediction of the popeye domain revealed a similarity to the cnbd of the catalytic subunit of pka [ 27 ] .
the structure of the cnbd is categorized as jelly - roll beta - barrel fold , which is found in many proteins .
however , not all of these proteins bind cyclic nucleotides but other ligands [ 38 ] .
a conserved feature of the cnbd is the phosphate - binding cassette ( pbc ) , which directly makes contact to camp and consists of a short alpha - helix and a loop located between beta - sheets 6 and 7 .
two conserved residues found in all pbcs include an arginine , which binds to the phosphate group of camp and a glutamate that binds the 2 ' - oh group of the ribose [ 39 ] .
those proteins that share the jelly - roll beta - barrel fold structure but lack these arginine and glutamate residues , bind to ligands other than cnmps .
it is , therefore , essential that sufficient experimental evidence will be generated that it is unequivocally established that popdc proteins bind camp despite their lack of a canonical pbc .
the non - canonical pbc of the popeye domain is thought to consist of two conserved sequence motifs ( fl / idspew / f ) and fqvt / s ) , which are linked by a non - conserved sequence of variable length [ 27 ] ( figure 3 ) .
several of these evolutionary conserved residues were mutagenized by a charge - to - alanine strategy in popdc1 and popdc2 and as expected , the resulting mutant proteins displayed a reduction in the camp - binding affinity supporting their involvement in nucleotide - binding [ 27 ] .
assays were developed to demonstrate camp - binding by popdc proteins .
the first one , is a camp agarose precipitation assay , which established camp - binding of native popdc1 protein extracted from the chicken heart [ 27 ] .
popdc1 was also precipitated by cgmp agarose and free cgmp was able to elute popdc1 from camp agarose and thus , at this stage it was unclear , whether popdc1 binds camp selectively , or both cyclic nucleotides with equal affinity .
the agarose - precipitation assay also established that the three popdc proteins are all able to bind camp [ 27 ] .
a recombinant popdc1 protein encompassing the cytoplasmic part of the protein was employed in a competitive radio - ligand binding assay , which established an ic50 concentration of 118.4 +/ - 7.1 nm for camp and of 5.27 +/ - 0.68 mum for cgmp [ 27 ] .
the approximately 40 - fold difference in affinity between camp and cgmp is typical for a camp - binding protein and similar differences in affinities for both nucleotides have been described for the cnbds of pka [ 40 ] .
a third assay demonstrating camp binding was developed based on the interaction of popdc1 with the two - pore potassium channel kcnk2 ( trek - 1 ) [ 27 ] .
a bimolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) assay using cfp - tagged popdc1 and yfp - tagged trek - 1 was utilized .
addition of the beta - adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin caused a rapid decline of the yfp / cfp ratio with a kinetic , typical for an adenylate cyclase - dependent process [ 27 ] .
a mutant protein , carrying a mutation in d200 , which is one of the residues of the dspe motif in the pbc of popdc1 ( figure 3 ) , did not cause any changes in the fret signal after the addition of isoproterenol .
likewise , nitroprussid , which raises cgmp levels in cells , did not affect the fret signal , which supports the notion that at physiological concentration levels , popdc1 protein binds camp but not cgmp .
finally , evidence for camp - binding of popdc proteins stems from the discovery of a popdc1s201f mutation , which is present in patients , which develop a limb - girdle muscular dystrophy ( lgmd ) phenotype [ 28 ] .
the serine residue 201 of popdc1 is part of the pbc and change of serine into phenylalanine is likely to reduce the camp - binding affinity .
indeed , measurements of camp affinity established a loss of about 50 % in case of the mutant protein [ 28 ] .
thus , there is ample of experimental and genetic evidence , which establishes the popeye domain as a novel camp - binding domain with a highly divergent protein sequence [ 28 ] .
however , so far , the molecular characterization mostly dealt with popdc1 protein and therefore it will be important to extend these experiments also to the other two family members and to determine , whether cyclic nucleotide specificity is the same for each of the popdc proteins , and whether all three popdc isoforms bind camp with equal affinity .
5. expression pattern of popdc genes rna expression data for the popdc family members revealed the highest expression level of popdc genes in striated muscle tissue ( figure 4 ) [ 26 ] .
while popdc2 is preferentially expressed in the heart , popdc1 and popdc3 show higher expression levels in skeletal muscle. of the three genes , popdc1 shows a more widespread expression than popdc2 and popdc3 .
in many tissues , popdc1 and at least one other popdc gene is co - expressed .
apart from striated muscle , expression was also observed in smooth muscle cells , neurons , and epithelial cells [ 41 ] .
conflicting data have been published for the heart regarding the presence of popdc1 in non - muscle cell types of the heart .
several studies from my lab revealed an exclusive expression in cardiac myocytes [ 41,42,43 ] , while another group reported expression in cardiac myocytes but also presence of popdc1 in the epicardium and in coronary arteries [ 25,44,45 ] .
the lacz reporter gene , which was knocked into popdc1 did not reveal a significant expression in any of the non - muscle cell lineages in the adult heart [ 26,41 ] .
however , a shortcoming of these data is the fact that the lacz reporter gene may not fully recapitulate the expression domains of the endogenous gene .
on the other end , it is equally conceivable that the antibodies employed may be cross - reactive .
a thorough investigation of the expression patterns of popdc genes and proteins in vertebrate embryos and in the adult seems to be required to settle this case .
immunolocalization of popdc proteins revealed an expression at the plasma membrane of isolated cardiac myocytes and a similar pattern was observed in cardiac tissues .
popdc proteins have been described to be present at the lateral membrane , intercalated disks , costameres [ 33 ] , t - tubules and caveolae [ 33 ] ( figure 5 ) .
in addition , popdc1 was also localized to the nuclear envelope [ 49 ] , and in the nucleoplasm [ 50 ] .
plasma membrane localization was also reported for skeletal muscle , however no detailed analysis of the subcellular localization in different membrane compartments has been reported [ 28 ] .
a recent report , which was looking for novel intercalated disk proteins described a preferential localization of popdc2 in the intercalated disk of ventricular myocytes of the human and canine heart , arguing for an important function of popdc2 for electrical cell - to - cell coupling , and impulse propagation [ 51 ] .
6. animal models to define the function popdc genes in order to define the function of popdc genes , the popdc1 and popdc2 genes were ablated in mice by substituting the first coding exon with a lacz reporter gene [ 27,52 ] ( table 1 ) .
the resulting homozygous mutants were viable and no embryonic lethality has been reported .
phenotype analysis was guided by the lacz expression pattern [ 41 ] .
in the adult mouse heart , popdc1 and popdc2 are expressed in cardiac myocytes , while no expression in smooth muscle or non - muscle cells is observed [ 27,41 ] .
popdc1 displays higher level of expression in atria than in ventricles , while popdc2 is evenly expressed in both chamber types [ 27 ] .
both genes display a strong expression in the sinoatrial ( san ) and atrioventricular nodes ( avn ) as well as in the ventricular conduction system [ 27 ] .
the high - level expression of popdc1 and 2 genes in the cardiac conduction system prompted the investigation of the functional status of it in the null mutant animals .
while both popdc1 and popdc2 null mutants displayed normal heart rhythm at rest , a stress - induced sinus bradycardia developed in response to physical or emotional stress and after beta - adrenergic receptor stimulation [ 27 ] .
ecg analysis revealed the presence of stress - induced sinus pauses .
the length of each sinus pause was variable and could be brief or more prolonged .
interestingly , the arrhythmia phenotype developed in both null mutants in an age - dependent manner and was absent in young adults and gradually worsened with increasing age [ 27 ] .
the phenotype was also present in isolated langendorff - perfused hearts and a normal cholinergic response was observed after carbachol treatment , which suggests a primary defect in the cardiac pacemaker .
structural analysis of the sinoatrial node ( san ) morphology revealed significant structural alterations .
the san is located at the border between vena cava and right atrium and consists of nodal myocytes , which also called spider and spindle cells due to their irregular shape and the long neurite - like cellular extensions [ 56 ] .
nodal myocytes are embedded in a rich extracellular matrix and are poorly electrically coupled .
in both , popdc1 and popdc2 null mutants , pacemaker cells displayed a reduced number of cellular extensions , and overall the san had a more compact structure .
moreover , a reduction of nodal myocardium was noted in the inferior part of the san [ 27 ] .
the molecular basis of the sinus node dysfunction in popdc1 and popdc2 null mutants is not well understood .
an attractive hypothesis involves a modulatory role of popdc proteins for the pacemaker current if. therefore , if current density and activation time was measured in isolated san myocytes from wt and popdc2 null mutant mice [ 27 ] .
cells of both genotypes were indistinguishable in current density under basal conditions and after superfusion with 8 - br - camp .
while if was not investigated in the popdc1 null mutant , therefore an interaction of popdc1 and hcn4 cannot be excluded , however , the similarity of phenotypes of both popdc1 and popdc2 null mutants makes it very unlikely that if function is modulated by popdc1 .
one of the first popdc - interacting protein identified in the heart was the potassium channel twik - related k + channel 1 ( trek - 1 ) or kcnk2 [ 27 ] .
this ion channel is a member of the two - pore domain potassium channel ( k2p ) family .
trek - 1 gating is affected by a large number of stimuli including stretch , ph , temperature , phosphorylation , and is also modulated through the interaction with other proteins [ 57 ] .
in the presence of popdc1 , trek - 1 produces a twofold higher current in xenopus oocytes [ 27 ] .
the effect is also observed when popdc2 or popdc3 were co - expressed .
the doubling of trek - 1 current is probably due to an increase in membrane trafficking as more trek - 1 protein is detected at the cell surface when popdc proteins are present .
the effect of popdc proteins on trek - 1 is sensitive to camp and is lost when camp levels were increased after applying the general pde inhibitor theophylline or 8 - br - camp [ 27,28 ] .
the interaction of popdc proteins with trek - 1 has been mapped to the popeye domain by deletion analysis ( figure 2 ) .
based on the interaction of popdc1 and trek - 1 , a bi - molecular forster - resonance energy transfer ( fret ) sensor was constructed .
the fret ratio obtained at baseline decreased after the addition of isoproterenol or forskolin , suggesting that cyclic nucleotide - binding affects the interaction of popdc1 with trek - 1 [ 27 ] .
a cardiac specific knockout of kcnk2 , which encodes trek - 1 , displays a stress - induced sinus bradycardia similar to the one observed in popdc1 and popdc2 null mutants [ 58 ] , suggesting that the sinus bradycardia in popdc mutants may in part be due to an impaired trek - 1 current .
however , it is likely that additional proteins may be involved .
cardiac pacemaking is governed by two oscillatory mechanisms , the membrane clock and the ca2 + - clock [ 59 ] .
the membrane clock initiates depolarization in response to if but also involves the voltage - gated ca2 + - channels .
the ca2 + - clock on the other hand is active in late diastole when ca2 + is released from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum by the ryanodine receptors ( ryrs ) and exchanged for na + by ncx , which generates a depolarizing incx current .
both clocks are coupled by ca2 + , which enters the cell through the l - type ca2 + channels , which leads to a replenishment of the sr allowing the next pacemaker cycle to be initiated .
interestingly , it was recently reported that the sodium calcium exchanger ncx1 is a popdc2 - interacting protein [ 60 ] and the loss of ncx1 causes san dysfunction similar to the one observed in popdc mutants [ 61 ] .
it seems warranted to thoroughly investigate protein - protein interaction , subcellular localization , and function of proteins of the membrane and ca2 + clocks in the different popdc mutants .
the impact of ischemia / reperfusion injury was studied in the popdc1 null mutant [ 33 ] .
langendorff - perfused mutant hearts displayed a significantly lower functional recovery , while infarct size was larger .
isolated cardiac myocytes from popdc1 null mutants displayed altered ca2 + - transients and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress .
apparently popdc1 is involved in myocyte survival through the suppression of the pro - apoptotic bcl2 interacting protein 3 ( bnip3 ) gene [ 62 ] .
while skeletal muscle is not as well studied than cardiac muscle in popdc null mutants , it has been shown that muscle regeneration is impaired in popdc1 null mutants , however , the underlying molecular mechanism has yet to be elucidated [ 63 ] .
in popdc1 null mutant mice , the caveolar compartment is affected and caveolae were fewer in number , however their size was increased [ 33 ] .
popdc1 interacts with cav3 through a consensus sequence present at the end of the popeye domain ( figure 2 ) .
this could have profound effects on cardiac signal transduction given that caveolae in cardiac myocytes are clustering membrane receptors , signaling molecules , protein pumps and ion channels [ 64 ] .
it has been reported that popdc2 in human and canine cardiac myocytes are predominantly present at the intercalated disk [ 51 ] .
the intercalated disk controls electrical coupling between cardiac myocytes and therefore is a major determinant of cardiac conduction .
it will be interesting to study the structure and function of the intercalated disk in popdc2 null mutants and to measure electrical conduction in popdc2 null mutants .
loss - of function experiments were also conducted in zebrafish and morpholino - mediated knockdown of popdc1 and popdc2 caused cardiac arrhythmia and muscular dystrophy phenotypes [ 28,53 ] ( table 1 ) .
the cardiac arrhythmia was already present in the embryo and the severity of the phenotype increased in an age - dependent manner .
in young larvae ( 4 days post - fertilization , dpf ) typically a type i av - block was present .
at increasing age total heart block or even non - contracting hearts were also observed .
the skeletal muscle phenotype in popdc1 and popdc2 morphants was characterized by an impaired formation of the myotendinous junction which probably caused the myofiber rupture , which was seen in both morphants [ 28,53 ] .
the heart of many popdc1 and popdc2 morphants displayed a pericardial effusion , which is thought to indicate myocardial pumping deficiency .
however , in the case of popdc1 morphants , the pericardial effusion could also be based on a defective barrier formation of the skin due to impaired tight junction formation [ 65 ] .
the molecular basis for the tight junction defect is probably due to abnormal accumulation of tight junction proteins , which is caused by an aberrant localization of atypical protein kinase c ( apkc ) [ 65 ] .
interestingly , it has been demonstrated that another protein involved in cell contact formation , zonula occludens 1 ( zo1 ) is a popdc1 - interacting protein [ 66 ] .
the contact structures between skeletal muscle fibers in the zebrafish tail musculature is formed by the myoseptum or myotendinous junction ( mtj ) [ 67 ] .
the mtj is a complex structure , which is established by several plasma membrane proteins and various matrix proteins [ 68,69 ] .
in the popdc1 and popdc2 morphants and in the popdc1s191f mutant , the mtj is abnormal in structure and in the popdc1s191f mutant lacks the collagen matrix , which probably is essential for the mtj to withstand the tensile forces of the contracting myofibers .
consistent with this hypothesis , large numbers of hypercontracted myofibers that lost contact to the mtj are seen in popdc1 and popdc2 morphants and the popdc1s191f mutant [ 28,53 ] .
7. evidence for a role of popdc genes in human heart and skeletal muscle the first mutation of popdc1 discovered in patients is the recessive popdc1s201f mutation , which was reported to be associated with cardiac arrhythmia and muscular dystrophy [ 28 ] .
this mutation alters serine 201 , which is one of the invariant amino acids present in the putative camp binding domain ( dspe motif ) ( figure 2 , table 1 ) .
the serine residue is substituted by phenylalanine , which may interfere with the cyclic nucleotide gaining access to the pbc .
measurement of the camp binding affinity revealed a 50 % reduction in case of the mutant protein [ 28 ] .
moreover , the s201f mutant caused an increased level of trek - 1 current compared to wildtype ( wt ) while membrane transport of the channel protein was decreased [ 28 ] .
this paradoxical finding of decreased membrane transport and increased current may be explained on the basis that popdc1 in a complex with trek - 1 protein might be protected from getting inactivated by pka - dependent phosphorylation [ 70 ] .
forced expression of popdc1s201f in hl1 cells affected the action potential [ 28 ] .
three patients from a 3 - generation family of albanian descent carried the popdcs201f mutation to homozygosity and developed an early onset second - degree av - block and a late onset limb - girdle muscular dystrophy ( lgmd2x , omim : # 61812 ) [ 28 ] .
serum creatine kinase levels were elevated , and muscle biopsies showed dystrophic changes with increased fiber size variability , increased central nuclei , and a few necrotic fibers .
electron microscopic analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies of one of the patients carrying a popdc1s201f mutation revealed the presence of membrane discontinuities [ 28 ] .
similar discontinuities have been observed in patients with mutations in anoctamine - 5 ( ano5 ) .
while only found in a single patient , these discontinuities are possibly an indication for impaired repair of the muscle plasma membrane [ 71 ] .
interestingly , another protein involved in membrane repair , dysferlin , has also been shown to be an interaction partner of popdc1 [ 28 ] .
expression of the popdc1 disease - associated mutation ( s191f ) in zebrafish caused similar phenotypes as in the patients .
skeletal muscle from homozygous popdc1s191f mutants showed myofibrillar misalignment , aberrant formation of the myotendinous junction , myofiber detachment , and decreased membrane localization of popdc1 and popdc2 [ 28 ] .
electron microscopy revealed an absence of extracellular matrix at the myotendinous junction .
abnormalities of the zebrafish popdc1s191 mutant heart also resembled the patient 's phenotype displaying an overall reduction in heart rate and stroke volume .
isoproterenol caused an increase in the number of embryos displaying a 2:1 av block .
recently , another recessive mutation in popdc1 was reported in a consanguineous family of algerian origin [ 54 ] .
the splice site mutation ( c.816 + 2t > c ) affects the splice donor site in intron 8 and may cause skipping of exon 8 resulting in a mutant protein with a predicted loss of 56 amino acids ( popdc1del56 v217 - k272 ) , ( figure 2 , table 1 ) .
two siblings are affected , and both displayed a first - degree atrioventricular ( av ) - block , high serum creatine kinase levels and evidence for a mild limb - girdle muscular dystrophy .
immunostaining of biopsies revealed a strong reduction in membrane staining of both , the mutant popdc1 protein and also of popdc2 .
thus , despite popdc1s201f and popdc1del56 v217 - k272 mutations are at different position in the protein they induce a similar pathology and display impaired membrane trafficking [ 28,54 ] .
the underlying molecular defects require further characterization .
popdc1 may also contribute to phenotype variability in other lgmds .
interestingly , heterozygous popdc1 mutations were found in patients that also carried lamin a ( lmna ) or dysferlin ( dysf ) mutations .
this putative genetic interaction is probably of significance as both proteins , dysferlin and lamin a also interact at the protein level with popdc1 .
patients carrying a recessive popdc2 mutation were recently discovered [ 55 ] .
this mutation ( c.563g > a , p.trp188stop , popdcw188x ) resulted in the insertion of a premature stop codon at position 188 of popdc2 , leading in the protein to a deletion within the putative camp binding domain .
even though the fqvt motif of the pbc of popdc2 was deleted in this mutant , camp responsiveness remained unaltered .
likewise , the interaction and modulation of the trek - 1 current remained unaltered .
therefore , currently the pathogenic mechanism is not fully clear .
the deletion of part of the popeye domain and the carboxyterminal domain may influence the kinetics of camp binding or could interfere with protein - protein interaction .
8. conclusions we recently proposed four working models of how popdc proteins might modulate proteins in order to mediate camp signaling in striated muscle cells [ 68 ] .
the first model , which is called the switch model , proposes that binding of camp to popdc proteins causes an allosteric effect as it was observed for pka , epac and hcn4 [ 72 ] .
the switch model assumes that allostery not only affects popdc proteins but also interacting proteins .
direct evidence for such a behavior is currently missing .
nonetheless , the trek - 1 - popdc1 fret assay gives support for the presence of an allosteric effect .
experimental support is present for the cargo model , which proposes that popdc acts on proteins by modulating their membrane trafficking .
strong support for this model comes from the observation that the popdc1s201f mutant not only affects membrane localization of the mutant protein but also of popdc2 .
similarly , membrane localization of trek - 1 in xenopus oocytes is modulated by popdc1 and is camp - sensitive .
the shielding model is a variation of the switch model taking into account that popdc proteins and also some of the interacting proteins are getting phosphorylated in response to betaar activation [ 1 ] .
it can be envisioned that camp binding and phosphorylation of popdc proteins may lead to conformational changes that may also affect access of pka or other kinases to their substrates .
finally , the sponge model takes into account that popdc proteins are abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and display a complex subcellular localization .
popdc proteins have a high affinity binding site for camp , which suggests that these proteins may have a strong impact on camp compartmentalization .

2007 8 63 73 10.1038 / nrm2082 17183361 figure 1 four camp effector proteins are expressed in the heart .
norepinephrine ( ne ) secreted by sympathetic neurons binds to the beta - adrenergic receptor leading to gs activation and synthesis of camp by adenylate cyclase ( ac ) .
acetylcholine ( ach ) is secreted by parasympathetic neurons and binds to muscarinergic ach receptors leading to an activation of gi causing ac inhibition .
the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input therefore determines the level of camp production .
camp production in cells is compartmentalized and this is mainly achieved by phoshodiesterases ( pde ) , which limits camp diffusion through degradation .
four effector proteins sense camp levels .
the best - characterized effector protein is protein kinase a ( pka ) , which plays a role in cardiac pacemaking , excitation / contraction coupling and cardiac metabolism .
the exchange factor directly activated by camp ( epac ) has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy , ca2 + - signaling and apoptosis .
often , pka and epac are bound by the same anchor protein ( akap ) along with protein substrates and other enzymes .
the hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( hcn ) channels are important for cardiac pacemaking and ventricular repolarization .
finally , the popeye domain containing ( popdc ) proteins are the most recently identified class of effector proteins and important for cardiac pacemaking , the survival of cardiac myocytes after ischemia / reperfusion and membrane trafficking .
figure 2 structure of the popeye domain containing proteins .
( a ) schematic structure of the human popdc isoforms .
the three popdc proteins share a similar protein structure .
in each case a 20 - 40 amino acid long extracellular domain ( ecd ) , which harbors one or two n - glycosylation sites ( asterisks ) is followed by three transmembrane ( tm ) domains ( i - iii , black boxes ) .
the cytoplasmic portion of the popdc proteins consists of the popeye domain ( red box ) and the carboxyterminal domain ( ctd , yellow box ) .
the phosphate - binding cassette ( pbc ) , which is thought to bind camp , consists of the two tetrapeptides dspe and fqvt .
in case of popdc1 , the locations for the kcnk2 ( trek - 1 ) [ 28 ] and cav3 [ 33 ] binding sites and the putative dimerization motif [ 34 ] are indicated ( blue bars ) .
popdc2 generates three alternative splice products , which differ in their carboxy - terminus labeled by a grey box .
mutations in popdc1 and popdc2 , which have been identified in patients with muscle and heart disease are indicated above each protein model .
( b ) 3 - d structure of popdc3 .
a homology - based structural model was generated with the help of the phyre 2 algorithm [ 35 ] .
the resulting structure was visualized with the help of first glance in jmol [ 36 ] .
figure 3 structure of the popeye domain .
a homology - based structural model of human popdc1 was generated .
a space - filling model of camp was placed in the putative phosphate - binding cassette .
the dspe and fqvt motifs , depicted as yellow halos , surround the camp molecule and as mutagenesis studies suggest , seem to be directly involved in camp - binding .
figure 4 expression of popdc genes in the human body .
rna seq data of popdc1 , popdc2 and popdc3 in human tissue .
rna expression is quantified as reads per kilogram per million mapped reads ( rpkm ) .
data were copied from the human protein atlas website [ 46,47,48 ] .

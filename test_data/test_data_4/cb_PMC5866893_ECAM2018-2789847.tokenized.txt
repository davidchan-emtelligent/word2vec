diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain ( dpnp ) is a common and intractable complication of diabetes .
conventional therapies are always not ideal ; development of novel drugs is still needed to achieve better pain relief .
recent evidences have demonstrated that inflammation is involved in the onset and maintenance of dpnp .
the anti - inflammatory property of tanshinone iia ( tiia ) makes it a promising candidate to block or alter the pain perception .
this study was conducted to investigate whether tiia could attenuate dpnp in streptozotocin - ( stz - ) induced rats model and its potential mechanisms .
tiia was administered to stz - induced diabetic rats at the dose of 40 mg / kg once a day for 3 weeks .
the effects of tiia on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were investigated using behavioral tests .
the mrna level and expression of interleukin - ( il - ) 1beta , interleukin - ( il - ) 6 , tumor necrosis factor - ( tnf - ) alpha , and interleukin - ( il - ) 10 in the fourth to sixth segments of the dorsal root ganglion ( l4 - 6 drg ) were detected by quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) and western blot .
tiia treatment significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in diabetic rats .
in addition , the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha was inhibited , and the level of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 was increased by tiia .
this study demonstrated that tiia has significant antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects in a rat model of stz - induced dpnp , and the effect may be associated with its anti - inflammation property .

introduction the prevalence of dpnp ranges from 20 % to 24 % in patients with diabetes and from 40 % to 50 % in those with diabetic neuropathies [ 1 , 2 ] .
dpnp is characterized by spontaneous pain , hyperalgesia , and allodynia , some of which even progressed to hypoalgesia at advanced stage , which often leads to sleep disorder and depression and passively affects patients' health - related quality of life [ 3 ] .
in addition to the negative impact on individuals , it also leads to heavy social and economic burden [ 4 ] .
the mechanism underlining dpnp is still unclear .
the existing treatment for dpnp is mainly focusing on glycemic control and lifestyle changes .
currently available drugs such as antidepressants , sodium and calcium channel blockers , and opioids are often ineffective and complicated by adverse events [ 5 ] .
therefore , it is imperative to search effective agents for the distressing complication of diabetes .
salvia miltiorrhiza bunge ( danshen in chinese ) is one of the most famous chinese traditional herbs with more than 1000 years of clinical applications [ 6 ] .
the biological activities of danshen have been widely investigated , and more than 100 pure compounds have been isolated from it , which are classified as hydrophilic phenolics and lipophilic quinines [ 6 ] .
tiia is one of the major diterpenoids derived from danshen , which exhibited diverse pharmacological activities , such as antioxidative [ 7 ] , anti - inflammation [ 8 ] , and anticancer [ 6 , 9 ] .
tiia has been widely used for the treatment of a variety of diseases , including atherosclerosis [ 10 ] , cerebral infarction [ 11 ] , and spinal cord injury [ 12 ] .
in diabetic animal models , tiia not only protects against diabetic nephropathy [ 13 ] , but also has protective effects on impaired motor and sensory nerve functions in diabetic neuropathy [ 14 ] .
previous studies have shown that tiia has significant antinociceptive effects in a complete freund 's adjuvant - ( cfa - ) induced inflammation pain model as well as in bone cancer pain model through suppression of the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes [ 15 , 16 ] .
however , it remains unclear whether tiia exerts antinociceptive effects in a stz - induced dpnp model .
therefore , the present study was designed to explore the therapeutic action of tiia in a rat model of dpnp .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animals a total of 40 male sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats were purchased from vital river company ( beijing , china ) , weighing between 200 and 220 g , which were allocated into 3 groups .
the animals were housed in the spf room under controlled laboratory conditions ( temperature , 23 +/ - 2degreesc ; relative humidity , 40 - 60 % , 12 h light / dark cycle ) and allowed free access to food and water .
all experiments were carried out between 09:00 and 17:00 h. due to polyuria , animal bedding was changed daily .
the animal study was approved by the institutional animal ethics committee of the institute of clinical medicine of china - japan friendship hospital .
as some suffering might result from the experiments , the international association for the study of pain ( iasp ) committee for research and ethical issues guidelines were followed [ 17 ] .
2.2 .
drugs and reagents tanshinone iia ( purity > 99 %) was obtained from chengdu de stewart biological technology co. , ltd .
( sichuan , china ) .
streptozotocin ( stz ) was purchased from sigma ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the following primary antibodies ( abcam , ma , uk ) were used in the western blotting analyses : tnf - alpha ( ab6671 ) , il - 1beta ( ab2105 ) , il - 6 ( ab9324 ) , and il - 10 ( ab33471 ) ; antibody against beta - actin ( sc - 47778 ) was purchased from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca , usa ) .
enhanced chemiluminescence ( ecl ) detection reagents were obtained from huaxingbio centre of biotechnology ( beijing , china ) ; bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) protein assay kits and ripa lysis buffer were obtained from beyotime institute of biotechnology ( haimen , china ) .
2.3 .
experimental protocol after one week of adaptation , the diabetes was induced in overnight fasted animals by a single intraperitoneal injection of stz ( 60 mg / kg , freshly prepared in 0.1 mol / l citrate buffer , ph 4.5 ) .
age and body weight matched control rats were injected with the equal amount of vehicle ( 0.1 mol / l citrate buffer , ph 4.5 ) .
three days after stz injection , the blood glucose level was measured in a tail vein blood sample .
rats with a blood glucose level greater than 16.7 mmol / l were included in the study .
rats in each group were treated as follows : control group ( n = 12 ) : normal animals treated with vehicle ( distilled water intraperitoneally ) ; dm group ( n = 12 ) : diabetic animals treated with vehicle ( distilled water intraperitoneally ) ; dm + tiia group ( n = 12 ) : diabetic animals treated with tiia 50 mg / kg. treatment was started 3 weeks after stz injection and lasted for 3 weeks [ 18 ] .
during this period , diabetic animals showed symptoms of polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia , and weight loss [ 19 ] .
the tiia powder was dissolved in distilled water ( concentration 0.5 %) and administered to the rats by intraperitoneal injection daily ; the dose was determined based on previous literatures [ 14 , 20 ] .
blood glucose levels were monitored at intervals during the experiment .
behavioral assessments like thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were performed on 0th , 3rd , 4th , 5th , and 6th week of the study .
at the end of the 6th week , immediately after behavioral assessment , rats in all the groups were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium ( 40 mg / kg ) .
under dissecting microscope , drg at l4 - l6 levels were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc until biochemical analysis .
then the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation .
2.4 .
behavioral tests 2.4.1 .
assessment of allodynia allodynia was assessed by determination of the paw withdrawal threshold by mean of von frey test .
the procedure was described and previously validated by chaplan et al .
[ 21 ] .
in brief , rats were placed in a testing cage with a wire mesh bottom ; behavioral adaptation was allowed for 15 - 20 min , until the major grooming activities and cage exploration ceased .
von frey hairs ( 1.4 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 , and 26 g ) were applied to the middle of the plantar surface of the hind paw , for a maximum of 8 s to elicit a paw withdrawal thresholds .
abrupt paw withdrawal , licking , and shaking were considered to be positive responses .
the same procedure was repeated three times on the same paw , with at least 5 - minute interval between two successive procedures .
the mean of the three values was considered as paw withdrawal threshold for each rat .
2.4.2 .
assessment of hyperalgesia hyperalgesia was assessed by measuring the paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat using the hargreaves method [ 22 ] .
briefly , rats were placed in an organic glass box without restraint ; after a 15 - 20 min habituation period the plantar surface of the paw was exposed to the infrared radiant heat ( model 390 , iitc life science , woodland hills , ca , usa ) through the glass floor .
the paw withdrawal latency was defined as the time from onset of the radiant heat to the withdrawal of the rat hind paw .
the heat source was adjusted to a mean baseline value about 10 - 12 seconds and a cutoff time of 20 seconds to prevent tissue damage .
testing was performed 4 times on the same paw with a 5 - minute interval , and the mean of the last three values was considered as the thermal withdrawal latency .
2.5 .
quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) thawed l4 - l6 drg were homogenized in 1 ml of trizol reagent ( beyotime , haimen , china ) ; total rna was isolated according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the purity of rna was quantified by spectrophotometer ( a260 / 280 ) .
cdna was synthesized from total rna using a primescript ( tm ) rt reagent kit with gdna eraser ( takara bio , otsu shiga , japan ) .
the reverse transcription reaction was performed under the following conditions : ( i ) 37degreesc for 15 min and ( ii ) 85degreesc for 5 min , followed by storing at 4degreesc .
qpcr reactions were carried out on a abi 7500 real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , usa ) with sybr green i pcr mix kit ( applied biosystems ) .
each reaction consisted of a volume of 20 mul sample ( 2 mul cdna , 10 mul 2x sybr green mixtures , 0.4 mul of each primer , and 7.2 mul of nuclease - free water ) .
the protocol consisted of an initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95degreesc for 30 sec , annealing at 60degreesc for 30 sec , and extension at 72degreesc for 30 sec .
melting curves were generated at the end of every run to ensure product uniformity .
each sample was performed in triplicate , and the results were averaged .
gapdh was used as an internal control transcript .
relative changes in mrna levels were determined by the 2 - deltadeltact method as previously described .
primers sequences used in real - time pcr are summarized in table 1 .
2.6 .
western blot analysis the frozen l4 - l6 drg was thawed and homogenized in ice - cold ripa lysis buffer ( beyotime ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( roche ) .
then the homogenized tissues were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4degreesc , and the resulting supernatant was collected .
protein concentrations of the extracts were measured by bca assay .
protein samples ( 50 ug ) were denatured at 95degreesc for 5 minutes , separated by sds - page , and then transferred onto pvdf membranes ( millipore ) .
the membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the primary antibodies : tnf - alpha ( 1 : 1000 ; ab6671 ) , il - 1beta ( 1 : 1000 ; ab2105 ) , il - 6 ( 1 : 1000 ; ab9324 ) , il - 10 ( 1 : 1000 ; ab33471 ) , and beta - actin ( 1 : 10000 ; sc - 47778 ) at 4degreesc overnight , followed by washes with tbst .
finally , the membranes were incubated with hrp - conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature .
the signal was detected with super ecl kit and x - ray film .
specific bands were evaluated by apparent molecular sizes .
the intensity of the selected bands was quantified by imagej software and standardized with the beta - actin density .
2.7 .
statistical analysis results were analyzed by spss ( ver19.0 ) .
the significant differences were analyzed by one - way analysis of variances ( anova ) , followed by least significant difference ( lsd ) test .
all results were presented as mean +/ - sem , and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically different .
3. results 3.1 .
effects of tiia on body weight and blood glucose level by the 3rd day after stz injection , 85.7 % of the rats developed hyperglycemia ( n = 24 ) ; their blood glucose levels were statistically higher than the control rats ( p < 0.01 ) , which did not significantly change during the experiment .
there was a marked weight loss of stz - induced diabetic rats as compared with control rats ( p < 0.05 ) .
tiia treatment did not alter the body weight and the blood glucose level ( data are shown in figure 1 ) .
3.2 .
effects of tiia on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia at the end of the 3rd week , mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and thermal paw withdrawal latency were significantly lower in dm and dm + tiia groups than in control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
tiia treatment for 3 weeks increased the paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency in dm + tiia group compared with dm group ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2 ) .
3.3 .
effects of tiia on mrna expression of inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and il - 10 ) in the drg ( l4 - l6 ) to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the function of tiia , qpcr was used to determine the mrna levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and il - 10 in drg .
at the end of the study , in dm group , the mrna levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha in drg were significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) and il - 10 was lower than in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
3 weeks of treatment with tiia reduced the mrna level of the proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha ) and elevated the anti - inflammation cytokine ( il - 10 ) ( figure 3 ) .
3.4 .
effects of tiia on protein expression of inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and il - 10 ) in drg ( l4 - l6 ) the protein levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha were increased and il - 10 was decreased in dm group compared with control rats .
as shown in figure 4 , 3 weeks of treatment with tiia led to significantly lower expression of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha and significant upregulation of il - 10 .
4. discussion in this study , we found that tiia treatment attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the rats with diabetes .
in addition , our data confirmed that the pain behavior coincided with the expression changes of inflammatory cytokines ( tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 6 , and il - 10 ) in rats with diabetes induced by stz .
moreover , tiia treatment reduced the proinflammatory cytokines level ( tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 ) and elevated anti - inflammatory cytokine level ( il - 10 ) in drg of stz - induced diabetic rats .
all the findings suggest an antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic capability of tiia against inflammatory response in stz - induced diabetic rats .
in recent years , stz - induced diabetic rat has been widely used in dpn studies [ 19 , 23 ] .
the present study showed that after 3 weeks of stz injection diabetic rats manifested decreased paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency , indicating the appearance of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia .
these findings are concordant with observations in some previous studies [ 24 , 25 ] .
however , some other reports demonstrated a thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic animals [ 19 , 23 , 26 ] .
we speculate that the discrepancy may be related to the following factors : diabetic duration ( early or later stages ) ; severity of the diabetic state ; different behavioral test methods and kinds of animals used in experimental studies .
it is well accepted that most of the diabetic complications , including dpnp , are caused by protracted hyperglycemia .
our study showed that 3 weeks of treatment with tiia significantly attenuated the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but did not influence the blood glucose level .
some previous studies have also reported many other compounds which have beneficial effects on diabetic complications , including neuropathy and nephropathy without any influence on stz - induced hyperglycemia and body weight loss [ 27 , 28 ] .
furthermore , in both human and animal studies , conventional dm therapy and even enhanced blood glucose control have failed to prevent diabetic neuropathy [ 29 ] .
these data indicate that the therapeutic effects of tiia on dpnp have no relationship with blood glucose level .
the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy is complicated and involves multiple pathways .
in the last decade , studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain is associated with the interactions between neurons , inflammatory immune cells , and immune cell - derived inflammatory cytokines [ 30 ] .
metabolic changes induced by hyperglycemia lead to increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines by both activated resident immune cells and recruited immune cells , which induces biochemical changes and nerve damage , resulting in pain - related symptoms eventually [ 25 , 29 ] .
increasing evidences indicate that inflammatory cytokines play key roles in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain .
previous study has shown that patients with painful neuropathy have increased mrna and protein levels of il - 2 and tnf - alpha and decreased levels of il - 4 and il - 10 [ 31 ] .
in animal models , altered pain behaviors are associated with elevated tnf - alpha levels [ 32 ] , and intraneural application of proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta and tnf - alpha induces behavioral signs associated with pain [ 33 ] .
in the present study , our data showed that the increased proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 ) and decreased anti - inflammatory cytokine ( il - 10 ) in the drg may be related to the allodynia and hyperalgesia in stz - induced diabetic rats .
modulating the cytokines production by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines and / or upregulating anti - inflammatory cytokines and restoring the balance of pro - / anti - inflammatory cytokines in the nervous system have been considered as treatment strategies for neuropathic pain [ 34 ] .
intrathecal administration of il - 1beta and tnfalpha antagonists as well as il - 6 neutralizing antibody attenuates pain behaviors in neuropathic models [ 35 - 37 ] .
hsv mediated local expression of il10 in the drg inhibits the development of painful neuropathy in diabetic rats [ 38 ] .
however , it is considered that il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 induce the production of each other through positive feedback , acting synergistically to amplify the inflammatory signals [ 39 ] , which can of course lead to a vicious circle of chronic inflammation if not adequately suppressed , so it is difficult to achieve satisfactory improvement of pain symptoms by modulating just one single cytokine .
unlike the cytokine antagonist by blocking only one specific inflammatory cytokine , herbal plant extracts affect productions of multiple cytokines , reduce excessive inflammatory responses , and cause relatively little side effects .
in animal models , genistein relieves neuropathic pain following nerve injury via downregulation of both il - 1beta and il - 6 [ 40 ] ; analgesic effect of coumarins is mediated by reducing spared nerve injury - ( sni - ) induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and il - 6 in damaged drg [ 41 ] ; bioactive fractions of annona reticulate bark attenuate painful diabetic neuropathy through decreasing the inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha ) and increasing anti - inflammatory cytokine ( il - 10 ) [ 42 ] .
in line with the literature , in the present study , after 3 weeks of treatment with tiia , mrna and protein levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha were reduced , il - 10 expression was elevated , and the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were alleviated simultaneously .
there are some limitations in the present study .
we only focused on cytokines expressions in the drg in our study .
in others' experiments , the cytokines were also measured in the sciatic nerve , the drg , and the spinal cord [ 40 , 43 - 45 ] .
however , the overall tendency of alterations of mrna and protein levels was the same .
besides , hyperglycemia is known to induce oxidative stress which leads to nerve damage resulting in dpnp [ 46 ] .
the antioxidant property of tiia may also contribute to its antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects [ 7 ] .
further studies are needed to explore alternative mechanisms that underline the therapeutic effects of tiia .
in conclusion , this study reveals that tiia treatment alleviates mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in a stz - induced diabetic rat model .
furthermore , tiia significantly modulates the expressions of several inflammatory cytokines in this model .
therefore , the antinociceptive activity of tiia could be attributed , at least in part , to its anti - inflammatory properties .
these findings suggest that tiia might be a candidate medication for dpnp treatment .
further investigations in larger animals or even human are still needed .

abstract two new species of dilkea subgenus dilkea ( passifloraceae ) are described from loreto , peru .
dilkea hebes feuillet , sp. nov. , has leaves with elliptic to oblanceolate blades that are dull adaxially , and spherical fruits with thick walls ; dilkea nitens feuillet , sp. nov. , has leaves with narrow - ovate blades that are shiny adaxially , and fruits with an apical cone and thin walls .
a key to the species of subgenus dilkea is provided .
keywords dilkea hebes dilkea nitens passifloraceae loreto peru introduction dilkea mast .
belongs in the passifloraceae juss .
ex roussel subfamily passifloroideae burnett tribe passifloreae dc. and currently includes 12 neotropical species including the two described below .
among the new world genera of passifloraceae , dilkea is a distant second to passiflora l. with its ca .
550 species .
dilkea is characterized by tetramerous flowers with 8 stamens , a set of 4 carpels with 4 styles fused in the basal third , an androgynophore lacking or rarely sub - null , the operculum lacking , and seeds of a peanut shape and size , while passiflora has pentamerous flowers with 5 stamens , an androecium with 3 carpels with 3 free styles , a well - developed androgynophore , an operculum of various shapes , and seeds flattened and usually much smaller .
the two other neotropical genera each with 2 - 3 species are tetramerous like dilkea , but mitostemma mast. has free styles and the species of ancistrothyrsus harms are hairy throughout and their fruits are capsular , while dilkea species are glabrous and their fruits are baccate .
in the past few years , i came across many collections of dilkea , a genus previously poorly collected .
six species are presently recognized in subgenus epkia feuillet , ( 2009 ) and are often confused with clavija ruiz & pav .
in the primulaceae ( apg iii 2009 ) .
new species from the guiana shield have been described recently ( feuillet 2010a ) .

dilkea have similar white flowers and the useful morphological characters are mainly the position and structure of the inflorescence and the shape of the leaves and the fruits .
taxonomic treatment dilkea subgenus dilkea dilkea subgenus dilkea is composed of lianas or climbing shrubs , or small shrubs in the case of dilkea margaritae cervi , with a continuous growth and thick tendrils trifid at the apex rather than shrubs or small trees with a strongly rhythmic growth and usually without tendrils in subgenus epkia .
the six species of subgenus dilkea have been collected from panama to amapa ( brazil ) and from amazonian bolivia to the guianas .

the specimen labels did not give geographical coordinates for the collection localities of dilkea hebes in peru , loreto , maynas , distr. iquitos .
the localities cited for the two specimens , " quebrada de morropon " or " pampa chica " , are not in the gazetteer published by the united states board on geographic names ( usbgn 1989 ) , and santa clara and bella vista are common village names in peru .
a search in the national geospatial - intelligence agency database ( nga web site ) on santa clara brought 11 occurrences in loreto and bella vista / bellavista 16 .
coordinates for those are too uncertain to be presented in the specimen citations , but it is possible that they are puerto bellavista nanay , port of iquitos on the rio nanay , ca .

dilkea hebes is known from two collections from the same district in maynas , loreto , peru .

dilkea hebes has a few fruit characteristics that distinguish it from all other species of dilkea and that may be related to its frequently inundated habitat .
the thick corky fruit wall , the small number of seeds leaving empty space in the fruit , and possibly the thin membranes inside the fruit increase the floatability of the fruit suggesting that the fruits may be disseminated during floods .
cork has been found in some species of passiflora , for example on the bark of mature stems of passiflora suberosa l. and passiflora sexocellata schlecht .

the vegetative characters are rather similar to dilkea johannesii barb.rodr. , which differs by its thin - walled fruit tapering at base and having an apical hard cone ( cf. original illustration , reproduced from the smithsonian library , feuillet 2010b ). etymology .

in subgenus dilkea where most species have oblanceolate to obovate leaf blades , dilkea nitens is clearly identified by its narrowly ovate leaf blades , widest a quarter of the length from the base or less , a character shared only with dilkea margaritae cervi from mato grosso ( brazil ) which , in contrast with dilkea nitens , is a low shrub with 3.5 - 7 cm long axillary pedicels. etymology .

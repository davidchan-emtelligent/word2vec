aim : anaplasma platys , the causative agent of infectious canine cyclic thrombocytopenia , is a tick - borne pathogen that also has been implicated as potentially zoonotic .
to provide molecular evidence on the multiple infections of a. platys variants in philippine dogs .
materials and methods : dna fragments of a. platys from infected dogs in the philippines were molecularly characterized .
for screening , 25 dogs suspected to have canine anaplasmosis were tested using a 16s rrna - based nested polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .
infection was confirmed by sequencing of positive amplicons .
second round pcr targeting a longer 16s rrna fragment was subsequently performed on the first round pcr amplicons of the positive samples .
further characterization using the heat - shock operon ( groel ) gene was also performed on the a. platys - positive samples .
results : 10 16s rrna sequences were obtained and found 99.6 - 100 % identical to each other and 99.6 - 99.7 % identical to the closest registered a. platys sequences .
on the other hand , 36 groel clone sequences were obtained and found to be 85.1 - 99.8 % identical with each other and 85.0 - 88.9 % identical to the closest previously registered a. platys sequences .
four dogs were found coinfected with 2 - 3 groel variant sequences .
phylogenetic analyses suggest that the detected a. platys in the philippines may represent unique variants .
conclusion : a. platys variants were detected in philippine dogs .
coinfection of different a. platys variants in dogs was also demonstrated .
the present study may indicate the potential genetic diversity of a. platys in the country .
anaplasma platys dogs philippines variants introduction anaplasma platys is a gram - negative intracellular bacteria of the family anaplasmataceae [ 1 ] that has recently been reported to infect humans [ 2 - 4 ] .
in the philippines , it has been detected in ticks [ 5 ] and dogs [ 6 ] .
nearby countries including thailand [ 7 ] , china [ 8 ] , korea [ 9 ] , japan [ 10 ] , and taiwan [ 11 ] already have reports of detection and characterization of this pathogen .
characterizations of a. platys based on the heat - shock operon gene ( groel ) are limited .
this particular gene has been used to identify genotypes of a related anaplasma species .
pathogenicity of anaplasma sp. maybe related to its genotype [ 12 ] , although detailed investigations using groel in assessing clinical signs or effects to the animal has been limited .
only few reports on a. platys detection in the philippines are available .
the present study aimed to detect and molecularly characterize a. platys based on the 16s rrna and groel genes from infected dogs in the country .
the obtained sequences were further subjected to phylogenetic analyses using different methods .
materials and methods ethical approval the study was performed in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines of southwestern university , cebu and the animal welfare act of the philippines ( ra8485 ) , and with the approval of the attending veterinarians and proprietor of the veterinary establishment .
dna sample from dogs dna samples were obtained from blood of 25 dogs that were presented at the gpy veterinare animale group of veterinary clinics , cebu , philippines .
these dogs were thrombocytopenic and exhibited clinical signs suggestive of canine anaplasmosis [ 13 ] and were found serologically negative for ehrlichia canis using an immunocomb ( r ) ( biogal , israel ) commercial test kit [ 14 ] .
dna was extracted using procedures as previously described [ 5 ] .
16s rrna polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) assay for the 16s rrna pcr , dna samples were tested using a previously described method [ 5 ] with slight modification to confirm infection .
briefly , outer primer pair fd1 / rp2 and inner primer pair ehr16sd / ehr16sr ( for screening ) were used to amplify a final 345 - bp - target of ehrlichia / anaplasma spp. those found positive with the ehr16sd / ehr16sr screening pcr were further analyzed .
using the first round fd1 / rp2 amplicons , hemi - nested pcrs were performed utilizing the primer pairs fd1 / ehr16sr and ehr16sd / rp2 targeting a total of approximately 1400 - 1600 bp. a final volume of 10 and 25 microl was set for the first and final round pcrs using a similar method , respectively [ 15 ] .
the negative and positive controls used were double distilled water and a. bovis [ 16 ] , respectively .
groel - based pcr assay dna samples which were found positive during the screening pcr were further analyzed using a groel - based nested pcr assay .
in the first round , primers eegro1f and eegro2r [ 17 ] were used employing procedures as previously described [ 18 ] .
for the second round pcr , newly designed primers , i.e. apl136f ( ccrgagatkackaaggatggc ) and apl590r ( ccrcgrtcaaay tgcatacc ) that targeted a 455 bp fragment were used .
similar final pcr volumes were used [ 18 ] .
step - down pcr method ( with 2degreesc increment ) was employed in the second round pcr with a starting and final annealing of 62degreesc and 52degreesc , respectively .
cloning , sequencing , and sequence comparison final amplicons were purified using a gel extraction kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) and were cloned using a ta cloning kit ( invitrogen , usa ) .
dna sequencing was performed as described previously [ 18 ] .
obtained 16s rrna and groel sequences were aligned as previously described [ 18 ] to obtain partial but longer dna fragments .
sequence comparison was also performed as previously described [ 18 ] .
all sequences obtained in this study were registered at genbank , usa .
phylogenetic analyses all sequences were manually trimmed to include only the sequence of interest .
percent identities were computed , and multiple sequence alignments were performed as previously described [ 18 ] .
analyses by neighbor - joining using maximum composite likelihood , by maximum likelihood with prior best model testing using mega 5 [ 19 ] , and by bayesian inference using mrbayes 3.2 [ 20 ] guided by the prior best model test results from mega 5 were employed .
a total of 1000 bootstrap replications and 1,000,000 generations were used in the analyses using mega 5 and mrbayes 3.2 , respectively .
tree results from mrbayes 3.2 were viewed using the figtree v1.3.1 ( http :// tree.bio.ed.ac.uk / software / figtree /) .
results and discussion the screening pcr revealed 10 positive dogs .
obtained sequences ( kp006398 - kp006406 ) after alignment ( 1467 bp ) were 99.6 - 100 % identical to each other and 99.6 - 99.7 % identical to the closest registered a. platys sequences from the philippines and thailand. from the a. platys - positive samples , further characterization using the groel resulted to 36 clone sequences ( kp027333 - kp027368 ) , which were 85.1 - 99.8 % identical with each other and 85.0 - 88.9 % identical to the closest registered a. platys sequences. from the positive dogs , four were found coinfected with 2 - 3 groel variant sequences .
to the best of our knowledge , several studies have reported multiple infections of different tick - borne pathogens in dogs [ 2,3,7,21 ] , but multiple infections with different variants of a pathogen in an animal have not been reported until this study .
while coinfections can produce more severe signs [ 7 ] , further studies are needed to determine if coinfections with different variants of a. platys in dog have an effect on the clinical expression of the disease .
regardless of the phylogenetic methods used , analyses based on the 16s rrna gene showed that the obtained sequences formed a different a. platys subclade supported by moderate to high bootstrap values ( figure - 1 ) or posterior probabilities ( figure not shown ) .
interestingly , neutrophil - tropic anaplasma spp. isolates detected from mediterranean ruminants [ 22 ] clustered with the philippine variants .
due to low intra - species variability of the 16s rrna gene , analyses based on other genes such as groel are needed to validate potential phylogenetic relationships .
figure - 1 phylogenetic analysis of anaplasma platys detected from philippine dogs based on the 16s rrna gene using maximum likelihood method .
rickettsia prowazekii was set as the out - group .
sequences obtained in the study are set in bold .
based on the groel gene , phylogenetic analyses revealed that the detected philippine a. platys variants formed a unique cluster ( figure - 2 ) .
owing to the higher number of newly obtained sequences in this study and higher variability of the gene , more subclades within the a. platys group were seen in the latter analyses .
moreover , new a. platys and a. platys - like isolates from italy [ 23 ] were found to be in a unique subclade that appears to cluster differently from the detected philippine a. platys variants .
in this study , groel was used to show the different variants of a. platys because of its higher intra - and inter - species variation than the 16s rrna [ 13,18 ] .
owing to this advantage , the groel is used for genotyping other species [ 12,24 ] .
moreover , phylogenetic results using this gene have been shown to produce similar results using the anka , glta , and 16s rrna [ 1,25 - 28 ] .
figure - 2 phylogenetic analysis of anaplasma platys detected from philippine dogs based on the heat - shock operon ( groesl ) gene using maximum likelihood method ( utilizing nucleotide sequences ) .
ehrlichia canis was set as the out - group .
sequences obtained in the study are set in bold .
identities of the newly obtained sequences to registered a. platys sequences were confirmed by high similarities in two genes ( 16s rrna and groel ) .
phylogenetic analyses' results suggest that the detected a. platys in the philippines may represent unique variants as the obtained sequences branched separately under the a. platys clade .
these results can indicate the potential genetic diversity of a. platys in the country .
this study supports the usefulness of groel in investigating genetic diversities in anaplasma species .
on the other hand , further studies on the multiple infection of several a. platys variants in dogs that may also be coinfected with e. canis [ 29,30 ] , which has a common vector and is present in the philippines .
conclusion a. platys variants were detected in philippine dogs .
coinfection of different a. platys variants in dogs was also demonstrated .
the present study may indicate the potential genetic diversity of a. platys in the country .

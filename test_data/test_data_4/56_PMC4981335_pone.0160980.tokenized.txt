a recombinant analogue of lactaptin ( rl2 ) , a new potential anticancer molecule , induces apoptosis in cultured tumor cells .
the tumor suppression efficacy of rl2 was shown against mouse hepatoma - 1 cells and mda - mb - 231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells .
the rl2 - based therapeutic drug lactaptin is distributed evenly throughout the organism , which reduces its antitumor efficacy .
in the current study , we obtained a genetic construct that allows production of the recombinant fusion protein t3 - rl2 , consisting of rl2 and t3 peptide ( ytydpwlifpan ) , in e. coli cells .
t3 peptide was selected from a phage peptide library as a result of two screenings : in vitro using mda - mb - 231 cell culture and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer mda - mb - 231 .
it was shown that the displayed peptide t3 provides binding and internalization of phage particles by mda - mb - 231 cells and their specific accumulation in mda - mb - 231 tumor tissue .
in addition , based on the nucleotide sequences coding rl2 and the known tumor - targeting peptide irgd , we obtained genetic constructs that provide synthesis of fusion proteins rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his .
we studied the cytotoxic activity of fusion proteins t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his in vitro using mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 human adenocarcinoma cells .
the in vitro results showed that the fusion proteins inhibit proliferation of both cell cultures , and their cytotoxic activity is higher than that of rl2 .
in vivo experiments on the study of the antitumor efficacy of the obtained fusion proteins demonstrated that t3 - rl2 protein significantly inhibits mda - mb - 231 tumor growth in a xenograft model compared with rl2 , while the antitumor effect of rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his proteins is comparable to the effect of rl2 .

introduction lactaptin (~ 8.6 kda ) , a proteolytic fragment of human kappa - casein ( residues 57 - 134 ) , has been previously found in human breast milk .
lactaptin was capable of reducing cell viability and inducing apoptosis in cultured tumor cells [ 1 ] .
a series of recombinant analogues of lactaptin were constructed , but only one of them ( rl2 ) effectively induced cell death in various human cancer cells ( breast adenocarcinomas mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 , lung carcinoma a549 , larynx epidermal carcinoma hep - 2 ) and mouse cancer cells ( lewis lung carcinoma and ha1 hepatoma ) while having no effect on the viability of non - malignant msc cells [ 2 ] .
the tumor suppression efficacy of rl2 in vivo was shown against mouse hepatoma - 1 as well as human adenocarcinoma mda - mb - 231 cells grafted onto severe combined immunodeficiency ( scid ) mice [ 3 , 4 ] .
the preclinical trials of the rl2 - based therapeutic drug lactaptin have been successful , and the safety and antitumor efficacy of this drug have been demonstrated .
however , lactaptin , as most protein - based therapeutic drugs , is distributed evenly throughout the organism , which reduces its antitumor efficacy [ 5 ] .
further improvements for the enhancement of lactaptin efficacy by rational modifications are required .
currently , various modifications to obtain targeting properties are considered as one of the most promising ways to improve the therapeutic effect of antitumor drugs .
in particular , direct conjugation to a tumor - specific peptide could increase the local concentration of the drug in tumor tissue .
an effective method of obtaining tumor - specific peptides is screening of phage peptide libraries , which is carried out in vitro using cancer cell cultures and in vivo using animal models [ 6 ] .
a successful example of such screening is the irgd peptide ( crgdk / rgpdc ) , which combines two amino acid motifs ( rgd motif and r / kxxr / k motif ) and two properties : the ability to specifically bind to cancer cells and the ability to internalize into cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels and tumor parenchyma .
the complete mechanism of irgd action was described by sugahara et al .
[ 7 ] .
the peptide irgd has been shown to enhance the antitumor efficacy of agents upon their conjugation / fusion while acting as a delivery agent [ 8 , 9 ] .
we hypothesized that the conjugation of a short peptide specific to tumor tissue to rl2 could enhance its antitumor efficacy in vivo .
in this study , we performed biopanning of a phage peptide library in vitro on human breast cancer mda - mb - 231 cells and in vivo on a human breast cancer mda - mb - 231 xenograft model .
we selected a phage clone displaying t3 peptide that had the greatest specificity for cancer cells and tumor tissue .
based on the nucleotide sequences coding the selected peptide ( t3 ) and irgd peptide , recombinant plasmids were constructed that provided synthesis of fusion proteins t3 - rl2 , rl - irgd - his and rl2 - irgd consisting of tumor - specific peptides and cytotoxic protein rl2 .
a comparative assessment of the cytotoxic activity of the fusion proteins was conducted in vitro on human cancer cells and their antitumor efficacy was investigated in vivo in tumor models .

according to the data presented in fig 1 , clones 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 bind more readily to mda - mb - 231 cells compared to the control bacteriophage .
clone 1.1 had the highest binding level ; its titer turned out to be about 170 times higher than the negative control titer .
in addition , clone 1.2 binds more readily to mcf - 7 cells in comparison to the control bacteriophage .
it is worth mentioning that clones 1.1 - 1.3 demonstrated no binding to healthy cells of the primary human breast culture .

furthermore , the amino acid sequence of the displayed peptide slpvyapaltsr ( 2.1 ) corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the displayed peptide of clone 1.3 selected in vitro on the human cancer mda - mb - 231 cell line .
specific accumulation of selected bacteriophage clones in tumor tissue the study of specific accumulation of phage clones 1.1 - 1.3 , selected in vitro , and clones 2.1 - 2.4 selected in vivo was carried out by determining the bacteriophage titer in tumor tissue of human breast adenocarcinoma mda - mb - 231 grafted into xenograft mice and in control organs ( lung and liver ) 24 h after intravenous administration of bacteriophage to the tested animals ( fig 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0160980.g002 fig 2 specific accumulation of the selected phage clones in tumor tissue .
bacteriophage clones displaying peptides 1.1 - ytydpwlifpan , 1.2 - fipfdpmsmrwe , 1.3 ( 2.1 ) - slpvyapaltsr , 2.2 - grepaasllshf , 2.3 - gtglvtlprltv , 2.4 - dsqfnkysiatv and control bacteriophage were injected intravenously into scid mice with grafted human tumor mda - mb - 231 .
after 24 h of administration , the bacteriophage titer obtained from the homogenate of tumor tissue , liver and lung was measured .
normalized binding ability to tumor ( lung ) was calculated as the ratio between the mean titer values ( pfu / g ) obtained from tumor tissue ( lung ) and liver .
data were statistically analyzed using one - way anova with post hoc fisher test .
data are presented as mean +/ - sem ; a p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
clone 1.1 , which was selected in vitro , had the highest binding specificity for mda - mb - 231 tumor tissue .
its titer obtained from tumor tissue was approximately 800 - fold higher than the titer obtained from liver and approximately 1900 - fold higher than the titer obtained from lung .
other clones and control bacteriophage did not have binding specificity for mda - mb - 231 tumor tissue grafted into scid mice ( fig 3 ) .

the arrow points to a phage particle .
interaction of clone 1.1 displaying peptide ytydpwlifpan with mda - mb - 231 cells incubation of clone 1.1 displaying peptide ytydpwlifpan with mda - mb - 231 cells was carried out at 4degreesc in order to confirm binding to the cells and at 37degreesc in order to evaluate the presence of intracellular phages ( fig 3 ) .
the data in fig 3 demonstrate that clone 1.1 , in contrast to the control bacteriophage , is capable of binding to cell surface structures upon incubation with mda - mb - 231 cells at 4degreesc .
during incubation with mda - mb - 231 cells at 37degreesc , clone 1.1 remains bound to cells even after a series of washes from bacteriophages , which indicates the ability of the displayed peptide to provide internalization of phage particles .
ultrathin sections of the precipitates of mda - mb - 231 cells after 10 min and 1 h of incubation with phage clone 1.1 showed that phage particles were detected in the intercellular space , in plasmalemma invaginations and bottomed pits , indicating internalization of phage particles by cells via phagocytosis and clathrin - dependent endocytosis .
cytotoxic activity of recombinant fusion proteins comparative analysis of the effects of rl2 and recombinant fusion proteins t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his on tumor cell viability was carried out using mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 cell cultures .
changes in cell viability were assessed using the mtt assay .
it has been demonstrated that t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his reduce viability of mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 cells in a dose - dependent manner in the same way as rl2 ( fig 4 ) .
at the same time , the cytotoxic activity of t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his proteins in relation to cancer cells of both lines is approximately the same ( ic50 about 0.15 - 0.20 mg / ml ) and significantly exceeds rl2 activity ( ic50 about 0.35 - 0.4 mg / ml ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0160980.g004 fig 4 fusion proteins enhanced cytotoxic outcome and delayed tumor development .
( a ) mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 cells were treated with different concentrations of rl2 , fusion proteins or saline ( control ) for 48 h and mtt analysis was performed .
tumor cell viability was determined relative to the viability of the control cells ( incubated without the proteins ) .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd .
( b ) scid mice with subcutaneously grafted mda - mb - 231 tumors , which reached an average ( in the group ) size of 20 +/ - 10 mm3 , were subjected to intravenous injection of fusion proteins ( rl2 , t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd or rl - irgd - his ) at a dose of 40 mg / kg in saline three times every second day .
the control group of mice received saline with the same mode of as administration the proteins .
tumors were excised and weighed on the 17th day after the last injection .
boxes represent the 25th , 50th and 75th percentiles .
squares with lines represent the median .
whiskers represent minimum / maximum .
data were statistically analyzed using one - way anova with post hoc fisher test ; a p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
antitumor effect of recombinant fusion proteins in order to compare the antitumor activity of rl2 and recombinant fusion peptides t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his , a xenograft model of human breast cancer was used .
a suspension of mda - mb - 231 cells in matrigel was subcutaneously injected into 6 - 8 - week - old female scid mice to form solid tumors .
tumor volumes were monitored every 3 days .
when tumors reached roughly 20 mm3 , recombinant peptides ( 40 mg / kg ) were injected intravenously every 2 days with a total of three injections .
the selected dose of recombinant peptides and the treatment regime were based on the therapeutic scheme described previously [ 3 ] .
there was no animal mortality observed in either experimental or control groups during the experiment .
seventeen days after the last injection , the tumors were excised and weighed ( fig 4 ) .
as shown in fig 4 , tumors were bigger in the control group than in the groups treated with rl2 and fusion proteins .
the average weights of the tumors in the control group and the group treated with rl2 were 85.6 mg and 52.8 mg , respectively .
thus , the rate of tumor growth inhibition after rl2 therapy was calculated as 38 % .
the most pronounced effect of inhibiting tumor growth was observed in the group treated with t3 - rl protein , wherein the average weight of the tumor was 16.4 mg , and the rate of tumor growth inhibition was 80 % .
discussion the development of novel antitumor drugs depends , on the one hand , on the ability to influence cellular processes and pathways , which differ between cancer and normal cells , and , on the other hand , on the ability of targeting agents to effectively deliver drugs to the tumor .
the latter is possible due to multiple genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during oncogenesis and lead to changes in the proteomic profile of the cancer cell [ 12 - 14 ] .
changes in the type , number and location of receptors results in the formation of a unique topographic phenotype of the cell surface .
this surface phenotype is the molecular address for the delivery of biomolecules [ 15 ] .
dysregulation of one of the key processes of cell activity , apoptosis , is one of the reasons for the development of malignant tumors .
therefore , the development of new inducers and modulators of apoptosis of cancer cells is one of the approaches for the development of modern oncotherapeutic agents [ 16 ] .
the recombinant analogue of lactaptin , rl2 , is an inducer of apoptosis in mouse and human cancer cells .
the mechanism leading to cell death after rl2 treatment involves penetration of the peptide into cells , disruption of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential , down - regulation of bcl - 2 , activation of the executioners caspase - 3 and - 7 and apoptotic fragmentation of dna [ 4 ] .
the rl2 - based therapeutic drug lactaptin possesses an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in vivo but , as with most protein - based therapeutic drugs , is distributed evenly throughout the organism , which reduces its antitumor efficacy .
in the current study , in order to enhance the antitumor efficacy of lactaptin , we constructed three recombinant fusion proteins t3 - rl2 , rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his on the basis of the nucleotide sequences coding rl2 and tumor - specific peptides .
t3 peptide ( ytydpwlifpan ) , which we selected from the phage peptide library in this study , and irgd peptide ( crgdkgpdc ) , the sequence of which was taken from the literature data , were chosen as tumor - specific peptides .
for the selection of a specific peptide , we conducted biopanning of the phage peptide library against the mda - mb - 231 cell line , as it is one of the most sensitive human cancer cell lines to rl2 in vitro .
moreover , rl2 has been shown to inhibit the growth of mda - mb - 231 tumor cells in a mouse xenograft model [ 4 ] .
mda - mb - 231 is a triple - negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) , defined as a tumor negative for estrogen receptor ( er ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) [ 17 , 18 ] .
the highly aggressive nature of tnbcs , the high probability of metastasis and the absence of targeted drugs led to the active search for actionable molecular targets for the treatment of patients with these tumors [ 19 ] .
to date , due to various ' omic ' technologies , an unexpected level of tnbc heterogeneity has been revealed .
subsequently , potentially actionable molecular features in some tnbcs , such as germline brca1 / 2 mutations or ' brcaness ' , the presence of an androgen receptor and several rare genomic alterations [ 20 , 21 ] , have been revealed .
nevertheless , the search for novel targets still remains a relevant issue .
we chose two biopanning strategies : in vitro on mda - mb - 231 cell culture directed to a selection of peptides capable of internalizing a cargo into cells , and in vivo on mda - mb - 231 tumors in a xenograft model .
we supposed that tumor targeted delivery efficiency may be improved with the ability of peptides to bind to tumor - specific receptors and provide a higher tumor cell internalization rate .
since both of the strategies have their features , we implemented both approaches as part of this study .
in vitro biopanning allows selection of peptides specific to cell lines in the absence of knowledge of the particular target they bind to. the advantage of this type of screening is that cell receptors are located in their native context , and this cannot be mimicked using purified membrane proteins .
the topography of the cell surface is defined by the expression levels of plasma membrane - bound proteins as well as their arrangement within the membrane .
the second advantage can be concluded from the first one : there is no need for prior identification and purification of the cellular target [ 15 , 22 ] .
furthermore , selection can be modulated by changing washing conditions , for example by selecting only those peptides displayed by bacteriophages that penetrate into cells .
in vivo biopanning allows selection of peptides specific to tumor tissue in its natural context .
in addition to the characteristics that distinguish cancer stromal cells from normal cells , as well as tumor endothelial cells , there are physical differences between tumor and normal tissues ( temperature change , low concentration of oxygen ( hypoxia ) and reduced ph ) that influence selection in the in vivo system [ 23 - 25 ] .
in our work in vitro screening on mda - mb - 231 cell culture and in vivo on mda - mb - 231 tumor in a xenograft model resulted in the isolation of different peptides , using the same library .
one possible explanation is a limited sample size of the displayed peptides sequences , another one is that two biopanning approaches used in this study are targeting different molecular features [ 15 ] .
in another work , for example , in vivo screening using cl1 - 5 tumor xenograft model leaded to the isolation the peptide sp5 - 52 targeting the vasculature , whereas in vitro screening against cl1 - 5 nsclc cell line resulted in the isolation the peptide sp5 - 2 penetrating into the tumor with a more diffuse binding pattern [ 26 , 27 ] .
as a result of comparative analysis of the ability of selected clones ( phage candidates displaying the peptide ) to bind to human breast cancer cells ( mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 ) and the comparative analysis of their specific accumulation in mda - mb - 231 tumor tissue , clone 1.1 displaying peptide ytydpwlifpan ( t3 ) and selected in vitro was chosen .
displayed peptide t3 was shown to provide binding and internalization of phage particles to mda - mb - 231 cells , which means that it can be considered as a delivery agent .
there are two basic approaches for targeted drug delivery .
in the first case , the target peptide is conjugated directly to a therapeutic drug .
the second approach assumes the delivery agent to be attached to a drug carrier .
we chose the first approach based on the fact that conjugation of a short peptide to rl2 should not have a significant effect on the cytotoxic activity of rl2 and its ability to penetrate through the interstitial space of the tumor .
a plasmid that provides synthesis of the fusion protein t3 - rl2 , wherein t3 located at the n - terminus and rl2 are separated by a glycine spacer , was constructed based on the sequence of the selected peptide t3 and rl2 .
there are examples of successful targeted delivery by a conjugation of a short tumor - specific peptides , selected from phage peptides libraries , to a proapoptotic peptide .
work by cieslewicz m. et al. showed that tail vein injection of an m2pep , selected in vitro against tumor associated macrophages ( tams ) , fused with a proapoptotic peptide improves survival in tumor - bearing mice by selective reduction of tams [ 28 ] .
jung h .
- k. et al. investigated a hybrid peptide ( named bld - 1 - kla ) composed of the csnrdarrc peptide ( bld - 1 ) , which binds to bladder tumor cells , and the d - klaklakklaklak ( kla ) peptide , which disrupts mitochondrial membrane and induces apoptotic cell death , as a bladder cancer - targeted therapeutic agent .
treatment of tumor - bearing mice with bld - 1 - kla , compared to the control peptide - kla , resulted in more efficient apoptosis induction of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor growth [ 29 ] .
in another work liu w.q. et al. investigated the ability of pi ( sequence , caspsgalrsc ) peptide to deliver a potential therapeutic protein to mda - mb - 231 cells , fusing pi with glutathione - s - transferase ( gst , 26 kda ) .
the authors demonstrated that the transduction of the pi peptide into the cell is partially mediated by macropinocytosis and caveolin - mediated endocytosis .
pi was observed to be capable of successfully delivering gst into the cytoplasm of mda - mb - 231 cells , and the exogenous protein did not degrade for >= 72 h [ 30 ] .
the sequence of irgd peptide ( crgdkgpdc ) was used as a target peptide during construction of the recombinant fusion proteins rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his .
the peptide irgd is a tumor - specific tissue - penetrating peptide [ 7 ] .
the rgd motif in the structure of irgd peptide recognizes and binds to alphavbeta3 / 5 , alpha5beta1 integrin receptors , which are expressed in a large number by tumor endothelial cells and tumor cells [ 31 , 32 ] .
it has been previously shown that mda - mb - 231 cells express alphav integrin receptors on their surface in a sufficient amount for specific recognition by the rgd motif [ 33 , 34 ] .
after binding with alphav integrins , irgd is proteolytically processed into crgdk / r , exposing an active cendr motif at the c - terminus .
interaction of the cendr motif with nrps initiates an active bulk transport system through the tumor tissue , allowing drugs conjugated to irgd and even free drugs co - administered with irgd to extravasate and spread within the tumor tissue [ 35 ] .
recently , linear irgd conjugated to the c - terminus of recombinant proteins has been used to carry drugs into tumor tissues [ 36 , 37 ] .
the peptide irgd is located at the c - terminus of the rl2 - irgd fusion protein .
fusion protein rl - irgd - his is designed so that the sequence of the irgd peptide separates the sequence of the histidine tag from the fragment encoding lactaptin .
theoretically , interaction of the irgd peptide in the composition of the rl - irgd - his fusion protein with integrin receptors can lead to cleavage of the protein by proteases , which results in detachment of the histidine tag and release of the c - terminus of the crgdk motif and binding with nrps .
the mtt test of the obtained recombinant fusion proteins using human cancer lines mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 demonstrated that they decrease the viability of both cell lines in a dose - dependent manner and share a similar cytotoxic activity .
at the same time , the fusion proteins have higher cytotoxic activity than rl2 .
differences in the antitumor effect are more pronounced between proteins .
the recombinant fusion protein t3 _ rl2 turned out to significantly inhibit growth of mda - mb - 231 tumors in a xenograft model ( 80 % decrease ) , while the antitumor potential of fusion proteins rl2 - irgd and rl - irgd - his did not differ from that of rl2 .
it is possible that conjugation of the tumor - specific peptide to the c - terminus of rl2 led to conformationally constrained interaction between the irgd peptide and the target .
in conclusion , conjugation of a specific peptide ytydpwlifpan to the n - terminus of rl2 via a glycine spacer significantly enhanced its antitumor potential .
thus , the direct conjugation of rl2 with a specific peptide can be considered as a prospective approach of enhancing its antitumor activity .

background diabetes prevalence is increasing globally , and sub - saharan africa is no exception. with diverse health challenges , health authorities in sub - saharan africa and international donors need robust data on the epidemiology and impact of diabetes in order to plan and prioritise their health programmes .
this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and up - to - date review of the epidemiological trends and public health implications of diabetes in sub - saharan africa .
methods we conducted a systematic literature review of papers published on diabetes in sub - saharan africa 1999 - march 2011 , providing data on diabetes prevalence , outcomes ( chronic complications , infections , and mortality ) , access to diagnosis and care and economic impact .
results type 2 diabetes accounts for well over 90 % of diabetes in sub - saharan africa , and population prevalence proportions ranged from 1 % in rural uganda to 12 % in urban kenya .
reported type 1 diabetes prevalence was low and ranged from 4 per 100,000 in mozambique to 12 per 100,000 in zambia .
gestational diabetes prevalence varied from 0 % in tanzania to 9 % in ethiopia .
proportions of patients with diabetic complications ranged from 7 - 63 % for retinopathy , 27 - 66 % for neuropathy , and 10 - 83 % for microalbuminuria .
diabetes is likely to increase the risk of several important infections in the region , including tuberculosis , pneumonia and sepsis .
meanwhile , antiviral treatment for hiv increases the risk of obesity and insulin resistance .
five - year mortality proportions of patients with diabetes varied from 4 - 57 % .
screening studies identified high proportions (> 40 %) with previously undiagnosed diabetes , and low levels of adequate glucose control among previously diagnosed diabetics .
barriers to accessing diagnosis and treatment included a lack of diagnostic tools and glucose monitoring equipment and high cost of diabetes treatment .
the total annual cost of diabetes in the region was estimated at us $ 67.03 billion , or us $ 8836 per diabetic patient .
conclusion diabetes exerts a significant burden in the region , and this is expected to increase .
many diabetic patients face significant challenges accessing diagnosis and treatment , which contributes to the high mortality and prevalence of complications observed .
the significant interactions between diabetes and important infectious diseases highlight the need and opportunity for health planners to develop integrated responses to communicable and non - communicable diseases .
background sub - saharan africa , like the rest of the world , is experiencing an increasing prevalence of diabetes alongside other non - communicable diseases [ 1 ] .
in 2010 12.1 million people were estimated to be living with diabetes in africa , and this is projected to increase to 23.9 million by 2030 [ 2 ] .
in sub - saharan africa this trend is emerging in a region grappling with high rates of communicable diseases - including the highest global prevalence of hiv [ 3 ] , tuberculosis [ 4 ] and malaria [ 5 ] .
diabetes is a component cause of several other important and often lethal diseases , both non - communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease [ 6 ] and renal disease [ 7 ] , and communicable diseases such as pneumonia [ 8 ] , bacteraemia [ 9,10 ] and tuberculosis [ 11 ] , which have considerable impacts on morbidity and mortality in the region [ 12 - 17 ]. with this double burden of disease and limited resources , diabetes must compete for political attention and financial investment. with various regional and international meetings and initiatives [ 18 ] , including the un high - level meeting on non - communicable diseases scheduled for 19 - 20 september 2011 , diabetes and other non - communicable diseases are beginning to get greater political attention .
policymakers need guidance from strong reviews of current information on trends and public health impact .
this review expands on recent reviews of diabetes in the region [ 19 - 21 ] , providing greater consideration of the diabetes prevalence , access to diabetes diagnosis and care , clinical outcomes following diabetes ( chronic diabetes complications , infections and mortality ) , and economic costs .
methods we conducted a systematic review of all papers published on diabetes in sub - saharan africa between january 1999 and march 2011 and available on pubmed .
we defined sub - saharan africa as all mainland african countries south of the sahara with the addition of the island state of madagascar .
we searched for articles providing data from this region on diabetes prevalence , diabetes outcomes ( chronic diabetes complications , infections , and mortality ) , access to diabetes diagnosis and care , and the economic burden caused by diabetes .
a combined keyword search on pubmed identified 1102 papers .
see additional file 1 : annex 1 for a description of the review and additional file 2 : annex 2 for the keywords used .
the references of included articles were scanned to identify additional articles of interest published before january 1999 .
grey literature , from sources including the websites of the world bank , world health organisation and international diabetes federation was also reviewed .
results the prevalence of diabetes in sub - saharan africa type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90 % of diabetes cases in sub - saharan africa [ 19 ] , whilst type 1 diabetes , gestational diabetes , and variant forms such as atypical ' ketosis - prone ' diabetes and malnutrition - related diabetes constitute the remainder .
type 2 diabetes just nine countries in the region have reported data from type 2 diabetes ( t2dm ) prevalence surveys in the last decade ( see table 1 ) [ 22 - 36 ] .
two of these countries have conducted population surveys with the assistance of the world health organisation 's ' stepwise approach to chronic disease surveillance management ' .
prevalence in the general population of t2dm recorded in these studies ranged from 0.6 % in rural uganda [ 35 ] to 12 % in urban kenya [ 27 ] .
a low to medium prevalence ( 0 - 7 %) was recorded in cameroon , ghana , guinea , kenya , nigeria , south africa and uganda and a very high prevalence (> 10 %) was recorded in zimbabwe ( table 1 ) .

variation in prevalence recorded within countries was common .
prevalence estimates varied considerably between different studies for some countries , with estimates for rural south africa ranging from 3.9 % [ 31 ] to 8.8 % [ 33 ] .
variation between urban and rural populations was frequently observed , with a higher prevalence recorded in urban populations [ 22,23,26,27,33,34 ] .
prevalence recorded in christensen 's kenyan survey ranged from 2 % in rural areas to 12 % in urban areas [ 27 ] .
one recent study investigated the incidence of type 2 diabetes in kinshasa among a cohort of 807 people , aged over 40 at baseline [ 37 ] .
93 participants developed t2dm during the study period ( december 2004 to september 2008 ) , corresponding to an incidence rate of 29 ( 95 % ci 15 - 43 ) per 1,000 person - years .
type 1 diabetes four studies estimating the prevalence and / or incidence of type 1 diabetes in the region were published since 1990 [ 38 - 41 ] ( see table 2 ) .
observed prevalence ranged from 3.5 per 100,000 persons in mozambique [ 40 ] , to 12 per 100,000 persons in zambia [ 40 ] .
recorded incidence ranged from 1.5 per 100,000 persons per year in tanzania [ 41 ] to 2.1 per 100,000 persons per year in ethiopia [ 39 ] .

three other relatively recent studies , published before january 1999 , were identified [ 44 - 46 ] .
the range of prevalence recorded in these five studies is considerable , from 0 % among pregnant women in tanzania to 9 % in ethiopia .

however , beyond describing their existence and aetiology , no studies investigating the population prevalence of these forms of diabetes in the region were identified .
outcomes of diabetes diabetes mortality three studies investigated mortality in patients with diabetes in the region , two of which were conducted almost twenty years ago ( table 4 ) .
these studies revealed high mortality proportions , with 5 - year mortality ranging from 4 % - 57 % [ 48 - 50 ] .
41 % of individuals with insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) died within five years in a study in tanzania , and half of these deaths were attributed to ketoacidosis [ 50 ] .
infection was another important cause of mortality , accounting for 48 % of deaths in indeterminate diabetes cases , 32 % in iddm and 23 % in non - insulin dependent diabetics ( niddm ) in the tanzanian survey [ 50 ] .

the prevalence of chronic diabetes complications among persons with diabetes twenty - three studies on the prevalence of chronic complications of diabetes among persons with diabetes published from 1999 - 2011 were reviewed ( see table 5 ) [ 51 - 74 ] .
the recorded prevalence of retinopathy ranged from 7 % in kenya [ 63 ] , to 63 % in south africa [ 67 ] , neuropathy ranged from 27 % in cameroon [ 52 ] to 66 % in sudan [ 54 ] , and the prevalence of microalbuminuria ranged from 10 % in tanzania [ 74 ] to 83 % in nigeria [ 73 ] .
some national variation was suggested , with recorded retinopathy rates ranging from 7 % to 22 % in kenya [ 63,64 ] .

a few smaller case - control studies have suggested that the prevalence of urinary tract infections is increased in diabetic patients in sub - saharan africa , as observed in developed countries [ 75 ] .
several reviews have described the frequent occurrence of gangrene , infection and sepsis associated with diabetic foot ulcer disease [ 76 ] and with trauma to the hand ( tropical diabetic hand syndrome ) [ 77 ] in sub - saharan africa .
access to diabetes diagnosis and treatment all of the type ii prevalence surveys which recorded proportions of previously undiagnosed diabetes among participants who attended screening programmes found very high levels (>= 40 %) .
proportions exceeded 50 % in five surveys , and reached 100 % in rural guinea [ 24 - 27,29,33 ] .
beran et al surveyed the availability of diagnostic testing tools in a sample of healthcare settings in three countries , and found that in mozambique urine glucose strips were available in just 18 % of health facilities surveyed , ketone testing strips in 8 % and blood glucose metres in 21 % , whilst availability in mali was 54 % , 43 % and 13 % and in zambia 61 % , 54 % , 49 % [ 40,78 ] .
low levels of adequate glucose control in diagnosed diabetics were reported in several prevalence studies [ 24,68 ] .
only 27 % of diagnosed type 2 diabetics receiving treatment in the cameroon study had adequately controlled glucose levels [ 24 ]. of 99 type 1 diabetics in the tanzanian survey , only one person achieved good glucose control [ 68 ] .
none of the 99 type 1 diabetics had the ability to monitor their glucose levels at home , and hospitals were unable to routinely do this [ 68 ] .
a regular supply of insulin was unaffordable for many diabetics , with one month 's insulin supply costing 19.6 days wages in malawi [ 79 ] and 25 % of the minimum wage in tanzania [ 80 ] .
one sudanese study found that 65 % of a families' annual household expenditure on health was spent on caring for a diabetic child [ 81 ] .
beran and yudkin found that state interventions affected insulin price , reporting that an annual supply of insulin cost 5 % of gdp in mozambique , where it was subsidised by the government , whereas it cost 25 % of gdp in mali without subsidies [ 78 ] .
one study investigated insulin availability and reported that one of five hospitals and none of six health centres surveyed had a regular insulin supply [ 40 ] .
economic costs of diabetes few studies were identified which investigated the cost of diabetes in the region .
kiriga et al ( 2009 ) estimated that the total economic cost ( direct and indirect ) of diabetes in the who 's africa region in 2000 was int $ 25.51 billion ( us $ 67.03 billion ) , or int $ 3363 ( us $ 8836 ) per person with diabetes per year [ 82 ] ( numbers converted from international dollars to their equivalent value in us dollars [ 83 ]) .
kiriga also estimated that the direct cost of treating diabetes in 2000 ranged from int $ 876 ( us $ 2302 ) to int $ 1220.6 ( us $ 3207 ) per person .
one study into the cost of caring for children with t1dm in sudan found that the mean annual expenditure on diabetes care was us $ 283 per diabetic child , 36 % of which was spent on insulin [ 81 ] .
a tanzanian study estimated that in 1989 - 1990 the total cost of outpatient care for all diabetic patients was us $ 2.7 million , of which insulin accounted for two - thirds of the expenditure , and total in - patient cost was us $ 1.25 million [ 84 ] .
as diabetes care in tanzania was provided free of charge to users this total cost of us $ 4 million was paid from the government health budget and accounted for 8 % of the government 's total health expenditure 1989 - 1990 .
a south african study investigated the cost of hyperglycaemic emergency admissions in south africa over a two month period in 2005 and reported an average cost r5309 , equivalent to us $ 712 , per admission [ 85 ] .
discussion prevalence of diabetes prevalence of type 2 diabetes the prevalence of t2dm appears to have increased considerably from that recorded in earlier ( pre - 1985 ) surveys conducted in the region , which found the prevalence in sub - saharan africa was typically below 1 % , with the exception of studies in south africa ( 3.6 %) [ 86 ] and the ivory coast ( 5.7 % ( zmirou , d .
1979 thesis , reported in mclarty et al 1990 and motala et al 2003 )) [ 87,88 ] .
however , many of these early studies may have underestimated prevalence , due to the use of low sensitivity screening methods and non - standardised diagnostic criteria [ 33,89,90 ] .
impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) and impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) are predictors of incident t2dm [ 91 ] .
thus , a high igt prevalence alongside a low t2dm prevalence may indicate the early stage of a diabetes epidemic [ 92 ] .
igt prevalence suggests that the t2dm prevalence is likely to increase further in several countries in the region , including cameroon , ghana and guinea ( table 1 ).. .
preventing obesity and increasing level of physical activity is important for reducing the onset of t2dm .
eight t2dm surveys measured the prevalence of obesity among participants , which ranged from 0.2 % among rural males in tanzania [ 34 ] to 21 % among females in urban cameroon [ 24 ] .
the ministry of health study in cameroon reported that controlling obesity and overweight levels would reduce diabetes by 15 % in males and 13 % in females [ 24 ] .
the comparatively higher prevalence of t2dm recorded in urban areas was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity among the urban samples and a lower proportion reporting regular physical activity [ 23,34 ] .
the projections that by 2025 70 % of africans will live in cities , with a regional annual urban growth rate of 4.5 % [ 93 ] , suggest that levels of obesity and t2dm diabetes will continue to rise in the region [ 19 ] .
prevalence of other types of diabetes as there is very limited data available on other forms of diabetes in the region it is difficult to describe trends .
given the small number and limitations of existing studies , it is not clear whether the very low incidence rates of t1dm of 1 - 2 per 100,000 are reliable .
all the existing studies based their estimates on previously diagnosed cases rather than population screening , and misdiagnosis and high community mortality may leave many cases unknown [ 20,39,68 ] .
this is supported by the observation that t1dm was often first diagnosed when patients presented at healthcare facilities with acute diabetic complications [ 48,85 ] .
similarly , more studies measuring the prevalence of gestational diabetes are needed to determine whether the observed variation from 0 to 9 % among pregnant women reflects true regional variation .
outcomes of diabetes mortality and chronic complications the three studies investigating mortality following diabetes found high proportions , and these may have been underestimates or overestimates due to sampling only selected diagnosed diabetic patients accessing healthcare .
more large - scale population - based studies are needed to explore whether the varying diabetes complication proportions in different countries reflect true variation .
small samples sizes and hospital - based recruitment limit the generalisability of these studies .
the observed high mortality in patients with diabetes and high prevalence of diabetes complications is likely to be a consequence of many late diagnosed and poorly controlled cases .
assessing the public health importance of diabetes demands an appreciation of the impact of diabetes on other diseases and population mortality , and in particular the benefits of well - controlled diabetes for averting costly cardiovascular and microvascular complications [ 7,94 ] .
the total cost of these complications is likely to far outweigh the cost of effective primary and secondary prevention .
infections potential associations between diabetes and important communicable diseases in the region , particularly tuberculosis and hiv , further complicate the pattern of increasing diabetes prevalence in sub - saharan africa and the challenges posed on resource - constrained health systems .
newer studies primarily outside sub - saharan africa provide evidence on such associations .
a recent meta - analysis of thirteen studies found that diabetes was associated with a 3.1 times elevated risk of tuberculosis [ 11 ] , and a systematic review of 9 studies found that this increased risk varied from 1.5 to 7.8 [ 95 ] .
studies have suggested that 20 % of smear - positive tuberculosis in india and 25 % of tuberculosis in mexico is attributable to diabetes [ 96,97 ] .
the increased risk of tuberculosis associated with diabetes may be largely attributed to poor glycemic control [ 98,99 ] .
unfortunately , proper epidemiological studies of the diabetes - tuberculosis association from africa are to our knowledge missing [ 100 ] .
meanwhile , the high prevalence of hiv and the roll - out of art may increase the prevalence of diabetes risk factors and consequently diabetes incidence .
antiretroviral therapy ( art ) for hiv , and to a small extent , hiv itself , is associated with an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome , which predisposes individuals to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 101 ] .
a range of metabolic changes have been associated with art , such as increased central obesity [ 101 ] , increased insulin resistance [ 102 ] , lipodystophy [ 103 ] , and dislipidemia [ 104 ] .
these changes have also been associated , although to a much lesser extent , with untreated hiv [ 102 ] .
one review found that prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients on art ranged between 18 and 33 % [ 105 ] .
evidence from other countries of the associations between diabetes and a range of other severe infectious diseases also deserves consideration .
type 2 diabetes is associated with a 25 - 75 % increased risk of pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia leading to hospitalisation [ 106 - 111 ] , and longer duration of diabetes , diabetes complications , and poor long - term glycemic control increase the risk [ 108,112 ] .
diabetes increases the risk of developing severe sepsis , with one study reporting a 2.5 - fold increased risk for hospitalization with sepsis in diabetic individuals compared to the general population [ 110 ] .
patients with diabetes mellitus have a two to three fold increased risk of bacteremia and sepsis originating from the urinary tract compared with those without diabetes [ 113 ] .
among 11 patients newly admitted with type 1 diabetes at a teaching hospital in nigeria , 9 ( 82 %) presented with urinary tract infection , malaria , or recurrent boils [ 114 ] .
bacteremia risk due to hemolytic streptococci and staphylococci is also increased two to three - fold in patients with diabetes [ 115 - 117 ] , and often originates from wound infections , which are an important health problem in the region [ 20 ] .
projections of future diabetes trends have not considered the potential impact of these associations which could affect the future diabetes burden .
consideration of the associations between diabetes and the other major communicable diseases in the region has been notably absent from the literature - both peer reviewed and grey literature .
it is vital that awareness of these associations is promoted so that complementary and integrated programmes in these disease areas can be planned [ 118 ] .
access to diagnosis and treatment the high rates of undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes recorded highlight the presence of significant barriers to accessing diagnosis and treatment .
the high rates of undiagnosed diabetes suggest that existing screening practices in the region are not effective .
given the reports that health centres lack the necessary diagnostic tools it is also likely that screening for diabetes is not routinely performed .
several important challenges to accessing diagnosis and treatment have been identified in the literature : the high financial cost of treatment , particularly insulin ; the limited availability of diagnostic tools , treatment and glucose monitoring equipment ; and a low awareness of diabetes among healthcare professionals which was reported by some authors [ 40 ] .
other important barriers may exist that have not yet been identified , as few studies have focused on this issue , and more information on the comparative importance of these factors is necessary to effectively target any interventions .
economic impacts of diabetes diabetes is an expensive disease , especially when the cost of complications , including the many diseases where diabetes is an underlying causal factor , is considered .
kiriga 's study highlighted the vast expense of treating diabetes in the who 's african region ; however the cost of complications were excluded from the study , and therefore this is a significant underestimate of total cost of diabetes .
kiriga estimated that the direct cost of treating diabetes in 2000 ranged from int $ 876 ( us $ 2302 ) to int $ 1220.6 ( us $ 3207 ) per person .
even at this level of direct cost , there is a significant discrepancy between the cost and available expenditure , as the international diabetes federation ( idf ) has estimated that in 2010 national funding for the healthcare of diabetics in africa is just us $ 111 per person , which already amounts to 7 % of national healthcare expenditure [ 119 ]. with limited national funding , individual patients and their families may have to spend significant proportions of their income on treatment for diabetes , a level of expenditure that may not be sustainable or affordable .
the sudanese study found that families spend an average of us $ 283 per year caring for their diabetic child , which amounted to 65 % of the family 's annual expenditure on health .
it is possible that in this scenario other health needs are overlooked in order to devote over 50 % of annual health expenditure to the one member of the family with diabetes .
the burden of t2dm is disproportionately borne by people of working age [ 120 ] , which is also the age - group most profoundly affected by hiv in this region .
reducing the economic activity of this group through disease and disability affects both household and national economies .
diabetes therefore not only imposes considerable costs of treatment on families , it also hinders their ability to pay for this treatment through the loss of income of the diabetic member .
at a national level an increasing prevalence of diabetes among the economically active , and the high prevalence of diabetic complications and low survival rates , will negatively impact economic development , and in turn the health budget .
information on the cost of diabetes , including the cost of the complications , is critical for policymakers to highlight the importance of introducing early and cost effective interventions for both primary and secondary prevention .
conclusion with increasing prevalence and interactions with other diseases , including the major communicable diseases of the region , diabetes is becoming a pressing public health problem for sub - saharan africa .
if effective interventions are implemented in the near - future it may be possible to avert much of this burden , as primary prevention and treatment can reduce the incidence of both diabetes and a range of related diseases where diabetes is a causal factor .
however , establishing timely and effective integrated diabetes programmes in the region requires a shift in current public health priorities , and this requires a much better evidence base - both to highlight the scale of the problem and the areas for intervention .
below are a set of recommendations for necessary action in order to address some of the knowledge gaps identified in this article .
as identified in the who 2008 - 2013 action plan for the global strategy on noncommunicable diseases , these tasks require comprehensive efforts from multiple stakeholders , including countries , international organisations , academic institutions , civil society and the private sector .
recommendations 1 .
countries , with the assistance from academic institutions , should ensure that local diabetes prevalence and incidence data are collected , for example through the recurring demographic and health surveys , to increase the availability of good information on current epidemiological trends .
2. academic institutions should collect regional and country - specific data on mortality , morbidity , costs , and access to diagnosis and care .
3. under the leadership of intergovernmental agencies such as the world health organization and the world bank , models should be developed to assess the public health impact of diabetes in relation to other important diseases , to enable informed prioritisation of available health funding at country level .
4. international agencies , civil society and the private sector should join forces and use their expertise and network to promote awareness of the interactions between diabetes and key communicable diseases in sub - saharan africa , to inform the development of integrated and complimentary service delivery programmes and health policies .
5. international agencies and civil society should establish peer - learning and experience - sharing discussion forums to promote development of feasible and cost - effective strategies and solutions for management and control of diabetes in sub - saharan africa .

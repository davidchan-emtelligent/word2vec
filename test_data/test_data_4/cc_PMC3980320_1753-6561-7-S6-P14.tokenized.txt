in contrast to classical mass spectrometers , the proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer ( ptr ms ) enables the noninvasive analysis of a broad spectrum of volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) in real time .
the thereby applied soft ionization technology generates spectra of less fragmentation and facilitates their interpretation .
this gave us the possibility to identify process relevant compounds in the bioreactor off - gas stream in addition to o2 and co2 .
in our study the ptr - ms technology was applied for the first time to monitor volatile organic compounds ( voc ) and to predict cell culture parameters in an industrial mammalian cell culture process .
materials and methods the aptitude of ptr ms for advanced bioprocess monitoring was assessed by chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cell culture processes producing a recombinant protein conducted in a modified 7l glass bioreactor ( applikon , shiedam , netherlands ) .
the ptr ms - hs ( ionicon , innsbruck , austria ) was equipped with a qms422 quadrupole for mass separation and with a secondary electron multiplier detector to measure masses ranging from 18 to 200m / z. the equipment set - up is illustrated in figure 1 .
on a daily basis the glutamine concentration was determined with the bioprofile 100 plus ( nova biomedical , waltham , ma ) and the viable cell density ( vcd ) was measured with the vi - cell xr cell counter ( beckham coulter , fullerton , ca ) .
samples for the product quantification were pulled daily and analyzed once at the end of a fermentation using affinity liquid chromatography .
the ptr - ms data was first filtered with an adaptive online repeated median filter [ 1 ] and then correlated to the cell culture parameters with partial least square regression ( pls - r ) using the software simca p12 + ( umetrics , umea , sweden ) .
figure 1 experimental set - up to monitor vocs in mammalian cell culture .
results the applicability of the ptr - ms technique was studied using eight different fermentations conducted during process optimization to determine key cell culture parameters such as viable cell density , product titer and glutamine by partial least square regression models .
probably the most important parameter in industrial cell culture processes is the viable cell density .
the r ( 2 ) of the pls - r model for the vcd was 0.86 and hence , lower compared to other methods found in literature ( such as 2d fluorescence [ 2 ]) .
especially low values , which were observed only in the first few days of the fermentation , showed a high prediction error .
at the beginning of the fermentation the voc composition in the off - gas is characterized by vocs from the media preparation ( probably impurities of the raw materials used ) and only a few voc can be assigned to the cells .
the media was prepared up to one week before the fermentations started and , depending on the storage time , the initial voc content varied .
within the first days the media assigned vocs were washed out and the cells started to produce vocs .
accordingly the effect of the initial condition was weaker and prediction got better .
in a second pls - r model the product concentration was estimated based on the ptr - ms data .
the model was better compared to the estimation of the vcd what is reflected in a r ( 2 ) of 0.94 .
the effect of the early process phase on the prediction quality is not very distinct since almost no product was produced in the first days .
the good model for the titer is a hint that producing the product is correlated with metabolic pathways involving vocs .
however distinct metabolic pathways could not be revealed within this study , since only a few voc could be assigned to specific compounds yet .
the third parameter assessed in this study was the glutamine concentration .
the pls - r model for glutamine concentration showed the lowest r ( 2 ) and q ( 2 ) of this evaluation .
glutamine was added on demand and probably feeding corrupted the correlation .
to overcome this problem , the glutamine related physiological parameter specific glutamine uptake ( qgln ) was used .
the descriptive as well as the predictive power was higher when the specific consumption instead of the glutamine concentration was used ( 0.91 and 0.82 ) .
an explanation for this result is that the consumption of glutamine might be correlated to other metabolic pathways which can produce vocs .
in combination with an accurate online vcd measurement , the qgln can be used to estimate the overall glutamine demand of the culture in real - time .
a summary of all pls - r models is given in table 1 .
table 1 summary pls - r models compound r ( 2 ) q ( 2 ) vcd 0.86 0.76 product titer 0.94 0.88 glutamine 0.83 0.62 specific glutamine uptake 0.91 0.82 conclusions in our study we showed that the voc profile obtained with the ptr - ms can be used to predict important cell culture parameters , but compared to other on - line techniques such as near infrared spectroscopy the pls - r models are currently less robust ( expressed by a lower r ( 2 )) .
moreover the most important vocs in the pls - r model could be used to get deeper insights into the cellular metabolism .
at the moment however , this is limited by the lack of identified vocs and the small literature basis reporting of pathways including volatile metabolites .
finally , further experiments will be necessary to assess the most influential factors on the voc production and to fully exploit the potential of the ptr - ms. acknowledgements we want to thank rene gutmann from ionicon for the installation and support for the ptr - ms and karl bayer for the fruitful discussions .

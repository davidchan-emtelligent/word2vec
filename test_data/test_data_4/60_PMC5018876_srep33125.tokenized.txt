to view a copy of this license , visit http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 / for this paper , a fully integrated and highly miniaturized electrochemical sensor was designed and fabricated on a silicon substrate .
a solvothermal - assisted reduced graphene oxide named " trgo " was then successfully micro - patterned using a lithography technique , followed by the electrodeposition of bismuth ( bi ) on the surface of the micro - patterned trgo for the electrochemical detection of heavy metal ions .
the fully integrated electrochemical micro - sensor was then measured and evaluated for the detection of cadmium and lead - heavy metal ions in an acetic - acid buffered solution using the square wave anodic stripping voltammetry ( swasv ) technique .
the fabricated micro - sensor exhibited a linear detection range of 1.0 mug l - 1 to 120.0 mug l - 1 for both of the metal ions , and detection limits of 0.4 mug l - 1 and 1.0 mug l - 1 were recorded for the lead and cadmium ( s / n = 3 ) , respectively .
drinking - water samples were used for the practical assessment of the fabricated micro - sensor , and it showed an acceptable detection performance regarding the metal ions .
heavy - metal - ion sensors are significant tools for environmental and food - analysis research because of the severe damage caused by toxic heavy metals to the organ systems of the human body1 .
among the known toxic metals , lead and cadmium have received particular recognition due to their toxicity and related environmental pollution2 .
low cost electrochemical sensors that can be operated easily have been developed for the detection of these and other heavy metal ions34 .
further , the use of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry ( swasv ) for heavy - metal - ion detection has gained popularity due to its effective selectivity and high sensitivity56 .
in most cases , mercury - film electrodes are preferred for their excellent stripping characteristics in heavy metal ions recognition .
however , the toxicity of mercury limits the applicability of these electrodes , especially in cases that involve water contact .
recently , the bismuth - film electrode was recognized as a promising substitute to the mercury electrode due to its low toxicity , large cathodic - potential range , and insensitivity to dissolved oxygen78 .
the sensitivity and low detection limit of bismuth - based electrochemical sensors are inadequate compared with those of conventional techniques such as atomic - absorption spectrophotometry , mass spectrometry , and inductively - coupled - plasma mass spectrometry9 .
therefore , the development of a heavy - metal - ion sensor with high sensitivity is significant for point - of - care detection .
previously , a large amount of work has been undertaken regarding electrode - surface modifications to increase the sensitivity of metal - detection methods10111213 .
among these works , the graphene - material - based working electrode has emerged as a promising alternative due to its unique thermal , mechanical , and electrochemical properties14 .
recently , reduced graphene oxide ( rgo ) has received increasing attention due to its applicability for the production of electronics , electrochemical , and biosensors151617 .
among different synthesis techniques for rgo , the solvothermal reduction of graphite oxide is the most attractive due to a simple setup for synthesis , sound scalability , and the ability to recover pi - conjugation networks at a high temperature and pressure1819 .
however , several problems arise from the solvothermal process .
first , unreacted reducing agent remains on the rgo surface20 .
to resolve this issue , rgo gel was treated in acidic solution to remove the reduction agent on the rgo sheet21 .
second , although rgo film directly patterned with a lithographic process is necessary for the development of high performing and miniaturized electrochemical sensors .
a reliable and simple micro - fabrication process has not been developed yet because the solvent used for rgo suspension can be easily reacted with some negative or positive photoresists .
in this work , a simple and reliable micro - fabrication process is developed for the micro - patterning of trgo film without affecting the electrochemical property of the film .
an epoxy negative photoresist ( su - 8 ) mold is applied for the lift off process of trgo due to its good chemical resistance such as being highly resistant to solvents , acids , and corrosive environments2223 .
after in situ deposition of the bismuth film on the working trgo / au electrode , a fully integrated heavy metal ions sensor with three electrodes is developed and characterized using swasv .
the fabricated sensor is small in size , cheap , and reliable in comparison with the existing and commercial sensors .
it also provides quick response and full device integration on various substrates .
results design and fabrication of the device the fabrication sequences of the heavy - metal - ion detection device on a silicon substrate are shown in fig. 1 ( a ) .
first , three different electrodes were patterned by using the wet - etching technique .
next , the trgo was patterned in macro - scale on the top of the working electrode using the thick photoresist as a sacrificial layer .
finally , commercial ag / agcl paste was screen - printed on the top of the au electrode surface as a reference electrode24 .
the gold paste sputtered on the substrate was used as the counter electrode .
photographs of the fabricated device are shown in fig. 1 ( b ) .
physical characterization of the trgo figure 2 ( a ) shows the surface morphology of the trgo / au electrode , whereby it is clearly observed that a rippled crumpling structure is on the trgo sheets .
this crumpling structure is supposedly caused by the reduction of the oxide groups in the rgo sheet .
an xps analysis was carried out to determine the functional groups that are contained in the trgo .
the typical c1s spectra for the trgo are shown in fig. 2 ( b ) .
five different peaks indicate a considerable degree of oxidation , corresponding to the carbon atoms in the different functional groups .
the peaks are centered at binding energies of 284.58 ev , 285.88 ev , 287.26 ev , 288.71 ev , and 290.74 ev. the peak at 284.58 ev corresponds to the non - oxygenated ring c involved in the c = c bonds for the production of sp2 hybridized carbon .
another peak ( 285.88 ev ) is from the sp3 hybridized carbon and includes the c - c bond .
the c in the c - o bonds ( 287.26 ev ) includes hydroxyl and epoxy groups , the c in the c = o bonds ( 288.71 ev ) includes carbonyl groups , and carbolic acids or ester groups are incorporated for the c in the o - c = o bonds ( 290.74 ev ) .
analytical performance of the sensor cyclic voltammograms ( scan rate = 50 mv / s ) of the modified trgo / au electrode and gold electrode in a 0.1 m kcl solution containing 5 mm [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - / 4 - are shown in fig. 3. on the au electrode , a pair of weak redox peaks was observed .
while on the trgo / au electrode , a pair of significantly - high peak currents was observed during the cv analysis .
the performance of the fabricated sensor can be evaluated by the shapes and positions of the redox peaks in a 0.1 m kcl solution containing 5 mm [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - / 4 - . groups of cv curves were obtained by measuring the current of the trgo working electrode using the fabricated electrode and a commercial reference electrode .
the reference electrode was calibrated against commercial ag / agcl ( 3 m nacl ) electrode ( figure s4 ) .
in order to check the stability , we performed cyclic voltammetry over 10 cycles .
figure s5 shows the cv curves of the 1st and 10th cycle .
the two cv curves are almost the same .
this indicates that the as - fabricated sensor shows good stability .
figure s6 shows the cv curves of the fabricated sensor at different scan rates ( 25 mv / s , 50 mv / s , 75 mv / s , 100 mv / s ) .
the shapes of all the cv curves are nearly identical and show clear redox peaks .
the peaks show regular gradient slopes with increasing scan rates , and there is no obvious potential shift between the peaks .
figure s7 shows the cv curves of the trgo working electrode before and after the patterning process .
these curves are nearly the same , which indicates that the patterning process did not damage the electrochemical performance of the trgo modified working electrode .
in addition , no residues from the su - 8 photoresist were found on the trgo layer , as clearly shown in the fesem image in figure s3 .
figure 4 ( a ) shows the swasv of a 200 mug l - 1 cd - and - pb - ion solution containing 600 mug of l - 1 bi ions on different electrodes .
the striping peaks on the bi / trgo / au - electrode - based sensor are higher than those on the au / bi - electrode - based sensor .
this improved performance could be due to the presence of the trgo , which offers abundant anchor sites for the deposition of heavy metal ions .
the as - fabricated bi / trgo / au electrochemical sensor was used for the detection of the cd and pb ions .
figure 4 ( b ) demonstrates the effect of deposition potentials that vary within a range of - 1.1 v to - 1.6 v on the stripping responses of the cd and pb ions at a deposition time of 150 s. when the deposition potential changed from - 1.1 v to - 1.6 v , the peak currents increased tremendously due to the more - complete reductions of the cd and pb ions .
the highest stripping peak was observed when a - 1.4 v deposition potential was used. with further negative shifting of the potential , the stripping response began to decrease gradually due to the enhancement of hydrogen evolution ; furthermore , the hydrogen evolution was partially suppressed by the deposition of alloys on the electrode surface .
a deposition potential of - 1.4 v was therefore selected during the electrochemical analysis of the sensor .
the investigation results for the effect of ph on the determination of the cd and pb ions are shown in fig. 4 ( c ) .
the ph of the buffer solution has an extreme influence on the formation of the bismuth - metal alloy25 .
as the best signals appeared at ph 4.5 , this ph level was used in subsequent experiments .
figure 4 ( d ) shows the influence of the stripping response on the deposition time within a range of 30 s to 250 s at a deposition potential of - 1.4 v. the peak currents increased linearly with the extension of the deposition time .
however , when the deposition time became longer than 150 s , the peak - current curve began to increase slightly in relation to the time , and this is probably due to the working electrode - surface saturation .
under the consideration of sensitivity , a determination time of 150 s was selected for the deposition of the ions .
calibration curves for the simultaneous determination of the cd and pb ions were investigated under the optimal conditions in 0.1 m of the acetate - buffer solution .
figure 5 ( a ) shows the stripping response of the as - fabricated device without any interference while the concentrations of the target metal ions were simultaneously increased from 0 mug l - 1 to 120 mug l - 1 .
the stripping - peak current and the concentrations of the cd and pb ions exhibited a favorable linear relationship .
for the cd ion ( fig. 5 ( b )) , the linear - regression equation is calibrated as icd ( current / mua ) = 0.01 + 0.045ccd ( concentration / mug l - 1 ) ( ccd = 0 - 120 mug l - 1 ) , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9828 ( r2 ) and a sensitivity of 0.05 +/ - 0.01 mua mug - 1l .
for the pb ion ( fig. 5 ( c )) , the linear - regression equation is calibrated as ipb ( current / mua ) = 0.02 + 0.065cpb ( concentration / mug l - 1 ) ( cpb = 0 - 120 mug l - 1 ) , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9922 ( r2 ) and sensitivity of 0.07 +/ - 0.01 mua mug - 1l .
further , the fabricated micro - sensor also possesses satisfactory detection limits ( s / n = 3 ) of 1.0 mug l - 1 for the cd ion and 0.4 mug l - 1 for the pb ion .
the detection limits are lower than those of the other reported works , including the bi nps / spce detection limits of 5 mug l - 1 for the cd ion and 2 mug l - 1 for the pb ion26 , the bi / au ( with motor ) detection limits of 0.7 mug l - 1 for the cd ion and 1.2 mug l - 1 for the pb ion27 , and the bi / ergno / spe detection limits of 0.5 mug l - 1 for the cd ion and 0.8 mug l - 1 for the pb ion28 .
to evaluate the feasibility of the fabricated sensor for routine analysis , this sensor was applied to detect cd and pb ions in a drinking - water sample .
figure 6 illustrates the typical stripping voltammograms of the device when used for drinking - water - sample analysis .
as shown , the stripping response for three standard additions exhibits good linearity , indicating the viability of the fabricated sensor in real sample analysis .
the sensitivities for the cd and pb ions are 0.06 +/ - 0.01 mua mug - 1l and 0.05 +/ - 0.01 mua mug - 1l , respectively .
the reproducibility of the fabricated micro - sensor was evaluated according to a repetitive measurement of 200 mug l - 1 for both ions .
the results show that our device is inexpensive and easily fabricated , while a wide range , low detection limit , and high sensitivity are also provided .
discussion the sound film - forming ability of trgo facilitates large surface coverage on the substrate , which is suitable for the large - scale production of trgo .
fesem images ( figs s1 and s2 ) show that the trgo covered all of the surfaces and is well patterned on the gold - coated substrate from the use of the developed technique .
figure s3 shows the fesem image of the trgo / au surface after lithography .
this figure clearly shows that there is no photoresist remaining on the trgo surface .
according to the xps - analysis data , the oxygenated peaks are much lower than the non - oxygenated peak .
these results indicate that a high - quality rgo was developed through the use of the proposed techniques .
in fig. 3 , a pair of weak redox peaks can be observed on the au electrode , whereas on the trgo / au electrode , a pair of significantly - high peak currents was found during cv analysis .
these results indicate that reaction reversibility is possible in the developed microelectrode and the active surface area is enlarged .
clearly , the improved performance could be attributed to the unique nano - structure29 .
the cv peaks on the anodic curve are different for au and trgo / au , while they are almost the same on the cathodic curve .
this result may be due to the efficient electrocatalytic activity of trgo , which facilitated the fast electron transfer kinetics30 .
the electrochemical behaviors of the pb and cd heavy metal ions are different in different electrolytes such as hcl , hno3 , hclo4 , n2so4 , acetate - buffer solution ( naac - hac ) , and phosphate - buffer solution ( na2hpo4 - nah2po4 ) .
among these electrolytes , the stripping performances of the cd and pb ions in 0.1 m of the acetate - buffer solution are the best due to the occurrence of well - defined peaks with the largest peak current31 .
to obtain the maximum sensitivity for the detection of heavy metal ions , this work investigated the effects of different parameters in 0.1 m of an acetate - buffer solution containing 200 mug l - 1 of the cd and pb ions .
the fabricated micro - sensor shows correlation coefficients of 0.9828 and 0.9922 for the cd ( fig. 4 ( b )) and pb ( fig. 4 ( c )) ions , respectively ; moreover , the fabricated micro - sensor exhibited satisfactory detection limits of 1.0 mug l - 1 and 0.4 mug l - 1 for the cd and pb ions , respectively .
lower detection limits could be achieved for both of the target metal ions by prolonging the detection time .
drinking - water samples were used to test the suitability of the proposed electrochemical sensor for real - life applications .
the sensor exhibited acceptable performance in terms of the detection of both cd and pb ions in drinking water .
in conclusion , a working bi / trgo / au - modified electrode based on a fully integrated electrochemical sensor was developed and subsequently used for a simultaneous swasv determination of cd and pb ions .
the developed sensor exhibited a high and sharp peak current for the target heavy metal ions due to the outstanding properties of the trgo film and the sound stripping characteristics of the bismuth film .
due to the unique properties of trgo , the fabricated device exhibited sound sensitivity and high stability with simple and green preparation methods .
methods materials and apparatus the standard solutions of all of the metals ( cd ion , pb ion , bi ion ) , the graphite powder ( 44 - mum size ) , the beta - d (+) glucose , the n , n - dimethylformamide ( dmf ) , the sodium acetate , ag / agcl paste ( als co , japan ) , and the glacial acetic acid were purchased from aldrich co .
( st. louis , usa ) .
acetate - buffer solution ( 0.1 m ) served as the supporting electrolyte for the detection of the heavy metals .
deionized water ( resistivity >= 18 momega.cm ) was used for all of the experiments and all of the electrochemical measurements were carried out in a 20 ml cell .
an electrochemical analyzer ( model 660d series , ch instruments inc. , usa ) was used for the electrochemical experiments on the fabricated electrode at room temperature .
a three - electrode system , including a fabricated electrode that functioned as a working electrode , was used , while an ag / agcl electrode with 3 m of nacl and a flat pt - bar electrode were utilized as the reference and counter electrodes , respectively .
the physical characteristics of the trgo and the sensor electrodes were investigated using high - resolution xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fesem ) .
synthesis of the trgo the graphite oxide was prepared using a modified hummer 's method32 .
trgo was synthesized using a modified hydrothermal reduction technique2133 .
briefly , 52 mg of the graphite oxide was added to 26 ml of deionized water , followed by ultrasonication for approximately 30 min .
the as - prepared mixture solution and 0.1 m of glucose were then mixed and the resultant mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h. next , the mixture was sealed in a teflon - lined autoclave and maintained at 180 degreesc for 2 h in a convection oven .
when the autoclave had cooled , the as - prepared gel was dispersed again in 1 m of an acetic - acid aqueous solution , after which time it was left for 5 h. finally , the mixture was washed with doubly - distilled water until a ph of 7 was reached .
it was then dried overnight in an oven at 90 degreesc under a vacuum .
fabrication of micro - patterned trgo / au - based electrochemical sensor figure 1 ( a ) shows the fabrication sequence of the proposed micro - sensor .
an insulation layer was first deposited on top of the silicon substrate .
after a cr and au film was sputtered on top of the sio2 layer , it was patterned with three different electrodes using the wet - etching technique .
next , the photolithography technique was used to cover the sample with an su - 8 photoresist , whereby the working electrode was excluded .
then , following drop - casting of 50 mul of the trgo suspension , the working electrode was dried in the air at room temperature for 2 h. next , the photoresist was removed from the sample using a pg - remover , and washed away with ipa and deionized water .
finally , ag / agcl paste was screen - printed on top of the reference au electrode and dried at 120 degreesc for 5 min .
figure 2 ( b ) shows a photograph of the fabricated heavy - metal - ion micro - sensor with the working trgo / au electrode .
measurement procedure the micro - sensor was applied using an in situ electroplating bi , whereby the fabricated device was immersed in 20 ml of a metal - ion standard solution .
the swasv analyses of the cd and pb ions were performed in 0.1 m acetate - buffer solutions in the presence of 600 mug l - 1 of bi3 + .
the sensing principle for the heavy metal ions using swasv is shown in figure s8 .
the swasv mode contains a time - controlled electrochemical deposition ( figure s8 ( a )) and a positively - applied - potential square - wave stripping scan ( figure s8 ( b )) .
the parameters are as follows : edep = 150 s ; teq = 20 s ; ebegin = - 1.4 v , eend = - 0.4 v , estep = 5 mv , eampl = 25 mv , and f = 25 hz. prior to the next cycle , a 60 s clean step at 0.1 v was performed to remove the residual bismuth .
a magnetic stirrer was used to stir the test solutions during the electrodeposition and cleaning steps .

background upper gastrointestinal bleeding with complicated factors is always difficult to find the primary origin .
case presentation here we present a case of a 74 - year - old male farmer suffered from acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric ulcer and mallory - weiss syndrome and chronic anemia which was at last found caused by hook worm infection .
conclusion it tells us that considering multi - possibility when can not explain the symptom with monophyletism is very important for clinicians .
background upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common in gi department , but the reasons for bleeding are sometimes complicated .
we present a case of a male old farmer who suffered from recurrent acute gastrointestinal bleeding with chronic anemia caused by hook worm infection. and this case gives us a lesson to consider multi - reason for bleeding when ca n't explain the symptom with one etiology. and it also tells us the necessity of recurrent urgent endoscopy .
case presentation a 74 - year - old farmer was evaluated for 5 hours of hematemesis and black stools .
he denied abdominal pain , or diarrhea , but admitted to take " fenbid , indometacin and metronidazole " because of toothache one day ago .
no abnormal past history .
he was afebrile with a pulse of 84 beats per minute , blood pressure of 14.7 / 9.3 kpa , respirations of 18 breaths per minute .
the abdominal exam was normal .
his hemoglobin value was 6.0 g / dl ( 13.9 - 18.0 g / dl ) , mcv 70.1 fl ( 82 - 92 fl ) , mch 21.0 pg ( 2.0 - 31.0 pg ) , mchc302.2 g / l ( 310 - 380 g / l ) , hct 0.209 ( 0.37 - 0.49 ) .
ob (++++) , liver and renal function and tumor markers were normal .
urgent upper endoscopy revealed an ulcer in the gastric angle sized 0.4 * 0.6 cm , and the ulcer was surfaced with white fur and vessel stump , without active bleeding ( fig 1 ) .
the patient was stable after fasting , proton pump inhibitor injection , blood transfusion and supportive treatment .
but on the morning of the fourth day , the patient felt nausea and vomited about 600 ml fresh blood with clot , with a pulse of 87 beats per minute , blood pressure of 13.9 / 8.4 kpa , and his hemoglobin value was 5.2 g / dl. keep the treatment strategy as before .
three days after his condition was stable , the patient was allowed to have fluid .
on the tenth day after admission , the patient felt nausea suddenly with hematemesis and melena .
the blood pressure at that moment was 8.0 / 6.9 kpa , and pulse was 100 beats per minute .
after 500 ml fresh plasma and 4 units packed red blood cell transfusion , the blood pressure rose back to 12.0 / 6.9 kpa .
figure 1 the esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a stage a1 gastric ulcer with bleeding .
because of recurrent active bleeding and failure of expectant treatment , surgery was considered next step .
upper endoscopy again before surgery found longitudinal laceration with bleeding in the region of the gastro - esophageal junction , and hook warm at the duodenal bulb ( fig 2 , 3 ) .
after hemostasis treatment under endoscopy and helminthicide treatment , the patient had no further bleeding and hemoglobin value recovered gradually and then was discharged .
figure 2 the esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed mallory - weiss syndrome .
figure 3 hook worm could be seen in the duodenal bulb through the esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
discussion acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common emergency of gi department .
the morbidity is 50 - 150 / 10 ^ 5 per year according to the bsg guideline 2002 , and about 80 % can be found the reason for bleeding ( table 1 ) .
the achievement ratio of hemostasis is becoming elevated accompanied with fast development of effective medicine and therapeutic methods of hemostasis under endoscopy .
table 1 etiology of upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
diagnosis percentage (%) peptic ulcer 35 - 50 erosion of stomach and duodenum 8 - 15 esophagitis 5 - 15 varicose vein 5 - 10 mallory - weiss syndrome 15 malignant disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract 1 vascular malformation 5 rare reason 5 cited from palmar kr. guideline gut 2002 for the patients whose first symptom presented as acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding , but were found chronic microcytic , hypo chromic anemia , it was especially important to consider multi - reason possibility .
in this case , chronic blood loss caused by hook warm infection could be the reasonable explanation of unmatchable small volume of hemorrhage at the beginning and heavy grade of microcytic , hypo chromic anemia .
the attachment of hookworms' cutting organs to the intestinal mucosa and submucosa and the subsequent rupture of intestinal capillaries and arterioles cause blood loss [ 1 ] .
males especially who are involved with agricultural pursuits as the patient in our case are more commonly infected with hookworm than females [ 2,3 ] .
the patient was diagnosed of upper gi bleeding because of gastric ulcer in the first upper endoscopy .
the ulcer might be induced by the medicine he took , but the ulcer was surfaced with white fur without active bleeding when being found .
hematemesis and melena and even shock presented recurrently after expectant treatment .
second endoscopy found mallory - weiss syndrome , which was mainly caused by intensive vomiting and retch. and sometimes it can cause fresh blood hematemesis and hemodynamic instability .
[ 4,5 ] both the ulcer and mallory - weiss with bleeding could be treated through the endoscope .
recurrent urgent upper endoscopy could not only advance the detective rate of etiology for upper gastrointestinal bleeding , but also carry out the hemostasis through it. conclusion a patient suffered from acute recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding accompanied with chronic anemia gave us a lesson that we should consider multi - reason existing when we could not explain the symptom with monophyletism .

breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and differs greatly among different patients ( intertumor heterogeneity ) and even within each individual tumor ( intratumor heterogeneity ) .
clinical and morphologic intertumor heterogeneity is reflected by staging systems and histopathologic classification of breast cancer .
heterogeneity in the expression of established prognostic and predictive biomarkers , hormone receptors , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 oncoprotein is the basis for targeted treatment .
molecular classifications are indicators of genetic tumor heterogeneity , which is probed with multigene assays and can lead to improved stratification into low - and high - risk groups for personalized therapy .
intratumor heterogeneity occurs at the morphologic , genomic , transcriptomic , and proteomic levels , creating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges .
understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity that are relevant to the development of treatment resistance is a major area of research .
despite the improved knowledge of the complex genetic and phenotypic features underpinning tumor heterogeneity , there has been only limited advancement in diagnostic , prognostic , or predictive strategies for breast cancer .
the current guidelines for reporting of biomarkers aim to maximize patient eligibility for targeted therapy , but do not take into account intratumor heterogeneity .
the molecular classification of breast cancer is not implemented in routine clinical practice .
additional studies and in - depth analysis are required to understand the clinical significance of rapidly accumulating data .
this review highlights inter - and intratumor heterogeneity of breast carcinoma with special emphasis on pathologic findings , and provides insights into the clinical significance of molecular and cellular mechanisms of heterogeneity .
breast cancer tumor heterogeneity histopathology biomarkers genetic markers introduction tumor heterogeneity is one of the hallmarks of malignancy .
intertumor heterogeneity is observed in breast carcinomas from different individuals .
intratumor heterogeneity is due to the presence of heterogeneous cell populations within an individual tumor ( 1 ) .
early reports defined tumor heterogeneity based on the identification of intratumor cell populations with different characteristics , including tumorigenicity , treatment resistance , and metastatic potential ( 2 - 4 ) .
although the heterogeneity of breast cancer at the cellular level was recognized already in the nineteenth century ( 5 ) , its clinical relevance was first established about 30 years ago , with the introduction of estrogen receptor ( er ) testing ( 6 ) .
variation in the expression of er among different tumors or distinct cell populations within a single tumor was thought to account for differences in clinical behavior and treatment response ( 6 ) .
currently , understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity that are relevant to the diagnosis , prognosis , and therapy of breast cancer is subject of intense research .
intertumor heterogeneity clinical and histopathologic heterogeneity intertumor heterogeneity of breast cancer is best illustrated by clinical staging of the disease based on physical examination and imaging findings .
the tnm staging system by the american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc )/ union for international cancer control ( uicc ) incorporates tumor size , regional lymph node status , and distant metastases ( 7 ) .
standard breast cancer treatment is based on the tumor characteristics , including clinical stage , histopathologic features , and biomarker profile , and is affected by the patient 's age , menopausal status , and general health ( 8 ) .
the aforementioned traditional clinicopathologic variables have a profound impact on survival , and account for most of the differences in clinical outcome among patients with breast cancer ( 9 ) .
the morphologic heterogeneity of breast carcinoma constitutes the basis for the histopathologic classification of breast cancer .
invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) of no special type or not otherwise specified ( nos ) is the most common ( 40 - 75 %) histologic type of invasive breast cancer .
albeit common , idc nos is not at all well defined , and the 2012 world health organization ( who ) classification defines idc nos by exclusion , as " the heterogeneous group of tumors that fail to exhibit sufficient characteristics to achieve classification as a specific histological type " ( 9 ) .
in addition to idc nos , the who classification includes 21 special subtypes with distinctive morphologic features , of which invasive lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) is the most frequent ( 5 - 15 %) ( 9 ) .
the other special subtypes of breast carcinoma are rare and differ significantly with regard to prognosis and response to adjuvant treatment ( 10 - 13 ) .
tubular , mucinous , and papillary carcinomas usually have excellent clinical outcome compared to idc and ilc ( 14 , 15 ) and are not always treated with chemotherapy ( 16 ). by contrast , metaplastic carcinoma and poorly differentiated idc nos have a significantly worse outcome and are routinely treated with systemic chemotherapy ( 9 ) .
the grade of breast carcinoma also highlights its tumor heterogeneity .
grade is assessed according to a 3 - tier ( low , intermediate , high ) system based on the evaluation of three morphologic parameters , namely the percentage of the tumor arranged in glands and tubular structures , the degree of nuclear pleomorphism , and the mitotic rate ( 17 ) .
the grade of breast carcinoma is a robust prognostic factor , and is incorporated in clinical decision - making tools , such as the nottingham prognostic index and adjuvant !
online ( 9 , 18 ) .
breast cancers of different grades also show different profiles by proteomic , genomic and transcriptomic analysis ( 19 - 21 ) .
in multivariate models that include gene signatures , grade remains an independent prognostic factor for er - positive tumors ( 22 ) .
grade 1 and 3 breast carcinomas likely represent two very different diseases , and molecular data indicate that the progression from low - to high - grade carcinoma is exceedingly rare ( 9 ) .
biomarker heterogeneity the expression of er , progesterone receptor ( pr ) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) is assessed routinely in all invasive breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) according to the recommendations by american society of clinical oncology / college of american pathologist ( asco / cap ) ( 23 , 24 ) .
the aforementioned biomarkers are established prognostic and predictive factors and their expression in breast carcinomas is critical in guiding patient treatment ( 8 , 25 ) .
estrogen receptor and pr are expressed in approximately 80 % and 60 - 70 % of breast carcinomas , respectively ( 26 , 27 ) .
although er - positive tumors co - express pr ( er +/ pr +) in 70 - 80 % of cases , some breast carcinomas are er +/ pr - or , rarely , er - / pr + .
the response to hormonal treatment also varies , with the best response ( approximate rate of 60 %) in er +/ pr + tumors and lower rates in er +/ pr - and er - / pr + tumors ( 9 ) .
the her2 oncoprotein is overexpressed in approximately 15 - 20 % of primary breast carcinoma as detected by ihc staining using the approved reagents , testing protocols , and scoring algorithm .
positive ( 3 +) her2 staining highly correlates with gene amplification ( 9 ) ; depending on the definition of her2 - equivocal ( 2 +) staining , approximately 10 - 20 % of her2 - equivocal breast carcinomas are found to be her2 - amplified by in situ hybridization ( ish ) .
her2 - positive breast carcinomas have the most unfavorable prognosis of all types of invasive breast cancers , but they show high rate of response to anti - her2 targeted therapy ( e.g. , trastuzumab , lapatinib ) ( 28 ) , as documented by the pathologic complete response post - neoadjuvant treatment in about 50 - 60 % of patients with her2 - positive tumors ( 29 ) .
breast carcinomas that do not express er , pr , and her2 , usually referred to as " triple - negative " breast carcinomas , constitute an extremely heterogeneous group histologically , genetically , prognostically as well as with regard to treatment response .
emerging data suggest that nuclear expression of the androgen receptor ( ar ) can be detected in 12 - 55 % of triple - negative ( er - / pr - / her2 - ) breast cancer ( 30 - 32 ) .
the prognostic significance of ar expression in triple - negative carcinomas is controversial , but it is associated with improved survival in other tumor subtypes ( 33 ) .
ongoing clinical trials evaluating ar antagonists ( such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide ) in ar + ( defined as nuclear staining in >= 10 % of tumor cells by ihc ) triple - negative breast carcinomas show promising results ( 31 , 34 ) .
ar positivity is associated with lower ki - 67 proliferation index , suggesting that ar may promote a stem - like or mesenchymal phenotype in this subset of tumors ( 32 ) .
no standardized assays or guidelines for evaluating the ar expression in breast carcinoma are available at present .
hundreds of other biomarkers have been investigated in breast cancer for potential diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic implications .
functional classification of these biomarkers includes growth and proliferation ( ki - 67 , survivin , ngal ) , invasion and metastasis ( p53 , mmp - 9 , sk1 , dcr3 , cox2 , ezh2 , micrornas mir - 105 , and mir126 ) , epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) ( wnt5a / b , pea3 ) , immune response ( pd - l1 ) , therapy resistance ( her2delta16 , psts3 , klk10 ) , survival ( mir - 574 - 3p , mir - 660 - 5p , piwil3 , piwil4 ) , and many others ( 35 ) .
the magnitude of the effect of tumor heterogeneity on biomarker expression or its clinical significance remains uncertain .
a systematic approach and standardized quantitative reporting of biomarkers is required to better guide therapeutic decisions .
genetic heterogeneity gene expression analysis classifies breast cancer into four major intrinsic molecular subtypes with prognostic and therapy implications : luminal a , luminal b , her2 - enriched , and basal - like ( 36 ) .
the luminal a and luminal b subtypes exemplify tumor heterogeneity within er - positive breast carcinomas and have better survival than her2 - enriched and basal - like subtypes .
both luminal subtypes express er , but the luminal b tumors are characterized by increased expression of proliferation - associated genes and have worse prognosis than luminal a tumors ( 37 ) .
the her2 - enriched subtype is characterized by increased expression of her2 and proliferation genes and includes er - / pr - / her2 + and er +/ pr +/ her2 + tumors .
the basal - like subtype is enriched for genes expressed in basal epithelial cells , and is triple - negative in 70 % of cases ( 36 ) .
additional subtypes include claudin - low tumors with stem - like signature ( 38 ) and ar - positive molecular apocrine tumors ( 39 ) .
meta - analysis of gene expression studies suggests that the prognostic impact of different signatures is related to the proliferation - associated genes ( 40 ) .
although gene expression profiles can predict response to chemotherapy and recurrence risk ( 41 ) , classification of breast carcinoma based on gene expression is hindered by clinical and molecular heterogeneity .
patients with breast carcinoma of the same molecular subtype and receiving identical treatments may have different clinical outcomes and / or acquire resistance to therapy ( 42 ) .
frequent (> 10 %) somatic mutations in tp53 , pik3ca , and gata3 have been documented in breast carcinomas ( 43 ) .
more recent studies have yielded other molecular subgroups , including a molecular classification based on integrated genomic and transcriptomic profiling of 2,000 breast tumors yielding 10 novel subtypes of breast cancer with distinct clinical outcomes ( 44 , 45 ) .
additional studies are needed to evaluate the practical clinical relevance and treatment implications of driver - based breast cancer classifications .
rna - based multigene expression assays have been developed to estimate recurrence risk in er - positive and / or lymph node - negative patients .
according to the asco clinical practice guidelines ( 8 ) , some multigene expression assays show sufficient evidence for clinical utility .
they include the 21 - gene assay oncotype dx ( 46 ) , the 11 - gene endopredict ( 47 ) , the 50 - gene assay prosigna based on the prediction analysis of microarray 50 model ( 48 - 50 ) , and the 7 - gene based breast cancer index ( bci ) ( 51 ) .
prosigna , bci , and endopredict predict late recurrence and subclassify tumors into molecular subtypes ( 52 ) .
oncotype dx is a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction - based assay , and quantifies the likelihood of early distant recurrence and chemotherapy benefit for patients with lymph node - negative , hormone receptor - positive , her2 - negative breast cancer ( 46 , 53 ) .
the risk of recurrence is expressed as a numerical value between 0 and 100 , referred to as recurrence score ( rs ) .
tumors are stratified into low risk ( rs <= 17 ) , intermediate risk ( rs 18 - 30 ) , and high risk ( rs >= 31 ) categories ( 46 ) .
in patients with tumors of rs <= 17 , the benefit of chemotherapy is quantified as too small ( 2 %) to outweigh its possible side effects. by contrast , patients with rs >= 31 greatly benefit from chemotherapy due to their increased ( 28 %) recurrence risk ( 54 ) .
the clinical management of intermediate risk patients is more varied and includes endocrine therapy with or without chemotherapy , depending on the patient 's clinicopathologic characteristics and individual preference .
two ongoing clinical trials aim to further stratify the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with intermediate rs who are clinically node - negative ( tailorx ) or node - positive ( rxsponder ) at presentation .
due to the costs , time and technical expertise required for molecular assays , ihc stains have been evaluated as possible alternative methods for indirect assessment of molecular subtype that can be used in most laboratories .
the ihc staining panel comprising er , pr , her2 , ki - 67 , epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) and cytokeratin 5 / 6 ( ck5 / 6 ) can identify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer with satisfactory and reproducible accuracy : ( 1 ) luminal a ( er +/ pr +/ - / her2 - / ki - 67 - ) ; ( 2 ) luminal b ( er +/ pr +/ - / her2 - / ki - 67 + ; with ki - 67 - positivity defined as >= 14 %) ; ( 3 ) luminal / her2 + ( her2 +/ er +/ pr +/ - ) ; ( 4 ) her2 + ( her2 +/ er - / pr - ) ; and ( 5 ) basal , including core basal ( er - / pr - / her2 - / egfr + or ck5 / 6 +) , and five - marker negative ( er - / pr - / her2 - / egfr - / ck5 / 6 - ) subgroups ( 55 , 56 ) .
considering that not all triple - negative tumors are basal - like and vice versa , and that er - positive luminal tumors are highly diverse , genetic heterogeneity of breast cancer is likely far more complex than our current understanding of this multidimensional issue or the existing molecular classifications .
development of assays integrating multigene tests with mutational or genomic profiles is required to better elucidate the interplay and clinical significance of prognostic and predictive molecular drivers in er - positive breast cancer ( 52 ) .
intratumor heterogeneity histopathologic heterogeneity morphologic intratumor heterogeneity can be appreciated as variability in different areas of tumor ( spatial heterogeneity ) , or as tumor progression over time ( temporal heterogeneity ) ( 1 ) .
spatial heterogeneity is readily appreciated in daily surgical pathology practice within a single tumor , but can also be detected between primary breast carcinoma and synchronous lymph node metastases , and even between synchronous metastases from different sites .
breast carcinomas with truly mixed morphology consist of two morphologically different components ( e.g. , idc and mucinous carcinoma ) , but other tumors exhibit ambiguous morphologic features ( e.g. , idc with lobular features ) or contain foci of distinct differentiation ( e.g. , idc with focal squamous / basaloid or spindle cell differentiation ) ( figure 1 ) .
morphologically distinct areas within individual tumors can be clonal with specific genetic aberrations ( 57 - 59 ) .
temporal heterogeneity includes evolution of an invasive tumor over time or in response to therapy ( 60 , 61 ) , development of asynchronous metastatic disease ( 62 , 63 ) and progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma ( 64 , 65 ) .

magnification : 100x ( a ) , 200x ( b - d ) ; hematoxylin - eosin staining .
although current clinical management of breast cancer is guided by histologic , ihc , and molecular characteristics of the primary tumor , treatment efficacy may be affected by altered morphologic and ihc features in metastases ( 1 , 66 ) .
discordance rates include 16 - 33.6 % for er , 32 - 40 % for pr , and 10 - 15.7 % for her2 ( 67 - 69 ) .
furthermore , women with discordant er - staining results between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma had a 48 % increased risk of death in one study ( 69 ) .
variability in biomarker expression between primary and metastatic tumors can be due to treatment ( 70 ) or may occur in the absence of therapeutic intervention ( 67 , 69 , 71 , 72 ) .
significant variations have also been reported in genomic heterogeneity ( 62 , 73 ) , single nucleotide or copy number variants ( 63 , 66 , 74 , 75 ) , and chromosomal rearrangements and insertion / deletions ( 75 ) .
due to insufficient evidence that changing treatment based on the altered biomarker status affects patient outcome , the current practice guidelines only recommend biopsying and retesting er / pr / her2 on accessible metastases if clinically indicated ( 76 ) .
biomarker heterogeneity expression of biomarkers can be highly variable within an individual tumor ( figure 2 ) causing interpretation problems and discordant results in small biopsies .
er / pr staining variations within a single tumor have long been recognized ( 77 , 78 ) .
the proportion of er / pr - expressing tumor cells in individual tumors varies from 1 to 100 % , and expression levels directly correlate with response to endocrine therapy ( 26 , 27 ) .
however , even tumors with very low levels ( 1 % of tumor cells ) may respond , justifying the use of the 1 % cutoff for er / pr - positivity by the asco / cap guidelines ( 23 ) .
nevertheless , this approach does not consider intratumor heterogeneity , accounting for limited clinical significance of classifying tumors with unequal distribution of er - expressing cells as er - positive ( 52 ) .
figure 2 biomarker heterogeneity of breast cancer : mucinous carcinoma ( a ) with variable expression of estrogen receptor from no immunoreactivity to nuclear staining with weak to strong intensity ( b ) ; invasive ductal carcinoma ( c ) with areas of 3 + ( positive ) and 1 + ( negative ) membranous staining for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( d ) .
magnification : 200x ( a - d ) ; hematoxylin - eosin staining ( a,c ) and immunohistochemistry ( b,d ) .
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) ihc staining and gene amplification can be highly heterogeneous ( 78 - 80 ) and affect disease - free survival ( 81 ) .
discrepant her2 ihc results ranges from 1 to > 50 % ( 79 , 82 , 83 ) , while the rate of gene amplification heterogeneity is 5 - 30 % ( 84 ). by ihc , her2 - positive tumors show complete , intense , circumferential membrane staining in 10 - 100 % of tumor cells ( 3 + staining ) .
some tumors exhibit incomplete and / or weak - to - moderate circumferential membrane staining in > 10 % of cells or complete , intense , circumferential membrane staining in <= 10 % of cells ( 2 + staining ) by ihc but gene amplification by ish ( 24 ) .
some cases have protein overexpression without gene amplification , amplification without protein overexpression , or marked intratumor heterogeneity .
although the asco / cap guidelines acknowledge heterogeneous amplification and recommend reporting separate areas ( 84 ) , detecting gene amplification in one area is sufficient to consider a tumor her2 - amplified .
this approach maximizes patient eligibility for targeted therapy without considering clinical implications of intratumor heterogeneity ( 52 ) .
other biomarkers with heterogeneous expression include egfr ( 85 ) , p53 ( 78 , 85 ) , c - myc ( 82 ) , and proliferation markers , including ki - 67 ( 78 , 85 , 86 ) , cyclin - d1 ( 82 ) , and pcna ( 87 ) .
ki - 67 is a non - histone nuclear protein expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except g0 .
it has been shown to have a prognostic and predictive value in both er - positive and er - negative breast carcinomas ( 88 - 90 ) .
however , expression levels of ki - 67 can be notoriously higher at the tumor periphery with variable staining throughout the tumor in the form of hot spots ( 91 ) .
furthermore , intratumor heterogeneity of ki - 67 expression can occur in breast carcinomas of various histologic subtypes and grades ( 86 ) .
several scoring systems have been suggested for the assessment of ki - 67 staining , including evaluating the hot spots alone , calculating the average score including hot spots , or even avoiding them altogether ( 91 ) .
in contrast to primary tumors , lymph node metastases have been reported to have a homogeneous distribution of ki - 67 expression .
moreover , metastatic tumor cells were highly proliferative and associated with ki - 67 levels in the highest expression hot spots in primary tumors .
this may reflect the temporal heterogeneity through clonal expansion of the primary tumor growth fraction with metastatic potential ( 92 ) .
it is unclear whether intratumor heterogeneity represents a true biologic phenomenon or a technical artifact due to poor fixation and / or processing ( 78 , 93 ) .
nonetheless , extensive sampling and ihc testing with adequate negative and positive controls are always prudent .
circulating tumor cells ( ctcs ) circulating tumor cells are cancer cells that detach from a primary tumor and circulate in the bloodstream during cancer progression ( 94 ) .
ctcs have been reported in 26 % of metastatic breast tumors ( 95 ) .
ctc count is an independent predictor of poor survival , treatment resistance , and early recurrence in some studies ( 96 - 104 ) .
however , practical application of ctc - based assays as " liquid biopsies " is limited by significant molecular and functional heterogeneity of ctcs ( 105 - 107 ) , including variability at the protein ( her2 , er , ki - 67 ) ( 76 , 108 - 114 ) and gene ( pik3ca ) levels ( 76 , 108 - 114 ) , and emt ( 115 , 116 ) .
during the process of emt , which is thought to precede the development of lymphovascular invasion and metastasis , the tumor cells lose epithelial characteristics , such as cell polarity , cell - to - cell adhesion , and expression of epithelial markers ( epcam ) , and acquire mesenchymal properties including motility and invasiveness ( 115 , 116 ) .
the presence of emt in ctcs indicates a poor prognosis ( 117 ) .
discordant her2 - expression in ctcs in particularly relevant ( 118 - 121 ) , and clinical trials ( detect , treat - ctc ) are underway to evaluate treatment options based on the her2 status of ctcs in metastatic breast cancer ( 122 , 123 ) .
heterogeneity in ctcs is thought to represent one of the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy ( 1 ) .
nonetheless , due to insufficient clinical evidence , the asco guidelines do not recommend changing therapy solely on the basis of ctc counts for monitoring treatment response ( 76 ) .
genetic heterogeneity breast cancer shows considerable intratumor heterogeneity with regard to chromosomal and genomic alterations ( 44 , 124 - 130 ) which affect many processes and functions , such as signaling pathways , antitumor immunity , cell senescence , migration and metastasis , angiogenesis , treatment response , and metabolic pathways ( 52 ) .
different cell clones can either segregate in different areas of the tumor or scatter and intermingle within the same area ( 131 ) .
complexity of intratumor genetic heterogeneity is best exemplified by a study of 100 tumors which identified driver mutations in > 40 cancer genes , including akt2 , arid1b , casp8 , cdkn1b , map3k1 , map3k13 , ncor1 , smarcd1 and tbx3 , and 73 combinations of mutated genes ( 129 ) .
intratumor genetic heterogeneity can be characterized by bulk sequencing and single - cell or single - molecule sequencing ( 132 ) .
bulk tumor sequencing cannot determine the cellular origin of molecular changes , location within tumors or the degree of heterogeneity , while single - cell sequencing cannot provide information on the remaining cell population , limiting their clinical use in clinical practice ( 52 ) .
an autopsy study comparing the molecular alterations in multiple synchronous metastases of breast carcinoma documented molecular evolution and clone selection of tumor cells in response to targeted treatment , and highlighted the challenges to targeted treatment posed by the complex molecular heterogeneity of metastatic disease ( 133 ) .
non - genetic ( epigenetic ) heterogeneity epigenetic heterogeneity is defined as modifications in gene expression without dna sequence changes ( 52 , 134 , 135 ) .
in breast cancer , epigenetic silencing through histone modification or dna methylation can affect tumor suppressor genes including p16ink4a ( 136 ) and rassf1a ( 137 ) , and er / pr / her2 ( 138 ) .
transient phenotypic variants of cells can also arise due to stochastic changes in the biochemical processes within cells ( 135 ) , which might involve changes in chromatin states or mrnas ( 139 ) and affect sensitivity to therapy ( 139 ) .
the clinical significance of non - genetic heterogeneity remains to be determined .
four mechanisms of breast cancer heterogeneity differentiation state of the cell - of - origin each mammary cell type has a specific molecular profile ( 140 , 141 ) .
tumor phenotype is determined by the combination of this differentiation state and the tumor - initiating genetic event .
distinct differentiation states of human mammary epithelial cells grown in cell cultures lead to different tumor subtypes in mouse xenografts ( 142 , 143 ) , e.g. , epcam + cells form epithelial tumors with variable er - positivity , while cd10 + cells are precursors of metaplastic carcinoma ( 144 ) .
multiple phenotypes can arise from one cell - of - origin depending on the initiating genetic event , e.g. , her2 - expression in luminal cells forms luminal tumors , while brca1 / 2 leads to basal differentiation ( 145 , 146 ) .
furthermore , expression of the same oncogene ( e.g. , pik3ca ) in luminal cells can lead to different tumor types ( 147 ) , while brca2 / tp53 depletion results in idc and metaplastic carcinoma in luminal cells , but myoepithelial carcinoma in basal cells ( 141 ) .
nevertheless , the final tumor phenotype does not always reflect the cell - of - origin ( 141 ) .
cell plasticity the equilibrium of cell states within tumors is maintained by dynamic bidirectional cell conversions between " cancer stem cells " ( cscs ) and non - cscs ( 148 ) .
cscs self - renew and form more stem cells , differentiated cells , and tumor cells ( 149 ) , while differentiated tumor cells can dedifferentiate ( 150 ) .
cell plasticity may involve emt and pik3ca - expression ( 147 , 151 , 152 ) .
genetic evolution of cancer tumorigenesis is a multi - step evolutionary process driven by darwinian selection of the fittest cells and genetic instability ( 149 , 153 ) .
although most tumors arise from a single cell due to the initiating genetic event (" driver mutation ") , cancer cells acquire additional aberrations during tumor evolution and , thus , each tumor contains multiple subclones harboring " passenger mutations " ( 132 ) .
cell plasticity and genetic evolution may overlap as cscs evolve and change in frequency due to clonal evolution during tumor progression ( 149 ) .
tumor microenvironment tumor stroma contains fibroblasts , blood vessels , and immunocompetent cells .
interactions between this non - cancerous microenvironment and tumor cells can contribute to carcinogenesis ( 154 ) , exemplified by decreased sensitivity of tumor cells to growth inhibitors ( 155 ) and suppressed tumor growth by microvasculature ( 156 ) .
clinical implications despite our improved understanding of complex phenotypic and genetic aspects of tumor heterogeneity , no significant clinical progress has been made with regards to incorporating this knowledge into effective diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic strategies for breast cancer ( 52 ) .
patients are managed based on the er / pr / her2 status of the primary tumor , and metastatic sites may not always biopsied for histologic confirmation or biomarker retesting ( 68 ) .
since " actionable " mutations in the initial tumor may no longer be responsible for tumor progression , it is essential to identify the dominant clones driving metastatic disease and treatment resistance ( 157 , 158 ) .
ideally , intratumor heterogeneity should be assessed by sequencing technologies at diagnosis for each patient , followed by monitoring of clonal dynamics during disease progression and treatment .
this will allow for the identification of genetic changes driving resistance as well as therapy adjustments ( 1 , 141 , 159 ) .
potential strategies to overcome treatment resistance include targeting driver mutations and deleterious passenger mutations , and modulating the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy ( 93 ) .
further well - designed studies are required to elucidate the clinical validity of rapidly accumulating data .

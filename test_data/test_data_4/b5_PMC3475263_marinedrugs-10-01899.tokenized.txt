three decades ago , the marine - derived compound sinularin was shown to have anti - edematous effects on paw edema induced by carrageenan or adjuvant .
to the best of our knowledge , no new studies were conducted to explore the bioactivity of sinularin until we reported the analgesic properties of sinularin based on in vivo experiments .
in the present study , we found that sinularin significantly inhibits the upregulation of proinflammatory proteins , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) and upregulates the production of transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) in lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - stimulated murine macrophage raw 264.7 cells according to western blot analysis .
we found that subcutaneous ( s.c. ) administration of sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) 1 h before carrageenan injection significantly inhibited carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors , including thermal hyperalgesia , mechanical allodynia , cold allodynia , and hindpaw weight - bearing deficits .
further , s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) significantly inhibited carrageenan - induced microglial and astrocyte activation as well as upregulation of inos in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord .
moreover , s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) inhibited carrageenan - induced tissue inflammatory responses , redness and edema of the paw , and leukocyte infiltration .
the results of immunohistochemical studies indicate that s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) could upregulate production of tgf - beta1 in carrageenan - induced inflamed paw tissue .
the present results demonstrate that systemic sinularin exerts analgesic effects at the behavioral and spinal levels , which are associated with both inhibition of leukocyte infiltration and upregulation of tgf - beta1 .
sinularin carrageenan inflammatory pain spinal neuroinflammation transforming growth factor - beta1 natural marine compound 1 .
introduction marine - derived compounds obtained from soft corals are believed to yield many potential candidate compounds for treating inflammatory diseases , particularly for treating pain [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
the natural marine compound sinularin ( figure 1 ) has been well - studied and was shown by weinheimer et al. in 1977 to have anticancer activity against the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line ( kb ) and the murine p388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line ( ps ) cell line from the soft coral sinularia flexibilis [ 5 ] .
in 1978 , kazlauskas et al. isolated sinularin from the same soft coral , but referred to the compound as flexibilide [ 6 ] .
later , in 1980 , buckle et al. reported that oral administration of sinularin reduced carrageenan - induced paw edema 3 h after carrageenan injection and that chronic oral sinularin inhibited adjuvant - induced paw swelling ( periarthritis model ) over a 21 - day period after adjuvant administration [ 7 ] .
after buckle et al. used rat models to show the anti - inflammatory activity of sinularin [ 7 ] , scientists explored other bioactivities of sinularin , such as its cardiovascular [ 8 ] and antimicrobial [ 9 ] activities .
sinularin was originally isolated from the soft coral sinularia flexibilis collected from hayman island on the great barrier reef of australia [ 5 ] .
using an in vitro anti - inflammatory assay system , we found that sinularin , isolated from the same genus but from a different species of soft coral , sinularia querciformis collected from dongsha islands off taiwan , significantly inhibited upregulation of proinflammatory proteins , particularly inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , in lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - stimulated murine macrophage raw 264.7 cells .
however , there are two important points regarding the bioactivity of sinularin that remain unclear .
first , no previous studies have explored the analgesic activity of sinularin .
second , potential mechanisms of sinularin 's anti - inflammatory activity remain unclear .
figure 1 chemical structure of sinularin ( 5,15 - dioxatricyclo [ 12.3.1.0 ( 4,6 )] octadec - 9 - en - 16 - one ) .
inhibiting inos and cox - 2 expression in lps - treated raw 264.7 macrophages can be used as an in vitro index for screening compounds with anti - inflammatory activity ; we previously succeeded in screening compounds from natural marine compounds using this in vitro system [ 1,4,10,11 ] .
using this in vitro system , we found that sinularin is a potential anti - inflammatory compound that has the ability to prevent inos and cox - 2 upregulation .
systemic inos and cox - 2 reportedly play key roles in inflammatory processes and in pain response .
expression of the inos and cox - 2 proteins was in carrageenan - induced inflamed rat paws ; additionally , inos and cox - 2 protein expression was not detected in the paw tissue of naive rats [ 1,12 ] .
systemic injection of an inos - selective inhibitor ( n - iminoethyl - l - lysine and aminoguanidine ) or a cox - 2 - selective inhibitor ( sc - 58125 ) inhibited carrageenan - induced paw edema [ 12,13 ] .
furthermore , carrageenan - induced thermal hyperalgesia can be reduced through systemic administration of the inos selective inhibitor ono - 1714 or the cox - 2 selective inhibitor sc - 58125 [ 13,14 ] .
therefore , we focused on whether a combination of systemic sinularin and inhibiting the induction of inos and cox - 2 in vitro has an antinociceptive and anti - inflammatory effect on carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors ( thermal hyperalgesia , mechanical allodynia , cold allodynia , and hindpaw weight - bearing deficits ) and histological changes .
spinal microglial and astrocyte activation are known to play important roles in nociceptive sensitization [ 2,3,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 ] .
many studies have shown that compounds exert their analgesic effects by inhibiting microglial and astrocyte activation [ 2,3,21,22 ] .
however , no studies have been conducted to examine the ability of sinularin to inhibit spinal microglial and astrocyte activation .
in the present study , we examined whether sinularin affects spinal microglial and astrocyte activation accompanied by nociceptive behaviors and elucidate possible anti - inflammatory mechanisms in a carrageenan - injected rat model .
additionally , we also examined the effect of sinularin on transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) under inflammatory conditions .
2. results 2.1 .
effect of sinularin on lps - induced inos , cox - 2 , and tgf - beta protein expression in macrophages we used western blot analysis to evaluate expression of pro - inflammatory proteins ( inos and cox - 2 ) and tgf - beta in the lps - stimulated raw 264.7 macrophage cells using whole cell lysates and 3 antibodies against mouse macrophage inos , cox - 2 , and tgf - beta , respectively ( figure 2 ) .
dose responses of sinularin for inhibition of lps - induced 130 - kda inos and 71 - kda cox - 2 and up - regulation of lps - induced 13 - kda tgf - beta are shown in figure 2 .
at 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 20 mum doses of sinularin , the levels of inos protein were significantly reduced to 53.45 +/ - 3.27 % , 36.45 +/ - 5.15 % , 33.38 +/ - 4.61 % , and 19.48 +/ - 3.95 % of the control level , respectively ( figure 2b ) .
at concentrations of 10 and 20 mum doses of sinularin , the level of cox - 2 protein were also reduced significantly to 82.72 +/ - 6.17 % and 66.23 +/ - 3.27 % of the control level , respectively ( figure 2c .
at 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 20 mum doses of sinularin , the level of tgf - beta protein were increased significantly to 137.75 +/ - 5.97 % , 149.82 +/ - 6.15 % , 142.71 +/ - 4.57 % , and 138.02 +/ - 5.15 % of the control level , respectively ( figure 2d ) .
therefore , three changes in protein levels take place at 10 mum and 20 mum doses of sinularin , including inhibition of inos and of cox - 2 as well as upregulation of tgf - beta .

the unit of scale bars shown in images a - h is in centimeter .
s.c. sinularin of 20 mg / kg and 80 mg / kg reduced levels of carrageenan - induced edema of paw , and s.c. sinularin 80 mg / kg also clearly inhibited redness induced by carrageenan in rats than that by 20 mg / kg sinularin .

2.2 .
effect of systemic sinularin injection on carrageenan - induced redness and edema of the paw according to the results in lps - stimulated raw 264.7 macrophages , we considered that 10 - 20 mum doses of sinularin both inhibit lps - induced inos and cox - 2 and upregulates lps - induced tgf - beta .
to estimate an effective in vivo dosage of sinularin , we used a previous formula developed by caraci et al. to calculate in vivo dosage for central administration based on in vitro dosage [ 23 ] , considering that the csf volume of a 300 g rat equals about 580 mul [ 24 ] .
hence , we estimated that the dosage of sinularin for central administration to a 300 g rat should be approximately 1.94 - 3.87 mug .
systemic dosage ( mg / kg level ) is well - known to be approximately equivalent to 1000 times of central dosage ( mug / kg level ) , so we supposed that the sinularin dosage for systemic administration to a rat was at least about 6.47 - 12.9 mg / kg. therefore , we selected two dosages of sinularin , 20 mg / kg and 80 mg / kg , administrated 1 h before carrageenan injection , for following preliminary tests .
we prepared the following 4 groups of rats : intraplantar ( i.p.l. ) saline plus subcutaneous ( s.c. ) vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide [ dmso ]) , i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. vehicle , i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin ( 20 mg / kg ) , and i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) groups .
at 6 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection , carrageenan caused visible redness and swelling of rat paw ( figure 3b,f ) compared with the i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle group ( 3a,e b,f ) , both s.c .
20 mg / kg ( 3c,g d,h ) sinularin inhibited carrageenan - induced paw edema ; moreover , s.c .
80 mg / kg sinularin also clearly reduced redness induced by carrageenan in rats that received 20 mg / kg of sinularin .
next , we chose a dose of 80 mg / kg for evaluating the anti - edematous effect of sinularin on i.p.l. carrageenan - induced paw edema .
we used 20 mg / kg indomethacin as a positive control [ 25,26 ] .
the time course of percentage change of increased paw volume induced by i.p.l. injection of carrageenan was inhibited by sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) or indomethacin ( 20 mg / kg ) ( figure 3i ) .
analysis of auc of the edematous effect - time curve also supports the anti - edematous effect of sinularin ( figure 3j ) .
based on the above findings , we selected a dose of 80 mg / kg of sinularin for following nociceptive behavioral testing .
2.3 .
effect of systemic injection of sinularin on the carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors of inflammatory pain no significant differences in the baselines were observed for paw withdrawal latency ( pwl ) , paw withdrawal threshold ( pwt ) , acetone response score , or change in hind paw weight distribution among the experimental groups before carrageenan injection .
average baselines for pwl , pwt , acetone response score , and changes in hind paw weight distribution were 28.59 +/ - 0.45 s ( n = 18 ) , 12.50 +/ - 0.52 g ( n = 18 ) , 16.75 +/ - 0.66 points ( n = 18 ) , and - 0.29 +/ - 1.10 g ( n = 18 ) , respectively .
as expected , thermal hyperalgesia ( pwl = 10.69 +/ - 1.72 s ; n = 6 ) , mechanical allodynia ( pwt = 1.20 +/ - 0.26 g ; n = 6 ) , cold allodynia ( acetone response score = 3.33 +/ - 0.79 points ; n = 6 ) , and hindpaw weight - bearing deficits ( change in hind paw weight distribution = 84.63 +/ - 1.50 g ; n = 6 ) of the carrageenan - injected paw peaked at 3 - 6 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection ; these nociceptive behaviors of inflammatory pain persisted for at least 24 h ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 presents the time course of analgesic effects of s.c .
80 mg / kg sinularin : anti - thermal hyperalgesia ( figure 4a , anti - mechanical allodynia ( figure 4b ) , anti - cold allodynia ( figure 4c , and anti - weight - bearing deficits ( figure 4d ) , respectively .
sinularin groups exhibited extended antinociceptive effects until at least 24 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection , while s.c. injection of vehicle ( 100 % dmso ) did not affect carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors .
additionally , s.c. indomethacin ( 20 mg / kg ) also significantly inhibited these i.p.l. carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors until at least 24 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection .
in the present study , carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin - treated rats ( 20 and 80 mg / kg ) did not exhibit any obvious side effects regarding external behavior , including locomotor function , during treatment .
we then focused on the period of 24 h after s.c .
80 mg / kg of sinularin to determine whether inhibition of spinal neuroinflammatory processes are consistent with the antinociceptive effects of sinularin based on two primary considerations .
first , these four i.p.l. carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors continued to 24 h after carrageenan injection .
second , s.c. administration of 80 mg / kg sinularin at 24 h after carrageenan injection retained antinociceptive efficacy .

effect of systemic sinularin injection on carrageenan - induced spinal nociceptive sensitization spinal tissue was collected at 24 h after carrageenan injection from the lumbar enlargement ( l2 - l4 ) for a spinal immunohistofluorescence assay of neuroinflammatory markers .
ox - 42 - , gfap - , or inos - immunoreactive cells were scattered throughout the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal gray matter of i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle ( figure 5a,d,g ) , i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. vehicle ( figure 5b,e,h ) , and i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) ( figure 5c,f,i ) groups .
compared with i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle group , the immunoreactivity of ox - 42 ( figure 5b ) , gfap ( figure 5e ) , and inos ( figure 5h ) of i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. vehicle group were upregulated 24 h after carrageenan injection .
carrageenan - induced upregulation of ox - 42 ( figure 5c and inos ( figure 5i ) were significantly inhibited by s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) .
quantification results of ox - 42 ( figure 5j ) , gfap ( figure 5k ) , and inos ( figure 5l supported that inhibition of carrageenan - induced upregulation of spinal neuroinflammatory markers are consistent with the antinociceptive effects of sinularin .
to explore the possible effects of sinularin on carrageenan - induced peripheral inflammatory responses , we then focused on the site of rat 's inflamed paw by histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry assay .

effect of systemic injection of sinularin on the carrageenan - induced tissue inflammatory responses and tgf - beta1 protein expression in paws histopathological examination was conducted to evaluate tissue inflammatory responses .
biopsies of paws were taken from the following groups : i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle , i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. vehicle , and i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) groups at 24 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection .
no inflammation or tissue destruction was observed in the paws of i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle - treated rats ( figure 6a in contrast , as previously reported [ 1 ] , we observed that i.p.l. carrageenan caused infiltrating cells ( leukocytes ) populated enlarged cavities resulting from tissue erosion ( figure 6b ) .
treatment with sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) clearly inhibited carrageenan - induced leukocyte infiltration ( figure 6c,d ) .
to detect tgf - beta1 protein expression in paws , we used paw sections at 24 h after i.p.l. saline or carrageenan injection from i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle , i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. vehicle , and i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) groups .

3. discussion 3.1 .
summary in the present study , we found that sinularin significantly inhibits upregulation of the proinflammatory proteins inos and cox - 2 and upregulates production of the anti - inflammatory protein tgf - beta in lps - stimulated murine macrophage raw 264.7 cells .
next , we found that s.c. administration of sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) 1 h before carrageenan injection significantly inhibits carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors as well as thermal hyperalgesia , mechanical allodynia , cold allodynia , and hindpaw weight - bearing deficits .
immunohistofluorescence analyses revealed that s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) also significantly inhibits carrageenan - induced spinal neuroinflammation , upregulation of microglial and astrocyte immunohistochemical activation markers ( ox - 42 and gfap ) and inos in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord .
moreover , s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) inhibit carrageenan - induced tissue inflammatory responses , redness and edema of the paw , and leukocyte infiltration .
immunohistochemical observations suggested the ability of s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) to up - regulate production of tgf - beta1 in carrageenan - induced inflamed paw tissue .
these present results demonstrate that the marine - derived compound sinularin has anti - inflammatory and analgesic properties in in vitro and in vivo inflammatory models , respectively .
3.2 .
analgesic effects of s.c. sinularin at behavioral and spinal level in rat models of intraplantar carrageenan - induced acute inflammatory pain , common carrageenan dosages are between 1 % and 2 % in a volume of 100 mul [ 13,14,25,27 ] .
we selected 1.5 % carrageenan for the present study based on our previous practical experience [ 1 ] .
central sensitization of the spinal cord dorsal horn contributes to hypersensitive pain behaviors of inflammatory pain such as hyperalgesia ( thermal hyperalgesia ) , allodynia ( mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia ) , and spontaneous pain ( weight - bearing deficits ) [ 28 ] .
we also confirmed these nociceptive behaviors in a rat model of intraplantar carrageenan , which peaked at 3 - 6 h and persisted for 24 h after i.p.l. carrageenan injection .
spinal neuroinflammation , primarily characterized by activation of microglia and astrocytes and overexpression of proinflammatory mediators ( such as inos ) in the cns [ 3,29 ] , may accelerate central sensitization and result in the development and maintenance of pain [ 30,31 ] .
upregulation of immunoreactivity of spinal dorsal horn ox - 42 ( microglial marker ) and gfap ( astrocyte marker ) indicate elevated nociceptive states [ 2,3,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 ] ; however , little information is available regarding acute inflammatory pain models of intraplantar carrageenan at common dosages .
only one report showed that intraplantar injection of carrageenan ( 100 mul , 2 %) can upregulate ox - 42 and gfap in the ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn of rats 4 h after carrageenan injection , but xu et al. did not directly mention or measure this phenomenon [ 27 ] .
our immunohistofluorescence analyses clearly showed carrageenan - induced upregulation of ox - 42 and gfap immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral dorsal region of the lumbar spine at 24 h after carrageenan injection .
additionally , similar to results observed in mice [ 32,33 ] but not in rats , we observed upregulation of spinal inos immunoreactivity in 24 h after carrageenan injection .
in summary , upregulation of spinal ox - 42 , gfap , and inos immunoreactivity may reflect the level of nociception in carrageenan - induced inflammatory pain in rats .
we found that s.c. sinularin significantly inhibited carrageenan - induced spinal neuroinflammation , including upregulation of spinal ox - 42 , gfap , and inos immunoreactivity , 24 h after carrageenan injection .
thus , based on the results of inhibition of elevated nociceptive states indicators ( behavioral testing and spinal immunohistofluorescence ) , we concluded sinularin attenuates nociceptive sensitization in inflammatory pain rats .
3.3 .
potential analgesic mechanisms of sinularin after tissue injury , production of inflammatory mediators causes migration of leukocytes into local inflamed tissue , amplifying the inflammatory response [ 34 ] .
systemic administration of the leukocyte inhibitor colchicine suppressed carrageenan - induced paw edema [ 12,35 ] ; moreover , specific inhibition of leukocyte migration reduced carrageenan - induced mechanical hypernociception by systemic fucoidin [ 36 ] .
we also found that s.c. sinularin inhibited carrageenan - induced paw edema and nociceptive behaviors accompanied leukocyte infiltration 24 h after carrageenan injection .
therefore , the beneficial effects of sinularin may partially result from its ability to lower the level of tissue inflammation , such as reducing swelling responses and inhibiting leukocyte infiltration .
in addition to inhibiting lps - induced inos and cox - 2 , sinularin also resulted in up - regulation of tgf - beta , generally known as the anti - inflammatory cytokine under certain pathological conditions , in lps - stimulated macrophages .
several previous studies have shown that tgf - beta1 has anti - inflammatory effects in lps - stimulated macrophage cells [ 37,38,39 ] .
although the carrageenan - injected paw is a well - characterized inflammatory pain model , only 3 studies have examined tgf - beta1 expression in serum [ 40,41,42 ] , and there are no reports regarding local tgf - beta1 expression at the inflammation site in the paw .
compared with decreased serum tgf - beta1 [ 41,42 ] , we observed increased tgf - beta1 immunoreactivity in carrageenan - induced inflamed paw tissue .
systemic diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , prevented a peripheral inflammation - induced decrease of serum tgf - beta1 [ 41 ] .
we also observed that s.c. sinularin ( 80 mg / kg ) may up - regulate tgf - beta1 immunoreactivity in carrageenan - induced inflamed paw tissue compared with the saline plus vehicle and carrageenan plus vehicle groups .
indeed , systemic tgf - beta1 was shown to have protective functions involving anti - inflammatory effects in collagen - induced arthritis in mice [ 43 ] .
the analgesic effects of sinularin have been associated with both inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and upregulating tgf - beta1 , which participate in lowering the level of local tissue inflammation .
3.4 .
advantages and future studies of sinularin based on the present study , there are three advantages of sinularin : low toxicity , no steroid or opioid backbone , and an adequate supply of the compound .
although we did not observe contralateral inflammatory responses in the present experiment , there were no obvious external behavior side effects of carrageenan and sinularin treatment in rats ( 20 and 80 mg / kg ) , which is consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo reports [ 7,8 ] .
because the chemical structure of sinularin does not contain a steroid or opioid backbone but was shown to exhibit anti - inflammatory and analgesic activity in the present study , this is important and valuable feature would favor drug development .
sinularin is a major compound in the soft coral genus sinularia [ 44 ] , and there is thus an adequate supply of compound .
supply often limits development opportunities for in vivo bioactivity studies of other minor marine - derived compounds .
moreover , the soft coral genus sinularia has been successfully cultured in the national museum of marine biology and aquarium ( nmmba ) , taiwan [ 45 ] .
our present study highlights 2 future studies , which are described below .
first , the 80 mg / kg dose of sinularin relieved carrageenan - induced nociceptive behaviors of inflammatory pain , although sinularin dose used in the present study appears to be high ; thus , the structure of sinularin should be modified in order to improve its anti - inflammatory activity and analgesic properties followed by additional structure and activity relationship ( sar ) studies .
second , we only observed the ability of s.c. sinularin to up - regulate tgf - beta1 production in inflamed paw tissue , but the detailed mechanism regarding the modulation effects of sinularin on the tgf - beta1 pathway require further investigation .
additionally , we showed that tgf - beta1 upregulation may be an in vitro or in vivo indicator for searching for natural compounds with analgesic activity .
the marine - derived compound sinularin was shown to have anti - inflammatory activity three decades ago [ 7 ] , and no new studies have explored other bioactivities of sinularin .
thus , we hope that the present study involving sinularin will stimulate further study in the field of marine drugs .
4. methods and materials 4.1 .
chemicals the marine natural compound sinularin ( 5,15 - dioxatricyclo [ 12.3.1.0 ( 4,6 )] octadec - 9 - en - 16 - one ; figure 1 ) was isolated from the soft coral sinularia querciformis collected from the dongsha islands near taiwan .
we purchased dmso and carrageenan lambda from sigma co. , ltd .
( st. louis , mo , usa ) and indomethacin from cayman chemical co .
( ann arbor , mi , usa ) .
4.2 .
in vitro anti - inflammatory assay we performed an in vitro anti - inflammatory assay according to the method described in our previous study [ 1,4,10,11 ] .
we obtained murine raw 264.7 macrophages from the american type culture collection ( atcc , no tib - 71 ) .
after incubating macrophage cells for 16 h in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ; contains 10 % heat - inactivated fetal - bovine serum ( fbs ) , 1 mm pyruvate , 2 mm glutamine , 4.5 g / l glucose , 50 mug / ml streptomycin , and 50 u / ml penicillin under standard conditions in a 37 degreesc humidified atmosphere of 5 % co2 : 95 % air ) containing only lps ( 0.01 mug / ml ; sigma l2654 ) , an in vitro inflammatory state was induced in the macrophages .
for the anti - inflammatory activity assay , sinularin ( 0.1 , 1 , 10 , or 20 mum ) was added to the cells 5 min prior to the lps challenge .
next , cells were washed with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) , lysed with ice - cold lysis buffer ( 1 mug / ml aprotinin , 150 mm nacl , 100 mug / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 50 mm tris , ph 7.5 , 1 % triton x - 100 ) , and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 x g at 4 degreesc .
the supernatant was decanted from the pellet and retained for western blot analysis to detect the presence of inos , cox - 2 , and tgf - beta .
protein concentrations of whole cell lysates were determined with the dc protein assay kit ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) using a method modified from lowry et al .
[ 46 ] .
4.3 .
western blot analysis to determine the presence of inos , cox - 2 , and tgf - beta we performed western blot analysis using our published method [ 2 ] .
an equal volume of sample buffer ( 0.1 % bromophenol blue , 10 % glycerol , 2 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , and 50 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.2 ) was added to whole cell lysates ( supernatant ) , which was then electrophoresed on a tricine sds - polyacrylamide gel at 150 v for 90 min .
proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane ( immobilon - p ; millipore corporation , billerica , ma , usa ; 0.45 - mum pore size ) in transfer buffer ( 380 mm glycine , 20 % methanol , 1 % sds , and 50 mm tris - hcl ) at 125 ma overnight at 4 degreesc .
the pvdf membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5 % non - fat dry milk in tris - buffered saline ( ttbs ; 137 mm nacl , 20 mm tris - hcl , 0.1 % tween 20 , ph 7.4 ) , and then incubated for 180 min with antibodies against inos ( 1:1000 dilution ; bd pharmingen , san diego , ca , usa ; catalog no .
6103322 ; polyclonal antibody ) , cox - 2 ( 1:1000 dilution ; cayman chemical , ann arbor , mi , usa ; catalog no .
160106 ; polyclonal antibody ) , or tgf - beta ( 1:1000 dilution ; abcam , cambridge , uk ; catalog no .
ab66043 ; polyclonal antibody ) proteins at room temperature .
the inos , cox - 2 , and tgf - beta antibodies were used to identify bands at approximately 135 , 70 , and 13 kda , respectively .
immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ecl kit ; millipore ) .
bands were visualized and photos were acquired using the uvp biochemi imaging system ( uvp llc , upland , ca , usa ) and relative densitometric quantification of immunoreactive bands was performed using labworks 4.0 software ( uvp llc ) .
pvdf membranes were re - probed using an anti - beta - actin antibody as a loading control ( monoclonal mouse antibody , 1:2500 dilution ; catalog no. , a5441 ; sigma ) .
relative variations between the bands of sinularin - treated samples and lps - treated samples were calculated using the same images .
4.4 .
carrageenan - induced paw edema and behavioral testing male wistar rats ( 285 - 300 g ) with free access to food and water were housed within a temperature - controlled ( 22 +/ - 1 degreesc ) room with a 12 - h / 12 - h light / dark schedule .
in accordance with the guiding principles in the care and use of animals of the american physiology society , experiments involving rats were approved by the national sun yat - sen university and use committee .
every effort in experimental design and execution was made in order to minimize the number of rats used and to minimize their suffering .
paw edema was induced by i.p.l. injection of 1.5 % sterile carrageenan lambda in 100 mul of saline into the right hind paw [ 47 ] .
sinularin or indomethacin was dissolved in dmso and delivered in a volume of 300 mul in preparation for s.c. administration to rats .
vehicle ( dmso ; 300 mul ) , sinularin , and indomethacin were administrated 1 h before i.p.l. carrageenan injection .
4.4.1 .
paw edema paws were marked in order to assist in replication of the positioning in the measurement chamber using a method described in our previous report [ 1 ] .
increases in paw volume were measured using a paw volume meter ( plethysmometer ; singa technology corporation ) and calculated by deducting the basal paw volume ( before i.p.l. carrageenan injection ) from the paw volume measured at each time point ( after i.p.l. carrageenan injection ) .
to simplify the data analysis for statistical purposes , the auc of the edematous effect - time curve for the plot of paw edema versus time was computed using the trapezoidal method [ 48 ] from 0 to 24 h after i.p.l. carrageenan plus s.c. administration of vehicle , sinularin , or indomethacin .
4.4.2 .
thermal hyperalgesia to test thermal hyperalgesia , we used an iitc analgesiometer ( iitc inc. , woodland hills , ca , usa ) as described previously by hargreaves et al .
[ 49 ] and our previous study [ 1 ] .
briefly , rats were placed in compartments of clear plastic cages on top of an elevated glass plate .
a heat stimulus was positioned and directed onto the middle of the plantar surface using a radiant heat source with low - intensity heat ( active intensity = 25 ) until the rat exhibited a positive sign of pain behavior ( licking or withdrawal ) .
pwl ( in seconds ) was measured with a cut - off time of 30 s as the average of 2 measurements per paw .
4.4.3 .
mechanical allodynia to assess mechanical allodynia , we measured the pwt ( in gram ) using calibrated von frey filaments ( stoelting , wood dale , il , usa ) .
rats were placed in compartments of clear plastic cages on top of an elevated metal mesh floor , permitting easy access to the rats' paws .
a series of von frey filaments of logarithmically incremental stiffness were applied to the midplantar region of the rat hindpaw from below the mesh floor using chaplan 's " up - down '' method involving the use of alternate larger and smaller fibers to determine the closest filament to the threshold of pain response ( licking or withdrawal ) as described previously by chaplan et al .
[ 50 ] and by our previous study [ 3 ] .
4.4.4 .
cold allodynia we placed the rats in the same apparatus ( individual plastic compartments on an elevated metal mesh floor ) as that described for the mechanical allodynia test .
pain responses of rats were monitored for 1 min after acetone application ( 25 mul ) at the center of the plantar surface of a hindpaw and were graded according to a 6 - point scale , modified from a 4 - point scale used in previous studies [ 51,52 ] : 5 , no response ; 4 , withdrawal , flick or stamp of the paw more than 2 s after acetone application ; 3 , quick withdrawal , flick or stamp of the paw in 2 s after acetone application ; 2 , quick and more violent withdrawal , flick or stamp of the paw within 2 s of acetone application ; 1 , prolonged withdrawal or repeated flicking of the paw within 2 s of acetone application ; 0 , repeated flicking of the paw with persistent licking the paw within 2 s of acetone application .
acetone response scores for each rat were then obtained by summing the four individual scores ; the minimum possible score was 0 points ( repeated flicking and licking of paws on each of the four trials ) and the maximum possible score was 20 points ( no response to any of the four trials ) .
4.4.5 .
weight - bearing deficits rats were placed on an incapacitance tester ( singa technology corporation , tw ) with their hindpaws centered on two force transducers for measuring the weight distribution between the rat 's hind limbs as described in our previous study [ 53 ] .
under normal conditions , naive rats distribute their weight equally between both hind limbs ; however , following induction of limb inflammation ( such as i.p.l. carrageenan injection ) , rats redistribute their weight to reduce weight applied to the affected limb [ 54 ] .
changes in hind paw weight distribution ( in gram ) are expressed as the difference between the affected limb ( the right hind limb ) the normal limb ( the left hind limb ) measured at the same time point .
two or 3 recordings were taken for each rat to determine the average of measurements at each time point .
4.5 .
spinal immunohistofluorescence assay using the spinal immunofluorescence method described in our previous study [ 2,3 ] , to diminish variations in immunohistochemical procedures , lumbar spinal cord tissues from different groups were mounted on the same oct block and sectioned together on a cryostat at - 30 degreesc ( hm550 ; microm , waldorf , germany ) .
the 10 - mum sections were then incubated with the monoclonal antibody ox - 42 ( cd11b , microglia marker , 1:200 dilution ; serotec ltd. , oxford , united kingdom ) , gfap ( astrocyte marker , 1:200 dilution , cat .
131 - 17719 ; molecular probes , eugene , or , usa ) , or anti - inos ( 1:200 dilution ) overnight at 4 degreesc , followed by alexa fluor 488 - labeled chicken anti - mouse igg antibody ( 1:400 dilution ; molecular probes ; catalog no. a - 21200 ; green fluorescence ) or dylight 549 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit igg ( 1:400 dilution ; jackson immunoresearch laboratories inc. , west grove , pa , usa ; catalog no .
711 - 506 - 152 ; red fluorescence ) for 40 min at room temperature .
for immunostaining analysis , stained spinal sections were examined using a leica dm - 6000 cs fluorescence microscope ( leica instruments inc. , wetzlar , germany ) .
all immunofluorescence images of ox - 42 , gfap , and inos were acquired using a spot xplorer digital camera ( diagnostic instruments , inc. , sterling heights , mi , usa ) .
immunofluorescence data were acquired at 100x magnification , then pixel values of the immunoreactive - positive area were counted using image j software ( national institutes of health , bethesda , md , usa ) using three sections per rat , and expressed as a percentage change compared to the i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle group , which were considered to be 100 % .
4.6 .
histopathology and immunohistochemistry of paw tissues for histopathological examination , we modified a method used in our previous study [ 1 ] .
after rats were perfused intracardially with 500 ml of cold pbs containing heparin ( 0.2 u / ml ) and 1 % sodium nitrite followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde in 500 ml of 0.1 m pbs ( ph 7.4 ) , paw samples were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin , soaked in decalcifying solution for 30 h , and then stocked in 10 % formalin prior to following processing .
rat paws were bisected longitudinally , then placed in embedding cassettes for dehydration , clearing , and infiltration by automatic tissue processor ( tissue - tek , sakura finetek japan co. , ltd. , japan ) , embedded into a paraffin block by tissue embedding center ( ec780 - 1 ; ec780 - 2 , csa ) , and cut into 2 - mum sections using a rotary microtome ( hm340e , microm ) .
paw sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) for histopathological examination .
for immunohistochemistry , after deparaffinization of the paw sections , endogenous peroxidase of the paw sections was quenched with 0.3 % h2o2 in 60 % methanol for 30 min , and then permeabilized using 0.1 % triton x - 100 in pbs for 20 min .
to minimize nonspecific adsorption , paw sections were incubated with 5 % normal goat serum in pbs for 30 min .
paw sections were incubated overnight at 4 degreesc with anti - tgf - beta1 ( 1:200 dilution ; abcam , cambridge , uk ; catalog no. ab92486 ; polyclonal antibody ) antibody .
to detect specific labeling , paw sections were incubated with biotin - conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg and avidin - biotin - peroxidase complex ( vectastain abc kit ; vector laboratories inc. , burlingame , ca , usa ) .
finally , paw sections were incubated with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( dab ) ( vectastain abc kit ; vector laboratories ) for 5 min .
we analyzed all slides of the paw sections for histopathology and immunohistochemistry under a leica dm - 6000 cs microscope ( leica instruments inc. , wetzlar , germany ) and a microscope digital camera system ( spot idea 5 mp cmos scientific color digital camera system ; diagnostic instruments ) .
immunohistochemical data were acquired at 100x magnification , measured for their individual pixel values of the positive area using metamorph imaging system software ( molecular devices , downington , pa , usa ) using three sections per rat , and expressed as a percentage change compared to the i.p.l. saline plus s.c. vehicle group , which were considered to be 100 % .
4.7 .
data and statistical analysis all data are shown as means +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
for statistical analysis , differences between groups of macrophage cell lines or rats were calculated using one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , followed by the student - newman - keuls post hoc test .
we defined statistical significance as p < 0.05 .
5. conclusions the in vitro anti - inflammatory activity of sinularin was associated with inhibition of inos and cox - 2 and upregulation of tgf - beta .
further , the analgesic properties of sinularin in in vivo experiments have not been previously reported .
the present study shows that systemic sinularin exerts its analgesic effects at the behavioral and spinal levels , which are associated with both inhibition of leukocyte infiltration and upregulation of tgf - beta1 .

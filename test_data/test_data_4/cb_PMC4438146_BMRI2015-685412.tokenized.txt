we read with great interest the review article by fan et al .
[ 1 ] that discusses a range of microsurgical techniques used for vascularization and neurotization in bone tissue engineering .
not only the lack of vascularization but also the lack of neurotization within tissue engineered bone can lead to insufficient ossification resulting in treatment failure .
since we have been working in the research area of vascularized bone tissue engineering for many years , we are aware of the problem of generating an optimal prevascularized scaffold for large and poorly vascularized bone defects .
one of the main obstacles remains an adequate vascularization and thus survival of implanted cells or , with regard to the manuscript by fan et al. , of nerve tracts , especially in the center of scaffolds .
as mentioned by fan et al. in a range of studies it could be demonstrated that sensory nerve innervation can contribute to bone integrity and bone formation [ 2 - 4 ] .
chen et al. demonstrate that sensory nerves could enhance the osteogenesis of tissue engineered bone .
sensory nerves or blood vessels were implanted with a scaffold directly in the defect site [ 3 ] .
fan et al. emphasize that an optimal support with oxygen and nutrients is of fundamental importance for the survival of the neurocytes .
for optimization and constructing the vascularized and neurotized tissue engineered bone simultaneously both blood vessel and the nerve tract should be implanted together in the bone graft [ 1 ] .
another way for engineering vascularized tissue is the prevascularization of constructs distant to the injury site in unharmed areas of the body using the intrinsic vascularization with an arteriovenous ( av ) loop that was firstly described by erol and spira [ 5 ] .
after a sufficient prevascularization period osteogenic cells such as osteoblasts or nerve tracts can be implanted without being lost through inadequate supply of oxygen or nutrients .
tissue engineered constructs can afterwards be microsurgically transplanted in the defect site independent of the local vasculature .
in a previously performed study in the rat av loop model space holders were placed in the scaffold during the prevascularization period , leaving holes for subsequent injection of cfda - labeled osteoblasts .
a significantly higher number of cfda - positive cells and a higher expression of bone specific markers were detected in the prevascularized scaffolds compared to control , indicating this technique to be well suited to support bone formation and the probable survival of implanted cells .
nevertheless , moving from bench to bedside , the large animal sheep av loop model was established , and we were able to generate intrinsically vascularized tissue in a clinically relevant size ( volume 15 cm ( 3 )) .
for faster vascularization and consequently better nutritional support of implanted cells , we modified the av loop model using a perforated chamber .
combining extrinsic and intrinsic vascularization , enhancement of angiogenesis could be demonstrated in the small and large animal [ 6 ] ( figure 1 ) .
connection between both vascular pathways allows the microsurgical transplantation of the vascularized bone construct .
based on the results of our studies , we have previously used the av loop successfully for the reconstruction of large bone defects in two patients [ 7 ] .
to pave the way for further preclinical testing , the efficient implantation of a sensor nerve tract by fan et al. should be proofed in a large animal and combined with the intrinsic - extrinsic large animal av loop model .
for minimizing hypoxic - dependent cell death , the nerve tract could be implanted after an adequate prevascularization period or close to av loop vessels .
we agree with fan et al. that further studies must be performed to find efficient therapies for large and complicated bone defects , in order to make wide clinical application possible .

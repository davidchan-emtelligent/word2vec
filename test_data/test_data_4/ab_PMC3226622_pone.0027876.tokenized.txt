there is association between exposure to estrogens and the development and progression of hormone - dependent gynecological cancers .
chemical carcinogenesis by catechol estrogens derived from oxidative metabolism is thought to contribute to breast cancer , yet exact mechanisms remain elusive .
malignant transformation was studied in mcf - 10a human mammary epithelial cells , since estrogens are not proliferative in this cell line .
the human and equine estrogen components of estrogen replacement therapy ( ert ) and their catechol metabolites were studied , along with the influence of co - administration of selective estrogen receptor modulators ( serms ) , raloxifene and desmethyl - arzoxifene ( dma ) , and histone deacetylase inhibitors .
transformation was induced by human estrogens , and selectively by the 4 - oh catechol metabolite , and to a lesser extent by an equine estrogen metabolite .
the observed estrogen - induced upregulation of cyp450 1b1 in estrogen receptor negative mcf - 10a cells , was compatible with a causal role for 4 - oh catechol estrogens , as was attenuated transformation by cyp450 inhibitors .
estrogen - induced malignant transformation was blocked by serms correlating with a reduction in formation of nucleobase catechol estrogen ( nce ) adducts and formation of 8 - oxo - dg. nce adducts can be formed consequent to dna abasic site formation , but nce adducts were also observed on incubation of estrogen quinones with free nucleotides .
these results suggest that nce adducts may be a biomarker for cellular electrophilic stress , which together with 8 - oxo - dg as a biomarker of oxidative stress correlate with malignant transformation induced by estrogen oxidative metabolites .
the observed attenuation of transformation by serms correlated with these biomarkers and may also be of clinical significance in breast cancer chemoprevention .
introduction with an average lifetime risk of 8 - 10 % , breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the western world .
longer exposure to estrogens predisposes women to develop hormone - dependent gynecological malignancies .
a central role for circulating hormones in breast cancer development is further supported by the marked reduction in cancer incidence after surgical or chemical ovariectomy .
direct action of estrogen has been shown to cause malignant transformation of normal breast epithelial cells in culture , even when these cells are unresponsive to classical estrogen receptor ( er ) mediated proliferation [ 1 ] .
malignant phenotypes of the breast arise as a result of a series of mutations , most likely in genes associated with tumor suppressor , oncogene , dna repair , or endocrine function .
chemical carcinogenesis resulting from estrogen oxidative metabolism to quinoid metabolites is associated with electrophilic and oxidative damage to dna .
typical dna damage includes formation of stable adducts , nucleobase oxidation , formation of abasic sites , single strands breaks , mutations such as g - - > t transversions , loss of heterozygosity , and epigenetic changes .
formation of the catechol estrogens , 2 - ohe and 4 - ohe , is catalyzed by the action of cyp450 enzymes , most importantly cyp450 1b1 - mediated formation of the genotoxic 4 - ohe ( figure 1 ) .
dna modification by the carcinogenic 4 - ohe quinone is known to cause depurination leading to abasic sites and nucleobase catechol estrogen ( nce ) adducts .
in contrast , dna adducts formed by 2 - ohe quinone are proposed to be chemically stable , not generating appreciable amounts of abasic sites [ 2 ] .
together with receptor - mediated , or hormonal carcinogenesis , by estrogen and estrogen metabolites , the genotoxic o - quinone metabolites of estradiol ( e2 ) and estrone ( e1 ) are argued to be initiators and promoters of breast cancer via chemical carcinogenesis ( figure 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027876.g001 figure 1 estrogens ( e1 and e2 ) undergo oxidative metabolism to c2 and c4 catechols .
catechols are further oxidized to form o - quinones .
based on t1 / 2 and reactivity , the most mutagenic species is 4 - ohe1 / 2 and its further oxidized species .
4 - ohe - 3,4 - o - quinone ( shown in red ) can redox cycle to form ros , oxidize dna ( measured as 8 - oxo - dg ) , alkylate dna ( form abasic sites , and stable adducts ) , and chemically modify other important macromolecules such as dntp , gsh , and cellular proteins .
estrogen replacement therapy ( ert ) remains a cornerstone of contemporary women 's healthcare , despite outcomes from the women 's health initiative clinical trials that reported the elevated risks of breast and lung cancer associated with ert [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
these trials also confirmed the benefits of ert including reductions in osteoporotic fractures , and adverse postmenopausal symptoms , highlighting the need for new ert agents with minimized cancer risk .
selective estrogen receptor modulators ( serms ) , such as the benzothiophene serms , raloxifene and arzoxifene , have the potential to fill such a need [ 6 ] .
an ideal serm would provide estrogenic agonist activity in bone , the cardiovascular system , and the central nervous system , whilst exerting antagonist activity in the breast and uterus [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
it was therefore of interest to study malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells induced by the components of ert and modulated by benzothiophene serms .
since the actions of histone deacetylase ( hdac ) and serms has been linked and hdacs are in clinical trials for breast cancer [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , hdac inhibitors ( hdacis ) were also of interest .
the non - tumorigenic mcf - 10 cell line has the morphological characteristics of normal breast epithelial cells [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ; in response to extended treatment with e2 , anchorage - independent growth was induced , a phenotype of malignant transformation , strongly correlated with tumorigenicity [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
cyp450 1b1 was implicated since protein expression was upregulated by estrogen treatment .
the objectives of this work were : firstly to study malignant transformation of a mammary cell line , modeling estrogen - induced chemical carcinogenesis resulting from ert and to examine the influence of serm and hdaci co - administration ; and , secondly to examine the correlation of malignant transformation with biomarkers of cellular electrophilic and oxidative stress .
the biomarkers investigated , nce adducts and 8 - oxo - dg , were elevated by estrogens and attenuated by serm co - treatment .
results malignant transformation of mcf - 10a cells induced by estrogens and metabolites treatment of mcf - 10a immortalized , human breast epithelial cell cultures with e2 or the catechol metabolite 4 - ohe2 , for four weeks , led to significantly increased cellular transformation as assessed by anchorage - independent colony growth performed in soft - agar for a further four week - period ( figure 2a ) .
the comt ( catechol o - methyl transferase ) inhibitor , ro 41 - 0960 , would be expected to block methylation and deactivation of the catechol estrogen ( figure 1 ) and to increase the extent of cellular transformation , however , the observed increase , when the inhibitor was co - administered with 4 - ohe2 did not reach significance compared to 4 - ohe2 alone .
in a similar way , cells were treated with equilenin ( en ) , and its oxidative metabolite formed on cyp450 1b1 action , 4 - ohen ( 4 - hydroxyequilenin ) .
co - treatment of 4 - ohen with comt inhibitor , proved to be cytotoxic to mcf - 10a cells over the 4 - week treatment period , therefore , in the case of the equine estrogens , the product of comt mediated methylation , 4 - meoen ( 4 - methoxyequilenin ) , was studied .
4 - ohen caused significant cellular transformation compared to vehicle control , whereas en and 4 - meoen did not reach significance .
the equine estrogens were less potent inducers of cellular transformation than human estrogens as measured by anchorage - independent colony growth .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027876.g002 figure 2 malignant transformation induced by endogenous and equine estrogens : mcf - 10a cellular transformation induced by estrogens and metabolites was measured as anchorage - independent growth in soft agar after four weeks. a. cells were treated with estrogens or metabolites ( 1 microm ) and comt inhibitor ro 41 - 0960 ( ro , 3 micromol ) for 4 weeks before transfer to soft agar .

the observation of greatest transformation induced by the 4 - oh - catechol estrogen metabolites is compatible with a causal role for cyp450 1b1 in mediating cellular transformation , therefore , mrna and protein levels for this enzyme were measured in response to treatment with e2 .
cyp450 1b1 was upregulated in response to e2 as demonstrated by mrna ( figure 3a ) and protein levels over the one week course of e2 treatment ( figure 3b ) .
cyp450 1a1 and 1b1 catalyze estrogen oxidative hydroxylation at the c2 and c4 positions , respectively , therefore , transformation of mcf - 10a cells was studied after extended treatment with 2 - ohe1 or 4 - ohe1 , and for comparison , the parent estrogen , in this case e1 ( figure 1b ) .
treatment with 2 - ohe1 did not significantly induce transformation , moreover , co - treatment of cells with e1 and the cyp450 inhibitor , alpha - naphthoflavone ( alphanf ) , a non - competitive cyp450 1b1 inhibitor ( ki = 2.8 +/ - 0.5 nm ) , completely ablated cellular transformation .
although alpha - nf inhibits other cyp450 isoforms , the simplest conclusion is that inhibition of cyp450 1b1 - mediated oxidation of estrogens to the 4 - oh catechols and their o - quinones by alpha - nf blocks transformation by preventing formation of these oxidative metabolites .

evidence for er - independent mechanisms that may contribute to chemoprevention by benzothiophene serms has been reported by ourselves and others [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
hdac inhibition has been reported to synergize actions of serms in breast cancer cells and hdacis are in clinical trials [ 12 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
co - treatment of mcf - 10a cells with the hdacis , saha or tsa , did not attenuate estrogen - induced cellular transformation ( figure s1 ) , therefore combinations were not explored .
however , both benzothiophene serms , dma and raloxifene significantly attenuated estrogen - induced cellular transformation , ablating the effects of estrogen ( figure 4a , 4b ) .

purine nce adduct formation a preliminary experiment was performed to detect purine nce adducts in the media from mcf - 10a cells at the end of the fourth week of treatment with e2 or 4 - ohe2 , the latter with or without comt inhibitor ( figure 5 ) .
media was subjected to solid phase extraction before assay by lc - ms / ms , in which mrm ( multiple reaction monitoring ) analysis of the appropriate mass transition ( parent ion m / z and fragmentation to the appropriate purine m / z ) was used to indicate the presence of the appropriate nce adduct .
n3 - me - guanine and n7 - me - guanine were used as internal standards for relative quantitation .
this preliminary analysis demonstrated the presence of 4 - ohe1 - gua , and 4 - ohe2 - gua adducts , and adducts were not detected in vehicle treated media .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027876.g005 figure 5 biomarker study of guanine nce adducts measured in supernatant of cells treated with e2 and catechol metabolites ; guanine adducts correlate with transformation potency .
guanine nce adducts of 4 - ohe1 were measured in media from mcf - 10a cells treated with : e2 1 microm , 4 - ohe2 1 microm , or ( 4 - ohe2 1 microm + ro 3 microm ) at week 4 .
these nces adducts were not detectable in vehicle control experiments .
n7 - me - guanine ( 5 nm ) was used as internal standard .
mrm fragmentation patterns of nces ( m / z - - > m / z ) corresponded to : gua nce adduct 1 4 - ohe1 - gua ( 436 - - > 152 ) ; gua nce adduct 2 4 - ohe2 - gua adduct ( 438 - - > 152 ) .
to further explore the apparent correlation between nce adduct formation and cellular transformation , 4 - ohe - 1 - n7gua was synthesized and characterized spectroscopically .
the 15n isotopologue of guanine was employed to synthesize the isotope - labeled nce standard .
tandem ms parameters were optimized for positive mrm mode detection of gua - nce adducts ( mass transitions m / z 438 - - > 152 and 436 - - > 152 ) .
the solid phase extraction of culture media was calculated to proceed with 70 % efficiency using spiked media .
addition of 15n - labeled standards to media before extraction ensured accurate quantitation of nce adducts .
nce adducts can themselves be oxidized to o - quinone and 8 - oxo - dg adducts , therefore stability was studied over 27 h at 3 < ph < 10 using synthetic standards , optimal stability being observed at ph ~ 6.5 ( figure s2 ) .
at physiological ph in phosphate buffer , adenine nce adduct degradation was about 80 % complete after 27 h , while guanine nce adducts in comparison were more stable .
the addition of high ascorbic acid concentrations ( 2 mm ) has been suggested to protect metabolites from oxidative degradation [ 23 ] .
stabilization of nce adducts by citric acid and egta as metal ion chelators was also explored in cell culture media using the synthetic adduct standards and lc - ms / ms analysis .
the highest recovery of adducts was obtained using citric acid and ascorbic acid ( both 2 mm ) added to the media before extraction ( figure s3 ) .
attenuation of nce adduct formation by dma regular administration of e2 with fresh media twice weekly in mcf - 10a cells , and analysis of collected media ( after 3 or 4 days of treatment ) showed significantly increased levels of nce adducts .
both 4 - ohe2 and 4 - ohe1 guanine adducts were detected ( figure 6a , 6b ) and a representative measurement of 4 - ohe2 guanine adducts is shown in figure 6c .
levels of nce adducts measured in media from cells treated with e2 were significantly reduced on co - administration of dma ( figure 6a , 6b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027876.g006 figure 6 formation of guanine nce adducts from mcf - 10a cells treated with e2 ( 0.1 or 1 microm ) is inhibited by co - treatment with dma .

nce adduct formation from the nucleotide pool cellular concentrations of nucleotides have been measured at millimolar levels [ 24 ] .
guanosine and adenosine nucleotides play essential roles in cell function and the deoxynucleotide pool ( dntp ) also provides potential substrates for nce adduction , however , adduction of the free cellular nucleotide pools has not been previously considered as a source of the nce adducts reported from cell culture media and human samples .
the o - quinone of 4 - ohe2 was freshly prepared by oxidation with mno2 as previously described [ 25 ] , followed by incubation with gua and ade nucleotides at ph 3.7 or ph 6.8 .
at both phs , formation of the nce - gua adduct was observed from the reaction of quinone with nucleotide and subsequent depurination over the course of 24 h ( figure 7a , 7b ) .
at ph 6.8 , the amount of 4 - ohe2 - 1 - n7gua generated from different nucleotides at 24 h , followed the order : dgtp > dgdp > dgmp > gtp > gdp .
since reaction of quinone with guanine is expected to be rapid , the pseudo - first order kinetics of nce - gua formation observed , with half - lives of ~ 2 - 3 h , likely reflects the slower rate of depurination ( figure 7a ) .
the depurination of nce - adenosine nucleotide adducts was not observed from adp and damp under the same conditions .
the reaction of catechol estrogen quinone with the nucleotide pool and depurination to give nce - gua adducts is feasible under physiological conditions , at least for gua - nucleotides and represent a source of such adducts in cell cultures and human samples .

dna oxidation in response to catechol estrogen treatment surh et al. reported a fourfold increase in 8 - oxo - dg levels after treatment of mcf - 10a cells with 4 - ohe2 for 6 h [ 26 ] .
herein , 8 - oxo - dg was measured in dna isolated from mcf - 10a cells at a similar time point to nce adduct measurements ( 3 days ) .
in order to analytically detect 8 - oxo - dg , mcf - 10a cell were treated with 4 - ohe2 ( 1 microm ) alone or with co - administration of dma ( 1 microm ) for 72 h : 4 - ohe2 induced formation of 8 - oxo - dg , which was ablated by co - treatment with dma ( figure 8 ) .

discussion lifetime exposure to estrogens is a recognized contributor to breast cancer development [ 27 ] .
oxidative metabolism of estrogens by hydroxylation to form catechol estrogens and further oxidation to electrophilic and redox - active quinones is equally recognized to provide a potential chemical carcinogenesis contribution to mutagenesis , cancer initiation , and promotion ( figure 1 ) [ 28 ] .
while enzyme - dependent hydroxylation is the necessary first step , cellular electrophilic and oxidative stress is dependent on rates of quinone formation and reaction , nuclear availability , cellular redox state , and detoxification by phase ii enzymes .
in the hamster kidney tumor model , the catechol estrogens , 4 - ohe1 and 4 - ohe2 were observed to be carcinogenic , whereas the corresponding 2 - oh - isomers were not [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
in human and animal tissues susceptible to estrogen - induced tumors , the elevated expression of estrogen - 4 - hydroxylase activity is seen as support for a role for the 4 - oh - catechol pathway in tumorigenesis [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
it has been reported previously that mcf - 10a and mcf - 10f cells undergo estrogen - induced malignant transformation , as shown by formation of anchorage - independent colonies in soft - agar media , considered a characteristic of malignant transformation [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
since mcf - 10a and 10f cells do not respond to the proliferative , hormonal actions of estrogens , these non - tumorigenic , human , mammary , epithelial cells are often classified as er - negative and represent a model for studying estrogen - induced chemical carcinogenesis in the absence of dominant hormonal contributions .
in accord with previous work , transformation of mcf - 10a cells was induced by treatment with e1 , e2 , 4 - ohe2 , and 4 - ohe1 ; whereas , the non - carcinogenic 2 - ohe1 did not induce malignant transformation .
the catechol equine estrogen , 4 - ohen , is the major oxidative metabolite of the equine estrogens , equilenin and equilin , that constitute 50 % of the widely prescribed ert formulation , premarin [ 35 ] .
the equine estrogens , in contrast to b - ring saturated estrogens , are predominantly oxidatively hydroxylated at the 4 - position , and furthermore 4 - ohen readily autoxidizes to an o - quinone that reacts with dna leading to a variety of dna lesions [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
in human breast cancer cells , 4 - ohen was observed to induce dna damage and apoptosis [ 39 ] , and was toxic towards mcf - 10a cells in the presence of comt inhibitor .
at lower concentrations , 4 - ohen induced malignant transformation , although colony growth was below that observed for 4 - ohe2 ; induction by en itself did not reach significance .
it is tempting to link the observation of reduced transformation by equine estrogens with epidemiological data suggesting that ert formulations based on equine estrogens are in fact safer , however , further studies are needed [ 40 ] .
two separate hypotheses have been proposed for estrogen - induced transformation of mcf - 10a and mcf - 10f cells .
anchorage - independent growth of mcf - 10a cells induced by high concentrations of e2 ( 20 microm ) was linked to cyp450 1b1 mediated oxidative metabolism , generation of ros as a consequence of 4 - ohe2 oxidation , and activation of nfkappab [ 33 ] .
although elevation of ros in the nucleus leading to dna oxidation is a known potential , mutagenic pathway [ 33 ] , [ 41 ] , nfkappab activation was argued to be causal [ 42 ] .
in the present work , cyp450 1b1 was observed to be upregulated in mcf - 10a cells on treatment with e2 and co - treatment with a cyp450 inhibitor completely attenuated malignant transformation in response to e1 .
this observation confirms a role for oxidative metabolism and suggests that transformation results from induction of cellular oxidative or electrophilic stress by the 4 - oh catechol estrogen .
elevated levels of 8 - oxo - dg were also observed , confirming induction of oxidative stress leading to dna oxidation .
the second hypothesis posits dna damage via formation of nce adducts as causal in malignant transformation , the foundation being comparison of levels of nce adducts to stable dna adducts after reaction of estrogen quinones with dna [ 43 ] .
stable adducts detected by p32 - postlabeling analysis were reported to be 10 - 50 fold more abundant from reaction with 2 - oh estrogen catechol quinones , incompatible with the lower carcinogenicity of 2 - ohe2 versus 4 - ohe2 [ 17 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
the predominant formation of nce adducts from 4 - oh estrogens was interpreted as evidence for a causal role for 4 - ohe - nce adducts in carcinogenesis [ 46 ] .
furthermore , 4 - ohe - 1 - n7gua nce adducts were detected from female sprague - dawley rats treated with 4 - ohe2 at levels orders of magnitude greater than stable adducts detected by p32 - post - labeling [ 47 ] , underpinning the theory of formation of abasic sites by depurination of dna as the cause of estrogen - induced mutagenesis [ 23 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
however , abasic sites are a natural intermediate in base excision repair and are present at very high levels in normal cells [ 51 ] .
in the present work , 4 - ohe - 1 - n7gua was measurable by lc - ms / ms analysis of supernatant from incubations of mcf - 10a cells with either e2 or 4 - ohe2 with and without comt inhibitor .
however , production of 4 - ohe2 - 1 - n7gua was observed from the reaction of the estrogen 3,4 - o - quinone with dgtp , dgdp , dgmp , gtp , and gdp , with the highest yield from dgtp .
the generation of o - quinones from cyp450 - mediated metabolism of estrogens , in the presence of cellular nucleotide pools that may be at millimolar levels , raises the possibility that these may be the source of nce adducts .
indeed , adduction of dntp and incorporation into dna has been considered as a mutagenic mechanism [ 52 ] .
therefore , the alternative hypothesis must be considered that 4 - ohe2 - 1 - n7gua represents a quantitative biomarker of cellular electrophilic stress from the free nucleotide pool .
estrogen - induced malignant transformation of mcf - 10a cells , measured by anchorage - independent growth , was inhibited by the serms raloxifene and dma .
in addition to potential clinical relevance , this observation allowed testing of the correlation of biomarkers of oxidative and electrophilic stress with attenuated transformation .
prevention by dma was shown to be accompanied by significant attenuation of nce adduct formation and also by blockade of estrogen - induced 8 - oxo - dg formation .
the detailed mechanism by which raloxifene and dma attenuate malignant transformation requires further study .
classical er - dependent mechanisms are unlikely to be effective , since the antiestrogen ici 182780 was previously shown to be ineffective in inhibition of the transformation phenotypes induced by e2 and 4 - ohe2 [ 44 ] .
the phenolic antioxidant resveratrol has been reported in mcf - 10 cells to inhibit estrogen - induced malignant transformation [ 34 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
furthermore , a quinone - forming catechol metabolite of resveratrol , was reported to inhibit estrogen - induced malignant transformation in mcf - 10a cells by reaction of the quinone with essential cysteine residues in ikk kinases [ 64 ] .
both raloxifene and dma are phenolic antioxidants ; are oxidatively activated to quinones that have been shown to modify protein - cysteine residues ; and , have demonstrated er - independent chemopreventive activity [ 19 ] , [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
conclusions this is the first report that the benzothiophene serms , raloxifene and dma , block estrogen - induced malignant transformation of human breast epithelial cells .
this observation and that of lower transformation by equine estrogen components of ert may of clinical relevance .
attenuated cellular transformation by dma allowed correlation with biomarkers of cellular oxidative and electrophilic stress , 8 - oxo - dg and nce adducts , respectively .
cyp450 oxidative metabolism of estrogens is required to induce malignant transformation that is accompanied by oxidative and electrophilic stress , and the formation of nce adducts may occur from reaction of quinones with free nucleotide pools , which has not previously been considered .

increased recognition of the global importance of salt marshes as ' blue carbon ' ( c ) sinks has led to concern that salt marshes could release large amounts of stored c into the atmosphere ( as co2 ) if they continue undergoing disturbance , thereby accelerating climate change .
empirical evidence of c release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare , yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes .
here we investigated the stability of salt marsh ( spartina alterniflora ) sediment c levels following seagrass ( thallasiatestudinum ) wrack accumulation ; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes .
at our study site ( st joseph bay , florida , usa ) , we recorded 296 patches ( 7.5 +/ - 2.3 m2 mean area +/ - se ) of vegetation loss ( aged 3 - 12 months ) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field ( 7 275 m2 ) .
within these disturbed patches , levels of organic c in the subsurface zone ( 1 - 5 cm depth ) were ~ 30 % lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow .
subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface c levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below - ground plant ( salt marsh ) biomass , which otherwise forms the main component of the long - term ' refractory ' c stock .
we conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below - ground c ; which could shift salt marshes from c sinks to c sources , depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance .
this mechanism of c release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise ; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess , and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation .

introduction salt marshes are one of the most powerful carbon ( c ) sinks on the planet .
they bury at a rate ~ 55 times faster than tropical rainforests ( regarded as one of the most significant terrestrial c sinks ) , and their global carbon burial ( up to 87.2 +/ - 9.6 tg c yr - 1 based on preliminary assessments ) appears to exceed that of tropical rainforests ( 53 +/ - 9.6 tg c yr - 1 ) .
these rates are particularly staggering given that salt marshes occupy only a small fraction ( 0.1 - 2 %) of the total land area of tropical rainforests [ 1 ] .
furthermore , salt marshes can store c for millennia [ 2,3 ] , whereas rainforests usually only store c for decades .
despite their value as c sinks , salt marshes have undergone rapid global decline [ 25 % since the 1800s ; 4,5 ] , particularly due to landscape conversion for housing and farming [ 6,7 ] .
this raises concerns that society is losing an important c sink , and that large amounts of ancient buried c are being released into the atmosphere as co2 and contributing to global warming .
disturbance is likely to affect the c sink capacity of salt marshes in four main ways .
first , salt marshes filter and capture laterally - imported allochthonous c that contributes to the below - ground sediment c stock ; therefore , loss of salt marsh plant material following disturbance could reduce this particulate c trapping capacity , thereby causing a reduction in c stock accumulation [ 8,9 ] .
second , disturbance of salt marshes could reduce the overall plant biomass contributing to c capture via photosynthesis [ 10 ] ; this loss of photosynthetic capacity could also reduce the total amount of c captured by salt marshes [ 11 ] .
third , disturbance of salt marsh could cause loss of c stored in plant material itself ( structural c ) due to plant die off [ 12 ] , which could be exported and lost from salt marsh ecosystems if it does not make its way into the salt marsh sediment c stock [ 13 ] .
fourth , and perhaps most importantly , disturbance of salt marsh could result in the release of buried ancient sedimentary c via erosion , leaching , and microbial mineralization [ 14 ] .
there is relatively little empirical evidence for c loss from salt marshes following disturbance , yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes ( e.g. the united nation 's programme on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation - un - redd +) .
most studies that have reported loss of c from salt marshes have been done in systems that have been broadly classified as ' wetlands ' .
although these may include salt marsh , they typically consist of mixed habitats , complicating attempts to ascertain the responses of salt marsh responses per se. furthermore , these studies are usually based on landscape - scale conversions ( e.g. conversion into farmland ) , and there appears to be no data on the effects of smaller - scale ( within - habitat ) disturbances , which are increasingly common and ecologically relevant [ 15,16,17 ] .
nevertheless , we do know that landscape - scale disturbances of wetlands can cause significant depletion of organic c ( e.g. 96 % [ 18 ]) and weakening of the c sequestration capacity [ 2,19 ] .
the purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of small - scale ( within - habitat ) disturbance and concomitant habitat loss on the c sink capacity of salt marsh .
specifically , through analyses of sediment cores , we tested the hypothesis that disturbed areas of salt marsh dominated by the marsh grass spartina alterniflora ( hereafter referred to as ' salt marsh ') would have significantly lower amounts of organic c than adjacent undisturbed salt marsh .
we then explored which c pools ( below - ground plant c biomass vs. sedimentary organic c ) are vulnerable to disturbance , and the ecological consequences of these losses .
in our study , we capitilised on a natural disturbance event that is common along the gulf coast of the usa ( and elsewhere around the world ) : die - off of salt marsh due to seagrass ( thalassia testudinum ) wrack accumulation , which occurs when senesced or storm - fragmented seagrass leaves are deposited in the marsh at high tide ; when this wrack remains in place for extended periods of time , it smothers the underlying salt marsh plants and causes localised die off ( figure 1 ) .

methods site and experimental design this experiment took place in st joseph bay , florida ( 29degrees 41'13.87 '' n , 85degrees 19'43.67 '' w ) on private land ( permission granted by l. hughes ) .
the experiment did not involve endangered or protected species .
at this site , we observed salt marsh disturbance and habitat loss due to wrack accumulation , which had caused patches of bare sediment in otherwise continuous salt marsh meadows ( figure 1 ) that had persisted for 3 - 12 months prior to our sampling .
within our study site ( total area 7,275 m2 ) we counted and measured the area of each patch using aerial images .
this was achieved using google , earth 's polygon function to mark out the perimeter of each halo ( imagery date 1 / 3 / 2012 ) , followed by earth point ( www.earthpoint.us ) to measure the area of each halo polygon .
we haphazardly selected 10 patches , and measured the amount of organic carbon in these bare areas , which we called ' disturbed ' , and compared this to adjacent ' undisturbed ' salt marsh plots at an equivalent tidal height .
each bare , disturbed area typically represents a separate wrack mat , and we therefore treated each disturbed - undisturbed plot pair ( n = 10 ) as independent .
survey 1 : do below - ground c pools decrease following salt marsh loss ?
this first survey was conducted to compare : ( 1 ) overall differences in c stocks between disturbed patches and the surrounding undisturbed meadow ; and then ( 2 ) to compare organic c levels at different depths down the core .
sediment cores were extracted via a piston corer , which involved hammering a pvc tube ( 150 cm length , 4 cm internal diameter ) into the sediment , and using suction from the tightened piston located within the tube to hold the sediment in place while the tube was extracted .
once extracted , the sediment in the tube was extruded in situ and divided into the following sections : 0 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 3 - 5 , 5 - 10 , and 10 - 15 cm ( note : analyses were restricted to the upper 15 cm since we were only interested in changes relevant to recent disturbance ) .
these sediment samples were then placed into sterile sample bags ( nasco whirl - pak ( r )) on ice , and then transported back to the laboratory for analysis of c content .
survey 2 : are declines c levels in disturbed plots due to loss of plant biomass ?
we performed a second survey to determine whether subsurface losses of c identified in the first survey were due to loss of plant biomass .
this second survey involved re - sampling disturbed and undisturbed plots ( n = 5 pairs ) at the same study site so that we could separate plant ( structural ) c from sedimentary c ( in survey 1 they were pooled ) .
the procedure involved the same coring , extrusion , sectioning , transportation , and sample analysis procedures ( i.e. loi ) as described in survey 1 , with the exception being that the core sections were rinsed through a 2mm sieve using de - ionized water to separate plant biomass from the sediment , thereby allowing the plant and sediment fractions to be analysed for c content separately .
sediment c content analyses : loss on ignition to enable c stock to be calculated , and to ensure that there were no differences in porosity among disturbed and undisturbed sediment samples , we calculated dry bulk density ( g cm - 3 ) for each sediment depth by dividing the mass of the dried sediment by the original ( pre - dried ) volume of the sample .
we then used standard loss on ignition ( loi ) procedures to determine organic c concentrations ; craft et al .
[ 20 ] has shown loi methods to be an excellent predictor of organic c concentrations in salt marshes .
the loi procedure involved drying at 105degreesc for 3 hours to obtain weight , followed by combustion at 525degreesc for 3 hours to obtain combusted weight .
at 525degreesc , acidification of samples is not necessary because only the organic ( not inorganic ) c is lost ( i.e. volatilised ) .
furthermore , ph levels ( 6.4 +/ - 0.19 [ 21 ]) in the porewater of s . alterniflora salt marsh sediments in this region are generally too low to support carbonate ( inorganic ) precipitation , and shell - forming organisms were rare at our study site .
following craft et al .
[ 20 ] , the following quadratic equation was used to convert loi values into organic c concentrations : organic c = 0.40 ( loi ) + ( 0.025 x loi ) 2 .
c stock ( i.e. soil carbon per hectare ; mg ha - 1 ) was determined by summing the soil c mass for each depth interval : soil c ( mg ha - 1 ) = bulk density ( g cm - 3 ) x soil depth interval ( cm ) x % c. as noted earlier , we limited the scope of our investigation to upper ( 0 - 15 cm ) zone .
therefore , our data should only be used to compare overall differences in c stock between disturbed and undisturbed salt marsh plots , and not for estimating the size of entire soil carbon pool - the latter would require much deeper cores ; 1 m minimum ( as is convention in many c accounting programs ) , or , ideally , down to the bedrock .
statistical analyses to understand the results of our first survey , we used a model - selection approach that identified the most parsimonious explanation of the overall c stock and then organic c levels at different depths .
model selection offers an alternative approach to traditional null hypothesis testing , whereby several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data to allow identification of a single best model that lends support to a particular hypothesis [ 22 ] .
although relatively new to the field of landscape ecology , model selection is widely accepted and well - developed in other fields ( e.g. molecular systematics [ 22 ]) .
in this study , for each response variable , the model selection procedure involved creating a series of nested linear models that ranged from simple to complex .
the simplest model represented ( a ) the null model with an intercept of 1 .
while analysis of the c stock results only required the further consideration of a single - factor model that distinguished between plot type ( i.e. , disturbed vs. undisturbed ) , analysis of the organic c data required us to consider ( b ) all possible single - factor models based on sediment depth and plot type ( disturbed or undisturbed ) , ( c ) a two - factor additive model with sediment depth and plot type , and ( d ) a two - factor model with an interaction term between sediment depth and plot type .
after constructing these nested models , we used aicc ( akaike information criteria , with a correction factor for small sample size ) to identify the most parsimonious model [ 23 ] .
model rankings were based on weight scores ( w i ) , which were calculated as the model likelihood normalized by the sum of all model likelihoods ; values close to 1 indicate greater confidence in the selection of the best model ( burnham and anderson 1998 ) .
we also calculated the difference between aicc of a particular model and the aicc of the most likely model ( i.e. , model with w i closest to 1 ) .
if this observed difference ( or incrementaic score ) between the top candidate model and the alternative model under consideration was greater than 2.0 , then we considered the top candidate model significantly stronger [ 24 ] .
for the analysis of results from the second survey , we repeated the latter model - selection approach .
in all models , plot number ( consisting of paired disturbed and undisturbed plots ) was included as a random effect .
candidate models and their incrementaic scores and aic weights are provided in tables .
analyses were conducted with r statistical software ( version 2.11.1 ) using the lmer function in the lme4 package and the aicctab function in the bblme package [ 23 ] .
results we recorded a total of 296 disturbed patches within our study site , which contained an otherwise continuous salt marsh meadow of area 7,275 m2 ( equivalent to the area of a soccer field ) .
the average area of these disturbances was 7.5 +/ - 2.3 m2 ( mean m2 +/ - se ) .
c stocks in the top 0 - 15 cm were 23.76 +/ - 1.02 mg c ha - 1 in disturbed plots and 29.81 +/ - 1.76 mg c ha - 1 in undisturbed plots .
dry bulk density was consistent in both disturbed and undisturbed plots ( figure 2a ) , showing a slight (~ 30 %) decline from 0 - 1 cm to 1 - 3 cm , but then remaining relatively constant throughout the rest of the core .
sediment organic c content in disturbed and undisturbed areas of salt marsh both showed a similar ' hump ' shaped distribution in their organic c content with depth ( 0 - 15 cm , figure 2b ) , reaching a peak in the 3 - 5 cm zone ( undisturbed - 5.1 +/ - 1.0 % ; disturbed 3.9 +/ - 0.6 % ; mean +/ - se ) .
sediment organic c content was best explained by an interaction between plot type ( disturbed vs. undisturbed ) and sediment depth ( figure 2b table 1 ) : undisturbed plots had higher sediment organic c than disturbed plots , but only at depths of 1 - 5 cm ( table 1 ) .

because this depth region corresponds with the salt marsh rhizome and rooting zone ( [ 25 ] ; r. hughes , unpublished data ) , we hypothesized that loss of salt marsh biomass ( root material ) in the undisturbed plots caused this difference .
our subsequent sampling was consistent with this expectation : the biomass of salt marsh root material lost on ignition was much higher in the 1 - 5 cm depth range than in the surface sediments ( figure 3a ) .
in addition , there was equal support for the candidate model with an additive effect of plot type and depth ( incrementaic score 1.6 ) , with higher salt marsh biomass in undisturbed than disturbed plots ( figure 3a table 2 ) .
taken together , these two models are needed to best explain our results ( i.e. , combined w = 0.90 [ 22 ]) .
similarly , the percentage of organic carbon in the sediments that came from salt marsh was best explained by a candidate model that only distinguished between plot type and a two - factor additive model that distinguished between plot type and depth ( combined w = 0.99 ; figure 3b table 2 ) .

discussion our data shows that wrack - induced disturbance causes a decline in organic c levels in salt marsh sediments .
this loss was evident in the upper subsurface samples ( 1 - 5 cm depth zone ) , wherein disturbed salt marshes showed significantly lower (~ 30 %) amounts of organic c than undisturbed salt marsh .
additional sampling indicated that this reduction in organic c in disturbed salt marsh was due to loss of belowground plant biomass ; an otherwise important component of the c stock [ 26 ] .
this amount and rate of belowground biomass loss is consistent with litterbag data by benner et al .
[ 27 ] , who reported 55 % loss of s . alterniflora belowground biomass after 18 months .
as for the lack of detectable loss of c from the top surface ( 0 - 1 cm ) , which is a more dynamic zone in terms of c movement , the data suggests that this zone may have been subsidised by c from the seagrass wrack. is the loss of c from disturbed salt marsh in this study ecologically meaningful ?
both the amount of habitat loss caused by wrack disturbance (~ 30 % of the total habitat area ) and the amount of c loss from disturbed areas ( 30 % from the subsurface zone ; 1 - 5 cm ) is high , but unless the c released during disturbance ends up as atmospheric co2 , there may be little direct negative impact on the environment as far as climate change is concerned .
possible fates of the lost c include ( figure 4 ) : ( 1 ) physical export ( into deeper water , other parts of the marsh , or other habitats ) , which could lead to re - burial of the c ; ( 2 ) consumption by grazing animals ; or ( 3 ) mineralization by microbes and release as co2 .
relatively little is known about the transformation fate of belowground biomass [ 27 ] , but davis et al .
[ 28 ] showed that microbes play a major role and abiotic forces interact to control co2 , even in the anoxic zone .
their research suggests that microbes actually help to keep c buried within sediments under normal conditions , but that physical disturbances can trigger abiotic release of c , and can also prime microbes into metabolising buried c. further work ( e.g. c tracing experiments ) is needed to determine the fate of the 30 % subsurface loss of c from our disturbed plots .

we feel that it is important to point out the potential fates of lost c stock given loss of c stock from ' blue carbon ' habitats ( e.g. seagrasses , salt marshes , and mangroves ) is often assumed to constitute evidence that these habitats are releasing co2 into the atmosphere .
pendleton et al .
[ 29 ] estimated that , given current rates of tidal marsh conversion ( 1 - 2 % yr - 1 ) , total global c emissions is likely to be 0.02 - 0.24 pg co2 yr - 1 , which equates to an economic loss of 0.64 - 9.7 billion us $ yr - 1 if co2 is priced at us $ 41 per ton .
in addition to assuming that lost c stock from marshes is released as atmospheric co2 , this figure also assumes that the entire top meter of c in sediment and plant biomass is released from marshes following habitat loss .
there is little information on which pools ( depths ) of c are vulnerable to release .
certainly , without the aboveground plant material , surface layers of c are more vulnerable to efflux due to physical forces ( e.g. waves , currents ) , but it would require substantial changes in hydrodynamics to remove the upper metre of c. regardless , of whether the c lost from disturbed salt marsh contributes to atmospheric co2 , there would certainly be weakening of the c sink capacity of the salt marsh due to loss of trapping capacity of particulate c , which contributes to the sediment c pool [ 30 ] , although this is likely to take years to become detectable from c stock measurements .
this lack of trapping capacity , along with the lack of plant material contributing towards the belowground c pool , would mean that salt marshes would be unable to accrete at the same rate as undisturbed areas of salt marsh [ 31 ] .
furthermore , without the aboveground plant material to buffer against hydrodynamics forces that cause erosion , there is potential for subsidence of disturbed salt marshes .
therefore , even though loss of c from disturbed marshes does not constitute evidence that disturbance to salt marshes contributes to rising atmospheric co2 levels , there is certainly a strong rationale that disturbance weakens the c sink capacity of salt marshes .
given the high level of current interest in the value of salt marshes as blue c sinks [ 1,32 ] , we recommend that further research is needed to develop accurate c budgets in disturbed and undisturbed salt marshes .
these c budgets need to consider all possible fates of c [ 33 ] , as well as the influence of environmental conditions ( incl .
extreme weather events and future climate change ) on those possible fates .
the latter should include investigation of the relative importance of biotic ( e.g. microbial processes , bioturbation ) versus abiotic ( e.g. physical forces that can trigger co2 efflux ) processes in facilitating c loss from salt marsh following disturbance .
furthermore , longer - term studies ( years - decades ) are needed to determine whether deeply buried (> 1 m ) c stocks are vulnerable to being depleted from disturbed salt marshes .
finally , there is need to understand the potential for habitat rehabilitation to restore c stocks in disturbed salt marsh ecosystems [ 34 ] .
recent technological advances - in particular , eddy covariance techniques for measuring ecosystem - level carbon exchanges [ 35 ] - will make the task of developing c budgets in salt marshes much easier .
conclusion in conclusion , our study provides evidence that localized disturbance to salt marshes can cause loss of buried c , which has important implications for nature - based climate change mitigation programs if this c is released into the atmosphere as co2 ( as opposed to being re - buried ) .
disturbance and concomitant loss of salt marsh habitat via wrack accumulation is understudied [ 36 ] , yet it could be one of the major causes of c stock loss in salt marshes .
wrack accumulation is a natural process , and there is little that could be done to prevent it occurring ; however , it is important to understand how this process of disturbance is likely to affect c budgets , and whether restoration is necessary to stop c release , especially since the frequency and intensity of this disturbance is predicted to increase with future sea - level rise [ 36 ] , which will increase both wrack production and salt marsh inundation [ 37 ] .

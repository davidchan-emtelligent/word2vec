at the royal melbourne hospital there has been a noted increase in not only the number of clients requiring admissions to medial units , but also in the severity in medical acuity of these clients .
lack of clinical expertise in the acute health sector can result in delayed or sub optimal treatment , increased length of stay and poorer client outcomes .
this paper will outline a new initiative proposed at the royal melbourne hospital involving the collaboration of consultation liaison psychiatry , specialist services eating disorders program and an acute medical unit .
the aim of this project is to support staff in the acute health sector , particularly nurses , in their understanding of the psychopathology of eating disorders , to improve clinical skills and provide timely and appropriate interventions to clients and their families .
the core of this project is the development of an e - learning package , specific to the detection , assessment management and ongoing care of clients with eating disorders in the acute health sector .
this abstract was presented in the service initiatives stream of the 2014 anzaed conference .

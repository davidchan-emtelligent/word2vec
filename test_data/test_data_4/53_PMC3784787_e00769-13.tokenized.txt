vibrio anguillarum is an important bacterial pathogen that causes vibriosis in marine fish .
we present the complete genome sequence of v. anguillarum m3 , a serotype o1 clinical strain isolated from japanese flounder ( paralichthys olivaceus ) in shandong , china .
cover - dateseptember / october 2013access - typefree genome announcement vibrio anguillarum causes vibriosis , a systemic disease of both wild and cultured marine fish characterized by hemorrhagic septicemia ( 1 ) .
there are 23 serotypes identified for this bacterium , and the o1 and o2 serotypes are the major causative agents of fish vibriosis ( 2 ) .
recently , the genome sequences of three v. anguillarum strains , isolated from salmon ( oncorhynchus kisutch ) , striped bass ( morone saxatilis ) , and turbot ( scophthalmus maximus ) , were released ( 3 ) .
here , we present the complete genome sequence of v. anguillarum m3 , an o1 serotype clinical strain isolated from japanese flounder ( paralichthys olivaceus ) ( 4 ) .
this strain has been studied with respect to its in vivo antigen gene expression , metalloprotease and exopolysaccharide production , and biofilm formation ( 5 - 7 ) .
the genome of v. anguillarum m3 was sequenced using the roche 454 gs flx titanium system at seqwrite , inc .
( houston , tx ) .
a total of 23,745 reads were obtained from the sequencing (~ 20 - fold coverage of the genome ) .
the reads were assembled using dataanalysis version 2.6 ( roche / 454 life sciences ) , generating 59 contigs .
using the genome of v. anguillarum strain 775 as a reference , all gaps were filled by local assembly using the clc genomics workbench ( 64 - bit ) 6.0.5 and abi 3730 sequencing of the pcr products of the gap region .
the coding sequences ( cdss ) were predicted by the ncbi prokaryotic genomes automatic annotation pipeline ( pgaap ) and the rapid annotations using subsystems technology ( rast ) server ( 8 ) .
noncoding rnas were identified using trnascan - se 1.21 ( 9 ) and rnammer 1.2 ( 10 ) by searching against the rfam database ( 11 ) .
functional assignment of the cdss was performed on the interproscan ( 12 ) and the swiss - prot and trembl databases ( 13 ) .
the complete genome of v. anguillarum m3 contains two circular chromosomes and a plasmid .
chromosome 1 has 3,063,587 bp containing 2,842 cdss , chromosome 2 has 988,134 bp containing 918 cdss , and the plasmid has 66,164 bp containing 64 cdss .
overall , the m3 and 775 genomes share high levels of similarity , as > 90 % of the cdss have the same annotation , length , and relative position. with respect to potential virulence traits , a majority of the virulence genes are conserved in both strains , such as those for hemolysins , metalloproteases , repeat in toxin ( rtx ) toxins , and vibriolysin ( 14 ) .
both strains present two type vi secretion system loci on chromosome 1 and chromosome 2 , and the genes in the two loci are organized identically in m3 but differently in 775 ( 15 ) .
in addition , m3 has 74 specific genes , encoding a transposase and 73 hypothetical proteins ; 775 has 168 specific genes , including genes encoding mobile element proteins ( 30 genes ) , molybdopterin biosynthesis proteins ( moea - moeb ) , dgtpase , methyl - accepting chemotaxis protein , tryptophanase , and ribonuclease e inhibitor rrab .
regarding the pathogenicity of m3 , the complete genome sequence of this strain will increase the understanding of the evolution of v. anguillarum and will contribute new insights into virulence studies of this particular species .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
the sequence and annotation of the v. anguillarum m3 genome have been deposited in genbank under accession no .
cp006699 ( m3 chromosome 1 ) , cp006700 ( m3 chromosome 2 ) , and cp006701 ( m3 plasmid ) .

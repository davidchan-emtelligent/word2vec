studies were conducted to address further the role ( s ) of antigen processing and presentation in the induction of immune responses in a phylogenetically lower vertebrate , specifically a teleost , the channel catfish .
in particular , studies were aimed at determining the subcellular compartments involved in antigen degradation by channel catfish antigen - presenting cells ( apc ) as well as ascertaining the reexpression of immunogenic peptides on the surfaces of apc .
the results showed that exogenous protein antigens were actively endocytosed by apc as detected by flow cytometry .
use of radiolabeled antigen and subcellular fractionation protocols also showed that antigen localized in endosomes / lysosomes .
furthermore , there was an apparent redistribution of antigen between these organelles and the plasma membrane during the course of antigen pulsing .
functional assays for the induction of in vitro antigen - specific proliferation of immune catfish peripheral blood leukocytes ( pbl ) showed that membrane preparations from antigen - pulsed autologous apc were highly stimulatory .
the magnitude of responses elicited with such membrane preparations was very similar to that of pbl cultures stimulated with native antigen - pulsed and fixed intact apc or prefixed intact apc incubated with a peptide fragment of the nominal antigen .
current data further corroborate our previous findings that steps akin to antigen processing and presentation are clearly important in the induction of immune responses in lower vertebrates like fish , in a manner similar to that seen in mammalian systems .
consequently , it would appear that many immune functions among the diverse taxa of vertebrates are remarkably conserved .

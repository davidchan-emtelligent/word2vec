the systematics of the family apionidae , as well as the superfamily curculionoidea , is currently in a state of flux .
the comparative analyses of coi sequences from our studies shed some light on the systematics of these weevils .
to study the relationship among the organisms of the family apionidae , we determined the coi sequences of representatives of 23 species and 15 genera , i.e. , apion , betulapion , catapion , ceratapion , cyanapion , eutrichapion , exapion , hemitrichapion , holotrichapion , ischnopterapion , protapion , pseudoperapion , psudoprotapion , pseudostenapion , and stenopterapion .
then , they were compared with the coi sequences of 19 species and eight genera from genbank ( aspidapion , ceratapion , exapion , ischnopterapion , lepidapion , omphalapion , oxystoma , and protapion ) .
the phylogenetic relationships inferred from molecular data are similar to the classification system developed by alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) , with some exceptions within the tribe oxystomatini , and genera ceratapion and exapion .
keywords systematics phylogenetics lnsecta curculionoidea weevils introduction beetles are among the most diverse group of animals on the planet , which contains more species than any other order in the animal kingdom .
they comprise 25 % of all known life - - forms ( beckmann 2004 ) .
the most numerous beetle group is the weevils , classified to the superfamily curculionoidea .
it contains about 62,000 described species and 6000 genera ( thompson 1992 ; kuschel 1995 ; gonget 2004 ; oberprieler et al. 2007 ) .
most weevils are plant - - feeding both as larvae and adults , and utilize every plant part of almost all plant taxa .
furthermore , many of these beetles are crop pests ( anderson 1995 ) .
additionally , the taxonomic groups of weevils are often restricted to particular host groups , e.g. , to conifers , cycads , dicots , or monocots , or even to their subsets , although there are many exceptionally polyphagous species .
among weevils , the family apionidae is represented by 1900 species of small , pear - - shaped beetles , hence the name of the type genus ( greek apion : a small pear ) .
they are distinguished from other weevils by long trochanters and straight , non - - geniculate antennae ( except for very few species with a different structure ) .
the majority of the species live on fabaceae and asteraceae , very few on polygonaceae , and single species feed on representatives of other plants ( salicaceae , betulaceae ) .
the systematics of the family apionidae has been previously studied by wagner ( 1926 ) , smreczynski ( 1965 ) , dieckmann ( 1977 ) , and alonso - zarazaga ( 1990 ) .
when compiling the taxonomy for winkler 's catalogue ( 1927 - 1932 ) , wagner ( 1926 ) introduced 57 subgenera .
smreczynski 's key ( 1965 ) for identification of weevils adopted the division developed mainly by schilsky ( 1901 , 1906 ) and reitter ( 1916 ) , with amendments made by saint - claire deville ( 1924 ) and hoffmann ( 1958 ) .
the author of this study distinguished one genus , apion herbst ( 1797 ) , containing 26 subgenera .
similarly , in the monograph of apioninae , dieckmann ( 1977 ) distinguished one genus apion containing 38 subgenera .
smreczynski ( 1965 ) regarded this division to be too far - - reaching , since it separated natural groups .
alonso - zarazaga ( 1990 ) raised the subgenera to the genus level , and divided apionidae into 37 genera .
all taxonomic classifications of apionidae are mainly based on morphological features , and the recent ones also take into account the distribution and biology of individual species ( wagner 1926 ; smreczynski 1965 ; dieckmann 1977 ; alonso - zarazaga 1990 ) .
nevertheless , the systematics of most of the weevil taxa is still controversial ( hundsdoerfer et al. 2009 ) .
first , the systematic level of apionidae / apioninae varies from the family to subfamily level .
cladistic analysis of curculionoidea proposed by kuschel ( 1995 ) located apioninae inside the family brentidae , while alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) classified apionidae as a family .
however , in their summarizing work , oberprieler et al .
( 2007 ) distinguished apioninae as a subfamily of the family brentidae ( brentidae : ithycerinae , microcerinae , eurhynchinae , brentinae , apioninae , and nanophyinae ) .
secondly , the relationships among apionidae tribes are controversial .
in hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) , only aplemonini , kalcapiini , malvapiini , and piezotachelini tribes formed a monophylum .
lastly , some species locations in the genera changed from wagner ( 1926 ) to alonso - zarazaga ( 1990 ) , e.g. , eutrichapion classified by wagner ( 1926 ) as a subgenus included eight species , whereas in smreczynski 's key ( 1965 ) there were 21 species ; in dieckmann ( 1977 ) there were three species , while alonsozarazaga ( 1990 ) raised eutrichapion to the genus level and included 10 species .
molecular markers provide a useful means to obtain additional information on phylogenetic relationships among closely related species .
caterino et al .
( 2000 ) selected four dna markers to promote synergy among the phylogenetic research of coi , large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit ( 16s rrna ) , elongation factor 1 alpha ( ef - 1alpha ) , and small nuclear ribosomal subunit ( 18s rrna ) .
such investigations based on a combined analysis of 18s rdna and morphological data were conducted by marvaldi and morrone ( 2000 ) and marvaldi et al .
( 2002 ) , and resulted in identification of seven weevil families ( anthribidae , attelabidae , belidae , brentidae including apioninae , caridae , curculionidae , and nemonychidae ) .
a study of the phylogeny of the curculionoidea was published by hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) .
the mitochondrial gene coi was successfully used in similar investigations of other beetles ( langor and sperling 1997 ; caterino et al. 2000 ; sequeira et al. 2000 ; moya et al. 2006 ) .
moreover , the latest studies have indicated that the coi gene is as efficacious for resolving the phylogenetic relationships among closely related species as more rapidly evolving genes like nd2 ( lu et al. 2011 ) .
nowadays , the coi gene sequence is one of the most widely used genetic marker for resolving the phylogenetic relationships of insects .
the present study provided preliminary information to estimate the relationship among 40 species from 19 genera ( seven tribes ) of palaearctic apionidae and verified the conformity of a coi phylogeny with the apionidae classification systems based mainly on morphological and biological features , especially those developed by alonsozarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) .
materials and methods specimen sampling , dna extraction , pcr sequencing all the investigated apionidae species were collected from poland and were classified according to the classification system of alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) .
depending on its availability , two to six specimens from each species were chosen for further analyses .
apionidea are small insects with the length from 1.1 - 4.3 mm. after freezing at - 70 degreesc , the total genomic dna was extracted from the head and thorax of each specimen .
before dna extraction , the weevils were surface sterilized by immersion in 70 % ethanol .
the risk of dna contamination with gut content was reduced by removal of abdomens .
beetle remains were deposited in the zoology department ( university of life sciences in lublin ) .
the total genomic dna was extracted following the qiaamp ( r ) dna micro kit procedure ( qiagen inc. , www.qiagen.com ) .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) cocktails were prepared using the qiagen taq pcr core kit ( qiagen inc. ) and were carried out in a thermal cycler in 50 microl of cocktails containing 5 microl pcr buffer , 10 microl q solution , 0.2 mm dntp mix , 1.5 u taq dna polymerase , 0.5 microl of each primer , approximately 0.3 microg of dna template , and ddh2o added to a final reaction volume of 50 microl .
for dna amplification , the following pcr cycling conditions were used : 1 min at 94 degreesin at 41.5 degreesd 1 min at 72 degrees repeated for 30 cycles , and 10 min at 72 degrees pcr products were sequenced using abi 3100 avant .
although the annealing temperature was rather low , no unspecific reaction products were observed and the sequencing gave clear and readable results .
a region of 811 bp of the mtdna coi gene was amplified using primers designed in a primer3 program ( rozen and skaletsky 2000 ) : 5'tttattctaccaggatttgg3 ' and 5'atttggggtttaaatccaatgc3 ' .
these primers amplified the coi gene in all the investigated species of apionidae and curculionidae ( curculionidae : mecinini : miarus ajugae , herbst 1795 ; fj657425 - 7 ) .
the amplified region refers to 2221 - 303 lnt of the drosophila yakuba coi gene .
amplified sequences of 24 species were released into genbank ( table 1 ) .
to widen our investigation , coi gene sequences of 21 species were obtained from ncbi ( table 2 ) .
phylogenetic analysis the sequences were corrected manually with the aid of chromas 1.45 ( mccarthy 1998 ) .
to construct the sequence identity matrix , consensus sequences of each species were aligned using bioedit ( hall 1999 ) .
the alignment regions refer to 2283 - 2800nt of the d. yakuba coi gene .
the coi gene sequences of the studied apionidae species obtained and those of the related organisms ( apionidae and nanophyidae ) available in the genbank database were aligned using clustalx ( thompson et al .
1997 ) and then were visually corrected with genedoc ( nicholas et al. 1997 ) .
phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining ( nj ) and maximum likelihood ( ml ) methods .
in the nj method , the phylogenetic distances were estimated with kimura 's two - - parameter model ( k2p ) ( kimura 1980 ) using the mega 4 program ( tamura et al. 2007 ) .
ml analysis was performed with phyml version 3.0 , after determining the appropriate nucleotide substitution model selected by akaike information criterion ( aic ) in paup version 4.0b10 software , using modeltest 3.7 ( posada and crondall 1998 ) .
the optimal evolution model used for the analyzed sequences was tvm + i + g ( transversion model with invariant sites and a gamma rate distribution ) .
weevil clusters , strongly supported by the nj distance method , were in agreement with the ml analysis and vice versa ; therefore , only ml - - based trees are presented in this paper .
robustness of tree branches was determined by bootstrap analysis using 100 re - - samplings .
the phylogram was presented in the tree view program ( page 1996 ) .
a complementary sequence of lepidiota albistigma ( coleoptera : scarabaeidae ) , ( dq524367 , ahrens et al. 2007 ) was used as the outgroup .
results genetic diversity within or among populations in comparison to that which occurs among species is usually very low ; consequently , in all the investigated coi sequences obtained from apionidae belonging to one species , the differences among sequences were not large .
moreover , the level of divergence was independent of the specimen locality .
the studied sequences of beetles deriving from turkey , italy , greece , france ( antonini et al. 2009 ) , britain ( hunt et al. unpublished ) , and poland belonging to one species were almost identical .
the 518nt long coi gene fragment indicated sequence similarity from 95.1 % to 100 % .
the coi sequence similarity among the species of one genus was in the range from 83 % to 92 % ( table 3 ) .
such a sequence similarity rate allows even closely related species to be distinguished .
the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial coi gene sequences of 42 species ( figure 1 ) shows an arrangement of investigated species , which is in agreement with the classification system of alonsozarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) .
generally , species belonging to the same genus are grouped together with few exceptions ; species belonging to the genus exapion ( tribe exapiini ) form two clusters , first with aspidapion radiolus ( tribe aspidapiini ) and the other one with catapion jaffense and c. seniculus ( tribe oxystomatini ) .
both these clusters are separated from lepidapion species , which also belong to the tribe exapiini .
similarly , species of the genus ceratapion ( subgenus echinostroma ) are grouped together and separated from c .
( acanephodus ) onopordi and c .
( clementiellus ) orientale by omphalapion hookerorurm .
in our studies , lepidapion ( hidryocneme ) cretaceum is outside the group comprising lepidapion ( lepidapion ) species , following the classification system of alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) .
four subtribes of the tribe oxystomatini ( oxystomatina , synapiina , catapiina and trichapiina ) do not form one group , but instead are separated from each other .
in the light of the molecular data , the tribe oxystomatini seems to be non - - monophyletic and the subtribes included into it are less related to each other than to the other tribes of the family apionidae .
undoubtedly , analysis of the relationships of species belonging to the tribe oxystomatini needs more attention .
similarly , the correlations between the families nanophyidae and apionidae need more consideration .
two of the studied nanophyidae species are grouped with species from the tribe piezotrachelini ( family apionidae ) with a high bootstrap value .
discussion phytophagan beetles are a relatively diverse group of organisms that probably originated during the early jurassic .
differentiation of these insects is correlated with the diversification of conifers at this period of time ( carpenter 1992 ; zherikhin and gratshev 1995 ; gratshev and zherikin 2003 , hunt et al. 2007 ) .
among beetles , weevils gained a great evolutionary success connected with their specialized endophytophagy ( larvae developing inside a great variety of plant structures ) .
despite the huge number of weevil species , recent studies based on molecular as well as morphological data provided evidence for the monophyly of the superfamily curculionoidea ( marvaldi 2005 ; vogler 2005 ; hunt et al. 2007 , wanat 2007 ) .
the major groups of weevils at the family and subfamily level are relatively well established , except for the large and phylogenetically complex family curculionidae .
classification of this taxon is problematic and there is still disagreement as to its phylogeny or even cogency of most groups within it. according to oberprieler et al .
( 2007 ) , e.g. , the recent catalog of curculionidae genera ( alonsozarazaga and lyal 1999 ) is an " amalgamation of not evidently closely related genera " and subfamilies grouped together only due to consideration for their traditional units .
although there are many publications describing the relationships among weevil families , there are few studies that investigate lower taxonomic units .
wanat ( 1995 ) published interesting work on the systematics and phylogeny of the tribe ceratapiini .
in the same year , zherikhin and gratshev ( 1995 ) described patterns in the wing arrangement within the apionidae , which may be phylogenetically important , e.g. , authors suggested that wings of metapiini , pseudaplemonus , and exapion have similar wing venation .
the authors also found that some tribes established by alonso - zarazaga ( 1990 ) are heterogenous .
they noticed that pseudopirapion differs from other piezotrachelini in wing venation .
genera placed in oxystomatini are dissimilar in wing characters and pseudaplemonus has nearly no important common features with other aplemonini .
similar doubts as to homogeneity of the tribe oxystomatini can be found in our results .
the tribe oxystomatini emerges as a very heterogeneous and diverse one .
even its division into subtribes needs careful consideration .
the phylogenetic relationships of the weevils studied inferred from the mitochondrial dna sequences compared to apionidae systematics established by winkler ( 1927 - 1932 ) , smreczynski ( 1965 ) , dieckmann ( 1977 ) , and alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) indicate that the classification system proposed by alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) is the most accurate .
there are tribes like aplemonini ( supported in our studies by two species ) and piezotrachelini ( four species ) that form a monophyletic group in both the present study and in hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) ; however , in accordance with hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) and alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) , some exceptions were also found .
the tribe oxystomatini needs reexamination .
the phylogenetic relationships inferred from the analyses of coi sequences indicate that the tribe oxystomatini is non - - monophyletic , and the subtribes it includes such as oxystomatina , synapiina , catapiina , and trichapiina appear to be more correlated with other apionidae tribes than with each other .
therefore , the relationships within the tribe oxystomatini need further careful consideration .
in light of our study , the four subtribes of the tribe oxystomatini ( oxystomatina , synapiina , catapiina and trichapiina ) should be raised to the tribe level .
genera like exapion and ceratapion also need reexamination because they were not found to be monophyletic in our study .
similar doubts as to monophyly of the tribe exapiini can be found in hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) , based on an analysis of 16s and 18s rdna .
molecular data derived from analyses of additional loci ( 16s rdna , 18s rdna , ef - 1alpha ) as well as careful morphological investigations of further species of these taxa should clarify their systematic position .
the two species of nanophyidae grouped with piezotrachelini ( apionidae ) suggest that nanophyidae and apionidae are closely related and should be placed in one taxon , as claimed by kuschel ( 1995 ) and oberprieler et al .
( 2007 ) but refuted in hundsdoerfer et al .
( 2009 ) .
however , data from the coi gene analysis are more informative at the genus rather than family level ( wilson 2010 ) ; therefore , close relationships between nanophyidae and apionidae are not strongly supported in our analysis .
in conclusion , the number of the described species belonging to weevils is estimated at approximately 62,000 ; the possible total number of species may be 220,000 , and among them the family apionidae includes about 1900 species ( oberprieler et al. 2007 ) .
the current classification of these insects is under continuous revision , because of the addition of molecular data and new features derived from adult and especially larval morphology or biology .
in our study , the relationships inferred from molecular data of 40 apionidae species are similar to those in the classification system of alonso - zarazaga and lyal ( 1999 ) .

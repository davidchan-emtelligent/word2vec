introduction large - scale sequencing of human populations has revealed many regions of the genome that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution [ 1 ] .
for most such regions , the genes and the nucleotide variants under selection are challenging to identify , and one can only guess about the cellular and physiological mechanisms .
in this issue of plos genetics , head et al .
[ 2 ] shed light on this question for one of the most fascinating examples of selection , in part because the variant undergoing selection is a loss - of - function , and in part because it was discovered long before the human genome sequence was completed .
originally identified during a search for muscular dystrophy defects [ 3 ] , deficiency of alpha - actinin - 3 later turned out to be surprisingly common [ 4 ] .
roughly 18 % of the world population is homozygous for a nonsense mutation ( r577x ) in actn3 deficiency , and the derivative allele ( actn3 577xx ) frequency correlates with greater latitude and lower temperature [ 5 ] .
there is an intriguing correlation with athletic performance - - the derivative allele is overrepresented among elite marathoners and other endurance athletes , but underrepresented among elite sprinters - - indeed , the ancestral allele has been referred to as " the gene for speed " [ 6 ] .
the evidence for positive selection of the derivative allele in european and east asian populations is strong , but the phenotype being selected is uncertain and the underlying cell biology is even less clear .
the article by head et al .
[ 2 ] provides some clarity and , together with earlier work from our group ( bruton et al. [ 7 ]) , a unifying hypothesis .
background to put the work on mechanism into context , it is helpful to review some of the basics of actn3 biology .
the actn3 gene is only expressed in glycolytic , fast - twitch ( type ii ) skeletal muscle fibers , where it binds to actin and is part of the z - line in the sarcomere structure [ 8 ] .
considerable insight into function has come from knockout mice : fast - twitch muscle fibers of actn3 knockout ( ko ) mice have increased aerobic capacity with increased citrate synthase ( cs ) activity and higher expression of mitochondrial proteins , such as cytochrome c oxidase and porin [ 4 ] .
the actn3 ko mice can cover more distance on a treadmill , and therefore exhibit adaptations also observed in response to endurance exercise [ 9 ] .
one interesting aspect of actn3 ko muscle is an increase in calcineurin ( can ) signaling [ 10 ] .
can , together with calmodulin kinase ( camk ) , acts as a ca2 + decoder that responds to increases in ca2 + and trigger intracellular signaling [ 11 ] .
wright et al. showed that mitochondrial biogenesis is activated in skeletal muscle by artificially increasing cytosolic [ ca2 +] with caffeine ; e.g. , increases in citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase mrna were observed 24 hours after caffeine exposure [ 12 ] .
they also observed an increase in peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 - alpha ( pgc - 1alpha ) [ 12 ] , which is regarded as key promoter of mitochondrial biogenesis [ 13 , 14 ] .
work from our group ( bruton et al. ) showed that in cold - exposed mice , there was also a link between sarcoplasmic reticulum ( sr ) ca2 + leak and mitochondrial biogenesis .
non - shivering muscles of cold - exposed mice displayed increased expression of pgc - 1alpha with subsequent increases in citrate synthase activity and endurance [ 7 ] .
bringing it all together in this issue of plos genetics , head et al .
[ 2 ] observed marked changes in cellular ca2 + handling in fast - twitch muscles of actn3 ko mice .
these muscles expressed more of the sr ca2 + atpase 1 ( serca1 ) and the sr ca2 + buffering proteins calsequestrin 1 and sarcolumenin .
muscle fibers of actn3 ko mice showed 3 - to 4 - fold increases in sr ca2 + leak and ca2 + reuptake .
moreover , cytoplasmic ca2 + transients were better maintained during repeated tetanic stimulation , which is in accordance with previously published data showing increased fatigue resistance in muscles of actn3 ko mice ( fig. 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004908.g001 figure 1 ca2 + , heat , and mitochondrial biogenesis .
the contraction of skeletal muscle fibers is initiated by sarcoplasmic reticulum ( sr ) ca2 + release via the ryanodine receptors ( ryr ) , which is triggered by action potential activation of the transverse tubular voltage sensors , the dihydropyridine receptors ( dhpr ) .
ca2 + activates the contractile machinery and is subsequently pumped back into the sr via serca ( dashed arrows ) .
alpha - actinin 3 deficiency results in increased protein expression of serca and the sr ca2 + buffers calsequestrin ( csq ) ( grey arrows ) and sarcalumenin ( not shown ) .
these changes are accompanied by increased sr ca2 + leak and , subsequently , increased ca2 + reuptake ( red arrows ) , which generates heat .
increased [ ca2 +] in the cytosol can trigger calcineurin ( can ) and calmodulin kinase ( camk ) , resulting in pgc - 1alpha activation ( blue arrows ) and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis ( green arrow ) .
head et al. highlight the similar adaptations in actn3 ko muscles and non - shivering muscles of cold - acclimated mice , which also show increased sr ca2 + leak and are more fatigue resistant [ 7 ] .
an increased sr ca2 + leak would require increased sr ca2 + re - uptake and increased serca1 atp hydrolysis , which would generate heat .
thus , in addition to heat from activation of brown adipose tissue [ 15 ] , fatigue - resistant muscle fibers with leaky sr would contribute to non - shivering thermogenesis , providing a tentative explanation for the evolutionary advantage of carrying the actn3 577xx gene in a cold climate .
unanswered questions and future perspectives from a cell biologic perspective , the source of the sr ca2 + leak in actn3 ko muscle is not yet clear .
head et al .
[ 2 ] suggest that the major source is via serca [ 16 ] ; alternatively , it might be due to destabilized sr ca2 + release channel ( ryanodine receptor , ryr ) protein complexes [ 7 , 17 , 18 ] .
regardless , the sr ca2 + leak seems to enhance the oxidative capacity of muscle in a number of settings : development , as with the actn3 ko mice ; stress , such as cold exposure ; and , possibly , endurance exercise. from an evolutionary perspective , the sr ca2 + leak may be good for ancestral humans in cold climates and good for endurance athletes , but it is also known to be deleterious in aging - associated muscle weakness [ 19 ] , in muscular dystrophies [ 18 ] , and in response to excessive endurance training (" overtraining ") [ 17 ] .
in this respect , the evolutionary balance between the functional and non - functional actn3 alleles may be " playing with fire " , as exemplified by results from cold - exposed mice .
in these animals , we noted that minor modifications in the ryr protein complex were accompanied by larger cytosolic [ ca2 +] during contractions and increased fatigue resistance [ 7 ] in non - shivering muscle .
in more stressed , shivering muscle , however , severe ryr modifications led to decreased tetanic [ ca2 +] and muscle weakness [ 20 ] .
human evolution and athletic performance are fascinating , but the findings of head et al. provide additional avenues for future studies with important implications for human health , since the benefits of improved mitochondrial function span far beyond increased exercise capacity .
obesity and the metabolic syndrome are associated with impaired mitochondrial function , and of course , constitute a widespread and rapidly increasing health problem .
could strategies that phenocopy the effects of the actn3 577xx allele promote increased energy expenditure and improved mitochondrial function without requiring an increase in physical activity ?
perhaps treatments to induce a controlled sr ca2 + leak provide such an opportunity , but then the risk of causing impaired muscle function due to excessive ca2 + leakage has to be overcome .

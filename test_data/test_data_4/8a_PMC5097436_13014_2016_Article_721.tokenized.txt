background to determine whether dose / volume specific endpoints ( dvse ) or area under the rectal dvh curve ( rauc ) better predict acute gastrointestinal ( gi ) toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with imrt in the era of daily image guidance ( ig - imrt ) .
methods a set of dvse was recorded from v25 to v75 ( increments of 5gy ) ( both in % and in cc ) for 180 men .
the rauc was calculated for doses ranging between 25gy and 50gy ( rauc25 - 50 ) .
univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the relationship between dvse or rauc25 - 50 and the appearance of any acute gi toxicity .
results the rates of acute grade 1 ( g1 ) , g2 and g3 gi toxicities were 53.3 % , 10.6 % and 1.1 % , respectively .
no g4 + toxicity was observed .
rectal v25 to v75 expressed in % were not predictive of g >= 1 gi toxicity ( p >= 0.12 ) whereas rectal v25 to v50 expressed in cc did correlate with gi toxicity g >= 1 ( p <= 0.04 ) .
rauc25 - 50 expressed in cc. gy correlated significantly with the occurrence of any acute gi toxicity g >= 1 ( p = 0.027 ) .
conclusions the absolute volume of the rectum between 25gy and 50gy and rauc25 - 50 could significantly predict any acute rectal toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with daily ig - imrt .
keywords prostate cancer acute rectal toxicity predictive factor radiotherapy issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background intensity modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) with daily image guidance of soft tissues in patients with localized prostate cancer ( pca ) has been shown to improve biochemical control and to reduce rectal toxicities compared with 3 - dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3d - crt ) [ 1 - 3 ] .
the risk of normal tissue complications is typically evaluated from the amount of tissue exposed to a given dose ( namely , dose - volume specific endpoint ( dvse )) .
for 3d - crt , dvse have been demonstrated to be reliable and reproducible for predicting acute and late toxicity according to radiation therapy oncology group ( rtog ) scoring criteria [ 4 ] .
several dose - constraint guidelines , based on post - hoc analyses of rectal toxicity and its correlation with each dvse , have been established to determine what relative volume of rectum ( in %) can safely receive high doses [ 5 - 8 ] .
as for image - guided imrt ( ig - imrt ) , there are no robust , reproducible data in the literature to indicate which dvse are useful for a more accurate prediction of acute toxicity .
guidelines used by radiation clinicians were based on late toxicities and came mostly from 3d conformal radiotherapy [ 4 ] .
regarding the lower rates of rectal toxicity observed with ig - imrt compared with 3d - crt [ 9 ] , standard dvse developed from 3d - crt results could be irrelevant .
hence , new tools are needed for ig - imrt to improve predictions for any grade of acute toxicity .
the purpose of this study was to determine a new type of dose / volume parameter to predict any acute gi toxicity with daily ig - imrt .
this new parameter was determined by studying a set of several dvse expressed in % and in cc. as the shape of the entire rectal dvh curve from low to high doses cannot be reflected by one single dvse or even several dvse , we also investigated the area under the rectum dvh curve ( rauc ) as a challenger for predicting acute gi toxicity .
methods selection of patients we selected 180 men with at least eight visits for toxicity evaluations and with available dvh data .
all of the men had localized pca treated with daily ig - imrt with curative intent .
characteristics of patients are summarized in table 1 .

a rectal enema was given before the ct for each patient .
they were asked to maintain the same degree of bladder filling during the simulation and treatment sessions .
critical normal - tissue structures were outlined by a radiation oncologist on each axial ct image .
the rectum was defined as a cylindrical structure around the outer rectal wall and contoured from the ischial tuberosities to the rectosigmoid junction , identified in accordance with international guidelines by the level at which the gi tract narrows and diverges anteriorly from the rectum [ 4 , 10 ] .
intensity was modulated by dynamic multileaf collimation using the sliding window technique , as previously described by our group in this journal [ 10 , 11 ] .
patients who underwent whole pelvic radiotherapy were excluded from this study .
the median dose prescribed to the prostate ptv was 78gy [ 74 - 80 ] at 2gy per fraction and five fractions per week .
igrt daily on - line repositioning based on soft - tissues was performed for all the patients using either kv cone beam computed tomography or a 3d ultrasound system as described in detail elsewhere [ 11 , 12 ] .
dose / volume modeling for rectal toxicity a set of standard dvses was tested : the volume of the rectum receiving from 25gy to 75gy ( v25 to v75 ) , expressed in percentages (%) and in cubic centimeters ( cc ) .
calculation of the area under the rectum dvh curve ( rauc ) in the second step , we calculated the area under the dvh curve between 25 and 50gy for the rectum ( rauc25 - 50 ) .
the respective rauc , expressed in cc.gy , were calculated every 5gy in the following manner ( fig. 1 ) : fig. 1 illustration of rauc 5gy calculation from 25 to 30gy ( rauc25 - 30 ) .

acute toxicity was evaluated and scored using the common toxicity criteria adverse events scales ( ctcae ) version 3.0 weekly during each week of radiotherapy and 3 months after the completion of the radiotherapy .
as acute toxicities can last for 3 months , we chose to extend our evaluation to 6 months .
the worse gi toxicity ( diarrhea , constipation , hemorrhoids , rectal hemorrhage , anal incontinence , proctitis and anitis ) grade of each patient was analyzed .
statistical analyses mann - whitney tests were used to determine the relationship between v25 - v75 , expressed in % and in cc or rauc25 - 50 and the appearance of any acute gi toxicity ( g >= 1 ) .
the optimal rauc25 - 50 cut - off value related to acute gi toxicity was determined using a roc curve with youden 's index .
univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to describe the acute gi toxicity ( g >= 1 ) by estimating the odds - ratio and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
the multivariate model included the optimal rauc25 - 50 cut - off value and the adjustment parameters ( age , transurethral resection of the prostate ( turp ) , hormone therapy and rectum volume ) .
the multivariate model was internally validated using bootstrapping ( 170 replications ) .
all analyses were performed using stata v13 software ( statacorp lp , college station , tx ) .
p values were two - tailed and considered significant when less than 0.05 .
results characterization of toxicity we observed acute g1 , g2 and g3 gi toxicity in 96 patients ( 53.3 %) , 19 patients ( 10.6 %) and 2 patients ( 1.1 %) , respectively .
no g4 or g5 gi toxicity was observed .
among these toxicities , 35.8 % of patients had diarrhea ( 29.6 % g1 and 6.2 % g2 ) and 36.1 % of patients had proctitis ( 32.2 % g1 , 3.3 % g2 and 0.6 % g3 ) .
predictors of acute gi toxicity the median volumes of the rectum in % and in cc receiving from 25gy to 75gy ( increments of 5gy ) are presented in table 2 .

conversely , when expressed in cc , all rectal volumes from v25 to v50 correlated significantly with acute gi toxicity g >= 1 ( p from 0.018 to 0.045 ) .
beyond 50gy , no relationship was found between the volume of rectum expressed in cc and acute gi toxicity ( from 55gy to 75gy , p - values ranged between 0.069 and 0.853 ) ( table 2 ) .
the rauc25 - 50 calculated using the rectum volume expressed in cc correlated with any grade >= 1 acute gi toxicity ( p = 0.028 ) ( table 2 ) while the rauc25 - 50 calculated using rectum volume expressed in % did not correlate with any acute gi toxicity ( data not shown ) .
multivariate logistic regression , which included the variables age , hormone therapy , turp and rectum volume ( cc ) , was used .
among these variables , only rectum volume expressed in cc correlated significantly with acute gi toxicity ( p = 0.041 ) .
a liu / youden cutting method showed that patients with a rauc25 - 50 > 794 cc.gy were more likely to develop acute gi toxicity with ig - imrt ( p = 0.020 , [ 95 % ci : 1.16 - 5.46 ]) ( table 3 ) .
these results were validated by a bootstrapping method using 170 replications ( p = 0.019 ; [ 95 % ci : 1.16 - 5.42 ]) .

given this , for the same volume of rectum receiving a high dose , one patient may have a greater rectal volume irradiated at lower doses while another may have his rectum spared when evaluated according to the planning ct. for this reason , the quantec recommended several dvse in the context of dose escalation delivered using 3d conformational radiotherapy [ 4 ] .
recently , like us , pederson et al. found a lack of any correlation between standard dvse criteria and late gi or gu ( genitourinary ) toxicities , evaluated using rtog and ctcae v3.0 scales , induced by imrt [ 13 ] .
the authors suggested adapting rectum dvh , which correlated with late toxicities induced by imrt .
a new parameter related to acute toxicity has yet to be developed .
a number of preliminary clinical studies on high - dose imrt and / or high - dose igrt , like ours , reported very low rates of acute gi toxicity .
in routine practice with ig - imrt , acute toxicity is much more frequent than late toxicity and most patients have grade 1 or 2 toxicity only , suggesting that it would be better to figure out what dose / volume parameters best predict any acute gi toxicity ( n = 117 in our series ) rather than severe gi toxicity only .
although acute toxicities were prospectively recorded in the follow - up of all of the patients , one limitation of our study arises from the retrospective design , with drawbacks related to the post hoc scoring of toxicity using version 3 of the ctc scale .
even though toxicity was prospectively scored , one drawback of our retrospective analyses concerns the major differences in scoring systems in the literature .
patient - reported outcomes may be more clinically relevant and we therefore suggest conducting a new prospective study that includes both physician - and patient - reported outcomes .
nevertheless we found a lower rate of acute g >= 2 gi toxicity in our series ( 12 %) , which was very similar to that observed by kupelian et al. in 488 patients with daily ig - imrt ( 11 % of g2 acute rectal toxicity ) [ 14 ] but lower than that observed by wortel et al. in 260 patients treated with imrt ( 29 % of g >= 2 acute rectal toxicity ) [ 9 ] .
these two studies used the rtog toxicity scoring system .
in another report , singh et al. also confirmed less severe rectal symptoms with igrt compared with non - igrt [ 2 ] .
we believe that daily ig - imrt with a sharper dose gradient , thanks to daily repositioning on the prostate isocenter , may ensure that high doses are only delivered to the same small areas of the rectum as is the case with brachytherapy .
our results are in keeping with this hypothesis as we found that only the absolute volume of the rectum ( but not the relative volume of the rectum ) between 25gy and 50gy correlated with acute gi toxicity when patients were treated with daily on - line ig - imrt .
moreover , these results suggest that intermediate doses delivered to the rectum may be more relevant than high doses with daily ig - imrt .
conclusions we have used a simple method to identify a new single parameter derived from the dvh , in contrast to several dvse , that predicts acute gi toxicity : the rauc25 - 50 is a user - friendly tool that can be implemented in any radiation oncology department worldwide .
we recommend that the rauc25 - 50 of the entire rectum should not exceed 794 cc.gy. this new predictive parameter for acute gi toxicity should be validated through a prospective study .

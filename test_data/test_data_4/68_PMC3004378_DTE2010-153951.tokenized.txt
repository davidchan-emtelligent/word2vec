the aim of this study is to evaluate a prototype variable stiffness duodenoscope ( vsd ) for diagnostic and therapeutic ercp in comparison with standard duodenoscopes .
we performed retrospective analysis on the success rate of intubation of the second duodenum , overall procedural success rate , and comparative frequency of the necessity to change duodenoscopes from standard jf - 260v and tjf 260v or to change stiffness using the vsd .
a total of 213 nonconsecutive procedures in 196 patients with pancreaticobiliary diseases .
there was no statistically significant difference in endoscope intubation rate or technical success rate between the different duodenoscopes .
in one patient with severe duodenal stenosis , the vsd using the moderately stiff mode allowed the major papilla to be reached when the tjf - 260v endoscope could not .
there were no serious procedure - related adverse events .
in conclusion , while the vsd performed well , the present models do not appear to offer obvious advantages over the standard duodenoscopes for routine diagnostic and therapeutic ercp .
prospective studies may be warranted to identify those patients who would benefit from this new technology .
1. introduction the side - viewing duodenoscope was developed for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) more than 40 years ago [ 1 , 2 ] .
since then , various duodenoscopes have been developed , such as a large - channel duodenoscope [ 3 ] , an electronic video duodenoscope [ 4 ] , a double - channel duodenoscope [ 5 ] , and a duodenoscope with a modified v - shaped elevator (" v - scope ") that facilitates use of a short guidewire [ 6 ] .
recently , a prototype variable stiffness duodenoscope has been developed for ercp .
the concept is similar to what has been developed for colonoscopy .
variable stiffness colonoscopes have been found to be useful by reducing colonoscopy procedure time and procedure - related discomfort , with an increase in success rate of cecal intubation compared to conventional colonoscopes [ 7 - 10 ] .
in the present study , we retrospectively evaluated a prototype variable stiffness duodenoscope for diagnostic and therapeutic ercp and compared it with standard duodenoscopes .
2. patients and methods a total of 213 nonconsecutive ercps ( 196 patients ; 116 men , 80 women ; with 17 repeat examinations ) were performed during a 4 - month period ( september 2008 to january 2009 ) at the tokyo medical university hospital .
these cases were retrospectively reviewed .
patients with known esophageal stricture , prior billroth - ii gastrectomy , and roux - en - y anastomosis were excluded .
all procedures were performed by five endoscopists ( t.i. , a.s. , f.i. , k.i. , and s.t. ) , each of who had performed more than 500 ercps .
the prototype variable stiffness video duodenoscope tjf - y0001 ( figure 1 ( a ) , olympus medical systems , tokyo , japan ) was developed based on the tjf - 260v duodenoscope ( olympus ) .
the prototype duodenoscope has the same basic specifications as the tjf - 260 v but with a slightly larger outer diameter ( 11.6 mm versus 11.3 mm ) ( table 1 ) .
in addition , the insertion tube stiffness can be adjusted from a point 15 cm from the distal end of the insertion tube to the proximal end of the insertion tube .
the degree of stiffness of the prototype endoscope is adjusted using a rotary stiffness - control ring located at the lower portion of the control section ( figure 1 ( b )) .
mode 0 has the same stiffness as the jf - 260v endoscope ( olympus ) .
mode 1 has the same stiffness as the tjf - 260v endoscope ( olympus ) .
the stiffness of mode 2 is between those of mode 1 and 3 .
mode 3 is the stiffest ( figure 2 ) .
since we routinely use either the jf - 260v or tjf - 260v , or both , we elected to alternatively use the standard duodenoscopes and the prototype tjf - y0001 .
when the tjf - y0001 was used , the examination was begun using mode 0 stiffness , changing the degree of stiffness when difficulties in intubation and cannulation were encountered and during therapeutic maneuvers .
if difficulties were encountered using the standard duodenoscopes the endoscope was changed to the tjf - y0001 while using modes 1 or 2 .
in all cases the following were recorded : ( a ) success rate of intubation of the second duodenum , ( b ) total success rate of procedure as defined by accomplishment of target destinations , and ( c ) necessity of changing endoscopes or stiffness of the prototype duodenoscope .
the institutional review board of our institution approved this study .
written informed consent was obtained from all patients .
3. statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed by the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test for noncontinuous variables and the student 's t - test for continuous variables .
a p value less than . 05 was regarded as being statistically significant .
statistical analyses were performed with statmate iii ( atms co ltd , tokyo , japan ) .
4. results findings in the 213 patients were biliary stones ( 95 ) , benign pancreatobiliary strictures ( 21 ) , chronic pancreatitis ( 31 ) , pancreatic and biliary tumors ( 79 ) , autoimmune pancreatitis ( 4 ) , pancreatic pseudocyst ( 3 ) , abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction ( 2 ) , and other ( 7 ) cases .
more than one of the above findings was present in 29 patients .
the number of ercp cases using the tjf - y0001 , jf - 260v , and tjf - 260v were 86 , 60 , and 67 , respectively .
the characteristics of the patients undergoing examination or treatment using each type of duodenoscope are shown in table 2 .
the numbers of cases of duodenal stenosis , in which the tjf - y0001 , jf - 260v , and tjf - 260v were used , were 4 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
procedures performed with each type of duodenoscope are shown in table 3 .
the total number of therapeutic procedures performed using the tjf - y0001 , jf - 260v , and tjf - 260v were 170 , 147 , and 141 , respectively .
the success rates of intubation of the second duodenum were 100 % , 100 % , and 98.5 % for the tjf - y0001 , jf - 260v , and tjf - 260v endoscopes , respectively .
there was no statistically significant difference .
in one case of severe duodenal stenosis , the papilla could not be reached using the tjf - 260v endoscope because it looped within the fundus of the stomach .
in this case , the duodenoscope was changed to the tjf - y0001 , using mode 2 , to successfully reach the papilla beyond the duodenal stenosis. with the exception of a single failed insertion using the tjf - 260v endoscope , target destinations were achieved with all types of duodenoscopes .
the number of cases in which precut sphincterotomy was performed using the tjf - y0001 , jf - 260v , or tjf - 260v endoscope was 2 ( 3.8 %) , 1 ( 2.9 %) , and 1 ( 2.4 %) , respectively .
there was no adverse event in any cases .
bleeding requiring endoscopic hemostasis was seen in 2 patients who underwent endoscopic papillectomy and / or endoscopic sphincterotomy .
post - ercp pancreatitis occurred in 9 cases ( 4.2 %) .
all but one was mild or moderate in severity and was treated conservatively .
there was no need during any procedure to change endoscopes or the stiffness when the tjf - y0001 was used .
5. discussion in the present study , we could not demonstrate superiority of a prototype variable stiffness duodenoscope over conventional duodenoscopes .
theoretically , the variable stiffness endoscope should be more useful in certain situations .
the variable stiffness duodenoscope should facilitate reaching the major papilla .
however , since the distance to the major papilla is relatively short and anatomically uncomplicated as compared to the colon , there does not appear to be a great need for adjustable flexibility during ercp .
nonetheless , we found that when the papilla could not be reached in a patient with severe duodenal stenosis , the variable stiff duodenoscope was useful as it prevented looping of the endoscope in the stomach .
however , care should be taken when a relatively stiff duodenoscope is used to avoid perforation .
a stiffer duodenoscope may facilitate removal of relatively large stones from the bile duct , or placement of large caliber stents across tight strictures .
although we excluded cases of billroth ii gastrectomy or roux - en - y anastomosis , variable stiffness duodenoscopes may be useful in reaching the papilla or anastomotic site because loop formation can also be prevented or sharp angulation of the small intestine could be overcome .
the variable stiffness colonoscope has theoretical advantages over standard adult colonoscopies ; its usefulness remains controversial [ 4 - 6 ] .
one meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that when variable stiffness colonoscopes were used , higher cecal intubation rates , less abdominal pain , and a decreased need for sedation were seen compared to standard adult colonoscopes , though cecal intubation times were similar [ 7 ] .
the usefulness of a variable stiffness duodenoscope remains unclear since intubation of the second duodenum during ercp is usually not difficult and not associated with need for additional sedation .
in conclusion , the variable stiffness duodenoscope performed similarly to standard duodenoscopes for routine diagnostic and therapeutic ercp .
further prospective studies in a large number of patients are needed to identify patients who might benefit from this new technology .

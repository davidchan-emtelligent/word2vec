2017 ; 7 : e00729 https :// doi.org / 10.1002 / brb3.729 1 introduction curcumin is a principal curcuminoid of turmeric , which comes under the family of ginger .
turmeric present as desmethoxycurcumin and bis - desmethoxycurcumin forms .
natural phenols provide the yellow color to turmeric and exist as 1 , 3 - diketo and enol forms .
the keto form is weaker than enol form ( manolova , deneva , antonov , momekova , & lambov , 2014 ) .
curcumin has been reported to have antioxidant and anti - inflammatory effects ( biswas , mcclure , jimenez , megson , & rahman , 2005 ; dutta , padhye , priyadarsini , & newton , 2005 ; lim et al. , 2005 ; weber , hunsaker , abcouwer , deck , & vander jagt , 2005 ) .
thiyagarajan & sharma ( 2004 ) have reported that the immunomodulatory , anti - inflammatory , antioxidant , and neuroprotective effects .
in chinese traditional medicine , the curcumin has been used to treat mental stress and hypochondriac distensive mania and pain .
the development of aneurysms has been reduced following curcumin treatment ( parodi , mao , ennis , pagano , & thompson , 2006 ) .
curcumin has been reported to act against ischemia reperfusion injury ( fiorillo et al. , 2008 ) and dopaminergic neuronal cell death ( yu et al. , 2010 ) .
the potential therapeutic effect of curcumin against thoracic and abdominal aortic has been reported ( fan et al. , 2012 ; hao , chen , wang , dong , & yang , 2014 ) .
an aneurysm is a condition that often leads to death by rupture and dissection ( jones , spinale , & ikonomidis , 2009 ) .
a cerebral aneurysm is defined as a cerebrovascular disorder in which weakness in the wall of a cerebral artery and vein causes ballooning of the blood vessel and a localized dilation .
aneurysms in the posterior circulation region have a greater risk of rupture .
the basilar artery aneurysms account only 3 - 5 % of total cerebral aneurysms .
however , most of the common aneurysms located in the posterior circulation ( brisman , song , & newell , 2006 ) .
a detailed information and mechanism of cerebral aneurysm formation may provide active therapeutic strategies .
there are several studies that have reported that the c - jun n - terminal kinase plays a notable role in the prevention of cerebral artery and abdominal aortic aneurysms ( yoshimura et al. , 2005 ) .
the c - jun n - terminal kinase signaling pathway involves through apoptosis of vascular walls ( takagi , ishikawa , nozaki , yoshimura , & hashimoto , 2002 ) .
however , curcumin protection against cell apoptosis in a cerebral aneurysm is yet to be investigated .
therefore , this study was aimed to investigate the curcumin on apoptosis in a cerebral aneurysm - induced male albino rats .

4 discussion in the last decades , the anti - inflammatory and anticancer activity of curcumin has been reported ( wongcharoen & phrommintikul , 2009 ) , and safety of curcumin consumption and use in clinical treatment has been shown ( chainani - wu , 2003 ) .
recently , the curcumin has been reported to reduce aneurysmal degeneration ( parodi et al. , 2006 ) .
however , the mechanism of curcumin action on cerebral aneurysm yet to be investigated .
therefore , this study examined the key mechanism of curcumin action on cerebral aneurysm using animal cell model .
our experimental data suggest that the curcumin treatment could significantly reduce cerebral degeneration .
curcumin induced damage in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in a dose - dependent manner .
however , the mitochondrial damage was greater than nuclear damage .
the possible mechanism of curcumin for its effect underlies through the increased ros and lipid peroxidation .
dna damage was not found at the low level of curcumin treatment .
however , it induced dna damage and oxidative stress at a higher level .
therefore , the nuclear and dna damage could be the starting point before curcumin - induced cell death ( jun , li , hui - min , yong , & lai - fu , 2006 ) .
the jnk is a mitogen - activated protein kinase known to play a fundamental role in the development of aneurysms ( yoshimura et al. , 2005 ) .
the upregulated jnk phosphorylation leads to the destruction of the aorta through the reduction in biosynthetic enzymes and extracellular matrix degeneration .
in our experiment , we have used cacl2 to induce a cerebral aneurysm in the male albino rats .
the reduction in jnk expression could be helpful to reduce the severity of an aortic aneurysm in the male albino rats .
apoptosis in the cerebral wall has been directly associated with cerebral elastin damage and aortic dilation .
the degree of apoptosis in the cells is a crucial mechanism for the prevention and management of an aneurysm ( jones et al. , 2009 ) .
the induction of apoptosis has been associated with activation of jnk protein kinase ( xia , dickens , raingeaud , davis , & greenberg , 1995 ) and directly associated with phosphorylation of c - jun ( force , pombo , avruch , bonventre , & kyriakis , 1996 ) .
apoptosis in the vessel wall cells has been associated with jnk / c - jun pathway in a cerebral aneurysm ( takagi , ishikawa , nozaki , yoshimura , & hashimoto , 1996 ) .
the apoptosis has been reduced in the human smooth muscle cells during the blockage of jnk activation ( han et al. , 2010 ) .
we studied the effect of curcumin on apoptosis by using fluorescence and confocal microscopy .
apoptosis was significantly reduced in the brain cells after curcumin treatment .
curcumin treatment also reduced jnk expression and reduced the ischemia reperfusion - induced cell death ( fiorillo et al. , 2008 ) .
caspase - 3 is an autocatalytic enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis process .
the reduced intracranial aneurysm has been associated with increased caspase - 3 expression ( guo et al. , 2007 ) , and our data also agreed on these findings .
the expression of p53 , bax , and bcl - 2 had been directly participating in the apoptosis process ( hsu et al. , 2011 ) .
the ratio of bax / bcl - 2 is very crucial for the determination of cell survival and death ( xu , liu , liu , lu , & pang , 2011 ) .
curcumin - induced apoptosis particularly involves the mitochondria - mediated pathway in different cancer cells .
curcumin induces apoptosis - like changes in thymocytes , whereas it inhibits cell proliferation in normal cell types ( karunagaran , rashmi , & kumar , 2005 ) .
curcumin induces apoptosis through the mitochondria - mediated apoptotic pathway in ht - 29 cells ( wang , qi , zheng , & wu , 2009 ) .
curcumin - induced apoptosis by downregulating anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 and upregulating proapoptotic bax , thereby decreasing the bcl - 2 / bax ratios .
our result about bcl - 2 / bax ratio is in agreement with previous studies ( shi et al. , 2006 ; song et al. , 2005 ) .
therefore , to confirm the role of curcumin in apoptosis , we further quantitated the expression of p53 , bax , and bcl - 2 .
cacl2 - induced cerebral aneurysm had reduced bax expression and increased bcl - 2 expression .
however , curcumin treatment significantly reversed these expression levels in the cells of male albino rats .
taking all these data together , the curcumin treatment significantly protects cells of a cerebral aneurysm .
in other hands , curcumin has been shown to have antioxidant and anti - inflammatory effects .
the chronic inflammation and accelerated oxidative stress could play a key role in prevention and management of a cerebral aneurysm ( ramos - mozo et al. , 2011 ) .
curcumin treatment has been shown to reduce nf - kb activation during inflammatory events .
also , curcumin has been reported as a good free radical scavenger by reducing dna damage and lipid peroxidation ( srivastava , singh , dubey , misra , & khar , 2011 ) .
curcumin has been reported to induce apoptosis by the activation of caspases through the mitochondrial signaling pathway in melanoma cells ( jiang , jiang , li , & zheng , 2015 ) .
in conclusion , our experimental results show that the curcumin treatment could reduce pathogenesis of cacl2 - induced cerebral aneurysm of brain cells through inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis process .
furthermore , our experimental result may suggest regular consumption of curcumin could significantly reduce a cerebral aneurysm .

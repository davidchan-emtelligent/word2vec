background the association of physical activity ( pa ) with sleep quality , perceived stress , and problematic internet use was examined in a nationwide sample of korean adolescents .
methods data from the 2010 korean youth risk behavior web - based survey collected from 73,238 korean adolescents aged 12 - 18 years ( mean age 15.06 +/ - 1.75 years ) were analyzed .
participants were asked to rate the frequency with which they engaged in moderate and vigorous pa per week .
the risk of problematic internet use was assessed with the korean internet addiction proneness scale for youth - short form .
self - report questionnaires were used to assess levels of sleep satisfaction and perceived stress .
the associations of pa with sleep satisfaction , perceived stress , and problematic internet use were assessed with multiple logistic regression analysis .
then , the sobel test was used to explore the mediation of the relationship between pa and problematic internet use by sleep satisfaction and stress .
results physically active subjects were more likely to express satisfaction with their sleep ( aor = 1.13 ; 95 % ci = 1.08 , 1.18 ) , less likely to feel stress in their lives ( aor = 0.89 , 95 % ci = 0.86 , 0.93 ) , and less likely to be a problematic internet user ( aor = 0.78 ; 95 % ci = 0.73 , 0.82 ) compared to physically inactive subjects .
the sobel test revealed that the inverse association between pa and problematic internet use was partially mediated by increased sleep satisfaction or decreased perceived stress ( z = - 4.315 , p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions the results of the present study indicate a negative association between level of physical activity and risk of problematic internet use via the mediation of sleep satisfaction and stress in korean adolescents .
physical activity may be helpful to improve adolescent mental health .
keywords epidemiology mental health exercise kyrbs adolescents issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background adolescence is an important developmental stage during which many habits related to a healthy lifestyle , such as those involving physical activity ( pa ) and quality of sleep , are established .
participation in pa has been associated with higher self - esteem [ 1 ] , increased physical and psychological well - being [ 2 - 4 ] , and reduced risk of depression and anxiety [ 5 ] in adolescence .
in contrast , poor sleep has been associated with maladaptive functioning and a number of psychiatric and physical conditions [ 6 ] .
in south korea , where more than 90 % of the population has access to the internet , problematic internet use is becoming a serious social problem , especially among adolescents [ 7 ] .
problematic internet use is characterized by an inability to control use of the internet , resulting in marked distress and / or functional impairment [ 8 ] .
previous studies have found problematic internet use in about 10 - 30 % of korean junior or senior high school students [ 8 - 11 ] , and this behavior was strongly associated with depression and suicide [ 8 - 10 , 12 - 14 ] .
extensive use of the internet and computers may be inversely associated with pa because it involves time that might otherwise be spent engaging in pa [ 15 ] .
in addition to this direct relationship between internet use and low pa , pa may protect against problematic internet use via its positive effect on stress and sleep .
problematic internet use may constitute a coping mechanism by which adolescents temporarily relieve and / or escape from emotional difficulties and stress [ 16 ] .
however , pa allows for a discharge of hostility and serves as a buffer against stressful events [ 17 ] .
adolescents who are more physically active may be less likely to engage in excessive internet to cope with stress .
moreover , adolescents who stay up late chatting , gaming , or engaging in other internet activities may experience insufficient or disrupted sleep [ 18 ] .
a study among finnish adolescents [ 19 ] found that intensive computer use among boys was associated with poor sleeping habits and tiredness while awake .
in contrast , pa was positively associated with the restoration of healthy sleep habits and improvement of sleep disturbances [ 20 ] .
building on previous research in this area , this study investigated the complex relationships among pa , sleep satisfaction , perceived stress , and problematic internet use among a large sample of korean adolescents .
based on the previous reports of positive effect of pa on reduction of stress and sleep disturbance [ 17 , 20 ] , which are associated with problematic internet use [ 16 , 19 ] , it was hypothesized that 1 ) pa is related to problematic internet use and 2 ) this tentative association is mediated by sleep satisfaction and perceived stress .
methods subjects data from the 2010 korean youth risk behavior web - based survey ( kyrbs ) was used .
the kyrbs is a government - approved statistical survey that has been performed annually by the ministry of education , ministry of health and welfare , and korea centers for disease control and prevention since 2005 to monitor health - related risk behaviors among korean adolescents .
the 2010 kyrbs was conducted from september 1 , 2010 , to october 24 , 2010 , using a stratified multistage cluster sampling design to obtain a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students .
students voluntarily completed the anonymous , self - administered web - based survey during a regular class period .
written informed consent was not obtained from participants because kyrbs did not collect any personal information such as the students' names , their school , telephone number , home address , or social security number .
a total of 74,980 students from 400 middle schools and 400 high schools participated in the survey , representing a response rate of 97.7 % .
the final sample included 73,238 students ( 38,391 boys and 34,847 girls , mean age 15.06 +/ - 1.75 years , range 12 - 18 years ) .
additional details about the sampling methodology and survey procedure are available elsewhere [ 21 ] .
this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of seoul national university hospital .
measurements sociodemographic variables included sex , age , place of residence ( name of city ) , perceived academic performance , perceived family economic status , and parents' level of education .
places of residence were classified into rural area , small city , and large city .
respondents were asked to self - record their height and weight , and their body mass index ( kg / m2 ) was calculated based on these data .
the frequency of moderate - intensity pa was assessed with the following question : " in the last week , on how many days did you engage in 30 minutes or more of physical activity that increased your heart rate or breathing rate ( e.g. , cycling at a regular pace , carrying light loads , or playing doubles tennis )?" .
the frequency of vigorous - intensity pa was assessed with the following question , " in the last week , on how many days did you engage in 20 minutes or more of physical that was so vigorous it left you soaked with perspirationor breathless ( e.g. , digging , aerobics , heavy lifting , or fast cycling )?" .
the response options ranged from 1 ( none ) to 6 ( more than 5 days per week ) .
the two criteria used for classification as physically active were : a ) vigorous activity at least 3 days per week , or b ) moderate activity at least 5 days per week .
these criteria were based on the criteria of moderate level of pa of international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) scoring protocol [ 22 ] .
problematic internet use was measured with the internet addiction proneness scale for youth - short form ( ks scale ) developed by the korean national information society agency [ 8 , 13 ] .
the ks scale is a 20 - item self - report instrument administered to screen youth who are prone to problematic internet use .
items are rated on a four - point likert scale ( 1 = never , 2 = sometimes , 3 = often , or 4 = nearly always ) .
it consists of six sub - factors : ( 1 ) disturbance of adaptive functioning , ( 2 ) addictive automatic thought , ( 3 ) withdrawal , ( 4 ) virtual interpersonal relationship , ( 5 ) deviant behavior , and ( 6 ) tolerance .
the validity and reliability of the ks scale was established for elementary school and junior and senior high school students , separately [ 13 ] .
in the case of junior and senior high school students , the cronbach 's alpha score was 0.909 and internet addiction was defined by a total score higher than 53 or the presence of all of the following : adaptive functioning scores higher than 17 ; withdrawal scores higher than 11 ; and tolerance scores higher than 13 .
probable internet addiction was defined by the presence of one of the following : a total score between 48 and 52 , adaptive functioning scores higher than 15 , withdrawal scores higher than 10 , or tolerance scores higher than 12 .
in this study , both definite and probable internet addicts were included inthe problematic internet - use group .
the level of perceived stress was measured with the following question : " how much stress do you usually feel ?" the response options were very little ( 1 ) , a little ( 2 ) , an average amount ( 3 ) , a lot ( 4 ) , and very much ( 5 ) .
on the basis of the responses , the participants were classified into the following two groups for multivariate logistic regression analyses : <= average perceived stress ( 1 - 3 ) and ( ii ) > average perceived stress ( 4 - 5 ) .
the level of sleep satisfaction was measured with the following question : " in the last week , how satisfactory was your sleep in terms of relieving your fatigue ?" .
the response options were very unsatisfactory ( 1 ) , unsatisfactory ( 2 ) , average ( 3 ) , satisfactory ( 4 ) , and very satisfactory ( 5 ) .
on the basis of the responses , participants were classified into the following two groups for multivariate logistic regression analyses : <= average satisfaction with sleep ( 1 - 3 ) and ( ii ) > average satisfaction with sleep ( 4 - 5 ) .
statistical analysis sociodemographic characteristics , perceived stress , sleep satisfaction , and problematic internet use were compared between the physically active and physically inactive groups using chi2 - tests for categorical variables and independent t - tests for continuous variables .
adjusted odds ratios ( aor ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were derived from a series of logistic regression analyses using problematic internet use , sleep satisfaction , and level of stress as the main outcome variables and level of pa as the principal predictor after adjusting for age , sex , place of residence , perceived academic performance , perceived family economic status , parents' level of education , and bmi .
all variables were concurrently entered in the model .
then , the sobel test [ 23 ] was used to explore the mediation of the relationship between pa and problematic internet use by sleep satisfaction and stress .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss ( version 21.0 ; spss inc. , chicago , il ) , with statistical significance defined as an alpha level < 0.05 .
results of 72,328 respondents , 64.5 % met criteria for the physically inactive group and 35.5 % met criteria for the physically active group .
among 25679 physically active subjects , 6591 ( 9.0 % of all participants ) met both criteria for being active , 17703 ( 24.2 % of all participants ) only met criteria for vigorous pa , and 1365 ( 1.9 % of all participants ) only met criteria for moderate pa. table 1 shows the distribution of frequencies for moderate and vigorous pa. table 1 distribution of frequencies for moderate and vigorous physical activity ( pa ) in 73,238 korean adolescents vigorous pa , n (%) moderate pa , n (%) none 21726 ( 29.7 ) 20284 ( 27.7 ) 1 day per week 13804 ( 18.8 ) 16357 ( 22.3 ) 2 days per week 13414 ( 18.3 ) 14840 ( 20.3 ) 3 days per week 10932 ( 14.9 ) 10308 ( 14.1 ) 4 days per week 4045 ( 5.5 ) 3493 ( 4.8 ) 5 or more days per week 9317 ( 12.7 ) 7956 ( 10.9 ) table 2 presents the characteristics by group .
compared with physically inactive subjects , physically active participants were more likely to be male and younger and to have higher perceived academic performance , perceived family income , parental educational levels , and bmis .
physically active subjects had significantly higher levels of sleep satisfaction , lower levels of stress , and lower scores on the ks scale than did inactive subjects .
however , the effect sizes were very small ( cohen 's d : 0.15 for sleep satisfaction , 0.18 for perceived stress , and 0.05 for ks scale scores ) .

table 3 shows the results of logistic regression models treating sleep satisfaction , perceived stress , and problematic internet use as the main outcome variables and level of pa as the principal predictor .
physically active subjects were more likely to express satisfaction with their sleep ( aor = 1.13 ; 95 % ci = 1.08 , 1.18 ) , less likely to feel stress in their lives ( aor = 0.89 ; 95 % ci = 0.86 , 0.93 ) , and less likely to be a problematic internet user ( aor = 0.78 ; 95 % ci = 0.73 , 0.82 ) after controlling for age , sex , place of residence , perceived academic performance , perceived family economic status , parents' level of education , and bmi .

the sobel test showed that the inverse association between pa and problematic internet use was partially mediated by increased sleep satisfaction or decreased perceived stress ( z = - 4.315 , p < 0.001 ) .
as shown in figure 1 , pa predicted higher levels of sleep satisfaction ( unstandardized coefficients , b = 0.17 ; 95 % ci = 0.15 , 0.19 ; p < 0.001 ) , which predicted lower ks scale scores ( b = - 0.47 ; 95 % ci = - 0.53 , - 0.39 ; p < 0.001 ) .
pa also predicted lower levels of perceived stress ( b = - 0.17 ; 95 % ci = - 0.19 , - 0.16 ; p < 0.001 ) , which predicted lower ks scale scores ( b = 1.38 ; 95 % ci = 1.29 , 1.45 ; p < 0.001 ) .
in addition to these indirect effects via increased sleep satisfaction and reduced perceived stress , pa directly predicted lower scores for problematic internet use ( b = - 0.14 , 95 % ci = - 0.28 , - 0.02 ; p = 0.049 ) , but this direct effect was much less significant than was its indirect effect through perceived sleep and stress ( b = - 0.31 , 95 % ci = - 0.34 , - 0.29 ; p = 0.003 ) .

discussion the main findings of this study were that pa was associated with higher levels of sleep satisfaction , lower levels of perceived stress , and a low risk of problematic internet use .
the inverse association between pa and problematic internet use was partially mediated by sleep satisfaction and stress .
previous studies of the effect of pa on mental health in children and adolescents have focused on depression , anxiety , and self - esteem [ 5 ] .
systematic reviews indicate that pa is associated with reduced depression and anxiety [ 3 , 5 , 24 , 25 ] and higher self - esteem [ 4 , 5 , 26 ] in children and adolescents .
participation in pa has been also associated with positive mood and greater psychological well - being [ 2 - 4 , 14 ] .
additionally , pa is positively associated with restorative sleep and ameliorating sleep disturbances [ 20 ] .
the findings of the present study confirm these positive effects of pa on mental health .
in addition to the favorable effects on sleep and stress that were demonstrated in previous studies , a protective effect of pa on problematic internet use was identified in this study .
however , the favorable effect of pa on problematic internet use was primarily mediated by increased sleep satisfaction and reduced stress .
two main hypotheses about the mechanism through which pa positively influences mood and reduces stress have been proposed .
according to the first hypothesis , high - intensity exercise has been shown to result , at least in the short term , in increased cortical blood flow , endorphin release , and epinephrine and norepinephrine synthesis [ 17 ] .
according to the second hypothesis , exercise allows for a discharge of hostility , reduces emotional strain , and promotes a sense of mastery and increased self - esteem [ 17 , 27 ] .
in terms of the possible biological mechanisms through which pa positively influences sleep , it has been suggested that strenuous exercise results in a significant increase in the proportion of slow - wave sleep , a reduction in stage - 2 sleep , greater sleep efficiency , and shorter sleep - onset latency [ 28 ] .
other hypotheses hold that the sleep - promoting effects of pa are mediated by psychological functioning [ 29 ] or by reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 6 , 30 , 31 ] .
despite the positive effect of pa and sleep on mental health , including their protective effects on problematic internet use , many adolescents reduce their pa levels and sleep quantity during this developmental stage [ 32 , 33 ] .
this is particularly true in south korea , where the academic stress experienced by middle - and high - school students is extremely high .
the average amount of time that korean adolescents aged 15 - 24 years devoted to studying was 7 hours 50 minutes per day , which was much longer than the average number of hours devoted to studying by adolescents in other countries , which ranged from 3 to 6 hours [ 34 ] .
in contrast , korean adolescents spent less time sleeping ( 7 hours 30 minutes per day ) and exercising ( 13 minutes per day ) than did adolescents in other countries , including england , america , holland , sweden , and finland [ 34 ] .
considering these statistics and the results of the present study , it is suggested that low levels of pa , poor sleep , and high academic stress may contribute to the high prevalence of problematic internet use in korean adolescents .
the limitations of this study include a lack of reliability and validity testing for the single - item surveys on stress and sleep satisfaction .
moreover , information about the frequency and intensity of pa was provided gathered via self - reports rather than direct observations , which may have led to reporting bias .
additionally , because the data were cross - sectional , no inferences about causality are possible at this time .
several possible bidirectional or interactive relationships could link pa with sleep satisfaction , stress , and problematic internet use .
one possibility is that experience of stress [ 35 ] and poor quality sleep [ 36 ] may impair efforts to be physically active and extensive use of the internet may replace time spent in pa [ 15 ] .
finally , there might be factors such as life - style factors and personality traits , not accounted for in this study , which co - vary with pa and are true pathways to stress and problematic internet use .
however , the strength of the present study is its inclusion of data from 75,643 adolescents from a nationally representative sample in south korea .
thus , the relationship of pa with sleep , stress , and problematic internet use can be generalized to all korean adolescents .
conclusions the results of the present study indicate a negative association between level of pa and risk of problematic internet use via the mediation of sleep satisfaction and stress .
pa may be helpful to improve sleep , relieve stress , and decrease problematic internet use in adolescents .
future prospective studies are needed to determine the causal relationship between pa and psychiatric conditions , including problematic internet use , in adolescents .

the c - 3 substituted phenylazo derivatives of lawsone ( 2 - hydroxy - l,4 p - naphthoquinone , iii ) were synthesized and characterized .
the x - ray crystal structure was determined for the ligand 3 - ( 3 ' - methyl phenylazo ) lawsone .
the copper complexes of these derivatives were found to possess 1:2 metal stoichiometry and square planar geometries with intermolecular stackings , resulting in antiferromagnetic exchange interactions .
the in vitro activity of all the synthesized compounds was examined against human breast cancer cell - line , mcf - 7 , which revealed enhanced activities for the metal complexes , the highest activity being observed for the copper compound of 3 - ( 3 ' - methyl phenylazo ) lawsone .

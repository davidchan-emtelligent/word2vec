a murine dendritic cell line ( dc2.4 ) co - expressing hnis and effluc genes ( dc / nf ) was established .
for the dc - tracking study , mice received either parental dcs or dc / nf cells in the left or right footpad , respectively , and combined i - 124 pet / ct and bioluminescence imaging ( bli ) were performed .
in vivo pet / ct imaging with i - 124 revealed higher activity of the radiotracer in the draining popliteal lymph nodes ( dpln ) of the dc / nf injection site at day 1 than dc injection site ( p < 0.05 ) .
the uptake value further increased at day 4 ( p < 0.005 ) .
bli also demonstrated migration of dc / nf cells to the dplns at day 1 post - injection , and signals at the dplns were much higher at day 4 .
these data support the feasibility of hnis reporter gene imaging in the tracking of dc migration to lymphoid organs in living mice .
dcs expressing the nis reporter gene could be a useful tool to optimize various strategies of cell - based immunotherapy .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are essential antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) that stimulate helper and killer t cells in vivo3 .
because dcs highly express mhc class i / ii molecules , co - stimulatory molecules ( b7 ) , and adhesion molecules ( icam - 1 , icam - 3 , and lfa - 3 ) , they can stimulate t - cells ( cd4 and cd8 t - cells ) .
due to their unique characteristics , dendritic cells are able to identify various tumor antigens , such as afp , cea , and hpv - 16 e6 / e7 , as well as undefined tumor antigens , which results in the induction of an immune response against tumor antigens in the host4 .
although immunotherapeutic strategies with dcs have been applied to the treatment of diverse cancer models , their outcomes are only partially effective due to the inability to monitor the behavior of dcs in vivo .
thus , to be truly effective and practical , noninvasive imaging tools are needed to evaluate the efficacy of new dc - based immunotherapies that can accurately track the migration of dcs to lymphoid organs .
several imaging techniques for imaging dc migration have been reported , including gamma scintigraphy with in - 1115 , positron emission tomography ( pet ) with f - 186 , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) using iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles8 , near - infrared nanoparticles9 , and reporter gene - based imaging1 .
optical imaging methods , such as fluorescence ( fli ) or bioluminescence imaging ( bli ) , have high sensitivity with low background , which enables tracking of the early distribution of infused dcs .
however , these techniques cannot be applied to large animals due to depth limitations .
mri has been successfully applied to visualize the migration of dcs and provide fast imaging with high spatial resolution .
but , it should require lots of contrast agents and there exist artifacts because of inaccurate coil sensitivities .
nuclear medicine imaging with direct or indirect labeling provide high sensitivity without depth limitation , and allows pharmacodynamics ( pd )/ pharmacokinetics ( pk ) study because of its ability of quantitative analysis .
but , it has low spatial resolution and concern about radiation safety4 .
molecular imaging modalities with pet and spect have routinely been employed within clinical nuclear medicine and have been applied to various cells including immune cells5 .
the noninvasive imaging methods to visualize cells with these techniques can be divided as following ; direct labeling and indirect labeling with reporter - mediated uptake of radionuclide .
direct labeling of cells is a rapid and easy procedure but it cannot show the cellular proliferation .
in contrast , reporter gene - mediated imaging has the potential to faithfully visualize the viable cells longitudinally .
the most existing molecular - genetic imaging strategies are based on a reporter gene and a complementary reporter probe , which are transfected into cells to track them in living subjects6 .
the human sodium iodide symporter ( hnis ) gene has been widely investigated to visualize gene expression , stem cells , and immune cells in pre - clinical and clinical models7 .
in vivo imaging based on the sodium iodide symporter ( nis ) gene can be achieved using known radiotracers , such as tc - 99 m pertechnetate and radioiodine ( i - 123 and i - 124 ) , and a nuclear medicine imaging system .
furthermore , the nis reporter gene is non - immunogenic and has no known adverse effects on cell viability and function , and this imaging technique does not require complex probe synthesis .
these advantages of the nis gene led us to further investigate whether the gene could be used for dc tracking in living organisms .
in this study , we investigated the feasibility of molecular - genetic imaging using an nis gene as a reporter for tracking of dc migration toward lymphoid organs in living mice .
because the success of single - modality imaging remains limited for the visualization of the entire dc migration process , a multimodal imaging strategy is required to overcome the drawbacks of the use of individual modalities8 .
the combination of individual imaging modalities might allow for the visualization of migrating dcs at different phases of the immune response by exploiting the best features of each modality .
hence , we further adopted an optical reporter gene encoding enhanced firefly luciferase ( effluc ) that has been widely investigated in cell trafficking studies , including those on cytotoxic t lymphocyte ( ctl ) tracking , stem cell tracking , and dc tracking .
this optical reporter gene facilitates tracking of the initial distribution of these cells due to its high sensitivity3 .
immortalized dc cell line ( dc2.4 ) 4 has been well characterized and many researchers have applied it to immunologic research area9 .
for dc tracking study , dc2.4 cells simultaneously expressing a dual reporter gene system were established and used to employ both optical and nuclear molecular imaging .
serial bli and i - 124 pet / ct imaging were performed to assess the initial distribution and subsequent migration of infused dcs toward draining lymph nodes in living mice .
results expression of reporter gene expression in dc / nf cells as depicted in supplementary fig. 1 , dc2.4 / nf cells were established by co - transfection with both 1 ) retrovirus co - expressing effluc and thy1.1 genes and 2 ) retrovirus co - expressing effluc and thy1.1 genes .
since thy1.1 and egfp genes are surrogate markers for effluc and nis genes respectively , the population co - expressing thy1.1 and egfp genes could represent indirectly the percentage of nis - and effluc - positive cells in stable transfectant .
after labeling transfectant with thy1.1 - reactive antibody , the percentage of thy1.1 + egfp + cells was determined by flow cytometery .
as illustrated in fig. 1a , the hnis and effluc genes were highly expressed in dc / nf cells , but not in parental dc2.4 cells .
the expression levels of both genes in dc2.4 and dc / nf cells were 0.32 % and 92.5 % , respectively .
furthermore , to determine the gene expression of nis and effluc genes in dc2.4 / nf cells , rt - pcr analysis revealed two fragments with lengths of 583 bp and 316 bp for the hnis and effluc genes in dc / nf cells , respectively , but not in parental dc2.4 cells ( fig. 1b ) .
assessment of functional activity for the hnis and effluc gene since the expression of nis protein in dc cells facilitate the influx of iodine in transfectant7 , we assessed the functional activity of nis reporter gene by radioiodine uptake assay .
as shown in fig. 1c , i - 125 uptake increased in dc / nf cells , but not in parental dc2.4 cells , in a cell number - dependent manner .
radioiodine uptake was 21 - fold higher in dc / nf cells than in parental dc2.4 cells ( r2 = 0.98 ) .
the effluc protein in dc cells can react with d - luciferin as a substrate for effluc gene and finally emits light centered on 560 nm. thus , we evaluated the functional activity of effluc using in vivo optical imaging system in live dc / nf cells after addition of d - luciferin to cells .
bli activity was approximately 3,000 - fold higher in dc / nf cells than in parental dc2.4 cells , and bli signals also increased in a cell number - dependent manner ( fig. 1d ; r2 = 0.982 ) .
in vivo bli and i - 124 pet / ct imaging of dc / nf cells injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly to mice to evaluate the functional expression of both nis and effluc genes in inoculated dc / nf cells by in vivo imaging , combined bli and i - 124 pet / ct imaging were performed after intramuscular injection with different numbers of dc / nf cells ( fig. 2a ) .
in vivo bli revealed evident signals in the dc / nf injection sites , and the signal intensity was correlated with an inoculated number of dc / nf cells ( 1 x 106 , 5 x 106 , and 2.5 x 107 dc / nf cells , 1.4 x 108 +/ - 2.7 x 107 , 7.6 x 108 +/ - 2.4 x 108 , and 5.5 x 109 +/ - 1.5 x 109 p / cm2 / s / sr , respectively ; r2 = 0.83 ) .
small animal pet / ct imaging with i - 124 revealed focal uptake in the right hind thigh corresponding to an area of the highest number of inoculated cells ( fig. 2b , uptake of site injected with 2.5 x 107 dc / nf cells : 0.0887 +/ - 0.009 % id / g ) but not observed in sites injected with 1 x 107 or 2.5 x 107 dc / nf cells .
as usual , the intense accumulation of i - 124 was also observed in endogenously nis expressing organs such as the thyroid and stomach .
the delivery of reporter gene into target cells by retroviral and lentiviral system leads to integration of gene of interest to chromosome of host , finally resulting in stable expression of exogenous genes , which enable to monitor the engrafted tumor , infused stem cell and immune cells in living subjects over time , noninvasively and repetitively6 .
we examined whether in vivo imaging with the nis and effluc genes reasonably reflects the proliferation of dcs in living mice .
as illustrated in fig. 2c and 2d , focal uptake of i - 124 as well as bright bli signals were clearly seen in the dc / nf - injected site , but not in the parental dc2.4 - injected site , at day 1 post - injection .
radioactivity measured from pet / ct images increased until day 7 , and the uptake of the radiotracer within the dc / nf injection site was 2.3 - fold higher at day 7 than that at day 1 .
a gradual increase in the bli signal was also detected at the dc / nf injection site until day 7 , but not at the parental dc2.4 injection site , and the bli signal increased up to 7.9 - fold that observed at day 1 .
these results indicate that in vivo imaging with combination of nis and effluc genes can visualize the survival and proliferation of dc / nf cells in the host .
the effect of viral infection on dc function reporter genes have been applied to track metastasis of cancer , migration of immune cells or stem cells in living subjects0 , but few reports have suggested possible adverse cellular effects .
to address this issue , we investigated the proliferation ability and phenotype expression level between parental dc2.4 and dc / nf cells .
the cck assay indicated that there was no significant difference in cell proliferation between parental dc2.4 and dc / nf cells ( fig. 3a ; not significant ) .
phenotype analysis revealed that the expression of dc - specific markers such as cd54 , cd86 , dec - 205 , and mhc class i and ii was also not different between parental dc and dc / nf cells ( fig. 3b ) .
furthermore , dcs as professional antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) should induce the antitumor immunity through stimulation of effector cells like cd8 and cd4 t cells1 .
we examined whether the transfection of reporter genes could adversely affect tumor protection generated by immunization with dcs .
the results of our in vivo study , performed to investigate whether immunization with dc / nf cells could generate protective effects against tumor formation in immunocompetent mice , are illustrated in supplementary fig. 2. there was no significant difference in the bli activity of the rluc gene between the two groups on day 1 after tumor challenge .
however , tumor growth in mice immunized with e7 - transfected dc / nf cells was significantly lower compared with mock - transfected dc / nf cells at day 14 after tumor challenge ( fig. 3c and d ) .
these results demonstrated that the introduction of dual reporter gene does not affect cellular function of dc cells as well as generation of its anti - tumor immunity .
in vivo imaging of dc migration to draining popliteal lymph nodes with combined i - 124 pet / ct imaging and bli to visualize the migration of dc / nf cells toward dplns , both dcs were subcutaneously injected into the respective hind leg footpads as described in supplementary figure 4 .
the injection of immune cells can lead to non - specific uptake of radioiodine at injection site by immune cell - mediated inflammatory reaction .
due to these reasons , the dc2.4 - injected footpad was further added as control site .
bli images were obtained on days 1 and 4 after injection of dcs .
on day 1 post - injection of dcs , strong bli signals were detected in the dc / nf - injected footpad , but not in the dc2.4 - injected footpad .
signal intensity from the dc / nf - injected footpad further increased on day 4 ( fig. 4a ) .
when the whole body was imaged without masking the dc - injected footpad , we could not trace dc migration towards the dplns , which may be due to strong signals arising from the dc / nf - injected footpad .
thus , in vivo bli was performed after masking the footpad to allow detection of distinct signals in the dplns .
migrated dc / nf cells were clearly observed in the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad at day 1 .
bli activity in the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad was much higher on day 4 , revealing that the value of the bli signal for the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad on day 1 and day 4 were 2.50 x 108 +/ - 2.57 x 107 and 4.07 x 108 +/ - 1.03 x 108 p / cm2 / s / sr , respectively , ( fig. 4b ) .
in accordance with the results of bli , intense uptake of radioiodine was detected in the dc2.4 / nf - injected footpad but not in the dc2.4 - injected footpad at day 1 .
the uptake values of the dc2.4 - injected footpad and the dc / nf - injected footpad were 0.0078 +/ - 0.0008 % id / cc and 0.0116 +/ - 0.0012 % id / cc , respectively ( fig. 4c , p < 0.05 dc - injected footpad versus dc / nf - injected footpad ) .
on day 4 , the radioactive signals from the dc / nf - injected footpad were much higher than those of the dc2.4 - injected footpad on day 1 .
the % id / cc values of the dc / nf - injected footpad on day 4 was 0.0198 +/ - 0.004 % id / cc. however , there was no increase in radioiodine uptake in the dc2.4 - injected footpad from day 1 to day 4 .
interestingly , the radioiodine signal from dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad was more intense than that from the dc2.4 - injected footpad at day 1 after injection of dcs ( p < 0.05 ) , and accumulation of i - 124 in the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad was found to have increased further at day 4 ( fig. 4d , p < 0.01 ) .
the radioiodine uptake of the dc / nf - injected footpad was 0.0105 +/ - 0.0005 % id / cc and 0.0134 +/ - 0.0009 % id / cc at day 1 and day 4 , respectively .
but , there were no significant differences in radioiodine uptake in the dplns from the dc2.4 - injected footpad between day 1 and day 4 .
concurrently , ex vivo bli revealed strong signals in dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad but not in the dplns from the dc2.4 - injected footpad ( fig. 4e , left panel ) .
autoradiography revealed that the radioactive signal was much higher in the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad than in the dplns from the dc2.4 - injected footpad , which is consistent with the findings of ex vivo bli ( fig. 4e , right panel ) .
these results suggest that nis gene is suitable reporter gene to track the dc migration noninvasively , like effluc gene , which has been already reported to be a valuable reporter for cell tracking .
immunohistological analysis in dplns because dc / nf cells express nis , egfp , effluc and thy1.1 gens simultaneously , we selected the egfp protein among four exogenous proteins to perform further immunuhistologcial analysis with egfp - reactivity antibody .
as shown in fig. 5b , immunohistochemical staining of excised dplns taken from the dc / nf - injected footpad of the mice revealed that dc / nf cells is mainly located in subcapsular region and exhibited diffuse and strong positive reactivity for gfp .
however , negative staining for gfp as a surrogate marker for the nis gene , was observed in dplns from the dc2.4 - injected footpad ( fig. 5a ) .
discussion tumor antigen - loaded dcs were recently reported to be used as a cancer vaccine to prevent tumors or eradicate existing tumors , encouraging many clinical trials evaluating the possibility of using dcs to generate an immune response against tumor - specific or tumor - associated antigens in lung cancer , melanoma , and colon cancer2 .
however , various concerns must be resolved before their clinical application .
among these concerns is the current lack of knowledge regarding cellular functionality following in vitro stimulation with tumor antigens , as well as the unknown mobility and fate of cells after adoptive transfer in the host .
noninvasive techniques of imaging of dc migration will be important for studying the role of dcs with an aim to develop effective cancer vaccines .
molecular imaging with several reporter genes can be used to monitor the expression of the gene of interest ( exogenous and endogenous ) and several intracellular biological phenomena2 .
most importantly , these methods allow researchers to non - invasively monitor the proliferation and migration of infused cells , which are important aspects of cell - based therapy in living subjects .
similar to the luciferase and hsv1 - tk genes that are extensively investigated for their use in cell tracking , the nis gene has also been demonstrated to be an attractive reporter gene for monitoring cancer progression and therapeutic response6 , stem cell trafficking8 , and specific cellular events0 in living subjects .
recently , several studies have demonstrated the possibility of using the nis gene as a reporter for the tracking of t cells and macrophages .
for example , sharif - paghaleh et al. demonstrated the distribution of adoptively transferred regulatory t cells in living mice with an nis reporter gene and tc - 99 m spect / ct1 .
we have also reported the visualization of macrophage migration to inflamed tissues with the nis gene and i - 124 pet2 and subsequently reported dual reporter gene imaging strategies with the nis and effluc genes to track macrophage migration and overcome the limitations of the nis gene3 .
these sequential reports suggest that nis gene transfection using a viral system does not adversely affect the function and viability of immune effector cells , and more importantly , in vivo imaging with both the nis gene and nuclear medicine imaging devices is a feasible technique for noninvasively visualizing the migration of immune cells .
to date , the nis reporter gene has not been investigated for tracking dendritic cells in living subjects , although extensive research has been focused on molecular - genetic imaging with the nis gene in various fields .
in this study , we demonstrated that nuclear medicine imaging with the nis gene is a feasible technique for tracking the migration of dcs to lymphoid organs in living mice .
because in vivo imaging with the nis gene is hampered by both high background noise and signals emitted from normal tissue and non - specific organs , it is difficult to visualize the initial distribution and low population of infused dcs .
to overcome these hurdles during dc tracking with the nis gene , in vivo nuclear medicine imaging was also combined with bli based on the effluc gene , which allows the tracking of the early distribution of dcs and makes it easy to verify the feasibility of the nis gene as a reporter gene for dc tracking .
thus , an effluc reporter gene was additionally adopted for dc tracking , and dual reporter dcs expressing both the nis and effluc genes were successfully established with a viral vector system expressing the reporter genes .
the expression of both nis and effluc genes was confirmed by facs analysis with respective surrogate markers ( gfp and thy1.1 as surrogate markers for nis and effluc genes , respectively ) .
functional activity for the respective reporter genes was confirmed by determining the iodide uptake and by the luciferase assay , demonstrating that iodide uptake and luciferase activity is proportional to the cell number .
when dc / nf cells were subcutaneously injected into mice , bli signals were detected in the dc / nf - injected region in a cell number - dependent manner .
contrary to bli , i - 124 pet / ct imaging revealed focal uptake of radioiodine only in the inoculated site with the highest cell number due to the high background activity .
however , i - 124 pet / ct successfully demonstrated the proliferation of dc / nf cells in mice following intramuscular injection of dc / nf cells from day 1 to day 7 .
we confirmed that cellular proliferation and the expression of phenotypic markers in transduced dc / nf cells was not altered by viral infection .
we also examined whether dcs expressing dual reporter genes can generate antitumor effects equivalent to those generated by parental dcs in immunocompetent mice .
to address these questions , cells from a murine cervical cancer cell line tc - 1 , expressing the hpv - 16 e7 gene ( cervical tumor - specific antigen ) , were employed as target cancer cells for dc - based immunotherapy , they are widely used in animal tumor models to investigate the therapeutic effects of dc vaccines expressing the e7 gene6 .
tc - 1 cells were further transduced with a lentivirus co - expressing the rluc gene and mcherry to monitor the tumor response in dc - based immunotherapy .
in this study , to create a dc - based cancer vaccine capable of generating e7 - specific antitumor immunity , dc / nf cells were transfected with an e7 - encoding pcdna / e7 vector .
finally , immunization with dc / nf cells transfected with an e7 antigen can successfully generate tumor protection in mice with cervical cancer .
these results are consistent with those from a previous report by wu et al. that demonstrated strong antitumor effects by immunization of e7 - transfected dcs in a cervical cancer model7 .
these findings suggest that the transduction of the nis gene does not affect dc function , as well as generating antitumor responses .
several routes for dc injection , including the subcutaneous , intramuscular , intravenous , and intradermal routes , have been examined to optimize the protocol of dc - based immunotherapy in preclinical or clinical models8 .
to accomplish our in vivo tracking study , we selected the subcutaneous region of the footpad as a primary injection site for dcs , which has been commonly used for dc tracking imaging studies9 .
animal pet / ct imaging on day 1 post - transfer revealed the accumulation of radioiodine in the dc / nf - injected footpad as well as a strong bli signal at the same site .
signals from both pet / ct and bli in the dc / nf - injected footpad further increased on day 4 post - injection compared with those from i - 124 pet / ct and bli taken at day 1 .
pet / ct imaging with i - 124 as well as in vivo bli demonstrated the migration of dcs to the dplns from the dc / nf - injected footpad at day 1 , and both radioactivity and bli signals emitted from the dplns also increased on day 4 compared with those on day 1 .
the localization of migrated dc / nf cells in the excised dplns was confirmed by ex vivo bli and autoradiography .
our findings are consistent with those obtained from other studies that demonstrated the migration of dcs transferred via subcutaneous footpad using a nanoparticles0 .
noh et al. have previously tracked migration of dcs to draining lymph nodes using nir fluorescent nanoparticles following injection of labeled dcs in the footpad .
the migration of the infused dcs was observed to draining lymph nodes from 12 h until 72 h post - transfer of labeled dcs , which is similar to that ofour study .
the approach using the nis gene in this study was facilitated by the development of both i - 124 pet / ct technology and quantitative analysis techniques based on ct imaging in small lesions5 .
based on our current imaging strategy , we believe that this approach also could be used to track the migration of dcs administered through intramuscular and intravenous routes .
although this system is believed to be very useful in the optimization of dc - based immunotherapies , some issues remain to be addressed prior to application of dc tracking techniques in other disease models .
in conclusion , we successfully monitored the migration of dcs to lymphoid organs in living mice using nuclear medicine imaging of the nis gene in conjunction with optical imaging of the effluc gene .
more importantly , it should be noted that the migration of dcs into the dplns can be detected from early time points ( in our case , from day 1 post - injection ) using an nis reporter gene by careful roi analysis at dplns .
future studies should focus on tracking the migration of primary dcs using a new tracer for the nis gene ( for example , f - 18 tfb ) in living mice and on expanding these results to other immune cells such as ctls and natural killer cells .

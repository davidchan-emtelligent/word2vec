vascular smooth muscle cells are constantly exposed to mechanical force by the blood pressure , which is thought to regulate smooth muscle growth , differentiation and contractile function .
we have previously shown that the expression of micrornas ( mirnas ) , small non - coding rnas , is essential for regulation of smooth muscle phenotype including stretch - dependent contractile differentiation .
in this study , we have investigated the effect of mechanical stretch on mirna expression and the role of stretch - sensitive mirnas for intracellular signaling in smooth muscle .
mirna array analysis , comparing mirna levels in stretched versus non - stretched portal veins , revealed a dramatic decrease in the mir - 144 / 451 cluster level .
because this mirna cluster is predicted to target ampk pathway components , we next examined activation of this pathway .
diminished mir - 144 / 451 expression was inversely correlated with increased phosphorylation of ampkalpha at thr172 in stretched portal vein .
similar to the effect of stretch , contractile differentiation could be induced in non - stretched portal veins by the ampk activator , aicar .
transfection with mir - 144 / 451 mimics reduced the protein expression level of mediators in the ampk pathway including mo25alpha , ampk and acc .
this effect also decreased aicar - induced activation of the ampk signaling pathway .
in conclusion , our results suggest that stretch - induced activation of ampk in vascular smooth muscle is in part regulated by reduced levels of mir - 144 / 451 and that this effect may play a role in promoting contractile differentiation of smooth muscle cells .

introduction vascular smooth muscle cells ( vsmcs ) have a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental cues by phenotypic modulation [ 1 ] .
this is likely a key mechanism to allow for repair following vascular injury but phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells can also have detrimental effects in the development of vascular disease [ 2 ] .
intense efforts have therefore been made to clarify the molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic modulation of vsmcs and to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this response .
we have previously reported that mechanical stretch is an important factor for the regulation of smooth muscle phenotype using murine portal veins in organ culture [ 3 ] - [ 7 ] .
in this model , portal veins are subjected to longitudinal stretch by applying a gold weight at one end of the vessel , which results in increased hypertrophic growth , remodeling and contractile differentiation over one to five days .
although multiple pathways are likely to be involved in smooth muscle mechanotransduction , stretch partly promotes growth by activating map - kinase / erk and pi3 - kinase / akt , and contractile differentiation by stimulating the rho / cofilin pathway and actin polymerization .
these signaling pathways are also known to be activated in the arterial system during experimental models of hypertension [ 8 ] - [ 14 ] .
stretch - induced growth in the portal vein is also dependent on endogenous release of angiotensin ii and endothelin - 1 [ 3 ] , [ 15 ] , while contractile differentiation requires calcium influx via l - type calcium channels [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
micrornas are short , non - coding rnas that are known to regulate mrna stability and protein translation by binding to their target mrnas [ 18 ] .
in most cases , mirna - binding to the 3'utr of the target mrna results in translational inhibition or mrna degradation .
in smooth muscle , the role of mirnas has been investigated using conditional knockout of dicer , an essential enzyme for mirna maturation .
early embryonic deletion of dicer in smooth muscle causes embryonic lethality due to reduced proliferation , contractile differentiation and contractile function of smooth muscle cells , which results in widespread internal hemorrhage [ 19 ] .
similar effects on smooth muscle differentiation and contractile function are observed in adult mice with inducible and smooth muscle specific deletion of dicer [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
in a recent report , we found that inducible deletion of dicer in smooth muscle results in loss of l - type calcium channels and reduced stretch - induced contractile differentiation of the portal vein [ 17 ] .
in the present study we hypothesized that mirnas are regulated by mechanical factors and play a role in stretch - induced signaling events in vascular smooth muscle cells .
we used portal veins in organ culture to screen for mirnas that are regulated by mechanical stretch and found a cluster of two mirnas , mir - 144 / 451 that were significantly down - regulated and may play a role in stretch - dependent activation of the amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) pathway and contractile differentiation .

the qpcr primer sequences used for mm _ myh11 have been published previously [ 23 ] .
western blotting cells grown on 6 - well plates were washed twice with ice - cold pbs and lysed on ice directly in the wells with 70 - 75 microl of 1x laemmli sample buffer ( 60 mm tris - hcl , ph 6.8 , 2 % sds , 10 % glycerol ) .
after protein determination with the lowry method ( biorad reagents ) bromophenol blue and beta - mercaptoethanol were added to the samples at final concentrations of 0.005 % and 5 % respectively .
equal amounts ( 15 - 30 microg ) of protein were loaded in each lane of bio - rad tgx 4 - 15 % criterion gels .

results the expression of microrna - 144 / 451 is down - regulated in stretched portal veins and in pressurized carotid arteries , which inversely correlates with increased expression and phosphorylation of ampk to identify mirnas sensitive to stretch , we performed whole genome mirna qpcr arrays using rna extracted from pooled mouse portal veins ( n = 14 ) stretched for 24 h or unstretched controls and normalized to four different housekeeping genes ( hkg ) .
the analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in mir - 144 and mir - 451 with only minor changes ( 4 - fold cut off ) in other functional mirnas strands including the smooth muscle specific mir - 145 ( figure 1a ) .
the down - regulation of mir - 144 and mir - 451 in stretched portal veins was then validated using individual qpcr reactions in triplicate ( figure 1b ) .
some of the mirnas that were not affected by stretch at 24 h such as mir - 1 , mir - 143 and mir - 145 were also included in the individual mirna analysis ( figure 1b ) .
in accordance with the effect in portal veins , pressurization of carotid arteries for 6 hours resulted in decreased expression of mir - 144 / 451 ( figure 1c ) .

( e - h ) activation of ampk signaling was analyzed by western blotting and phospho - specific antibodies in portal veins stretched for 2 days ( 2 d ) or 5 days ( 5 d ) ( n = 4 - 10 ) .
the phosphorylation level of ampkalpha at t172 was compared to either total ampkalpha ( e ) or gapdh ( f ) .
total content of ampkalpha versus gapdh is shown in ( g ) .
( h ) representative western blot of t172 - phospho - and total - ampkalpha and gapdh in portal veins stretched for 5 days .
an analysis of predicted targets of mir - 451 and mir - 144 revealed mo25alpha ( cab39 ) and ampkalpha1 ( prkaa1 ) , respectively ( figure 1d ) .
both mo25alpha and ampkalpha are involved in the regulation of the ampk pathway , a central regulator of cellular metabolism .
furthermore , ampk has been demonstrated to be activated by angii [ 25 ] and to play an important role in prevention of neointimal hyperplasia [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
in order to investigate the effect of stretch on ampk signaling we analyzed phosphorylation of ampkalpha in stretched versus non - stretched portal veins .
phosphorylation at thr172 , which governs ampk activity , was significantly increased in portal veins stretched for 5 days both when compared to total ampkalpha expression levels ( figure 1e and h ) and to gapdh ( figure 1f and h ) .
total ampkalpha protein content was increased after 5 days of stretch ( figure 1g and h ) , inversely correlating with the down - regulated levels of mir - 144 and mir - 451 in these vessels .
no significant change in either ampk phosphorylation or ampk protein content was detected in stretched portal veins after 2 days of organ culture .
transfection of mir - 144 / 451 mimics leads to a down - regulation of ampkalpha / mo25alpha / acc protein expression in primary vsmcs to evaluate the effect of mir - 144 and mir - 451 on the expression of mediators in the ampk pathway , we transfected primary vsmcs isolated from mouse aorta with mirna mimics either separately or in combination .
the expression levels of both mirnas were very low in cultured cells compared to intact smooth muscle ( suppl .
figure s1a and b ) and therefore we did not attempt to inhibit these mirnas using mirna inhibitors .
qpcr analysis confirmed that the mir - 144 or mir - 451 expression level in cells transfected with the respective mirna mimic was significantly higher than in the cells transfected with negative control ( data not shown ) .
both mimics were used at 100 nm concentration , which was chosen based on dose - response experiments ( data not shown ) .
mo25alpha , which is a scaffolding protein required for full activity of the upstream ampk kinase - lkb1 , has previously been experimentally validated as a target of mir - 451 in glioma cells [ 28 ] and cardiac myocytes [ 29 ] .
in accordance with these studies we found a down - regulation of this protein following transfection of mir - 451 mimic in primary vsmcs ( figure 2a ) .
furthermore , transfection of either mir - 144 or mir - 451 mimic down - regulated the protein expression of ampkalpha ( figure 2b ) .
unexpectedly transfection with mir - 451 also affected the protein expression of acetyl - coa carboxylase ( acc ) , which is a downstream mediator of the ampk pathway .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065135.g002 figure 2 the mir - 144 / 451 cluster reduces the protein levels of mo25alpha , ampkalpha and acc .
primary mouse aortic smooth muscle cells were transfected with synthetic mature mimics of either mir - 144 ( 100 nm ) , mir - 451 ( 100 nm ) or mir - 144 + mir - 451 ( 50 nm each ) .
after 96 hours , the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti - mo25alpha / cab39 ( a ) , anti - ampkalpha ( b ) or anti - acc ( c ) .
the graphs show quantification of 3 independent experiments in duplicates normalized to cells transfected with negative control ( nc ) .
hsp90 was used as loading control .
a representative blot is shown below each graph .
transfection of mir - 451 and mir - 144 mimics reduces aicar - induced activation of the ampk pathway in order to evaluate the importance of mir - 144 and mir - 451 for the activity of ampk signaling , smooth muscle cells were transfected with mirna mimics and analyzed by western blot using phospho - specific antibodies .
since total levels of ampk and acc are reduced by the mir - 144 and mir - 451 mimics , phosphorylated ampk and acc levels were normalized to the stably expressed heat - shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) to reveal the full effect of the mirna mimics .
after 72 hours of transfection , the cells were starved for 24 hours and then treated with the ampk activator aicar ( 1 mm ) for 20 min .
as expected , aicar caused a significant increase of both ampk phosphorylation at thr172 and phosphorylation of its downstream target acc at ser79 .
notably , the increase in ampk phosphorylation by 1 mm aicar was approximately 150 % ( figure 3a ) , which is in the same range as the increase caused by mechanical stretch ( figure 1f ) .
although mir - 144 mimic was most effective in inhibiting ampk phosphorylation , mir - 451 mimic also prevented part of the aicar - induced response ( figure 3a ) .
as shown in figure 3b , phosphorylation of acc was reduced by mir - 451 mimic in both basal conditions and after stimulation with aicar , while mir - 144 had a slightly smaller effect .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065135.g003 figure 3 effect of mir - 144 / 451 mimic on basal and aicar - induced ampk signaling .
primary mouse aortic smooth muscle cells were transfected with synthetic mature mimics of either mir - 144 ( 100 nm ) , mir - 451 ( 100 nm ) or mir - 144 + mir - 451 ( 50 nm each ) .
after 72 hours the cells were starved in 0.1 % fbs dmem / ham 's f12 media for 24 hours and then treated with 1 mm aicar for 20 minutes .
total cell lysates were immunoblotted for t172 - phospho - ampk ( a ) , s79 - phospho - acc ( b ) and t389 - phospho - p70s6k ( c ) or analyzed by in vitro ampk activity assay using amara as a peptide substrate ( d and e ) .
for the ampk activity assay , absolute values in control samples were 409 - 449 mu / mg protein for ampkalpha1 and 9.6 - 14.4 mu / mg protein for ampkalpha2 , where 1 mu represents pmol / min of incorporated atp .
all graphs show quantification of 2 - 3 independent experiments in duplicates or triplicates normalized to untreated cells transfected with negative control ( nc ) .
hsp90 or total p70s6k was used as loading control .
a representative blot is shown .
the activity of mtor signaling , which is negatively regulated by ampk , was measured by phosphorylation of its downstream target p70 ribosomal s6 kinase ( p70s6k ) at thr389 .
as expected , aicar treatment reduced p70s6k phosphorylation and we found that transfection of mir - 451 mimic alleviated this inhibition ( figure 3c ) .
to test if the effect of mir - 144 / 451 on ampk phosphorylation correlated with an effect on ampk activity , cells were treated with the combination of mir - 144 / 451 according to the same protocol as in figure 3a - c and analyzed by in vitro ampk activity assay .
as shown in figure 3d and e , transfection of mir - 144 / 451 mimic resulted in a small but significant decrease in aicar - induced ampkalpha1 and ampkalpha2 activity .
aicar - induced ampk activation promotes contractile differentiation of vascular smooth muscle activation of ampk has previously been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contractile differentiation [ 30 ] and it is well known that mechanical stretch of the vascular wall promotes the expression of smooth muscle markers [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 31 ] .
in order to test if the level of ampk - activation induced by mechanical stretch is sufficient to promote contractile differentiation , we stimulated isolated intact aorta ( figure 4a ) and unstretched portal veins ( figure 4b ) with 1 mm aicar for 24 h in organ culture .
the mrna expression of known stretch - sensitive smooth muscle markers such as calponin ( cnn1 ) , desmin ( des ) , sm22 ( tagln ) , the bk channel beta1 - subunit ( kcnmb1 ) and myosin heavy chain ( myh11 ) was then analyzed by qpcr .
aicar promoted the expression of these smooth muscle markers to a similar or slightly higher extent compared to mechanical stretch of the portal vein ( compare with figure 4c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065135.g004 figure 4 aicar treatment of either aorta or unstretched portal vein increases mrna expression of smooth muscle markers and mimics the effect of stretch .
aorta ( a ) and unstretched portal veins ( b ) were treated with 1 mm aicar or stretched ( c ) for 24 hours and then analyzed for calponin ( cnn1 ) , bkchannel beta1 - subunit ( kcnmb1 ) , desmin ( des ) , myosin heavy chain ( myh11 ) and sm22 ( tagln ) expression by qpcr ( n = 4 ) .
discussion in this study we investigated how the mirna expression profile changes in response to stretch and tested the effect of stretch - sensitive mirnas on intracellular signaling in vascular smooth muscle .
we show that mir - 144 / 451 expression is significantly and specifically reduced in stretched portal veins and pressurized carotid arteries .
furthermore , we demonstrated that over - expression of these mirnas affects the regulation of ampk signaling by down - regulating total protein levels of mo25alpha , ampkalpha and acc .
this effect resulted in inhibition of aicar - induced phosphorylation and activation of ampk and prevention of aicar - induced inhibition of acc and p70s6k .
finally , we demonstrate that aicar can promote contractile differentiation in non - stretched portal vein , similar to the effect of mechanical stretch .
we have previously demonstrated that mirnas are essential for stretch - induced contractile differentiation , partly via reduction of l - type channel expression , which is likely due to increased expression of camkiia , a known target of mir - 145 [ 17 ] .
however , in that study we did not investigate the effect of stretch on mirna expression and the role of stretch - induced mirnas in intracellular signaling events in vascular smooth muscle .
a number of specific mirnas including mir - 21 and mir - 26a , and mir - 153 / 223 have previously been demonstrated to be regulated by stretch in isolated and cultured vascular [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] and airway smooth muscle cells [ 34 ] , respectively .
collectively , these mirnas were shown to promote proliferation or hypertrophic growth of smooth muscle cells .
although studies in isolated cells are important to define the molecular mechanisms of stretch - induced signaling it is well known that tissue composition and contractile differentiation are essential factors for the mechanical properties of vascular smooth muscle .
therefore , stretch - induced effects also need to be investigated in systems in which the contractile phenotype and cell - matrix interactions are maintained .
to our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of pressure and stretch on mirna expression in intact vessels .
since the turnover of mirnas in quiescent smooth muscle is relatively slow , the effects on mir - 144 / 451 observed in this study should be considered an early event in stretch - induced mirna expression .
mir - 144 and / or mir - 451 have been studied previously in numerous cell types including erythrocytes [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , glioma cells [ 28 ] , cardiomyocytes [ 29 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] and smooth muscle cells [ 39 ] .
in both glioma cells [ 28 ] and cardiomyocytes [ 29 ] , mir - 451 has been demonstrated to target mo25alpha , an important regulator of the ampk - signaling pathway [ 40 ] .
we could confirm this effect in smooth muscle and also demonstrate that both mir - 144 and mir - 451 directly or indirectly target other mediators of the ampk pathway including ampk itself , and acc .
ampk activity is also regulated by phosphatases and mir - 144 is predicted to target regulatory subunits of both protein phosphatase 1 ( pp1 ) and protein phosphatase 2 ( pp2 ) .
although we did not investigate the role of pp1 and pp2 in the present study , we predict that it is unlikely that the inhibitory effect of mir - 144 on ampk activity is due to induction or activation of these phosphatases .
in contrast , a reduced expression of the regulatory subunits of pp1 and pp2 by mir - 144 would be expected to augment ampk phosphorylation [ 41 ] .
to our knowledge , stretch - induced activation of ampk in smooth muscle has not been demonstrated previously and thus represents a novel mechanism for smooth muscle mechanotransduction .
recent reports have shown that ampk can be activated by ang ii [ 25 ] and inhibit the proliferative response to angii in vascular smooth muscle cells .
one can speculate that the activation of ampk by stretch could act as a negative feedback mechanism to prevent excessive growth in response to stretch .
this may have important clinical implications since deletion of ampk exacerbates neointimal hyperplasia following vascular injury [ 26 ] while activation of ampk by systemic or local delivery of ampk activators like aicar or a 769662 , results in a significant reduction in neointimal area [ 27 ] .
future studies are needed in order to investigate if inhibition of mir144 / 451 in vascular smooth muscle cells can reduce neointimal hyperplasia via potentiation of ampk signaling .
although ampk is mostly recognized for its anti - proliferative effect in smooth muscle , it was recently demonstrated that aicar - induced activation of ampk could promote contractile differentiation of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells [ 30 ] .
in accordance with that study , we found that ampk activation promotes the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells in the unloaded portal vein to a similar extent as mechanical stretch .
in conclusion , our results demonstrate that stretch activates the ampk signaling pathway and that stretch - sensitive mirnas such as mir - 144 / 451 can be involved in fine - tuning or long term control of this response .
furthermore , we show that ampk activation , similar to stretch , can promote smooth muscle differentiation in both portal vein and aorta .
ampk activation may thus play a role in stretch - dependent contractile differentiation of vascular smooth muscle .

primary mitochondrial diseases ( md ) are complex , heterogeneous inherited diseases caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear dna .
glomerular diseases in md have been reported with trna mutation m.3243a > g causing a syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) .
we describe here a case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) associated with a new trna mutation site .
a 34 - year - old man with a history of living related kidney transplantation , diabetes , hearing loss , and developmental delay presented to the outpatient clinic with complaints of new behavioral difficulties , worsening symptoms , and brain involvement on imaging .
physical examination was remarkable for difficulty hearing , a pattern of dysarthric speech , and cerebellar gait .
laboratory investigations including lactate levels were unremarkable .
based on this set of clinical circumstances , concern for an underlying genetic abnormality was raised .
multiple metabolic tests were unremarkable .
whole exome sequencing revealed a mitochondrial mt - tw trna change at position m.5538g > a. genotype - phenotype correlations are consistent with this trna mutation as a cause of his symptoms .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case describing fsgs - associated md caused by an m.5538 g > a mutation .
consideration of an underlying md should be made in patients presenting with deafness , neurologic changes , diabetes , and renal failure .
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) kidney transplantation mitochondrial disease hearing loss deafness whole exome sequencing introduction friedrich nietzsche ( 1844 - 1900 ) was perhaps one of the most influential german philosophers in history [ 1 ] .
his medical biography has intrigued many for decades , exemplifying a constellation of seemingly unrelated symptoms involving multiple organ systems , and has been a subject of controversy .
today , his symptoms have been widely thought to be secondary to a form of mitochondrial disease ( md ) called melas syndrome that includes mitochondrial encephalopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes .
melas syndrome is associated in ~ 80 % of cases with a mitochondrial gene mutation at position m.3243a > g [ 2 ] .
primary mds are complex , heterogeneous inherited diseases and they can be caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear dna .
mitochondria are transferred from mothers to their progeny in the oocyte and therefore genetic conditions involving the mitochondrial dna follow a maternal inheritance [ 3 ] .
phenotypic expression of mds can be highly variable [ 3 ] in part reflecting the ubiquitous distribution of mitochondria potentially affecting all tissues and organs .
over the past two decades , several patterns of renal diseases have been associated with mds , including glomerular disease , tubulopathies , cystic disease , and tubulointerstitial nephritis [ 4 ] .
the majority of patients diagnosed with md - associated renal disease are in their second or third decade of life and over half of these patients have chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) [ 3 ] .
while renal involvement in melas syndrome is uncommon , patients with m.3243a > g mutations can develop renal failure and proteinuria usually in association with diabetes , sensorineural hearing loss , and other neuromuscular deficits .
it is estimated that ~ 1 % of the diabetic population in europe and japan carry this genetic defect [ 5 ] .
approximately 80 % of patients with renal involvement have a hearing impairment and these patients can be misleadingly diagnosed with alport 's syndrome [ 6 ] .
the prevalent histological renal pathology finding in these patients with mitochondrial dna point mutations is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) [ 7 ] .
only a rare few other mitochondrial point mutations have been described to be associated with fsgs , and these are located at m.4269a > g , m.5728a > g , and m.a5843a > g [ 8 ] .
patients with mitochondrial dna deletions that cause kearns - sayre [ 9 , 10 ] and pearson syndromes [ 11 ] rarely have glomerular pathologies and most often develop renal tubular dysfunction and interstitial nephritis .
we describe here a case of fsgs - associated md caused by an m.5538g > a mutation , which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind .
an additional unique feature of this is the complex multiorgan involvement on a background of developmental delay , hearing loss , diabetes , and renal failure .
case report a 34 - year - old man with a history of end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) who underwent living related kidney transplantation in 2005 and had diabetes , hearing loss , hypertension , and mild developmental delay presented to the outpatient clinic with complaints of static encephalopathy ( permanent or unchanging brain dysfunction ) and worsening mri findings of progressive cortical and subcortical atrophy , calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellar dentate nuclei , subcortical white matter changes , and corpus callosum lesions .
at age 12 , he first noted bilateral progressive hearing decline secondary to a sensorineural deficit .
at age 14 , he developed non - nephrotic range proteinuria and underwent kidney biopsy that showed fsgs .
he subsequently developed esrd and required hemodialysis prior to receiving a living related kidney transplant from his father by age 24 .
following his kidney transplantation , he developed steroid - induced diabetes .
his kidney transplant course has otherwise been uncomplicated and he has had no indication for an allograft biopsy .
at the time of his clinic visit with us , his mother noted him to have new behavioral difficulties , specifically disorganized thought processes with complaints of disorderly conduct likely related to worsening brain abnormalities and raising concern for an underlying genetic abnormality .
during evaluation , the patient also suffered a stroke of the posterior right lentiform nucleus and posterior limb of the right internal capsule .
his social history was negative for tobacco , alcohol , or illicit drug usage .
the patient was able to finish high school and attend a year in community college .
he was the product of a normal pregnancy after a prior miscarriage .
his family pedigree is illustrated in figure 1 .
his medications included mycophenolate mofetil , tacrolimus , gemfibrozil , esomeprazole , and vitamin d. he has no allergies .
physical examination was remarkable for a mild cerebellar gait , decreased hearing , otherwise all other systems were largely negative including normal retinal exam .
laboratory investigations including lactate levels and other metabolic profiles were unremarkable .
whole exome sequencing revealed a mitochondrial mt - tw trna change at position m.5538g > a with 30 % heteroplasmy ( htp ) in blood as well as several variants of unknown significance in genes associated to diseases that do not correlate with patient 's phenotype or may only have a slight contribution to symptoms as illustrated in figure 2 .
genotype - phenotype correlation in this case is most consistent with this trna mutation as a cause of this patient 's symptoms .
discussion there is a paucity of data on genetic mitochondrial defects and their renal manifestations both in pediatric patients , and even more so in adults [ 4 ] .
this is reflective of their designation as rare diseases , phenotypic , and genotypic heterogeneity making them difficult to recognize and begging the need for initiatives to raise awareness , and improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the care of patients afflicted with mds .
organ systems and tissue types that are most severely affected by mds are those that are reliant on aerobic metabolism for atp production and oxidative phosphorylation , and this is particularly the case for the central nervous system and skeletal muscle .
renal manifestations in mds are rarely described in isolation and therefore the coexistence of neuromuscular symptoms and renal manifestations should raise the suspicion of an underlying md [ 3 ] .
identifying specific mutation sites involved in mitochondrial - associated renal diseases can help inform our diagnostic approaches while yielding valuable insight into the genetics of these conditions .
the case presented here therefore provides critical information on a new mitochondrial mt - tw trna change at position m.5538g > a that is potentially associated with the development of fsgs .
the m.3243a > g point mutation is the most commonly described mutation to date in mds that has been linked to renal disease .
in our case , whole exome sequencing did not reveal the presence of this point mutation .
several other gene variants were revealed in our patient ( figure 2 ) , however following literature review , genetic database consultation and detailed phenotyping of patient , the known conditions associated with these variants were not present in our case .
variant in the pdgfrb gene found in the case is common in the general population and is associated with familial brain calcification , however this variant could not account for the constellation of the other phenotypic changes that were present in our patient .
additionally , none of these other variants have been associated with fsgs to the best of our knowledge .
mitochondrial trna mutations have been involved in a host of syndromes ranging from single symptom to multi - systemic disease .
the trnatrp mutation found in this patient has been linked to mitochondrial myopathy , leigh syndrome , myoclonic epilepsy , and various encephalomyopathies [ 12 ] .
skeletal muscles usually reveal ragged red fibers , cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers , abnormal mitochondria on electron microscopy , and electron transport chain deficiencies on biochemical testing [ 13 ] .
due to our patient 's frail condition and multiple co - morbidities , a muscle biopsy was declined .
mitochondrial function tests such as respiratory chain enzyme activities can be performed on fresh renal tissue , but this is mostly available on a research basis [ 4 ] .
tissue can also be obtained from other sources such as in blood peripheral leukocytes and skin fibroblasts for functional analysis however , mds and their manifestations can be tissue specific and therefore some cases can be missed .
a limitation of our case presented is that we were unable to obtain kidney tissue for functional analysis .
serum lactate levels have generally been measured in cases of suspected mds , however lactate levels can be normal such as in our patient [ 4 ] .
this means that the diagnosis of mds relies upon recognition of clinical manifestations and information obtained from a detailed family history ultimately confirmed by molecular testing .
due to these factors , the incidence of renal - associated mds is in all likelihood underestimated .
known mitochondrial trna mutations that have been associated with kidney disease are summarized in table 1 .
interestingly , 2 other patients who have been reported carrying the m.5538g > a mutation had very different symptoms compared to our patient which included myoclonic epilepsy , cataract , pigmentary retinopathy , hypothyroidism , and mild myopathy in the proband ( 65 % htp in muscle , 5 % in blood ) and only hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus in the proband 's mother ( 20 % htp in muscle ) [ 13 ] .
this discrepancy is not uncommon with mtdna disease and may be related to mutation heteroplasmy level and tissue segregation .
our patient was noted to develop diabetes after beginning steroid therapy as part of his immunosuppressive regimen .
however , it is likely that his mitochondrial disease predisposed him to develop diabetes at such an early age .
we also note that other anti - codon stem mutations in the mitochondrial transfer rnatrp at position m.5540g > a present with early onset hearing loss , abnormal brain imaging including basal ganglia calcification , and marked overall brain atrophy with white matter changes very much similar to our case [ 14 ] .
none of the patients reported with the m.5540g > a mutation had any renal involvement but they were young in age compared to our patient and kidney involvement may have been missed at the time of the initial evaluation .
due to the association of mds with deafness and difficulties with defining clear inheritance patterns in some cases , patients with mds can be mistakenly diagnosed with alport 's syndrome [ 5 ] .
on review of two studies that screened a total of 90 patients with alport 's syndrome for the melas mutation , 2 patients were found to be misdiagnosed [ 5 , 15 ] .
in mds , hematuria is usually absent and disruption of the glomerular basement - membrane characteristic of alport 's syndrome on renal histopathology is also absent .
therefore , the presence or absence of hematuria may help to distinguish between mds and alport 's syndrome. of note , patients with alport 's syndrome can present with fsgs on kidney biopsy and therefore , this cannot be used as a feature to distinguish between the two conditions [ 16 , 17 ] .
mutations in the col4a3 - 5 genes that encode alpha - chains of glomerular basement membrane collage type iv are classically associated with alport 's syndrome , and recent studies have shown that these mutations can be associated with fsgs [ 18 ] .
in our patient , whole exome sequencing did not reveal col4a3 - 5 mutations .
while no cure currently exists for the management of md - associated renal disease , organ transplantation remains a therapeutic option as in the case of our patient .
patients with md are generally at risk for worsening of their disease by the catabolic stress associated with transplantation and associated risks of infection or medication - related toxicity .
however , in a recent case series that examined the largest group of post - transplant patients ( 35 patients ) with primary mds to - date who underwent either liver , kidney , or heart transplantation , the majority of patients did not have worsening of their md within 90 days of their transplantation [ 19 ] .
the authors also reported that post - transplant complications , including organ rejection , were not a common occurrence .
our patient has had an uncomplicated post - transplant course following a living related kidney transplant from his father .
as mitochondrial dna diseases are maternally transmitted , we would not expect the father to carry the same dna change .
if the diagnosis of maternally inherited mitochondrial disease is known prior to transplant , maternal family donors should be avoided as they may also carry the mutation .
in conclusion , consideration of an underlying md should be made in patients presenting with the constellation of deafness , neurologic changes , diabetes , and proteinuric renal failure .
the case presented here adds to our current understanding of md - associated renal disease and is the first to provide genotype - phenotype evidence of a new fsgs - associated md located at position m.5538 g > a. funding sources none .

the control of morphology , composition and dispersability of mapbx3 perovskite nanocrystals is crucial for the property tailoring and still a major challenge .
here we report the synthesis of colloidal mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanocrystals at room temperature by using alkyl carboxylate as capping ligands .
these nanocrystals exhibit continuously tunable uv - vis absorption and photoluminescence ( pl ) across the visible spectrum , which is attributed to the quantum confinement effect with certain stoichiometry .
their unique exciton recombination dynamics was investigated and discussed .
lead halide based perovskites have become famous semiconductor materials for their industrial prospect in solar cells .
up to date , the efficiency of perovskite solar cells has unceasingly boosted up to 22.1 % 123456789 .
the application potentials of perovskites in light emitting devices1011121314151617 and lasers1819 were also demonstrated .
in nanometer scale , the huge specific surface area and thus the abundant interface or surface states of the perovskites exhibit prominent effects on the electronic and photoelectronic properties .
therefore , the challenge emerges for chemists of nano - science and - technology to develop synthesis methods to achieve size - controllable perovskite nanocrystals .
in the most recent year , colloidal cesium lead halide perovskites nanocrystals and nanowires were successfully synthesized .
kovalenko et al. reported the synthesis of highly luminescent perovskite cspbx3 ( x = cl , br , i ) of 4 - 15 nm , with the photoluminescence tuned within 410 - 700 nm2021 .
yang et al. developed a solution synthesis of single - crystalline cspbx3 ( x = cl , br , i ) nanowires22 .
prato et al. further found that the composition of perovskite nanocrystals can be feasibly tuned by post - synthesis halide anion exchange23 .
despite the success for the all - inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite colloidal nanocrystals , the synthesis methods of colloidal organometal halide perovskite nanocrystals are comparably less developed .
although there are numerous literatures on preparing organic - inorganic perovskite micro / nanocrystals , most of them are synthesized or grow on substrates .
for examples , the synthesis of mapbi3 nanoplates and nanowires on substrates were demonstrated by jin24 , horvath25 , gratzel and park et al.26 .
we reported the synthesis of mapbi3 crystals on porous tio2 substrate with the size controllable within 40 - 700 nm27 .
the substrates served as a scaffold for the precursors were used to control the perovskite growth kinetics2728293031 .
however , the substrates prevented from scale up the products and the generality for different substrates is limited .
recently , advances have been made in synthesis of mapbx3 ( x = br , i , cl ) nanocrystals in solution without a substrate3233343536 .
all these reported methods use organic ammonium cation with a long alkyl chain , such as the octylammonium bromide ( ch3 ( ch2 ) 7nh3br ) or octadecylammonium bromide ( ch3 ( ch2 ) 17nh3br ) .
the ammonium cation serves as the surface capping ligands of the nanocrystals , limiting the crystal growth in one , two or three dimensions .
in this article , we use a different surface modulation strategy by applying alkyl carboxylate , the lead oleate ( pb ( ch3 ( ch2 ) 7ch = ch ( ch2 ) 7coo ) 2 , abbreviated as pb ( oa ) 2 ) , as both the lead resource and capping ligands .
the as synthesized mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanocrystals exhibit continuously tunable uv - vis absorption and photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra across the visible realm , which is attributed to the size related quantum confinement effect with a fixed stoichiometry of the halide composition .
results and discussion the reaction solution contains two solvents , the cyclohexane and the isopropanol .
the pb ( oa ) 2 is soluble in the former , and the mai or mabr ( or the mixture ) is soluble in the later .
when these two solutions are mixed at room temperature , mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) forms immediately which can be easily identified by the color change and the photoluminescence under a portable 365 nm ultraviolet lamp ( fig. 1 ) .
the xrd spectra of the typical products are shown in fig. 2 ( and figures s1 - s4 in supporting information ) .
for the samples p - i - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , strong split peaks at 14.0degrees and 14.1degrees that respectively corresponding to ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) crystal plane and the split peaks of the ( 004 ) and ( 220 ) peaks can be clearly identified .
this split feature verified that the as prepared mapbi3 are tetragonal perovskite phase ( space group i4 / mcm ) 3738394041 .
while for the rest of the samples containing br - , no split can be identified at ( 001 ) or ( 002 ) peaks , indicating they are cubic phased perovskite ( space group pm - 3m ) .
the perovskite phases via the regulation of i - and br - are generally observed by various researchers38394041 .
for all the samples no impurity of mai or pb ( oa ) 2 is found .
this may due to the fast reaction rate and excess amount of mai to consume the pb ( oa ) 2 .
also none of the other known and related manpbim ( n , m = 2,4 , 3,5 , 4,6 ) phases are observed41 .
for all the samples of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanocrystals , the typical ftir vibration modes of organolead halide perovskites are distinctly presented ( figure s5 ) .
the 3300 - 3000 cm - 1 broad strong peak is assigned to n - h stretching ; the 2950 - 2820 cm - 1 peaks are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 and ch33642434445 ; the peak at 1730 - 1630 cm - 1 corresponds to the coo - modes and the peak at 1440 - 1360 cm - 1 is assigned to the c - h bending44 .
the symmetric o - h stretch and antisymmetric o - h stretch of h2o were not found in 3600 - 3800 cm - 1 from figure s5 .
thus , no adsorbed h2o was detected , suggesting its good temporary stability in ambient air condition .
the good dispersability of the perovskites in cyclohexane also suggests that the surface of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanocrystals is coordinated by oleate ligand , like typical oleate or alkylamines modified colloidal nanocrystals .
the schematic illustration of a perovskite nanocrystal stabilized by oleate as surface ligands is shown in fig. 3 ( a ) .
figure 3 ( b,c ) are typical tem and hrtem images of perovskite nanocrystals of sample p - br - 5 , respectively .
it indicates that these nanocrystals are well dispersed and the measured crystal lattice matches well with the that of the mapbbr33236 .
else tem images of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) can be found in figures s6 - s8 .
the sem measurement indicates that with the decrement of ma : pb from 5:1 to 2:1 , the size of all the as synthesized mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanoparticles increases to ~ 300 nm ( fig. 4 ) .
this trend may find its origin in the nucleation and growth mechanism .
take the nucleation and growth of mapbi3 as an example , the reaction in the solution is as follows : the alkyl carboxylate , lead oleate pb ( oa ) 2 , acts as not only as the lead resource to react with mai , but also as the capping ligands .
in addition , the reaction rate is higher with the higher mai concentration .
the faster the nucleation bursts , the more completely pb ( oa ) 2 consumed in solution in a short time , leading to smaller mapbi3 nanocrystals .
while in relatively lower mai concentration , the nucleation rate is slower and the perovskite growth is dominated following the nucleation , resulting bigger mapbi3 nanocrystals .
obviously , it shows significance for all these perovskite materials .
the uv - vis absorption spectra and corresponding pl spectra of four sets of samples ( p - i - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , p - i3br2 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , p - i1br1 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , p - br - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 ) are shown in fig. 5. the band edge absorption peak locates at 764 nm for big mapbi3 nanocrystals ( p - i - 2 , ~ 300 nm by sem ) .
it undergoes a blue shift to 735 nm for smaller mapbi3 nanocrystals ( p - i - 5 , ~ 5 nm by tem ) .
accordingly , the photoluminescence ( pl ) peak shifts from 767 nm to 747 nm with the size decreasing .
the synthesized mapbbr3 and mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) nanocrystals also show similar uv - vis absorption and pl spectra dependent on the size .
this size related monotonic blue shift of both spectra can be induced by the intrinsic quantum confinement effect , for the small crystal size is comparable to the bohr diameter of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) 4647484950 .
there remains only one concern , that since the spectra of p - i3br2 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 and p - i1br1 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 are over lapped , it is doubtful if the spectrum shift is caused by the component deviation. by comparing the xrd peaks of p - i3br2 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 and p - i1br1 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , this possibility is excluded .
as shown in fig. 6 , the ( 002 ) and ( 201 ) peaks of each set are separated from each other , while almost fixed for a same set .
it suggests that the perovskites of the same sets have the same crystal parameter , thus have the same component .
also , the widening of the xrd peaks indicates the size of nanocrystals decreases ( figures s1 - s3 ) .
these features further support the intrinsic quantum confinement effect for the observed spectra shift .
the pl lifetimes of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) were measured ( figures s9 - 11 ) to get insight into the exciton recombination dynamics .
these pl decays can be well fitted by the bi - exponential function ( figure s12 ) : where tau1 and tau2 are the fitted decay lifetimes ; a1 and a2 are the weighting parameters .
the average lifetime tauave is calculated by equation ( 3 ) : the results are shown in table 1 .
it suggests two dynamics , a fast decay ( tau1 ) and a longer - lived component ( tau2 ). with the decreasing size of the nanocrystal or the blue shift of the pl peak , the tauave increases for samples of p - i - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 , p - i1br1 - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 and p - br - 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 .
for sample p - i - 2 , it has a very short lifetime tauave of 3.0 ns. the lifetime of the sample p - i - 5 is incredibly prolonged to 166.2 ns. this lifetime range covers the ever reported lifetimes of tetragonal mapbi3 in the form of nanowire , nanorod , film or bulk ( table 2 ) .
a very short lifetime of p - i - 2 indicates that there exist high effective nonradiative recombination channels in the material505152 .
it is proposed to be chemical or structural defects in the mapbi3 nanocrystals .
the long lifetime of the sample p - i - 5 is unexpected , because it has a big specific surface area which may induce vast surface states .
possibly it suggests that the surface of mapbi3 nanocrystals is well passivated by the oleate ligands535455 .
it was noticed that from p - i - 2 to p - i - 5 , both tau1 and tau2 increase drastically .
the fast decay tau1 of p - i - 5 is 25.5 ns , a value much bigger than the slow decay tau2 of p - i - 2 4.8 ns. the mechanisms how the tau1 and tau2 are separately or cohesively tuned are presently unclear .
however , it is not likely to originate from quantum confinement effect , but more possible related to the surface or defect states and charge carrier delocalization in mapbi320 .
for the samples from p - i1br1 - 2 to p - i1br1 - 5 , the lifetime tauave boosts from 1.1 to 42.1 ns. while for the samples from p - br - 2 to p - br - 5 , the lifetime tauave only increases from 13.0 to 17.1 ns , with the small pl peak shift from 532 to 525 nm. compared with mapbbr3 single crystal or film ( table 2 ) , these as prepared mapbbr3 nanocrystals exhibit shorter lifetime , suggesting more nonradiative recombination effect involved135657 .
unfortunately , there was no lifetime data of mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) quantum dots synthesized by using ammonium cation with a long alkyl chain as surface capping ligands3536373839 .
further investigation on how surface ligands type would affect the fluorescence lifetime may give us a deeper understanding of the exciton recombination dynamics , and thus better control of the pl for future use in construction of devices .
conclusions organometal halide perovskite mapbbrxi3 - x ( 0 <= x <= 3 ) colloidal nanocrystals were synthesized by mixing pb ( oa ) 2 cyclohexane solution and max ( x = i or / and br ) isopropanol solution .
the size of the perovskites was successfully controlled by the oleate as the ligands , and also by the pb : ma ratio .
the uv - vis absorption and pl spectra show a blue shift as the size decreasing monotonically , which is ascribed for quantum confinement effect .
significantly , these colloidal organometal halide perovskite nanocrystals were dispersed well in nonpolar organic solvent , e.g. toluene or cyclohexane .
this would be useful for fabricating perovskite thin films in various substrates such as silicon , polymer or glass .
in addition to the method could be generally applied to synthesize other organometal halide perovskite materials , this study would bring chances to the design and fabrication of new photovoltaic and electronic devices .

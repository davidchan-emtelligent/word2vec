background trehalose synthase ( tres ) which converts maltose to trehalose is considered to be a potential biocatalyst for trehalose production .
this enzymatic process has the advantage of simple reaction and employs an inexpensive substrate .
therefore , new tres producing bacteria with suitable enzyme properties are expected to be isolated from extreme environment .
results six tres producing strains were isolated from a specimen obtained from soil of the tibetan plateau using degenerate pcr .
a novel tres gene from enterobacter hormaechei was amplified using thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr .
the gene contained a 1626 bp open reading frame encoding 541 amino acids .
the gene was expressed in escherichia coli , and the recombinant tres was purified and characterized .
the purified tres had a molecular mass of 65 kda and an activity of 18.5 u / mg. the optimum temperature and ph for the converting reaction were 37degreesc and 6 , respectively .
hg2 + , zn2 + , cu2 + and sds inhibited the enzyme activity at different levels whereas mn2 + showed an enhancing effect by 10 % .
conclusion in this study , several tres producing strains were screened from a source of soil bacteria .
the characterization of the recombinant tres of enterobacter hormaechei suggested its potential application .
consequently , a strategy for isolation of tres producing strains and cloning of novel tres genes from natural sources was demonstrated .
background trehalose , a non - reducing disaccharide with two glucoses linked by a 1 , 1 - glycosidic linkage , is widespread throughout the biology world .
in some lower orders of plants and fungi , this disaccharide is mainly stored as a source for carbon and energy [ 1 ] .
in the animal kingdom it is abundant and e.g. insects use it as a source for glucose to provide sufficient energy during flight [ 2 ] .
in yeast and bacteria , it was reported that trehalose could protect cells from a variety of physical and chemical stresses , such as freezing , heat , desiccation , acidic conditions , and osmotic and oxidative stress [ 3,4 ] .
due to its desirable characteristics , it has been also applied as an additive , stabilizer and preservative to food , cosmetics , as well as medicinal and biological reagents [ 5 ] .
at present , many trehalose synthesizing enzymes systems have been reported in microorganisms [ 6 ] .
there are three pathways widely distributed among them : ( 1 ) phosphate - based enzyme complex systems : trehalose is synthesized through the transfer of the glucosyl moiety from udp - glucose to glucose - 1 - phosphate , forming the intermediate trehalose - 6 - phosphate which was then hydrolyzed by phosphatase to yield free trehalose [ 7,8 ] .
( 2 ) a two - step enzyme system with maltooligosyl trehalose synthase ( trey ) and maltooligosyl trehalose trehalohydrolase ( trez ) were found for trehalose biosynthesis in arthrobacter sp .
[ 9 ] , brevibacterium helvolum [ 10 ] and bradyrhizobium [ 11 ] .
( 3 ) tres synthesizing trehalose from maltose in one step was found only in bacteria [ 12 ] .
we are most interested in tres as a simple biocatalyst for trehalose production .
up to now , a few tres genes from different bacterial species have been reported to be cloned , expressed and characterized , including pseudomonas stutzeri cj38 [ 13 ] , pimelobacter sp .
r48 [ 14 ] , mycobacterium smegmatis [ 15 ] , arthrobacter aurescens [ 16 ] , propionibacterium freudenreichii [ 17 ] , corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 [ 18 ] and some thermophilic strains [ 19 - 21 ] .
the tibetan plateau is a high - altitude region where it can be assumed that bacteria are frequently exposed to stress conditions , such as cold , hypoxia , nutritional stress and high ultraviolet radiation .
the microorganisms in this environment have received much interest because of their special properties [ 22 ] .
therefore , it is highly desirable to develop an effective strategy for isolation and subsequent screening of new tres from the extreme environment in this study , several tres producing strains were screened from soil bacteria derived from the plateau soil sample by degenerate pcr based on the analysis of conserved domains .
the full - length of the novel tres gene of enterobacter hormaechei was obtained by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr ( tail - pcr ) .
subsequently , the gene was expressed in escherichia coli ( e. coli ) , and the recombinant tres was purified and characterized .
results and discussion gene sequence analysis and strain screenings by multiple alignment analysis , the four highly conserved motifs he / qpdln , nhdeld / tle , girrrlap and ygdeigmgd were found among protein sequences of tres published at ncbi ( figure 1 ) .
the nhdeld / tle domain ( the df2 primer region ) had the feature of glycoside hydrolase ( gh ) family 16 site , suggesting that the identified tres gene encoding products possibly had hydrolytic activity .
in addition , there were some other motifs identified by sequence alignment with relatively lower homologies , including n / qhtsdq / ah , gfrl / ada , vrtpmqw and ggfs ( figure 1 ) .

among the 86 bacterial strains isolated from the plateau soil sample , 6 different bacterial species were identified to be tres positive .
amplified core regions were sequenced and showed different similarity to relevant genes as summarized in table 1 .
this result provided evidence for the distribution of tres producing bacteria in extreme environment .

its 3 ' and 5 ' flanking sequences were amplified by tail - pcr. by this a 1626 bp open reading frame ( orf ) sequence was obtained , encoding 541 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass ( mr ) of 61.8 kda .
as analyzed by ncbi blast , the full - length orf of the enterobacter hormaechei tres gene showed the highest similarity with several encoding sequences of tres from klebsiella pneumoniae 342 ( cp000964 , 815 / 1161 , 70 %) , pseudomonas stutzeri a1501 ( nc000304 , 386 / 569 , 67 %) and pseudomonas aeruginosa pa7 ( cp000744 , 730 / 1119 , 65 %) .
all of the conserved regions mentioned above were found in enterobacter hormaechei tres ( figure 1 ) .
besides the gh16 domain , other active sites of glycosidase ( h ... d ... e ... hd ) were also observed in most bacterial tres ( figure 1 ) , as reported by chen [ 20 ] .
it is also reported that a glycosidase of thermobifida fusca had tres activity [ 21 ] .
therefore , it was suggested that tres might employ a hydrolysis mechanism .
expression and purification of recombinant tres the pet30a (+) - tres plasmid was transformed into the e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) plyss expression host , and cells were induced by isopropyl beta - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) .
when compared to the sample without induction , only the induced cells containing the recombinant vector expressed an extra 65 kda protein ( figure 2 ) .
the recombinant protein was about 3 kda heavier than the predicted mr of 61.8 kda , which was due to the additional 46 amino acids including the 6 - his tag at the n ' terminus .
figure 2 sds - page analysis of samples during tres purification .

67 mg of recombinant tres were purified from the supernatant of cell lysate containing 589 mg of crude protein .
soluble recombinant protein was effectively purified at a yield of 11.4 % ( w / w ) of the total soluble protein .
the final preparation showed a single band with an mr of approximately 65 kda ( figure 2 ) .
activity assay of recombinant tres and products assay of catalytic reaction tres activity was detected with purified tres in reactions of the conversion between maltose and trehalose .
it was confirmed that the cloned fragment was the intrinsically coding sequence of active tres .
the highest activity was calculated to be 18.5 u / mg. the activity value was lower than that of the recombinant tres of pseudomonas stutzeri cj38 [ 13 ] , but close to that of the recombinant tres of mycobacterium smegmatis [ 15 ] .
the amount of glucose was also detected by ion chromatography ( ic ) ( figure 3 ) and shown to be consistent with the features of glycoside hydrolase as discussed above .
commonly , glucose is released in most of the conversion reactions of bacterial - derived tres [ 14 - 21 ] .
the small amount of glucose is generated under entry of a water molecule into the catalytic pocket to induce hydrolysis prior to formation of the glycosidic linkage [ 19 ] .
individually , tres from pseudomonas stutzeri cj38 was the only one reported without generation of glucose as a byproduct [ 13 ] .
we found relatively low homology between the two tres from enterobacter hormaechei and pseudomonas stutzeri cj38 ( data not shown ) , indicating that there exists a structural difference in the functional role .
hence , in order to improve the efficiency of the major trehalose formation , the strategy to screen the enzyme without byproducts still remains to be further exploited .
figure 3 ic assay of reaction products .
reaction mixtures containing 400 mul purified tres solution and 100 mul maltose ( 500 mm ) substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 6 ) were incubated at 37degreesc for 2 h. the reaction mixtures were subsequently analyzed by ic , as described in the " methods " section .
peak 1 , trehalose ; peak 2 , glucose ; peak 3 , buffer reagent ; peak 4 , maltose .
the effect of ph and temperature on recombinant tres activity the conversion rate of recombinant tres was constantly above 30 % ( equivalent to 65 % of the maximal activity ) at a broad ph range of 4 to 9 , and reached the highest activity at ph 6 ( figure 4a ) .
the maximal conversion rate of 48 % was observed at the optimum temperature of 37degreesc ( figure 4b ) .
the optimum temperature was similar to that of pseudomonas stutzeri cj38 [ 13 ] , mycobacterium smegmatis [ 15 ] , arthrobacter aurescens [ 16 ] and thermus caldophilus [ 23 ] .
although the conversion from maltose to trehalose could be accelerated at high temperatures ( data not shown ) , tres could produce more byproduct glucose when the temperature was increased [ 21,23 ] .
thus , it is probably more efficient to carry out conversions at moderate temperatures .
in this report , the recombinant tres showed a stable performance under the wide working conditions ( ph 4 - 9 and 20 - 55degreesc , figure 4 ) .
it suggested that the enzyme might be a candidate for trehalose production .
figure 4 effect of ph and temperature on tres activity .
( a ) effect of ph on tres activity .
the enzyme activity of tres at various phs was assayed at 37degreesc in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 2 - 10.5 ) for 30 min , using 100 mm maltose as a substrate ; ( b ) effect of temperature on tres activity .
the enzyme activity of tres at various temperatures was assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7 ) for 30 min , using 100 mm maltose as a substrate .
the effects of metal ions and reagents on recombinant tres activity recombinant tres activity could be influenced by several ions and reagents at different levels .
the enzyme was strongly inhibited by hg2 + , zn2 + and cu2 + for more than 40 % and by sds for about 90 % .
other ions and chemical reagent , such as mg2 + , fe2 + , na + , nh4 + and edta , had no obvious effect , whereas ca2 + and mn2 + increased the activity slightly ( table 2 ) .
besides , tres was inactivated by addition of beta - mercaptoethanol ( beta - me ) , which supports the hypothesis of a structural dependence on disulfide - bonds .

kinetics of recombinant tres activity the km values for recombinant e. hormaechei tres were found to be 25 mm for maltose and 75 mm for trehalose .
vmax values of 1.4 mm / min / mg protein for maltose and 3.2 mm / min / mg protein for trehalose were calculated , respectively. with regard to these results , the recombinant tres had a higher affinity to maltose and a favorite reaction direction toward the synthesis of trehalose .
interestingly , all reported tres enzymes share the feature of a reversible conversion at different degrees .
conclusion in summary , some tres producing strains had been isolated from natural environment based on conserved domains and degenerate pcr .
the tres gene from enterobacter hormaechei was cloned by tail - pcr and expressed successfully .
the characterization of the recombinant tres suggested its potential application for trehalose production from maltose .
thus , the general applicability of this strategy for isolation of tres producing strains and cloning of novel tres genes from natural sources was demonstrated .
methods bacterial strains , media and culture conditions bacterial strains obtained from a tibetan plateau soil specimen were grown and enriched in nutrient broth medium ( pepton1 % w / v , beef extract 0.3 % w / v , nacl 0.5 % w / v ) at 30degreesc for 2 days .
arthrobacter aurescens , serving as a tres positive control , was obtained from china general microbiological culture collection center ( cgmcc1.1892 ). e. coli top10 was used for construction of recombinant plasmids. e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) plyss ( novagen , germany ) was used as expression host and grown in lb medium containing 50 mug / ml kanamycin ( kan ) and 34 mug / ml chloramphenicol ( cam ) after transformation .
gene sequence analysis and strain screenings all bacterial tres sequences published in the ncbi database were collected and analyzed by the multiple sequence alignment program clustal w2 . as shown in figure 1 , four degenerate primers ( df1 , 2 and dr1 , 2 ) were synthesized based on the conserved domains ( see additional file 1 for the primer sequences ) .
dna preparation of bacterial strains isolated from the soil specimen was performed by alkaline lysis [ 24 ] .
degenerate pcr was carried out according to the parameters optimized with the genome dna template of arthrobacter aurescens .
pcr products were separated on a 1 % agarose gel , recovered by using a gel extraction kit ( tiangen , beijing , china ) , and sub - cloned into the pmd18 - t vector ( takara , dalian , china ) for sequence analysis ( sunbio , beijing , china ) .
the sequenced fragments were analyzed by blast . all isolated positive strains were subsequently identified by their 16srrna sequence .
cloning of the tres gene of enterobacter hormaechei and construction of the expression vector tail - pcr was performed to amplify the 3 ' and 5 ' fragments of enterobacter hormaechei tres .
the pu and pd primers ( see additional file 1 ) for tail - pcr were designed and synthesized according to the core region amplified in degenerate pcr .
the reaction parameters and the ad primers for tail - pcr were referred to previous reports [ 25,26 ] .
the full length of tres was assembled from 3 ' , 5 ' fragments and the core region .
the deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed by dnaman 1.0 .
the tresf and tresr primers ( see additional file 1 ) were synthesized to introduce nco i and not i sites into the 3 ' and 5 ' ends of tres orf , respectively .
the pcr product was digested by nco i and not i , and inserted into the same digested pet30a (+) vector ( novagen , cat no .
69909 - 3 , darmstadt , germany ) to generate his - tagged pet30a (+) - tres .
the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by dna sequencing and transformed to the e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) plyss .
protein expression and purification the e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) plyss transformed with pet30a (+) - tres was cultured in lb medium containing 50 mug / ml kan and 34 mug / ml cam in a shaker at 220 rpm and 37degreesc until an od600 of 0.6 was reached .
these cells were induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mm iptg and grown at 25degreesc for an addition of 4 h. cell extracts were analyzed by 12.5 % ( w / w ) sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) .
gels with expressed protein were analyzed by a molecular imager ( r ) gel doctm xr system 170 - 8170 ( bio - rad , hercules ca , usa ) using the quantity one - 4.6.3 1 - d analysis software .
for purification , cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mm kh2po4 - k2hpo4 , 500 mm nacl , ph 7.9 ) followed by sonification and centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4degreesc to remove insoluble cell debris .
the 6 - his tagged protein in supernatant fraction was purified by using a ni - nta affinity chromatography column ( neb , beijing , china ) .
protein concentrations were determined by the bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard [ 27 ] .
activity assay of recombinant tres the catalytic reaction was performed in a mixture containing the tres solution and 100 mm maltose in 50 mm phosphate buffer ( ph 6 ) at 37degreesc for 2 h. samples were taken at different time intervals during the reaction and boiled for 10 min to stop the reaction .
the reaction mixtures were separated by thin layer chromatography on g - 60 tlc silica plates ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) using a solvent system of 1 - butanol / pyridine / water ( 4:5:1 , v / v ) .
products released by tres were quantified by ic using a dionex2500 system equipped with a carbopacpa ( tm ) 20 column .
one unit ( u ) of tres was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 mumol trehalose per min under the specified conditions [ 23 ] .
the conversion rate was calculated by the ratio of the trehalose product to the amount of maltose substrate .
properties of recombinant tres the optimum ph of tres was assayed by incubating the purified enzyme with 100 mm maltose substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph 2 to 10.5 and 37degreesc for 30 min , respectively .
the optimum temperature for tres activity was determined at 10 to 60degreesc using the same buffer at ph 7 for 30 min , respectively .
to determine the effect of metal ions and different chemical reagents on tres , its activity was also assayed in the presence of these ions or compounds at 1 mm , respectively .

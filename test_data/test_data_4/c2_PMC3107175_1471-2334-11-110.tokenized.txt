background the classical spoligotyping technique , relying on membrane reverse line - blot hybridization of the spacers of the mycobacterium tuberculosis crispr locus , is used world - wide ( 598 references in pubmed on april 8th , 2011 ) .
however , until now no inter - laboratory quality control study had been undertaken to validate this technique .
we analyzed the quality of membrane - based spoligotyping by comparing it to the recently introduced and highly robust microbead - based spoligotyping .
nine hundred and twenty - seven isolates were analyzed totaling 39,861 data points .
samples were received from 11 international laboratories with a worldwide distribution .
methods the high - throughput microbead - based spoligotyping was performed on ctab and thermolyzate dna extracted from isolated mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( mtc ) strains coming from the genotyping participating centers .
information regarding how the classical spoligotyping method was performed by center was available .
genotype discriminatory analyses were carried out by comparing the spoligotypes obtained by both methods .
the non parametric u - mann whitney homogeneity test and the spearman rank correlation test were performed to validate the observed results .
results seven out of the 11 laboratories ( 63 %) , perfectly typed more than 90 % of isolates , 3 scored between 80 - 90 % and a single center was under 80 % reaching 51 % concordance only .
however , this was mainly due to discordance in a single spacer , likely having a non - functional probe on the membrane used .
the centers using thermolyzate dna performed as well as centers using the more extended ctab extraction procedure .
few centers shared the same problematic spacers and these problematic spacers were scattered over the whole crispr locus ( mostly spacers 15 , 14 , 18 , 37 , 39 , 40 ) .
conclusions we confirm that classical spoligotyping is a robust method with generally a high reliability in most centers .
the applied dna extraction procedure ( ctab or thermolyzate ) did not affect the results in this study .
however performance was center - dependent , suggesting that training is a key component in quality assurance of spoligotyping .
overall , no particular spacer yielded a higher degree of deviating results , suggesting that errors occur randomly either in the process of re - using membranes , or during the reading of the results and transferring of data from the film to a digital file .
last , the performance of the microbead - based method was excellent as previously shown by cowan et al .
( j. clin. microbiol. 2004 ) and zhang et al .
( j. med. microbiol. 2009 ) and demonstrated the proper detection of spacer 15 that is known to occasionally give weak signals in the classical spoligotyping .
background clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats ( crisprs ) are a family of dna repeats of 21 to 37 bp that are separated by regularly sized , non repetitive unique dna spacer sequences [ 1 ] .
crisprs are present in the genomes of most bacteria ( 40 %) and archaea ( 90 %) [ 2 ] .
it is believed that some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements [ 1 ] and it has been shown that they confer '' immunity '' against bacteriophages and plasmids [ 2 - 4 ] .
studies on the crispr region of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( mtc ) strains started in 1993 [ 5 ] .
in 1995 , spoligotyping was for the first time mentioned in the article describing the beijing genotype of mycobacterium tuberculosis [ 6 ] .
in 1997 , kamerbeek et al. provided a standardized reverse line blot hybridization method ( spacer oligonucleotide typing = spoligotyping ) to genotype mtc complex strains based on polymorphism of this region , and soon after , corresponding membranes were commercialized [ 7,8 ] .
since then , numerous studies have used spoligotyping often combined with others markers to assess the diversity of mtc strains .
spoligotyping appeared especially suitable as a simple and cheap tool to distinguish genotype families of this bacterium .
almost all international spoligotyping results have been submitted to an international database , spoldb http :// www.pasteur - guadeloupe.fr : 8081 / sitvitdemo / that has already been updated 4 times [ 8 ] .
recent studies point to the potential use of crispr loci for molecular epidemiological studies of other pathogens [ 9 ] , and an increased knowledge of these bacterial genomic structures is likely to foster the development of new high - throughput genotyping methods , either for studies on population structure or molecular epidemiology .
while spoligotyping does not differentiate m. tuberculosis isolates with the same level of discrimination as is6110 - rflp ( restriction fragment length polymorphism ) [ 10 ] or miru - vntr ( mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units - variable number of tandem repeats ) [ 11 ] it has several advantages [ 12 ] : i ) it relies on a single pcr amplification which requires much less dna quantities than is6110 - rflp so that even smear - positive sputum samples can be directly analyzed , ii ) up to 40 dna samples can be analyzed within one day with the classical method and up to 186 with the novel microbead - based spoligotyping that has proven very reliable [ 13,14 ] , iii ) isolates with less than 6 copies of the is6110 insertion element are better discriminated by spoligotyping than by is6110 - rflp typing , and iv ) spoligotyping patterns can distinguish between main lineages and sublineages within the m. tuberculosis complex ( mtc ) making them phylogenetically informative except in the rare cases where the exact same deletions ( covering the exact same spacers ) occurred by convergent evolution [ 9,14 - 17 ] .
the classical spoligotyping described by kamerbeek et al. revised by van embden et al. is a robust method with an intra - laboratory reproducibility over 90 % in well - trained laboratories [ 7,18 ] .
however it can be affected by several issues : ( i ) it relies on the quality of the pre - prepared membrane and this has proven difficult even when commercialized ; ( ii ) spoligotyping does not yield black or white results and reading is sometimes subjective ; only results double checked by experienced staff seem reliable but this technically demanding procedure is not always implemented in specialized labs , ( iii ) the repeated use of the same membrane may be the cause of technical artifacts , ( iv ) data entry and classification are performed manually with an increased likelihood of errors during transcription [ 19 ] .
all these issues might have impaired reliability in international genetic databases that have been compiled so far ( spoldb projects ) .
the transfer of the classical spoligotyping method into an advanced platform represents a technical progress because it allows to produce a numerical raw result format and a standardized signal / noise cut - off determination , ensuring both a high throughput and an high quality [ 13,14 ] .
hence , the aims of this study were to : ( i ) retrospectively assess the global quality of spoligotyping results that have been produced in various laboratories worldwide during a decade by comparing their data with those provided by the new , highly reliable system , ( ii ) give a feedback to the laboratories about their data production quality , ( iii ) solve uncertainties on samples in which centers are not confident , ( iv ) study if the dna extraction procedure may influence membrane - based spoligotyping results , ( v ) assess the possible contribution of the microbead - based technique to an increased quality of services in molecular epidemiological studies .
altogether , this article identifies the main pitfalls in crispr data production , at a time when tuberculosis spoligotyping still inflates and is transferred towards other micro - organisms .
methods oligonucleotides the capture probes for microbead - based spoligotyping are identical to the ones from the membrane - based spoligotyping technique with minor modifications to correct some sequences from the original set [ 7,18 ] .
all capture oligonucleotides ( eurogentec , liege , belgium ) were modified at the 5 ' terminal amino group by a twelve carbon spacer linker to obtain the adequate free space between the microspheres and the oligonucleotides ( increase of gyration radius ) .
spoligotyping pcr protocol pcr ( 25 mul total ) was performed for 20 cycles for ctab dna [ 7 ] and 25 cycles for thermolyzates using 2 mul of tested dna .
hybridization was done in tmac buffer at 52degreesc for 10 minutes as described before by zhang et al .
[ 14 ] .
data analysis for each spacer , hybridization signals were recorded as rfi ( relative fluorescence intensity ) values and were transformed in a binary code ( presence / absence ) using a signal / noise cut - off value of 2 times the lower values' group .
octal codification and spoldb4 lineage identification were assigned to each spoligotype .
spoligotypes generated by the membrane technique were compared to the luminex generated spoligotypes , spoligotype by spoligotype and spacer by spacer .
the first comparison allowed determining perfect matches ( pm ) , i.e. obtaining exactly the same spoligotype by both methods ( identical results for 43 over 43 spacers ) .
the percentage of perfect matches in a center is calculated as the number of isolates with pm divided by the total number of isolates provided by the center .
the second comparison dealing with individual datapoints ( or spacers ) was represented by the rate of difference ( rd ) .
this rd index indicates the number of discordant data points for the total number of data points analyzed per center : e.g. if 8 of 100 dnas tested show discordant results in 2 spacers the rd value equals 8 * 2 * 100 /( 100 * 43 ) = 0.37 % .
we also investigated if some spacers were more prone to errors ( see additional file 1 ) .
problematic spacers were defined as spacers having exhibited at least one discrepancy in a center .
consecutive problematic spacers are referred to as " blocks " of problematic spacers .
mycobacterial isolates , dna extraction dna samples were provided by 11 centers that perform membrane - based spoligoyping as a routine procedure : i ) buenos aires - argentina ( servicio de micobacterias , instituto nacional de enfermedades infecciosas , anlis " carlos g. malbran " , buenos aires , argentina ) ; ii ) pisa - italy ( universita di pisa .
dipartimento di patologia sperimentale , biotecnologie mediche , infettivologia e epidemiologia ) and the regional reference center for mycobacteria , firenze ; iii ) bilthoven - the netherlands ( national institute for public health and the environment - rivm ) ; iv ) paris - france ( microbiology laboratory , hopital bichat - claude bernard , ap - hp ) ; v ) madrid - spain ( servicio de microbiologia clinica y enfermedades infecciosas , hospital general universitario gregorio maranon ) ; vi ) pointe - a - pitre - guadeloupe ( tb and mycobacteria research unit , institut pasteur de guadeloupe ) ; vii ) antananarivo - madagascar ( tb reference laboratory , institut pasteur de madagascar ) ; viii ) riyadh - saudi arabia ( tb research unit , comparative medicine , king faisal specialist hospital and research center ) ; ix ) rio de janeiro , oswaldo cruz institute laboratory of molecular biology applied to mycobacteria , brazil ; x ) antwerp - belgium , mycobacteriology unit , prince leopold institute of tropical medicine , and xi ) brussels - belgium , scientific institute of public health , national reference centre of tuberculosis and mycobacteria .
these selected strains have a worldwide origin and represent a wide range of mtc genotypes .
dna was extracted using a thermolyzate or a cetyl - trimethyl - ammonium bromide ( ctab ) procedure .
dna samples fulfilled the following criterion : samples representative of hard to interpret spoligotypes and samples representative of the work flow , so we could evaluate the benefits of a new platform regarding the classical one on these samples .
most centers had performed spoligotyping using commercial membranes ( ocimum , hyderabad , india ) ( except for the laboratories in institut pasteur of guadeloupe , institut pasteur of madagascar , and the university of pisa ) .
samples were analyzed in a blind way which means that we did not know the profiles from the membrane - based spoligotyping until we had everything processed by the microbead spoligotyping .
we named the centers from 1 to 11 for convenience ranked according to their spoligotyping quality , so this numbering is not correlated with the order in which they are described by name to respect confidentiality .
the number of samples included in this study by center are as follows : 1 ( 49 samples ) , 2 ( 95 samples ) , 3 ( 98 samples ) , 4 ( 97 samples ) , 5 ( 87 samples ) , 6 ( 82 samples ) , 7 ( 120 samples ) , 8 ( 70 samples ) , 9 ( 59 samples ) , 10 ( 85 samples ) and 11 ( 85 samples ) .
statistical analysis homogeneity " mann - whitney " non - parametric u test was performed in an excel sheet and " spearman rank correlation " test ( with rho and p calculations ) was performed using the online tool at http :// www.u707.jussieu.fr / biostatgv .
df = degrees of freedom , relating the number of independent observations used to compute the statistical parameters .
results eight centers using commercial membranes and three using in - house made membranes were included in the study , totaling 927 isolates .
we performed the microbead - based spoligotyping on luminex on the same set of dna samples as a new standard , even though it is clear that only sequencing would provide full reference information on spacer sequences and genomic structure of the direct repeat locus , especially in case of doubtful hybridization results for some spacers [ 13,14,18 ] .
centers were ranked from 1 to 11 according to their performance .
the seven best centers reached over 90 % of perfect match ( pm = exactly the same spoligotype pattern over the 43 spacers ) , three centers obtained between 87 and 84 % concordance and one laboratory only 51 % ( figure 1 ) .
however , this specific center had a high level of errors at a single spacer , and when ignoring the errors at that spacer , it reached 88 % of pm ( data not shown ) .
figure 1 relative quality of the classical membrane - based spoligotyping by center .
one hundred percent ( 100 % performance ) quality is inferred when obtaining complete ( identical ) concordance , i.e. 43 / 43 spacers , with the high - throughput based spoligotyping for every isolate .
the centers were numbered according to their spoligotyping quality and these numbers are shown between parentheses .
dna extraction procedure is also mentioned for each center .
participating centers used either cetyl - trimethyl - ammonium - bromide ( ctab ) extracted or heat - shock extracted ( thermolyzates ) dna , depending on the type of studies they usually use the dna for : the ctab - based extraction method is preferred for molecular analyses demanding high purity ( e.g. is6110 - rflp for which ctab is mandatory ) , whereas thermolyzates are used in other cases due to its swiftness and ease of implementation .
surprisingly , the best performing center ( center 1 ) used only thermolyzate dna , and center 11 used only ctab dna ( figure 1 ) .
altogether , centers that used the thermolyzate dna extraction procedure performed as well as centers using the ctab procedure ( nctab = 3 , nthermolyzates = 6 ; mann whitney test : = u = 6 ; p = 0.374 ) .
each spoligotype is a string of 43 characters so that in total 39,861 data points were analyzed in this study .
our comparative results showed 157 ( 0.39 %) data point discrepancies .
we defined the rate of difference ( rd ) index as the number of mismatches divided by the total number of analyzed data points in each center ( see material and methods ) .
all centers except one exhibited a " rd " below 1 % ( figure 2 ) .
in addition , when ignoring the errors due to the recurrently problematic spacers in most centers , rd dropped to 0.38 % .
as expected , rd was correlated to the rank of centers ( spearman rank correlation test rho = 0.99 ; df = 9 ; p < 0.001 ) : centers having the highest numbers of erroneous spoligotype patterns also had the highest number of individual spacers errors .
still , specific centers had a relative low rd as expected from their pm : centers 6 and 9 exhibited slightly higher global quality ( as measured by the pm ) than centers 7 and 10 respectively ( figure 1 ) , however , they had a higher amount of individual discrepancies ( as measured by their rd , figure 2 ) .
this indicates that , in these centers , the mismatches were often belonging to the same spoligotype patterns .
no statistical difference in the pm relatively to the use of commercial or home - made membranes was observed ( nhome = 3 ; ncommercial = 8 ; mann whitney test : u = 10 ; p = 0.387 i.e. non significant ) .
figure 2 datapoints discrepancies per center .
datapoints consist in every spacer of each spoligotype pattern .
the percentage of differences among all datapoints is referred to as rd for rate of difference .
we also looked for potentially problematic spacers creating systematic mismatches in multiple centers .
spacers that were wrongly identified by the classical spoligotyping varied among centers ( figure 3 ) .
they occasionally were located adjacent one to another and part of the corresponding blocks were shared by two to three centers ( see circles , for instance for spacers 40 and 41 , in figure 3 ) .
however , most problematic spacers were not generally shared .
the spacer that most frequently introduced errors was spacer 39 ( figure 4 ) but it was not detected among 42 isolates in one specific center , likely due to a membrane production problem .
when ignoring these samples , spacers most prone to introducing errors were spacers 15 , 18 , 14 and 40 ; and to a lesser extent spacers 37 , 8 , 26 , 29 , 30 , 33 and 41 ( figure 4 ) .
figure 3 problematic spacers by center as derived from the comparison of spoligotypes generated by both methods .
blocks of adjacent problematic spacers are circled .
figure 4 number of datapoints genotyping errors per spacer .
discussion we show in this study that different centers performing membrane - based spoligotyping exhibit different inter laboratory reproducibility rates ranging from 51 to 100 % and most of them reaching more than 90 % of quality as represented by their pm. one center had a specific detection problem of spacer 39 .
ignoring the errors associated with this spacer , it reached a pm as high as the other centers .
the choice of the sample was initially meant to include problematic specimens as well as sample representative of the work flow , however a separate statistical analysis between the random work flow and hard - to - type samples was not feasible here ( low effective size ) , hence the discrepancies reported here are upper limits and could have been lower if only random selection had occurred .
the reasons why spoligotyping errors occur can be diverse .
first , dna quality associated to the extraction procedure could be critical .
in this study , however , the dna extraction procedure did not influence the performance of the membrane - based spoligotyping .
nevertheless , we have to keep in mind that we only tested ctab and thermolyzates and other extraction procedures were not tested .
some centers repeatedly introduced genotyping errors at multiple spacers in the same samples .
some samples may have been of inadequate quality for all spacers to be sufficiently amplified .
however , this occurred both for centers using ctab and thermolyzate dna , confirming that factors other than extraction procedure , such as the amount of extracted dna , inclusion of culture medium when preparing bacterial suspensions or possible culture contaminations , may have influenced pcr quality and hence modified the spoligotypes of some samples .
regarding artisanal process of membrane production , an adequate quantity of specific probe concentrations on the membrane could sometimes be defective which would lead to the same spacer being recurrently problematic in the same center .
also , commercial membranes might experience some spacer problems so internal quality control must be done by each lab .
indeed , we have observed that in center 11 , spacer 39 was affecting the results of 42 strains .
however , in other centers , such problems were not observed .
we advise positive and negative controls to be included at randomly chosen positions to detect such possible membrane production problems ; centers producing their own membranes should also check their production adequately before use .
third , operator - dependent washing problems could occur on any part of the membrane so that any spacer could be wrongly scored for some isolates .
insufficient washing can lead to false positive detection of a spacer .
as an example , spacers 14 or 37 were detected , although they proved to be absent .
in contrast , excessive washing will level the signals of several probes down .
all centers used their membranes between 8 to 14 times which is under the limit advised by membranes' manufacturer ( up to 20 times ) .
however , this might still be too high .
we advise users to always record the results with positive and negative controls included at randomly chosen positions to detect the membrane fall down in quality , and possible insufficient washes .
fourth , there can be intrinsic problem due to the crispr structure in mtc : some spacers constantly provide weaker signals that make the distinction between positive and negative values more difficult .
for instance , dvr next to spacer 15 ( dvr26 ) harbors a deletion of 4 nucleotides at its 5 ' end as shown in highly diverse strains [ 18 ] .
consequently , pcr primers do not hybridize properly around spacer 15 which likely leads to a lower amplification level of this spacer .
the high - throughput spoligotyping method has the advantage of being more sensitive to detect these slight variations , given the 3d nature of the immobilized probes , which provides more surface to attach more pcr products .
moreover , unspecific hybridization is removed more easily with the microbead technology , making the detection of spacer 15 possible in any sample .
contrarily , in our study , spacer 40 was detected several times by membrane - based spoligotyping , but not by the microbead - based technique ( false positive on membrane ) .
fifth , the hybridization reading from the film , and the transfer of this information to a digital format have to be handled manually in the membrane - based spoligotyping increasing the transcription error risk ; the best procedure to reduce this risk is to have the results read in duplicate by two independent readers , to check reading mistakes and to solve potential discrepancies .
reading errors are suppressed in the high - throughput method due to an in - house designed automatized routine , which already provides a digital file with a suggested and objective interpretation according to predefined thresholds ( cut - off ) .
as the distribution of wrongly typed spacers is random ( see additional file 1 ) , low quality reading and transfer of results may be the major problem in the classical spoligotyping .
this can be particularly misleading when errors concern spacers that are used to classify strains into genotype level .
for instance , spacer 18 has been proposed to be highly informative to identify the mtc " x " clade strains , and spacer 40 to define the t2 subclade [ 8,20 ] .
conclusions crispr region genotyping in mtc , referred to as spoligotyping , revealed very useful for first line screening of epidemiological analyses and remains a robust and widely accepted genotyping method [ 21,15 ] .
since the technical improvement of microbead - based versus membrane - based spoligotyping method was previously demonstrated in two independent settings , we took microbead - based method as a new standard to study retrospectively the quality of membrane - based spoligotyping results in 11 centers [ 13,14 ] .
however , sequencing will remain the unique reference method for crispr genomic structure in case of doubts .
the performance of the membrane - based spoligotyping was shown not to be influenced by the dna extraction procedure .
overall , a relative good performance was obtained in most centers .
even if globally reliable , we report here that membrane - based spoligotyping suffers some practical limitations which are overcome when switching to the microbead - based format .
this format remains more expensive even though the higher reagents cost is partly balanced by decreased add - ons ( high - throughput ) and interpretation time .
a single center out of eleven had a systematic problem of membrane quality that was overlooked ( non reactivity of spacer 39 ) .
this issue was due to a problem in membrane production .
other centers yielded errors slightly more frequently at spacer 15 , that is known to be less amplified because of its neighboring modified crispr sequence around this spacer .
in contrast , the increased sensitivity of the high - throughput method was validated by the proper detection of this spacer [ 13,14 ] .
other genotyping errors by classical membrane - based spoligotyping most likely are due to variation in interpretation of weaker spots and / or transferring of data from the film to a digital file processes .
the high - throughput microbead - based method was shown to have a better sensitivity due to proper detection of some spacers that can be misinterpreted by the classical method , and a lower error rate due to automated interpretation and transcription .
a new 68 spacers microbead - based spoligotyping format provides an increase in discriminatory power for principal genetic group i clinical isolates , a feature that could be especially useful in south - east asia where the east - african indian ( eai ) clade predominates [ 14 ] .
the launch of a new luminex device ( magpix ) , with a price drop , yet lower - plex , molecular diagnostics instrument ( 50plex ) that would be interesting for fields labs ( e.g. without requirement of air conditioning ) could facilitate the spreading of spoligotyping ; however this will only happen if routine utilization ( through a concomitant drop in reagents prices ) is done within acceptable cost limits for public health and an improved quality of service .

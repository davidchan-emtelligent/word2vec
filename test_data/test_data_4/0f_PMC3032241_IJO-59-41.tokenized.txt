aim : corneal blindness accounts for 3.42 % of blindness in malaysia ; the rate of eye donation is low .
the aim of the study was to assess the awareness about eye donation and willingness to donate eyes among attendants of patients at various clinics in melaka , malaysia .
materials and methods : this observational study was conducted on attendants who accompanied patients ( n = 400 ) visiting various outpatient departments of the general hospital and two peripheral clinics in melaka between august and october 2007 .
the participants answered a questionnaire ( malay and english versions ) which included demographic profile , awareness of eye donation , knowledge regarding facts of eye donation , and willingness to donate eyes .
univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed at 5 % level of significance .
results : awareness of eye donation was observed in 276 ( 69 %) participants .
multivariate analysis showed that awareness was more among females when compared to males ( p = 0.009 ). of the 276 participants who were aware of eye donation , only 34.42 % were willing to donate eyes .
willingness was more among the indian race ( p = 0.02 ) and males ( p = 0.02 ) .
educational status did not influence the willingness to donate eyes .
conclusions : although majority of participants were aware of eye donation , willingness to donate eyes was poor .
awareness eye donation willingness malaysia corneal blindness accounts for about 6 - 8 millions of blind persons in the world. [ 1 ] in malaysia , it accounts for 3.42 % of all blindness. [ 2 ] corneal transplantation offers the potential for sight restoration ; however , it is hugely dependant on voluntary eye donation by suitable donors. [ 1 ] a review of the literature using pubmed revealed awareness studies among nonmedical faculties , and university students in malaysia , but not among the general population. [ 34 ] the aim of the study was to assess the awareness of eye donation and willingness to donate eyes among the attendants of patients at various clinics in melaka , malaysia .
materials and methods the study was conducted among the attendants of patients ( relatives or friends ) visiting outpatient departments of the general hospital and two peripheral clinics in melaka , malaysia .
the study period was from august 2007 to october 2007 .
anticipating a prevalence of 80 % awareness , 4 % absolute precision , and 95 % confidence level , the minimum sample size required was 384. [ 5 ] data collection the population of melaka state is about 455,300. [ 6 ] the general hospital in melaka caters to a population of about 500,000 including patients from neighboring states , with a rough total of 1000 outpatients per day in all the outpatient departments .
the two peripheral clinics see roughly about 300 outpatients per day .
based on the sample size calculation , a total of 400 participants were recruited by a convenient sampling method .
the attendants waiting outside various outpatient departments of the above - mentioned hospital and clinics , other than department of ophthalmology , were included in the study .
after written informed consent , the participants were asked to answer a questionnaire either in english or malay .
the malay questionnaire was verified by translating it back to english to ensure that there was no difference between the malay and the english version .
the questionnaire ( appendix ) included questions pertaining to demographic profile , awareness about eye donation and willingness to donate eyes .
" awareness " was considered as having a realization about the fact that a dead individual 's eyes can be utilized to give vision to those blind from corneal disease .
" knowledge " was considered as having understanding regarding the details of different aspects of eye donation like pledging of eyes , who can donate eyes , when can eyes be donated , and what steps are to be taken after death to donate one 's eyes .
literate subjects self - administered the questionnaire ; the chief author read out the questionnaire to the participants with no formal education .
those subjects not willing to participate in the study were excluded ( n = 30 ) .
the occupation of the participants was categorized as paramedical and nonmedical , with an understanding that individuals in paramedical occupations are likely to have a better awareness compared to nonmedical personnel .
paramedical occupation included nurses , ward boys , and helpers working in various hospitals , while nonmedical profession included all other occupations not related to the medical field .
data were entered and analyzed using the " statistical package for social sciences " ( spss ) version 15.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to find the variables associated with awareness and willingness .
statistical significance was determined at 5 % .
results malaysia being a multiracial country , a total of 400 subjects of malay , chinese , and indian races participated in the study .
the mean age of participants was 37.93 years ( standard deviation [ sd ] 15.1 years ) with a range of 18 - 75 years .
a slight female preponderance of 55.7 % was seen .
the ethnic distribution was 269 ( 67.3 %) malays , 77 ( 19.3 %) chinese , and 54 ( 13.5 %) indians .
fifty - three subjects ( 13.2 %) had either no formal education or primary education only , 245 ( 61.3 %) had secondary education , and 102 ( 25.5 %) were graduates or postgraduates .
the awareness of eye donation was found to be 69 % ( n = 276 ) .
univariate analysis [ table 1 ] showed that individuals with a higher education level ( graduate and above ) , the younger age group ( 18 - 45 years ) , individuals of paramedical occupation , and females were more aware of eye donation ( p < 0.05 ) .
however , on multivariate analysis [ table 2 ] , only the female gender was significantly associated with the awareness of eye donation ( p = 0.009 ) .

univariate analysis showed that indian race and males were more in favor of donating eyes ( p < 0.05 ) [ table 3 ] .
multivariate analysis [ table 2 ] confirmed that gender and race are independent factors contributing to willingness to donate eyes .

no disfigurement of the face as a result of eye donation was documented by 76.2 % of participants .
anonymity about the donor and recipient was known to 74.5 % of participants .
the most important source of awareness was the media ( 55.4 %) with newspapers topping the list ( 36.7 %) .
the fact that the next of the kin had the right to give consent was known to 55.6 % , but 36.2 % were not aware that the eyes could be preserved after retrieval .
the following were misconceptions : 90.3 % of the participants thought that eyes could not be retrieved at the house of the deceased , and 43.3 % felt that the whole eyeball was transplanted to the patient .
there was no statistically significant association between most questions ( appendix ) regarding the knowledge of eye donation and race ; however , 31 % of indians reported that eye donation was against their religion while the corresponding percentages reported by chinese and malays were only 12 % ( p = 0.011 ) .
discussion in the present study , 69 % of the participants were aware of eye donation ; the chinese population was less aware of eye donation compared to malays and indians .
in contrast , a study by yew et al. showed a better awareness ( 80.7 %) among singaporeans , and chinese were more aware of eye donation when compared to malays and other races. [ 5 ] the region - specific factors may influence the knowledge of eye donation in different parts of the world .
a study by priyadarshini et al. showed an awareness of 50.69 % among the patients attending two outreach clinics in southern india. [ 7 ] however , the awareness was only 30.7 % in the rural population of south india , compared to 73.8 % in the urban population of india. [ 89 ] a study by tandon et al. in delhi found that 55.4 % next of kin were aware of the concept of eye donation. [ 10 ] although 69 % of the participants had the awareness about eye donation , the willingness to donate eyes was seen in only 34.42 % .
this finding of better awareness than willingness to donate eyes is well observed in the study by yew et al. in singapore ( awareness 80.7 % and willingness 67 %).[ 5 ] also , the study by tandon showed that the prior knowledge of eye donation , literacy , and socioeconomic status had no influence on willingness for eye donation and major reasons for not donating eyes included refusal to discuss the issue and dissuasion by distant relatives , legal problems , and religious beliefs. [ 10 ] in our study , indians were more willing to donate eyes compared to malays and chinese , although our study showed that 31 % of the indians felt eye donation is against their religion while only 12 % of malays and chinese shared the same opinion .
many studies have shown that ethnicity has an important role in the willingness of organ donation. [ 11 - 13 ] probably , the reasons for the unwillingness could have been culture - specific issues arguing against donation including a sense of the sacredness of the body , belief that it is important to have an intact body after passing away and fear of illegal trade in organs and the poor would suffer. [ 51114 ] in the present study , 84.5 % were aware that eye donation is not against their religion and 76.2 % knew that it does not cause any disfigurement of the face .
in contrast , other studies have shown a concern among the respondents , like disfigurement of the face of the deceased , fear that it is against their religious belief , and may be time - consuming thus delaying the funeral process. [ 15 ] educational status showed a positive impact on the awareness of eye donation but did not show any statistically significant effect on the willingness to donate eyes .
however , yew et al. have found that the knowledge and willingness is more due to the higher educational status in singaporeans. [ 6 ] according to a study by shahbazian et al. , " age , sex , and occupation did not influence the attitudes ; however ethnicity , educational level , economic status , and having a loved one in need of an organ significantly increased the willingness for organ donation. "[ 12 ] in our study , although females were more aware of eye donation , similar to the observations by krishnaiah et al. , they were reluctant to donate eyes. [ 8 ] unwillingness among females may be because of their family ties and the necessity to seek permission from the family members before pledging their eyes .
hayward et al. have shown that women were more concerned about the transmission of diseases or of personality following organ donation. [ 16 ] the older age group was more willing to donate eyes compared to the younger age group again consistent with the indian study. [ 8 ] according to the national eye survey 1996 , corneal pathology accounts for 15.1 % of the childhood blindness in malaysia. [ 2 ] the majority of the donor corneas were imported from the usa ( n = 112 or 71 %) and sri lanka ( n = 27 or 17 %).[ 17 ] the eye donation among the local ethnic groups was a total of 19 , of whom 8 were chinese ( 42 %) , 6 indians ( 32 %) , and 4 were malays ( 21 %) in year 2005 and data was not available in one case. [ 17 ] in year 2004 , none of the malays had donated eyes and the new transplant rate was 7 per million populations in 2004. [ 17 ] this clearly indicates though there is a great demand of donor eyes , the donation in the community is very less .
studies show that there was poor awareness about the " fatwa " regarding organ donation , passed by the muslim law council in 1995. [ 1518 ] this lack of awareness has led to the fear of doing something against religion by donating organs among the population. [ 1518 ] thus , to make this dream of reducing the burden of avoidable corneal blindness , the ophthalmologists , general physicians , nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) , and especially the religious leaders have to work in unison to educate and motivate people to donate eyes .
limitations of the study the limitation of this study was that the study participants were attendants of patients in a hospital and peripheral clinics so the results of this study cannot be generalized to the malaysian population .
a population - based house - to - house survey would have been ideal .
although majority of participants were aware of eye donation , only one - third ( 34.42 %) of them were willing to donate their eyes .
the majority of malays were not willing to donate eyes although they agree that eye donation is not against their religion .
therefore , there is a great need to have awareness programs to motivate people to donate eyes to help mankind by giving sight to the needy .

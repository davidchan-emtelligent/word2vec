complex visuospatial processing relies on distributed neural networks involving occipital , parietal and frontal brain regions .
effects of physiological maturation ( during normal brain development ) and proficiency on tasks requiring complex visuospatial processing have not yet been studied extensively , as they are almost invariably interrelated .
we therefore aimed at dissociating the effects of age and performance on functional mri ( fmri ) activation in a complex visual search task .
in our cross - sectional study , healthy children and adolescents ( n = 43 , 19 females , 7 - 17 years ) performed a complex visual search task during fmri .
resulting activation was analysed with regard to the differential effects of age and performance .
our results are compatible with an increase in the neural network 's efficacy with age : within occipital and parietal cortex , the core regions of the visual exploration network , activation increased with age , and more so in the right than in the left hemisphere .
further , activation outside the visual search network decreased with age , mainly in left inferior frontal , middle temporal , and inferior parietal cortex .
high - performers had stronger activation in right superior parietal cortex , suggesting a more mature visual search network .
we could not see effects of age or performance in frontal cortex .
our results show that effects of physiological maturation and effects of performance , while usually intertwined , can be successfully disentangled and investigated using fmri in children and adolescents .

introduction visuospatial processing encompasses a multitude of functions with varying degrees of complexity , such as visual perception , visuospatial attention , object categorization , spatial transformation , occulomotor planning and execution , etc .
[ 1 ] .
given the broad range of subfunctions which are involved when processing complex visuospatial information , it is not surprising that widely - distributed brain networks are employed to manage these processes .
1.1 : visual search and visual exploration in the present experiment we studied complex visual search , i.e. , the wilful exploration of a complex visual stimulus in search for changing targets .
this task demands both basic and complex search processes .
the successful manipulation of complex visuospatial information is primarily dependent on occipito - temporo - parietal structures , which are commonly accepted to constitute the ventral and dorsal pathways of visual processing [ 1,2 ] .
1.1.1 : basic visual search classic visual search paradigms usually require the search for a predefined target in an array of distractors , where subjects perform overt or covert shifts of attention or gaze towards simple visual stimuli ( e.g. , 3 - 7 ) .
when shifting either attention or gaze , the frontal eye fields ( fef ) , situated within the posterior superior frontal gyrus ( sfg ) [ 8 ] are invariably activated [ 9,10 - 12 ] .
the top - down control of visuo - spatial attention [ 9,13 - 18 ] and the representation of spatial coordinates [ 19 ] on the other hand , have been associated with bilateral superior parietal lobule ( spl ) and intraparietal sulcus ( ips ) in fmri studies using a number of basic visual search tasks .
1.1.2 : complex visual search the conscious and planned shifting of attention focus is one of the functions most relevant for the more complex task of visual exploration [ 20,21 ] .
only few studies have examined visual search under natural conditions , i.e. , the free exploration of a complex visual scenery. with such a paradigm , himmelbach and colleagues [ 22 ] identified the posterior parietal cortex , ips , fef , the insula , the temporo - parietal junction , and stg / sts as areas involved in natural visual search .
complex visual search tasks may , in addition , involve prefrontal networks including superior frontal sulcus ( sfs ) or ventrolateral / dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
this involvement has been interpreted to reflect a visual working memory component [ 15,23 - 25 ]. from lesion studies , it is well known that visual exploration relies on a predominantly right - hemispheric and densely interconnected perisylvian network ( i.e. , superior / middle temporal , inferior parietal , and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex of the right hemisphere , including the corresponding fibre - tracts ) .
disruptions of this network lead to the core symptoms of spatial neglect ( i.e. , contra - lesionally biased gaze orientation and visual exploration [ 26 ]). with the clear preponderance of right - hemispheric lesions leading to spatial neglect , it is somewhat puzzling that studies with healthy participants rarely find a strong lateralization of the above - mentioned functions .
this may be related to task demand , since task complexity or increased processing demands were associated with a more bilateral activation pattern in complex visual search [ 27,28 ] and in mental rotation [ 29 ] .
the embedded figures task ( eft ) can be considered another example of a more complex visual search task .
here , subjects are asked to search a complex figure for a simple geometric shape .
the theoretical focus of the eft lies on the assumption that local details have to be " disembedded " from the global gestalt of the stimulus [ 30 ] .
similarly to basic and complex visual search tasks [ 9,13 - 18 ] , however , fmri studies with the eft highlight a bilateral parieto - occipital network comprising mainly spl and precuneus [ 31 ] .
1.2 : development of visuospatial functions it is well known that - like most cognitive abilities - performance in visuospatial tasks improves during childhood and adolescence , i.e. , as a function of normal brain maturation ( e.g. , visuospatial attention [ 32 ] ; visuospatial analysis [ 33 ] ; visuospatial memory [ 34 ]) .
however , the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not yet entirely clear .
1.2.1 : developmental changes in task - related fmri activation in the last decade , an increasing number of fmri studies have provided evidence for two trends : on the one hand , brain regions may become more functionally specialized with age ( for reviews , see 35,36 ) .
on the other hand , a " frontalization " of activation seems to reflect the ongoing maturation of the frontal cortex [ 37 ] .
functional specialization can be inferred from an increase in focus and ( in some cases ) in lateralization in older as compared to younger children [ 35,36 ] .
such a shift from diffuse to focal activation with increasing age is thought to be caused by the combination of an activation increase in task - critical areas and a decrease of activation in areas less relevant for the task [ 35 ] .
however , unspecific changes in vascular coupling or in data quality ( e.g. , movement artefacts ) may have to be taken into account when interpreting age - related localization of fmri activation [ 38 ] .
apart from maturation of the relevant neural networks , the variation in activation patterns between children and adults may also be determined by the cognitive strategies employed [ 35 ] .
for example , children often have more left - hemispheric activation than adults in fmri tasks on mental rotation , which has been explained by more piecemeal - like vs. holistic strategies employed by the two groups [ 39 ] .
in general , however , as children and adolescents mature , cognitive processing increasingly depends on top - down control : inhibitory control increases and the underlying networks become more efficient and focussed .
thus , task - relevant regions increase in activation , while task - irrelevant regions demonstrate an activation decrease the older the individual gets [ 40,41 ] .
in addition , the mostly prefrontally represented executive functions , responsible for efficacy and precision , become increasingly available .
this can be suspected to be an important explanatory factor for age - and performance related differences in fmri activation patterns observable during complex visuospatial tasks .
1.2.2 : effects of age and performance in visuospatial tasks the fronto - striato - parieto - temporal network involved in the allocation of visuospatial attention matures progressively with age [ 42 ] .
for complex visual search , increasing right - hemispheric lateralization with increasing age has been demonstrated by fmri during late childhood and adolescence [ 28 ] .
in the embedded figures test ( eft ) , the activation of typically developing adolescents did not differ from that of adults [ 43,44 ] , but children demonstrated more left - hemispheric prefrontal activation .
this was assumed to reflect verbal strategies and increased effort [ 45 ] .
data regarding visuospatial working memory is less clear .
while in fmri , an age - related shift from diffuse to focal activation within the core network has been observed [ 24,46 - 48 ] , there were no age - related changes in a study using functional transcranial doppler sonography [ 49 ] .
since performance gains are almost invariably related to normal development , it is both important and difficult to disentangle the two components in studies of age - effects on fmri activation .
the few studies making an attempt to meet this statistical challenge detected either no performance effects ( e.g. , 50 - 53 ) , or a performance - related activation - increase in task - related brain regions which was independent of age ( e.g. , 42,54 ). with this study , we planned to assess the effects of both physiological maturation and performance in healthy children and adolescents during a complex visual search task , i.e. , during the wilful exploration of a complex visual stimulus in search of a changing target .
based on the literature outlined above , we expect ( h1 ) an fmri activation increase within and an activation decrease outside the core visual attention network ( i.e. , right spl , ips , and fef ) with increasing age , reflecting a focussing of activation ; ( h2 ) an age - independent increase of lateralization with increasing performance within the same regions ; and ( h3 ) an increase of fmri activation with age and performance in prefrontal cortex .
materials and methods 2.1 : participants fourty - three neurologically healthy children and adolescents ( 24 male , 19 female ; mean age 12 years ; range 7 to 17 years ; native german speakers ) participated in this study .
according to the edinburgh handedness inventory [ 55 ] , 38 subjects were right - handed , 4 were left - handed , and 1 ambidextrous .
exclusion criteria were common mr - contraindications , prematurity and pre - existing neurological or psychiatric disorders .
data of three subjects was excluded due to technical problems in the recording of performance data , and one further subject ( 11 year old boy ) was excluded due to extremely low performance ( hit rate more than 2 standard deviations below the mean ) .
all included subjects completed the german adaptation of the wechsler intelligence scale for children ( hawik - iv ) to ensure a normal level of cognitive abilities ( mean full scale iq = 110.02 , sd = 8.02 ) .
2.1.1 : ethics statement the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the university of tubingen .
all participants and their parents gave written informed consent .
subjects were compensated for their participation according to the time they spent on the study .
2.2 : complex visual search task the task is described in detail in [ 56 ] .
in summary , subjects were presented pairs of abstract images derived from the rey complex figure [ 57 ] .
in the search condition , 50 % of the pairs were identical , while in the other trials a detail was missing in one of the figures ( figure 1 , left ) .
in the control condition , both figures were identical in all cases , but in 50 % one of the figures was rotated ( figure 1 , right ) .
stimuli were presented for 6 seconds each .
six control blocks alternated with 5 search blocks ( each containing 5 stimuli ) , leading to a total task duration of 5:30 min .
the task was practiced outside the scanner , and subjects were reminded of the task instructions directly before the start of the scan by a short video .
the beginning of each new block was indicated by the short presentation of a blank green screen .
participants were told to press a button whenever the two figures were not the same , i.e. , when a detail was missing ( search condition ) or when the orientations were different ( control condition ) .
they were explicitly told that the search condition was more difficult than the control condition and that they were to keep searching until they either had found a target ( i.e. , a difference between the figures ) , or until the next stimulus was presented .
we assumed that the search condition differentially engages visuospatial working memory ( keeping the " correct " pattern online ) , top - down guided visual attention shifts ( systematically searching the patterns ) , saccades ( between the two versions and within the searched pattern ) , pattern recognition ( comparing the details of the searched pattern ) , and inhibition ( e.g. , of already searched parts of the pattern ) .
hits and misses during target trials as well as mean reaction time for hits were recorded .
for further analyses , we defined hit rate as measure of performance and applied a z - transformation , leading to positive z - scores for relatively higher hit rates and to negative z - scores for relatively lower hit rates .

2.3 : data acquisition and processing data was acquired on a 1.5 - t whole body mr scanner ( avanto , siemens medizintechnik , erlangen , germany ) , using a 12 - channel head coil .
care was taken to ensure comfortable placement of the participants , and a foam cushion was used to minimize head movement .
visual stimulus delivery was achieved by screen projection , using a custom - made mr compatible setup as used before [ 27 ] .
a single mr - compatible pushbutton ( current design inc .
philadelphia , pa , usa ) held in the left hand ( by all subjects ) was used for performance monitoring .
for stimulus presentation and recording of button presses we used the presentation software package ( version 14.8 , neurobehavioral systems , inc. , albany , ca ) .
a t2 - weighted echo - planar imaging ( epi ) sequence was used to acquire functional images with the following parameters : repetition time ( tr ) = 3000 ms , echo time ( te ) = 40 ms , matrix = 64 x 64 , 40 slices , no interslice gap , covering the whole brain with a voxel size = 3 x 3 x 3 mm. for each task , 110 volumes were acquired .
additionally , a gradient - echo b0 fieldmap was acquired with tr = 546 ms , te = 5.19 / 9.95 ms , with the same slice prescription as the functional series .
for preprocessing purposes , we also acquired a t1 - weighted 3d - data set with tr = 1300ms , te = 2.92 ms , yielding 176 contiguous slices with an in - plane matrix of 256 x 256 , resulting in a voxel size of 1 x 1 x 1 mm. data was processed using spm8 software ( wellcome trust centre for neuroimaging , london , uk ) , running in matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa ) .
the first 10 scans of each functional series ( corresponding to the first block of the control condition ) were rejected to allow for the stabilization of longitudinal magnetization , leaving 100 scans per series ( 5 blocks each of the active and the control condition ) to be analyzed .
functional images were realigned and unwarped using the individually - acquired b0 fieldmap , correcting for both epi and motion * b0 distortions [ 58 ] .
functional series with translation exceeding one voxel size ( 3 mm ) in any direction were discarded .
the anatomical dataset was segmented using unified segmentation [ 59 ] , based on custom - generated paediatric reference data [ 60 ] .
following coregistration of functional and anatomical data , these parameters were used to normalize the functional images .
global signal trends were removed [ 61 ] and functional images were smoothed with a 9 mm full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) gaussian filter .
2.4 : statistical analyses functional mri data was analysed on the first level in the framework of the general linear model ( glm ) [ 62 ] , contrasting the search condition with the control condition , including individual motion parameters as nuisance variables [ 63 ] .
to test our hypotheses , we took a hierarchical approach .
first , we determined the global task - related network by assessing the main effect of a whole - brain one - sample t - test ( second level analysis ) , treating hit rate and age as covariates of no interest .
gender did not demonstrate any effects on performance ( see results ) , so this variable was left out of the analysis .
statistical significance was assumed at an fwe - corrected p < . 05 and an extent - threshold of k = 20 .
the first two hypotheses ( h1 and h2 ) were then addressed by exploring the effects of age and performance within and outside this global task - related network .
to this effect , we created a region of interest ( roi ) from the global activation cluster of the main effect ( thresholded at fwe - corrected p <. 05 ; this roi will be referred to as globalfwe ) .
globalfwe was used once as an inclusive and once as an exclusive mask for analyses of covariance ( ancova ) , with age and performance as covariates of interest .
since age and hit rates were correlated ( see results ) , we orthogonalized the covariates onto each other for these analyses .
for the roi analyses , significance was assumed at p < . 001 ( uncorrected ) and an extent cluster of k = 15 .
lateralization was assessed using the li - toolbox [ 64 ] , based on mean individual activation levels within and outside globalfwe .
in order to exclude a bias due to different search volumes in the two hemispheres , a symmetrical version of globalfwe was used , by combining the original roi with its flipped version .
to avoid the threshold dependency of simple lateralization indices , a bootstrapping approach was employed .
this approach analyzes a multitude of bootstrapped resamples from the original dataset at different thresholds and determines a weighted mean li [ 65 ] .
positive lis represent predominantly left - hemispheric activation , negative lis represent a right - hemispheric preponderance [ 64 ] .
in a third step , we explored the specific effects of age and performance within the frontal lobes ( addressing h3 ) .
to this effect , we conducted an ancova with age and performance ( orthogonalized ) as covariates of interest in an anatomically defined roi ( frontal cortex and insula plus prefrontal portions of cingulate and corpus callosum , according to the hammersmith atlas [ 66 ]) .
again , significance was assumed at p < 0.001 ( uncorrected ) and an extent cluster of k = 15 .
results 3.1 : behavioural data hit rate ( hr ) of all participants was moderate during the search condition ( mean 47 % correct , sd = 15 , range 25 % - 83 %) , mean hit reaction time ( rt ) was 3133 ms ( sd = 744 ) .
as expected , the control condition was much easier to solve ( mean 93 % correct , sd = 23 , range 45 % - 100 % ; mean hit rt : 1483 ms [ sd = 753 ]) .
age was correlated significantly with hit rate ( r ( 36 ) = . 434 , p = . 003 ) , but not with rt ( r ( 36 ) = . 059 , p = . 361 ) in the search condition .
gender did not significantly influence performance in the search condition ( rt : meanmales = 3162 ms [ sd = 821 ] , meanfemales = 3095 ms [ sd = 654 ] , t ( 37 ) = - . 276 , p = . 784 ; hr : meanmales = 47.45 % [ sd = 15.70 ] , meanfemales = 46.76 % [ sd = 13.56 ] , t ( 37 ) = - . 144 , p = . 886 ; two - sample t - tests ) .
3.2 : global effects all functional time - series with complete performance data were kept for analysis as none of the subjects displayed motion exceeding 3 mm in any direction .
on the group level , the search vs. control contrast revealed significant bilateral activation which included occipital cortex as well as inferior temporal gyri and bilateral , but right lateralized superior parietal cortex .
in addition , a large cluster in the right and a smaller cluster in the left premotor cortex ( middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus ) were significantly more active in the search than in the control condition ( figure 2 ) .

3.3 : age effects the roi analysis revealed age effects within and outside globalfwe ( figure 3 , table 1 ) .
inside the roi , age correlated positively with activation in both lateral occipital lobes and at trend - level in right superior parietal lobe .
outside the roi , a marginal positive effect of age was detected in both occipital lobes , extending the clusters within globalfwe .
within globalfwe , no significant negative correlations with age were detected .
however , outside the roi , we detected a significant negative effect of age in left inferior parietal lobe , left middle temporal gyrus , and left inferior frontal gyrus .

discussion studying the effects of age and performance on fmri activation during a complex visual search task , our main finding was an increase of activation with age in bilateral occipital cortex and right superior parietal lobule .
thus , the older were our study participants , the stronger was their bold response during the visual search task within core regions of the network for complex visual search .
in addition , activation decreased with age in a left - hemispheric network of inferior frontal , middle temporal , and superior parietal cortex .
thus , the younger our participants , the more did they recruit left - hemispheric brain regions outside the core network for complex visual search .
this corroborates our hypothesis ( h1 ) .
hypothesis ( h2 ) , which predicted a performance - related increase of lateralization within the same regions , received only little support : age and performance were correlated only in the right superior parietal lobule in the roi analyses .
however , the correlations of lateralization index with age or performance within the whole network did not reach significance .
hypothesis ( h3 ) could not be corroborated , since we did not find effects of age or performance within the prefrontal cortex .
4.1 : fmri activation during complex visual search the comparison of a complex visual search task with a very simple pattern - matching task highlights a broad network of predominantly posterior brain regions .
considering the various processes involved in performing complex visual search , involvement of a range of brain regions was expected .
the overall group activation pattern included large portions of both the superior and the inferior parietal lobe .
this is well in line with the task requirements : first of all , subjects needed to shift their visual attention ( ideally systematically ) from focus to focus in the images , and thus should engage their superior parietal lobe , intraparietal sulcus , frontal eye fields [ 67 ] , and the medial superior frontal sulcus [ 68 ] .
these processes needed for complex visual search are also necessary to solve the embedded figures task ( eft ) .
the eft has been associated with left - lateralized activation in inferior and superior parietal lobules and ventral premotor cortex in fmri experiments [ 44 ] .
in our study , the activation pattern is bilateral and slightly right - lateralized .
since the widely - reported hemispheric dissociation for local vs. global visual processing ( e.g. , 69 ) seems to be on the one hand subtle in nature and on the other hand strongly dependent on the experimental conditions [ 70 ] , this is not surprising .
in natural life conditions , attention shifts are usually entailing saccades .
to keep the task as simple as possible , we allowed eye movements and thus expect saccades in our subjects , which are mediated predominantly by the frontal eye fields [ 8 ] .
while the activation we see in the middle frontal gyrus may seem too far lateral to reflect fef activity , it still seems well compatible with paus' regional range of +/ - 11 mm in left - right , +/ - 5 mm in anterior - posterior , and +/ - 5 mm in inferior - superior direction [ 8 ] .
4.2 : age effects the analysis of the effects of age on activation in the main visual search network reveals an age - related increase of activation in occipital and superior parietal cortices .
at the same time , activation outside the main visual search network , namely in left inferior parietal cortex , left middle temporal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex decreases with age .
our assumption that frontal regions " join task execution " successively during adolescence was not corroborated , since we did not find any age effects in the prefrontal roi .
thus , our data did not provide evidence for the frontalization - with - age hypothesis as seen in other tasks which rely more heavily on executive functions [ 37 ] .
the reverse effects of age on activation within and outside the network for complex visual search , however , indicate that older subjects more exclusively recruit its core components while younger children involved additional brain regions to solve the task .
we propose that the younger children used verbal strategies ( as likely reflected by left inferior frontal cortex activation ) , which is in line with previous findings for the eft [ 45 ] .
the left inferior parietal cortex activation in younger vs. older subjects is similar to the effect observed in mental rotation tasks [ 39 ] .
in these tasks , children are assumed to employ piecemeal - like vs. holistic processing strategies to solve the task [ 39 ] .
given the complexity of the search task we used , the same could apply for our paradigm .
while the lateralization indices do not correlate significantly with age in the rois explored , an effect of age is observed only in the right superior parietal lobule .
this observation would again be in line with a growing efficacy of brain networks with age [ 35 ] , in our case the predominantly right - hemispheric posterior visual processing network .
two alternative explanations for the result of a more wide - spread activation in the younger children could be that 1 ) the normalization process was more accurate for older children , and 2 ) younger children displayed more motion than older children .
however , both explanations seem very unlikely given 1 ) our use of a custom - made age - adjusted template [ 60 ] , and 2 ) the introduction of specific movement parameters into the individual single - subject statistics on the first level [ 63 ]."
4.3 : performance effects as children and adolescents grow older , they get more proficient in many complex visual processing tasks .
thus , it is difficult to disentangle the effect of performance on brain activation from the effect of age .
including age as covariate into the analyses regarding performance and vice versa is an attempt to take this problem into consideration .
while not a perfect solution and likely being too conservative due to removing shared variance from either analysis , it seems a defensible approach .
within the visual search network , performance impacts activation in the right superior parietal lobule - the same region that shows an increased activation with increasing age .
thus , one could assume that better performance is correlated with a more mature network in complex visual search .
on the other hand , we found that subjects with low hit rates engaged more regions outside the visual exploration network , such as left precentral gyrus and in the vicinity of the posterior cingulate .
it is difficult to interpret this activation pattern .
the most probable explanation here is one of response inhibition which could be reflected in an increased contralateral motor - activation ( since the subjects responded with their left hands ) and error detection .
given the effects of normalization and smoothing , the exact localization of group activation peaks is difficult to accomplish [ 71 ] .
based on the literature , we tentatively propose that our posterior activation cluster could reflect posterior cingulate cortex activation which has been correlated with unsuccessful trials in cognitive control tasks [ 72 ] .
one reason for the very small effects of performance on the activation pattern might be the way of performance operationalization .
it should be mentioned that " successful target trial " was defined as a button press in response to a target trial .
since all trials were presented for a fixed duration of six seconds , misses were composed of those trials where no target was detected within this specified time ( but could have been detected during a longer time interval ). of note , a low hit rate in this context is not equivalent to guessing or lack of attention , but to lack of target detection during the time provided .
the very high hit rate during the control condition indicates a good overall task adherence , so that it can be assumed that subjects have principally attended to the tasks [ 27 ] .
hit rate is therefore a mixture of rapidity and quality of visual exploration and thus probably not the most sensitive measure .
in a self - paced design , these two components could have been disentangled , which might allow for a more comprehensive description of performance effects .
also , the inclusion of subjects with a wider range of cognitive abilities might have allowed us to detect these regions with a higher level of statistical reliability .
conclusion in a complex visual search task we found evidence for an age - related shift from diffuse to focal activation of a predominantly right - hemispheric visuospatial occipito - parietal network .
this means that younger age was associated with a more widespread and more bilateral activation pattern , probably reflecting alternative , presumably verbal and / or piecemeal - like vs. holistic strategies for task performance .
better performance correlated with increased activation of right superior parietal lobule , thus presumably reflecting a more mature network in high - performers .
no specific effects of age or performance were detected in prefrontal cortex .
we believe our results are encouraging with respect to the feasibility to disentangle age and performance during physiological maturation , using fmri .

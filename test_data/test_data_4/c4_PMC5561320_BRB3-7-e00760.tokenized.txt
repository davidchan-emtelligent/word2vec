abstract introduction a - waves , which are observed following the m - wave during motor nerve conduction studies ( ncs ) , are late responses that are frequently found in many types of neurogenic disorders .
however , a - waves are also common in healthy individuals , where their significance remains unclear .
the aim of this study was to examine whether the occurrence of a - waves does in fact represent an increased risk for the future development of changes upon ncs or needle electromyography ( emg ) in the corresponding nerve .
methods nerve conduction studies / needle electromyography findings at control examination were evaluated in relation to the occurrence of initial a - waves in 327 individuals who had undergone repeated ncs / emg examination and exhibited normal initial findings , with or without the occurrence of a - waves as the only acceptable abnormality .
results the odds ratio , which reflects the predictive power of the occurrence of a - waves at the initial testing for the development of an abnormality ( neuropathy or radiculopathy ) at the follow - up examination , ranged from 2.7 ( p = . 041 ) in the tibial nerve and 3.9 ( p = . 034 ) in peroneal one , to 30.0 ( p = . 002 ) in the ulnar nerve .
conclusions a - waves constitute an initial abnormality in all nerves , and they may be predictive for the future development of broader ncs / emg abnormalities in the corresponding nerve .

2017 ; 7 : e00760 https :// doi.org / 10.1002 / brb3.760 1 introduction a - wave is a common late response , i.e. , a response that can be identified following the compound muscle action potential ( cmap , m - wave ) during routine motor nerve conduction studies ( ncs ) ( bischoff , 2002 ) .
in general , several types of late responses can be differentiated based on their latency , amplitude , stability , the stimulus intensity necessary to elicit the response , the consistency of the occurrence and the possibility to block them using double stimulation ( bischoff , 2002 ) .
some of these late responses are physiological ( h - reflex and f - waves ) , whereas others are usually considered to be a sign of some underlying pathology ( a - waves ) .
a - waves are characterized by a constant shape and latency upon repeated stimulation ( the variation of their onset latency is usually less than 1.5 ms ) and , in most cases , a low amplitude ( figure 1 ) .
the number of a - waves increases with an increasing stimulus intensity , whereas the latency does not change .
they are frequently found in many neurogenic disorders , including demyelinating neuropathies , axonal neuropathies , focal mononeuropathies , radiculopathies , and motor neuron diseases ( andersen , stalberg , & falck , 1997 ; bischoff , stalberg , falck , & puksa , 1996 ; kornhuber , bischoff , mentrup , & conrad , 1999 ; puksa , stalberg , & falck , 2003 ; rowin & meriggioli , 2000 ) but they are also common in healthy individuals , mainly in the lower extremities ( bischoff et al. , 1996 ; puksa et al. , 2003 ; rowin & meriggioli , 2000 ) .
in the study published by puksa et al .
( 2003 ) , a - waves were found in 25 % of the tibial nerves studied and in 14 % of the peroneal nerves in a group of otherwise healthy subjects ( puksa et al. , 2003 ) .
the frequency of a - waves in their study increased with age .
therefore , the authors hypothesize that a - waves may be related to normal age - related mild neuropathic changes of alpha motor neurons ( puksa et al. , 2003 ) .
a - waves thus seem to represent an initial peripheral nerve abnormality .
it is , however unclear , if their presence increases the risk of development of more pronounced neuropathy in future , which - - according to our knowledge - - has not been studied yet .
figure 1 a - waves ( marked by black arrow ) occurring between m - wave and f - wave in peroneal nerve in a healthy volunteer .
constant shape with minimal variability of the onset latency can be seen the aim of this study was to examine whether the occurrence of supramaximally stimulated a - waves , which were recorded as the only abnormality in routine f - wave studies , might predict an increased probability for the development of other electrophysiological abnormalities in the respective nerve .
2 methods 2.1 patients the occurrence of a - waves was studied retrospectively in the records of emg / nsc examinations from patients / healthy controls performed in the electrophysiological laboratory of university hospital brno ( which represents the biggest neuromuscular center in the czech republic ) .
the use of these data for this study was approved by the institutional ethics committee .
initially , one examinator ( is ) went through all the records from the period between 2006 and 2015 , and selected the patients / controls , complying with following inclusion criteria : ( i ) normal initial ncs and needle emg , with or without the occurrence of a - waves as the only acceptable abnormality , and ( ii ) re - examination of the same peripheral nerve within 12 - 60 months .
in the next step , clinical records of all the selected patients / controls were checked and individuals suitable for further analysis were selected based on the following exclusion criteria : ( i ) known risk factors for peripheral neuropathy ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , chronic alcohol abuse , uremia , and thyroid dysfunction ) and ( ii ) acute sensory symptoms ( with the duration of few days , possibly related to acute neuropathies , e.g. , guillain - barre syndrome - - only two patients otherwise complying with the inclusion criteria , were excluded for this reason ) .
the majority of the individuals ( 102 ) were healthy volunteers who were examined for the purposes of several other studies .
in addition , patients with no objective signs of peripheral neuropathy but with various other types of complaints ( mainly subacute or chronic sensory symptoms in the upper or lower extremities [ 91 ] , unexplained fatigue [ 47 ] and / or pain radiating from the cervical / lumbar spinal cord to the upper / lower extremities [ 87 ]) who had undergone re - evaluation for the same or different reasons were included in the analysis .
all these individuals ( as well as the healthy volunteers ) showed normal clinical neurological examination ( including the evaluation of muscle strength using the mrc scale , the examination of deep tendon reflexes and sensitivity to touch , pinprick , vibration , and statesthesia and kinesthesia ) .
the only acceptable deviation from the fully normal clinical status was the decrease ( but not the absence ) of achilles tendon reflex , which was found in about one - third of all the individuals included ( table 3 and 4 ) .
using the above - mentioned inclusion / exclusion criteria , a total of 815 motor nerves ( median , ulnar , peroneal , and tibial ) from 327 individuals ( 131 males and 194 females ; mean age 50.3 +/ - 10.7 years ) were further investigated for the presence of a - waves and development of abnormities at control examination ( table 1 and 2 ) , with a mean interval between examinations of 26.6 +/ - 14.2 months .

john wiley & sons , ltd 2.2 electrophysiological examination electrophysiological examinations were performed using a keypoint dantec type ii or iv electromyography system ( dantec , skovlunde , denmark ) .
routine motor nerve conduction studies of the median , ulnar , peroneal , and tibial nerves , including 20 consecutive f - waves and needle emg from related muscles , were performed using standard protocols , and were processed relative to our own reference values , which are based on age and height ( kadanka , bednarik , & vohanka , 1994 ) and are similar to the reference values published by kimura ( kimura , 2013 ) .
we used standard silver / silver chloride surface electrodes ( 10 mm in diameter ) , with the active electrode placed on the belly of the muscle and the reference electrode positioned on a muscle tendon .
electrical stimulation was performed at the distal stimulation site ( 80 or 100 mm proximal to the active electrode in the upper or lower extremities ) using repetitive stimulation at a frequency of 1 hz , a duration of 0.2 ms ( for each stimuli ) and a supramaximal intensity of 10 % - 15 % above the level needed to elicit a maximal m - response .
patients remained fully relaxed during the examination .
late responses were recorded in each motor nerve when stimulated at the wrist ( median or ulnar ) or the ankle ( peroneal or tibial ) .
the presence of a - waves at initial examination was evaluated from the ncs records by single observed ( ev ) experienced in clinical neurophysiology and blinded to the findings at follow - up and patients / controls clinical status .
a - waves were considered present if they fulfilled the following criteria : constant shape and latency ( with a chronodispersion under 0.5 ms ) and present in at least 40 % of the recorded responses .
similar to previous studies ( bischoff et al. , 1996 ; puksa et al. , 2003 ) , a - waves were considered to be a group of late responses that were different from f - waves and the h - reflex and were not further classified based on their pathophysiological mechanisms .
in addition , compound muscle action potentials ( cmaps ) , motor nerve conduction velocities ( ncvs ) , distal motor latencies ( dml ) , minimum f - wave latencies and needle emg findings in related muscles were also noted at both the initial and follow - up examination using previously described methods ( kadanka et al. , 1994 ) .
these parameters and their intertrial change were analyzed statistically to establish a possible relationship with the presence of a - waves .
2.3 statistical methodology standard descriptive statistics were applied in the analysis , which included the median , and the min - max range for continuous variables and the absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables .
the statistical significance of differences between the groups of patients was assessed using a nonparametric mann - whitney u test and the kruskal - wallis test for continuous variables .
chi - squared test and fisher 's exact test were applied to categorical variables .
the predictive power of the occurrence of a - waves at first examination with the development of an abnormality at second examination was quantified using the odds ratio ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval .
estimates of or were performed using logistic regression models .
the analysis was performed using spss 22.0.0.1 software ( ibm corporation , 2014 ) .
3 results initially , the data from healthy controls and patients with no objective signs of peripheral neuropathy but with various other types of complaints were compared .
the initial values of all the evaluated ncs parameters ( amplitudes , conduction velocities , and f - wave latencies ) , clinical findings as well as the occurrence of a - waves did not shown any significant difference between these two sugroups ( table 3 and 4 ) .
for further analysis , all the individuals were thus considered as one group .

john wiley & sons , ltd a summary of the results processed in relation to the a - waves presence is presented in tables 1 , 2 .
at the initial examination , a - waves were rare in the upper extremities , occurring in only 2.1 % of all assessed ulnar and median nerves .
in contrast , a - waves were found significantly more frequently in the lower extremities , particularly in the tibial nerve ( 31.3 %) but less frequently in the peroneal nerve ( 9.9 %) .
at the follow - up examination 12 - 60 months later , the most frequent abnormality that developed in the upper extremities was mild ( 22 patients ) to moderate ( 4 cases ) carpal tunnel syndrome ( cts , documented by the decrease in sensory and / or motor median ncvs in the transcarpal segment of the nerve and by the increase in distal sensory and / or motor latencies ) , followed by ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow ( 2 cases ) and guyon 's canal ( 1 patient ) ( confirmed by decrease in motor ncvs across the elbow or guyon 's canal together with the increase of ulnar dml in the latter case , and by the decrease of the amplitudes in the ulnar cmap and chronic axonal changes of motor unit potencials in needle emg from ulnar muscles ) .
less frequently , axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy ( documented by the decrease in cmap amplitudes and / or sensory nerve action potencials as well as by the new development of chronic axonal changes of motor unit potentials in needle emg from distal muscles ) , or c8 radiculopathy ( with the decrease in cmap amplitudes of the ulnar and median nerves , and related chronic needle emg changes in appropriate muscles ) were associated with the ulnar or median nerves .
in the lower extremities , the most frequent abnormal findings at the follow - up examination were polyneuropathy ( with the same criteria as had been mentioned above ) , followed by l5 or s1 radiculopathy ( confirmed by subacute or chronic axonal changes of motor unit potentials in appropriate muscles in needle emg ) .
in addition , one patient without initial a - waves had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at follow - up ( table 1 and 2 ) ( documented by the generalized subacute pure motor axonopathy with fasciculations in needle emg ) .
in general , new abnormalities were most frequently associated with the median nerve ( possibly due to the high prevalence of cts ) , followed by both nerves in the lower limbs .
in the peroneal and ulnar nerves , a significantly higher number of new abnormalities were observed at follow - up in nerves with a - waves at the initial examination .
in the tibial nerve , this difference was close to significant , whereas the difference in the median nerve was not significant ( table 1 and 2 ) .
at the group level , a comparison of the ncs parameters at the initial examination did not show any significant difference between the nerves with and without a - waves with the only exception of tibial nerve , which showed mild but significant decrease of cmap amplitudes in the nerves with a - waves at the initial examination ( p = . 031 ) when being expressed in mv , but was insignificant when expressed as a z - score , i.e. , a number of standard deviations below ( negative )/ above ( positive ) the mean .
furthermore , at the individual level , the z - score values showed that the cmap amplitudes were within the normal range in all the nerves ( data not shown ) .
differences in initial mcvs and f - wave latencies between nerves with and without a - waves were not significant ( data not shown ) .
the logistic regression analysis with the odds ratios ranging from 2.7 to 30.0 ( p < . 05 ) indicated that the presence of a - waves at the initial examination had significant predictive power for the development of abnormalities at the follow - up examination 12 or more months later in all nerves , with the exception of the median nerve ( p = . 092 ) ( figure 2 , table 5 ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd 4 discussion the principal finding of this study is the confirmation that a - waves are an initial peripheral nerve abnormality in all motor nerves , including the tibial nerve .
the occurrence of a - waves had significant predictive power for the future development of broader ncs abnormalities in part of the patients and should be considered a prognostic factor for future neuropathy , neuronopathy , or radiculopathy .
a - waves are heterogeneous and involve several pathophysiological mechanisms , e.g. , an extra - axonal discharge elicited by an afferent action potential , hyperexcitability of proximal nerve segments , ephaptic transmission from one axon to another , or myoaxonal ephapse ( bischoff , 2002 ; magistris & roth , 1992 ; roth , 1993 ) .
to distinguish the pathophysiological origin of a given a - wave , special tests must be applied ( e.g. , the evaluation of the presence of a - waves following paired or repetitive stimuli and / or during a series of stimuli applied along the course of the nerve ) that are usually not conducted in routine clinical practice ( bischoff , 2002 ; kimura , 2013 ; magistris & roth , 1992 ; roth , 1993 ) .
during routine electrophysiological studies , underlying pathophysiological mechanisms thus are not identified , and a - waves are considered to be a group of late responses that differ from the f - wave and h - reflex ( bischoff et al. , 1996 ; puksa et al. , 2003 ) .
therefore , to achieve a practical application of the results , the same approach was used in this study .
the patient group for this study consisted from two subtypes of individuals : healthy controls and the patients with no objective signs of peripheral neuropathy but with various other types of complaints ( sensory symptoms , unexplained fatigue ) .
there were several reasons for not including the healthy controls only .
mainly , we tried to find - out the answer to the following question : if we perform the ncs / emg examination in routine practice , which was completely normal with the only exception of a - wave findings , should we pay attention to it ?
does such a finding represent a subclinical " mild neuropathic change " ( as had been postulated by puksa et al. , 2003 ) and thus may suggest that this particular patient has an increased " chance " to develop some clinically important abnormity in the future ?
this question is not related to " healthy controls " only , but the other way round , it may apply to any individual examined in ncs / emg lab .
similar to the results of previous studies in healthy individuals ( puksa et al. , 2003 ) , this analysis revealed that few a - waves initially occurred in the otherwise normal median and ulnar nerves .
however , they were more frequently observed in the peroneal nerve , and the highest number of a - waves was detected in the tibial nerve .
in this study , the frequency of a - waves in a particular nerve at the initial examination was similar to the findings reported by puksa et al .
( 2003 ) .
these findings confirm that a similar methodology for a - wave evaluation was used in the two studies and that the individuals examined in both studies were considered to be of the " healthy status. " the most frequent new abnormality found in second examination was carpal tunnel syndrome .
however , to our knowledge , no study has reported a relationship between a - waves and mild - to - moderate carpal tunnel syndrome ; therefore , this finding may distort the results of our study because the high prevalence of cts falsely decreases the significance and predictive power of a - waves in the median nerve .
the significantly higher frequency of the development of new abnormalities in nerves with a - waves at the initial examination supports the significance of a - waves as the initial abnormality during nerve conduction studies .
based on these results , our findings show that the occurrence of a - waves increases the future probability of developing several types of neuropathy , neuronopathy , and radiculopathy .
this observation achieved statistical significance in all nerves examined , with the exception of the median nerve , for which there was only a trend towards significance , likely due to the high prevalence of cts discussed above .
these findings were confirmed using the odds ratio and a regression analysis , which demonstrated that the presence of a - waves at the initial examination had statistically significant predictive power for the development of abnormalities in future examinations several months later in all nerves , with the exception of the median nerve ( for the same reason discussed above ) .
despite statistically significant power of a - waves in the prediction of future status of the examined peripheral nerve , the absolute numbers of the patients with newly found abnormities at second examination were quite low , which represents certain limitation of this study .
further increase in the number of patients / controls or peripheral nerves tested would allow more convincing evaluation of a - waves significance .
this , however , is not simply accessible in a single center study : the authors come from the biggest neuromuscular center in the czech republic with several thousands of patients examined every year .
in such a big cohort , only few patients / controls complied with a strict inclusion / exclusion criteria .
further confirmation of the results by multicentre trial can provide more reliable results , which can represent a suggestion for future studies .
this study shows that the occurrence of a - waves as a sole electrophysiological abnormality has significant predictive power for the future development of more pronounced neuropathies / neuronopathies and , therefore , provides a clear initial abnormality in the examined peripheral nerve .
our results thus suggest that the occurrence of a - waves as a sole abnormality during the ncs / emg examination should be reported and the re - examination after 12 or more months might be considered in relation to clinical status of the patient .
further studies confirming the results in big cohorts of patients / controls are , however , recommended .
conflict of interests the authors declare no potential conflict of interests .

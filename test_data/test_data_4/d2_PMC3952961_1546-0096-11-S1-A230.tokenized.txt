dysregulated monocyte interleukin - 1 beta ( il - 1beta ) secretion is thought to play an important role in fever flares .
objectives we hypothesized that factor ( s ) present in the serum of pfapa patients during a fever flare may induce monocytes to secrete il - 1beta which prolongs symptoms .
methods serum of three controls ( ctrl ) or pfapa patients collected during ( pfapa - in ) and between ( pfapa - out ) flares were incubated with monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers ( n = 3 ) and stimulated with ultra pure lipopolysaccharide ( lpsup ) .
il - 1beta , tnf - alpha and il - 6 levels were measured by elisa comparing serum stimulation alone and the impact of serum pre - incubation on lpsup induced cytokines .
results serum - alone treatment of monocytes did not induce any detectable increase in il - 1beta , tnf - alpha or il - 6 secretion .
however , pre - treatment with pfapa - in serum did result in significantly more il - 1beta secretion following lpsup stimulation as compared to pfapa - out serum pretreatment ( 330.8 +/ - 181.5 and 173.5 +/ - 100.1 pg / ml respectively ; n = 9 ; p < 0.05 ) .
there was no modulation in the levels of tnf - alpha and il - 6 under the present conditions , arguing for a process specific for the il - 1beta pathway .
conclusion incubation of healthy donor monocytes with serum collected during a pfapa flare increases the capacity of monocytes to secrete il - 1beta through tlr4 ligation .
the identity of the molecule ( s ) and the mechanism of action of this observation still remain to be elucidated .

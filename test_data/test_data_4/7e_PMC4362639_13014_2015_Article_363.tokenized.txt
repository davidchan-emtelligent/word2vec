background previous reports establish low risk of complications in pediatric treatments under anesthesia / sedation ( a / s ) in the outpatient setting .
here , we present our institutional experience with a / s by age and gender in children receiving daily proton rt. methods after institutional review board approval , we reviewed our center 's records between 9 / 9 / 2004 and 6 / 30 / 2013 with respect to age and gender of a / s requirement in our pediatric patients ( defined as patients <= 18 years of age ) .
results of 390 patients treated in this era , 182 were girls .
children aged <= 3 invariably required a / s ; and by age 7 - 8 , approximately half of patients do not .
for pediatric patients >= 12 years of age , approximately 10 % may require a / s for different reasons .
there was no difference by gender .
conclusions beyond age 3 , the requirement for a / s decreases in an age - dependent fashion , with a small cadre of older children having difficulty enough with sustained immobilization that a / s is necessary .
in our experience , there is no difference in a / s requirement by gender .
keywords pediatric radiotherapy anesthesia requirement gender age issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction the outpatient delivery of radiation therapy ( rt ) for children receiving daily anesthesia and / or sedation presents significant challenges .
we have previously reported that repetitive daily anesthesia / sedation ( a / s ) may be provided safely to these children treated at free standing centers remote from hospital support , with low risk of complication or hospitalization [ 1 ] .
we have also reported on the typical venous access devices and complication rates of each associated with their use in this milieu [ 2 ] .
factors requiring use of a / s to facilitate rt are poorly defined , varying on an individual basis .
such factors include , but may not be limited to : airway management , postoperative complications , cognitive function , emotional maturity , pain , musculoskeletal deformities , claustrophobia , and fear of the environment of treatment .
patients requiring rt frequently are immobilized in restraint devices that create anxiety that may require a / s to ensure accurate rt delivery .
indiana university health proton therapy center ( iuhptc ) has established expertise in treating pediatric patients in the outpatient setting [ 1 ] .
in center , pediatric patients are assessed for a / s by the attending radiation oncologist after evaluation and consultation with the patient and caregiver ( s ) .
the decision to pursue either general anesthesia or intravenous sedation in the delivery of care adds several levels of complexity to the care course including anesthesia risks , risks of daily manipulation of venous access devices [ 3 - 6 ] , increased treatment delivery time , requirement for anesthesia recovery teams and space , increased cost due to anesthesia billings , and scheduling constraints on the entire department due to patient npo needs requiring early treatments .
treatment centers offering a / s have little formal guidance on selection of patients short of physician experience based on the treatment and setup required .
however , staff planning , scheduling of other patients and center anesthesia services all require significant advance notice of a / s requirements .
to contribute to the scarce literature on the subject , this manuscript describes practical aspects of our experience with rt to pediatric patients .
we have used these data to adapt a / s use and optimize pediatric scheduling at our facility .
methods after approval by the indiana university institutional review board , the records of the iuhptc were screened for pediatric (<= 18 years of age ) patients receiving a / s with proton therapy at our center between 9 september 2004 and 30 june 2013 .
subjects who underwent daily a / s during any portion of their rt were identified and classified by gender and age .
particulars of the children receiving ga have been published previously [ 1 ] .
results 390 pediatric patients were treated within the study period , 182 ( 47 %) were girls .
patient demographics are collated in table 1 and figure 1 .

data review revealed 100 % of patients aged <= 3 years of age required a / s. this decreased by age , with about half of patients aged 7 - 8 being able to undergo rt without support .
pediatric patients aged >= 13 years still had ~ 10 % rate of a / s requirement , and that there was no statistically different rate of a / s use by gender .
discussion due to complexity of care , pediatric rt treatments are typically delivered by facilities associated with academic teaching hospitals and tertiary care children 's hospitals .
as discussed in our previous reviews of our pediatric practice [ 1,2 ] , the location of iuhptc over 50 miles away from riley children 's hospital and 3 miles from iu health bloomington hospital mandates that structured teamwork and training be continuously practiced .
the addition of a / s to an already - challenging pediatric rt treatment course adds marked complexity .
the burden on patients of npo requirements , and the potential disruption to clinic treatment flow and efficiency mandates extensive pre - planning , and proton therapy centers must individually establish efficient workflow to decrease the burden on the entire system [ 7,8 ] .
thus , we performed this analysis to identify age and gender patterns as a first step in establishing patterns of a / s use by demographic factors .
while we did not specifically track adverse events in this population dating to 2004 , informal discussion with staff personnel did not reveal additional events besides those previously reported [ 1 ] .
these data reveal that ga use is necessary in all patients age 3 and younger , with an age - dependent decrease until age 13 ( figure 1 ) .
these data are consistent with limited data in the anesthesia literature assessing pre - operative anxiety .
in a prospective study by kim and associates [ 9 ] , age , type of parent or guardian , number of siblings , waiting time and score on the modified yale preoperative anxiety scale ( mypas ) were assessed for predicting need for pre - operative sedation for anxiety in children prior to general anesthesia ( ga ) .
in multivariate analysis , age , mypas score and waiting time were significant factors related to anxiety levels requiring preoperative sedation .
the authors noted the same age - dependent pattern of decreasing need for pre - operative sedation and also the same lack of difference by gender as noted in our series .
zeev and colleagues [ 10 ] identified parent anxiety , child temperament , age and previous medical experiences as factors increasing child anxiety before ga. methods to decrease child anxiety should be considered to facilitate their rt without a / s. such strategies may be employed with little burden to the system .
non - medication strategies to relieve preoperative anxiety and decrease the need for a / s have been reported .
these strategies vary widely and include cartoon viewing [ 11 ] , hand - held video game play [ 12 ] , and presence of clown doctors [ 13 ] .
while novel , these are admittedly impossible to correlate with daily rt delivery .
other strategies such as child life staffing [ 14 ] to employ interactive strategies have been reported as successful in the diagnostic imaging milieu and merit prospective evaluation in pediatric rt delivery .
one simple parameter that should be considered when considering a / s in any pediatric rt patient is the complexity of the setup .
our clinic has extensive experience with supine craniospinal ( csi ) rt. in our prior time study of the development of the technique [ 15 ] , we documented that , even after documentation of team facility with any patient , average setup and treatment times for the four required fields remained just under one hour .
if patients require csi , that benchmark should be kept in mind .
although most older children will be able to tolerate one hour without a / s , about half of children 10 or older requiring a / s in our experience did so for csi fields .
however , the converse should be kept in mind : younger patients requiring single fields or less complex setups may be able to lie still without a / s for the shorter times involved .
this allows the clinic to reserve the limited anesthesia resources for the children that really need them .
in our experience , treating pediatric patients in general is done at a considerable financial loss [ 16 ] .
minimizing the costs inherent in a / s can only ameliorate that problem .
conclusions in pediatric rt , a / s adds substantial burden to the patient and system , mandating factors predicting its necessity be identified .
in children receiving daily rt , need for a / s decreases in an age - dependent fashion after the age of 3 , without a gender effect .
about 10 % of children 12 or older still require a / s. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

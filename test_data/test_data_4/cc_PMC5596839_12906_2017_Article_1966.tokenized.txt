background alkaloids have been considered as the most promising bioactive ingredients in plant species from the genus zanthoxylum .
this study reports on the compositions and contents of the zanthoxylum alkaloids ( zas ) from three zanthoxylum species , and their potential anti - proliferation activities .
methods an hplc - uv / esi - ms / ms method was established and employed to analyze the alkaloids in different zanthoxylum extracts .
the common and unique peaks and their relative contents were summarized and compared to evaluate the similarity and dissimilarity of the three zanthoxylum species .
meanwhile , inhibitory activity tests to four carcinoma cell lines , i.e. , stomach tumor cells ( sgc - 7901 ) , cervical tumor cells ( hela ) , colon tumor cells ( ht - 29 ) and hepatic tumor cells ( hep g2 ) , were carried out in vitro to evaluate the bioactivities of the zas .
results seventy peaks were detected in the crude total alkaloid samples , and 58 of them were identified .
as a result , 13 common peaks were found in the extracts of all the three zanthoxylum species , while some unique peaks were also observed in specific species , with 17 peaks in z. simulans , 15 peaks in z. ailanthoides and 11 peaks in z. chalybeum , respectively .
the comparison of the composition and relative contents indicated that alkaloids of benzophenanthridine type commonly present in all the three zanthoxylum species with high relative contents among the others , which are 60.52 % in z. ailanthoides , 30.52 % in z. simulans and 13.84 % in z. chalybeum , respectively .
in terms of activity test , most of the crude alkaloids extracts showed remarkable inhibitory activities against various tumor cells , and the inhibitory rates ranged from 60.71 to 93.63 % at a concentration of 200 mug / ml. however , sgc - 7901 cells seemed to be more sensitive to the zas than the other three cancer cells .
conclusion the alkaloid profiles detected in this work revealed significant differences in both structures and contents among zanthoxylum species .
the inhibitory rates for different cancer cells in this study indicated that the potential anti - cancer activity should be attributed to quaternary alkaloids in these three species , which will provide great guidance for further exploring this traditional medicinal resource as new healthcare products .

the main chemical components of these plants from this genus , such as z. nitidine , z. bungeanum , z. simulans and z. armatum , could be classified as volatile oils , lignins , flavonoids and alkaloids [ 1 - 4 ] , in which alkaloids from the genus zanthoxylum ( zas ) were considered to be the most potent anti - tumor ingredients .
for some known zas , the existing studies showed several mechanisms to further explain the anti - tumor activities , e.g. , decarine , 6 - acetonyldihydrochelerythrine and zanthocapensine induced colon cancer cells ( hct116 ) apoptosis by activating casepase - 3 pathways [ 5 ] ; sanguinarine , chelerythrine and chelidonine exhibited anti - proliferative activity against mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells ( l1210 ) by damaging leukemia dna [ 6 ] ; nitidine and angoline showed inhibitory activity against carcinoma cells by suppress c - src / fak [ 7 ] and il - 6 / stat3 [ 8 ] pathways .
although the pharmacological studies have boosted the progress in exploring this medicinal resource , the investigation of the chemical basis of different plants of the genera zanthoxylum , and the screening of new potential bioactive compounds from this genus are still hotspots for further exploring new anti - tumor drugs or healthcare products from the medicinal plants of this genus .
the conventional way to characterize zas usually involves the isolation of pure compounds and subsequent structures determination based on their nmr spectra [ 9 ] , which is not only time and labor consuming , but also inefficient and insensitive to some zas in the characterization process , especially to those in very minute amount .
to circumvent these limitations , a series of instrumental methods have been applied for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of zas , such as hsccc ( high - speed countercurrent chromatography ) , ce ( capillary electrophoresis ) , gc - ms , lc - ms , and lc - ms - nmr [ 10 - 18 ] .
due to the high performance in separation and sensitivity of alkaloids in the positive mode during the electro - spray ionization , lc - esi - ms has become one of the most powerful methods for the analysis of alkaloids from plants of these species [ 19 , 20 ] .
in this work , an hplc - uv - esi - ms / ms method was developed to analyze the crude alkaloids from z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum .
combining with chemical fingerprinting analysis of the crude extracts , the corresponding anti - proliferative activity tests were also conducted for the same samples against hepatic cancer ( hep g2 ) , gastric cancer ( sgc - 7901 ) , colon cancer ( ht - 29 ) and cervical cancer ( hela ) cells in order to correlate the contribution of different types of alkaloids to their diverse anti - proliferative activities .
this work may lay the groundwork for the further understanding of anti - cancer compositions from these three zanthoxylum species .
methods chemicals and reagents formic acid , ammonium , methanol , triethylamine , chloroform , acetic acid , trichloroacetic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) were of analytical grade and purchased from sino - pharm chemical reagent co .
( beijing , china ) .
water for hplc and lc - ms was prepared with eped ( nanjing yeap esselte technology development co. , nanjing , china ) .
the medium , dmem , fetal calf serum and pancreatic enzymes , for carcinoma cell culture were obtained from wuhan feiyi science and technology co .
( wuhan , china ) .
plant materials fresh plant materials of two zanthoxylum species ( z. simulans , and z. ailanthoides ) were collected from wuhan botanical garden in april , 2015 .
fresh stem bark of z. chalybeum was collected from kenya .
the authentication and identification of the specimens was kindly assisted by the taxonomist ( prof. guangwan hu ) of key laboratory of plant germplasm enhancement and specialty agriculture ( wuhan botanical garden ) , chinese academy of sciences .
all of voucher specimens ( no. 001 - 003 ) were deposited in the herbarium of the key laboratory .
after dried at 30 degreesc , the plant materials were crushed and stored at room temperature until use .
plant extraction after being immersed in 70 % ethanol ( with 0.5 % hcl ) for 12 h , plant materials of these three species were ultrasonically extracted for 30 min in thrice .
the extracts were combined and condensed to form dark residues .
then , the resulted residues were dispersed in water , and extracted with chloroform to remove chlorophyll after the ph of water phase was adjusted to 9 - 11 .
finally , chloroform phase was combined and concentrated to afford crude alkaloids .
hplc and lc - ms conditions a thermo accela 1250 hplc equipped with an auto - sampler and a uv - visible detector ( thermo fisher scientific , san jose , ca , usa ) was employed for the analysis of crude alkaloids .
a 10 mul sample was analyzed on a phenomenex kinetex column ( 2.6 mum , c18 , 100 x 2.1 mm ) at 25 degreesc .
the flow rate was 0.2 ml / min and the chromatograms were recorded at the wavelength of 280 nm .
0.5 % formic acid solution ( adjusted to ph = 4.5 by ammonium , a ) and acetonitrile ( b ) were selected as mobile phase , and the gradient was set as follows : 0 - 25 min , 5 - 20 % ( b ) ; 25 - 40 min , 20 % ( b ) ; 40 - 55 min , 20 - 35 % ( b ) ; 55 - 65 min , 35 - 80 % ( b ) .
for esi - ms / ms analysis , a thermo accela 600 hplc system with both uv detector and tsq quantum access max mass spectrometer ( thermo fisher scientific , san jose , ca , usa ) was used for the lc - ms analysis in the positive mode .
the mass condition was set as follows : mass range from 200 to 800 da ; spray voltage , 3.0 kv ; capillary temperature , 350 degreesc ; sheath gas pressure , 40 psi ; aux gar pressure , 10 psi .
qualitative and quantitative analysis the alkaloids were identified based on the comparison of detected ms / ms spectra with reported literatures , ms / ms spectra of reference standards and their fragment pathways .
finally , they were semi - quantified by the relative peak areas in the hplc chromatograms .
in vitro anti - proliferative activity assay four human cancer cell lines i.e. , stomach tumor cells ( sgc - 7901 ) , cervical tumor cells ( hela ) , colon tumor cells ( ht - 29 ) and hepatic tumor cells ( hep g2 ) , obtained from the china center for type culture collection ( cctcc ) , were used for anti - proliferative activity tests with the crude extracts using sulforhodamine b ( srb ) .
these cancer cells were incubated into 96 - well plate under 5 % co2 at 37 degreesc for 24 h and treated with crude zas at a concentration of 200 mug / ml in three duplicates , and dmso was used as negative control .
to make sure the security of the cells , the final concentration of dmso was less than 0.1 % .
after incubation for 72 h , the supernatant was discarded , and 100 mul 10 % trichloroacetic acid ( tca ) was added into the wells and washed after the cells were fixed for 1 h. srb was used to dye cells , and 1 % acetic acid was used to remove the excess amount of srb .
the optical density ( od ) values were determined at 565 nm [ 21 , 22 ] .
the inhibitory rate (%) equals to ( odc - odt )/ odc x 100 % , where odt and odc are the od values of the blank and the alkaloids extracts , respectively .
results and discussion optimization of hplc conditions the previous phytochemical investigation of zas indicated that the structure diversity and complexity may cause much difficulty in hplc separation .
to get better chromatograms of the crude alkaloids , the hplc conditions were optimized for the analysis of the extract of z. ailanthoides .
using one - variable method , the chromatographic column was firstly optimized by successively separating the crude extract on phenomenex kinetex c18 ( 100 x 2.1 mm , 2.6 mum ) and phenomenex ods column ( 150 x 2.00 mm , 5 mum ) .
as a result , phenomenex kinetex c18 ( 100 x 2.1 mm , 2.6 mum ) was found to have higher column efficiency , and thus selected for the further sample analysis .
considering the significant effect of mobile phase and additives on alkaloids separation and peak shape , the mobile phase conditions based on the reported systems , such as 0.1 % formic acid - 0.1 % formic acid acetonitrile , 50 mm ammonium acetate - methanol , 0.5 % acetic acid and 0.1 % triethylamine - acetonitrile , 0.1 % formic acid - acetonitrile and 0.5 % formic acid ( ph adjusted to 4.5 by ammonia ) - methanol - acetontrile [ 13 , 15 , 23 - 25 ] , were also investigated .
as preferred , 0.5 % formic acid ( ph adjusted to 4.5 by ammonia ) - acetonitrile was found to be the best mobile phase system for the analysis of the crude alkaloids extracted from z. ailanthoides .
at last , the final optimized conditions were achieved for the fingerprinting analysis of zas from these three species .
under the optimized hplc conditions , the crude alkaloids of these three species ( z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum ) were analyzed , in which the chromatograms were shown in fig. 1. it was observed that 70 peaks in the three extracts have been well separated and detected , indicating that the operation conditions adopted were suitable for the analysis of zas .
meanwhile , a preliminary study of the chromatograms revealed that the alkaloids compositions and contents exhibited significant differences among the three species. fig. 1 fingerprinting analysis of z. ailanthoides ( a ) , z. simulans ( b ) and z. chalybeum ( c ) identification of zanthoxylum alkaloids among the detected peaks , 58 alkaloids were identified based on the reported literatures , standard spectra or fragment pathways , 31 of which ( labeled as " b " in table 1 ) were identified by comparing the ms / ms spectra with reported literatures .
based on the identification , the structures of the 58 zas were shown in fig. 2. to the best of our knowledge , 15 of the zas ( labeled as " a " in table 1 ) were firstly reported in the genus zanthoxylum , and six ( peaks 4 , 6 , 13 , 31 , 35 and 37 ) were found to be alkaloids glycoside .
since different types of zas have distinguishing fragment pathways in esi - ms / ms , we classified the alkaloids into eight types to simplify the structures interpretations , i.e. , quinolone and iso - quinolone type , benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type , benzophenanthridine type , dihydrobenzophenanthridine type , berberine type , tetrahydroproberberine type , protopine type and aporpine type [ 26 - 28 ] .
the interpretations on their ms / ms data were discussed as below .

ms / ms [ 27 ] .
peaks 51 , 54 , 60 and 62 could be identified as 8 - o - demethylchelerythrine , sanguinarine , nitidine and chelerythrine , respectively , by comparing their ms / ms spectra with the published literatures [ 11 , 15 , 26 ] .
for peak 51 , the most intensive fragment at m / z 319 was observed due to the neutral loss of . ch3 from the molecular ion ([ m + h ]+ at m / z 334 ) at n moiety .
the successive loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) and co ( 28 da ) from the fragment ion at m / z 319 led to the fragments at m / z 304 and 291 , respectively .
combined with the further loss of co ( 28 da ) from fragment at m / z 304 , peak 51 can be definitely identified as 8 - o - demethylchelerythrine [ 27 ] .
as to sanguinarine ( peak 54 ) , its fragment ion at m / z 317 was produced by the loss of ch3 from the molecular ion ([ m + h ]+ at m / z 332 ) .
the most abundant fragment ion at m / z 274 was observed due to the neutral loss of co from fragment ion at m / z 304 .
therefore , peak 54 can be definitely identified as sanguinarine [ 11 , 26 , 27 ]. with same parent ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 348 , and the same fragment ions with relative intensity at m / z 332 , 318 , 304 and 290 , peak 60 and 62 could be identified as nitidine or chelerythrine based on the investigation and comparison of their ms / ms spectra with those reported literatures [ 11 , 15 , 26 , 27 ] .
however , the distinguished retention time of peak 60 and 62 , which are 45.22 min and 48.20 min , can be used to differentiate them .
separated by reversed - phase chromatography , the different retention time provided further evidence for identifying peaks 60 and 62 as nitidine and chelerythrine , respectively [ 15 ] .
for peak 48 , its fragment ions at m / z 350 , 320 and 292 were 2 da more than fragment ions at m / z 348 , 318 and 290 of nitidine .
the different fragment ions at m / z 335 and 307 could be deduced by successive neutral loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) from n and co ( 28 da ) from a ring of the fragment ion at m / z 350 .
thus , peak 48 could be identified as fagaronine [ 25 , 29 ]. with the same fragment ions as peak 48 at m / z 350 , 335 , 320 , 307 and 292 , the parent ion ([ m + h ]+) for peak 31 at m / z 512 indicated the presence of a glycoside .
thus , peak 31 was identified as fagaronine - 3 - glucoside [ 29 ] .
in the ms / ms spectrum of peak 68 , fragment ions at m / z 305 and 277 were 30 da less than those at m / z 335 and 307 of fagaronine .
thus , peak 68 could be proposed as 7,8 - dimethylchelerythrine [ 27 ] .
dihydrobenzophenanthridine type in this study , 12 peaks ( peaks 28 , 30 , 33 , 43 , 56 , 58 , 61 , 63 , 64 , 66 , 69 and 70 ) were identified and classified into dihydrobenzophenanthridine type .
compared with alkaloids of benzophenanthridine type , the n7 - c8 double bond of b ring was reduced to be a single bond in the skeleton of this type .
thus , the characteristic fragment ion was always observed to be [ m + h - ch4 ]+ in the positive mode from the ms / ms spectra [ 27 ] .
compared the ms / ms data with those from authentic standards , peaks 43 , 61 , 63 , 69 and 70 were identified as 6,10 - dihydroxyl - 3 - demethyldihydrobenzophenanthridinium , dihydrochelirubine , oxychelerythrine , dihydrosanguinarine and 6 - hydroxy - 10 - methylsanguinarine [ 26 ] , respectively. with [ m + h ]+ at m / z 384 , peak 43 produced the most abundant fragment ion at m / z 352 by neutral loss ch3oh ( 32 da ) of from d ring , and the further successive loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) and oh ( 17 da ) led to fragment ions at m / z 337 and 320 .
thus , peak 43 was identified as 6,10 - dihydroxyl - 3 - demethyldihydrobenzophenanthridinium [ 26 ] .
for peaks 61 and peak 63 , same molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 364 and fragment ions at m / z 348 and 334 were observed in the ms / ms spectra of these two peaks .
however , in terms of the different fragments at m / z 332 , 320 , 304 and 290 for peak 61 and m / z 316 , 306 , 289 and 270 for peak 63 , peaks 61 and 63 were identified as dihydrochelirubine [ 19 ] and oxychelerythrine [ 26 ] , respectively .
for peak 69 , the most abundant fragment ion at m / z 318 was produced corresponding to the loss of ch4 from n moiety , due to the double bond on b ring reduced. with the same fragment ions at m / z 304 and 290 as peak 61 , the loss of co ( 28 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 304 resulted in the different fragment at m / z 276 .
therefore , peak 69 was assigned as dihydrosanguinarine [ 27 ] .
as for peak 70 , a neutral loss of h2o from the molecular ion at m / z 380 [ m + h ]+ resulted in fragment ion at m / z 362 .
the cleavage of b ring led to the most abundant fragment at m / z 289 by loss of c2h5n ( 43 da ) .
thus , peak 70 was definitely identified as 6 - hydroxy - 10 - methylsanguinarine [ 26 ]. with the same molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 380 as peak 70 , fragment ions of peak 58 at m / z 349 , 306 and 292 were observed .
the neutral loss of substitute co2 ( 44 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 364 yielded the most intensive fragment ion at m / z 320 .
thus , peak 58 was deduced as 8 - methoxy - dihydrochelerythrine or 8 - methoxy - dihydronitidine [ 24 ] .
in the positive mode , the alkaloid at 55.71 min ( peak 64 ) yielded fragment ions at m / z 364 , 336 , 306 , 291 and 277 , which were 2 da more than fragment ions at m / z 362 , 334 , 304 , 289 and 275 in peak 70 .
thus , this alkaloid ( peak 64 ) could be proposed as 6 - methoxy - dihydronorchelerythrine n - oxide or 6 - methoxy - dihydrorhoidoline b [ 26 ] .
according to the ms / ms spectra of peak 33 , fragment ions at m / z 350 and 334 were produced by the loss of ch4 ( 14 da ) and ch4o ( 32 da ) from b ring , respectively. by b ring rearrangement and further neutral loss of c2h4o ( 44 da ) , fragment ion at m / z 322 was produced .
thus , peak 33 was deduced as 6 - methyl - 5,6 - dihydrofagaridine [ 30 ]. with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 352 for peak 28 and 354 for peak 30 , same fragment ions at m / z 322 , 308 and 280 were observed , while fragments at m / z 339 and 293 in the ms / ms spectra of peak 30 were 2 da more than the fragment ions of peak 28 at m / z 337 and 291 .
the loss of h2o from fragment ion at m / z 337 resulted in fragment ion at m / z 319 , indicating the presence of an oh on the parent molecular ion .
in addition to the 2 da discrepancy of the molecular and fragment ions , peak 28 and 30 were deduced as buegenine and 2 - dimethoxy - 3 - hydroxybeugenine [ 31 ] .
peak 66 had [ m + h ]+ at m / z 336 and fragment ions at m / z 321 , 293 , 278 and 264 were 2 da more than fragment ions at m / z 319 , 291 , 276 and 262 of 8 - o - demethylchelerythrine ( peak 51 ) [ 27 ] .
as the ms / ms spectra and proposed fragment pathways shown in fig. 3 , peak 66 was identified as 8 - o - demethyl - dihydrochelerythrine [ 27 ] .
as to peak 56 , the same fragment ions to peak 66 indicated the similarity of their structures .
the loss of a glycosyl ( 162 da ) implied the compound to be an alkaloid glucoside .
hence , peak 56 had a molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 498 and was identified as 8 - o - demethyl - dihydrochelerythrine - 9 - o - glucoside [ 27 ]. fig. 3 ms / ms spectra ( a ) and fragment pathways ( b ) of peak 66 berberine type compared with the benzophenanthridine type alkaloids , the structural skeleton of berberine type of alkaloids had double bond of c5 - c6 reduced .
in the ms / ms spectra of berberine type of alkaloids , most fragment ions were successively generated by neutral loss of substituents [ 26 ] .
based on the reported literatures , five alkaloids ( peaks 39 , 44 , 52 , 53 and 65 ) were identified and classified into this group. by comparing with the reported literatures , four alkaloids ( peaks 44 , 52 , 53 and 65 ) were identified as jatrorrhizine ( peak 44 ) [ 25 ] , palmatine ( peak 52 ) [ 32 , 33 ] , berberine ( peak 53 ) [ 26 , 27 ] and berberrubine ( peak 65 ) [ 26 ] , respectively .
in terms of peak 39 , fragment ions at m / z 368 , 352 , 338 and 310 were 30 da more than fragment ions at m / z 338 , 322 , 308 and 280 .
the gap between the two peaks indicated the structural similarity and might be attributed to a ch2o ( 30 da ) lose .
in addition to the investigation of substituents on this skeleton , such as 13 - hydroxylberberruine and 13 - methylberberine [ 26 ] , c - 13 was the most proposed position .
thus , peak 39 could be assigned as 10 - hydroxy - 2,3,9,12 - tetramethoxy - jatrorrhizine [ 25 ] .
tetrahydroproberberine type alkaloids of tetrahydroberberine type produced their characteristic and most intensive fragment ions typically via retro - diels - alder ( rda ) cleavages [ 34 ] .
based on the detected ms / ms data , six alkaloids ( peaks 23 , 26 , 27 , 40 , 45 and 47 ) were identified and classified into this type .
based on the reported ms / ms spectra , four alkaloids were identified as tetrahydropalmatine ( peak 23 ) , n - methylcanadine or its isomers ( peak 40 and 47 ) and n - methyltetrahydropalmatine ( peak 45 ) , respectively [ 25 , 26 ] .
in the ms / ms spectra of peak 23 , fragment ions at m / z 192 and 163 were observed due to the c ring cleavage .
the further neutral loss of ch2 ( 14 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 163 led to the fragment ion at m / z 149 .
in addition , another abundant fragment ion at m / z 177 was produced by rda cleavage of b ring .
thus , this alkaloid ( peak 23 ) , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 356 , was definitely identified as tetrahydropalmatine [ 25 ] .
in terms of peaks 40 and 47 , the characteristic fragment ions at m / z 190 and 175 were 2 da less than fragment ions at m / z 192 and 177 of peak 23. with [ m + h ]+ at m / z 354 , peaks 40 and 47 had same fragment ions and could be identified as n - methylcanadine or its isomers [ 26 ] .
for peak 45 , the most abundant fragment ion at m / z 206 was 14 da more than fragment ion at m / z 192 of peak 23 , which indicated the presence of a ch2 on a or b ring .
therefore , peak 45 , with parent ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 370 , was identified as n - methyltetrahydropalmatine [ 26 ] .
peak 26 had the same fragment ions at m / z 192 , 177 and 149 as peak 23 .
the further cleavage of b ring from fragment ion at m / z 192 led to the distinguished fragment ion at m / z 151 , which corresponded to a ch3 combined with n moiety .
thus , peak 26 with parent ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 356 was identified as n - methyltetrahydrocolumbamine [ 35 ] .
peak 27 produced characteristic fragment ions at m / z 190 and 149 by rda cleavage at c ring .
as a result of further loss of ch2o ( 30 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 149 , fragment ion at m / z 119 was observed .
the successive neutral loss of ch3 and ch6o from the molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 340 resulted in fragment ions at m / z 325 and 291 .
therefore , peak 27 was deduced as 2 - methoxy - 5 - dehydroscoulerine [ 36 ] .
the ms / ms spectra and proposed fragment pathway of peak 27 was shown in fig. 4. fig. 4 ms / ms spectra ( a ) and fragment pathway ( b ) of peak 27 protopine type compared with tetrahydroproberberine type alkaloids , alkaloids of this type have carbonyl at c14 , other than n7 - c14 .
as for ms / ms spectra in esi - ms / ms , major fragment ions were produced by the loss of h2o ( 18 da ) from parent ion [ m + h ]+ and further rda cleavage [ 27 ]. by comparing with reported literatures , peaks 9 and 42 were classified into protopine type and identified as hunnemannine [ 26 ] and alpha - allocryptopine [ 26 , 37 ] , respectively .
peaks 9 and 42 had the same fragment ions at m / z 206 , 188 and 149 , which were abundant and generated mainly by rda cleavage .
to distinguish the two peaks , fragment ion at m / z 338 of peak 9 yielded fragment ion at m / z 323 by neutral loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) from n. as to peak 42 , the loss of ch4o ( 32 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 352 led to fragment ion at m / z 320 .
thus , peaks 9 and 42 , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 356 and 370 , were identified as hunnemannine and alpha - allocryptopine , respectively .
aporphine type due to the loss of substituents on a and d ring and n vicinal moieties through b ring cleavage , most abundant fragment ions of aporphine type were produced in the ms / ms spectra. by comparing with reported literatures , five peaks ( peaks 11 , 20 , 29 , 32 and 34 ) were classified into aporphine type and identified as magnoflorine [ 37 ] , laurifoline [ 37 ] , menisperine [ 37 ] , 10 - demethyl - magnoflorine [ 26 ] and xanthoplanine [ 37 ] , respectively. with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 342 , fragment ions at m / z 282 , 265 , 237 , 222 and 191 were observed both in the ms / ms spectra of peak 11 and 20 .
different fragment ion at m / z 233 was generated by the neutral loss of ch4o ( 32 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 265 .
another fragment ion [ m + h - c2h7n - 2ch4o - co ]+ at m / z 205 was found to be 2 da less than fragment ion at m / z 207 in the ms / ms spectra of peak 11 .
therefore , peaks 11 and 20 were identified as magnoflorine and laurifoline by comparing the fragments relative intensity and differences , respectively [ 37 ] .
as to peaks 29 and 34 , same fragment ions at m / z 311 , 296 , 219 , 192 and 177 were observed. with intensive and same fragment ions at m / z 279 , 264 , 248 and 236 , peak 29 had retention time at 21.71 min and was identified as menisperine [ 37 ] .
for peak 34 , the loss of n vicinal moieties and substituents from a and d ring led to fragment ions at 280 , 265 , 253 and 237 .
thus , peak 34 had retention time at 24.70 min and was identified as xanthoplanine [ 37 ] .
in reference to peak 32 , fragment ions at m / z 251 , 208 and 191 were 14 da less than fragment ions at m / z 265 , 222 and 205 in the ms / ms spectra of peak 20 .
the most intensive fragment ion at m / z 121 indicated the presence of 2oh on d ring .
thus , peak 32 was proposed as 10 - demethyl - magnoflorineby comparing with the reported data [ 26 ] .
benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type biosynthesis analysis of zas provided evidence of benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type alkaloids as precursor of alkaloids , such as alkaloids of benzophenanthridine type , berberine type and aporphine type [ 38 ] .
as to the ms / ms spectra of benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type of alkaloids , fragment ions with most abundant intensity were produced by the neutral loss of n vicinal moieties and substituents on iso - quinoline ring [ 27 ] .
among the detected alkaloids , ten peaks ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 22 and 36 ) were identified and classified into benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type. by comparing with published ms / ms data , peaks 7 , 8 , 18 , 21 and 36 were identified .
same fragment ions and relative intensity were observed in the ms / ms spectra of peaks 7 , 21 and 36 .
the loss of benzyl from b ring led to fragment ions at m / z 209 and 107 .
due to the cleavage of b ring , fragment ions at m / z 166 and 137 were also observed .
the successive loss of c2h7n ( 45 da ) and ch4o ( 32 da ) from the parent ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 314 generated fragment ions at m / z 269 and 237 .
thus , the three compounds ( peaks 7 , 21 and 36 ) were identified as magnocurarine or its isomers [ 37 ] .
in reference to peak 6 , the alkaloids had molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 476 and same fragment ions with peak 7 .
the mass gap between parent ion and fragment ion at m / z 314 indicated the possible presence of a glycosyl .
therefore , with retention time at 11.67 min , peak 6 was deduced as magnocurarine - 6 - glucoside [ 37 ] .
due to the loss of benzyl in the ms / ms of peak 8 , the characteristic fragment ion at m / z 107 was observed .
moreover , the same fragment ions to peak 7 at m / z 269 and 237 showed the structural discrepancy at n vicinal moieties .
thus , peak 8 , with the molecular ion at m / z 286 , was identified as 7 - methoxyhigenamine based on its reported mass data [ 37 ] .
as to peak 18 , the loss of benzyl and its substituents yielded fragment ions at m / z 192 and 137 , and the further loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) from isoquinoline ring produced the fragment ion at m / z 177 .
due to the loss of substituents and n vicinal moieties , fragment at m / z 207 [ m + h - c7h7o2 ]+ generated fragment ions at m / z 175 , 143 and 115 by similar fragment pathway with peak 8 .
thus , peak 18 , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 330 , was identified as reticuline [ 37 ]. with retention time at 12.28 min , peak 12 had fragment ions at m / z 269 , 254 , 237 , 160 , 143 and 107 , which was almost the same to peak 8 .
in contrary to the loss of nh3 ( 17 da ) , fragment ion at m / z 269 was produced by the loss of ch3 - nh2 ( 31 da ) .
to display the fragment pathway of this type of alkaloids in detail , the ms / ms spectra and fragment pathway of peak 12 was shown in fig. 5. thus , peak 12 , with the molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 300 , was deduced as 7 - methoxy - 2 - methylhigenamine [ 37 ] .
the same fragment ions of ms / ms spectra from peak 4 and peak 12 indicated the structure similarity between the two alkaloids .
in addition to the molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 462 , fragment ion at m / z 300 was produced by the loss of a glycosyl .
thus , peak 4 , with retention time at 8.83 min , was deduced as 7 - methoxy - 2 - methylhigenamine - 4 ' - glucoside or 7 - methoxy - 2 - methylhigenamine - 6 - glucoside by comparing with the mass data of 7 - methoxy - 2 - methylhigenamine [ 37 ] .
for the fragment ions of peak 15 , the characteristic loss of benzyl and its substituents led to fragment ions at m / z 207 and 137 .
moreover , the n vicinal moiety loss generated fragment ion at m / z 301 , of which the further substituents loss yielded fragment ions at m / z 269 [ m + h - c2h5n - ch4o ]+ and 239 [ m + h - c2h5n - ch4o - ch2o ]+ .
therefore , peak 15 was speculated as isotembetarine or xylopinidine [ 25 , 35 ] .
in reference to peak 22 , the characteristic loss of benzyl generated the fragment ions at m / z 221 and 137 .
the molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 358 and fragment ion at m / z 221 in the ms / ms spectra were 14 da more than [ m + h ]+ at m / z 344 and fragment ion at m / z 207 of peak 15 , respectively .
the mass gap between the two compounds indicated a methyl substituent discrepancy on the isoquinoline ring .
thus , with retention time at 19.92 min , peak 22 could be deduced as 8 - methoxy - isotembetatrine [ 25 ]. fig. 5 ms / ms spectra ( a ) and fragment pathway ( b ) of peak 12 quinoline or isoquinoline type ten peaks ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 19 , 24 , 35 , 37 and 67 ) were identified and classified into quinoline or isoquinoline type .
in addition to the relative fragment ions intensity of peak 1 , fragment ions at m / z 177 and molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 192 were also observed in the ms / ms spectra of tetrahydropalmatine .
the successive neutral loss of substituents led to fragment ions at m / z 162 [ m + h - ch2o ]+ and 148 [ m + h - ch2o - ch2 ]+ .
therefore , peak 1 was deduced as 6,7 - dimethoxy - 3,4 - dihydroisoquinoline [ 25 ]. with retention time at 6.11 min , fragment ions of peak 2 at m / z 190 , 162 and 132 were observed due to the successive loss of ch4 ( 16 da ) , co ( 28 da ) and ch3oh ( 31 da ) from parent ion .
the further loss of n moiety and substituent from fragment ion at m / z 190 led to fragment ions at m / z 173 and 145 .
therefore , peak 2 , with molecular ion at m / z 206 , was tentatively identified as edulitine [ 39 ] .
for peak 3 , the cleavage of isoquinoline ring resulted in fragment ions at m / z 169 and 145 by the loss of n vicinal moiety from fragment ion at m / z 167 .
intensive fragment at m / z 117 was generated by further loss of co ( 28 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 145 .
as a result , peak 3 , with retention time at 7.39 min , was tentatively assigned as thalifoline [ 40 ] .
compared with peak 3 , the discrepancy fragment ion at m / z 149 obtained from peak 5 explored the differences of the two alkaloids on the isoquinoline ring .
taking the neutral loss of nh3 ( 17 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 162 into consideration , the lack of substituent on n was proved .
thus , peak 5 , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 194 , was deduced as des - n - methyl - thalifoline [ 40 ] .
as to peak 67 , the successive loss of ch3 ( 15 da ) , ch2o ( 30 da ) and c6h4 ( 76 da ) from parent ion led to fragment ions at m / z 257 , 242 and 196 , and fragment ions at m / z 164 and 149 were produced by successive loss of ch3oh ( 32 da ) and ch3 ( 15 da ) from fragment ion at m / z 196 .
therefore , peak 67 , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 272 , was deduced as 1,2 - dihydroxy - 3 - methoxy - 10 - methyl - 9 - acridone [ 41 ]. with same fragment ions as peak 67 , peak 13 had molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 434 , which revealed the presence of a glycosyl in this alkaloids .
thus , with retention time at 15.85 min , peak 13 was deduced as 2 - dihydroxy - 3 - methoxy - 10 - methyl - 9 - acridone - 1 - glucoside or 1 - dihydroxy - 3 - methoxy - 10 - methyl - 9 - acridone - 2 - glucoside [ 41 ] .
for peak 24 , rda cleavage of c ring produced the most intensive fragment ion at m / z 188 , and the further loss of co ( 28 da ) yielded fragment at m / z 160 .
in addition , fragment ions at m / z 134 and 106 were observed due to the cleavage of b ring and substituent loss .
thus , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 260 , peak 24 could be tentatively identified as ribalinine [ 42 ] .
another alkaloid ( peak 35 ) shared same fragment ions to peak 24 .
fragment ion at m / z 260 indicated a loss of a glycosyl from parent ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 422 .
thus , with retention time at 25.33 min , peak 35 could be tentatively deduced as ribalinine 3 ' - glucoside [ 42 ] .
peak 19 had the same fragment ions at m / z 242 , 188 and 160 as peak 24 , indicating the structure similarity of the two compounds .
the cleavage of c ring led to fragment ions at m / z 218 [ m + h - c4h8o ]+ and 160 [ m + h - c6h10o3 ]+ , which confirmed the difference on c - 4 ' .
therefore , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 290 , peak 19 could be deduced as 4 ' - methoxy - ribalinine [ 42 ] .
peak 37 was detected at 25.92 min , and displayed same fragment ions with peak 19 .
as a result of the loss of glycosyl , fragment ion at m / z 290 was observed .
thus , peak 37 , with molecular ion [ m + h ]+ at m / z 452 , was deduced as 4 ' - methoxy - ribalinine - 3 ' - glucoside [ 42 ] .
comparison of zas detected among the three species the fingerprinting profiles of zas in fig. 1 showed a preliminary difference in the alkaloids among the three species ( z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum ) .
since both qualitative and quantitative information may help to understand the most bio - active and potential alkaloids , the common and unique peaks for the three species were summarized in fig. 6a .
as a result , 13 common peaks ( i.e. , 3 , 5 , 11 , 17 , 18 , 34 , 39 , 42 , 46 , 51 , 62 , 68 and 70 ) were found in the extracts of all the three zanthoxylum species , while some unique peaks were also observed in specific species , which are 17 peaks in z. simulans , 15 peaks in z. ailanthoides and 11 peaks in z. chalybeum , respectively .
moreover , three alkaloids ( peaks 7 , 14 and 22 ) were only found in z. ailanthoides and z. simulans , six alkaloids ( peaks 2 , 21 , 28 , 30 , 60 and 64 ) only in z. ailanthoides and z. chalybeum , and five alkaloids ( peaks 6 , 15 , 16 , 47 and 53 ) only in z. simulans and z. chalybeum .
to some extent , these unique peaks may be used as chemical markers to differentiate these three species for quality control purposes. fig. 6 qualitative ( a ) and quantitative ( b ) differences of zas from z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum based on the alkaloids identification , the peak areas of each type of alkaloids from the three species ( z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum ) were summarized to explore quantitative differences of the zas , as shown in fig. 6b .
for alkaloids from z. ailanthoides , benzophenanthridine type ( 60.52 %) and quinoline or isoquinoline type ( 20.66 %) were the most abundant alkaloids , followed by benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type ( 4.88 %) , dihydrobenzophenanthridine type ( 2.94 %) , berberine type ( 2.17 %) , aporphine type ( 2.15 %) , tetrahydroproberberine type ( 0.42 %) and protopine type ( 0.25 %) .
for z. simulans , benzophenanthridine type and benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type contributed to 30.52 % and 23.49 % , followed by aporphine type ( 15.22 %) , berberine type ( 11.10 %) , tetrahydroproberberine type ( 9.28 %) , quinoline or isoquinoline type ( 8.30 %) , protopine type ( 1.59 %) and dihydrobenzophenanthridine type ( 0.49 %) , respectively .
for the alkaloids in z. chalybeum , the major alkaloids were in protopine type at relative content of 59.88 % , together with benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type at 14.42 % , benzophenanthridine type at 13.84 % , dihydrobenzophenanthridine type at 8.09 % , tetrahydroproberberine type at 1.35 % , quinoline or isoquinoline type at 1.02 % , protopine type at 0.76 % and aporphine type at 0.64 % , respectively .
notably , based on the analysis of composition and contents of zas in the three species , alkaloids of benzophenanthridine type were found to be the most common zas , which accounts for over 14 % in all the three species .
anti - proliferative activities of zas against carcinoma cells to explore the correlation between zas and their potential bioactivities , in vitro inhibitory activity tests against cancer cells have been performed on the crude extracts of alkaloids from the three zanthoxylum species , using sulforhodamine b ( srb ) method to test four cancer cells , i.e. , human gastric cancer cells ( sgc - 7901 ) , cervical cancer cells ( hela ) , human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells ( ht - 29 ) and human hepatocyte carcinoma cells ( hep g2 ) .
as shown in fig. 7 , zas showed remarkably proliferative inhibition to all the four cancer cell lines , which ranged from 60.71 to 93.63 % at a concentration of 200 mug / ml. an exception was found on the crude alkaloids of z. ailanthoides with hep g2 inhibitory rate at 16.83 % .
to some extent , sgc - 7901 seemed to be more sensitive to the zas than the other three cancer cells. fig. 7 inhibitory rates against four different cancer cell lines ( a ) and relative contents of quaternary alkaloids ( b ) of z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum it was well documented that the cancer cell inhibitory rate was not only relevant to the composition and content of the testing chemicals , but also to the water solubility of the chemicals [ 43 ] , which inspired us to focus on the water - soluble zas .
quaternary alkaloids in zanthoxylumgenus have been recognized as promising anti - cancer candidates by penetrating through the carcinoma cell membrane [ 44 ] and attracting the negative electron on dna [ 45 ] .
therefore , in this study , the percentage of quaternary alkaloids from the three zanthoxylum species has been further evaluated for their contribution to the cancer cell inhibitory rate .
as a result , with positive charge on the molecule , 27 zas have been classified into quaternary alkaloids from the three zanthoxylum species , i.e. , peaks 6 , 7 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 39 , 40 , 44 , 45 , 47 , 48 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 60 , 62 , 65 and 68 , which belongs to benzophenanthridine type , aporphine type , berberine type , benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline type and tetrahydroproberberine type according to their structural skeleton .
as shown in fig. 7b , other than non - quaternary and unidentified alkaloids , the percentages of quaternary alkaloids were 83.4 % , 58.6 % , 52.4 % for z. chalybeum , z. ailanthoides , z. simulans , respectively .
since high content of quaternary alkaloids and high cancer cell inhibitory rates were simultaneously found on bioactivity tests of zas , the quaternary alkaloids could be proposed as the most potential bioactive compounds in the genus zanthoxylum , which will provide great guidance to the further exploitation of this chinese herb medicine as new drugs or healthcare products .
conclusions based on the hplc - uv / esi - ms / ms method developed in this work , a fingerprinting comparison was conducted on zas from z. ailanthoides , z. simulans and z. chalybeum .
as a result , remarkable differences were shown on the fingerprints in both the compositions and contents of alkaloids among the three zanthoxylum species .
in more details , a total of 70 peaks corresponding to alkaloids were detected , of which 58 peaks were identified by comparing their ms / ms spectra with the reported literatures .
more interestingly , 27 quaternary alkaloids and 6 alkaloid - glycosides were reported for the first time .
moreover , carcinoma cell inhibitory rates to four cancer cell lines were investigated to evaluate the contribution of some distinct compositions .
consequently , quaternary alkaloids of zas were proposed as the most potent proliferative inhibitors against cancer cells and crude zas showed more sensitive to sgc - 7901 cells than the other cancer cells .
to the best of our knowledge , this work provides the most details on zas and their potential activities , and offered valuable information to further explore zanthoxylum alkaloids in this genus as new healthcare products in the near future .

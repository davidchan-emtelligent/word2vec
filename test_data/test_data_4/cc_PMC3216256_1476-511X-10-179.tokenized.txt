background numerous health benefits associated with increased omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n - 3 pufa ) consumption has lead to an increasing variety of available n - 3 pufa sources .
however , sources differ in the type , amount , and structural form of the n - 3 pufas .
therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the effect of different sources of omega - 3 pufas on digestibility , tissue deposition , eicosanoid metabolism , and oxidative stability .
methods female sprague - dawley rats ( age 28 d ) were randomly assigned ( n = 10 / group ) to be fed a high fat 12 % ( wt ) diet consisting of either corn oil ( co ) or n - 3 pufa rich flaxseed ( fo ) , krill ( ko ) , menhaden ( mo ) , salmon ( so ) or tuna ( to ) oil for 8 weeks .
rats were individually housed in metabolic cages to determine fatty acid digestibility .
diet and tissue fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography and lipid classes using thin layer chromatography .
eicosanoid metabolism was determined by measuring urinary metabolites of 2 - series prostaglandins ( pgs ) and thromoboxanes ( txbs ) using enzyme immunoassays .
oxidative stability was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( tbars ) and total antioxidant capacity ( tac ) using colorimetric assays .
gene expression of antioxidant defense enzymes was determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) .
results rats fed ko had significantly lower dha digestibility and brain dha incorporation than so and to - fed rats. of the n - 3 pufa sources , rats fed so and to had the highest n - 3 pufas digestibility and in turn , tissue accretion .
higher tissue n - 3 lc - pufas had no significant effect on 2 - series pg and txb metabolites .
despite higher tissue n - 3 lc - pufa deposition , there was no increase in oxidation susceptibility indicated by no significant increase in tbars or decrease in tac and gene expression of antioxidant defense enzymes , in so or to - fed rats .
conclusions on the basis that the optimal n - 3 pufa sources should provide high digestibility and efficient tissue incorporation with the least tissue lipid peroxidation , to and so appeared to be the most beneficial of the n - 3 pufas sources evaluated in this study .
marine oils flaxseed oil krill oil digestibility tissue accretion oxidative stress background the omega - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n - 6 pufa ) , linoleic acid ( la , 18:2n - 6 ) followed by the omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n - 3 pufa ) , alpha - linolenic acid ( ala , 18:3n - 3 ) are the primary pufas in the western diet [ 1 ] .
la and ala are essential fatty acids that must be obtained from the diet .
once consumed , la and ala may be metabolized in the mammalian tissue into long - chain pufas ( lc - pufas ) .
the major n - 6 long - chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( lc - pufa ) is arachidonic acid ( ara , 20:4n - 6 ) , and the bioactive n - 3 lc - pufas are eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa , 20:5n - 3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha , 20:6n - 3 ) .
la and ala use the same series of enzymes for biosynthesis into their respective lc - pufas and therefore , an excess of one decreases the conversion of the other .
in the western diet , the n - 6 / n - 3 ratio is ~ 16:1 ; however , for optimal health an n - 6 / n - 3 ratio of 4:1 is recommended [ 2 ] .
increased dietary n - 3 pufas intake promotes retina and brain development in infants [ 3 ] .
in adults , n - 3 pufa consumption has been reported to improve health by reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , obesity , diabetes , inflammation , and several neurological diseases [ 4 ] .
atherogenic , pro - thrombotic , and inflammatory effects are influenced by ara .
ara - derived 2 - series eicosanoids synthesized by the enzyme , cyclooxygenase ii ( cox ii ) , include the platelet aggregating thromboxane b2 ( txb2 ) , and the pro - inflammatory prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) .
epa using the same cox ii enzyme as ara produces 3 - series eicosanoids that are less inflammatory and decrease platelet aggregation .
therefore , increasing epa intake may competitively inhibit the production of ara - derived 2 - series eicosanoids resulting in decreased inflammation , blood - clotting , and in turn , reduced cvd risk [ 5 ] .
reports of numerous health benefits have contributed to the popularity of n - 3 pufa enriched foods and / or supplements [ 6 ] .
however , different sources of oils provide different types of n - 3 pufas .
flaxseed oil is a rich source of the n - 3 pufa , ala , whereas fish oils are rich in the n - 3 lc - pufas , epa and dha .
additionally , various fish oils have different epa : dha ratios [ 7 ] .
similar to fish oil , krill oil ( ko ) is rich in epa and dha .
however , fatty acids from fish oils are mainly associated with triglycerides ( tgs ) , whereas the n - 3 pufas in ko are associated with phospholipids ( pls ) and tgs [ 8 ] .
pls and tgs are digested differently and in turn , this may affect n - 3 pufa bioavailability .
in human studies , feeding infants dha in pl form resulted in better absorption than feeding dha in tg form [ 3 ] .
determining the digestibility of n - 3 pufas provided as pl compared to tg is important because this influences n - 3 pufa incorporation into tissues .
valenzuela et al .
[ 9 ] reported increased liver dha accretion in female rats fed n - 3 pufas in pl compared to tg form .
increasing tissue n - 3 pufa exerts beneficial physiological effects by influencing cell membrane fluidity , membrane - bound receptors , signaling molecules , and gene expression [ 10 ] .
however , the higher unsaturation due to increased tissue n - 3 pufas may lead to increased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation and in turn , oxidative stress .
the effect of n - 3 lc - pufa intake on lipid peroxidation has produced inconsistent results of increased oxidation [ 11 - 13 ] , no effect on oxidation [ 14 ] , and even decreased oxidation [ 15 ] .
pufas in pl form have been suggested to have greater stability against lipid oxidation due to their incorporation into cell membranes [ 16 ] .
however , song et al .
[ 11 ] reported that rat fed dha in pl form resulted in similar oxidation as feeding dha in tg form .
only when the accumulation of oxidants overwhelms the body 's antioxidant enzymes does oxidative stress and negative health effects occur .
therefore , more studies are necessary to determine the effect of different sources of n - 3 pufas on tissue oxidation and tissue antioxidant defense enzymes .
currently , various sources of n - 3 pufas are available with claims that some sources are more beneficial than others .
the source of n - 3 pufas that is most favorable to health should provide high digestibility and efficient tissue incorporation with the least tissue lipid peroxidation .
therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the effect of different sources of n - 3 pufas on digestibility , tissue deposition , eicosanoid metabolism , and oxidative stability .
methods diets experimental diets fed to animals were formulated to match the standard purified american institute of nutrition - 93g ( ain - 93 g ) diet which meets the nutritional requirements for growing rats as defined by the national research council [ 17 ] .
modifications of the ain - 93g diet consisted of replacing 7 % lipids with 12 % lipid by weight .
the high fat diet (~ 27 % by kcals ) was used to reflect the higher total fat intake typical of the western diet (~ 33 % by kcals ) .
the dietary oils consisted of either : 1 ) corn oil ( co ) , 2 ) flaxseed oil ( fo ) , 3 ) krill oil ( ko ) , 4 ) menhaden oil ( mo ) , 5 ) salmon oil ( so ) or 6 ) tuna oil ( to ) .
co , fo , mo , so , and to sources were provided by j. edwards international inc .
( quincy , ma ) .
ko was purchased from enzymotec ltd .
( morristown , nj ) .
it was necessary to add co ( 2 g / kg diet ) to the mo and ko ( 10 g / kg diet ) diets to meet the national research council [ 17 ] nutrient recommendation in rats for the essential n - 6 pufa , linoleic acid ( la , 18:2n - 6 ) ( table 1 ) .

abbreviations are co , corn oil ; fo , flaxseed oil ; ko , krill oil ; mo , menhaden oil ; so , salmon oil ; to , tuna oil table 2 shows the fatty acid composition and lipid classes of the experimental oil .
the lipid sources were selected on the basis that co is prevalent in the western diet and provides a high n - 6 : n - 3 ratio of 73:1 .
fo is the richest source of the essential n - 3 pufa , ala [ 18 ] .
the epa : dha ratio of 5:1 in so was higher than 1:2 in to. ko and mo have a similar epa : dha ratio of 3:1 ; however , fatty acids in mo are in tg form and fatty acids in ko are in pl as well as tg form ( table 2 ) .

discussion the variety of commercially available n - 3 pufa sources raises the question of which is the most beneficial .
in ko , pufas are mainly in pl form whereas in fish oils , pufas are mainly in tg form , leading to claims that n - 3 lc - pufas are better absorbed as ko than fish oils [ 26 ] .
this study compared sources of n - 3 pufas that differed in the amount , type , and / or structural form of n - 3 pufas .
apparent digestibility pufa digestibility was influenced by the structural form .
in our study , dha content was ~ 2 - 4 times higher in ko compared to the other sources of n - 3 pufas .
however , apparent digestibility was greater ( p = 0.009 ) in so compared to ko - fed rats .
this may be due to ~ 50 % of dha being in pl form in ko , whereas dha was entirely in tg form in so. dha was also in tg form in the other fish oils ( mo and to ) , yet apparent dha digestibility was not significantly different than ko - fed rats .
in human studies , absorption efficiency of dha from ko was similar to mo [ 27,28 ] .
in our study , higher dha digestibility in so , but not rats fed mo or to may be due to differences in the positional distribution of dha on the tg molecule .
christensen et al .
[ 29 ] reported dha on the sn - 2 position resulted in higher absorption compared to the sn - 1 and sn - 3 position of the tg molecule .
while , the fatty acid position on the lipid structure may be a factor affecting digestibility .
overall total lipid digestibility was lowest ( p < 0.02 ) in ko - fed rats which may be accounted for by fatty acids in ko being associated with pl. amate and ramirez [ 30 ] observed reduced absorption of n - 3 lc - pufas in rats fed pl - rich pig brain .
in contrast , infants and pre - term infants fed lc - pufa pl as egg lecithin improved fat absorption [ 31,32 ] .
in the brain , dha are mainly associated with phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine [ 33 ] , whereas the predominant pl in egg is phosphatidylcholine [ 34 ] .
further studies are needed to clarify whether different pls influence fatty acid digestibility .
this is important because the source of pufas that provides high digestibility also increases tissue deposition .
brain pufa deposition epidemiological studies have linked low dha to poor neural development in infants and to cognitive decline in the aging individuals [ 35 ] .
in animals , decreased dha in the developing brain resulted in deficits in neurogenesis , neurotransmitters , visual function , and learning [ 35 ] .
in humans , pl contributes to ~ 25 % of the dry weight of the brain [ 36 ] .
however , in our study dha was better incorporated when consumed in tg than pl form .
to with the highest dha in tg form resulted in the highest ( p < 0.001 ) brain dha deposition .
ko with the highest dha in pl form did not result in the highest brain deposition due to reduced dha digestibility .
the higher dha digestibility associated with so also resulted in the highest ( p < 0.001 ) brain dha deposition .

[ 37 ] observed rats fed epa + dha increased brain dha , but produced only a small increase in epa due to inefficient tissue uptake. of the marine oils , to with the lowest epa content resulted in lower ( p = 0.01 ) brain epa deposition compared to rats fed mo or fo. dietary fo contained no detectable epa ; therefore , epa deposition in the brain tissue of fo - fed rats suggested that de novo synthesis of the n - 3 lc - pufas occurred in the brain .
brain metabolism , function , and structure also depend on adequate concentrations of ara [ 38 ] .
in our study , the co and fo diets had no detectable ara , but the highest la content .
in turn , brain la content was highest ( p < 0.001 ) in co and fo - fed rats .
efficient metabolism of la to n - 6 lc - pufas in the brain was indicated by ara deposition in rats fed co and fo. brain ara content in co - fed rats was comparable to rats fed so and to with the highest dietary ara - tg content .
on the other hand , conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas was less efficient .
feeding rats fo , but not co , increased brain epa .
this may be due to higher ala content in the fo ( 14.6 +/ - 2.1 mg / g ) than the co ( 0.1 +/ - 0.01 mg / g ) diet .
brain dha deposition in rats fed co and fo diets containing no dha indicated conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas .
several studies reported increased brain dha in rats fed ala [ 39 - 42 ] .
in our study , rats fed so and to with pre - formed dha had significantly higher brain dha deposition than fo or co - fed rats having no dietary dha .
the results indicated greater brain incorporation of pre - formed dha compared to conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas .
ko and mo also provided pre - form n - 3 lc - pufas ; however , dha content provided by mo was low and ko had reduced dha digestibility .
due to limited biosynthesis of dha in the mammalian brain , dha deposition in the brain relies on the diet and on the release of dha synthesized from ala in the liver [ 33,43 ] .
therefore , the effect of feeding different sources of n - 3 pufa on liver fatty acid composition was evaluated .
liver pufa deposition the amount of dietary fatty acids affected liver deposition .
rats fed fo with the highest ala content also had the highest ( p < 0.001 ) liver ala deposition .
rats fed so with the highest dietary epa - tg resulted in the highest ( p < 0.001 ) liver epa deposition. of the oil sources , ko had the highest dha content ; however , liver dha deposition was highest ( p < 0.001 ) in rats fed to and so. to provided the highest dha in tg form and so - fed rats showed greater dha digestibility than ko. liver dha incorporation as to was ~ 1.5 times greater in the form of tg than pl in to and so - fed rats , whereas dha was equally incorporated as tg and pl in ko - fed rats .
song and miyazawa [ 12 ] reported that rats fed dha in pl form had lower liver dha incorporation compared to dha fed in tg form .
the liver is a major site of lc - pufa biosynthesis .
therefore , n - 3 lc - pufa deposition is not only dependent on the intake of pre - formed epa and dha , but it also depends on intake of the precursor , ala .
feeding rats co containing ala and no n - 3 lc - pufas resulted in dha , but no detectable epa liver deposition .
dha has a structural role , whereas epa is preferentially utilized for beta - oxidation or eicosanoid synthesis [ 44 ] .
similarly , fo contains no pre - formed n - 3 lc - pufa .
feeding rats fo with the highest ala content resulted in detectable dha as well as epa deposition in the liver .
still , conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas resulted in lower liver epa and dha deposition compared to consumption of so and to with pre - formed n - 3 lc - pufas .
talahalli et al .
[ 37 ] reported rats needed to consume 12.5 times more ala to produce the same liver n - 3 lc - pufas incorporation as rats consuming epa and dha .
this may be due to preferential use of ala in beta - oxidation [ 45 ] .
also , several enzymes required for synthesis of lc - pufas in the desaturation - elongation pathway are inefficient [ 46 ] .
on the other hand , there was efficient liver conversion of la to n - 6 lc - pufas .
this was indicated by similar liver ara deposition in rats fed co containing no detectable ara compared to so containing pre - formed ara .
additionally , liver ara deposition was significantly higher in co than fo , ko or mo - fed rats .
this may have occurred because fo had the highest ala content followed by mo and ko. ala and la compete for the same enzymes to form their respective lc - pufas with ala having higher affinity for the rate - limiting delta - 6 desaturase [ 33 ] .
this has important implications because decreased ara reduces synthesis of pro - thrombotic and inflammatory 2 - series eicosanoids by cox ii. however , our study showed no significant differences in the 2 - series eicosanoids , pge2 and txb2 metabolites among the diet groups .
feeding rats fo , which is high in ala , decreased liver ara , but this was not accompanied by increased epa deposition .
conversely , feeding rats so increased liver epa , but this was not accompanied by decreased ara deposition .
furthermore , measurement of urinary pge2 and txb2 metabolites provided an indicator of systemic rather than tissue change .
responses to n - 3 pufa intakes are not uniform among tissues .
for example , liver fatty acid composition may vary depending on the uptake of chylomicron remnants from the circulation [ 47 ] .
also , the liver not being a major storage organ is less responsive to the diet than adipose tissues [ 37 ] .
recent research suggests changing the fatty acid profile of adipose tissue results in health benefits by altering lipid metabolism and adipokine secretion [ 48,49 ] .
therefore , the effect of consuming different n - 3 pufa sources on adipose tissue pufa composition was determined .
adipose tissues pufa deposition as the chief site for lipid storage , the fatty acid profile of adipose tissue reflected the diet .
rats fed ko with the highest amount of epa had the highest ( p < 0.001 ) adipose tissue epa deposition .
rats fed fo with the highest amount of ala content had the highest ( p < 0.001 ) adipose tissue ala deposition .
talahalli et al [ 37 ] reported rats fed increasing doses of ala resulted in a linear increase in ala accumulation in the adipose tissue .
in our study , rats fed fo increased n - 3 pufa deposition in the adipose due to the high dietary ala content .
additionally , rats fed ko and mo increased adipose n - 3 pufa deposition .
others also reported feeding rats fish oils increased n - 3 lc - pufa incorporation in the adipose tissue [ 50 - 53 ] .
increasing adipose tissue n - 3 pufa incorporation has been observed to reduce adipose mass [ 48 ] .
however , in our study , there was no significant reduction in the adipose mass of rats fed different n - 3 pufa sources .
the adipose tissue is another site of lc - pufa biosynthesis .
efficient conversion of la to n - 6 lc - pufas in gonadal adipose was indicated by rats fed fo and co containing no ara having similar tissue ara deposition to rats fed mo , ko or so containing pre - formed ara .
in retroperitoneal adipose , rats fed co had similar tissue ara to rat fed marine oils .
fo also resulted in tissue ara , but lower ( p < 0.001 ) amounts than rats fed co or marine oils .
this may be due to fo having the highest ala content .
high ala competitively inhibits la , the precursor of ara .
conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas was less efficient .
in our study , there were no detectable epa and dha in the adipose of co - fed rats .
however , rats fed fo containing ala , but no dha , resulted in dha deposition in gonadal and not in retroperitoneal adipose tissue .
this suggested conversion of ala to n - 3 lc - pufas was less efficient in retroperitoneal adipose compared to gonadal adipose .
muhlhausler et al .
[ 49 ] observed female rats fed n - 3 pufa had different degrees of responsiveness to pufa deposition and in turn , tissue pufas induced changes in lipogenic gene expression .
furthermore , gene expression changes were more pronounced in the omental compared to retroperitoneal adipose tissue .
rats fed fo and marine oils had an adipose tissue n - 6 / n - 3 ratio of 1:1 - 1:2 .
an n - 6 / n - 3 ratio of ~ 1:1 in tissues has been reported to reduce atherosclerosis due to the inhibition of systemic and vascular inflammation in apolipoprotein e - deficient mice [ 54 ] .
while the optimal n - 6 / n - 3 ratio in tissues has not been defined , increasing tissue unsaturation has been considered to be health beneficial .
however , the higher tissue unsaturation needs to be considered since a greater number of double bonds increases tissue susceptibility to lipid peroxidation .
oxidative stability dha is particularly susceptible to lipid peroxidation due to its high degree of unsaturation [ 11 ] .
our study showed rats fed to , the highest source of dha of the fish oils or so with the high dha digestibility resulted in lower ( p = 0.005 ) serum tbars compared to all diet groups , except fo - fed rats .
however , there were no significant differences in rbc tbars among the diet groups .
oxidative stress occurs when accumulation of oxidative products overwhelms the body 's antioxidant capacity .
tac measures endogenous antioxidant , dietary antioxidant , and interactions between antioxidants [ 55 ] .
in our study , serum tac was not significantly different among the diet groups .
circulating tbars and tac may not reflect the tissue concentration .
the liver is a primary target for oxidative stress - induced damage in oil - fed rats [ 12 ] .
rats fed mo had the highest ( p = 0.03 ) liver tbars .
the tbars assay is accepted as an index of oxidative stress ; however , this method quantifies mda - like compounds and does not specifically measure lipid peroxidation [ 56 ] .
furthermore , it is the imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants that leads to oxidative stress .
reena and lokesh [ 57 ] reported that the lipid peroxides generated by feeding rats pufas was partly nullified by the capability of pufas to increased liver antioxidant enzymes , cu / zn sod , mn sod , cat , and gsh - px. extracellular and cytosolic forms of sod depend on cu / zn and in the mitochondria sod depends on mn. sod detoxifies superoxide radicals giving rise to hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) .
h2o2 is a potent free radical generator and can generate hydroxyl radicals , which induce lipid peroxidation of cell membranes .
therefore , to prevent accumulation of h2o2 , it is important that enhanced sod activity be accompanied by increased cellular cat and gsh - px [ 58 ] .
ruiz - gutierrez et al .
[ 59 ] reported increased n - 3 pufas enhanced the efficiency of the antioxidant defense system .
in our study , rats fed so and to had a p : s ratio of 3:1 compared the range of 2:1 to 1.2:1 in the other treatment groups .
however , liver tac was higher in mo ( p = 0.03 ) than to or so - fed rats .
according to venkatraman et al .
[ 60 ] , different lipids had differential effects on the antioxidant defense system at the molecular level .
mice fed mo and ko had higher liver sod , cat , and gsh - px mrna expression than rats fed co [ 60 ] .
in our study , there were no significant differences in sod or cat gene expression in rats fed different sources of n - 3 pufas .
rats fed fish oils increased gsh - px mrna expression compared to co or fo - fed rats , although this was not statistically significant .
demoz et al .
[ 15 ] reported that mice provided high doses of epa enhanced liver antioxidant enzyme activities .
in our study , epa was in tg form in so , whereas in ko ~ 27 % of epa was in pl form .
in turn , liver deposition of epa as pl was ~ 50 % in ko - fed rats compared to ~ 40 % epa the so - fed rats .
additionally , ko also contains high amounts of the powerful antioxidant , astaxanthin [ 61,62 ] .
however , in the present study there were no significant differences in sod , cat or gsh - px mrna expression in rats fed ko compared to the other diet groups .
conclusions the present study evaluated popular sources of n - 3 pufa as well as ko , a novel source of n - 3 pufas .
higher pl content in ko compared to fish oils has lead to commercial claims of enhanced digestibility which improves n - 3 pufa tissue deposition and greater oxidative stability .
based on our results , rats fed ko had lower dha digestibility and brain incorporation compared to the fish oil sources , so and to. despite ko being rich in the antioxidant astaxanthin [ 26,62 ] , lipid oxidation was not decreased and gene expression of antioxidant defense enzymes was not increased .
on the other hand , rats fed so and to had the highest n - 3 pufas digestibility and in turn , tissue accretion .
lipid oxidation was not increased in either so or to - fed rats despite higher tissue dha deposition .
on the basis that the optimal n - 3 pufa sources should provide high digestibility and efficient tissue incorporation with the least tissue lipid peroxidation , to and so appeared to be the sources of n - 3 pufas most favorable to health .

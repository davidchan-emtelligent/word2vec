background wound healing is an intricate process whereby the skin repairs itself after injury .
the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is associated with wound healing and tissue regeneration .
naphthochalcone derivatives have various pharmaceutical properties .
we investigated the effect of a novel naphthochalcone derivative , 2 - ( 5 - ( 2,4,6 - trimethoxyphenyl ) - 4,5 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) naphthalen - 1 - ol ( tdpn ) , on dermal wound healing in vivo and the migration of keratinocytes in vitro .
result we investigated the effect of tdpn on signaling pathway and epithelial - mesenchymal transition through protein and transcriptional expression .
the tdpn treatment accelerated dermal closure about 3 days and remodeling of dermis .
we found that treatment with tdpn induced the migration of keratinocytes but not cytotoxicity .
tdpn induced the phosphorylation of erk and akt .
tdpn - treated cells showed loss of adherence protein and showed induction of the transcriptional factor slug , mesenchymal marker , and fibronectin .
moreover , tdpn treatment induced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase - 1 ( mmp - 1 ) , which degrades specific components of the extracellular matrix , thereby providing new substrates that facilitate migration and invasion .
mmp expression is considered to be one of the major attributes acquired by cells after emt .
conclusion we propose that a novel naphthochalcone derivative tdpn is capable of promoting keratinocyte migration via the induction of emt resulting acceleration of wound closure and matrix remodeling .

keywords naphthochalcone epithelial - mesenchymal transition mmp ecm issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background skin is the outermost organ of body that provides a barrier function to the body .
in the epidermis layer of the skin , keratinocytes are the major cell population , constituting more than 90 % of all the cells [ 1 ] .
when injuries to the skin occur , the keratinocytes at the wound site undergo morphologic alterations , changing from sedentary cells to migratory cells [ 2 ] .
the phenotype of the migratory cells changes with respect to cell - cell adhesion and cell - matrix adhesion during the re - epithelialization stage .
this phenotype partially resembles the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) process , which plays a critical role in cancer metastasis [ 2 ] .
during both re - epithelialization and cancer metastasis , cells that undergo emt lose contact with each other and the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) [ 3 ] .
the ecm may be degraded by matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , which represent a family of zinc - containing endopeptidases .
the relationship between the emt and mmps has been clarified .
mmp expression is considered to be one of the major attributes acquired by epithelial cells after they undergo the emt [ 4 ] .
mmps , such as mmp - 1 , mmp - 2 , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 13 , are frequently associated with processes that involve tissue re - modeling and cell migration .
membrane type 1 - mmp ( mt1 - mmp ) is spatially and temporally regulated during mcf10a cell migration owing to its mediation of pericellular proteolysis of the laminin - 5 ( ln - 5 ) g2 chain [ 5 ] .
the emt is influenced by a wide range of regulatory factors .
the signaling pathways for pi3k / akt / mtor and mapk ( erk ) are reported to be involved in the regulation of emt [ 2 , 6 ] .
increased phosphorylation of akt has been implicated in the induction of the emt and cell migration [ 7 ] .
furthermore , the transcriptional factors snail and slug play essential roles in cell migration .
slug expression has been shown to be up - regulated in the wound margins in the in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo settings [ 8 ] .
in slug - null mice , re - epithelialization is reduced , compared with wild - type mice [ 8 ] .
pure chalcones , which are extracted from plants , display interesting biological properties , such as antioxidant , cytotoxic , anticancer , and antimicrobial activities [ 9 ] .
naphthochalcone is a precursor to a variety of pharmaceutical agents .
naphthochalcone derivatives , which can be isolated from nature or biochemically synthesized , show various pharmaceutical effects [ 10 ] .
one of the newly synthesized naphthochalcone derivatives , 1 - ( naphtho [ 2,1 - b ] furan - 2 - yl - carbonyl ) - 3,5 - disubstituted - 2,3 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazole , has been characterized by elemental analysis and in spectral studies .
this compound has been evaluated for antimicrobial activity [ 11 ] .
the compound ( hydroxyphenyl ) naphthol sulfonamide could be useful in optimizing 17beta - hsd1 inhibitors for the treatment of endometriosis [ 12 ] .
another derivative , of methyl - 1 - hydroxy - 2 - naphthoate , may inhibit lipopolysaccharide - induced inflammatory responses in macrophages via suppression of the nf - kappab , jnk , and p38 mapk pathways [ 13 ] .
regarding structural analogues of the flavones , alpha - naphtoflavone promotes pro - collagen production in skin fibroblasts and is suggested to have anti - aging effects [ 14 ] .
recently we have screened series of compounds for promoting migration and proliferation of hacat cells and found that novel naphthochalcone derivative , 2 - ( 5 - ( 2,4,6 - trimethoxyphenyl ) - 4,5 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) naphthalen - 1 - ol ( tdpn ) ( fig. 1 ) had good activity. fig. 1 structure of - ( 5 - ( 2,4,6 - trimethoxyphenyl ) - 4,5 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) naphthalen - 1 - ol ( tdpn ) the present study was aimed to examining whether novel naphthochalcone derivative ( tdpn ) exerts any effects on process of wound healing and , if so , what are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the action of tdpn .
a murine excisional wound healing model in vivo and experiments using human keratinocyte cell line in vitro indicated tdpn accelerated wound closure by activating keratinocyte movement via inducing emt like change .
the results of this study provide novel drug candidate of cutaneous skin wound .
methods reagent the novel naphthochalcone derivative , 2 - ( 5 - ( 2,4,6 - trimethoxyphenyl ) - 4,5 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) naphthalen - 1 - ol ( tdpn ) ( fig. 1 ) , was synthesized and kindly provided by professor youngho lim ( division of bioscience and biotechnology , konkuk university , seoul , korea ) .
tdpn stock solutions were stored as aliquots at - 20 degreesc , and were diluted to the final concentration before use .
cell culture the human keratinocyte cell line hacat was cultured in rpmi medium that was supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; gibco ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( paa ) .
cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 .
scratch wound healing assay because the doubling time of hacat cells is approximately 24 h , cells were seeded at 50 % confluency in culture dishes 24 h before the wound healing scratch assay .
therefore , the experiment was performed when cells reached monolayer formation .
a scratch was made in the cell monolayer by drawing a sterile p - 200 pipette tip across the surface of the culture dish .
after the scratch was made , the culture medium was supplemented with tdpn .
dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ; amresco ) treatment was used as the control .
at 0 h and 24 h post - treatment , photographs of the cell monolayer were acquired at 4x magnification using the olympus ix70 microscope equipped with a digital camera .

the results were analyzed using the imagej software .
the relative change in the ratio of the target protein to the dmso control was determined .
mmp zymography mmp zymography was performed according to the method described by gogly et al .
[ 16 ] , with the following modification : 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) gels that contained gelatin ( 0.01 mg / ml ) were used .
the sds in the gels was removed by incubating the gels twice ( 30 min each ) in 200 ml of 2.5 % triton x - 100 at 4 degreesc .
thereafter , the gel slabs were incubated at 37 degreesc overnight in the incubation buffer .
the gels were then fixed and stained for 1 h with 0.05 % coomassie blue r - 250 .
the molecular mass protein markers were readily visible as stained bands against the lighter blue color of the stained gelatin background .
gelatinase activity was apparent as clear zones of lysis ( negative staining ) against the blue background .
the gels were scanned to create a permanent record of the results .
transwell invasion assay the transwell invasion assay was performed using a commercial transwell plate ( corning ) .
cells were harvested by trypsinization and 7x104 cells / well in 100ul of medium were seeded into the wells of the insert .
the receiving wells were set up with medium containing fbs as a chemoattractant .
after 24 h , media in insert wells was replaced by 100ul of free serum medium containing tdpn , tgf - beta1 , or dmso .
invasive cells in the receiving wells were collected by trypsinization and counted by hemacytometer .
hoechst stain proliferation assay the hoeschst stain proliferation assay was performed as previously described [ 17 ] .
200 mul of cells at a density of 3 x 104 cells / ml were seeded into the wells of 96 - well plates .
cells were treated with tdpn or dmso for 24 h. hoechst 33342 solution ( 1 mul of 10 mm stock solution ; sigma ) was added to each well and incubated for 37 degreesc for 30 min .
cell proliferation was estimated by direct measurement of changes in cell fluorescence using a spectrofluorometer ( spectrafluor , tecan ) .
the instrument was equipped with a 365 - nm broadband filter for the excitation beam and a 450 - nm narrowband interference filter plus a uv blocking filter for the emitted light ecis migration assay hacat cells were seeded at a density of 1 x 105 cells / cm2 into ecis arrays and impedance was measured using an ecis instrument .
wounding pulses of 2400 ma were applied for 20 s at 6400 khz .
media was then replaced by media containing tdpn or tgfbeta1 or dmso .
the results were exported to the ecis program .
trypan blue cell counting assay 5x104 cells / well were seeded on 24 - well plates .
after 24 h of incubation , cells were treated with tdpn or dmso in various concentrations for 24 h. all cells in each well were collected by trypsinization .
the live cells were identified and counted by trypan blue staining .
this experiment was repeated three times .
animal experiment 6 - week old male icr mice ( n = 5 for each group : control and treatment tpdn ) were chosen for the experiment .
the fur was removed with an electronic hair clipper and removal cream .
dermal wound was placed on the middle of a back using an 8 mm punch instrument .
in dermal wound site , we punch out whole dermis including subcutaneous fat layer ( deep punch ) and appendages of skin did n't preserved .
a few days later , granulation tissue and scab were formed at wound and we could confirm the epidermis and dermis were filled from surroundings of wound instead of granulation tissue .
200 mul of tdpn was applied to the wounds of the experimental group in concentrations of 200 mum ( dissolved with vaseline ) for 20 days , while the control group was treated with same amount of dmso ( dissolved with vaseline ) .
usually in vivo experiment , compounds have treated to animal approximately 100 ~ 200 times higher concentration of in vitro .
because process of the delivery and conversion of ingredients may cause lower of active material to reach to target points .
however , in this study , the compound was applied to wound site directly , therefore we only applied just 10 times concentration of tdpn compared to in vitro .
the wound was pictured every three day and the rate of wound closure was calculated as relative % of original wound area using image j program .
skin samples were collected from mice at each of the wounding time points ( 9 , 12 , 15 days post - wounded ) and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde .
we cut formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissues into 3um sections , stains all sections simultaneously by using routine hematoxylin - eosin ( h - e ) and masson 's trichrome stain methods .
the slides were reviewed by an olympus bx51 microscope ( olympus corp. , tokyo , japan ) with the apochromatic objective lens and a 0.85 numeric aperture .
results tdpn induces the migration but not the proliferation of keratinocytes re - epithelialization involves the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes .
in the present study , we investigated these two processes using the mtt assay and scratch wound healing assay for keratinocytes ( hacat cells ) treated with different concentrations of 2 - ( 5 - ( 2,4,6 - trimethoxyphenyl ) - 4,5 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) naphthalen - 1 - ol ( tdpn ) for 24 h. in the migration assay , tdnp promoted hacat cell migration dose - dependently up to 20 mum .
however , there was little difference between 10 and 20 mum ( fig. 2a ) .
it has been reported that tgf - beta can induce emt and migration of various cell types , including keratinocytes ([ 20 , 31 ] , rasanen et al. , 2010 ) .
to compare their abilities to induce migration , we performed migration assay comparing the ability of tgf and tdpn to induce migration , by both the ecis system ( fig. 2b ) and the transwell invasion assay ( fig. 2c ) .
these results demonstrated that tdpn induced migration and invasion comparably to tgf - beta in the same time period of treatment. fig. 2 tdpn effects on migration and proliferation of hacat cell line .
migration of hacat cells were measured by scratch wound assay and ecis system .
scratch wound healing assay of hacat cells treated with different concentrations of tdpn for 24 h. cells were seeded with density 3 x 104 cells / ml 24 h before scratch and treated .
distance of the scratch was measured after 24 h treated with tdpn ( a ) .
cells were subjected to ecis migration assay in the absence or the presence of tdpn or tgf - beta as indicated .
cells were allowed to grow to confluence and initial resistance was measured for few hours .
cells were subjected to high voltage to initiate wound at 3 h resulting in the drop of resistance .
remaining cells were allowed to migrate in the presence or absence of tdpn and resistance changes were measured for 24 h after the creation of wound ( b ) .
represented pictures are shown from 3 independent experiments .
invasion of tdpn treated cells were measured using transwell chambers as described in methods ( c ) .
proliferation of keratinocyte cells were measures three different methods ; mtt assay , hoechst staining , and trypan blue counting assays ( d ) .
cells were seeded for 24 h , then treated with various concentrations of tdpn or dmso for 24 h. after treatment , cells were collected and counted in trypan blue assay or incubated with hoechst 33342 or mtt reagent .
results were measured by flourescence spectrometer or spectrometer .
western blot of cell cycle - related proteins comparing cells treated with 10 mum tdpn and untreated cells .
protein lysate from cells treated with tdpn for 24 h were taken using ripa buffer .
the expression level was measured by comparing the density of the target protein to gapdh ( e ) .
(*) p < 0.05 compare to control group since migration rate may be influenced by proliferation rate , we tested cell growth. and keratinocyte proliferation was not affected by tdpn proven by three independent assays such as mtt assay , hemacytometer counting assay and in the proliferation hoechst staining assay ( fig. 2d ) .
these results also showed no significant changes between treated and untreated cells .
to confirm the results , proteins related to the cell cycle were investigated in the treated cells .
the levels of cyclin - dependent kinases e and d1 , p53 , and p21 were not significantly changed by tdpn ( fig. 2e ) .
these data suggest that tdpn induces the migration but not the proliferation of keratinocytes .
erk and akt phosphorylation is involved in promotion of keratinocyte migration by tdpn it is well - known that mitogen - activated protein ( map ) kinase family members , erks , as well as the pi3k / akt pathway , are important for the regulation of cell migration .
therefore , we investigated the expression levels of regulatory proteins related to cell migration , such as akt and erk .
keratinocytes were treated with tdpn for different time periods and protein lysates were assayed for phosphorylation of akt and erk .
we used a stock of tdpn containing approximately 0.05 % dmso .
each time point , cells treated either dmso or tdpn in dmso were collected and assayed by western blot analysis .
the relative intensity between tdpn and control group at each specific time point was calculated ( fig. 3a ) .
within 2 h erk and akt signals were activated .
these signals were increased dose - dependently at 2 h time point ( fig. 3b ) and the treatment of specific inhibitors against erk and akt attenuate tdpn induced phosphorylation ( fig. 3c ) .
to identify the tdpn induced migration of keratinocyte was mediated by erk and akt signaling , we performed a wound healing assay in which cells were pretreated with a pi3k inhibitor ( ly49002 , 50 mum ) and a mek inhibitor ( pd98059 , 50 mum ) then treated with tdpn or left untreated .
the results demonstrated that inhibiting the akt and erk pathways abolished the effects of tdpn on migration ( fig. 3d ). fig. 3 erk and akt phosphorylation is involved in promotion of keratinocyte migration by tdpn .
hacat cells were treated with either dmso or 10 mum tdpn for the indicated time ( a ) or the indicated dose for 2 h ( b ) and harvested for western blot analysis .
band intensity is presented as mean +/ - se of relative to gapdh and ratio between pakt or perk of tdpn and pakt or perk of control dmso treatment from least 3 replications .
(*) p < 0.05 compare to control group ) ( c ) cells were pre - treated with pi3k inhibitor ( ly49002 , 50 mum ,) or mek inhibitor ( pd98059 , 50 mum ,) for 24 h , then treated with tdpn for 1 h and harvested for western blot analysis , to assess the involvement of the erk and akt signaling pathways .
( d ) after co - treatment of tdpn and pi3k inhibitor ( ly49002 , 50 mum ) or mek inhibitor ( pd98059 , 50 mum ) for 24 h , scratch wound healing assay were performed .
distance of the scratch was measured relative to control after 24 h of treatment with tdpn .
(*) p < 0.05 ) tdpn induces emt - like change it has been reported that emt occurs in keratinocytes at wound sites during the re - epithelialization stage [ 18 , 19 ] .
thus , we investigated whether tdpn promotes re - epithelialization through emt .
we treated tgf - beta1 ( 10 ng / ml ) and tdpn for 24 h and observed morphological and biochemical changes .
on above condition , morphological changes were not dramatic ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
it has been reported that tgf - beta induces invasion and changes the cell size of several cell types including epithelial cells and keratinocytes [ 20 - 22 ] .
however , morphological change of keratinocytes by tgf - beta on in vitro varies depending on cell types .
hacat cells treated with tgf - beta1 for 24 h only form actin stress fibers but morphology does not change [ 23 ] .
however , in cellular level , main emt markers such as epithelial marker proteins zo - 1 and e - cadherin , and mesenchymal marker , transcriptional factor slug changed ( fig. 4a ) .
western blot results revealed that tdpn treatment increased slug expression and decreased the e - cadherin and zo - 1 in a time - dependent manner ( fig. 4a ) and dose - dependent manner ( fig. 4b ) .
this suggests that tdpn treatment causes the loss of cell - cell adhesion .
in addition , the level of the mesenchymal marker fibronectin was slightly increased ( fig. 4d ). fig. 4 tdpn induces emt like change .
hacat cells were treated with tdpn ( 10 mum ) for the indicated time ( a ) or at the indicated dose ( b ) and harvested for western blot analysis .
( data presented as mean of relative to gapdh +/ - se from least 3 replications , (*) p < 0.05 compare to control group ) .
( c ) hacat cells treated with 10 mum tdpn for 24 h. after treatment , the conditioned media from the cells was concentrated using amicon centrifugation .
protein in media was collected and analysed by western blot for collagen i , collagen iii , fibronectin , and mmp1 .
( d ) transcriptional expression of mmps in hacat cells treated with tdpn ( 10 mum for 24 h ) .
after treatment , total rna from each cells was taken by trizol reagent and analysed by rt - pcr for mmp1 , mmp2 , mmp7 .
gapdh was used as a control .
( data presented as mean of relative to gapdh +/ - se from least 3 replications , (*) p < 0.05 compare to control group ) in both emt tumors and migrating keratinocytes , degradation and remodeling of the ecm are needed .
the emt pathway has been reported to involve mmp expression [ 4 ] .
in the present study , zymography revealed that the levels of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 were not changed by tdpn treatment ( additional file 2 : figure s2 ) .
however , the western blot results for tdpn - treated cells showed that the mmp - 1 protein level was significantly increased ( fig. 4c ) .
the transcriptional expression pattern showed a similar result ( fig. 4d ) .
tdpn accelerated dermal wound healing full - thickness excisional wound were made on the dorsal of mice and tdpn or vaseline were applied to wound site topically every day .
hereby , we investigated the effects of tdpn on skin remodeling phase .
it could affect scar formation and faster resolving collagen deposit .
tdpn treated mice exhibited a faster wound closure then muck treated animals as early as day 9 ( fig. 5a ) .
the average of opened wound area were measured by image program and the rate of closure of tdpn treated was 3 day faster than untreated ones ( fig. 5b ) .
tissue samples were taken at day 9 , 12 and 15 post - wounded and performed h & e staining .
on day 9 , tdpn treated wound revealed that epidermal closure is complete but dermal closure is not sufficient to have open area ( yellow arrow ) and inflammation and necrosis is still remain in outer skin ( fig. 6a ) .
whereas muck treated wound showed that necrosis and inflammation accompanied in wound site and epidermal leading edge is observed ( black arrow ) but epidermal closure is not complete .
the granulation tissue formation in dermis is incomplete and dermal closure is ongoing ( fig. 6b ) .
on day 12 , in tdpn treated wound , epidermal and dermal closure is complete and hair follicle start to show but not yet start differentiation .
contraction of granulation tissue squeezes hair follicle to wound direction ( fig. 6c ) .
in muck treated wound , granulation tissue formation is processed and dermal closure is complete , however , the proliferation of epidermis is not sufficient and the epidermal closure is incomplete ( fig. 6d ) .
on day 15 , in tdpn wound , epidermal and dermal closure is complete perfectly and glands differentiation is processing throughout the wound site ( fig. 6e ) .
day 15 muck treated wound still have no sign of a nodule that resembled early sweat or sebaceous glands ( fig. 6f ) .
collagen deposits were stained by masson trichrome ( fig. 6g - j ) .
in tdpn treated animal , until day 12 collagen deposition is still ongoing and distribution of collagen fiber is uneven ( fig. 6g ) however on day 15 , collagen density is high and evenly distributed as normal dermis ( fig. 6h ) .
in muck treated wound , the collagen deposit did not show much difference compared to tdpn treated ( fig. 6i - j ) .
results suggested accelerated wound closure may attributed by faster epidermis differentiation. fig. 5 wound closure after a full - thickness dermal excision .
male icr mice ( 6 weeks of age ) underwent a full - thickness 8 mm excisional wounding .
they were either muck treated or treated with cutaneous application of tdpn ( 200 mum ) daily .
the wound closure was pictured every three day ( a ) .
the averages of opened wound area were measured by image program and plotted as relative % of original wound ( b ) .
the values were expressed as means +/ - se from 6 wounds in each group till day 9 , 4 wounds at day12 and 2 wounds at day 15 fig. 6 histological findings of dermal wound tissues during the healing process .
dermal specimens were obtained from icr mice either tdpn treated ( a , c and e ) or muck treated ( b , d , and f ) as in fig. 5 , at day 9 ( a and b ) , day 12 ( c and d ) or day 15 ( e and f ) .
they were subjected to h - e staining ( a - f ) or masson trichrome staining ( g - j ) .
yellow arrow indicated open area .
black arrow indicated epidermal leading edge .
represented pictures are shown from 2 wounds in each group at each day tdpn promote epidermis development via keratinocyte activation we performed ki - 67 antibody staining for detect proliferation ( fig. 7 ) .
in both case , the day 9 show highest proliferation index ( fig. 7a - f ) .
in the tdpn group at day 12 and muck treated group at day 15 , cells located at the bilayer of epidermis ( yellow arrow ) show strong reaction as seen in normal epidermis ( fig. 7b,f ) .
however , on day 15 , tdpn treated group show high proliferation not only epidermal bilayer but also around nodules that resembled early sweat or sebaceous glands ( fig. 7c ) .
these results suggested that tdpn mainly activated epidermal keratinocyte rather than dermal fibroblast. fig. 7 proliferation of dermal wound tissues during the healing process .
dermal specimens were obtained from icr mice either tdpn treated ( a , c and e ) or muck treated ( b , d , and f ) as in fig. 5 , at day 9 ( a and b ) , day 12 ( c and d ) or day 15 ( e and f ) .
proliferation of cell in wound site was measured by ki - 67 antibody staining .
represented pictures are shown from 2 wounds in each group at each day discussion our results reveal that the novel naphthochalcone derivative tdpn show faster wound closure and matrix remodeling ( figs. 5 and 6 ) via promoting the migration but not the proliferation of keratinocytes ( fig. 2 ) .
importantly , we observed promotion of the emt pathway in the tdpn - treated cells .
the expression levels of the adherence junction protein e - cadherin and tight junction protein zo - 1 were reduced in the cells treated with tdpn .
also , the expression levels of the transcriptional factor slug , as well as those of the mesenchymal marker fibronectin were induced in these cells ( fig. 4 ) .
furthermore , the erk and akt signaling pathways were found to be involved in tdpn induction of emt , as evidenced by the induction of phosphorylation of erk and akt which was confirmed by pretreatment akt inhibitor ( ly49002 , 50 mum ) or erk inhibitor ( pd98059 , 50 mum ) attenuated effect of tdpn ( fig. 3 ) .
as a consequence of the emt , mmp - 1 ( but not mmp - 2 or mmp - 9 ) was found to be significantly induced .
following the induction of mmp - 1 in the tdpn - treated cells , the ecm proteins collagen i and collagen iii were significantly degraded .
the tdpn mainly stimulate keratinocyte not fibroblast .
keratinocyte migration , a part of cell proliferation stage , plays an important role during the wound healing [ 24 ] .
several approaches have been used to study new compounds and new pathways that promote migration and wound healing [ 25 , 26 ] .
for example , protection effects of green tea extract ( egcg ) against uv were found to be involved in the proliferation of normal human keratinocytes [ 27 ] .
egcg - induced erk phosphorylation and activation of the akt pathway was found to promote keratinocyte survival [ 28 ] .
however , in our study , tdpn showed effects on the migration but not on the proliferation of keratinocytes .
vpa cutaneous wound healing by increasing the motility of hacat keratinocytes through erk and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3 - kinase )/ akt signaling pathways [ 28 ] .
the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is one of the major factors that affect cell migration associated with wound healing and tissue regeneration [ 18 , 19 ] .
loss of cell junctions is considered to be a crucial marker for emt [ 17 ] .
extensive previous studies have focused on how tight junctions are down - regulated in emt [ 29 , 30 , 5 ] .
in addition , during the early stage of re - epithelialization , when cells undergo emt , reduced cell - cell contacts allow the cells to migrate .
emt down - regulation of the cell junction protein e - cadherin appears to involve regulation by wnt or tgf - beta via inducible activation of kinase pathways that modulate gtpase , smads , pi3ks , map kinases , beta - catenin , and activate transcription factors , including lef - 1 , snail , slug , and scatter , ultimately leading to repression of the e - cadherin gene [ 31 ] .
apart from the loss of cell junctions , the increased expression levels of slug and mesenchymal marker act as a marker for emt [ 19 , 32 ] .
slug , a key transcription factor is responsible for the down - regulation of e - cadherin in both explanted human skin and primary keratinocytes [ 33 ] .
the cell migration is regulated by various signaling pathways .
the mapk signaling pathways are associated with cell migration [ 34 ] , as well as the emt pathway [ 35 , 36 ] , and the pi3k / akt signaling pathway has also been implicated in cell migration [ 6 , 37 ] and emt [ 38 ] .
tdpn induced phosphorylation of erk and akt in time - and dose - dependent manners ( fig. 3 ) .
a previous report showed that transforming acidic coiled - coil protein 3 ( tacc3 ) induced emt and migration through induction of the akt and erk pathways [ 37 ] .
furthermore , it has been reported that inhibition of the erk and akt pathways leads to inhibition of the induction of emt by tgf - beta1 [ 39 ] .
our results revealed that the phosphorylation of signaling pathway proteins akt and erk were induced early in tdpn treatment , while changes of emt markers such as slug e - cadherin detected later .
we suggest that tdpn triggers early signals in the emt pathway ( figs. 3 and 4 ) .
matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , which are extracellular proteases that are highly expressed at wound sites , degrade specific components of the ecm , thereby providing new substrates that facilitate migration and invasion [ 40 ] .
the relationships between emt and mmps have been described .
mmp expression is considered to be one of the major attributes acquired by epithelial cells after emt [ 4 ] .
mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 have been reported to play essential roles in the emt in the avian embryo [ 41 , 42 ] .
interestingly , our enzymatic activity results do not accord with the results in the previous report , in that the levels of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 were not changed in our treated cells .
however , mmp - 1 ( type i collagenase ) is needed in the epidermis for re - epithelialization [ 40 ] .
in human oral keratinocytes , mmp - 1 mrna was expressed while the keratinocytes covered the wound surface [ 43 ] .
in agreement with those results , mmp - 1 was induced in the tdpn - treated cells in the our study ( fig. 4 ) .
in vitro keratinocyte culture , collagen i and collagen iii were significantly degraded in the tdpn treatment group .
given that mmp - 1 is a collagenase , its induction would lead to the degradation of the collagen helping keratinocyte migration at the margin of dermis .
conclusion the finding of novel compound - tdpn - to promote wound healing via keratinocyte migration supplies a good tool for studying wound healing mechanism and possible drug candidate .

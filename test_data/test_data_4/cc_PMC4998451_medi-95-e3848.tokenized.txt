http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 supplemental digital content is available in the text abstract we aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis ( ivt ) with alteplase for anterior circulation stroke ( acs ) and posterior circulation stroke ( pcs ). from a large multicenter prospective registry - - the thrombolysis implementation and monitor of acute ischemic stroke in china database - - all patients who received ivt within 4.5 hours after stroke onset was reviewed .
according to the clinical presentations and imaging findings , the eligible patients were divided into acs and pcs groups .
the safety and efficacy outcome measures included post - ivt symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sich ) , parenchymal hematoma , and all intracranial hemorrhage ( aich ) within 7 days , mortality within 90 days , excellent recovery ( modified rankin scale 0 - 1 ) , and functional independence ( modified rankin scale 0 - 2 ) at 90 days .
for comparing the outcomes between both groups , the odds ratios ( ors ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) and the adjusted ors with 95 % cis were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. of 953 patients enrolled , 829 patients had acs and 124 had pcs .
the patients with pcs had less often atrial fibrillation ( 11.3 % vs 19.8 % ; p = 0.02 ) , higher blood glucose level ( 8.31 vs 7.63 mmol / l ; p = 0.02 ) , and more white blood cell counts ( 8.79 vs 7.75 x 109 / l ; p = 0.001 ) than those with acs .
after adjustment for the potential confounders , multivariate logistic analysis showed that pcs patients had not only lower rates of sich ( 3.2 % vs 7.7 % ; or 0.28 , 95 % ci 0.09 - 0.90 ) , parenchymal hematoma ( 1.6 % vs 9.2 % ; or 0.13 , 95 % ci 0.03 - 0.57 ) , and aich ( 8.1 % vs 20.4 % ; or 0.26 , 95 % ci 0.12 - 0.54 ) , but also higher proportions of excellent recovery ( 55.7 % vs 41.6 % ; or 2.27 , 95 % ci 1.42 - 3.61 ) and functional independence ( 63.9 % vs 53.0 % ; or 2.33 , 95 % ci 1.40 - 3.89 ) compared with acs patients .
however , there was no significant difference in the occurrence of mortality ( or 0.86 , 95 % ci 0.39 - 1.91 ) between both groups in the multivariate model , although more pcs patients seemed to die within 90 days than did acs patients ( 15.6 % vs 10.1 % ; or 1.64 , 95 % ci 0.96 - 2.82 ) in the univariate analysis .
our study suggests that ivt with alteplase is more safe and effective for pcs .
keywords acute ischemic stroke anterior circulation intravenous thrombolysis outcome posterior circulation open - accesstrue 1 introduction intravenous thrombolysis ( ivt ) with alteplase is still the first - line therapy for all kinds of acute ischemic stroke ( ais ) including anterior circulation stroke ( acs ) and posterior circulation stroke ( pcs ),[ 1 - 3 ] although endovascular treatment recently has achieved the recommendation of class i for carefully selected patients with acs. [ 4 ] in the past 2 decades , several randomized controlled trials and real world registries have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase for ais within 4.5 hours time window. [ 5 - 8 ] unfortunately , reports on using ivt for pcs are lacking .
for example : national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ( ninds ) trial had few pcs patients ( 5 %);[ 5 ] european cooperative acute stroke study ( ecass ) i and ii only included the patients with acs , excluding those with pcs ;[ 9,10 ] ecass iii did not refer to the number of pcs patients if any was enrolled ;[ 7 ] safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke ( sits ) was the largest stroke thrombolysis registry in the world , but also did not differentiate the sites of infarction. [ 6,8 ] pcs was often overlooked in the previous clinical studies partly because of its low incidence .
to be specific , pcs only accounted for 17 % to 22 % of all ais in chinese hospital - based population. [ 11,12 ] on the other hand , stroke physicians do not care whether a patient had acs or pcs at the clinical scene , and thereby pcs is often treated similarly to acs ,[ 13 ] but results of anterior circulation trials do not necessarily apply to pcs .
to determine whether there is any difference in the post - ivt outcomes between acs and pcs , we analyzed the data from a large multicenter prospective registry - - the thrombolysis implementation and monitor of acute ischemic stroke in china ( tims - china ) .
2 methods 2.1 study population the tims - china was a national prospective stroke registry of thrombolytic therapy for patients with ais in 67 major stroke centers in china. [ 14 ] the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of beijing tiantan hospital .
the registry was regularly monitored independently by the quality monitoring committee of tims - china and the contract research organization .
all patients or patients' care providers were given written informed consents before thrombolysis , and all patients received the alteplase dose of 0.5 to 0.9 mg / kg , with 10 % of the total dose given within 1 minute followed by the remainder infused over 60 minutes .
the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score was measured at baseline , 2 hours , 24 hours , 7 days ( or at discharge , whichever occurs first ) , and any time of neurological deterioration .
the modified rankin scale ( mrs ) score was assessed at 7 days ( or at discharge , whichever occurs first ) and 90 days .
only the neurologists who were trained and qualified for using nihss and mrs recorded the scores .
brain imaging ( computed tomography [ ct ] and magnetic resonance ) was performed at baseline , 24 hours , and 7 days ( or at discharge , whichever occurs first ) , but magnetic resonance examination was optional .
the imaging findings were interpreted by at least 2 experienced senior radiologists in each participating hospital. from the tims - china database , all patients who received ivt within 4.5 hours time window were screened for this analysis .
based on the clinical presentations and imaging findings , the patients were divided into acs or pcs group .
acs was defined as acute infarctions involving the territories of internal carotid artery , middle cerebral artery , or anterior cerebral artery .
pcs was defined as acute infarctions involving the territories of vertebral artery , basilar artery , or posterior cerebral artery .
the patients with unclear stroke territory and acute infarctions in both circulation territories were excluded .
2.2 safety and efficacy outcomes the safety outcomes included post - ivt symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sich ) , parenchymal hematoma ( ph ) , and all intracranial hemorrhage ( aich ) within 7 days , and mortality within 90 days .
sich was evaluated by using the ninds definition , which was defined as hemorrhage that was not seen on a previous ct scan , and there was subsequently either a suspicion of hemorrhage or any decline in neurological status. [ 5 ] parenchymal hematoma ( ph ) was defined as a hemorrhage with mass effect : ph1 , blood clots not exceeding 30 % of the infarcted area with slight space - occupying effect ; ph2 , blood clots exceeding 30 % of the infracted area with substantial space - occupying effect. [ 10 ] aich was verified by the follow - up imaging regardless of clinical deterioration .
the efficacy outcomes included excellent recovery and functional independence at 90 days .
excellent recovery was defined as having a mrs score of 0 to 1 , and functional independence was defined as having a mrs score of 0 to 2. [ 8 ] 2.3 statistical analysis the baseline data were compared between acs and pcs groups .
the t test or the mann - whitney u test was used to compare means or medians for continuous variables .
the pearson chi - square test or continuity correction was used to compare the proportions for categorical variables .
for comparing the post - ivt outcomes between both groups , odds ratios ( ors ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) and the adjusted ors with 95 % cis were calculated by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models .
the stroke territory ( acs or pcs ) was forced in both models as an independent variable .
age , sex , baseline nihss score , and the baseline variables showing possible associations with the outcomes in the univariate analysis ( p < 0.05 ) were entered in the multivariate model as confounding factors .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
all analyses were performed with sas statistical software ( version 9.3 , sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
3 results between may 2007 and april 2012 , 1440 patients with ais and received ivt with alteplase were registered in the tims - china database .
because of delayed treatment (> 4.5 hours ) and unclear onset - to - thrombolysis time , 312 patients were excluded .
another 165 patients with unclear stroke territory and 10 patients with acute infarctions in both anterior and posterior circulation territories were excluded .
finally , 953 eligible patients were entered into the analysis in this study , which included 829 patients in the acs group and 124 in the pcs group ( fig. 1 ) .
figure 1 flow chart of eligible patients .
baseline characteristics of the eligible patients in this study ( n = 953 ) were compared with those of the patients excluded from this study because of unclear stroke territory ( n = 165 ) .
no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics were identified between the 2 groups , except for hypertension , baseline nihss score , and ischemic stroke subtypes .
more details are shown in table s1 .
tims - china = thrombolysis implementation and monitor of acute ischemic stroke in china .
3.1 baseline characteristics the pcs group had less atrial fibrillation ( 11.3 % vs 19.8 % ; p = 0.02 ) , but higher blood glucose level ( mean 8.31 vs 7.63 mmol / l ; p = 0.02 ) and elevated white blood cell counts ( mean 8.79 vs 7.75 x 109 / l ; p = 0.001 ) than the acs group .
whereas other baseline variables , including age , nihss score , onset - to - thrombolysis time , and so on , did not have significant differences between the 2 groups ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .
table 1 baseline characteristics of acs and pcs patients .
3.2 safety and efficacy outcomes twenty patients ( 2.1 %) were lost to follow - up ( 18 cases with acs and 2 with pcs ) at 90 days .
the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pcs patients had less events of sich ( 3.2 % vs 7.7 % ; or 0.28 , 95 % ci 0.09 - 0.90 , p = 0.03 ) , ph ( 1.6 % vs 9.2 % ; or 0.13 , 95 % ci 0.03 - 0.57 , p = 0.01 ) , and aich ( 8.1 % vs 20.4 % ; or 0.26 , 95 % ci 0.12 - 0.54 , p < 0.001 ) than acs patients .
in addition , the odds of having both excellent recovery ( 55.7 % vs 41.6 % ; or 2.27 , 95 % ci 1.42 - 3.61 , p = 0.001 ) and functional independence ( 63.9 % vs 53.0 % ; or 2.33 , 95 % ci 1.40 - 3.89 , p = 0.001 ) were approximately 1.3 times more in the pcs group than in the acs group .
however , there was no significant difference in the rate of mortality ( or 0.86 , 95 % ci 0.39 - 1.91 , p = 0.72 ) between the 2 groups after adjusting the prespecified confounders , although pcs patients were more likely to decease within 90 days than acs patients ( 15.6 % vs 10.1 % ; or 1.64 , 95 % ci 0.96 - 2.82 , p = 0.07 ) in the univariate analysis ( table 2 and fig. 2 ) .

4 discussion the results of this study ran parallel to the previous studies which reported that pcs was associated with a lower risk of hemorrhagic transformations. [ 15 - 18 ] older age , hyperglycemia , and high nihss score are related to poor outcome of post - ivt in all parameters ( intracranial hemorrhage , mortality , and independence ) .
high systolic blood pressure and atrial fibrillation are additional predictors of intracranial hemorrhage. [ 19 ] in this study , the age , baseline nihss score , and systolic blood pressure were similar between acs and pcs groups .
blood glucose level was higher in the pcs group , whereas atrial fibrillation was less frequent in the pcs patients , potentially affecting the incidence of hemorrhagic transformations in favor of acs patients .
because the infarction volume on baseline imaging could predict the risk of post - ivt intracranial hemorrhage ,[ 20,21 ] the smaller infarction volume in pcs compared with acs might also contribute to the lower rate of hemorrhagic transformations in pcs patients. [ 22 ] in addition , the collateral supply in posterior circulation territory might be better than that of anterior circulation. [ 23 ] patients with better collaterals were not prone to having hemorrhagic complications after acute reperfusion therapy. [ 24,25 ] moreover , the brain histopathological changes after stroke onset may be different between both circulation territories .
previous studies have suggested a delayed blood - brain barrier disruption in posterior circulation compared with anterior circulation. [ 26,27 ] the greater ischemic tolerance in posterior circulation may partly explain the decreased risk of hemorrhagic complications in pcs. [ 28 ] inconsistent with previous studies ,[ 16,29 - 31 ] our results showed that pcs patients had better responses to alteplase and thereby they had higher odds of excellent recovery and functional independence at 90 days than acs patients .
possible reasons are as follows : the most devastating stroke - - basilar artery occlusion - - is seldom seen , only accounting for 8 % of pcs. [ 32 ] often pcs locates in the cerebellum , hippocampus , or occipital lobe , whereas the brain stem or thalamus is spared .
these patients with vertigo , ataxia , impaired vision , cognitive decline , or mental disorder may not have obvious neurological deficits after medical treatment and rehabilitation. [ 33 ] on the other hand , because pcs patients had less often hemorrhagic complications in this cohort , they were more likely to be treated by antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants after ivt without fear of bleeding expansion .
the subsequent antithrombotic therapies could consolidate the thrombolytic effect and have a positive impact on the outcome .
our study had several limitations .
firstly , the design of this study is prospective observational cohort by nature .
we presented adjusted or as final results in multivariate logistic regression analyses .
however , the confounding factors may not be completely removed by using the multivariate model .
in addition , there may be some hidden confounders ( e.g. , volume of infarction and collateral circulation ) we did not collect in this study .
we should be careful to interpret the results .
secondly , the sample size was relatively small , especially in the pcs group , which could have reduced the power of test .
thirdly , we had no information about fetal origin of posterior cerebral artery .
these patients could have a stroke from the anterior circulation. and finally , this study was conducted in chinese population .
however , ethnic differences may have an impact on the outcomes observed in this analysis .
our findings should be interpreted with caution and could not easily be extrapolated to other populations .
to the best of our knowledge , this was the first multicenter observational study comparing the safety and efficacy of ivt for acs and pcs in chinese population .
our study suggested that pcs patients treated with ivt had a lower risk of developing hemorrhagic transformation within 7 days and better chance of having no major disability at 90 days than acs patients .
in short , ivt might be more safe and effective for pcs .
our results will provide reassurance to the clinicians in using intravenous alteplase to treat all kinds of stroke patients with confidence , including those with pcs .

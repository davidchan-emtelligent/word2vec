background dysferlin is reduced in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2b , miyoshi myopathy , distal anterior compartment myopathy , and in certain ethnic clusters .
methods we evaluated clinical and genetic patient data from three different swiss neuromuscular centers .
results thirteen patients from 6 non - related families were included .
age of onset was 18.8 +/ - 4.3 years .
in all patients , diallelic disease - causing mutations were identified in the dysf gene .
nine patients from 3 non - related families from central switzerland carried the identical homozygous mutation , c.3031 + 2t > c. a possible founder effect was confirmed by haplotype analysis .
three patients from two different families carried the heterozygous mutation , c.1064 _ 1065delaa .
two novel mutations were identified ( c.2869c > t ( p.gln957stop ) , c.5928g > a ( p.trp1976stop )) .
conclusions our study confirms the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with dysf mutations .
two mutations ( c.3031 + 2t > c , c.1064 _ 1065delaa ) appear common in switzerland .
haplotype analysis performed on one case ( c. 3031 + 2t > c ) suggested a possible founder effect .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background dysferlin ( dysf ) is a transmembrane protein linked to sarcolemmal repair mechanisms .
autosomal recessive mutations in the dysf gene cause muscular dystrophies ( md ) : a limb girdle md , the so - called lgmd 2b , with onset in the proximal lower limbs [ 1 ] , and two distal md , one initially affecting the gastrocnemius muscle during early adulthood , miyoshi myopathy ( mm ) [ 2 ] , and the other involving muscles of the anterior compartment ( dmat ) [ 3 ] .
disease severity ranges from asymptomatic mutation carriers with elevated serum ck levels [ 4 ] and exercise intolerance [ 5 ] to severe functional disability [ 6 ] .
muscle weakness with pelvic girdle involvement on clinical examination distinguishes lgmd from mm. other common phenotypes include a " proximo - distal " phenotype , characterized by simultaneous distal and proximal weakness onset [ 6 ]. of note , a recent mri study suggests that all patients have radiographic evidence of proximo - distal muscle involvement , regardless of the clinical phenotype [ 7 ] .
the dysf gene maps to chromosome 2p12 - p14 , contains 55 exons and is transcribed as an 8.5 kb major transcript mainly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles .
the protein product is a 230 kda molecule involved in muscle fibre repair [ 8 , 9 ] .
more than 400 dysf mutations have been described in the leiden muscular dystrophy database ( http :// www.dmd.nl ) ; however , a mutational hot spot has not been detected [ 10 - 12 ] .
ethnic clusters have been described in jews from libya [ 13 ] and the caucasus region [ 14 ] , as well as in the italian [ 15 ] and spanish [ 16 ] populations .
four mutations account for 60 % of all mutations in japanese patients with mm [ 17 ] .
interestingly , the type of mutation does not correlate with phenotypic features .
in fact , the same mutation has been found to be associated with a broad spectrum of inter - - and intra - familial clinical phenotypes [ 18 - 22 ] .
within this range of clinical and genetic heterogeneity , we sought to determine frequently encountered dysf gene mutations and phenotypes in the swiss population and to uncover possible founder effects .
methods subjects the medical records of patients of swiss origin with progressive muscle weakness , and dysf mutations , who were admitted to neuromuscular centres in basel , lausanne and zurich between 1989 and 2015 were anonymized and reviewed .
all patients provided their written informed consent for genetic analysis .
clinical data collected included age and symptoms at onset , disease duration , family pedigrees , and muscle strength according to the medical research council ( mrc ) scale .
in addition , ck levels , muscle biopsy and mutational analysis results were evaluated .
electromyography , electrocardiography , echocardiography , pulmonary function and muscle mri data were reviewed when available .
the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee ( kantonale ethikkommission zurich , kek - zh - nr. 2015 - 0036 ) .
genetic analysis sequence analysis was performed using bidirectional fluorescent sequencing of all 55 exons of the dysf gene , either in the service de cardiologie , hopital cochin chu paris , france , or at the institute of human genetics , university of wurzburg , germany ( reference sequence : nm _ 003494.3 ) .
multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification ( mlpa ) was used in one case .
to evaluate the hypothesis that the dysf mutation c.3031 + 2t > c is due to a founder effect , we performed haplotype analysis , as described previously , with 6 polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 2p13.2 flanking the dysf gene ( d2s327 , d2s2113 , d2s292 , d2s291 , d21s2110 and d2s2111 ) [ 23 ] .
results clinical data thirteen patients were included in the study. of those , 9 patients were from three non - related families from central switzerland ( canton of schwyz ) .
the clinical data of 10 patients from 6 different families are summarized in tables 1 and 2 .
three patients from central switzerland ( c - 6 , d - 10 , d - 11 ) provided blood for haplotype analysis but refused clinical evaluation .
consanguinity was not reported and the parents of all patients were healthy .
mean disease onset was in late adolescence or early adulthood ( 18.7 +/ - 4.5 years ) .
early manifestations ( table 1 ) included leg pain , steppage gait , gowers' sign and difficulty running and jumping .
mean ck levels were 12500 +/ - 14400 iu / l ( range 2200 - 46350 , normal value for our laboratory < 167 u / l , table 1 ) .

in all patients , the facial muscles were spared .
four of the patients from central switzerland ( c - 4 , c - 5 , c - 7 , f - 13 ) presented without arm weakness a few years after the onset of symptoms ( table 2 ) .
all patients had distal lower limb flexor weakness and 2 ( c - 7 , f - 13 ) also showed distal lower limb extensor weakness .
three ( c - 4 , c - 5 , c - 7 ) patients had proximal lower limb weakness and therefore were classified as the " proximo - distal " ( pd ) phenotype [ 6 ] .
another patient ( f - 13 ) demonstrated isolated distal lower limb weakness ( foot flexion > extension ) and was classified as the mm phenotype .
three patients ( c - 4 , c - 5 and c - 7 ) were followed for 11 , 9 and 4 years , respectively ( table 2 ) .
all developed distal upper limb extensor weakness with 2 ( dc - 4 , c - 7 ) additionally showing distal upper limb flexor and proximal upper limb weakness .
two patients from central switzerland ( c - 8 , d - 9 ) were examined 20 and 28 years after onset and demonstrated proximal and distal upper and lower limb flexor and extensor weakness ( table 2 ) .
patient d - 9 experienced a relatively " benign " course with muscle strength grade of at least 3 on the mrc scale ( table 2 ) .
one patient from the canton thurgau ( e - 12 ) presented 7 years after onset with proximal and distal lower limb flexor and extensor weakness , eventually developing distal flexor and extensor and proximal upper limb weakness ( table 2 ) .
a patient from the canton aargau ( b - 3 ) presented with severe distal lower limb flexor , proximal lower limb flexor and extensor , distal upper limb flexor and extensor and proximal upper limb weakness 15 years after onset .
two patients from the canton fribourg were initially examined 23 ( a - 1 ) and 17 ( a - 2 ) years after onset , respectively .
patient a - 1 had generalized weakness , pronounced in the distal lower limb extensors , and over the course of 9 years developed proximal lower and upper limb palsies .
patient a - 2 had generalized weakness , more pronounced in the distal lower limb flexors , that progressive minimally over 7 years .
interestingly , members of family c presented with a proximo - distal phenotype early in the course and members of family c and patient f - 13 were notable for the lack of upper limb weakness during the early phases of the disease .
later in the course , all patients manifested a typical lgmd phenotype ; however , the distribution of weakness was heterogeneous ( table 2 ) .
the dmat phenotype was not observed in our cohort .
the use of mobility aids showed the following timeline : 2 patients required canes for walking assistance ( a - 1 , a - 2 ) at the age of 35 and 49 years , respectively ( disease duration until first use of canes 12 and 21 years , respectively ) , and both were eventually wheelchair - bound ( 17 and 24 years after disease onset ; 5 and 3 years after first cane use ) .
patient b - 3 , at age 29 , 14 years after disease onset , used a wheelchair intermittently ( b - 3 ) , and patient c - 8 was wheelchair - bound , at age 43 , 27 years after disease onset .
cardiac , pulmonary , mri and emg data electrocardiography and ecg were normal in all 9 patients who underwent examination , the longest disease duration being 35 years ( table 1 ) .
pulmonary function was normal in 6 out of 7 patients , with restrictive lung disease documented in patient a - 1 ( table 1 ; initial pulmonary function testing performed after 29 years of disease duration ) .
in 3 patients , muscle mri showed fatty replacement of the lower limb muscles .
in all three patients ( a - 2 , e - 12 and f - 13 ) , the short head of the biceps femoris and the sartorius and the gracilis muscles were symmetrically spared or appeared less affected than other muscles .
in patients e - 12 and f - 13 , the semitendinosus , the tibialis anterior and the extensor digitorum longus muscles also seemed less affected , while edema was suspected in selected lower limb muscles .
in another patient ( c - 7 ) , the pelvic and the lower limb muscles appeared normal .
emg was myopathic with short and small potentials in all 8 patients examined , with spontaneous activity found in 5 cases ( table 1 ) .
pathological features and protein studies a total of 5 surgical muscle biopsies were available ( table 3 ) for evaluation .
in 2 patients , biopsies were not available because they were taken in 1986 and 1977 .
in 6 patients , the genetic diagnosis was made without prior biopsy .
the mean age at biopsy was 28.25 +/ - 13.7 years , while the mean disease duration at biopsy was 8.3 +/ - 9.8 years .
samples were removed from the trapezius , quadriceps and gracilis muscles .
all patients exhibited dystrophic changes with an increased spectrum of myofiber diameter and variable fibrosis .
in one case with a lgmd phenotype ( b - 3 ) , striking inflammatory changes were observed within the endomysium .
western blots ( wb ) and / or immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) were performed in 6 samples ( wb only in 2 samples , ihc only in 3 samples , wb and ihc in a single sample ) .
on wb , dysferlin was totally absent in all samples tested , whereas by ihc , dysferlin was judged absent in 2 cases and reduced in two .

in 13 patients , 2 disease - causing mutations on separate alleles were identified .
nine patients from 3 non - related families from central switzerland ( canton schwyz ) carried the identical splice site mutation , c.3031 + 2t > c , 7 were homozygous ( table 4 ) .
three patients from 2 different families from the cantons of fribourg and aargau carried a heterozygous frameshift mutation c.1064 _ 1065delaa , and 2 members from family a , harbored the heterozygous nonsense mutation c.2217c > a ( table 4 ) .

novel mutations appear in bold ; ex exon , ivs intervening sequence two novel mutations were identified in this patient set .
patient c - 6 , who was compound heterozygous for the c.3031 + 2t > c mutation on one allele , showed a novel mutation , c.2869c > t on the other allele .
patient e - 12 carried the novel homozygous c.5928g > a mutation .
haplotype analyses using markers flanking the dysf gene revealed homozygosity for at least one nearest marker ( d2s291 ) in all patients from the two apparently unrelated c and d families carrying the homozygous c.3031 + 2t > c mutation , suggesting a possible founder mutation ( see fig. 1 ) .
in patient c - 7 , carrying a compound heterozygous dysf mutation ( c.3031 + 2 t > c and c.2869c > t ) , marker d2s291 shows a heterozygous genotype ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 haplotype analysis .
haplotype analysis using six microsatellite markers flanking the dysf gene in families c and d. the dysf gene is located between markers d2s292 and d2s291 .
in all patients carrying the homozygous c.3031 + 2t > c mutation , the adjacent marker d2s291 also shows a homozygous genotype ( allele 178 ) suggesting that this mutation may be a founder mutation in these two families .
accordingly , in patient c - 6 carrying a compound heterozygous dysf mutation ( c.3031 + 2t > c and c.2869c > t ) , the marker d2s291 shows a heterozygous genotype ( 278 - 290 ) discussion evaluation of the present cohort of 6 families brings new genetic information about dysferlinopathy in switzerland , and novel data regarding a potential founder effect in central switzerland .
the fact that unrelated families with identical mutations come from the same region indicates that these mutations are common , and indeed , haplotype analysis of 2 families carrying the mutation c.3031 + 2t > c suggests a possible founder effect for this mutation in switzerland .
the limitations of this study are twofold : the analysis is limited by the small cohort size and 3 out of 13 patients had not been examined clinically. from a clinical point of view , the onset age in early adulthood confirms previous findings [ 6 , 7 , 24 ] .
in addition , late - onset [ 25 ] or congenital forms were not encountered [ 26 ] .
three out of 4 patients from central switzerland presented with the pd phenotype , while another patient with the same mutation was considered to represent the mm phenotype .
upper limb weakness was not a presenting feature in the current cohort .
some reports suggest that the proximo - distal phenotype occurs in up to one third of dysferlinopathy cases [ 6 ]. of note , 9 out of 10 patients developed distal upper limb weakness later in the disease course , which has been frequently reported [ 27 - 29 ] .
muscle mri is known to reveal fatty replacement of distal and proximal lower limb muscles in the early stages of dysferlinopathy , including patients with clinically isolated proximal or distal involvement [ 7 , 30 ] .
however , an adolescent patient with a mm phenotype ( c - 7 ) showed a normal pelvic and whole lower limb muscle mri , similarly to a patient described with isolated hyperckemia [ 31 ] .
interestingly , we found clinical phenotype variability within families and within unrelated carriers with similar mutations .
such variability has already been reported in libyan jews [ 13 ] and was found to be particularly relevant in a 6 - generation , highly consanguineous family originating from an isolated village in dagestan [ 32 ] .
this observation may indicate that to date , unknown genetic or environmental modifiers play a role in influencing the clinical phenotypes of the mutated dysf gene [ 22 ] .
accordingly , it would be interesting to study micro - rnas known to be involved in many biological processes , including epigenetic changes .
other cardinal features of our cohort were very high ck levels , as previously described [ 7 ] , the absence of cardiac impairment ( nevertheless encountered in few patients [ 6 , 25 , 33 , 34 ] and present in a knock out mouse model [ 35 ]) , and the risk of developing respiratory failure late in the disease course [ 36 , 37 ] , as observed in one of our patients .
emg showed myopathic changes and pathologic spontaneous activity .
in one case , the biopsy revealed striking endomysial inflammation , in line with frequently observed inflammatory changes in dysferlinopathy and other muscular dystrophies [ 18 , 38 ] .
immunosuppressive treatment , however , fails to improve muscle weakness [ 39 ] .
it has been postulated that dysferlin may be linked to membrane repair and / or inflammatory activation [ 40 ] , and in a few cases , splice site mutations disrupting dysferlin are known to produce inflammation [ 18 ] .
conversely , most of our patients with splice mutations showed no evidence of inflammation on muscle biopsy , indicating the lack of clear correlation between inflammation and genotype .
on western blot ( wb ) 3 cases showed a consistent reduction in dysferlin , as has been previously described [ 41 ] .
in dysferlinopathies , genotype is not predictive of disease severity , and genotype - phenotype correlations are not clear - cut [ 15 , 42 ] .
however , correlation has been found between certain geographical areas and the age of onset , notably in japanese and italian mm patients [ 17 ] , who develop symptoms earlier than patients with lgmd 2b [ 10 ] .
the most severely affected patients in our study ( patients a - 1 and a - 2 , described previously [ 12 ]) carried the truncating mutation c.2217c > a ( p.tyr739x ) with a disease duration of 17 and 24 years , respectively , before the patients became wheelchair - bound .
one of the older patients ( c - 8 ) , carrying the c.3031 + 2t > c homozygous mutation , became wheelchair bound after a disease duration of 27 years , and patient d - 9 showed relatively mild impairment 20 years after onset .
however , in all other patients carrying this mutation , disease duration was shorter ; thus precluding longitudinal comparisons .
a longer follow - up is necessary to assess the onset and time - course of the various disabling symptoms .
conclusion our study confirms the broad phenotypic heterogeneity , often accompanied by markedly elevated ck levels , associated with dysf mutations in the swiss population .
due to a potential founder effect in the past , two mutations appear to be endemic in central switzerlans .
these findings are important for genetic counselling and should facilitate targeted molecular diagnosis of dysferlin deficiency in patients of swiss origin .

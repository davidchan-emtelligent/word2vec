introduction interleukin - 37 ( il - 37 ) was first discovered and identified through computational sequence analysis by kumar et al .
[ 1 ] in 2000 .
it was first named il - 1h4 .
in 2001 , dunn et al .
[ 2 ] found that this precursor peptide is the 7th cytokine of il - 1 family , so it was named il - 1f7 .
nold et al .
[ 3 ] found that it could suppress innate immune response and renamed it il - 37 .
in recent years , il - 37 has been found to play an important regulatory role in the development of a variety of inflammatory diseases , autoimmune diseases , and tumors [ 3 - 7 ] .
at present , biological function , signal transduction pathway , and mechanism of immune regulatory functions of il - 37 have not been completely elucidated .
this article reviewed the structure , types , function , and disease - related aspects of il - 37 .
2. structure , types , and processing of il - 37 human il - 37 gene is located on chromosome 2 with a length of 3.617 kb [ 4 ] .
il - 37 has a molecular weight of about 17 ~ 25 kda [ 8 ] .
the structure of il - 37 is similar to that of il - 1 family ( il - 1f ) and consists of 12beta tubular lines .
the 6 exons encode five isoforms of il - 37 including il - 37a , il - 37b , il - 37c , il - 37d , and il - 37e [ 4 , 8 ] ( table 1 ) .
il - 37 molecule is an immature precursor peptide , and each isoform is converted from an inactive precursor peptide state to an active state by the cleavage of caspase - 1 during expression , and all subtypes regulate each other to form relatively stable state [ 4 ] .
it is currently believed that caspase - 1 cleavage site is located between amino acid residues d20 and e21 expressed by exon 1 [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] .
il - 37b ( exons 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) has an intact exon end with the largest molecular weight and has the most complex biological functions .
il - 37b transits from an inactive propeptide to an active mature under the action of caspase - 1 [ 4 , 11 ] .
although il - 37a ( exons 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) does not contain exons 1 and 2 , its exon 3 encodes a unique n - terminus , and exons 4 , 5 , and 6 encode il - 1f homologous structure - beta clover secondary structure .
il - 37d ( exons 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) also encodes the 12beta - strand - containing protein structure , suggesting that these two subtypes also have biological functions [ 4 , 11 ] .
it has been confirmed that il - 37a has an anti - inflammatory effect similar to il - 37b [ 12 ] .
il - 37c ( exons 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) and il - 37e ( exons 1 , 5 , and 6 ) do not encode beta - clover secondary structure due to lack of exon 4 , so they may do not have biological functions [ 4 , 11 ] .
il - 37c shares a common n - terminal sequence with il - 37b and il - 37d and competes with il - 37b and il - 37d precursors for the same cleavage enzyme target ; whereas il - 37c has no biological function , production of precursor il - 37c is recognized as a mechanism of downregulation of il - 37b and il - 37d [ 4 ] .
in addition , il - 37e shares the same caspase - 1 cleavage site with il - 37b in the region of exon 1 , but il - 37e cannot compete with il - 37d due to deletion of exon 2 in the second cleavage site [ 4 ] .
therefore , the maturation of il - 37b can be effectively downregulated by il - 37c but only partially downregulated by il - 37e [ 4 ] .
3. production , distribution , and transportation of il - 37 il - 37 is detectable in many human tissues , but the expression level is low in healthy human tissues [ 3 , 4 ] .
il - 37 expression has been detected in human tissues such as liver , lung , thymus , bone marrow , lymph nodes , placenta , testis , uterus , and tumor tissue and in human cell lines such as a431 , thp - 1 , u937 , imtlh , kg - 1 , hl60 , hpbmc , hpt - 4 , and nhdc [ 13 ] .
the expression of different isoforms of il - 37 is tissue - specific .
il - 37a , b and c are mainly expressed in thymus , bone marrow , lymph nodes , liver , lung , testis , placenta , uterus , colon , nk cells , monocytes , stimulated b cells , and keratinocytes .
il - 37d and il - 37e are expressed only in bone marrow and testis , whereas only il - 37a is expressed in the brain , only il - 37b is expressed in the kidney , and only il - 37c is expressed in the heart [ 2 , 4 ] .
il - 37 mrna is very unstable under normal conditions and can be easily degraded .
stability of il - 37 mrna is significantly enhanced when it is stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) or other exogenous stimuli .
stability of il - 37 mrna is regulated by exon 5 [ 4 , 14 ] .
it is concluded that il - 37 may not play a role in noninflammatory or mild inflammatory state , and its expression is only increased under severe inflammatory conditions to inhibit excessive immune response [ 4 ] .
il - 37 can be secreted outside to bind to surface receptor to achieve its function .
in addition , il - 37 can also be intracellularly secreted .
so il - 37 can play an anti - inflammatory effect through both intracellular and extracellular routes [ 10 , 12 , 15 ] .
the processing and nuclear translocation of il - 37 , as well as the extracellular secretion of mature il - 37 , all require the involvement of caspase - 1 [ 10 ] , but secretion of precursor il - 37 does not depend on caspase - 1 [ 10 ] .
recognizing that il - 37 gene has not been found in mice [ 4 ] , il - 37 - tg mice were widely used as pathological models .
il - 37 - tg mice were generated using the full - length precursor cdna of il - 37b isoform driven by the cmv promoter for constitutive expression and il37 - tg mice breed normally and have no obvious phenotype [ 3 ] .
4. functions of il - 37 and the mechanisms as an immunosuppressive factor , il - 37 can suppress innate and adaptive immunity through many ways ; furthermore , il - 37 exhibited antitumor effect in several studies ( table 2 ) .
4.1 .
il - 37 in innate immunity low levels of il - 37 can be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) of healthy individuals [ 3 ] .
il - 37 expression was significantly upregulated after stimulation by lps , pam3csk4 , and tgf - beta1 [ 3 ] .
after il - 37 silencing using sirna against il - 37 ( siil - 37 ) in pbmc , secretions of il - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 12 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) , and granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) were significantly upregulated after lps treatment and showed a dose - dependent manner [ 3 ] .
the same results were obtained after stimulation using tlr6 - tlr2 ligand malp - 2 .
however , the anti - inflammatory factors il - 10 and il - 1ralpha were not affected [ 3 ] .
consistent with this , expression of the proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 increased after neutralization of il - 37 produced by pbmcs with anti - il - 37 monoclonal antibodies [ 12 ] .
in thp - 1 cell line and a549 cell line transfected with pires - il - 37b plasmid , expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 1alpha and il - 1beta were significantly decreased [ 3 ] .
compared with blank control group , tlr ligand - induced release of proinflammatory cytokines from lps - stimulated mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7 transfected with pires - il - 37b plasmid was significantly inhibited .
the inhibitory rates of il - 1alpha and il - 6 were up to 88 % and 86 % , respectively [ 3 ] , while the expression of anti - inflammatory cytokines il - 10 and il - 13 was increased [ 3 ] .
those findings showed that il - 37 can suppress innate immune response , possibly by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by toll - like receptor ( tlr ) agonists [ 3 , 8 ] .
il - 1beta , tnf , ifn - gamma , il - 18 , tgf - beta , and tlr ligands and inflammatory cytokines can effectively induce the high expression of il - 37 , while gm - csf combined with il - 4 can inhibit its expression [ 3 ] .
il - 37 can reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 1alpha , il - 1beta , il - 1ra , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 17 , il - 23 , tnf - alpha , and ifn - gamma and chemokines such as mip - 2 / cxcl2 , ccl12 / mcp - 5 , and bca - 1 / cxcl13 .
it can also inhibit the expression of m - gsf and gm - csf but increase the production of tgf - beta1 , which is realized as an immunosuppressive factor [ 3 , 8 ] .
it has been reported that il - 37 can induce the expression of nitric oxide ( nos2 ) in vitro and nos2 can effectively inhibit the activation of inflammasome and the differentiation of th17 [ 16 ] .
beside the effects on the function of tlrs , il - 37 can also suppress innate immune response by inhibiting the activation of the inflammasome of the nod - like receptor family pyrin domain - containing 3 ( nlrp3 ) [ 3 , 16 ] , and nlrp3 plays a key role in various inflammation - related signal transduction pathways [ 17 , 18 ] .
in lung aspergillosis mouse model , compared with untreated aspergillosis mice , expression of nlrp3 mrna was significantly decreased in mice intraperitoneally injected with il - 37 , while levels of myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) , cxcl2 , il - 1beta , il - 17a , and ifn - gamma were significantly reduced [ 16 ] .
il - 37 attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs by inhibiting the activity of nlrp3 inflammasome [ 16 ] .
the experiment further confirmed that il - 37 lost its regulatory effects on neutrophil recruitment and expression of il - 1beta , mpo , and cxcl2 in nlrp3 - deficient mice [ 16 ] .
bulau et al .
[ 10 ] also confirmed that the inhibitory effect of il - 37 on expression of il - 6 and il - 1beta was significantly weakened in bone marrow macrophages of nlrp3 or associated apoptosis - associated protein - containing carboxyserine caspase recruitment domain - ( asc - ) deficient mice .
4.2 .
il - 37 in adaptive immunity il - 37 is a natural inhibitor of innate immunity , whereas adaptive immunity relies on innate immunity .
moretti et al .
[ 16 ] have found that il - 37 can significantly inhibit the activation of th2 / th17 cells in mice with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , indicating that il - 37 may also affect adaptive immunity .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are important antigen - presenting cells in the body .
dcs accept and integrate signals from a variety of cells and transmit the signals to a variety of immune cells , so as to play an important role in the initiation and development of adaptive immune responses [ 19 ] .
dcs have the ability to induce both immune responses and immune tolerance [ 19 ] .
studies have shown that il - 37 can induce dcs to acquire immune tolerance and thus inhibit adaptive immune response [ 20 ] .
in skin contact hypersensitivity ( chs ) mouse model , swelling of the local skin of the allergen - vaccinated il - 37tg mice was significantly reduced compared to the wild - type mice .
antigenic response was also significantly weakened in wild - type mice after treatment with hapten sensitized dcs [ 20 ] .
in vitro experiments showed that expression of mhc ii and costimulatory molecules cd40 on the surface of dcs from il - 37tg mice was significantly decreased , their ability to activate naive t cells and antigen - specific t cells decreased , but their ability to induce differentiation of treg cells was obviously enhanced [ 20 ] .
immunohistochemical results showed that the number of cd8 + t cells was significantly reduced , while the number of treg cells was significantly increased [ 20 ] .
il - 37 can delay the process of antigen presentation by downregulating the activity of dcs .
il - 37 can also affect th cell balance , thereby attenuating t cell - mediated inflammation [ 3 , 20 ] .
4.3 .
antitumor effect of il - 37 in addition to its immunosuppressive effects , antitumor effect of il - 37 has been more and more studied [ 7 , 13 , 21 ] .
gao et al .
[ 13 ] constructed a mice mca205 fibrosarcoma model and injected recombinant adenovirus il - 37b ( adenovirus - mediated gene transfer , adil - 37b ) directly into the tumor .
as a result , a single injection of adil - 37b significantly inhibited tumor growth , and tumor growth was inhibited completely after multiple injections .
b6.cg - foxn1nu nude mice and b6.cb17 - prkdcscid / szj scid mice do not have functional t cells and b cells .
after injection of adil - 37b into mca205 fibrosarcoma of those mice , no suppressed tumor growth was observed .
il - 37b also showed no antitumor effects on mice deficient in ifn - gamma , indicating that ifn - gamma , functional t cells , and b cells play a key role in the antitumor activity of il - 37 [ 13 ] .
il - 37b also showed no antitumor effects in il - 12 p40 / 40 knockout mice .
however , the antitumor effect of il - 37b was not reduced in nkt knockout mice , indicating that il - 37 does not achieve its antitumor effect through nkt cells , but the involvement of il - 12 is needed [ 13 ] .
il - 12 mediates antitumor effects mainly through perforin and the function of il - 18 mainly rely on fasl [ 22 ] .
after adil - 37b was injected into mca205 fibroblast of b6smm.c3h - faslgld - fasl ligand - deficient mice , tumor growth was not inhibited , indicating that il - 37b has similar antitumor effects to il - 12 and il - 18 , so it can be speculated that il - 37b may be an important mediator of innate immunity and adaptive immunity [ 13 ] .
in hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , patients with high expression of il - 37 in tumor tissue have better overall survival rate and disease - free survival rate [ 21 ] .
in tumor tissues , expression of il - 37 was positively correlated with the density of cd57 + natural killer ( nk ) cells .
in vitro experiments also demonstrated that il - 37 has the ability to recruit cd57 + nk cells [ 21 ] .
subsequently , it was confirmed in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma model that il - 37 has the effect of inhibiting tumor growth , possibly by increasing the recruitment of cd57 + nk cells to kill cancer cells [ 21 ] .
however , the antitumor effect of il - 37 has been proved to have no obvious relationship with cd3 + and cd8 + t cells .
this is not consistent with the finding of gao et al .
[ 13 ] .
this may be due to the different pathogenesis of different tumors and different pathways involved in the antitumor functions of il - 37 .
il - 37 also showed antitumor effects in mouse model of non - small - cell lung cancer [ 23 ] .
compared with control group , transfected mice stably expressing il - 37 showed significantly reduced tumor growth rate , microvessel density , and expression levels of vgef and cd34 , and il - 37 treatment also significantly inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) [ 23 ] .
it is speculated that il - 37 may inhibit tumor angiogenesis and thus play a role in tumor suppression [ 23 ] .
however , il - 37 did not show significant antitumor effect in vitro experiments .
it is speculated that il - 37 may rely on different pathways in different tumors to achieve its function , for example , by enhancing the function of effector t or altering the tumor microenvironment to achieve antitumor effects .
il - 37 also showed inhibitory effect on tumor cells in renal cell carcinoma [ 24 ] and cervical cancer [ 25 ] .
those studies showed that il - 37 can inhibit tumor cell migration , proliferation , and induce cell apoptosis possibly by inhibiting stat3 expression and phosphorylation [ 24 , 25 ] .
4.4 .
il - 37 related receptors and signaling pathways 4.4.1 .
il - 37b and smad3 after human epithelial cell line a549 was transfected with flag labeled il - 37b , il - 37b and phospho - smad3 ( mothers against decapentaplegic related protein ) were colocalized in perinuclear regions and cytoplasm .
anti - flag coimmunoprecipitation further confirmed the interaction between il - 37b and smad3 [ 3 ] .
il - 37 can enter the nucleus to form functional complexes with smad3 , thus affecting gene transcription and inhibiting toll - like receptor - induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta , il - 16 , and ifn - gamma [ 3 , 4 ] .
anti - inflammatory properties of il - 37 were found to be markedly reduced in mouse raw264.7 cell line and human thp - 1 cell line after the use of smad3 - specific inhibitor or silencing of endogenous smad3 using targeted sirna [ 3 ] .
knockdown of smad3 in the lungs of il - 37 transgenic mice with sirna also markedly diminished the anti - inflammatory effects of il - 37 [ 3 ] .
these results indicate that smad3 is essential for the anti - inflammatory effects of il - 37 .
4.4.2 .
il - 37b inhibits stats and p38mapk phosphorylated stat1 - 4 is a key player in the signaling transduction of proinflammatory cytokines .
it is an important signaling molecule in signal transduction of proinflammatory cytokines il - 6 , il - 12 , and ifn - gamma [ 26 ] , while phosphorylated p38mapk is centrally located in a variety of proinflammatory signaling pathways [ 27 ] .
il - 37 and smad3 can form a functional complex to inhibit the activity of many kinds of stats and reduce the phosphorylation of p38mapk , erk1 / 2 , and jnk , as well as the expression of some kinases involved in inflammatory signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) , proline - rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( pyk2 ) , and paxillin [ 3 , 8 , 12 , 28 ] .
xie et al .
[ 29 ] have shown that il - 37 can significantly inhibit nf - kappab signaling pathway .
nold - petry et al .
[ 30 ] found that the binding of il - 37 to il - 1r8 inhibited the expression of kinase fyn , tak1 , nf - kappab , and mapk through inhibiting signaling molecules mer , pten , stat3 , and p62 .
4.4.3 .
il - 37b and il - 18 and their receptors il - 18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that can induce the proliferation and differentiation of t cells , promote and maintain the secretion of il - 17 by th17 cells , and promote th17 cells - based cellular immune response [ 31 , 32 ] .
il - 37 has two conserved amino acid residues ( glu - 35 and lys - 124 ) that are structurally similar to the two conserved residues of il - 18 ( glu - 35 and lys - 89 ) [ 9 , 33 - 35 ] , indicating that il - 37 and il - 18 may have the same receptor .
studies have shown that il - 37b can bind to il - 18ralpha , but it is not an agonist or antagonist of il - 18 .
chemically cross - linking shows that il - 37b cannot recruit il - 18rbeta to form a functional trimer [ 9 , 33 ] , and the binding affinity of il - 37 to il - 18ralpha is only 1 / 50 that of il - 18 , so it cannot competitively bind to il - 18ralpha with il - 18 [ 9 ] .
however , il - 37 can bind to il - 18ralpha to form a complex with il - 18bp , a natural antagonist of il - 18 , so as to enhance the inhibitory effect of il - 18bp on il - 18 , thereby reducing the activity of il - 18 and the levels of th1 cells , nk cells and ifn - gamma [ 9 , 16 , 33 , 36 ] .
il - 37b can bind to il - 18bp to form a complex with il - 18rbeta , which can reduce the formation of il - 18ralpha / beta complex and thus inhibit the signal transduction pathway of il - 18 [ 33 ] .
il - 37 also need to bind to single immunoglobulin il - 1 receptor related protein ( sigirr ) to exert an anti - inflammatory effects [ 12 ] .
siggrr is a newly discovered member of the toll - like receptor / interleukin - 1 receptor ( tir ) superfamily .
siggrr is also known as tlr - il - 1r8 ( tir8 ) and can regulate th2 immune response [ 37 ] .
it has been demonstrated that il - 37 cannot exert its anti - inflammatory effects in bone marrow dcs ( bmdcs ) of siggrr / il - r8 deficient mice [ 12 ] .
experiments by moretti et al .
[ 16 ] on mice pulmonary aspergillosis model have demonstrated that il - 37 fails to exert its anti - inflammatory effect by inhibiting the activation of the nalp3 inflammasome in tir - 8 / sigirr - deficient mice ( tir8 - / - mice ) .
nold et al .
[ 38 ] found that il - 37 can exert its anti - inflammatory effect in combination with il - 18ralpha , while anti - inflammatory effect of il - 37 disappeared in sigirr knockout mice ( il - 37tg - sigirr - ko mice ) .
nold - petry et al .
[ 30 ] also found that il - 1r8 and il - 18ralpha were required for il - 37 to exert its anti - inflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro .
5. il - 37 in disease 5.1 .
il - 37 in infectious diseases endotoxin lps from gram - negative bacteria can induce the excessive production of inflammatory mediators such as tnf - alpha , il - 1 , il - 6 , il - 8 , oxygen free radicals , and histamine , which in turn lead to septic shock .
nold et al .
[ 3 ] found that , compared with wild - type mice , alleviated inflammatory response , weakened lps - induced hypothermia , metabolic acidosis , dehydration , hyperkalemia symptoms and liver injury and other endotoxic shock performance , and increased respiratory compensation were observed in mice transplanted with human il - 37 precursor gene ( transgenic mice for human il - 37 precursor , hil - 37tg ) after intraperitoneal injections of lps .
compared with wild mice , 16 proinflammatory cytokines and 2 chemokines in serum were reduced by more than 33 % .
improved toxemia manifestations were found in il - 37tg homozygous mice compared to those in heterozygous mice .
percentage of cd86 and mhc ii molecules double positive cells ( average 47 %) was significantly lower in those treated mice than in wild - type mice ( average 73 %) , and the dc activity was inhibited in those mice [ 3 ] .
this indicates that il - 37 can inhibit the occurrence of septic shock by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines .
a clinical study on chronic hepatitis b showed that serum levels of il - 37 in chronic hepatitis b patients with high viral load were significantly higher than those in normal population , and serum levels of il - 37 were increased in hepatitis b e antigen - ( hbeag - ) positive chronic type b patients and were positively correlated with the virus concentration and alt levels [ 39 ] .
it is speculated that il - 37 plays an important role in the immune tolerance of chronic hbv infection .
in hiv - infected patients , il - 37 mrna expression was significantly increased in pbmcs compared with noninfected patients , and the steady - state level of il - 37 mrna in pbmcs was positively correlated with viral load [ 40 ] .
a study carried out by chattergoon et al .
[ 41 ] showed that il - 37 inhibited the replication of hiv , indicating the potential role of il - 37 in the treatment of hiv infection .
after intraperitoneal injection of il - 37 into mouse model of aspergillus infection , moretti et al .
[ 16 ] found that il - 37 effectively reduced the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome , decreased the expression levels of inflammatory factors and chemotaxis factors , and reduced neutrophil infiltration , lung injury , and degree of cystic fibrosis .
however , in c. albicans - induced animal model of diffuse candidiasis , hil - 37tg mice showed more pronounced susceptibility to c. albicans and the mortality rate ( all deaths within 10 days ) was significantly higher than that of the control group [ 42 ] .
those studies have shown that il - 37 can inhibit excessive immune response and protect the body from endotoxic shock and infectious diseases .
but il - 37 also may lead to increased infection and mortality in infection caused by some pathogens possibly due to its inhibitory effects on immune response ( table 3 ) .
5.2 .
il - 37 in ischemia - reperfusion injury ischemia - reperfusion ( i / r ) injury refers to the increased tissue and organ dysfunction and structural damage caused by reperfusion after a period of tissue ischemia [ 43 ]. and il - 37 may play a protective factor in i / r injury ( table 4 ) .
a study by sakai et al .
[ 44 ] found that , compared with untreated i / r liver injury mice , treatment of i / r - induced liver injury mice with recombinant human il - 37 protein inhibited neutrophil recruitment , decreased levels of injury , and reduced the serum levels of tnf - alpha , mip - 2 , and liver reactive oxygen free radicals .
direct application of recombinant il - 37 protein on lps - stimulated hepatocytes and kupffer cells inhibited tnf - alpha - induced neutrophils activation , reduced liver cell death , and increased expression level of bcl - 2 [ 44 ] , and bcl - 2 is an important protective factor against i / r liver injury [ 45 , 46 ] .
in addition , the activation of p38mapk and jnk signaling pathway is an important mechanism of i / r liver injury [ 47 , 48 ] , and il - 37 may inhibit the activation of p38mapk and jnk signaling pathways [ 3 ] , thereby reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and improving liver damage .
wu et al .
[ 49 ] confirmed that administration of recombinant human il - 37 in myocardial ischemia - reperfusion mice could effectively reduce myocardial ischemia - reperfusion injury .
myocardial infarct size and troponin t level were significantly decreased compared with control group , and cardiac function was significantly improved .
il - 37 can effectively reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reduce neutrophil infiltration , as well as myocardial cell apoptosis and production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 49 ] .
il - 37 effectively inhibits the expression of tlr - 4 and the activation of nf - kappab but increases the level of anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 [ 49 ] .
in vitro experiments also confirmed the protective effect of il - 37 on myocardial ischemia - reperfusion injury [ 49 ] .
the study also found that protective effect of il - 37 on myocardial ischemia - reperfusion injury was significantly reduced when il - 10 signaling pathway was blocked by a specific anti - il10r mab , indicating that the protective function of il - 37 at least partially depends on the involvement of il - 10 [ 49 ] .
yang et al .
[ 50 ] further confirmed the protective effect of il - 37 on renal ischemia - reperfusion injury in mice .
5.3 .
il - 37 in autoimmune diseases nold et al .
[ 3 ] found that il - 37 was excessively expressed in the synovial tissue of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis .
following up studies have shown that il - 37 is closely related to inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases [ 5 , 6 ] ( table 5 ) .
5.3.1 .
il - 37 in inflammatory bowel disease inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) are idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect ileum , rectum , and colon .
ibd include ulcerative colitis ( uc ) and crohn 's disease ( cd ) .
imbalance of immunomodulatory processes , multiple immune cells , and proinflammatory cytokines were involved in the pathogenesis of ibd [ 51 , 52 ] .
mcnamee et al .
[ 53 ] established a transgenic mouse ( hil - 37tg mice ) expressing human il - 37 and constructed a colitis model using dextran sulfate sodium ( dss ) .
clinical disease score of il - 37 transgenic mice was 50 % lower than that of wild - type mice , and the histological scores of il - 37 transgenic mice were also significantly lower than those of wild - type mice .
expression levels of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha in colonic tissue of il - 37 transgenic mice were significantly decreased compared with wild - type mice , but expression level of anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 was significantly increased [ 53 ] .
il - 10 showed no significant effects on the function of il - 37 , indicating that il - 10 may be not a key player in anti - inflammatory function of il - 37 in a colitis model [ 53 ] .
the same protective effect was observed in wild - type mice after hil - 37tg bone marrow transplantation , indicating that il - 37b , which is derived from bone marrow , is sufficient for anti - inflammatory effects [ 53 ] .
imaeda et al .
[ 54 ] found that il - 37b was almost not expressed in normal colon tissue and highly expressed in affected colon in ibd patients , and the expression level was positively correlated with the degree of disease .
in vitro experiments showed that il - 37b inhibited the activation of t cells and dcs , thereby reducing intestinal inflammation [ 54 ] .
a study of childhood ibd showed that expression level of il - 37 in patient 's colon was positively correlated with the histopathological score of uc or cd [ 55 ] .
li et al .
[ 56 ] found that expression level of il - 37 in colonic mucosa of uc and cd patients was higher than that of healthy controls , while level of il - 37 in serum was lower than that of normal controls , and level of il - 37 in serum was negatively correlated with mayo score of uc patients .
above studies showed that il - 37 was involved in the development of ibd and had a protective effect on the body .
5.3.2 .
il - 37 in systemic lupus erythematosus systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is an autoimmune disease with the activation of t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes and appearance of autoantibodies against autoantigens during the onset of disease [ 57 ] .
song et al .
[ 58 ] found that serum level of il - 37 was significantly higher in patients with sle than in healthy controls , and il - 37 level decreased after treatment with glucocorticoid , and il - 37 level was positively correlated with il - 18 , il - 18bp , ifn - gamma , il - 6 , and sledai score before and after treatment [ 58 ] .
ye et al .
[ 59 ] found that il - 37 mrna in pbmc and serum il - 37 of sle patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls .
il - 37 was associated with the activity of sle disease , and levels of il - 37 were higher in active patients than in inactive patients .
serum il - 37 levels in patients with renal damage were significantly higher than those without renal damage .
there was no significant difference in serum il - 37 level between healthy control and patients without renal damage , suggesting that il - 37 is closely related to renal damage in sle [ 59 ] .
in vitro experiments showed that recombinant il - 37 can inhibit the expression of tnf - alpha , il - 6 , and il - 1beta in pbmcs from sle patients [ 59 ] .
it is speculated that il - 37 may play a protective role in the development of sle .
5.3.3 .
il - 37 in rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic systemic inflammation and autoimmune disease mainly characterized by joint diseases .
a variety of cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis .
dysfunction of immune regulation is the leading cause of rheumatoid arthritis [ 60 ] .
zhao et al .
[ 61 ] found that serum levels of il - 37 in patients with ra were significantly higher than those in healthy controls .
after dmard treatment , serum il - 37 levels were decreased in drug susceptible patients and levels of il - 37 are closely related to proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 17a and tnf - alpha ) and ra activity ( crp , das28 score ) .
these results are consistent with the findings of xia et al .
[ 62 ] and yang et al .
[ 63 ] .
serum levels of il - 37 in ra patients were closely related to disease activity ( cep , esr , and das28 score ) .
in vitro experiments showed that il - 37 significantly decreased the expression of il - 17 , il - 1beta , and il - 6 and inhibited the proliferation of th17 lymphocytes .
however , il - 37 had no significant effect on the differentiation of th17 cells [ 64 ] .
treatment in collagen - induced arthritis ( cia ) model of mice with adil - 37 resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of disease and significantly improved disease conditions including synovial hyperplasia , angiogenesis , cartilage damage , and bone erosion in the knee joint .
expression levels of il - 17 , il - 1b , and il - 6 were also decreased after treatment [ 64 ] .
however , a survey on han population found that the snp ( rs3811047 ) of il - 37 was associated with clinical manifestations of patients with ra [ 65 ] .
the number of joint swollenness , joint swelling index , degree of resting pain , and health survey evaluation index in ra patients with aa or ag genotype were lower than those in gg genotype patients , indicating that the a allele of il - 37 gene ( rs3811047 ) may be a protective factor for the activity of ra disease [ 65 ] .
5.3.4 .
il - 37 in psoriasis psoriasis is an autoimmune - mediated chronic inflammatory skin disorder and abnormal expression of inflammatory mediators plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease [ 66 , 67 ] .
teng et al .
[ 68 ] constructed a human keratinocyte cell line ( hacat ) stably expressing il - 37 and found that il - 37 significantly decreased the inflammatory reaction induced by m5 ( 10 ng / ml tnf - alpha , il - 17a , il - 22 , il - 1alpha , and oncostatin - m ) , compared with the control group , expression of cxcl8 , il - 6 , and s100a7 was significantly inhibited .
further studies found that , compared with control group , improved local epidermal hyperplasia and ulceration , reduced epithelial hyperplasia , vasodilatation and inflammatory cell infiltration , and reduced symptom score of psoriasis were observed in k14 - vegf transgenic mice ( k14 - vegf - tg mice ) injected with il - 37 plasmid [ 68 ] .
expression of ifn - gamma in psoriatic plaques was also significantly reduced in this group of mice [ 68 ] .
immunohistochemistry revealed abundant il - 37 expression in human psoriatic plaques , and il - 37 is mainly expressed in memory t cells ( tems ) and macrophages , and expression level was relatively low in epithelial cells , and its expression levels were higher in areas with severe lesions than in areas with lighter lesions [ 68 ] .
thus , il - 37 may be an important immunoregulatory factor in the development of psoriasis and exert its effects by inhibiting the expression of key proinflammatory cytokines .
5.3.5 .
il - 37 in asthma asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway .
a variety of immunocytes and cellular components are related to the development of asthma , and imbalance in immunomodulation is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease [ 69 ] .
lunding et al .
[ 70 ] found that the expression of il - 37 in pbmc of children with allergic asthma was significantly lower than that of healthy controls .
in ovalbumin - ( ova - ) induced mouse acute asthma model , use of il - 37 nasal inhalation therapy effectively alleviated allergic airway inflammation , decreased the expression levels of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines , and reduced mucus production and airway hyperresponsiveness , indicating that il - 37 can relieve allergic asthma mediated by th2 cells [ 70 ] .
however , il - 37 did not show the same effect on il - 18ralpha and sigirr - deficient mice , suggesting that il - 37 needs to bind to il - 18ralpha and sigirr to exert anti - inflammatory effects [ 70 ] .
a study on childhood asthma showed that levels of il - 37 in serum and expression level of il - 37 mrna in induced sputum ( ip ) in asthmatic children were lower than those in the normal controls and were related to the severity of the disease [ 71 ] .
compared with healthy control , ip from asthmatic children showed higher levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha after lps stimulation , while ril - 37 significantly inhibited the production of il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha , and ril - 37 significantly inhibited the formation of th17 from cd4 + t cells [ 71 ] .
it is speculated that il - 37 as an anti - inflammatory may play a critical role in the development of asthma .
5.3.6 .
il - 37 in guillain - barre syndrome , ankylosing spondylitis , and graves' disease il - 37 level was significantly higher in patients with guillain - barre syndrome ( gbs ) [ 72 ] , ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) [ 73 ] , and graves' disease ( gd ) [ 74 ] than in healthy controls , and the expression level of il - 37 was closely related to disease activity .
serum levels of il - 37 , il - 17a , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , and cerebrospinal fluids il - 37 and il - 17a were significantly increased in the acute phase of gbs and levels of il - 37 and il - 17a in cerebrospinal fluid and serum level of tnf - alpha were positively correlated with the grade of paralysis [ 72 ] .
serum levels of il - 37 were positively correlated with levels of il - 6 , il - 17 , and tnf - alpha in patients with gd and as , and in vitro experiments confirmed that il - 37 can inhibit secretion of proinflammatory factors by pbmcs [ 73 , 74 ] .
studies have confirmed that single nucleotide polymorphism of il - 37 gene is associated with as susceptibility in han population , and this susceptibility and hla - b27 may be two independent risk factors for as [ 75 ] .
5.4 .
il - 37 in cancer thus far , more and more studies have shown that il - 37 has antitumor effects , so in this portion of the review , the focus will be on the antitumor effects of il - 37 ( table 6 ) .
gao et al .
[ 13 ] constructed a mice mca205 fibrosarcoma model , and adil - 37b was injected directly into the tumor .
results showed that single injection of adil - 37b significantly inhibited tumor growth , while tumor growth was completely inhibited after multiple injections , and the antitumor effect of il - 37b required the participation of ifn - gamma , il - 12 , and functional t cells and b cells [ 13 ] .
zhao et al .
[ 21 ] used immunohistochemical methods to analyze clinical samples derived from 163 patients with hccs .
compared with control group , expression level of il - 37 in hcc group was decreased and inversely proportional to tumor size .
this study showed that patients with high expression level of il - 37 in hcc tumor tissue had better overall survival and disease - free survival , and the low expression of il - 37 in tumor tissue was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis [ 21 ] .
in hcc model of mice overexpressing il - 37 , delayed tumor growth was observed and more nk cells were recruited to tumor tissue [ 21 ] .
this suggests that il - 37 may serve as not only valuable biomarker for prognosis , but also a new target for the treatment of hcc .
il - 37 also showed antitumor effects in mouse non - small - cell lung cancer model [ 23 ] .
compared with control group , tumor growth was slower in mice expressing il - 37 , possibly related to its inhibitory effects on proinflammatory response and tumor angiogenesis [ 23 ] .
il - 37 has also been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in renal cell carcinoma [ 24 ] , cervical cancer [ 25 ] , and oral squamous cell carcinoma [ 76 ] , but all experiments were performed in vitro .
so the role of il - 37 still needed to be studied in vivo .
pathogenesis of different tumors is various , and il - 37 may play different roles in different tumors .
il - 37 may change tumor microenvironment in vivo , so as to play its antitumor effect .
5.5 .
il - 37 in cardiovascular disease a recent epidemiological survey on cardiovascular diseases in europe showed that cardiovascular disease remained the first cause of death and the incidence of this disease showed an increasing trend [ 77 ] .
cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome are closely related to the development of immune system [ 78 - 80 ] .
chai et al .
[ 81 ] established an atherosclerosis model using apoe - deficient diabetic mice .
they found that , compared with control group , mice with intraperitoneal injection of il - 37 showed significantly reduced arterial calcification area , atherosclerotic plaque size , and lower plaque vulnerability scores in the root of aorta .
treatment with il - 37 elevated serum osteoprotegerin ( opg ) concentrations , decreased expression levels of alp , bmp - 2 , tnf - alpha , and il - 18 , and increased the expression levels of anti - inflammatory factor il - 10 .
compared with mice only treated with il - 37 , vascular calcification area , atherosclerotic plaque size , and plaque vulnerability scores were increased in mice treated with both il - 37 and anti - opg antibody , indicating that the function of il - 37 in atherosclerotic mice depends or at least partially depends on opg [ 81 ] .
a study on acute coronary syndromes ( acs ) showed that serum levels of il - 37 , il - 18 , and il - 18bp were significantly increased in acs patients compared to patients with stable angina pectoris ( sap ) and healthy controls [ 82 ] .
levels of il - 37 , il - 18 , and il - 18bp were positively correlated with c - reactive protein ( crp ) , n - terminal probrain natriuretic peptide ( nt - probnp ) , and left ventricular end - diastolic dimension ( lvedd ) and were negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) , but all those three factors showed no correlation with the degree of coronary stenosis [ 82 ] .
wang et al .
[ 83 ] found that levels of il - 37 , il - 18 , and il - 18bp in blood of patients with acute st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( astemi ) were significantly lower than those in healthy control at 12 h , 24 h , and 48 h after percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) .
immunoblotting showed that levels of il - 37 and icam - 1 expressed by leukocytes were the highest at 12 h and then reduced at 48 h [ 83 ] .
a study on mouse model of acute myocardial infarction showed that il - 37 inhibited the expression of myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) and nf - kappab signaling pathway [ 84 ] .
echocardiography showed that left ventricular shortening fraction ( lvfs ) was significantly reduced and cardiac function was improved in il - 37 - treated mice compared with the control group [ 84 ] .
the above studies show that il - 37 may be a protective factor of atherosclerosis and acs and may potentially serve as a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of these cardiovascular diseases ( table 7 ) .
5.6 .
il - 37 in obesity and insulin resistance obesity is currently considered to be a chronic inflammatory disease .
adipocytes in obese patients overexpress inflammatory factors , and chemokines , macrophages , and other immune cells are activated in this disease , leading to long - term , chronic inflammatory reactions [ 85 ] .
insulin resistance is closely related to the occurrence and development of chronic inflammation and abnormal expression of immune factors [ 86 , 87 ] .
studies found that il - 37 may be closely related to obesity and insulin resistance ( table 8 ) .
in a study included 21 obese patients , moschen et al .
[ 88 ] detected the changes in il - 1 family cytokines in liver and adipose tissue of patients who received laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding .
they found that preoperative expression of il - 1 family cytokines was significantly higher in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue than in liver , whereas anti - inflammatory cytokines increased in adipose and liver tissues after bariatric surgery , and insulin resistance was improved [ 88 ] .
expression of il - 37 in the liver was positively correlated with body mass index but negatively correlated with gamma - glutamyl transferase ( ggt ) .
expression of il - 37 in subcutaneous adipose tissue was negatively correlated with bmi , serum insulin , and homeostasis model assessment ( homa ) index , and bmi , ggt , and homa index decreased after weight reduction .
ballak et al .
[ 89 ] found that expression levels of il - 37 mrna in human adipose tissue were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity .
compared with wild - type mice , lower body weight gain , reduced number and size of adipocytes , decreased liver weight and hepatic triglyceride content , and reduced blood cholesterol levels were found in il - 37 transgenic mice after feeding with high - fat diet for 16 weeks .
il - 37 inhibited the activation of multiple proinflammatory signaling pathways in adipose tissue and decreased the number of macrophages [ 89 ] .
recombinant il - 37 inhibited adipogenesis in adipocytes and activate adenosine 5 ' - monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) signaling pathway [ 89 ] .
il - 37 can maintain the phosphorylation of irs - 1 tyrosine ( tyr ) 941 , so as to remedy downstream insulin signaling [ 89 ] .
this indicates that il - 37 may play an important anti - inflammatory role in obesity - induced inflammation and insulin resistance in both mice and humans and may serve as a potential target for the treatment of obesity , insulin resistance , and type 2 diabetes .
6. conclusion and outlook as a new member of il - 1 family , il - 37 is widely expressed in human organs and tissues .
il - 37 , as an inhibitor of inflammation , plays an important regulatory role in both innate immune response and adaptive immune response .
il - 37 can inhibit the expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines .
intracellularly , il - 37 forms complex with smad3 to achieve nuclear translocation , which in turn regulates gene transcription , cell metabolism , cell proliferation , and cytokine expression and inhibits the activity of dcs .
extracellularly , il - 37 acts as an immunosuppressive agent by binding to il - 18ralpha to form complex with il - 18bp , so as to achieve the role of immune suppression by inhibiting the synthesis of ifn - gamma and suppressing signal transduction after tlrs .
studies have confirmed that il - 37 plays an important role in many diseases such as infectious diseases , metabolic diseases , ischemia - reperfusion injury , autoimmune diseases , and tumors .
in spite of those progresses achieved by previous studies , il - 37 receptors , related signaling pathways , mechanisms of signal transduction , and the interactions with other cytokines still have n't been completely elucidated .
in addition , studies on il - 37 mainly focus on il - 37b , and functions of other isoforms are still unknown .
in addition , most of the experiments were performed on cell lines and animal models , clinical studies still lack .
in - depth study on the mechanism and key aspects of il - 37 - mediated immune response may provide the theoretical basis for further clarifying the occurrence and development of immune response and further elucidating the pathogenesis of immune - related diseases and carcinomas .
the identification of novel targets will definitely improve the treatment of these diseases .

objective studies investigating the contribution of cytochrome p4502e1 ( cyp2e1 ) polymorphisms to the etiology of urinary cancer draw inconsistent conclusions .
thus , we performed a meta - analysis to evaluate the association between cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms and urinary cancer susceptibility .
materials and methods meta - analysis based on the eligible case - control studies that assess the association of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms with urinary cancer was conducted .
subgroup analyses based on ethnicity and cancer type were also carried out .
odds ratios ( or ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations between the two polymorphisms .
funnel plot and begg 's test were used for publication bias diagnosis .
results we found decreased urinary cancer risk among subjects carrying cyp2e1 rsai / psti c1c2 + c2c2 genotype and c2 allele ( or = 0.73 , 95 % ci = 0.68 - 0.79 and or = 0.79 , 95 % ci = 0.74 - 0.85 , respectively ) , with 3,301 cases and 3,786 controls from 14 studies .
we also observed a significant difference in c1c2 + c2c2 vs. c1c1 and c2 vs. c1 among asians ( or = 0.68 , 95 % ci = 0.60 - 0.78 and or = 0.75 , 95 % ci = 0.66 - 0.85 , respectively ) .
however , the meta - analysis based on 5 eligible studies showed no significant association between cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism and urinary cancer susceptibility in either dominant model or the allele model .
conclusions our meta - analysis concluded that cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism correlates with urinary cancers risk in asian population ; while cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism might be not significantly associated with the urinary cancer risks .
large and well - designed studies are needed to confirm these results .
cytochrome p4502e1 cyp2e1 polymorphism urinary cancer meta - analysis introduction cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide , which accounted for 7.6 million deaths in 2008 [ 1 ] .
prostate cancer , renal cancer and urothelial carcinoma are common types of malignancies worldwide [ 2 ] .
although the underlying mechanism of its development is largely unclear , it has been widely accepted that environmental risk factors such as cumulative cigarette smoking , alcohol consumption , certain occupational exposures , radiation and possible carcinogens including n - nitrosamines , aniline , vinyl chloride and urethane are involved in the onset of urinary cancer [ 3 ] .
nevertheless , very small fraction of individuals who exposed to the risk factors eventually become urinary cancer patients , indicating that other causes , such as genetic susceptibility , might affect the variat individual urinary cancer risk [ 4 , 5 ] .
recently , a number of gene polymorphisms which were associated with urinary cancer risk have been found , and some polymorphisms located in the genes associated with carcinogen metabolism courses [ 6 ] .
human cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) enzymes play an important role in the metabolism of environment as well as drug chemicals .
numerous cyp enzymes could activate procarcinogens to genotoxic intermediates .
an association between cyp enzyme activity and the risk to develop cancer has been revealed by phenotyping analyses .
it has been demonstrated that many cyp enzymes are polymorphic owing to single nucleotide polymorphisms , gene duplications and deletions [ 7 ] .
cytochrome p4502e1 ( cyp2e1 ) is belonged to the member of the cytochrome p450 superfamily .
it is a phase i enzyme that could metabolically activate many kinds of carcinogens [ 8 , 9 ] .
n - nitrosamines are identified as carcinogens associated with the development of tumors of different sites [ 10 ] .
cyp2e1 gene is located on chromosome10q26.3 and is consist of nine exons and eight introns .
so far , over one hundred single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) have been reported ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / snp ) .
though , only a few polymorphisms which might alter the enzymatic activity of cyp2e1 have drawn interest [ 11 , 12 ] .
among cyp2e1 polymorphisms , rs3813867 g > c is associated with pst i restriction enzyme site while rs2031920 c > t accounts for rsa i restriction enzyme site .
the two polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium , which results in the cyp2e1 * 5 haplotype and three different genotypes : homozygous of normal alleles ( c1c1 , rsa i + / pst i - ) , heterozygous ( c1c2 ) and homozygous after nucleotide replacement ( c2c2 , rsa i - / pst i +)[ 13 ] .
several studies demonstrated that cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism is located in the promoter region of cyp2e1 gene and elevated the transcriptional activity of gene [ 14 ] .
another polymorphism ( rs6413432 ) recognized by dra i restriction enzyme located in intron 6 , namely cyp2e1 * 6 polymorphism , result in three distinct genotypes : cc , cd and dd [ 15 ] .
this polymorphism was reported to affect the transcription of the cyp2e1 gene [ 15 ] and was correlated with single strand breaks in dna [ 16 ] .
therefore , we select these two polymorphisms to explore the association between rsa i / pst i and drai and urinary cancer risk .
recently , the associations between cyp2e1 gene and urinary cancer risk were investigated .
however , the results from epidemiological studies were inconsistent and controversial [ 17 - 31 ] .
the study conducted by yang et al .
[ 26 ] found men with cyp2e1pst i / rsa i polymorphisms developed a decreased risk of prostate cancer .
additionally , the study by choi et al .
[ 23 ] confirmed that cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism would confer susceptibility to bladder cancer .
yet , several studies conducted by other teams [ 18 , 19 , 24 ] failed to find any association between cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms and the risk of urinary cancers .
the inconsistent conclusions could be attributed to the differences in patient ethnicity or insufficient sample size .
therefore , we collected published data to study the association between cyp2e1 rsai / psti and drai , and urinary cancer risk to illuminate current uncertain conclusions .
materials and methods literature search strategy we carried out a comprehensive search in the databases pubmed , elsevier , springerlink and cnki ( chinese national knowledge infrastructure ) without a language limitation , covering all the papers published up to oct 2016 .
the search strategy to identify all possible studies involved used combinations of the following key words : ( cytochrome p4502e1 or cyp2e1 ) and ( polymorphism or variant or allele or genotype ) and ( kidney or renal or urothelial or transitional cell carcinoma or bladder or prostatic or prostate ) .
a cited reference search of the retrieved papers was also conducted , and further publications were also identified by retrieving the bibliographies of the retrieved papers .
inclusion criteria data from studies were included in this meta - analysis only if the study met the following criteria : ( 1 ) the study should concern the association of cyp2e1 rsai / psti or dra i polymorphisms with urinary cancer risk ; ( 2 ) only the observational ( case - control or cohort ) studies in accordance with hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) were considered ; ( 3 ) the paper must indicate the sample size , odds ratios ( ors ) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) as well as the genetic distribution or the information that can help infer the results .
accordingly , papers that could not offer the source of cases and controls or other essential information were excluded ; reviews , editorial and comments were also excluded .
after rigorous searching , we reviewed all the papers based on the above criteria for further analysis .
data extraction data were carefully extracted from all the eligible publications by two investigators independently according to the inclusion criteria .
for each study , the following information was extracted from the study : name of first author , year of publication , region , ethnicity , gender , cancer types , matching criteria , the numbers of cases and controls with the three genotypes and genotyping methods .
when the essential information was not provided in articles , every effort was made to contact the authors .
in the case of conflicting evaluations , disagreements of included studies were resolved by discussion .
when a consensus cannot be reached , another author was to be consulted to resolve the dispute , and then a final decision was made based on a majority of votes .
statistical analysis hwe for cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms of control groups were extracted from the original publications .
in case of studies without reporting hwe status , the distributions of genotypes were tested for hwe using the chi - square test and results with p value > 0.05 were considered to be in accordance with hwe .
we then used chi - square test to calculate the genotype and allele difference of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms in caucasian and asian populations .
for cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms , we only assessed the risk in the dominant model and the allele model due to few frequencies of mutated genotypes in subjects .
afterwards , we performed subgroup meta - analysis according to the status of ethnicity and cancer type .
the pooled or with 95 % ci was calculated to evaluate the associations of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms with urinary cancer risk , using subjects with the homozygous common allele as the reference group .
the significance of the overall or was determined by the z - test .
cochran 's chi - square based q test [ 32 ] and i2 test [ 33 ] were adopted to evaluate possible heterogeneity in the combined studies .
the p < 0.10 or i2 value >= 50 % was considered to represent significant heterogeneity .
the random effects model ( the dersimonian - laird method ) , which yields wider confidence intervals , would be adopted to calculate the overall or value if the test of heterogeneity was significant [ 34 ] ; otherwise , the fixed effects model ( the mantel - haenszel method ) was adopted [ 35 ] .
publication bias is always of concern in a meta - analysis .
therefore , funnel plots were primarily drawn to evaluate potential publication bias and an asymmetric plot indicates a possible publication bias .
funnel plot asymmetry was further evaluated by begg 's test [ 36 ] with stata ( version 12.1 ) .
all of the statistical analyses were performed with revman ( version 5.0 , the cochrane collaboration ) and stata ( version 12.1 ) .
all the tests were two - sided and p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
results characteristics of studies there were a total of 44 studies preliminarily identified by searching the pubmed , elsevier , springer link and medline databases .
after screening titles and abstracts , 29 studies were identified to be relevant .
after full text searching , 15 studies were excluded .
according to the eligible criteria , three studies were discarded for insufficient data ( although we tried to contact the authors to query the data ) , two studies were discarded as being case - only studies and ten studies were discarded as being review articles .
finally , 14 studies were identified for the cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism , including a total of 3,301 cases and 3,786 controls , and for the drai polymorphism 5 studies were identified covering a total of 1,168 cases and 1,275 controls .
the flow diagram of selection strategy was shown in figure 1 .
the detailed characteristics of included studies were summarized in table 1 and table 2 .
among those 14 studies , six studies [ 17 - 20 , 24 , 31 ] included caucasians and eight studies [ 21 - 23 , 26 - 30 ] included participants of asian descent .
still , seven studies [ 17 - 20 , 22 , 28 , 29 ] only recruiting male subjects focused on prostate and bladder cancer , and seven [ 21 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 31 ] with both male and female participant on bladder or urothelial cancer .
the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) was the most common method used to analyze the genotype frequencies of these two polymorphisms .

frequency of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms in control population firstly , we evaluated the genotype and allele frequency distributions of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms between caucasian and asian control populations ( table 3 ) .
as for cyp2e1rsa i / pst i polymorphism , 1,730 controls of caucasian population and 1,652 controls of asian population were included in our analysis. with chi - square test , we found the frequency distributions of the genotypes and alleles for cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism were significantly different between caucasian and asian groups ( both p value < 0.001 ) .
as for cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism , the frequency distributions of the genotypes and alleles were also statistically significant between the caucasian and asian groups ( both p value < 0.001 ) .

main results of meta - analysis the main results about cyp2e1 rsai / psti polymorphism were summarized in table 4 .
the association between cyp2e1 rsai / psti polymorphism and the susceptibility of urinary cancers was based upon 14 studies ( table 4 , figure 2 ) .
we observed a significant difference in the dominant model ( c1c2 + c2c2 vs. c1c1 , or = 0.731 , 95 % ci = 0.681 - 0.790 , p < 0.001 ) as well as the allele model ( c2 vs. c1 , or = 0.793 , 95 % ci = 0.740 - 0.853 , p < 0.001 ) .
considering the ethnic discrepancy in the genotype / allele frequency of the polymorphism , we studied the impact of cyp2e1 rsai / psti in asian and caucasian population .
a significant difference in c1c2 + c2c2 vs. c1c1 and c2 vs. c1 among asians was observed , with the summarized ors being equal to 0.682 ( 95 % ci = 0.601 - 0.784 ) and 0.751 ( 95 % ci = 0.663 - 0.851 ) respectively .
however , we failed to observe any difference among caucasians in either dominant mode ( or = 0.889 , 95 % ci = 0.714 - 1.103 , p = 0.281 ) or allele model ( or = 0.921 , 95 % ci = 0.762 - 1.120 , p = 0.401 ) .
summarized ors for cyp2e1 rsai / psti stratified by cancer type were also evaluated .
we observed subjects with c1c2 / c2c2 genotype had decreased risk than those with c1c1 genotype for developing prostate , urothelial and bladder cancer , with the summarized ors being equal to 0.609 ( 95 % ci = 0.492 - 0.760 , p < 0.001 ) , 0.773 ( 95 % ci = 0.633 - 0.941 , p = 0.009 ) and 0.810 ( 95 % ci = 0.672 - 0.970 , p = 0.021 ) respectively .
consistently , similar results were observed with the allele model in the subgroup analysis considering cancer type .
subjects with the c2 allele had decreased susceptibility than those with the c1 allele for prostate , urothelial and bladder cancer , with the summarized ors being 0.710 ( 95 % ci = 0.562 - 0.910 , p = 0.007 ) , 0.794 ( 95 % ci = 0.660 - 0.943 , p = 0.007 ) and 0.832 ( 95 % ci = 0.712 - 0.971 , p = 0.020 ) , respectively .

the principle results of cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism were shown in table 5 .
the effect of cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism on the susceptibility of urinary cancers was analyzed on 5 case - control studies .
however , no significant association between cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism and urinary cancer susceptibility in either dominant model ( cd + cc vs. dd , or = 0.913 , 95 % ci = 0.791 - 1.051 , p = 0.202 ) or the allele model ( c vs. d , or = 0.978 , 95 % ci = 0.847 - 1.117 , p = 0.748 ) was showed .
further subgroup analysis considering ethnicity and cancer type was conducted .
we demonstrated that prostate cancer patients carrying cd / cc genotype had 0.66 - fold risk than patients with dd genotype ( or = 0.658 , 95 % ci = 0.479 - 0.907 , p = 0.011 ) .

heterogeneity , sensitivity and bias diagnosis in the meta - analysis , no significant heterogeneity was found in any of the comparisons ( p < 0.10 or i2 >= 50 %) , and all the p values and i2 values were listed in tables 4 and 5 .
one - way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of this meta - analysis [ 37 ] .
the statistical significance of the overall analyses did not vary even though any study was deleted from the overall data ( data not shown ) , indicating the stability of the results .
publication bias was firstly examined by using funnel plot analysis ( figure 4 ) .
as a consequence , the funnel plot presented symmetrical shape of for the overall analysis ; however , some uncertainty existed considering the symmetrical degrees were not satisfied .
therefore , the begg 's test was adopted to test the symmetry of funnel plot .
consistently , no publication bias was revealed considering the results of begg 's test ( p > 0.05 ) .

the vertical line indicated the pooled estimate of the overall or with the sloping lines representing the expected 95 % ci for a given se. discussion it is widely accepted that genetic susceptibility plays a key role in the development of urinary cancer , though the underlying mechanism of urinary cancer has not been clearly illuminated [ 4 , 5 ] .
a variety of genetic polymorphisms have been identified as risk factors for urinary cancer , some of which are found in the metabolism genes of carcinogens [ 38 , 39 ] .
cyp takes part in the oxidation of some chemicals and subsequently produce reactive free radicals which may lead to lipid peroxidation and carcinogenesis [ 40 ] .
as a member of the cyp super family , cyp2e1 participates in the metabolism process of many carcinogens including n - nitrosamines and aniline .
therefore , it affects the susceptibility of host to urinary cancer [ 41 , 42 ] .
for instance , cyp2e1 takes part in the metabolic activation of kinds of n - nitrosamines , which are tobacco - related carcinogens of bladder in experimental animals .
these enzymes can catalyze and activate the procarcinogens and ectogenous compounds in the beginning of metabolism , thereafter produce reactive metabolic intermediates and lead to genetic mutations [ 43 ] .
thus , cyp2e1 polymorphisms may have an impact on the development of urinary cancer .
according to previous reports , six restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) were resides in cyp2e1 gene [ 6 ] .
amongst them , the rsai / psti polymorphism in the 5 ' - flanking region as well as the dra i polymorphism in intron 6 may affect the susceptibility to urinary cancer based on their regulatory roles in cyp2e1 transcriptional activity [ 12 , 15 ] .
numerous studies were conducted to assess the impact of rsai / pst i and dra i polymorphism in the pathogenesis of urinary cancer ; however , no consistent findings were reported .
in the study , we conducted a meta - analysis of eligible studies to evaluate the association between cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and dra i polymorphisms and urinary cancer susceptibility .
as for cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism , the results have demonstrated the mutated allele c2 may have different effects in different cancer type [ 43 - 46 ] .
in recent two decades , several studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between cyp2e1 and urinary cancer with inconsistent conclusions [ 42 ] .
using 3,301 cases and 3,786 controls from 14 studies , we showed reduced urinary cancer risk in patients having cyp2e1 rsai / psti c1c2 + c2c2 genotype ( or = 0.73 , 95 % ci = 0.68 - 0.79 , p < 0.001 ) , comparing with the subjects carrying wide - type homozygous c1c1 genotype .
in the subgroup analyses sorted by cancer category , significant associations were found in prostate cancer , urothelial cancer as well as bladder cancer group .
furthermore , ethnicity may influence cyp2e1 activity through gene - gene interactions since it is an important biological factor [ 6 ] .
the allele frequency was significantly different between asians and caucasians , indicating the impact of ethnic diversity on the environment and genetic backgrounds .
in consistence with the study by wang et al .
[ 6 ] , c2 allele of cyp2e1 rsai / psti polymorphism is more common in orientals compared to the western population .
in consequence , further meta - analysis stratified by ethnicity was conducted , and the decreased or was found in the asians for cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphisms ( or = 0.682 , 95 % ci = 0.601 - 0.784 ) .
however , we failed to observe any significant difference in the caucasian populations , indicating that the risk in asians is more obvious , which may be caused by different genetic backgrounds and environmental factors .
however , the explicit reason accounting for the difference between asians and caucasians about gene - environment interactions is not clear now and need more studies to explore and deeper illustrate .
as for cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism , we identified five studies that had examined the relationship between cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism and urinary cancer .
the pooled result failed to identified any significant associations between cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism and the urinary cancer risk ( cd + cc vs. dd , or = 0.913 , 95 % ci = 0.791 - 1.051 , p = 0.202 ; c vs. d , or = 0.978 , 95 % ci = 0.847 - 1.117 , p = 0.748 ) .
further subgroup analysis sorted by the ethnicity and cancer category indicated that patients carrying cd / cc genotype had 0.658 - fold risk compared with patients with dd genotype to develop into prostate cancer ( or = 0.658 , 95 % ci = 0.479 - 0.907 , p = 0.011 ) .
nevertheless , no significant association was found for asians , caucasians and other cancer types in neither genetic model .
since sample size is a key factor for identifying risk factors , we may undervalue the association between dra i polymorphism and urinary cancer risk considering the limited quantity of eligible studies .
the relationship between clinical significance and these two polymorphisms has to be elucidated from the perspective of mechanism .
cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i was mapped to the 5 ' - flanking region of the human cyp2e1 gene .
according to hayashi et al. , the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( cat ) assay demonstrated the enhancement of expression by c2c2 , which was about 10 times than that by its c1c1 counterpart .
the dnase i sensitivities and protection profiles of the two genotypes were also different , with rsai polymorphism affecting the transcriptional activation of cyp2e1 as well as the binding capacity of transcription factor hnf - 1 , while the psti polymorphism having no impact [ 12 ] .
the study by persson et al. also found rsai polymorphism may affecting the binding of hnf - 1 to the 5 ' - flanking region [ 47 ] .
in addition , the impacts of different genotypes on the mrna expression of cyp2e1 were examined in 86 individuals by watanabe et al. , with the alcohol consumption being considered .
the expression of cyp2e1 mrna in genotype c1c2 was 1.7 - fold higher than that in genotype c1c1 in non - drinkers .
while subjects with genotype c1c2 who drank alcohol were 2.0 - fold higher than non - drinkers with genotype c1c1 [ 11 ] , suggesting that rsai polymorphism may result in individualized differences in cyp2e1 catalyzed oxidation activities .
as for another polymorphism cyp2e1 drai , the association between its allelic variant with the mrna expression level was briefly reported .
according uematsu et al. , the cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism might have an impact on the mrna expression of cyp2e1 [ 15 ] .
however , these studies are not detailed enough to explain all the clinical significance .
since cyp2e1 are relatively well conserved without common functional polymorphisms [ 48 ] , there exists another explanation that the polymorphisms might be in linkage disequilibrium to other polymorphisms that have impacts but the bases for any association to urinary cancer are presently obscure .
therefore , an adequate comprehension of the possible molecular factors and mechanisms underlying the observed results for urinary cancer is becoming an urgent priority .
this is the first meta - analysis assessing the association between cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i as well as dra i polymorphisms and the susceptibility of urinary cancers .
nevertheless , when interpreting the results of the meta - analysis , limitations must be taken into account .
firstly , only five studies with 1,168 cases and 1,275 controls reported the association between cyp2e1 dra i polymorphism and urinary cancer risk .
therefore , significant associations might be underpowered considering the limited studies involved .
more studies with larger sample size are necessary to get a more precise conclusion .
secondly , owing to the relatively low frequency of mutated alleles of cyp2e1 polymorphism in caucasians , we failed to distinguish any significant association in the caucasians subgroup [ 44 ] .
as a consequence , further studies evaluating the ethnic difference in the polymorphism on urinary cancer risk are in need .
thirdly , other important dmes may act as potential confounding factors contributing to urinary cancers , particularly n - acetyltransferases ( nats ) which could detoxify aromatic amines , an important class of bladder carcinogens in tobacco smoke and implicate in urinary cancers [ 49 ] and glutathione s - transferases ( gsts ) which protect susceptible person due to occupational and environmental factor from reactive metabolites [ 50 ] .
both enzymes were reported to contribute to bladder cancer in other ethnic groups ; thereby it may impact on our results as a potential confounding factor .
finally , the results applied in this meta - analysis were based on unadjusted estimates since we did not have access to most of the original data .
more detailed analysis adjusted by sex , age or lifestyle should be conducted to estimate the associations of cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i and drai polymorphisms with urinary cancer .
thus , it is required for the authors to share their data of all of the published papers .
in the present meta - analysis , we provided preliminarily genetic evidence that cyp2e1 rsa i / pst i polymorphism was related with the susceptibility of urinary cancers in asian population , though dra i polymorphism failed to contribute to the susceptibility of urinary cancers except for prostate cancer .
however , our findings have to be interpreted with caution due to several limitations .
studies involved large number of participants and more homogeneous cancer patients should be future conducted .

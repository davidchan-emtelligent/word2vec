objective x - linked dominant hypophosphatemia ( xlh ) is the most prevalent form of inherited rickets / osteomalacia in humans .
the aim of this study was to identify phex gene mutations and describe the clinical features observed in 6 unrelated chinese families and 3 sporadic patients with hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia .
methods for this study , 45 individuals from 9 unrelated families of chinese han ethnicity ( including 16 patients and 29 normal phenotype subjects ) , and 250 healthy donors were recruited .
all 22 exons and exon - intron boundaries of the phex gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and directly sequenced .
results the phex mutations were detected in 6 familial and 3 sporadic hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia .
altogether , 2 novel mutations were detected : 1 missense mutation c.1183g > c in exon 11 , resulting in p.gly395arg and 1 missense mutation c.1751a > c in exon 17 , resulting in p.his584pro .
no mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls .
conclusions our study increases knowledge of the phex gene mutation types and clinical phenotypes found in chinese patients with xlh , which is important for understanding the genetic basis of xlh .
the molecular diagnosis of a phex genetic mutation is of great importance for confirming the clinical diagnosis of xlh , conducting genetic counseling , and facilitating prenatal intervention , especially in the case of sporadic patients .

introduction hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia is characterized by defective renal phosphate re - absorption and abnormal bone mineralization [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
clinical features of the disease include short stature , bone and / or joint pain , lower extremity deformities , calcification of the ligaments , and dental abnormalities .
x - linked dominant hypophosphatemia ( xlh ) , autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets ( adhr ) , and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets ( arhr ) are the three main types of hypophosphatemic rickets and are associated with mutations in the phosphate - regulating endopeptidase gene ( phex ) , the fibroblast growth factor 23 gene ( fgf23 ) , and the dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein1 gene ( dmp1 ) , respectively .
xlh ( mim 307800 ) , which was first reported in 1939 [ 5 ] , is the most common genetic form of hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia and has an incidence rate of 3.9 - 5.0 per 100,000 [ 6 ] - [ 8 ] .
in familial hypophosphatemic rickets ( fhr ) , hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia can be inherited in either an x - linked autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner .
the most common disease - causing genetic mutations in these cases occur in the phex gene and cause 87 % of familial xlh and 72 % of the sporadic cases [ 9 ] .
xlh is characterized by renal phosphate wasting , which causes hypophosphatemia and normal to low 1,25 - dihydroxy - vitamin d3 serum levels [ 10 ] ; together , these indicate defects in phosphate and vitamin d metabolism .
the phex gene is located on chromosome xp22.1 , consists of 22 exons , spanning 220 kb with 6172 bp of transcript length , and encodes a membrane - bound metalloprotease composed of 749 amino acids [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
the phex protein shares a common overall structure with other members of the neutral endopeptidase family , including neprilysin , two endothelin - converting enzymes ( ece - 1 and - 2 ) , the kell antigen , and the damage - induced neuronal endopeptidase / x - converting enzyme [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] .
the structure consists of a short n - terminal intracellular region , a single n - terminal hydrophobic region that corresponds with the transmembrane domain , a highly conserved zinc - binding domain in exons 17 and 19 , and a large extracellular c - terminal domain [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] .
the phex protein is predominantly expressed in cartilage , osteoblasts , and odontoblasts but not in the kidney [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
although the exact mechanism of how phex mutations cause rickets / osteomalacia remains unknown , some studies have shown that phex may inactivate bone mineralization inhibitors and that one of the extraosseous consequences of phex inactivation includes an increase in the level of fgf - 23 [ 14 ] .
currently , 329 mutations in the phex gene have been reported in the phex mutation database ( http :// www.phexdb.mcgill.ca ; mar 17 12:35:21 2014 ) , which mostly occur in european ( northern european ) , north american , and far eastern populations .
according to the phex mutation database , the frequencies of the different types of mutations include the following : 27 % frameshifts , 19.8 % abnormal splicing , 19.4 % missense , 18 % nonsense , 28 % deletions , and 2.4 % polymorphisms .
however , only 14 mutations ( 2 deletion mutation , 3 nonsense mutations , 1 frameshift mutation , 3 donor splice site mutations , and 5 missense mutations ) in the phex gene have been reported in chinese patients with familial xlh [ 15 ] - [ 20 ] .
in this study , we identified phex gene mutations in chinese patients ( familial and sporadic ) with hypophosphatemic rickets / osteomalacia in order to elucidate the phex gene mutation types and clinical features observed in chinese patients .
materials and methods study subjects the department of osteoporosis and bone diseases recruited all of the subjects involved in the study over a 6 - year period .
all of the subjects were of chinese han ethnicity and had non - consanguineous parents .
diagnosis of xlh was based on clinical manifestations , radiology results , skeletal deformities , growth impairment , and laboratory results that indicated the occurrence of hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting .
altogether , 45 individuals including 16 patients from 9 unrelated chinese families were investigated in our study .
three patients were from family 4 .
family 7 , 8 and 9 had only 1 patient each .
the other families ( family 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 ) had 2 patients each .
the pedigrees of x - linked hypophosphatemic rickets are shown in figure 1 .
the fasting blood was collected from each of the subjects during a clinic visit and was analyzed in the central laboratory of shanghai jiaotong university affiliated sixth people 's hospital .
serum samples were used to measure calcium ( ca ) , phosphate ( p ) , parathyroid hormone ( pth ) concentrations , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) activity , and the serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin d [ 25 ( oh ) d ] level .
serum concentrations of ca , p and alp were measured by using hitachi 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer .
serum 25 ( oh ) d and pth were measured by eclia elecsys autoanalyzer ( e170 ; roche diagnostic gmbh , mannheim , germany ) .
the intra - assay coefficients of variation ( cvs ) for 25 ( oh ) d were 5.7 % at a level of 25.2 ng / ml , 5.7 % at a level of 39.9 ng / ml and 5.4 % at a level of 65.6 ng / ml , respectively .
the inter - assay cvs for 25 ( oh ) d were 9.9 % at a level of 25.2 ng / ml , 7.3 % at a level of 39.9 ng / ml and 6.9 % at a level of 65.6 ng / ml , respectively .
the intra - assay and inter - assay cvs were 1.4 % and 2.9 % , respectively , for pth .
all of the laboratory data were collected prior to treating the patients with surgery or medicine .

ethics statement the ethics committee of the shanghai jiaotong university affiliated sixth people 's hospital approved this study and the project was conducted following the terms of " declaration of helsinki " .
signatures confirming informed consent were obtained from the participating subjects before starting the project .
in addition , we obtained written informed consent from the parents on the behalf of the minor / children participants involved in our study .
mutation analysis genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the conventional phenol - chloroform extraction method .
we screened the phex gene completely for mutations in 16 patients , the other phenotype normal family members , and 250 healthy ethnically matched controls ( 125 males and 125 females , chinese han ethnicity ) .
the dna sequence for the phex gene was obtained from available online database ( ncbi reference sequence accession number : ng _ 007563.2 ; the mrna accession number : nm _ 000444.5. ) .
the pcr and sequencing primers were the same as we used in our previous study [ 18 ] .
all 22 exons and exon - intron boundaries in the phex gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .
hot start pcr reaction was performed in our study , and hotstar taq dna polymerase ( qiagen inc. ) was used for highly specific amplification in hot - start pcr reaction .
the cycling program of amplification was 95degreesc for 15 minutes ; 11 cycles of 94degreesc for 15 seconds , 62degreesc per cycle for 40 seconds , 72degreesc for 1 minutes ; 24 cycles of 94degreesc for 15 seconds , 57degreesc for 30 seconds , 72degreesc for 1 minute , 72degreesc for 2 minutes .
direct sequencing was performed using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit , version 3.1 ( applied biosystems , foster , ca , usa ) , and the cycling program of sequencing was 96degreesc for 1 minute ; 28 cycles of 96degreesc for 10 seconds , 50degreesc for 5 seconds , 60degreesc for 4 minutes .
the resulting pcr products were directly sequenced using an automated abi prism 3130 sequencer ( foster , ca ) .
meanwhile , once a mutation was detected , we performed pcr amplification in the same dna sample again by using hotstar hifidelity polymerase ( qiagen inc. ) for highly sensitive and reliable high - fidelity hot - start pcr .
then , the purified pcr product was sequenced from the other strand to further verify the mutation .
single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) were identified using polyphred ( http :// droog.mbt.washington.edu / poly _ get.html ) .
novel mutations were identified using hgmd ( http :// www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk /) .
mutations were confirmed using mutalyzer 2.0 ( http :// mutalyzer.nl / check ) .
the dna sequences obtained were aligned with homologous sequences that had been deposited into genbank using the cluxtalx 1.83 algorithm [ 16 ] .
mutation prediction polyphen - 2 [ 19 ] and sorting intolerant from tolerant ( sift ) were used to determine the functional effects of all the missense mutations in the phex gene [ 8 ] .
polyphen - 2 ( http :// genetics.bwh.harvard.edu / pph2 /) and sift ( http :// sift.jcvi.org / www / sift _ enst _ submit ) are tools that predict the possible impacts of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein using a straightforward physical comparative analysis [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] .
for polyphen - 2 , the following three empirically derived outcomes were used : most likely damaging ( with a high confidence level , the substitution will affect protein function or structure ) , possibly damaging ( the substitution is supposed to affect protein function or structure ) , and benign ( the substitution most likely lacks any phenotypic effect ) .
the sift score [ 8 ] , [ 25 ] represents the normalized probability that the amino acid change is tolerated .
the sift score < 0.05 are predicted to be deleterious .

in family 1 , the clinical diagnosis of xlh in the proband ( ii2 ) and her father ( i1 ) was confirmed by the detection of a nonsense mutation in codon 660 in exon 20 of the phex gene ( c.1980g > a ) , which results in the replacement of a tryptophan residue with a premature stop codon ( p.trp660x ) .
( the sequences of ii2 and i1 were shown in figure 3a and 3b , respectively ) .
in family 2 , a novel missense mutation was detected in the proband ( ii1 ) and her mother ( i2 ) in which a proline is substituted for a histidine at position 584 as a result of a mutation in exon 17 of the phex gene ( c.1751a > c ; p.his584pro ; figure 3c ) .
interestingly , the mother was harbouring another novel missense mutation in codon 395 in exon 11 of the phex gene ( c.1183g > c ) , which results in an arginine replacing a glycine ( p.gly395arg ; figure 3d ) .
in family 3 , sequence analysis of the proband ( i2 ) and her daughter ( ii2 ) revealed a nonsense mutation in codon 444 in exon 12 of the phex gene ( c.1332g > a ) , which results in a premature stop codon replacing a tryptophan residue ( p.trp444x ; figure 3e ) .
in family 4 , the proband ( iii2 ) , his mother ( ii2 ) , and his grandmother ( i2 ) carried a putative aberrant splicing mutation c.1646 - 2a > t in intron 15 at splicing acceptor sites ( figure 3f ) .
in family 5 , the proband ( ii1 ) and his mother ( i2 ) carried a putative aberrant splicing mutation c.1174 - 1g > a in intron 10 at splicing acceptor sites ( figure 3g ) .
in family 6 , the proband ( ii1 ) and her mother ( i2 ) carried a heterozygous deletion of one nucleotide ( a ) in codon 565 ( c.1694dela ) , which causes a phenylalanine to be substituted for a tyrosine at position 565 and replaces the next 5 amino acids with a stop codon ( exon 16 of the phex gene ; c.1694dela ; p.tyr565phefsx5 ; figure 3h ) .

to evaluate the consequence of the p.gly395arg and p.his584pro mutations , polyphen - 2 and sift analyses of the mutations were performed .
both mutations were predicted to be most likely damaging ( polyphen - 2 score of 0.98 and 0.99 , respectively. both sift score < 0.05 ) .
meanwhile , the aminoacid residues at p.395 and p.584 are highly conserved across 9 different biological species ( figure 4a and 4b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0097830.g004 figure 4 partial amino acid sequences of the phex gene from 9 species .
the amino acids at p.395 in exon 11 ( a ) and p.584 in exon 17 ( b ) are highly conserved in 9 different species .
discussion in this study , we identified 10 different phex mutations ( including 2 novel mutations ) in 16 patients from 9 unrelated families ( probands from family 7 , 8 , and 9 are sporadic patients ) with xlh and reported the different clinical features observed in these chinese patients .
the nonsense mutations p.trp660x in exon 20 , p.trp444x in exon 12 , and p.arg549x in exon 15 may result in the translation of truncated proteins that lack exons 20 to 22 , exons 12 to 22 , and exons 15 to 22 , respectively .
four cysteine residues are located within this c - terminal region and are highly conserved in the phex protein [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] .
these 4 cysteine residues are most likely involved in disulfide bond formation , and losing them could result in a defective secondary protein structure that could greatly inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein .
therefore , of all of the mutations detected in this study , these 3 mutations are the most likely to affect the function of the phex protein .
it is known that approximately 27 % of the mutations in the phex gene are nonsense mutations [ 26 ] .
after searching the phex mutation database , 15 mutations were detected in exon 20 [ 18 ] , indicating that exon 20 may be a mutational hotspot .
two novel missense mutations were detected in family 2 : p.his584pro in exon 17 and p.gly395arg in exon 11 .
the phex gene contains 10 highly conserved cysteine residues , all of which are located in a very large extracellular domain .
these cysteine residues may be involved in disulfide bond formation and protein folding [ 24 ] .
the p.his584pro and p.gly395arg mutations affect 2 of these cysteine residues .
mutations at both sites would most likely result in changes to the protein structure and would result in the loss of protein function .
additionally , glycine ( g ) and proline ( p ) are non - polar hydrophobic amino acids , and arginine ( r ) and histidine ( h ) are polar alkaline hydrophilic amino acids .
therefore , it is predicted that substituting g with r and h with p will alter the biochemical properties at these positions .
furthermore , p.his584pro and p.gly395arg are non - conservative , affect evolutionarily highly conserved amino acids from nine different species ( fig. 4 ) and were predicted in silico by all bioinformatic tools used to be of pathogenic relevance ( polyphen - 2 score of 0.98 and 0.99 , respectively. both sift score < 0.05 ) .
the proband 's mother ( i2 ) in family 2 carried both mutations ( p.his584pro and p.gly395arg ) , therefore has more severe phenotypes than her daughter .
these phenotypic symptoms included a lower blood phosphorus level , an earlier onset age , odontodysplasia , delayed dentition , and teeth falling out at the age of 22 years .
two deletion mutations were identified in our study .
one deletion mutation was p.tyr565phefsx5 in exon 16 .
this mutation consists of a heterozygous deletion of one nucleotide ( a ) in codon 565 ( c.1694dela ) , which leads to a phenylalanine substitution for a tyrosine at p.565 and a subsequent premature truncation at p.570 , which results in a nonfunctioning phex product .
the other mutation is an insertion - deletion mutation , c.2077 _* 4delinsa .
in this mutation , 16 nucleotides ( tggtgcaattagtaac ) from codon 718 to codon 723 are deleted and 1 nucleotide ( a ) is inserted at p.n718 , which results in 6 amino acids missing from p.n718 to p.n723 and a lysine insertion ( at codon 718 ) .
these changes most likely alter the biochemical properties at these positions and affect the phex protein function .
three splice site mutations were identified in our study .
splice site mutations at introns 10 , 15 , and 17 ( ivs10 - 1g > a , ivs15 - 2a > t , and ivs17 + 2t > g , respectively ) were predicted to cause exons 11 , 16 , and 18 to be skipped , respectively .
these changes would result in a reading frame shift and truncated proteins .
the phex gene mutations in the 3 sporadic patients ( probands from family 7 , 8 , and 9 ) were not inherited from their parents and are most likely de novo mutations .
these types of mutations are caused by a mutation in the germ cell or germ cell mosaicism in the gonads of one of the parents or by a mutation in the fertilized egg itself .
studies have shown that male mutation bias frequently occurs among higher organisms , and in humans , the male to female bias ratio is approximately 6 to 1 because of differences in male and female gamete formation [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] .
furthermore , the male germline accumulates more dna replication errors because of the higher number of germline cell divisions in males than females [ 28 ] .
therefore , phex mutagenesis in paternal germ cells is likely more frequent in sporadic patients and would only affect the female offspring [ 24 ] , [ 29 ] , which is accordance with our finding from family 9 ( proband iii1 is female ) .
interestingly , however , that the 2 sporadic patients ( probands from family 7 and 8 ) in our study are males , which differs from the demographics in previous studies .
this finding indicates that the mutated phex alleles in sporadic male patients probably resulted from the mutagenesis in the x chromosome of the maternal germ cell. from our study , there are no significant differences of gene mutation types and mutation locations in the phex gene in chinese xlh patients compare to non - chinese patients .
however , the same mutations in different races can cause different clinical features .
for example , p.trp444x was firstly reported by beck - nielsen ss , et al .
[ 30 ] in a sporadic patient , a danish male , with a normal height , mild skeletal and endodontic phenotype .
whereas , in our study , the mutation was found in familial patients with abnormal gait , kyphosis , and hip and knee joint pain .
in addition , we identified that the proband and her daughter carried the non - sense mutation ( p.trp444x ) which consisted of a heterozygous g to a transition at c.1332 in exon 12 , while , the mutation reported by beck - nielsen ss , et al. is c.1331g > a affecting one nucleotide upstream the one described in our manuscript ( c.1332g > a ) .
although , the result is the same at the protein level with a tryptophan at position 444 being substituted by a stop codon and truncation at p .
444 , the clinical features are quite different in chinese patients compare to non - chinese patients .
although , no evident genotype phenotype correlation could be established in our study , 2 novel mutations were detected and different clinical features were described .
therefore , functional studies investigating the phex gene mutation should be performed to elucidate the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype .

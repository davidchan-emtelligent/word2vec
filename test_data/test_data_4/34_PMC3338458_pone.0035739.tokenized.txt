metabolic syndrome ( ms ) is a constellation of metabolic derangements associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress and is widely regarded as an inflammatory condition , accompanied by an increased risk for cardiovascular disease .
the present study tried to investigate the implications of telomerase activity with inflammation and impaired endothelial function in patients with metabolic syndrome .
telomerase activity in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) , tnf - alpha , il - 6 and adma were monitored in 39 patients with ms and 20 age and sex - matched healthy volunteers .
telomerase activity in pbmc , tnf - alpha , il - 6 and adma were all significantly elevated in patients with ms compared to healthy volunteers .
pbmc telomerase was negatively correlated with hdl and positively correlated with adma , while no association between tnf - alpha and il - 6 was observed .
il - 6 was increasing with increasing systolic pressure both in the patients with ms and in the healthy volunteers , while smoking and diabetes were positively correlated with il - 6 only in the patients' group .
in conclusion , in patients with ms characterised by a strong dyslipidemic profile and low diabetes prevalence , significant telomerase activity was detected in circulating pbmc , along with elevated markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction .
these findings suggest a prolonged activity of inflammatory cells in the studied state of this metabolic disorder that could represent a contributory pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
introduction metabolic syndrome ( ms ) is a constellation of metabolic derangements commonly coexisting in the same patient that has reached epidemic proportions [ 1 ] .
a cluster of cardiovascular and pro - thrombotic risk factors , such as insulin resistance , impaired glucose tolerance , dyslipidemia , obesity and elevated blood pressure characterize ms. ms is reported to be associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and oxidative internal milieu [ 2 ] and is widely regarded as an inflammatory condition [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , accompanied by an increased risk for cardiovascular disease [ 5 ] .
ms represents a combination of synergistic vascular pathologies that lead to an accelerated atherogenic state that compromises the ability of the patient to satisfactorily respond to humoral , cellular , and mechanical stresses .
endothelial dysfunction with impaired nitric oxide ( no ) bioavailability has been implicated in insulin resistance and hypertension .
asymmetric dimethyl arginine ( adma ) is linked to the impairment of endothelial , no - dependent , function by inhibiting endogenous nitric oxide synthetase in a concentration - dependent manner , and has been associated with cardiovascular diseases [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
telomerase activity is crucial for preservation of telomeres' function and structure [ 9 ] .
telomeres , the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes , are structures strictly related to the phenomenon of cellular senescence [ 10 ] .
cellular senescence occurs after an extended period of cell divisions , but it can occur earlier in case the cell is exposed to various types of stresses , oxidative stress being one of them [ 9 ] .
telomerase activity may also be interrelated to inflammation , especially in cell types like peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) implicated in this process [ 11 ] .
soluble cd163 ( scd163 ) represents a monocyte / macrophage - specific scavenger receptor cleaved under the effect of inflammatory stimuli and subsequently released systemically from monocyte / macrophage cell membranes , suggesting that scd163 is a marker of monocyte / macrophage activation [ 12 ] .
the present study tried to investigate the implications of telomerase activity with inflammation and impaired endothelial function in patients with metabolic syndrome .
methods participants patients were classified based on the presence or absence of ms at baseline using the aha / nhlbi definition [ 13 ] : triglycerides >= 150 mg / dl ; high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl ) < 40 mg / dl in males or < 50 mg / dl for females ; blood pressure ( bp ) >= 130 / 85 mm hg or treatment with antihypertensive medications ; and fasting blood glucose >= 100 mg / dl or treatment with oral hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin injection ; waist circumference >= 102 cm ( men ) , >= 88 cm ( women ) .
patients who had 3 of 5 criteria were regarded as having ms. thirty nine ( 39 ) patients with ms treated on a regular basis at the " amalia fleming " general hospital in athens , greece , volunteered to participate in the study .
twenty ( 20 ) age and sex - matched healthy volunteers were also used as reference for normal population values of tnf - alpha , il - 6 , adma and telomerase activity that were monitored .
description of procedures or investigations undertaken in the morning and after an at - least - 30 - min supine rest , non - fasting venous blood samples were drawn from all patients and healthy volunteers , centrifugated within 30 min and stored at - 20degreesc .
serum samples were later analysed for adma using an adma - elisa kit ( dld ) ( sensitivity 0.05 micromol / l , upper limit of the working range 5.0 micromol / l , mean intra - assay variation 6.05 %) .
tnf - alpha and il - 6 were measured using the immulite ( r ) 1000tnf - alpha ( sensitivity 1.7 pg / ml , upper limit of the working range 1000 pg / ml , mean intra - assay variation 3.2 %) and immulite ( r ) 1000il - 6 ( sensitivity 2 pg / ml , upper limit of the working range 1000 pg / ml , mean intra - assay variation 4.65 %) assays ( siemens ) .
scd163 was determined using an elisa kit from trillium diagnostics as previously described [ 12 ] .
the method for detection of telomerase activity and isolation of pbmc is described elsewhere [ 14 ] .
briefly , telomerase activity in pbmc was measured using a commercial telomerase pcr - elisa ( roche diagnostics corp. , indianapolis , in , usa ) , based on the telomeric repeat amplification protocol [ 15 ] .
ethics written informed consents were obtained from all participants .
the research ethics committee of the " amalia fleming " hospital approved the procedures .
the declaration of helsinki ( 2000 ) and the applicable national standards as they relate to the involvement of human subjects in research were enforced .
no external funding was received for this study .
statistical methods all results are presented as mean values +/ - sd. statistical analyses were performed with spss version 14 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
significant differences between means for the same parameters were investigated with repeated measures anova and paired t - test analyses .
independent t - tests were used to compare mean values between groups .
pearson and spearman correlations and linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate associations between various variables .
differences between categorical variables were assessed by the chi - square test .
multiple linear regression analyses after log transformation of the dependent variable , since the distribution was skewed , were performed to evaluate the relationship between pbmc telomerase activity and factors associated with the development of cardiovascular risk ( hypertension , diabetes , smoking , hyperlipidemia , waist circumference ) .
multiple linear regression analyses with backward selection was applied to investigate the correlation between pbmc telomerase activity and adma .
a list of possible confounders ( hypertension , diabetes , smoking , hyperlipidemia , waist circumference ) was included in the initial variables set .
a p - value <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results thirty - nine patients ( mean age 54 +/ - 9.9 years ) were included in the study .

telomerase activity in pbmc , tnf - alpha , il - 6 , scd163 and adma were all significantly elevated in patients with ms compared to healthy volunteers .
upon analysis of all patients with ms for factors associated with the development of cardiovascular risk by multiple linear regression , significant negative correlations were only found between pbmc telomerase activity and hdl ( r = - 0.653 , p = 0.021 and waist circumference ( r = - 0.621 , p = 0.031 ) .
pbmc telomerase activity was also positively correlated with adma ( r = 0.604 , p = 0.038 ) and scd163 ( r = 0.556 , p = 0.044 ) , while no association between tnf - alpha and il - 6 and pbmc telomerase activity was observed .
scd163 were nearly significantly correlated with adma ( r = 0.445 , p = 0.058 ) and tnf - alpha ( r = 0.301 , p = 0.064 ) .
tnf - alpha was found statistically increased in females compared to males only in the patients group .
telomerase activity , il - 6 and adma levels did not differ with sex .
it should be noted , though , that the average age of women enrolled in the patients' group ( 51.7 +/ - 5.45 years ) was statistically higher ( p = 0.022 ) compared to the healthy volunteers ( 35.6 +/ - 5.18 years ) and did not differ from the average age of male patients ( 54.5 +/ - 10.9 years ) .
women above the average age of menopause ( 51 years ) [ 16 ] are losing with increasing age the anti - inflammatory and vasoprotective effects of estrogens [ 17 ] .
waist circumference was again negatively correlated to tnf - alpha ( r = 0.613 , p = 0.019 ) .
il - 6 was increasing with increasing systolic pressure both in the patients with ms and in the healthy volunteers ( r = 0.354 , p = 0.047 ) , while smoking and diabetes were positively correlated with il - 6 only in the patients' group .
discussion to the authors' knowledge , this is the first study to report on elevated telomerase activity in pbmc of patients with ms. previous studies on haemodialysis and diabetic patients [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ 20 ] have found lower pbmc telomerase activity suggesting that in a cell type like pbmc , which is directly implicated in the inflammatory process , it is generally expected a pre - mature senescence for a higher inflammatory activity [ 21 ] .
on the other hand , pbmc telomerase levels measured in our study are comparable with those recently reported for overweight african americans [ 22 ] .
furthermore , ms may be an important contributory factor for coronary artery disease through increased oxidative stress and induces subclinical atherosclerosis [ 2 ] .
in that sense our results coincide with those reported on elevated polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmn ) telomerase in patients with unstable angina [ 23 ] and suggest a systemic activation of blood cells of the immune system .
garlichs et al .
[ 24 ] have recently observed a marked delay of circulating pmn apoptosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes .
activated pbmc telomerase in ms patients could represent a consistent and persisting inflammation state , as neutrophil apoptosis has been identified to be one of the key mechanism to switch off inflammation [ 23 ] .
in the same line of evidence , gizard et al. found activated telomerase in macrophages [ 25 ] .
recently , a significant role in the regulation of the immune response accompanying atherosclerosis has been ascribed to interactions between activated t cells , promoting the expression of systemic inflammatory response factors participating in atherogenesis , such as tnf - alpha and il - 6 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
both tnf - alpha and il - 6 were found elevated in the ms patients of the present study , which is in accordance with the vascular biology described for ms [ 5 ] .
tnf - alpha does n't seem to correlate either with insulin resistance or with endothelial dysfunction in men with ms [ 28 ] .
in the present study no association between tnf - alpha and il - 6 and pbmc telomerase activity was observed probably due to different and multi - factorial underlying activation mechanisms possibly involving endothelial damage and oxidative stress .
furthermore , systemic cytokines levels may underestimate local inflammation .
the elevation of scd163 reported in our ms patients provides new information that the increased telomerase activity in pmbcs coexists with monocyte / macrophage activation .
a recent study has revealed that monocyte / macrophage activation , as reflected by scd163 levels , is strongly associated with homa - ir in normal - weight and obese subjects and thus may be an important determinant of insulin resistance in obesity [ 12 ] .
numerous metabolic abnormalities found in the metabolic syndrome cause an endothelial cell dysfunction by affecting no synthesis or degradation [ 29 ] .
there is evidence that no possesses anti - inflammatory and anti - atherosclerotic properties [ 30 ] .
adma increases in ms [ 6 ] , although ethnic - specific or environmental differences may influence its levels [ 31 ] .
we currently report strong positive correlation of pbmc telomerase activity with elevated serum adma in the ms patients of the present study .
an adma - induced cycle of pmn activation has recently been reported [ 32 ] .
furthermore , endothelial impairment and activation of telomerase are both enhanced through the nf - kappab transcription factor action : endothelial adhesion molecules are expressed in mononuclears in atherosclerotic lessions , with the current mediation of tnf - alpha pro - inflammatory effect [ 33 ] and the expression of the catalytic subunit telomerase reverse transcriptase ( tert ) is induced in macrophage [ 25 ] .
the nearly significant correlation of elevated scd163 with adma and tnf - alpha in our ms patients could support the view that endothelial dysfunction through mediated tnf - alpha mechanisms lies behind the reported prolonged pbmc life cycle .
in line with this conclusion , satoh et al. reported significant shortening of telomere length , correlated with oxidative dna damage , in endothelial progenitor cells ( epc ) of patients suffering from coronary artery disease ( cad ) , this being even more intense in cad patients with ms , inducing endothelial cell senescence and dysfunction [ 34 ] .
damage to the endothelium may thus be the key factor in the promotion of the atherogenic and inflammatory process in ms. the high anti - oxidant and anti - inflammatory activities of hdl , which are associated with protection from cardiovascular disease [ 35 ] have become evident in the present study through the negative correlation found with pbmc telomerase activity .
the association of telomerase activity with anthropometric measures , such as waist circumference and bmi , remains unclear in the literature [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] and the negative correlations of waist circumference with pbmc telomerase activity and tnf - alpha observed in our ms patients needs to be further elucidated .
cardiovascular risk factors , such as smoking and hypertension do n't correlate with pbmc telomerase activity , in agreement with previously published data [ 23 ] , but strongly affect il - 6 in the present study .
in conclusion , in patients with ms with a strong dyslipidemic profile and low diabetes prevalence , significant telomerase activity was detected in the circulating pbmc , along with elevated markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction .
these findings suggest a prolonged activity of inflammatory cells in the studied state of this metabolic disorder that could represent a contributory pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
further studies are warranted in order to establish the precise prognostic value of telomerase reactivation in ms. competing interests : the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

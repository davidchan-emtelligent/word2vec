we assessed the association between electronic cigarette ( e - cigarette ) use and peer cigarette smoking , a major risk factor for the initiation of cigarette smoking in adolescents .
data from the 2013 korea youth risk behavior web - based survey of 65,753 nonsmokers aged 13 - 18 years were analyzed using multiple logistic regression .
a total of 3.8 % of the korean adolescents were ' ever e - cigarette ' users and 1.2 % were current users .
adjusted odds ratios ( ors ) for current and ever e - cigarette use compared to those whose closest friends were non - smokers ranged from 2.05 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.82 - 2.30 ) to 5.50 ( 95 % ci , 4.77 - 6.34 ) , and from 2.23 ( 95 % ci , 1.77 - 2.81 ) to 7.82 ( 95 % ci , 5.97 - 10.25 ) for those who had ' some ' close friends to ' most / all ' friends who smoked , respectively .
the slopes of the adjusted ors for e - cigarette use in ' never smokers' were more than twice as steep as those in ' former smokers ' , showing a significant interaction effect between the proportion of smoking closest friends and cigarette smoking status ( never or former smokers ) ( p < 0.001 for interaction ) .
peer cigarette smoking had a significant association with e - cigarette use in adolescent nonsmokers , and this association was greater on never smokers than former smokers .

introduction since the development of electronic cigarettes ( e - cigarettes ) in early 2000 and their introduction as an alternative to cigarettes , scientific evidences on their safety , smoking cessation effects , and adverse reactions have been accumulating [ 1 - 3 ] .
nevertheless , the e - cigarette market has grown rapidly through aggressive marketing using mass media such as the internet [ 1,4 - 6 ] .
in particular , e - cigarette companies are expanding the e - cigarette market primarily by targeting and marketing to adolescents and other young age groups through sponsorship of youth - oriented events , the development of e - cigarette flavors that appeal to youth , and lax youth e - cigarette purchase accessibility through online and offline stores [ 7,8 ] .
according to the united states national youth tobacco survey ( nyts ) , ' ever e - cigarette ' use in high school students doubled in 1 year from 4.7 % in 2011 to 10.0 % in 2012 [ 9 ] while the estimated number of adolescent ever e - cigarettes users among ' never cigarette smokers' more than tripled from 79,000 in 2011 to 263,000 in 2013 [ 10 ] .
mcmillen et al. reported that the prevalence of current e - cigarette use in the 18 - 24 age group in the u.s. was 0.0 % in 2010 , but increased to 14.2 % in 2013 [ 11 ] .
both the prevalence and margin of increase in the 18 - 24 age group were higher than for higher age groups .
the 2013 canadian tobacco , alcohol and drugs survey reported that younger age groups ( 15 - 24 years old ) had higher current and ever e - cigarette use than older age groups ( greater than 25 years old ) .
these studies indicate that younger age groups have greater exposure to e - cigarettes [ 12 ] .
even if the continued debate about the efficacy of e - cigarettes as an alternative to cigarettes is excluded , the hypothesis that e - cigarettes are a gateway drug to cigarettes in nonsmokers has been proposed as a problem associated with e - cigarettes [ 5,13,14 ] .
according to bunnell et al .
[ 10 ] , intention to smoke cigarettes was 1.7 times higher in e - cigarette ever users than e - cigarette never users among adolescent never smokers .
dutra et al .
[ 15 ] also reported that adolescent e - cigarette users showed high odds ratios ( ors ) for current or ever cigarette smoking .
according to lee et al .
[ 16 ] , the or of adolescent current e - cigarette users for current cigarette smokers was 64.9 times higher than that of e - cigarette never users .
the nyts study also supported the hypothesis [ 17 ] that e - cigarette ever users were more open to future cigarette smoking .
recent longitudinal studies in us and swiss also supported that adolescent e - cigarette users were more likely to be cigarette smokers at follow - up assessments ( 6 or 12 month after baseline ) [ 18 - 21 ] .
therefore , it is important to prevent adolescent never smokers from initiating e - cigarette use or former smokers from reinitiating cigarette smoking through e - cigarette use .
to do so , it is necessary to identify the nonsmoker groups who are more likely to use e - cigarettes .
given that friends' cigarette smoking is a strong predictor of smoking initiation in adolescents [ 22 - 24 ] , this peer influence is also suspected to significantly influence e - cigarette use in nonsmoking adolescents .
however , there are few studies on this topic .
to the best of our knowledge , the only cohort study on e - cigarette use related to peer group smoking is from germany .
this study reported that the or of ever e - cigarette use in participants with smoker friends was 2.06 times ( overall , including both former smokers and never smokers ) or 1.78 times ( never smokers ) higher than in participants with no smoker friends [ 25 ] .
in the u.s. , a cross - sectional study of psychosocial factors for e - cigarette use showed that both e - cigarette and cigarette use among friends were strongly associated with current e - cigarette use in adolescents .
the study showed that the ors for current e - cigarette use increased with increasing number of friends who smoked tobacco products and ranged from 104 times ( 3 or 4 out of 4 closest friends smoked e - cigarettes ) or 11.2 times ( 3 or 4 out of 4 closest friends smoked cigarettes ) higher than those with no closest friends who smoked e - cigarettes or cigarettes [ 26 ] .
however , the previous two studies were limited because they did not consider the effects of prior cigarette experience on e - cigarette use .
cigarette smoking status categorized as current , former or never smoker is not only closely associated with factors related to e - cigarette use but is in itself a strong risk factor for e - cigarette use [ 11,16,27 ] .
therefore , smoking status should be considered when analyzing factors related to e - cigarette use .
it is difficult to disentangle the impact of peer cigarette smoking and cigarette smoking status on youth e - cigarette use .
in order to remedy this issue , and account for the effect of cigarette smoking status , it is necessary to restrict analyses of the impact of peer smoking on e - cigarette use to non - current smokers and to stratify these analyses into never and former cigarette smoking youth .
therefore , we used nationally representative data from korean adolescents to investigate the association between peer cigarette smoking and e - cigarette use by nonsmokers and determine whether such association are also dependent on past cigarette experience .
materials and methods study population data were analyzed from the 10th korea youth risk behavior web - based survey ( kyrbs - x ) conducted in 2014 by the korea centers for disease control and prevention .
the kyrbs is a nationally representative , self - reported , and anonymous online survey that was administered to korean students enrolled in grades 7 to 12 .
the kyrbs uses a stratified multistage probability sampling design to produce nationally representative statistics on health behaviors in korean adolescents .
a total of 72,060 students from 799 schools ( 400 middle schools and 399 high schools ) completed the kyrbs - x ( response rate = 97.2 %) [ 28 ] .
additional details about the sampling methodology and survey procedure are available elsewhere [ 29 ]. after excluding current smokers , the study population included 65,753 nonsmokers ( 7,660 former smokers and 58,093 never smokers ) .
here , nonsmokers were defined as adolescents who reported not smoking in the past month .
this secondary data analysis was exempt from review by the institutional review board of the daegu catholic university medical center ( cr - 15 - 084 ) .
measures e - cigarette use the e - cigarette use outcome variable was evaluated in two ways for current and ever e - cigarette use .
first , ever e - cigarette use was defined as a " yes " response to the following question : " have you ever used e - cigarettes ?" second , among ever smokers , participants who selected " yes " to the question " during the past 30 days , have you used e - cigarettes ?" were considered current e - cigarette users .
smoking - related factors peer cigarette smoking was assessed using responses to the following question : " do any of your closest friends smoke tobacco ?" participants were provided with four possible answers : 1 ) none of them , 2 ) some of them , 3 ) most of them , and 4 ) all of them .
here , because the sample size of the ' all ' group ( 0.8 %) was too small to be separately categorized , this group and the ' most ' group ( 5.0 %) were combined ( most / all ) .
cigarette smoking status among nonsmokers was classified into former smokers or never smokers using a composite measure of the two questions : " have you ever tried cigarette smoking , even one or two puffs ?" and " during the past 30 days , how many days did you smoke , even one puff ?" those who answered " yes " to the first question and " had not smoked in the past 30 days " to the second question were classified as former smokers .
those who answered " no " to the first question were classified as never smokers .
participants with a family member such as a parent , sibling , or grandparent who currently smoked cigarettes were considered to be living with a household member that used tobacco .
other characteristics other covariates were categorized into two domains : sociodemographic and lifestyle .
sociodemographic variables included sex , school type ( middle school , general high school , or vocational high school ) , region of residence ( metropolitan city , city , or province ) , and perceived academic performance ( high , middle , or low ; classified using the question , " during the past 12 months , how would you rate your academic performance ?") .
lifestyle and psychosocial factors included frequency of alcohol drinking per month ( never , less than 6 times , or 6 or more times ) , experience of drug use ( yes or no ; classified using the question , have you ever taken a drug or inhaled butane gas / bond habitually or intentionally ) , and perceived stress level ( low , middle , or high ; classified using the question , " how much stress do you usually feel ?") .
statistical analysis multivariate logistic regression was conducted to estimate the relationship between peer cigarette smoking and e - cigarette use after adjusting for covariates including sex , school , location , perceived academic performance , alcohol intake , drug experience , perceived stress level , cigarette smoking status , and current smoking household member .
in order to assess the association with peer cigarette smoking from the perspective of both simple smoking experience and current e - cigarette use , two different models were used to assess risk factors for current and ever e - cigarette use .
because cigarette smoking status is closely associated with e - cigarette use , an interaction model between peer cigarette smoking and cigarette smoking status was used to estimate the association between peer cigarette smoking and e - cigarette use according to cigarette smoking status .
all analyses were performed using spss version 19.0 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) and a p - value of < 0.05 was considered significant .
complex spss sampling procedures were used to accurately represent the adolescent population in korea .
results among adolescent nonsmokers , 3.8 % and 1.2 % were ever and current e - cigarette users , respectively .
ever e - cigarette use was significantly higher in former smokers ( 19.9 % vs. 1.6 % for never smokers ; p < 0.01 ) and in those with a current smoking household member ( 4.2 % vs. 3.2 % ; p < 0.01 ) .
current e - cigarette use was also significantly higher in former smokers ( 6.3 % vs. 0.5 % in never smokers ; p < 0.01 ) and those with a current smoking household member ( 1.3 % vs. 1.1 % ; p < 0.05 ) .
the prevalence of ever or current e - cigarette use significantly increased as the proportion of closest friend smokers increased ( p < 0.01 ) .
therefore , 19.8 % or 8.7 % of nonsmokers with most / all smoking closest friends were ever or current e - cigarette users , respectively. with the exception of location , all other well - known risk factors for cigarette smoking or e - cigarette use were significantly associated with e - cigarette use ( table 1 ) .

a reference group for calculating adjusted odds ratio is never e - cigarette use .
the prevalence of e - cigarette use increased steadily with an increase in the proportion of smoking closest friends among both never smokers and former smokers .
under the same condition of the proportion of smoking closest friends , the prevalence of ever or current e - cigarette use was consistently higher in former smokers than never smokers .
however , the rate of increase of e - cigarette use prevalence in never smokers was greater than that in former smokers .
in particular , while the prevalence of ever e - cigarette use in former smokers increased 3.3 times ( from 10.95 % in those with no smoking closest friends to 36.61 % in those with most / all closest friends ) , it increased 15.5 times ( from 0.68 % to 10.57 %) in never smokers ( fig 1 ) .

regardless of cigarette smoking experience , the adjusted ors for current or ever e - cigarette use increased significantly with increasing proportion of smoking closest friends in never smokers ( p < 0.001 for trend ) .
this significant association was also present in former smokers .
however , a significant interaction between the proportion of smoking closest friends and cigarette smoking status was observed in both ever and current e - cigarette use models ( p < 0.001 for interaction ) and the slopes of the adjusted ors for current or ever e - cigarette use in never smokers were more than twice as steep as those in former smokers ( fig 2 ) .

specifically , the adjusted ors in interaction terms for former x most / all ( ever e - cigarette use , 0.39 ; current e - cigarette use , 0.26 ) were lower than those for former x some ( ever e - cigarette use , 0.69 ; current e - cigarette use , 0.54 ) ( table 3 ) .

discussion this study showed that the proportion of closest friends who smoked had a significant relationship with e - cigarette use in adolescent nonsmokers .
both ever and current e - cigarette use increased significantly as the proportion of closest friend smokers increased , regardless of past smoking experience .
this finding is consistent with results from a german cohort study that indicated peer cigarette smoking affected lifetime e - cigarette use [ 25 ] .
furthermore , our results suggest that in adolescents peer group cigarette smoking plays an important role in not only cigarette smoking but also in e - cigarette use .
in particular , considering that the adjusted or of peer group cigarette smoking was higher among the analyzed variables , the results were consistent with previous results that indicated peer group cigarette smoking can have a significant influence on various types of adolescent smoking such as smokeless tobacco [ 30 , 31 ] .
in a longitudinal study conducted with 12 - year - old adolescents in the united states , as friend compliance ( measured with the following question ; " i do what my friends want me to do , even if i really do n't want to. ") increased , the use of smokeless tobacco also increased [ 32 ] .
in addition , another cross - sectional study of u.s. adolescents showed that approval and use of e - cigarettes and cigarettes among friends were strongly associated with e - cigarette use [ 26 ] .
these findings suggest that not only directly assessed peer smoking but also perceived peer influence or psychosocial factors regardless of cigarette use can influence the use of cigarette alternatives including e - cigarettes .
in addition to peer group cigarette smoking acting as a direct pathway to adolescent cigarette smoking , an alternative or indirect pathway to adolescent cigarette smoking can occur via e - cigarette use .
several longitudinal studies among adolescents or young adults in us or swiss reported recently that e - cigarette use in adolescent non - smokers or never - smokers was closely associated with both willingness to smoke and smoking initiation [ 18 - 21 ] .
moreover , this phenomenon can be accelerated by the renormalization strategy from aggressive e - cigarette marketing .
in the past several decades , efforts have been made to establish desirable social norms about smoking through denormalization strategies , which are main strategies used in global tobacco control [ 33 ] .
tobacco industry denormalization strategies have also shown a reduction in the rate of adolescent cigarette smoking [ 34 ] .
however , the psychological barriers to cigarette use formed through denormalization strategies has been threatened by e - cigarette company renormalization strategies through various marketing techniques [ 35 ] .
as a result , there is the risk that lowered psychological barriers from renormalization strategies increase the likelihood of cigarette smoking via e - cigarette use ( indirect pathway ) , rather than through peer group cigarette smoking ( direct pathway ) .
in particular , the present study showed that the influence of peer group cigarette smoking on e - cigarette use was over 2 times higher in never smokers than former smokers and this difference could be explained by renormalization .
in other words , psychological barriers to e - cigarette use have already been lowered in former smokers as a result of their past smoking experience .
consequently , former smokers may perceive e - cigarette use as non - deviant behavior ; therefore , the role of renormalization strategies by e - cigarette companies may be nonsignificant in former smokers compared to never smokers .
in contrast , in never smokers , the threshold of psychological barriers that recognizes e - cigarette use as deviant behavior may be lower than that for cigarette use due to renormalization strategies .
as a result , it is believed that even never smokers who were not influenced by peer group cigarette smoking to initiate cigarette smoking may react to e - cigarette use and show a stronger response to peer influence than former smokers .
specifically , having more friends who were cigarette smokers was associated with a greater response margin to e - cigarette use regardless of past cigarette experience .
because having a greater number of peer group cigarette smokers leads to lower negative perceptions about cigarette smoking [ 36 ] , these results suggest that the interaction between peer group cigarette smoking and e - cigarette renormalization had a more substantial influence on diminishing psychological barriers .
because the present study was cross - sectional , it was unable to evaluate whether there was a causal relationship between peer group cigarette smoking and e - cigarette use .
moreover , because it posed no questions about social norms or perceptions about cigarettes or e - cigarettes , it was difficult to directly identify the cause of the differential influence of peer group cigarette smoking on e - cigarette use between former and never smokers .
thus , there is a need for continued study of this subject in the future .
despite these limitations , the present study had the following advantages .
first , the study used nationally representative data from a large - scale survey including 2,369 ever e - cigarette users and 752 current e - cigarette users .
second , after excluding current smokers , analyses were performed by dividing the subjects into former and never smokers .
this enabled accurate assessments of peer group cigarette smoking on e - cigarette use , including simultaneous analysis of the interaction between peer group cigarette smoking and cigarette smoking status .
finally , when comparisons were made with comparable 2011 u.s. nyts data [ 15,16 ] , it was revealed that e - cigarette use in korean adolescents ( 4.7 %) was more than 4 times higher than in u.s. adolescents ( 1.1 %) .
furthermore , among current smokers , the dual user rate ( 36.6 %) was much higher than that of u.s. adolescents ( 10.6 %) .
moreover , the rate of current e - cigarette only users was higher in korean adolescents ( 1.1 %) than in u.s. adolescents ( 0.6 %) .
considering that e - cigarettes are widely marketed through the internet and south korea is globally an internet powerhouse [ 37 ] , south korea is at risk for dramatic increases in future e - cigarette use. that being the case , the present study was meaningful in that it is the first to assess factors related to e - cigarette use in korean adolescents .
conclusion peer group cigarette smoking had an important relationship with adolescent e - cigarette use and this relationship was greater on never smokers than former smokers .
these findings give warning that peer group cigarette smoking can be combined with e - cigarette renormalization strategies to enable the expansion of the e - cigarette market by reaching adolescent never smokers who would otherwise not be interested in cigarette use .
not only did e - cigarette users have positive perceptions of e - cigarettes , they also had liberal views on future cigarette smoking and had high potential to become dual users [ 15 - 17,27,38 ] .
therefore , it is essential to continue to study e - cigarettes to accurately assess their health hazards and use e - cigarette denormalization strategies to instill proper e - cigarette perceptions in adolescents .
this will mitigate adolescents' expanded use of e - cigarettes and prevent cigarette smoking in this group .

introduction the us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) classify biothreat agents based upon their ease of dissemination , associated morbidity / mortality rates , projected social impact , and emergency response procedures .
category a agents ( i.e. those of highest concern ) include bacillus anthracis ( the causative agent of anthrax ) , yersinia pestis ( plague ) , and francisella tularensis ( tularemia ) , while category b agents ( exhibiting lower morbidity / mortality rates ) include brucella species ( brucellosis ) , burkholderia mallei ( glanders ) , and burkholderia pseudomallei ( melioidosis ) .
the 1984 rajneeshee salmonella attack , 2001 anthrax letter attacks , 2003 sars outbreak , and 2009 h1n1 swine flu pandemic illustrate our vulnerability to both deliberate and natural outbreaks of infectious disease and underscore the necessity of effective vaccines and antimicrobial / antiviral therapeutics .
the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains and the ease by which antibiotic resistance can be engineered into bacteria further highlights the need for continued development of novel antibiotics against new bacterial targets .
isoprenoids are a class of molecules fundamentally involved in a variety of crucial biological functions including electron transport ( quinones ) , cell wall biosynthesis ( dolichols ) , signal transduction ( prenylated proteins ) , and the regulation of membrane fluidity ( hopanoids and cholesterol ) .
despite their structural and functional diversity , all isoprenoids are derived from two building blocks , isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) and dimethylallyl diphosphate ( dmapp ) , which originate from either the mevalonic acid ( mva ) or methylerythritol phosphate ( mep ) pathway ( fig. 1 ) .
because mammalian cells exclusively utilize the mva pathway , enzymes within the mep pathway make an attractive target for the development of novel antimicrobials ( reviewed in [ 1 ] - [ 3 ]) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0008288.g001 figure 1 the two isoprene biosynthetic pathways .
a ) the mva pathway .
the first two enzymes of the mva pathway condense 3 molecules of acetyl - coa ( 1 ) to form 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coa ( hmg - coa ) ( 3 ) , which is subsequently reduced to mva ( 4 ) by hmg - coa reductase [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
mva is phosphorylated twice then decarboxylated to yield ipp ( 7 ) [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] , which is converted to dmapp ( 8 ) by an isomerase [ 25 ] .
b ) the mep pathway .
condensation of pyruvate ( 9 ) with glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate ( 10 ) yields 1 - deoxy - d - xylulose 5 - phosphate ( dxp ; ( 11 )) [ 26 ] , an intermediate with a role in e. coli vitamin b1 and b6 biosynthesis [ 27 ] - [ 30 ] and isoprene biosynthesis .
1 - deoxy - d - xylulose 5 - phosphate reductoisomerase ( also called mep synthase or ispc ) catalyzes the reduction and rearrangement of 11 to yield mep ( 12 ) [ 5 ] , the first committed step in the e. coli mep pathway .
the next enzyme , cdp - me synthase , converts mep into 4 - ( cytidine 5 ' - diphospho ) - 2 - c - methyl - d - erythritol ( cdp - me ; ( 13 )) .
cdp - me kinase then phosphorylates cdp - me , which is subsequently cyclized ( coupled with the loss of cmp ) by cmepp synthase to yield 2 - c - methyl - d - erythritol 2,4 - cyclodiphosphate ( 15 ) [ 31 ] - [ 35 ] .
a reductive ring opening of 15 produces 1 - hydroxy - 2 - methyl - 2 - butenyl diphosphate ( hmbpp ; ( 16 )) [ 12 ] , [ 36 ] - [ 39 ] , which is subsequently reduced to both ipp and dmap in a ~ 5:1 ratio [ 2 ] , [ 40 ] - [ 45 ] .
c ) the reaction catalyzed by mep synthase .
isomerization via cleavage of the bond between c3 and c4 and formation of a new bond between c2 and c4 produces the intermediate 2 - c - methyl - d - erythrose 4 - phosphate ( 18 ) [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] , which is subsequently reduced to yield mep ( 12 ) .
genome sequences reveal that francisella , brucella , bacillus , burkholderia , and yersinia each harbor mep pathway genes , but little else is known about isoprene biosynthesis in these biothreat agents .
in this report we describe the characterization of f. tularensis mep synthase , a mep pathway enzyme and potential target for drug development .
the f. tularensis mep synthase gene was cloned , expressed in escherichia coli , and the recombinant protein was purified and enzymatically characterized .
post - translational modification ( phosphorylation ) was revealed by protein mass spectrometry and correlated with the loss of enzyme activity , suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism .
the stability of f. tularensis mep synthase in high - throughput type assays amenable to drug development was also evaluated .
overall , our results suggest that mep synthase is an excellent target for the development of novel antibiotics against f. tularensis .

holarctica genomic dna was isolated using a wizard genomic dna purification kit ( promega , madison , wi ) , per the manufacturer 's instructions .
plasmid dna was isolated from e. coli using a genelute plasmid miniprep kit ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) .
construction of the f. tularensis mep synthase expression plasmid the mep synthase coding region ( ispc ) was identified in the f. tularensis subsp .
holarctica lvs genome ( accession number nc _ 007880 ) via a blast search using the e. coli k12 homologous sequence as the query .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) primer pairs , designed to flank ispc ( ftispc - f ; 5 ' - caccatgtttaaaaaaactaagattac - 3 ' and ftispc - r ; 5 ' - ccccaaaacagaatccacatattc - 3 ') , were purchased from sigma - genosys ( the woodlands , tx ) and used to amplify the gene from f. tularensis subsp .
holarctica lvs genomic dna .
ftispc - f contains four additional 5 ' residues ( cacc ) to facilitate the unidirectional insertion of the pcr product into plasmid pet101 / d - topo ( invitrogen ) .
ftispc - r is designed to eliminate the stop codon in the pcr product to permit the expression of a c - terminal his - tagged mep synthase protein .
pcr was performed with platinum pfx polymerase ( invitrogen ) and the following parameters : 2 minutes at 94degreesc followed by 22 cycles of 15 sec at 94degreesc , 30 sec at 54degreesc , 1.5 min at 68degreesc , and a final elongation of 10 min at 68degreesc .
the pcr product was purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) and cloned into pet101 / d - topo to create pftispc .
restriction mapping and dna sequencing were used to confirm the fidelity of the pcr and the correct construction of the plasmid .
pftispc was transformed into chemically competent e. coli bl21 codonplus ( de3 ) - ril cells to express the protein .
expression and purification of f. tularensis mep synthase a one liter shake flask was used for protein expression ( 37degreesc , 250 rpm ) .
the flask was inoculated with a 10 ml overnight culture of e. coli bl21 codonplus ( de3 ) - ril containing pftispc and upon reaching an od600 of 1.1 , protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl beta - d - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) .
after incubation for an additional 18 hours , cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at - 80degreesc .
to purify the his - tagged protein , the cell pellet was thawed then cells were lysed using lysis buffer a ( 100 mm tris ph 8 , . 032 % lysozyme ; 3 ml per mg cell pellet ) , followed by lysis buffer b ( 0.1 m cacl2 , 0.1 m mgcl2 , 0.1 m nacl , . 020 % dnase ; 0.3 ml per mg cell pellet ) .
clarified cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation ( 48,000 x g , 20 min ) then passed through a talon immobilized metal affinity chromatography column ( clontech laboratories , mountain view , ca ) .
the column was washed with 15 column volumes of 1x equilibration buffer ( 50 mm hepes ph 7.5 , 300 mm nacl ) , 10 column volumes of 1x wash buffer ( 50 mm hepes ph 7.5 , 300 mm nacl , 10 mm imidazole ) , 10 column volumes of 2x wash buffer ( 100 mm hepes ph 7.5 , 600 mm nacl , 20 mm imidazole ) , and the his - tagged protein was then eluted with 5 column volumes of 1x elution buffer ( 150 mm imidazole ph 7.0 , 300 mm nacl ) .
buffer was exchanged by addition of 0.1 m tris ph 7.5 , 1 mm nacl , 5 mm dtt while concentrating the protein by ultrafiltration .
protein concentration was determined using the advanced protein assay reagent ( cytoskeleton , denver , co ) with gamma - globulins ( sigma - aldrich ) as the standard .
the protein was visualized via coomassie stained sds - page and a western blot with an anti - his antibody ( qiagen ) .
the yield of purified mep synthase averaged 5 - 10 mg per 1 l lb shake flask .
size - exclusion chromatography the molecular mass of mep synthase and the mutant derivatives were estimated by loading 1 mg of protein onto a sephacryl 200hr ( sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo ) size - exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 0.1 m tris ph 7.5 , 1 mm nacl , 5 mm dtt ( flow rate of 2 ml / min ) and calibrated with a gel filtration standard kit purchased from bio - rad ( hercules , ca ) .
blue dextran was used to determine the void volume of the column .
mutagenesis the ser177 to asp177 mutant of mep synthase was created via pcr based site directed mutagenesis using primers ft - ispc - sd177 - fp ( 5 ' tta aca gca gat gga ggt cct ttt ag 3 ' ; lowercase residues indicate site of mutation ) and ft - ispc - sd177 - rp ( 5 ' agg acc tcc atc tgc tgt taa aat tat c 3 ') , whereas the ser177 to glu177 mutant was created using primer pairs ft - ispc - se177 - fp ( 5 ' tta aca gca gaa gga ggt cct ttt aga g 3 ') and ft - ispc - se177 - rp ( 5 ' agg acc tcc ttc tgc tgt taa aat tat c 3 ') .
each primer pair is oriented outward from a central overlapping region .
in the first step of the mutagenesis , four unidirectional pcrs were performed with each of the four individual pcr primers ( ft - ispc - sd177 - fp , ft - ispc - sd177 - rp , ft - ispc - se177 - fp , or ft - ispc - se177 - rp ) using the following parameters : 5 minutes at 95degreesc followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95degreesc , 30 sec at 60degreesc , 40 sec at 72degreesc , and a final elongation of 7 min at 72degreesc .
in the second step , 5 microl of each pcr product was appropriately combined with the product obtained from the companion primer ( i.e. the product using ft - ispc - sd177 - fp was combined with the ft - ispc - sd177 - rp product , whereas the products obtained from the pcrs with ft - ispc - se177 - fp and ft - ispc - se177 - rp were combined ) and each mixture served as template for a subsequent pcr using t7 forward and reverse primers .
pcr conditions were as follows : 5 minutes at 95degreesc followed by 5 cycles of 30 sec at 95degreesc , 30 sec at 60degreesc , 40 sec at 72degreesc , then 25 cycles of 30 sec at 95degreesc , 30 sec at 52degreesc , 40 sec at 72degreesc and a final elongation of 10 min at 72degreesc .
in the third step , the pcr products from step 2 were amplified using primers ftispc - f and ftispc - r ( described above ) , and the resulting products were cloned into pet101 / d - topo , transformed into xl1blue cells , and sequence confirmed by restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing .
each expression vector was introduced into chemically competent e. coli bl21 codonplus ( de3 ) - ril cells to express the c - terminal his - tagged protein .
the s177d and s177e mutants were purified as described for the wildtype his - tagged mep synthase .
fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectra of mep synthase and the mutant derivatives were measured using a fluoromax - 3 fluorometer ( horiba jobin yvon ) at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm using cuvettes with an optical path length of 1 cm. the emission spectra of protein samples with a concentration of 5 microm in 0.1 m tris ph 7.5 , 1 mm nacl , 5 mm dtt were measured from 310 to 400 nm ( excitation and emission slit width = 5 nm ) .
the temperature was maintained at 30degreesc .
all fluorescence spectra were corrected for background with pure buffer .
enzyme assays mep synthase activity was evaluated at 22degreesc by spectrophotometrically monitoring the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of nadph using an assay derived from that described by takahashi et al [ 4 ] .
all assays were performed in triplicate .
to determine the apparent km for 1 - deoxy - d - xylulose 5 - phosphate ( dxp ) , assay mixtures ( 200 microl ) contained 100 mm tris ph 7.8 , 25 mm mgcl2 , 0.15 mm nadph , 7 microm mep synthase , and a variable concentration of dxp ( echelon biosciences , salt lake city , ut ) .
to determine cation specificity , assays were performed with 25 mm mgcl2 , cacl2 , cocl2 , cucl2 , mncl2 , zncl2 , or nicl2 .
to determine the apparent km for nadph , assays were performed with fixed dxp concentration ( 0.4 mm ) and variable nadph concentration .
nonlinear regression fitting to the michaelis - menten equation was used to determine the kinetic constants .
half - maximal inhibition ( ic50 ) by fosmidomycin was determined using a plot of enzyme fractional activity as a function of inhibitor concentration .
a plot of kmapp as a function of inhibitor concentration was used to determine the ki for fosmidomycin ( negative value of the x intercept ) .
because fosmidomycin is a slow , tight binding inhibitor [ 5 ] , the enzyme was preincubated with fosmidomycin for 10 minutes prior to addition of substrate .
high - throughput assays were performed using 96 - well plates with assay volumes adjusted to 100 microl .
the z - factor was calculated as described by zhang et al [ 6 ] with fosmidomycin as the inhibitor control .
mass spectrometry method for phosphopeptide identification to obtain mep synthase for phosphopeptide analysis , protein expression and purification was essentially as described above , with the exception of using 0.01 mm iptg for induction .
purified mep synthase was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol ( dtt ) , alkylated by iodoacetamide ( 50 mm ) , and then digested by trypsin ( promega ) in buffer containing ammonium bicarbonate ( 50 mm , ph 9 ) and urea ( 2 m ) .
the digestion mixture was then desalted by a seppak column ( waters , milford , ma ) .
phosphopeptides were enriched from the tryptic peptides by a tio2 column as described by thingholm et al [ 7 ] with modification .
in brief , 30 cm fused silica capillary tubing ( 360 microm od , 200 microm id , polymicro technologies , phoenix , az ) was attached to the frit end of inline microfilter assembly ( upchurch scientific ) , and tio2 loose media ( gl sciences , inc ) was slurry - packed into the tubing using a pressure cell ( brechbuhler inc. ) to form a 200 microm x2 cm tio2 column .
the seppak - cleaned sample was mixed with equal volume of loading buffer ( 200 mg / ml 2,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( dhb ) , 5 % trifluoroacetic acid ( tfa ) , 80 % acetonitrile ) , and loaded into tio2 column by pressure cell with flow rate of 3 microl per minute .
the column was washed with 200 microl wash buffer 1 ( 40 mg / ml dhb , 2 % tfa , 80 % acetonitrile ) and 2x200 microl wash buffer 2 ( 2 % tfa , 50 % acetonitrile ) to remove non - phosphopeptides .
phosphopeptides were then eluted off the column by elution buffer ( 5 % ammonia solution ) .
ammonia in the eluate was evaporated by speedvac (~ 3 min ) , acidified by adding glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 2 % , and desalted using a ziptip ( millipore ) .
the purified phosphopeptides were analyzed by reversed - phase liquid chromatography nanospray tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) using an ltq - orbitrap mass spectrometer ( thermofisher ) using previously described methods [ 8 ] .
tandem mass spectra were searched using the program sequest ( bioworks software , thermo ) with full tryptic cleavage constraints , static cysteine alkylation by iodoacetamide , and variable phosphorylation of ser / thr / tyr .
phosphopeptide identification was determined using database match scoring criteria filters followed by manual evaluation of the raw data , as described [ 8 ] .
molecular modeling f. tularensis subsp .
holarctica lvs mep synthase ( protein accession number caj78974 ) was homology - modeled using swiss - model [ 9 ] ( http :// swissmodel.expasy.org /) in automated modeling mode .
the template used for modeling was identified via the template identification tool ( with default parameters ) , which performs a primary sequence comparison of the query sequence with those in a structural database .
the resolved structure that exhibited the greatest sequence homology with f. tularensis mep synthase was chosen as the template for modeling ( e. coli mep synthase ; pdb id # 1t1r , blast e value = 3x10 - 94 , 48 % identity and 66 % homology with the f. tularensis sequence ) .
the quality of the f. tularensis mep synthase model was evaluated using proqres [ 10 ] , which uses atom - atom contacts , residue - residue contacts , solvent accessibility , and secondary structure information to assign an accuracy score from 0 ( unreliable ) to 1 ( reliable ) .
swiss - pdbviewer 4.0 ( http :// spdbv.vital - it.ch /) was used to visualize and annotate the model .
results and discussion the f. tularensis mep pathway as an antimicrobial target since mep pathway orthologs are not found in the human genome , the pathway makes an attractive target for the development of novel antibiotics .
to assess if mep pathway inhibition would restrict the in vitro proliferation of f. tularensis subsp .
novicida , we monitored bacterial growth in media supplemented with fosmidomycin [ 11 ] , a strong and specific inhibitor of mep synthase ( e. coli genetically engineered to use mevalonate for ipp biosynthesis ( fig. 1 ) is unaffected by fosmidomycin when the culture medium is supplemented with mevalonate , but growth is inhibited by fosmidomycin when mevalonate is excluded [ 12 ] , illustrating the specificity of fosmidomycin for the mep pathway .
dose - dependent inhibition of purified e. coli mep synthase [ 11 ] and a resolved crystal structure of e. coli mep synthase bound to the inhibitor [ 13 ] further illustrate this specificity ) .
as illustrated in the dose - response plot shown in fig. 2 , fosmidomycin inhibits f. tularensis growth , with half - maximal inhibition at 12 microm ( 2.2 microg / ml ) .
a transposon mutant library of f. tularensis [ 14 ] further confirms the essentiality of the pathway , as mep pathway knockouts are lethal , further validating the pathway as an attractive target in f. tularensis .
to facilitate drug development , we next set out to clone and evaluate mep synthase .

his - tagged mep synthase has a predicted molecular weight of 46.4 kda .
b ) western blot hybridization analysis of purified mep synthase using an anti - his antibody results in an intense band of the expected size .
the appearance of a weak , smaller molecular weight band suggests that some degradation may have occurred .
kinetic characterization of f. tularensis mep synthase the kinetic activity of purified mep synthase was spectrophotometrically evaluated by monitoring the substrate dependent enzyme catalyzed oxidation of nadph ( fig. 1c ) .
nonlinear regression fitting of enzyme velocity versus substrate concentration was used to determine the apparent kinetic constants ( fig. 4 and table 1 ) .
the kmapp for 1 - deoxy - d - xylulose 5 - phosphate ( dxp ) was obtained using assays performed with a saturating concentration of nadph ( 150 microm ) , whereas the kmapp for nadph was determined using assays with saturating levels of dxp ( 400 microm ) .
the kmapp , dxp and kmapp , nadph for recombinant f. tularensis mep synthase are consistent with values reported for the enzyme from e. coli , m. tuberculosis , and synechocystis sp .
pcc6803 ( table 1 ) .
the apparent specificity constant of f. tularensis mep synthase is also comparable to the mycobacterium and synechocystis enzymes , although it is 20 fold less than that reported for the e. coli enzyme ( due to the difference in kcatdxp ) .
assays performed with various divalent cations revealed that recombinant f. tularensis mep synthase prefers mgcl2 , although 60 % of the enzyme activity is retained with mncl2 ( fig. 5 ) .

having established assay conditions for f. tularensis mep synthase , we set out to evaluate the protein sensitivity to fosmidomycin .
half maximal activity ( ic50 ) was observed at 247 nm , similar to that reported for the mycobacterium homolog ( table 1 ) .
the ki for fosmidomycin ( 99 nm ) , obtained from a plot of kmapp , dxp as a function of inhibitor concentration ( fig. 6 ) , is greater than that reported for e. coli and synechocystis sp .
pcc6803 ( table 1 ) .
this may reflect structural differences in the mep synthase homologs , although this remains to be determined .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0008288.g006 figure 6 graphical determination of the inhibition constant .
because fosmidomycin is a slow , tight binding inhibitor [ 5 ] , the enzyme was preincubated with fosmidomycin for 10 minutes prior to addition of substrate .
the absolute value of the x intercept of the line produced from linear regression fitting the plot of k m app,dxp as a function of fosmidomycin concentration defined the ki as 98.9 +/ - 4.5 nm. the r2 value is indicated. f. tularensis mep synthase in a high - throughput assay one method of identifying lead molecules in the drug development process involves the screening of large molecular libraries for inhibitors of an assay .
a crucial issue for reliable high - throughput screening is the quality and robustness of the assay , often described in terms of the z - factor [ 6 ] .
an assay with a z - factor score between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered excellent for high - throughput screening .
to determine the z - factor for the assay using f. tularensis mep synthase , we adjusted the assay volume to accommodate a 96 - well plate , fixed the substrate concentration at the km ( 104 microm ) , used a saturating concentration of nadph ( 150 microm ) , and evaluated three separate lots of purified mep synthase in a series of assays performed over three consecutive days .
fosmidomycin was used as a positive control for inhibition .
the z - factor with f. tularensis mep synthase was found to be 0.8 , indicative of an assay ( and enzyme ) well suited for use in a high - throughput screen .
phosphorylation of f. tularensis mep synthase the first committed and principle regulatory step in the mva pathway is catalyzed by hmg - coa reductase ( reviewed in [ 17 ]) .
multifaceted control mechanisms regulate hmg - coa reductase activity , including the modulation of enzyme concentration , the modulation of membrane composition / fluidity , and the regulation of enzyme activity via reversible phosphorylation ( specifically , enzyme inhibition by phosphorylation of a serine residue in the catalytic domain [ 18 ]) .
in comparison to the mva pathway , much less is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control metabolic flux through the mep pathway .
engineered alterations of mep pathway gene expression suggest that several mep pathway enzymes may share control over metabolic flux ( reviewed in [ 19 ]) .
the role of posttranslational modification , such as reversible phosphorylation , remains unknown .
thus , we sought to evaluate if a phosphorylation site on f. tularensis mep synthase could be identified .
recombinant f. tularensis mep synthase was purified from e. coli ( induced with 10 microm iptg ) , subjected to trypsinization , and phosphopeptides were isolated and identified via titanium dioxide chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry .
phosphoserine 177 ( equivalent to ser186 in the e. coli enzyme ) was identified ( fig. 7 ). e. coli ser186 is located in the substrate binding site , directly interacts with the substrate , and participates in additional interactions that contribute towards protein conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding [ 13 ] .
serine 177 presumably has a similar role in the f. tularensis homolog .
phosphorylation of ser177 is likely to disrupt these interactions , influencing substrate binding and protein conformation , ultimately affecting enzyme activity .
to test this assumption , two mutants of f. tularensis mep synthase were created , s177d and s177e , wherein ser177 was changed to an aspartate or glutamate , respectively , which serve to mimic a phosphoserine .
each mutant was expressed in e. coli and purified to near homogeneity via a c - terminal his - tag .
relative to wildtype mep synthase , a blue shift in the intrinsic fluorescence maximum of s177d suggests changes in the protein globular fold are brought about by the introduction of the asp residue ( fig. 8a ) .
the slight red shift in fluorescence emission spectrum of s177e is also indicative of a conformational change , although the change in s177e suggests exposure of a tryptophan residue to a hydrophilic environment whereas the blue shift observed with s177d is indicative of a conformational change sequestering a tryptophan in a hydrophobic environment .
like the wildtype enzyme , both mutants exist as dimers in solution , as determined by size - exclusion chromatography ( fig. s2 ) .
enzyme assays performed using the purified mutants reveal that each is inactive ( fig. 8b ) .
collectively , these results suggest that phosphorylation of ser177 leads to a conformational change in f. tularensis mep synthase which inhibits the enzyme and may serve as a control mechanism to regulate metabolic flux through the mep pathway .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0008288.g007 figure 7 predicted tertiary structure of f. tularensis mep synthase , homology - modeled using swiss - model .
a crystal structure of f. tularensis mep synthase has not been reported .
to permit the visualization of phosphoserine177 within the context of the tertiary structure , the f. tularensis mep synthase was modeled based upon the resolved structure of the e. coli homolog [ 48 ] ( 48 % identity , 66 % homology ) .
a cartoon representation of the model is shown , with alpha helices colored red , beta sheets colored yellow , and coiled regions colored gray .
the beta sheets comprise the dimer interface in the e. coli structure .
the quality of the model was evaluated with proqres ( fig. s3 ) which provides scores ranging from 0 ( unreliable ) to 1 ( reliable ) .
regions of the model scoring < 0.5 are colored light blue .
primary sequence alignment and the structure of e. coli mep synthase were used to identify residues comprising the substrate binding site ( colored dark blue with backbone and sidechain residues shown ) .
serine177 ( colored green with backbone and sidechain residues shown ) is equivalent to e. coli ser186 , which contributes to the substrate binding site and has been shown to participate in conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding [ 13 ] .
two tryptophan residues present in the f. tularensis mep synthase model are colored pink .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0008288.g008 figure 8 regulation of f. tularensis mep synthase .
a ) intrinsic fluorescence spectra of mep synthase and its mutants .
wildtype and mutant ( s177d and s177e ) proteins were adjusted to 5 microm in 0.1 m tris ph 7.5 , 1 mm nacl , 5 mm dtt and analyzed using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. the emission spectra was measured from 310 to 400 nm. the em lambdamax of wildtype mep synthase was detected at 335 nm , of s177e was detected at 337 nm , and of s177d was detected at 326 nm. the blue shift observed with s177d is indicative of a conformational change sequestering tryptophan residues into a hydrophobic environment .
the slight red shift observed with s177e is indicative of a conformational change exposing tryptophan residues to a hydrophilic environment .
the increased quantum yield observed with both s177d and s177e is also indicative of a structural change in mep synthase .
b ) the relative catalytic activity of wildtype mep synthase and the s177d and s177e mutants .
assays were performed with 300 microm dxp and 150 microm nadph .
conclusions in conclusion , we have shown that f. tularensis mep synthase is a valid target for the development of novel therapeutics .
inhibition of mep synthase is sufficient to inhibit the growth of f. tularensis in vitro .
purified mep synthase is kinetically active and readily lends itself to use in high - throughput screens .
furthermore , our investigation is the first to show that metabolic flux through the f. tularensis mep pathway may be regulated by phosphorylation of mep synthase , similar to the regulatory control observed in the mva pathway .

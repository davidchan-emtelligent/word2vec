background following the publication of the paper ' loss of parp - 1 affects gene expression profile in a genome - wide manner in es cells and liver cells' [ 1 ] , we found an error in our data .
in the article , we used six replicates of microarray data of wild - type es cells for comparison with the microarray data of parp - 1 knockout es cells .
we found that three replicate data were carelessly included in the data for wild - type es cells .
the comparison should have been carried out between three replicates for the parp - 1 +/+ es cell line , j1 , and three replicates for two parp - 1 - / - es cell lines , 210 - 58 and 226 - 47 , respectively .
therefore , we re - analyzed the data in es cells according to the same criteria .
the consequences of this error are reflected in changes to our results although the conclusions we obtained in the study are not affected .
corrected sentences in the abstract here , we demonstrate that of the 9,640 genes analyzed , in parp - 1 - / - es cells .
3.6 % showed altered gene expression. of these , 2.5 % and 1.1 % of the genes were down - or up - regulated by 2 - fold or greater , respectively , compared with parp - 1 +/+ es cells ( p < 0.05 ) .
corrected results in the text gene expression profile in parp - 1 - / - es cells a comparison of the basal gene expression profiles in parp - 1 - / - escells to their wild - type ( parp - 1 +/+) counterparts , is presented in fig. 1a & 1b ( corrected ) and table 1 ( corrected ) .
we found the expression of ( 344 / 9,640 ) genes , namely 3.6 % , was different by at least 2 - fold between parp - 1 - / - and parp - 1 +/+ es cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 1b ( corrected ) and table 1 ( corrected )) .
notably , a larger fraction of the genes , being 2.5 %( 238 / 9,640 ) , was down - regulated , whereas only 1.1 % ( 106 / 9,640 ) of the genes were up - regulated ( see table 1 ( corrected )) .

we further selected the genes that showed relatively high expression levels ( the " flag value " in genespring ver .
6.1 of the genes should be either " present " ( high level of expression ) or " marginal " ( moderate level of expression ) in all replicates of the genotype within the 893 genes that showed a difference at p < 0.05 , see table 1 ( corrected )) .
among the 85 genes selected by this analysis , there were 61 genes , obviously including the parp - 1 ( adprt1 ) gene itself , that were down - regulated and 24 genes up - regulated , as listed in tables 2 ( corrected ) and 3 ( corrected ) .
gene expression profile of the livers and ef cells in the livers , 3.3 % ( 411 / 12,353 ) of genes showed a significant difference in expression level ( p < 0.05 ) between the parp - 1 genotypes .
in the livers of parp - 1 - / - mice , 2.0 % ( 253 / 12,353 ) of the genes were down - regulated and 1.3 % ( 158 / 12,353 ) of the genes were up - regulated ( p < 0.05 ) .
similar to parp - 1 - / - es cells , a higher percentage of the genes , 62 % ( 253 / 411 ) , were down - regulated and the remaining 38 % were up - regulated ( fig. 1c - e in the original article [ 1 ] , and table 1 ( corrected )) .
the expression of representative marker genes of the liver , including albumin ( alb1 ) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( pepck ) , was similarly high in both parp - 1 genotypes .
the heatmaps were constructed using the gene lists containing the 641 genes that showed a difference at p < 0.01 in livers ( fig. 2b ) .
parp - 1 deficiency commonly altered gene expression profiles in the livers of two mice analyzed ( fig. 2b , and table 4 in the original article [ 1 ]) .
comparison of the profiles among different cell types we compared gene expression profiles between parp - 1 - / - es cells and the livers .
there were no genes commonly up - or down - regulated as summarized in tables 2 ( corrected ) , 3 ( corrected ) , and 4 in the original article [ 1 ] , namely in the genes showing relatively high expression levels selected by flag values , although we observed that 7 genes , including eif2s2 ( eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 2 beta ) , parp - 1 , and 1 gene crygs ( crystallin gamma s ) , were commonly down - and up - regulated in the es cells and livers ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively ( fig. 2c ( corrected ) & 2d ( corrected )) .
corrected methods in the text data analysis data analysis was performed with the genespring ( r ) software ver .
6.1 and ver .
7.3.1 ( the latest version ) .
for statistical analyses , the fluorescence intensity ( raw signal ) was normalized to the 50th percentile reading per chip , and then normalized to the median reading per gene .
we performed the non - parametric tests with the cross - gene error model being inactive .
in the case of parp - 1 - / - es cells , 6 replicates consisting of triplicate microarray results from two parp - 1 - / - es cell lines were used .
we used the triplicate microarray results from the parp - 1 +/+ es cell line , j1 .
we excluded genes that showed a standard deviation greater than 2.0 in the normalized data of both genotypes , and we started analysis with 9,640 genes and ests for es cells ( table 1 ( corrected )) .
we constructed gene lists only with the genes that showed statistical differences ( p < 0.05 ) and 2 - fold or greater differences in normalized expression levels between parp - 1 genotypes .
to construct heatmaps , we used genespring ( r ) gx ver .
7.3.1 ( the latest version ) .
we regret that this error occurred in the phase of generating the data set in our paper may have caused any inconvenience .
in the process of making these corrections , the microarray data were submitted to the gene expression database cibex [ 2 ] with the following accession number : cbx22 .

the aggregation of alpha - synuclein ( alpha - syn ) is considered the key pathogenic event in many neurological disorders such as parkinson 's disease ( pd ) , dementia with lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy , giving rise to a whole category of neurodegenerative diseases known as synucleinopathies .
although the molecular basis of alpha - syn toxicity has not been precisely elucidated , a great deal of effort has been put into identifying compounds that could inhibit or even reverse the aggregation process .
previous reports indicated that many phenolic compounds are potent inhibitors of alpha - syn aggregation .
the aim of the present study was to assess the anti - aggregating effect of gallic acid ( ga ) ( 3,4,5 - trihydroxybenzoic acid ) , a benzoic acid derivative that belongs to a group of phenolic compounds known as phenolic acids. by employing an array of biophysical and biochemical techniques and a cell - viability assay , ga was shown not only to inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation and toxicity but also to disaggregate preformed alpha - syn amyloid fibrils .
interestingly , ga was found to bind to soluble , non - toxic oligomers with no beta - sheet content , and to stabilize their structure .
the binding of ga to the oligomers may represent a potential mechanism of action .
additionally , by using structure activity relationship data obtained from fourteen structurally similar benzoic acid derivatives , it was determined that the inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation by ga is related to the number of hydroxyl moieties and their position on the phenyl ring .
ga may represent the starting point for designing new molecules that could be used for the treatment of pd and related disorders .
alpha - synuclein parkinson 's disease gallic acid aggregation amyloid fibrils drug discovery introduction parkinson 's disease ( pd ) is a neurodegenerative disorder , the incidence of which rises sharply after the fifth decade of life , affecting 1.4 and 3.4 % of the population at 55 and 75 years of age , respectively ( wood , 1997 ) .
pd affects a region of the brain known as the substantia nigra , resulting in a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons and a concomitant plummeting in dopamine levels in striatum .
as a consequence , pd is manifested by a plethora of clinical symptoms , with the most prominent being impaired motor activity , muscle rigidity , and resting tremor .
neuropathologically , pd is characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions known as lewy bodies ( lbs ) , the main constituent of which are alpha - synuclein ( alpha - syn ) fibrils ( spillantini et al. , 1997 ; el - agnaf et al. , 1998 ) .
moreover , accumulated results over the last few decades show that mitochondrial dysfunction followed by oxidative stress are both associated with neurodegenerative diseases ( leuner et al. , 2007 ; schmitt et al. , 2012 ) .
although alpha - syn belongs to the family of natively unfolded proteins , which demonstrate little or no ordered structure , the protein has the intrinsic propensity to fibrillate , giving rise to insoluble fibrils similar to the ones detected in lbs ( hashimoto et al. , 1998 ; giasson et al. , 1999 ; conway et al. , 2000 ; serpell et al. , 2000 ; greenbaum et al. , 2005 ) .
additionally , five missense mutations in the alpha - syn gene ( snca ) , namely a53t ( polymeropoulos et al. , 1997 ) , a30p ( kruger et al. , 1998 ) , e46k ( zarranz et al. , 2004 ) , h50q ( appel - cresswell et al. , 2013 ) and g51d ( kiely et al. , 2013 ) , have been linked to severe inherited forms of pd , while duplications and triplications of snca lead to autosomal dominant pd in a gene dosage - dependent fashion ( singleton et al. , 2003 ; ibanez et al. , 2004 ) .
moreover , transgenic animal and drosophila models expressing either wild - type or mutant human alpha - syn also develop fibrillar inclusions and a parkinsonian phenotype ( feany and bender , 2000 ; masliah et al. , 2000 ; kahle et al. , 2001 ; imai et al. , 2011 ; cannon et al. , 2013 ) .
overexpression of alpha - syn , especially its mutant forms , is thought to enhance the vulnerability of neurons to da - induced cell death through an excessive generation of intracellular ros ( junn and mouradian , 2002 ) .
many evidences point to the key role of alpha - syn in the regulation and biosynthesis of da , the loss of alpha - syn function as a consequence to its aggregation lead to selective disrupt da homeostasis and negatively affect dopaminergic neuron survival ( perez et al. , 2002 ) .
it is noteworthy that the fibrillation of alpha - syn is implicated in the development of a series of neurodegenerative diseases , including multiple system atrophy ( msa ) and dementia with lewy bodies ( dlb ) , which are collectively referred to as synucleinopathies ( spillantini and goedert , 2000 ; trojanowski and lee , 2003 ) .
mitochondrial pathophysiology aggressively promotes neuronal dysfunction and loss of synaptic viability , leading ultimately to neurodegeneration ( perier and vila , 2012 ) , and accumulated evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies , postulates a major pathogenic role for a alpha - syn in mitochondrial dysfunction , thereby providing a link between protein aggregation , mitochondrial damage , and neurodegeneration ( reviewed in camilleri and vassallo , 2014 ) .
taken together , these findings indicate a central role for alpha - syn aggregation in pd pathogenesis .
alpha - syn aggregation proceeds through several key intermediate stages , with monomeric alpha - syn first assembling into oligomeric forms that gradually generate insoluble amyloid fibrils .
because alpha - syn aggregation plays a crucial role in pd pathogenesis and related synucleinopathies , intensive effort has been put into identifying compounds that could block or even reverse the aggregation process .
over the years , polyphenols , a set of more than 8000 compounds that contain one or more phenolic rings , have emerged as potent amyloid inhibitors , interfering with the in vitro fibril assembly of many amyloidogenic proteins including alpha - syn , beta - amyloid ( abeta ) , tau - protein and prions ( reviewed in porat et al. , 2006 ) .
gallic acid ( ga ) is a phenolic acid .
phenolic acids constitute a group of compounds , which are derived from benzoic acid and cinnamic acid , giving rise to hydroxybenzoic acids and hydrocinnamicacids , respectively .
ga ( 3,4,5 - trihydroxybenzoic acid ) is a benzoic acid derivative that can be found in almost all plants , with the highest ga contents detected in gallnuts , witch hazel , pomegranate , berries such as blackberry and raspberry , sumac , tea leaves and oak bark .
ga can also be isolated from the roots of radix paeoniae ( white - flowered peony ) , which is commonly used to treat vascular and liver diseases in traditional chinese medicine ( ho and hong , 2011 ) .
it has been reported that ga possesses anti - oxidant ( kim , 2007 ) , anti - inflammatory ( kroes et al. , 1992 ) and anti - viral ( kreis et al. , 1990 ) properties , and a well - documented anti - cancer activity ( yang et al. , 2000 ; liu et al. , 2011 ; ho et al. , 2013 ) .
recently , ga has been reported to act as a potent anti - oxidant and free radical scavenger in a rat pd model ( sameri et al. , 2011 ) .
additionally , ga was shown to efficiently inhibit alpha - syn and abeta aggregation and toxicity in vitro ( bastianetto et al. , 2006 ; di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) .
the aim of the present study was to systematically assess the ability of ga to ( a ) inhibit alpha - syn oligomerization and fibrillation , ( b ) block alpha - syn - induced toxicity and ( c ) disaggregate preformed alpha - syn fibrils .
to gain insight of the mechanism of action of ga against alpha - syn aggregation and toxicity and to establish a structure - activity relationship , we assessed the anti - fibrillogenic effect of eleven different hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives with chemical structures similar to ga. the selection of the phenolic acids was based on the number of the hydroxyl moieties attached to the phenyl ring .
to further investigate the role of hydroxyl groups in the inhibitory activity of phenolic acids , we also included and assessed the effect of three different benzoic acid derivatives that have fluorides and methoxy groups instead of hydroxyl moieties .

the membranes were then extensively washed for 25 min .
the immunoreactive bands were visualized with a supersignal west femtochemiluminescent substrate kit ( pierce , rockford , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) for separating alpha - syn oligomers and monomers sec was carried out using an akta fplc system ( ge healthcare - sweden ) and a superdex 200 column at 4degreesc , in order to separate the oligomers generated from the aggregation of alpha - syn with ga ( ga : alpha - syn molar ratio of 4:1 ) .
monomeric alpha - syn at a concentration of 100mum was aggregated in the presence of ga for 5 days as described above .
at the end of the aggregation process , the sample was centrifuged for 45 min at 14,000 x g at 4degreesc generating a supernatant free from insoluble material .
prior to injecting 80 % of the generated supernatant , the column was thoroughly equilibrated with sec running buffer ( 1 x pbs , ph 7.4 ) and the flow rate was set to 0.1 ml / min ( 0.5 ml / fraction ) .
alpha - syn elution was monitored at absorbance wavelengths of 215 , 254 , and 280 nm. to determine the elution time of monomeric alpha - syn , molecular weight standards ( ferritin 440 kda , aldolase 171 kda , abmumin 68 kda and chymotrypsinogen a 25 kda ) and monomeric alpha - syn were co - injected into the column and eluted at the same conditions mentioned above .
the fractions eluting between 7 - 9 ml cv were combined and labeled as oligomers ( sample p1 ) , whereas the fractions eluting in the 13 - 15 ml cv were combined and labeled as monomers ( sample p2 ) .

fresh monomeric alpha - syn was used as negative control .
nmr for nmr studies , recombinant 15n - labeled alpha - syn was expressed and purified as previously described ( eliezer et al. , 2001 ; bussell and eliezer , 2003 ) , resuspended in pbs at ph 6.5 .
two - dimensional proton - nitrogen correlation spectra were acquired for alpha - syn at 200mum concentration in the absence of ga and in the presence of increasing ga : alpha - syn stoichiometries of 0.5:1 , 1:1 , 2:1 , 5:1 , and 10:1 .
data were collected on a varian 600 mhz unity inova spectrometer equipped with a cold probe .
results the effect of ga on alpha - syn fibril formation to investigate the effect of ga on alpha - syn fibrillation , 25mum of alpha - syn was incubated with ga at varying molar ratios of ga : alpha - syn of 4:1 , 2:1 , and 1:1 for a period of 6 days .
ga inhibited the formation of alpha - syn fibrils in a concentration - dependent manner as indicated by the th - s assay ( figure 1a ) .
taking into account the lack of th - s signal at the 4:1 ratio , ga exhibited an excellent inhibitory effect on alpha - syn fibrillation , inhibiting it completely during the 6 - day incubation ( figure 1a ) .
at a 2:1 ratio , ga also suppressed the formation of fibrils to a great extent , and the th - s signal was detected only after 4 days of incubation , while after 6 days , ga reduced the th - s counts to approximately one fifth of the control counts ( figure 1a ) .
even at a 1:1 ratio , ga hindered the fibrillation of alpha - syn but to a smaller extent than the other ratios ( figure 1a ) .
the anti - fibrillogenic activity of ga was further assessed by the congo red binding assay .
congo red ( cr ) is a dye with high affinity for amyloid fibrils .
the absorption maximum of cr alone ( 5mum ) was 490 nm , while when incubated with alpha - syn amyloid fibrils , the absorption maximum shifted to 508 nm ( figure 1b ) .
this shift in the peak absorption wavelength represents the binding of cr to the beta - sheet - rich fibrils .
however , this prominent shift was not observed for the fresh alpha - syn sample or when alpha - syn was aged in the presence of ga ( figure 1b ) , indicating that ga inhibited the formation of structures with a beta - sheet conformation .
in fact , ga blocked the formation of beta - sheets in a dose - dependent manner , similar to the th - s results .
it was observed that the lower the ga concentration , the more prominent the peak absorbance wavelengths shift was ( 485 , 493 , and 500 nm for 100 , 50 , and 25mum ga , respectively ) .
electron microscopy images also confirmed that ga not only affected the extent of fibrillation in a dose - dependent fashion but also the morphology of alpha - syn fibrils .
indeed , instead of forming dense meshes of long fibrils ( longer than 1mum ) as observed in aged alpha - syn alone ( figure 1c ) , alpha - syn aged in the presence of 100mum ( figure 1d ) and 50mum of ga ( figure 1e ) generated thin , sheared fibrils that were approximately 0.1 - 0.2mum in length .
alpha - syn aged in the presence of 25mum ga ( figure 1f ) formed longer fibrils ( approximately 0.5mum long ) , which were arranged in dense networks .
figure 1 ga inhibits alpha - syn fibrillation in a concentration - dependent manner .
( a ) samples of alpha - syn ( 25mum ) were incubated alone or in the presence of ga ( molar ration of ga : alpha - syn 4:1 , 2:1 , 1:1 ) for 6 days with continuous shaking at 37degreesc .

scale bar , 500 nm. the effect of ga on alpha - syn oligomerization ( early aggregates ) to evaluate the effect of ga on alpha - syn oligomer formation , samples of alpha - syn aged alone or in the presence of ga at different molar ratios were assessed for their oligomeric content by oligomer - specific elisa and immunoblotting .
for the detection of alpha - syn oligomeric species in the samples , we employed a novel elisa developed in our laboratory ( el - agnaf et al. , 2006 ) , which specifically recognizes the oligomeric species present in the samples .
the elisa results ( figure 2a ) indicated that ga could only inhibit the formation of alpha - syn oligomers when employed at the highest concentration , namely 100mum .
interestingly , at lower concentrations , ga appeared to enhance alpha - syn oligomerization compared to the control ( figure 2a ) .
the samples of alpha - syn aged in the presence of 25 and 50mum ga exhibited gradually increasing oligomeric content , which was much higher than the control ( figure 2a ) .
figure 2 ga inhibits alpha - syn oligomerization at a high concentration , but at lower concentrations it promotes oligomerization .
( a ) samples of alpha - syn ( 25mum ) aged alone or in the presence of ga at different molar ratios for 6 days with continuous shaking at 37degreesc were assessed for their ability to inhibit the formation of oligomers by the oligomeric elisa assay .
the assay was performed in duplicate ( average of duplicate measurements +/ - standard deviations ) .
( b ) immunoblot analysis of the effect of ga on alpha - syn oligomerization .
fresh or aged alpha - syn samples alone or in the presence of ga at molar ratios of ga : alpha - syn 1:1 , 2:1 and 4:1 incubated for 6 days with continuous shaking at 37degreesc were separated by electrophoresis in a15 % sds - page gel .
lane 1 : fresh alpha - syn ; lane 2 : aged alpha - syn ; lane 3 : ga : alpha - syn molar ratio of 4:1 , lane 4 : ga : alpha - syn molar ratio 2:1 and lane 5 : ga : alpha - syn molar ratio 1:1 .
similarly , immunoblotting of the same samples ( figure 2b ) indicated a decrease in the oligomeric species when alpha - syn was aged with 100mum ga ( figure 2b ) , while there was a characteristic increase in the band corresponding to dimeric alpha - syn ( figure 2b ) .
the same sample was also characterized by the presence of strong monomeric and trimeric ( approximately 50 kda ) bands and the absence of the bands corresponding to larger alpha - syn aggregates with high molecular weight .
however , in the presence of 50 and 25mum ga , the bands corresponding to oligomeric species were much stronger , with a concentration - dependent decrease in the bands corresponding to monomeric , dimeric and trimeric species .
additionally , the intensity of the band corresponding to larger alpha - syn aggregates increased in a dose - dependent manner .
these data indicate that ga at low concentrations may have the ability to stabilize alpha - syn oligomers .
the effect of ga on preformed alpha - syn amyloid fibrils given that ga was shown to be such an effective inhibitor of alpha - syn fibrillation , we investigated whether it could also reverse fibrillation .
therefore , 25mum of preformed alpha - syn fibrils were incubated at 37degreesc in the presence of ga at molar ratios of ga : alpha - syn of 6:1 , 4:1 , and 2:1 for a period of 48 h. by measuring the th - s fluorescence counts ( figure 3a ) , we estimated the fibril content at the indicated time points .
at time 0 , the th - s counts were approximately 8000 for all samples ( figure 3a ) .
the alpha - syn fibrils that were incubated alone continued to aggregate further , as indicated by the increase in th - s counts ( figure 3a ) .
however , the alpha - syn fibrils that were incubated in the presence of ga disaggregated over time as shown by the decrease in the th - s counts ( figure 3a ) .
it is noteworthy that after 24 h of incubation , alpha - syn fibrils incubated without ga gave approximately 18,000 th - s counts , while the fibrils incubated with all tested concentrations of ga produced less than 2000 th - s counts ( figure 3a ) .
thus , ga disaggregated preformed alpha - syn fibrils in a dose - dependent fashion .
figure 3 ga disaggregates preformed alpha - syn fibrils in a concentration - dependent manner .
( a ) samples of aggregated alpha - syn were incubated for 48 h at 37degreesc in the absence or presence of various concentrations of ga ( ga : alpha - syn 6:1 , 4:1 , 2:1 ) .
the fibril content was then measured by the th - s binding assay .
the assays were performed in triplicate ( average of triplicate measurements +/ - standard deviations ) .

the results are expressed as percentages of the control average ( i.e. , untreated cells ) .
the alpha - syn species generated by 72 h incubation of preformed alpha - syn fibrils in the presence or absence of ga were added to the cells 48 h prior to mtt addition ( average of 3 wells +/ - sd. statistical analysis was performed using two tailed unpaired t - test , *** p < 0.001 ; ** p < 0.01 ) .
after 48 h of incubation , the samples were also tested for their cr binding ( figure 3b ) .
as expected , alpha - syn fibrils incubated in the presence of ga produced spectra with a peak absorbance wavelength that was slightly shifted compared to the controls , indicating minimal beta - sheet content .
in contrast , the fibrils of alpha - syn that were incubated alone produced a peak absorbance at 550 nm , indicating a high beta - sheet content ( figure 3b ) .
these findings were confirmed by em ( figure 3c ) .
all samples at time 0 were characterized by the presence of dense meshes of fibrils longer than 0.5mum .
however , the alpha - syn fibrils incubated in the presence of ga gradually became thinner and shorter and appeared fragmented , isolated and scarce , unlike the control , which continued to demonstrate networks of long fibrils ( figure 3c ) .
furthermore , similar results were obtained when the experiment was performed using alpha - syn fibrils after reaching plateau in th - s assay ( figure s1 ) .
to assess whether ga disaggregation of alpha - syn fibrils was accompanied by a decrease in alpha - syn toxicity , we then evaluated the toxicity of the alpha - syn species that resulted from the disaggregation experiment on human neuroblastoma m17 cells ( figure 3d ) .
the samples were diluted to final alpha - syn concentrations of 0.5 , 1 , and 5mum .
preformed alpha - syn fibrils incubated for 6 days in the absence of ga decreased cell viability in a dose - dependent manner .
however , preformed alpha - syn fibrils incubated with ga for 6 days generated species that were less toxic compared to the control .
this trend was most prominent for 5mum alpha - syn , which , when incubated in the absence of ga , induced death of 45 % of the cells , but in the presence of ga , cell death was less than 25 % .
the effect of ga on the seeding of alpha - syn aggregation it has been previously shown that the process of amyloid fibril formation follows a nucleation - dependent polymerization ( jarrett and lansbury , 1992 ) .
according to this model , soluble species generated via the nucleation of oligomeric species ( nucleation or lag time phase ) , which in turn polymerize ( polymerization or growth phase ) to generate fibrils , reaching thus a final plateau known as the equilibrium phase ( harper et al. , 1999 ) .
small aggregates or seeds have been shown to accelerate the nucleation phase of amyloid formation both in vitro and in vivo by a process known as seeding ( jarrett and lansbury , 1993 ; harper and lansbury , 1997 ; volpicelli - daley et al. , 2011 ; luk et al. , 2012 ) .
given that ga inhibited both alpha - syn fibrillation and disaggregated preformed alpha - syn fibrils , we sought to identify the effect of this phenolic acid on the seeding of alpha - syn aggregation .
more specifically , mature alpha - syn fibrils were fragmented by sonication to obtain short fibrils , which were employed as " seeds " ( figure 4b ) .
these short fibrillar " seeds " were then added to monomeric alpha - syn , which was allowed to aggregate as described above .
as expected , the addition of short fibrillar seeds accelerated the fibrillation of alpha - syn as indicated by the increased th - s counts .
indeed , with seeding , the extent of alpha - syn fibrillation after 6 h of incubation was comparable to the fibrillation of the protein incubated for 72 h without seeding ( figures 1 , 4b , respectively ) .
figure 4 ga inhibits the seeded fibrillation of alpha - syn .
( a ) samples of alpha - syn ( 100mum ) seeded with short fibrillar alpha - syn ( 2mum ) were incubated in the presence or absence of ga at different concentrations ( 10 - 50mum ) for 6 h with continuous shaking at 37degreesc .
the extent of fibrillation was estimated by the th - s binding assay .
the assays were performed in triplicate ( average of triplicate measurements +/ - standard deviations ) .
( b ) electron microscopy images of negatively stained samples of seeds alone and alpha - syn + seeds incubated alone or in the presence of ga ( 50mum ) for 6 h with continuous shaking at 37degreesc .
scale bar , 1000 nm. in order to assess the effect of ga on the seeding of alpha - syn aggregation , 10 and 50mum ga was added to 100mum monomeric alpha - syn containing seeds at a final concentration of 2mum , and the mixture was incubated with continuous mixing at 37degreesc for 6 h. ga at 50mum inhibited the seeded fibrillation of alpha - syn by approximately 90 % as indicated by the extremely low th - s counts .
at lower concentrations ( 10mum ) , ga also had an inhibitory effect on the seeded fibrillation of alpha - syn but to a smaller extent .
at 10mum , ga inhibited seeded fibrillation by 40 - 50 % ( figure 4a ) .
these findings were confirmed by tem ( figure 4b ) .
the effect of ga on alpha - syn aggregates - induced toxicity it has been reported that the oligomeric intermediates are the neurotoxic species in the amyloid fibrillation pathway ( allsop et al. , 2001 ; el - agnaf et al. , 2001 , 2006 ; vendruscolo et al. , 2001 ; walsh et al. , 2002 ; argyriou et al. , 2012 ; breydo et al. , 2012 ; colla et al. , 2012 ) .
as described above , at high concentration ( 4:1 ) , ga inhibited both early and late aggregate formation , whereas at low concentrations ( 2:1 and 1:1 ) , it stabilized alpha - syn oligomers ( figure 2a ) .
to determine the effect of ga on toxicity conferred by alpha - syn aggregates , a cell - based toxicity assay , the mtt assay , was conducted with human neuroblastoma m17 cells .
the samples were diluted to final alpha - syn concentrations of 5 and 0.5mum .
the mtt assay showed that alpha - syn aged in the absence of ga decreased cell viability in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 5 ) .
however , when alpha - syn was aged in the presence of a high concentration of ga ( 4:1 ) , there was visible neuroprotection of the cells observed ( figure 5 ) .
at low concentrations ( 2:1 and 1:1 ) , ga exhibited a minor protective effect against alpha - syn toxicity , possibly due to the increase in oligomers as demonstrated by the elisa results and the immunoblotting analysis ( figures 2a,b , respectively ) .
our results clearly demonstrate that ga reduced the toxicity of alpha - syn at a high concentration ( 100mum ) by significantly inhibiting the formation of toxic alpha - syn oligomers .
the toxicity of the oligomers resulted from alpha - syn : ga 1:4 was compared with alpha - syn oligomers prepared in the absence of ga as described in materials and methods section by mtt assay ( figure 5b ) .
both samples were characterized for the presence of oligomers by sds page ( figure 5c ) and native page ( figure 5d ) .
it was clear that the oligomers resulting from the incubation of alpha - syn with ga were not toxic comparing with oligomers in absence of ga. moreover , these oligomers were stable under denaturing conditions ( figure 5c ) compared those formed in the absence of ga. figure 5 effect of ga on the toxicity of aggregated alpha - syn .

ga inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation is mediated via binding to the intermediate species and forming stable oligomers the strong inhibitory effect that ga exerted on fibrillation together with the stimulating effect it had on alpha - syn oligomerization at lower ga concentrations , prompted us to investigate further the interaction of ga with alpha - syn oligomers .
for this purpose , monomeric alpha - syn ( 100mum ) was aggregated in the presence of ga ( ga : alpha - syn 4:1 ) .
after 5 days of incubation the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was injected in a superdex 200 se column .
the elution volume for monomeric alpha - syn was determined by molecular weight standards ( figure s2a ) , and was eluted in a peak corresponding to column volume of 13 - 15 ml ( figure s2b ) , while oligomeric alpha - syn eluted in a peak corresponding to column volume of approximately 7 - 9 ml ( figure 6a ) .
the fractions corresponding to the oligomeric and monomeric alpha - syn peaks were separately pooled together giving rise to p1 and p2 samples , respectively ( figure 6a ) , which were concentrated using a speed vac .
the alpha - syn species in samples p1 and p2 were characterized by western blotting ( figure 6b ) .
according to the western blotting results , the oligomers generated during the incubation of alpha - syn with ga are stable under denaturing conditions ( figures 5c , 6b ) .
electron microscopy of the same samples indicates the presence of different species of oligomers in p1 ( figure 6d ) , in agreement with the imunoblotting results ( figure 6b ) .
in order to detect the incorporated ga in the p1 and p2 samples , we exploited the property of ga to produce uv absorbance spectra with two peaks , one at 225 nm and one at 260 nm. in the sample containing ga : alpha - syn at 4:1 molar ratio , we detected ga only in the oligomeric p1 samples ( figure 6c ) .
these findings strongly support the hypothesis that ga binds to the oligomeric species and stabilizes them .
to further evaluate whether ga interacts with alpha - syn monomers , we monitered a titration of ga into a solution of monomeric alpha - syn using two - dimensional nmr spectroscopy , which provides signals covering the entire amino acid sequence of alpha - syn ( figure 7 ) .
at stoichiometries of up to 10:1 ga : alpha - syn we observed no significant chemical shift or resonance intensity changes ( figures s3a - e ) , confirming that ga does not interact significantly with monomeric alpha - syn .
this result is largely in agreement with nmr studies of related compounds entacapone , tolcapone and quercetin ( di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) .

investigating the structure - activity relationship of ga inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation to define the most effective molecular scaffolds against alpha - syn fibril formation and establish a structure - activity relationship for ga , we exploited the structural diversity of benzoic acid derivatives ( i.e. , hydroxybenzoic acids ) .
twelve hydroxybenzoic acids , including ga , salicylic acid and gentisic acid ( see table 1 ) were assessed for their anti - fibrillogenic properties by the th - s binding assay ( figure 8 ) .
the structure of the tested hydroxybenzoic acids is characterized by the presence of a phenyl ring that has a carboxyl group and hydroxyl moieties ( oh ) attached to the ring at different positions .
the selection of the compounds examined in the present study was based on the number ( between 0 and 3 ) and position of the hydroxyl groups attached to the phenyl ring ( see table 2 ) .

samples of alpha - syn ( 25mum ) were incubated alone or in the presence of different benzoic acid derivatives ( pa : alpha - syn molar ratios of 4:1 , 2:1 , 1:1 ) for 6 days with continuous shaking at 37degreesc .
the fibril formation was measured by the th - s binding assay and expressed as a percentage of the fibril content of alpha - syn aged alone .
the assay was performed in triplicate ( average of triplicate measurements +/ - standard deviations ) .
table 2 the compounds were divided into four groups based on the number of hydroxyl groups attached to the phenyl ring .
the kinetics of alpha - syn fibrillation was studied over a period of 5 days in the presence or absence of the phenolic acids .
based on the th - s assay results ( figure 8 and table 3 ) , the effect of the twelve phenolic acids on alpha - syn fibrillation varied greatly .
the extent of the inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation was ~ 99 % for ga , ~ 72 % for 2,4,6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid , ~ 60 % for 3,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid , ~ 30 % for five compounds including 2,6 - dihydroxybenzoic acid and 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid and only 5 % for benzoic acid ( see figure 8 and table 3 ) .
moreover , three compounds , 2 - hydroxybenzoic acid ( salicylic acid ) , 3 - hydroxybenzoic acid and 3,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid , failed to inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation , with salicylic acid appearing to enhance the aggregation of alpha - syn compared to the control ( see figure 8 and table 3 ). by comparing the structures of the most effective compounds and the least effective ones , we conclude that better inhibition of fibrillation is observed when there are a large number of hydroxyl groups ( - oh ) attached to the phenyl ring of the compound .
moreover , the positions at which the hydroxyl groups are attached to the phenyl ring also appear to play a critical role .
ga has hydroxyl groups attached at positions 3 and 5 ( see table 2 ) and is much more effective than 2,4,6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid , which also bears three - oh groups but at different positions ( figure 8 ) .
interestingly , 3,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid , which only lacks an - oh group at position 5 compared to the very effective ga , is the third best inhibitor of alpha - syn fibrillation ( figure 8 ) .
among all the dihydroxybenzoic acids tested , the ones with - oh groups at two consecutive positions , i.e. , 3,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 60 % inhibition ) and 2,3 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 44 % inhibition ) , are more potent inhibitors compared to those that have - oh groups at non - consecutive positions , i.e. , 2,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 30 % inhibition ) and 3,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 0 % inhibition ) ( figure 8 ) .
additionally , all compounds with one - oh group , as well as the benzoic acid without a - oh group , failed to show any inhibitory effect on alpha - syn aggregation ( figure 8 ) .

as expected , none of the three tested compounds in any of the three molar ratios tested ( compound : alpha - syn 4:1 , 2:1 , and 1:1 ) could inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation ( figure 8 ) .
this finding provides additional support for the importance of the presence of the hydroxyl group in the phenyl ring .
discussion the formation of amyloid aggregates has long been considered responsible for the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders ( taylor et al. , 2002 ; dorval and fraser , 2007 ; vekrellis et al. , 2011 ) .
although amyloidogenic proteins , such as alpha - syn , are usually found unfolded in their native state ( uversky , 2008 ; fauvet et al. , 2012 ) , in which they are soluble and non - toxic , they can undergo misfolding resulting in the formation of insoluble aggregates ( seidler et al. , 1996 ; veldman et al. , 1998 ; irvine et al. , 2008 ; kahle , 2008 ; stefanis , 2012 ) .
these aggregates deposit in various regions of the brain , constituting the main neuropathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases such as pd , dlb , msa and approximately the 50 % of alzheimer 's disease cases .
in the case of alpha - syn , pathological , biochemical , genetic and animal modeling studies provide compelling evidence that alpha - syn aggregation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pd and related synucleinopathies .
as a consequence , the identification of compounds that can block or reverse the aggregation process of alpha - syn is considered a vital therapeutic strategy against these diseases .
to this end , we assessed the effect of the phenolic compound ga ( 3,4,5 - trihydroxybenzoic acid ) on alpha - syn aggregation and toxicity , and we established a structure - activity relationship for ga. by employing an array of biophysical and biochemical techniques , we showed that at a high concentration ( 100mum , represented by the molar ratio 4:1 ) , ga exerts significant inhibitory effect on both alpha - syn fibrillation ( figures 1a,b ) and oligomerization ( figures 2a,b ) , as well as seeded fibrillation of alpha - syn ( figure 4a ) .
in accordance with these findings , tem images revealed that alpha - syn in the presence of ga at high concentration only formed a few short , thin fibrils that had a fragmented appearance ( figure 1d ) accounting for the low th - s counts ( figure 1a ) and the minor wavelength shift in the cr binding assay ( figure 1b ) .
at lower ga concentrations ( especially at 1:1 molar ratio ) , however , the ability of the ga to inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation was less dramatic and accompanied by a striking increase in the oligomeric content ( figure 2a ) , indicating ga may stabilize the oligomeric structure .
size exclusion chromatography combined with uv spectroscopy for detection of the incorporated ga in alpha - syn confirmed that ga binds to alpha - syn oligomers ( figure 6c ) .
furthermore , ga was able to disaggregate preformed alpha - syn fibrils ( figures 3a - c ) , generating species that possessed a decreased beta - sheet content ( figure 3b ) and were less toxic to the cells ( figure 3d ) .
previous studies have also shown that the flavonoid baicalein , as well as other antioxidant compounds inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation and disaggregate pre - aggregated fibrils ( zhu et al. , 2004 ; ono and yamada , 2006 ) .
ga was also shown to alleviate alpha - syn aggregates associated - toxicity in neuroblastoma m17 cells ( figures 5a,b ) .
these results are in agreement with previous studies indicating that ga possesses anti - fibrillation , oligomer - stabilizing and neuroprotective properties against alpha - syn and abeta cytotoxicity ( di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) .
indeed , ga was shown to stabilize biotinylated abeta1 - 42 oligomers ( levine et al. , 2012 ) and to inhibit the in vitro conversion of low molecular weight abeta1 - 42 protofibrils into fibrils by 50 % ( di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) .
additionally , ga was reported to block the fibrillation of alpha - syn in vitro and to suppress the ability of short alpha - syn fibrils to seed the aggregation of monomeric alpha - syn ( di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) .
furthermore , ga exerts a neuroprotective effect on cells against the cytotoxicity of alpha - syn and abeta1 - 42 ( di giovanni et al. , 2010 ) , possibly due to the inhibition of the amyloid aggregation but potentially also due to the anti - inflammatory ( kim et al. , 2011 ) , anti - oxidant ( ban et al. , 2008 ; hong et al. , 2012 ) and anti - apoptotic properties it possesses ( hong et al. , 2012 ) .
based on our findings using both sec and nmr , as well as previous reports , ga inhibits alpha - syn fibrillation not by interacting with the monomeric alpha - syn - similar to many other phenolic compounds ( reviewed in porat et al. , 2006 ) - , and preventing it from polymerizing , but rather by stabilizing the structure of oligomeric alpha - syn ( figures 2b , 6c ) which appears to be non - toxic ( figure 5 ) .
these findings are in accordance with previous studies indicating that polyphenolic compounds , such as baicalein , curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate ( egcg ) induce the formation of soluble , non - toxic oligomers ( zhu et al. , 2004 ; masuda et al. , 2006 ). from a therapeutic point of view , this represents a major advantage , as ga may not interfere with the physiological function of the monomeric alpha - syn ( wagner et al. , 2013 ) .
it has been reported that phenolic compounds such as curcumin inhibit abeta aggregation due to conformation - dependent binding ( yang et al. , 2005 ) .
consistent with this model of inhibition , ga also inhibited the seeding ability of short fibrillar alpha - syn .
although the presence of oligomers can be transient as they assemble into fibrils ( kaylor et al. , 2005 ; fink , 2006 ) , there are studies revealing that in the presence of the polyphenolic compound egcg , they can shift off - pathway from fibrillation ( ehrnhoefer et al. , 2008 ) .
indeed , egcg was shown to promote the formation of less toxic oligomers that were exceedingly stable and incapable of contributing to the aggregation process ( ehrnhoefer et al. , 2008 ) .
as it is also a phenolic compound , ga may interact with alpha - syn oligomers by a mechanism similar to that of egcg , accelerating the formation of off - pathway oligomers and leading to the accumulation of non - toxic oligomers and the interruption of the fibrillation process .
to gain insight into the mechanism of action of ga and to establish a structure - function relationship for this phenolic acid , we evaluated the effect of various structurally similar phenolic acids on alpha - syn fibrillation .
the results generated from this approach point toward a structure - related effect on alpha - syn fibrillation in which the better inhibitors were observed to have a greater number of - oh groups attached to the phenyl ring that were directly conjugated to the carboxylic acid arm ( see figure 8 ) .
in fact , the ranking of the anti - fibrillogenic potency of all the tested phenolic compounds could be represented as follows : trihydroxybenzoic acid > dihydroxybenzoic acid > monohydroxybenzoic acid = benzoic acid .
this finding is in accordance with previous studies indicating that the potency of certain polyphenolic compounds to inhibit and disaggregate alpha - syn oligomers correlates with the number of vicinal - oh groups present on a single phenyl ring ( masuda et al. , 2006 ; caruana et al. , 2011 ) .
the significance of the presence of the hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring was further stressed by the fact that the compounds that possess appendages other than hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings failed to inhibit alpha - syn aggregation .
at this point , it is more than an idle speculation to suggest that the inhibition capacity of the phenolic compounds tested is not only dependent on the number of hydroxyl moieties but also on their position and conjugation with respect to the benzoic acid appendage .
comparison of the two trihydroxybenzoic acids tested in this study , ga ( 3,4,5 - trihydroxybenzoic acid ) and 2,4,6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid , indicates that although both compounds have a total of three - oh groups , the former is a much more potent inhibitor of alpha - syn fibrillation compared to the latter , strongly suggesting that it is not only the total number of - oh groups present in the molecule but also their position that is important .
additionally , comparison of the dihydroxybenzoic acids employed in the present study reveals that the presence of - oh groups in two consecutive positions and conjugated with the carboxyl group [ e.g. , 3,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 60 % inhibition ) and 2,3 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 44 % inhibition )] renders the compounds more active compared to those that have hydroxyl groups at non - consecutive positions ( e.g. , 2,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 30 % inhibition ) and 3,5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( 0 % inhibition ) ( see figure 8 and table 3 ) .
the importance of the 4 - oh moiety is emphasized by the fact that of the three hydroxybenzoic acids tested , only 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid could partially inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation .
among the dihydroxybenzoic acids , 3,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid was the most potent of all , inhibiting fibrillation by 60 % ( table 3 ) .
taken as a whole , these data show that the total number of - oh groups present in the molecule is important for the compound activity and that the position of the overall - oh groups also affects activity , with a hydroxyl group at position 4 appearing to play a significant role .
thus , the presence of three vicinal hydroxyl groups , as in 3,4,5 - trihydroxy benzoic acid ( ga ) , or the three homo - vicinal groups , as in 2,4,6 - trihydroxy benzoic acid , with one - oh group at position 4 , renders the compounds able to inhibit alpha - syn fibrillation to a great extent .
given that all the compounds tested in this study have a phenyl ring in their structures , the phenyl structure itself is clearly not sufficient to inhibit alpha - syn aggregation .
consequently , the inhibition ability of such compounds must be achieved by the presence of additional - oh groups attached to the phenyl ring .
the conjugated hydroxyl groups with the carboxylic acid appendage can easily form quinone structures ( see figure s4 ) .
it is worth mentioning that quinone formation has been previously reported as the potential mechanism of inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation by the phenolic compound baicalein ( zhu et al. , 2004 ) .
the formation of such oxidized derivatives can increase the stability of the compound binding to the alpha - syn fibrils ( taniguchi et al. , 2005 ) , possibly accounting for the increased inhibitory potency of the compounds with more - oh groups present in their structures .
quinones are likely to interact with the aromatic residues of alpha - syn , interfering with their pi - pi stacking ( porat et al. , 2006 ; ebrahimi and schluesener , 2012 ; hamley , 2012 ) .
moreover , quinones have a planar orientation that allows them to align with the hydrophobic groove of alpha - syn fibrils , which possess an in - register organization of side chains in the regular cross - beta - sheet structure ( porat et al. , 2006 ; ebrahimi and schluesener , 2012 ; hamley , 2012 ) .
therefore , the inhibition of alpha - syn fibrillation by ga and 2,4,6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid could be attributed to the combined properties of their three - oh groups and quinone - forming structures .
based on these results , we propose a plausible model to interpret the inhibitory and disassembling effects of ga. two dominant ligand - protein interactions contribute to inhibitor potency , ( a ) the dipole - dipole interactions of the quinone and ( b ) the dipole - dipole interactions of the diquinone group .
the most potent inhibitors , with 3,4,5 - trihydroxy and 2,4,6 - trihydroxy substitution patterns ( ga and 2,4,6 - trihydroxy benzoic acid , respectively ) , ( see figure s4c ) , enable both hydrophobic and dipole - dipole interactions .
the pi - pi stacking is known to play a role in the binding affinity of inhibitors to aggregates , increasing the potential for quinone formation of each compound generally leading to increased binding affinity and , therefore , increased inhibitor potency .
consistent with this interpretation , ortho - and meta - hydroxybenzoic acid , as well as benzoic acid ( see figure s4f ) showed no inhibition effect compared to their para - and ortho - paradihydroxy ( figure s4a ) counterparts due to the inability of the former to form quinone - like ligands ( figures s4f , d ) .
although monocyclic compounds such as phenolic acids were previously shown to be very poor inhibitors of aggregation ( reinke and gestwicki , 2007 ) , later studies revealed that monocyclic compounds could suppress amyloid assembly by interacting with oligomers , stabilizing their structure and conformation , thus inhibiting the transition to beta - sheet structures ( levy - sakin et al. , 2009 ) .
it is therefore likely that phenolic acids , especially ga , act in a similar way , interacting with oligomers and stabilizing their structure through the - oh groups , preventing the transition to beta - sheet - rich structures .
this may explain the increased oligomeric content detected at low ga concentrations and the low beta - sheet content of alpha - syn species generated in the presence of ga. in summary , we conducted a systematic study of the effect of ga on alpha - syn fibrillation , oligomerization and toxicity , and we concluded that ga inhibits alpha - syn fibrillation and toxicity by stabilizing the non - toxic oligomeric structure of alpha - syn through oligomer binding .
our study points toward a structure - related inhibition , with the number of - oh moieties and their position around the phenyl ring playing a fundamental role .
based on the above experimental results , we propose a model to interpret the inhibitory and disassembling effects of ga derivatives on alpha - syn aggregation ( see figure s5 ) .
alpha - syn aggregation is a sequential process in which unstructured alpha - syn monomers undergo conformational transition and re - ordering to form oligomers and then finally amyloid fibrils ( routes a - - > b - - > c - - > d , figure s5 ) .
the analysis of the results obtained from this study shows that ga derivatives can prolong the nucleation process , suggesting that these scaffolds can bind to unstructured alpha - syn oligomers and prevent protein association ( figure s5 , route a - - > f ) and / or slow down the conformational transition to structured oligomers , the precursors of amyloid fibrils .
ga derivatives interact with alpha - syn monomers and / or oligomers through pi - pi stacking , leading to the formation of an energy barrier that prevents the association of alpha - syn molecules .
meanwhile , ga derivatives through their respective quinone oxidation products could induce structural disruption to the local beta - sheet of alpha - syn fibrils via strong binding to the beta - sheet groove regions of alpha - syn fibrils , leading to fibril disaggregation ( d - - > e ) .
it should be noted that , due to the hydrophobic aromatic nature and planar structure of quinones , they might interact with alpha - syn fibrils by relatively nonspecific dipole - dipole interactions with beta - sheet - rich side chains .
this binding mode implies that quinones could have a general inhibitory effect on the aggregation of alpha - syn .

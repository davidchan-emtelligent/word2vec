deficiency of glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) is an x - linked hereditary genetic defect that is the most common polymorphism and enzymopathy in humans .
to investigate functional properties of two clinical variants , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , these two mutants were created by overlap - extension pcr , expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity .
we describe an overexpression and purification method to obtain substantial amounts of functionally active protein .
the km for g6p of the two variants was comparable to the km of the native enzyme , whereas the km for nadp + was increased 5 - fold for g6pdviangchan and 8 - fold for g6pdviangchan + mahidol when compared with the native enzyme .
additionally , kcat of the mutant enzymes was markedly reduced , resulting in a 10 - and 18 - fold reduction in catalytic efficiency for nadp + catalysis for g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , respectively .
furthermore , the two variants demonstrated significant reduction in thermostability , but similar susceptibility to trypsin digestion , when compared with the wild - type enzyme .
the presence of nadp + is shown to improve the stability of g6pd enzymes .
this is the first report indicating that protein instability and reduced catalytic efficiency are responsible for the reduced catalytic activity of g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol and , as a consequence , contribute to the clinical phenotypes of these two clinical variants .
highlights * recombinant human g6pd enzymes were expressed in e. coli and substantial amount of enzymes were obtained .
* detailed biochemical characterization of g6pd enzymes was performed .
* purified g6pd variants showed a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency and protein stability .
* data obtained provide further knowledge in phenotype - genotype relationship of g6pd deficiency .
keywords glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd deficiency variants steady state kinetics thermostability 1 introduction glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd , e.c .
1.1.1.49 ) is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glucose - 6 - phosphate ( g6p ) to 6 - phosphogluconolactone , a key step in the pentose phosphate pathway , and produces the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( nadph ) .
nadph is necessary for protection of the cells against oxidative stress [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
it is particularly important in red blood cells where g6pd activity is the only source of nadph and where lacking a nucleus no new g6pd can be synthesized .
g6pd deficiency is a hereditary genetic defect , which is the most prevalent polymorphism and enzymopathy in humans [ 4 ] .
the gene encoding g6pd is located at the q28 locus on the x - chromosome .
therefore , clinical features are more prominent in the male population .
while homozygous females are relatively rare , heterozygous females exhibit a range of enzyme activities due to partial inactivation of one x - chromosome early in embryogenesis ( lyonization ) .
g6pd deficiency is common and responsible for a variety of clinical conditions , affecting around 400 million people worldwide [ 5 ] .
clinical manifestations of g6pd deficiency include favism , hemolytic anemia , chronic non - spherocytic hemolytic anemia ( cnsha ) , spontaneous abortions and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia resulting in neonatal kernicterus that can lead to death [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
who working groups have classified g6pd variants based on enzyme activity into five classes with thresholds of 10 - 60 % as a defined level of g6pd activity [ 4 ] .
more than 180 g6pd deficiencies have been identified at the dna level and over 400 variants described based on biochemical properties [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
variation in the enzyme activity of g6pd deficiencies has an impact on malaria treatment , because antimalarials such as primaquine , sulfanilamide and sulfadoxine have been observed to cause hemolysis in g6pd deficient individuals [ 12 ] .
this hemolytic toxicity has raised significant concern because of the widespread prevalence of g6pd deficiencies in malaria endemic regions [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
importantly , use of antimalarials is problematic because the hemolytic anemia observed in individuals with g6pd deficiencies is variable .
the clinical hemolytic episode can range from mild and self - limiting to severe and even fatal , depending on exposure and the g6pd genotype .
as a consequence , information regarding the relationship between g6pd genotypes and g6pd activity is crucial .
biochemical characterizations , enzyme kinetics and structural studies have been extensively used to investigate the mechanisms underlying human g6pd deficiencies .
expression , purification and characterization of several single mutation g6pd variants have been described [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
it was observed that mutations located in close proximity to and important for binding with substrates ( g6p and nadp +) and subunit contact sites have a direct effect on enzyme activity [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
on the other hand , some mutations affect protein folding and reduce protein stability [ 18 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
the only double mutant that has been thoroughly characterized was g6pd a - ( val68met + asn126asp ) .
this variant influences protein folding , whereas the catalytic efficiency is not affected [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] .
additionally , g6pd a - showed poor refolding activity , indicating that protein folding is impaired .
g6pdviangchan , which has an amino acid alteration at residue 291 from valine to methionine , was first discovered in a laotian immigrant in 1988 [ 27 ] and is also prevalent in thailand and cambodia [ 14 ] , [ 28 ] .
it has been classified as a class ii deficiency based on biochemical characterization of a partially purified enzyme .
the partially purified enzyme from red blood cells displays altered enzymatic activities , affecting binding affinity for substrates and an inhibitor .
however , no further investigations detailing the impact of the mutation have been carried out for g6pdviangchan .
g6pd variants identified are mostly single mutations ; however , g6pd multiple mutations were also found with lower frequency when compared to a single mutation .
in the latest update of the g6pd database , 12 double , 1 triple and 1 quadruple mutants were reported [ 11 ] .
recently , another two double mutants in the thai population were described , which are g6pdviangchan + mahidol and g6pdviangchan + union [ 29 ] .
following partial purification from red blood cells these double mutations exhibited severe enzyme deficiency with a remaining activity of < 10 % .
the combined g6pdviangchan + mahidol mutant showed an approximately 10 - fold reduction in enzyme activity when compared with the single mutation variants .
full characterization of these natural variants is , therefore , required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed clinical manifestations .
in addition , information obtained will provide insight into the relationship between genotype and phenotypic characteristics of g6pd variants .
in this study , we report methods for overexpression and purification of g6pd proteins .
two natural mutants , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , were expressed , and steady state kinetics , thermostability and trypsin digestion were carried out to biochemically characterize these two mutants .
2 materials and methods 2.1 construction of recombinant g6pd and site - directed mutagenesis the g6pd gene was amplified from human cdna using phusion ( r ) high fidelity dna polymerase ( thermo scientific ) with g6pd forward and reverse primers ( table 1 ) .
two restriction enzyme sites were introduced , ecori and xhoi , in the forward and reverse primers , respectively ( underlined ) .
pcr products were gel purified and digested with ecori and xhoi ( new england biolabs ) .
the digested amplicon was ligated into the pet28a expression vector with an n - terminal his - tag and transformed into the expression host bl21 ( de3 ) .
three natural variants , g6pdmahidol ( gly163ser ) , g6pdviangchan ( val291met ) and g6pdviangchan + mahidol ( val291met + gly163ser ) , were generated by an overlap - extension pcr method as described previously by ho et al. using primers listed in table 1 [ 30 ] .
all constructs were verified by bidirectional dna sequencing and restriction digestion to confirm that the desired recombinant plasmids were obtained .
2.2 expression and purification of g6pd enzymes a single colony of bl21 ( de3 ) harboring the desired plasmid was inoculated in 5 ml of lb medium containing 50 mug / ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 degreesc with 250 rpm shaking overnight .
the overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh 1 l of lb medium in the presence of 50 mug / ml kanamycin at a dilution of 1:100 and grown at 37 degreesc with 250 rpm shaking until the absorbance at 600 nm ( od600 ) reached 0.6 - 0.8 .
the cultures were then induced with isopropyl beta - d - thiogalactoside ( iptg , merck ) at a final concentration of 1 mm and were further incubated at 20 degreesc with 180 rpm shaking for 20 h before being harvested by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 15 min .
cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mm sodium phosphate , ph 7.4 , 300 mm nacl , 10 mm imidazole ) and disrupted by sonication .
the cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 45 min at 4 degreesc , and the supernatant was collected .
subsequently , the supernatant was incubated with pre - equilibrated talon metal affinity resin ( bd biosciences ) in lysis buffer at 4 degreesc for at least 1 h. the unbound proteins were removed with wash buffer ( 20 mm sodium phosphate , ph 7.4 , 300 mm nacl , 20 mm imidazole ) .
the elution of g6pd protein was accomplished with the elute buffer ( 20 mm sodium phosphate , ph 7.4 , 300 mm nacl , and 40 - 400 mm imidazole ) .
imidazole was removed by buffer exchange with 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 containing 10 % glycerol using amicon ultra centrifugal filter devices ( millipore ) .
next , the protein was loaded onto an anion exchange column ( hitrap ( tm ) qxl , ge healthcare ) .
the unbound proteins were washed with 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and the g6pd protein was eluted with a gradient concentration of 0.1 - 1.0 m nacl in 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 .
finally , nacl was removed by buffer exchange with 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 containing 10 % glycerol to stabilize the enzyme .
proteins from each purification step were analyzed by 12 % sds - page stained with coomassie blue ( sigma - aldrich ) .
the protein concentration was determined by the bradford assay [ 31 ] .
the purified enzyme was stored in the presence of 10 mum nadp + at - 20 degreesc .
2.3 western blot analysis western blot analysis was performed to confirm the expression of recombinant g6pd .
purified proteins were loaded onto a 12 % sds polyacrylamide gel , separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane .
the membrane was blocked with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) containing 5 % skimmed milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated at 4 degreesc overnight with an anti - human g6pd antibody ( pierce ) , at a dilution of 1:3000 in the same solution .
after washing 4 times with pbs containing 0.05 % tween 20 ( pbst ) for 15 min each , the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody ( pierce ) diluted 1:2500 in pbst .
prior to development , the membrane was washed 4 times with pbst for 15 min each .
finally , the proteins were detected using the ecl system ( merck millipore ) and the membrane was visualized using an imagequant las4000 mini system ( ge healthcare life sciences ) .
2.4 measurement of steady - state kinetic parameters g6pd activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the reduction of nadp + at 340 nm using a uv - 2700 uv - vis spectrophotometer ( shimadzu ) .
the standard activity assay was performed in a cuvette with a final volume of 1 ml. the reaction mixture contained 50 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.0 , 0.01 m mgcl2 , 200 mum nadp + and 500 mum g6p .
the reaction was initiated with the addition of the enzyme .
determination of kinetic constants was performed by varying the concentration of one substrate ( 2.5 - 500 mum for nadp + and 5 - 500 mum for g6p ) and fixing the concentration of the other substrate at saturating concentration ( 200 mum for nadp + and 500 mum for g6p ) .
each reaction was conducted four times and the initial linear measurement was used for determining the slope of the initial velocity .
data from the spectrophotometer were exported to excel to calculate the rate of product formation and were expressed as micromole of nadph produced per minute per milligram protein ( mumol / min / mg ) as calculated using the extinction coefficient for nadph at 340 nm ( 6220 m - 1 cm - 1 ) .
steady - state kinetic parameters , km , kcat and vmax , were obtained by fitting the collected data to the michaelis - menten equation using graphpad prism software ( graphpad software ) .
2.5 circular dichroism ( cd ) analysis far uv - cd spectra of the g6pd enzymes ( 0.35 mg / ml ) were recorded using a jasco spectrometer , model j - 815 , with a 1 mm path - length .
the measurements were carried out at 25 degreesc .
the spectra were collected over a wavelength range of 190 - 260 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm / min .
three scans were averaged for each protein sample and the buffer was subtracted .
the thermostability of g6pd enzymes was also assessed by cd analysis .
bound nadp + was removed from purified enzyme by buffer exchanged with 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and adjusted a concentration of g6pd protein to 0.2 mg / ml. the stability of wt and each variant was monitored by following the change in the cd signal at 222 nm while varying the temperature from 20 to 80 degreesc at a rate of 3 degreesc / min .
2.6 thermostability tests for the thermostability test , bound nadp + was removed from the purified enzyme by buffer exchanged with 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and the enzyme concentration was adjusted to 0.2 mg / ml. the enzyme was incubated in the presence of different concentrations of nadp + ( 0 , 1 , 10 , 100 and 1,000 mum ) for 20 min at temperatures ranging from 25 to 65 degreesc and then cooled down to 4 degreesc in a thermocycler ( eppendorf ) .
residual activity of the enzyme was determined and expressed as a percentage of the activity for the same enzyme incubated at 25 degreesc .
2.7 trypsin digestion bound nadp + was removed from the purified enzyme as aforementioned and the enzyme concentration was adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 mg / ml. susceptibility of g6pd to trypsin was investigated in the presence of different concentrations of nadp + ( 1 , 10 and 100 mum ) .
trypsin ( 0.5 mg / ml ) was added to enzyme samples and incubated at 25 degreesc .
the residual enzyme activity was examined at time intervals ( 5 - 120 min ) and expressed as a percentage of the activity for the same enzyme without incubation .
3 results 3.1 construction , expression and purification of recombinant human g6pd enzymes the human g6pd gene was amplified by pcr from human cdna with the expected size of 1548 bp ( fig. 1a ) , and cloned into the pet28a expression vector at the ecori and xhoi sites to yield pet28a - g6pd wt .
pet28a - g6pd wt was used as a template for overlap - extension pcr to create two single mutants , g6pdviangchan and g6pdmahidol ( fig. 1b ) .
fragments obtained from overlap extension pcr were used to amplify the full - length genes that were subsequently cloned into the pet28a expression vector at the same cloning sites .
thereafter , pet28a - g6pdviangchan was used as a template to create the double mutant g6pdviangchan + mahidol .
recombinant g6pd was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 ( de3 ) and purified using cobalt - affinity and anion exchange columns .
sds - page analysis of wt and the three mutants is shown in fig. 2a .
to confirm the expression of human g6pd , western blot analysis was performed using an anti - human g6pd antibody ( fig. 2b ) .
the details of each purification step are shown in table 2 .
3.2 steady state kinetic parameters steady state kinetic parameters were determined for three clinical variants and g6pd wt , where g6pd wt and g6pdmahidol were included in the study as controls ( table 3 ) .
representative kinetic plots showing the michaelis - menten constants of g6pdmahidol for g6p and nadp + were shown in fig. 3. the catalytic activities ( kcat ) of wt and g6pdmahidol are comparable to previous reports [ 18 ] .
the two clinical mutants g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol showed ~ 2 - fold decrease in catalytic activity when compared with the native enzyme .
although the affinity for g6p was only slightly affected by these two mutations , the km for nadp + was significantly disrupted for the g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol mutants with kmnadp + values of 34.1 +/ - 2.9 and 55.9 +/ - 8.9 mum , respectively , which is approximately 5 - and 8 - fold greater than the wt enzyme .
as a consequence , the catalytic efficiency for these two clinical variants is decreased by 10 - and 18 - fold for g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , respectively , when compared with the value of the wt enzyme .
3.3 cd analysis since the catalytic efficiency of the two natural variants , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , was markedly reduced , the effect of a conformational change caused by the mutations was investigated .
the secondary structure of native and the three g6pd mutants was examined by cd analysis in the far uv region ( 190 - 260 nm ) ( fig. 4 ) .
cd spectra of the three natural variants shared a similar pattern to that of the native enzyme , indicating that the mutations did not cause an alteration to the secondary structure of the enzyme .
however , the thermal denaturation of each variant was different , as assessed by measuring the secondary structure at 222 nm. the melting temperature ( temperature at which half of secondary structure is unfolded ) was 54.8 , 45.5 , 42.7 , 37.3 degreesc for g6pd wt , g6pdmahidol , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol , respectively ( fig. 5 ) .
3.4 thermostability it is well documented that the presence of a low concentration of nadp + is required for long - term stability of the enzyme [ 10 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] .
therefore , thermostability of wt and the three g6pd variants was further elucidated in the absence and presence of different concentrations of nadp + ( 0 , 1 , 10 , 100 and 1,000 mum ) ( fig. 6 ) .
the wt enzyme exhibited greater stability than the g6pd variants in the absence or presence of nadp + , and the stability of all enzyme variants increased with increasing concentration of nadp + .
t1 / 2 ( temperature at which the enzyme loses 50 % of its activity ) of all enzymes was increased 11 - 16 degreesc in the presence of 1,000 mum nadp + .
g6pdviangchan + mahidol was the least stable enzyme with a t1 / 2 of 33.5 degreesc , which is 13.5 degreesc lower than the wt enzyme ( t1 / 2 = 47 degreesc ) in the absence of nadp + , indicating that this variant is structurally unstable .
3.5 trypsin digestion the susceptibility of g6pd wt and the three variants to trypsin digestion was assessed at 25 degreesc in the presence of different concentrations of nadp + ( 1 , 10 and 100 mum ) ( fig. 7 ) .
all three variants displayed comparable susceptibility to trypsin digestion in comparison with the native enzyme .
after 2 h of digestion in the presence of 10 mum nadp + , which is the physiological concentration , g6pd wt retained ~ 57 % of its original activity , whereas all three natural mutants retained ~ 50 % of their activity .
the addition of nadp + showed a protective effect against trypsin digestion , especially for the g6pd variants where the presence of nadp + has a slightly more prominent impact .
4 discussion the two main causes of reduced g6pd activity in humans are either a decrease in catalytic activity or a reduction in the number of active g6pd molecules .
the decrease in catalytic efficiency is dependent on the position of the mutation .
reduction in the number of active enzyme molecules can be caused by protein instability , inability to form stable dimers , impairment of protein folding and problems with mrna splicing [ 18 ] .
as a consequence , many studies have focused on the protein level to examine the molecular mechanisms regarding the reduced g6pd activity observed in individuals [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
in the present study , we thoroughly investigated the functional properties of two natural g6pd variants , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol .
g6pd wt and g6pdmahidol were included in this study as controls .
the bacterial expression system has been widely used to produce recombinant proteins from various organisms because bacteria are easy to handle and time - and cost - efficient .
previously , expression of human g6pd was performed in various organisms , e.g. , g6pd wt in e. coli , g6pdplymouth and g6pdmahidol in e. coli and g6pdsuwalki in yeast [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 35 ] .
the recombinant g6pd purified from a bacterial expression system exhibited indistinguishable characteristics to the g6pd purified from human red blood cells .
furthermore , the recombinant g6pd made from bacteria also displayed a longer shelf - life and greater stability , retaining 100 % activity when stored at 4 degreesc for over a year [ 35 ] .
therefore , in this study , we chose bacterial expression to produce g6pd proteins .
g6pd variants were cloned into the pet28a expression vector and expressed in bacteria bl21 ( de3 ) .
the amount of g6pd proteins obtained was substantial and adequate for biochemical characterization ; however , the g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol yields were relatively low when compared with the yield obtained for the wt protein .
low protein yields for these two variants could be due to their low stability , as it was observed during purification that g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol aggregated easily even in the presence of 10 % glycerol and nadp + .
in this study , all g6pd proteins purified were his - tagged and they were characterized without removal of the his - tagged because it was shown earlier that additional his - tagged did not affect the catalytic activity and stability of the g6pd enzymes [ 36 ] .
detailed biochemical characterization was performed for four g6pd enzymes .
steady - state kinetic parameters of g6pd wt and g6pdmahidol are in good agreement with previous reports [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 33 ] .
as shown in fig. 8 , g6pdmahidol has an amino acid mutation at residue 163 from glycine to serine , sitting at the front of the strand betae , on the surface of the enzyme , and in close proximity to the base of the coenzyme binding domain .
mutation at this residue causes steric hindrance , thereby affecting the conformation of the protein .
g6pdmahidol displayed only a small decrease in catalytic activity when compared with the wt enzyme ([ 18 ] and this study ) .
however , this variant showed a reduction in thermostability in the absence or presence of nadp + , which could explain the reduced enzyme activity observed in red blood cells of g6pd deficient individuals .
on the other hand , the val291met mutation of g6pdviangchan is on the large beta + alpha domain , alphaj , of the protein structure .
although this mutation is not close to the structural nadp + binding site nor substrate binding site , a partially purified enzyme from erythrocytes showed decreased enzyme activity and alteration in affinity towards substrates [ 27 ] .
similar findings were observed for g6pdunion and g6pdandalus , where small structural changes lead to a significant reduction in the catalytic efficiency [ 33 ] .
therefore , it is of interest to extensively investigate the effects of the val291met mutation on kinetic properties .
in this study , purified recombinant g6pdviangchan showed a 2 - fold reduction in kcat when compared with the native enzyme .
the km for g6p of this mutation was comparable to g6pd wt whereas the km for nadp + was 5 - fold higher .
the purified recombinant g6pdviangchan in our study exhibited a small difference in binding affinity for g6p from that reported for a partially purified enzyme from red blood cells .
the discrepancies in km for g6p could arise from different assay systems and interference present in a partially purified enzyme .
the catalytic efficiency of g6pdviangchan was about 10 - fold lower than the native enzyme .
novel double mutant g6pd variants , g6pdviangchan + mahidol and g6pdviangchan + union , were reported from thailand in 2013 [ 29 ] .
partially purified enzymes of these double mutants showed a significant decrease in enzyme activity , motivating our efforts to characterize the biochemical effects of such double mutations .
the double mutant g6pdviangchan + mahidol exhibited a > 2 - fold decrease in kcat when compared with that of g6pd wt. although the km for g6p of this mutant was similar to the km of g6pd wt , for nadp + the value was raised by 8 - fold causing a significant reduction in the catalytic efficiency by ~ 20 - fold with respect to the native enzyme .
the remarkable reduction in enzyme catalytic efficiency observed in this study for g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol could provide an explanation for the reduced enzyme activity observed in erythrocytes .
in addition to reduced catalytic efficiency , protein instability can also explain the reduced enzyme activity in g6pd deficiency individuals .
structural and biochemical studies of g6pd enzymes have indicated that structural nadp + is essential for the stability and maintenance of enzyme activity [ 10 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] .
the presence of structural nadp + was shown to increase protein stability for many g6pd enzyme variants , e.g. , g6pdunion , g6pdandalus , g6pdplymouth and g6pdnashville [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 33 ] .
although the location of the mutation for both g6pdmahidol and g6pdviangchan is not in close proximity to the dimer interface and binding sites of structural and coenzyme nadp + and the g6p substrate , the effects of these mutations on protein stability were elucidated , since it has been shown that g6pdmahidol causes a local conformational change and affects backbone folding , resulting in protein instability [ 18 ] .
the instability of g6pdmahidol , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol variants is unlikely to cause a disruption to the secondary structure as they have similar cd spectra to the cd spectrum of the wt enzyme .
therefore , the thermal denaturation of wt and the three g6pd mutants was assessed by cd analysis .
the melting temperature ( tm ) , the temperature at which half of the secondary structure is unfolded , was 54.8 degreesc for wt , 45.5 degreesc for g6pdmahidol , 42.7 degreesc for g6pdviangchan and 37.3 degreesc for g6pdviangchan + mahidol .
the melting temperature of g6pd wt from this study is in good agreement with the value of 55 degreesc reported previously [ 37 ] .
g6pdmahidol , g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol are highly unstable as they lost 50 % of their secondary structure below 50 degreesc .
in particular , for g6pdviangchan + mahidol the melting temperature is 15 degreesc lower than the tm of the native enzyme .
the difference in melting temperature between native and variant enzymes was further confirmed by carrying out a thermostability test of the enzymes in the absence and presence of different concentrations of nadp + .
the presence of nadp + was shown to increase thermostability for all g6pd proteins , in agreement with previous reports for g6pd wt and g6pdmahidol [ 18 ] .
g6pdviangchan + mahidol was the least stable g6pd variant studied here with a t1 / 2 of 33.5 degreesc in the absence of nadp + and 49.8 degreesc in the presence of 10 mum nadp + .
these t1 / 2 values are much lower than the native enzyme under the same conditions with values of 47 degreesc and 58 degreesc in the absence and presence of 10 mum nadp + , respectively .
g6pdviangchan also exhibited significantly reduced thermostability when compared with g6pd wt , but the effect is most pronounced for g6pdviangchan + mahidol .
defective protein folding can also reduce protein stability and usually leads to accelerated degradation .
several g6pd mutations have been shown to be more susceptible to protease degradation [ 25 ] , [ 37 ] .
susceptibility to trypsin digestion was investigated for g6pd enzymes .
no significant increase in susceptibility to trypsin digestion was observed for the three natural g6pd variants studied here .
the presence of nadp + has been shown to counteract the susceptibility to proteolysis in a concentration - dependent manner .
the results obtained here were in agreement with a previous report for g6pdmahidol where no significant differences in susceptibility to trypsin digestion were observed when compared with the g6pd wt [ 18 ] .
however , it remains inconclusive because all g6pd enzymes were in the fully folded native form and the experiments were carried out in vitro , which are different from physiological conditions where protein degradation occurs in a proteasome .
in addition , proteases present in human cells may have different protein quality controls from the trypsin used .
5 conclusions in summary , the reduced activity of g6pd variants observed in red blood cells may originate from several causes .
reduced catalytic efficiency and protein stability are clearly the major causes of clinical enzyme deficiency observed in individuals carrying g6pdviangchan and g6pdviangchan + mahidol. from detailed biochemical characterization , we report here , for the first time , that g6pdviangchan exhibited a 10 - fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and this variant also showed lower thermostability when compared with the native enzyme .
this result further supports the classification of this variant as a class ii g6pd deficiency .
moreover , the double mutant enzyme , g6pdviangchan + mahidol , displayed an even greater loss in catalytic efficiency ( 18 - fold ) with a significant reduction in thermostability when compared with g6pd wt. this double mutant , therefore , should be classified as a severe g6pd deficiency .
however , clinical data is also required to precisely allocate it to a class i or class ii g6pd deficiency .
thus , functional characterization of both g6pd variants has provided valuable information describing the molecular mechanisms underlying the severity of clinical manifestations .

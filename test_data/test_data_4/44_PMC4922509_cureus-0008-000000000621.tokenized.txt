introduction spinal epidural abscesses ( sea ) are an uncommon medical emergency with an incidence ranging from 0.2 - 1.2 of every 10,000 hospital admissions per year [ 1 - 2 ] .
pain with or without radiculopathy is often the initial symptom , and on average , patients present days to months after developing symptoms [ 3 ] .
these symptoms are very difficult to distinguish from cervical spondylosis , which is much more prevalent .
at the time of presentation , signs are variable with 39 % of patients having paraplegia , 32 % with fever , and 27 % with urinary or bowel incontinence [ 4 ] .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has been useful in improving the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess and has contributed to the recent increased incidence of sea [ 4 - 5 ] .
after diagnosis , urgent treatment , including antibiotics and surgical decompression , may be necessary to facilitate neurologic recovery [ 6 ] .
in some cases , the neurological deficit may not be reversible , particularly if there has been spinal cord infarction .
common risk factors for developing spinal epidural abscesses include immunocompromising diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , end - stage renal disease , alcoholic liver cirrhosis , and intravenous drug use .
spinal trauma is a rare risk factor for the development of a spinal epidural abscess [ 3 , 7 - 8 ] .
spinal epidural abscess after spinal fractures is thought to occur after the formation of a spinal epidural hematoma during the trauma , with the hematoma being a nidus for the infection [ 9 ] .
the majority of spinal epidural abscesses related to trauma occur in the thoracic and lumbar spine [ 10 ] .
cervical spine abscesses after trauma are unusual and described only in case reports [ 11 - 12 ] .
we present a unique case of a patient with a presumed delayed traumatic cervical spinal epidural hematoma revealed to be a spinal epidural abscess requiring surgical intervention .
case presentation history a 77 - year - old female presented to the emergency department with the loss of sensation in her bilateral lower extremities , followed by urinary and fecal incontinence , the loss of strength in both legs , and decreased strength in bilateral arms that began the prior evening .
her symptoms were preceded by six days of neck pain radiating into bilateral shoulders .
ten days prior to this presentation , the patient had been to the emergency room after a fall from standing that resulted in a dental fracture of the anterior alveolar process , requiring dental splints .
at the time of the fall , the patient had no neck pain and was neurologically intact on examination by emergency department physicians .
in light of her unremarkable neck exam , she was discharged directly from the emergency department .
her physical examination on initial neurosurgical evaluation was significant for a temperature of 35degrees celsius and no sensation to pain or light touch below the t4 dermatome .
motor strength was grade 0 / 5 in bilateral lower extremities , grade 2 / 5 in bilateral hand intrinsics , wrist extensors , and deltoids , and grade 3 / 5 in bilateral triceps and biceps .
no rectal tone was present .
white blood cells count was 8,900 cells / microl ( 4,000 - 10,000 cells / microl ) , hemoglobin - 10.2 g / dl ( 13.5 - 18 g / dl ) , hematocrit - 30.4 % ( 41 - 53 %) , and platelets of 237,000 cells / microl ( 150,000 - 400,000 cells / microl ) .
informed patient consent was obtained for treatment .
radiographic findings a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the cervical spine was performed , which showed mild multilevel degenerative disease without acute findings ( figure 1 ) .
an mri of the cervical spine with and without contrast was performed , the contrast being given due to her history of breast cancer , which showed epidural collections at the c6 / 7 level .
bone marrow edema in the c6 and c7 vertebrae was concerning for a non - displaced fracture , and disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament with prevertebral soft tissue edema was also seen at c6 / 7 .
given a minimal enhancement of the collection and the patient 's history of trauma and lack of constitutional signs , the mri was most consistent with an epidural hematoma and a low suspicion for an epidural abscess ( figure 2 ) .
at this point , it was thought that the patient was presenting with a delayed epidural hematoma requiring emergent surgical evacuation .

d ) t1 - weighted image with contrast ; no significant ring enhancement of the collection is noted .
operation posterior cervical laminectomies were performed extending from c4 to t1 with partial facetectomies. with gentle retraction on the thecal sac , the epidural collection was drained .
frankly purulent fluid was noted and culture swabs were sent for routine cultures and speciation .
instrumented fusion was then performed from c4 to t1 ( figure 3 ) .

postoperative course the patient was admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit postoperatively and started on broad - spectrum antibiotics .
c - reactive protein ( crp ) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) were drawn after the procedure and found to be elevated at 256.8 mg / l ( 1.0 - 3.0 mg / l ) and 71 mm / hr (< 15 mm / hr ) , respectively .
cultures from the abscess taken during the operation grew streptococcus anginosus susceptible to penicillin , ceftriaxone , and vancomycin .
blood cultures taken after the operation and administration of broad - spectrum antibiotics showed no growth .
as the patient had a penicillin allergy , the patient was placed on six weeks of ceftriaxone and managed by the infectious disease service .
at the completion of the antibiotic course , the crp and esr normalized .
upon discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility , the patient continued to have complete loss of motor strength and sensation in bilateral lower extremities ; however , she had improved strength of the bilateral upper extremities with motor grade 4 / 5 in the left deltoids , triceps , biceps , wrist extensors , and hand intrinsics and grade 3 / 5 in the right deltoids , triceps , biceps , wrist extensors , and hand intrinsics .
at her one - year follow - up , the patient 's upper extremity exam recovered almost completely with grade 5 / 5 motor strength in bilateral deltoids , biceps , triceps , wrist extensors , and right hand intrinsics .
the left hand intrinsics remained weaker at grade 4 / 5 .
she continued to require a wheelchair but had also shown some improvement in bilateral lower extremities with grade 3 / 5 motor strength .
the patient continued to have a neurogenic bowel and bladder .
discussion spinal epidural collections are frequently treated with surgical decompression with or without spinal fusion [ 13 ] .
both spinal epidural abscesses and hematomas are similar in clinical presentation , and their distinction by mri can be also difficult [ 14 ] .
a confounding factor was a neck injury that was initially unrecognized because she had little direct cervical symptoms with her acute injuries coming primarily from dental trauma [ 15 ] .
in this case , the patient 's recent history of trauma , lack of fever , leukocytosis , or other signs of infection and the mri findings , suggested an epidural hematoma , but surprisingly , an sea was found in surgery .
spinal epidural abscesses are rarely described following spine injury .
in some cases , the formation of an abscess may result from direct contamination of a fracture .
for example , in one case report , a patient developed a spinal epidural abscess in association with an esophageal perforation after a thoracic compression fracture and traumatic cervical disc herniations that were treated operatively [ 16 ] .
another case reported a fatal spinal epidural abscess related to a hypopharyngeal perforation and c5 fracture after a motorcycle accident [ 11 ] .
unlike our case , these case reports describe a directly contaminated fracture that resulted in a localized infection .
most cases of abscess formation after an injury are attributed to bacteremia .
a case series of spinal epidural abscesses focusing on their bacterial etiology associated six of the cases , all in the thoracic and lumbar spine , with mild traumas .
the series did not discuss the time course between the trauma and development of the abscess .
the authors postulated that mild trauma may create a site susceptible to bacteremia [ 10 ] .
in this case report , the patient probably suffered minor neck trauma that led to increased blood flow and bacterial seeding of mouth flora through the dental fractures to the cervical region .
unfortunately , as an abscess was not initially suspected , blood cultures were not taken until after broad - spectrum antibiotics had been administered .
therefore , although bacteremia was suspected , it was not confirmed by culture .
in another case similar to ours , an elderly woman developed increasing neck pain after a fall , and cervical osteomyelitis with an associated spinal epidural abscess was discovered and treated conservatively with antibiotics .
this patient had a known history of infective endocarditis that increased her risk of developing an abscess as well as mild immunosuppression from diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus [ 12 ] .
spinal epidural hematoma formation may increase the risk of abscess formation as the hematoma creates an environment suitable for infection [ 9 ] .
delayed presentation of a spinal epidural hematoma after trauma is unusual but may start as back pain with radicular symptoms and then progress to more significant symptoms , such as numbness and paresis [ 17 ] .
cuenca , et al. reported a case of spinal epidural hematoma presenting with back pain followed by paralysis of both lower extremities ten days after an initial blunt spinal injury incurred during a motor vehicle accident .
the spinal epidural hematoma was treated conservatively with steroids and patient had complete improvement [ 18 ] .
kang , et al. reported the development of a spinal epidural hematoma twelve weeks after a thoracic compression fracture related to osteoporosis [ 19 ] .
cervical epidural hematoma , requiring evacuation and decompression , has been reported to occur up to a week after the trauma [ 20 ] .
in this case presentation , the patient may have had an epidural hematoma after her initial fall that served as a nidus for abscess formation .
her dental fractures likely resulted in bacteremia that seeded her area of injury .
dental fractures have not been previously reported to increase the risk of spinal epidural abscess formation , but other odontogenic etiologies of spinal epidural abscess have been reported .
dental extractions are a rare cause of cervical discitis and epidural abscess [ 21 - 22 ] .
streptococcus milleri and corynebacteria , known bacteria to the mouth , as in our case , have been identified as the causative organisms in previous seas related to dental sources [ 21 , 23 ] .
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been found in sea related to an odontogenic source [ 24 - 25 ] .
case reports have shown that the diagnosis is frequently delayed up to several weeks [ 23 - 25 ] .
in our case , instrumented fusion was planned prior to the start of the operation as the patient had suffered a recent neck injury and a significant portion of the facet needed to be removed in order to drain the anterior collection .
even after purulence was found , we proceeded with instrumentation because of concerns over potential instability with the trauma , loss of bone , and ligament integrity .
bydon , et al. performed a retrospective study that did not show an increased risk of infection with instrumentation in the setting of spinal epidural abscess [ 13 ] .
these results were consistent with previous reports [ 26 - 27 ] .
in conclusion , we present a case of a spinal epidural abscess masquerading as a delayed epidural hematoma in occult spinal trauma .
surgical decompression allowed us to make the proper diagnosis and the use of instrumentation did not lead to an adverse outcome .
conclusions in conclusion , we present a case of a spinal epidural abscess masquerading as a delayed epidural hematoma in occult spinal trauma .
surgical decompression allowed us to make the proper diagnosis , and the use of instrumentation did not lead to an adverse outcome .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

as a newly identified factor in calcium - activated chloride channel , ano1 participates in various physiological processes like proliferation and differentiation , and expresses in human cardiac fibroblasts .
in this experiment , we investigated the function of ano1 in cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infraction ( mi ) with methods of western blotting , quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) , metabolic reduction of 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiozol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazo - lium bromide ( mtt ) , immunofluorescence and confocal imaging , and masson 's trichrome staining .
the results showed that the expression of ano1 significantly increased in neonatal rats' cardiac fibroblasts after hypoxia and in cardiac tissues after mi. after ano1 over - expression , cardiac fibrosis was reduced in vitro and in vivo .
moreover , the expression of tgf - beta and p - smad3 declined after ano1over - expression in cardiac fiborblasts .
in conclusion , ano1 inhibits cardiac fibrosis after mi via tgf - beta / smad3 pathway in rats .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction myocardial infarction ( mi ) is a leading cause of death worldwide1 .
although percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) has evidently improved the survival , post - mi heart failure still occurs after various adverse cardiac remodeling , including cardiac fibrosis , cardiomyocyte apoptosis , inflammatory reaction , etc2 .
cardiac fibrosis , characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , is a process underlying cardiac remodeling post - mi3 .
myocardium consists of cardiac fibroblasts ( cfs ) , cardiomyocytes , smooth muscle cells , and endothelial cells .
cardiac fibroblasts , making up more than 90 % of the non - myocytes , play a major role in normal cardiac function and cardiac fibrosis4 - 6 .
in typical cardiac fibrosis , exessive proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins are stimulated by cardiac fibroblasts in the myocardium7 - 9 .
cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological hallmark of many heart diseases including acute and chronic cardiovascular disorders , and contributes to systolic and diastolic dysfunction in many cases10 .
however , effective therapies for cardiac fibrosis remain undeveloped .
calcium - activated chloride channels ( caccs ) in almost all tissues regulate smooth muscle excitability , epithelial fluid secretion , signal transduction , nociception , cell proliferation and other physiological processes11 , 12 .
in 2008 , three research groups identify that ano1 ( anoctamin - 1 , also known as transmembrane protein 16a ( tmem16a ) ( oral cancer overexpressed 2 ( oraov2 ) , discovered on gastroin - testinal stromal tumor 1 ( dog1 ) or tumor - amplified and overexpressed sequence 2 ( taos2 )) located on human chromosome 11q13 is a key constituent of caccs13 - 15 .
the anoctamin family has 10 members including ano1 - 10 ( tmem16a - k ) .
ano1 gene contains 26 exons encoding a 960 amino acid protein that is composed of eight transmembrane domains ( tms ) and one pore - loop between tm5 and tm6 , and ano1 follows the biophysical properties of caccs including motility , attachment , and cell proliferation13 , 16 , 17 .
ano1 is also involved in tumorigenesis , like gastrointestinal stromal tumors , oral cancers , head and neck squamous cell carcinomas , breast cancers , prostate cancers , and glioblastomas17 - 23 .
antoun ei chemaly and his colleagues verifies the presence of ano1 in human atria fibroblasts24 .
transforming growth factor beta ( tgf - beta ) is a cytokine regulating cell apoptosis , proliferation , and ecm production25 - 27 .
in mammals , there are three types of tgf - beta : tgf - beta1 , tgf - beta2 , and tgf - beta3 .
tgf - betabound to receptors of tgf - betaphosphorylate downstream targets of smad ( homologues of mothers against decapentaplegic in drosophila and sma - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 in caenorhabditis elegans ) protein 2 and 3 at serine residues28 , 29 .
in 2009 , m.a.olman announced that tgf - beta / smad3 pathway induces myofibroblasts expression and enhances deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen i and iii via smad3 activation30 .
based on these findings , we propose that ano1 takes part in the process of cardiac fibrosis via tgf - beta / smad3 signaling pathway .

discussion ano1 acts as a mediator of cl - secretion in secretory epithelia , a heat sensor in neurons , a controler of smooth muscle tone , and a trigger in tumorigenesis .
since ano1 was first confirmed as a molecular basis of caccs in 2008 , it has been repeatedly found in proliferating cells .
however , in our experiment , we show for the first time that ano1 exists in rat cardiac fibroblasts and maneovers cardiac fibrosis after cell hypoxia or mi via tgf - beta / smad3 pathway , and that ano1 over - expression in cardiac fibroblasts or other heart tissues promotes cardiac fibrosis .
all together , ano1 is a potential therapeutic target in cardiac fibrosis after mi. nevertheless , considering tgf - beta / smad3 pathway in fibrosis , we cannot detect other fibrosis signaling pathway .
furthermore , we cannot study the effect of ano1 knockdown on fibrosis .
further experiments are needed to clarify these points .
in this experiment , ano1 mrna and protein expressionin cardiac fibroblasts of neonatal rats increased after hypoxia .
in 2008 , three research groups verifies that ano1 is an essential factor in caccs .
some other studies demonstrate that cl - channels regulate the proliferation of many cells34 , 35 .
ano1 expression is also down - regulated in smooth muscle cells isolated from the basilar arteries of hypertensive rats with chronic hypoxia36 .
in contrast , ano1 expression is up - regulated in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells of rats with chronic hypoxia37 .
therefore , the expression of ano1 after hypoxia is decided by the type of cells .
so one gene functions differently in different cell lines .
this experiment first found that ano1 expression increased in cardiac fibroblasts after hypoxia .
however , what brings this increase and which of ano1 and cardiac fibrosis comes first should be answered by further study .
we suggest that ano1 evokes the protective response to hypoxia and subsequent cardiac fibrosis .
to investigate the role of ano1 in cardiac fibrosis , we examined the effect of ano1 over - expression on proliferation and differentiation of rat cardiac fibroblasts .
our data indicated that ano1 over - expression inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts after cell hypoxia .
other groups have verified that cl - channels including caccs which molecular basis is ano1 regulated cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types34,35 .
moreover , ano1 impedes cell proliferation by arresting the g0 / g1 phase of cell cycle and reducing cyclin d1 and cyclin e expression36 .
our animal experiment showed that over - expression of ano1 largely inhibited cardiac fibrosis after mi. these results suggest that over - expression of ano1 can improve cardiac fibrosis after mi. however , how ano1 regulates cardiac fibroblasts differentiation and proliferation remains unanswered .
we studied the relationship between ano1 and cardiac fibrosis signaling pathway , and the relationship between ano1 and tgf - beta / smad3 pathway .
over - expression ano1 inhibited tgf - beta / smad3 pathway and subsequent cardiac fibrosis .
thus , we concluded that ano1 takes part in cardiac fibrosis , probably through tgf - beta / smad3 pathway .
nevertheless we cannot detect other fibrosis signaling pathway and the effect of ano1knockdown on fibrosis .
further experiments are needed .
taken together , our studies show that ano1 participates in cardiac fibrosis via tgf - beta / smad3 pathway .
for the first time , our data provide a deep insight into the role of ano1 in mi. this finding helpsdevelop a therapeutic target with ano1 for cardiac remodeling after mi. yao gao and yan mei zhang contributed equally to this work .

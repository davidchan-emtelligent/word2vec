highlights * we present data from 171 elective coronary artery bypass graft patients .
* we measured diurnal cortisol one month before and two months after surgery .
* cortisol slope two months after surgery predicted depression 12 months later .
* these results suggest short - term surgical recovery is important for later depression .
alterations in the diurnal profile of cortisol have been associated with depressed mood in patients with coronary heart disease .
the relationship between cortisol output and depressed mood has not been investigated prospectively in coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) patients before .
we aimed to study the relationship between cortisol measured pre - and post - operatively and depression symptoms measured 12 months after cabg surgery .
we analysed data from 171 patients awaiting first - time , elective cabg surgery from the pre - assessment clinic at st. george 's hospital , london .
the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) was used to assess depression symptoms and saliva samples were collected to measure diurnal cortisol .
baseline assessments of depression and cortisol were obtained an average 29 days before surgery , short - term follow - up of cortisol occurred 60 days after surgery and long - term follow - up of depression was assessed 378 days after surgery .
baseline cortisol slope was not associated with depression at 12 - month follow - up. however , a steeper cortisol slope measured 60 days after surgery predicted reduced odds of depression ( bdi >= 10 ) 12 months after surgery ( odds ratio 0.661 , 95 % confidence interval 0.437 - 0.998 , p = 0.049 ) after controlling for covariates .
these findings suggest interventions aimed at improving adaptation in the early recovery period may have long - term benefits in this patient group .
keywords depression cortisol coronary artery bypass graft surgery longitudinal 1 introduction cortisol is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression ( zunszain et al. , 2011 ) .
hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis abnormalities have been observed in patients with major depression , including increased secretion and reactivity of cortisol ( cowen , 2010 ) , elevated corticotropin releasing hormone ( nemeroff et al. , 1984 ) , and increased size and activity of the pituitary and adrenal glands ( nemeroff et al. , 1992 ) .
elevated cortisol has also been linked to cardiac risk factors ( brown et al. , 2004 ) and we recently reported that dysregulated diurnal cortisol profiles prior to coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) surgery predicted increased risk of death or adverse cardiac events in subsequent years ( ronaldson et al. , 2015 ) .
alterations in the diurnal profile of cortisol have been associated with depressed mood in patients with coronary heart disease ( bhattacharyya et al. , 2008 ) , and with history of depression in acute coronary syndrome patients ( messerli - burgy et al. , 2012 ) .
hpa axis dysregulation has also been associated with greater cardiac - related mortality in depressed patients ( jokinen and nordstrom , 2009 ) .
there are limited studies investigating cortisol in cabg patients , although there is some evidence of heightened cortisol output in the post - operative period ( gibbison et al. , 2015 ; roth - isigkeit and schmucker , 1997 ) .
the relationship between cortisol output and depressed mood has not been investigated in cabg patients before .
we aimed to study the prospective relationship between cortisol rhythm across the day measured pre - and post - operatively and depression symptoms measured 12 - months after cabg surgery .
2 method 2.1 sampling and procedure full details of the methods and participants used in the arcs ( adjustment and recovery after cardiac surgery ) study can be found elsewhere ( poole et al. , 2014 , ronaldson et al. , 2015 ) .
briefly , we conducted complete case analysis on data from 171 patients awaiting first - time , elective cabg surgery , who were recruited from the pre - assessment clinic at st. george 's hospital , london .
inclusion criteria permitted only patients who were undergoing elective cabg surgery or cabg plus valve replacement to participate .
cabg surgery was defined to include both on - pump ( i.e. cardiopulmonary bypass ) and off - pump surgical procedures .
in addition , participants had to be able to complete the questionnaires in english , and be 18 years or older .
the arcs study was powered to assess the importance of a broad range pf psychological , behavioural , and social factors .
on average , baseline assessments occurred 29 days before surgery , short - term follow - up occurred 60 days after surgery and long - term follow - up was 378 days after surgery .
all procedures were carried out with the written consent of the participants .
we obtained ethical approval from the south west london research ethics committee .
2.2 measures 2.2.1 predictor variable : cortisol slope full details of the saliva collection protocol has been described elsewhere ( ronaldson et al. , 2015 ) .
in brief , the saliva samples were collected using salivettes ( sarstedt , leicester , uk ) at set time points across the day : on awakening , 30 min after awakening , 10am , midday , 4pm , 8pm and bedtime .
saliva samples were obtained at baseline and short - term follow - up ; they were returned via post and stored at - 20 degrees celsius for analysis at a later date .
cortisol levels were assessed using a time resolved immunoassay with fluorescence detection , at the university of dresden .
the intra - and inter - assay coefficients of variation were less than 4 % .
the slope of cortisol decline over the day was calculated as the reduction in cortisol per hour ( nmol / l / hour ) , using regression methods .
the slope excluded the 30 - min post - awakening sample ( messerli - burgy et al. , 2012 ) .
slope values closer to zero reflect flatter diurnal rhythms .
two participants had missing baseline slope values ( n = 169 ) .
2.2.2 outcome variable : depression the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) ( beck et al. , 1988 ) was used to measure depression symptoms at baseline and 12 months after surgery .
it is a 21 - item questionnaire which asks the respondent to reflect on how they have been feeling over the past two weeks .
ratings were summed and we used a standard cut - off of </>= 10 to indicate no depression and mild to severe depression respectively .
2.2.3 covariates clinical risk was assessed using the european system for cardiac operative risk evaluation i ( euroscore ) ( roques et al. , 2003 ) .
euroscore is a composite measure of procedural mortality risk .
items were scored in accordance with the ' logistic euroscore ' method to generate a percentage mortality risk estimate ( http :// www.euroscore.org / logisticeuroscore.htm ) .
smoking was measured as a binary variable ( current smoker / non - smoker ) .
body mass index ( bmi ) was assessed at the pre - operative clinic appointment and calculated using the standard formula ( kg / m2 ) .
2.3 statistical analysis associations between variables were assessed using pearson 's correlations and dependent and independent t - tests as appropriate .
cortisol slope data were normally distributed , so the raw data are reported here .
outliers greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean were excluded from the analysis .
we used logistic regression analyses to assess the association between cortisol slope and depression status .
we controlled for several potential confounders of the associations , namely bmi , smoking status , baseline depression status and euroscore .
age and sex are included in euroscore so were not entered separately to avoid double adjustment .
inclusion of on pump surgery as a covariate did not change the results so is not included in the models presented here .
results are presented as adjusted odds ratios ( or ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
secondary analyses were performed using continuous bdi scores .
all analyses were conducted using spss version 21 .
3 results the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are described in table 1 .
the majority of arcs participants were white ( 90.1 %) , overweight ( bmi > 25 = 79.5 %) and male ( 84.8 %) .
the mean age of the sample was 69.29 , with a range of 44 - 90 years .
the mean bdi value at baseline was 8.15 ( sd : 6.00 ) and at 12 - month follow - up was 6.33 ( sd : 5.69 ) reflecting an overall decline in depression over time ( t = 4.296 , p < 0.001 ) .
cortisol slope was slightly higher / steeper at baseline ( mean : 1.82 nmol / l / hour , sd : 1.12 ) than at short - term follow - up ( i.e. two months post - cabg ) ( mean : 1.71 nmol / l / hour , sd : 1.11 ) , but this change was non - significant ( t = 0.934 , p = 0.352 ) .
univariate analyses revealed no difference in 12 - month depression status by baseline cortisol slope values ( t = 1.459 , p = 0.146 ) , so fully adjusted models were not performed .
logistic regression analyses , controlling for covariates revealed short - term follow - up cortisol slope was a significant predictor of depression status 12 months after cabg ( or : 0.661 , 95 % ci 0.437 - 0.998 , p = 0.049 ) .
this finding suggests that a one unit increase in slope ( i.e. a steeper slope ) is associated with a 34 % reduction in the odds of depression 12 months after surgery .
baseline depression was also a significant predictor in this model ( or : 8.050 , 95 % ci 3.525 - 18.383 , p < 0.001 ) .
this pattern of results was confirmed in multiple linear regression models with short - term follow - up cortisol slope ( beta = - 0.126 , p = 0.049 ) and baseline bdi ( beta = 0.537 , p < 0.001 ) predicting continuous bdi scores 12 months after surgery .
the relationship between short - term follow - up cortisol output across the day and depression 12 months after surgery is illustrated in fig. 1. 4 discussion we found that cortisol slope measured two months after cabg surgery was predictive of depression status 12 months later .
these results remained true even after controlling for potential confounders of this relationship , namely bmi , smoking and disease severity .
these are the first findings to our knowledge that has implicated cortisol in the manifestation of depression symptoms following cabg surgery .
previous studies have reported that there is heightened cortisol output in the days following cabg surgery ( gibbison et al. , 2015 ) .
there are likely multiple factors implicated in the dysregulation of cortisol after surgery , including both physiological mechanisms linked to marked increases in inflammation during the procedure ( biglioli et al. , 2003 ) and recovery periods ( poole et al. , 2013 ) , as well as psychological factors such as the experience of stress associated with undergoing a major operation and the related pain , discomfort and reduced mobility .
we did not see a significant change in cortisol slope over time , though our results did indicate a reduction in slope ( i.e. a flatter slope ) at short - term follow - up compared to baseline .
it is possible that this small difference in cortisol slope partly explains why we did not observe an association with baseline slope and later depression .
future replication in larger studies is needed to confirm this hypothesis .
in a previous study our group recruited patients with suspected coronary artery disease from hospital outpatient 's clinics prior to diagnostic angiography .
findings showed that a flatter cortisol slope was associated with depression in patients who went on to receive a positive diagnosis for coronary artery disease , but not related to depression in those patients who did not receive a coronary artery disease diagnosis ( bhattacharyya et al. , 2008 ) .
otte and colleagues ( otte et al. , 2004 ) also found an association between cortisol and depression in the heart and soul study , however the 24 - h urinary cortisol samples did not allow diurnal patterns to be explored .
combined , these findings suggest that cortisol dysregulation and depression may be related to the underlying disease processes in cardiac patients ; the exact mechanisms for these effects are not yet clear though as alluded to , one possibility draws on the inflammatory model of depression in coronary heart disease ( poole et al. , 2011 ) .
for example , there is evidence to suggest that pre - operative c - reactive protein levels predict depression experienced 6 months after cabg surgery ( yang et al. , 2012 ) and interferon - gamma measured in the days following surgery predicts depression 12 - months after surgery ( steptoe et al. , 2015 ) .
inflammatory data was not collected in arcs at the same post - operative time point as cortisol , preventing this hypothesis from being tested .
however , our study is one of the few studies to examine the complex interaction between cardiac disease , cortisol and depression using a cabg population .
the findings are clinically significant in that interventions to enhance recovery and reduce stress in the immediate post - operative period may have long - term benefit .
our study has a number of strengths .
the prospective nature of our analyses allows the direction of the effect to be explored , with multiple assessments of cortisol and depression .
the arcs study examined patients undergoing cabg at a single hospital and therefore removes the influence of inter - hospital variation in patient care policy .
however , there are also some limitations to our study .
first is the reliance on questionnaire measures of depression , since these cannot be used to define clinical depression .
secondly , since our sample was predominately of white ethnicity and male , our findings may not readily generalise to other populations .
next , since we only had a small number of depression cases , this limited the number of covariates we could include in our models .
finally , cortisol was measured over a single day ; although this is also the case in the majority of studies of cortisol and health outcomes , values on a single day may be affected by situational factors , increasing variability in findings .
5 conclusions a steeper cortisol slope measured two months following cabg surgery was associated with reduced odds of depression 12 months later .
these findings suggest therapeutic benefit may be attained by intervening in the weeks following cardiac surgery .
conflict of interest none .

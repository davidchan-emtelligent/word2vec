microbial communities closely associated with the rhizosphere can have strong positive and negative impacts on plant health and growth .
we used a group - specific amplicon approach to investigate local scale drivers in the diversity and distribution of plasmodiophorids in rhizosphere / root and bulk soil samples from oilseed rape ( osr ) and wheat agri - systems .
plasmodiophorids are plant - and stramenopile - associated protists including well known plant pathogens as well as symptomless endobiotic species .
we detected 28 plasmodiophorid lineages ( otus ) , many of them novel , and showed that plasmodiophorid communities were highly dissimilar and significantly divergent between wheat and osr rhizospheres and between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples .
bulk soil communities were not significantly different between osr and wheat systems .
wheat and osr rhizospheres selected for different plasmodiophorid lineages .
an otu corresponding to spongospora nasturtii was positively selected in the osr rhizosphere , as were two genetically distinct otus .
two novel lineages related to sorosphaerula veronicae were significantly associated with wheat rhizosphere samples , indicating unknown plant - protist relationships .
we show that group - targeted edna approaches to microbial symbiont - host ecology reveal significant novel diversity and enable inference of differential activity and potential interactions between sequence types , as well as their presence .

although it is widely appreciated that a broad range of microbial groups can inhabit the rhizosphere , most studies have focussed on bacteria and fungi ( mendes et al. , 2013 ; philippot et al. , 2013 ) .
for these groups , a range of factors can determine the specific communities which assemble in the rhizosphere , including plant characteristics such as genotype and age , environmental properties including soil type and climate , and in agricultural soils , management interventions such as crop rotation and fertilization ( bennett et al. , 2012 ) .
protists are also components of the rhizosphere microbiome ( mendes et al. , 2013 ) , and can also have marked impacts on plant growth through direct and indirect pathways ( bonkowski , 2004 ) .
however , they are typically not considered in studies of rhizosphere microbiology , largely because culture independent techniques to profile complex protist communities remain limited ( adl et al. , 2014 ) , with the result that there is little understanding of the factors which shape protist communities in the rhizosphere .
there is one protist group in particular - - plasmodiophorids - - that rarely receive attention in rhizosphere ecology studies yet are well known as plant pathogens and virus vectors .
plasmodiophorids ( rhizaria ; endomyxa ; class phytomyxea , order plasmodiophorida ) are parasites and symbionts of angiosperms and stramenopiles ( bass et al. , 2009 ; neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) .
plasmodiophorid diversity is much greater than the few known parasitic taxa and their broader role ( s ) in the rhizosphere are of great interest .
plasmodiophorids form obligate associations with their hosts , which are often green plants , but in some instances , they can also infect other parasites including heterotrophic stramenopiles , e.g. , woronina pythii , which infects pythium spp .
( dylewski and miller , 1983 ; neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) .
plasmodiophorids are the causative agents of economically significant diseases of crops including brassicas , potatoes , and grain crops ( e.g. , maize , rice , wheat , sorghum ) .
plasmodiophora brassicae is the commercially most important and best studied plasmodiophorid , causing clubroot disease in cruciferous plants such as oilseed rape ( osr ) .
clubroot has been shown to result in average crop losses of 10 - 15 % on a global scale ( dixon , 2009 , 2014 ; hwang et al. , 2012 ) .
other plasmodiophorids include spongospora subterranea , which causes powdery scab of potato and can also vector potato mop top virus ( beuch et al. , 2015 ; falloon et al. , 2015 ) .
polymxa graminis can infect most graminaceous crops where it does not cause disease symptoms itself , but can transmit several viruses , such as soil - borne wheat mosaic virus ( sbwmv ) , which is considered as one of the most important diseases of winter wheat in the central and eastern usa ( kanyuka et al. , 2003 ) .
polymyxa betae vectors beet necrotic yellow vein virus , which causes sugar beet " rhizomania ," resulting in ca .
10 % loss or the world production of sugar beet ( lemaire et al. , 1988 ; desoignies et al. , 2014 ; hassanzadeh davarani et al. , 2014 ; biancardi and lewellen , 2016 ) .
as obligate biotrophs , plasmodiophorids require specific , living hosts for the completion of their life cycle and to enable them to successfully reproduce .
but beyond these " primary " hosts , in which the full life cycle can be completed , some plasmodiophorids are associated with a variety of alternative hosts , in which often only the sporangial part of the life cycle can be completed , which results in the formation of short lived zoospores .
for example , spongospora subterranea , whose primary hosts belong to the solanaceae , can also cause small sporangial infections in hosts within the plant families poaceae , brassicaceae , leguminosae and geraniaceae ( qu and christ , 2006 ) .
polymyxa graminis , which has primary hosts including most poaceae , can for example also infect arabidopsis thaliana as alternative host ( smith et al. , 2011 ) .
similarly , polymyxa betae , which was considered to be a specialist pathogen of chenopodiaceae ( desoignies et al. , 2014 ) , has now been found to also infect graminaceaous hosts such as wheat ( smith et al. , 2013 ) .
the complexity of the plasmodiophorid life cycle ( bulman and neuhauser , 2017 ) , coupled with their small size ( 3 - 6 mum ) , makes them difficult to study .
specimen - independent molecular probing and sequencing of microbial diversity in environmental samples , referred to as edna ( environmental dna ) offers an alternative perspective on elusive and cryptic microbes to more classical organism - centric studies ( bass et al. , 2015 ) .
a recent edna study ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) investigated plasmodiophorid biodiversity by analysing root and soil - associated plasmodiophorids in a range of habitats , including a vineyard , flood plain and glacier forefield .
eighty - one new otus were discovered from just 6 locations , significantly adding to the 41 known phytomyxid ( combined plasmodiophorid and phagomyxid ) lineages .
this suggests that many lineages remain uncharacterized , the biological function of which is unknown .
given the importance of plasmodiophorids as crop disease agents and viral disease vectors , understanding the recently demonstrated " expanded " diversity and distribution of the group within agricultural systems is important to more fully understand crop health , parasite load , and organismal interactions .
a novel insight into the structure of plasmodiophorid communities and the factors modulating this can be deduced by objectively partitioning the community into core and satellite taxa ( van der gast et al. , 2011 ). by decomposing the relationship between distribution ( number of sample communities that taxa occupy ) and mean abundance ( across those sample communities ) , core members of the plasmodiophorid communities can be identified as those that are locally abundant and non - randomly distributed. with the rare satellite taxa defined as those that are typically in low abundance and randomly distributed through sample communities ( hanski , 1982 ; magurran and henderson , 2003 ) .
this is particularly relevant given that so little is known about the ecological processes acting on plasmodiophorid communities , including immigration and extinction , and competition and niche partitioning , all of which are currently unknown in plasmodiophorids ( ulrich and zalewski , 2006 ) .
for this study , we designed plasmodophorid - specific pcr primers to generate 18s rdna amplicons suitable for targeted amplicon high - throughput sequencing ( hts ) , to determine the local scale drivers of plasmodiophorid distribution and to compare their community assembly in rhizosphere / root and bulk soil samples .
the use of hts approaches for functional ecology studies of micro - eukaryotes lags behind that for diversity and / or phylogenetically oriented diversity .
however , the use of hts for both types of study confers the advantage of being able to detect a phylogenetically defined set of lineages without biases associated with sampling for , and accurately identifying , small and cryptically differentiated microbes .
we demonstrate that hts methods can provide information about host associations of microbial lineages without prior knowledge of the microbes involved or any assumption of specific host - microbe relationships .
materials and methods experimental design and sampling a field trial designed to investigate the influence of osr cultivation frequency on crop yield ( hilton et al. , 2013 ) was used to investigate the roles of crop species ( wheat and osr ) , sampling time and osr rotation frequency for controlling plasmodiophorid community assembly in rhizosphere and bulk soil compartments .
the field trial was in east anglia , uk ( 52degrees 33 ' n and 1degrees 2 ' e ) , on a sandy clay loam soil with a ph of 6.6 and available p , k , mg , and so4 of 32.4 , 111 , 28 , 30.6 mg kg - 1 respectively .
in the trial , osr ( cv. winner ) and winter wheat ( cv. brompton ) were grown together in different rotation frequencies over a 5 year period ( table 1 ) .
the trial was designed so that each rotation was available for sampling ( in different plots ) in the 2007 and 2008 harvest season .
the field was ploughed and pressed each season before establishment .
drilling occurred at the beginning of september for osr , mid - september for the first winter wheat , followed by mid - october for subsequent wheat .
local commercial best practice was adhered to for pesticide and fertilizer inputs .
for osr this included autumn herbicide ( diflufenican ) and insecticide ( cypermethrin ) , and spring insecticides ( lamda cyalothrin and cyclohexadione ) , together with nitrogen and sulfur inputs of 200 and 30 kg ha - 1 respectively .
for wheat this included autumn herbicide ( diflufenican ) and spring fungicides ( propiconazole , chlorothalnil and cyproconazole ) and 100 kg n ha - 1 .

percentage contribution is the mean contribution divided by the mean dissimilarity across samples , also given is cumulative % contribution .
otus determined as being core or satellite in a given habitat are highlighted in dark green and light green , respectively .
samples were collected in year 4 and 5 of the trial , from continuous osr , continuous wheat , 1 in 2 osr , 1 in 3 osr , virgin osr ( year 4 only ) and wheat after osr ( year 5 only ) .
in each case samples were collected from year 4 of the trial in june 2007 ( pre harvest ) , and year 5 of the trial in november 2007 ( seedling stage ) , march 2008 ( stem extension ) and june 2008 ( pre - harvest ) .
rotations were arranged in a randomized block design , with four replicate plots per rotation , and each plot measuring 24 m x 6 m2 ( table s2 ) .
at each sampling time , plants were excavated at 6 , 12 , and 18 m intervals along the length of the plot , with 6 plants collected from each plot .
bulk soil was collected at the same intervals using a 30 cm auger , and pooled within each plot .
plant roots were shaken free of loose soil , all lateral roots were excised from the tap root , and cut into approximately 5 mm sections .
the roots and closely adhering soil were designated rhizosphere ( for this study explicitly " rhizosphere " includes both root tissue and root - associated soil ) .
equal amounts of rhizosphere were combined from the 6 plants from within each plot , mixed , and 0.5 g representative sub - samples collected for molecular analysis .
bulk soil was sieved though a 3 mm sieve , taking care to avoid inclusion of roots , and a 0.5 g sub - sample removed for molecular analysis .
dna was extracted from rhizosphere and bulk soil using a fastdna ( r ) spin kit for soil ( mp biomedicals llc , uk ) following the manufacturer 's guidelines for all steps , except to use a mini beadbeater - 8 cell disrupter for a 3 min period in place of a fastprep ( r ) machine ( biospec products , inc. , usa ) .
10 mul of the original dna was diluted with 40 mul of molecular grade water to give a 1:5 diluted stock solution , which was used for pcr .
pcr amplification and sequencing of plasmodiophorid 18s rrna genes a reference pan - eukaryote alignment ( glucksman et al. , 2011 ) was used to design the new plasmodiophorid - specific primer pair 1301f ( 5 ' - gattgaagctctttcttgatcacttc - 3 ') and 1,801 g ( 5 ' - acggaaaccttgttacgacttc - 3 ) , which amplify the v7 - v9 region of the 18s rrna gene ( 18s rdna ) .
the specificity of these primers was tested by ( 1 ) blastn searches against ncbi genbank nr / nt database , ( 2 ) alignment against the set of plasmodiophorid sequences in neuhauser et al .
( 2014 ) , and ( 3 ) amplifying two dna samples separately positive for plasmodiophora brassicae and polymyxa graminis , plus a subset of six soil samples from the present study .
gel electrophoresis showed that all reactions produced a single band of the expected size .
the amplicons for p. brassicae and p. graminis were directly sequenced and yielded single partial 18s rdna sequences of c .
500 bp long that were 99 - 100 % similar to voucher sequences for those species .
products from the soil samples were cloned and sequenced as described in neuhauser et al .
( 2014 ) .
blastn and phylogenetic analyses ( see below ) confirmed that all 48 successfully sequenced clones grouped within the plasmodiophorid clade .
to generate amplicons for 454 sequencing , pcr reactions were carried out using 1 mul of dna ( at a final reaction concentration of 0.2 mum ) extracted from soil and rhizosphere samples in 24 mul mytaq hs mastermix ( bioline , london uk ) .
10 - bp mids and a and b 454 adaptors were then ligated onto the amplicons , which were cleaned using ampure xp beads at a ratio of 0.6:1 and samples were equimolar pooled following quantitation using a shimadzu multina ( milton keynes , uk ) .
sequencing was performed on a roche 454 gs junior pyrosequencer ( 454 life sciences / roche applied biosystems , nurley , nj , usa ) at micropathology ltd ( coventry , uk ) entirely according to the manufacturers protocol with no deviations ( libl empcr kit ) ( roche 454 sequencing system software manual , v 2.5p1 ) .
the sequence data are available via ncbi sra study number srp125323 .
bioinformatic processing of 454 sequence data and phylogenetic analyses qiime 1.8.0 software ( caporaso et al. , 2010 ) was used to filter the raw sequence files according to a quality score of 25 , sequence length between 200 and 1,000 bp , zero primer mismatches , up to six homopolymers , zero ambiguous bases and a maximum of 1.5 barcode errors .
the fasta files were de - multiplexed and partitioned based on sample identifiers .
the trimmed sequences were then incorporated into the uparse pipeline ( edgar , 2013 ) to remove singletons ( otus with < 2 sequences across all samples ) .
the amplicon reads were clustered into otus ( at 97 % sequence similarity ) .
the i - ins - i algorithm in mafft ( katoh and standley , 2013 ) was used to align these with plasmodiophorid sequences from neuhauser et al .
( 2014 ) that included the v7 to v9 18s region amplified by the primers developed for this study .
the alignment was then refined by eye .
three otus branched robustly within the non - phytomyxid outgroup and were shown to be angiosperm sequences .
otus that were different from a sequence in the reference database by three or more nucleotide positions in two or more variable regions of the amplicon were considered distinct lineages ; those more similar to reference sequences were considered to belong to the reference lineage .
otus that were distinguished only by nucleotide differences in conserved regions were considered non - distinct and removed , leaving a total of 28 otus .
these sequences were submitted to genbank ( accession numbers kx263011 - kx263038 ) .
the refined alignment for figure 1 were analyzed in raxml ( stamatakis , 2006 , 2014 ) blackbox ( gtr model + gamma ; all parameters estimated from the data ) ; bootstrap values were mapped onto the highest likelihood tree obtained ( stamatakis et al. , 2008 ) .
bayesian consensus trees were constructed using mrbayes v 3.2 ( ronquist et al. , 2012 ) in parallel mode ( altekar et al. , 2004 ) on the cipres science gateway ( miller et al. , 2010 ) .
two separate mc3 runs with randomly generated starting trees were carried out for 4 million generations each with one cold and three heated chains .
the evolutionary model applied included a gtr substitution matrix , a four - category autocorrelated gamma correction and the covarion model .
all parameters were estimated from the data .
trees were sampled every 100 generations .
one million generations were discarded as " burn - in " ( trees sampled before the likelihood plots reached a plateau ) and a consensus tree was constructed from the remaining sample .
figure 1 bayesian analysis of 18s rdna sequences of 28 plasmodiophorid otus generated in this study with all available reference sequences covering the same ( v7 - v9 ) 18s region .
the matrix to the right of the tree indicates whether the otus were detected in oilseed rape rhizosphere / bulk soil ( or / os ) and wheat rhizosphere / bulk soil ( wr / ws ) .
black symbol , core taxa ; gray , satellite ; absent symbols , not detected .
the tree contains 44 taxa ; 1625 positions included in the analysis ( of which the otu phylotypes account for c. 450 bp ) .
support values are shown for bayesian posterior probabilities > 0.75 and maximum likelihood ( raxml ) bootstrap value > 75 % , or lower at nodes of particular relevance to this study are mapped onto the bayesian tree .
black filled circles indicate support of > 95 % bootstrap and 0.95 posterior probability .
scale bar represents evolutionary distance in changes per site .
statistical analysis phylotypes were partitioned into core and satellite taxa groups as previously described ( van der gast et al. , 2011 ) .
fisher 's alpha diversity within each sample community was performed using past ( paleontological statistics , version 3.01 ) program , available from the university of oslo ( http :// folk.uio.no / ohammer / past ) .
fisher 's alpha was chosen as it is a measure of diversity that is relatively unaffected by variation in sample size , and completely independent if n individuals > 1000 ( magurran , 2004 ) .
two - sample t - tests with bonferroni correction , regression analysis , coefficients of determination ( r2 ) , residuals and significance ( p ) were calculated using xlstat ( version 2015.1.01 , addinsoft , paris , france ) .
bray - curtis quantitative index of dissimilarity , analysis of similarities ( anosim ) , and similarity of percentages ( simper ) were performed using the past program ( hammer et al. , 2001 ) .
the bray - curtis index was used as the underpinning community dissimilarity measure for both anosim and simper .
results from the 160 samples , 196,196 plasmodiophorid sequences remained after quality screening , with an average sequence read length of 404 bp and an average of 1,226 sequences per sample .
these resolved into 28 plasmodiophorid otus ( plus three discarded plant otus ) , whose phylogenetic position in relation to characterized plasmodiophorids with full 18s rdna sequence overlap with the otu amplicons is shown in figure 1 .
gray vertical lines to the right of the branch tip labels indicate the five otus that were effectively identical ( allowing for low levels of pcr / sequencing error ) to sequences in public databases .
the other 22 otus were all novel , although some are likely to correspond with phylotypes shown in neuhauser et al .
( 2014 ) , which ca n't be directly tested as the amplicon regions do not overlap and therefore preclude phylogenetic comparison .
three otus ( 2 , 11 , 1 ) were identical to named plasmodiophorids : polymyxa graminis , p. betae , and spongospora nasturtii respectively .
the otus were distributed across the known phylogenetic range of plasmodiophorids .
ten otus were closely related to characterized plasmodiophorids ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) : sorosphaerula veronicae ( associated with the herb veronica spp. ) , s. viticola ( vitaceous vines ) , polymyxa graminis ( poaceae ) and p. betae ( chenopodiaceae / ameranthaceae ) , woronina pythii ( parasite of the oomycete pythium spp. ) , spongospora subterranea ( solanaceae ) , and s. nasturtii ( watercress ) .
the other otus were not clearly related to known plamodiophorids , and in some cases ( otus 17 , 14 , 23 , 15 , 19 , 4 , and otus 13 , 22 , 9 , 6 ) formed two diverse clades whose only previously known members were from environmental sequencing studies .
the first of these clades is particularly interesting as it has a moderately well supported sister relationship with the clubroot pathogen plasmodiophora brassicae , with otus 4 and 19 the most similar to p. brassicae , but otus 14 , 15 , 17 , and 23 are more closely related to sequences from the baltic sea ( fn690466 ) and a freshwater lake moss pillar in the antarctic ( ab695525 ) , both high latitude habitats .
furthermore , this clade is apparently absent from the environmental survey in neuhauser et al .
( 2014 ) ; we hereon refer to this clade as plasx .
the second clade includes the freshwater - derived eu910610 and two previously detected environmental sequences from the volga floodplain ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) ; which we refer to subsequently as the " plasy " clade .
since there were only minor effects of sampling time on community composition ( table s1 ) , plasmodiophorid samples were separated into four distinct habitat types from across the 2007 and 2008 seasons : wheat rhizosphere ( n = 28 ) , wheat bulk soil ( n = 28 ) , osr rhizosphere ( n = 52 ) , and osr bulk soil ( n = 52 ) .
subsequently , the relative abundance and distributions of the plasmodiophorid otus were analyzed within a metacommunity framework for each habitat .
distribution abundance relationships ( dars ) were plotted to ascertain whether each habitat metacommunity exhibited a significant positive dar and therefore represented a coherent metacommunity in each instance ( figure 2a ) .
consistent with this prediction , for each habitat , the abundance of individual otus was significantly correlated with the number of sample communities that they occupied .
next , dars were objectively partitioned into core and satellite otu groups by decomposing the overall distribution using the ratio of variance to the mean abundance for each otu .
the variance to mean ratio , or index of dispersion , is an index used to model whether taxa follow a poisson distribution , falling between the 2.5 and 97 % confidence limits of the chi2 distribution .
the indices of dispersion were plotted against sample occupancy for otus in each habitat metacommunity ( figure 2b ) .
figure 2 distribution and dispersal of plasmodiophorid otus among the rhizosphere and soil habitats .
( a ) distribution - abundance relationships for each habitat , depicted as the number of samples for which each detected otu was observed , plotted against the mean % relative sequence abundance ( log10 scale ) of that otu among all samples within each habitat ( wheat rhizosphere , r2 = 0.53 , f ( 1,20 ) = 22.6 , p < 0.0001 ; wheat soil r2 = 0.68 , f ( 1,22 ) = 47.4 , p < 0.0001 ; oil seed rape rhizosphere , r2 = 0.84 , f ( 1,22 ) = 112.5 , p < 0.0001 ; oil seed rape soil , r2 = 0.74 , f ( 1,26 ) = 75.1 , p < 0.0001 ) .
( b ) random and non - random dispersal of plasmodiophorid otus through each habitat .
visualized by decomposing the overall distribution using an index of dispersion based on the ratio of variance to the mean abundance for each otu .
this is plotted against the number of samples for which the otu was present in that community .
the line depicts the 2.5 % confidence limit for the chi2 distribution .
taxa that fall below this line follow a poisson distribution , and are randomly distributed and are considered satellite taxa , whereas those that are above the line are non - randomly distributed and are considered core taxa .
the 97.5 % confidence limit was not plotted , as no taxon fell below that line. of the 22 otus that comprised the wheat rhizosphere metacommunity , eight were non - randomly distributed and classified as core otu group members .
14 otus were randomly distributed across samples , falling below the 2.5 % confidence limit line , and were classified as satellite otus .
the phylogenetic distribution of core and satellite otus , and the samples in which they were detected are shown on figure 1. of the 24 otus in the wheat soil metacommunity , 9 were core and 15 satellite .
within the osr rhizosphere and osr soil metacommunities there were 8 and 9 core otus and 16 and 19 satellite otus , respectively .
further , the core group otus accounted for the majority of relative abundance in each habitat : wheat rhizosphere , 97.8 % ; wheat soil , 96.7 % ; osr rhizosphere , 97.8 % ; and osr soil , 96.9 % .
plasmodiophorid diversity between habitats was compared using fisher 's alpha index of diversity ( figure 3 ) .
for the whole metacommunities , mean sample diversity was not significantly different between the wheat and osr rhizosphere ( p = 0.28 ) and wheat and osr bulk soils ( p = 0.18 ) , but significantly different at the p < 0.05 level in all other instances ( figure 3a ) .
these patterns of diversity were also reflected between core otu groups : wheat and osr rhizosphere , p = 0.76 ; and wheat and osr soil , p = 0.14 ( figure 3b ) .
within the satellite otu groups , although diversity was more variable , osr rhizosphere mean diversity was significantly lower when compared to each of the soil satellite groups ; p > 0.05 in all instances ( figure 3c ) .
figure 3 box plot comparisons of plasmodiophorid diversity between habitats for ( a ) all , ( b ) core , and ( c ) satellite otus using fisher 's alpha index of diversity .
boxes represent the interquartile range ( iqr ) between the first and third quartiles and the line inside represents the median .
whiskers denote the lowest and highest values within 1.5 x iqr from the first and third quartiles , respectively .
circles represent outliers beyond the whiskers .
asterisks denote significant differences in comparisons of diversity at the p < 0.05 level determined by two - sample t - tests * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.005 ) .
analysis of similarities ( anosim ) tests demonstrated that the whole , core , and satellite groups compared between habitats were highly dissimilar and significantly divergent from each other ( p < 0.0001 , in all instances ; figure 4 ) , with the exception of wheat and osr soil otu groups which were not significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) .
similarity of percentages ( simper ) analysis of the whole metacommunity was used to identify those otus that contributed most to the dissimilarity between the four habitat metacommunities .
these otus are listed in table 1 , with typically , the abundant core otus contributing most to the compositional dissimilarity between metacommunities .
the impact of habitat type was assessed further at the individual otu level using volcano plots , by plotting fold - change in relative mean abundance against significance ( p ) values from two - sample t - tests of differences in relative abundance for each taxon ( figure 5 ) .
minimal significant impact was observed between wheat and osr soil and wheat and osr rhizosphere metacommunities , respectively .
while more pronounced significant fold - changes in relative abundance were observed between rhizosphere and soil metacommunities , irrespective of whether planted with wheat or osr .
anosim showed that rotation ( i.e. , crop frequency over the preceding 3 years ) had no effect on the whole rhizosphere plasmodiophorid communities in osr , but did affect the bulk soil community ( table s1a ) .
however , for wheat there was evidence for effects of rotation on composition of both rhizosphere and bulk soil communities .
these effects were mediated through effects on the core community , with no rotational effects on community composition for rhizosphere or bulk soil of either crop in the satellite community ( table s1b,c ) .
figure 4 analysis of similarities ( anosim ) and community dissimilarity between habitats for ( a ) all , ( b ) core , and ( c ) satellite plasmodiophorid otus .
given is the anosim test statistic ( r , as columns ) and probability ( p , asterisks ) that two compared groups are significantly different at the p < 0.05 level ( all significant differences were less than p < 0.0001 ) .
anosim r and p values were generated using the bray - curtis measure of dissimilarity .
r scales from + 1 to - 1 .
+ 1 indicates that all the most similar samples are within the same groups .
r = 0 occurs if the high and low similarities are perfectly mixed and bear no relationship to the group .
a value of - 1 indicates that the most similar samples are all outside of the groups .
also given are the bray - curtis quantitative measures of dissimilarity between groups , denoted as circles .
figure 5 changes in plasmodiophorid otu abundances between habitats .
visualized using volcano plots displaying fold - changes in relative abundance of otus between compared habitats .
positive and negative values represent increases and decreases in relative mean % otu abundance within a habitat when compared to another habitat .
the gray horizontal line depicts p = 0.05 , with otus above that line having significant fold - changes in relative abundance , whereas those falling below the line are not significant .
numbers for otus with significant fold - changes in abundance are also given .
discussion our group - specific pcr approach coupled with hts showed that plasmodiophorids are common and diverse in both rhizosphere and bulk agricultural soils .
positive relationships between abundance and distribution have been observed at many spatial scales for taxa when classified into different types of ecological organization ( for example , guild or community ; guo et al. , 2000 ) .
within the current study , we also observed significant positive dars ( figure 2a ) .
this indicated that plasmodiophorid otus , that were widely distributed throughout each habitat metacommunity were more locally abundant than the taxa with a more restricted distribution .
therefore , as has been observed for other ecological communities , the commonness and rarity of plasmodiophorid taxa within the different metacommunities was found to be related to their occupancy in the local communities ( van der gast et al. , 2011 ) , and allowed decomposition of dars to objectively catergorize core and satellite otus ( figure 2b ) .
plasmodiophorid assemblage differed strongly between the rhizospheres of osr and wheat and between all rhizosphere and bulk soil samples .
the only non - significant community comparison was between the two bulk soil samples .
therefore the plants clearly exerted a selective force modifying the plasmodiophorid community in rhizosphere / root samples .
it is known that the exudates of certain roots trigger germination of resting spores of p. brassicae and then can serve as alternative hosts ( friberg et al. , 2006 ; rashid et al. , 2013 ) , and it is likely that root exudates stimulate the germination of other phytomyxid species in a similar way .
plasmodiophorid diversity was lower in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil , illustrated by significantly lower fisher 's alpha diversity indices , particularly with respect to core otus in both wheat and osr rhizospheres ( figure 3 ) .
further , plasmodiophorid community composition was significantly different in this respect ( figure 4 ) .
in these cases the rhizosphere is selective : recruiting a subset of the pool of diversity from the bulk soil into the rhizosphere microbiota .
this trend has been observed in other microbial taxa in the rhizosphere ( morgan et al. , 2005 ) .
even if the change of local biodiversity is simply caused by missed detection of some otus due to relatively very high representation of others , or if its caused by an imbalance in copy numbers of the genes , it is indicative of a diversity shift between rhizosphere and bulk soil habitats .
significant shifts in the frequency of otu occurrence in the rhizosphere implies a positive or negative functional relationship between plasmodiophorids and plants , enabling us to infer a functional relationship between an environmental sequence and its hosts potentially offering a tool for the identification of secondary interactions .
in some cases these involved characterized plasmodiophorids , which corroborated or extended existing knowledge ( braselton , 2001 ) .
however , the majority of the otus defined in the study were phylogenetically distant from characterized species .
bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere are shaped by a variety of factors , including plant genotype , rotation and plant age ( hilton et al. , 2013 ; chaparro et al. , 2014 ) .
in our study , most variation in plasmodiophorid rhizosphere communities was associated with plant species , with rotation having minor effects on the community in wheat but not osr .
in osr and wheat crops 15 and 11 otus respectively were significantly differently distributed between plasmodiophorid metacommunities in rhizosphere compared to soil habitats ( figures 5a,f ) .
however , the community shifts were not the same in each case .
in the osr rhizosphere all but three of the 15 significantly different otus decreased in relative mean % abundance compared to osr soil otus ( figure 5f ) .
the three otus with increased abundance in the osr rhizosphere were otu 1 ( the brassicaceae - associated spongospora nasturtii ) , otu 7 ( spongospora - like ) , and otu 17 , which groups with the environmental plasx clade. of the other 12 otus which had decreased abundance in rhizosphere relative to soil , 2 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 24 , and 26 had the greatest abundance shifts and lowest p - values : otu 2 is the largely cereal - associated polymyxa graminis which will only form secondary , alternative infections in osr roots , otu 4 is a novel member of plasx , more deeply - branching than otu 17 , otu 5 is the oomycete parasite woronina pythii , otu 9 groups in the plasy clade , and otu 24 and 26 are related to the plantaginaceae - associated sorosphaerula veronicae ( figure 1 ) .
these may be associated with other angiosperm species ( e.g. , weeds ; veronica spp. are abundant agricultural weeds ) present in the bulk soil area but not in the crop plant rhizospheres , or other organisms ( e.g. oomycetes ) associated with other plant species .
the sequence of otu 1 was very similar to that of spongospora nasturtii ( af310901 ) , differing only in one homopolymer region in the amplicon , and therefore possibly representing the same sequence in this region .
however , the traditional taxonomic concept of phytomyxids based on the morphology and arrangement of the resting spores is not always well reflected in molecular phylogenies .
different plasmodophorid species can have very similar 18s rdna sequences ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) , so this does not prove that otu 1 is s. nasturtii , but it is certainly very closely related. s. nasturtii causes crooked root disease of water cress ( nasturtium officinale , a brassica ) in the uk ( claxton et al. , 1998 ) , and also belgium , france , and the us ( cabi , eppo , 2011 ) .
therefore we now show that this or a closely related lineage is preferentially associated with osr ( another brassica ) , and also negatively associated with wheat rhizosphere relative to proximal bulk soil .
overall the increase of otu1 in the osr rhizosphere is interesting from a biological point of view as it indicates a wider host range within brassicas including osr of the crook root parasite s. narsturtii or the existence of a closely related lineage capable of infecting osr .
equally interesting are otus representing currently uncharacterized lineages detected only via our environmental sequencing , which were also responding positively and negatively to the rhizosphere habitat , indicating that these lineages interact with the respective plant or another closely plant - associated organism .
it is notable that in addition to otu 7 , which has no close relative in figure 1 and otu 17 in the plasx clade , the related otus 14 and 23 were also positively associated with osr , being detected only with osr in this study , in both soil and rhizosphere. whether or not these interactions are those of a fully compatible host - parasite pathosystem or if they are of an " alternative host " type cannot be answered at this stage .
but any form of increased interaction of host and parasite will have an ecological role which quickly can translate into productivity changes in the agricultural context .
the wheat rhizosphere showed different plasmodiophorid associations compared to bulk soil from osr plots. of the 11 otus which were significantly differently distributed between wheat rhizosphere and proximal bulk soil , only two were relatively more abundant in the rhizosphere : otu 24 ( which decreased from osr soil to rhizosphere ) , and the closely related otu 25 , both of which are closely related to sorosphaerula veronicae but almost certainly not the same species .
molecular phylogenies have shown previously that sorosphaerula , polymyxa and ligniera form a well - supported clade with not as well defined borders between the genera ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) .
the known hosts of s. veronicae include different veronica spp .
( plantaginaceae ) .
it is worth noting that a species called s. radicalis has been described from the root hairs of different grasses from the uk ( ivimey cook and schwartz , 1929 ) as well as ligniera pilorum which was reported from poa spp. root hairs ( karling , 1968 ) .
however , no dna sequences of these species are available it is therefore possible that some of the otus found here might correspond to already described species without a validated dna record .
the nine otus less frequently detected in wheat rhizosphere than bulk soil ( otus 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 ; figure 5a ) include seven ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 ) that were also more abundant in osr bulk soil than osr rhizosphere .
however , the other two ( otus 1 and 7 ; spongospora relatives ) were more abundant in osr rhizosphere than soil , converse to the situation in wheat .
directly comparing wheat with osr rhizosphere samples ( figure 5b ) , the sorophaerula relatives otus 24 , 25 , 26 , 28 , and the plasx member otu 4 were significantly less abundant in osr , whereas otus 1 , 3 , 7 , 18 ( spongospora relatives ) , and 17 ( long - branched plasx ) were significantly more abundant in osr .
therefore the rhizosphere habitat of both crop types positively and negatively selected plasmodiophorid lineages from the surrounding bulk soil .
although these sets of otus overlapped , they were not identical , with different recognized genera being significantly shifted in each case .
further , the direction of otu abundance shifts differed between crop species .
it is important to note that different plasmodiophorid taxa are associated with particular plant hosts with which they from fully compatible interactions .
but from all the species mentioned above in relation to wheat and osr rhizospheres it is known that a number of other hosts can be utilized ( at least ) for a short time .
our results suggest some strong associations between protist and plants that were not previously recognized , and it will be up to future research to indentify the biological basis of these associations .
three otus were found in soil only and not any rhizosphere samples - - otus 16 and 20 ( both branching basally to the sorosphaerula clade ) , and otu 19 ( sister to otu 4 , which showed negative abundance shifts in both wheat and osr rhizospheres relative to soil ) .
these otus are not sufficiently phylogenetically close to any characterized plasmodiophorid to infer their ecological roles .
it is possible that they are directly excluded by other , positively rhizosphere - associated plasmodiophorids or other organisms .
another possibility is that they may be symbionts of other plant species present at the site in limited abundance ( weeds ) or that they are present in the form of resting spores , or that these lineages are symbionts of other organisms occurring throughout the soil which are relatively less abundant in the more specialized rhizosphere communities .
the only lineages with significantly different distribution between the osr and wheat bulk soil samples were otus 6 and 12 , which both group in clades not known to be associated with higher plants : otu 6 in plasy ( figure 1 ) , closely related to an environmental sequence from a freshwater aquifer ( and therefore possibly a parasite of an aquatic alga or oomycete ) , and otu 12 grouping in a clade with woronina ( a parasite of oomycetes ) .
in the light of the high plasmodiophorid diversity detected in this study the absence of any otu identical or similar to plasmodiophora brassicae is notable .
the pcr primers used had no mismatches with available p. brassicae sequences .
however , there is no history of clubroot disease at the sites studied , so its absence is not unexpected .
we show for the first time that many plasmodiophorids beyond the five well - studied plasmodiophorid agricultural parasites ( p. brassicae , spongospora subterranea , s. nasturtii , polymyxa graminis , p. betae ) are present in significant numbers in agricultural soils and in the rhizosphere , even if their known primary hosts are absent or rare .
generally , it is assumed that the distribution of plasmodiophorids follows that of their hosts , but the fact that phytomyxids can use alternative hosts ( neuhauser et al. , 2014 ) means that predicting their diversity and distribution is non - trivial .
within the wheat rhizosphere samples polymxya graminis - like otus 2 and 24 were predictably dominant , as wheat is a primary host plant of p. graminis ( table 1 ) .
on the other hand , the s. nasturtii - like otu 1 dominated the osr rhizospheres .
the primary host of s. nasturtii is another brassicaceous plant ( nasturtium spp. ) , therefore the organism represented by otu1 may interact in a similarly compatible way with a range of brassicas .
spongospora sp. are known vectors for plant viruses ( merz and falloon , 2009 ) , pointing to an additional interesting aspect of this interaction .
the dna - based detection used in this study does not itself discriminate between active and dormant forms .
however , in this system it is apparently sensitive enough to strongly indicate shifts in interaction dynamics between host and symbionts .
we show that functional as well as phylogenetic and distribution information can be inferred from environmental sequencing ( edna ) methods combined with a structured and biologically informed sampling strategy .
our results show that diverse plasmodiophorid lineages were positively associated with rhizosphere / root samples compared to bulk soil , and that the enriched lineages were different in wheat and osr rhizosphere / roots indicating that selection processes in the rhizosphere / root play a role in the establishment and persistence of plant - associated phytomyxids with the potential to increase or decrease the load of pathogenic species .

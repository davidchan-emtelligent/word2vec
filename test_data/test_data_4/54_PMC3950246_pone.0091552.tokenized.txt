to efficiently investigate the forage preference of svalbard reindeer ( rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus ) , we applied length - heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction ( lh - pcr ) based on length differences of internal transcribed spacer ( its ) regions of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) to fecal samples from r. tarandus platyrhynchus .
a length - heterogeneity ( lh ) database was constructed using both collected potential food sources of svalbard reindeer and fecal samples , followed by pcr , cloning and sequencing .
in total , eighteen fecal samples were collected between 2011 and 2012 from 2 geographic regions and 15 samples were successfully amplified by pcr .
the lh - pcr analysis detected abundant peaks , 18.6 peaks on an average per sample , ranging from 100 to 500 bp in size and showing distinct patterns associated with both regions and years of sample collection .
principal component analysis ( pca ) resulted in clustering of 15 fecal samples into 3 groups by the year of collection and region with a statistically significant difference at 99.9 % level .
the first 2 principal components ( pcs ) explained 71.1 % of the total variation among the samples. through comparison with lh database and identification by cloning and sequencing , lichens ( stereocaulon sp. and ochrolechia sp. ) and plant species ( salix polaris and saxifraga oppositifolia ) were detected as the food sources that contributed most to the svalbard reindeer diet .
our results suggest that the use of lh - pcr analysis would be a non - invasive and efficient monitoring tool for characterizing the foraging strategy of svalbard reindeer .
additionally , combining sequence information would increase its resolving power in identification of foraged diet components .

introduction svalbard reindeer ( rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus ) lives on the high - arctic archipelago of svalbard ( 74 - 80degreesn lat. ) where snow and ice cover most of the local vegetation for 8 months of the year [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
because of the long winter period resulting in relatively lower forage availability and poor food quality , the reindeer have to replenish fat reserves for winter survival and fetus development during the summer period [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] .
in addition , extreme seasonal variations in the high - arctic region impose strong pressures on arctic herbivores to feed on vegetation in a highly efficient manner to satisfy their energy requirements [ 7 ] .
previous studies have reported that reindeer are highly selective feeders and prefer lichens , mosses , graminoids , and various other plant species as food sources in the summer period [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
these preferences might be associated with their special nutritional needs ( food quality ) or plant biomass represented as food quantity [ 7 ] , [ 10 ] .
to investigate forage preference of svalbard reindeer , previous studies have used either directly observed feeding behaviors by tracking the reindeer or analyzed diet composition from undigested contents in feces or rumen sampled in killed reindeer [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 10 ] .
in general , these approaches have the advantage of providing direct information about diet and differentiating forage preferences by age and sex .
in addition , directly assessing food consumption irrespective of food digestibility could be an obvious advantage of this approach .
however , the direct - observation approach is very laborious because it allows monitoring of only a limited number of individuals at one time .
likewise , analysis of rumen contents requires direct handling of reindeers after killing and identification of undigested remains , which are difficult , laborious , and time consuming to perform .
recently , molecular approaches have been widely used as non - invasive methods to study animal diet from feces or food remnants [ 11 ] - [ 15 ] .
however , most of these approaches required laborious and time - consuming conventional sequencing methods , including cloning of pcr products and individual sequencing of clones [ 16 ] .
the recent development of next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) methods has enabled the increased use of ngs - based methods on fecal samples to analyze diets [ 16 ] - [ 20 ] .
the use of ngs technology for dietary analysis can provide an unprecedented amount of sequence data at lower costs than conventional molecular methods [ 21 ] .
however , in spite of the advantages , application of ngs technology for reindeer diets may be pricy because available and preferred food sources for reindeer are limited at a given time and each fecal sample would contain only several short - term dietary compositions [ 8 ] - [ 9 ] .
applications of length - heterogeneity analysis by pcr ( lh - pcr ) to study forage preference on the basis of fecal samples can solve various difficulties typically encountered in conventional sampling methods .
lh - pcr is widely applied , for example , to study the microbial diversity in natural ecosystems , and lh - pcr has been demonstrated to be an easy , fast , reliable , and highly reproducible method [ 22 ] - [ 26 ] .
lh - pcr is capable of discriminating amplicons originating from different organisms on the basis of natural variation in the lengths of its dna target regions [ 26 ] .
each peak in lh profiles represents distinct genotypes contributing to diet composition ; peak numbers correspond to minimum richness of diet genotypes ; and peak heights indicate abundance of each genotype [ 27 ] .
our study aimed to evaluate the potential applicability of an lh - pcr approach for dietary analysis of r. tarandus platyrhynchus .
first , we constructed an lh - length database of potential food sources , including various vascular plants , mosses , lichens , and mushrooms representing the local flora in svalbard .
second , we conducted lh - pcr of reindeer fecal samples collected from different sites in 2011 and 2012 .
third , we determined the forage preference of svalbard reindeer by comparing the lh - pcr profiles of collected fecal samples with the profiles in the newly constructed lh - length database .
materials and methods a. study sites and sample collection our study was performed in ny - alesund ( 78degrees53 ' - 78degrees55'n , 11degrees46 ' - 12degrees11'e ) , located at the northwest coast of spitsbergen island , svalbard in norway ( fig. 1 ) , with a permission from the governor of svalbard and registered in svalbard science forum ( www.rcn.no / ssf ; ris id : 4985 ) .
there are small research stations representing the most northerly human settlements , including dasan station of the korea polar research institute ( kopri ) in ny - alesund .
in this region , reindeer ( r. tarandus platyrhynchus ) are protected from hunting or any other human development such as tourism [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] .
the local vegetation includes short - growing plants , such as mosses , lichens ( cetraria delisei ) , the polar willow ( salix polaris ) , the purple saxifrage ( saxifraga oppositifolia ) , grasses and sedges , all of which contribute to the diet of svalbard reindeer [ 2 ] .
eighteen fecal samples of r. tarandus platyrhynchus were collected during august in 2011 and 2012 from two different glacier areas : broggerbreen and lovenbreen in ny - alesund , where tourist visits are restricted ( fig. 1 ) .
all fecal samples were collected only on the ground from the approved area near the dasan station .
in addition , various food sources such as common vascular plants and graminoids , mosses , and lichens were collected to construct an lh - length database and to determine forage preferences from reindeer feces .
the fecal samples collected were transferred individually into polyethylene bags and kept at 4degreesc on ice during delivery to the laboratory .
all samples were stored at - 80degreesc until dna extraction .

first letter of abbreviation represented directions : a : east ( austre ) , m : middle ( midtre ) , v : west ( vestre ) .
last letter of abbreviation represented two different glaciers : b : broggerbreen , l : lovenbreen. b. sample preparation and dna extraction dna was extracted from feces using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit ( qiagen ) following manufacturer 's protocols except for the lysis step .
for sufficient homogenization , we added one or two 5 - mm stainless steel beads ( qiagen ) in the lysis step and mixed them by shaking on a mixer mill ( retsch , germany ) at 20 hz for 1 min .
extracted dna was eluted in 200 mul of ae buffer , and dilutions of 1:10 were made in hplc - grade h2o for use in subsequent pcrs .
dna extracts were stored at - 20degreesc until further analyses. c. pcr amplification , cloning , and sequencing for construction of lh database the universal its primer set comprising its3 , 5 ' - gcatcgatgaagaacgcagc - 3 ' and its4 , 5 ' - tcctccgcttattgatatgc - 3 ' was used for amplifying the its2 region of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes [ 28 ] .
in each pcr amplification , 1 mul of extracted dna was added to 24 mul of the amplification mixture , resulting in final concentrations of 1x ex taq buffer , 1.5 mm of mgcl2 , 0.2 mm of dntps , 0.2 mum of each primer , and 1 u of ex taq dna polymerase ( takara , japan ) , in a final reaction volume of 25 mul .
pcr conditions were as follows : an initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 5 min , 45 cycles of denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s ; annealing at 50degreesc for 30 s ; elongation at 72degreesc for 1min 30s , and a final extension step at 72degreesc for 7 min .
pcr products amplified in the reaction were purified using expin pcr sv kit ( geneall , korea ) .
purified pcr products were ligated into the pgem - t easy vector according to the manufacturer 's protocols ( promega , usa ) and transformed into dh5alpha chemically competent cells .
cells were plated in luria - bertani agar + ampicillin medium with 40 mul of x - gal solution ( 2 % w / v ) for antibiotic selection and blue - white screening .
after the cloning step , 3 to 5 white colonies were selected and used in colony pcr for amplification with m13f and m13r primers .
an initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 10 min , 35 cycles of denaturation at 94degreesc for 30 s ; annealing at 55degreesc for 30 s ; elongation at 72degreesc for 1 min and a final extension step at 72degreesc for 7 min .
pcr products amplified in the reaction were purified using the expin pcr sv kit ( geneall , korea ) .
sequencing was conducted by a commercial sequencing service company ( macrogen , korea ) .
each obtained dna sequence was identified by blastn searches of the genbank database .
sequence alignments and length calculations were conducted using the mega 5 program [ 29 ]. d. lh analysis for lh analysis , fam - its3 and its4 were used in pcr amplifications .
fam - its3 was the its3 primer labeled on its 5 ' end with the phosphoramidite fluorochrome 5 - carboxyfluorescein ( fam ) .
the buffer and reagent composition of each pcr reaction was the same as described above .
for pcr cycling , conditions were modified to minimize amplification bias as follows : an initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 7 min , 30 cycles of denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s ; annealing at 50degreesc for 30 s ; elongation at 72degreesc for 1min 30s , and a final extension step at 72degreesc for 7 min .
three pcr products amplified under identical conditions were combined and purified as described above .
the lh analyses were conducted by a commercial company ( solgent , korea ) with an internal size standard ( genescan 500 rox , applied biosystems ) ranging from 35 to 500 bp , which covered most of the major dna peaks .
lh profiles were analyzed using the dax software ( van mierlo software consultancy , netherlands ). e. statistical analysis lh profiles of collected fecal samples were compiled and aligned to produce a large data matrix ( 15 observations x 221 peak variables ) .
lh profile data were centered and standardized to relative abundance before conducting principal component analysis ( pca ) .
we assigned " 0 " when a matching peak was absent .
pca was applied to the weighted covariance data matrix to reduce its dimensionality .
multivariate analysis of variance ( manova ) was conducted on three groups ( lovenbreen , ny - alesund in 2011 vs. broggerbreen , ny - alesund in 2012 vs. lovenbreen , ny - alesund in 2012 ) according to between sampling years and sites using un - rotated pc scores .
analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to test for statistically significant differences of major foraged components represented as relative peak area ( expressed as %) on first 2 pc - axis , and post hoc tests were performed by using tukey 's method ( p < 0.05 ) .
all statistical analyses were performed with s - plus 8 for windows ( insightful corp. , usa ) .
results a. construction of lh database from reference samples and fecal samples lh lengths were measured from 64 reference samples containing lichens , mushrooms , and plants and combined with blastn results ( table 1 and 2 ) .
lh lengths ranged from 333.4 bp for a lichen species ( ochrolechia sp. ) to 494.1 bp for moss ( polytrichum sp . )
( table 1 and 2 ) .
most of the samples identified as lichen had lh lengths of < 350 bp. mushrooms had lh lengths ranging from 369.3 bp for cortinarius saturninus to 450.3 bp for russula silvicola , and were divided into three groups by size difference .
plants and mosses had longer lh lengths , ranging from 364.7 to 494.1 bp , than the other predicted food species .
in addition , 22 unique sequences were detected from collected fecal samples by selection after cloning ( table 1 ) .
additionally , we conducted cloning with sanger sequencing from collected 15 feces to identify foraged food sources and included in lh database ( table 2 ) .
twenty - seven different sequences were detected including lichens ( c. delisei and stereocaulon sp. ) , mushrooms ( hebeloma sp. and cortinarius favrei ) , and common vascular plants ( salix polaris and bistorta vivipara ) .
several fungi ( cladosporium sp. , friedmanniomyces endolithicus , and thelebolus microsporus ) that do not form mushrooms or lichens were also detected from feces and they displayed lh lengths ranging from 329.8 to 406.3 bp .

fecal samples collected in 2012 showed lh profile patterns that were different from the lh profile patterns of the samples collected in 2011 ( fig. 2 ) .
most of the lh profiles had the largest peaks at approximately 335 bp , and they were composed of two major peaks that were shorter than 350 bp .

five of the six peaks that , according to their loading values , represented variables that contribute most to the first principal component , were assigned as lichens ( stereocaulon sp. and ochrolechia sp. ) and vascular plant species ( salix polaris and saxifraga oppositifolia ) on the basis of comparisons with the constructed lh database ( fig. 2 and 3 , table 1 and 2 ) .
plant species were detected only in samples collected in 2011 ( 59.8 % of total relative peak area , table 3 ) .

discussion detailed and accurate information on forage preference in accordance with seasonal and regional characteristics are very important to understand energy requirement of svalbard reindeer ( r. tarandus platyrhynchus ) as related to food quality and food quantity [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 30 ] - [ 33 ] .
our lh - pcr approach for fecal dietary analysis from feces could detect several preferred food species through comparison with a constructed lh database and sequencing results .
this strategy would increase resolving power in identification and efficiently detect various food sources from collected fecal samples .
svalbard reindeer are known as selective feeders , preferring lichens over grasses , and preferring grasses over mosses [ 9 ] .
our results of the lh - pcr supported the results of the previous study that lichen species may be one of important and preferable food sources in the study sites in svalbard , especially during the summer season .
more than 20 % of the total peak area represented lichen species in 2012 .
in the 2011 samples , lichen species also represented 7.4 % of total diet composition although the peaks identified as plant species contributed the highest percentage of the total peak area ( table 3 ) .
in addition , our results showed that lh - pcr on fecal samples could detect both seasonal and regional differences of feeding preferences .
although we collected reindeer feces from only three different regions and only in the summer season , significant differences in lh peak numbers and relative peak areas (%) varying by sampling year and site suggested an abundance of different food sources foraged by reindeer ( table 2 and 3 ) .
these results indicate that the observed lh profiles reflect different reindeer forage preferences that are affected by the composition of the vegetation available in the different regions and annual season .
terrestrial mammals may make use of intertidal zones as forage sites during resource - restricted periods [ 34 ] .
hansen and aanes [ 35 ] reported that kelp or seaweed were foraged by svalbard reindeer ( r. tarandus platyrhynchus ) under extreme weather conditions such as icing associated with heavy rain - on - snow events .
most of these studies relied on direct observations of feeding behavior [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
we suggest that lh - pcr analysis of fecal samples can be useful for studying foraging strategy in the winter season .
in fact , we obtained 112 sequences deposited in genbank from 4 kelp species and 7 seaweed species growing in the svalbard or polar regions [ 36 ] - [ 39 ] .
we then predicted amplification lengths from these sequences on the basis of a calculated relationship between predicted and measured amplification lengths by using the information of the lh database constructed in this study ( y = 0.96x + 8.95 , r2 = 0.98 ) .
this in silico analysis indicated that lh amplification from kelp and seaweed should result in dna fragments with lengths in the range of 182.7 to 364.1 bp , which is an appropriate range for lh - pcr analysis .
we considered that the its gene may be appropriate marker for dietary analysis of reindeer .
reindeer preferred lichens , mushrooms , and mosses as well as various other plant species as food sources .
to detect all potential food sources from feces using lh - pcr , target genes must have enough resolution for various potential food sources and enough length variations .
the its gene of nuclear ribosomal dna is commonly sequenced in fungi than any other region of dna and recommended as representatives of fungal dna barcode [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
additionally , chen and his colleague tested that its2 region represents the most suitable region for dna barcoding applications compared to seven candidate dna barcode [ 42 ] .
they tested the discrimination ability of its2 in more than 6600 plant samples and identification success rate was recorded 92.7 % at the species level although this study was conducted on medicinal plants [ 42 ] .
also , it is well known that the its gene shows highly length variation compared to other conservative regions [ 43 ] .
to better interpret forage preferences from fecal samples by using lh profiles , several limitations should be considered .
first , it is necessary to construct an additional lh database for food sources used by reindeer not included in this study .
especially the construction of a local lh database would be useful to increase the resolution of the lh - pcr analysis .
however , despite these efforts , it remains difficult to identify a food source reliably if the difference in lh length is small between foraged species ( table 1 ) .
therefore , we recommend to apply the lh - pcr analysis in parallel with vegetation surveys on the study area to facilitate a more complete dietary analysis .
second , for technical reasons , the number of pcr cycles or template dna concentration could affect the results of the lh - profile analysis because of kinetic bias during pcr amplification .
in addition , lower dna concentration in template can reduce detection rate of foraged diet components [ 44 ] .
however , it has been proposed that decrease of pcr cycles could reduce kinetic bias in the pcr and give highly reproducible data [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] .
based on our preliminary experiments , we decided 30 cycles as an appropriate number of cycles for analyzing the fecal samples .
additionally , in this study , we could not compare the change of lh - pcr pattern according to the template dna concentration because dna concentration extracted from feces showed lower than other organisms , in general .
in further study , obtaining high template dna would help to increase detection rate and reproducibility .
third , collection of fresh or recently excreted fecal samples may be helpful to increase prey dna detection success .
decrease in prey detection success were observed when feces were exposed to rain and ultra violet ( uv ) radiation [ 12 ] , [ 45 ] .
dna from feces exposed for long time to environmental conditions were more degraded by various reasons , such as environmental factors ( rain and ultra violet ( uv ) radiation ) , enzymatic activities , consumed by microbe and so on [ 12 ] , [ 46 ] .
in this study , 15 feces were successfully amplified among the 18 fecal samples collected .
when we collected fecal samples , all fecal samples were collected without selection by time after excretion .
consideration of time after defecation will increase successful recover rate of prey dna from feces .
finally , combination with specific blocking primers will selectively prevent amplification of dna from fungal species that are not reindeer food sources in further study .
[ 47 ] - [ 50 ] .
such an application of blocking primers will increase the resolution and the accuracy of analyses for discriminating preferred food sources .
most previous studies involving dietary analysis require direct handling of animals and result in difficulties in the identification of food sources from remains .
our results show that application of lh - pcr analysis would complement the methodological limitations of the traditional approaches .
although there are several limitations to this approach as mentioned above , lh - pcr could be complemented by expanding an lh database for potential food sources and increasing resolving power in identification .
we believe that the use of lh - pcr analysis would be an ethical and efficient monitoring tool for investigating the foraging strategies of svalbard reindeer .

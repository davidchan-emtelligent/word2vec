the term ' personalized medicine ' refers to a medical procedure that consists in the grouping of patients based on their predicted individual response to therapy or risk of disease .
in oncologic patients , a ' tailored ' therapeutic approach may potentially improve their survival and well - being by not only reducing the tumour , but also enhancing therapeutic response and minimizing the adverse effects .
diagnostic tests are often used to select appropriate and optimal therapies that rely both on patient genome and other molecular / cellular analysis .
several studies have shown that lifestyle and environmental factors can influence the epigenome and that epigenetic events may be involved in carcinogenesis .
thus , in addition to traditional biomarkers , epigenetic factors are raising considerable interest , because they could potentially be used as an excellent tool for cancer diagnosis and prognosis .
in this review , we summarize the role of conventional cancer genetic biomarkers and their association with epigenomics .
furthermore , we will focus on the so - called ' homeostatic biomarkers' that result from the physiological response to cancer , emphasizing the concept that an altered ' new ' homeostasis influence not only tumour environment , but also the whole organism .

introduction the last decade has seen significant advances in the development of biomarkers in oncology ; they play a critical role in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms which drive tumour initiation , maintenance and progression .
a cancer biomarker refers to a substance or process that is indicative for the presence of tumour in the body and therefore it may be a molecule secreted by the tumour or a specific body response to it [ 1 ] .
genetic , epigenetic , proteomic and imaging biomarkers can be used for cancer diagnosis , prognosis and epidemiology , and some of them can be assayed in organic fluids like blood or serum [ 2 ] .
while numerous challenges exist in translating biomarker research into the clinic , a number of genes and protein - based biomarkers have already been used for patient diagnosis and care , including brca1 / brca2 ( breast - related cancer antigens ) , braf - v600e ( melanoma / colorectal cancer ) , ca - 125 ( cancer antigen in ovarian cancer ) , ca19.9 ( cancer antigen in pancreatic cancer ) , cea ( carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal cancer ) , egfr ( epidermal growth factor receptor in non - small cell lung carcinoma ) , her - 2 ( human epidermal receptor in breast cancer ) , psa ( prostate - specific antigen in prostate cancer ) and many others [ 3 - 6 ] .
several biomarkers may be used not only to screen for primary tumour or patients prognosis , but also for monitoring status of disease , recurrence and response to therapy [ 7 ] .
currently , cancer biomarker research is rapidly growing to elucidate the molecular pathways for inter - individual differences in drug response .
recent technologies and their application , in the field of cancer therapy , have enabled identification of genetic variations that may predict patient response to chemotherapy and targeted therapies [ 8,9 ] .
these genetic variations , together with epigenetic alteration ( like dna methylation and chromatin / histone modifications ) , can contribute to develop some new biomarkers [ 10,11 ] .
2. biomarkers in cancer tumour biomarkers are substances present in or produced by a tumour or by the microenvironment in response to tumorigenesis or progression processes .
they can be virtually used in early cancer diagnosis , anti - cancer therapy development , monitoring of treatment responses and detecting individual risk for cancer development ; for example , a woman that , during a screening , shows to be carrier of a germline mutation , such as brca1 , has an increased risk of developing breast / ovarian cancer [ 12,13 ] .
they can be used also to obtain other important information about the various aspects of the relationship between cancer and patient .
cancer biomarkers allow predicting the response to therapy , by evaluating the probable benefits of a particular treatment selected on the basis of the clinical information given by the biomarkers .
in this way , the choice of the appropriate treatment leads to the development of increasingly personalized anti - cancer therapies [ 14 ] ( table 1 ) .
there are several distinct types of tumour biomarker based on different tumour aspects : genetics , epigenetics , proteomics , metabolomics and imaging technology .

colorectal cancer colorectal carcinoma ( crc ) is the most common cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy in adults [ 15 ] .
treatments used for crc may include some combination of surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and targeted therapy .
most recently , biologic agents such as cetuximab / panitumumab ( monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor , egfr ) and bevacizumab ( a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor ) have been proven to have therapeutic benefits in crc alone or in association with standard chemotherapy [ 16 ] .
randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) have shown that colon screening is associated with a reduction in crc mortality .
in fact , some screening detects cancer at an early stage , when treatment is less arduous and more often results in cure , while other screening has the ability to detect adenomas as well as cancer [ 17 ] .
crc is a disease in which pathogenesis is influenced by genetic and epigenetic events that occur with tumour initiation and progression .
any biomarkers that have been identified can be used to predict clinical outcome beyond staging , and to inform treatment selection [ 18 ] .
the improvements in early detection , thanks to the screening and the use of prognostic biomarkers , have led to a decline in the incidence rate of colon cancer for the past 2 years [ 17 ] .
in clinical routine biomarkers [ 19 ] such as egfr gene expression , k - ras g13d gene mutation , braf - v600e gene mutation are considered for therapy ( table 2 ) .
table 2 .
genetic biomarkers in colorectal cancer patients .
biomarkers therapy egrf anti - egfr monoclonal antibody kras cetuximab and panitumumab braf monoclonal antibody 4 .
clinical biomarkers in colorectal cancer 4.1 .
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) is a member of the egfr family , having tyrosine kinase activity .
approximately 70 % of human colorectal cancers express egfr protein .
receptor dimerization results in the auto - phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of the two receptors , and in the initiation of a variety of signalling pathways leading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis .
therapies directed against her2 have revolutionized the treatment of her2 overexpressing crc and gastric cancers , and they have improved their clinical outcome .
anti - egfr monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) , such as cetuximab and panitumumab , competitively inhibit egfr by preventing its binding to endogenous ligands [ 20,21 ] .
4.2 .
k - ras ( g13d gene mutation ) k - ras , a member of ras proto - oncogenes family , is the most frequently mutated gene in all human cancer and particularly it is an important oncogene in crc .
the k - ras protein is a downstream effector of egfr that signals , through braf , the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway activation and promotes cell growth and survival [ 22 ] .
mutations in k - ras codons 12 or 13 occur in approximately 40 % of colorectal cancers and lead to constitutive signalling by impairing the ability of gtpase activating proteins to hydrolyse k - ras - bound gtp ; these mutations cause resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab [ 23 ] .
recently , published rcts have established the use of k - ras mutational analysis as a predictive marker for anti - egfr mab resistance in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [ 24,25 ] .
4.3 .
braf ( v600e gene mutation ) currently , braf mutations are found in 35 - 45 % of colorectal cancers and they are considered to be a prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis in patients receiving first - line colon cancer therapies [ 26 ] .
the biological evidence for braf - v600e mutations employment as an additional biomarker of anti - egfr mab resistance is strong : ( i ) braf is the immediate downstream effector of k - ras in the ras / raf / mapk signalling pathway and ( ii ) braf - v600e activating mutations are 100 % mutually exclusive of k - ras mutations in colorectal cancer , implying that the activation of either protein is sufficient for colon tumorigenesis .
previous studies support the use of braf - v600e as a negative predictor of response to anti - egfr mab therapy , leading to the evolving use of braf mutation testing in k - ras / wt patients [ 27 ] .
this is considered to be an emerging biomarker of negative response to k - ras [ 28 ] .
5. epigenetic biomarkers in colorectal cancer crc occurs in most cases as a result of both mutations and epigenetic modifications accumulated in several genes , particularly dna mismatch repair genes , which cause the progression of disease from early adenoma to carcinoma and eventually to metastatic disease .
in crc , the hyper - or hypo - methylation events have been observed at each histological step from the polyps to adenocarcinoma [ 29 ] .
hyper - methylation events on cpg islands affect virtually all signalling pathways , including those of tp53 , tgfbeta / smad , wnt , notch and tyrosine kinase receptors as well as those involved in cell cycle and transcription regulation , dna stability , apoptosis , cell - to - cell adhesion , angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis [ 30,31 ] .
conversely , hypo - methylation , characterized by the gradual and complete depletion of methylated cytosine bases ( 5 - methyl - cytosine ) in cancer cells , is observed even in early stages of crc until its development and progression [ 32 ] .
many studies have investigated the potential role of expression genes for prognostic use , and unsurprisingly most of them are similar to those with a high potential for diagnostic use ; in example , promoter cpg methylation of hltf and cdkn2a is used with prognostic and diagnostic functions in tumours [ 33,34 ] .
more recent studies have revealed additional epigenetic biomarkers linked to crc staging and progression .
methylation levels of genomic repeats , such as long interspersed nuclear element ( line - 1 ) , have been recognized as independent factors for increased cancer - related mortality .
line - 1 hypo - methylation constitutes a potentially important feature of early onset crc , and suggests a distinct molecular subtype [ 35 ] .
early onset of crc represents a clinically distinct form of crc that is often associated with a poor prognosis .
line - 1 enhanced activation through hypo - methylation is associated with increased genomic instability and enhanced cancer ability to penetrate surrounding tissues and metastasize [ 36,37 ] .
6. breast cancer breast cancer ( bc ) , the most common cancer among women , is a heterogeneous and complex disease , whose precise progression mechanisms are less understood [ 38 ] .
the molecular subgroups , also known as intrinsic subtypes of bc , have been defined by gene expression profiles , and they have distinct clinical features , metastatic behaviour , prognosis and treatment [ 39 ] .
despite the subtype identification , inter - and intratumour heterogeneity remain the principal causes of the marked differences observed in patients' response to therapy and their prognosis [ 40 ] ( table 3 ) .
table 3 .
clinical biomarkers for breast cancer .
molecular subtype biomakers treatment hormone receptor ki67 index tamoxifen hormone receptor expression loss of er positivity her2 + loss of her2 monoclonal antibody gain of er positivity triple negative gene mutations cmf or cef adjuvant chemotherapy neo - adjuvant therapy ( nat ) has become one of the standard treatments of patients with locally advanced bc ; it allows reduction of the tumour mass before surgery .
nat can be used to turn a tumour from untreatable to treatable by decreasing the volume .
the tumour burden reduction after treatment with nat influences disease - free survival ( dfs ) , or rather the length of time after treatment during which no disease is found [ 41 ] .
according to american society of clinical oncology ( asco ) recommendations , tumour biomarkers like oestrogen receptor ( er ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) and her2 expression should be evaluated in primary invasive bc for diagnosis , disease recurrence and especially as a guide for therapy , while increasing levels of ca27.29 or ca15 - 3 may indicate treatment failure [ 42 ] .
7. clinical biomarkers in breast cancer 7.1 .
oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor gene expression the status of a bc is routinely identified by immunohistochemistry through identification of both predictive and prognostic biomarkers [ 43 ] .
er - positive status has the best predictive value for dfs [ 44 ] , whereas pr - positive status indicates the presence of a functionally intact oestrogen response pathway , but it has primarily a prognostic and not predictive value compared with pharmacological treatment with tamoxifen .
moreover , high expressions of er and pr are predictive for benefit from hormonal therapy in adjuvant treatment in patients with metastatic disease ( stage vii disease ) .
current clinical guidelines suggest that hormonal therapy is recommended for all patients with er - positive disease regardless of their level of er [ 45,46 ] , even if not all er - positive metastatic bcs respond to it. recently , some reports have shown a genomic index for sensitivity to hormonal therapy based on genes associated with esr1 ( dna copy of the er ) [ 47 ] .
7.2 .
her2 ( erb - b2 ) her2 is a gene overexpressed or amplified in 15 - 30 % of invasive bcs , and it has both prognostic and predictive implications with a reduced survival [ 44 ] .
her2 - positive tumours show an over - expression of her2 protein , which has a predictive value compared to therapeutic treatment in patients of newly diagnosed bc. moreover , over - expression of her2 protein also shows a favourable response in patients treated with trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks her2 receptor , improving progression free survival and disease control .
oppositely , her2 - negative tumours do not respond to trastuzumab [ 48,49 ] .
in addition , there is new evidence that bc patients with her2 - positive tumours often benefit from topoisomerase ii ( encoded by top2a gene ) inhibitor - based chemotherapy such as doxorubicin or epirubicin [ 45 ] .
8. epigenetic modifications as biomarkers in breast cancer genetic and epigenetic alterations can control cancer induction and progression .
epigenetics refers to alterations in gene expression due to modifications in histone acetylation ( hdac ) and dna methylation of the promoter regions of genes .
in bc biopsy specimens , hdac - 1 is associated with er and pr expression ; its gene expression levels gain during the earlier stage of neoplasia , representing a good marker of improved dfs [ 50 ] .
hdac - 6 messenger rna ( mrna ) is more frequently expressed in er - and pr - positive bc patients with small lesions ( less than 2 cm ) and low aggressiveness grade .
however , different analyses failed to confirm that hdac - 6 expression is an independent prognostic factor for survival [ 50 ] .
in bc , cpg island methylations of gene promoter regions play a major role in regulation of gene expression involved in a large spectrum of biological processes .
aberrant dna hypo - or hyper - methylation should be useful as prognostic or diagnostic markers .
dna methylation in rassf1a , dcr2apc and pten genes is observed in snap - frozen primary breast tumour associated with different stages of bc progression [ 51 ] .
therefore , dna hyper - methylation of pitx2 ( paired - like homeodomain transcriptor factor - 2 ) was recently considered as a marker linked to tamoxifen response [ 52 ] .
a recent study [ 53 ] assessed methylation levels of cpg islands promoter of tumour suppressor genes , rarb2 , mint17 and mint13 during key steps of bc development .
they have showed that dna hyper - methylation of selected biomarkers occurs early in bc development , and may present a predictor of malignant potential [ 53 ] .
different epigenetic profiles have also been identified in hormone receptor - positive and - negative tumours [ 54 - 56 ] .
the methylation of hin - 1 and rassf1a strongly correlate with er and / or pr expression , whereas ril and cdh13 methylation closely link to negative er and / or pr. subsequent studies have shown that the differences of methylation profiles between hormone receptor - positive and - negative breast tumours can also influence tumour response to hormonal therapy like tamoxifen [ 56,57 ] .
9. lung cancer lung cancer ( lc ) is the most common reason of cancer deaths and [ 58,59 ] about 85 % of lcs are non - small cell lung cancers ( nsclcs ) , traditionally divided into three major cell types : adenocarcinoma (=~ 50 %) , squamous cell carcinoma (=~ 35 %) and large cell carcinoma (=~ 15 %) .
the overall 5 - year survival rate for lc has risen only 4 % ( from 12 to 16 %) over the past 4 decades , and late diagnosis is a major obstacle in improving lc prognosis [ 60 ] .
the most common symptoms are coughing ( including coughing up blood ) , weight loss , shortness of breath and chest pains [ 61 ] .
the presence of biomarkers in the plasma of patients with lc has aroused great clinical interest , since , with a simple blood test , a valid biomarker could be used for screening , diagnosis , prognosis , progression assessment and monitoring of therapeutic response [ 62 ] .
a number of diagnostic biomarkers for lc have been suggested [ 63 ] , including carcino - embryonic antigen , neuron - specific enolase , cytokeratin 19 ( cyfra - 21.1 ) , alpha - feto protein , serum carbohydrate antigen - 125 ( ca - 125 ) , carbohydrate antigen - 19.9 ( ca - 19.9 ) and ferritin .
these biomarkers have varied sensitivities for different subtypes of lc [ 64,65 ] .
the major advance in the treatment of nsclc developed from the recognition that specific genetic alterations define subsets of nsclc ; these subsets are characterized by genetic and molecular alterations in the egfr [ 66 ] .
however , the lack of a uniform approach to extraction and quantification has made the standardization of any particular biomarker difficult [ 67 ] .
10. clinical biomarkers in lung cancer 10.1 .
the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr is a 170 - kda plasma membrane glycoprotein consisting of a large extracellular region , a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity and a c - terminal tail .
the egfr family consists of four closely related receptors : her - 1 / erbb1 , her - 2 / neu / erbb2 , her - 3 / erbb3 and her - 4 / erbb4 with significant homology in their kinase domains , but differences in the coding regions for the extracellular domain and the c - terminal tails [ 68 ] .
the molecular analysis of mutations in egrf gene , its corresponding downstream signalling cascade and the related mutations have led to the development of novel therapies [ 69 ] .
data from this biomarker , when combined with analysis of histological material , are becoming very important in lc diagnosis as well as in patient stratification for therapy .
egfr is a widely used therapeutic target to treat patients with nsclcs .
there are mutations that are specific to nsclcs that activate egfr .
they are deletions in exon 19 and exon 21 point mutation , l585r .
these mutations result in ligand - independent activation of egfr signalling [ 68 ] .
two irreversible anti - egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of advanced nsclc ( gefitinib and erlotinib ) .
recent phase iii randomized trials with these egfr inhibitors , when compared with chemotherapy , have produced significantly longer dfs , higher response rates , less toxicity and a better quality of life .
the ' combination affinity ' of increased gefitinib and erlotinib with the mutated form of egfr is expected to represent an approximately threefold improvement over that likely from chemotherapy alone in unselected nsclc patients [ 68,70 - 72 ] .
10.2 .
k - ras ( gene expression ) k - ras is the most commonly detected mutation in nsclc .
it is more common in tumours with adenocarcinoma histology than in squamous - type nsclc .
k - ras mutation was previously considered a negative predictive biomarker for efficacy of egfr targeted inhibitors , but , to date , there is no targeted therapy with established efficacy in nsclc for this genetic mutation .
therefore it does not offer , at present , any clinical value either as a prognostic indicator or as a therapeutic guide .
currently , targeted therapies against activating k - ras mutation are undergoing active testing as a therapeutic strategy in lc [ 73,74 ] .
11. epigenetic modifications as biomarkers in lung cancer lc involves an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic events in the respiratory epithelium [ 75 ] .
somatic genetic aberrations , such as mutations and copy - number alterations , play a well - known role in oncogenesis , but epigenetic alterations are more frequent than somatic mutations in lc [ 76 ] .
lc initiation and progression are due to the interaction among genetic , epigenetic and environmental factors .
the dna hipo - or hyper - methylation is the most widely form of epigenetic alteration in lc ; the presence of hypermethylated gene increases with neoplastic progression from hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma .
many studies have identified a plethora of hypermethylated promoter genes such as rassf1 [ 77 ] , cdkn2a [ 78,79 ] , cygb [ 80 ] , rarbeta [ 81 ] , apc [ 77,82 ] , fhit [ 83 ] .
rassf1a is deleted or methylated in 30 - 40 % of nsclc and 70 - 100 % of sclc ; fhit is deleted or methylated in 40 - 70 % of nsclc and 50 - 80 % of sclc [ 84 ] .
methylation of rassf1a gene combined with k - ras mutation is reported to be a good marker of prognosis in detection of malignancy in false - negative or ambiguous cytology outcomes [ 85,86 ] .
12. prostate cancer in many countries , prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in males and the second cause of malignancy - related death .
the rate of pca increases significantly after 40 years and about two - thirds of all prostate cancers occur in men 65 years and older [ 74,87 ] .
pca may have various clinical courses with different features including slow - growing tumour with no clinical consequences , or rapid development which leads to aggressively metastatic and lethal outcome [ 88 ] .
the main therapy for patients with metastatic or progressive disease targets androgen production and its mediator , the androgen receptor ( ar ) .
these therapies , known as hormonal or androgen ablation treatments , refer to the administration of anti - androgens that block the functional action of ar [ 89 ] .
differently from other tumours , pca biomarkers are usually serum or urine markers , because there are not specific molecular mutations that may be used for prognostic or diagnostic aims .
the introduction of psa has revolutionized pca screening , and it has ushered in the psa era ; its employment as diagnostic biomarker has allowed an earlier pca detection , showing an increased incidence .
however , its use as a screening tool remains controversial due to unresolved questions about survival benefits , cost effectiveness , and some clinical factors such as the optimal screening age or the psa levels at which to recommend biopsy [ 90 ] .
13. clinical biomarkers in prostate cancer 13.1 .
prostate - specific antigen psa , also known as gamma - semino protein or kallikrein - 3 , is a kallikrein - like serine protease ; a glycoprotein enzyme encoded by an androgen - responsive gene ( 19q 13.3 - 13.4 ) .
psa is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland [ 91 ] and it is produced for the ejaculate , where its main role , thanks to the proteolytic function , is to liquefy semen in the seminal coagulum , allowing sperm to swim freely [ 92,93 ] .
psa is generally present in small quantities in the serum of men with a healthy prostate , while its levels are often elevated in the presence of pca or other prostate disorders ; for these reasons psa is the only biomarker that is used for diagnosis and prognosis of prostate tumour [ 94 ] .
the large use of the psa test has increased disease detection at earlier stages [ 95 ] , allowing a decrease in the number of patients in metastatic state [ 96 ] .
psa biomarker has been also used as a staging and prognostic tool as its high levels are found in more progressive stages or in more unfavourable result [ 97 ] .
in spite of this significant role , psa is organ - specific but not cancer - specific , and therefore it is not a unique indicator of prostate tumour .
in fact , serum psa levels also increase in benign prostatic hyperplasia , in size of prostate secondary to a non - cancerous proliferation of prostate gland cells [ 93 ] , in the prostatitis ( inflammation of prostate ) , in following interventions like biopsy [ 98 ] , in older age , in ejaculation and in the use of specific drugs such as male hormones .
so only 30 % of patients with high psa have pca diagnosed after biopsy .
besides , there are several factors that may cause decrease in psa levels , including 5 - alpha reductase inhibitors , herbal mixtures , obesity , aspirin , statins and thiazide diuretics [ 99 ] .
one of the main limitations of the psa test is hence represented by the false positives .
recent data showed that a substantial number of men had pca with psa values in the normal range and many of these patients had a high - grade malignant disease [ 92 ] .
over the last years , all these observations have impaired the association between psa and pca [ 100,101 ] , and in order to increase psa diagnostic specificity and prognostic ability , other parameters ( such as percentage of free psa or pca3 ) are now increasingly using .
13.2 .
percentage free prostate - specific antigen serum psa is present in different molecular forms that can be divided into two classes : free psa ( not bound ) and complex psa ( bound to protease inhibitors such as alpha1 - antichymotrypsin , alpha1 - antitrypsin , alpha2 macroglobulin ) [ 97,102 ] .
free psa represents 5 - 45 % of total psa .
its percentage is calculated by free psa / total psa x 100 , and it has been considered as an appendix to total psa testing , in men with a serum total psa value of 4 - 10 ng ml - 1 [ 96 ] .
many studies suggest free psa as a late - stage predictor of pca [ 103 ] and in particular the percentage of free psa seems to be inversely associated with risk of finding pca in biopsy [ 104 ] ; the researchers show that percentage of free psa is significantly low in aggressive disease conditions like gleason score >= 7 , metastases or positive surgical margins [ 105 ] .
gleason score is one of the most important predictors of disease outcome .
it is a prognostic grading system based only on histological pattern of differentiation and organization of carcinoma cells and its values can change from 2 to 10 [ 106 ] .
it is found that by using a percentage of free psa cut - off value of 25 % , it is possible to detect pca with 95 % sensitivity and to prevent 20 % of unnecessary biopsies [ 105 ] .
therefore , percentage of free psa could be a better predictor of post - operative pathological outcome when compared with gleason grade [ 107 ] , even if this opinion has not been confirmed [ 108,109 ] .
13.3 .
pca antigen 3 urine - based pca assays have been regarded as a promising tool for the acquisition of highly specific prostatic markers .
pca antigen 3 ( pca3 ) mrna expression levels within post - digital - rectal - examination urine have been evaluated as predictors for the pca detection on subsequent biopsy , whereby higher expression levels of pca3 have been associated with pca discovery [ 110 ] .
a urinary pca3 assay ( progensa , hologic inc. , bedford , ma , usa ) is currently approved by the food and drug administration in the setting of prior negative biopsy , where different studies have examined the predictive value of using pca3 thresholds to select men for repeat biopsy [ 111 ] .
14. epigenetic modifications as biomarkers in cancer prostate epigenetic modifications are heritable and reversible biochemical changes of chromatin structure [ 112 - 117 ] .
unlike mutations that involve an alteration in the dna sequence , epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression via chromatin remodelling [ 5 ] .
among the most well - studied epigenetic modifications are dna methylation and histone modifications .
epigenetic alterations are frequent in pca , and they can contribute to the tumour initiation and progression [ 118 ] .
although the mechanisms by which these alterations arise are not completely understood , their frequency is commonly higher in premalignant disease stages , giving them an attractive role for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment [ 6,119 - 121 ] .
dna methylation patterns may be the earliest changes in pca and in effect , many studies have identified a promoter cpg island hyper - methylation of genes , such as gstp1 , apc , rassf1alpha , ptgs2 and rarbeta2 ; this evidence proposes that multigenes promoter methylation testing could be necessary .
a multicentre study has validated the use of three gene panel ( gstp1 , apc and rarbeta2 ) as a diagnostic maker for pca [ 122 - 125 ] , and moreover several approaches have shown the potential use of ptgs cpg island hyper - methylation as an important tool for recurrence risk prediction [ 126 ] .
14.1 .
tmprss2 - erg a chromosomal rearrangement in pca has been identified and associated with earlier precancerous lesions ; it is the tmprss2 - erg , fusion gene between transmembrane protease serine 2 ( tmprss2 ) and v - ets avian erythroblastosis virus e26 oncogene homologue ( erg ) .
measurement of the tmprss2 - erg in urine , using quantitative nucleic acid amplification , has been evaluated as a marker , with high specificity for pca , for disease in the pre - diagnosis setting .
the combination of pca3 levels with tmprss2 - erg measurement may offer improved discrimination of disease on biopsy [ 127,128 ] .
14.2 .
glutathione - s - transferase p1 ( gstp1 ) this gene encodes an enzyme required for dna detoxification and for its protection from oxidants and electrophilic metabolites , is a potential epigenetic biomarker due to its high specificity ( more than 80 %) compared with psa serum .
several studies have focused on the use of gstp1 as potential diagnostic or / and prognostic biomarker .
gstp1 hyper - methylation levels can be correlated to different disease stages or recurrence risk after treatment and its presence in serum , plasma and urine could be used to screen men when the value of other biomarkers is borderline .
however , despite being highly specific , it appears to have a low sensitivity ( 18 - 40 %) [ 129 - 131 ] .
15. homeostatic biomarkers and role in cancer prediction the human body constantly interacts with the external environment that exposes it to several natural and artificial agents ; they can produce irreversible damage or reversible imbalance of homeostatic processes causing various diseases , including cancer .
homeostasis alterations can influence the function of epigenetic regulation , tissue architecture and immune system play [ 132 - 134 ] .
homeostasis is a complex process due to the continuous monitoring of several physiological parameters and functions ( such as the blood pressure , temperature , acid - base balance and water - salt balance ) that are regulated to maintain human body stability ; so that the cells can continue to live and work regularly in a suitable environment to their needs [ 58 ] .
changes in the homeostatic balance can influence fluid composition ; therefore , an environmental alteration ( volume and physical - chemical composition ) activates the homeostatic mechanism to correct such imbalance and to re - establish all parameters ( volume of water , the concentration of ions , hormones , osmotic pressure , oxygen tension and ph ) within ' physiological ' range of values .
this mechanism allows a ' new homeostasis' inside the tumour due to the cancer cells' ability to adapt to the environment , establishing new balances , different from previously altered ones .
the homeostatic switch can be evaluated monitoring different indexes : metabolic , neuroendocrine , immune and physiological parameters [ 135 ] .
these parameters can be correlate with tumour progression and they can be considered as prognostic disease markers .
the metabolic alterations are the first changes that occur in oncological patients ; the typical parameters of this new condition are lactate , enzymatic activities , oxidative stress biomarkers , nos / no , cholesterol and many others [ 136,137 ] .
acidosis , for example , is common in cancer , for which homeostatic markers of this condition may be represented by the metabolic enzymes such as ldh or ph parameters like ph extracellular values ( phe ) , representative of the known warburg effect ( i.e. the phenomenon in which tumour cells rely mainly on glycolysis for energy production even in the presence of sufficient oxygen , which is the most outstanding characteristic of energy metabolism in cancer cells [ 138,139 ]) .
cancer cells employ this altered metabolism to sustain a high proliferation rate [ 140 ] .
the lactate dehydrogenase - a that catalyses the inter - conversion of pyruvate and lactate is the main enzyme responsible for the warburg effect , thus it is upregulated in human cancers and associated with aggressive tumour outcomes [ 141 ] .
therefore , in cancer , many studies have targeted the glycolytic pathway , and in particular ldh enzyme , with the aim to develop or to screen new innovative anti - cancer strategies [ 142,143 ] .
changes in tumour phe values can be assessed by different molecular imaging techniques such as 64cu pet - based imaging , hyperpolarized mri or acid cest mri .
importantly , several studies have shown a correlation between anti - cancer metabolism targeted therapies and reduced growth rate or apoptotic responses , so phe may be also used , during treatment , as a biomarker for determining drug efficacy and much sooner than detecting a reduced tumour volume with morphological imaging [ 144 ] .
the tcga ( the cancer genome atlas ) project using next - generation sequencing has profiled the mutational status and expression levels of all the genes involved in diverse cancers , including those that have a role in cholesterol metabolism , showing the role of the cholesterol pathway in cancer development and supporting a correlation between these genes and the disease prognosis [ 145 ] .
neuroendocrine system participate in disease development ; the main biomarkers can be catecholamine , actc , glucocorticoids , neuropeptide y , prolactin and serotonin [ 146 ] .
homeostatic responses can involve localized body regions or the whole body .
the nervous system is one of the main homeostatic regulation systems , whose alterations could affect its specific control functions ; some of these alterations could be represented by stress or depression conditions .
usually , these conditions are more frequent in oncologic patients .
stress or depression conditions influence tumour growth and metastasis development .
for these reasons , indirect homeostatic biomarkers , such as epinephrine , norepinephrine and cortisol , can be evaluated .
in effect , different studies have demonstrate , in vitro and in vivo , that higher stress hormones can influence proliferation rate , migration , tumour growth and metastasis ; these data have also been confirmed by the use of beta blocker agents , suggesting the role of stress markers in the prognosis in various cancer [ 147 - 149 ] .
the evaluation of inflammatory / immunity indexes and physiological parameters ( cardiac frequency , vo2 max , body temperature and eeg ) is important to determinate the complete oncological patient status both in diagnosis and prognosis .
for this reason , during follow - up , it is important to check inflammatory profile ( pcr , ves , neutrophilia , cytokines , urinary ph ) , immune outline , oxidative stress markers ( endogenous and exogenous antioxidants ) and other homeostatic parameters beyond specific molecular disease markers .
the prognostic value of these markers is fundamental to evaluate every phase of the pathology progression and treatment response , with the aim to adopt personalized therapies and improve lifestyle , and to improve the patient healing .
16. discussion and conclusion translational research on tumour biomarkers has successfully promoted new strategies for therapeutic treatment of cancer , instilling new hopes for cancer patients [ 150 ] .
biomarkers can influence the diagnosis and , consequently , the treatment of almost every patient with cancer .
thus , particular emphasis needs to be directed to the clinical approach , which will provide researchers with a critical point of view to improve solutions for patients .
the development of new drugs requires high levels of attention and every compound needs to be tested in carefully designed and randomized clinical trials prior to governmental approval .
unfortunately , similar requirements are not mandatory for biomarkers , although they too can significantly influence patient outcomes .
therefore , it is important for clinical , translational and laboratory - based researchers to be acutely aware about the importance of the appropriate biomarker , in order to introduce them in clinical practice .
in addition , the introduction of biomarkers that have not been sufficiently evaluated should be avoided because they could not only be ineffective , but even potentially detrimental to patient care .
the initial conditions of cancer begin as an imbalance between the instability of the body system and the homeostatic mechanisms .
in normal condition , the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death , usually by apoptosis , is strictly maintained by a fine regulation of both processes that ensure the integrity of organs and tissues .
mutations in dna produce dysregulation and impairment of these regulatory processes , and subsequently lead to cancer .
however , genomic and epigenomic alterations do not contemplate the countless interactions of homeostatic processes that occur in every living organism .
in our opinion , cancer should not be considered as an indistinct entity in an organism , but as a strongly connected entity with the body itself .
most importantly , we should improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approach , also considering those markers of homeostasis that are indices of the operation of the body system in toto .
we therefore propose a medicine no longer genomic - centric but human - centric .

summary : the network ontology analysis ( noa ) plugin for cytoscape implements the noa algorithm for network - based enrichment analysis , which extends gene ontology annotations to network links , or edges .
the plugin facilitates the annotation and analysis of one or more networks in cytoscape according to user - defined parameters .
in addition to tables , the noa plugin also presents results in the form of heatmaps and overview networks in cytoscape , which can be exported for publication figures .
availability : the noa plugin is an open source , java program for cytoscape version 2.8 available via the cytoscape app store ( http :// apps.cytoscape.org / apps / noa ) and plugin manager .
a detailed user manual is available at http :// nrnb.org / tools / noa .

1 introduction to make use of the vast wealth of data and knowledge to elucidate the function of biological networks is one of the biggest challenges in bioinformatics .
the development of high - throughput technology has given rise to an enormous increase of data on biomolecular expression and interactions , which results in protein interaction networks , gene regulatory networks , signaling networks and metabolic networks .
one approach to understanding networks relies on ontologies , such as gene ontology ( go ) , and enrichment analysis .
common approaches , such as bingo ( maere et al. , 2005 ) , regard a network as a list of genes , performing gene - level annotation and enrichment methods .
however , it is apparent that the same list of genes with different interactions may perform different functions .
thus , the functional analysis of networks should take into consideration network topology .
our previous work introduced the network ontology analysis ( noa ) algorithm to perform gene ontology enrichment analysis on biological networks ( wang et al. , 2011 ) .
first , noa assigns ontology terms to interactions based on the known annotations of connected genes via optimizing two novel indexes ' coverage ' and ' diversity ' .
then , noa generates two alternative reference sets to statistically rank the enriched functional terms for a given biological network .
noa was shown to be more efficient not only for dynamic regulatory networks but also for rewired protein interaction networks .
however , there are several shortcomings with the initial implementation : no graphical interface or visualization of results ; limited support for species , gene names and ontology types ; no batch mode for large - scale computation ; and no integration or interoperability with other network tools .
to overcome these shortcomings , we have reimplemented the noa algorithm as a cytoscape plugin and added interfaces , extensible ontology and identifier support , new visualizations , a batch mode and interoperability with other cytoscape plugins , as demonstrated with cythesaurus ( van iersel et al. , 2010 ) and mosaic ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
2 methods 2.1 algorithms the original noa algorithm was described in ( wang et al. , 2011 ) .
in the noa plugin , we have enhanced the network annotation algorithm to include standard statistical enrichment methods ( e.g. hypergeometric distribution , fisher 's exact test and z - score ) .
we also added the option of running a conventional node - based analysis ( i.e. gene set enrichment ) , to complement the edge - based approach .
several widely used correction methods have been used to control the type i error rate of multiple hypotheses testing , such as bonferroni and benjiamini & hochberg methods .
taking advantage of data model and interoperability within cytoscape , users can perform noa analysis on any network opened in cytoscape or any subnetwork , selected manually , by built - in filtering mechanisms , or even by another plugin .
the noa plugin also has multiple options for reference networks based on the selected algorithm and test network .
2.2 batch mode batch mode is another unique feature of the noa plugin , allowing for the simultaneous analysis of multiple networks .
batch mode recognizes network and gene set file formats and selects an appropriate algorithm ( edge - based or node - based ) accordingly .
in the case of edge - based analysis , each network is analyzed with respect to the combination of all input networks or their derived clique ( connecting all nodes ) .
node - based analysis uses either the combination of all input genes or a given genome as reference .
in batch mode , the primary output is a ranked list of go terms significantly overrepresented for each network based on the selected algorithm .
the result list is displayed as an annotated table , including go term type , p value , description and associated nodes / edges .
an additional table displays the list of go terms enriched in multiple networks in the batch .
the plugin also generates a sorted heatmap showing the most significantly enriched go terms against all input networks .
these tables and heatmap can be exported to third - party tools for custom visualization and analysis .
2.3 single mode in single mode , the noa plugin can analyze any network in cytoscape .
for edge - based analysis , the clique form of the selected network is used as reference by default .
if the user selects a subnetwork for analysis , then they also have the option of using the original parent network as reference .
in the case of node - based analysis , the corresponding genome is used as reference , or the complete gene set from a given network if only a subset is selected for analysis .
the results include a ranked and annotated list of go terms , similar to batch mode. and , unique to single mode , an overview network is generated with significant go terms represented as nodes .
the size of these nodes is based on the number of occurrences of a given go term annotation on the edges ( or nodes ) of the analyzed network .
the co - occurrence of any two go terms is represented by edges in the overview network .
3 discussion the following use cases demonstrate the analysis options available in the noa plugin and the types of the results users should expect .
3.1 human pathways we prepared a file containing all the human pathways curated at wikipathways ( kelder et al. , 2012 ) and translated ensembl identifiers for batch mode analysis by the noa plugin ( supplementary file s1 ) .
we ran edge - based analysis to make use of the interaction content in the pathways , rather than just treating them like disconnected gene sets .
each pathway was analyzed against the entire collection as reference and no correction was applied .
as expected , curated pathways of known function were significantly annotated with relevant go terms ( fig. 1 and supplementary fig. s2 ) .
users could add novel pathways or interaction networks to this batch analysis to assess functional annotation of edges in the context of known biology. fig. 1. a heatmap of go - annotated human pathways based on batch mode noa plugin analysis .
the gradient presents the corresponding logarithmic p value from - 10 to 0 .
axes are labeled in s2 and inset , highlighting apoptosis - related pathways and go terms 3.2 human diseases we collected protein interaction networks for different types of genetic diseases constructed using a generic protein - protein interactome as the source of disease gene interactions ( wang et al. , 2009 ) ( supplementary file s3 ) .
we compared edge - based and node - based analyses using the noa plugin in batch mode .
the ranked and annotated lists of enriched go terms in supplementary tables s4 and s5 show many disease - term pairings in common , not surprisingly , but also a few differences .
significantly , the inclusion of generic ( not disease - specific ) interactions did not lead to less specific or aberrant go terms with the edge - based method .
thus , with the noa plugin , users can easily run both edge - and node - based analyses on gene sets of interest , using interactome data to supply interactions .
3.3 yeast cell cycle we collected time - series microarray data on yeast cell cycle and constructed regulatory transcription networks for each time point using transcription factor - target pairs revealed by chip - chip experiments ( supplementary file s6 ) .
once again , we compared both types of analysis and two types of reference networks in batch analysis using the noa plugin ( supplementary fig. s7 ) .
edge - based analysis provided more specific go terms than node - based and reflected the known biological processes .
we also noted that the all - network reference produced better results ( i.e. more dynamic range and in line with known biology ) than the clique - based reference .
when working with densely connected networks , like in this example , users will typically produce better results using the all - network option as reference .

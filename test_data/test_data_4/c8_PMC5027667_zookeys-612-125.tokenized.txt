it differs from coleoxestia cinnamomea as follows : integument dark brown , almost black ; elytral punctures finer ; antennae in male surpassing elytral apex by antennomere xi. in coleoxestia cinnamomea the integument is from orangish to reddish - brown , the elytral punctures are fine , but distinctly coarser than in the new species , and the antennae in male surpass elytral apex by antennomeres x and xi. it can be separated from coleoxestia exotica by the elytra shiny ( opaque in coleoxestia exotica ) and by the basal antennomeres distinctly wider ( narrower in coleoxestia exotica ) .
it differs from coleoxestia ebenina mainly by the elytra shiny ( more opaque in coleoxestia ebenina ) and distinctly punctate ( without distinct punctures in coleoxestia ebenina ) .
coleoxestia apeara sp. n. can be included in the alternative of couplet " 19 " from martins and monne ( 2005 ) ( translated ; modified ) : 19 ( 18 ) elytra shiny , not shagreened 18 ' - elytra more opaque , shagreened 20 18 '( 19 ) antennomere iii filiform ; pronotum distinctly transversely rugose .

coleoxestia moromokoi sp. n. differs from all these species by the pronotum not transversely rugose , while in these other species it is distinctly rugose .
coleoxestia moromokoi sp. n. can be included in the alternative couplets " 14 " from martins and monne ( 2005 ) ( translated ) : 14 '( 13 ) pronotum not transversely rugose .

abstract several members of the smad family of transcription factors have been reported to bind rna in addition to their canonical double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) ligand .
rna binding by smad has the potential to affect numerous cellular functions that involve rna .
however , the affinity and specificity of this rna binding activity has not been well characterized , which limits the ability to validate and extrapolate functional implications of this activity .
here we perform quantitative binding experiments in vitro to determine the ligand requirements for rna binding by smad3 .
we find that smad3 binds poorly to single - and double - stranded rna , regardless of sequence .
however , smad3 binds rna with large internal loops or bulges with high apparent affinity .
this apparent affinity matches that for its canonical dsdna ligand , suggesting a biological role for rna binding by smad3 .
introduction smad family transcription factors are central mediators of the tgfbeta superfamily signaling pathway ( 1,2 ) .
the first smad protein was identified in humans by its frequent mutation in pancreatic cancer , and malfunction of this pathway has since been linked to a variety diseases ( 3,4 ) .
signaling by tgfbeta ligands triggers the phosphorylation , trimerization , and transport of smad proteins to the nucleus ( 5 ) .
in the nucleus , smad proteins bind to double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) and activate or repress transcription predominantly through the recruitment of histone modification machinery ( 6,7 ) .
like most transcription factors , smad proteins recognize a specific dsdna sequence known as the smad binding element ( sbe ) , which comprises the sequence gtctg or gtct ( 8 ) .
in addition to their canonical role in transcriptional regulation , several smad proteins have also been implicated in the processing of primary microrna ( pri - mirna ) transcripts via the recruitment of the microprocessor complex ( 9 ) .
additional findings suggested a mechanism of action involving the direct interaction of smad proteins and pri - mirna hairpins ( 10 ) .
furthermore , these interactions were reported to be specific for pri - mirna hairpins containing the rna version of the sbe sequence .
the parallels between smad rna and dna binding are intriguing , but the sequence and structural requirements for rna binding are poorly defined .
the crystal structure of smad3 bound to dsdna revealed a mechanism of sequence recognition typical of transcription factors in which the protein reads a specific pattern of hydrogen bonds in the major groove of the b - form helix ( 11 ) .
the protein makes base - specific contacts via an extended beta - hairpin motif , and adjacent dna - binding domains make no protein - protein contacts , binding without cooperativity .
a - form rna helices are characterized by a narrower and deeper major groove that precludes this mode of recognition .
thus , it is unclear how smad might recognize the sbe in the context of a dsrna hairpin .
one possibility is that helical perturbations in the pri - mirna stem expand the major groove for protein recognition , as seen for other protein / rna complexes ( 12 - 15 ) .
however , the catalogue of sequence - specific dsrna - binding proteins is limited , and usually involves larger helical perturbations than those seen in pri - mirnas .
a better understanding of the sequence and structural features required for rna binding by smad would improve our understanding of mirna biology , protein - rna recognition , and the potential for smad to interact with other rna ligands in the cell .
here , we describe the thermodynamic characterization of smad binding to rna ligands .
all work was performed using the smad3 protein , which is one of four smad proteins previously reported to bind rna ( 9 ) .
contrary to previous models , we find no evidence that smad3 specifically recognizes the sbe sequence in rna .
in fact , all rna constructs designed to mimic pri - mirnas are bound with relatively low affinity , while more complex rna structures are bound with high apparent affinity .
rnas with large internal loops or junctions bind with apparent affinities that are the same as for dsdna .
multiple rna targets effectively compete with smad dna binding , suggesting that smad may play an important role in rna metabolism .
materials and methods smad3 cloning , expression and purification smad3 was expressed and purified as an n - terminally tagged 6xhis - sumo fusion protein prior to cleavage of the tag for biochemical characterization .
a synthetic gene for full - length human smad3 was codon optimized for expression in escherichia coli ( integrated dna technologies ) .
smad3 mh1 ( amino acids 1 - 132 ) and full - length smad3 ( 1 - 425 ) were pcr amplified and cloned into the pet sumo vector according to manufacturer 's recommendations ( thermo fisher scientific ) .
the his - sumo - smad3 fusion protein was expressed in bl21 ( de3 ) e. coli .
cells were transformed with the pet his - sumo - smad3 plasmid and grown at 37degreesc in luria broth supplemented with 50 mug / ml kanamycin to an od600 of 0.5 - 0.6 .
cells were then cold shocked on ice for 30 minutes with occasional shaking .
protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl beta - d thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) and cells were incubated with shaking for 20 hours at 18degreesc .
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rcf for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 , 300 mm sodium chloride , 10 mm imidazole ph 8.0 , 3 mm betame , 1 edta - free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet ( roche ) , and 5 u / ml benzonase ( emd millipore )) .
cells were lysed by passing through a microfluidizer three times at 15 000 psi and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 15 000 rcf for 30 min .
soluble material was mixed with ni - nta agarose ( qiagen ) preequilibrated in lysis buffer .
the slurry was incubated for 1 h with gentle rocking at 4degreesc and poured into a flex column for purification by gravity flow .
the column was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with wash buffer ( 20 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 , 300 mm sodium chloride , 25 mm imidazole ph 8.0 and 3 mm betame ) before eluting with elution buffer ( 20 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 , 300 mm sodium chloride , 100 mm imidazole ph 8.0 , 3 mm betame ) .
6xhis - ulp1 protease was added to the eluent and dialyzed overnight at 4degreesc in 6 - 8 kda mwco tubing ( spectrum labs ) in dialysis buffer ( 50 mm tris ph 8.0 , 150 mm nacl and 10 mm dtt ) .
following cleavage of the his - sumo tag another ni - nta column was used to separate the cleaved his - sumo tag and his - ulp1 from smad3 .
the overnight dialysis product was poured over a preequilibrated ni - nta column , but smad3 was not present in the flow through .
smad3 was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 , 300 mm sodium chloride , 20 mm imidazole ph 8.0 and 3 mm betame .
eluent was concentrated and purified further by gel filtration using a hiload 16 / 600 superdex 200 column ( ge healthcare ) equilibrated in 25 mm tris - hcl ph 8.0 , 115 mm potassium chloride , and 10 mm dtt .
fractions corresponding to highly pure , monomeric smad3 mh1 or full - length smad3 were pooled , concentrated to ~ 100 - 250 mum , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc .
oligonucleotide preparation and purification dna oligonucleotides were purchased with standard desalting purification ( thermo fisher scientific ) .
short rna oligonucleotides under 20 - nt and construct 12 were synthesized on a mermade synthesizer ( bioaotomation ) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry and deprotected as previously described ( 16 ) .
long rna oligonucleotides were transcribed in vitro from synthetic ssdna templates ( thermo fisher scientific ) .
equimolar amounts of ssdna template and a universal t7 promoter sequence were annealed .
one microgram annealed template was then used in a 100 mul transcription reaction containing 5 mm each rntp , 22 mm magnesium chloride , 40 mm tris - hcl ph 8.0 , 2 mm spermidine , 10 mm dtt , 0.01 % triton x - 100 , 40 units rnase inhibitor ( new england biolabs ) and 5 mul t7 rna polymerase .
transcription reactions were incubated at 37degreesc for 2 h. all rna was gel purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis .
appropriate bands were excised and rna was extracted by crush soak in 10 mm mops ph 6.0 , 300 mm sodium chloride , and 1 mm disodium - edta .
after extraction , rna was ethanol precipitated , washed once with 70 % ethanol and resuspended in water .
oligonucleotide labeling and folding oligonucleotides were 5 ' end labeled for emsa experiments .
transcribed rnas were prepared for end - labeling by dephosphorylation with antarctic phosphatase ( new england biolabs ) according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
following dephosphorylation , enzyme was inactivated by heating to 70degreesc for 5 min .
oligonucleotides were 5 ' end labeled using [ upsilon - 32p ] adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) and t4 polynucleotide kinase ( new england biolabs ) according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
free atp was removed using g25 spin columns ( ge healthcare ) and oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis .
following purification and ethanol precipitation , rna was resuspended in 25 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and 115 mm potassium chloride and stored at - 80degreesc .
double - stranded oligonucleotides were created by 5 ' end labeling one strand and annealing it with 1.2 molar equivalents of the unlabeled complementary strand .
annealing reactions were performed with at least 170 nm each oligonucleotide in annealing buffer ( 10 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 50 mm sodium chloride , 1 mm disodium - edta ) .
strands were annealed by heating to 95degreesc for 5 min and cooled by placing at room temperature .
rna was folded at low concentrations immediately prior to binding experiments to ensure the absence of dimers or other misfolded conformers .
rna was diluted to less than 10 nm in 25 mm tris - hcl , 115 mm potassium chloride and 1 mm dtt .
the rna was then placed in a 95degreesc heating block and allowed to slow cool to room temperature over the course of 60 min .
electrophoretic mobility shift assays for binding reactions , smad3 was serially diluted and mixed with trace labeled oligonucleotide at a concentration less than 5 nm. binding buffer contained 25 mm tris - hcl , 115 mm potassium chloride , 1 mm magnesium chloride , 1 mm dtt , 20 ng / mul low molecular weight poly i : c ( invivogen ) , 0.1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin and 10 % glycerol .
reactions were incubated on ice for two hours ( longer incubation had no affect on results ) and loaded onto a 0.75 mm thick native gel made from 6 % to 10 % acrylamide and 0.5x tbe ( 44.5 mm tris - hcl , 44.5 mm boric acid , 1 mm disodium edta ) .
gels were run in 0.5x tbe at 100 - 120 v for 1 h at 4degreesc .
gels were dried on whatman paper , exposed to a phosphorimager screen overnight and scanned on a typhoon fla 9500 biomolecular imager ( ge healtchare ) .
data were quantified manually in imagequant ( ge healthcare ) and corrected for background .
fraction bound was calculated as the total counts from all shifted species divided by the total counts from all bands in a lane .
thus , kdapp reflects the apparent macromolecular dissociation constant of the highest affinity interaction between smad3 and the oligonucleotide .
most binding experiments were performed at least in triplicate on different days with smad3 concentrations that extended at least 10 - fold above and below the kdapp .
oligonucleotides that bound weakly , such as 12 and 16 , were measured in duplicate and the initial pri - mirna binding ( figure 1 ) was performed as a single screening experiment .
data were fit globally to equation ( 1 ) using graphpad prism to calculate kdapp and hill coefficient .

smad3 does not specifically bind to sbe - containing pri - mirnas .
( a ) pri - mirnas in blue font were selected based on their reported ability to bind smad via an sbe motif ( 10 ) .
pri - mirnas in red font lack an sbe and are included as negative controls .
( b ) constructs derived from the pri - mirnas in panel a were designed to test the effect of the sbe on smad binding .
closing basepairs and uucg tetraloops ( cyan ) were added to the predicted pri - mirna secondary structures to stabilize the rna secondary structure in vitro .
the local architecture surrounding the sbe ( green ) was unaltered in the stabilized designs .
negative controls ( e.g. 1b ) were created by mutating the sbe sequence .
to confirm that our design features did not impact binding , we also tested longer pri - mirna hairpins without artificial basepairs ( right panel ) .
again , constructs were tested with ( 3c ) and without ( 9c ) an sbe .
( c ) binding affinities for each pri - mirna construct were estimated by incubating smad3 mh1 dilutions with each rna and separating free and bound rna by emsa .
representative emsas are shown , illustrating that the presence of the sbe does not affect smad3 binding .
( d ) summary of the approximate dissociation constants measured for all pri - mirna constructs tested .
constructs with putative sbes are represented by blue circles and those without sbes are represented by red squares .
the concentration of smad3 in the binding experiments was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm using a theoretical extinction coefficient ( 26 470 m - 1 cm - 1 for smad3 mh1 and 68 870 m - 1 cm - 1 for fl smad 3 ) ( 17 ) .
protein specific activity was calculated as ~ 70 % using an activity titration experiment .
this experiment was performed in the same fashion as the binding experiment , but with 2.5 mum dsdna containing an sbe .
the specific activity of smad3 was consistent between preps and therefore no correction factor was applied .
competition assay the competition experiment was performed in a similar fashion to the emsa binding experiments .
1 nm labeled dsdna containing an sbe was mixed with 350 nm smad3 mh1 in binding buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. serial dilutions of unlabeled competitor rna were made and mixed with the preincubated smad / dsdna complex .
competition reactions were incubated on ice for 4 h to reach equilibrium before performing gel electrophoresis , as described for emsa binding experiments .
at least ten data points were used per experiment and experiments were performed in triplicate with separate dilutions on different days .
competitor concentrations extended at least 10 - fold above and below the kdapp .
individual replicates were fit to equation ( 2 ) using graphpad prism and ic50 values were averaged between replicates .
error bars represent the standard error of the mean of replicate ic50 values .

results smad3 binds rna without detectable sequence specificity we designed several rna constructs to test the model that smad3 specifically recognizes the sbe sequence in a pri - mirna hairpin .
eight pri - mirnas ( 1 - 8 ) were selected as design templates based on their reported interaction with smad and the presence of a canonical sbe ( figure 1a ) ( 10 ) .
the designed rna constructs ( 1a - 8a ) contained the core sbe and five flanking base - pairs from the predicted pri - mirna secondary structure , so as to maintain local structural elements that might promote binding ( figure 1b left panel and supplementary table s1 ) .
five gc - rich closing basepairs and a uucg tetraloop were added to ensure proper folding in vitro .
for negative controls , we applied similar design principles to a pri - mirna lacking the sbe ( 9a ) and we mutated the sbe sequences of two designed rnas ( 1b and 6b ) ( figure 1b left panel and supplementary table s1 ) .
we assessed the sequence specificity of smad3 by measuring the approximate dissociation constant for the designed rnas using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) .
the dna - binding domain ( mh1 ) of smad3 was used in our binding assays because of its reported ability to confer specificity for the sbe in rna ( 10 ) .
we verified the activity of the protein and the experimental conditions by recapitulating the well - established affinity for dsdna containing an sbe ( 19 ) ( figure 2 and table 1 ) .
additionally , we confirmed our findings using full - length smad3 , supporting the conclusion that the mh1 domain confers the complete nucleic acid binding activity of smad3 ( supplementary figure s1 ) .

duplex energies were calculated using the nearest neighbor method at 1 m nacl , 37degreesc and ph 7 ( 51 ) .
ba large internal loop is defined as a region of a stem with unpaired bases on both strands , one of which contains more than one base .
ctwo of these loops are in the region flanking the central stem loop and are prone to rearrangement in structures predicted by rna folding algorithms .
the rna binding experiments revealed weak binding to rnas with and without the sbe ( figure 1c and d ) .
to confirm that our design features did not interfere with binding , we created several other constructs without artificial closing base - pairs and uucg tetraloops ( 3b and 4b ) as well as a complete pri - mirna stem loop sequence ( 3c ) ( figure 1b right panel and supplementary table s1 ) .
we included controls that lack the sbe ( 9b and 9c ) , and again , we saw no difference in affinity between rnas with and without the sbe ( figure 1d ) .
replicate experiments performed on a subset of these rnas confirmed these results ( supplementary figure s2a and table 1 ) .
thus , smad3 binds weakly to pri - mirna stem loops , regardless of sequence .
smad3 does not preferentially bind pri - mirnas our binding experiments revealed no sequence specificity for smad3 binding , but we did see slightly higher affinity for longer rnas that approached a 1 mum apparent dissociation constant ( kdapp ) ( figure 1d ) .
indeed , quantitative replicates of several constructs confirm these trends ( table 1 and supplementary figure s2a ) .
we further tested the length - dependent binding activity of smad3 using a 160 - nt construct ( 10 ) , based on hsa - pri - mir - 21 , which contains the stem loop as well as the predominantly single - stranded flanking regions ( supplementary figure s2b ) .
we additionally tested a length - matched control rna ( 11 ) from adenovirus ( vai ) that is largely base - paired , but contains additional structural features that distinguish it from the rna constructs tested to this point ( supplementary figure s2c ) .
as expected , the extended construct based on pri - mirna - 21 ( 10 ) binds with slightly higher affinity than the shorter constructs , demonstrating a length - dependent rna binding activity ( supplementary figure s2a ) .
surprisingly , the length - matched control rna ( 11 ) binds 6 - fold more tightly than 10 .
thus , smad3 can discriminate between length - matched rnas and does not preferentially bind to pri - mirnas .
smad3 binds complex rna structures with high affinity the ability of smad3 to discriminate nearly 10 - fold between length - matched rnas while displaying no sequence specificity suggests that rna structure plays a role in smad3 binding .
to further test the role of rna structure in smad3 binding , we measured its affinity for a diverse set of rna molecules .
these rnas included a single - stranded rna that contains 55 uracils ( 12 ) , a set of double - stranded rna and rna / dna hybrid duplexes ( 13 and 14 ) , and a 30 - basepair stem loop ( 16 ) ( figure 2a and supplementary figure s3 ) .
we additionally tested more complex rna structures that were selected from well - characterized group ii intron domains ( 18,19 ) .
the first of these complex rna structures ( 17 ) derives from domain four of a group iic intron and comprises a stem loop with large internal loops ( figure 2a ) .
the second rna ( 18 ) derives from domain three of a group iib intron and comprises a four - way junction with a bulged stem ( figure 2a ) .
smad3 binds very poorly to the purely single - stranded and double - stranded rnas , including those that contain an sbe ( 12 - 15 ) ( figure 2 and supplementary figure s3 ) .
consistent with this finding , the perfectly base - paired stem loop ( 16 ) also binds with low affinity ( figure 2 ) .
the minor perturbations to base - pairing present in the pri - mirna stem loops ( 1 - 9 ) increase affinity slightly , but the kdapp remains in the micromolar range and no clear shifted species is formed in the emsa , suggesting the lack of a discrete , stable protein / rna complex ( figure 2 and table 1 ) .
while smad3 binds poorly to single - and double - stranded rna , both rna molecules with more complex structures ( 17 and 18 ) bind to smad3 with significantly higher affinity and they form discrete shifted species that are visible by emsa ( figure 2 ) .
the effect of rna structure on smad3 binding is exemplified by the comparison of 17 and 16 : the complex rna structure ( 17 ) binds with a 190 nm kdapp while the perfectly base - paired stem loop ( 16 ) binds 20 - fold weaker , despite being only nine nucleotides shorter ( figure 2b and table 1 ) .
similarly , 17 binds nearly 10 - fold tighter than a pri - mirna ( 9c ) only two nucleotides different in length ( figure 2b and table 1 ) .
thus , smad3 preferentially binds the complex structures present in 17 and 18 .
comparison of smad3 rna and dsdna binding activities the apparent affinity between smad3 and these complex rna structures is comparable to its canonical dsdna binding affinity .
we measured a kdapp of 190 nm between smad3 and a dsdna ligand containing a single sbe ( 19 ) , in agreement with previously reported values ( figure 2 ) ( 11 ) .
interestingly , this canonical dsdna binding affinity is no tighter than that observed for two of the rna structures ( 17 and 18 ) .
to determine if these binding activities are mutually exclusive , we performed competition assays in which unlabeled rna or dna was added to a pre - bound smad3 / dsdna complex ( figure 3 ) .
indeed , rna or dna that binds with high affinity ( 17 - 19 ) efficiently competes with canonical dsdna binding at nanomolar concentrations consistent with the kdapp , while low - affinity rnas ( 16 ) compete much less effectively .
thus , high - affinity rna binding to smad3 competes with canonical dsdna binding , suggesting that rna and dna bind to the same site on smad3 .
figure 3 .
high affinity rna binding competes with dsdna binding .
( a ) representative emsa competition experiment in which labeled dsdna ( 19 ) was preincubated with smad3 and unlabeled rna or dna was titrated in .
( b ) ic50s were calculated for several rna and dna oligonucleotides , demonstrating that high - affinity rnas compete with dna binding more efficiently than low - affinity rnas .
it is important to note that there are differences between the dsdna and rna binding activities of smad3 .
dsdna containing a single sbe ( 19 ) forms a single shifted species with smad3 ( figure 2a , bottom right ) .
thus , smad3 cannot efficiently bind to flanking dsdna lacking the sbe and the kdapp reflects the microscopic dissociation constant of a single binding event .
the complex rna structures formed by 17 and 18 , however , are capable of binding multiple smad3 molecules , as suggested by the multiple shifted species visible by emsas ( figure 2a ) .
smad3 recognizes large internal loops we performed a mutagenesis study on 17 to determine the minimal rna structural element recognized by smad3 .
first , we performed a truncation experiment in which 17 was progressively shortened and the effect on binding was measured by emsa ( 17a - c ) ( figure 4a ) .
this truncation experiment revealed significant decreases in affinity upon deletion of each internal loop , implicating the internal loops as the sites of smad3 binding .
to further test this hypothesis , we created full - length versions of 17 in which each internal loop was isolated and the remaining stem was replaced with complementary base - pairs that we previously demonstrated to have low affinity for smad3 ( 17d and 17e ) .
each of these constructs binds with sub - micromolar apparent affinity , but do not reach the affinity of 17 .
additionally , there are fewer shifted species than with 17 , consistent with a decrease in the number of smad3 binding sites ( figure 4b ) .
together , these findings suggest that smad3 binds large internal loops or junctions with moderate affinity and that the presence of multiple binding sites within a single rna ligand can result in a tight kdapp .

truncation analysis of 17 ( left panel ) reveals decreases in affinity upon disruption of each large asymetric internal loop .
either internal loop of 17 is sufficient to confer nanomolar binding in isolation , but not the full affinity conferred by the complete construct 17 ( middle panel ) .
the wide - major grooves created by the large internal loops of the nf - kappab aptamer ( 20 ) and rre ( 21 ) are insufficient to confer high - affinity smad3 binding ( right panel ) .
( b ) representative emsas of smad3 binding to constructs containing the isolated internal loops of 17 .
smad3 recognizes large internal loops via a mechanism more complex than b - form mimicry the specificity of smad3 for large internal loops and junctions raises the possibility that these rnas mimic the canonical dsdna ligand recognized by smad3 .
large internal loops within rna stems might be capable of forming distorted helices with expanded major grooves that mimic b - form dsdna ( 12,20 ) .
we tested this theory using the nf - kappab aptamer ( 20 ) and the rev - response element from hiv ( 21 ) , both of which contain internal loops that result in helices with expanded major grooves , and which mimic the recognition potential of b - form dsdna .
however , both of these rnas bind weakly to smad3 , with affinities that are even lower than 17c , which is similar length ( figure 4a ) .
these results suggest that smad3 recognizes large internal loops and junctions via a mechanism more complex than b - form mimicry .
discussion here , we describe a novel , high - affinity rna binding activity for the transcription factor smad3 .
smad3 binds rnas with large internal loops or junctions with mid - nanomolar apparent affinity .
this affinity for rna matches that observed for a specific dsdna ligand .
therefore , rna binding has the potential to significantly impact smad3 function as well as that of homologous smad proteins .
the majority of the human genome is transcribed into rna , providing a wealth of potential smad binding partners ( 21 ) .
relatively few of these rnas have been structurally characterized , but those that have suggest the presence of many potential smad binding sites .
for example , the lncrna hotair contains 34 internal loops and 19 junctions , the majority of which would be expected to have high affinity for smad3 ( 22 ) .
these structures are similarly abundant in other structurally characterized rnas , suggesting that the transcriptome is filled with potential smad3 partners ( 23 - 25 ) .
however , the stem loops of pri - and pre - mirnas do not contain such structural motifs , instead forming a - form helices , like that in the crystal structure of a pre - mirna bound to exportin - 5 ( 26 ) .
other proteins that interact with pri - and pre - mirnas , such as drosha , dgcr8 , dicer and trbp , contain dsrna - binding domains ( dsrbds ) that canonically bind a - form rna ( 27 ) .
this suggests a structural requirement for pri - mirna stem loops to adopt a - form geometry , which is incompatible with smad binding .
thus , smad3 can bind a wide variety of cellular rnas , but does not bind single - or double - stranded rnas , such as the stem loops of mirna precursors .
the current understanding of when and where smad3 exists in the cell suggests multiple ways in which rna could interact with smad3 to regulate tgfbeta signaling .
prior to signaling , smad3 is localized to the tgfbeta receptor at the plasma membrane via direct interaction with the scaffolding protein sara ( 28 ) .
tgfbeta signaling triggers smad3 phosphorylation by the tgfbeta receptor , promoting smad3 trimerization and translocation to the nucleus ( 5 ) .
smad3 interaction with sara and trimerization are mediated by the mh2 domain , leaving the mh1 domain free to interact with rna ( 29,30 ) .
we do not know if smad proteins interact with rna in the cytoplasm , but such an interaction could serve to transport rna into the nucleus .
the exposed mh1 domain would allow continual interaction with an rna binding partner , and protein quaternary structure , coupled with rna tertiary structure , could improve the specificity of smad for certain rnas .
such an rnp would be much smaller than some complexes that utilize the nuclear pore for transport , such as ribosomal subunits , and therefore able to transit the nuclear membrane ( 31 ) .
however , it remains to be seen if importin binding is compatible with rna binding , and if smad does indeed interact with specific rnas in the cytoplasm .
in the nucleus , smad localizes to the chromatin where a large number of nascent and mature rnas are concentrated ( 32 ) .
these rnas may influence the genomic localization of smad , or vice versa , and consequently they may impact the genes that are regulated by tgfbeta signaling .
previous experimental results have been interpreted under the assumption that smad is a dna binding protein .
however , our results suggest that rna binding must also be considered .
for example , chip experiments show smad enrichment at enhancer regions , despite the fact that the sbe is not the most enriched sequence motif ( 33,34 ) .
this result could be explained by an interaction between smad and chromatin - associated enhancer rnas .
rna binding may also help explain the pleiotropic nature of smad biology .
tgfbeta signaling has dramatically different effects on different cell types and non - coding rna is expressed with higher tissue specificity than mrna ( 35,36 ) .
thus , cell - specific ncrnas might differentially regulate smad , resulting in different gene expression outcomes for different cell types .
the relatively high affinity and low specificity of smad3 for rna suggests the need for regulation of this binding activity .
many of the most abundant cellular rnas , such as rrna , trna , 7sk , 7sl , snorna , snrnas , and some mrnas are present at intracellular concentrations near or above the apparent dissociation constant for smad3 ( 37 - 39 ) .
therefore , smad3 would be predominantly bound to abundant rnas if it were not for mitigating factors .
a higher affinity rna ligand may exist in the cell and would prevent nonspecific interactions with abundant structured rnas .
protein complexes or compartmentalization may also help obscure potential smad binding sites on abundant rnas .
however , pathologies or experiments that lead to an increase in rna concentration without a concomitant increase in protein partners would lead to the exposure of many potential smad binding sites .
thus , rna overexpression could lead to aberrant interactions with smad .
our results have additional implications regarding the requirements for smad dna binding .
we have shown that multiple rna binding sites achieve the same effective dissociation constant and compete with specific dna binding .
when localized to the chromatin , smad will encounter a large number of rna binding sites ( 32 ) .
therefore , stable dna binding requires a significantly higher affinity for dna than previously appreciated .
interactions between smad and other dna - binding transcription factors may cooperatively increase the affinity of the complex , and larger enhanceosome complexes may be required to specifically target smad to the proper genomic location ( 40,41 ) .
rna and dna may also work synergistically to localize smad to a specific genomic location .
while rna and dna binding are competitive for a single smad monomer , the formation of a smad trimer , or a larger protein complex , would allow concurrent binding of dna and rna .
the formation of such a complex would improve specificity and affinity , potentially helping localize smad to a specific location of the chromatin .
the extrapolation of our findings to other transcription factors is still uncertain , but our results agree with the few transcription factors that have been well characterized .
several transcription factors have been suggested to bind rna , but very few have been quantitatively characterized ( 42 ) .
our results demonstrate the need to confirm these interactions in vitro as indirect effects complicate cell - based experiments .
the handful of transcription factors that have been characterized agree well with our observations on smad3 .
tfiiia , nf - kappab , runx1 , gr , and now smad3 each bind rna with a mid - to low - nanomolar apparent kd within an order of magnitude of their kd for dna ( 43 - 47 ) .
tfiiia uses different domains to bind rna and dna , but the other transcription factors are capable of binding both rna and dna via overlapping interfaces ( 15,20,48,49 ) .
interestingly , each of the rna binding partners also contains at least one large internal loop or junction .
further experiments are needed to understand the themes in transcription factor / rna interaction , but our results suggest a potentially important biological role for rna binding by smad , and perhaps other transcription factors .
the rna binding ability of smad must be considered in the design and interpretation of future experiments .
we have demonstrated a high - affinity interaction with rna that is not sequence specific , as previously described , but instead has moderate specificity for internal loops or junctions .
the magnitude of this interaction suggests a novel role for rna in tgfbeta signaling .

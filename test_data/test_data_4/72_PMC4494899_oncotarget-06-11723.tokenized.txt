p53 , the " cellular gatekeeper " and the " guardian of the cellular genome " , is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor in human cancer .
in response to diverse stresses ( that is , dna damage , nutrient deprivation , oncogenic activation , hypoxia , oxidative stress , hyperproliferative signals and other forms of stress ) , p53 can be activated and subsequently functions as a transcription factor to orchestrate various biological outputs such as transient cell cycle arrest , apoptosis , cellular senescence , differentiation , metabolism , as well as regulation of autophagy [ 1 ] .
autophagy is a dynamic catabolic process by which cytoplasmic components are targeted to a double - membrane vesicle called autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to the lysosome for terminal degradation and recycling [ 2 ] .
when the cells are subjected to stressful stimuli such as starvation , autophagy is rapidly upregulated to restore their metabolic homeostasis and sustain energy requirements , thus facilitating their survival under stressful conditions .
however , excessive or persistent autophagy is also shown to promote cell death .
a series of stress signals can induce autophagy , including p53 , nutrient deprivation , hypoxia , endoplasmic reticulum stress and so on. the direct evidence from scherz - shouval et al. suggests that p53 - dependent regulation of autophagy supports cell survival in the face of chronic starvation [ 3 ] .
the central checkpoints that regulate autophagy are ampresponsive protein kinase ( ampk ) and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) [ 2 ] .
cellular senescence is a stress response that accompanies with the irreversible arrest and senescent morphology .
senescence may be initiated by various insults and has an important role in limiting cell proliferation , however , the mechanisms controlling cellular senescence are still debated [ 4 ] .
increasing evidence indicate that p53 and ampk / mtor pathway are critical mediators of the senescence response [ 5 , 6 ] .
thus , p53 can induce cell cycle arrest and then active mtor converts this arrest into senescence ( geroconversion ) .
seemingly paradoxically , p53 can also function as a suppressor of cellular senescence by blocking the mtor pathway [ 6 ] .
both p53 and mtor are also involved in regulation of autophagy .
mtor inhibits autophagy .
however , it remains to be determined whether p53 - induced autophagy is associated with suppression of senescence ( gerosuppression ) .
we have recently shown that p53 facilitated cell survival by inducing autophagy under the deprivation of serum [ 7 ] .
under serum starvation , an increased autophagic flux was observed in the hct116 p53 +/+ cells but not in the hct116 p53 - / - cells , suggesting that p53 promoted autophagy under serum - starved conditions .
we showed p53 - dependent autophagy protected cancer cells from starvation - induced death and inhibition of autophagy by the treatment with 3 - ma resulted in a large number of cell death .
thus , p53 - induced autophagy functions as a survival signal in response to serum starvation .
to determine the impact of p53 - induced autophagy on cellular senescence , we assessed cell cycle and staining with beta - gal .
we found that p53 induces cell cycle arrest and cell quiescence ( not senescence ) in response to serum starvation .
however , beta - gal activity was significantly enhanced in the serum - starved hct116 p53 - / - cells , as compared with the serum - starved hct116 p53 +/+ cells .
these results indicate that p53 may act as a suppressor of cellular senescence in response to serum starvation since beta - gal is a well - known marker presented in senescent cells .
next , we investigated whether inhibition of p53 - dependent autophagy may promote cellular senescence .
as mentioned above , increased autophagic flux and lack of the senescent phenotype were found in the serum - starved hct116 p53 +/+ cells .
after the treatment with autophagic inhibitor 3 - ma , the autophagy was attenuated and beta - gal activity was markedly enhanced in the starved hct116 p53 +/+ cells , but hardly changed in the starved p53 - / - cells .
these data indicate that inhibition of p53 - dependent autophagy promotes cellular senescence .
in addition , it was demonstrated that suppression of senescence through p53 - dependent autophagy may occur partly through the inhibition of the mtor pathway .
our results demonstrate that , in the absence of serum , p53 may activate autophagic flux and subsequent autophagy functions as a survival signal to inhibit cellular senescence partly through suppression of the mtor pathway .
this study delineates a potential association between autophagy and senescence and explains why p53 may suppress cellular senescence in response to starvation .
future experiments will further illuminate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of p53 - indeced autophagy on cellular senescence .
a better understanding of the role of p53 in autophagy and cellular senescence will hopefully provide new strategy for cancer therapy .

methods a common social demographic questionnaire and a questionnaire about family history / personal disease and biographic events were applied to 211 subjects ( in 110 , the disease had already begun , 82 were asymptomatic carriers , and 19 had no established diagnosis ) , attending external consultation at corino de andrade unit in centro hospitalar do porto .
a descriptive analysis and frequencies were obtained .
results 84 of all subjects were men and 127 were female .
mean ages : carriers 33.9 +/ - 9.8yr , patients 37.8 +/ - 8.1 , and for subjects that had no established diagnosis 40.9 +/ - 14.0 yr. most subjects were married or lived with a partner ( 67.1 %) ; 61.5 % had children ( mean , 4 children ) .
most subjects ( 96.3 %) had contacted the disease before having their diagnosis , most of them through parents ( 35.7 %) but also through uncles , grandparents , other family members ; the affected parent was the mother in 53.8 % of the cases and the father in 43.3 % of the patients ( the remaining did not know who the affected parent was ; one patient inherited the disease from both parents ) ; 71.8 % were deceased .
most living parents had symptoms ( 74.4 %) .
age at time of the affected parent 's death : most of the subjects were older than 25 yr ( 43 %) ; the remaining were under 10 yr ( 9.9 %) ; between 10 and 14 yr ( 15.5 %) ; and between 15 and 24 yr. age at time of the parent 's disease onset : most of the subjects were under 10 yr ( 30.5 %) ; the remaining were between 10 and 14 yr ( 14.4 %) ; between 15 and 24 yr ( 27.0 %) ; and 17.2 % were older than 25 yr. when asked about whether and how their parent 's disease had brought changes into their lives , 37.2 % of the subjects said yes , namely through residence , psychological and familial questions .
most subjects ( 53.3 %) had been their parent 's caregivers .
about 7.5 % of all patients had been raised through childhood and youth by others , not by their parents .
some subjects ( 8.4 %) refused to acknowledge their own genetic test 's result for more than 1 year .
discussion and conclusions parent 's death and the presence of an early - onset disease is a constant in fap patients' lives and this may be an important distress factor , eventually making them more vulnerable to psychological distress and psychiatric disease .
during childhood , youth , and as young adults , a great number of these patients were obliged to become caregivers and this implied a change of roles in the family .
these results point to a very important psychosocial charge that fap imposes to patients throughout their lives , since childhood and youth .

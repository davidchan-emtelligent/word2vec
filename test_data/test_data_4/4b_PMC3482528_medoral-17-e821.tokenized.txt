objective : this study is aimed at getting to know the existing relationship between the dimensions of the burnout syndrome and job satisfaction , on one hand , and depressive feelings on the other through the creation of a structural model aimed at relating all these concepts on a sample of spanish periodontists .
study design : the initial sample comprised 284 individuals , who represented 20 % of the members of the spanish society of periodontology and research ( www.sepa.es ) .
these individuals were chosen randomly by means of stratified sampling with proportional affixation by their autonomous community of residence .
all participants were sent by post the mbi , cet and job - satisfaction questionnaires .
the software package used for data analysis was lisrel v .
8.7 by checking models of structural equations so as to prove the proposed model 's adjustment .
results : the total number of answered questionnaires was 170 ( 59.85 %) .
a positive relation was observed between emotional tiredness and depersonalization and depression .
however , this dimension correlated negatively with job satisfaction and self - realization .
conclusions : the obtained results show that , in this sample of periodontists , job satisfaction acts as a modulator in the transition from emotional tiredness to depression .
key words : burnout , depression , periodontology .
introduction stress in the working world is associated to increased numbers of working accidents and reduced productivity .
continuous exposure to stress may produce a wide range of harmful consequences for the workers' health , thus provoking physical and mental disorders that lead to conditions such as the burnout syndrome .
its symptoms are characterized by three clearly - differentiated dimensions : emotional tiredness , depersonalization , and reduced self - realization , which lead to remarkably reduced working performance and productivity .
in spite of being different gnoseologic entities , the burnout syndrome , in the long run , may provoke the appearance of the depressive syndrome , if the conditions that lead to its appearance hold throughout time , thus soaking the individual 's all other life aspects with all these harmful symptoms .
most of the consequences of working stress in organizations can be associated to the burnout syndrome .
indeed , reduced job satisfaction is among those with the greatest impact on working objectives and performance .
job satisfaction can be easily defined as people 's more or less defined idea on how they believe that their work - - together with its most important aspects - - should develop .
comparing these ideas with their reality renders an assessment and a resulting attitude : greater or lower satisfaction levels .
emotional tiredness and depersonalization are negatively associated to job satisfaction , while self - realization is positively associated to it. however , studies do not precise whether job satisfaction is an antecedent or a consequence of the burnout syndrome .
all these conditions have been studied in different health populations ( 1,2 ) though references on dentists are rather scarce ( 3,4 ) .
the only research focused on the burnout syndrome in periodontists in spain was recently carried out by our own research group ( 5 ) .
one of the objectives of this study was the completion of a structural model to interrelate the three dimensions of the burnout syndrome ( that is , emotional tiredness , depersonalization , and self - realization to depression and low job satisfaction levels among periodontists ) .
material and methods - sample to achieve the main aim of this research , the members of the spanish society of periodontology and research ( sepa ) were taken as the sample population .
the number of members of sepa , as of november 2nd , 2004 , was 1419 .
since we are dealing with a reduced population , the sample was decided to reach 20 % of that population to reduce estimation errors - - thus , an initial sample of 284 individuals was registered .
these individuals were chosen by stratified random sampling with proportional affixation by autonomous community ( fig. 1 ) .
figure 1 distribution of sepa members by percentages and autonomous communities .
- instruments we used a series of questionnaires , which were posted to the participating sepa members .
they were sent a document containing an introduction page that explained the nature and objectives of the study and asked them for collaboration , a questionnaire of sociodemographic and working variables , and the maslach & jackson burnout inventory ( mbi ( 6 ) , 1986 ) , and the brief four - dimensional structural questionnaire for depression ( brief cet - de ) .
the impact of stress on job satisfaction was assessed by means of a specific questionnaire contributed by melia ( 7 ) .
- procedure all participants were posted an envelope by the university of seville that contained an introduction letter by the research group , the questionnaire , and the instructions to fill it in. it also contained a stamped envelope to return the questionnaires .
the participants were asked to post these documents to a collaborating notary , who collected all documents and remained anonymous so as to guarantee confidentiality in the returned questionnaires , which is an essential requirement for the study .
a total number of 284 questionnaires were sent .
the notary gave the research group the list of those who had finally returned the questionnaire so as to contact them on the phone .
- statistical analysis the software package used for statistical analysis was lisrel v .
8.7 , which was used to test models of structural equations to assess the proposed model 's adjustment .
when data of the observed variables are collected for the theoretical model , lisrel can then be used for assessment purposes .
results the total number of returned questionnaires was 170 ( 59.85 %) .
using the model 's construction strategy , the proposed model was estimated , eliminating insignificant direct effects as long as they did not deteriorate global adjustment measures .
this model obtained different global values for different tests , which justifies its adjustment - - chi2 was 0.41 , rmsa was 0.02 , gfi was 0.99 , and agfi reached 0.96 .
all the relations observed between the structural model 's variables , shown in figure 2 , were significant for p < 0.05 , except the relation between depression and self - realization , with marginal signification .
a positive relation was observed between emotional tiredness and depersonalization ( chi2 = 0.41 ) and depression ( chi2 = 0.48 ) .
however , this dimension is negatively related to job satisfaction ( chi2 = - 0.47 ) .
the results obtained indicate that job satisfaction acts as a mediator between emotional tiredness and depression .
as observed in figure 2 , depression and self - realization correlate negatively ( chi2 = - 0.28 ) , as well as the latter variable and depersonalization ( chi2 = - 0.27 ) .

discussion this is the first study completed among spanish periodontists aimed at relating , within a structural model , the dimensions of the burnout syndrome with depression and job satisfaction .
research in dentistry is usually mainly focused on the patient 's health , thus neglecting the importance of health workers' ( dentists ') both mental and physical strength ( 8 ) .
therefore , the main aim of our research is getting to know the existing relation between the different conditions that affect the participants in the this study ( i.e. , sepa members ) .
analysis of the obtained results shows a positive relation between emotional tiredness and depression , as well as between the former and depersonalization. of course , the first dimension of the burnout syndrome can include similar symptoms to those observed in the depressive syndrome in the affected periodontists such as sadness or dejection , low self - esteem , appetite loss , weight or sleep - pattern changes , difficulties to concentrate , apathy , and feeling of guilt - - thus resulting in damaged social and interpersonal functions ( 9 ) .
these results coincide with most studies completed on this professional field ( see , for instance , haakanen ) ( 10 ) .
likewise , the self - realization dimension is completely opposite to the afore - defined concepts .
however , the most interesting result among those put forward in this paper is related to the mediating role of job satisfaction between emotional tiredness and depression. that is , job satisfaction can play a modulating role in the transition from emotional tiredness to the depressive syndrome .
thus , obviously , a negative relation is observed between satisfaction and depression .
graham ( 11 ) also completed a model based on a research on physicians in which the dimensions of the burnout syndrome were related to working stress , satisfaction and the sample 's psychiatric morbidity .
it included the protective factor of job satisfaction , which was positively related to self - realization .
if the dentist profession is analyzed in detail , it can be observed that many factors can trigger working stress and thus favor the professional burnout syndrome .
some are not dentistry - specific , as they can be considered to be shared by some other occupations , such as economic - administrative pressures , business management requirements , planning payments to third parties , or dealing with the growing competition ( 12 ) .
however , there are some highly dentistry - specific factors such as periodontic procedures ( 13 ) , working with anxious or distressed patients ( 14 ) , visibility and patients' limited access or negative , distrustful attitudes ( which are becoming more and more common each day ) , and the fact of provoking pain .
it must be taken into account that the patient that makes himself comfortable on the dental chair is usually seized with anxiety , which is also commonly transferred to the periodontist throughout the operation .
finally , not only clinical capacity is necessary , but the dentist also needs to get involved in the world of " marketing and productivity " , for which he receives no training along his academic life .
achieving this productivity entails covering a wider range of products and services within the same time unit , with the same operational costs and no quality reductions .
all this means a greater amount of managerial and operational knowledge that , if employed incorrectly , may lead to economic failure and subsequent stress in periodontic professionals .
in spite of suffering emotional tiredness , provoked by the aforementioned stress triggers , it seems logical to think that some kind of factor , which modulates transition to depressive feelings , exists when the earliest burnout - syndrome symptoms appear .
our results point out that this factor is the feeling of satisfaction derived from professional activity .
the existence of emotions in the periodontist that reflect wellbeing or satisfaction with the work completed on the patient , as well as the acquired knowledge that is put into practice , can modulate the subsequent appearance of a depressive syndrome .
these results are confirmed by comparison with those contributed by other studies , such as those completed by ramirez ( 15 ) among surgeons , radiologists and digestive - health physicians in different british associations .
they also coincide with becker ( 16 ) , who completed a study on gynecologists and obstetricians that showed a negative relation between job satisfaction and depression .
our results contrast with the structural model achieved by gil monte ( 17 ) , in which low job satisfaction appears as a mediator before job abandonment as well as a consequence of the burnout syndrome .
according to this author , professional burnout is a mediating variable among the professional activity 's different stressing factors and consequences such as poor health .
job satisfaction does play a relevant role as a modulating key of the tendency to job abandonment .
to sum up , it must be pointed out that - - although job satisfaction in dentistry seems to play a relevant role in the specialist 's transition from the burnout syndrome to depressive symptoms - - further research shall determine how and when this evolution takes place so as to try to control these conditions and thus assure better health and working quality for periodontists .

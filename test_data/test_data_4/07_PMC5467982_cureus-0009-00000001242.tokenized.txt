introduction leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ( lc ) affects five percent of patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , and the incidence is increasing .
this increased incidence is thought to be secondary to the prolonged survival of cancer patients .
nonetheless , patients with diagnosed lc have a poor prognosis , with an average survival of four to six weeks among untreated patients vs. four to six months among treated patients [ 1 ] .
in this report , we describe the case of a patient who presented with a recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung that manifested as lc. case presentation we present a case of a 76 - year - old caucasian female with a medical history that included hypertension , diabetes , and stage ib ( t2a n0 mx ) adenocarcinoma of the lung .
at the time of cancer diagnosis , she underwent lobectomy of the affected right upper lobe .
the surgical margins were negative on pathology , and she received adjuvant chemotherapy comprising pemetrexed plus carboplatin for three months .
her clinical course was good , and she reported no complaints during regular routine follow - ups .
after a 1.5 - year follow - up period , she noticed intermittent numbness on the left side of her face , along with insidious , increasingly worsening left - sided hearing loss and weekly headaches that she described as a sharp shooting pain , mostly located over her left scalp , of less than 60 minutes' duration .
two months after these symptoms started , she began to experience " dizzy spells " and intermittent double vision .
upon continuation of these symptoms , she was subsequently examined at the clinic .
at the time of the examination , her eastern cooperative oncology group performance status was 1 .
brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed the development of several punctate foci with superficial enhancement bilaterally within the occipital regions , consistent with metastatic disease ( leptomeningeal vs. cortical location ) .
no significant mass or edema was observed ( figure 1 ) .
given her history of cancer , blood work , a diagnostic lumbar puncture , and a positron emission tomography ( pet )/ computed tomography ( ct ) scan were recommended to address the suspected recurrence .
following a lumbar puncture , her cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and cytology results were negative ( table 1 ) .
figure 1 mri of the brain showing multiple foci of superficial enhancement in the occipital region compatible with metastatic disease ( red circles ) table 1 cerebrospinal fluid results parameter value red cell count 48 / mm3 white cell count 0 / mm3 color colorless appearance clear glucose 141 mg / dl total protein 25.1 mg / dl albumin < 0.5 g / dl however , the pet / ct scan revealed bilateral hilar uptake ( 6.2 and 5.3 ) , consistent with a recurrence of cancer .
no other significant uptake was identified .
combined with the brain mri findings , we made a diagnosis of the leptomeningeal spread of a recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung .
the patient received one cycle of pemetrexed and bevacizumab for systemic disease .
the tumor was positive for an exon 19 deletion , at which point we initiated a discussion regarding the use of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) - tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tki ) therapy .
at three months post initiation of the treatment , the patient was no longer complaining of headaches and double vision .
her left - sided facial numbness and hearing loss markedly improved as well .
discussion decisions regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis depend on the patient , presentation , risk status , and cancer type .
whole - brain radiation therapy ( wbrt ) , intrathecal chemotherapy ( ic ) , ventriculoperitoneal shunting , egfr - tkis and , more recently , anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( alk ) inhibitor therapy [ 2 ] have yielded favorable outcomes in selected patients .
wbrt is a useful palliative therapy but does not appear to improve survival .
in a retrospective study of lc secondary to nsclc by morris , et al .
( 2012 ) , no significant difference in median survival was observed between 46 patients who received wbrt vs. 59 who did not ( p = 0.84 ) [ 3 ] .
in addition to the transient benefits , wbrt often causes unbearable side effects and carries a significant risk of cognitive decline , especially in patients older than 75 years of age .
this modality is therefore often reserved for patients with a poor functional status ( karnofsky performance score < 60 ) , encephalopathy , multiple serious neurologic deficits , bulky central nervous system ( cns ) disease , and extensive systemic disease with few treatment options .
although ic has been successfully used to treat lc in patients with lymphoma and breast cancer , no real consensus has been reached regarding ic for lung cancer .
traditionally , methotrexate and cytarabine are not considered active against lung cancers [ 4 - 5 ] , and early studies of lc indicate little or no response to these agents [ 4 - 5 ] .
topotecan , which is occasionally administered systemically to patients with nsclc , does not yield any real benefits when compared to other ic therapies , as demonstrated by groves , et al .
( 2008 ) in a multicenter study of lc secondary to all solid tumors .
this finding was attributed to the spread of cancer between the dura and arachnoid , rather than contiguous with the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .
notable side effects of ic include meningitis , seizures , and dizziness .
systemic chemotherapy ( sc ) has yielded mixed results as a result of limited leptomeningeal penetration .
most chemotherapeutic agents do not achieve good cns penetration .
the benefit of sc was primarily attributed to the treatment of systemic disease , rather than any effects on the course of leptomeningeal spread .
however , pemetrexed and bevacizumab have been shown to be effective against cns metastasis .
pemetrexed improves survival , both as an initial treatment option and in refractory cases with cns involvement , as shown by beerz , et al .
( 2010 ) in a study of 39 patients where 70 % of the patients achieved stable disease or a partial response with a median survival of 10 months .
bevacizumab has traditionally been used to treat glioblastoma multiforme and was proven safe for nsclc patients with cns metastases [ 6 ] .
one study of six patients , conducted in 2010 [ 6 ] , found that three patients achieved stable disease and two achieved a partial response .
intracranial hemorrhage was observed in only one of three patients using bevacizumab and a concurrent anticoagulation agent .
egfr - mutant lung cancer was first described in 2004 [ 7 ] and has since been characterized as a distinct subset of lung cancer .
egfr - tkis such as gefitinib and erlotinib have yielded promising results against these cancers , and both agents have been shown to significantly increase survival .
for example , one study of 17 patients with egfr - mutated lung cancer with brain metastasis ( exon 19 and 21 deletions ) demonstrated that eight of nine patients who concurrently received high - dose erlotinib therapy and wbrt achieved a partial or complete response , compared with six of eight patients treated with erlotinib alone [ 8 ] .
patients in that study had a median time to progression of 11.7 months .
osimertinib , an irreversible egfr - tki currently in phase i trials is a promising candidate ; patients who reached a treatment duration of 12 weeks exhibited symptomatic and radiologic improvements , and it is generally well tolerated [ 9 ] .
more recently , alk mutations have led to studies of crizotinib , an alk - tki that has yielded promising results [ 3 ] .
however , pre - existing lesions tended to progress and / or new intracranial lesions tended to develop during crizotinib therapy .
a recent phase ii trial found that alectinib , a second - generation alk - tki , was efficacious in crizotinib - resistant cases [ 10 ] .
conclusions although lc remains a complex disease with a grave prognosis , progress during the last decade has led to improved survival among affected patients .
however , the treatment of lc requires an individualized approach .
wbrt , systemic therapy , and targeted therapy have been evaluated as candidates for improving a patient 's quality of life .
the current research and treatments associated with genetic testing are promising , and the identification of mutations such as egfr and alk have facilitated the use of targeted therapies that have enhanced progression - free survival and overall survival .
although many of the treatments administered for lc remain palliative in nature , we have gained a better understanding of the obstacles that must be overcome to prolong survival and improve the quality of life of the affected patients .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

background site - directed mutagenesis is a widely - used technique for introducing mutations into a particular dna sequence , often with the goal of creating a point mutation in the corresponding amino acid sequence but otherwise leaving the overall sequence undisturbed .
however , this method provides no means for verifying its success other than sequencing the putative mutant construct : this can quickly become an expensive method for screening for successful mutations .
an alternative to sequencing is to simultaneously introduce a restriction site near the point mutation in manner such that the restriction site has no effect on the translated amino acid sequence .
thus , the novel restriction site can be used as a marker for successful mutation which can be quickly and easily assessed .
however , finding a restriction site that does not disturb the corresponding amino acid sequence is a time - consuming task even for experienced researchers .
a fast and easy to use computer program is needed for this task .
results we wrote a computer program , called sitefind , to help us design a restriction site within the mutation primers without changing the peptide sequence .
because of the redundancy of genetic code , a given peptide can be encoded by many different dna sequences .
since the list of possible restriction sites for a given dna sequence is not always obvious , sitefind automates this task .
the number of possible sequences a computer program must search through increases exponentially as the sequence length increases .
sitefind uses a novel " moving window " algorithm to reduce the number of possible sequences to be searched to a manageable level .
the user enters a nucleotide sequence , specifies what amino acid residues should be changed in the mutation , and sitefind generates a list of possible restriction sites and what nucleotides must be changed to introduce that site .
as a demonstration of its use , we successfully generated a single point mutation and a double point mutation in the wild - type sequence for kruppel - like factor 4 , an epithelium - specific transcription factor .
conclusion sitefind is an intuitive , web - based program that enables the user to introduce a novel restriction site into the mutated nucleotide sequence for use as a marker of successful mutation .
it is freely available from background there are several methods available for mutagenesis : 1 ) to isolate single strand template dna and then create the mutation with one complementary primer [ 1 ] ; 2 ) design two sets of pcr primers that overlap the mutation site , amplify the template by two pcr reactions and then clone the two pcr fragments and the vector by three piece ligation [ 2 ] ; 3 ) site - directed mutagenesis using the quikchange method [ 3 - 5 ] .
all of these in vitro mutagenesis methods require careful design of one or more primers that cover the mutation site .
currently , quikchange site - directed mutagenesis is the method of choice .
this method requires two complementary oligonucleotide primers flanking the desired mutated nucleotide on both the sense and anti - sense strands .
furthermore , each primer must contain one to several base - pair changes within the desired region .
pcr is then performed using these primers along with the gene of interest , which was previously inserted into a vector containing an antibiotic resistance gene .
the extension step of the polymerase chain reaction is given sufficient time to replicate the entire circular dna construct , with the reaction eventually ending where it started .
after several rounds of pcr , the resulting mixture of newly - synthesized mutant constructs and template dna is incubated with a methylation - specific endonuclease to remove the wild - type template dna which contains methylated nucleotides .
the mixture is then transformed into competent bacteria , plated on an antibiotic - containing medium , and grown overnight to in order to allow individual colonies to grow .
however , since the bacteria was transformed with a complex mixture of undigested template dna , successful point mutant copies of the template , and pcr side - products , it becomes difficult to determine which colonies contain the desired mutant construct .
restriction enzyme digestion of plasmid dna extracted from each colony can differentiate between correct and aberrant pcr products , but it cannot distinguish between bacteria transformed with template dna and bacteria transformed the with desired point mutant .
instead , plasmid dna extracted from each colony must be sent to a sequencing laboratory and the sequence manually scanned for a successful mutation .
if the number of colonies containing template dna is high relative to the total number of colonies , this can be an expensive and time - consuming process .
a simple method to confirm the presence of a point mutation prior to sequencing is to design the mutation of the sequence such that it introduces a novel restriction site , taking advantage of the redundancy of the genetic code [ 6 - 8 ] .
thus plasmid dna extracted from each colony can be digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and then run on a dna gel to check for the presence of a band not found in the template dna .
however , finding the correct set of mutations to the dna sequence in order to introduce a restriction site without disturbing its corresponding amino acid sequence is not always a trivial task , requiring the investigator to manually generate hundreds of possible dna sequences and then scan them for restriction sites .
even for an experienced molecular biologist , it will take time and luck to find a suitable site .
silmut , a program written and published several years ago , can be used to discover such diagnostic restriction sites [ 9 ] .
the user enters a short amino acid sequence , and silmut determines if any of 30 of the most common , 6 bp restriction sites can introduced within that sequence .
to make this task much faster and less error - prone , we wrote our own , web - based computer program , called sitefind .
in some cases , however , silent mutations in the coding sequence can have a drastic effect on the translation rate .
thus , the user must be alert to the possibility of codon bias in the organism where this sequence will be expressed .
implementation sitefind overview the ultimate goal of sitefind is to search a given nucleotide sequence for any possible restriction sites that can be introduced without disturbing the amino acid sequence that it codes for .
for example , the sequence ctcgaa codes for the amino acid sequence le , or leucine - glutamate , but does not possess any common restriction site .
however , by simply changing the last adenine to a guanine , the sequence becomes ctcgag , which is the restriction site for xhoi .
at the same time , the amino acid sequence is preserved , since both gaa and gag code for glutamate .
for such a short sequence , the necessary mutations to introduce a restriction site may be obvious , but sitefind can quickly search through much longer sequences , where potential restriction sites may be hidden in long sequence of nucleotides .
we found that on the average end - user personal computer , sitefind can handle sequences of up to approximately 400 bp. sitefind was designed with the purpose of introducing a restriction site into a nucleotide sequence as a marker for successful point mutation via site - directed mutagenesis .
consistent with this purpose , the user can specify which amino acids should be changed in the peptide sequence and then select the potential restriction site closest to the point mutation .
ideally , these two will overlap , but this is not always possible .
a novel restriction site within a few nucleotides of the point mutation is often sufficient to use as a marker .
algorithm optimizations the redundancy in the genetic code means that as the length of a given amino acid sequence increases , the number of possible dna sequences that can code for that sequence increases exponentially .
since the amino acid serine can be represented by six different codons , this means that a sequence of four serines can be represented by 64 ( 1296 ) different dna sequences .
to substantially reduce the number sequences to scan by our program , sitefind uses a " moving window " algorithm ( see fig. 1a ) .
the " moving window " algorithm effectively breaks up a long nucleotide sequence into a series of short , non - redundant sequences that can be then searched individually .
thus , a long amino acid sequence with millions of possible nucleotide sequences can be converted into 10 or so " windows " , each with only a few hundred possible sequences .
the size of each " window " is determined by the length of the longest restriction site the user is searching for .
in general , for a given restriction site of n nucleotides , the window must be at least 2n - 1 nucleotides long .
sitefind then shifts the window only enough to ensure overlap between windows such that any possible restriction site is found , meaning that the window is shifted forward no more than n nucleotides ( see fig. 1b ) .
this process is then repeated until the entire nucleotide sequence is traversed .
sitefind was originally written in c ++ as a simple command - line tool for in - house use .
we subsequently rewrote the program as a java applet embedded in a html web document , giving it a more intuitive , graphical interface and posted it on our institutional website .
the source code to our java applet is freely available and is released under the gpl [ 10 ] .
sitefind was written using textpad v4.7.3 [ 11 ] and compiled with the java 1.4.2 sdk [ 12 ] .
the website was designed with microsoft frontpage .
results using sitefind sitefind was designed to have an intuitive interface , with each step necessary to specify the search conditions presented in a separate window .
a button labeled " next " at the bottom right hand corner of each window allows the user to progress to the next step .
the sitefind applet loads in a browser once its webpage is visited and prints out a simple message identifying the program name and creator .
to begin , the user clicks " next " .
the first window prompts the user to enter a short segment ( preferably at least 15 nucleotides ) of the wild - type dna sequence , covering the region where a mutation is desired .
the user is then prompted to select the correct reading frame for the sequence .
after clicking " next " , the properly translated sequence is given , as shown in fig. 2a , the user then double - clicks the amino acid he wishes to mutate and selects from a drop - down list which residue it should be changed to. if the user wishes to mutate more than one amino acid , he can simply repeat this step .
each mutation is highlighted in red .
in the next window , the user can select which restriction sites the program should search for .
currently , sitefind has 131 restriction sites to choose from and uses them all by default , but the user is free to remove any of these or add new ones if so desired .
any restriction sites present in the wild - type sequence are removed from the search .
the next window then displays a progress bar as it searches : in most cases , the search takes no more than a few seconds .
once finished , the user can click " next " one last time , and the results are printed in a list .
a list of potential restriction sites is given , for each site , the wild - type sequence displayed , with the necessary mutant sequence displayed just under it. any differences between the two sequences are indicated .
below the mutant sequence , the location of the introduced restriction site is clearly marked .
if there are multiple locations in the sequence where a given restriction site can be introduced , only the location closest to the desired point mutation is displayed .
( see fig. 2b ) .
the user can then use this information to design the appropriate primers for performing site - directed mutagenesis .
examples of its use we used this tool routinely in our laboratory .
for example , kruppel - like factor 4 ( klf4 ) is a transcription factor implicated in colon cancer .
previous studies on klf4 have shown that a single point mutation , r390s , can abolish its ability to enter the nucleus , where it is normally exclusively located [ 13,14 ] .
in order to make such a construct , we entered the wild - type dna sequence corresponding to amino acids 385 - 393 into sitefind and then specified the desired mutation r390s .
using the default settings , sitefind found 10 restriction sites that we could use as a marker .
we chose bglii since no bglii site was present in our original construct , and it required the mutation of only three nucleotides .
using this information , we were then able to design the proper primers for site - directed mutagenesis .
after transformation of competent bacteria with the pcr product , we plated the cells on ampicillin - containing agar overnight .
we then picked several colonies and isolated their plasmid dna .
the plasmid dna was then digested with clai , which is present in the vector backbone , and bglii .
since bglii is neither present within the vector backbone nor the wild - type klf4 sequence , bglii should only cut successfully mutated plasmid dna , yielding a 1244 bp fragment ( see fig. 3a ) .
as shown in fig. 3b , wild - type plasmid dna yields only one fragment , whereas successfully mutated dna yields a second , 1.2 kb fragment .
to confirm that our mutant construct is expressed , we transfected 293t cells , lysed the cells 48 - hours post - transfection , and performed an alpha - flag western blot with the lysate. fig. 3c demonstrates that both the wild - type and mutant constructs express a protein of identical size , whereas transfection with an empty vector yields no flag - tagged protein whatsoever .
this is expected since a point mutation should have no detectable effect on the molecular weight .
finally we verified the mutant construct by sequencing ( see. fig. 3d ) .
to demonstrate that sitefind can be used to design multiple point mutation , we produced a double point mutation of klf4 , mutating two successive lysines ( k225 / k229 ) to arginine .
using sitefind , we decided to introduce an nhei site just 3 ' to the second point mutation .
after pcr and plasmid purification , we digested the mutant construct with nhei and ecori .
nhei should only cut the mutant construct , producing a 767 bp fragment ( see fig. 4a ) .
as expected nhei cuts the mutant construct to produce a second fragment of approximately 750 bp , whereas the wild - type plasmid yields only one fragment ( see fig. 4b ) .
we confirmed expression of this construct in 293t cells , and as expected , both wild - type and k225 / 229r mutant klf4 produce bands of identical size ( see fig. 4c ) .
finally , we verified our construct by sequencing ( see fig. 4d ) .
discussion there are several programs available for designing primers for site - directed mutagenesis .
most of these programs are used to calculate the annealing temperature and to predict secondary structures .
they cannot be used to design a restriction site .
sitefind is designed specifically for this .
in an easy - to - use , graphical interface , the user is prompted to enter the desired template nucleotide sequence .
then , the translated amino acid sequence is given and the user is able to select which amino acids to mutate .
after that , the user can specify which restriction sites to search for , and even add additional sites if so desired .
finally , after a few seconds , a list of potential restriction sites is given .
for each site , only the location closest to the desired point mutation and involving the fewest number of mutations is given .
this substantially reduces the amount of information the user has to process prior to selecting the optimal sequence for site - directed mutagenesis , saving both time and money .
furthermore , sitefind can be used for any type of mutagenesis and places no limits on the number of point mutations in the mutant sequence .
as the sequence length increases , when simply generating every possible nucleotide sequence for a given amino acid sequence and then searching for the presence of a restriction site , the time required for the search increases exponentially .
if done in this manner , searches of longer than 15 bp quickly become infeasible .
our " moving window " algorithm is a novel way to drastically reduce the time required for a search , and yet does so without missing any potential sites .
because sitefind implements this algorithm , it can process sequences up to 400 bp. shankarappa et. al. have published a computer program called silmut [ 9 ] .
silmut is a simple command - line program that can search a short amino acid sequence for the 30 most common , 6 bp restriction sites .
it does this by translating each restriction site in all three frames and compares every possible translation with the user - specified amino acid sequence .
during preparation of this manuscript , we discovered another web - based program that performs a function similar to sitefind , called the primer generator [ 15 ] .
however , the primer generator requires the user to manually type in both the wild - type sequence and desired mutant amino acid sequence and to manually pick from hundreds of output sequences .
furthermore , it is not suitable for nucleotide sequences longer than 15 bp. in contrast , sitefind , automatically translates the input nucleotide sequence and allows the user to graphically select which residues to mutate .
furthermore , our window algorithm enables sitefind to quickly and efficiently work with sequences of any length .
for each restriction site , if multiple locations are found , sitefind only gives the location closest to the desired point mutation : this means much less information for the user to parse in order to choose the best restriction site and sequence .
although not specifically designed for it , sitefind could be used to make translational fusions between two different coding sequences .
the user can specify that sitefind give every location found for each restriction enzyme , and then run a search on a portion of both sequences .
then , through manual comparison , the user could select a restriction site found within both sequences and design the appropriate primers for introducing the necessary mutations .
conclusion sitefind is a useful tool for performing site - directed mutagenesis , enabling the user to introduce a novel restriction site into the mutated nucleotide sequence for use as a marker of successful mutation .
the " moving window " is a novel algorithm that enables sitefind to work efficiently with sequences up to 400 bp. in order to demonstrate its utility , we introduced a point mutation , r390s , into the wild - type sequence of klf4 while simultaneously introducing a novel bglii restriction site .
this mutant dna could be cut by bglii , as expected , and expressed a full - length protein in 293t cells .
for a double point - mutation , k225 / 229r , we introduced a novel nhei restriction site .
this mutant dna could be cut by nhei , as expected , and expressed a full - length protein in 293t cells .

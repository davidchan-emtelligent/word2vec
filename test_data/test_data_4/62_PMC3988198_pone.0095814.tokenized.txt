accurate data processing improves the reliability of affymetrix gene expression profiles from ffpe samples figure 1 is incorrect and has been updated here .
please see the corrected figure 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0086511.g001 figure 1 correlation between frozen - ( ffn ) and ffpe - derived fold changes as a function of the processing procedure .
fold changes between abc and gcb subgroups were computed in the williams dataset [ 15 ] for three representative processing pipelines , separately for frozen - and ffpe - derived data .
commonly de probesets are in dark yellow , probesets only de in frozen data are in blue and those only de in ffpe data are in dark red .

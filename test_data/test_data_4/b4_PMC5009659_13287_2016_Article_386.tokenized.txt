background the paracrine and regenerative activities of mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) may vary with different stem cell sources .
the aim of the present study is to compare the effects of mscs from different sources on acute kidney injury ( aki ) induced by cisplatin and their influence on renal regeneration .
methods a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin ( 5 mg / kg ) was used to induce aki in 120 sprague - dawley rats .
rats were treated with either rat bone marrow stem cells ( rbmscs ) , human adipose tissue - derived stem cells ( hadscs ) , or human amniotic fluid - derived stem cells ( hafscs ) .
5 x 106 mscs of different sources were administered through rat tail vein in a single dose , 24 hours after cisplatin injection .
within each group , rats were sacrificed at the 4th , 7th , 11th , and 30th day after cisplatin injection .
serum creatinine , bun , and renal tissue oxidative stress parameters were measured .
renal tissue was scored histopathologically for evidence of injury , regeneration , and chronicity .
immunohistochemistry was also done using ki67 for renal proliferative activity evaluation .
results mscs of the three sources were able to ameliorate cisplatin - induced renal function deterioration and tissue damage .
the rat bmscs - treated group had the lowest serum creatinine by day 30 ( 0.52 +/ - 0.06 ) compared to hadscs and hafscs .
all msc - treated groups had nearly equal antioxidant activity as indicated by the decreased renal tissue malondialdehyde ( mda ) and increased reduced glutathione ( gsh ) level and superoxide dismutase ( sod ) activity at different time intervals .
additionally , all mscs improved injury and regenerative scores .
rat bmscs had the highest count and earliest proliferative activity in the renal cortex by day 7 as identified by ki67 ; while , hafscs seem to have the greatest improvement in the regenerative and proliferative activities with a higher count of renal cortex ki67 - positive cells at day 11 and with the least necrotic lesions .
conclusions rat bmscs , hadscs , and hafscs , in early single iv dose , had a renoprotective effect against cisplatin - induced aki , and were able to reduce oxidative stress markers .
rat bmscs had the earliest proliferative activity by day 7 ; however , hafscs seemed to have the greatest improvement in the regenerative activities .
human adscs were the least effective in the terms of proliferative and regenerative activities .
keywords cisplatin nephrotoxicity mesenchymal stem cells adipose - derived amniotic fluid - derived this work was supported by science and technology development fund ( stdf ) , minister of scientific research , egypt.grant number 1061 sobh mohamed issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) are an important source of tissue regeneration as they have self - renewal and multilineage differentiation potentials [ 1 , 2 ] .
although adult bone marrow ( bm ) and adipose tissue - derived stem cells ( adscs ) are the main sources for clinical use , their use is limited because of invasive procedures in harvesting and donor age requirements [ 3 , 4 ] .
therefore , new sources of mscs , like placenta , umbilical cord blood ( ucb ) , and amnion , have become increasingly necessary .
however , these stem cell sources still require complex processing for cell isolation [ 5 - 7 ] .
human amniotic fluid - derived stem cells ( hafscs ) , being free from ethical considerations and easy to isolate via noninvasive methods , are a fruitful new source .
additionally , they have high differentiation abilities and possess immunosuppressive potential , allowing them to be used in allogeneic settings [ 8 , 9 ] .
although , hafscs exhibit similar characteristics to bmscs and adscs , including fibroblastoid morphology , surface proteins , and differentiation potential as defined by the proposed international society for cellular therapy ( isct ) criteria [ 10 , 11 ] , the isct criteria lack information of mscs' potential as therapeutic cell sources .
therefore , the potential of mscs from different sources must be evaluated to select the best one for cell - based therapy in a particular disease model .
comparative studies of the therapeutic potential of hafscs and other mscs sources are lacking .
as the number of clinical trials and a variety of adult cells was used in regenerative therapy , cell therapeutic potential will be instantly required .
it is mandatory to realize the possible mechanisms by which mscs induce their therapeutic effect , as this may explain the key mechanisms of tissue repair .
paracrine actions , anti - inflammatory effect , or promoting regeneration via soluble factors have been proposed [ 12 , 13 ] .
although there is evidence that mscs from diverse tissues are different , the potential benefits and mechanisms of these variously sourced mscs remain unexplored .
thus we sought in this study to directly compare the therapeutic potentials of mscs of different sources including rat bone marrow stem cells ( rbmscs ) , hadscs , and hafscs in the setting of early and late kidney injury and the role of a probable antioxidant mechanism .
this may help to identify a preferable cell source for treating toxic acute kidney injury ( aki ) induced by cisplatin .
methods the experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee , faculty of medicine , mansoura university .
agents cisplatin was obtained from david bull laboratories ( hornsby , nsw , australia ) dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) containing 20 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) was obtained from invitrogen ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
stem cell isolation human adipose - derived mesenchymal stem cells mscs from adipose tissue were isolated as previously described by bunnell et al .
[ 14 ] with modifications .
the fat was gathered under sterile conditions from liposuction surgeries and washed at least three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) containing 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic solution ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) until all blood vessels and connective tissues appear to have been released .
adipose tissue samples were digested in trypsin 0.125 % at 37 degreesc ( 3 ml for each 1 gm tissue ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) with shaking at 100 rpm for 60 minutes .
samples were observed every 15 minutes and shaken vigorously .
after digestion , the trypsin activity was neutralized by adding an equal volume of dmem containing 10 % fbs ( thermo fisher scientific ) to the tissue sample .
then , 100 - mum filters ( bd falcon , san jose , ca , usa ) were used to obtain the cell suspension and avoid the solid aggregates .
after that , the samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature .
to finish the detachment of the stromal cells from the primary adipocytes , the samples were taken out of the centrifuge and shaken vigorously followed by another centrifugation step then the supernatant was removed without disturbing the cells .
the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( promega , mannheim , germany ) to lyse red blood cells ( rbcs ) , incubated for 10 minutes and washed with 10 ml of pbs containing 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic and was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes .
the supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in dmem with 20 % fbs and 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic solution in a 25 - cm2 culture flask and maintained in an incubator supplied with 5 % co2 humidified atmosphere at 37 degreesc .
human amniotic fluid - derived stem cells ( hafscs ) mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) were isolated from the human amniotic fluid ( haf ) of 15 women who experienced a cesarean section for breech presentation .
they had given their informed consent according to the instructions of the ethics committee of the faculty of medicine , mansoura university .
the mean +/ - sd pregnancy duration ( fetal age + 2 weeks ) was 38 +/ - 1 weeks and the mean volume of the haf samples was 10.6 +/ - 4.5 ml. after the uterine muscle was opened for the cesarean section , haf samples were collected by puncturing the membranes .

the study design and protocol was revised and approved by mansoura local ethics committee .
a total of 120 inbred female sprague - dawley rats ( 8 weeks old , weighing 200 - 250 g ) , from the medical experimental research center ( merc ) at mansoura faculty of medicine , were used and divided into the following groups : rats were randomly assigned to six equal groups ( 20 rats each ) sacrificed at different time intervals : ( i ) negative control group : rats were injected with 1 ml normal saline alone ; ( ii ) positive control cisplatin - injected group : rats were injected with a single dose of cisplatin 5 mg / kg in 1 ml saline intraperintoneally ( i.p. ) ; ( iii ) cisplatin - injected and rbmscs - treated group : rats were injected with 0.5 ml of culture media containing 5 x 106 rat bmscs into the tail vein 1 day after cisplatin injection ; ( iv ) cisplatin - injected and hadscs - treated group : rats were injected with 0.5 ml of culture media containing 5 x 106 human adscs into the tail vein 1 day after cisplatin injection ; ( v ) cisplatin - injected and hafscs - treated group : rats were injected with 0.5 ml of culture media containing 5 x 106 hafscs into the tail vein 1 day after cisplatin injection ; ( vi ) cisplatin - injected and fresh culture media - treated group : rats were injected with 0.5 ml of culture media into the tail vein .
each main group was further subgrouped according to the time of sacrifice into four equal divisions ( n = 5 ) : subgroup a : rats were sacrificed at day 4 post - cisplatin injection ; subgroup b : rats were sacrificed at day 7 post - cisplatin injection ; subgroup c : rats were sacrificed at day 11 post - cisplatin injection ; subgroup d : rats were sacrificed at day 30 post - cisplatin injection .
twenty - four - hour urine samples were collected for each rat using nalgene metabolic cages ( nalge nunc international corp. , rochester , ny , usa ) before sacrifice .
rats were sacrificed using an overdose of thiopental .
blood samples were then collected by syringe from the heart and immediately centrifuged at approximately 3000 g for 5 minutes , and then taken for biochemical measurements .
the kidneys were removed for oxidative stress parameters and histopathological examination .
biochemical analysis kidney function tests ( serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine clearance ) were assessed ; in addition , oxidative stress parameters were tested in renal tissue homogenate where malondialdehyde ( mda ) , superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , and reduced glutathione ( gsh ) were determined spectrophotometrically in all groups according to the methods of ohkawa et al .
[ 20 ] and ellman [ 21 ] , respectively .

different research groups had identified and compared cellular morphology , surface markers , and differentiation abilities of stem cells from several sources [ 11 , 22 ] .
in this study , we directly compared the therapeutic potentials of mscs of different sources including rbmscs , hadscs , and hafscs in the setting of cisplatin - induced early and late kidney injury .
prior to that , we reported a full characterization of different mscs used .
facs analysis showed all mscs were positive for expression of a cluster of differentiation ( cd ) of a mesenchymal nature ( cd29 , cd44 , and cd90 ) and negative for the hematopoietic lineage markers ( cd34 and cd45 ) .
moreover , the differentiation abilities of mscs of different sources were also established .
cells showed multipotent differentiation potential into the three lineages of osteogenesis , chondrogenesis , and adipogenesis that is a standard for defining mscs .
this was evaluated by using special stain for each lineage ; alizarin red stain for osteogenesis , safranin o stain for chondrogenesis , and oil - red - o stain for adipogenesis that stains cytoplasmic lipid droplets .
in addition , hafscs showed similar msc properties with either rbmscs or hadscs in their morphology and surface markers .
in the third passage , hafscs exhibited a spindle - shaped morphology analogous to that of rbmscs and hadscs .
human afscs were comparable to rbmscs and hadscs in their mesenchymal differentiating potentials .
human adscs and afscs showed msc features as defined by the isct minimum criteria : a spindle shape , multilineage differentiation , and surface marker expression .
kern et al .
[ 22 ] showed that adscs were preferable as they hold the highest frequency of mscs ; however , hafscs seemed to be more expandable .
such studies aimed for more detailed description of stem cell biology of various sources .
the direction to use hafscs in cell - based therapy is its better senescence patterns which vary between msc sources [ 23 ] .
zaim et al .
[ 24 ] observed that senescence was age - dependent .
in addition , it was demonstrated that neonatal mscs showed no sign of cellular senescence over long - term culture [ 25 ] .
the biological properties of neonatal mscs were determined to be different from adult mscs .
one study showed a significant decrease in stem cell characteristics with advancing donor age in humans mscs [ 26 ] .
in addition , hafscs showed great expansion potential and senescence retardation than adscs and bmscs in spite of their longer culture time [ 27 ] .
further studies of msc senescence are required to address these issues .
a major concern that remains to be uncovered is determining which cell source is most appropriate and effective in a specific disease model .
here , we directly compared the therapeutic potentials of rbmscs , hadscs , and hafscs in the context of cisplatin - induced early and late kidney injury and the role of a probable antioxidant mechanism .
mscs of the three sources were able to ameliorate cisplatin - induced renal function deterioration and tissue damage .
the rat bmscs - treated group had the lowest serum creatinine by day 30 compared to hadscs and hafscs .
moreover , all mscs - treated groups had nearly equal antioxidant activities at different time intervals .
to quantitatively test the paracrine properties of various mscs , oxidative stress markers were assessed in renal tissue homogenate of different groups .
increased mda free radical and decreased gsh level and sod activity occurred with cisplatin toxicity .
on the other hand , the level of these markers was significantly changed in all msc treatment groups .
it is necessary to recognize the mechanism of msc - induced tissue recovery since this may explain the several aspects of tissue repair .
earlier studies showed that mscs had the capacity to home to the site of injury and differentiate into specific cell lineages through a mechanical effect [ 28 ] .
in our data , mscs from the three different sources injected intravenously had a specific mechanism underlying their therapeutic benefit and this could be related to the paracrine role of secreted growth factors and cytokines [ 29 ] that modify the cellular microenvironment , decreasing oxidative stress , limiting damage , and enhancing tissue repair .
the early administration of a single dose of stem cells permits the speculation of an antioxidant paracrine - protective mechanism for stem cells of the three sources against the acute nephrotoxicity of cisplatin .
assessment of renal tissue proliferative activity by the evolution of ki67 - positive cells means that the migrating stem cells ( whether extrarenal or intrarenal from the niche of the inner medulla ) aggregated but remained quiescent in the earlier periods ( day 4 ) till they reached the interstitium as aggregates of peritubular solid sheets in the later period ( day 11 ) where they began to colonize the necrotic tubules and started to divide actively and regenerate the damaged tissues .
after complete regeneration ( day 30 ) , all compartments of the kidney returned quiescent ki67 - negative except the cortex .
we speculated that the ki67 - positive cells were migrating extrarenal stem cells by their time - course appearance in kidney tissue .
inconsistent with our results , one detailed study demonstrated a time - linked evidence of incorporation of extrarenal bmscs during regeneration in a renal ischemia rat model [ 30 ] .
contrarily to this speculation , exogenous stem cells may modulate the renal microenvironment through paracrine action that enhances or mobilizes interstitial renal residents [ 31 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to directly compare the therapeutic potentials of mscs of different sources including rbmscs , hadscs , and hafscs in the setting of early and late kidney injury and the role of a probable antioxidant mechanism .
the limitation of the present study is that the rat bmscs used were not completely pure as noticed from the results of the facs ( cd29 , 48.9 % and cd90 , 54.9 %) .
these cells did not exactly meet one of the minimal criteria of mscs .
still , other criteria such as plastic adherence and differentiation are fulfilled [ 10 ] .
conclusions in summary , we suggest that various mscs tested have comparable therapeutic potential against cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury .
all types of stem cells led to significant improvement in all tested biochemical and histopathological parameters .
the beneficial effects appeared as early as the 4th - day subgroups evaluations .
rbmscs seem to have significantly greater improvement in the renal function tests .
it has the highest antioxidant activity .
however , hafscs seem to have the greatest improvement in the regenerative and proliferative activities with a higher count of ki67 - positive cells on day 11 with the least necrotic lesions ( table 4 , fig. 11d ) .
we believe that primitive hafscs have biological advantages in comparison to other adult sources , making these cells a useful tool for clinical applications of cell therapy .

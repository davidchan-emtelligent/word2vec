the prognosis of glioma patients is usually poor , especially in patients with glioblastoma ( world health organization ( who ) grade iv ) .
the regulatory functions of microrna ( mirna ) on genes have important implications in glioma cell survival .
however , there are not many studies that have investigated glioma survival by integrating mirnas and genes while also considering pathway structure .
in this study , we performed sample - matched mirna and mrna expression profilings to systematically analyze glioma patient survival .
during this analytical process , we developed pathway - based random walk to identify a glioma core mirna - gene module , simultaneously considering pathway structure information and multi - level involvement of mirnas and genes .
the core mirna - gene module we identified was comprised of four apparent sub - modules ; all four sub - modules displayed a significant correlation with patient survival in the testing set ( p - values <= 0.001 ) .
notably , one sub - module that consisted of 6 mirnas and 26 genes also correlated with survival time in the high - grade subgroup ( who grade iii and iv ) , p - value = 0.0062 .
furthermore , the 26 - gene expression signature from this sub - module had robust predictive power in four independent , publicly available glioma datasets .
our findings suggested that the expression signatures , which were identified by integration of mirna and gene level , were closely associated with overall survival among the glioma patients with various grades .

introduction glioma is the most common form of primary brain tumor , accounting for 7 % of the years of life lost from cancer before the age of 70 [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
according to the world health organization ( who ) criteria , glioma tumors are histologically separated into grade i through iv. despite significant improvements in treatments for glioma patients , the median survival remains poor , particularly for those with glioblastoma ( gbm , grade iv ) .
patients with newly diagnosed gbm exhibit a median survival of approximately one year , with generally poor responses to all therapeutic modalities [ 3 ] .
thus , elucidation of the glioma survival event is important and could potentially aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma patients .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a class of non - coding rnas able to regulate gene expression at the post - transcriptional level by binding to the 3 ' untranslated region of target messenger rnas ( mrnas ) and causing a block of translation and / or mrna degradation [ 4 ] .
recently , a growing level of attention has been focused on the biological interplay between mrna expression in conjunction with corresponding mirna data in various cancer types , including glioma [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
thus , the amount of sample - matched mirna - gene profiles ( mirna and gene expression profiles quantified using exactly the same set of biological samples ) is rapidly increasing for such mirna - gene integrative analysis .
more importantly , the idea that many biological factors are coordinated at the network level rather than an individual molecular level has been accepted [ 3 ]. and some studies have interrogated kinds of networks to understand the complex regulatory mechanisms in the glioma , for example the mirna - tf mediated regulatory network [ 9 ] .
as a biological network , pathway provides reliable topology structure information which could be a platform for multi - dimensional data integration .
recently , biological pathways have been applied to explore the mechanism involved in many aspects , including disease occurrence , mirna regulation and drug action [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
focusing on glioma survival event , many experimental studies have demonstrated that the regulatory function of mirnas on genes , which further affects key biological pathways , plays a role in cell survival process .
for example , tumor - suppressive mir - 326 regulated notch pathway , an important glioma cell survival pathway , by mediating the toxic effects of notch knockdown [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
mir - 221 and mir - 222 induced cell survival in gbm by targeting pro - apoptotic gene puma in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [ 15 ] .
in the present , some microarray studies have tried to explore glioma cell survival mechanism and identify signature for predicting patient clinical outcome at the gene level [ 16 ] or mirna level [ 17 ] .
in a systematic perspective , the glioma survival process is also coordinated at the multiple mirna - gene regulation interactions .
however , the systematic integration of mirna and mrna expression for analyzing glioma patient survival has not been carefully studied to date. and only a small part of genes as core factors play an important role in glioma patient survival prediction .
the integrated analysis of multi - dimensional data has the potential power to identify core and robust survival signatures , which could effectively predict the clinical outcome of glioma patients .
in this study , we have profiled sample - matched mirna - mrna expression data from 160 glioma tumors to systematically analyze glioma survival .
in the analytical process , we considered the joint impact of mirnas and genes to identify glioma survival related pathways , and then developed a pathway - based random walk ( pbrw ) method to identify a glioma core mirna - gene module .
after dissecting the core mirna - gene module , we verified that one sub - module which consisted of 6 mirnas and 26 genes displayed a power to predict the clinical outcome of glioma patients .
materials and methods datasets our dataset and patient information the sample - matched mirna and mrna expression profiling upon 160 glioma samples were collected from the chinese glioma genome atlas ( cgga , http :// www.cgcg.org.cn /) [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
the 160 glioma cases included 63 who grade ii patients ( 50 astrocytomas and 13 oligodendrogliomas ) , 33 grade iii patients ( 8 anaplastic astrocytomas , 10 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and 15 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas ) and 64 gbm patients ( 60 primary gbm and 4 secondary gbm ) .
in this study , we identified a glioma core mirna - gene survival module by integrating analysis of the sample - matched mirna and mrna expression data .
gene expression omnibus datasets four independent mrna expression datasets with patient survival information were from the following studies : freije et al .
[ 16 ] , phillips et al .
[ 20 ] , murat et al .
[ 21 ] and lee et al .
[ 22 ] .
we extracted corresponding raw data from gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database [ 23 ] ( accession number : gse4412 , gse4271 , gse7696 , and gse13041 ) .
in all datasets , we eliminated the glioma samples who had survival time less than 30 days , since these samples might have died for reasons other than the disease itself [ 17 ] .
then four expression profilings of 73 , 77 , 76 , and 191 samples were utilized in this study .
all expression profilings were created and normalized using rma algorithm in the bioconductor affy package ( version 1.28.1 ) .
the cancer genome atlas datasets independent sample - matched mirna and gene expression datasets were downloaded from tcga database ( http :// tcga - data.nci.nih.gov / docs / publications / gbm _ exp /) .
level three data gave calls for mirnas and genes per sample after quantile normalization and background correction .
the average expression values were calculated for duplicated samples .
only tumor samples were considered in our study .
in addition , we eliminated samples with karnofsky 's score less than 70 and survival time less than 30 days , since these patients might have died for reasons other than the disease itself [ 17 ] .
finally , a total of 276 patients who fit these criteria and exhibited common mirna and gene expression were utilized in this study .
mirna target genes we acquired mirna target genes from eleven common mirna target predicting datasets : diana - microt [ 24 ] , mirsvr [ 25 ] , pictar5 [ 26 ] , rna22 [ 27 ] , rnahybrid [ 28 ] , targetscan [ 29 ] , pita [ 30 ] , mirtarget2 [ 31 ] , targetminer [ 32 ] , miranda [ 33 ] , and two valid databases [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
firstly , we obtained all mirna - gene regulation information from these eleven prediction datasets .
in order to improve the reliability of the predicted target genes , we extracted only the corresponding target regulations that emerged from at least six of the datasets listed above .
biological pathways information the information regarding biological pathways was obtained from kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway database [ 36 ] .
we applied bioconductor package isubpathwayminer [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] to obtain all the biological pathways , including 150 metabolic pathways and 150 non - metabolic pathways .
we utilized these pathways to identify glioma survival related pathways .
methods the framework the 160 glioma cases were randomly divided into a training set ( n = 80 ) and a testing set ( n = 80 ) .
table 1 lists the clinicopathological characteristics of patients in both sets , and the entire set .
in the following , we performed an integrated analysis of the sample - matched mirna and mrna expression data using the training set .
as shown in figure 1 , the framework included following steps .
in step1 , we used kaplan - meier survival analysis to identify glioma survival related mirnas and genes , and then integrated these mirnas and genes to further identify glioma survival related pathways .
in step2 , we developed pathway - based random walk to identify glioma core survival genes from these pathways based on the pathway structure information .
in step3 , we finally identified a glioma core mirna - gene module by integrating all the regulatory interaction between glioma survival related mirnas and glioma core survival genes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0096908.g001 figure 1 workflow overview .
we identified a glioma core survival module based on sample - matched mirna , mrna expression and pathways structure .
first , we utilized kaplan - meier ( k - m ) survival analysis to identify glioma survival related mirnas and genes .
then , we integrated these mirnas and genes to further identify kegg pathways .
finally , we developed a pathway - based random walk method to identify glioma core survival genes from each pathway , and constructed a glioma core mirna - gene survival module .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0096908.t001 table 1 clinicopathological characteristics of patients in the training set , the testing set , and entire patient set .

one is k - mean clustering method [ 39 ] , the other is nearest centroid classification method [ 40 ] .
for above two methods , glioma samples were both divided into two groups according to the expression value of the corresponding signature .
the survival differences between two groups were assessed by kaplan - meier estimate , and compared using the log - rank test .
we also performed cox multivariate analysis to evaluate the contribution of other independent prognostic factors .
the expression signature and other known factors were used in the multivariate analysis .
in all survival analysis processes , a p - value < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant result .
the identification of survival pathways for pathways from kegg pathway database , the more annotated glioma survival related genes ( mirna 's target genes ) , the more association with the glioma survival .
so hypergeometric distribution was utilized to evaluate the survival significance and the p - value was calculated for pathways as follows : where m was the number of the human whole genome , and t was the number of genes included in one pathway .
the number of glioma survival related genes ( or mirna 's target genes ) was n , and r genes out of n genes were included in the pathway .
pathway - based random walk we developed pathway - based random walk ( pbrw ) method to identify glioma core survival genes based on the glioma survival related pathways .
firstly , we reconstructed the glioma survival related pathways graphically using r - based isubpathwayminer package [ 37 ] developed by our previous work .
the reconstruction retained the raw information of these pathways , particularly for the pathway structure information .
we then changed these pathway graphs into column - normalized adjacency matrices , which consisted of 0 and 1 .
for each adjacency matrix , we took the glioma survival related genes and mirna 's target genes as the seed nodes ; and then utilized random walk algorithms to identify glioma core survival genes [ 41 ] .
the formula of random walk algorithms is as follows : where w is the column - normalized adjacency matrix of survival related pathway and is a vector in which a node in the pathway matrix holds probability of finding itself in this process up to step t. in this study , the initial probability vector was constructed in such a way that equal probabilities were assigned to all seed nodes ; the sum of their probabilities was equal to one .
additionally , the restart of the walker at each step is probability r ( r = 0.7 ) .
until the difference between and falls below 10 - 6 , the probabilities will reach a steady state .
then , all genes in the pathway graph were ranked according to the values in the steady - state probability vector . results identification of glioma core mirna - gene survival module integration of mirna and mrna expression to identify glioma survival related pathways for 80 patients of the training set , we performed kaplan - meier survival analysis on the sample - matched mrna and mirna expression data to identify glioma survival related genes and mirnas .
in this process , glioma samples were divided into two risk groups according to the mean expression value of the corresponding mirna ( gene ) in each expression profiling , and p - values were calculated .
a total of 115 mirnas and 1962 genes were identified as glioma survival related mirnas and genes , with p - values < 0.001 .
for the 115 survival related mirnas , we initially obtained their target genes which emerged from at least six of the eleven common mirna target predicting datasets ( see materials and methods ). and for each survival related mirna , we annotated its target genes into pathways from the kegg database [ 36 ] , and the pathway which was annotated by more target genes was more likely to be regulated by this mirna .
so hypergeometric distribution was utilized to identify significant biological pathways regulated by each survival related mirnas with a strict cut - off of p - value < 0.01 .
similarly , we also identified 18 pathways which were significantly enriched by 1962 survival related genes .
among these pathways , 14 pathways were also regulated by more than one survival related mirnas .
when many pathways were considered , a high false positive discovery rate was likely to result , and we therefore calculated fdr corrected p - values for pathways in the identification procedure using the benjamini - hochberg fdr method ( table s1 ) .
the results showed that 14 common pathways also remained significant at the usual cut - off of fdr < 0.15 , suggesting a low false discovery rate .
finally , we regarded these 14 pathways as glioma survival related pathways , which were identified by integrating gene and mirna expression level ; most of these pathways were associated with occurrence of glioma tumor .
detailed information concerning the 14 glioma survival related pathways is given in table s2 .
glioma survival related mirnas and genes walking in the pathways to identify core survival module biological pathways provided topology structure information for mirna - gene integrative analysis in glioma cell survival .
so we developed a method named pathway - based random walk ( pbrw ) to identify more core survival genes at the pathway level .
for each glioma survival related mirna , we performed pbrw for all survival related pathways regulated by this mirna .
during this process , considering the joint impact of mirna and gene level , we took glioma survival related genes and survival related mirna 's target genes as the seed nodes .
then a random walker started from these seed nodes to identify more core survival genes in the pathway structure .
a detailed description of the pbrw method is shown in materials and methods .
following the pbrw method , all genes from each survival related pathway received a score ; and a higher score indicated more survival association with glioma patients in this pathway .
we utilized a stringent cutoff ( top 3 %) according to the score and thus obtained a set of glioma core survival genes from each pathway .
take an example , two membrane receptors ( itgb and rtk ) were identified as glioma core survival genes from the focal adhesion pathway ( fig. s1 ). and for each survival related mirnas , we combined all glioma core survival genes from all pathways it regulated , and constructed a mirna - gene relationship .
in this study , a total of 194 core survival genes were identified from all survival related pathways , and these genes were indirectly regulated by 34 survival related mirnas .
to systematically analyze glioma cell survival event , we further merged all the mirna - gene relationship of 34 survival related mirnas to construct a glioma core mirna - gene module .
dissecting the glioma core survival module mediated by mirnas the glioma core survival module consisted of 34 survival related mirnas and 194 core survival genes ( figure 2 ). of these survival related mirnas , most regulated fewer core survival genes and five mirnas regulated over 60 core survival genes .
for example , mir - 590 - 3p exhibited a regulatory relationship with 79 glioma core survival genes .
mir - 16 , mir - 206 , and mir - 15a regulated 68 , 67 , and 60 core survival genes , respectively .
among these five hub mirnas , mir - 16 and mir - 15a were found to be dysregulated in glioma [ 42 ] ; moreover , they have performed cooperative regulatory functions in other cancers [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
some genes in this survival module were similarly implicated in the occurrence and development of glioma , such as erbb2 , itgb3 , egfr , and met [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
as illustrated in figure 2 , all genes in the survival module were divided into 13 classes ( 12 pathways and 1 multi - pathway ) according to the kegg pathway classification .
it was shown that some genes derived from multi - pathways , such as the cdc and pdgfr family genes , implying the pathway cross - talk in glioma survival process .
the distribution of survival related mirnas and their regulatory pathways are shown in fig. s2 .
similarly , mir - 16 and mir - 15a regulated over 7 survival related pathways .
some pathways , such as " focal adhesion " , " cell cycle " and " pathways in cancer " , were also regulated by many mirnas. and these pathways , especially focal adhesion , exhibited a close relationship with glioma tumor [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 49 ] .
in a word , the core mirna - gene survival module we identified was implicated in the gliomagenesis process at the mirna , gene and pathway levels .

it was previously proposed that a higher - order structure is frequently observed in an integrated network .
in our core mirna - gene module , some mirnas and genes were also closely connected and formed higher - order sub - modules .
for mining the representative sub - modules as survival signatures for subsequent analysis , we further performed hierachical clustering on the bipartite mirna - gene module .
based on the clustering result and intrinsic regulatory relationships , we identified a total of four sub - modules : modules1 - modules4 , in this study ( fig. s3 ) .
modules3 was located in the center , whereas other three sub - modules were located in the peripheral part .
in content , modules3 contained more hub mirnas and genes as mentioned above .
the mirnas and genes in these four sub - modules are shown in table 2 .

we firstly merged sample - matched mirna and mrna expression profiles after row and column normalization and then performed k - mean clustering ( k = 2 ) to achieve merged expression profiling with four sub - module signatures .
finally , kaplan - meier survival analysis was applied to evaluate the corresponding signature 's prediction effect .
as shown in figure 3 , these four sub - modules were all significantly associated with the survival status of 80 glioma patients in the testing set , with p - value = 0.0013 , 0.0016 , 0.0002 , and 0.0002 , respectively .
moreover , using the raw mirna ( gene ) expression profiles , the corresponding mirna and gene signatures of four sub - modules were also evaluated .
interestingly , all these mirna and gene signatures correlated with glioma patient survival with p - values <= 0.001 , strengthening the clinical prediction value of our sub - module signatures ( table 3 ) .
furthermore , the prediction power of these four sub - modules in patient subgroups ( high - grade glioma patients , n = 49 ) from the testing set were evaluated .
in all four sub - modules , modules3 signature also exhibited strong prediction power for high - grade glioma patients ( module signature , p - value = 0.0062 ; gene signature , p - value = 0.0163 ) .

to test the prediction robustness of module signature , we further performed another survival analysis method based on nearest centroid classification [ 40 ] .
using the expression signature , we performed k - mean clustering on the testing set except one sample to form two groups , one high - risk group and one low - risk group .
then the external sample was assigned to high - risk or low - risk group according to the nearest centroid classification rule .
after all samples were assigned to risk groups , k - m estimate was finally used to evaluate the signature 's prediction power .
as shown in fig. s4 , the modules3 signature also predicted clinical outcome of patients in the testing set ( p - value = 0.0049 ) and the high - grade subgroup ( p - value = 0.0056 ). from the modules3 signature , only a few mirnas and genes were associated with glioma patient survival , suggesting the signature set owned prediction power not individual component ( table s3 ) .
moreover , to test whether our expression signature predicted patient survival independently of other prognostic factors in our cohort , we also performed multivariate analysis ( table s4 ) .
it was shown that all expression signatures predicted outcome independently of other factors such as age , gender and idh1 mutation .
notably , the survival prediction of 26 - gene signature was also independent of patient stage , a known prognostic factor , with p - value = 0.034 .
taken together , the core mirna - gene module was closely related with glioma survival .
especially , one core sub - module ( modules3 ) had strong prediction power for clinical outcome of glioma patients .
revalidation of modules3 signature for survival prediction by glioma independent datasets to further validate the prediction power of modules3 signature , we collected all public glioma expression datasets with available survival information from the geo database [ 23 ] .
according to dobbin and simon [ 50 ] , the number of samples required for testing prognostic signatures was proximately 50 or above for a general expression dataset .
thus , we chose n = 50 as our minimum sample size requirement and four gene expression datasets with corresponding survival information from studies by freije et al .
[ 16 ] , phillips et al .
[ 20 ] , murat et al .
[ 21 ] , and lee et al .
[ 22 ] were obtained .
gene expression signature of modules3 was applied to predict clinical outcome of samples within these datasets .
for two who grade iii and iv datasets ( freije et al. and phillips et al. ) , 26 - gene expression signature exhibited significant prediction power for glioma patients , with p - values < 0.05 ( figure 4a , b ) .
for other two grade iv datasets ( murat et al. and lee et al. ) , the expression signature was also associated with gbm patient survival , with p - values = 0.0463 and 0.111 , respectively ( figure 4c , d ) .
next , we also obtained sample - matched mirna and mrna expression data of gbm from tcga database .
the tcga provided public glioma multi - dimensional expression data similar to our dataset .
then survival analysis based on k - mean clustering were performed on mirnas , genes and modules3 signature .
as shown in fig. s5 , the 26 genes in modules3 exhibited a marginal significant association with gbm survival ( p - value = 0.0663 ) , and could predict the clinical outcome of patients who had the survival time longer than two years ( p - value = 0.019 ) , further strengthening its survival prediction power .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0096908.g004 figure 4 the gene signature from modules3 predicts clinical outcome of glioma datasets from geo .
the glioma datasets were respectively extracted from the studies of ( a ) freije et al. , ( b ) phillips et al. , ( c ) murat et al. , and ( d ) lee et al. .
the significance of clinical outcome difference between the low - risk and high - risk groups was estimated by k - m survival analysis .
p - values were calculated by the log - rank test .
the 26 - gene signature of modules3 exhibited robust power to predict glioma patient clinical outcome in many datasets mentioned above .
we further analyzed the gene signature to determine whether a subset could also be used to predict patient survival .
among the 26 - gene signature , 3 genes ( kdr , pdgfra , and igf1r ) were target genes of survival related mirnas , and 4 genes ( pdgfrb , fzd6 , itgb1 and igf1r ) were most significantly associated with patient survival ( p - values < 0.001 ) .
however , unlike the 26 - gene signature , the corresponding target genes and significant genes in modules3 did not consistently correlate with glioma patient survival in most cases ( data not shown ) .
in addition , we developed an optimization method for the 26 genes ; we first ranked these genes according to their survival significance , and regarded the top n genes ( n from 2 to 25 ) as subset signatures .
as shown in figure 5 , the top 9 genes exhibited the best survival performance .
after other survival verification , the 9 - gene signature also predicted the clinical outcome of glioma patients in the testing set , high - grade subgroup , and three independent datasets .

discussion we systematically analyzed glioma survival by considering joint impact of mirna and gene at the pathway level .
during the analytical process , we put glioma survival related mirnas and genes walking in the pathways to identify glioma core survival genes , and then constructed a glioma mirna - gene module .
following survival verification using the testing set and independent datasets , one core sub - module , especially gene signature included , was shown to be a potential predictor for glioma patient clinical outcome .
in this study , we divided all the glioma samples randomly into a training set and a testing set without significant difference in clinicopathologic features .
the single training - testing partition may not provide the most robust signature results .
so we first permutated partial samples ( n = 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 ) based on original training and testing sets and performed our integrated analytical method to identify glioma mirna - gene module results. and a recurrence ratio was defined to show the ratio of mirnas ( genes ) of our original module that were also identified in the new results .
as shown in fig. s6 , there were strong robust results for glioma mirna - gene module and core sub - module3 , especially the 26 genes in modules3 even when n = 20 .
also , the gene signatures exhibited strong predictive power in clinical outcome of glioma patients from four additional datasets ( figure 5 ) .
to further test the robustness of these expression signatures , we performed another random permutation analysis named shuffle - and - split analysis ; we shuffled all the 160 glioma samples and randomly splitted into two pairs of training and testing sets .
we repeated this process a total of 500 times .
the results showed that the 26 - gene and 9 - gene signatures also had high recurrence ratio , further verifying the robustness of our expression signatures ( fig. s7 ). by integrating sample - matched mirna and gene expression , we identified 14 glioma survival related pathways using the hypergeometric distribution method , which had more advantage for strong significant pathway identification .
among these survival related pathways , " focal adhesion " , " cell cycle " , " pyrimidine metabolism " , " pathways in cancer " , " ecm - receptor interaction " , and " p53 signaling pathway " were all known to be related to the occurrence and metastasis of glioma tumor ( table s2 ) .
notably , cell - matrix adhesion played an essential role in important biological processes , including cell survival , proliferation and motility [ 2 ] .
it has been previously reported that the focal adhesion is associated with glioma tumors , and that adhesion receptors promote glioma cell migration and invasion [ 2 ] , [ 49 ] .
in our core survival module , " focal adhesion " pathway was involved in the modules3 , supporting its sound survival predictive effect .
moreover , some disease pathways , such as " colorectal cancer " and " small cell lung cancer " , were also identified ; thus , there might exist some common biological mechanism or disease genes shared among these diseases and glioma .
in a word , these pathways were of biological importance and pbrw was further developed on them for mining core survival factors .
during the pbrw method to identify glioma core survival genes , we simultaneously considered topology information derived from pathway structure and the joint impact of two levels , mirna and mrna expression .
we regarded the glioma survival related genes and survival related mirna 's targets as seed genes , and equal probabilities were assigned to all seeds in this process .
then a random walker was walking step by step in pathway structure to identify core survival genes , which were drove by survival related mirnas and genes .
the pbrw method accounted for both number and length of multiple paths connecting two nodes in the pathway structure .
furthermore , this method also allowed the algorithm to restart walk at the seed nodes in every iteration , which enabled the choice of a trade - off between the exploitation of local and global pathway structure .
the benefits of random walk algorithm for node scoring have been discussed and are currently utilized for disease - gene prioritization [ 41 ]. from the glioma core mirna - gene module , four representative sub - modules were identified and evaluated using the testing set and independent datasets .
all four module signatures were significantly associated with clinical outcome of patients with grade ii to iv. notably , when applied to high - grade subgroup ( grade iii and iv ) , modules3 also had a prognostic value for glioma patients .
this implied the assumption that a " low grade " glioma like behaviour existed in high - grade tumor which would be associated with better outcome. and in the multivariate analysis with patient stage , the 26 - gene signature was an independent predictor of patient survival with p - value = 0.034 .
as mentioned above , many pathways including focal adhesion were involved in modules3 .
so the integration of multi - pathways might have an implication in discriminating the clinical outcome of high - grade glioma patients. by independent survival verification , our 26 - gene expression signature could predict the clinical outcome for glioma patients from geo and tcga databases .
furthermore , we also performed another survival analysis method [ 40 ] to test the expression signature 's prediction robustness .
in these results , the 26 - gene expression signature was significantly associated with the patient survival in the tcga data set with p - value = 0.018 ( fig. s8 a ) .
for three of four geo data sets , our signature also displayed the prediction power for patient clinical outcome ( p - values < 0.05 ) , showing our expression signature 's robustness in survival prediction .
in this study , we looked at survival across glioma grades to identify robust expression signatures , which displayed prediction power in high - grade and gbm cohorts .
also , the grade - specific differences in gene / mirna expression and survival difference between different grades were still of importance , and will be considered in future study .
it is important to predict therapy responsiveness and to spare certain patients from unnecessary adjuvant therapies that have adverse side effects .
for example , gbm patients with mgmt promoter methylation who were treated with temozolomide had a median survival of 21.7 months .
in contrast , patients without mgmt promoter methylation had a significantly shorter median survival of only 12.7 months [ 51 ] .
thus , we further investigated the relationship between our expression signatures and chemotherapy treatment. of all the datasets analyzed above , only two datasets ( tcga and study of murat et al. ) contained patient treatment information and tcga dataset with adequate samples (> 50 ) could be utilized for further analysis .
temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy drug for glioma clinical treatment .
so we extracted temozolomide - treated samples from tcga dataset and examined the predictive capacity of 26 - gene and 9 - gene signatures for these samples ; two sample groups were formed : high - risk and low - risk groups .
as shown in fig. s9 , there was a significantly different outcome between the two predicted groups , showing that our expression signatures were also prognostic in temozolomide treated patients ( n = 194 ; p - values < 0.05 ) .
moreover , the multivariable analysis showed that these signatures predicted patient survival outcome independently of gender and kps score ( table s4 ) .
we integrated high - throughput mirna , mrna expression , and pathway structure to systematically identify a glioma survival module , among which 26 gene signature was capable of predicting patient clinical outcome .
sample - matched mirna and mrna expression data with patient survival information has recently been developed ; thus , further validation of the expression signature will help strengthen its clinical value .
in the current study , our findings are potentially useful for understanding the gliomagenesis and identifying expression signatures for clinical outcome prediction .

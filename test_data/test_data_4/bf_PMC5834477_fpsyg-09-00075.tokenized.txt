doi : 10.1037 / e533412004 - 001 texture heterophony polyphony homophony musilanguage asynchrony isophony meter the model of musilanguage ( brown , 2000 , 2017 ) requires a new musicological term to refer to its texture .
like choral singing , and unlike speech , musilanguage is based on simultaneous vocalization of multiple participants who reproduce the same signal ( call ) at random time intervals and pitch levels , akin to a wolf " chorus.1 " voiced utterances produce multiple pitches , generating a " jumbled " texture , similar to polyphony and heterophony , but not fully qualifying as such .
the term " heterophony " was introduced by stumpf ( 1897 ) to refer to the fusion of sounds whose components retained their singular identity .
stumpf discovered this word in plato 's laws ( plato , 2013 , p .
203 ) , where it referred to pitch and rhythm discrepancy between the vocals and the lyre performing the same tune .
four years later , stumpf ( 1901 ) reused this term to describe thai music .
he characterized heterophony as the looping of simultaneous melodic paraphrases [ umspielen ] , where parts generally followed the same melodic contour while differing in detail , so that minute discrepancies would meet again in unison .
adler ( 1908 ) conceptualized heterophony as a style alternative to homophony and polyphony , applicable across siamese , japanese , javanese , and russian musics .
he specifically found russian heterophony to present a paradigm of heterophonic arrangement , designed to make melodic repetition less monotonous and more idiosyncratic for each singer 's voice .
the russian musical encyclopedia defines heterophony as a multi - part music generated by the collective performance of the same melody , where parts contain deviations from the principal melodic formula ( mueller , 1973 ) .
such organization is regarded as a general textural type of ornamental , harmonic , and / or polyphonic variation that can complicate classification .
indeed , already in 1911 , stumpf criticized adler for misapplication of the term ( stumpf and david , 2012 ) .
the keynote of heterophony is an ongoing melodic repetition with numerous intermittent variations , which seems to apply to musilanguage chorusing ( brown , 2007 ) .
however , such chorusing contains no synchronization , whereas heterophony implies prevalent synchronization of parts .
swan ( 1943 ) defined heterophony as " a principal melody improvised simultaneously by several singers , retaining its main outline in each voice , yet showing enough independence to result in places in 2 - and 3 - and even 4 - part harmony2. " the grove dictionary ( cooke , 2001 ) , following swan 's definition , emphasizes a collective synchronized execution .
although the notation example provided in the grove article shows a consistent misalignment of 5 parts ( knudsen , 1968 ) , such heterophony is rare and does not sound " jumbled3. " its asynchronicities remain minimal (< half - a - beat ) .
longer asynchronies (>= beat ) generate polyphonic imitations , where the same melody becomes deliberately distributed between multiple parts to produce juxtapositions at certain temporal intervals4 .
polyphony is " a style of simultaneously combining number of parts , each forming an individual melody and harmonizing with each other " ( oxford dictionary ) .
despite its association with western art - music , polyphony penetrated western popular ( bukofzer , 1940 ) and traditional music ( ahmedaja , 2011 ) , prompting research of non - european polyphony ( arom , 2004 ; jordania , 2006 ) .
many ethnomusicologists prefer alternative terms ( diaphony , disphony ) , while others treat " polyphony " as an umbrella term for any multi - part music , setting terminological confusion ( cooke , 2001 ) .
current consensus defines polyphony as " a mode of expression based on simultaneous combination of separate parts , perceived and produced intentionally in their mutual differentiation , in a given formal order " ( agamennone , 1996 ) 5 .
polyphonic and heterophonic textures differ in orderliness : heterophonic parts are inadvertent , unlike polyphonic parts ( tallmadge , 1984 ) .
polyphony induces individualization of parts by means of sharpening their functional contrast in texture .
hence , synchronization is even more important for polyphony - - parts must align in pitch and time throughout the entirety of music .
this makes polyphonic performance metrically stricter than heterophonic performance .
even stricter is synchronization in another " classic " texture - - homophony - - " music in which all melodic parts move together at more or less the same pace " ( hyer , 2001 ) .
contrary to common belief , homophony is not bound to european music alone ( nikolsky , 2016 ) .
its reliance on chords and harmonic intervals demands high concision in tones' onsets : in the order of under 100 msec ( huron , 2001 ) , typically , 30 - 50 msec ( rasch , 1988 ) .
all " classic " textures rely on harmonic , metric , and thematic integrity of parts .
performers attune their performance to the pitch of their partners , the manifestation of beat in their rhythms , and the distribution of musical material across parts - - what musicologists call " thematic material " and consider an expressive point of a musical work by which it can be remembered ( drabkin , 2001 ) .
in this semiotic sense ( reti , 1951 ) , the notion of thematicity is applicable to folk and non - western music ( mazel , 1960 ) .
however , harmonicity , metricity , and thematicity are inadmissible for musilanguage .
even modifying " classic " terms ( e.g. , " jumbled heterophony ") would constitute a misnomer : musilanguage inherently lacks any form of arrangement of parts .
since musilanguage occupies an evolutionary position between the " natural " animal vocalizations and the simplest human oral communication , it predates mode , scale , meter - - and therefore , heterophony and polyphony .
this situation calls for a new term - - isophony : texture that uses brief calls , continuously reproduced by multiple performers with irrational deviations in timing and pitch , where each participant retains idiosyncrasy of the rhythmic , timbral , and directional attributes of the pitch contour - - altogether producing a " jumbled " effect ( nikolsky , 2016 , appendix - 5 ) 6 .
vocalization can be considered " isophonic " if it maintains a single call as a unit of texture , scalable shorter / longer and higher / lower through the continuum of duration and frequency for every participating part - - consistently reproducing that call out - of - sync in relation to the moment of its onset or termination .
isophony contrasts " classic " textures by its tendency to expose each participant 's identity without enmeshing into the ensemble .
isophony involves the assembly of individuals , rather than a single entity (" choir ") .
isophonic tones never meet in unison or in beat , and are devoid of any form of harmonization7 .
isophony 's only feature of tonal organization is the uniformity of the melodic and timbral characteristics of a call .
the function of isophonic texture is to attract attention to each participant 's expression of the same state of mind .
the important features that distinguish isophony from heterophony , polyphony , and homophony are summarized in the table 1 .
table 1 feature comparison of 4 types of musical texture in a multi - part ensemble .
parts heterophony polyphony homophony isophony numerosity from 2 to a few dozen parts - - basically , as many as there are participants .
each part is performed solo , but often merges with other parts to make a tutti unison. from 2 to 3 ( or 4 ) parts .
in western art - music , usually up to 8 ( and rarely up to 40 ) .
a part can be performed by a soloist or a group .
each part is sustained throughout the entire music .
usually from 2 to 5 parts - - to make harmonic intervals or chords : chunks of tones , perceived as a single sonic entity .
a part can be performed by a soloist or a group .
it can cede and / or reappear later in music. from 2 to an unlimited number of parts - - as many as there are participants .
each part is performed solo , and it neither merges nor concords with other parts .
thematicity all parts carry out the same melody ( tune ) - - yet , each with its own melodic details .
the entire music sounds as numerous repetitions of the same theme .
parts can use a single melody ( imitational polyphony ) or multiple melodies ( contrasting polyphony ) , both of which sound continuously changing .
one part carries out the melody against the other parts that form a uniform accompaniment .
the melody usually contains diverse thematic material , but can be repetitive .
all parts reproduce the same call ( phrase ) with variations in timing and pitch .
the overall sound is more cluttered ( less repetitive ) than in heterophony .
synchrony parts are synced at the initiation and termination points of the melodic phrases .
parts are synced all the way from the beginning to the end of the music , in the order of a beat .
parts are synced to make chords and harmonic intervals - - with precision of 30 - 100 milliseconds .
parts are not synced at all - - each part freely proceeds at its own pace .
pitch relation affordances each part can comprise any harmonic interval in relation to another part - - but stays mostly in unison .
each part is restricted to specific harmonic intervals in relation to another part - - mostly non - unison .
each part is restricted to specific harmonic intervals in relation to another part - - mostly 5th , 3rd , 6th , and more seldom - 4th .
each part comprises any interval in relation to another part - - tuned and untuned .
time relation affordances parts stay metrically coordinated , while allowing each part to have its own rhythmic variation and expressive timing ( e.g. , rubato , ritenuto , fermata ) .
parts stay metrically and rhythmically coordinated by means of the metric division system , leaving very limited margins for expressive timing per part .
parts stay metrically and rhythmically coordinated , while letting melody and accompaniment each have their own autonomous rhythmic variation and expressive timing .
parts stay metrically and rhythmically uncoordinated , each with its own variation and expressive timing .
intentionality the relationship between parts is not determined by the performers , but is rather , an emergent property of their attempt to perform the same melody .
the relationship between parts is governed by a complex set of melodic and harmonic rules that constrain the performers in their performance .
the relationship between the accompanying parts and the melodic part is governed by a simpler set of harmonic rules , binding the performers .
the relationship between parts is not consciously controlled by any of the participating performers , but rather emerges purely per chance .
functionality all parts are functionally identical in presenting the same melodic idea , with minute variations in pitch and rhythm .
each part is equal in status to other parts , where they all collaborate to continuously maintain the same expression throughout the music in a rather static way .
imitative polyphony presents a single melodic idea expressed in succession of " call " and " response ," where " call " subdues " response. " contrasting polyphony presents multiple melodies with diverse functions .
all polyphonic parts compete for attention , promoting melodic development .
melodic part presents the principal idea which is usually followed by secondary melodic ideas .
other parts can all carry the same accompanying function , or be specialized ( e.g. , bass , pedal , melodic figuration ) .
parts can switch their functions and regroup - - thereby generating contrast , development , and recapitulation .
all parts contain the same call that is repeated with substantial changes in frequency and duration .
each part is equal in status to other parts in producing an independent expression of the same idea by each performer - - in the manner of reaffirming this idea .
conceptualization of isophony as a primordial texture that predated music , establishes the lineage in the morphological evolution of music , allowing comparative cross - examination of musical structures in multi - part music .

1the sample of a wolf pack howling can be heard at : http :// chirb.it / kflxic .
it is characterized by the reproduction of the same call at various speeds and pitch levels , without any synchronization of the onset and termination points of the calls .
2i have italicized those words in the definition that imply the general coordination in time between the performances of all the participants .
3an example of the hebrides psalm can be heard at : http :// chirb.it / raeaor .
it presents a clear single melodic line that is " smudged " by consistent delays between different parts - - presenting a rare style of melodic variation by means of a deliberate " reverberation " effect induced by the continuous sub - beat time lagging between parts .
4well - known examples of musical texture in monothematic imitational polyphony in folk music are round - songs .
in art - music , bach 's " musical offering " bwv 1079 contains excellent demonstration of polyphonic arrangement of a single melody in the so - called " riddle canons " - - notated as a melody solo ought to be performed by a few musicians who enter one by one in specific time intervals .
5my italics emphasize points that distinguish polyphonic texture from heterophonic .
6this appendix contains an overview of the evolution of musical texture , following the model of " histories of fine art " - - see table 2 ( p. 13 - 16 ) in it .
7an example of isophony is an akia tribe song ( courtesy of anthony seeger ) : http :// chirb.it / ryanbj .
the leader coins the call ( vocable " tete ") , and the tribe repeats it at various pitch levels and duration values , where each participant displays their specific social status through the relative duration of the same call ( seeger , 2004 ) .

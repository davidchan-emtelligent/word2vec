powdered infant formulas ( pif ) are usually not sterile and may frequently be contaminated by several bacteria strains .
among them , cronobacter species , previously known as enterobacter sakazakii , is one of the most harmful , since it might be the causative agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and preterm infants during the first weeks of life .
the mortality rate of these infections is up to 80 % .
therefore , some precautions are required in the home handling and dilution of pif .
whereas there is wide consensus about the need that a pif should be used immediately after being diluted or , if not , stored at < " 5 degreesc " , still recently the optimal temperature of the water used to dilute pif is controversial among scientific societies and health agencies .
the current knowledge is reviewed in this paper and provides sufficient evidence to cautiously advise the use of hot water at a temperature of " 70 degreesc " in the dilution of pif in order to prevent the cronobacter sp. contamination and growth .
keywords formula preparation cronobacter sp. infection home dilution infant sepsis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background the gram - negative cronobacter species ( also known as enterobacter sakazakii ) has been demonstrated to be one of the most frequent causative agent of sepsis and meningitis of the newborn [ 1 ] .
the main route for the neonatal cronobacter sp. infection is by means of the contamination of powdered infant formula ( pif ) [ 2 ] .
contamination prevalence of powdered milk cans has been reported to range from 6.6 % in brazil to 29 % in china [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , the great majority of the cases reported worldwide are from five countries only : usa , uk , france , belgium and philippines [ 5 ] .
although this high rate of pif contamination by cronobacter sp. , in most cases the bacterial load found was low [ 6 ] and the prevalence of neonatal infection resulted small .
in usa , it has been reported 1 case out of 100.000 infants under a year of age , figure that rises to 8.7 among low birth weight infants and further to 9.3 among very low birth weight infants [ 6 ] .
the british health protection agency has reported in the period 1992 - 2002 , only 16 cases of cronobacter sp. positive blood / csf culture among newborn infants (< 1 month of age ) and 20 for those infants aged between 1 and 11 months [ 7 ] .
in the netherlands , cronobacter sp. infections are estimated to represent 0.5 - 2.4 % of foodborne infectious diseases and roughly 0.7 % of the overall meningitis [ 8 ] .
on the contrary , the overall mortality of cronobacter sp. infections is very high , up to 80 % [ 5 ] .
so far , no case of cronobacter sp. infection via powder milk has been reported in italy among the newborns , although citrobacter freundii , a pathogen known to cause diarrhea among infants [ 9 ] and severe neonatal infection [ 10 ] has been isolated in 32 samples of pif out of 75 examined [ 11 ] .
beside cronobacter sp. , other bacteria could contaminate pif. between 1985 and 2005 at least 6 outbreaks of salmonellosis , involving as many as 250 infants , have been associated with contaminated pif [ 12 ] .
moreover , clostridium botulinum type b was isolated from an opened container of a pif can from the home of a 5 - months - old infant with confirmed botulism , and from an unopened container of the same batch obtained prior to distribution and retail sale .
the pif consumed by the patient was from a batch in the meantime recalled by the manufacturer [ 13 ] .
the contamination of pif by cronobacter sp. is a global issue and an area of dispute , because it is n't clear in which phase of pif production and storage the contamination can occur .
moreover , cronobacter sp. has been isolated with varying frequency in production environments from food ( milk powder , chocolate , cereal , potato , and pasta ) factories and households , strongly indicating that it is widespread [ 14 ] .
it is usually agreed that cronobacter sp. is relatively thermo resistant , so it can survive after pasteurization [ 15 ] and that contamination by cronobacter sp. could occur during the reconstitution procedures of pif .
recommendations on home preparation of pif in order to prevent cronobacter sp. infections a clear consensus on the recommendation for home preparation of pif is lacking and several contradictory guidelines aimed at pif contamination are available .
the u.s. food and drug administration gives the following advice [ 16 ] : " standards for manufacturers of infant formula [ omissis ] include : current good manufacturing practices specifically designed for infant formula , including required testing for the harmful pathogens [ disease - causing bacteria ] salmonella and cronobacter .
[ omissis ] in most cases , it 's safe to mix formula using ordinary cold tap water that 's brought to a boil and then boiled for one minute and cooled. " the former advice " according to the world health organization , recent studies suggest that mixing pif with water at a temperature of at least " 70 degreesc " - - " 158 degreesf " - - creates a high probability that the formula will not contain the bacterium enterobacter s .
- - a rare cause of bloodstream and central nervous system infections ," is no longer indicated .
more in depth , the u.s. center for disease control [ 17 ] concluded that : " cronobacter bacteria can cause severe blood infections or meningitis .
infants of 2 months of age and younger are most likely to develop meningitis if they are infected with cronobacter bacteria .
infants born prematurely and those with weakened immune systems are also at increased risk for serious cronobacter infections .
[ omissis ] in some outbreak investigations , cronobacter bacteria were found in pif that had been contaminated in the factory .
in other cases , cronobacter bacteria might have contaminated the pif after it was opened at home or elsewhere during preparation .
[ omissis ] manufacturers report that , using current methods , it is not possible to eliminate all germs from pif in the factory .
pif can also be contaminated after the containers are opened .
very young infants , infants born prematurely , and infants with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk .
[ omissis ] if your baby gets formula , choose infant formula sold in liquid form , especially when your baby is a newborn or very young .
liquid formulations of infant formula are made to be sterile and should not transmit cronobacter infection .
[ omissis ] if your baby gets pif , there are things you can do to protect your baby from infections - not just cronobacter infections .
good hygiene , mixing the formula with water hot enough to kill germs , and safely storing formula can prevent growth of cronobacter bacteria and other germs .
these are keys to keeping your baby safe and healthy .
[ omissis ] use hot water ( 158 degreesf / 70 degreesc and above ) to make formula .
[ omissis ] use formula within 2 h of preparation .
if the baby does not finish the entire bottle of formula , discard the unused formula .
if you do not plan to use the prepared formula right away , refrigerate it immediately and use it within 24 h. the position of the british national health system is quite similar to the previous ones [ 18 ] : " use freshly boiled drinking water from the tap to make up a feed .
do n't use artificially softened water or water that has been boiled before .
leave the water to cool in the kettle for no more than 30 min .
this will ensure it stays at a temperature of at least 70 c. water at this temperature will kill any harmful bacteria. " the european food safety agency recognizes the compelling evidence that consumer categories vulnerable to enterobacter s. are premature and low birth weight infants and those aged < 28 days [ 19 ] .
nevertheless , no clear recommendation is provided about the appropriate temperature for pif home dilution in order to prevent cronobacter sp. infections [ 20 ] .
the european commission has not dealt with this topic in the regulation 1169 / 2011 on labeling of the foodstuff .
the european society of pediatric gastroenterology , hepatology and nutrition does not consider necessary the use of water with a temperature > 70 degreesc for the dilution of pif .
in fact , the main concern of the espghan experts is that the hot water may inactivate the vitamins and kill the probiotic strains contained in the formula [ 21 ] .
since powdered milk - borne cronobacter sp. infections have not been reported in italy so far , the italian ministry of health has not been urged to express an official position on this topic .
as well , the italian society of pediatrics and the italian society of neonatology do not have official positions on this issue .
conclusions there is a wide consensus on who / fao guidelines concerning the need that pif should be used immediately after being diluted or , if not , stored at < " 5 degreesc " [ 22 ] .
notwithstanding the current controversies on the home dilution of pif , current scientific evidence suggests a precautionary approach .
we therefore believe that it is advisable the use of " 70 degreesc " warm water for the dilution of pif , especially for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants .
in our opinion , it is not worthy performing a routinary analysis of the eventual presence of cronobacter sp. in pif neither in neonatal intensive care units nor at home , since the use of water at " 70 degreesc " for the dilution is efficient in preventing with high probability , the presence and the growth of live strains of cronobacter sp. in the meantime , baby food industry is challenged to reduce the level of cronobacter sp. contamination of pif , also experimenting new technologies able to inactivate the cronobacter sp. while limiting the disruption of vitamins and other important nutrients .
researchers are investigating methods to improve the microbiological safety of pif , via the inclusion of protectants or alternative methods to lower or eliminate microbiological contamination [ 23 ] .
among the most promising , bioactive peptides , organic acids , probiotics and prebiotics should be cited [ 23 , 24 ] .
supercritical cabon dioxide , gamma irradiation , exposure to microwaves or to a combination of uv and near infrared radiation heating are some among the possible alternative physical methods [ 23 , 25 ] .
eventually , all these new technologies , though promising , still need further investigation on safety , reproducibility and cost / benefit ratio issues , before becoming standard procedures .

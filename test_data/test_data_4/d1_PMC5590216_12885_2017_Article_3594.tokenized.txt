background evidence from clinical trial populations suggests low - dose aspirin reduces the risk of colorectal cancer ( crc ) .
part of this reduction in risk might be due to protection against metastatic disease .
methods we investigated the risk of crc among new - users of low - dose aspirin ( 75 - 300 mg ) , including risk by stage at diagnosis .
using the health improvement network , we conducted a cohort study with nested case - control analysis .
two cohorts ( n = 170,336 each ) aged 40 - 89 years from 2000 to 2009 and free of cancer were identified : i ) new - users of low - dose aspirin , ii ) non - users of low - dose aspirin , at start of follow - up , matched by age , sex and previous primary care practitioner visits .
patients were followed for up to 12 years to identify incident crc .
10,000 frequency - matched controls were selected by incidence density sampling where the odds ratio is an unbiased estimator of the incidence rate ratio ( rr ) .
rrs with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated .
low - dose aspirin use was classified ' as - treated ' independent from baseline exposure status to account for changes in exposure during follow - up. results current users of low - dose aspirin ( use on the index date or in the previous 90 days ) had a significantly reduced risk of crc , rr 0.66 ( 95 % ci 0.60 - 0.74 ) .
the reduction in risk was apparent across all age groups , and was unrelated to dose , indication , gender , crc location or case - fatality status .
reduced risks occurred throughout treatment duration and with all low - dose aspirin doses .
rrs by aspirin indication were 0.71 ( 0.63 - 0.79 ) and 0.60 ( 0.53 - 0.68 ) for primary and secondary cardiovascular protection , respectively .
among cases with staging information ( n = 1421 ) , rrs for current use of low - dose aspirin were 0.94 ( 0.66 - 1.33 ) for dukes stage a crc , 0.54 ( 0.42 - 0.68 ) for dukes b , 0.71 ( 0.56 - 0.91 ) for dukes c , and 0.60 ( 0.48 - 0.74 ) for dukes d. after 5 years' therapy , the rr for dukes stage a crc was 0.53 ( 0.24 - 1.19 ) .
conclusions patients starting low - dose aspirin therapy have a reduced risk of stages b - d crc , suggesting a role for low - dose aspirin in the progression of established crc ; a substantial reduction in the risk of dukes a crc may occur after 5 years' therapy .

keywords colorectal cancer aspirin nested case - control studies chemoprevention diagnosis bayer agissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide , with more than 1.3 million new cases reported in 2012 [ 1 ] .
long - term ( up to 20 years ) follow - up of cardiovascular trials have demonstrated , in post hoc analyses , that patients randomized to daily low - dose aspirin ( 75 - 300 mg ) have a reduced risk of crc incidence and mortality after a delay of several years [ 2 ] .
the hypothesis that aspirin has a chemopreventive effect early in the adenoma sequence in crc development is consistent with this latency period , and is supported by findings from randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) showing daily low - dose aspirin ( 81 - 325 mg ) reduces colorectal adenoma recurrence in average / high - risk populations [ 3 ] .
in early cardiovascular trials , the protective effect of low - dose aspirin against crc was greatest in patients with longer scheduled duration of trial treatment [ 2 ] .
however , analyses were limited based on unknown aspirin exposure during the post - trial follow - up period , and inability to adjust for confounders .
patients who discontinued aspirin in the intervention arm or started treatment in the placebo arm after the randomized phase would have been analyzed according to exposure status at randomization , thus the protective effect of aspirin could have been mainly due to chronic aspirin exposure over the relatively short in - trial period .
recent analyses of in - trial data show that aspirin substantially reduces metastatic crc at initial diagnosis [ 4 ] , which cannot be accounted for by an effect early in the adenoma - carcinoma sequence .
observational data suggest aspirin may reduce the risk of metastatic breast [ 5 ] and prostate [ 6 ] cancer at initial presentation , and reduced mortality has been reported for crc [ 7 ] and breast cancer [ 8 ] with aspirin use following diagnosis .
aspirin may therefore have an inhibitory effect on the growth and spread of tumours as well as on their initial development , and this effect could be explored further in real - world patients by the evaluation of low - dose aspirin on the risk of different stage crc in clinical practice .
methods using a uk primary care database of electronic medical records ( emrs ) , we carried out a cohort study with nested case - control analysis to evaluate the association between use of low - dose aspirin and risk of incident crc , both overall and by aspirin dose , duration of use and indication .
we also aimed to assess the overall association between low - dose aspirin and crc risk by crc stage at diagnosis , site and case - fatality status , as well as among patients with or without previous bowel investigations ( colonoscopy / sigmoidoscopy ) .
we hypothesized that the strength of association between low - dose aspirin and crc would vary by dukes stage at diagnosis .
an independent scientific review committee for thin ( reference number 12 - 044 v ) approved the study protocol .
data source we used the health improvement network ( thin ) database , which contains computerized primary care data for ~ 6 % of the uk population [ 9 ] and is demographically representative of the uk population as a whole [ 10 ] .
clinical data are entered as part of routine patient care using read codes [ 11 ] , although further details can be added as free text , and prescriptions are automatically recorded upon issue .
further details about the database are described elsewhere .
[ 12 , 13 ] at the time the study was carried out , approximately one fifth of practices contributing to thin were linked to hospital episode statistics ( hes ) [ 14 ] , thus information from secondary care could be obtained for individuals in these practices .
source population and identification of the two study cohorts the source population included individuals in thin aged between 40 and 84 years from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2009 who met the following data quality and completeness standards : at least 2 years of registration with the general practice , a minimum of 1 year since the beginning of computerized prescription history , and a minimum of one health encounter in the previous 3 years .
individuals with a prescription for low - dose aspirin or a diagnosis of cancer any time before the study entry were excluded. from within the source population we identified all new - users of low - dose aspirin ( n = 170,336 ) and matched each one to an individual still free of low - dose aspirin on that day ( 1:1 matching ) .
matching criteria were age , sex and pcp visits in the previous year ( as a proxy for general health / comorbidity and as an attempt to control for differences between users and non - users of aspirin at the start of follow - up that are otherwise difficult to control ) .
details on the identification of the two cohorts can be found in additional file 1 ) .
the matching date was set as the start date ( start of follow - up ) for the identification of incident crc cases .
crc case identification and validation both study cohorts were followed - up from the start date until a read code suggestive of crc ( see additional file 2 ) , a recorded diagnosis of another cancer , age 90 years , death , or end of the study period ( 31 december 2011 ; fig. 1 ) , whichever came first .
the maximum duration of follow - up was therefore 12 years .
a total of 3805 individuals had a crc read code during follow - up , and had their emrs ( with free text comments ) manually reviewed while masked to aspirin exposure [ 13 ] .
patients were deemed incident cases unless there was evidence from the patient record suggesting otherwise ; for example , a prevalent case , an uncertain diagnosis following biopsy results , or presence of a second primary cancer either concurrently or previously .
information relating to the crc diagnosis was extracted , including ( where available ) details on crc type ( colon or rectum ) , stage ( available in the free - text comments only ) , surgery related to the event , adjuvant therapy treatment , and procedures involved in the diagnosis ( e.g. colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy ) .
the index date was the earliest of the following : the date of the first crc - related symptom , the date of screening / diagnostic procedure , or the date of surgery .
in cases where the index date was unclear ( for instance , when patients presented several times to their pcp with non - specific symptoms ) , an external gastroenterologist was consulted to ascertain the most likely index date .
in the majority of crc cases ( 83 %) , the index date was backdated from the date of the recorded crc diagnosis ; the mean number of backdated days was 56.6 and the median was 36.0 .
two external data sources were used to validate the incident crc cases ascertained in thin following the manual review process : 1 ) questionnaires sent to pcps ( for a random sample of 100 cases ) , and 2 ) hes data for individuals in linked practices .
findings from the validation process have been published previously [ 13 ]. fig. 1 flowchart depicting the nested case - control study design .
crc , colorectal cancer ; pcp , primary care practitioner control selection ten thousand controls were randomly sampled and frequency - matched to crc cases by age , sex , and year of the index date .
incidence density sampling was used where the likelihood of being selected as a control was proportional to the individual 's person - time at risk .
all eligibility criteria applied to cases were also applied to controls .
statistical analysis nested case - control analysis was carried out using cases and controls arising from the two cohorts to evaluate the association between low - dose aspirin use and other potential risk factors ( see additional file 1 for further details ) , and crc .
odds ratios ( ors ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. by using incidence density sampling , the or is an unbiased estimator of the incidence rate ratio ( rr ) [ 15 ] .
drug treatment was categorised as follows : current use , use on the index date or in the previous 90 days ; recent / past use , use >= 91 days before the index date ; and non - use , when there was no prescription any time prior to the index date .
using these definitions of actual aspirin use in relation to the index date , rather than aspirin exposure determined solely at the start of follow - up , enabled us to account for changes in individuals' low - dose aspirin exposure over time , which could happen with a long follow - up period such as in this study .
any member of either study cohort could have used low - dose aspirin at or before the index date , not just those designated to the low - dose aspirin cohort at the start of follow - up. for example , a member of the non - user cohort may have initiated use of the drug during follow - up and vice versa ) .
although low - dose aspirin can be obtained over - the - counter ( otc ) in the uk , access to healthcare is straightforward and prescriptions are free for individuals aged >= 60 years , which is the age range of the patient population that most commonly uses low - dose aspirin - a factor likely to encourage prescription .
furthermore , our previous validation study in thin showed the impact of potential misclassification of low - dose aspirin in the database owing to unrecorded otc aspirin use would be minimal [ 16 ] .
in addition , as part of another study using the clinical practice research datalink ( cprd ; a similar database to thin ) , nearly all chronic low - dose aspirin use was via prescription [ 17 ] .
duration of therapy was calculated for current low - dose aspirin users by totalling the individual lengths of all consecutive prescriptions with treatment gaps greater than 90 days considered genuine breaks in therapy .
stratified and sub - group analyses were performed and interaction terms were used to test for potential effect modification by age , sex and crc stage at diagnosis .
sensitivity analyses were carried out restricting to crc cases with known crc stage .
analyses were undertaken with stata version 12.0 .
results descriptive findings characteristics of both study cohorts at the start of follow - up are presented in table 1 .
new users of low - dose aspirin at the start of follow - up had a higher frequency of comorbidities , smokers , and overweight individuals .
similar proportions of patients between the two cohorts had a previous record of a colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy or a gastrointestinal polyp .
over a mean follow - up of 5.32 years ( 95 % ci : 5.31 - 5.33 ) , 3303 incident cases of crc were identified after manual review of patient 's emrs .
clinical features of the malignancies are shown in additional file 3 . among those with recorded staging ( n = 1421 ) , about one third ( 34.9 %) were dukes stage d , and a quarter ( 26.0 %) were dukes stage c. the mean age of cases was 68 years and 59 % were male .
time to crc occurrence was similar across dukes stages ( see additional file 4 ) .
approximately 80 % ( n = 2433 ) of crc cases were still alive at 1 - year post index date ( non - fatal cases ) , of which 48 % were male .
overall , 54 % of cases were still alive at 5 years ; 87 % of dukes stage a cases , and 78 % , 57 % , 9 % and 57 % of dukes stages b , c , d and unknown stage cases , respectively .
cases with or without recorded staging were similar in terms of demographics , recorded symptoms and diagnostic investigations ( see additional files 5 and 6 ) .
greater use of health care contacts ( hospitalizations , referrals and pcp visits ) in the year prior to the index date , former smoking and higher alcohol consumption were significant predictors of crc , while none of the comorbidities evaluated showed a clear association with crc ( table 2 ) .

reference group for all comorbidities was not having the respective condition low - dose aspirin use and risk of crc associations between use of low - dose aspirin and risk of crc are presented in table 3 .
current low - dose aspirin users had a 34 % statistically significant decreased risk of crc , rr 0.66 ( 95 % ci : 0.60 - 0.73 ) .
a decreased risk of crc was observed with all aspirin doses evaluated - 75 , 150 or 300 mg / day - although the latter dose was not statistically significant , with no dose - response relationship observed within this range .
among cases and controls , approximately two - thirds of all current low - dose aspirin use was of at least 1 - year duration .
a reduction in crc risk was seen throughout treatment duration , with a constant 40 % reduction after the first year .
associations between current use of low - dose aspirin and crc by subpopulation ( age , gender , low - dose aspirin indication , prior gastrointestinal antecedents and prior colonoscopy / sigmoidoscopy / gastrointestinal adenoma ) as well as by features of the cancer ( dukes 's stage , type [ colon or rectum ] , location and fatality ) are shown in fig. 2 ) .
low - dose aspirin was associated with a 40 % statistically significant reduced risk of crc when used for secondary cvd prevention and approximately a 30 % reduced risk when used for primary cvd prevention ( fig. 2 ) .
a 30 - 40 % significant protective effect was seen for both fatal and non - fatal cases , for colon or rectal crc , for both men and women , and across all age groups .

results restricting our analysis to only crc cases with recorded stage are shown in additional file 8 .
in the 1 - year lag - time analysis ( using all cases irrespective of whether crc stage was recorded or not recorded ; see additional file 9 ) , current users of low - dose aspirin had an rr of 0.82 ( 95 % ci : 0.74 - 0.92 ) with the risk estimate lower with more than 5 years' treatment duration , rr : 0.72 ( 95 % ci : 0.58 - 0.89 ) .
discussion patients starting treatment with low - dose aspirin had a significant 34 % decreased risk of developing crc compared with those not taking low - dose aspirin , in line with previous findings of a chemopreventive effect of aspirin against crc [ 2 , 4 , 18 , 19 ] .
the reduction in risk was apparent across all age groups , and was unrelated to dose , indication , gender , crc location or case - fatality status .
we also found an effect of low - dose aspirin among patients who started therapy after having previously undergone colonoscopy / sigmoidoscopy .
the protective effect was observed in dukes stages b to d crc , occurring throughout treatment duration and starting within the first year of therapy , while a suggestion of a reduced risk of dukes stage a crc was observed but only after 5 years' therapy .
to our knowledge , our study is the first to investigate the effect of low - dose aspirin on risk of crc by stage at diagnosis among real - world patients in clinical practice .
a key strength of our study is the original observational study design , which attempted to minimize bias between aspirin users and non - users at start of follow - up that are difficult to control. by obtaining incident cases of crc for our case - control analysis from two cohorts of patients - new users of low - dose aspirin and non - users of low - dose aspirin at start of follow - up - matched by factors including a proxy for general health status , we attempted to control for this possible selection bias .
this would not have been achieved from a traditional nested case - control study design in the whole thin source population , following up the single cohort to identify cases of crc. by then analyzing low - dose aspirin in our case - control analysis in relation to the index date ( i.e. current use , never use etc ) , we evaluated actual use of low - dose aspirin ( assuming the patient took the medication ) rather than use of low - dose aspirin defined at start of follow - up , which could have changed substantially over time .
other study strengths include the representativeness of the data source to the uk population , the long study period , and the inclusion of a broad range of patients , including those with gastrointestinal disorders .
lag - time and stratified analyses showed the associations to be robust and to occur across patient groups .
all incident crc cases were identified following thorough review of emrs , previous validation of the crc diagnosis of nearly 20 % of our cases using record linkage to hospitalization data , and through pcp questionnaires for a smaller sample , resulting in high confirmation rates [ 13 ] .
any potential differential misclassification of crc cases between low - dose aspirin users and non - users , for instance diagnostic bias arising from more frequent investigation and referral of aspirin users , would have underestimated the associations found .
although information on dukes stage was unavailable for 53 % of cases , the distribution of dukes stage in cases with a recorded stage is largely consistent with national data [ 20 , 21 ] supporting their representativeness to cases in the general population .
furthermore , 1 - and 5 - year survival rates for all cases are consistent with national rates [ 22 ]. through sensitivity analysis restricted to crc cases with known stage , we showed the associations to be robust .
misclassification of aspirin exposure owing to unrecorded otc aspirin in thin was likely to have been minimal , as shown in our previous validation study of low - dose aspirin recording in thin [ 16 ] and other populations [ 23 ] .
it is unlikely that our findings can be explained by healthy - user bias because we found the new users of low - dose aspirin cohort to be less healthy in terms of comorbidities and lifestyle factors than the matched ( at start of follow - up ) cohort .
in fact , any residual lack of adjustment for the more severe co - morbidity profile of new low - dose aspirin users would have led to an underestimation of the protective effect seen .
furthermore , in another study using a similar design but where the non - user at start of follow - up cohort instead comprised new users of a ' neutral ' drug - paracetamol - we report highly similar results [ 24 ] .
also , in this current study , we matched our two study cohorts by number of pcp visits as a proxy for general health / comorbidity .
we controlled for several confounders in our analyses , and the level of missing data for smoking and body mass index was low with risk estimates virtually similar when these variables were ascertained before the start of follow - up ( data not presented ) .
although data on certain crc risk factors such as red meat intake and a positive family history and were not recorded ; these are unlikely to be related to aspirin exposure and confound the associations observed .
residual confounding , however , cannot be ruled out .
in addition , because the mean length of low - dose aspirin use was 6 years , we were unable to investigate the effect of low - dose aspirin when used in the longer - term .
our findings support an effect of low - dose aspirin on at least two phases of the natural history of crc .
the early and large reduction in risk seen among patients presenting with dukes stage d crc is consistent with previous clinical trial data [ 4 ] .
experimental evidence exists to suggest that platelets play an important role in metastasis [ 25 , 26 ] .
pharmacological inhibition of thromboxane synthase in animal models has been shown to significantly inhibit tumour cell growth , invasion , metastasis and angiogenesis [ 27 ] .
the short - term effect of aspirin on advanced stage crc seen in our study supports the hypothesis that aspirin has an effect on the progression of established tumours - a clinically important finding because of the poor prognosis of patients presenting with advanced stage disease .
five - year survival for dukes stage d crc cases in our study was 9 % , in line with previous reports [ 20 ] .
at least 5 years' therapy with low - dose aspirin was necessary to observe a reduction in risk of dukes a crc , a latency period consistent with the average time for an early stage carcinoma to evolve from an adenomatous polyp [ 28 ] .
this adds supports for an effect of aspirin early in the adenoma - carcinoma sequence [ 3 ] .
biologically plausible mechanisms that could mediate an effect of aspirin against crc development have been postulated , also involving platelet inhibition [ 29 ] .
co - incubation of activated human platelets with crc cells has been shown to upregulate cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) expression and induce epithelial - mesenchymal transition [ 30 ] .
induction of cox - 2 expression in adjacent nucleated cells could thereby trigger a chain of downstream events affecting cell proliferation , apoptosis and angiogenesis .
at low - doses ( 75 - 100 mg daily ) , aspirin permanently inactivates the enzyme cyclooxygenase 1 in platelets , leading to long - lasting suppression of thromboxane a2 production .
for dukes stages b to d crc , we did not observe the latency period for an effect of low - dose aspirin as seen in post - hoc analyses of trial data [ 2 , 18 ]. and interestingly , in a recent analysis of data from the women 's health initiative [ 31 ] use of statins - medication also reported as having anti - cancer properties [ 32 ] - was found to be associated with a significant reduction in crc mortality .
there are several possible reasons why we were able to identify cases earlier during follow - up than previous aspirin trials .
firstly , our study was designed to investigate crc as the clinical endpoint , and information on low - dose aspirin use throughout the whole follow - up was ascertained and analyzed .
secondly , our study did not screen - out patients with peptic ulcer disorders or other disease - related eligibility criteria , and some of these patients may have had preclinical crc , already along the lengthy adenoma - carcinoma sequence at start of follow - up. thirdly , our study population included real - world patients , which included those with multiple comorbidities ; the average age of patients at start of follow - up was 64 years in our study compared with 61 in four previous low - dose aspirin trials [ 2 ] .
fourthly , follow - up began between 2000 and 2009 , considerably later than the start of several trials that began in early / mid 1980s .
irrespective of the age and health of the study population , there have been temporal changes in the management of crc , including the availability of better diagnostic techniques , the introduction of multidisciplinary teams in secondary care , the national bowel cancer screening programme , bowel cancer awareness initiatives / increased media attention , and accessibility to information .
in line with trial data [ 2 ] , we found an aspirin dose of 75 mg / day to be effective in reducing crc .
no increased benefit was seen with up to four - fold higher aspirin doses , although our study was underpowered to reliably evaluate these exposures with around 90 % of current low - dose aspirin use at 75 mg / day .
nevertheless , this is an important finding considering that doses of less than 100 mg are sufficient to reduce the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events , and the dose - dependent increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [ 33 ] .
the benefits of low - dose aspirin in reducing ischaemic vascular events [ 34 ] must be weighed against the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding , which increases with age and when aspirin is prescribed alongside other gastrotoxic agents [ 33 ] .
prevention strategies to minimize aspirin - associated gastrointestinal problems , such as use of proton pump inhibitors , have conferred an acceptable safety profile for low - dose aspirin use in the general population and thereby the potential for use in crc prophylaxis .
recently , the u.s. preventive services task force issued a draft recommendation statement advocating long - term use of low - dose aspirin for primary prevention of crc and cvd among adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10 % or greater 10 - year cvd risk and who are not at increased risk of bleeding [ 35 ] .
for comparable adults aged 60 to 69 years , the task force recommends the decision to take low - dose aspirin for primary crc and cvd prevention should be made on an individual basis .
a quantification of the gastrointestinal safety profile of low - dose aspirin in our patient population is warranted to make a valid benefit / risk evaluation in crc prevention .
there is also a need for our results for crc stage to be verified in other large , population - based , observational studies .
the potential for low - dose aspirin to be used post - diagnosis as adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence and prolong survival is another promising research question and is currently being assessed in the ongoing placebo - controlled add - aspirin trial [ 36 ] .
conclusions our results indicate that patients starting low - dose aspirin therapy have a reduced risk of stages b - d crc suggesting a role for low - dose aspirin in the progression of established crc .
when used in the long - term ( 5 years or more ) , low - dose aspirin may also substantially reduce the risk of dukes a crc .

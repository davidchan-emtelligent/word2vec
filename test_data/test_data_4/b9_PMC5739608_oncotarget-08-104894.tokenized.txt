triple negative breast cancers ( tnbc ) have poor prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes and represent 15 - 20 % of breast cancers diagnosed .
unique targets and new molecularly - targeted therapies are urgently needed for this subtype .
despite high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor , inhibitors such as lapatinib have not shown therapeutic efficacy in tnbc patients .
herein , we report that treatment with the covalent jnk inhibitor , jnk - in - 8 , synergizes with lapatinib to cause cell death , while these compounds as single agents have little effect .
the combination significantly increases survival of mice bearing xenografts of mda - mb - 231 human tnbc cells .
our studies demonstrate that lapatinib treatment increases c - jun and jnk phosphorylation indicating a mechanism of resistance .
combined , these compounds significantly reduce transcriptional activity of nuclear factor kappa b , activating protein 1 , and nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor 2 .
as master regulators of antioxidant response , their decreased activity induces a 10 - fold increase in reactive oxygen species that is cytotoxic , and is rescued by addition of exogenous antioxidants .
over expression of p65 or nrf2 also significantly rescues viability during jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib treatment .
further studies combining jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib may reveal a benefit for patients with tnbc , fulfilling a critical medical need .
triple negative breast cancer lapatinib jnk oxidative stress antioxidant introduction triple negative breast cancers ( tnbc ) represent 15 - 20 % of all breast cancers diagnosed in the u.s .
[ 1 , 2 ] .
this tumor type ( encompassing basal - like - 1 and - 2 , immunomodulatory , mesenchymal , mesenchymal stem - like , luminal androgen receptor or unspecified ) has very high rates of tumor recurrence and poor prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes [ 3 - 6 ] .
treatment of these tumors is difficult due to a lack of targetable receptors such as estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor ( her ) 2 , and although tnbcs initially respond well to chemotherapy , they exhibit high relapse rates [ 7 , 8 ] .
in light of the shortcomings of chemotherapy , the discovery of potent , molecularly - targeted therapies for tnbc is of great interest and urgently needed .
many tnbcs overexpress egfr ( her1 ) , whose expression level correlates with poor prognosis [ 9 ] , however , clinical trials testing egfr inhibitors indicate that they are ineffective as single agents [ 10 , 11 ] .
using the egfr inhibitor gefitinib , immunohistochemical ( ihc ) analysis of tumors showed that while egfr phosphorylation was inhibited , phospho - akt and ki67 remained high [ 10 ] .
lapatinib , despite inhibiting both egfr and her2 , also lacks efficacy in treating tnbc [ 12 ] , and only minimally inhibits proliferation of tnbc cell lines [ 13 ] .
while resistance mechanisms have been reported for anti - egfr / her2 therapies in her2 - overexpressing breast cancer [ 14 , 15 ] and other cancers [ 16 , 17 ] , the reason for the lack of efficacy of egfr and egfr / her2 inhibitors in tnbc remains unknown .
recent studies have shown that lapatinib induces cytotoxic oxidative stress in cells sensitive to egfr / her2 inhibition [ 18 ] , and another group reversed lapatinib resistance with the addition of a reactive oxygen species ( ros ) - inducing compound [ 19 ] .
in tumors that are innately resistant to egfr / her2 blockade , such as tnbc , it is unknown how lapatinib might affect oxidative stress levels .
as breast and other cancers are more sensitive to increased oxidative stress than normal tissues , compounds that would promote cytotoxic levels of ros in tumors are currently being explored [ 20 , 21 ] .
downstream of her signaling , c - jun n - terminal kinases ( jnks ) convey responses from her stimuli , and also merge signaling from other growth factor receptors , inflammatory cytokines , and other extracellular stress stimuli [ 22 - 25 ] .
in breast cancer , phosphorylated jnk significantly correlates with egfr expression , positivity for cytokeratins , and the triple negative phenotype [ 26 ] .
downstream of jnk , increased phosphorylation of c - jun at jnk specific sites correlates with increased invasiveness and angiogenesis [ 27 ] , as well as with distant metastasis and the presence of her family receptors [ 28 ] .
isoform specific functions of jnk have been described .
jnk2 correlates with decreased disease - free survival in breast cancer patients diagnosed with the basal - like subtype [ 29 ] , increases epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ 30 ] , and jnk2 knockdown reduces lung metastasis of mammary cancer cells [ 24 ] .
jnk1 specifically functions in insulin response [ 31 ] , epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ 32 ] , and regulation of certain tumor suppressors [ 33 ] .
these data indicate that inhibition of jnk activity may be beneficial to the treatment of tnbc as well as invasive breast cancer .
to improve upon poorly selective , competitive jnk inhibitors , irreversible inhibitors of jnk were recently developed. of these , jnk - in - 8 was found to be the most selective with high affinity for all three jnk isoforms .
jnk - in - 8 covalently binds cys116 in the catalytic sites of both jnk1 and jnk2 and potently inhibits phosphorylation of c - jun at ser63 in cells [ 34 ] .
this compound is far more selective for jnk than sp600125 which is frequently used to study jnk functions [ 35 ] .
herein , we show that jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergistically decrease cell viability in human tnbc cell lines by promoting apoptosis .
similar results are seen in human xenograft tumors wherein the combination of lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 significantly lengthens the time to reach maximum tumor growth .
the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa b ( nfkappab ) , activating protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) , and nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) in cells are significantly decreased by combination treatment with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , and oxidative stress is dramatically increased .
addition of ros scavengers rescues cell death and blocks accumulation of reactive oxygen species resulting from exposure to lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 combination .
overexpression of the rela subunit of nfkappab or nrf2 also significantly rescues viability after the combination treatment .
these data indicate that lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 synergize to inhibit an antioxidant response leading to cytotoxic accumulation of oxidative stress .
results jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergize to cause tnbc cell death to determine the effectiveness of jnk - in - 8 in human tnbc cell lines , we tested its ability to inhibit egf - induced jnk activity using the mda - mb - 231 cell line .
jnk phosphorylated c - jun shortly after egf stimulation , peaking around 8 hours ( figure 1a ) .
jnk - in - 8 at 1mum reduced c - jun phosphorylation by 60 % and 55 % after 30 or 60 minutes of egf stimulation , respectively .
jnk - in - 8 at 5mum , inhibited phosphorylated c - jun by 80 % and 55 % after 30 and 60 minutes of egf stimulation ( figure 1b ) .
figure 1 jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergize to cause cell death in triple - negative breast cancer cell lines ( a ) mda - mb - 231 cells were serum - starved overnight and lysed ( 0hr ) or stimulated with egf for 1 , 8 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours .
western blots of serine 63 phosphorylated c - jun are shown with band densitometries beneath .
( b ) mda - mb - 231 cells were pre - treated for 3 hours with vehicle , 1mum , or 5mum jnk - in - 8 ( jin ) and then stimulated (+) with egf for 30 or 60 minutes as indicated .
western blots of phospho - c - jun ( ser63 ) are shown with band densitometries beneath .

mda - mb - 231 : jin 5mum , lap 3mum .
mda - mb - 436 : jin 4mum , lap 7mum .
hcc1569 : 3mum jin , 1mum lap .
( e ) mice were injected orthotopically with mda - mb - 231cells and treated with vehicle , 25mg / kg jnk - in - 8 and / or 75mg / kg lapatinib .
time to maximum tumor size was recorded for each group starting at the time of the first treatment and presented as a kaplan - meier curve .
jnk - in - 8 covalently binds jnk1 and jnk2 at cysteine 116 [ 34 ] .
to address whether jnk - in - 8 requires the cysteine residue to bind and inhibit jnk1 or jnk2 , hek293 - t cells were used to overexpress wildtype ( wt ) or cys116ser mutant ( mut ) jnk1 and jnk2 plasmids .
consistent with the requirement for cysteine 116 for jnk - in - 8 binding and inhibition , expression of both mut jnk plasmids rescues c - jun phosphorylation in jnk - in - 8 alone and jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination samples compared to cells expressing the wt plasmids ( supplementary figure 1a ) .
both wt and mut jnk isoforms were flag tagged and could be detected separately from endogenous jnk using a flag directed antibody .
western blots show that in cells where wt plasmids were overexpressed , presence of jnk - in - 8 results in a slightly higher mobility shift in both jnk isoforms due to covalent binding with the compound .
this mobility shift is not seen in cells transfected with mut jnk plasmids , showing that jnk - in - 8 cannot covalently bind with jnk1 or jnk2 harboring the cys116ser mutation .
the " parental " lane contains lysate from un - transfected hek293t cells and serves as a negative control for the flag antibody ( supplementary figure 1a ) .
expression of the mut jnk plasmids also increased c - jun phosphorylation in cells treated with the jnk - in - 8 and / or lapatinib compared to cells transfected with wt jnk plasmids ( supplementary figure 1a ) .
due to data demonstrating jnk activation by egfr / her2 signaling [ 24 , 29 ] ( figure 1a , 1b ) , we hypothesized that resistance to lapatinib in tnbcs may be due to elevated jnk activity following lapatinib treatment [ 36 ] .
indeed , overexpression of wt jnk1 and jnk2 in the hek293 - t cells significantly increased viability after lapatinib treatment ( supplementary figure 1b ) .
to determine if jnk - in - 8 sensitizes breast cancer cell lines to lapatinib , cell viability was measured in the presence of either vehicle alone , jnk - in - 8 alone , lapatinib alone , or jnk - in - 8 with lapatinib .
various concentrations of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib were tested for additive or synergistic effects in tnbc cell lines .
ranges of values tested for jnk - in - 8 were between 0.1mum and 20mum , based on the observed inhibition of c - jun phosphorylation at 5mum ( figure 1b ) .
lapatinib concentrations were based on published ic50 values for cell lines : 5 - 10mum for mda - mb - 231 [ 13 , 37 ] and 3mum for hcc1569 [ 38 ] .
the ic50 for the mda - mb - 436 cell line was presumed to be similar to mda - mb - 231 cells .
for figure 1c , blue circles represent a different combination of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib concentrations .
combination indexes ( cis ) less than one ( the y - axis center ) are synergistic , cis equaling one are additive , and cis greater than one are antagonistic [ 39 , 40 ] .
for all three cell lines , the combination of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergistically decreased cell viability , especially at combinations causing greater than 50 % effect .
cell confluence was measured over time using phase contrast microscopy , also confirming that the jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination decreases cell proliferation or increases cytotoxicity greater than vehicle or either compound alone ( supplementary figure 1c ) .
a single set of synergistic concentrations that resulted in a ~ 70 % reduction in viability ( effect ) was chosen for subsequent apoptosis studies .
in figure 1d , graphs represent percentages of early and late apoptotic cells after 48 hours of treatment for mda - mb - 231 and hcc1569 cells , and 72 hours of treatment for mda - mb - 436 cells .
for all cell lines , apoptosis was significantly higher with combination treatment than with control or either compound alone , indicating that the synergistic effect is due , at least in part , to apoptosis .
bright field pictures of mda - mb - 231 cells after 72 hours of treatment confirm the presence of rounded , apoptotic cells exhibiting membrane blebs ( supplementary figure 1d ) .
to test the in vivo efficacy of combining jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , nude female mice were injected orthotopically with human mda - mb - 231 cells .
once tumors reached an average volume of 80mm3 , treatment with vehicle , jnk - in - 8 ( 25mg / kg ) , lapatinib ( 75mg / kg ) , or jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination began .
tumor growth was assessed using a kaplan - meier curve measuring time to the attainment of maximal tumor size ( figure 1e ) .
median time to maximum tumor growth for each group occurred at 15 days ( vehicle ) , 15 days ( jin ) , 12 days ( lap ) , and 21.5 days ( j + l ) .
using a log rank ( mantel cox ) test , the vehicle , lapatinib , and jnk - in - 8 treatment curves were all found to be shorter than the combination of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib ( p = 0.0248 , p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0507 , respectively ) .
vehicle , lapatinib , and jnk - in - 8 alone were all significantly inferior to the combination treatment using the gehan - breslow - wilcoxon test ( p = 0.0290 , p = 0.0019 , and p = 0.0190 , respectively ) , implying greater synergy during earlier stages of tumor growth .
the tumor from one mouse in the combination group did not reach maximum size by the end of the experiment at day 30 .
jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergize largely through targeting jnk1 and her2 , respectively to interrogate the specificity of lapatinib in tnbc cells , we first tested for synergy between jnk - in - 8 and other egfr or egfr / her2 inhibitors .
mda - mb - 231 cells were treated with three concentrations of the reversible egfr inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib based on published ic50 values for breast cancer cell lines [ 41 - 44 ] in combination with 5mum jnk - in - 8 .
the egfr / her2 covalent inhibitor neratinib [ 45 ] was also used .
for almost all of the concentrations tested , jnk - in - 8 was synergistic with these compounds in decreasing cell viability as shown by cis less than one ( figure 2a ) .
the ability of jnk - in - 8 to synergize with each of these inhibitors supports the notion that egfr and her2 are critical targets of this response , and that lapatinib 's synergy with jnk - in - 8 is not due to an off - target effect .
figure 2 her2 and jnk1 are necessary for maximum synergy between jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib ( a ) mda - mb - 231 cells were treated with 5mum jnk - in - 8 ( jin ) and / or 1 , 5 , and 10mum gefitinib ( gef ) , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0mum neratinib ( ner ) , or 1 , 5 , and 10mum erlotinib ( erl ) .

the non - specific band ( denoted by the asterisk "*") in the her2 blot was included in densitometry calculation due to its close proximity to her2 .

mtt values were used to calculate synergy using compusyn software .

( e ) mda - md - 231 cells stably expressing either shnc , shjnk1 , shjnk2 , or shjnk1 and shjnk2 were lysed for western blot .
their relative densitometries to shnc for jnk1 and jnk2 expression are shown .
( f ) cell lines with indicated shrna plasmids were treated with dmso or j + l for 72 hours .
cell viability was assayed using mtt and bars represent relative viability compared to vehicle .
the " triple - negative " designation of tnbc refers to a lack of her2 overexpression , not a complete lack of expression [ 46 ] , as our laboratory ( figure 2b ) and others [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] have shown .
to decipher whether egfr or her2 is more important for synergy between jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , we stably knocked down egfr or her2 expression in mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 2b ) .
compound knockdown of both receptors could not be achieved due to lethality caused by the loss of both receptors .
these cells were treated with vehicle or the combination of 3mum lapatinib and 5mum jnk - in - 8 for 72 hours in full media .
despite frequently elevated egfr expression in tnbcs , figure 2c suggests that inhibition of egfr is not necessary for significant synergy between jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , as its knockdown does not rescue cells from combination treatment - induced cell death .
in contrast , shher2 cells were significantly more resistant to the jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination , supporting the notion that her2 is a critical target of lapatinib for synergy with jnk - in - 8 ( figure 2c ) .
the lack of total viability rescue could indicate some level of off - target effects , which occur frequently with pharmacologic inhibitors of kinases , and may occur more easily when the preferred targets of the inhibitors are in low abundance .
however , figure 2a would support the notion that lapatinib is acting specifically , and lack of total rescue is likely due to residual her2 expression .
to explore the unexpected conclusion that her2 is the key target of lapatinib for its synergy with jnk - in - 8 , we tested whether the combination also synergizes in her2 - amplified cells .
using the sk - br - 3 cell line [ 49 ] , we observed that jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergistically inhibited cell viability ( figure 2d ) .
these data agree with the conclusion that her2 inhibition by lapatinib is more important for jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergy than egfr inhibition .
we then used a similar approach to evaluate the importance of jnk1 or jnk2 inhibition in sensitizing tnbc cells to lapatinib .
using lentiviral transduction to stably knockdown expression , we obtained 95 % and 90 % inhibition of jnk1 and jnk2 expression , respectively .
compound jnk1 and jnk2 knockdown was less efficient .
the highest achievable double knockdown was approximately 76 % of jnk1 with 85 % of jnk2 ( figure 2e ) .
jnk1 knockdown , and to a lesser extent compound jnk1 and jnk2 knockdown , significantly rescued cell viability when treated with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination .
knockdown of jnk2 alone had no effect on synergy ( figure 2f ) .
this indicates that inhibition of jnk1 is necessary for full synergy between jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , and that the level of jnk1 knockdown directly correlates with the level of rescue .
full rescue was not observed in any of the jnk knockdown experiments , suggesting that even very low jnk expression / activity enhances the effect of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib .
the result that jnk1 inhibition by jnk - in - 8 is important for synergy with lapatinib is not surprising considering that jnk - in - 8 was shown to have greater activity toward purified , recombinant jnk1 in vitro [ 34 ] .
the activity of jnk - in - 8 was explored in cell lines produced from spontaneous mammary tumors in jnk1 - / - or jnk2 - / - mice [ 50 ] in order to determine whether jnk - in - 8 has greater activity toward jnk1 within a cellular context .
we determined that inhibition of jnk1 and jnk2 by jnk - in - 8 was approximately equivalent in regards to decreased phosphorylation of c - jun at the jnk specific , serine 63 site .
however , phosphorylation of jnk2 was inhibited by about 80 % after jnk - in - 8 treatment , while phospho - jnk1 was only inhibited by about 20 % ( supplementary figure 2a ) .
this indicates that the inhibition of endogenous jnk1 by jnk - in - 8 is not greater than inhibition of jnk2 .
overall , these results lead us to conclude that the effect seen after jnk1 knockdown in figure 2f is not due to a stronger effect on jnk1 by jnk - in - 8 , but rather highlights the specific importance of jnk1 in the context of lapatinib treatment .
lapatinib treatment activates jnk , but decreases ap - 1 activity although egf activates jnk activity as in figure 1a , lapatinib increased nuclear localization of phosphorylated jnk after 72 hours of treatment in full media ( figure 3a , " lap " inset ) .
these data suggest that intrinsic lapatinib resistance of tnbc cell lines involves jnk activation during lapatinib exposure .
figure 3 lapatinib affects jnk and ap - 1 signaling ( a ) immunofluorescence of mda - mb - 231 cells treated with vehicle ( dmso ) , 5mum jnk - in - 8 ( jin ) , and / or 3mum lapatinib ( lap ) for 72 hours .
cells were stained with phospho - jnk ( thr183 / tyr185 )( red ) and nuclei were counterstained with dapi ( blue ) .
( b ) mda - mb - 231 cells were serum - starved overnight and pre - treated with 3mum lapatinib or dmso for 3 hours .
after that time , cells were lysed ( 0hr ) or stimulated with egf for 1 , 8 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours .
western blots of phospho - egfr ( tyr1173 ) , egfr , phospho - cjun ( ser63 ) , cjun , and vinculin are shown with band densitometries beneath .
( c ) mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with an ap - 1 luciferase reporter plasmid .
cells were treated for the indicated time points with vehicle ( dmso ) , 5mum jin and / or 3mum lap .
the bar graph represents ap - 1 transcriptional activity at 48 hours .
lapatinib , in line with increasing jnk phosphorylation ( figure 3a ) , increases nuclear c - jun ( supplementary figure 3a ) .
these events were observed in full serum .
experiments using egf in serum free media showed a similar result where lapatinib inhibited phospho - c - jun ( s63 ) at early time points ( figure 3b ) , consistent with jnk being downstream of egfr / her2 signaling , however , at later time points c - jun phosphorylation was increased similarly to phospho - jnk in figure 3a .
compensatory signaling in breast cancer cells is frequently attributed to resistance mechanisms to kinase inhibitors including lapatinib [ 14 , 51 - 53 ] .
together , these data imply that other factors compensate for lost jnk and c - jun activation after exposure to lapatinib , consistent with our hypothesis that jnk signaling may confer resistance to lapatinib .
ap - 1 activity , which is regulated by c - jun and various other transcription factors [ 54 - 56 ] was evaluated as a potential downstream response to lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 treatment .
in the mda - mb - 231 cells , ap - 1 - driven luciferase activity decreased significantly after lapatinib treatment , however , treatment with both compounds maximally inhibited ap - 1 activity even at early time points ( figure 3c ) .
these results implicate the regulation of ap - 1 transcription factors other than c - jun by egfr / her2 , such as fos family members [ 57 - 59 ] , whose inhibition leads to an overall decrease in ap - 1 activity .
jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib cause accumulation of cytotoxic oxidative stress cells sensitive to egfr / her2 inhibition exhibit increased oxidative stress after lapatinib treatment [ 18 ] , so we examined whether jnk inhibition might restore this mechanism of cell death .
indeed , elevated ros were noted beginning at 36 hours and exhibited a 10 - fold increase by 72 hours after treatment with the jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination ( figure 4a ) .
notably , neither compound alone increased ros levels .
this finding indicates that either egfr / her2 or jnk sustains an oxidative balance while the other is inhibited .
figure 4 jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib cause cell death by increasing reactive oxygen species ( a ) mda - mb - 231 cells were treated with either vehicle ( dmso ) , 3mum jnk - in - 8 ( jin ) and / or 5mum lapatinib ( lap ) .
ros levels were assayed using 2 ' , 7 ' - dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( dcdfa ) .
increased fluorescence indicates increased ros .
( b ) bar graph representing amount of ros by dcdfa at 72 hours after treatment .
5mm nac was used for ros quenching .
( c ) mda - mb - 231 and ( d ) mda - mb - 436 cells were treated with dmso , 3mum jin and / or 5mum lap , or jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib ( j + l ) with 5mm nac , 500 u / ml catalase ( cat ) , 100mug / ml ascorbic acid ( ascacid ) , or 100mum mntbap for 72 hours in full media .
bar graphs represent viability by mtt assay .
( e ) nac was either added at the same time as j + l ( nac at 0hr ) , 24 hours after j + l ( nac at 24hr ) , or 48 hours and after j + l ( nac at 48hr ) .
cell viability at 72 hours after addition of j + l was assayed using mtt .
to determine whether elevated ros is merely a consequence of apoptosis , cells were treated with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib in addition to various ros scavenging molecules : n - acetyl cysteine ( nac ) , ascorbic acid , catalase , and manganese ( iii ) tetrakis ( 4 - benzoic acid ) porphyrin ( mntbap ) ( a super oxide dismutase ( sod ) mimetic ) .
these compounds represent major cellular defenses against oxidative stress : glutathione , sod1 / 2 and peroxyredoxin [ 60 ] .
treatment of mda - mb - 231 cells with nac , the precursor for glutathione , for 72 hours in the presence of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib completely abrogated ros accumulation ( figure 4b ) , and rescued cell viability ( figure 4c , 4d ) .
ascorbic acid also significantly rescued cell viability , although not nearly to the degree that nac did , whereas catalase was ineffective .
mntbap also rescued viability in the presence of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib ( figure 4c ) .
similar results were achieved with the mda - md - 436 cell line ( figure 4d ) .
these results indicate that elevated oxidative stress after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib treatment causes apoptosis .
the timing of nac addition was important to the degree of protection in the mda - mb - 231 cells .
nac added at the same time as jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib resulted in complete protection , whereas addition of nac after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib resulted in diminishing rescue ( figure 4e ) .
noticeably , there was no significant change from untreated controls when cells were treated with nac 24 hours after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib , but about a 50 % drop - off in rescue resulted when cells were treated with nac 48 hours after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib .
nevertheless , jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination rescue was still significant at this time point ( figure 4e ) .
this corresponds with the ros time course showing that ros become elevated between 24 and 48 hours after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib treatment in the mda - mb - 231 cells .
to show that ros scavengers are not simply sequestering jnk - in - 8 or lapatinib in the medium ( or vice versa ) , we repeated viability assays with the compounds washed out prior to nac treatment .
under these conditions , nac significantly rescued the viability of mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 436 cells pre - treated with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib compared to full media alone ( supplementary figure 4a ) .
these data support that nac rescues cells from oxidative cellular injury and death imposed by lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 .
elevated oxidative stress is associated with a decreased antioxidant response nfkappab can promote an antioxidant response through regulation of genes such as ferritin heavy chain ( fhc ) , mn - sod ( sod2 ) , and sod1 [ 61 - 65 ] , as well as genes that are necessary for glutathione biosynthesis [ 66 ] .
the transcription factor nrf2 binds the antioxidant response element ( are ) to increase transcription of genes necessary for the production and regeneration of thioredoxin , glutathione , peroxiredoxin , and nadph [ 67 - 72 ] .
together with ap - 1 , these transcription factors are major regulators of the antioxidant response with each controlling targets that eliminate cytotoxic ros from the cell [ 60 ]. from 12 to 48 hours of treatment , jnk - in - 8 , lapatinib , and the combination all significantly inhibit nfkappab transcriptional activity in mda - mb - 231 cells .
values are less than half that of vehicle - treated cells for jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib alone , and negligible for the combination treatment ( figure 5a ) .
in mda - mb - 436 cells , jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib have less effect alone , but nfkappab transcriptional activity is again strongly inhibited by the combination treatment ( figure 5a ). by western blot analysis , treatment with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib did not significantly decrease the expression of p65 or p50 subunits of the canonical nfkappab pathway ( figure 5b ) .
however , phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 , an activating phospho site of p65 , was significantly decreased by the combination treatment .
in addition , inhibitor of kappa b ( ikappab ) kinase ( ikk ) alpha and beta expression were consistently decreased with combination treatment ( figure 5b ) suggesting that decreased ikappab dissociation from nfkappab in addition to a decrease in activating phosphorylation may be lowering nfkappab transcriptional activity .
figure 5 jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib decrease important antioxidants ( a ) cells were treated with 5mum jnk - in - 8 ( jin ) and / or 3mum lapatinib ( lap ) for mda - mb - 231 cells , and 4mum jin and / or 7mum lap for mda - mb - 436 cells for various time points .
cells were also transfected with nfkappab luciferase reporter plasmids .
line graph points represent normalized luciferase values from 3 technical replicates .
( b ) mda - mb - 231 cells were treated with either vehicle ( dmso ) , 5mum jin and / or 3mum lap for 48 hours in full media .
whole cell lysates were probed for phospho - p65 ( ser536 ) , p65 , p50 , ikkbeta , and ikkalpha .
( c ) mda - mb - 231 cells were treated with 5mum jin and / or 3mum lap for various time points and transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the nqo1 promoter containing nrf2 / antioxidant response elements ( are ) .
line graph points represent normalized luciferase values from 3 technical replicates .
( d ) relative levels of glutathione were measured in mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 436 cells after 72 hours of treatment in dmso , jin , lap , or jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib ( j + l ) .
( e ) levels of nadp + and nadph were measured in mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 436 cells after 72 hours of treatment in dmso , jin , lap , or j + l .
( f ) mda - mb - 231 cells were non - transfected , transfected with empty vector ( ev ) , or expression plasmids for p65 ( p65 oe ) and nrf2 ( nrf2 oe ) .
twenty four hours after transfection cells were treated with either vehicle ( dmso ) , 5mum jin and / or 3mum lap for 72 hours in full media .
cell viability was assayed using mts .
we also investigated the transcriptional activity at the nad ( p ) h dehydrogenase quinone 1 ( nqo1 ) promoter ( containing ares ) which is positively regulated by the nrf2 transcription factor [ 71 , 72 ] .
similar to nfkappab , significant decreases are seen in as little as 6 hours with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination in mda - mb - 231 cells. by 48 hours , both jnk - in - 8 alone and jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination significantly decreased nrf2 transcriptional activity through the are ( figure 5c ) .
to determine what biological effects reduced nfkappab and nrf2 signaling may have on the antioxidant response , we quantified relative amounts of glutathione ( figure 5d ) and nadp +/ nadph ( figure 5e ) using luciferase - based assays , and quantified thioredoxin and heme oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) levels by western blot ( supplementary figure 5a , 5b ) .
total levels of glutathione decreased significantly in jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination - treated cells compared to vehicle in mda - mb - 231 cells .
in mda - mb - 436 cells , both lapatinib alone and jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination significantly reduce glutathione .
nadph , necessary for the reduction of glutathione and thioredoxin [ 73 ] , also declined in a similar pattern ( figure 5e ) .
total levels of thioredoxin remained unchanged by treatment ( supplementary figure 5a ) , and ho - 1 ( supplementary figure 5b ) differences were not consistent .
this indicates that expression of some nrf2 targets persists , however not enough to control accumulation of ros .
the necessity of nfkappab and nrf2 expression in controlling oxidative stress after jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination is evident in figure 5f .
overexpression of p65 or nrf2 ( supplementary figure 5c ) each significantly rescue cell viability of mda - mb - 231 cells being treated with jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination compared to cells expressing an empty plasmid ( figure 5f ) .
data are shown relative to each group 's vehicle treatment , revealing that transfected cells do not respond as well to the combination treatment .
this is likely due to overall lower viability in transfected cells compared to untransfected cells ( data not shown ) .
while the rescue is significant , it does not reach the level of viability of cells treated with vehicle , possibly indicating the need for rescue of nfkappab and nrf2 in combination to fully combat the effects of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib .
together , these data support that lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 inhibit signaling pathways integral for cancer cell survival during oxidative stress , namely nfkappab and nrf2 , leading to glutathione depletion .
consistent with this finding is that repletion of glutathione , using nac supplementation , rescues cell viability .
in addition , decreased levels of nadph would inhibit the reduction of oxidized glutathione and thioredoxin , preventing the recycling of these important antioxidants .
discussion neither egfr nor egfr / her2 inhibitors alone show efficacy in tnbc despite relatively high egfr expression .
presented in this work , we established a possible therapeutic benefit for the combination of lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 in the treatment of tnbc .
jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergize to cause apoptosis in three cell line models of tnbc : mda - mb - 231 ( expressing mutant braf and kras ) , mda - mb - 436 ( expressing mutant brca - 1 and rb - 1 ) , and hcc1569 ( expressing mutant pten ) [ 48 , 74 - 76 ] , as well as the her2 - amplified sk - br - 3 cells [ 77 ] .
cell line specific findings are summarized in supplementary table 1 .
these are the first studies to show that dual blockade of jnk and egfr / her2 , through jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib treatment , cooperate to synergistically decrease cell viability by elevating oxidative stress .
cancer cells tolerate high levels of ros by upregulating antioxidants [ 78 - 80 ] .
elevated nfkappab , ap - 1 , and nrf2 in cancer cells contribute to their antioxidant response [ 60 , 72 , 81 ] .
their targets that participate in the antioxidant response include sulfiredoxin , genes for glutathione and thioredoxin biosynthesis , and mn - sod [ 60 , 66 , 81 - 83 ] .
in addition to its antioxidant targets , ap - 1 can enhance the transcriptional activity of nfkappab through various mechanisms [ 84 - 87 ] , and it can enhance nrf2 activity as ap - 1 consensus sequences often lie within ares [ 82 ] .
therefore , decreased ap - 1 , nfkappab , and nrf2 transcriptional activities following jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib combination treatment may jointly lower cellular antioxidant response .
while it was noted that jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib alone were capable of inhibiting multiple targets , it is important to observe that some targets are decreased more by jnk - in - 8 than lapatinib and vice versa .
this led us to conclude that it is the combination of these changes that causes an overall decrease in antioxidant response and apoptosis .
this mechanism is strongly supported by figure 5a showing that only the combination of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib increased overall oxidative stress while the single compounds had no effect .
this indicates that signaling through egfr / her2 and jnk compensate for one another in the induction of proper antioxidant responses , highlighting the necessity for the combination of both compounds over single agent treatment .
the proposed mechanism is summarized in figure 6 .
figure 6 proposed mechanism of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib synergy lapatinib and jnk - in - 8 jointly inhibit the transcriptional activities of ap - 1 , nfkappab , and nrf2 .
this disrupts the cell 's natural antioxidant response resulting in accumulation of ros leading to apoptosis. with regard to further improving the in vivo efficacy of this combination , the doses of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib used in the tumor xenograft experiment were very well tolerated and could be increased .
further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of jnk - in - 8 will be needed to assess the ideal dose , vehicle , and administration route .
however , we are encouraged by the data observed where the combination of jnk - in - 8 and lapatinib significantly slows tumor growth in mice compared to those treated with vehicle or single agents alone .
consistent with our hypothesis that jnk conveys intrinsic or acquired resistance to lapatinib , jnk - in - 8 was recently used to overcome resistance to a braf inhibitor in melanoma cells [ 36 ] .
this highlights the importance of jnk as a regulator of multiple signaling pathways , and its attractiveness as a " druggable " target in cancer .
these studies are the first to report the benefit of inhibiting jnk in combination with lapatinib. with further testing , this combination may be a viable option to treat patients with aggressive tnbc , whose lack of molecularly - targeted therapies represents an urgent and unmet medical need .
furthermore , testing of this combination in tumor types that are more sensitive to oxidative stress should reveal an even greater clinical impact , and jnk - in - 8 may synergize with other growth factor receptor - targeted therapeutics .

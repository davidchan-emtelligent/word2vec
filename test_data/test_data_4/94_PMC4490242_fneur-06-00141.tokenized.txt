rationale we recently reported on the efficacy of a personalized transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) treatment in reducing multiple sclerosis ( ms ) fatigue .
the result supports the notion that interventions targeted at modifying abnormal excitability within the sensorimotor network could represent valid non - pharmacological treatments .
objective the present work aimed at assessing whether the mentioned intervention also induces changes in the excitability of sensorimotor cortical areas .
method two separate groups of fatigued ms patients were given a 5 - day tdcs treatments targeting , respectively , the whole body somatosensory areas ( s1wb ) and the hand sensorimotor areas ( sm1hand ) .
the study had a double blind , sham - controlled , randomized , cross - over ( real vs. sham ) design .
before and after each treatment , we measured fatigue levels ( by the modified fatigue impact scale , mfis ) , motor evoked potentials ( meps ) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials ( seps ) in response to median nerve stimulation .
we took meps and seps as measures of the excitability of the primary motor area ( m1 ) and the primary somatosensory area ( s1 ) , respectively .
results the real s1wb treatment produced a 27 % reduction of the mfis baseline level , while the sm1hand treatment showed no difference between real and sham stimulations .
m1 excitability increased on average 6 % of the baseline in the s1wb group and 40 % in the sm1hand group .
observed sep changes were not significant and we found no association between m1 excitability changes and mfis decrease .
conclusion the tdcs treatment was more effective against ms fatigue when the electrode was focused on the bilateral whole body somatosensory area .
changes in s1 and m1 excitability did not correlate with symptoms amelioration .
significance the neuromodulation treatment that proved effective against ms fatigue induced only minor variations of the motor cortex excitability , not enough to explain the beneficial effects of the intervention .

2010sh7h3f " functional connectivity and neuroplasticity in physiological and pathological aging [ connage ]" pnr - cnr aging program 2012 - 2016 introduction fatigue is defined as " a feeling of insufficient physical and / or mental energies interfering with the usual and desired activities " ( 1 ) .
it is a common and highly disabling symptom in patients affected by multiple sclerosis ( ms ) even when other symptoms remain mild ( 2 ) .
involvement of the motor control system in ms fatigue to date , there is no clear evidence pointing at a single factor causing ms fatigue and fatigue complaints appear completely unrelated to both clinical variables , such as type of ms , level of disability , or disease duration , and demographic ones , such as age , gender , and education level ( 3 ) .
although peripheral conditions , such as muscle weakness , may play a role , there are clear indications that much of ms fatigue has a central origin , most likely being the consequence of a failing central motor transmission to spinal alpha motor neurons ( 4 ) .
tdcs treatment targeting " whole body s1 " vs. " hand sm1 " a few years ago , cogiamanian obtained an increase of endurance against fatigue in healthy subjects by submitting them to a transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) ( 5 ) .
recently , we applied cogiamanian 's treatment to fatigued ms patients ( 6 ) obtaining a significant amelioration of their symptoms .
in the present study , we tested two variations of cogiamanian 's protocol on two distinct subgroups of fatigued ms patients .
we submitted the first subgroup to cogiamanian 's same treatment only replacing the original mono - hemispheric with a bihemispheric stimulation ( we will call this treatment sm1hand ) .
it is known that fatigued ms patients show a much higher excitability of their primary motor area ( m1 ) than non - fatigued patients and healthy subjects .
this phenomenon has been attributed to a failure of intracortical inhibition ( ici ) in frontal and m1 areas , both before and after fatiguing exercises ( 4 ) .
furthermore , structural and functional data report a parietal involvement in ms fatigue symptoms ( 7 - 9 ) , with indications of a reduced primary somatosensory area ( s1 ) excitability ( 10 , 11 ) , and tdcs has been reported to enhance parieto - frontal projections ( 12 ) .
also , in previous works of ours , we noticed signs of impaired communication between s1 and m1 ( 13 ) .
consequently , on the base of the above considerations , for the second subgroup , we modified cogiamanian 's treatment to selectively direct our neuromodulation on bihemispheric whole body s1 , avoiding further direct enhancement of m1 excitability ( 14 ) .
cogiamanian and coworkers assessed fatigue in hand movements and stimulated the hand section of sm1 representation ( 5 ) .
we considered that in ms patients , the lower limbs are also primarily involved and there are no reasons to limit neuromodulation to only the section of s1 devoted to hand representation .
thus , we treated the second subgroup with a tdcs on bilateral whole body s1 ( we will call this treatment s1wb ) .
aim within this theoretical frame , our present aim was to test whether a tdcs treatment , which decreases ms fatigue , induces changes in brain excitability .
in particular , we intended to quantify the effects induced within m1 via transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) - evoked motor evoked potentials ( meps ) ( 15 ) and in s1 via median nerve ( mn ) evoked somatosensory evoked potentials ( seps ) .
materials and methods the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the " s. giovanni calibita " fatebenefratelli hospital in rome and by ethics committee of universita degli studi di milano , fondazione irccs ospedale maggiore policlinico , mangiagalli e regina elena .
study design both our studies ( s1wb and sm1hand treatments ) followed a double blind , sham - controlled , randomized , cross - over design ( sham / real , real / sham ) .
patient remained blind to whether they would receive a real or a sham treatment .
patients were asked to fill out the modified fatigue impact scale ( mfis ) form to score their level of fatigue .
we will refer to the week before the first tdcs treatment as t0 ( baseline ) and to at least 4 h after the last tdcs treatment as t1 .
we collected electroencephalographic ( eeg ) and tms sessions and mfis scores at t0 and t1 .
sample size estimate we calculated the sample size using the repeatability of mfis scores before neuromodulation treatments started .
in 10 individuals with mild ms , we collected mfis twice , 1 week apart .
the average mfis pre - post score difference was 0.1 +/ - 1.9 , and the intra - class correlation indicated a very high agreement ( icc = 0.96 ; p < 0.001 ) .
according to our previous study ( 6 ) , the variability of changes after stimulation was quite larger ( 21.1 % after real , 16.9 % after sham ) .
in order to assume the " worst " yet more realistic scenario , we did not lean on homoscedasticity and assumed both such variability values , distinguishing real and sham variances of pre - post - stimulation changes .
in tecchio et al .
( 6 ) , we observed a 27 % improvement after real and 7 % improvement after sham treatment .
to recognize as significant ( alpha level = 0.05 ) , a 20 % difference between real and sham treatments , a sample size of 10 cases will provide a power of 90 % .
notably , biomedical literature considers a 25 % improvement ( ere expected for real stimulation ) as a suitable threshold of clinical relevance ( 16 ) and here would correspond to a decrease of 12 mfis points for a severely fatigued patient with 48 at baseline .
participants we recruited 21 relapsing - remitting ( rr ) ms patients ( 17 ) experiencing fatigue [ physical items mfis score > 15 , ref. ( 18 )] .
inclusion criteria were as follows : mild physical disability [ expanded disability status scale , edds ( 19 ) cut - off score of <= 3 ] , absence of depression ( no pharmacological treatment ) , absence of clinical relapse , or radiological evidence of disease activity over the last 3 months .
exclusion criteria were as follows : use of symptomatic drugs , which may affect the level of fatigue , depression , and anxiety within the past 3 months ( 20 ) , epilepsy or other central / peripheral nervous system comorbidities and any systemic conditions , which may cause fatigue ( e.g. , anemia and pregnancy ) .
all patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) for exclusion criteria assessment .
in addition , a detailed clinical history was collected including active disease modifying therapy ( dmt ) , disease duration , annual relapse rate , and depression level ( beck depression inventory , bdi ) .
fine hand motor control was evaluated by nine hole peg test ( 9hpt ) scores collected separately for left and right sides .
mri exam and measure estimate image acquisition in each patient undergoing s1wb treatment , brain imaging was performed by an achieva 1.5 - t scanner ( philips medical systems , best , the netherlands ) , with 33 mt / m gradients , online 2d / 3d geometric distortion correction , and an 8 - channels head phased - array coil with parallel imaging capabilities ( sense ) .
all sequences were acquired with contiguous slices and full brain coverage .
exclusion criteria ( no active lesions ) were assessed based on t1 - spin echo images before and 5 min after intravenous injection of a contrast agent .
lesions estimates were based on t2 dual echo images ( see : column 2 of attachment 2 ) and 3d - flair ( see : column 4 of attachment 2 ) .
t1 - 3d fast field echo sequences with full brain coverage ( mprage , tr / te / fa = 8.6 ms / 4 ms / 8degrees ; 170 contiguous sagittal slices 1.2 mm thick without gap , mtx1922 ) were used for the 3d reconstruction of the brain structure in order to personalize the tdcs electrode .
image post - processing computations lesion load a semi - automated region of interest ( roi ) approach was used to trace hyperintense lesions in the white matter ( wm ) on t2 - weighted images , following strategies previously described [ ref .
( 11 ) ; jim 5.0 , xinapse systems ltd. , leicester , uk , attachment 3 ] .
rois were identified by consensus of two investigators ( giancarlo zito and d. lupoi ) blind to patients' clinical data .
the total lesion volume ( tlv ) was computed .
lesion relative fraction ( lrf ) was computed as the ratio of the tlv over the wm volume in order to normalize for inter - subject head volume variability .
whole body s1 personalized electrode shaping and positioning personalized electrode shaping a few days before the experimental session , each subject underwent a structural brain mri exam with a 1.5 - t scanner ( achieva , philips medical systems , best , netherlands ; mprage contiguous sagittal slices with full brain coverage ) .
mri data were elaborated with softaxic neuronavigation system ver .
2.0 ( www.softaxic.com , e.m.s. , bologna , italy ) , which delivered the volumetric reconstruction of the individual brains and the cortical folders .
the stereotaxic procedure for the personalization of each electrode included the following steps [ figure 1 ; ( 14 )] : ( 1 ) the line of the central sulcus shown by the navigator is manually transferred onto a paper sheet firmly fixed onto the patient 's scalp ; ( 2 ) on paper , 2 cm - long segments are drawn perpendicularly from a number of equidistant points of the central sulcus line in the anterior direction .
the number of equidistant points is chosen to obtain a total electrode surface of 35 cm2 , which the literature widely reports as the recommended size for a direct current intensity of 1.5 ma .
( 3 ) the shape obtained on paper is transferred onto a commercial band of conductive silicone .
the latter is 0.2 mm thick and has a 1 mm diameter channel running along its length .
the electrode is manually cut along the contour , making sure that the channel remains roughly at the center of the band 's length .
( 4 ) a standard electric wire , which will deliver the 1.5 ma direct current , is finally placed inside the channel .
figure 1 whole body s1 personalized electrode .
in one exemplificative subject , we schematize the main steps of electrode personalization [ ref .
( 14 ) , see materials and methods ) .
( a ) after drawing the left and right central sulci using softtaxic software from individual 3d mri , we fit this line by 2 cm wide parallelograms and we cut the electrode from a conductive silicon band .
( b ) we position the personalized stimulating electrode by proper neuronavigation procedure along the central sulcus with the center of the electrode crossing the nasion - inion line .
( c ) s1wb personalized electrode and the cathode electrode positioned on oz. following the softaxic navigator , the electrode was positioned 1.5 cm posterior and 0.5 cm anterior to the central sulcus , centered on the nasion - inion line .
cathode electrode ( 6 cm x 14 cm ) was positioned on oz. contact with the subject 's head was facilitated by a conductive gel and an elastic cotton net maintained the electrodes stable along the entire session ( figure 1 ) .
transcranial direct current stimulation ( 5 - day treatment ) transcranial direct current stimulation was delivered by an electrical stimulator through a constant current unit and an isolation unit [ sm1 ( 21 ) ; s1 - eldith stimulator by neuroconn , ilmenau , germany ] .
anode electrode was positioned as described above .
cathode electrode was under the chin for the sm1 stimulation and on oz for the s1 stimulation .
the 1.5 - ma constant current was applied for 15 min once a day for five consecutive days , according to previous studies against pain ( 22 , 23 ) .
in particular , a 1.5 - ma current strength produces a current density of about 0.04 ma / cm2 for the anode electrode of 35 cm2 ( 5 , 24 ) , which is well below safety thresholds .
cathode electrode size was of 84 cm2 , resulting in a current density of 0.02 ma / cm2 under this electrode , corresponding to a non - effect current density in this reference region ( 25 , 26 ) .
impedances were below 10 komega throughout the stimulations .
sham condition consisted of 4 s of active stimulation at the beginning and at the end of each day 's 15 - min stimulation .
at debriefing , no subject reported to feel any difference across tcss .
transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe cortical excitability changes in m1 single - pulse tms was performed through a standard focal coil ( diameter of each wing 70 mm ) connected with a bistim 200 module ( the magstim company ltd. , whitland , uk ) .
we recorded tms meps from left and right opponens pollicis ( op ) by surface electrodes in a belly tendon montage ( 2.5 cm apart ) .
following international standards , we identified the " hot - spot " of the right op muscle and the corresponding resting motor threshold ( rmt ) ( 27 , 28 ) .
thereafter , we maintained the coil position - digitized and monitored throughout the whole session by the softaxic neuronavigator - by means of a support arm ( figure 2a ) .
figure 2 transcranial magnetic stimulation and eeg settings for brain plasticity assessment .
experimental settings for the mep ( a ) and sep ( b ) recordings .
transcranial magnetic stimulation intensity was settled at 120 % rmt and 20 meps were then collected in complete relaxation while tms was delivered with an inter - stimulus interval randomly ranging between 5 and 7 s. the whole procedure was repeated in the other hemisphere to obtain left op motor cortical representation .
electroencephalographic study to probe cortical excitability changes in s1 electrophysiological data recording electroencephalographic signals were recorded with a 64 - channel actichamp system ( brain products gmbh , gilching , germany , figure 2b ) .
the montage included fz derivation for reference and fpz for ground .
eeg signals were sampled at 5 khz and a preconditioning 0.1 - 1500 hz bandpass filtering was applied .
median nerve stimulation all subjects sat comfortably on an armchair during the experiment .
in order to induce somatosensory evoked responses following a painless thumb twitch , their mn was stimulated at the wrist with a constant current electrical stimulator ( model ds3 , digitimer ltd. , hertfordshire , uk ) , using standard parameters ( cathode proximal , 250 ms inter - stimulus interval , 0.2 ms duration , above motor threshold intensity ) .
left and right mns were separately stimulated for 5.5 min , totaling about 1300 artifact - free trials , which were stored for off - line analysis .
the sep epochs ranged from 10 ms pre to 100 ms post - stimulus .
epochs whose voltage amplitudes exceeded +/ - 100 muv at the eog electrode as well as those containing saturating artifacts were rejected .
all amplitude values referred to the 5 - 10 ms post - stimulus interval .
the amplitude of the n20 component was measured as the first negative peak between 18 and 23 ms. the n20 - p25 complex was determined as the difference between the n20 peak and the subsequent positivity peak ( p25 ) , occurring at a latency of around 23 - 29 ms. for purposes of the present study , we used the typical bipolar derivation used to assess seps [ c3 - c4 , ref. ( 29 )] .
statistical analysis after checking the distribution of mep and sep amplitudes ( as tested by shapiro - wilk test ) , we applied , when necessary , suitable transformations in order to achieve a better approximation to gaussianity and a good control of outliers .
to test the effects of the 5 - day tdcs on mfis , mep , and sep variables , analyses of variance ( anova ) for repeated measures were performed with stimulation ( real , sham ) and treatment ( pre - , post - tdcs treatment ) as within - subjects factors .
within - subjects factor hemisphere ( left , right ) was included for mep and sep , which had been collected bilaterally since we performed a bilateral stimulation .
a similar approach was used for the effects on fine hand motor control measure , with the 9hpt submitted to the anova with tdcs intervention ( pre , post ) , stimulation ( real , sham ) , and hand ( right , left ) within - subjects factors .
we performed separate anova designs in the two patients' subgroups stimulated on bilateral s1wb or sm1hand .
significance threshold was set to 0.050 and we reported trends for p < 0.100 .
results the 21 patient cohorts presented a mild clinical picture in accordance to the inclusion criteria ( table 1 ) .
the two electrode - dependent subgroups displayed homogenous clinical features ( table 1 ) .

fatigue levels whole body s1 stimulation ( s1wb ) analyses of variance indicated that mfis changes were related to the type of stimulation ( real or sham ) when the bilateral personalized s1wb electrode was used [ stimulation x treatment interaction f ( 1,8 ) = 9.692 , p = 0.014 , ( 6 ) , table 2 ] .
fatigue resulted reduced after real stimulation ( post hoc comparison p = 0.002 , 31.0 +/ - 12.0 post - vs. 42.1 +/ - 7.9 pre - stimulation ) , whereas there were no changes after the sham stimulation [ post hoc comparison p = 0.901 , 34.8 +/ - 10.4 post - vs. 37.2 +/ - 7.0 pre - stimulation , ( 6 ) , table 2 ] .
after real stimulation , the mean fatigue reduction was 28 % of the baseline ( range between 2 and 76 %) , and 8 % after sham ( range between - 11 and 38 % , paired - samples t - test real vs. sham , p = 0.016 ) .

p is the significance of the stimulation x treatment interaction effect .
in bold , values with significant difference between pre - and post - treatment , as estimated by post - hoc comparison whenever the stimulation x treatment interaction effect was significant .
tdcs treatment effect on fine hand motor control ( 9hpt ) in the s1wb group , 9hpt of the right hand correlated with both edss and physical items of mfis ( pearson 's r = 0.736 , p = 0.015 and r = 0.744 , p = 0.014 , respectively ) .
it should be noted that the correlation between mfis _ phys and 9hpt remains substantially stable after correction for edss ( partial correlation r = 0.602 , p = 0.086 ) .
the lesion load was not associated with any clinical or fatigue - related measure ( lrf with edss , bdi , total or physical mfis p > 0.200 consistently ) .
the full model anova evidenced , in addition to the right hand performing better than the left [ hand factor f ( 1,8 ) = 5.749 , p = 0.043 , overall average 20.3 +/ - 4.6 and 22.6 +/ - 4.3 s , respectively ] , that the two hands' performances were differently affected by the intervention [ hand ( right , left ) x tdcs intervention ( pre , post ) x stimulation ( real , sham ) effect f ( 1,8 ) = 5.697 , p = 0.044 ] .
repeating the reduced models for each hand separately , we observed that the left hand did not change after the 5 - day stimulation , while the right hand 9hpt changed in terms of dependence on whether the stimulation was real or sham [ stimulation x tdcs intervention effect f ( 1,8 ) = 5.680 , p = 0.044 ] .
the post hoc comparison showed that , after the real stimulation , the time required to execute the 9hpt decreased ( two - tails paired t - test p = 0.038 , with average 21.1 +/ - 4.9 pre and 19.8 +/ - 3.8 s post values ] , while it was unchanged by sham stimulation ( t - test p = 0.401 ) .
no association emerged among post - tdcs values of mfis regarding either total or physical and 9hpt scores .
hand sm1 stimulation ( sm1hand ) no interaction stimulation x treatment effect was observed when sm1hand electrode was used ( p > 0.200 , table 2 ) , indicating that effects of real and sham stimulations on fatigue levels were not clearly different .
m1 excitability no differences were observed in rmts , stimulation intensities or mep latencies when compared between hemispheres , between stimulation types ( real or sham ) or treatments ( pre - post - stimulation ) ( p > 0.200 consistently ) .
in the s1wb group , the mean of rmt across all conditions was 58.4 +/ - 2.6 % of the maximal stimulator output , tms intensity was 70.2 +/ - 3.1 % , mep latency was 27.3 +/ - 3.2 ms. in the sm1hand group , the rmt decreased after stimulation ( paired - samples t - test p = 0.004 ; pre 59.2 +/ - 18.8 and post 55.0 +/ - 17.9 % of the maximal stimulator output ) , while the latency did not change 24.4 +/ - 2.6 ms. mep latency was associated to the ms severity ( edss - mep latency pearson 's coefficient r = 0.880 , p = 0.021 ) .
motor evoked potential amplitude distribution definitely differed from a gaussian and we obtained a good fit by natural logarithmic transformation ( shapiro - wilk p > 0.200 consistently ) .
no association was evident between the order of mep collection and its amplitude ( pearson 's correlation p = 0.607 ) .
mean mep amplitude , estimated as exponential back - transformation of mean of logarithm - transformed mep amplitudes , were 171.5 +/ - 1.8 for the right op and 145.3 +/ - 1.9 for the left op. no difference of baseline mep amplitudes was observed between real and sham stimulations ( t - test p = 0.380 averaging right and left values ) .
in the s1wb group , the anova on the mep amplitude showed a trend interaction effect stimulation x treatment ( p = 0.073 ) , which corresponded to an increase of mep amplitude after the real stimulation ( treatment effect , p = 0.037 ) , absent after sham ( p = 0.275 ) .
the average increase with respect to the baseline level was 6.0 % ranging between 0.2 and 22.6 % of baseline level ( meppost - meppre / meppre of logarithm - transformed mep amplitudes averages ) .
in the sm1hand group , mep amplitude increased after the real stimulation ( treatment effect , p = 0.021 ) .
the average increase with respect to the baseline level was 40.4 % ranging between 16.7 and 76.0 % of baseline level .
no association emerged among post - tdcs mep values and 9hpt scores .
s1 excitability no effects were observed in the n20 sep component between the two hemispheres or the two stimulations ( pre - post - stimulation , real or sham , p > 0.200 consistently ) .
the n20 - p25 complex showed a tendency to increasing after the stimulation , but no stimulation x treatment effect was found ( p > 0.200 ) .
relationships between s1 and m1 excitability and mfis variations fatigue level changes did not correlate with variations in m1 excitability in either of the s1wb or sm1hand subgroups ( p > 0.200 in both cases ) .
discussion our 5 - day tdcs stimulation targeting the bihemispheric whole body somatosensory region significantly decreased ms fatigue .
in addition , hand muscle meps showed that that stimulation modified m1 excitability , whereas mn seps showed no evidence of changes in s1 excitability .
mechanisms behind regional dependence of tdcs treatment efficacy ( i.e. , s1 - whole body vs. sm1 - hand ) overall , the 5 - day tdcs treatment targeting the bilateral s1wb representation showed the stimulation x treatment effect , which was lacking in the sm1hand intervention .
noteworthy , the average decrease in mfis score was 15.6 after real sm1hand stimulation - larger than the 11.1 point decrease observed after real s1wb stimulation , with similar baseline levels - and the specific paired t - test comparison was significant ( p = 0.030 ) .
we also analyzed why an average net ( real minus sham ) sm1 effect of 15.6 - 3.4 = 12.2 was not significant while an average net s1 effect of 11.1 - 2.4 = 8.7 was significant , with comparable sd ( a little bit larger in s1 , indeed ) ( although such a comparison is irrelevant in the absence of a significant interaction ) .
the reason lies in the different correlation patterns : within the sm1hand subgroup , correlations are absent between sham and real baseline levels , as well as between fatigue scale values from other time points , contrasting clear ( and expected ) correlations in the s1wb subgroup ( table 3 ) .

in bold , significant correlations .
the s1wb treatment was more effective than over sm1hand ( 21 ) and than over the left prefrontal cortex ( 30 ) .
this comparative result strengthens the working hypothesis , which guided the development of the s1 - whole body personalized electrode .
in fact , data available in the literature document a failure of the inhibitory mechanisms in the frontal and primary motor ( m1 ) areas involved in motor planning ( 4 ) , a reduced m1 ici before and after fatiguing exercises ( 4 ) , and an increase in m1 excitability ( 4 ) in fatigued vs. non - fatigued ms patients and to healthy subjects .
concurrently , together with excessive excitability of m1 , we observed signs of a reduced s1 excitability ( 10 ) .
moreover , we observed an altered parieto - frontal projection , mainly involving s1 and m1 , in fatigued vs. non - fatigued ms patients ( 13 , 31 ) .
thus , we decided to neuromodulate to enhance selectively the excitability of s1 , avoiding a direct enhancement of m1 excitability ( as occurs with sm1 electrode ) , to further support the parieto - frontal projection already observed by tdcs ( 12 ) .
suitability of differentiated effects targeting s1 vs. sm1 transcranial direct current stimulation - generated modulations of cortical excitability can be focused by means of proper sizing and positioning of the stimulation electrode .
since tdcs efficacy is determined by the current density ( i.e. , current strength / electrode area ) , we can obtain increased focality by reducing the electrode size while keeping a constant current strength .
in the motor system , nitsche and colleagues ( 32 ) compared tdcs effects on central representations of two muscles , first dorsal interosseus ( fdi ) and abductor digiti minimi ( adm ) , by measuring meps .
stimulation with small electrodes ( 3.5 cm2 ) generated focal effects , with different mep amplitude increases for the two muscles ( 32 ) .
the protocol we are proposing actually requires less focality than nitsche 's , where a discrimination of m1 neuronal pools controlling the two hand muscles was sought .
in fact , we intend to stimulate motor vs. sensory regions .
however , while positioning of tdcs electrodes in m1 stimulation can be guided by tms , which induces responses from specific muscles , a neuronavigation system is required when stimulating s1 vs. m1 to precisely identify the central sulcus .
modern frameless stereotaxic systems allow navigation on the subject 's structural mri - derived brain representation , providing high - spatial precision with accuracy in the range of millimeters ( 33 ) .
in our experimental setup , we used precise topographical determination of the central sulcus in placing the s1wb electrode ( 6 , 14 , 25 , 34 ) .
tdcs targeting bilateral vs. mono - hemispheric regions multiple sclerosis fatigue is not associated to mono - hemispheric prevalence , as shown by electrophysiological ( 10 ) and neuroimaging data ( 9 ) .
thus , via the tdcs intervention , we targeted bilateral ( 35 ) either whole body s1 or hand sm1 .
in the present results , we observed bilateral m1 enhancement , documenting that bilateral stimulations of a homologous area do not cancel out .
this hypothesis of ineffective bilateral m1 stimulation is derived from the well - known motor system organization , with m1 of one hemisphere inhibiting m1 of the other hemisphere. through bilateral stimulation of homologous m1 areas , the concurrent increase of inhibition induced by the increase in excitability of one hemisphere might thus cancel out the increase in excitability in the other hemisphere .
however , we can reject such a hypothesis , and we can also speculate that a relevant component of the presently observed neuromodulation operates directly on local pyramidal neurons , and not via inhibitory or excitatory networks beneath the electrode ( 36 , 37 ) .
brain plasticity induced by s1 stimulation we did not find evidence of s1 excitability changes induced by s1wb tdcs treatment , as measured by the typical sep assessment .
this can be due to two causes .
the first is that the sep gives an indirect assessment of cortical pyramidal neurons with respect to tms - derived mep .
in fact , tms stimulates pyramidal neurons and the mep muscle response gives a measure of cortical excitability with as a single - station - pathway ( only the spinal cord relay in between ) .
instead , the pathway between mn stimulation and s1 ( here assessed by single - derivation sep ) includes spinal cord , brain stem , and thalamic relays .
the second reason can be poor sensitivity of eeg - derived sep analysis .
in addition , we found more effects in m1 than in s1 , which can be due to non - selective s1 stimulation. via simulations ( in progress ) , we are in fact observing that the induced current density is slightly prevalent in s1 but it is of a comparable intensity also in m1 .
study limitations we did not study the two datasets ( s1wb and sm1hand 5 - day tdcs treatments ) in a single statistical model , since a different anode electrode size ( anode electrode area of 70 cm2 for sm1 and 352 for s1 ) and a different reference position ( on oz or on the left shoulder ) were used .
here , we investigated somatosensory evoked responses , since we performed a stimulation planned to focus on s1 .
we started from a standard single derivation in each hemisphere to assess sep changes .
nevertheless , we collected 64 - channel eeg data to further investigate cortical effects .
in particular , source analysis will allow future investigations of our main hypothesis of a modification induced by the tdcs treatment on sensory - motor functional connectivity .

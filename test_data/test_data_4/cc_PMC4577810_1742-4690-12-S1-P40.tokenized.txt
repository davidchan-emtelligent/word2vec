in order to succeed in the long term , the managers of the registry must work to raise the satisfaction of the registrants .
we conducted a satisfaction survey for the htlv - 1 associated myelopathy ( ham ) patient registry known as " ham - net. " based on the data we collected , we made several alterations , mainly to the newsletter and website .
this year we repeated the survey to determine if our alterations were beneficial or not by assessing changes in satisfaction levels .
we surveyed 368 patients registered to ham - net , inquiring about their general impression of ham - net , the requisite telephone interviews , the newsletter , and the website .
the response rate was 74.7 % , and 198 registrants responded to the satisfaction survey both times .
the number of individuals satisfied with ham - net in general improved from 63.6 % to 77.3 % of registrants .
more specifically , satisfaction with the newsletter rose dramatically but no significant change was observed for the website .
therefore we concluded that focusing on the newsletter is currently the best way to improve patient satisfaction .
for example , we deduced that it is beneficial to increase the volume and quality of the articles .
on the other hand , we could not demonstrate that frequently updating the website was beneficial to the patients .
we inferred that the website must be improved to be more appealing and useful to the patients .
in this study , we showed that properly investigating patient satisfaction using a detailed questionnaire can produce the data necessary to improve patient satisfaction levels .
the best way to preserve a good relationship with the registered patients in the long term is to prioritize understanding the patients' needs and continuously work to improve their satisfaction .

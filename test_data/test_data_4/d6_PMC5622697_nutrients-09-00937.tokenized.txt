objectives : to investigate the immunomodulatory effect and molecular mechanisms of eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa , a typical kind of n - 3pufas ) on raw264.7 cells .
methods : a variety of research methods , including the raw264.7 cells culture , cell proliferation assays , morphologic observations , measurements of no production , cytokine assays , nuclear protein extractions , western blot analyses and nf - kappab p65 immunofluorescence assays were used in this study .
results : the results showed that epa could increase the proliferation index and enhance the release of nitric oxide ( no ) and cytokines in raw264.7 cells .
western blotting results revealed that the protein level of gpr120 increased significantly in raw264.7 cells after epa treatment .
meanwhile , epa elevated the phosphorylation status of raf , which may act as an upstream regulator of epa - induced phosphorylated erk1 / 2 .
in addition , the phosphorylated erk1 / 2 may then promote ikkbeta in endochylema and translocate the nf - kappab p65 subunit into the nucleus , thus regulating the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) and cytokines .
conclusions : epa ( 0.6 - 3.0 mumol ) activates raw264.7 cells through gpr120 - mediated raf - erk1 / 2 - ikkbeta - nf - kappab p65 signaling pathways .
eicosapentaenoic acid immunomodulatory nf - kappab raw264.7 cells raf 1 .
introduction polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) exhibit several favorable effects on cardiovascular diseases [ 1 ] , autoimmune disorders and inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis [ 2 ] , rheumatoid arthritis [ 3,4 ] and diabetes [ 5 ] .
for more than 30 years , researchers have known that polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) can influence the immune system [ 6 ] .
eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) , a well - known dietary n - 3 pufa , is a long - chain pufa that has 20 carbon atoms and 5 double bonds ( 20:5 ) .
itis used as a food supplement with several beneficial effects , including the prevention of cardiovascular diseases , cancers and diabetes [ 7,8 ] .
although epa and dha intake as food or supplement effectively prevented cardiovascular events , cardiac deaths and coronary events in patients with high cardiovascular risk [ 9 ] , it still has some controversy [ 10,11 ] .
some studies have suggested that dietary epa can significantly affect human specific and nonspecific immunity [ 12 ] .
in addition , research has shown that pre - treatment with 100 mumol of epa decreases lps - induced pro - inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages [ 13 ] .
however , only a few studies have demonstrated that epa induces the activation of macrophages .
the immune system is a system of biological processes that protect against diseases .
disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and even cancer [ 14,15 ] .
macrophages occupy a unique niche in the immune system , as important target cells of some antitumor and immunomodulatory drugs [ 16 ] .
in contrast to most other mouse - derived cell cultures , the macrophage - like cell line raw264.7 [ 17 ] supports the replication of murine noroviruses and is widely used for this purpose [ 18 ] .
further , raw264.7 cells are commonly accepted as a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms of macrophages involved immuneregulation [ 19 ] .
g protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) are important signaling molecules for many aspects of cellular function .
it was reported that five orphan receptors , gpr40 , gpr41 , gpr43 , gpr84 , and gpr120 , can be activated by free fatty acids ( ffas ) .
long - chain fas can activate gpr40 [ 20 ] and gpr120 [ 21 ] .
gpr120 involved in homeostatic metabolic regulation in inflammatory and immune processes in vivo [ 22 ] .
macrophages defend against external pathogens by releasing cytotoxic and inflammatory molecules such as no and also by secreting cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , tnf - alpha and ifn - gamma ) [ 23 ] .
these defense mechanisms are activated when various molecules trigger several different signaling pathways including mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) and nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) [ 24 ] .
the raf protein plays a pivotal role in regulating cell survival , cell cycle progression and cell differentiation [ 25 ] .
erk1 / 2 , also called p44 / p42 mapk , also plays an essential role in a wide variety of cellular processes , including metabolism , cell proliferation and cell survival [ 26 ] .
however , the relationship among them in the activation of macrophages has not been discussed .
the aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of a low dose of epa induced activation in raw264.7 cells .
in this study , the mechanism responsible for a low dose of epa activated raw264.7 cells were examined .
the protein expression of g - protein coupled cell membrane receptor ( gpr120 ) was tested by western blot to investigate the effect of epa on raw264.7 cells .
meanwhile , the production of no , inos expression and the level of cytokines induced by epa were measured .
the expression of phosphorylated raf , phosphorylated erk1 / 2 , ikkbeta and nf - kappab p65 were assessed after a low dose of epa treatment .
in addition , tak632 ( the inhibitor of raf ) , pd98059 ( the inhibitor of erk1 / 2 ) , and pdtc ( the inhibitor of nf - kappab ) were used to investigate the relationship among them .
the results suggested that a low dose of epa up - regulated no , inos and cytokine production via a gpr120 - mediated raf - erk1 / 2 - ikkbeta - nf - kappab p65 signaling pathway in raw264.7 cells .
these results will expand current knowledge of the mechanism of how epa acts as a potent adjuvant and agent with immunomodulatory activity .

3. result 3.1 .
epa increased the proliferation index of raw264.7 cells as shown in figure 1a , epa increased the cell proliferation at the concentrations of 0.6 - 3.0 mumol for 24 h in a dose - dependent manner in comparison with control .
meanwhile , epa at 2.4 mumol also significantly enhanced the proliferation index of raw264.7 cells in a time - dependent manner ( figure 1b ) .
at the concentration of 2.4 mumol , the proliferation rate at 12 h was about 31.5 % and at 24 h reached the maximal rate of about 63.9 % .
these results suggest that epa can promote the raw264.7 cells proliferation .
3.2 .
epa induced the morphological changes of raw264.7 cells once macrophages have been stimulated by an activator , some typical morphological changes are exhibited .
acridine orange is a basic stain whose planar structure is derived from anthracene .
it shows a high affinity for nucleic acid , and intercalates into ds or binds electrostatically to ss nucleic acid emitting a green fluorescence at 530 nm and red fluorescence at 640 nm , respectively , under uv light [ 32 ]. to further determine the morphological changes of raw264.7 cells by epa , cells were stained with acridine orange .
in the control , raw264.7 cells were normal in size and structure and the staining green fluorescence of those cells was weak ( figure 1 ( ca )) .
in contrast to the control , the cells treated with 1.2 mumol epa for 24 h showed a markedly stronger staining fluorescent intensity , and reached the peak value with 2.4 mumol epa ( figure 1 ( cb,c )) .
meanwhile , the number of cells treated with 1.2 - 2.4 mumol epa significantly increased in a dose - dependent manner .
in the study above , the results suggested that epa could promote the raw264.7 cells proliferation ( figure 1c ) .
3.3 .
epa induced no production of raw264.7 cells no has been demonstrated to play an important role in a variety of physiological effects , host defenses and immunity responses [ 33 ] .
to investigate whether or not epa was capable of inducing no production in macrophages , raw264.7 cells were treated with epa ( 0 - 3.0 mumol ) for 24 h. as shown in figure 2 , a minimum amount of no was released in the control , though cells treated with epa at concentrations from 0 to 3.0 mumol showed significantly ( p < 0.01 ) higher no production in a dose - dependent manner .
these results indicate that epa can enhance immune - stimulatory activity such as the release of no .
3.4 .
effect of epa on gpr120 protein expression gpr120 is a g - protein coupled cell membrane receptor expressed on macrophages which can bind with long - chain fatty acids .
a marked increase in gpr120 protein level was detected in raw264.7 cells after treatment with epa relative to the control , and the protein expression of gpr120 reached peak value at the concentration of 2.4 mumol epa ( figure 3a ) .
3.5 .
measurement of erk , raf and ikkbeta the stimulation of gpr120 by ffas may result in activation of the erk cascade [ 21 ] .
recent studies have shown that the raf protein can mediate diverse biological functions such as cell growth , cell survival and cell differentiation [ 34 ] .
activation of inhibitor kappa b kinase ( ikk ) stimulates the translocation and transactivation of transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) , which then induces the expression of certain inflammatory genes [ 35 ] .
as shown in figure 3b,c , the level of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 , phosphorylated raf and ikkbeta in endochylema increased in a dose - dependent manner and reached their maximum value at the concentration of 2.4 mumol epa .
3.6 .
relationship between erk1 / 2 and raf , ikkbeta the results above demonstrate that phosphorylated erk1 / 2 , phosphorylated raf and ikkbeta in endochylema are involved in epa - induced raw264.7 cell activation .
in order to further assess the relationship , cells were pre - incubated with either pd98059 ( pd , an inhibitor of erk1 / 2 , at 10 mumol ) or tak 632 ( tak , an inhibitor of raf , at 25 nmol ) prior to adding epa at a concentration of 2.4 mumol .
the expression of phosphorylated raf , phosphorylated erk1 / 2 and ikkbeta was then estimated .
the level of raf phosphorylation was not reduced by pd98069 ( inhibitor of erk1 / 2 ) , which indicates that raf phosphorylation is not dependent on erk1 / 2 .
the increasing level of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 was effectively blocked not only by its own inhibitor pd98069 , but also by tak632 in raw264.7 cells .
simultaneously , the expression of ikkbeta in cytoplasm was significantly decreased by pd98059 ( inhibitor of erk1 / 2 ) ( figure 4 ) .
the results indicate that ikkbeta expression in cytoplasm is dependent on erk1 / 2 phosphorylation , and also leads to the hypothesis that raf may act as an upstream regulator of epa induced erk1 / 2 phosphorylation in raw264.7 cells .
3.7 .
effect of epa on the expression of nf - kappab p65 nf - kappab is an important transcription factor in the regulation of pro - inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages .
ikappab is a protein bound to dimers of nf - kappab , which retains these transcription factors in the cytoplasm .
an activation of ikappab kinase ( ikk ) leads to the phosphorylation of ikappab and its degradation which allow nuclear localization of nf - kappab [ 36,37 ] .
to investigate whether or not epa activates the nf - kappab signaling pathway , the nuclear level of nf - kappab p65 and ikappab - alphawere analyzed by western blot .
as shown in figure 5a , ikappabalpha proteolytically degraded and free nf - kappab p65 translocated into the nucleus .
meanwhile , under the lscm , the intensity of nf - kappab p65 fluorescence in the nucleus treated by epa ( 2.4 mumol ) was significantly stronger than that of the control ( figure 5b ) .
the results above indicate that epa can induce nf - kappab activation in raw264.7 cells .
3.8 .
epa regulated the protein expression of inos and cytokines the current study suggests that epa ( 0.6 - 3.0 mumol ) can promote no production .
in order to further evaluate whether or not the improvement of no synthesis by epa at concentration from 0 to 3.0 mumol was due to the enhancement of inos expression , cells were incubated with epa ( 0 - 3.0 mumol ) for 24 h in either the presence or absence of pretreated 10mumol pdtc ( inhibitor of nf - kappab ) .
the protein expression of inos was then measured by western blot .
as shown in figure 5c , the level of inos increased in a dose - dependent manner in raw264.7 cells treated with epa ( 1.2 - 2.4 mumol ) , while pdtc pretreatment can suppress epa - induced inos production .
because of the prominent role of cytokines in the maturation and function of macrophages , the potential for epa to regulate the expression of these mediators in raw264.7 cells were examined .
as shown in figure 5d , the addition of epa resulted in an increase in il - 1beta , il - 6 , ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha protein levels in a dose - dependent manner .
additionally , the protein levels of all cytokines decreased in the presence of pdtc .
these results suggest that the activation of nf - kappab is one of the essential factors for inos production and cytokine expression in raw264.7 cells treated with epa , and further confirm that epa can promote the activation of raw264.7 cells .
4. discussion pufas have been shown to have a large variety of biological effects [ 38,39 ] .
in recent years , tremendous research efforts have been put into establishing the different effects of various fatty acid families and individual fatty acids on a range of immune responses measured in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo , in an attempt to isolating mechanisms to prevent and / or treat diseases or conditions with an immunological basis [ 40 ] .
although efforts have been put in this research area , the immunomodulatory activity of pufas has not been clearly explained .
like the molecular mechanism responsible for epa activated immunocytes such as macrophages remains to be clarified .
the purpose for the present study is to investigate the activation of epa on raw264.7 cells and its subsequent intracellular signaling pathways .
in the present study , the immunomodulatory effect and molecular mechanisms of epa ( 0.6 - 3.0 mumol ) on raw264.7 cells were investigated .
so far , the relative study has showed that the concentration of epa in serum phospholipids was 0.9 mg / 100 ml ( about 0.8 % of fame ) in persons taking chicken fed soybean oil supplement [ 41 ] .
due to the fact that our experiments were performed in vitro , it was unable to confirm the relationship between the active concentration of epa used in the experiments and the serum concentrations of people taking varying levels of epa containing foods .
it would be imperative to investigate the effect of epa in vivo in the future study .
macrophage activation is one of the most important events in the immune response system [ 42 ] .
no is also related to the cytolysis function of macrophages against a variety of antigens and cytokines are key signaling molecules of the immune system .
in addition , activated macrophages participate in immune responses by releasing cytokines such as il - 1beta , il - 6 , ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha [ 43 ] .
our results indicate that a low dose of epa can effectively enhance the proliferation index of raw264.7 macrophages and increase the production of no and cytokines in raw264.7 cells , which verified that epa could activate macrophages and participate in immune responses .
gpr120 is a functional omega - 3 fa receptor / sensor and mediates potent insulin sensitizing and antidiabetic effects in vivo by repressing macrophage - induced tissue inflammation .
according to results , after epa treatment at concentration of 1.2 - 3.0 mumol , an up - regulated gpr120 protein expression was found in raw264.7 cells suggesting that gpr120 might be the one signal that ultimately results in intracellular signaling pathways for downstream nf - kappab p65 activation thus leading to the production of inos .
the result also revealed that gpr120 was the receptor of epa on the raw264.7 cells surface , which is consistent with the literature reports .
mapks play a vital role in cell proliferation , migration and mobility [ 44 ] .
erk1 / 2 is a major member of the mapk family [ 45 ] .
furthermore , the raf protein also plays a critical role in the mapks pathway [ 46 ] .
the raf proteins are located upstream of mek and activated raf phosphorylates mapk kinase 1 / 2 ( mek 1 / 2 ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk 1 / 2 ) [ 47 ] .
the current study suggests that epa induces the phosphorylation of raf , the phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and increases the ikkbetain raw264.7 cells , whereas pretreatment with tak - 632 and pd98059 clearly antagonizes the up - regulated expression of erk1 / 2 phosphorylation and ikkbeta in endochylema .
this effect indicates that ikkbeta expression is dependent on the erk1 / 2 phosphorylation , and phosphorylated raf may act as an upstream regulator of epa induced erk1 / 2 phosphorylation in raw264.7 cells .
the activation of nf - kappab is regulated by cellular kinases , including mapk [ 48 ] .
nf - kappab is an important transcription factor that regulates a number of genes , including inos , tnf - alpha andil - 6which are important for immunity and inflammation [ 49 ] .
nf - kappab is generally inactive in the cytoplasm and is involved in the non - covalent binding form of the p50 - p65 - inhibitor kappab ( ikappab ) complex .
when activation signals of nf - kappab are received , serine residues in ikappab are phosphorylated and dissociated from nf - kappab , and are then transferred to the nucleus as an activated transcription factor [ 50 ] .
after ikappab degradation , the binding sites of the p50 - p65 dimer are exposed to combine with the ikappab motif .
then the nf - kappab p65 subunit transfers from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , which in turn presents potent activity .
furthermore , because of the major role of the transcription factor in immunity , the nf - kappab pathway has drawn much attention and has become a central target of drugs used to treat cancer .
when cells were stimulated by epa , nf - kappab was translocated into the nucleus , which in turn modulated gene expressions .
total nf - kappab ( p65 ) and ikappab were detected by western blotting .
as shown in figure 5a,b , the level of total nf - kappab ( p65 ) nearly unchanged after treatment with epa , whereas that of nf - kappab in nucleus displayed an increased trend .
these results show that ikappabalpha proteolytic degradation and free nf - kappab p65 translocation into the nucleus are both induced by epa in raw264.7 cells , which indicated that the activation of raw264.7 cells by epa were associated with the ikappab - nf - kappab signaling pathway .
5. conclusions our study demonstrates that epa ( 1.2 - 3.0 mumol ) has potent immune - stimulatory activity in raw264.7 cells .
epa can also effectively improve no production , inos expression and cytokine levels , which might be due to the activation of the nf - kappab p65 signal pathway .
in addition , epa promoted the proliferation index of raw264.7 cells through gpr120 - mediated raf , erk1 / 2 and nf - kappab signaling pathways .
a speculated schematic diagram of epa - induced raw264.7 cell activation is depicted in figure 6 .
these results expand current knowledge of the mechanism of how epa acts as a potent adjuvant and agent with immunomodulatory activity .
the current study only used the raw264.7 cells to investigate the immune - stimulatory activity of epa in vitro .
in the next study , we will explore the immune - stimulatory activity of epa on other cell lines , such as human cells such as thp - 1 cells or primary monocyte derived macrophages , or the effect of epa in vivo .

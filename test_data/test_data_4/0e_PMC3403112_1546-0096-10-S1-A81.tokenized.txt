early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent brain damage in many disorders .
making the diagnosis is especially challenging due to overlapping clinical presentations and the presenting features of different ibraind have not been systematically compared in children .
the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the clinical , laboratory , and imaging features at presentation for the different childhood ibraind at our institution .
methods a single centre cohort study was performed with consecutive children up to 18 years of age who were diagnosed with ibraind from june 1989 to december 2010 .
patients who were seen at the hospital for sick children were identified by a search of the brainworks database .
demographic , clinical , laboratory , neuroimaging and histologic data from the time of diagnosis were collected .
data were analysed using descriptive and univariate statistical analysis .
cluster analysis will also be performed .
results a total of 165 children ( 47 % females , median age 8.3 years ) with ibraind were identified : 124 primary angiitis of the central nervous system ( cpacns ) , 11 secondary cns vasculitis ( due to systemic lupus erythematosus in 4 , systemic vasculitis in 2 , crohn 's disease in 1 , and infection in 4 ) , 6 neuronal - antibody associated syndromes , 6 post - infectious ibraind , 4 other diagnoses ( 2 neurosarcoidosis , 1 channelopathy , 1 moya moya ) , and 14 non - specific ibraind .
male sex ( 71 %) and motor symptoms ( 87 %) , such as hemiparesis and ataxia , were more prominent in children with angiography - positive cpacns compared to other ibraind .
children with angiography - negative cpacns ( an - cpacns ) and neuronal - antibody associated syndromes were more likely to be female ( 74 % and 83 % , respectively ) and present with behaviour changes ( 56 % and 50 %) and cognitive dysfunction ( 35 % and 50 %) compared to other conditions .
these two diagnoses could be further distinguished by the presence of headache in 62 % , seizures in 79 % , and abnormal mri findings in 91 % of patients with an - cpacns , compared to 17 % , 33 % , and 17 % , respectively , in patients with neuronal - antibody associated syndromes .
conclusion differences observed in groups of symptoms ( motor vs. cognitive - behaviour ) at presentation should be considered in the development of distinct diagnostic criteria for the various childhood ibraind , leading to earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment .

massively parallel sequencing ( mps ) technology is capable of determining the sizes of short tandem repeat ( str ) alleles as well as their individual nucleotide sequences .
thus , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) within the repeat regions of strs and variations in the pattern of repeat units in a given repeat motif can be used to differentiate alleles of the same length .
in this study , mps was used to sequence 28 forensically - relevant y - chromosome strs in a set of 41 dna samples from the 3 major u.s. population groups ( african americans , caucasians , and hispanics ) .
the resulting sequence data , which were analyzed with strait razor v2.0 , revealed 37 unique allele sequence variants that have not been previously reported. of these , 19 sequences were variations of documented sequences resulting from the presence of intra - repeat snps or alternative repeat unit patterns .
despite a limited sampling , two of the most frequently - observed variants were found only in african american samples .
the remaining 18 variants represented allele sequences for which there were no published data with which to compare .
these findings illustrate the great potential of mps with regard to increasing the resolving power of str typing and emphasize the need for sample population characterization of str alleles .
keywords y - str sequence polymorphism allele variants massively parallel sequencing nextera strait razor handled by changqing zeng introduction short tandem repeat ( str ) markers located on the y - chromosome ( y - strs ) are extremely useful because of a lack of recombination .
barring mutation , all paternally - related males share the same y - str haplotype .
as a result , y - strs are used in genealogical and evolutionary studies , and forensic genetics casework including paternity testing to determine the biological father of a particular male child , missing persons cases where the y - str haplotype can serve as an extended reference profile for a given paternal lineage , and analyses of mixture evidence where there is substantially more female dna than male dna .
indeed , the variety of uses for y - str markers has made them the object of extensive research and application within the scientific community .
given the value of str markers in identity testing , efforts are underway to increase the power of discrimination associated with their respective typing and analysis methods .
primarily , an increase in power of discrimination has been accomplished through the introduction of new , highly - polymorphic strs and by developing larger multiplex panels [ 1 - 4 ] .
discrimination power also may be increased by further characterization beyond nominal length of the alleles at extant loci .
str alleles are typically characterized by the number of units in their repeat motifs , a distinction commonly determined by size separation by capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) .
however , other detection methods , such as sanger sequencing and mass spectrometry , have been used to determine both the size and the nucleotide composition of str alleles [ 5,6 ] .
the emergence of massively parallel sequencing ( mps ) technologies improved upon this principle by allowing for the detection of a substantially - larger amount of genetic sequence information with a higher throughput , lower cost , and greater ease - of - use than previous methods .
studies involving each of these approaches have resulted in the detection of intra - repeat single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) and novel repeat motif variants , which allow for a greater level of distinction than that of traditional ce methods [ 5 - 10 ] .
for instance , two individuals with the same nominal allele ( s ) ( based on length ) at a certain locus potentially may be distinguished by mps if the nucleotide sequence of the allele differs between them .
this level of resolution may prove invaluable in the deconvolution of genetic mixtures and also could provide information about population - specific alleles for evolutionary studies .
in this proof - of - principle study , mps was used to determine the repeat sequences of 28 forensically - relevant y - strs across a dataset of three major us populations ( n = 41 ) : caucasians ( cau ) , hispanics ( his ) , and african americans ( afa ) .
these sequence data revealed several intra - repeat snps and allelic variants that have not been documented previously .
the novel variants described herein are indicative of the potential of mps with regard to identifying additional genetic diversity of y - strs and support that more in depth population studies are warranted .
results since nanogram and subnanogram quantities of input dna can be typed by mps , pcr enrichment has become the method of choice for studies involving forensic applications .
however , this study employed a capture enrichment approach .
the truseq library preparation chemistry was selected initially , because no pcr amplification is required .
therefore , primer binding site mismatch issues would not impact multiplex design or the amplification success .
it was hypothesized that a dense probe design would increase capture efficiency of the target loci .
in addition , pcr - generated errors would be reduced , thus minimizing potential artifacts .
lastly , laying a foundation of sequence data with an alternate enrichment system could be useful when full validation studies are undertaken .
sequencing coverage all 28 y - str loci were detected with the approach described herein .
the coverage ranged from 0 to 1493 x , with a mean coverage of 9 - 387 x. the lowest performing markers were dys448 ( mean 9 x ) , dys449 ( mean 33 x ) , dys518 ( mean 34 x ) , dys389ii ( mean 37 x ) , and dys505 ( mean 38 x ) ; while the highest were dys643 ( mean 322 x ) , dys391 ( mean 333 x ) , and dys438 ( mean 387 x ) .
sequence variants a total of 37 unique y - str allele sequences that have not been previously published were detected across the 41 samples used in this study .
these sequences may be divided into 2 categories : nominal allele variant sequences and novel allele sequences .
for the purposes of this study , a nominal allele variant sequence is defined as any allele sequence that differs from the previously - documented sequence ( s ) for that particular allele , whereas a novel allele sequence refers to the sequence detected for an allele that has no previously published sequence data with which to compare .
nominal allele variants of the 37 previously - undocumented allele sequences that were detected , 19 were classified as nominal allele variant sequences .
these nominal variants were found in loci dys389i / ii , dys390 , dys393 , dys481 , dys518 , and dys635 , and have been further characterized as either snp variants or repeat pattern variants ( rpvs ) ( table 1 ) .
allele sequence variation may be introduced via strand slippage or one or more point variations within the repeat region .
in this study , nominal variant sequences were classified as snp variants if they displayed a repeat motif that differs from the commonly - described motif , an occurrence indicative of point substitution .
rpvs are defined as allele sequences that differ from published data with regard to repeat unit arrangement , but are consistent with the reported repeat motif .
such variations may be due to strand slippage or the presence of intra - repeat snps , but definitive conclusions cannot be made without additional data .
to illustrate the differences between these two types of variants , consider a locus with a reported repeat motif of [ tcta ] n [ tctg ] p ( where n and p represent the number of repeats ) .
if a " 17 " allele was detected with a repeat motif of [ tcta ] 5 [ tata ] 1 [ tctg ] 11 , this nominal allele variant sequence would likely be due to the presence of a c / a snp in the first " tcta " repeat unit .
since such a change results in a " tata " repeat unit that is inconsistent with the reported repeat motif , this sequence would be classified as a snp variant .
however , if another nominal variant was detected for this allele with a repeat motif of [ tcta ] 6 [ tctg ] 11 , it would be labeled a rpv , as the structure remains consistent with the reported repeat motif but displays a pattern of repeat units that has not been previously documented .
the unique sequence detected for allele " 9 " at locus dys389i is particularly interesting , as it completely lacks the " tctg " repeat unit found in the locus' repeat motif , [ tctg ] q [ tcta ] r ( q and r represent the number of a particular repeat within str ) .
instead , the variant allele , observed in only 1 caucasian sample , consists entirely of " tcta " repeats .
the published sequence for this allele consists of 3 " tctg " and 6 " tcta " repeat units .
since the " tctg " repeat unit , as defined in the reported repeat motif , is variable , its absence was not considered an inconsistency with regard to the motif , and this novel sequence is therefore deemed a rpv .
in total , only three of the 19 y - str nominal variants were snp variants .
at locus dys393 , an a / c snp in the variable " agat " repeat unit produced a leading " cgat " unit in allele " 13 " .
additionally , a t / g snp in the variable " ctt " repeat unit of alleles " 25 " and " 26 " at locus dys481 resulted in the presence of a leading " ctg " repeat in both of these alleles .
this snp variation was previously characterized by geppert and colleagues [ 7 ] in allele " 21 " , which also was detected in the current study .
in addition to the effects of snps , the nominal allele sequences detected in this study highlight a high degree of allele variability at certain loci due to rpv .
locus dys518 , for instance , displayed multiple variants for all but one allele , some of which were previously characterized by d'amato and colleagues [ 8 ] .
these variations are due to differences in the numbers of the two variable " aaag " repeat units at this locus .
finally , one of the detected sequence variations for the " 23 " allele at locus dys635 ( gata - c4 ) is particularly interesting .
this locus exhibits a wide range of allele variation due to the presence or absence of two " tgta " repeats among the trailing " tcta " repeat units , an occurrence that has been described previously in strbase ( http :// www.cstl.nist.gov / strbase / ystr _ fact.htm and http :// www.cstl.nist.gov / strbase / srm2395.htm ) and by oloffson and colleagues [ 11 ] .
however , the " 23 " allele detected in this study contained three " tgta " repeats , resulting in a sequence variant that has not been characterized until now .
the majority of these nominal allele sequence variants displayed a low frequency of occurrence across the dataset , with 16 of the 19 allele variants detected in only one single sample each .
however , the previously - described rpvs observed for allele " 30 " at locus dys389ii and for allele " 21 " at locus dys390 were detected in 7 and 8 samples , respectively .
interestingly , these variants occurred exclusively in african american samples , indicating that these alternative allele sequences may be population - specific and also may reflect the known greater genetic diversity in the african population .
for the most part , other frequently - observed sequence variants appeared to be fairly evenly parsed among at least two populations .
the majority of the allele sequences detected at the 28 targeted loci were consistent with previously - published sequences ( data not shown ) .
noteworthy examples include the microvariant alleles " 13.2 " and " 17.2 " at loci dys385 and dys458 , respectively , both of which have been previously characterized by myers and colleagues [ 12,13 ] .
at these loci , the microvariant alleles occur as a result of a " ga " deletion in the variable " gaaa " repeat unit .
novel allele variants in addition to the large number of observed sequences that have been documented previously , a total of 18 novel allele sequences were detected across the 41 samples analyzed ( table 2 ) .
the number of samples in which these novel sequences were observed ranged from 1 to 13 , although many occurred relatively infrequently across the dataset .
the novel allele sequences included two snp variants .
at locus dys570 , a t / c snp in allele " 23 " resulted in a sequence change from [ tttc ] 23 to [ tttc ] 5 [ tctc ] 1 [ tttc ] 17 .
another t / c snp , observed in allele " 35 " at locus dys612 , changed the repeat sequence from [ cct ] 5 [ ctt ] 1 [ tct ] 4 [ cct ] 1 [ tct ] 30 to [ cct ] 5 [ ctt ] 1 [ tct ] 4 [ cct ] 1 [ tct ] 17 [ cct ] 1 [ tct ] 12 .
the remaining novel sequences , such as those detected at locus dys635 , were consistent with the described repeat motifs of their respective alleles .
y - str haplogroup assignment lastly , haplogroup assignments were made for each y - str profile based on the number of repeats of each locus of a haplotype ( table s1 ) .
while there are sequences that are associated with specific haplogroups , the sample size is too small to make any population inferences .
the haplogroups are provided for each of the reported allele sequences as these may prove useful for future population studies .
conclusions the unique allele sequence variants detected in this study have been presented to demonstrate that additional characterization of y - str alleles is feasible by sequencing .
the results also provide some insight into the mechanism of allele variant occurrence .
while snp variants were detected , the majority of novel sequences consisted of repeat pattern variants .
although the exact mechanism of mutation for the repeat pattern variants observed in this study cannot be definitively concluded , it should be noted that the majority of str variation has been attributed to strand slippage [ 14 - 16 ] .
therefore , even if a single point mutation event may seem to be the most parsimonious explanation for a repeat pattern variant , a two - step strand slippage event may be more probable .
such concepts must be taken into account when characterizing these novel variants .
regardless of their mechanism of introduction , the presence of intra - repeat snps and repeat pattern variations in y - str alleles may aid in the differentiation of males sharing the same nominal alleles , and perhaps even paternally - related males , in forensic casework samples .
given its ability to detect both the length of str alleles and their individual nucleotide sequences , mps technology offers more resolution with regard to strs than traditional length - based detection methods , such as ce. ce would yield the size of an amplicon , i.e. , equivalent of repeat length , which can be ascertained from sequence data simply by counting the number of nucleotides within the repeat region .
to date , the vast majority of str nominal length results have been the same among different platforms and systems ( data not shown ) .
while the dataset used in this study was relatively small , the large number of observed novel allele sequence variants highlights the need for characterization of y - str alleles in larger sample populations .
materials and methods samples and extraction following the university of north texas health science center institutional review board approval , dna was extracted from whole blood samples from 41 unrelated anonymized individuals , consisting of 12 caucasian males , 16 hispanic males , and 13 african american males .
these populations were selected because they represent the three major populations in the geographic region .
extraction was performed using the qiagen qiaamp dna mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) , according to the manufacturer 's suggested protocol .
panel design the nextera rapid capture custom enrichment panel employed in this study was designed using the illumina design _ studio sequencing assay design tool .
nextera rapid capture chemistry ( illumina , san diego , ca ) is based on enzymatic tagmentation and probe - based capture enrichment .
custom oligonucleotide probes were designed to detect the following 28 forensically - significant y - strs : dys19 , dys385 , dys389i / ii , dys390 , dys391 , dys392 , dys393 , dys437 , dys438 , dys439 , dys448 , dys449 , dys456 , dys458 , dys460 , dys481 , dys505 , dys518 , dys522 , dys533 , dys549 , dys570 , dys576 , dys612 , dys635 , dys643 , and gata - h4 .
multiple probes were used for each y - str to improve enrichment efficiency .
probes ( 80 bases in length ) for the nextera rapid capture custom enrichment kit were designed using design studio ( illumina ) , a freely - available software .
the strs were tabulated including details regarding chromosomal positioning , target selection ( full region ) , probe density requirements ( due to the alignment - specific requirements of strs , density of these markers was set at ' adjacent ') , and marker information .
marker data then were uploaded to design studio v1.5 and probes were generated under the default conditions , with the hg19 human genome assembly ( http :// hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu / goldenpath / hg19 / chromosomes /) used for probe reference .
quantification and normalization 50 ng of genomic dna was used as the input amount for typing .
to bring the 41 extracted dna samples to the desired input concentration of 5 ng / mul for the nextera rapid capture custom enrichment protocol , the quantity of each dna sample was determined using the qubit fluorometric quantification method ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma ) and normalized to 10 ng / mul with a 10 mm tris - hcl solution at ph 8.5 .
the samples then were quantified again and normalized in the same manner to a final concentration of 5 ng / mul , to ensure that the proper amount of genomic dna would be used for the library preparation process .
library preparation as required by the nextera rapid capture custom enrichment protocol , 10 mul of each normalized sample was used for library preparation , for a total of 50 ng of genomic dna per sample .
the samples first underwent tagmentation by the nextera transposome , whereby the samples are enzymatically cleaved and bound to sequencing adapters [ 17 ] , at 58 degreesc in an applied biosystems geneamp pcr system 9700 thermal cycler ( thermo fisher scientific , south san francisco , ca ) .
the tagmented samples then were purified via two magnetic bead - based 80 % ethanol washes , and the fragment sizes of a small subset of these samples were analyzed using the agilent 2200 tapestation ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) to ensure that the tagmentation process was successful .
dual nextera sequencing indices then were attached to each of the tagmented samples by amplification in an eppendorf mastercycler pro s thermal cycler ( eppendorf , hamburg , germany ) , using the following parameters : 72 degreesc for 3 min , 98 degreesc for 30 s , 10 cycles of 98 degreesc for 10 s , 60 degreesc for 30 s , and 72 degreesc for 30 s , a final extension at 72 degreesc for 5 min , and a final hold at 10 degreesc .
following bead - based amplification cleanup with 80 % ethanol , each indexed sample was quantified using the qubit platform .
the samples then were normalized and pooled for sequencing , 12 at a time , such that each library contained 500 ng of each uniquely - indexed sample , for a total of 6000 ng of genomic dna per pool .
it should be noted that all libraries consisted of 12 samples .
the pooled libraries were hybridized once to the custom oligonucleotide probes in an eppendorf mastercycler pro s thermal cycler , using the following parameters : 95 degreesc for 10 min , 18 cycles of 1 - min incubation , starting at 94 degreesc , then decreasing 2 degreesc per cycle , and a final hold at 58 degreesc for approximately 12 h. a streptavidin bead - based cleanup step was performed wherein the libraries were washed twice for 30 min with an enrichment wash solution at 50 degreesc .
a second hybridization then was performed , using the same thermal cycling parameters , except that the final hold at 58 degreesc was extended to approximately 20 h. following a second heated streptavidin bead - based cleanup , the libraries underwent two additional magnetic bead - based washes with 80 % ethanol .
the libraries then were enriched through amplification in an eppendorf mastercycler pro s thermal cycler , using the following parameters : 98 degreesc for 30 s , 12 cycles of 98 degreesc for 10 s , 60 degreesc for 30 s , and 72 degreesc for 30 s , a final extension at 72 degreesc for 5 min , and a final hold at 10 degreesc .
a final magnetic bead - based cleanup procedure was performed , consisting of 2 washes with 80 % ethanol , and the libraries were quantified using the qubit platform .
following quantification , each library was analyzed on the agilent 2200 tapestation to determine the average size of the enriched fragments .
miseq sequencing and data analysis the concentration and size , in base pairs , of the nextera rapid capture custom enrichment libraries were used to determine their molarity .
to prepare for sequencing on the miseq ( illumina ) , each library was normalized to 2 nm using a solution of 10 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 8.5 ) with 0.1 % tween 20 .
illumina 's library preparation guidelines for the miseq were followed , and the concentration of each library was adjusted to 12 pm using chilled ht1 hybridization buffer .
paired - end sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v2 , with a read length of 250 bases .
strait razor v2.0 [ 18 ] was used to analyze the fastq files produced by miseq for each sample .
strait razor 's str allele detection method allows it to genotype alleles found in raw sequence data based on their length , while retaining their individual nucleotide sequences ( figure 1 ) .
for the purposes of the current study , a minimum coverage threshold of 5x was used for str allele determination .
the sequence data produced by strait razor for each of the targeted y - strs across all samples were analyzed using strait razor sequence analysis [ 18 ] , and the unique sequences associated with each allele were identified with the strait razor unique sequences compiler ( https :// www.unthsc.edu / graduate - school - of - biomedical - sciences / molecular - and - medical - genetics / laboratory - faculty - and - staff / strait - razor /) .
these unique sequences then were compared to the known sequences for those alleles that have been previously published in strbase ( http :// www.cstl.nist.gov / strbase / srm2395.htm and http :// www.cstl.nist.gov / strbase / srm2395.htm ) and the literature [ 7,8,11 - 13,19 ] .
y - str haplogroups were predicted from the repeat lengths ( i.e. , operationally - defined number of repeats ) of the str alleles comprising the haplotype using haplogroup predictor ( http :// www.hprg.com / hapest5 /) .

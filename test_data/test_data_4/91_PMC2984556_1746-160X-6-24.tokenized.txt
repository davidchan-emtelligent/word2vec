background quantitative sensory testing ( qst ) is applied to evaluate somatosensory nerve fiber function in the spinal system .
this study uses qst in patients with sensory dysfunctions after oral and maxillofacial surgery .
methods orofacial sensory functions were investigated by psychophysical means in 60 volunteers ( 30 patients with sensory disturbances and 30 control subjects ) in innervation areas of the infraorbital , mental and lingual nerves .
the patients were tested 1 week , 4 weeks , 7 weeks and 10 weeks following oral and maxillofacial surgery .
results qst monitored somatosensory deficits and recovery of trigeminal nerve functions in all patients .
significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) between control group and patients were shown for cold , warm and mechanical detection thresholds and for cold , heat and mechanical pain thresholds .
additionally , qst monitored recovery of nerve functions in all patients .
conclusion qst can be applied for non - invasive assessment of sensory nerve function ( abeta - , adelta - and c - fiber ) in the orofacial region and is useful in the diagnosis of trigeminal nerve disorders in patients .
background nerve injury - associated dysfunction is a frequently reappearing problem in dentistry .
after oral - and maxillofacial surgery , many patients suffer from paresthesia or sensory loss in the perioral region .
inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries are the leading cause of litigation and patient complaints in the field of oral surgery [ 1 ] and often an expert 's report with a precise evaluation of the severity is needed .
unfortunately , full comprehension of the underlying pathophysiology as well as an appropriate treatment seems to be missing [ 2 - 4 ] .
in clinical practice , diagnostic means are mostly limited to sharp - blunt discrimination both to diagnose sensory neuropathy and to examine its regeneration [ 5 ] .
an accurate , mechanism based diagnosis , which contains a comprehensive characterization of the somatosensory phenotype of the patients , however , is of utmost importance to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurosensory disturbance [ 6 ] .
there are qualified and non - invasive methods , e.g. recording of trigeminal somatosensory evoked potentials after stimulation of hairy skin or oral mucosa to quantify sensory dysfunction [ 7 - 13 ] or visualisation of brain activities by functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess sensory function [ 14,15 ] , but these methods are complex and extensive .
quantitative sensory testing ( qst ) is a reliable , non - invasive psychophysical test of large - and small - fiber sensory modalities [ 16 ] , which has become an implementable diagnostic tool [ 17 - 20 ] .
in order to afford comparable testing results , a standardized qst battery of 13 thermal and mechanical parameters has been developed [ 6 ] .
this qst approach has already been used in the face [ 21 ] , and normative data for extraoral and intraoral regions have been collected and calculated [ 22 ] .
the present study utilized this standardized qst battery , adapted to the trigeminal region , to test the sensory function of patients in the mental , infraorbital or lingual region following different interventions in oral and maxillofacial surgery .
regeneration characteristics of the investigated afferent fibres were analysed and ways of reducing the extent of the testing battery without affecting the informative value of the measurement were looked for .
the study also presents qst as a useful tool for expert 's reports .
methods orofacial sensory functions were investigated by psychophysical means in 60 volunteers ( 30 patients and 30 sex - and age matched control subjects ) covering an age range between 17 and 81 years ( 43.4 +/ - 19.4 years , mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd )) .
only patients who identified paresthesia postoperative were tested .
exclusion criteria were as follows : neurological or psychiatric history , diabetes , and medication within 48 h. all participants gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study according to the 1964 declaration of helsinki ( as amended by the 59th general assembly , 2008 ; http :// www.wma.net ) .
the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee .
thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds were determined by the quantitative sensory testing protocol ( qst ) that contained originally 13 parameters [ 6,21 ] : cdt , cold detection threshold ; wdt , warm detection threshold ; tsl , thermal sensory limen ; phs , paradoxical heat sensation ; cpt , cold pain threshold ; hpt , heat pain threshold ; mdt , mechanical detection threshold ; mpt , mechanical pain threshold ; mps , mechanical pain sensitivity ; all , allodynia ; wur , wind - up ratio ; vdt , vibration detection threshold ; ppt , pressure pain threshold .
quantitative sensory testing , qst thermal stimuli were applied by a computer controlled peltier type thermode with a stimulation area of 16 x 16 mm2 ( tsa - ii , medoc ltd. , israel ) .
starting from a baseline of 32degreesc , temperature decreased or increased by 1degreesc / s in order to determine cdt , wdt , cpt , and hpt .
volunteers were asked to press a computer mouse button as soon as they perceive the corresponding cold , warm , cold pain , or heat pain sensation .
after indicating perception , temperature of the thermode returned back to baseline .
the range of stimulation temperatures was between 0degreesc and 50degreesc .
cdt and wdt were specified as difference temperatures ( dt ) from baseline ( 32degreesc ) , cpt and hpt were defined as absolute temperatures ( degreesc ) [ 22 ] .
additionally , tsl was determined by alternating warm and cold stimuli. from the 32degreesc baseline , temperature increased until the indication of warm perception by the subject caused a decrease of temperature down to a cold perception and vice versa .
this alternating stimulus series was repeated three times from warm to cold perception and from cold to warm perception .
the mean difference between temperatures causing warm and cold perceptions was defined as tsl .
in the same test , possible paradoxical heat sensations ( phs , a subjective feeling of heat upon cooling ) during cold stimuli were registered .
mdt was measured with modified von frey filaments with forces of 0.08 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.7 , 1.6 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 150 , 260 , 600 , 1000 , 1800 , 3000 mn , ( touch - test sensory evaluators , north coast medical , ca , u.s.a. ) .
custom - made weighted pinprick stimulators with forces of 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 mn and a contact area of about 0.2 mm diameter were applied in order to measure mpt .
mdt and mpt were determined by the method of limits starting with a clearly noticeable filament of 16 mn and a usually non painful pinprick stimulator of 8 mn , respectively [ 23 ] .
mdt and mpt were defined as the geometric mean of five series of descending and ascending stimulus intensities .
mps and all were acquired by a series of 30 pinprick stimuli and 15 light tactile stimuli in a pseudo - randomized order .
six different pinprick stimuli ( 8 to 256 mn , see above ) were applied five times each .
light tactile stimulations were performed by a cotton wisp ( about 5 mn ) , a cotton wool tip fixed to an elastic strip ( about 100 mn ) , and a brush ( about 200 to 400 mn ; senselabtm brush 05 , somedic , sweden ) .
these three light tactile stimuli were applied three times each ( single stroke of 1 to 2 cm length ) intermingled with pinpricks .
subjects were asked to rate sensory sensations on a numerical scale : 0 defined as " no pain " , 1 to 100 defined as " painful " , 100 defined as " maximum imaginable pain " .
stimulus - response - functions for mps were calculated as geometric means of individual ratings .
the wind - up phenomenon was acquired by applying a single pinprick stimulus ( 128 mn , see above ) and a subsequent series of 10 pinprick stimuli with an inter - stimulus interval of 1 sec within a skin area of about 1 cm2 .
the subjects gave one pain rating each for the single stimulus and for the complete 1 hz stimulation series on a numerical rating scale ( cf. mps , see above ) .
this procedure was performed five times .
the mean pain rating of trains divided by the mean pain rating to single stimuli was calculated as wur .
vibration stimuli were applied by a 64 hz rydel - seifer tuning fork ( of033n , aesculap , tuttlingen , germany ) that was placed over maxilla ( infraorbital nerve area ) or mandible ( mental nerve area ) .
threshold measurement was performed three times on one side starting with maximum vibration amplitude .
as soon as the subject indicated disappearance of vibratory sensation the threshold was read on a scale ranging from 0 / 8 to 8 / 8 ( steps of 1 / 8 ) .
vdt was defined as the arithmetic mean of three runs .
ppt has to be conducted on the masticatory muscles with a force gage device ( fdn 200 , wagner instruments , u.s.a. ) .
the stimulator had a circular probe of 1.1 cm diameter that exerted pressures uo to 2000 kpa .
pressure was increased with 50 kpa / s until deep muscle pain was evoked .
ppt was defined as arithmetic mean of three stimuli .
patients were tested in innervation areas of infraorbital nerve ( hairy skin , upper lip ) ( 10 patients ) , mental nerve ( hairy skin , lower lip ) ( 10 patients ) , and lingual nerve ( glabrous skin , anterior lateral two - thirds of the tongue ) ( 10 patients ) 1 week , 4 weeks , 7 weeks and 10 weeks following different interventions in oral - and maxillofacial surgery ( zygomatic fracture surgery , dysgnathia surgery , third molar surgery , apicoectomy , implant insertion ) .
in the first intervention 1 week after surgery , not only the operated side ( test side ) , but also the contralateral side ( control side ) was tested .
the contralateral side was tested first .
the control group underwent the same tests on both sides once .
qst data on both sides were obtained within one experimental session , which took ~ 1 h , including a demonstration of each test at a practice area .
subjects laid on a couch and kept their eyes closed throughout the qst procedure .
all investigations were performed by the same trained examiner .
in infraorbital and mental regions 12 parameters were determined ( cdt , wdt , tsl , phs , cpt , hpt , mdt , mpt , mps , all , wur , vdt ) .
as the measurement of ppt was painful for the patient in many cases , this parameter was omitted .
on the tongue qst protocol was adapted to seven parameters : cdt , wdt , tsl , phs , cpt , hpt , mdt .
tests were conducted within the infraorbital nerve territory on hairy skin of upper lip , within the mental nerve territory on hairy skin of lower lip , and within the lingual nerve territory on the anterior lateral two - thirds of tongue mucosa .
for all thermal qst parameters friedman repeated measures anova ( chisquare = chi2 , p value ) and subsequent student - newman - keuls test ( q , p value ) were performed .
correlations between quantitative sensory variables and age were analyzed by pearson 's correlation analysis .
level of significance was set to p < 0.05 .
statistical analysis was performed by the software sigmastat 3.0 ( spss inc. , u.s.a. ) .
results 60 participants were tested in innervation areas of infraorbital nerves ( hairy skin , upper lip ) ( 10 patients and 10 control subjects ) , mental nerves ( hairy skin , lower lip ) ( 10 patients and 10 control subjects ) , and lingual nerves ( glabrous skin , tongue ) ( 10 patients and 10 control subjects ) .
the patients were tested 1 week , 4 weeks , 7 weeks and 10 weeks following different interventions in oral and maxillofacial surgery ( zygomatic fracture surgery , dysgnathia surgery , third molar surgery , apicoectomy , implant insertion ) .
one week after surgery , both control and test side were investigated in the patient group .
the volunteers of the control group were tested once , in the same innervation area as their respective patient .
the values of the control group were all in normal range .
the values of the control side ( patient group ) were all in normal range , too .
there were no significant differences between the values of the control group and the control side values of the patient group .
differences between control data and test data 1 week after surgery significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) between control group and test side 1 week after surgery were shown for cdt ( chi2 = 48.530 , p < 0.001 ) , wdt ( chi2 = 89.310 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) , tsl ( chi2 = 67.097 , p < 0.001 ) , cpt ( chi2 = 24.144 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 2 ) , hpt ( chi2 = 36.808 , p < 0.001 ) , mdt ( chi2 = 76.096 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 3 ) and mpt ( chi2 = 21.222 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 4 ) .
no significant differences between the median values of the measurements were shown for phs , mps , all , wur and vdt ( table 1 ) .

differences between control data and test data 4 weeks , 7 weeks and 10 weeks after surgery cdt on the test side still differed significantly from the control group 4 weeks after surgery , but there were no significant differences between control group and test side in week 7 and week 10 .
wdt improved as well , but the differences between the test side and the control group were significant throughout the period of examination .
within 7 weeks , values within the normal range were achieved ( wdt after 7 weeks : 3.47degreesc ) .
tsl and mdt test side values differed from the control group values 4 and 7 weeks after surgery .
there were no differences 10 weeks after surgery .
cpt , hpt test side values did not achieve the level of the control group within the period of examination .
significant differences were persistent up to and inclusively week 10 .
after the first two qst investigations 4 weeks after surgery , no more significant differences between control and test side were shown for mpt .
in conclusion , cdt and mpt values converged to the values of the control group the fastest , followed by mdt and tsl .
wdt , cpt and hpt test side values still differed significantly from the control group values 10 weeks after surgery , whereas values in normal range were achieved .
differences among test side values mpt decreased only within the first 4 weeks .
this is shown by the significant difference between the test side values 1 week after surgery and those 4 weeks after surgery .
as the level of the control side values was already achieved then , no further decrease was detected .
there were neither significant differences between the mpt test side values of week 4 and week 7 , nor between week 7 and week 10 .
cdt , hpt and mdt decreased steadily from one investigation to the next , which is shown by the fact that the test side values 1 week after surgery differed significantly from the test side values 4 weeks after surgery and those of week 4 differed significantly from those of week 7 , respectively .
there were no significant differences between the test side values 7 weeks after surgery and those 10 weeks after surgery , as the level of the control side values was achieved .
wdt also decreased from one investigation to the next .
wdt test side values 1 week after surgery differed significantly from those 4 weeks after surgery , and those 4 weeks after surgery differed from wdt test side values 7 weeks after surgery .
wdt test side values 7 weeks after surgery differed significantly from those 10 weeks after surgery .
tsl decreased steadily from one investigation to the next , which is shown by the fact that the test side values 1 week after surgery differed significantly from the test side values 4 weeks after surgery and those of week 4 differed significantly from those of week 7 .
there were significant differences between the test side values 7 weeks after surgery and those 10 weeks after surgery , too .
cpt , however , decreased only from the first investigation to the second .
the values of week 1 differed significantly from those of week 4 .
then , the decrease stopped .
there were neither significant differences between week 4 and week 7 , nor between week 7 and week 10 .
correlations between qst parameters and age on week 1 and 4 , there was a positive correlation between cdt and age ( figure 5 ) .

the lines show linear regression curves ( upper line : 1 week after surgery , lower line : 4 weeks after surgery ) .
discussion the applied qst battery was introduced as a reliable method to investigate sensory function and was recommended as " gold standard " by the german research network on neuropathic pain ( dfns ) [ 6 ] , but patient data in the perioral region were still missing .
in a literature review , however , it is stated that sensory function was still not uniformly tested and presented , making a comparison of data impossible and highlighting the need for uniform testing methodology [ 24 ] .
therefore , normative qst data in clinically relevant perioral regions ( extraoral and intraoral ) were collected and effects of age , gender , and anatomical sites on qst parameters were analyzed [ 22 ] .
the present study is based on this study and extends it with data , which have been collected from patients after oral and maxillofacial surgery .
a previous study said that reproducibility was better with only one examiner involved [ 18 ] and another study showed poor reproducibility of thermal perception thresholds [ 25 ] , which may very well be related to the larger number of investigators involved [ 16 ] .
therefore , in the present study only one person was instated to do all the measurements .
inclusion of a control group was recommended by another qst - study [ 26 ] .
the present study shows that control side values may did not differ from the control group values .
the measurements were finished 10 weeks after surgery , because the most results did not show differences between the test side values 7 and 10 weeks after surgery , and the level of normative data was achieved .
as most nerves with axonal injury show incomplete sensory recovery 1 year after surgery [ 27 ] , it is assumed that in the present study no axonal injury , but pure demyelinating injuries have occurred .
complete recovery of pure demyelinating injuries after 2 to 4 months corresponds to literature [ 27,28 ] .
another explanation for temporary impairment of nerve function could be postoperative injury .
a study of a rabbit model showed that functional changes induced by compression are likely due to intraneural edema , which could subsequently result in impairment of nerve function [ 29 ] .
cdt and mpt reflecting the function in small myelinated adelta fibres [ 20,30 - 32 ] converged to the values of the control group the fastest , followed by tsl and mdt .
mdt reflects myelinated abeta fibres [ 30 ] .
wdt reflecting the function in c fibres [ 33 ] , still differed significantly from the control group values 10 weeks after surgery , whereas values in normal range were achieved , though .
these findings do not correlate with a study , in which the improvement of function in small unmyelinated nerve fibres came within 6 weeks , but the improvement of function in small myelinated fibres was not found before 12 months after surgery [ 34 ] .
previous qst - studies , in contrast to the present study , considered the light touch detection threshold as the most sensitive and most useful test in the follow - up of recovery [ 24,35 ] .
these different results may be due to the different testing areas and testing methods , making comparisons impossible and underlining the need of a uniform testing method .
yekta et al. showed an age dependency of quantitative sensory parameters in healthy probands , which demonstrated impairment of sensory function with increasing age [ 22 ] .
the present study found that older patients tend to be less sensitive than younger patients also in the postoperative stadium .
the testing protocol with 13 parameters has already been considered as too extensive by other studies [ 36,37 ] .
the present study indicates that 7 of 13 parameters ( cdt , mpt , tsl , wdt , cpt , hpt and mdt ) are necessary to examine sensory function after oral - and maxillofacial surgery .
the development of these parameters would take about 1 / 2 hour .
experimental studies of the effects of compression on the pig cauda equine have shown that the recovery of nerve function depends on the magnitude and duration of compression [ 38,39 ] , but may depend on many more various factors like nerve fibre size [ 34 ] , grade of injury and surgical technique [ 37 ] .
to gain better information on intraoperative risk factors , postoperative complications and sensory recovery , a uniform testing method is needed .
for this reason , the implementation of qst should be realized at least at university centers and dental clinics .
for the measurement of thermal parameters , the acquisition of a computer controlled thermode is required , and for the measurement of mpt and mdt merely a set of pinprick stimulators and von frey filaments is needed .
at rwth aachen university , qst is already used as an approved instrument to give a neutral expert 's opinion in trials .
conclusion in conclusion , somatosensory nerve fiber functions can be assessed in extraoral and intraoral sites by qst .
the presented study facilitates the role of qst in diagnosis and monitoring of orofacial nerve fiber dysfunctions .
it uses qst in extraoral and intraoral regions following different interventions in oral and maxillofacial surgery .
as this qst battery takes 1 hour of testing , it is too time - consuming to realize integration into clinical practice .
this study shows that the extent of the testing battery can be reduced to 7 parameters , without affecting the informative value of the measurement .

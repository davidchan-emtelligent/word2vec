background the structural and biochemical features of the tymbal ( sound - producing ) muscle of cicadas were studied by x - ray diffraction and immunochemistry , and compared with those of flight muscles from the same species .
results the x - ray diffraction pattern of the tymbal muscle was very similar to that of the dorsal longitudinal flight muscle : in both muscles , the 2,0 equatorial reflection is much more intense than the 1,1 , indicating that both muscles have a flight muscle - type myofilament lattice .
in rigor , the first myosin / actin layer line reflection was finely lattice - sampled , indicating that the contractile proteins are arranged with a crystalline regularity as in asynchronous flight muscles .
in contrast , the diffraction pattern from the tensor muscle , which modulates the sound by stressing the tymbal , did not show signs of such high regularity or flight muscle - type filament lattice .
electrophoretic patterns of myofibrillar proteins were also very similar in the tymbal muscle and flight muscles , but distinct from those from the tensor or leg muscles .
the antibody raised against the flight muscle - specific troponin - i isoform reacted with an 80 - kda band from both tymbal and flight muscles , but with none of the bands from the tensor or leg muscles .
conclusion the close similarities of the structural and biochemical profiles between the tymbal and the flight muscles suggest the possibility that a set of flight muscle - specific proteins is diverted to the tymbal muscle to meet its demand for fast , repetitive contractions .

flight muscles , especially those of bees and flies have highly specialized functions ; i.e. , they are asynchronous ( there is no one - to - one correspondence between motor nerve impulses and wing beats ) and are characterized by the function of stretch activation [ 1 , 2 ] .
the asynchronous flight muscle has a highly specialized regular structure ([ 3 ] and references therein ) .
more primitive winged insects have synchronous flight muscles ( one nerve impulse elicits a single wing - beat ) , but their structures are more specialized than those of body muscles .
cicadas are among the insects with synchronous flight muscles , and are exhibit the capacity of producing loud songs .
such sounds are generated by a structure called the tymbal , a chitinous plate located on both sides of the first abdominal segment .
a tymbal usually has a number of ribs , which produce a series of clicking sounds when it is deformed by a single twitch of the tymbal muscle .
most of the abdominal volume of a male cicada is filled with air , and the entire abdomen acts as a resonator [ 4 - 6 ] .
the tymbal muscle is a v - shaped , conspicuous presence in the first abdominal segment ( fig. 1 ) , and its developmental / evolutional origin is believed to be the dorsoventral muscle associated with each segment [ 5 ] .
its visual appearance ( color , fiber diameter , etc. ) is similar to that of major flight muscles .
its ultrastructure has been investigated using electron microscopy [ 7 - 9 ] in the species platypleura capitata , cyclochila australasiae , and magicicada cassini .
micrographs have shown that the myofilament lattice structure of the tymbal muscle is identical to that of major flight muscles , i.e. , the myosin : actin filament number ratio is 1:3 and an actin filament is located midway between two neighboring myosin filaments ( fig. 2 ) .
functionally , tymbal muscles are generally synchronous ; nine genera of cicadas are proven to have synchronous tymbal muscles [ 8 ] .
however , the tymbal muscle of an oriental species , platypleura capitata is inferred ( although not directly demonstrated ) to be asynchronous [ 8 ] , as are the flight muscles of higher - order insects .
it would be very peculiar for an asynchronous muscle to occur elsewhere , while the flight muscles remain synchronous .
although the wing - beat frequencies of cicadas are in the range manageable by synchronous flight muscles ( 30 - 50 hz [ 8 ]) , having asynchronous tymbal muscles may be beneficial for supporting much higher sound vibration frequencies ( 234 - 389 hz [ 8 ]) .
nonetheless , the contraction frequency of the tymbal muscle is still expected to be below 100 hz due to the multiple sound - producing mechanism described above. fig. 1 photographs tymbal muscles and flight muscles .

the larger dots represent the myosin filaments , and the smaller dots , the actin filaments .
the area marked by the lines represents the unit cell , which contains one myosin filament here we used x - ray diffraction and immunochemistry to study the flight and tymbal muscles of a number of cicada species , to obtain further insights into the structure and function of these muscles .
the species used include platypleura kaempferi , closely related to p. capitata .
in addition to the filament number ratio , x - ray diffraction can provide many other pieces of structural information about the sarcomeric structure , such as the helical symmetry of myofilaments and the regularity of protein arrangement , and their changes under different physiological conditions ( for review see [ 10 ]) .
notably , asynchronous flight muscles of the giant waterbug and other species are known to exhibit a crystalline order of contractile proteins , a feature that manifests as discrete reflection spots in the diffraction pattern ([ 11 ] and references therein ) .
this point is important , as x - ray diffraction may discriminate between the asynchronous tymbal muscle ( if it is truly so ) and the flight muscle of cicadas ( however note that no report to date has demonstrated that the latter is asynchronous ) .
the contractile proteins were characterized by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting , using an antibody ( mac143 ) raised against the flight muscle - specific isoform of troponin - i ( also called troponin - h because of its unusually large molecular mass [ 12 ]) .
its large molecular mass is due to its long pro - ala - rich c - terminal extension , to which the antibody is expected to react .
in diptera , the sequence is known to have translocated to the c - terminus of tropomyosin [ 13 - 16 ] .
the antibody is known to react with the flight muscle proteins of all insect species examined to date , irrespective of whether they are asynchronous [ 17 ] .
in addition , some mechanical measurements were made on the skinned muscle fibers of the flight and tymbal muscles , to test whether they exhibit stretch - activation , a characteristic mechanical feature of an asynchronous flight muscle .
results in the present study , muscle preparations were obtained from several cicada species , and this is mainly due to the limited availability of each species .
generally the basic molecular architecture , such as the sarcomeric structure , does not vary among species in a single family , or even within a single order of animals .
thus , the diffraction patterns and immunochemical results from cicada muscle fibers are all expected to be similar for the three species used .
because of this , only the results from meimuna oparifera are described here unless otherwise stated ( for the results of other species see additional files 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
x - ray diffraction patterns the x - ray pattern recorded from the muscles of meimuna opariferea are shown in fig. 3. the patterns in fig. 3a and b were taken from the indirect flight muscle ( dorsal longitudinal muscle , dlm ) .
although the cicada flight muscles are synchronous , the arrangement of the contractile proteins of the dlm is fairly regular , as is evident from the spot - like appearance of the 1st actin / myosin layer line reflection ( layer - line reflections arise from the helical arrangement of actin or myosin molecules on the myofilaments ) ( see also fig. 4b ) .
this spot - like appearance is called lattice sampling , and the intensity is observed only in the position indexable to the planes of the myofilament hexagonal lattice .
lattice sampling is conspicuous in asynchronous flight muscles , and also often occurs in higher - order layer - line reflections. fig. 3 x - ray diffraction patterns of the flight and tymbal muscles of meimuna oparifera .

the scale on the right of a represents the d - spacing in nm. note that in rigor , the actin layer lines are enhanced , and the first myosin / actin layer line is finely lattice - sampled in flight and tymbal muscles but not in tensor fig. 4 intensity profiles of the equatorial ( a ) and the first myosin / actin layer line ( b ) reflections , taken from the diffraction patterns from meimuna oparifera in fig. 3. in a , the red curve is the gaussian fit of the 1,0 reflection after subtraction of the background , approximated as a single exponential decay function ( gray ) .
the blue curves ( almost hidden underneath the red curves ) are the observed intensity profile after subtraction of the background .
the green curve is the residual remaining after the gaussian fit of the 1,0 is further subtracted .
the red vertical bar is the center of the gaussian fit of the 1,0 , and the blue and green vertical bars are the positions of the 1,1 and 2,0 reflections , respectively , calculated from the position of the 1,0 reflection .
the leftmost peak is the edge of the beamstop .
note that the 2,0 reflection is much more intense than the 1,1 in flight and tymbal muscles except for the tensor in the dlm , the lattice sampling is already present in the relaxed state ( fig. 3a ) , but is more pronounced in rigor ( fig. 3b ) , indicating that the rigor linkage between the actin and myosin filaments increases the regularity of protein arrangement in the sarcomere .
the lattice sampling is much weaker in other insects with synchronous flight muscles , such as lepidopterans ( unpublished ) .
in the equatorial reflections of the dlm , the 2,0 reflection is more intense than the 1,1 reflection ( fig. 4a ) , indicating that this muscle has a flight - muscle type lattice structure ( myosin : actin filament number ratio = 1:3 ; see fig. 2 and [ 18 ]) as in asynchronous flight muscles .
although not recorded from m. oparifera , the diffraction patterns from the basalar muscle from other species ( additional file 1 : figure s1 & additional file 3 : figure s3 ) are very similar to those from the dlm ; the 1st layer line reflection is sampled in the same way , and in the equator , the 2,0 reflection is stronger than the 1,1 .
therefore it is considered to have the same sarcomeric architecture as the dlm .
the diffraction patterns from the tymbal muscle are also very similar to those from the dlm ( fig. 3c , d ) .
the 1st layer line is clearly lattice - sampled ( fig. 4b ) , and the 2,0 is stronger than the 1,1 , indicating that it also has a flight muscle - type filament lattice ( fig. 4a ) .
this is also true for other cicada species , including p. kaempferi ( see additional files 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
this confirms observations from electron microscopy ( for references see introduction ) .
although the tymbal muscle of p. capitata ( a species closely related to p. kaempferi ) is inferred to be asynchronous [ 8 ] , the lattice sampling in the layer line from p. kaempferi is limited to the first layer line , and there is no evidence that the structural regularity of the tymbal muscle is higher than that of the synchronous dlm ( additional files 1 : figure s1 ) .
the values of d - spacing for the 1,0 lattice plane in rigor were very similar for the three muscles .
they were 47.9 , 47.2 , and 47.8 nm for the dlm , basalar ( p. kaempferi ) and tymbal , respectively .
diffraction patterns were also taken from the tensor muscle ( fig. 3e , f ) .
the tensor muscle is to increase the curvature of the tymbal , thus modulating the tone of the cicada songs [ 4 ] .
unlike in the flight muscles and the tymbal muscle , the lattice sampling on the first layer line is not evident ( fig. 4b ) , indicating a low structural regularity .
in the equator , the 1,1 and 2,0 reflections are not separated , but it is evident that the intensity of the 2,0 is comparable to that of the 1,1 ( fig. 4a ) , suggesting that its lattice structure is of body - muscle type ( 1 : 5 or 1 : 6 ) , not the flight muscle type ( 1 : 3 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the d - spacing for the 1,0 plane was 49.5 nm and was apparently greater than those for flight and tymbal muscles , in agreement with the 1:5 or 1:6 lattice that has a greater d - spacing than the 1:3 lattice [ 19 ] .
immunochemistry samples were taken from flight , tymbal and other non - flight muscles , and were subjected to sds - page and immunoblotting .
the cbb - stained sds - page pattern and the result of immunoblotting are shown in fig. 5a and b , respectively ( samples of terpnosia vacua were loaded on the same gel ) .
the patterns for the flight muscles , including indirect dlm and dvm , and direct basalar and subalar muscles , are identical ( except for the 3ax muscle , also known as the wing - folding muscle ) , indicating that an identical set of protein isoforms are expressed in these muscles .
they all have a ~ 80 kda band that cross - reacts with mac143 , except for the 3ax , and this pattern of reaction is identical to that for a beetle [ 19 ] .
mac143 is an antibody raised against the flight muscle specific troponin - i ( troponin - h ) isoform ( fig. 5b ) .
some lower molecular weight bands ( fainter in the cbb - stained pattern ) also cross - reacted with this antibody , and they may be splicing variants or degraded products .
the sds - page pattern for the tymbal muscle is very similar to those of flight muscles , except for some low - molecular weight bands between 15 and 20 kda .
its 80 - kda band also cross - reacts with mac143 .
the patterns for the 3ax muscle , tensor and leg muscles are similar to each other , and they lack the 80 - kda band that cross - reacts with mac143 .
the tymbal muscle specimens from other cicada species also had a ~ 80 kda band that reacted with mac143 ( additional file 4 : figure s4 ). fig. 5 sds gel electrophoretic and immunoblot patterns of the muscle fibers from terpnosia vacua and meimuna oparifera .

isolated glycerinated muscle fibers from the dlm or the tymbal muscle were activated at pca = 4.0 and step stretches ( amplitude , 2 - 3 % of the just - taut length , lo ) were applied ( fig. 6 ) .
although this amplitude of stretch was greater than usually needed to elicit fully stretch - activated forces in asynchronous flight muscle fibers ( e.g. , [ 20 , 21 ]) , it elicited only a small stretch - activated force in cicada dlm fibers ( fig. 6b , gray arrows ) .
this is very similar to the responses to stretch of other synchronous flight muscles [ 17 ] .
the mechanical response of the tymbal muscle fibers was not very different from that of the dlm ( fig. 6d ) .
at the repetition rate of 5 hz ( fig. 6d , middle trace ) , there was no obvious stretch - activated force , but at 10 hz , a small stretch - activated force was recognized ( fig. 6d , bottom trace ) , and its rate of rise was faster than that for the dlm ( half rise time = 7.4 ms vs. 20.2 ms for dlm ) .
this may indicate that the contractile proteins of the tymbal muscle exhibit faster kinetics than those of the dlm. fig. 6 mechanical response to the repeated stretches / releases of the calcium - activated dlm ( a , b ) and the tymbal ( c , d ) muscle fibers from platypleura kaempferi .

the gap between the two horizontal gray lines ( indicated by arrows ) is the amplitude of the stretch - activated force discussion in this study , the structural , biochemical and mechanical features of the tymbal muscle of cicada were compared with those of the major flight muscle .
the results show that , with regard to all three aspects , the tymbal muscle is very similar to ( but not identical with ) the major flight muscle .
fine structure electron microscopy studies have shown that the tymbal muscle has a flight muscle - type myofilament lattice arrangement [ 7 - 9 ] .
the most important finding is that the arrangement of the contractile proteins in the sarcomere of both flight and tymbal muscles is considerably regular , as evidenced by the crystalline sampling of the first myosin / actin layer line reflection , especially in rigor .
this observation agrees with the previous end - on diffraction studies of myofibrils , showing that in both flight and tymbal muscles of cicadas , long - range crystallinity ( i.e. , the lattice plane orientation is preserved along the entire length of the myofibril ) was observed [ 22 ] .
this is unusual for insect groups with synchronous flight muscle .
also , the tymbal muscle is the first example of non - flight insect muscle that is demonstrated to have such high structural regularity .
in the present study the diffraction patterns were also recorded from the basalar muscle , one of the direct flight muscles .
the basalar and subalar muscles of the cicadas are not well - developed , and it is unlikely that they provide actual driving force of the wings .
nevertheless , the basalar of the cicada is shown here to have the same structure as the dlm .
in beetles , in which the basalar is very well developed and is stretch activatable [ 2 ] , both basalar and subalar muscles are shown to have structures identical to those of the dlm and dvm [ 19 ] .
biochemical features troponin - i , one of the three troponin subunits , usually has a molecular mass of ~ 25 kda .
however , the flight muscle - specific troponin - i isoform ( troponin - h ) has a long pro - ala - rich c - terminal extension [ 12 ] , and because of this , its apparent molecular mass on the gel is 75 - 80 kda .
the antibody against this extension is known to cross - react with the proteins from all winged insect groups examined , synchronous or asynchronous [ 17 ] , and in diptera , this extension is found in the c - terminus of tropomyosin , instead of troponin i [ 13 - 16 ] .
the extension has repeating gesgagkt motifs or the like , and it exists in the most primitive winged insects [ 17 ] .
the fact that this extension exists in tropomyosin in all of dipterans , a monophyletic group , suggests that the sequence has translocated from troponin - i from tropomyosin in the ancestral from of diptera .
the role of the extension is still to be investigated , but in fruit fly , it is known to bind gamma - glutathione s - transferase ( gst [ 15 ]) , and in bumblebee , the enzymatic removal of the extension leads to a loss of flight muscle - type 1:3 lattice integrity [ 23 ] .
the gst that binds to the extension is suggested to have a protective role against deleterious effects of oxidative stress due to the high mitochondrial activity of the flight muscle [ 24 ] .
the extension is not essential for the mechanical function of flight muscle [ 18 , 25 ] .
here we have shown that the cicada flight muscles also express the 80 - kda protein , except for the 3ax muscle .
an important finding here is that the 80 kda protein is also expressed in the tymbal muscle .
initially , the tymbal muscle was thought to be of flight - muscle origin , but later it was rather regarded to be a specialized form of the dorso - ventral muscle that exists in every abdominal segment [ 5 ] .
it is possible that fast vibrational contractions are required for both flight and sound production , and it is beneficial to express the flight muscle - specific proteins in the tymbal muscle as a result of evolutional adaptation .
the homopteran insects are generally known to communicate with vibrations ( for smaller species they are not airborne but are transmitted by substrates such as leaves ; e.g. , [ 26 ]) , and in a planthopper nilaparvata lugens , the dorso - ventral muscle of the first abdominal segment ( responsible for vibration ) is known to express another flight muscle - specific protein , flightin [ 27 ] .
mechanical properties although the flight muscles of cicadas are synchronous , the possibility of asynchrony has been suggested for platypleura capitata [ 8 ] .
this would be an interesting first example of synchronous and asynchronous versions of an identical muscle occurring in a single family of insects , and if such is the case , a higher structural order and a greater capacity of stretch activation would be expected for the asynchronous version .
here we compared the structure and function of the flight and tymbal muscles of closely related p. kaempferi , but their fine structure are found to be very similar , and no conspicuous stretch activation was observed in the tymbal muscle fibers .
asynchronous flight muscle fibers usually show higher resting stiffness , because of the well - developed c - filament that connects between the thick filaments and the z - line .
however , the tymbal muscle fibers of p. kaempferi showed only low resting stiffness ( data not shown ) .
therefore , there is no evidence that suggest the asynchrony of its tymbal muscle .
the report that the tymbal muscle of a brazilian cicada , fidicina , is stretch - activatable presents a puzzling case [ 7 ] .
the experiments were performed in a phosphate - buffered solution that is known to increase the stretch - activated force in vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers [ 28 ] .
therefore it is unclear whether there is a real discrepancy between their and our results .
evolution of muscle structure and function in cicada and related insects the order hemiptera is unique in that it contains both species with asynchronous and synchronous flight muscles .
synchrony / asynchrony of the flight muscles within hemiptera has been extensively studied by cullen [ 29 ] , purely on the structural basis .
according to this study , the species belonging to suborder heteroptera ( true bugs ) have exclusively asynchronous flight muscles , while suborder auchenorrhyncha ( containing cicada - like insects with highly variable body sizes ) is a mixture of families with synchronous and asynchronous flight muscles .
the flight muscles of cicadas ( cicadidae ) are classified as synchronous , while the flight muscles of leafhoppers ( jassidae or cicadellidae ) are classified as asynchronous .
this is supported by our observation that the flight muscle of a cicadellid , bothrogonia , is highly crystalline ( iwamoto et al. , 2006 [ 22 ]) , and is unmistakably stretch - activatable ( unpublished ) .
the question is , synchronous cicadas or asynchronous cicadellids , which come first in the course of evolution .
insects of suborder auchenorrhyncha are generally known to communicate by vibration [ 26 ] , and for this cicadellids have a " striated tymbal homologous to that of cicadas " , and a set of less - specialized ( as compared with cicadas ) dorsoventral muscles are the main sound - producing muscles [ 5 ] .
as discussed by pringle [ 5 ] , the missing link that connects cicadellid insects and cicadas may be the primitive australian cicadas of the genus tettigarcta , which lacks the resonant air sac [ 5 ] but communicates via substrate - borne vibrations [ 30 ] .
if modern cicadas occurred from small , asynchronous cicadellid - like insects through the stage of tettigarcta , this means that the asynchrony was lost at some point of body size enlargement , as the reduced wing - beat frequency does not require asynchrony .
at the same time , they may have developed a resonant air sac for air - borne communication , for which the tymbal muscle accordingly became specialized .
this evolutionary process would explain why the structure of the cicada flight muscle is more regular than that of the synchronous flight muscles in other insect orders .
because the set of genes for ordered sarcomeric structure is already present , it may be readily diverted to the tymbal muscle .
according to curren [ 29 ] , insects belonging to some other families of auchenorrhyncha smaller than cicadas , such as cercopoidea and membracidae , also have synchronous flight muscles .
although this old study , based solely on structural characteristics , should be re - evaluated , it would not be surprising that they are synchronous , as they are generally larger than the average cicadellids and their wing - beat frequencies are probably below 100 hz. it would be interesting to know if they also have evolved from asynchronous ancestors .
in his lecture in 1980 , pringle [ 31 ] stated " one thing which does seem to be clear is that once the asynchronous mechanism had developed in a group of insects , the reverse evolution never occurs " .
if the evolutionary scenario described above is correct , however , it would represent the first known example of such reverse evolution .
conclusion the present study reveals that the sarcomeric structure of the cicada tymbal muscle is as regular as that of the flight muscle , and the tymbal muscle expresses the flight muscle - specific troponin - i isoform .
the close similarities of the structural and biochemical profiles between the tymbal and the flight muscles suggest a possibility that a set of flight muscle - specific proteins are diverted to the tymbal muscle to meet the demand for its fast , repetitive contractions .
methods materials four species of cicadas ( terpnosia vacua , meimuna oparifera , platypleura kaempferi and graptopsaltria nigrofuscata ) were collected in or near the campus of spring - 8 .
flight muscle and other muscles were isolated from these insects , and were stored in a 50 % mixture of glycerol and a relaxing solution at - 20 degreesc until use .
a few days before x - ray recordings , bundles of 3 - 4 muscle fibers were isolated from each muscle , and seven bundles were mounted on a pair of ceramic chips , as described previously [ 32 ] .
solutions for x - ray measurements , the muscle fibers were placed either in a relaxing solution or a rigor solution , and their compositions are basically the same as in previous studies [ 33 , 34 ] .
the relaxing solution contained 80 mm k - propionate , 20 mm imidazole , 10 mm egta , 4 mm atp , 5 mm mgcl2 , 20 mm phosphocreatine , and 400 u / ml creatine phosphokinase ( c3755 , sigma - aldrich ) ( ph = 7.2 ) .
the rigor solution contained 120 mm k - propionate , 20 mm imidazole , and 5 mm each of edta and egta ( ph = 7.2 ) .
for mechanical measurements , the fibers were activated in the presence of calcium ( 10.1 mm total , pca = 4.0 ) in addition to the components of the relaxing solution .
prior to activation , the fibers were immersed in a pre - activating solution with a reduced concentration of egta ( 0.5 mm ) .
x - ray diffraction recordings static x - ray diffraction patterns were recorded at the bl45xu beamline of spring - 8 [ 35 ] .
the detector was a cooled ccd ( charge - coupled device ) camera ( c4792 - 98 , hamamatsu photonics ) in combination with a 6 - in. image intensifier ( vp5445 - mod , hamamatsu photonics ) .
the exposure time was 2 s , and up to 40 diffraction patterns were recorded from a single set of muscle fiber bundles .
the fibers were moved along their fiber axis by 100 mum after each exposure to reduce radiation damage .
diffraction patterns were first taken in the relaxing solution , and then in the rigor solution at 5 degreesc ) .
the diffraction data were acquired by using the program hipic ( hamamatsu photonics ) .
the diffraction patterns taken from the same set of fiber bundles were summed , and the four quadrants were averaged , and the background scattering was subtracted as described previously [ 20 , 36 ] .
gel electrophoresis and immunochemistry the muscle samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) by using 5 - 20 % gradient gels ( atto corporation ) and the bands were stained with coomassie brilliant blue ( cbb ) .
very approximately 0.1 mg of tissue was loaded to each lane for cbb staining , after the samples were heated to 95 degreesc in a sample buffer containing sds .
for immunoblotting , the amount of sample in each lane was 1 / 10 of that for cbb staining , and an antibody raised against flight muscle - specific troponin i ( troponin h ) ( mac143 , abcam , 1:5000 dilution ) , and the reaction was detected by using an anti - rat secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( a6066 , sigma - aldrich , 1:5000 dilution ) and a bcip / nbt solution ( b6404 , sigma - aldrich ) , as described [ 19 ] .
the gels and the blotted membranes were scanned by an optical scanner ( 8800f , canon inc. ) .
mechanical measurements the calcium - activated force and the responses to stretch of the muscle fibers were measured in the activating solution , as described earlier [ 20 ] .
repetitive square pulses of stretch ( 2 - 3 % fiber length , 5 or 10 hz ) were applied at the plateau of isometric calcium - activated force ( pca = 4.0 , 20 degreesc ) , and the force and length signals were digitized by using a data acquisition system ( usb - 6210 , national instruments ) for further analysis .
the acquisition program was the one provided with the system .

introduction : due to the complex anatomy of the root canal system and high surface tension of common root canal irrigants ( rci ) , conducting an investigation on rcis containing surfactants is a priority .
the aim of this in vitro study was to verify the antibacterial potential of rci with low surface tension in root canals infected with enterococcus faecalis ( e. faecalis ) .
methods and materials : thirty - five extracted human maxillary anterior teeth were prepared and inoculated with e. faecalis for 60 days .
after root canal preparation , the teeth were randomly divided to one positive and one negative control groups and 5 experimental groups : hypoclean / tetraclean na , hypoclean , tetraclean , naocl / tetraclean and naocl .
bacterial growth was observed by turbidity of culture medium and then measured using a uv spectrophotometer .
data were analyzed in three time intervals ( pre - instrumentation and , 20 min and 72 h after canal preparation ) using the anova and post hoc tukey 's tests .
the level of significance was set at 0.05 .
results : the results indicated the presence of e. faecalis in all post - irrigation samples irrespective of the rci .
however , the optical densities in both post - irrigation periods showed bacterial reduction and significant differences between groups .
conclusion : rci with low surface tension showed antibacterial potential in e. faecalis infected roots .
key words enterococcus faecalis hypoclean sodium hypochlorite tetraclean introduction the causative role of microorganisms in the initiation and progression of pulp and periapical diseases is the proved fact in endodontics [ 1 - 3 ] .
elimination of microorganisms from the infected root canal system is a complicated task involving the use of various instrumentation techniques , irrigation regimens and sometimes intracanal medicaments .
mechanical instrumentation alone does not guarantee a bacteria - free root canal system especially considering its complexity [ 4 ] .
on the other hand , in vitro and clinical evidences have shown that mechanical instrumentation leaves significant portions of the root canal walls untouched [ 5 ] and complete elimination of the bacteria only through mechanical instrumentation is unlikely [ 6 ] .
any pulp tissue left in the root canals can potentially serve as a nutrient source for the remaining microorganisms .
furthermore , tissue remnants also impede the antimicrobial effects of root canal irrigants and medicaments [ 7 ] .
therefore , specific root canal irrigants ( rci ) with tissue - dissolving and antibacterial abilities are necessary .
sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) is the most common rci with excellent antibacterial and tissue dissolving abilities .
one of the major drawbacks of naocl is the high surface tension , that limits its penetration into irregularities of the root canal system such as fins , isthmi and dentinal tubules [ 8 ] .
adding a surfactant to naocl can resolve this problem .
figure 1 a scanning electron microscopy image of 60 - day positive control samples with enterococcus faecalis ( 5000x magnification hypoclean ( ogna laboratori farmaceutici , milano , italy ) is a detergent - based endodontic irrigant composed of 5.25 % naocl and two detergents ( cetrimide and polypropylene glycol ) [ 9 ] .
there are very few studies on the antibacterial activity of hypoclean [ 9 - 12 ] .
hypoclean keeps its substantivity for up to 4 weeks [ 11 ] .
recently , it has been revealed that hypoclean was the most effective agent against candida .
albicans , pseudomonas aeruginosa and lactobacillus casei , in vitro [ 12 ] .
tetraclean ( ogna laboratori , farmaceutici , milano , italy ) is a new combination that contains doxycycline and detergents ( citric acid and polypropylene glycol ) [ 13 - 15 ] .
like biopure mtad ( dentsply , tulsa dental , tulsa , ok , usa ) which contains tetracycline isomer , citric acid and a detergent , tetraclean is designed primarily for smear - layer removal with added antimicrobial activity .
both mtad and tetraclean contain citric acid , an antibiotic from tetracycline line and detergents [ 16 ] .
they differ from each other in the concentration of citric acid and type of the detergents included [ 17 ] .
they do not dissolve the organic tissue and are intended for use at the end of chemomechanical canal preparation subsequent to using naocl .
although earlier studies showed promising antibacterial effects by mtad [ 18 , 19 ] , recent studies have indicated that the subsequent use of naocl and 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) is equally or more effective than naocl / mtad [ 20 , 21 ] .
comparative studies [ 22 ] have indicated better antibacterial activity of tetraclean .
although an antibiotic - containing rci may have good short - and long - term effects , concerns have been expressed regarding the use of tetracycline ( doxycycline ) because of possible bacterial resistance to the antibiotic , allergy to doxycycline and tooth discoloration [ 23 ] .
to overcome these concerns , tetraclean na was developed from the same manufacturer with antibiotic excluded from its formulation ; which consists of citric acid , cetrimide and polypropylene glycol .
the purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of different rcis including naocl , tetraclean and hypoclean on root canals infected with enterococcus faecalis ( e. faecalis ) before and after root canal preparation .
materials and methods e. faecalis ( atcc 29212 ) was used in this assay .
the experimental suspensions were prepared by cultivating the biological indicator on the surface of brain - heart infusion ( bhi ) agar ( difco laboratories , detroit , mi , usa ) and incubated at 37degreesc for 24 h. the bacterial cells were re - suspended in saline solution to reach a final concentration of about 3x108 cells / ml adjusted to no.1 mcfarland turbidity standard .
the bacterial concentration was interpreted using an uv spectrophotometer ( model nova 1600 uv , piracicaba , sp , brazil ) regulated 600 nm wavelength .
thirty - five extracted maxillary central incisors with intact cementum were removed from 0.2 % thymol storage medium and were immersed in 5 % naocl for 30 min to remove the organic tissues .
the root canals were prepared using biorace system ( fkg dentaire , la chaux - de - fonds , switzerland ) using br0 # 25 / 0.08 , br1 # 15 / 0.05 , br2 # 25 / 0.04 , br3 # 25 / 0.06 , br4 # 35 / 0.04 , br5 # 40 / 0.04 and br5c # 40 / 0.02 .
the root canals were irrigated with 3 ml of 2.5 % naocl between the instruments with an ultradent syringe and 0.30 - navitip needle ( ultradent products inc. , south jordan , ut , usa ) .
the crowns were removed and root lengths were standardized to 16 mm ( from root apex to coronal border ) .
root canals were dried and filled with 17 % edta for 3 min for smear layer removal .
after root canal preparation , teeth were autoclaved for 30 min at 121degreesc temperature and 15 psi pressure .
experimental strategy a split platform was used during inoculation with the bacteria [ 24 ] .
briefly , the coronal portion of the root canal was connected to the cut end of a 1.5 ml polypropylene eppendorf tube using a cyanoacrylate adhesive .
the entire surface of tooth - tube interface were coated with nail polish .
the specimens were sterilized in 5 % naocl for 30 min and then were placed in the bhi medium .
to ensure disinfection , the test apparatus was incubated at 37degreesc for 24 h. using sterilized syringes , the specimens were inoculated with e. faecalis every three days during a 60 - day period ( figure 1 ) .
the teeth were kept in a humid environment at 37degreesc .

pre - instrumentation sample collection was conducted using three # 40 paper points kept in each canal for 3 min .
the points were then individually transported and immersed in 7 ml of bhi , with neutralizers ( lecithin , tween 80 and sodium thiosulfate ) at appropriate concentrations and incubated at 37degreesc for 48 h. after root canal preparation using the biorace system ( br5c # 40 / 0.02 , br6 # 50 / 0.04 and br7 # 60 / 0.02 ) , samples were randomly assigned to two positive and negative control groups and five experimental groups ( n = 5 ) according to the irrigation protocol : hypoclean / tetraclean na ; hypoclean ; tetraclean na ; 1 % naocl / tetraclean na and 1 % naocl .
in the experimental groups , 20 min after irrigation with 3 ml of test rcis , an additional irrigation with 5 ml of sterile distilled water was performed .
the root canals were dried , filled with sterile distilled water , and then paper point sampling was done as described above .
all samples were collected using three paper points .
the points were individually transported , immersed in 7 ml of bhi with neutralizers ( lecithin , tween 80 and sodium thiosulfate ) at appropriate concentrations , and incubated at 37degreesc for 48 h. after 72 h , after the evaluation of changes in the culture medium , an inoculum of 0.1 ml from the medium was transferred to 7 ml of letheen broth ( difco laboratories , detroit , mi , usa ) and incubated at 37degreesc for 48 h. the gram staining of the bhi culture was used to confirm e. faecalis contamination .
all the collections were carried out under aseptic conditions .
bacterial growth was analyzed by measuring the turbidity of the culture medium and then analyzed under uv spectrophotometry .
the measurement of the optical density of culture medium was proportional to the number of present bacteria .
for 60 days , five non - inoculated and five e. faecalis infected teeth were incubated at 37degreesc as negative and positive control samples , respectively .
statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation of the optical density in the samples ( pre - instrumentation , and 20 min and 72 h after irrigation ) were obtained .
the difference between groups was analyzed by anova and post hoc tukey 's tests using the spss software ( spss version 20.0 , spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
the level of significance was set at 0.05 .
results the results showed presence of e. faecalis after the irrigation process in all of experimental groups , irrespective of the irrigating solution .
the mean optical densities in both assessment periods showed significant reduction in bacterial count and significant differences between hypoclean , hypoclean / tetraclean na and 1 % naocl ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
the mean values of optical density in positive and negative control samples were 0.601 and 0.000 nm , respectively .
discussion this in vitro study compared the antimicrobial activity of different rci with low surface tension including naocl , tetraclean na and hypoclean on root canals infected with e. faecalis after variable time intervals. e. faecalis was chosen for this study for some reasons .
first , it is the most common bacterial species isolated from the failed endodontic treatments [ 25 ] .
second , it is a resistant microorganism that can grow in a monoculture [ 26 ] .
third , several studies have used it as the test organism [ 25 , 26 ] and fourth , it is resistant to calcium hydroxide as the most common intracanal medicament [ 22 , 25 ] .
the reason for 60 - day inoculation of e. faecalis suspension was to give time for complete penetration of the microorganisms into dentinal tubules [ 23 ] .
according to previous classical studies , although mechanical instrumentation significantly reduces the microbial load of the root canal space , an appropriate root canal irrigant with antibacterial activity is required to enhance the disinfection process [ 3 , 6 ] .
one of the major drawbacks of naocl is its high surface tension [ 8 ] which limits the penetration of rci into the irregularities of the root canal system .
adding surfactant to naocl enhances its penetration [ 9 ] .
hypoclean was constructed based on the very same concept .
it has been revealed that hypoclean was the most effective irrigant against candida albicans , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and lactobacillus casei , using agar diffusion test [ 12 ] .
furthermore , using a human tooth model , mohammadi et al .
[ 9 ] demonstrated the substantivity of hypoclean for up to 4 weeks .
considering the fact that naocl does not have substantivity , the substantivity of a naocl - based irrigants such as hypoclean can be attributed to its deep penetration into irregularities of the root canal system , which makes chlorine ions available for a longer time .

presence of detergent can increases the penetration depth of tetraclean .
in a recent study , poggio et al .
[ 24 ] observed a significantly higher release of ca2 + in samples submitted to citric acid based agents .
the addition of cetrimide did not affect the chelating properties of edta and citric acid solutions because the concentration of ca2 + released in the two solutions did not significantly differ [ 9 , 24 ] .
it indicates that , to obtain an efficient smear layer removal and to facilitate the biomechanical procedures , citric acid based agents can be applied and cetrimide can help in improving efficacy of the irrigating solutions .
moreover , cetrimide does not affect the demineralization ability of citric acid and edta solutions .
cationic surfactants are potent antimicrobial agents that have also been shown to act on biofilm components , but they have no decalcifying effects on root canal dentin [ 27 ] .
edta and citric acid solutions are not effective against the biofilms at any tested concentration or time [ 28 ] ; however , the antimicrobial activity of chelating agents in combination with cetrimide is greater than the use of chelating agents alone [ 29 ] , and the combination of 0.2 % cetrimide with either 15 % edta or 15 % citric acid gave 100 % bacterial kill after 1 min of contact with the biofilms [ 30 ] .
to improve their efficacy , root canal irrigants must be in contact with the dentin walls and debris [ 31 ] .
the intimacy of this contact depends on the tendency of the irrigant to wet the solid dentin , and this property is strictly correlated to the surface tension of the irrigant [ 32 ] .
surface tension is defined as " the force between molecules that produces a tendency for the surface area of a liquid to decrease " [ 32 ] .
rci solutions should have very low surface tension .
the wettability of the solution governs the capability of its penetration both into the main and lateral canals , and into the dentinal tubules [ 33 ]. by lowering the surface tension of rci , their wettability improves and solutions modified with surfactants immediately spread on the dentin surface , yielding a zero - degree contact angle [ 34 ] .
as tetraclean is an antibiotic - based irrigation solution comprising of tetracycline isomer , there may be problems with tooth staining , bacterial resistance and sensitivity [ 35 ] .
using a solution without antibiotic as tetraclean na , could be a viable alternative .
this in vitro study showed that tetraclean na keeps its antimicrobial activity on 60 - day e. faecalis mature biofilms after 20 min and 72 h. citric acid and cetrimide as two major components of tetraclean na , have antibacterial properties ; however , the present study revealed that citric acid does demonstrate antimicrobial properties against anaerobic bacteria of the infected root canals , especially against cocci [ 36 ] .
further clinical and in vitro studies are needed to verify the antimicrobial effect of detergent - based irrigants with added surfactants in complex root canal system .
conclusion under the experimental conditions , detergent - based irrigants can facilitate the biomechanical procedure of the irrigation solution .
moreover , the presence of cetrimide in the irrigating solutions may greatly assist in comprehensive antibacterial activity .

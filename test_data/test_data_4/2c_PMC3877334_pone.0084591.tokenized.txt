the transcriptional code that programs cardiac hypertrophy involves the zinc finger - containing dna binding factors gata - 4 and gata - 6 , both of which are required to mount a hypertrophic response of the adult heart .
here we performed conditional gene deletion of gata4 or gata6 in the mouse heart in conjunction with reciprocal gene replacement using a transgene encoding either gata - 4 or gata - 6 in the heart as a means of parsing dosage effects of gata - 4 and gata - 6 versus unique functional roles .
we determined that gata - 4 and gata - 6 play a redundant and dosage - sensitive role in programming the hypertrophic growth response of the heart following pressure overload stimulation .
however , non - redundant functions were identified in allowing the heart to compensate and resist heart failure after pressure overload stimulation , as neither gata4 nor gata6 deletion was fully rescued by expression of the reciprocal transgene .
for example , only gata4 heart - specific deletion blocked the neoangiogenic response to pressure overload stimulation .
gene expression profiling from hearts of these gene - deleted mice showed both overlapping and unique transcriptional codes , which is presented .
these results indicate that gata - 4 and gata - 6 play a dosage - dependent and redundant role in programming cardiac hypertrophy , but that each has a more complex role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis and resistance to heart failure following injury that cannot be compensated by the other .

introduction the adult heart typically undergoes a process of hypertrophic growth in response to injury or disease stimulation that promotes neurohumoral activation and / or increases in wall stress [ 1 ] .
the heart responds to disease or stress by activating signaling and transcriptional pathways that ultimately result in the activation of pro - growth and adaptive genes in an attempt to compensate for an injury event or disruption of homeostasis [ 1 ] .
the zinc - finger containing transcription factors gata - 4 and gata - 6 are each expressed in the heart where they play a prominent role in myocyte lineage commitment and differentiation during embryogenesis [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] but each is also induced and re - employed in the adult heart following injury where they participate in mediating the hypertrophic growth of individual myocytes [ 3 ] .
we have shown previously that heart - specific deletion of gata4 in the adult mouse renders the heart less able to hypertrophy with agonist or pressure overload stimulation , as well as more likely to succumb to heart failure , even with aging [ 4 ] .
loss of gata4 from the heart also negatively impacted neoangiogenesis following stress stimulation , further defining its role in homeostasis and prevention of heart failure [ 5 ]. by comparison , cardiac - specific deletion of gata6 similarly resulted in a defective hypertrophic response with pressure overload stimulation , as well as a greater propensity towards heart failure [ 6 ] .
during development gata4 and gata6 seem to be completely redundant in programming cardiomyocyte commitment , as deletion of either gene alone still permitted myocyte formation , yet deletion of both together resulted in a complete loss of the lineage [ 7 ] .
moreover , gata4 +/ - gata6 +/ - ( double heterozygous ) mice are embryonic lethal , similar to homozygous null mutations in either gene alone , again suggesting functional redundancy and that the total dosage of the four gata4 / 6 alleles is most critical with respect to their function [ 8 ] .
here we attempted to investigate if gata - 4 and gata - 6 had unique functionality in the adult heart during the hypertrophic response and / or in maintaining proper homeostatic gene expression that underlies cardiac " well - being " by using a reciprocal gene replacement strategy .
materials and methods animal models and methods gata4 - loxp ( fl ) and gata6 - loxp ( fl ) mice were each described previously , as were transgenic mice expressing a tetracycline transactivator ( tta ) driven inducible and cardiac - specific alpha - myosin heavy chain ( alphamhc ) promoter or deletion with the betamhc - promoter driven , cre - expressing transgene [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction ( tac ) was performed as described previously , as well as assessment of cardiac ventricular performance by echocardiography [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
assessment of capillary density in the heart with isolectin b4 on frozen histological sections was performed as described previously [ 5 ] .
western blotting from cardiac nuclear protein extracts was performed as described previously [ 9 ] .
mrna collection from adult hearts and subsequent affymetrix mouse set st1.0 chips microarrays were generated and analyzed as described previously [ 9 ] .
qrt - pcr was performed for selected genes using sybr green ( applied biosystems ) .
we used 6 control mice and 6 knock - outs ( 3 for each group ) for the microarray experiments ( 2 betamhc - cre , 2 gata4 - loxp , 3 gata4 - loxp betamhc - cre , 2 gata6 - loxp , and 3 gata6 - loxp betamhc - cre ) .
we also used at least 4 mice per genotype in the qrt - pcr experiments .
the microarray data was deposited in the geo database through the ncbi gateway under accession number gse52317 .
ethics statement all animal experimentation was approved by the office of research compliance and regulatory affairs and by the cincinnati children 's hospital institutional animal care and use committee ( protocol number : 2e11104 ) .
no human subjects were used .
statistical tests statistical significance was determined by anova and newman - keuls pairwise comparisons for multivariate experiments and t - test for experiments with 2 groups .
results we have previously shown that both gata - 4 and gata - 6 proteins are upregulated in the adult heart during the cardiac hypertrophic response [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
here we investigated the induction of gata - 4 and gata - 6 in the heart more carefully after pressure overload stimulation , which showed nearly identical profiles in the degree of protein upregulation as well as the time course of induction , which begins within the first 1 - 2 days , then is fulminant by day 7 , thereafter trailing off by 8 weeks ( fig. 1a ) .
gata - 4 and gata - 6 were previously shown to function in a synergistic manner as transcriptional inducers when co - overexpressed in cultured myocytes , suggesting that they are not functional redundant in that they work together more effectively than either one individually [ 10 ] .
however , in our hands gata - 4 and gata - 6 each induced expression of the b - type natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) promoter in cultured cardiomyocytes equal to the combination of gata - 4 with gata - 6 ( fig. 1b ) .
these same 2 gata - 4 / 6 expression plasmids previously produced approximately equal levels of promoter activity in neonatal cultured cardiomyocytes when transfected with the bnp promoter or an artificial gata - multisite reporter plasmid [ 11 ] .
similarly , if gata - 4 and gata - 6 did indeed have a functional synergy when co - overexpressed we reasoned that it might induce a hastened hypertrophic response in vivo .
while both gata - 4 and gata - 6 overexpression in the heart , as driven by the alphamhc promoter , can lead to mild cardiac hypertrophy by 6 - 8 months of age [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , mice containing both the gata - 4 and gata - 6 transgene did not show induction of hypertrophy at 8 weeks of age ( fig. 1c , and data not shown ) .
longer time points were not investigated because each transgene alone begins to show pathologic - like cardiac hypertrophy at 4 - 6 months of age .
indeed , if synergy was occurring between these 2 factors , 8 weeks of age should have produced a demonstrable effect , as many other hypertrophy inducing transgenes show fulminant hypertrophy as early as 1 - 2 weeks of age .
thus , in the adult heart gata - 4 and gata - 6 are each induced in a similar manner during stress - induced hypertrophy , but they do not appear to function together in a synergistic manner in driving cardiac hypertrophy more than either individual transgene .

c , heart weight normalized to body weight ( hw / bw ) of the indicated genotype of cardiac - specific transgenic mice expressing either gata4 , gata6 , or both together at 8 weeks of age .
to more definitively examine if gata - 4 and gata - 6 function in a dosage - dependent , redundant manner in the adult heart we also analyzed mice with cardiac - specific deletion of multiple gata4 and gata6 alleles .
here we analyzed gata4 - loxp ( fl ) and gata6 - loxp targeted mice crossed with mice expressing the cre recombinase cdna from the betamhc promoter , which we have previously shown results in highly efficient deletion of each gene in the heart resulting in a reduction in the pressure overload - induced hypertrophic response [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
for the current analysis we compared double heterozygous mice of gata4fl /+ gata6fl /+ versus three allele deleted mice consisting of gata4fl / fl gata6fl /+ or gata4fl /+ gata6fl / fl following 2 weeks of transverse aortic constriction ( tac ) to induce hypertrophy ( fig. 2a ) .
control mice were double heterozygous without the betamhc - cre transgene , which were identical to wildtype in their response ( fig. 2a ) .
the data show a significant attenuation of the hypertrophic response in double heterozygous targeted mice , which was significantly reduced again by further deletion of 3 out of 4 gata4 / 6 alleles in either combination ( fig. 2a ) .
similarly , analysis of cardiac function by echocardiography after tac stimulation also showed a similar dosage - dependent reduction corresponding with the number of gata4 / 6 alleles deleted ( fig. 2b ) .
we have previously reported that 4 / 4 allele targeted mice crossed with mice containing the betamhc - cre transgene resulted in spontaneous heart failure at baseline and complete lethality by 16 weeks of age , hence we were not able to perform tac stimulation on fully homozygous gata4 / 6 loxp - targeted mice [ 6 ] .
taken together , our results suggest that gata - 4 and gata - 6 function equivalently and in a dosage - dependent manner in programming the hypertrophic response .

h , i , western blot analysis for gata - 4 ( g4 ) or gata - 6 ( g6 ) protein from the hearts of the indicated mice .
a non - specific ( n.s. ) band from each of the western blots was used to show equal loading and running conditions .
we also employed an entirely independent approach in which we bred mice containing either the gata - 4 or gata - 6 heart - specific transgene into the gata4 and gata6 heart - specific gene - deleted genetic backgrounds .
this replacement transgenesis approach restored the full hypertrophic potential of the heart after tac , further suggesting that these 2 transcription factors function redundantly in programming the cardiac growth response ( fig. 2c ) .
however , only the gata - 6 transgene restored the ability of gata6 cardiac - specific deleted mice to compensate and resist heart failure after tac stimulation , as the gata - 4 transgene replacement in the gata6 null background produced even slightly worse cardiac function after tac ( fig. 2d ) , although left ventricular end diastolic dimension and septal thicknesses were not significantly changed ( fig. 2e and f ). by comparison , analysis of the reciprocal cross in gata4 heart - specific , deleted mice showed that only the gata - 4 transgene prevented functional decompensation , while the gata - 6 transgene was ineffective ( fig. 2g ) .
western blotting from all these crosses showed transgene generated gata - 4 or gata - 6 protein expression in each of the genetic backgrounds analyzed here ( fig. 2h and i ) .
as an aside , if one examines these western blots carefully the deletion of gata4 or gata6 protein with the betamhc - cre transgene does not appear obvious , although we have previously shown that this strategy results in 70 - 90 % loss of each protein [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
the differences here are likely do to the timing of these experiments , which were from older animals that accumulate other non - myocytes in the heart that also express gata - 4 and gata - 6 , as well as from mild cross reactivity of the gata - 4 and gata - 6 antibodies used here .
indeed , a 50 % reduction in gata - 6 protein is observable in gata6fl / fl mice with the betamhc - cre transgene versus gata6fl / fl mice without the cre transgene ( fig. 2h , lanes 1 + 2 versus 7 + 8 ) .
however , lanes 9 + 10 show higher levels of gata - 6 protein because of gata - 4 overexpression in these mice and the fact that the gata6 antibody partially cross - reacts with gata4 .
the same general phenomena are present in figure 2i .
in conclusion , while gata - 4 and gata - 6 function in a dosage - dependent and redundant manner in programming the cardiac growth response , each must have unique transcriptional targets to explain why reciprocal replacement does not prevent decompensation with 2 weeks of pressure overload stimulation .
only 2 weeks of pressure overload stimulation was performed because decompensation was already apparent at this time , hence longer time periods of simulation were not necessary and lethality becomes more of a confounding factor as timing is extended .
to further investigate how gata - 4 and gata - 6 might function differently in the heart we performed extensive gene array analysis for altered cardiac mrna expression between gata4 and gata6 heart - specific deleted mice at 2 months of age ( table 1 ) .
a number of genes were identified as significantly changed in hearts between gata6fl / fl - betamhc - cre versus gata4fl / fl - betamhc - cre mice .
the most significantly altered genes or ones with interesting regulatory connotations were selected for qrt - pcr confirmation ( table 2 ) .
some of the more prominently differentially expressed genes were drd2 , gm129 , hey2 , bhlhb9 , adh1 , and irx5 .
there were also interesting angiogenesis - related genes that were altered , hence qrt - pcr was run against a larger panel of such genes to extend and confirm the array results , similar to a previous description in the literature ( table 3 , ref 12 ) .
for example , gata4 - deleted hearts showed a downregulation in vegf1a and fgf16 , which were not changed in gata6 - deleted hearts .
indeed , we have previously shown that hearts from gata4 cardiac - specific targeted mice had a defect in cardiac angiogenesis following stress stimulation that then directly predisposed to heart failure , although the role of gata6 in this process was not analyzed [ 5 ] .
to further assess this one potential mechanism , we performed tac stimulation in both gata4 and gata6 heart - specific gene - deleted mice and then assessed capillary density in the heart ( fig. 3 ) .
the data show that wildtype controls ( gata6fl / fl mice ) have the known characteristic increase in capillary density after tac stimulation , while the gata4 heart - specific deleted mice are defective in this response ( fig. 3 ) .
we have previously shown that gata6fl / fl mice are entirely the same as wildtype mice and that the gata6 locus is otherwise unaffected by the placement of the loxp sites [ 6 ] .
unlike gata4 heart - specific , deleted mice , gata6 deleted mice showed no defect in their ability to augment angiogenesis after tac stimulation ( fig. 3 ) .
these results suggest at least one prominent mechanism through angiogenesis whereby the transcription factors gata - 4 and gata - 6 can function differently in the heart , thus having a differential effect in predisposing to heart failure with stress stimulation .

discussion the existence of gene duplication in evolutionary biology poses many interesting questions , as members of related gene families can have a spectrum of similar versus more specialized functionality .
typically , the greater the evolutionary distance underlying a gene duplication event , the greater the functional divergence .
gata - 4 and gata - 6 are nearly identical in their primary sequences within the dna binding zinc - finger domains , with large areas of partial sequence conservation outside this motif [ 2 ] .
gata - 4 and gata - 6 have been suggested to function differently with respect to binding select cardiac - specific promoters , as well as to synergize when co - transfected with the bnp promoter construct [ 10 ] .
such results suggested that these 2 factors had unique functions in the heart , especially as might relate to the cardiac hypertrophic response or adult heart gene expression .
the very concept that these 2 factors likely function differently in the heart is in basic agreement with our results , as the cardiac gata - 4 transgene could not functionally compensate for the deletion of gata6 from the heart , and the cardiac gata - 6 transgene could not functionally compensate for the loss of gata4 , yet each did effectively compensate for itself suggesting that the approach was valid ( i.e. , gata - 6 transgene into the gata6 deleted background ) .
thus , these functional results suggested that there is a set of genes uniquely regulated by either gata - 4 or gata6 in the heart , which we indeed confirmed by gene array analysis .
the most prominent and mechanistically important of which appears to be select angiogenic genes as effectors of adaptation in the heart following pressure overload stimulation .
however , with respect to the hypertrophic response per se , we observed that gata - 4 and gata - 6 were redundant and acted in concert as part of a dosage of total gata protein necessary for efficient induction of growth regulating genes in the heart .
indeed , gata4 and gata6 genes were shown to be redundant in programming cardiomyogenesis during development [ 7 ] , and gata4 +/ - gata6 +/ - double heterozygous mice are embryonic lethal yet each single heterozygote is fully viable [ 8 ] , again suggesting redundancy in function and that total gene dosage is the more important determinant for embryonic development .
hence , the gata4 and gata6 genes appear to be at an intermediate stage of evolutionary genetic drift where they have acquired unique functionality but also retain a degree of overlap , such as in regulating the adult hypertrophic response .
overexpression of gata - 4 or gata - 6 in the heart , as these mice age out past 6 months , each appears to program a similar extent of maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy , while cardiac - specific deletion of either gata4 or gata6 from the heart appears to render the heart less adapted and more prone to failure , hence both genes appear to also be necessary for optimal cardiac " health " and physiology [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .

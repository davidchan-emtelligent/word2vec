cryptic diversity within bumblebees ( bombus ) has the potential to undermine crucial conservation efforts designed to reverse the observed decline in many bumblebee species worldwide .
central to such efforts is the ability to correctly recognise and diagnose species .
the b. lucorum complex ( bombus lucorum , b. cryptarum and b. magnus ) comprises one of the most abundant and important group of wild plant and crop pollinators in northern europe .
although the workers of these species are notoriously difficult to diagnose morphologically , it has been claimed that queens are readily diagnosable from morphological characters .
here we assess the value of colour - pattern characters in species identification of dna - barcoded queens from the b. lucorum complex .
three distinct molecular operational taxonomic units were identified each representing one species .
however , no uniquely diagnostic colour - pattern character state was found for any of these three molecular units and most colour - pattern characters showed continuous variation among the units .
all characters previously deemed to be unique and diagnostic for one species were displayed by specimens molecularly identified as a different species .
these results presented here raise questions on the reliability of species determinations in previous studies and highlights the benefits of implementing dna barcoding prior to ecological , taxonomic and conservation studies of these important key pollinators .
introduction pollination is a key ecosystem service for both natural and agricultural ecosystems .
while evidence for a pollination crisis is equivocal [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , it is increasingly clear that wild pollinators , and particularly bees , are in decline worldwide [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
consequently , a key aim in insect conservation is to understand and reverse these declines .
in northern temperate regions , bumblebees - as ecologically and commercially important pollinators - have been the focus of considerable conservation effort [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
conservation of any group requires an assessment of both current status and the impact of potential interventions , and this in turn requires accurate species identification .
while recent phylogenetic analyses have advanced our understanding of bumblebee taxonomy [ 13 ] , bombus species are notorious for possessing convergent colour patterns , resulting in cryptic species [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
morphologically cryptic species pose significant problems for field assessment of species richness and diversity , both of which are central to understanding current and future population trends of these important pollinators .
unfortunately , in western europe one of the apparently most common bumblebees , b. lucorum ( linnaeus ) , belongs to such a cryptic species complex .
while b. lucorum s.l. is common throughout europe [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , and has been commercially reared as a pollinator for greenhouse crops [ 19 ] , increasing chemical [ 20 ] and molecular [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] evidence supports the idea that it actually represents three distinct species , b. cryptarum ( fabricius ) , b. lucorum and b. magnus ( vogt ) .
the use of molecular tools in large - scale ecological studies has revealed differences in the ecology , abundance and distribution of these putative species [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , indicating the need to reassess the conservation status and response of these species to interventions separately .
presently , the majority of species records are collected by members of the public using morphological and especially colour - pattern characters for identification ( e.g. , in the uk by the bees , wasps and ants recording scheme , www.bwars.com and the bumblebee conservation trust http :// www.bumblebeeconservation.org.uk /) .
therefore , there is a clear need to assess the value of colour - pattern characters in distinguishing these species .
both the scientific and popular literature suggest that such characters can be used to identify colony - founding queens in the spring [ 20 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
morphology based diagnosis of b. lucorum s.l. queens principally involves characteristics of the collar , labrum , ocelli and metasomal terga [ 20 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ]. of these , the most commonly used characters for species diagnosis are those describing the pile (' hair ') of the collar ( a band of yellow hairs at the anterior of the thorax ) [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , particularly : ( i ) the extent of a collar extension below the tegula [ 24 ] ; ( ii ) the presence or absence of melanisation in the collar [ 20 ] ; and ( iii ) the presence or absence of an ' s - shape ' of black hairs on the side of the collar [ 20 ] .
while the extension of such traits to identifying workers has been shown to fail [ 23 ] , and despite reservations that character variation may not be discrete [ 28 ] , to our knowledge there has been no quantitative assessment of their accuracy in identifying queens .
the main aim of this study is to use molecular tools to assess the value of these popular colour - pattern characters in biodiversity and conservation surveys of the b. lucorum species complex .
the dna barcode , an approximately 650 bp region of the cytochrome c oxidase ( coi ) mitochondrial gene , has become an invaluable tool for species identification and taxonomic hypothesis generation for both ecologists and taxonomists alike [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
to date over 700,000 barcode records have been generated for insects ( http :// www.boldsystems.org ) and barcoding has been utilised across major insect orders including lepidoptera [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , coleoptera [ 40 ] diptera [ 34 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , hemiptera [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] and hymenoptera [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
in many cases the morphological characters traditionally used to describe a species or indicate relationships among species have been re - evaluated in the light of groupings arising from dna barcoding studies .
evaluating species diagnostic morphological characters of genetically discrete units in such a way can indicate strengths and weaknesses in current taxonomic diagnoses of the group under study and often taxonomic revision may follow [ 35 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
however , for the lucorum complex the diagnostic value of these characters has yet to be assessed quantitatively against independently determined specimens .
here we combine dna barcoding and quantitative colour - pattern analyses to address this question at the scale of both ireland and continental europe .
materials and methods taxon sampling and morphological analysis irish specimens used in this study were obtained from a collection originally sampled in 2005 and 2006 [ 22 ] .
in order to extend the study to a european scale , and investigate geographic variance , specimens were obtained from the orkney islands of northern scotland , denmark and finland .
field studies did not involve endangered or protected species and no specific permits were required for the collection of specimens included in this study .
permission was not required for the collection of danish , scottish , finnish and the majority of irish specimens .
collecting unlisted insect species samples from lands of the irish national parks and botanic gardens required only verbal permission , and this was obtained from the national park rangers for each park , and from dr peter wyse jackson , director of the national botanic gardens .
queens of b. lucorum agg. were collected in all regions , except denmark , without prior morphological identification .
danish queens were initially morphologically identified to characterise representative specimens of each putative species prior to our genetic analyses .
as such , specimens that displayed characters at the extremes of the morphological ranges were most likely to occur in the danish samples .
in total 67 queens were included ( table s1 ) in the molecular and morphometric analyses .
the irish and danish groups ( totaling 48 queens ) were also analysed separately , as they consisted of all three species ( see below ) .
using electronic vernier calipers ( mitutoyo absolute digimatic ) , we measured thorax width between the tegulae ( body size ) , breadth of the collar on top of the thorax , vertical and horizontal extensions of the collar below the tegula , and breadth of the collar below the tegula .
we also recorded a series of qualitative characters that have been deemed to be diagnostic for the three species : ( i ) the presence or absence of a black ' s - shape ' on the side of the collar ; ( ii ) the presence or absence of melanisation in the collar ; and ( iii ) the presence of a collar extension below the tegula .
to account for variation in quantitative morphological characters that may be affected by animal size , relative sizes were calculated using thorax breadth as a measure of body size .
morphological data were analysed using either one - way anovas with tukey 's post - hoc test for pairwise differences , or g - tests .
all analyses were conducted using spss v .
16.0 .
data are shown as boxplots as we are interested in the biological variation in morphological traits .
dna extraction and amplification total dna was extracted from the mid or hind legs using the dneasy blood & tissue extraction kit ( qiagen ) , with a modified protocol .
legs were ground in a 1.5 ml eppedorf tube comprising 200 microl pbs with a disposable polypropylene pestle connected to a hand held motor ( sigma aldrich ) .
then 180 microl of buffer al and 20 microl proteinase k ( qiagen kit components ) were added and the sample was homogenized further prior to incubation at 70degreesc for 30 mins .
thereafter , 200 microl of 100 % ethanol was added and the remaining extraction followed the manufacturer 's protocol .
for amplification and sequencing of the coi region the primers lcohym ( 5 ' - tatcaaccaatcataaagatattgg - 3 ' ; [ 51 ]) and nancyshort were used ( 5 ' cccggtaaaattaaaatataaac - 3 ' ; [ 52 ] .
pcrs were carried out in 20 microl volumes using 1x pcr buffer ( invitrogen ) , 2.5 mm mgcl2 , 0.2 mm of each primer , 0.2 mm of each dntp , 1 u taq polymerase ( invitrogen ) and approximately 50 ng template dna .
pcr reaction conditions included denaturation at 94degreesc for 240 s followed by 32 cycles of 60 s at 94degreesc , 45 s at 48degreesc , 60 s at 72degreesc and a final extension at 72degreesc for 420 s in a peltier thermal cycler ( ptc 200 ; mj research ) .
pcr products were sequenced in the school of natural sciences , trinity college using an abi 3130xl capillary automated sequencers ( applied biosystems inc. ) .
the same pcr primers were used for sequencing .
forward and reverse sequence reads were view and assembled into contiguous sequences using bioedit v7.0.9 [ 53 ] .
all polymorphic sites were visually inspected to ensure correct base calling and sequences were aligned manually .
the electropherogram , sequence and specimen data were submitted to bold ( accessions jcluc001 - 11 to jcluc - 067 - 11 http :// www.barcodinglife.org ) and are available in the " irish bombus lucorum " project folder of bold .
sequences were also deposited in genbank ( accessions jn872566 to jn872632 ) .
sequence analysis the final aligned matrix was imported into mega version 4.0 [ 54 ] for phylogenetic analysis .
no gaps were present and translations of the sequences indicated the absence of stop and nonsense codons .
after sequence trimming a total of 642 base pairs were available for analysis .
nucleotide positions were determined using the full coi gene sequence from the mitochondrial genome of b. hypocrita ( genbank accession no .
nc011923 ; positions 1996 to 3555 ) and the mouse coi reference sequence ( derived from genbank accession no. ak166798 ) .
sequence divergences were calculated using the kimura 2 - parameter ( k2p ) distance model [ 55 ] using mega 4 .
bayesian analysis was set and implemented using bayesian evolutionary analysis utility ( beauti ) v 1.5.4 and bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees ( beast ; [ 56 ] v 1.5.4 using the general time reversible and gamma ( gtr + g ) substitution model , uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock ( ucln ) model and coalescent tree prior. b. terrestris ( linnaeus ; bold accession 6876c01 ; williams ph , an j , brown mjf , carolan jc , goulson d , huang j and ito m , an unsuspected cryptic bumblebee : consequences for conservation and the trade in greenhouse pollinators , submitted ) was chosen to root the trees based on the results of cameron et al. , [ 13 ] and murray et al. , [ 22 ] which indicate its sister group status with respect to the taxa included in this study .
the analysis was run for 10,000,000 generations with sampling of trees every 1000 generations .
after termination the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) output was analysed using treeannotator v.1.5.4 ( http :// beast.bio.ed.ac.uk ) to produce a consensus tree from the post burn - in tree sample ( burn - in 1000 ) with a posterior probability of 0.5 , targeting the maximum clade credibility tree and keeping the target node heights .
all trees were opened and viewed in figtree v 1.3 ( http :// tree.bio.ed.ac.uk / software / figtree /) .
haplotype variation , diagnostic sequence distribution and inter - and intra - specific divergences were determined using the hapmap application of the ibarcode website ( http :// www.ibarcode.org /) .
results the coi barcode was sequenced for 67 representatives of the lucorum complex with the majority of the barcode sequence being obtained for each .
the reference dna barcode begins 58 bp from the 5 ' - end of the mouse coi gene , which corresponds to position 52 of the b. hypocrita coi gene .
in total , 642 nucleotides were available for analysis .
bayesian analyses resulted in a tree ( figure 1 ) with three distinct and well supported clades , each of which we assume represents one of the three species. of the 37 irish specimens , 22 were b. magnus , 8 were b. cryptarum , and 7 were b. lucorum .
the danish b. magnus resolved as a sister group to irish b. magnus ( clade 1 ; 1.00 bayesian posterior probability , ( bpp )) , differentiated by two polymorphisms that represent synonymous substitutions .
danish , irish and orkney island b. cryptarum resolved as a monophyletic group with finnish representatives , resolving as a sister group to the main group ( clade 2 ; 0.99 bpp ) .
finnish specimens possessed 8 polymorphisms with respect to their irish / orkney / danish counterparts .
only a single polymorphism ( c / t at position 391 ) was evident within the b. lucorum clade ( clade 3 ; 1.00 bpp ) and this polymorphism was shared by two finnish specimens ( t904 and t909 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0029251.g001 figure 1 consensus bayesian tree generated from 642 bps of the mitochondrial coi region for 67 representatives of the lucorum complex .
bayesian mcmc analysis was conducted using the general time reversible model , gamma distribution and 1 million generations .
numbers below the branches indicate posterior probabilities .
scale bar relates to expected number of substitutions per site. b. terrestris ( 428 - 6876coi ) was included as an out - group and used to root the trees .
in total , there were 50 variable characters of which 41 were deemed to be informative .
haplotype mapping using ibarcode web resources indicated that 16 haplotypes were present across all species .
however , a number of these are derived from unique nucleotide polymorphisms found in a single specimen .
such haplotypes were discounted from further consideration and specimens with a single polymorphism were included in the counts for the most similar haplotype .
two distinct haplotypes are evident for b. magnus and b. cryptarum , where the haplotypes correspond to geographically distinct groups. of the seven nucleotide differences between the two b. cryptarum haplotypes , four are shared between the finnish b. cryptarum and both b. magnus and b. lucorum .
although a number of diagnostic nucleotide characters were evident for each species , when each was compared to the other two species only two nucleotide positions can be deemed diagnostic for species delineation across the entire complex ( table 1 ) .
they are at position 203 ( thymine , cytosine and adenine for b. cryptarum , b. lucorum and b. magnus respectively ) and position 553 ( adenine , thymine and cytosine for b. cryptarum , b. lucorum and b. magnus respectively ) .
within species , genetic distances for b. cryptarum , b. lucorum and b. magnus were 0.004 , 0.001 and 0.001 respectively .
interspecific genetic distances were considerably higher and ranged from 0.033 to 0.044 .

morphological analysis quantitative measurements and qualitative scores were obtained for a range of morphological characters that have been suggested to be diagnostic for species or of taxonomic importance for b. lucorum s.l. .
body size while there was considerable overlap among species in body size ( fig. 2a ) , there were nevertheless significant differences among the species in mean thorax breadth between the tegulae ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
post - hoc tests showed that b. magnus was bigger than b. lucorum ( table 2 , p = 0.035 ) and b. cryptarum ( table 2 , p = 0.043 ) , but there was no difference between the latter two species ( p = 0.943 ; fig. 2a , table 2 ) .
analysing the irish specimens on their own , there was still a significant difference in body size ( tables 2 , 3 ) , with post - hoc tests showing that b. magnus was bigger than b. lucorum ( table 2 , p < 0.001 ) but not b. cryptarum ( table 2 , p = 0.438 ) , and that b. cryptarum was bigger than b. lucorum ( table 2 , p = 0.014 ; fig. 2b ) .
finally , analysing the danish specimens on their own , there was no significant difference in body size across all species or in any of the pairwise comparisons ( tables 2 , 3 , all p > 0.2 ; figure 2c ) .

this was true for the entire data set , and for independent analyses of the irish and danish specimens ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
results were the same when collar breadth was re - scaled relative to body size ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
length of collar extension below tegula as with body size , despite considerable overlap among species , there were significant differences among species for the length of the collar extension below the tegula on the left ( f 2,63 = 76.059 , p < 0.001 , explaining 70 % of the variance among specimens ) and right ( f 2,63 = 71.046 , p < 0.001 , explaining 69.3 % of the variance ) sides of the thorax ( table 2 ) , as well as the average extension across both sides ( f 2,63 = 93.378 , p < 0.001 , explaining 74.8 % of the variance ) .
all pairwise differences were significant ( all p < 0.001 ) , with the collar of b. magnus extending significantly further below the tegula than that of b. cryptarum , which itself had a longer absolute extension of the collar than b. lucorum ( table 2 ) .
results were qualitatively similar for the irish and danish data sets when analysed on their own ( statistics not shown , table 2 ) , although in the danish data , only b. lucorum had a consistently significantly shorter collar extension than b. magnus .
results were qualitatively the same when length of the collar extension was re - scaled relative to body size ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
breadth of collar extension below tegula again , despite large overlap among species in this character , there were significant differences in the breadth of the collar extension below the tegula on the left ( f 2,63 = 29.667 , p < 0.001 , explaining 48.5 % of the variance among specimens ) and right ( f 2,63 = 30.492 , p < 0.001 , explaining 49.2 % of the variance ) sides of the thorax ( table 2 ) , as well as the average breadth across both sides ( f 2,63 = 37.293 , p < 0.001 , explaining 54.2 % of the variance ) .
all pairwise differences were significant ( all p < 0.04 ) with the collar of b. magnus being broader below the tegula than that of b. cryptarum , which itself was broader than b. lucorum ( table 2 ) .
results were qualitatively similar for the irish and danish data sets when analysed on their own ( statistics not shown , table 2 ) , although in the danish data only b. lucorum had a consistently significantly narrower collar extension than b. magnus .
results were qualitatively similar when breadth of the collar extension was re - scaled relative to body size ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
one of the key characteristics that has been suggested as a way to identify the three species is the combination of relative breadth and length of the collar extension below the tegula .
however , a plot of these two morphological variables against each other ( fig. 3 ) shows that they cannot unambiguously differentiate between the three species at either continental or local scales .
at the european scale , all three species overlap in this combination of characters , with particularly strong overlap between b. cryptarum + b. lucorum and b. cryptarum + b. magnus respectively ( figure 3a ) .
in the danish samples , which were identified morphologically prior to molecular analyses , a similar degree of overlap is observed ( figure 3c ) .
in contrast , the irish samples suggest possible differentiation between b. cryptarum and b. lucorum using this combined character , although b. cryptarum and b. magnus still overlap ( figure 3b ) .
figure 4 shows examples of this overlap , with molecularly identified specimens from each species falling into all 3 of the colour - pattern groups .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0029251.g003 figure 3 combining the length and breadth of the collar extension of queens fails to distinguish between species ( a ) all samples combined , ( b ) for irish specimens , and ( c ) for danish specimens .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0029251.g004 figure 4 morphological variation in queens of the three species as defined by coi barcode groups .
horizontal rows indicate species as identified by barcoding , whilst vertical columns show how molecularly identified specimens of each species can be morphologically identified as belonging to all 3 taxa .
specimens are identified by letters , which correspond to table s1 as follows : a = t780 , b = t773 , c = t883 , d = t875 , e = t718 , f = t787 , g = t714 , h = t713 , i = t781 .
the " s - shape " queens of b. cryptarum were significantly more likely to have an " s - shape " than either b. lucorum or b. magnus ( left - hand side of the thorax : g = 21.544 , p < 0.001 ; right - hand side of the thorax : g = 21.162 , p < 0.001 ) .
however , only 64 % and 57 % of b. cryptarum queens had the " s - shape " on the left and right sides , respectively ( table 4 ) .
while irish queens were more likely to possess the s - shape if they were b. cryptarum ( left : g = 7.488 , p = 0.024 ; right : g = 6.678 , p = 0.035 ) , only 57 % of b. cryptarum queens exhibited this marker while up to 18 % of b. magnus possessed an s - shape , depending on thorax side ( table 4 ; see figure 4 , specimen g for an example of a b. magnus queen with an " s - shape ") .
unsurprisingly , given that the animals were morphologically identified on the basis of the s - shape prior to sequencing , 100 % of danish b. cryptarum queens had the s - shape on the left and right sides of their thorax ( g = 18.249 , p < 0.001 for both sides ) , while specimens of the other two species had no s - shape ( table 4 ) .

while both b. magnus ( 48 %) and b. cryptarum ( 22 %) possessed this character state on the left side of the thorax , only b. magnus possessed it on the right side ( 44 %) ( table 4 ) .
only b. magnus queens from the irish data set had a collar extension below the tegula .
45 % of these queens had an extension on the left side , while 50 % had it on the right side ( g = 10.878 , p = 0.004 ; g = 12.308 , p = 0.002 , respectively ) ( table 4 ) .
there was significant variation among species in the danish sample for the presence of a collar extension below the tegula on the left - hand side of the thorax ( g = 12.391 , p = 0.002 ) .
while 3 out of 5 b. magnus queens had this trait , all of the b. cryptarum queens possessed it ( 5 / 5 ) .
only one of the danish queens had a collar extension below the tegula on the right side , and this was a b. magnus ( table 4 ) .
melanisation within the collar there was a significant difference among species in the presence of melanised hairs scattered within the otherwise yellow collar ( g = 9.890 , p = 0.007 ; table 4 ) , another trait suggested to be diagnostic for b. cryptarum .
overall , 70 % of b. cryptarum queens possessed this state , as opposed to 25 % of b. lucorum queens and 33 % of b. magnus queens .
however , in the irish dataset there was no relationship between melanisation and species ( g = 1.738 , p = 0.419 ; table 4 ) .
again , unsurprisingly , melanisation was present in all of the morphologically identified danish b. cryptarum queens , only 1 of the b. lucorum queens and none of the b. magnus queens ( g = 14.623 , p = 0.001 ; table 4 ) .
discussion species determination is central to most assessments of biodiversity .
here we use dna barcoding to show that currently recommended morphological traits for identifying a cryptic species complex of bumblebees are unreliable at both local and european scales .
below , we discuss these results in detail before assessing the impact they have on bumblebee conservation in western europe .
coi barcode analysis indicated that three distinct molecular operational taxonomic units ( motus ) exist within the european b. lucorum complex , a finding congruent with previous studies based on molecular genetics [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] and secretions of the male labial glands [ 20 ] .
clade structure and genetic distances obtained in this study were similar to those obtained in previous studies [ 21 ] with intraspecific and interspecific genetic distance values of 0.001 - 0.004 and 0.033 to 0.044 respectively .
intraspecific and interspecific values obtained by murray ( 2008 ) and bertsch ( 2009 ) were 0.002 - 0.004 and 0.046 - 0.067 respectively .
these distance values clearly indicate a significantly greater level of divergence between the three taxa and although the use of dna sequences for species discovery or recognition is a contentious issue [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] our results are consistent with the view that the northern european b. lucorum complex is comprised of three species .
the highest amount of intraspecific coi sequence variability was observed for b. cryptarum , a result consistent with previous studies [ 22 ] .
there is a clear distinction between finnish b. cryptarum and those sampled from denmark , scotland and ireland .
this differentiation , which corresponds to two distinct haplotypes , is supported by nine polymorphisms .
this level of variation warrants further attention to evaluate the systematic significance of such divergence .
a similar distinction was observed between danish and irish b. magnus with both forming monophyletic groups sister to each other .
danish b. magnus possessed two diagnostic polymorphisms with respect to their irish counterparts ( table 1 ). b. lucorum demonstrated the lowest levels of intraspecific variation with only a single polymorphism observed across the danish , finnish , irish and orkney isles specimens .
these results may imply species differences in natural migration rates , and thus population structure across europe , but this needs to be investigated using more appropriate markers ( e.g. , microsatellites ) .
such differences have obvious conservation implications given the level of habitat fragmentation in the european landscape .
the discrete differences between the three species obtained from the dna barcode analysis were not replicated when morphological characters were analysed .
based on the characters most commonly cited as distinguishing these taxa , results from the morphological analyses failed to reveal a character that could reliably differentiate queens of the three species .
neither of the two most definitive character states - the presence of an s - shape on the collar , or extension of the collar under the wings - was consistently found in the species with which it has been associated as claimed previously [ 20 ] .
while there were clearly significant differences among species in the presence of such traits , or in the mean values of more quantitative traits , there was significant overlap among species .
while previous studies and bumblebee identification guides have claimed that specific morphological features can be used to identify queens of these three cryptic species , few [ 23 ] , [ 28 ] have quantitatively examined such claims , and these studies had no independent diagnostic of species identification .
our results agree with williams' [ 28 ] suggestion that these supposedly " diagnostic " characters overlap considerably and vary along a morphological continuum .
consequently , they are of limited use for morphological diagnosis of queens of b. cryptarum , b. lucorum and b. magnus .
the majority of characters used for bumblebee species differentiation in ecological studies are based on patterns relating to hair , which for bumblebees can be highly variable within species .
moreover , hair colour patterns often demonstrate a high degree of convergence and even muellerian mimicry between species [ 15 ] .
this can be clearly seen in our results ( fig. 4 ) , where hair patterns are clearly variable and form a continuum across species .
in contrast to our study , previous molecular studies [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] report specimens identified to species using coi sequencing that consistently display " species diagnostic " morphological characters .
however these studies ( and others ) may have suffered from insufficient or selective sampling ( it may be common for collectors to select ' typical ' specimens for study , either intentionally or otherwise ) .
the number of specimens included in the bertsch et al's. , study [ 20 ] was very low ( n = 2 sequences per species ) .
in total , 28 lucorum complex queens were included in the molecular analysis of bertsch [ 21 ] and although 18 distinct geographic regions were represented in that study , the low sample size ( max n = 4 , with the majority of locations represented by n = 1 ) could not result in a conclusive evaluation of the morphological variance that exists within a given locality .
the presence of clear geographical variation in colour patterns across species , as found in our study , suggests that additional investigations across the range of these species involving a randomly collected and large numbers of queens would be highly valuable .
the ability to conduct meaningful ecological and population genetic studies of particular taxa is reliant on our ability to correctly identify species .
the results of our study clearly indicate that the potential for misidentification within the b. lucorum complex is high , particularly when dealing with randomly sampled large collections .
consequently , studies involving b. lucorum s.l. conducted prior to the utilisation of molecular methods for species identification may be subject to erroneous interpretation .
the work of waters et al [ 23 ] highlights the problems associated with field - based identifications of workers from the b. lucorum complex .
the authors recommend the accompaniment of ecological studies with molecular methods for species identification .
while this provides a solution , it is unlikely to be one that can be used for large - scale abundance and diversity studies .
we hope that by demonstrating the problems with current characteristics used for queen species identification in the b. lucorum species complex , we will motivate the discovery of accurate morphological markers .
finally , we have shown that dna barcoding for species identification can provide the basis for such quantitative studies .

objective to investigate to what extent various oral health variables are associated with taste ability in acutely hospitalized elderly .
background impaired taste may contribute to weight loss in elderly .
many frail elderly have poor oral health characterized by caries , poor oral hygiene , and dry mouth .
however , the possible influence of such factors on taste ability in acutely hospitalized elderly has not been investigated .
materials and methods the study was cross - sectional .
a total of 174 ( 55 men ) acutely hospitalized elderly , coming from their own homes and with adequate cognitive function , were included .
dental status , decayed teeth , oral bacteria , oral hygiene , dry mouth and tongue changes were recorded .
growth of oral bacteria was assessed with crt ( r ) bacteria kit .
taste ability was evaluated with 16 taste strips impregnated with sweet , sour , salty and bitter taste solutions in 4 concentrations each .
correct identification was given score 1 , and maximum total taste score was 16 .
results mean age was 84 yrs .
( range 70 - 103 yrs. ) .
total taste score was significantly and markedly reduced in patients with decayed teeth , poor oral hygiene , high growth of oral bacteria and dry mouth .
sweet and salty taste were particularly impaired in patients with dry mouth .
sour taste was impaired in patients with high growth of oral bacteria .
conclusion this study shows that taste ability was reduced in acutely hospitalized elderly with caries activity , high growth of oral bacteria , poor oral hygiene , and dry mouth .
our findings indicate that good oral health is important for adequate gustatory function .
maintaining proper oral hygiene in hospitalized elderly should therefore get high priority among hospital staff .
introduction diminished taste perception and decreased ability to identify and discriminate basic taste qualities may deprive people of the pleasures of eating and of quality of life .
impaired taste may have serious consequences for sick elderly [ 1 ] .
poor appetite , weight loss and under - nutrition are frequently observed among elderly admitted to hospital [ 2 ] - [ 5 ] .
in addition , acute disease often leads to depletion of proteins and essential nutrients which may further aggravate the patients' general health [ 6 ] .
taste loss may be one of several factors contributing to poor appetite , reduced dietary intake and weight loss in elderly patients .
[ 7 ] - [ 10 ] .
adequate gustatory function is therefore important for these old patients in order to fight disease and regain a healthy constitution .
reduced taste ability has been associated with gender [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , increasing age [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , diseases and drugs [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
further , it has been claimed that some oral conditions , such as wearing dentures [ 17 ] , dry mouth [ 18 ] and coated tongue [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , may cause taste impairment .
many frail elderly have poor oral health , characterized by heavy plaque accumulation , mucosal inflammation , hypo - salivation and high caries activity [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] .
however , as far as we know , only one study has examined the association between oral hygiene and taste ability before and after professional oral care [ 25 ] .
further , the possible influence of specific conditions such as caries and oral bacteria on taste ability has not been studied .
to what extent compromised oral health in general may interfere with taste ability in acutely hospitalized elderly also remains to be investigated .
the aim of the present study was therefore to examine whether various oral health variables , such as caries , oral bacteria , oral hygiene , oral dryness and tongue changes may influence taste ability in such patients .
materials and methods ethics statement the present cross - sectional study was approved by the national committee for medical and health research ethics in norway , and carried out at oslo university hospital , aker , norway between november 2009 and october 2010 .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants .
study population inclusion criteria elderly at least 70 years old , living in their own homes prior to hospitalization for acute medical problems , and who met the inclusion criteria , were consecutively invited to participate .
the patients were evaluated for participation at least 48 hours after hospital admission by two experienced physicians in geriatric medicine .
the physicians were trained to evaluate patients for participation in clinical studies with similar guidelines and criteria .
evaluation of cognitive function was based on thorough interviews with the patients .
exclusion criteria patients less than 70 years of age , patients with reduced cognitive function , patients coming from nursing homes , and patients with terminal diseases were not eligible for participation .
two hundred and thirty - four patients were asked to participate , and 200 accepted .
various reasons for non - attendance were as follows : " feeling too sick , too tired , just had my teeth checked , and i have only dentures , etc. " twenty - six patients did not have taste assessments .
all twenty - six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria .
they had accepted to participate and had signed the letter of informed consent .
however , when they were scheduled for taste testing , they were not available due to practical hospital logistics such as busy with laboratory tests , medical examinations or treatment , having visitors , eating , or dismissed from hospital .
drop out was not associated with the clinical condition of the patient , or any other underlying causes .
they were not tested any time later .
thus , 174 patients were included in the study .
methods examination of patients the patients were instructed not to eat or drink one hour prior to the examination , because this could interfere with the taste testing and the registration of oral dryness .
the oral examination was carried out at the bedside by a dentist , using two mirrors , a dental probe , and a head lamp .
a predefined questionnaire was used to acquire information about age , education , and smoking as well as relevant clinical information .
information about the number of prescribed drugs was obtained from medical records in the hospital .
dental status dental status was registered according to who 's oral health surveys , basic methods 4th edition [ 26 ] .
the number of own teeth was noted .
teeth with crowns were counted as own teeth .
a tooth was recorded as decayed if there was loss of tooth substance , and the tooth surface was soft on probing .
in addition , " own teeth only " , " own teeth with dentures " or " dentures only " were recorded .
oral hygiene plaque on teeth and / or dentures ( plaque score ) and mucosal and / or gingival inflammation ( mucosal score ) were assessed with the mucosal - plaque score ( mps ) [ 27 ] - [ 32 ] .
the index has been validated and tested for both intra - and inter - examiners agreement [ 27 ] , [ 33 ] .
the index has 4 graded scores for mucosal and / or gingival inflammation and 4 graded scores for the amount of plaque accumulation on teeth and / or dentures .
denture stomatitis , ulcers and decubitus are included in the mucosal score .
the recordings for the mucosal score ( ms ) were as follows ; ( 1 ) normal appearance of gingiva and oral mucosa , ( 2 ) mild inflammation , ( 3 ) moderate inflammation and ( 4 ) severe inflammation .
the plaque score ( ps ) on teeth and / or dentures were as follows ; ( 1 ) no easily visible plaque , ( 2 ) small amounts of hardly visible plaque , ( 3 ) moderate amounts of plaque , and ( 4 ) abundant amounts of confluent plaque .
the mps is the sum of mucosal score and plaque score , and the score range is from 2 to 8 .
scores between 2 and 4 describe good or acceptable oral hygiene .
mps >= 5 reflects un - acceptable / poor oral hygiene , and this score has been selected by experienced clinicians in previous studies according to the severity of the recorded oral hygiene status [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 31 ] .
a criteria catalog with photos , showing examples of all the various conditions according to the graded scores , was presented for visual calibration [ 34 ] .
oral dryness to express oral dryness , three different variables were selected .
these variables were the " mirror test " [ 35 ] , registration of dry tongue and measurements of stimulated whole saliva .
to assess dry mouth with the mirror test , the back of a dental mirror was moved across the inside of the buccal mucosa immediately after opening the mouth when starting the oral inspection .
if the dental mirror was sticking to the mucosa , friction was noted .
dry tongue was recorded if the tongue was completely devoid of moisture .
assessment of stimulated whole saliva was done with the " chewing and spitting method " [ 36 ] the patients were asked to chew on paraffin wax for approximately 1 min .
to soften the wax .
after emptying the mouth of saliva , the timer was started .
the patients were instructed to chew vigorously on the paraffin wax for 3 minutes while spitting into pre - weighted plastic container , whenever needed .
the amount of saliva collected during paraffin wax chewing , was immediately weighted on a precisa 2200c electronic scale ( precisa gravimetrics ag , 8953 dietikon , switzerland ) , which was calibrated daily .
hypo - salivation was defined as stimulated whole saliva <= 0.6 g / min .
bacterial growth the amount of streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli in stimulated whole saliva were assessed with the crt ( r ) bacteria kit ( ivoclar vivadent ag , fl - 9494 schaan , lichtenstein ) [ 37 ] .
the collected , stimulated whole saliva was dripped onto the growth medium and incubated for 48 hours at 37 c degrees .
the crt bacteria count was expressed as low colony forming units ( cfu < 105 / ml saliva ) and high colony forming units ( cfu >= 10 5 / ml saliva ) .
some patients had severe problems with chewing paraffin wax due to either dry mouth or poorly fitted dentures .
thus , 158 patients had stimulated whole saliva collected , and 153 patients had valid assessments of oral bacteria .
tongue changes coated tongue was defined as a thick layer of plaque on the anterior dorsum of the tongue to be scraped off [ 38 ] .
the tiny layer of white coating from normal shedding of filiform papillae was not recorded as tongue coating .
the tongue was classified as atrophic if at least 50 % of the tongue was devoid of papillae .
in addition to visual inspection of the tongue , photos were taken for verification of the clinical diagnosis .
taste ability testing whole mouth gustatory function was assessed with the " taste strips " method [ 39 ] .
the method has been validated and calibrated against the well - established " three - drop taste test " and shown to give a significant correlation with the " three - drop taste test " [ 40 ] .
the taste strips were prefabricated and impregnated with sweet , sour , salty , and bitter taste solutions in four different concentrations each .
the concentrations were : sweet taste ; 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 g / ml sucrose , sour taste ; 0.05 , 0.09 , 0.165 and 0.3 g / ml citric acid , salty taste ; 0.016 , 0.04 , 0.1 and 0.25 g / ml nacl and bitter taste ; 0.0004 , 0.0009 , 0.0024 , 0.006 g / ml quinine - hcl .
the strips were given to the participants according to a predefined procedure , starting with the weakest concentration and ending with the strongest .
both participant and examiner were blinded as to which taste quality or taste concentration given to the participant .
the individual taste strip was placed in the middle of the anterior region of the tongue .
the patients were allowed to suck on the strip for maximum twenty seconds .
a poster with the words ; sweet , sour , salty , bitter , was placed on the table in front of the patients who had to decide on one of the taste qualities without delay .
before starting , and in between every taste strip , the patients were asked to rinse with water to cleanse the mouth .
the patients confirmed that the former taste had disappeared before the next taste strip was placed on the tongue .
correct identification was given score 1 and incorrect identification , score 0 .
the correct scores were summarized , and maximum total taste score was 16 .
each individual taste quality was also given a sum score , ranging from 0 to 4 .
sample size determination information about variability in taste ability , where taste was measured with the same " taste strip " method as in our study , was available from a pilot study , where the standard deviation of the total taste score was 2.5 .
we thus assumed that the corresponding standard deviation would be 2.5 in the planned study .
we considered differences >= 1 in mean total taste score between two groups to be of clinical interest .
it was shown that with 174 patients included in our study , we had at least 80 % test power to detect a mean difference in total taste score of at least 1 between two subgroups , provided that the smallest subgroup contained at least 30 patients .
thus , our study appeared to have acceptable test power .
statistics when comparing continuous variables in two groups , a two - sided independent samples t - test was used as long as the distribution of the variables was sufficiently close to normal distribution .
if not , a two - sided mann - whitney test was used .
spearman 's rho was applied to test associations between two continuous variables .
multivariate linear regression analysis was used to adjust for gender .
the level of significance was set to 5 % .
pasw statistics , version18.0 ( spss inc. chicago , il 60611 , usa ) was applied for statistical analysis .
quality assurance of data transfer from paper records was carried out by monitoring every 10th record .
results demographic data and clinical variables the mean ( sd ) age of 174 patients ( n = 55 men ) with valid taste scores was 83.5 +/ - 6.1 years .

sweet and bitter sum scores were not significantly associated with any of these variables , and are therefore not shown in the table .
dichotomous oral health variables and taste quality table 4 shows the influence of various dichotomous oral health variables on the basic taste qualities sweet , sour and salty .
sweet sum score was significantly lower in patients with friction with the dental mirror , dry tongue and atrophic tongue ( p = 0.007 , p = 0.001 , and p = 0.009 ) , respectively .
sour sum score was significantly lower in patients with high growth of lactobacilli ( p = 0.001 ) .
salty sum score was significantly lower in patients with friction with the dental mirror and dry tongue ( p = 0.009 and p = 0.030 ) respectively , both indicative of dry mouth .
the possible influence of these oral health variables on bitter sum score is not presented in the table due to lack of significant differences .

significant p - values are adjusted for gender and shown in parentheses .
none of the oral health variables had significant impact on bitter taste quality , and the results are therefore not presented in the table .
1,2 streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli were assessed in 153 patients .
confounding factors potential confounding factors in this study might be age , gender , smoking , education , and number of medications .
all were tested against the outcome variables .
however , only gender was significantly associated with the taste scores .
thus , all the significant findings were adjusted for gender only .
the majority of the oral health variables with significant associations with total taste score , sweet , sour and salty taste scores remained significant after adjusting for gender ( table 2 and 3 ) .
however , the association between sour taste and decayed teeth was no longer significant after adjusting for gender .
discussion in the present study we show that taste ability is significantly impaired in acutely hospitalized elderly with decayed teeth , high growth of oral bacteria associated with caries , poor oral hygiene and dry mouth .
the majority of these findings remained significant after adjusting for gender .
caries is associated with lactobacillus , streptococcus mutans and poor oral hygiene [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
it has been suggested that taste loss associated with poor oral health could be due to toxins and inflammatory products produced by the oral bacteria [ 43 ] .
in our study , sour taste was particularly impaired in patients with high lactobacilli growth .
these oral bacteria proliferate in an acidic environment , and they also produce acid themselves .
although the mechanisms involved in taste transduction are rather complex [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , an explanation could be that the acid produced by the bacteria may cause adaption in sour taste perception , and thus increasing the taste threshold for sour .
further , we found that poor oral hygiene was associated with reduced total taste score and salty taste .
this is in agreement with langan et al .
[ 25 ] , concluding , in a small study with 15 participants , that professional oral hygiene improved taste acuity for salty taste as well as sweet taste .
in our study , no difference in taste ability was found between patients with and without tongue coating .
this is in contrast to a number of studies , e.g. , quirynen et al .
[ 46 ] , ohno et al .
[ 19 ] , and kostka et al .
[ 20 ] , reporting that taste sensitivity improved after tongue cleaning .
however , their study design and methods were quite different from those in our study .
we examined taste ability in patients with and without coated tongue , while they tested taste sensitivity before and after removal of tongue coating with tongue brushing .
hospitalized elderly frequently use a high number of drugs daily , which may induce xerostomia and hypo - salivation [ 47 ] .
saliva is essential for bringing food particles and taste stimuli to the taste buds in the oral cavity [ 48 ] .
reduced saliva flow is reported to be associated with taste loss [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
in our study in acutely hospitalized elderly , dry mouth was associated with impaired taste .
this is in accordance with both kamel et al .
[ 18 ] and weiffenbach et al .
[ 51 ] , reporting that patients with sjogren 's syndrome , which is characterized by oral dryness , had reduced taste sensitivity compared with controls .
some studies claim that people with dentures have higher taste threshold [ 17 ] , [ 52 ] and also elevated retronasal flavour threshold [ 53 ] , than people without dentures .
in our study there was no difference in taste scores between patients with full dentures and patients with natural dentition .
why our finding is not in line with those other studies is not known , but could be due to different methods used .
in our study , atrophic tongue was associated with reduced sweet score .
it remains to be explained why atrophy of the tongue papillae affected the sweet taste quality more than the other taste qualities .
limitations and strengths our study has some limitations .
the " mirror test " is a crude clinical method for estimation of buccal dryness .
this test has not been properly validated .
however , it has been used as a clinical reference when more sophisticated devices have been tested for possible use in assessing buccal dryness [ 35 ] .
furthermore , the registrations of caries were not performed under optimal conditions , and no x - rays were taken to support the findings .
this could cause underestimation of caries activity in these patients .
still we do not believe that this will change the main conclusions of our study .
when assessing atrophic tongue based on visual inspection , there is always a risk of either over or under - estimations .
however , the prevalence of atrophic tongue in our study was similar to a previous study at the same hospital ward [ 54 ] .
although the study took place in a difficult setting , we managed to collect substantial information about several oral health parameters and their associations with gustatory function in a relatively large number of very old and severely ill acutely hospitalized elderly .
this is an important strength of our study .
conclusion the present study shows that taste ability was significantly reduced in acutely hospitalized elderly with caries activity , high growth of oral bacteria , poor oral hygiene , and dry mouth .
our findings suggest that good oral health is important for adequate gustatory function in such patients .
maintaining proper oral hygiene in hospitalized elderly should therefore get high priority among hospital staff .
further , healthy oral conditions contributing to better taste perception , may stimulate appetite and enhance caloric intake .
this may help to prevent nutritional deficiency in hospitalized elderly and improve the patients' general health and quality of life .

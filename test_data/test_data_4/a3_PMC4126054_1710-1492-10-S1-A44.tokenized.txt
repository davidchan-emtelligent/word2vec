there is published evidence that airway remodeling is present in pre - school children , often before the diagnosis of asthma is established [ 1 ] .
it is thought that this increased risk relates to the fact that hrv infections facilitate airway remodeling in asthma [ 2 ] .
a feature of airway remodeling is the proximity of airway smooth muscle ( asm ) to the subepithelial region among other pathological changes [ 3 ] .
smooth muscle is also known to exist in two distinct phenotypes : secretory and contractile [ 4 ] .
we have recently shown that hrv infection of human bronchial epithelial cells ( hbec ) , both in vitro and in vivo , results in the up - regulation of a number of airway remodeling mediators [ 5 ] .
we now sought to determine which asm phenotype ( contractile or secretory ) results in migration to supernatants from hrv infected hbe cells .
methods primary hbe cells were cultured in growth medium until confluent , pre - treated with 1 % insulin , transferrin , and selenium ( its ) medium for 24 hours and then stimulated with media - control or purified hrv - 16 .
the asm d9 cell - line was obtained from dr. andrew halayko 's laboratory and cultured in t - 175 flasks in 10 % serum containing dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ; gibco ; secretory phenotype ) or 1 % its f - 12 media ( gibco ; contractile ) until they reach ~ 90 - 100 % confluence .
hbec supernatants were used as chemo - attractants for asm ( 4hrs ) migration through 8 mum pore polycarbonate filter in a 48 - well boyden chamber .
migrated cells on filter were fixed / stained via diff - quick and counted at 200x view .
results asm d9 cells treated with 1 % its f12 media showed significantly higher levels of migration to fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) compared to asm d9 cells treated with serum ( n = 3 , p < 0.001 ) .
preliminary data indicate that hrv - 16 infected hbec supernatants resulted in greater asm migration compared to hbec supernatant from media alone in the asm d9 contractile phenotype but not the secretory phenotype .
conclusions these findings support our hypothesis that the contractile phenotype of asm d9 cells , which is more representative of asm cells in vivo , migrate better than the secretory phenotype .
additionally , strong preliminary data indicate that supernatants from hrv infected hbe cells promotes asm chemotaxis , and provides additional evidence for the role of contractile asm , and hrv infections , in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling .
ongoing studies will examine protein expression between the two different phenotypes .

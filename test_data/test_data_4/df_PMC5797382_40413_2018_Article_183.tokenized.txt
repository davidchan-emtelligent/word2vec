background in ascertained allergic sensitization to vespa crabro ( vc ) venom , the european guidelines still consider venom immunotherapy ( vit ) with vespula ( ve ) venom sufficient to achieve an adequate protection against vc. however , antigen 5 immunoblotting studies showed that a genuine sensitization to vc venom may exist .
in such cases , a specific vc venom would be preferable for vit treatment .
since in the last few years , vc venom extracts became available for diagnosis and desensitization , we assessed the efficacy and safety of vit with a vc - vit , compared to ve extract .
methods patients stung by vc , and carefully diagnosed for specific sensitization and indication to vit underwent a 5 - year course of immunotherapy with either ve or vc extracts .
the severity of reactions at the first sting ( pre - vit ) and after field re - stings ( during vit ) were compared .
results eighty - three patients , treated with ve extract and 130 patients treated with vc extract completed the 5 - year course of vit .
only a fraction of those patients ( 43,8 %) were field - re - stung by vc : 64 patients on vc vit and 69 on ve vit .
in the vc vit group , reactions at re - sting were : 50 negative , 12 large local reactions , 4 systemic reactions ( muller grade i ) .
in this group the vc vit efficacy was 93,8 % .
in the ve vit treated group the reactions at vc re - sting were : 51 negative , 10 large local reactions and 9 systemic reactions ( 5 muller i , 3 mueller iii , 1 muller iv ) .
in this group the overall efficacy of vit was 87,0 % .
the difference in efficacy between the two groups was not statistically significant , as previously reported in literature .
nonetheless , field sting systemic reactions muller iii and iv were recorded only in those patients receiving ve vit .
conclusion this observation suggests that in patients with ascertained vc - induced allergic reactions a specific vc vit , where available , would be more adequate , at least concerning the safety profile .
keywords hymenoptera venom allergy venom immunotherapy vespa crabro vespula safety efficacy anallergo spa , florence , italyissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background despite relatively rare , hymenoptera venom allergy ( hva ) remains an important cause of severe reactions and even fatalities .
the occurrence of insect sting - related mortality ranges between 0.03 and 0.48 fatalities per 1,000,000 individuals per year [ 1 ] .
the main responsible of those events are the insects belonging to the families of vespidae ( including vespinae and polistinae ) , being vespula and dolichovespula the most frequent allergenic sources .
within the genus vespula ( ve ) there are vespula germanica and vespula vulgaris , which are usually smaller in dimensions , and differ from dolichovespula in some other morphological aspects for instance , dolichovespula has a sagittaly more elonged head .
in europe , the most represented species are dolichovespula media , d. saxonica and d. sylvestris .
within the genus vespa , vespa crabro ( vc ) ( european hornet ) is predominant [ 2 ]. of note , also polistes spp. are currently recognized as a relevant allergenic source [ 3 ] .
the molecular composition of the venoms of the most represented species is known quite in detail .
the most important vespid allergens are phospholipase a1 , hyaluronidase , and antigen 5 ( ag - 5 ) .
these antigens are present both in ve and in vc venoms [ 4 ] .
among vespids , venoms are usually widely cross - reactive .
in fact , most of the ve allergens share a 95 % homology [ 5 , 6 ] in their aminoacid sequency .
as a consequence , also diagnostic and therapeutic extracts may display a certain cross - reactivity [ 7 , 8 ] .
also , there is a not negligible cross - reactivity among vespula , vespa and dolichovespula venoms [ 9 , 10 ] .
studies conducted in the mediterranean area showed that the risk of developing severe systemic reactions is increased by about three - fold with vc , as compared to honeybee or ve species [ 11 ] .
it can be hypothesized that some of the patients with hva due to vc were previously sensitized by ve stings .
thus , in those subjects with an ascertained vc systemic reactions , the venom immunotherapy ( vit ) with ve extracts would be sufficient to confer protection , and this is what the european guidelines suggest [ 12 - 14 ] .
on the other hand , cap - inhibition and immunoblotting - based studies showed that those techniques remained inconclusive in about 50 % patients , suggesting that sensitization against vc ag - 5 is relevant and genuine [ 11 ] .
the phylogenetic tree , concerning ag - 5 , confirms that ve and vc are quite distant [ 15 , 16 ] .
since a commercial extract for diagnosis and vit for vc is now available in italy ( and can be used everywhere as named - patient product ) , we compared the efficacy and safety of vc and ve vit in patients with ascertained reactions to vc. this was done directly evaluating the field re - stings during vit .
methods all the involved patients were recruited at various allergy centres in italy ( como , faenza , firenze and rimini ) and received vit according to the eaaci guidelines [ 11 ] and standard of care .
most patients , obviously , received ve vit , since vc preparations were not available before 1990 .
consecutive patients referred to our units for a previous systemic reaction following a vc sting ( from to 1990 to 2016 ) were observed .
only patients who could recognize or document with certainty vc as the stinging hymenoptera were included .
systemic reactions were graded according to mueller [ 17 ] .
the diagnostic procedures were those recommended by the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology [ 11 , 18 ] .
these procedures included skin prick test , intradermal test and cap - assay for honeybee , vespula spp .
( alk , hornsholm , denmark ; stallergenes , antony cedex , france ) , polistes dominula and vespa crabro ( anallergo , florence , italy ) .
in parallel , specific ige by immunocap - assay ( phadia ab , upssala , sweden ) for the mentioned allergenic sources and serum tryptase by immunocap ( phadia ab , upssala , sweden ) were carried out .
according to the results of diagnostic tests , clinical indications , judgement of physicians , and availability of the vc extract the patients were allocated to either ve vit ( alk , hornsholm , denmark ; stallergenes , antony cedex , france ) or vc ( vespa crabro , anallergo , florence , italy ) vit .
a modified rush protocol was used in both the vc and ve groups .
for ve vit , an aqueous extract ( 100 mcg / ml ) was used during build - up and maintenance .
for vc vit , an aqueous extract ( 100 mcg / ml ) was used in the first two sessions , then a tyrosine - absorbed extract was given at maintenance ( table 1 ) .
during the first 3 sessions the escalating doses were given at 30 - min intervals , until the 4th session , when the maintenance dose of 100 mcg / ml was administered .
at maintenance , a 100 mcg / ml dose was given monthly for the first year , then every 6 or 8 weeks until the 5th year .
on field re - sting reactions ( number and severity ) by vc were assessed and described in the two groups .
if there was more than one re - sting without reactions in the same patient , only the first re - sting was counted and recorded .

to compare the efficacy between the two therapies in reducing the reaction to subsequent stings , we considered only patients who completed the course of vit ( 60 months ) and were field re - stung by vc within this time frame .
we also compared the most severe reactions at re - sting versus those reported at the initial diagnosis , and the most severe reactions to sting reported during the 5 years of the vit course .
moreover , we compared the results from the ige specific immunoassay and the skin test ( in logarithmic scale ) at time 0 and at the end of the therapy ( after 60 months ) using a general linear model ( glm ) analysis for repeated measures .
sex ratio , age , specific ige values , skin test results and worst reaction reported at baseline were compared between the two groups ( ve vs vc ) to assess the homogeneity of datasets at the beginning of vit .
sex ratio , intradermal results to vc and systemic reactions by vc at baseline were compared using a pearson chi - square analysis , whereas the other values were compared using the student 's t test or mann - whitney tests for independent samples in the case of not homogeneous variance at the welch ' test for variance homogeneity [ 19 ] .
for all post - treatment univariate tests , we report both the one - and two - tails test , under the assumption that vc vit could be more effective .
the probability distributions for the mann - withney tests , as well as for the chi - square tests were estimated using a permutation ( exact ) approach [ 20 ] .
all statistical analyses were carried out using ibm ( r ) spss ( r ) statistics ver .
24. results systemic reactions were graded according to mueller [ 18 ] .
in total , 303 patients ( 229 male , age range 10 - 78 ) ( table 2 ) with a systemic reaction due to ascertained vc sting were included. of them , 83 received ve vit and 220 vc vit .
there was no significant difference between the two groups at baseline , but for age and threshold intradermal reactivity to vc ( table 2 ) .

the ve group patients totalized 99 on - field re - stings .
we compared the worst reaction at baseline ( before vit ) , and the worst reaction at re - sting during vit .
in this group , during vit there were : 51 no reaction , 10 large local reactions and 9 systemic reactions ( 5 grade mueller i , 3 grade iii , 1 grade iv ) ( table 3 ) .
the vc group patients had a total of 98 re - stings : 48 no reaction , 12 large local reactions and 4 systemic reactions ( all grade mueller i ) ( table 3 ). of note , 93.8 % ( 60 / 64 ) of patients treated with vc venom and 87.0 % ( 60 / 69 ) of those treated with ve venom , were protected at re - sting .
this difference was not statistically significant ( x2 = 1.738 , df = 1 , p exact ( 2 - tails ) = 0.247 , exact ( 1 - tail ) = 0.153 ) .

on the other hand no significant effect between the different venoms ( between subjects ; f1 , 118 = 0.043 , p = 0.837 ) , to the baseline values of intradermal reactivity to vc ( between subjects ; f1 , 118 = 0.985 , p = 0.323 ) or to specific ige to vc ( between subjects ; f1 , 118 = 0.979 , p = 0.325 ) , even when controlling for possible within subjects second - term interactions ( all vit interaction terms p >= 0.05 ) .
no patient treated with vc venom had systemic reactions more severe than mueller i , whereas in the ve group 5.8 % ( 4 / 69 ) had mueller iii or iv reactions ( table 3 ) .
in this case , we detected an almost significant difference comparing the number of severe reactions out of the total number of reactions in the two groups ( ve = 4 / 9 , vc , 0 / 4 ; x2 = 2.568 , df = 1 , pexact ( 2 - tails ) = 0.120 , p1 - tail = 0.069 ) , particularly assuming a 1 - tail test , given the expectation is that the vc vaccine is more effective than the ve one .
similarly , when comparing mild reactions ( large local + mueller 1 ) and severe reactions ( mueller 2 - 4 ) in the two groups an almost significant trend was seen ( ve , 15 / 4 ; vc , 16 / 0 ; x2 = 3.803 , df = 1 , p exact ( 2 - tails ) = 0.109 , p exact ( 1 - tail ) = 0.074 ) clearly due to the small sample size .
there was no severe adverse event due to vit treatments : only llrs occurred during the build - up phase , not interfering with the administration schedule .
finally , the safety of the vc vit was confirmed as safe as for other preparations [ 10 , 14 ] .
discussion vc stings are frequently at risk for severe or life - threatening reactions in sensitized subjects [ 10 ] .
usually , in patients with ascertained systemic reactions from vc , vit with ve extracts is considered effective and safe .
nonetheless , some patients may have a sensitization to epitopes of vc allergens [ 21 ] that are not covered by the standard ve extracts , as shown by mass spectrometry analyses [ 22 ] .
as a matter of fact , in a previous study involving 202 patients with vc sting and treated with ve vit [ 13 ] , the use of ve vit was justified by the fact that the majority of patients would be not have previously been sensitized by ve stings .
in this study , after field resting , out of 8 stings 5 were negative , one had a large local , and two systemic reactions .
the present study , by assessing in prospective way the characteristics of field re - stings , showed that both ve and vc vit are equally effective , thus overall confirming the data reported in literature so far .
nonetheless , reactions mueller iii and muller iv grade at field re - sting were observed only in patients treated with ve - vit ; this suggests the hypothesis that in patients with vc sting systemic reactions , a vc - vit might be more adequate .
the difference was not formally significant , but this can be ascribed to the small number of patients who actually had severe reactions ( n = 13 ) .
it is true that the study was not randomized , but populations were homogeneous , and the same diagnostic procedures were used in all patients .
in addition this model is quite " clean " since vc can be easily distinguished from other species , due to the dimensions and the essentially nocturnal habits .
a gap still exists in the diagnostic approach since , at present , recombinant molecules for diagnosis are available for ag - 5 of ve and polistes , but not for vc , which partly differ from the other species [ 14 , 23 ] .
so far , the literature about vc allergy remains poor [ 23 ] .
probably , the introduction of diagnostic preparation more specific for the various species will further refine the prescription of vit .
conclusion in conclusion , our results suggest that in patients with ascertained vc systemic reactions , a vc - specific vit , where available , might be more adequate at least from the safety viewpoint .
where vc vit is not commercially available , the ve vit can be used , with a comparable efficacy .
in addition , the safety of the vc vit preparation herein described is comparable to that of the ve preparations , during the rush build - up phase. of course , future studies including larger samples are required .

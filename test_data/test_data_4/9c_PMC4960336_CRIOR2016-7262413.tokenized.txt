a 25 - year - old man with a pronation - external rotation type of fracture was surgically treated using a fibular plate .
five years later , he underwent resection of bone hyperplasia because of the ankle pain and limitation of range of motion .
thereafter , the left ankle became intermittently painful , which persisted for about one year .
he presented at the age of 43 with persistent ankle pain .
physical and image analysis findings indicated a diagnosis of posttraumatic posterior tibial tendinitis , which we surgically treated using tendoscopy .
endoscopic findings showed tenosynovitis and fibrillation on the tendon surface .
we cleaned and removed the synovium surrounding the tendon and deepened the posterior tibial tendon groove to allow sufficient space for the posterior tibial tendon .
full weight - bearing ambulation was permitted one day after surgery and he returned to his occupation in the construction industry six weeks after surgery .
the medial aspect of the ankle was free of pain and symptoms at a review two years after surgery .
although tendoscopic surgery for stage 1 posterior tibial tendon dysfunction has been reported , tendoscopic surgery to treat posttraumatic posterior tibial tendinitis has not .
our experience with this patient showed that tendoscopic surgery is useful not only for stage 1 posterior tibial dysfunction , but also for posttraumatic posterior tibial tendinitis .
1. introduction tendoscopy of the tendons around the posterior ankle joint can be technically demanding but can offer a unique perspective of pathological processes .
some tendoscopic procedures have recently been applied to the foot and ankle [ 1 ] .
an endoscopic tendon procedure was first described by wertheimer et al .
[ 2 ] in 1995 .
van dijk et al. described the application of tendoscopic surgery for the posterior tibial [ 3 ] and peroneal tendons [ 4 ] .
tendoscopic synovectomy can provide good control of stage 1 posterior tibial tendon dysfunction ( pttd ) [ 5 , 6 ] .
on the other hand , damage to the posterior tibial tendon and / or its retinacula can be associated with ankle fractures [ 7 , 8 ] .
stenosing tenosynovitis may follow ankle fractures .
here , we applied tendoscopic surgery to treat posttraumatic posterior tibial tendinitis .
2. case report a 43 - year - old male construction worker presented with left medial ankle pain .
he fell and twisted the left ankle at the age of 25 years .
fibular fracture was diagnosed using simple x - rays and then he was admitted to the emergency department for open reduction and internal fixation using a fibular plate at a hospital near the accident location .
five years later , left ankle pain developed and the range of ankle motion became limited , so he underwent resection of bone hyperplasia .
thereafter , the left ankle became intermittently painful , which persisted for about one year .
the initial examination at our hospital ( 18 years after the ankle fracture and 43 years old at this time ) revealed tenderness along the posterior tibial tendon and a left ankle range of motion from 10degrees of dorsiflexion to 60degrees of plantarflexion .
he was overweight at that time ( his body mass index was 35.6 kg / m2 ) .
the left foot was relatively flat , but too much toe sign was not visible and he could perform left single - leg heel raises .
x - rays revealed bone hyperplasia between the distal tibia and fibula ( figure 1 ) .
three - dimensional computed tomography ( 3d - ct ) revealed tibial bone hyperplasia along the posterior tibial tendon ( figure 2 ) .
the posterior tibial tendon had spotted isointensity in regions of low intensity on t1 - weighted magnetic resonance ( mr ) images and spotted high intensity in low - intensity t2 - weighted images ( figure 3 ) .
injecting lidocaine into the posterior tibial tendon sheath relieved the pain .
thus , we diagnosed posttraumatic posterior tibial tendinitis .
we planned a tendoscopic procedure instead of an open procedure because an open procedure needs opening the tendon sheath and postoperative immobilization such as a cast or brace .
the patient underwent left posterior tibial tendoscopy using a 2.5 mm 30degrees arthroscope under spinal anesthesia .
we used the two main portals described by van dijk in 1997 [ 3 ] .
the distal portal was 2 cm below and anterior to the medial malleolus , whereas the proximal portal was 2 cm posterior and superior to the medial malleolus .
an ultrasound machine ( noblus ; hitachi aloka , tokyo , japan ) and a high - frequency linear probe ( l64 linear probe 18 - 5 mhz ; hitachi aloka ) are prepared with a sterile ultrasound probe cover and sterile gel .
we used an ultrasonography in order to introduce a scope easily , reliably , and safely .
irrigation solution was injected into the posterior tendon sheath under long - axis view along the posterior tibial tendon of sonography just before incising the skin ( figure 4 ) .
we opened the tendon sheath via the skin incision by blunt dissection using a hemostat under sonography .
tendoscopic findings revealed tenosynovitis and fibrillation on the surface of the tendon .
we cleaned and removed the synovium surrounding the tendon using an arthroscopic shaver system and a radiofrequency wand for small joints ( figure 5 ) .
moreover , we deepened the groove for the posterior tibial tendon using a bone cutter / shaver so as the posterior tibial tendon can move smoothly .
after groove deepening , there was one - or two - millimeter space around the tendon .
weight - bearing ambulation was permitted one day after surgery and the patient returned to full - time work in the construction industry six weeks after surgery .
at the most recent review two years after surgery , he had no medial symptoms and he was capable of all types of heavy work despite occasional slight pain related to sinus tarsi syndrome .
his preoperative and postoperative scores on the american orthopaedic foot and ankle society ( aofas ) ankle - hindfoot scale were 71 and 90 points , respectively .
each author certifies that his or her institution approved the human protocol for this investigation and that all investigations were conducted in conformity with ethical principles of research .
the patient and his family were informed that data from the case would be submitted for publication and gave their consent .
3. discussion advances in small joint arthroscopy have led to the development of many effective arthroscopic and endoscopic procedures for foot and ankle conditions [ 1 ] .
van dijk et al .
[ 3 ] first described tendoscopy of the posterior tendon to manage tendon pathology .
chow et al .
[ 5 ] reported that the results of a case series of tendoscopic synovectomy for six patients with stage 1 pttd were as good as those reported for open synovectomy [ 9 , 10 ] .
lui [ 11 ] described tendoscopy - assisted posterior tibial tendon reconstruction for stage 2 pttd , and g. khazen and c. khazen [ 6 ] reported a case series in which 8 ( 89 %) of 9 patients with stage 1 pttd reported absent or minor pain after undergoing tendoscopic synovectomy .
bulstra et al .
[ 12 ] performed 16 procedures in 11 patients that included chronic synovitis ( n = 2 ) , screw removal from the medial malleolus ( n = 1 ) , and posterior ankle anatomy ( n = 2 ) .
an irregular sliding channel was smoothed out in two patients and two asymptomatic patients underwent tenosynovectomy and tendon release .
the outcome of posterior tibial tendoscopic synovectomy to treat posttraumatic tenosynovitis in our patient was successful .
the posterior tibial tendon that plays an important role in normal hindfoot function lies close to the medial malleolus and beneath the flexor retinaculum , which binds the tendon to the bone .
thus , this tendon can become injured when the ankle is fractured .
crim et al .
[ 13 ] described a partly torn posterior tibial tendon in 4.2 % of hindfoot fractures and that the tendon had become trapped between fracture fragments in 16.1 % of them .
the initial x - ray image of the ankle of our patient was unavailable , but the later x - ray suggested a relatively proximal fibula fracture and hyperossification between the distal tibia and fibula .
these findings indicated a pronation - external rotation ( per ) injury , which might have led to a deltoid ligament tear or medial malleolus fracture that may have bled into the posterior tendon sheath , ultimately leading to ossification of the posterior tendon sheath .
posttraumatic and postsurgical complaints of pain at the posterior margin of the medial malleolus often pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge .
in the absence of intra - articular pathology , adhesions and irregularities in the tendon sliding channel can be responsible for symptoms in this region .
open tendon release requires postoperative plaster immobilization with the subsequent potential for new adhesion formation [ 14 ] .
tendoscopic surgery offers the advantages of decreased morbidity , early range of motion , reduced postoperative pain , and rapid recovery [ 15 ] .
our patient had a tendoscopic surgery and it did not require opening the tendon sheath , so postoperative immobilization such as a cast or brace was unnecessary .
however , because osteophytes could not be resected along with the posterior tibial tendon by tendoscopic surgery , we enlarged the tendon cavity by deepening the posterior tibial tendon groove .
since postoperative immobilization was not needed , tendon adhesion was not a concern .
tendoscopic surgery enabled range - of - motion exercises to be started immediately , which prevented scar tissue formation and adhesions .
therefore , tendoscopic surgery for this patient was effective and practical .
tendoscopy is technically demanding .
to introduce a scope into the posterior tendon sheath requires experience and finesse , and it is even more difficult in the presence of a subcutaneous irrigation fluid leak .
therefore , we used ultrasonographic guidance .
we recommend using ultrasound guidance for especially unexperienced surgeons because it is an easy tool which enable a reliable insertion of an endoscope into the tendon sheath .
yamamoto et al .
[ 16 ] reported using ultrasonographic assistance to approach a wrist ganglion .
although ultrasonographic resolution is limited , recent improvements in both hardware and software have made it an excellent , noninvasive , and dynamic technique for assessing the musculoskeletal system [ 17 , 18 ] as it can visualize not only the posterior tibial tendon , but also vessels , nerves , and other tissues such as the long flexor muscles of the toes .
these features considerably reduce the risk of serious postprocedural complications .
we consider that sonography combined with endo / arthroscopy represents a useful and practical approach to soft tissue surgery .
in conclusion , ultrasonography - assisted tendoscopic synovectomy is useful for posterior tendon synovitis .
tendoscopic synovectomy requires specific skills , but it is more favorable than open synovectomy in terms of postoperative rehabilitation and cosmetic aspects .
ultrasonographic assistance also facilitates the introduction of a scope into the tendon sheath .

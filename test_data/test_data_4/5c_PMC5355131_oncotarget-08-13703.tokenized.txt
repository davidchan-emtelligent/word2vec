cytotoxic t lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , a potent immunoregulatory molecule , can down - regulate t - cell activation and inhibit anti - tumor immune response .
this study showed that lps - stimulated human dendritic cells ( dcs ) decreased the expression of hla - dr , cd83 and costimulatory molecules ( cd40 , cd80 and cd86 ) following coculturing with ctla - 4 + breast cancer cells .
moreover , the suppressed dcs further inhibited proliferation of allogeneic cd4 +/ cd8 + t - cells , differentiation of th1 and function of cytotoxic lymphocytes ( ctls ) .
however , ctla - 4 blockade in breast cancer cells could recover dc maturation and cytokine production , elevate antigen - presenting function of dcs , reverse th1 / ctls response and cytokine secretion .
subsequent study demonstrated that the activation of extracellular - signal regulated kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 of dcs caused by ctla - 4 + breast cancer cells were the predominant mechanism of dc suppression .
in addition , ctla - 4 blockade treatment also directly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of ctla - 4 + breast cancer cells .
collectively , ctla - 4 was expressed and functional on human breast cancer cells through influencing maturation and function of dcs in vitro , and ctla - 4 blockage not only recovered the antigen - presenting function of dcs and t - cells activation but also suppressed the biological activity of breast cancer cells themselves .
this study highlights the clinical application of ctla - 4 blockade therapy in breast cancer .
breast cancer cell ctla - 4 dendritic cell cd4 + t cell cd8 + t cell introduction breast cancer is the predominant type of cancer among women in both developed and developing countries , representing the leading cause of cancer - related female mortality worldwide .
although significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and therapies , clinical outcomes are still depressing [ 1 ] .
in recent years , accumulating evidence indicates a functional cross - talk between breast cancer and the immune system .
studies have shown that patients of breast cancer have lower absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes but increased numbers of functionally suppressive cd4 + cd25 + regulatory t cells ( tregs ) in the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment [ 2 , 3 ] .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) obtained from peripheral blood and lymph nodes of patients with operable breast cancer are dysfunctional , with decreased expression levels of mhc class ii and cd86 , and decreased il - 12 secretion [ 4 ] .
it is well known that dcs appear susceptible to tumor - mediated immunosuppression [ 5 ] .
both circulating and tumor - infiltrating dcs are functionally impaired in tumor - bearing animals and in cancer patients .
the ability of dcs to initiate immune response is strictly dependent on the maturation state .
immature dcs ( imdcs ) that deficient of costimulatory molecules can induce t - cell anergy , promote alloantigen - specific tolerance , and generate tregs. that is to say , inhibition of dcs maturation and function is the common mode to evade immune surveillance by tumor cells [ 6 ] .
it has been reported that ex vivo tregs down - modulate b7 - molecules ( cd80 and cd86 ) on cocultured dcs in a cell - contact dependent way and the extent of down - modulation is functionally significant because tregs - conditioned dcs induce poor t - cell proliferation response [ 7 ] .
furthermore , the down - modulation is inhibited by blocking cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen - 4 ( ctla - 4 , also known as cd152 ) [ 7 ] .
ctla - 4 , one of the most fundamental immunosuppressive molecules , is a potent negative regulator of t cell response .
it is normally expressed on the surface of activated t cells and a subset of tregs [ 8 ] .
during the early stage of tumorigenesis , ctla - 4 may elevate the t cell activation threshold , thereby attenuating the antitumor response and elevating tumor susceptibility [ 9 ] .
in breast cancer there is evidence of increased tregs levels in circulation and tumor microenvironment [ 2 , 3 ]. through constitutive expression of ctla - 4 on tregs , the interaction of the cd28 ligand on t lymphocytes with the cd80 / 86 receptor on dcs is blocked , resulting in decreasing of dcs activation , inhibition of il - 12 production , t cell cycle arrest and suppression of cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctls ) proliferation [ 10 ] .
furthermore , ctla - 4 also leads to down - regulation of t - cell response and peripheral tolerance , diminishes the generation of effective antitumor response , and thus brings tumor immune tolerance .
in addition , the natural tregs , which constitutively express ctla - 4 , would be expected to more efficiently engage remaining b7 - molecules than the responder t cells , therefore promoting suppression rather than t - cell proliferation [ 7 , 11 ] .
in addition to activated t cells and tregs , recent studies have confirmed that ctla - 4 is also expressed on nonlymphoid cells of different tissues including liver , skeletal muscle , placental fibroblasts , monocytes , leukemia cells and some solid tumor cells [ 12 ] .
contardi e et al. found that ctla - 4 expressed on tumor cells was able to bind with recombinant form of the ctla - 4 ligands cd80 / cd86 and induced apoptosis associated with sequential activation of both caspase - 8 and caspase - 3 [ 13 ] .
thus , ctla - 4 expressed on tumor cells may be functional .
we have previously demonstrated that ctla - 4 is immune dysregulated in breast cancer and there is a significant increase of ctla - 4 expression not only by t cells from breast cancer patients but also by breast cancer cells themselves .
moreover , elevated expression of ctla - 4 in breast cancer tissues was related to obvious axillary lymph nodes metastases and higher clinical stage [ 12 ] .
in the present study , we hypothesized that ctla - 4 expressed by breast cancer cells ( bccs ) might also interfere with the maturation and function of human dcs in tumor milieu as it did on the tregs .
we have further investigated the effect of ctla - 4 antibody on recovering the maturation and functions of dcs as well as the possible signal transduction pathway involved in conditioned dcs maturation .
the direct effects of ctla - 4 antibody on the biological behavior of breast cancer cells were also investigated .
results ctla - 4 expression in bccs by flow cytometry in this study , we first investigated intracellular and surface expression of ctla - 4 in 4 breast cancer cell lines by facs analysis .
as expected , ctla - 4 expression on breast cancer cell lines was detectable , especially mda - mb - 231 ( 231 ) and mcf - 7 ( m7 ) ( figure 1 ) .
moreover , the intracellular expression was generally higher than the surface expression .
the lower levels of surface expression were observed on skbr3 and t47d ( data not shown ) .
figure 1 flow - cytometric analysis of ctla - 4 in bccs ( mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 ) mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 were stained on their surface or intracellularly with the designated antibodies .
results are expressed as percentage of stained cells .
ctla - 4 + bccs inhibit the phenotypic maturation of cd14 + monocyte - derived dcs and ctla - 4 - blocking could reverse these effects at day 5 , human monocyte - derived imdcs were cocultured with ctla - 4 + bccs in vitro in the presence of lps for another 2 days , while soluble ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs were acted as the positive control .
then the expression of maturation markers on dcs was measured by flow cytometry .
as shown in figure 2 , almost all of the surface markers up - regulated in mature dcs ( mdcs ) were dramatically suppressed in the presence of ctla - 4 + bccs ( 231 and m7 ) .
consistently , all the suppression effects exerted on ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs were observed in soluble ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs .
to assess the ability of ctla - 4 expressed on bccs , we further performed antibody blocking experiment .
when a certain concentration of ctla - 4 functional monoclonal antibody ( mab ) was added into 231 - dc coculture system , the suppressed surface markers were rebounded to different degrees , especially cd40 , cd80 , cd86 and hla - dr. however , ctla - 4 mab did not rebound the suppressed surface markers in m7 - dc coculture system .
therefore , bccs were able to suppress the maturation of dcs by down - regulating the expression of hla - dr , cd40 , cd80 , cd83 and cd86 , which partially was ctla - 4 - dependent .
based on the above results , 231 cell line was chosen as the representative of ctla - 4 + bccs for subsequent experiments .
figure 2 phenotypic properties of dcs from different treatment groups mda - mb - 231 ( 231 ) and mcf - 7 ( m7 ) cell lines were used for examining the effects of ctla - 4 + bccs on dcs .
maturation status of dcs was monitored through examining the surface expression of cd40 , cd80 , cd83 , cd86 and hla - dr. cancer cells were excluded from analysis by gating on cd11c + dcs .
dcs were cultured in medium alone , or with soluble ctla - 4 - fc ( mdc + ctla - 4 ) , or cocultured with bccs alone ( mdc + 231 , mdc + m7 ) or in presence of ctla - 4 mab ( mdc + 231 + ab , mdc + m7 + ab ) , the expression of the surface markers was assayed by flow cytometry .
histograms illustrated staining with isotype - matched control ( fine black line ) and the positive cells ( solid profiles ) .
in these histograms , the expression of cd40 , cd86 , hla - dr were presented as geometric mean fluorescence intensities ( gm ) , while the expression of cd80 and cd83 were presented as gated cells (%) .
results are representative of at least three independent experiments .
ctla - 4 + bccs inhibit the cytokine production of dcs to further characterize conditioned dcs , we determined the cytokine secretion profile of dcs by bio - plex protein array system .
as shown in figure 3a , apart from suppressing the maturation of dcs , soluble ctla - 4 - fc could also inhibit the cytokine production of dcs .
we found that there was a reduced production of il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 6 , il - 12p70 , ifn - gamma , and tnf - alpha in the supernatant from soluble ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs , yet the levels of il - 10 , il - 17a were not distinctly modulated .
comparing with ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs , addition of ctla - 4 mab recovered the cytokine secretion of dcs to some extent , especially il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 12p70 , and tnf - alpha ( figure 3b ) .
these data suggested that ctla - 4 blocking was involved in the up - regulation of cytokines production in ctla - 4 + bccs treated dcs , which might further recover dcs function in immune response .
figure 3 ctla - 4 + bccs inhibit the cytokine production of dcs after coculturing for another two days , the cell - free supernatants of dcs in different coculture were collected and analyzed for the il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 6 , il - 10 , il - 12p70 , il - 17a , ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha production by the bio - plex protein array system .

ctla - 4 + bccs impair the antigen - presenting cell ( apc ) ability of mdcs next we asked whether ctla - 4 + bccs influenced the apc function of mdcs .
to address this question , dcs were cocultured with ctla - 4 + bccs , and then tested for their ability to induce the proliferation of allogeneic cd4 + t cells and cd8 + t cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction ( mlr ) .
as shown in figure 4a - 4b , comparing with day 0 , all conditioned dcs induced amplification of cd4 +/ cd8 + t cells on day 5 .
as expected , mdcs were more efficient at triggering cd4 +/ cd8 + t cells proliferation than imdcs [ 14 , 15 ] .
ctla - 4 + bccs - treated and ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs showed significantly less potency in stimulating both cd4 + and cd8 + allogeneic t cells proliferation comparing with mdcs .
this observation was in keeping with the decreased expression of maturation markers on ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs .
importantly , ctla - 4 - blocking could interfere with suppression of proliferation , because the proliferation of allogeneic cd4 +/ cd8 + t cells recovered to almost normal level in coculture .
thus , ctla - 4 + bccs inhibited the apc function of mdcs along with its suppression on the phenotypic maturation of mdcs and the inhibitory effect was ctla - 4 - dependent .
figure 4 ctla - 4 + bccs inhibit the apc function of mdcs different conditioned dcs ( imdc , mdc , mdc + ctla - 4 , mdc + 231 , mdc + 231 + ab ) were cocultured with allogeneic cd4 + t cells ( a ) or cd8 + t cells ( b ) at ratio of 1:5 , the pure t cell proliferation was also monitored as control .
the proliferation was measured by cck8 method on the day 0 and 5 , respectively .
the bar graphs represent the ratio of cd4 + t or cd8 + t cells proliferation as mean +/ - sd of triplicate samples .
results are representative of three independent experiments .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , and *** p < 0.001 .
ctla - 4 + bccs inhibit the ability of dcs to drive the differentiation of naive cd4 + t - cells into th1 effectors it is well known that the cytokine milieu plays an important role in t - cell differentiation toward either th1 or th2 type [ 16 ] .
since we observed that ctla - 4 + bccs suppressed the maturation and cytokine production of dcs , we further investigated whether allogeneic naive cd4 + t - cells were responsive to ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs .
to achieve this , allogeneic naive t cells were stimulated with differently conditioned dcs , and then we monitored the percentage of th1 / th2 effectors by flow cytometry .
a remarkable decrease in the percentage of ifn - gamma + th1 cells was examined in conditioned dcs groups , while there was no distinct change in the percentage of il - 4 + th2 cells ( figure 5a ) .
however , blockade of ctla - 4 rebounded the function of dcs and further recovered the priming of naive t cells into th1 effector cells , but no significant changes were observed on il - 4 + th2 cells ( figure 5a ) .
consistent with the results of intracellular cytokine staining , cytokine secretion profiles showed that cd4 + t cells stimulated by ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs produced less th1 - type cytokine ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha than mdcs did , while the secretion of th2 - type cytokine il - 4 had no significant change ( figure 6a ) .
similarly , cd4 + t cells stimulated by ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs secreted significantly lower amounts of th1 - type cytokines ( il - 1beta , ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha ) and unchanged th2 - type cytokines ( il - 4 , il - 6 and il - 10 ) , comparing with ctla - 4 mab - treated dcs ( figure 6b ) .
obviously , ctla - 4 + bccs indeed inhibited the ability of dcs to induce the differentiation of naive cd4 + t - cells into ifn - gamma + th1 effectors .
figure 5 ctla - 4 + bccs impair the ability of dcs to induce the response of cd4 +/ cd8 + t cell different conditioned dcs were cocultured with allogeneic cd4 + naive t cells or cd8 + t cells to induce t - cell response at a dc : t ratio of 1:5 .
the percentage of th1 ( ifn - gamma +) , th2 ( il - 4 +) or ctl ( granzyme b +) effectors was assessed by the intracellular staining and flow cytometry on day 5 .
dcs were excluded from analysis by gating on cd4 +/ cd8 + t cells .
the numbers in the dot plots indicated the percentage of cd4 + ifn - gamma + t cells , cd4 + il - 4 + t cells ( a ) or cd8 + granzyme b + t cells ( b ) .
the figure represents one of three similar experiments .

the data are presented as mean +/ - sd of duplicate samples .

ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs suppress cd8 + t - cells function and antitumor immunity in the context of cancer , tumor environment evolve to suppress and evade cd8 + t - cells [ 17 ]. and there was significantly reduced granzyme b production by cd8 + t cells from cancer tissue when compared to non - cancer tissue [ 18 ] .
in the above study , we demonstrated that ctla - 4 + bccs impaired apc ability of mdcs and inhibited the differentiation of naive cd4 + t - cells into th1 effectors .
to address the involvement of ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs in the suppression of cd8 + t - cells function , we further monitored the secretion of granzyme b from cd8 + effector t cells by intracellular flow cytometry analysis .
dcs treated with ctla - 4 + bccs or ctla - 4 - fc showed significantly less potency in stimulating cd8 + t - cells to produce granzyme b comparing with mdcs ( figure 5b ) .
while , the percentage of ganzyme b + ctls was restored in the presence of ctla - 4 mab ( figure 5b ) .
we then measured the cytokine production by the activated cd8 + t - cells through bio - plex protein array .
in accordance with the results of intracellular cytokine staining , ctla - 4 - fc - treated dcs stimulated cd8 + t - cells to produce less ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha and higher il - 10 than mdcs did ( figure 6c ). and the levels of cytokines ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , and il - 6 in ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs were much lower than those in ctla - 4 mab - treated dcs , while the secretion of il - 10 was much higher ( figure 6d ) .
therefore , ctla - 4 + bccs might indirectly suppress cd8 + t cell function in a ctla - 4 - dependent manner .
ctla - 4 + bccs activate erk and stat3 during dc maturation to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in suppression of dc maturation , we investigated the signaling pathways in ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs and mdcs .
mapk / erk pathway was reported to be activated in dcs by lps and regulated dc survival , while sustained erk activation in human dcs produced cells with an immature phenotype [ 19 , 20 ] .
stat3 has been recently characterized as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses and its increased activation in dcs results in impaired t cell response [ 21 ] .
abnormal activation of stat3 was reported to be involved in dc regulatory function under tumor conditioned medium [ 6 ] .
to detect the erk and stat3 induction status in ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs during dc maturation , we examined the effects on erk and stat3 phosphorylation by soluble ctla - 4 - fc , ctla - 4 + bccs alone or in combination with ctla - 4 mab by western blot .
as shown in figure 7a , there was obviously high erk and stat3 activation in the dcs treated with soluble ctla - 4 - fc and ctla - 4 + bccs compared with that in control mdcs .
this was in paralleled with the result that maturation of dcs with lps in the presence of ctla - 4 - fc resulted in robust phosphorylation of stat3 and incubation of dcs with tumor lysates increased erk phosphorylation [ 21 , 22 ] .
in contrast , the erk and stat3 activation were remarkably weakened in the ctla - 4 mab - treated dcs .
in addition , level of phosphorylated p38 was also assessed in this study , but we did not find the significant difference among the different groups ( data not shown ) .
these indicated that erk and stat3 activation may be responsible for ctla - 4 + bccs - induced aberration of dc maturation .
figure 7 the relevance of erk and stat3 activation by ctla - 4 in ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dc and the direct inhibitory effects of ctla - 4 mab on ctla - 4 + bccs ( a ) imdcs were cultured in medium ( control ) , or with soluble ctla - 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , or coculture with ctla - 4 + bccs alone ( 231 ) or in the presence of ctla - 4 mab ( ab ) for 1 hour .
then , treated cells were collected .
whole cell extracts were prepared and the protein levels of phosphorylated ( p ) and total erk1 / 2 and stat3 were determined by western blot .

representative result from three independent experiments was shown .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 .
the direct inhibitory effect of ctla - 4 mab on ctla - 4 + bccs we further explored whether ctla - 4 mab also had a direct effect on the ctla - 4 + bccs as well as dcs .
cck8 assay revealed that ctla - 4 mab markedly inhibited the growth of ctla - 4 + bccs in a dose - and time - dependent manners ( figure 7b ) .
we observed that 3 mug / ml ctla - 4 mab could significantly reduce cell viability with an incubation period of 72 hours ( 14.82 +/ - 2.17 %) .
based on the above results , we evaluated the influence of ctla - 4 mab on cell cycle progression .
pi staining analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that ctla - 4 mab had little influence on cell cycle progression ( figure 7c ) .
finally , we determined the effects of ctla - 4 mab on cellular apoptosis .
results from annexin v - fitc / pi analysis revealed that ctla - 4 + bccs treated with ctla - 4 mab underwent obvious apoptosis than negative cell controls in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 7d ) .
these results suggested that ctla - 4 mab indeed suppressed the biological activity of ctla - 4 + bccs themselves directly .
discussion during tumor development , a complicated and mutual interaction occurs between cancer cells and immune cells [ 15 ] .
patients with various malignancies , including breast cancer , show abnormalities in dc number and function [ 23 ] .
ctla - 4 , constitutively expressed at a high level on tregs , is a negative regulator of t - cell activation which specifically binding to cd80 / cd86 molecules expressed on dcs interrupts cd28 mediated signaling to t cells [ 24 ] .
however , the precise function of ctla - 4 expressed on non - t cells is largely undetected .
in this study , we demonstrated for the first time that ctla - 4 expressed on breast cancer cells was functional and ctla - 4 + bccs played an inhibitory role on the maturation and function of dcs , which was ctla - 4 - dependent .
we first examined the expression of ctla - 4 on breast cancer cell lines and screened out breast cancer cell line mda - mb - 231 , which highly express ctla - 4 intracellularly and on cell surface .
whereafter we performed ctla - 4 + bccs - dc coculture analysis and the detection of monocyte - derived dc - specific maturation markers .
cd80 and cd86 down - regulation is suggested to be an important phenomenon used by tregs to suppress the dcs in vitro in a ctla - 4 - dependent way [ 7 ] .
our results showed that cd80 and cd86 on dcs were down - regulated in the presence of ctla - 4 + bccs which was similar to those in tregs .
in addition , other dc cell surface markers were also down - regulated obviously by ctla - 4 + bccs treatment .
moreover , blockade of ctla - 4 resulted in the remarkable up - regulation of all maturation markers on dcs .
the fact that ctla - 4 + bccs treatment influenced the expression of surface markers during dcs maturation suggested an immune inhibitory mechanism that may be effective in breast cancer .
further studies to determine whether there are regulatory dcs induced by ctla - 4 + bccs would be very interesting .
another major consequence of ctla - 4 + bccs inhibiting dc maturation was the change of cytokine production .
here our results implied that suppression of dc maturation was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the secretion of the pro - inflammatory cytokines ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 6 and il - 12 .
increasing secretion of ifn - gamma and il - 12 could promote cd4 + t - cells to differentiate into th1 cells and suppress th2 formation [ 25 , 26 ] .
on the other hand , tnf - alpha and il - 6 also activate some other immune cell types , such as macrophages and dcs , in addition to t cells [ 27 , 28 ] .
therefore , significant decrease in secretion of these cytokines could lead to the inhibition of dc activation by soluble ctla - 4 - fc. however , up - regulation of il - 17a and il - 10 was undetectable in the present study .
furthermore , comparing with ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs , ctla - 4 mab - treated dcs showed higher cytokine concentrations of pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 12 , and tnf - alpha , which further clearly pointed toward the role of ctla - 4 + bccs in inhibiting dc maturation in a ctla - 4 - dependent way .
it has been reported that the mechanism to induce tolerance might through abortive proliferation or anergy of antigen - specific cd4 + and cd8 + t - cells in vivo or through the generation of tregs to prevent the immune responses by producing il - 10 [ 29 - 31 ] .
as expected , in this study , cd4 + and cd8 + t cells allostimulatory function of mdcs was decreased after treatment with ctla - 4 + bccs .
importantly , addition of ctla - 4 mab restored the proliferation .
these data supported the hypothesis that ctla - 4 - dependent down - regulation of dc costimulation and cytokine production was a major mechanism used by ctla - 4 + bccs to inhibit the peripheral t cell proliferation .
as both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells have been reported to play an important role in immune surveillance , disturbance with the activation of either cd4 + or cd8 + t cells was likely the critical approach for tumor cells to evade the antitumor immunity from the host [ 6 ] .
one of the most important findings in the present study was that ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs suppressed differentiation of th1 and function of ctls .
dcs - derived factors mainly balanced the development of these two th cell phenotypes : th1 cells mainly secret large amounts of ifn - gamma but little il - 4 and il - 10 , conversely , th2 cells can produce large amounts of il - 4 and il - 10 but little ifn - gamma [ 16 ] .
meanwhile , dc - derived il - 12 is an important cytokine that stimulates ifn - gamma production in naive th cells and strongly promotes th1 response [ 32 ] .
indeed , we found that both ctla - 4 - fc and ctla - 4 + bccs down - regulated il - 12 production of dcs and inhibited the ability of dcs to differentiate naive cd4 + t - cells into ifn - gamma + th1 effectors but not il - 4 + th2 cells .
all these further led to the decrease of th1 - type cytokine secretion .
in contrast to the results , ctla - 4 mab treatment rebounded il - 12 and tnf - alpha secretion of dcs and brought about the recovery of th1 differentiation and improvement of ifn - gamma production by th1 cells .
subsequently , we focused on the change of cd8 + t cell function caused by ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs .
it is reported that there is significantly reduced granzyme b production by cd8 + t cells from cancer tissue obtained by lung resection surgery when compared to non - cancer tissue [ 18 , 33 ] .
local treatment of tumor - bearing mice with ctla - 4 functional antibody in a slow - release formulation is extremely effective in activating an endogenous tumor - specific cd8 + t cell response , capable of tumor eradication [ 34 ] .
our experimental findings supported the notion that ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs suppressed the function of ctls and antitumor immune activation , with a significantly lower ability to stimulate ganzyme b - producing cells .
furthermore , ctla - 4 mab treatment recovered the function of ctls through producing higher number of ganzyme b + cd8 + t cells which secreted higher level of ifn - gamma .
next , we deeply explored the mechanisms involved in the dysfunction of ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs .
previous studies have confirmed that aberrant activation of mapk / erk in dcs plays a critical role in tumor - induced immune suppression [ 22 ] , and the relative phosphorylation of erk is now recognized as a critical regulation of il - 12 generation in dcs [ 35 ] .
on the other hand , activated stat3 negatively regulated lps signaling and was associated with defective dc differentiation mediated by tumor cells or tumor - derived factors [ 21 , 36 , 37 ] .
indeed , in our study , erk and stat3 signaling were activated in ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs , suggesting that activation of erk and stat3 may be involved in the defective differentiation of dcs .
il - 10 is a well - known stat3 activators , which has been intimately associated with tregs - dc crosstalk [ 21 ] .
however , in our experiments , we did not find increased il - 10 production by ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs , which might suggest a distinct mechanism of stat3 activation .
soluble ctla - 4 - fc has been shown to suppress cd80 and cd86 gene transcription and protein production by inducing stat3 phosphorylation in dcs [ 21 ] .
keeping in line with these observations , we demonstrated for the first time that erk and stat3 activation of dcs induced by ctla - 4 + bccs were responsible for the inhibition of dc phenotypic differentiation and functional performance .
interestingly , we also observed that the total erk of dcs in coculture systems was generally lower than the dcs alone , the reasonable explanation was that the breast cancer cells regulated the total erk transcription , this may need further investigation .
numbers of clinical trials reported that ctla - 4 mab treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma and prostate cancer could mediate objective clinical regression and enhanced antitumor response by the improvement of effector t - cell activation of patients [ 38 - 40 ] .
a question was what effect ctla - 4 mab could bring on ctla - 4 + bccs .
in this regard , we found that ctla - 4 mab could directly suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of tumor cells .
thus , the therapeutic action of ctla - 4 mab in tumor may be reduplicated .
the precise mechanism behind the antitumor effects of ctla - 4 mab , however , needed to be investigated further .
in summary , ctla - 4 + bccs - treated dcs were phenotypically abnormal and functionally impaired comparing with normal dcs .
they expressed significantly lower levels of maturation makers and were poor at activating alloreactive t cells. and these cells were also less potent at inducing th1 differentiation and ctls function , which is ctla - 4 - dependent .
these abnormalities may be attributed to the aberrant activation of erk and stat3 .
treatment of ctla - 4 mab not only effectively recovered the function of dcs , but also inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of bccs .
our study provided evidence for a novel tumor - evading mechanism in breast cancer , and more importantly , suggested a crucial immunomodulatory target , which may help to provide novel immunotherapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients .

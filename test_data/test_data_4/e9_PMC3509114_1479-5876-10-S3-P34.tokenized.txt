despite similar levels of synovial macrophage infiltration and clinical responses to tnf - blockade , spa is characterized by more pronounced infiltration with alternatively activated macrophages and ongoing osteoproliferation .
here , we investigated whether these differences were related to differential expression and / or function of tnf between both diseases .
methods expression of membrane - bound tnf ( mtnf ) and soluble tnf ( stnf ) was measured in ifn - gamma , il - 4 or il - 10 polarized macrophages obtained from healthy donors .
expression of tnf and its receptors was also measured in synovial fluid ( sf ) and synovial tissue ( st ) of actively inflamed knee joints .
mice transgenically overexpressing mtnf were evaluated for spondylitis and arthritis .
results the expression of mtnf was increased in il - 4 and il - 10 polarized macrophages compared to ifn - gamma polarized macrophages .
moreover , secretion of stnf was impaired in both alternatively polarized macrophages , indicating a shift from stnf to mtnf .
in line with these data , the stnf sf levels were lower in spa compared to ra ( p = 0.01 ) despite similar tnf mrna levels in st. this was not related to altered expression of tnf receptors as both tnf - r1 and tnf - r2 were similarly expressed in st. mrna levels of tace , the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of tnf , were also similar between spa and ra st. to investigate the relevance of overexpressed mtnf in spa pathophysiology , we characterized mtnf transgenic mice .
as previously described , these mice develop a moderate arthritis , resulting in deformation of paws and loss of grip .
histological , the joints were characterized by synovitis , lymphoid aggregates and osteoproliferation .
besides arthritis , all mice spontaneously developed spondylitis as evidenced by a crinkled tail , a hunchback and histological pathophysiology .
conclusions membrane - bound tnf is relatively overexpressed by alternatively polarized macrophages in spa synovitis and leads to an axial and peripheral spa phenotype in transgenic mice .

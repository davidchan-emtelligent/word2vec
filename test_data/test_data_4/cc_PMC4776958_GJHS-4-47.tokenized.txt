background : incarcerated populations are at particular risk for developing specific health conditions .
prior studies of prisons in developing countries have focused on the threat of communicable diseases , though anecdotal evidence suggests that chronic conditions are of particular concern .
this study constitutes the first published investigation of health complaints offered by residents of a prison in the south american nation of guyana .
method : in 2010 , a medical team sent by the toronto non - governmental organization ve'ahavta visited the mazaruni prison in the interior of guyana .
data on patient encounters was collected as part of the triage activity .
results : care was given to 108 patients , staff and family members .
contrary to literature expectations , 50 % of complaints concerned musculoskeletal issues , while only 11 % were genitor - reproductive .
upon examination , 30.6 % of patients were experiencing musculoskeletal problems , most commonly back pain .
conclusion : future medical interventions to this and comparable low - and middle - income country prisons should more vigorously consider physiotherapeutic interventions , in addition to the expected addressing of infectious diseases .
epidemiology prison global health volunteerism underserved communities 1 .
introducation incarcerated populations are at particular risk for developing specific health conditions , due to living in close quarters with large numbers of people , a reduced variety of physical activities , lack of individual control by prisoners over their diets , a heightened risk of physical violence , and unique and unrelenting psychological stresses .
in other words , they have disproportionate health care needs ( may et al. , 2010 ) .
globally , prison - centred communicable diseases remain a significant and unaddressed health crisis ( davies , 2007 ) .
this is particularly true in low income countries ( lmics ) , where communicable diseases are typically more prevalent , and where global scourges , such as hiv / aids and tb , find ready footholds in incarceration facilities with variable hygiene and disease control standards , and with heightened rates of intravenous drug use ( dolan et al. , 2007 ) .
most publication activity regarding health concerns in lmic prisons focuses on the spread of those two aforementioned high profile infectious diseases .
however , both published and anecdotal evidence suggest that non - communicable factors may be quite prevalent and worthy of greater attention .
specifically , mental health and musculoskeletal issues ( dumont et al. , 2012 ) may account for a fair proportion of heretofore unmeasured suffering in incarcerated populations in lmics .
this study describes the findings of a volunteer medical mission to the interior of guyana , specifically the mazaruni region , where direct clinical care was given to residents of a prison with two partnered facilities : the main mazaruni prison , which houses repeat offenders and perpetrators of serious and violent crimes , and sibley hall , which is an associated facility for first offenders .
guyana is an english - speaking country on the south american continent , but with economic and cultureal affiliations with the nations of the caribbean .
it is underpopulated , with fewer than 800,000 residents , though almost all are clustered along the caribbean coast .
the interior of the country is largely undeveloped rainforest , sparsely populated by amerindian tribes , and of interest to international mining and timber concerns .
guyana is considered a poor country , with high rates of hiv / aids , tuberculosis and malaria , relative to most other western hemisphere countries .
nationwide , guyana has approximately 2122 prisoners ( a rate of 281 per 100,000 residents ) , of whom 96 % are male ( international centre for prison studies , 2012 ) .
this rate is on par with that in neighbouring brazil and french guyana , but about 50 % greater than the rates seen in suriname and venezuela .
the incarcerated individuals are spread over a total of 5 major institutions in guyana .
given its stated prison capacity of 1580 persons , the nation is 134 % over - occupied ( international centre for prison studies , 2012 ) .
guyana 's base population has been shrinking over the past few years , but its number of prisoners has been increasing sharply since at least 1995 ( international centre for prison studies , 2012 ) , meaning that its rate of incarceration has been accelerating rapidly indeed .
the guyanese prison population has not been well studied from a health perspective , even less so those incarcerated in this , more remote institution nestled on the fringes of the rainforest .
while our focus was the provision of direct care , our secondary intent was to use the resulting clinical encounter data to describe the patient profile of this population , focusing on both the patients' stated complaints and on the resulting diagnoses post - examination .
2. method in 2010 , as part of a volunteer medical mission organized by the toronto non - governmenta ; organization ( ngo ) called ve'ahavta , a team consisting of two physicians , two nurses , one physiotherapist , one epidemiologist , one team leader and several logistical support people undertook a one day visit to the mazaruni prison to give direct clinical care to assembled patients originating from both the main prison and the associated lesser facility called sibley hall .
the clinic lasted one day , and included the triage , diagnosis and care of all prisoners seeking service , as well as service provision for members of the prison staff and their families .
the only lab tests that the team was equipped to perform in situ were tests of blood and urine sugar , and pregnancy tests .
handwritten data was collected pertaining to patient demographics , clinical complaints and immediate diagnoses .
patient complaints were categorized into 11 broad diagnostic categories .
basic frequency analysis was applied to the resulting data , using spss version 17.0 .
given our low sample size , further statistical testing was not deemed appropriate .
research ethics was granted for this study by the university of ottawa office of research ethics and integrity .
3. results a total of 108 patients were seen , of whom 6 were prison staff or their family members .
only one woman , a prison guard , was examined ; this was not surprising , since only a handful of women worked in the facility .
age and weight were normally and symmetrically distributed across all subjects ; our sample had a mean age of 33.7 years , and a mean mass of 71.9 kg. blood pressure was more skewed , given the presence of several febrile subjects , but median bp was a remarkable textbook normal of 120 / 80 .
no pregnancy tests were given to this cohort , due to the dearth of female patients .
unfortunately , the results of the blood and urine sugar tests did not survive transport back to canada , and therefore cannot be reported herein .
general categories of patient complaints , as assessed during triage , are summarized in table 1 , while post - examination diagnoses are summarized in table 2 .
table 1 categories of patient complaints , assessed at triage patient complaint category number of patients percent distribution musculoskeletal 54 50.0 genito - reproductive ( including all stis ) 12 11.0 head and neurological 11 10.2 skin ( including all rashes ) 7 6.5 vision 7 6.5 respiratory 6 5.6 circulatory 6 5.6 urological 5 4.6 endocrine / metabolic ( including diabetes ) 4 3.7 external injury 4 3.7 gastrointestinal 3 2.8 table 2 categories of diagnoses by physician upon examination diagnosis category number of patients percent distribution musculoskeletal 33 30.6 tuberculosis 3 2.8 hydrocele 3 2.8 fungal infection 3 2.8 hypertension 3 2.8 diabetes 2 1.9 folliculitis 2 1.9 hemorrhoids 2 1.9 vision 2 1.9 various contusions 2 1.9 all others 1 each < 1 4 .
discussion contrary to the literature 's focus on hiv / aids and tb , our experience was that infectious concerns were secondary to non - communicable concerns in this lmic prison population .
musculoskeletal issues were predominant .
the second most common category of complaint was genitor - reproductive in nature , though our clinical examinations typically did not result in a confirmatory diagnosis .
many genito - reproductive complaints were in fact hernia or other lower abdominal strains .
lower back pain was the most common form of musculoskeletal issue , and was frequently confounded by the effects of poor digestion of the standard prison diet of beans and rice .
only one of the 6 non - prisoners examined was suffering from a musculoskeletal issue .
unsurprisingly , our physiotherapist was the most put upon during the clinic , having to give care in groups rather than individually , in order to manage the large number of back pain complaints .
analgesics and anti - inflammatory drugs , most commonly ibuprofen , were prescribed at a high rate .
incarcerated populations in high inome countries ( hics ) are comparatively well studied , but those experiences do not seem applicable to lmics .
in american prisons , for example , it can be argued that the incarcerated tend to be low - income , therefore less medically well served than the american general population ( dumont et al. , 2012 ) prior to their imprisonment .
studies on the american population also focus on hiv / aids , tb , hepatitis c and other stis , while chronic conditions like diabetes and overweight are only now emerging as issues worthy of study ( dumont et al. , 2012 ; wolff et al. , 2012 ) .
mental health , particularly related to addiction , has always been a matter of interest in hic prisons ( gisin et al. , 2012 ) .
the mazaruni prison population likely has a higher proportion of aboriginal prisoners than do prisons elsewhere in the country , due to the comparatively higher density of amerindian settlements in the region .
incarcerated aboriginal populations in other countries , for example australia , are known to exhibit greater rates of mental health symptoms than are seen in the non - incarcerated communities ( heffernan et al. , 2012 ) .
in comparison , the guyanese experience is minimally concerned with stis ( though the country suffers from an impactful national hiv rate of 2.4 % ( government of guyana , 2012 ). and the omission of a mental health focus is ubiquitous across most lmics , in both prison populations and the general public ( siriwardhana et al. , 2011 ) .
but perhaps the most important distinction between the american hic prison experience and the guyanese lmic experience is prisoners' accessibility to health care .
in the words of dumont et al .
( 2012 ) , " among the ironies of contemporary social and political attitudes regarding prisoners in the united states is that the incarcerated constitute almost the only group that has a constitutional right to health care. " whereas , guyanese prisoners must rely upon cyclical visits from a regional doctor , as well as more infrequent , though often better equipped , visits from foreign medical teams .
this may partially explain the comparatively high rate of musculoskeletal complaints .
in well resourced environments , prisoners would have received care well before back pains , for example , would not have progressed to more serious and intractable stages , and would have access to a wider variety of analgesics beyond ibuprofen .
the implications of our findings relate to the preparedness of future medical missions to this and similar lmic prisons .
basing our staffing and pharmacological expectations on national - level indicators would suggest that infectious diseases , primarily hiv / aids , stis and tb , would be the primary health concerns of this population .
what is more needed , it would seem , are greater physiotherapeutic interventions and analgesics .
liaison with prison administrators is also indicated , to perhaps investigate a wide variety of nutritional options for inmates , though this might not be feasible due to local resource constraints .

micrornas ( mirs ) play important roles in modulating gene expression during the processes of tumorigenesis and tumor development .
previous studies have found that mir - 145 is down - regulated in the stomach neoplasm and is related to tumor migration and invasion .
however , both the molecular mechanism and function of mir - 145 in gastric cancer remain unclear .
the present study is the first demonstration of the significant down - regulation of mir - 145 expression in infiltrative gastric cancer compared to expanding gastric cancer .
additionally , correlation analyses revealed strong inverse correlations between mir - 145 and fscn1 expression levels in infiltrative gastric cancer .
furthermore , we demonstrated that mir - 145 directly targets fscn1 and suppresses cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer .
knocking down the expression of fscn1 led to the suppression of migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells , and re - expressing fscn1 in mir - 145 - overexpressing cells reversed their migration and invasion defects .
thus , we concluded that mir - 145 regulates cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer primarily by directly targeting fscn1 .

introduction gastric cancer has one of the highest death rates for malignant tumors worldwide [ 1 ] .
improved medical technology may improve the outcome of gastric cancer .
however , gastric cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer - related deaths [ 2 ] , which is caused by tumor invasion and metastasis .
together , invasion and metastasis form a process in which malignant tumor cells transfer from a primary site to other areas and then form tumors at a distant site through the lymphatic channel , blood vessels or body cavity [ 3 ] .
hence , clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and invasiveness of gastric cancer is necessary .
in 1977 , ming classified gastric carcinomas into expanding and infiltrative types based on their growth and invasiveness patterns [ 4 ] .
these types are readily recognizable histologically .
expanding carcinomas grow en masse and by expansion resulting in the formation of discrete tumor nodules , whereas infiltrative carcinomas have tumor cells that invade individually [ 5 ]. of the two types of gastric cancer , infiltrative gastric cancer is more invasive than expanding gastric cancer .
such a classification thus provides a reference to distinguish gastric cancer samples clinically and facilitates detailed studies regarding the molecular mechanisms of gastric cancer .
micrornas ( mirs ) play critical roles in many biological processes , including cancer processes , by directly inhibiting the expression of target mrnas through various molecular mechanisms [ 6 , 7 ] .
additionally , mirs undergo aberrant regulation during carcinogenesis and can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors [ 7 ] .
recent studies have shown that many mirs affect proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer .
mir - 21 is up - regulated in gastric cancer and promotes tumor proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer by targeting pten [ 8 ] .
in contrast , mir - 145 is down - regulated in human gastric cancer [ 9 ] .
moreover , research has shown that mir - 145 can suppress cell migration and invasion by inhibiting n - cadherin protein translation in gastric cancer cells [ 10 ] .
however , kamikihara et al [ 11 ] detected the expression levels of n - cadherin in 146 patients with gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry , and the results showed that only 31 patients ( 21 %) had n - cadherin - positive expression .
therefore , some other molecular mechanisms of mir - 145 might regulate cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer .
fscn1 is a 55 - kda actin - binding protein that is associated with filopodia and actin - based protrusion formation , and it promotes cell motility , migration and invasion [ 12 , 13 ] .
fscn1 expression is absent or low in normal epithelia , but fscn1 is overexpressed in many carcinomas , including colorectal adenomas , epithelial ovarian cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 14 - 16 ] .
moreover , a series of studies have indicated that enforced fscn1 expression increases the proliferation and invasion of ovarian and gastric cancer cells [ 17 , 18 ] .
recent studies have found that mir - 145 functions as a tumor suppressor and that mir - 145 overexpression suppresses migration and invasion in prostate cancer and bladder cancer by targeting fscn1 [ 19 , 20 ] .
in addition , mir - 145 suppresses gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting n - cadherin .
however , the positive expression rate of n - cadherin in gastric cancer tissues is only 21 % [ 10 , 11 ] .
therefore , determining the key target gene of mir - 145 in regulating gastric cancer invasion is necessary .
in the present study , we first found that mir - 145 expression was remarkably down - regulated in infiltrative gastric cancer compared to that in expanding gastric cancer .
moreover , we provided evidence that mir - 145 suppressed cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer primarily by directly targeting fscn1 , which highlighted the role of mir - 145 and fscn1 in the regulation of gastric cancer malignant phenotypes .

results strong inverse relation between the expression of mir - 145 and its putative target , fscn1 , in human infiltrative type gastric cancer we used the targetscan database ( http :// www.targetscan.org ) to identify the 3 ' utrs of specific target mrnas of mir - 145 that may regulate the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. of all predicted mrnas , we selected fscn1 , which has been previously implicated in tumor migration and invasion .
fscn1 also has highly conserved sequences at the 3 ' utr that are complementary to the mir - 145 seed sequence .
first , we investigated whether the correlation of mir - 145 and fscn1 could be clinically relevant by measuring the expression of mir - 145 and fscn1 mrna / protein levels in normal / tumor paired samples from 80 patients with gastric cancer .
the statistical analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between the expression of mir - 145 and the expression of fscn1 mrna / protein in the 80 pairs of clinical samples ( fig 1a and 1b ) .

ming classified gastric carcinomas into expanding type and infiltrative type based on growth and invasiveness patterns , and a correlation exists between ming 's classification and the clinical prognosis [ 5 ] .
therefore , 40 infiltrative gastric cancer samples and 40 expanding gastric cancer samples were chosen as indicated by the representative he staining ( fig 2a ) .
in this classification , the cells of an expanding carcinoma , by virtue of their limited penetrating power , aggregate and produce a circumscribed mass in the form of polypoid and fungating lesions .
in contrast , the cells of infiltrative carcinoma spread peripherally and widely , and a tumor mass does not form .
we tested the expression of mir - 145 and fscn1 mrna in gastric cancer compared to the adjacent normal gastric mucosa by real - time pcr .
mir - 145 was remarkably down - regulated in infiltrative gastric cancer compared to expanding gastric cancer , while the expression of fscn1 mrna was remarkably up - regulated ( fig 2b ) .
we selected 10 infiltrative gastric cancer samples and 10 expanding gastric cancer samples along with their adjacent normal tissues to analyze expression by qpcr and western blotting .
the overall expression levels of mir - 145 were lower , particularly in the infiltrative gastric cancer samples compared to the adjacent normal gastric mucosa .
in contrast , the overall mrna / protein levels of fscn1 were higher in the infiltrative gastric cancer ( fig 2c ) .
consequently , the expression of mir - 145 and its putative target fscn1 had a strong inverse relation in human infiltrative type gastric cancer , thereby suggesting that the essential roles of mir - 145 and fscn1 are in gastric cancer invasion .

the data are presented as the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments .
mir - 145 directly targets fscn1 in gastric cancer cells to determine if mir - 145 regulates the expression of fscn1 in gastric cancer cells , we first up - regulated the level of mir - 145 in gastric cancer mgc - 803 cells using a lentivirus - based vector .
we then performed qpcr , which revealed that mir - 145 overexpression significantly down - regulated the mrna level of fscn1 ( fig 3a ) , and western blot experiments confirmed that the protein level of fscn1 was also suppressed in mir - 145 - overexpressing cells ( fig 3b ) .
conversely , knockdown of mir - 145 levels using a mir - 145 inhibitor resulted in significantly induced fscn1 mrna / protein expression in both sgc - 7901 and mgc - 803 cells ( fig 3c ) .
we generated a firefly luciferase reporter vector containing the fscn1 3 ' utr and then co - transfected mgc - 803 cells with mir - 145 mimics or a mir - 145 inhibitor to investigate if fscn1 is a direct target of mir - 145 .
the lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity 24 h post - transfection .
the luciferase assay showed that the mir - 145 mimics resulted in an approximate 55 % decrease in activity , whereas the mir - 145 inhibitor increased the luciferase activity by 62 % in mgc - 803 cells compared with the mir - negative control ( fig 3d ) .
moreover , we mutated three major putative mir - 145 recognition elements ( mres ) in the fscn1 3 ' utr via quikchange mutagenesis for use in the luciferase assay ( fig 3d ) .
the results showed that the regulatory effects of the mir - 145 mimics or mir - 145 inhibitor were primarily abrogated , which confirmed that the silencing effects of mir - 145 on fscn1 were abolished by the disruption of the mir - mre interactions ( fig 3d ) .
collectively , these studies provided compelling evidence that fscn1 is a direct target of mir - 145 in gastric cancer cells .

repression of fscn1 is necessary for mir - 145 to inhibit the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells gastric cancer mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells were stably transfected with two different fscn1 shrnas to inhibit fscn1 to better understand the potential role of fscn1 in mir - 145 - mediated tumor migration and invasion .
the interference efficiency of fscn1 shrnas was confirmed by western blot analysis ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
the transwell assay results showed that the ability of cells to migrate and invade was highly suppressed after knocking down the expression of fscn1 in mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells compared to negative control cells ( fig 4c and 4d ) , thereby suggesting an essential role of fscn1 in these processes .

mir - 145 is known to suppress the migration and invasion of many cancer types , including gastric cancer [ 10 , 19 , 21 ] .
as expected , enforced expression of mir - 145 resulted in significantly decreased migration and invasion rates in mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells .
furthermore , simultaneous re - expression of fscn1 compromised the mir - 145 - supressed cell migration and invasion ability almost completely in both mir - 145 - transfected mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells ( fig 5a and 5b ) .
conversely , we used fscn1 shrna to inhibit fscn1 expression in mir - 145 inhibitor - transfected mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells .
knockdown of fscn1 completely reversed the mir - 145 inhibitor - mediated activation of cell migration and invasion , thus suggesting the essential role of fscn1 in this process ( fig 5c and 5d ) .
collectively , the above results demonstrated that the repression of fscn1 is necessary for mir - 145 to inhibit the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells .

discussion the deregulation of mirs has been implicated in various human cancers , including human gastric cancer .
however , the molecular mechanisms by which mirs modulate the process of carcinogenesis and the behavior of cancer cells have not been completely defined .
differential mir expression in tumors compared with their adjacent normal tissues or between groups of tumor samples with a favorable or poor clinical outcome has been used to generate mir signatures with potential prognostic and / or predictive value in certain cancer types .
nevertheless , the involvement of the aberrantly expressed mirs in human gastric cancer remains largely unexplored .
previous studies have reported that mir - 145 is down - regulated in various human malignancies , including breast cancer , lung cancer and gastric cancer [ 9 , 22 , 23 ] .
lu et al [ 24 ] found that mir - 145 functions as a tumor suppressor and targets two oncogenes , namely angpt2 and nedd9 , in renal cell carcinoma .
another study has shown that mir - 145 suppresses cell migration and invasion by inhibiting n - cadherin protein translation in gastric cancer cells [ 10 ] .
however , kamikihara et al [ 11 ] found that only 21 % gastric cancer patients have n - cadherin - positive expression as analyzed by immunohistochemistry .
therefore , an alternative molecular mechanism underlying mir - 145 is involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer .
in the present study , we confirmed that mir - 145 is down - regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to the adjacent normal gastric mucosa , which is consistent with previous findings [ 9 ] .
in an attempt to identify novel downstream targets of mir - 145 , we used the targetscan database to perform screening experiments. from several candidates , we selected fscn1 for further experiments because fscn1 has been found to play important roles in tumor migration and invasion .
several lines of evidence suggest that fscn1 is the direct downstream target of mir - 145 .
firstly , fscn1 contains highly conserved sequences at the 3 ' utr that are complementary to the mir - 145 seed sequence .
secondly , an inverse correlation between mir - 145 and fscn1 was found in the paired samples from gastric cancer patients .
finally , when classifying the clinical samples into expanding type and infiltrative type based on ming 's classification , we found that mir - 145 is remarkably down - regulated in infiltrative gastric cancer compared to expanding gastric cancer .
meanwhile , a stronger inverse correlation was also detected between mir - 145 and fscn1 expression levels in infiltrative gastric cancer .
the present study shed new light on the correlation between mir - 145 and fscn1 in infiltrative gastric cancer .
in a previous study , lauren divided gastric cancers into the following two types : intestinal type and diffuse type [ 25 ] .
intestinal type cancer is described as a glandular tumor resembling colonic carcinoma , and diffuse type cancer is composed of solitary or small clusters of cells without the formation of glands .
the tumor types in lauren 's and ming 's classification closely correspond to each other .
most expanding tumors have features of intestinal - type cancer , and most infiltrative tumors are diffuse type cancers [ 5 ] .
however , a significant number of gastric carcinomas cannot be classified into intestinal type or diffuse type , including undifferentiated cancers that do not infiltrate diffusely and glandular cancers that infiltrate diffusely .
in addition , the detection of early gastric cancer using lauren 's classification is relatively difficult because the early stage of diffuse type cancer , by definition , is not diffuse .
however , ming 's classification may solve these problems [ 5 ] .
in ming 's classification , the patterns of cell distribution clearly indicate a fundamental difference in their growth potential as well as power of penetration and invasion .
as infiltrative gastric cancer is more invasive than expanding gastric cancer , these results suggest that mir - 145 and fscn1 both play crucial roles in gastric cancer invasion .
although several reports have implicated the regulation of fscn1 by mirs in many carcinomas [ 19 , 20 , 26 ] , to the best of our knowledge , no report has suggested that fscn1 is a direct target of mir - 145 in gastric cancer .
in this study , we confirmed that mir - 145 represses fscn1 expression and directly targets the 3 ' utr of fscn1 in gastric cancer cells .
in addition , the simultaneous re - expression of fscn1 compromised the mir - 145 - supressed cell migration and invasion ability almost completely in mir - 145 - transfected mgc - 803 and sgc - 7901 cells , which indicated that the repression of fscn1 is necessary for mir - 145 to inhibit the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells .
therefore , fscn1 is an important downstream target of mir - 145 in regulating gastric cancer invasion .
in summary , the present study identified that mir - 145 is primarily down - regulated in infiltrative gastric cancer and that mir - 145 expression and fscn1 expression have a strong inverse correlation in infiltrative gastric cancer .
functionally , we demonstrated that mir - 145 suppresses cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer primarily by directly targeting fscn1 .
hence , restoring the expression of mir - 145 can be explored as an alternative therapeutic strategy against gastric cancer .

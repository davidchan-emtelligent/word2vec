pleomorphic adenoma directly arising in the neck is thought to originate from heterotopic salivary gland tissue .
in this article , we present the case of a 55 - year - old female patient with a histologically proven pleomorphic adenoma located at the left mandibular angle , anteriorly to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and posteroinferiorly to the submandibular gland .
as the patient also had an ipsilateral thyroid nodule with coarse calcifications , clinical and radiological features suggested a possible level ii metastatic lymph node .
however , ultrasound - guided fine needle aspiration cytology and postsurgery histopathological examination revealed a pleomorphic adenoma arising from heterotopic salivary gland tissue unrelated to a benign thyroid nodule .
in this article , we provide a review of the existing literature on heterotopic salivary gland tissue and related neoplasms and discuss their imaging presentation .
1. introduction heterotopic salivary gland tissue ( hsgt ) is defined as normal salivary tissue located at sites other than the major and minor salivary glands .
though hsgt has been described in the temporal bone , lymph nodes , and mandible , thyroid , and parathyroid tissues , its presence in the upper and lower neck is very rare , with neoplasms arising from hsgt in the neck being even rarer [ 1 - 5 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , only very few cases of ectopic salivary tissue tumors of the upper neck in adults have been reported so far [ 6 ] .
we report herein the case of a pleomorphic adenoma ( benign mixed tumor ) arising in the upper neck and mimicking a lymph node metastasis upon clinical examination and cross - sectional imaging .
we discuss the imaging features and diagnostic difficulty for this rare entity , providing a radiologic - pathologic correlation .
2. case report a 55 - year - old female patient , with known sleep apnea and chronic tobacco use , was addressed to the otorhinolaryngology - head and neck surgery department of our hospital due to increasing dyspnea upon exertion .
nasofibroscopic exploration revealed leukoplakia on the right vocal cord and bilateral reinke 's edema .
on physical examination , a mass located along the anterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 cm below the left mandibular angle was palpated .
the lesion was elastic and not painful , but partly fixed to deeper neck structures .
to further assess this lesion , a contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) of the neck was performed .
it revealed a 23 x 17 x 25 mm solid nodule with coarse calcifications located in the left thyroid gland and an ipsilateral 24 x 25 x 35 mm well - delineated hypodense mass located in the level iia lymph node group ( figure 1 ) .
although the ct features were not typical of a metastatic lymph node , due to the presence of an ipsilateral suspicious thyroid nodule , a ipsilateral lymph node metastasis was suspected .
ultrasonography ( us ) with subsequent us - guided fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) was carried out .
the thyroid lesion was slightly hyperechoic to the muscle , hypervascular on color doppler , with coarse peripheral calcifications , whereas the level iia lesion was well delineated and solid , being hypoechoic to muscle tissue , homogenous , and hypovascular ( figure 2 ) .
the level iia mass was separated from the submandibular gland by the facial vein , and a fatty cleavage plane was clearly visible between the mass and submandibular gland , both upon ct and us imaging .
fnac of the thyroid nodule showed follicular cell clusters organized into macrofollicles , compatible with a benign thyroid nodule .
fnac of the level iia mass showed clusters of benign epithelial cells , myxoid substance , and myoepithelial cells , suggesting the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma .
the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia , and histopathological examination confirmed the fnac findings .
histopathology indicated the level iia mass to be an encapsulated classic pleomorphic adenoma with a predominant myoepithelial component , surrounded by clusters of normal salivary gland tissue embedded in fatty tissue ( figure 3 ) .
three reactive lymph nodes were found in the tumor vicinity but without any evidence of malignant cells or perineural spreading .
the patient 's postoperative recovery proved uneventful , and she was discharged 2 days later .
no lesion recurrence was found at the 2 - year follow - up visit .
3. discussion at the head and neck level , salivary tissue is present in the major salivary glands ( parotid , submandibular , and sublingual glands ) , minor salivary glands ( upper aerodigestive tract ) , and accessory salivary glands ( immediate anterior periparotid region ) , and this is present in association with branchial cleft anomalies , or more rarely , as heterotopic salivary gland tissue ( hsgt ) .
hsgt is defined as salivary tissue outside the major , minor , and accessory salivary glands , with no clinical or histological features of branchial cleft anomalies [ 7 ] .
though rare , hsgt in the head and neck can be seen in a variety of locations , such as lymph nodes , external auditory canal , mandible , mastoid bone , middle ear , tongue , anterior sternocleidomastoid muscle and sternoclavicular joint , thyroid and parathyroid glands , and upper and lower neck regions [ 2 ] .
the embryological basis for this rare condition is unknown .
one of the theories assumes hsgt in the neck to be caused by defective closure of the precervical his sinus , with internal heteroplasia [ 3 , 8 ] .
hsgt is susceptible to the same disorders than those affecting the major and minor salivary glands , namely , infectious or inflammatory disorders , as well as neoplastic diseases .
both benign and malignant neoplasms can occur in hsgt .
the literature suggests that pleomorphic adenoma is the second most common neoplasm arising from hsgt after warthin 's tumor [ 2 ] .
although pleomorphic adenoma arising from hsgt is rare , several authors have suggested that it should be systematically considered in the differential diagnosis of neck swellings .
most pleomorphic adenomas arise in the parotid glands , in which case the diagnosis is usually straightforward upon imaging .
pleomorphic adenomas have mainly well - defined borders and most often display a myxoid matrix on histopathology examination , with typically high signal intensity on t2 - weighted sequences , low signal intensity on t1 - weighted sequences , and moderate contrast enhancement .
on diffusion - weighted sequences , there is no restricted diffusivity .
on ct , the tumors display only minimal enhancement ; on us , they are strongly hypoechoic , while being hardly vascularized on doppler - us. the combination of typical location in the parotid gland , well - defined borders , and abovementioned imaging features enables a correct presumptive diagnosis in most cases .
nevertheless , in the presence of atypical features ( poorly defined borders and hypercellular variants with lower signal intensity on t2 - weighted sequences ) or atypical location , us - guided fnac is recommended prior to surgery .
in the current case , the presence of a thyroid nodule with coarse calcifications , along with a hypoechoic mass on us located in the ipsilateral level ii lymph node group , suggested a possible malignant tumor with lymph node metastasis .
in this case , the difficulty in establishing the correct diagnosis arose from the unusual location of the pleomorphic adenoma , as well as from its association with a thyroid nodule .
in this case , us - guided fnac yielded the correct diagnosis .
us , whether with or without fnac , is generally recommended as the first preoperative radiological examination for any mass of the head and neck regions [ 9 ] .
despite the rarity of salivary lesions , most nonneoplastic lesions as well as benign and malignant tumors are easily recognizable and properly diagnosed based on cytological specimens [ 10 ] .
the diagnostic value of fnac in the assessment of salivary gland lesions has been carefully evaluated and reported in the literature , with a consensus among authors regarding its high specificity and diagnostic precision [ 10 ] .
the accuracy of fnac depends on the pathologist 's experience and precision [ 11 ] .
this little - invasive method allows for an excellent distinction to be made between benign and malignant tumors of the salivary glands , while providing other relevant advantages like low cost and ease of execution and accessibility , in addition to being relatively painless , well tolerated , and associated with a very low risk of cancer cell implantation along the needle pathway [ 11 ] .
however , mri is the preferred imaging modality designed to evaluate neoplastic lesions of salivary glands , especially in the case of larger and aggressive tumors .
mri also proves useful in differentiating tumor types , particularly in the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma ( discussed earlier ) [ 9 ] .
though the fnac samples of pleomorphic adenoma of any location are often highly reliable , they prove to be nondiagnostic in the event of complex tumor composition [ 9 ] .
it is well known and accepted that inconclusive salivary gland fnacs , with significant impact on clinical and surgical management , are due to several factors , such as heterogeneous morphology , resemblance to normal salivary tissue , cystic components , clear cells , and oncocytic metaplasia [ 10 ] .
in salivary gland fnac specimens , diagnostic difficulties with fnac are most commonly encountered for the differentiation between pleomorphic adenoma and some subtypes of adenoid cystic carcinomas , basal cell adenomas , low - grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas , and acinic cell carcinomas .
the diagnosis proves challenging in low - grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas , with a thick mucinous fluid background and paucicellular smear .
in such cases , malignant tumors are mistakenly reported as benign lesions [ 11 ] .
although pleomorphic adenoma is associated with good prognosis , the treatment of choice is surgical excision with free margins in order to prevent local recurrence and malignant transformation into carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma ( cepa ) , carcinosarcoma ( true malignant mixed tumor ) [ 12 ] , or metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma [ 13 ] .
according to the literature , the risk of malignant transformation is 3 - 15 % , increasing with the time elapsed prior to diagnosis and tumor size [ 14 ] .
cepa is both an aggressive tumor and feared complication of long - standing pleomorphic adenoma , accounting for 11.6 % of all malignant salivary gland tumors [ 14 ] .
a few cases of cepa originating from minor salivary gland tissue in the neck region have been described , yet with only one case originating from hsgt available in the english literature [ 14 ] .
multifocal local recurrence of pleomorphic adenomas , a typical feature , is well described in the literature , probably accounted for by close margins , pseudocapsular tears , or tumor spillage upon surgical resection .
hypocellular tumors , younger age at initial presentation , female gender , and tumor recurrence are considered critical factors for an increased risk of recurrence [ 15 ] .
the recurrence probability is higher within the first 10 years following initial surgery , and , in rare instances , recurrences have been reported occurring as long as 45 years following initial surgery [ 16 , 17 ] .
regular us follow - up over the patient 's lifetime is recommended for superficial head and neck pleomorphic adenomas .
mri follow - up is considered useful in selected cases , nonaccessible to us [ 18 ] .
4. conclusion ectopic pleomorphic adenoma is one of the differential diagnoses to be taken into account when facing any level ii cervical mass with well - defined borders at imaging , hypoechoic and hypovascular us features , and with minor but homogeneous contrast enhancement at ct. as fnac is a fairly accurate preoperative procedure for the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma , it should be carried out under us guidance to confirm the diagnosis .
